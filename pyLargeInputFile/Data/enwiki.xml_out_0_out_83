A ''codec'' (the ''program'') should not be confused with a coding or compression ''format'' or ''standard'' – a format is a document (the standard), a way of storing data, while a codec is a program (an ''implementation'') which can read or write such files. In practice &quot;codec&quot; is sometimes used loosely to refer to formats, however.

A codec encodes a data stream or signal for transmission, storage or [[encryption]], or decodes it for playback or editing. Codecs are used in [[Video teleconference|videoconferencing]], [[streaming media]] and [[video editing]] applications.  A video camera's [[analog-to-digital converter]] (ADC) converts its analog signals into digital signals, which are then passed through a [[video codec|video compressor]] for digital transmission or storage. A receiving device then runs the signal through a video decompressor, then a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC) for analog display. The term ''codec'' is also used as a generic name for a video conferencing unit.

== Related concepts ==
An [[endec]] (encoder/decoder) is a similar yet different concept mainly used for [[hardware]].  In the mid 20th century, a &quot;'''codec'''&quot; was hardware that coded analog signals into [[Pulse-code modulation]] (PCM) and decoded them back.  Late in the century the name came to be applied to a class of software for converting among digital signal formats, and including [[compander]] functions.

A [[modem]] is a contraction of '''mo'''dulator/'''dem'''odulator (modem was called dataset by telcos) and converted digital data from computers to analog for phone line transmission. On the receiving end the analog was converted back to digital.  Codecs do the opposite (convert audio analog to digital and then computer digital sound back to audio). 

An [[audio codec]] converts analog audio signals into digital signals for transmission or storage. A receiving device then converts the digital signals back to analog using an audio decompressor, for playback. An example of this are the codecs used in the sound cards of personal computers. A [[video codec]] accomplishes the same task for video signals.

== Compression quality ==
* Lossy codecs: Many of the more popular codecs in the software world are [[lossy]], meaning that they reduce quality by some amount in order to achieve compression. Often, this type of compression is virtually indistinguishable from the original uncompressed sound or images, depending on the codec and the settings used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Audio quality of aac vs. mp3 vs. wma vs. ogg encoders publisher=SoundExpert |url=http://soundexpert.org/ |accessdate=2010-07-25 |quote=above 5.0 – all sound artifacts will be beyond threshold of human perception with corresponding perception margin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller data sets ease the strain on relatively expensive storage sub-systems such as [[non-volatile memory]] and [[hard disk]], as well as write-once-read-many formats such as [[CD-ROM]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]]. Lower data rates also reduce cost and improve performance when the data is transmitted.

* Lossless codecs: There are also many [[lossless]] codecs which are typically used for archiving data in a compressed form while retaining all of the information present in the original stream. If preserving the original quality of the stream is more important than eliminating the correspondingly larger data sizes, lossless codecs are preferred. This is especially true if the data is to undergo further processing (for example [[editing]]) in which case the repeated application of processing (encoding and decoding) on lossy codecs will degrade the quality of the resulting data such that it is no longer identifiable (visually, audibly or both). Using more than one codec or encoding scheme successively can also degrade quality significantly. The decreasing cost of storage capacity and network bandwidth has a tendency to reduce the need for lossy codecs for some media.

=== Media codecs ===

Codecs are often designed to emphasize certain aspects of the media, or their use, to be encoded.  For example, a digital video (using a DV codec) of a sports event needs to encode motion well but not necessarily exact colors, while a video of an art exhibit needs to perform well encoding color and surface texture.

Audio codecs for cell phones need to have very low [[Latency (audio)|latency]] between source encoding and playback; while audio codecs for recording or broadcast can use high-latency [[audio compression (data)|audio compression]] techniques to achieve higher fidelity at a lower bit-rate.

There are thousands of audio and video codecs ranging in cost from free to hundreds of dollars or more. This variety of codecs can create compatibility and obsolescence issues. By contrast, raw uncompressed [[PCM audio]] (44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz, 16 bit stereo, as represented on an audio CD or in a .wav or .aiff file) is a standard across multiple platforms.

Many [[multimedia]] data streams contain both [[Sound|audio]] and [[video]], and often some metadata that permit synchronization of audio and video. Each of these three streams may be handled by different programs, processes, or hardware; but for the multimedia data streams to be useful in stored or transmitted form, they must be encapsulated together in a [[container format (digital)|container format]]. 

Lower [[bitrate|bit rate]] codecs allow more users, but they also have more distortion. Beyond the initial increase in distortion, lower bit rate codecs also achieve their lower bit rates by using more complex algorithms that make certain assumptions, such as those about the media and the packet loss rate. Other codecs may not make those same assumptions. When a user with a low bit-rate codec talks to a user with another codec, additional distortion is introduced by each transcoding.

The notion of [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] being a codec is incorrect as AVI is a [[container format (digital)|container format]], which many codecs might use (although not to [[ISO standard]]). There are also other well-known containers such as [[Ogg]], [[Advanced Systems Format|ASF]], [[QuickTime]], [[RealMedia]], [[Matroska]], [[DivX#DivX_Media_Format_.28DMF.29|DivX Media Format]] and containers defined as ISO standards, such as [[MPEG transport stream]], [[MPEG program stream]], [[MP4]] and [[ISO base media file format]].

'''Clyde William Tombaugh''' (February 4, 1906 &amp;ndash; January 17, 1997) was an [[United States|American]] [[astronomer]]. Although he is best known for his discovery in 1930 of the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]], the first object to be discovered in what would later be identified as the [[Kuiper Belt]], Tombaugh also discovered many [[asteroid]]s; he also called for serious scientific research of [[unidentified flying object]]s.

==Biography==
Tombaugh was born in [[Streator, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tombaugh|first=Clyde|coauthors=Patrick Moore|title=Out of the Darkness: The Planet Pluto|publisher=Stackpole Books|year=1980|location=Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|pages=17|isbn=0811711633}} ''&quot;I was born on a farm near Streator, Illinois, on 4 February 1906.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; After his family moved to [[Burdett, Kansas]], Tombaugh's plans for attending college were frustrated when a [[hail]]storm ruined their crops.&lt;ref name = &quot;Academy&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|title=A Man of Universal Wonder|work=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/pagegen/index.html|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|date=2006-09-09|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/tom0bio-1|accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1926, he built several [[telescope]]s with lenses and mirrors he ground himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Academy&quot;/&gt; He sent drawings of [[Jupiter]] and [[Mars]], as well as his telescopes to the [[Lowell Observatory]]. These resulted in a job offer. Tombaugh was employed at the [[Lowell Observatory]] from 1929 to 1945. 

Following his discovery of Pluto, Tombaugh earned bachelor's and master's degrees in astronomy from the [[University of Kansas]] in 1936 and 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;Academy&quot;/&gt; During [[World War II]] he taught naval personnel navigation at [[Northern Arizona University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Academy&quot;/&gt; He worked at the [[White Sands Missile Range]] in the early 1950s, and taught astronomy at [[New Mexico State University]] from 1955 until his retirement in 1973. He died in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]] in 1997, aged 90. He was survived by his widow, Patricia and their children: daughter Annette and son Alden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Karl|title=Tombaugh Family Donates Astronomer's Papers to NMSU|publisher=Panorama|date=Summer 2001|url=http://www.nmsu.edu/~ucomm/Panorama/summer2001/path.html|accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tombaugh was the great-uncle of Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher [[Clayton Kershaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kershaw|first=Clayton|title=Chat with Clayton Kershaw|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2009-12-22|url=http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/chat/_/id/30042/dodgers-clayton-kershaw|accessdate=2009-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tombaugh was an active [[Unitarian-Universalism|Unitarian-Universalist]].

The [[asteroid]] [[1604 Tombaugh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=(1604) Tombaugh|publisher=Asteroid Dynamic Site|url=http://hamilton.dm.unipi.it/cgi-bin/astdys/astibo?objects:Tombaugh;main|accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered in 1931, is named after him. He himself discovered hundreds of asteroids, beginning with 2839 Annette in 1929, mostly as a by-product of his search for Pluto and his further searches for other celestial objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Academy&quot;/&gt; Tombaugh named some of them after his wife, children and grandchildren. The [[Royal Astronomical Society]] awarded him the [[Jackson-Gwilt Medal]] in 1931. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Approximately one ounce of his ashes are being carried on the [[New Horizons]] spacecraft, launched in 2006 for a flyby of Pluto in 2015. The container includes the inscription: ''&quot;Interned &lt;!-- Interred?? --&gt;herein are remains of American Clyde W. Tombaugh, discoverer of Pluto and the solar system's 'third zone'.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of Pluto==
[[File:Lowell astrograph.jpg|thumb|left|Tombaugh created his photographic plates using this 13-inch [[astrograph]]]]

While a young researcher working for the [[Lowell Observatory]] in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], Tombaugh was given the job to perform a systematic search for a [[Trans-Neptunian object|trans-Neptunian]] planet (also called [[Planet X]]), which had been predicted by [[Percival Lowell]] and [[William Henry Pickering|William Pickering]]. 

Tombaugh used the observatory's 13-inch [[astrograph]] to take photographs of the same section of sky several nights apart. He then used a [[blink comparator]] to compare the different images. When he shifted between the two images, a moving object, such as a planet, would appear to jump from one position to another, while the more distant objects such as stars would appear stationary. Tombaugh noticed such a moving object in his search, near the place predicted by Lowell, and subsequent observations showed it to have an orbit beyond that of Neptune. This ruled out classification as an asteroid, and they decided this was the ninth planet that Lowell had predicted. The discovery was made on Tuesday, February 18, 1930, using images taken the previous month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kshs.org/portraits/tombaugh_clyde.htm Kansas State Historical Society portrait]&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;Pluto&quot; was reportedly suggested by [[Venetia Phair|Venetia Burney]], then an 11-year-old [[England|English]] school girl, who died in April 2009, having lived to see the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet. It won out over numerous other suggestions partly because it was named after the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[Pluto (god)|god of the underworld]] because he was able to render himself invisible and because [[Percival Lowell]]'s initials PL formed the first 2 letters. The name Pluto was officially adopted on May 1, 1930. 

[[File:Pluto discovery plates.png|thumb|The photographic plates that were used to discover [[Pluto]] at [[apparent magnitude]] +15.4]]

Following the discovery, starting in the 1990s, of other [[Kuiper belt]] objects, Pluto began to be seen not as a planet orbiting alone at 40 [[Astronomical unit|AU]], but as the largest of a group of icy bodies in that region of space. After it was shown that at least one such body was larger than Pluto, on August 24, 2006 the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) reclassified Pluto, grouping it with two similarly sized &quot;[[dwarf planet]]s&quot; rather than with the eight &quot;[[classical planets]]&quot;. 

Tombaugh's widow Patricia stated after the IAU's decision that while Clyde may have been disappointed with the change since he had resisted attempts to remove Pluto's planetary status in his lifetime, he would have accepted the decision now if he were alive. She noted that he ''&quot;was a scientist. He would understand they had a real problem when they start finding several of these things flying around the place.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Associated Press|authorlink=Associated Press|title=Pluto Discoverer Saw It Coming, Says His Widow|publisher=CTV|date=2006-08-25|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060825/pluto_discoverer_widow_060825/20060825?hub=SciTech|accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further search==
Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, and the lack of further discoveries left him satisfied that no other object of a comparable [[apparent magnitude]] existed near the [[ecliptic]]. No more Trans-Neptunian objects were discovered until {{mpl|(15760) 1992 QB|1}}, in 1992.

However, more recently the relatively bright object {{dp|Makemake}} has been discovered. It has a relatively high orbital [[inclination]], but at the time of Tombaugh's discovery of Pluto, Makemake was only a few degrees from the ecliptic near the border of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]]&lt;ref&gt;based on Minor Planet Center online Minor Planet Ephemeris Service: March 1, 1930: RA: 05h51m, Dec: +29.0&lt;/ref&gt; at an apparent magnitude of 16.&lt;ref name=FY9&gt;{{cite web|title=HORIZONS Web-Interface|publisher=[http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov JPL Solar System Dynamics]|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi?find_body=1&amp;body_group=sb&amp;sstr=2005FY9|accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position was also very near the [[galactic equator]], making it almost impossible to find such an object within the dense concentration of background stars of the [[Milky Way]].

==Asteroids discovered==
[[File:Lowell blink comparator.jpg|thumb|Tombaugh compared his photographic plates using this blink comparator.]]
Tombaugh discovered nearly 800 [[asteroid]]s&lt;ref name = &quot;asteroids&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Darling|first=David|authorlink=David Darling (astronomer)|title=Tombaugh, Clyde William (1906-1997)|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/ETEmain.html|work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science|accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; during his search for Pluto and years of follow-up searches looking for another candidate for the postulated Planet X.

==Interest in UFOs==
Tombaugh was probably the most eminent astronomer to have reported seeing [[unidentified flying object]]s and to support the [[extraterrestrial hypothesis]]. On August 20, 1949, Tombaugh saw several [[UFO]]s near [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]]. He described them as six to eight rectangular lights, stating: ''&quot;I doubt that the phenomenon was any terrestrial reflection, because... nothing of the kind has ever appeared before or since... I was so unprepared for such a strange sight that I was really petrified with astonishment.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clyde Tombaugh, Ph.D.|publisher=UFO Evidence|url=http://www.etcontact.net/researchers/detail107.htm|accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another sighting by Tombaugh a year or two later while at a White Sands observatory was of an object of &amp;minus;6 magnitude, four times brighter than Venus at its brightest, going from the zenith to the southern horizon in about 3 seconds. The object executed the same maneuvers as in Tombaugh's first sighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steiger|first=Brad|title=Project Blue Book|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1976|page=280|isbn=0-345-34525-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tombaugh later reported having seen three of the mysterious [[green fireballs]], which suddenly appeared over New Mexico in late 1948 and continued at least through the early 1950s. Despite this, the final report of [[Green Fireballs|Project Twinkle]] &amp;mdash; see [[#External links|external link]] &amp;mdash; claimed that he ''&quot;... never observed an unexplainable aerial object despite his continuous and extensive observations of the sky.&quot;'' {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In 1956 Tombaugh had the following to say about his various sightings: ''&quot;I have seen three objects in the last seven years which defied any explanation of known phenomenon, such as Venus, atmospheric optic, meteors or planes. I am a professional, highly skilled, professional astronomer. In addition I have seen three green fireballs which were unusual in behavior from normal green fireballs... I think that several reputable scientists are being unscientific in refusing to entertain the possibility of [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] origin and nature.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ledger|first=Don|title=UFO UpDates|date=2004-09-20|url=http://virtuallystrange.net/ufo/updates/2004/sep/m20-022.shtml|accessdate=2007-02-28|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070210090352/http://virtuallystrange.net/ufo/updates/2004/sep/m20-022.shtml|archivedate=2007-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shortly after this in January 1957, in an [[Associated Press]] article in the ''[[Alamogordo Daily News]]'' titled ''&quot;Celestial Visitors May Be Invading Earth's Atmosphere,&quot;'' Tombaugh was again quoted on his sightings and opinion about them. ''&quot;Although our own solar system is believed to support no other life than on Earth, other stars in the galaxy may have hundreds of thousands of habitable worlds. Races on these worlds may have been able to utilize the tremendous amounts of power required to bridge the space between the stars...&quot;'' Tombaugh stated that he had observed celestial phenomena which he could not explain, but has seen none personally since 1951 or 1952. &quot;These things, which do appear to be directed, are unlike any other phenomena I ever observed. Their apparent lack of obedience to the ordinary laws of celestial motion gives credence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Jerry|title=UFO Encyclopedia: Volume 2|publisher=|year=1997|page=896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, Tombaugh had also told the Naval missile director at [[White Sands Missile Range]], Commander Robert McLaughlin, that he had seen a bright flash on Mars in August 1941, which he now attributed to an atomic blast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaughlin|first=Robert|title=Letter from Robert McLaughlin to James Van Allen|publisher=Roswell Proof|date=1949-05-12|url=http://www.roswellproof.com/McLaughlin_Van_Allen_letter.html|accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tombaugh also noted that the first atomic bomb tested in New Mexico would have lit up the dark side of the Earth like a neon sign and that Mars was coincidentally quite close at the time, the implication apparently being that the atomic test would have been visible from Mars.

In June 1952, Dr. [[J. Allen Hynek]], an astronomer acting as a scientific consultant to the Air Force's [[Project Blue Book]] UFO study, secretly conducted a survey of fellow astronomers on UFO sightings and attitudes while attending an astronomy convention. Tombaugh and four other astronomers, including Dr. [[Lincoln LaPaz]] of the University of New Mexico, told Hynek about their sightings. Tombaugh also told Hynek that his telescopes were at the Air Force's disposal for taking photos of UFOs, if he was properly alerted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steiger|first=Brad|title=Project Blue Book|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1976|pages=268–85|isbn=0-345-34525-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Near-Earth satellite search==
[[File:Tombaugh Lapaz 3 3 1954.jpg|thumb|Clyde Tombaugh (left) discussing search for near-Earth satellites with Dr. [[Lincoln LaPaz]] (right), March 3, 1954. Photo from ''The Albuquerque Journal'']]

Tombaugh's offer may have led to his involvement in a search for near-Earth [[satellite]]s, first announced in late 1953 and sponsored by the Army Office of Ordnance Research. Another public statement was made on the search in March 1954 (photo at right), emphasizing the rationale that such an orbiting object would serve as a natural [[space station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Armed Forces Seeks &quot;Steppingstone to Stars&quot;|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|pages=|date=1954-03-04|url=http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_LATimes_SciNL_1954.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[Donald Keyhoe]], later director of the [[National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena]] (NICAP), the real reason for the sudden search was because two near-Earth orbiting objects had been picked up on new long-range radar in the summer of 1953, according to his [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] source.

By May 1954, Keyhoe was making public statements that his sources told him the search had indeed been successful, and either one or two objects had been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=1 or 2 Artificial Satellites Circling Earth, Says Expert|newspaper=San Francisco Examiner|pages=14|date=1954-05-14|url=http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_Keyhoe_May1954.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the story did not break until August 23, 1954, when ''[[Aviation Week]]'' magazine stated that two satellites had been found only 400 and 600 miles out. They were termed &quot;natural satellites&quot; and implied that they had been recently captured, despite this being a virtual impossibility. The next day, the story was in many major newspapers. Dr. LaPaz was implicated in the discovery in addition to Tombaugh. LaPaz had earlier conducted secret investigations on behalf of the Air Force on the [[green fireballs]] and other unidentified aerial phenomena over New Mexico. LaPaz vehemently denied his involvement in the search, although the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported on August 29 that a source close to the project said that the story was true and LaPaz was indeed involved, in fact had been the one to spot and identify the objects as natural rather than artificial satellites. The same source denied the search had anything to do with [[flying saucers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Earth 'Satellites' Spur Army Study|newspaper=New York Times|pages=35|date=1954-08-29|url=http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_NYTIMES_1954.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, both LaPaz and Tombaugh were to issue public denials that anything had been found. The October 1955 issue of [[Popular Mechanics]] magazine reported: ''&quot;Professor Tombaugh is closemouthed about his results. He won't say whether or not any small natural satellites have been discovered.  He does say, however, that newspaper reports of 18 months ago announcing the discovery of natural satellites at 400 and 600 miles out are not correct. He adds that there is no connection between the search program and the reports of so-called flying saucers.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Stimson, Jr.|first=Thomas E.|title=He Spies on Satellites|newspaper=Popular Mechanics|pages=106|date=October 1955|url=http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_PopMech_Oct55.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meteor conference in Los Angeles in 1957, Tombaugh reiterated that his four year search for &quot;natural satellites&quot; had been unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1957-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Tombaugh was to issue a final report stating that nothing had been found in his search. His personal 16-inch [[telescope]] was reassembled and dedicated on September 17, 2009 at [[Animas, New Mexico|Rancho Hidalgo, New Mexico (near Animas, New Mexico]], adjacent to ''Astronomy'' 's new observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=''[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]]'' (&quot;Editors dedicate... new observatory&quot;)|author=David J.

'''CPAN''', the '''Comprehensive Perl Archive Network''', is an archive of over 90,000 [[modular programming|modules of software]] written in [[Perl]], as well as documentation for it.&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=perl.org CPAN page|url=http://www.perl.org/cpan.html|accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a presence on the [[World Wide Web]] at [http://www.cpan.org/ www.cpan.org] and is [[mirror (computing)|mirrored]] worldwide at more than 200 locations.&lt;ref name=&quot;mirror&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mirrors.cpan.org/|accessdate=2009-05-15|title=CPAN Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''CPAN'' can denote either the archive network itself, or the Perl program that acts as an interface to the network and as an automated software installer (somewhat like a [[package manager]]). Most software on CPAN is [[free and open source software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html#How_is_Perl_licensed
|title=How are Perl and the CPAN modules licensed?
|quote=Most, though not all, modules on CPAN are licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) or the Artistic license...
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modules==

Like many [[programming language]]s, Perl has mechanisms to use external [[library (computing)|libraries]] of code, making one file contain common routines used by several programs.  Perl calls these ''modules''.  [[Perl module]]s are typically installed in one of several [[directory (file systems)|directories]] whose [[path (computing)|paths]] are placed in the Perl [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] when it is first [[compiler|compiled]]; on [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s, common paths include ''/usr/lib/perl5'', ''/usr/local/lib/perl5'', and several of their subdirectories.

Perl comes with a small set of ''core modules''.  Some of these perform bootstrapping tasks, such as [[ExtUtils::MakeMaker]], which is used for building and installing other extension modules; others, like [[CGI.pm]], are merely commonly-used.  The authors of Perl do not expect this limited group to meet every need, however.

==Role==

The CPAN's main purpose is to help programmers locate modules and programs not included in the Perl standard distribution.  It structure is decentralized. Authors maintain and improve their own modules. Forking, and creating competing modules for the same task or purpose is common. There is no formal bug tracking system, but there is a 3rd party bug tracking system that CPAN designated as the suggested official method of reporting issues with modules. Continuous development on modules is rare, many are abandoned by their authors, or go years between new versions being released. Sometimes a maintainer will be appointed to an abandoned module. They can release new versions of the module, and accept patches from the community to the module as their time permits. CPAN has no [[revision control system]]. It is also used to distribute new versions of Perl, as well as related projects, such as [[Parrot virtual machine|Parrot]].

The CPAN is an important resource for the professional Perl programmer. With over 18,000 modules (containing 20,000,000 lines of code) as of October 2009, the CPAN can save programmers weeks of time, and large Perl programs often make use of dozens of modules. Some of them, such as the [[Perl DBI|DBI]] family of modules used for interfacing with [[SQL]] [[database]]s, are nearly irreplaceable in their area of function; others, such as the [[List::Util]] module, are simply handy resources containing a few common functions.

==Structure==
Files on the CPAN are referred to as ''distributions''. A distribution may consist of one or more modules, documentation files, or programs packaged in a common archiving format, such as a [[gzip]]ped [[tar file format|tar]] archive or a [[PKWARE]] [[ZIP file format|ZIP]] file. Distributions will often contain installation scripts (usually called ''Makefile.PL'' or ''Build.PL'') and test scripts which can be run to verify the contents of the distribution are functioning properly. New distributions are uploaded to the Perl Authors Upload Server, or PAUSE (see the section [[#Uploading distributions with PAUSE|Uploading distributions with PAUSE]]).

In 2003 distributions started to include metadata files, called ''META.yml'', indicating the distribution's name, version, dependencies, and other useful information; however, not all distributions contain metadata. When metadata is not present in a distribution, the PAUSE's software will usually try to analyze the code in the distribution to look for the same information; this is not necessarily very reliable.

With thousands of distributions, CPAN needs to be structured to be useful. Distributions on the CPAN are divided into 24 broad ''chapters'' based on their purpose, such as ''[[Internationalization]] and [[Locale]]''; ''[[Archiving]], [[data compression|Compression]], And [[data conversion|Conversion]]''; and ''[[Mail]] and [[Usenet]] News''. Distributions can also be browsed by author. Finally, the natural hierarchy of Perl module names (such as &quot;Apache::DBI&quot; or &quot;Lingua::EN::Inflect&quot;) can sometimes be used to browse modules in the CPAN.

CPAN module distributions usually have names in the form of ''CGI-Application-3.1'' (where the '''::''' used in the module's name has been replaced with a dash, and the version number has been appended to the name), but this is only a convention; many prominent distributions break the convention, especially those that contain multiple modules. Security restrictions prevent a distribution from ever being replaced, so virtually all distribution names do include a [[version number]].

==Components==
===Mirrors===

The heart of CPAN is its worldwide network of  more than 260 mirrors in more than 60 countries.&lt;ref name=mirror/&gt; CPAN's master site, ftp.funet.fi, has over 149 direct public mirrors.  Each site contains up to the full 3.9 [[gigabyte]]s of data, or a subset of it if the mirror's maintainer wishes to selectively choose.&lt;ref name=home/&gt;

Most mirrors update themselves hourly, daily or bidaily from the CPAN master site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.uu.nl/stats/mirmon/cpan.html|title=CPAN Status and Statistics|accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some sites are major FTP servers which mirror lots of other software, but others are simply servers owned by companies that use Perl heavily. There are at least two mirrors on every continent except Antarctica.

For more information on CPAN mirrors, see [http://mirrors.cpan.org/ mirrors.cpan.org].

===Search engines===
&lt;!-- [[Lua (programming language)]] links here. --&gt;

Several search engines have been written to help Perl programmers sort through the CPAN.  The most popular and official is [http://search.cpan.org/ search.cpan.org], which includes textual search, a browsable index of modules, and extracted copies of all distributions currently on the CPAN.  Other CPAN search engines that have been set up are:
*[http://kobesearch.cpan.org/ kobesearch.cpan.org] [[Randy Kobes]]' search engine (linked to by cpan.org)
*[http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/htdocs/faqs/cpan-search.html cpan.uwinnipeg.ca]
*[http://cpantools.com/ cpantools.com] CPAN suggest as you type

===Testers===

CPAN Testers are a group of volunteers, who will download and test distributions as they are uploaded to CPAN. This enables the authors to have their modules tested on many platforms and environments that they would otherwise not have access to, thus helping to promote portability, as well as a degree of quality. Smoke testers send reports, which are then collated and used for a variety of presentation websites, including the main reports site, statistics and dependencies.
*[http://www.cpantesters.org/ CPAN Testers Reports] co-ordinates and collects testing results for all CPAN uploads on various platforms.
*[http://stats.cpantesters.org CPAN Testers Statistics] provides statistical analysis and monitoring of the CPAN Testing infrastructure.
*[http://wiki.cpantesters.org CPAN Testers Wiki] contains useful help and advice for getting started as a smoke tester, as well as planning for CPAN Testers 2.0
*[http://deps.cpantesters.org/ CPAN Dependencies], which combines data from META.yml files and the CPAN testers to graphically show a module's dependencies and attempt to calculate how likely it is to work on a particular platform.
*[http://devel.cpantesters.org/ CPAN Testers Development] contains the links to all the supporting tools, data and source that are used to maintain the CPAN Testers infrastructure.

===Other supporting websites===

A family of other loosely integrated support websites have been created as the CPAN has grown in size and scale. These are created and managed by individual Perl developers, and provide data feeds to each other in various ad-hoc ways.
*[http://cpanratings.perl.org CPANRatings] allows users to write short reviews and rate modules on a 5-star scale
*[http://cpanforum.com CPAN::Forum] is a discussion forum where threads are classified by CPAN distribution
*[http://annocpan.org AnnoCPAN] displays the documentation for all the modules on CPAN, along with user-contributed annotations
*[http://rt.cpan.org rt.cpan.org] is a request tracker for bugs and features, and provide all 20,000 modules with their own ticket queue.
*[http://cpants.dev.zsi.at/ CPANTS], the CPAN Testing Service, evaluates distributions automatically for quality assurance metrics of varying usefulness and assigns them a &quot;[[kwalitee]]&quot; rating.

===CPAN.pm and CPANPLUS===

There is also a Perl core module named CPAN; it's usually differentiated from the repository itself by calling it CPAN.pm.  CPAN.pm is mainly an interactive shell which can be used to search for, download, and install distributions.  An interactive shell called &lt;tt&gt;cpan&lt;/tt&gt; is also provided in the Perl core, and is the usual way of running CPAN.pm. After a short configuration process and mirror selection, it uses tools available on the user's computer to automatically download, unpack, compile, test, and install modules.  It is also capable of updating itself.

More recently, an effort to replace CPAN.pm with something cleaner and more modern has resulted in the CPANPLUS or CPAN++ set of modules.  CPANPLUS separates the back-end work of downloading, compiling, and installing modules from the interactive shell used to issue commands.  It also supports several advanced features, such as cryptographic signature checking and test result reporting.  Finally, CPANPLUS can uninstall a distribution.  CPANPLUS was added to the Perl core in version 5.10.0.

Both modules can check a distribution's [[coupling (computer science)|dependencies]] and can be set to recursively install any [[prerequisite]]s, either automatically or with individual user approval.  Both support FTP and HTTP and can work through firewalls and proxies.

===Uploading distributions with PAUSE===

Authors can upload new distributions to the CPAN through the ''Perl Authors Upload Server'' ([http://pause.perl.org/pause/query PAUSE]).  To do so, they must [https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=request_id request a PAUSE account].  Registration information can be found at the [https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_04about#registering PAUSE faq]

Registrations are manually reviewed, so the process may take a week or longer.

Once registered, the new PAUSE account has a directory in the CPAN under ''authors/id/(first letter)/(first two letters)/(author ID)''.  They may use a web interface at [https://pause.perl.org pause.perl.org], or the PAUSE ftp server to upload files to their directory and delete them.  PAUSE will warn an administrator if a user uploads a module that already exists, unless they are listed as a ''co-maintainer''.  This can be specified through PAUSE's web interface.

==Influence==

Experienced Perl programmers often comment that half of Perl's power is in the CPAN. It has been called Perl's [[killer app]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perlmonks.org/bare/?node_id=187498&lt;/ref&gt; Though the [[TeX]] typesetting language has an equivalent, the [[CTAN]] (and in fact the CPAN's name is based on the CTAN), few languages have an exhaustive central repository for libraries. The [[PHP]] language has [[PHP Extension Community Library|PECL]] and [[PHP Extension and Application Repository|PEAR]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] has a [[PyPI]] (Python Package Index) repository, [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] has [[RubyGems]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] has [[LuaRocks]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] has [[Hackage]] and an associated installer/make clone [[Cabal (software)|cabal]]; but none of these are as large as the CPAN.  Other major languages, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C++]], have nothing similar to the CPAN (though for Java there is central [[Apache Maven|Maven]] , and C++ has the [[Boost C++ Libraries]]).

The CPAN has grown so large and comprehensive over the years that many people learning Perl seem to elevate it to a sort of mythical status, and express surprise when they begin to encounter topics for which a CPAN module ''doesn't'' exist already.

The CPAN's influence on Perl's eclectic culture should not be underestimated either.  As a hive of activity in the Perl world, the CPAN both shapes and is shaped by Perl culture.  Its &quot;self-appointed master librarian&quot;, [[Jarkko Hietaniemi]], often takes part in the [[April Fools Day]] jokes so popular on the Internet; on 1 April 2002 the site was temporarily named to ''CJAN'', where the &quot;J&quot; stood for &quot;Java&quot;.  In 2003, the [http://www.cpan.org www.cpan.org] domain name was redirected to [[Matt's Script Archive]], a site infamous in the Perl community for having badly-written code.{{cite}}

Beyond April Fools', however, some of the distributions on the CPAN are jokes in themselves.  The [[Acme Corporation|Acme]]:: hierarchy is reserved for joke modules; for instance, Acme::Don't adds a &lt;code&gt;don't&lt;/code&gt; function that doesn't run the code given to it (to complement the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; built-in, which does).  Even outside the Acme:: hierarchy, some modules are still written largely for amusement; one example is Lingua::Romana::Perligata, which can be used to write Perl programs in a subset of Latin.

===Derivative works===

In 2005, a group of Perl developers who also had an interest in JavaScript got together to create [[JSAN]], the JavaScript Archive Network. The JSAN is a near-direct port of the CPAN infrastructure for use with the JavaScript language, which for most of its lifespan did not have a cohesive &quot;community&quot;.

In 2008, after a chance meeting with CPAN admin [[Adam Kennedy (programmer)|Adam Kennedy]] at the Open Source Developers Conference, Linux kernel developer [[Rusty Russell]] created the [http://ccan.ozlabs.org CCAN], the Comprehensive C Archive Network. The CCAN is a direct port of the CPAN architecture for use with the C language.

===Oddities===

Over the years, the CPAN has had a range of unusual non-Perl things uploaded to it. Here are a few examples.
* DBD::SQLite - The full [[C (programming language)|C]] code for the [[SQLite]] database, along with a Perl database driver for SQLite.
* PITA::Test::Image::Qemu - A fully working (if small) [[Linux]] distribution.
* Religion::Islam::Quran - The full Muslim holy book, the [[Quran]], in 5 different languages; to support a search engine for religious text.

Established in 1991, they started play in [[1993 Colorado Rockies season|1993]] and are in the [[National League West|West Division]] of the [[National League]]. The team is named after the Colorado [[Rocky Mountains]]. The Rockies play their home games at [[Coors Field]] in downtown Denver.

Following multiple losing seasons, the Rockies won the [[National League Championship Series|National League pennant]] for the first time in franchise history during the [[2007 Colorado Rockies season|2007 season]].

==History==
===Creation of the Rockies===
After previous failed attempts to bring the Major League Baseball to Colorado (most notably the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] nearly relocating to Denver following the [[Pittsburgh drug trials]] in 1985), by the late 1980s a team seemed to be a possibility in Denver. The Colorado Baseball Commission, led by banking executive Larry Varnell, was successful in getting Denver voters to approve a 0.1 percent sales tax to help finance a new baseball stadium. Also, an advisory committee was formed in 1990 by then-Governor of Colorado [[Roy Romer]] to recruit an ownership group. The group selected was led by John Antonucci, an Ohio beverage distributor, and [[Michael I. Monus]], the head of the [[Phar-Mor]] drugstore chain. Local and regional companies—such as Erie Lake, Hensel Phelps Construction, [[KOA (AM)|KOA Radio]], and the [[Rocky Mountain News]]—rounded out the group. On July 5, 1991, the National League approved Denver and [[Miami]], [[Florida]], as the sites for two expansion teams to begin play in 1993.

The Rockies joined the National League in 1993, along with the Southern Florida franchise, the [[Florida Marlins]]. The Rockies' first pick in the [[1992 MLB Expansion Draft|expansion draft]] was pitcher [[David Nied]] from the [[Atlanta Braves]] organization. Nied pitched 4 seasons for the Rockies.

===Inaugural season===
{{main|1993 Colorado Rockies season}}

The first game in Rockies history was played on April 5, 1993, against the [[1993 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] at [[Shea Stadium]]. [[David Nied]] was the starting pitcher in a game the Rockies lost, 3–0. The franchise's first home game at [[Mile High Stadium]], and first win in franchise history, came four days later with an 11–4 win over the [[1993 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]]. One of the most memorable plays in the game, and in team history, occurred in the bottom of the first inning when 2nd baseman, [[Eric Young (baseball player)|Eric Young]] of the Rockies hit a [[Leadoff hitter|leadoff]] [[home run]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070721&amp;content_id=2101421&amp;vkey=news_col&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=col The Official Site of The Colorado Rockies: News: Colorado Rockies News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The game was played before 80,227 fans, to date the largest crowd to see a single regular-season Major League Baseball game.&lt;ref&gt;http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070721&amp;content_id=2101421&amp;vkey=news_col&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=col&lt;/ref&gt;

As is the case with many expansion teams, the Rockies struggled in their first year. During one stretch in May, the team went 2–17. The team did not experience its first winning month until September, when they went 17–9. Still, the team finished the season with 67 wins, setting a record for a National League expansion franchise. In addition, despite the losses, the club saw a home attendance of 4,483,350 for the season, setting a Major League record that still stands and isn't likely to be broken. Rockies first baseman [[Andrés Galarraga]] won the batting title after hitting .370 for the season after Manager [[Don Baylor]] persuaded Galarraga to change from a standard batting stance into an open one in which he squarely faced the pitcher, allowing him to see incoming pitches properly.

===Ownership issues===
After a 1992 accounting and [[embezzlement]] scandal at Phar-Mor tarnished the reputation of Monus, both Monus and Antonucci were forced to sell their stakes in the franchise. Trucking-company executive Jerry McMorris became head of the ownership group and served as the initial public face of management. His relationship with the other partners was somewhat poor, and his role in the leadership of the franchise diminished over time, until he was finally bought out in 2005 (his situation was not helped by the 1999 failure of his trucking firm and subsequent related legal issues.

The team is currently controlled by chief executive officer Charlie Monfort (a former executive with his family's beef-exporting firm and also with [[ConAgra]]), and his brother Dick Monfort, who both bought out McMorris' stake.

===The mid-1990s===
{{main|1994 Colorado Rockies season}}

On April 17, 1994, the Rockies beat [[1994 Montreal Expos season|Montreal]] 6–5, moving the team's record to 6–5—the first time in franchise history that the club had a winning record. However, that would be the only time during that season that the club would have a record over .500, finishing at 53–64 and in last place in the National League West in the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] [[1994 Major League Baseball season|season]]. Despite the club's poor record, several Rockies hitters gained notoriety for their exploits at the plate, assisted by the thin and dry air of Denver, which purportedly allows balls to carry farther than they would at sea-level ballparks. Andres Galarraga, a year after winning the batting title, hit 31 homers, and teammate [[Dante Bichette]] hit 27; projected over a 162-game season, the two would have hit 43 and 37 homers, respectively. The park's characteristics did not affect just home runs either: 33-year-old outfielder [[Mike Kingery]], a career .252 hitter who did not play in the majors in 1993, batted .349 in 301 at-bats. Gallaraga, Bichette, Castilla and Kingery appeared on a T-Shirt as the original group known as the &quot;Blake Street Bombers&quot;. The club once again led the majors in attendance, drawing 3,281,511 fans for the season.  Had it not been for the strike that ended the season, they may have broken their own season attendance record, as they were on a pace to do just that.

====1995 playoff run and the opening of Coors Field====
{{main|1995 Colorado Rockies season}}

Prior to the 1995 season, the Rockies acquired free-agent outfielder [[Larry Walker]], previously of the [[Montreal Expos]], who replaced Kingery as the 4th member of the &quot;Blake Street Bombers&quot;—named after the street on which the new ballpark ([[Coors Field]]) was located—along with Galarraga, Bichette, and third baseman [[Vinny Castilla]], who had played sparingly with the major-league club during the previous season. The quartet combined to hit 139 homers in the [[1995 Major League Baseball season|1995 season]], with Bichette leading the way with 40. The team debuted in its new ballpark on April 26, 1995, in an 11–9 win over the [[1995 New York Mets season|New York Mets]], and proceeded to win seven of their first eight games in the new season. The season ended with a 77–67 record, good for second place in the West division and the club's first playoff appearance as the Wild Card winner. Although much of the attention focused on the power-hitting lineup, much of the club's success was due to a strong bullpen, as relievers [[Darren Holmes (baseball)|Darren Holmes]], [[Curt Leskanic]], [[Steve Reed (baseball)|Steve Reed]], and [[Bruce Ruffin (baseball player)|Bruce Ruffin]] all posted earned-run averages below 3.40. The pitching staff's ERA of 4.97 was the lowest in club history until the 2006 team had a 4.66 ERA. The Rockies lost in the [[1995 National League Division Series|NLDS]] to the eventual [[1995 World Series]] champion [[1995 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]], 3 games to 1. The Rockies once again led the league in attendance for the season.

====Post-1995====
In 1996, with all four Blake Street Bombers returning, the Rockies expected to contend, but an injury to Walker hurt the team. Walker played in only 83 games and batted .276 with 18 homers. However, outfielder [[Ellis Burks]] picked up the slack with an All-Star season, batting .344 with 40 homers and 128 RBI—one of three Rockies to hit forty or more homers that season, along with Galarraga and Castilla. The team set a major-league record by scoring 658 runs at home on the season, and Burks and Bichette became the first pair of teammates since [[Darryl Strawberry]] and [[Howard Johnson (baseball)|Howard Johnson]] of the 1987 [[New York Mets]] to both steal 30 bases and hit 30 homers in the same season. However, the pitching staff—a strong point for the team in 1995—was beset by injuries: [[Bill Swift]], who went 9–3 in 1995, started just three games, and the staff ERA ballooned to 5.60. As a result, the Rockies fell back to third place in the West with an 83–79 record.

A healthy Walker became the first player in club history to win the NL [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] award in 1997, batting .366 with 49 homers and 130 RBI. Walker came very close to winning the Triple Crown that year, leading the league in home runs but finishing second to [[Tony Gwynn]] in batting average and third in RBI (teammate Galarraga led the league.) Once again, three Rockies (Walker, Galarraga, and Castilla) hit 40 or more homers; Walker also won the first [[Gold Glove]] in franchise history. As in 1996, though, the team's pitchers struggled and had a 5.25 ERA, and the Rockies could not improve upon their finish from the previous season.

===The beginning of the Helton era===

[[Image:Coloradorockies.JPG|220px|thumb|left|Colorado Rockies celebrate their second straight victory against the [[New York Yankees]] in [[Coors Field]] on June 19, 2007.]]
The Rockies were broken up after the 1997 season when an aging Galarraga signed with the [[Atlanta Braves]] as a free agent. His replacement was [[Todd Helton]], who had been the club's first-round draft pick in 1995 out of the [[University of Tennessee]]. After a 4–1 start, the club lost its next eight games and struggled to a 77–85 record, finishing only ahead of the expansion [[1998 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona Diamondbacks]] in the NL West. Pitcher [[Darryl Kile]], signed as a free agent in the offseason, struggled in Colorado, going 13–17 with a 5.20 ERA—a far cry from his numbers the prior year as a member of the [[Houston Astros]], when he went 19–7 with a 2.57 ERA. Kile would become one of a long line of free-agent pitchers who struggled after signing with the Rockies. The team's struggles led to the firing of manager [[Don Baylor]], the only manager in franchise history, following the season.

[[Jim Leyland]], a two-time NL [[Manager of the Year]] who had won the [[1997 World Series|World Series]] with the [[Florida Marlins]] two years earlier, was expected to bring the Rockies back into contention in [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999]]. Instead, the Rockies dropped even further, finishing 72–90 and in last place in the West as the [[1999 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Diamondbacks]] won the division in just their second year of existence. Helton was blossoming into a young developed hitter, batting .320 with 35 homers and 113 RBI; Castilla, Walker, and Bichette also hit more than 30 homers each. Once again, though, the team's pitching was a glaring weakness, as the staff had an ERA of 6.02. Kile, who was being paid over $8 million for the season, struggled mightily, going 8–13 with a 6.61 ERA, and he wound up being traded to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] following the season. Interestingly, Kile would go on to finish fifth in voting for the [[Cy Young Award]] the following year, as he had in 1997 (the year before he joined the Rockies). The Leyland era lasted just one year, as a frustrated Leyland retired following the season, not to manage in the majors again until 2006, when he won an AL Pennant with the [[Detroit Tigers]].

On April 4, 1999, the Rockies made history as they played their [[Opening Day]] game against the defending National League champion [[1999 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]] at [[Estadio de Beisbol Monterrey]] in [[Monterrey]], Mexico – marking the first time Major League Baseball opened the regular season outside the United States or Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pressbox.mlb.com/pressbox/events/opening_day.jsp?content=od_facts The Official Site of Major League Baseball: Events: Opening Day&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/notebook?page=bbtn ESPN – Baseball Tonight Clubhouse: Looking Up – MLB&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E6D81139F936A35757C0A96F958260 | work=The New York Times | title=BASEBALL; Bichette and Castilla Spark Rockies in Opener in Mexico | date=April 5, 1999 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colorado beat San Diego, 8–2, in front of a crowd of 27,104 people. Only a little over 2 weeks later, the [[Columbine High School massacre]] postponed a home game with the [[Montreal Expos]] (it was made up as part of a doubleheader in August).

===The Dan O'Dowd era===

On August 20, 1999, [[Bob Gebhard]], the only general manager in franchise history, announced his resignation. A month later, the Rockies named [[Dan O'Dowd]] as his replacement. After hiring [[Buddy Bell]] as the club's third manager, O'Dowd proceeded to make a series of offseason deals that would change the face of the franchise. Popular outfielder [[Dante Bichette]] was traded to the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. Later, he traded Kile to the Cardinals and, in a four-team trade, sent [[Vinny Castilla]] to the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]]. With those two deals, [[Larry Walker]] remained as the only player of the Blake Street Bombers still with the team. Walker wound up playing in only 87 games in 2000 due to injuries and hit just nine homers, as the Rockies had a completely different look from prior years. Perhaps not surprisingly given the injury to Walker and the trading of two of the team's most popular players, the Rockies finished third in the National League in attendance in 2000, marking the first time in club history that it did not lead the league in attendance.

Despite the major changes made to the team in the offseason, the team wound up with its first winning season since 1997. Helton, in his third full year in the majors, was becoming a bona fide superstar, winning the batting title with a .372 average and also leading the league with 147 RBI while hitting 42 homers. However, he finished just fifth in MVP voting, perhaps because the team finished fourth in the division and also possibly due to bias by voters because he played half of his games in hitter-friendly [[Coors Field]]. 2000 also marked the first of five consecutive [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] appearances for Helton. The pitching staff also improved its ERA to 5.26, helping the team to an 82–80 record.

Although previous big-name pitchers, including [[Bill Swift]], [[Bret Saberhagen]], and [[Darryl Kile]], had struggled in Colorado, following the 2000 season O'Dowd made two very splashy signings in the free-agent market, signing [[Denny Neagle]] to a five-year contract worth $51 million, followed five days later by signing [[Mike Hampton]] to an eight-year, $121 million contract. Two years earlier, Hampton had won 22 games and finished second in voting for the [[Cy Young Award]] as a member of the [[Houston Astros]], while Neagle had been a 20-game winner in 1997 for the [[Atlanta Braves]] and had won fifteen games in 2000. The two star pitchers were expected by the Rockies to change the team's fortunes.

Instead, the two flopped, much as their predecessors had. Hampton, after a strong first half in 2001, completely fell apart in 2002, going 7–15 with a 6.15 ERA and demanding a trade following the season. Neagle went 19–23 in three years with the Rockies; he was injured in 2003 and never pitched in the majors again before the Rockies released him after the 2004 season. The Rockies went 73–89 in both years that Hampton and Neagle were in Colorado, and the amount of money owed them (the Rockies paid a sizable portion of Hampton's salary even after he was traded to the Atlanta Braves) crippled the team for the next several years.

Under previous general manager Gebhard, the Rockies had largely neglected their farm system and mostly relied on signing veteran free agents from other clubs; this was possible due to the high attendance numbers in the club's first few years of attendance. However, as attendance began to dwindle—the Rockies fell to just sixth in the National League in attendance in 2002, and ninth in 2003 and 2004—the club could no longer afford to build through big-name free agents. In 1999, the Rockies spent their first-round draft pick on [[Baylor University]] pitcher [[Jason Jennings]]; three years later, Jennings went 16–8 with a 4.52 ERA. In the process, Jennings became the first Rockies player to win the National League [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award.

With Hampton out of town and Neagle injured much of the year, Jennings became the centerpiece of the Rockies' pitching staff in 2003. Despite a fourth straight All-Star season by Helton and 36 homers by outfielder [[Preston Wilson]], the Rockies finished just 74–88. In addition to Jennings, though, young pitchers [[Shawn Chacon]] and [[Aaron Cook (baseball)|Aaron Cook]] showed promise.

In 2004, the Rockies acquired [[Vinny Castilla]], who had been with the club for its inaugural 1993 season, once again, and he hit 35 homers. However, Wilson and [[Larry Walker]] spent much of the season on the disabled list, forcing the Rockies to play [[Matt Holliday]], who had been slated to start the season at Triple-A. While the Rockies struggled to a 68–94 record—the second worst record in club history—the club's Triple-A affiliate, the [[Colorado Springs Sky Sox]], went 78–65. Declining attendance meant that the club's payroll could no longer support a franchise stocked largely with veterans from other clubs. In addition, Walker, who had been with the team since 1995 and was widely regarded as the best player in team history, was now 37 years old, and injuries prevented him from playing much of the time. Because he could still be useful to a contending team, the Rockies traded him to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in August for three minor-leaguers.

===Generation-R===
[[Image:ColoradoRockies01.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Clint Hurdle]] making a pitching change.]]
[[Image:Rockiescelebratewin.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Colorado Rockies on June 19, 2007 in Coors Field.]]
The trade of Walker set in motion a series of moves that would lead to a complete overhaul of the club's roster. Castilla and [[Jeromy Burnitz]], who led the team with 37 homers in 2004, were allowed to leave as free agents following the season. Catcher [[Charles Johnson (catcher)|Charles Johnson]], who had been acquired along with Wilson in the Hampton trade, was traded to the [[Boston Red Sox]]. [[Royce Clayton]], the club's starting shortstop in 2004, also was allowed to leave. Along with Holliday, who had performed ably while Wilson and Walker were out, the club promoted [[Garrett Atkins]], [[Brad Hawpe]], [[Clint Barmes]], and [[J.D. Closser]], who spent most of 2004 in Triple-A. Jennings and Chacon combined with [[Joe Kennedy (baseball player)|Joe Kennedy]], [[Byung-Hyun Kim]], and top prospect [[Jeff Francis]] to form the team's starting rotation. Other than Helton and Wilson, virtually all of the team's regular players were under the age of 30; the Rockies dubbed this group &quot;Generation-R.&quot;

====2005 season====
{{Main|2005 Colorado Rockies season}}
The result of all the moves was a 67–95 record in [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], which tied for the worst record in franchise history, as the young players—many of whom had never been everyday players in the majors prior to that season—struggled. Helton and Wilson—virtually the only experienced players on the team—struggled as well; Helton hit just 20 homers, the fewest of his career, and missed the All-Star Game for the first time since 1999 and also went on the disabled list for the first time in his career. Wilson also spent time on the disabled list and, as the Rockies fell out of contention, was traded to the [[Washington Nationals]]. After starting the season 15–35, though, the team had some success later in the year, going a respectable 30–28 in August and September as the youngsters became more experienced. However, perhaps because of the trade of Walker and several consecutive losing seasons, the team fell all the way to fourteenth in the National League in attendance; for the first time in team history, the Rockies drew under 2 million fans for the season.

====2006 season====
{{Main|2006 Colorado Rockies season}}
The [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006 season]] started with some promise; the Rockies were 44–43 in the first half of the season and were in contention in the NL West for much of the season. However, the team faded in the second half and wound up at 76–86, tied for fourth place in the division. Despite this, several of the young players showed promise. [[Matt Holliday]] hit 34 homers and was named to the [[2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]; [[Garrett Atkins]] batted .329 and hit 29 homers. In addition, the pitching staff posted a 4.66 ERA—the best in team history—and starters [[Jason Jennings]], [[Aaron Cook (baseball)|Aaron Cook]], and [[Jeff Francis]] had good seasons.

====2007: &quot;Rocktober&quot; – A World Series berth====
{{Main|2007 Colorado Rockies season}}
The Rockies trailed the [[2007 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]], the [[2007 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona Diamondbacks]] and the [[2007 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]] for most of [[2007 Major League Baseball season]] – however – by August, Colorado showed a steady series of wins, while the Division-leading Dodgers began to struggle.

By September, the Dodgers were eliminated by the Rockies from playoff contention, and the Diamondbacks were expected to clinch the [[National League West]] division title. The Padres held a steady lead on the [[National League]] [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] spot. The Diamondbacks eventually clinched the NL West division title, but the Rockies shot up with one of the greatest comebacks in baseball history. They were a major-league best 20–8 in September, after trailing 6 games on September 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colorado.rockies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070930&amp;content_id=2240736&amp;vkey=news_col&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=col The Official Site of The Colorado Rockies: News: Rockies month-by-month recap&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/preview?gid=271001127&amp;prov=ap Padres-Rockies Preview – MLB – Yahoo!

The two most puzzling omissions were [[first baseman]] [[Todd Helton]] and [[shortstop]] [[Troy Tulowitzki]]. Both players had a better fielding percentage, more total chances, better zone rating, more putouts, more double plays turned, better range factor and more assists than their counterparts who won the award instead ([[Chicago Cubs]] first baseman [[Derrek Lee]] and [[Philadelphia Phillies]] shortstop [[Jimmy Rollins]]). Helton also had fewer errors (2) than Lee (7), while Tulowitzki had as many errors as Rollins (11), but did so on 834 total chances compared to Rollins' 717.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/stats/fielding?groupId=8&amp;season=2007&amp;seasonType=2&amp;split=82&amp;sortColumn=fieldingPct ESPN – MLB Baseball Fielding Statistics and League Leaders – Major League Baseball&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the Rockies' remarkable September run, the team finished the regular season tied with the Padres for the National League [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] spot in the playoffs. The two teams played a [[2007 National League wild card tie-breaker game|wild card tie-breaker game]] at [[Coors Field]] on October 1 to determine the wild card. A Colorado home run was called back early in the game despite the fact that it clearly cleared the fence, hit a chair, and bounced back onto the field. The game lasted 13 innings, and although the Padres got two runs off of a [[Scott Hairston]] [[home run]] in the top of the 13th inning to break a 6–6 tie, the Rockies came back in the bottom of the 13th by scoring three runs off of [[closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Trevor Hoffman]] to win 9–8.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=271001127 ESPN – Padres vs. Rockies – Recap – October 01, 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://colorado.rockies.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20071001&amp;content_id=2244506&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=col The Official Site of The Colorado Rockies: News: Colorado Rockies News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Second baseman]] [[Kazuo Matsui]] started off the inning by hitting a double. Tulowitzki followed with a double of his own, thus, allowing Matsui to score. [[Left fielder]] [[Matt Holliday]] then came up to bat and hit a triple, scoring Tulowitzki. After an intentional walk to Helton, the Padres pitched to [[utility infielder]] [[Jamey Carroll]], who then hit a [[sacrifice fly]], allowing Holliday to score from third base. Holliday's winning run came off of a controversial slide in which home plate umpire [[Tim McClelland]] called Holliday safe, despite replays showing Holliday may have never touched the plate. McClelland educated the media and fans after the game as to the call: Padres catcher Michael Barrett  blocked the plate before securing possession of the ball, resulting in an automatic ruling of safe and making Holliday's apparent failure to touch the plate irrelevant. The Rockies completed the fifth greatest [[List of baseball jargon (R)#regular season|regular season]] comeback in Major League Baseball history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nate Silver]], &quot;The Greatest Pennant Race Comebacks,&quot; [http://baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=6793 BaseballProspectus.com], October 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Playoffs=====
With the win, the Rockies made the playoffs for the first time since 1995, and went on to face the [[2007 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] in the [[2007 National League Division Series|NLDS]]. Colorado won the first game in Philadelphia, 4–2. The Rockies also won the second game in Philadelphia, 10–5, with the help of [[Kazuo Matsui]]'s 4th inning [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]]. On October 6, 2007, the Rockies completed a three-game sweep of the Phillies by winning 2–1 in Colorado. The three-game sweep was Colorado's first post-season series win in team history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=271006127 ESPN – Phillies vs. Rockies – Recap – October 06, 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Rockies went on to play in the [[2007 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] against the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], who swept their own NLDS against the [[Chicago Cubs]]. Colorado won the first two games of the NLCS against the Diamondbacks in Phoenix, then won their third game against the Diamondbacks in Denver on Sunday, October 14. That pushed the Rockies' combined late-season (September 16 and after) and post-season run to 20 wins and just 1 loss, the single loss coming against Arizona on September 28, 2007 – the 160th game of the regular season. This made Colorado only the third team in the last half-century, and the first in the National League since the [[1936 New York Giants (MLB) season|1936 New York Giants]], to have a 20–1 stretch at any point of a season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2007/columns/story?columnist=stark_jayson&amp;id=3064010 |title=Rockies ride Torrealba's blast to yet another victory |first=Jayson |last=Stark |authorlink=Jayson Stark |publisher=ESPN.com |date=2007-10-14 |accessdate=2007-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth game of the NLCS was won by the Rockies by a score of 6–4, completing a four-game sweep of Arizona. Holliday was named the NLCS MVP, as he hit .333 with two home runs and four RBIs during the series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2007/news/story?id=3065615 ESPN – Rockies receive many contributions, but Holliday tops – MLB&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The NLCS sweep earned the Rockies their first National League pennant in franchise history. The Rockies became the first team ever to sweep both the division series and league championship series in the same postseason. The club moved to 21–1 over all games played after September 15. By then, the amazing streak of wins became known among fans as &quot;Rocktober&quot;. In the [[2007 World Series]], the Rockies faced the [[2007 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], and were swept in four games; the first game was 13–1, the second game was 2–1, the third game was 10–5, and the fourth and final game was 4–3. Some attribute the poor play in the World Series to the long lay off from the NLCS. 

''[[Baseball America]]'' named the Colorado Rockies the &quot;Organization of the Year&quot; for their accomplishments during the 2007 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2007/dec/04/2007s-organization-of-the-year/ 2007's organization of the year : Rockies : The Rocky Mountain News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;We knew they were bringing great talent through their farm system, but we certainly didn't expect it to pay off with big-league success so quickly,&quot; said Will Lingo, editor of ''Baseball America''. &quot;They won with homegrown players, have more talent on the way and have maintained stability in their front office, so they had pretty much everything we look for in an organization.&quot;

[[Image:Rockiesplayers.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Some of the starters of the 2008 season: [[Ian Stewart (baseball)|Ian Stewart]], [[Troy Tulowitzki]], [[Garrett Atkins]] and [[Willy Taveras]]]]
The Colorado Rockies began the 2008 season after few offseason changes from the [[National League Championship Series|National League champion]] squad of [[2007 Colorado Rockies season|2007]]. Major losses were all to free agency ([[second baseman]] [[Kaz Matsui]] went to the [[Houston Astros]] and [[pitcher]] [[Josh Fogg]] went to the [[Cincinnati Reds]]). The Rockies season was scheduled to begin on March 31 against the [[2008 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] at St. Louis, however, the game was rescheduled to the next day because of foul weather.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=280331124 ESPN – Rockies vs. Cardinals – Recap – March 31, 2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Colorado began the season on a high note, winning their opener on April 1, in a 2–1 comeback victory over the Cardinals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=280401124 ESPN – Rockies vs. Cardinals – Recap – April 01, 2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 17, 2008, Colorado beat the [[2008 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]], 2–1, in a 22-inning road game that spanned 6 hours and 16 minutes.&lt;ref name=rockiespadres22innings&gt;[http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=280417125 ESPN – Rockies vs. Padres – Recap – April 17, 2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the longest game in Rockies history, in terms of both total innings and total length of time.&lt;ref name=rockiespadres22innings /&gt;  659 total pitches were thrown in the game by 15 different pitchers (eight Rockies pitchers and seven Padres pitchers).&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3353469 ESPN – Weary Rockies hang on vs. Padres in 22nd inning for historic win – MLB&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The 22-inning affair was the longest since August 31, 1993, when the [[1993 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]], at home, defeated the [[1993 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]], 5–4, in 22 innings.&lt;ref name=rockiespadres22innings /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/MIN/MIN199308310.shtml August 31, 1993 Cleveland Indians at Minnesota Twins Box Score and Play by Play – Baseball-Reference.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 2008, Colorado defeated the [[2008 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]], 18–17, after at one point being down, 13–4.

The Rockies ended the season finishing third in the [[National League West]] with a 74–88 record, failing to make the playoffs.  The team got rid of hitting coach [[Alan Cockrell]], third base coach [[Mike Gallego]] and bench coach [[Jamie Quirk]] after the disappointing season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3631604|title=Disappointing season costs three Rockies coaches their jobs|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rockies also traded away [[Matt Holliday]] to the [[Oakland Athletics]] for pitchers [[Huston Street]] and [[Greg Smith (pitcher)|Greg Smith]], and outfielder [[Carlos González (baseball)|Carlos González]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081110&amp;content_id=3673065&amp;vkey=hotstove2008&amp;fext=.jsp Rockies, A's complete Holliday deal]&lt;/ref&gt;

====2009: The Jim Tracy Era and A Return To The Playoffs====
{{Main|2009 Colorado Rockies season}}

[[File:MG 6582 Jason Marquis.jpg|160px |thumb|[[Jason Marquis]]]]
After a poor start (19–28) to the 2009 season, [[Clint Hurdle]] was fired on May 29. His successor as manager is [[Jim Tracy (baseball)|Jim Tracy]], who was originally hired as bench coach for the Colorado Rockies in November 2008. In June 2009, the team rapidly improved and by the end of June, the Rockies set a franchise record for victories in a month with 21 in a 28 game stretch (one win better than the September 2007 Rocktober run).  This improved their record from 20–29 and nine games under .500, to 41–36 and 5 games over .500.  During June, the Rockies led all of major league baseball with 151 total runs.  The Rockies had two players selected to the [[2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]: right fielder [[Brad Hawpe]] and starting pitcher [[Jason Marquis]]. On August 10, [[Troy Tulowitzki]] hit the team's 5th franchise [[hit for the cycle|cycle]].  He became the second player in major league history to hit for the cycle and have an [[unassisted triple play]], which he did on April 29, 2007, in his career. 

On August 24, the Rockies faced the [[San Francisco Giants]] in what ended up being a 14 inning game which lasted close to 5 hours(4:57), the second longest game in Rockies history. After multiple scoreless innings, the Giants managed to score three runs in the top of the 14th to place them ahead of the Rockies, 4–1. After several Colorado at-bats, the bases were loaded and [[Ryan Spilborghs]] stepped up to the plate. Spilborghs hit the first walk-off [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] in Rockies history, his second career grand slam, and his first [[walk-off homer]] in the 14th inning to squeak by the Giants, 6–4, Monday in front of about half of the 27,670 fans who remained at [[Coors Field]].  The play has since been dubbed &quot;SpillySlam&quot;.

This particular win expanded the Rockies' [[Wild card (sports)|Wild Card]] lead to four games over Giants. In an ecstatic interview after the game, [[Jim Tracy (baseball)|Jim Tracy]] stated that he told the Rockies' preceding batter, [[relief pitcher]] [[Adam Eaton]], not to swing:  ''&quot;I don't care if he throws three right down the middle, don't swing because I want Spilborghs to have a shot with the bases loaded.&quot;''  The strategy worked in the Rockies' favor; Eaton [[walk (baseball)|walked]] with the bases loaded, scoring [[Dexter Fowler]] to cut the Giants' lead to 4–2.

Following the win, Colorado hosted [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Los Angeles]] with a chance to pull into a tie for the division lead if they could sweep.  On August 25, the Rockies won 5–4 on another walk-off thanks to Troy Tulowitzki's bases loaded, one out [[Single (baseball)|single]] in the bottom of the 10th. Los Angeles, however, would win the next two games, and with their Wild Card lead down to 3, the Rockies traveled to San Francisco for another 3-game set.  After losing each of the first two games by two runs, the Rockies opened up a 5–2 lead against [[Matt Cain]] in the finale of the series on August 30.  But with two outs and the bases loaded in the 7th, in a scene eerily similar to the Ryan Spilborghs walk-off, [[Edgar Rentería]] hit a go-ahead grand slam off of [[Rafael Betancourt]], propelling the Giants to a 9–5 win and a tie in the Wild Card standings entering September.

Colorado responded by winning 10 of their first 11 games in September, including a 9–1 home stand.  When they returned to San Francisco for their final series with the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] on September 14, the Rockies had once again built a large Wild Card lead.  But as in the previous series, San Francisco won the first two games behind [[Tim Lincecum]] and [[Barry Zito]], cutting the Rockies Wild Card lead to 2.5.  In a pivotal swing game that would either see the Rockies leave San Francisco with a 1.5 game lead or a 3.5 game lead, Colorado once again built a large lead against [[Matt Cain]] in the finale of the series on September 16.  Thanks to 8 brilliant innings from [[Jorge De La Rosa]], and [[home runs]] from [[Troy Tulowitzki]] and [[Ian Stewart (baseball)|Ian Stewart]], the Rockies took a 4–0 lead into the bottom of the 9th.  With closer [[Huston Street]] injured, the Rockies turned to [[Franklin Morales]], but the Giants started the inning with 3 straight hits to pull to within 4–1. [[Rafael Betancourt]] was summoned once again, and induced a [[ground ball]] off [[Juan Uribe]]'s bat.  However, an errant throw by Tulowitzki sailed past [[Clint Barmes]] and into [[right field]], scoring another [[run (baseball)|run]] and putting runners at 1st and 3rd.  Pinch runner [[Eugenio Vélez]] would then steal second base, putting the tying run in scoring position.  In a rematch of their August match-up, Betancourt got [[Edgar Rentería]] to [[pop out]] on the [[infield]] for the first out.  However, [[pinch hitter]] [[Randy Winn]] followed with an RBI [[groundout]], cutting the deficit to 4–3 and moving the tying run to 3rd.  With a full count, [[Betancourt]] struck out [[pinch hitter]] [[Nate Schierholtz]] to secure the [[save (baseball)|save]].

As the Giants began to fade, the [[Atlanta Braves]] started making a run at the Rockies that was starting to look similar to Colorado's 2007 run.  From September 8 through September 28, the Braves won 16 of 19 to pull from nearly 7 back to just 2 back in the season's final week.  It would take a series of dramatic wins for Colorado to hang on to its lead.  On September 25, the Rockies played host to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].  With [[Aaron Cook (baseball)|Aaron Cook]] returning from an injury, the Rockies won 2–1 in the bottom of the 9th on a [[Yorvit Torrealba]] [[sacrifice fly]].  Two days later, the Rockies took a 4–3 lead into the bottom of the 9th.  Back from injury, [[Huston Street]] attempted to close out a two inning save, but got into a jam.  The [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]] put runners on the corners with one out for [[Ryan Ludwick]]. Ludwick flared a flyball into shallow right. Rockies second baseman [[Clint Barmes]], playing in, made a miraculous over the shoulder diving catch after a long run, and doubled off [[Albert Pujols]], who thought the ball would drop and was nearly at third base, to end the game.  Much like the 2007 play-in game when it was not clear whether or not [[Matt Holliday]] had touched [[home plate]] with the game winning run, there was question as to whether Barmes actually caught the ball, as photos later emerged showing the ball apparently sliding down his arm as he went to the ground.  Ironically, Holliday, traded from [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland]] to St. Louis in July, was in the opposing [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]] watching the play.
[[Image:Coors Crowded.jpg|thumb|right|230pix|Coors Field during Game 3 of the NLDS.]]

On September 29, their lead down to 2 games and their magic number at 5, the Rockies opened their final home series against [[Milwaukee Brewers|Milwaukee]].  During the game, Atlanta had their 7-game win streak snapped by Florida 5–4, meaning the Rockies could reduce their magic number to 3 with a win.  Colorado built a 5–2 lead and turned the ball to Street.  However, with one out and two on, Street blew his first save of the season, allowing a game-tying home run to [[Jason Kendall]].  In the bottom of the 11th, [[Chris Iannetta]] pinch hit with the winning run on first.  Seldom used and having batted only 12 times in the month, Iannetta hit a 3–2 pitch from [[David Weathers]] deep to [[right field]] for a walk-off 2-run home run, propelling Colorado to a 7–5 win.  The win combined with the Braves loss seemed to once again shift momentum.  The Braves would lose again the following night, and the Rockies 10–6 win set their magic number at 1.  

On October 1, the Rockies beat the Milwaukee Brewers 9–2, completing a season sweep of the Brewers and clinching the Rockies' second playoff appearance in three years.  The victory also marked the club's 91st win of the season, breaking the franchise record set in 2007. The team broke its record of 22 games over .500 in this victory also. Despite making the race very close, in the 161st game of the season, the Dodgers snapped their five-game losing streak – and the Rockies' five-game winning streak – to clinch the West title. The Rockies entered the playoffs against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] as the NL Wild Card for the second time in three years. They lost to the Phillies 3–1 in the NLDS.

====2010====
{{Main|2010 Colorado Rockies season}}
On April 17, [[Ubaldo Jiménez]] pitched the first [[no-hitter]] in franchise history against the Atlanta Braves. [[Keli McGregor]] President of the Rockies, was found dead on April 20, 2010. On May 24, [[Kazuo Matsui]], former Rockies second baseman during the 2007 championship season, was resigned to the club following his unconditional release from the [[Houston Astros]].  The Rockies have placed Matsui in the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[Colorado Springs Sky Sox]] minor league team. On July 6, the Rockies were losing 9–3 in the 9th inning against the visiting [[St. Louis Cardinals]], when the Rockies stormed back for 9 runs in the inning. Rockies [[Chris Iannetta]] and [[Seth Smith]] each hit 3-run home runs off of closer [[Ryan Franklin]], with Smith's homer being a [[walk-off home run]]. It is currently the largest 9th inning come-from-behind victory in franchise history. On July 30, the Rockies hit an MLB record-setting 11 consecutive hits against the [[Chicago Cubs]].  The Rockies would send a total of 18 batters to the plate and score 12 runs eventually beating the Cubs by a score of 17 to 2.  The hit streak consisted of four singles, four doubles, two home runs and a triple.  The Rockies also broke a franchise record with 13 hits in a single inning.&lt;ref&gt;http://colorado.rockies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100731&amp;content_id=12837356&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=col&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/playbyplay?gameId=300730127&amp;teams=chicago-cubs-vs-colorado-rockies&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockies ended the season with a total record of 83–79 (finishing 3rd overall) by losing 13 of its last 14 games after getting close to 2–3 wins from the NL West leader at one point at almost the end of the season.

Spring Training Homes:
The Colorado Rockies have had Hi Corbett Field as their spring training home for many years. Their newest Spring Training home opens in March 2011 and will be shared with the Arizona Diamondbacks. The field will be called Salt River Fields at Talking Stick

==Controversies==
===2006 controversy over Christian rules===
On June 1, 2006, ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that Rockies management, including manager [[Clint Hurdle]], had instituted an explicitly [[Christian]] code of conduct for the team's players, banning men's magazines (such as ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' and ''[[Playboy]]'') and sexually explicit music from the team's clubhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Nightengale |first=Bob |title=Baseball's Rockies seek revival on two levels |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/rockies/2006-05-30-rockies-cover_x.htm |accessdate=2007-09-26 | work=USA Today | date=June 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper reported:

:''Behind the scenes, [the Rockies] quietly have become an organization guided by Christianity — open to other religious beliefs but embracing a Christian-based code of conduct they believe will bring them focus and success.''

:''From ownership on down, it's an approach the Rockies are proud of — and something they are wary about publicizing. &quot;We're nervous, to be honest with you,&quot; Rockies general manager Dan O'Dowd says. &quot;It's the first time we ever talked about these issues publicly. The last thing we want to do is offend anyone because of our beliefs.&quot;''

The article sparked controversy, including criticism in a column from ''[[The Nation]]'', where [[Dave Zirin]] stated:

:''San Francisco Giants first baseman-outfielder Mark Sweeney, who spent 2003 and 2004 with the Rockies, said, &quot;You wonder if some people are going along with it just to keep their jobs. Look, I pray every day. I have faith. It's always been part of my life. But I don't want something forced on me. Do they really have to check to see whether I have a Playboy in my locker?&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zirin |first=Dave |title= The Rockies Pitch Religion |url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060619/zirin |accessdate=2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the ''USA Today'' article appeared, ''[[The Denver Post]]'' published an article featuring many Rockies players contesting the claims made in the ''USA Today'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Renck |first=Troy E. |title=Team takes issue with portrayal |url=http://www.denverpost.com/sports/ci_3885222 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070404231929/http://www.denverpost.com/sports/ci_3885222 |archivedate=2007-04-04 |accessdate=2007-09-26 |work=Denver Post |date=June 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Rockies pitcher [[Jason Jennings]] said:

:''&quot;[The article in USA Today] was just bad. I am not happy at all. Some of the best teammates I have ever had are the furthest thing from Christian,&quot; Jennings said. &quot;You don't have to be a Christian to have good character. They can be separate. [The article] was misleading.&quot;''

===2007 World Series ticket controversy===
On October 17, 2007, a week before the first game of the [[2007 World Series]] against the Boston Red Sox, the Colorado Rockies announced that tickets would be made available to the general public via online sales only, despite prior arrangements to sell the tickets at local retail outlets. Five days later on October 22, California-based ticket vendor Paciolan, Inc., the sole contractor authorized by the Colorado Rockies to distribute tickets, was forced to suspend sales after less than an hour due to an overwhelming number of attempts to purchase tickets.

An official release from the baseball organization claimed that they were the victims of a [[denial of service attack]]. These claims, however, were unsubstantiated and neither the Rockies nor Paciolan have sought investigation into the matter. The United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] started its own investigation into the claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedenverchannel.com/sports/14425776/detail.html FBI Looking Into 'Malicious Attack' During Ticket Sales – Denver Sports News Story – KMGH Denver&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2007/news/story?id=3080873 ESPN – FBI opens investigation into 'attack' on Rockies ticket system – MLB&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ticket sales resumed the next day, with all three home games selling out within two and a half hours.

[[File:06 Contes cimenterie.jpg|thumb|[[Lafarge]] cement plant in [[Contes, Alpes-Maritimes|Contes]], France.]]
In the most general sense of the word, a '''cement''' is a binder, a substance that sets and hardens independently, and can bind other materials together. The word &quot;cement&quot; traces to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who used the term ''opus caementicium'' to describe [[masonry]] resembling modern [[concrete]] that was made from crushed rock with burnt [[Calcium oxide|lime]] as binder. The [[volcanic ash]] and pulverized [[brick]] additives that were added to the burnt lime to obtain a hydraulic binder were later referred to as cementum, cimentum, cäment and cement.

Cement used in construction is characterized as '''hydraulic''' or '''non-hydraulic'''. Hydraulic cements (''e.g.,'' [[Portland cement]]) harden because of hydration, chemical reactions that occur independently of the mixture's water content; they can harden even underwater or when constantly exposed to wet weather. The chemical reaction that results when the anhydrous cement powder is mixed with water produces hydrates that are not water-soluble. Non-hydraulic cements (''e.g.,'' lime and [[gypsum]] [[plaster]]) must be kept dry in order to retain their strength.

The most important use of cement is the production of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and concrete—the bonding of natural or artificial [[construction aggregate|aggregate]]s to form a strong building material that is durable in the face of normal environmental effects.

[[Concrete]] should not be confused with cement, because the term ''cement'' refers to the material used to bind the aggregate materials of concrete. Concrete is a combination of a cement and aggregate.

==History of the origin of cement==
===Early uses===
It is uncertain where it was first discovered that a combination of [[Slaked lime|hydrated non-hydraulic lime]] and a [[pozzolan]] produces a hydraulic mixture (see also: [[Pozzolanic reaction]]), but concrete made from such mixtures was first used by the [[Ancient Macedonians]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13046299 Macedonians created cement three centuries before the Romans], BBC News Europe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.org/exhibitions/current/?timing=current&amp;id=57&amp;exhibitionYear=2011 Heracles to Alexander The Great: Treasures From The Royal Capital of Macedon, A Hellenic Kingdom in the Age of Democracy], Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology, University of Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; and three centuries later on a large scale by [[Roman engineering|Roman engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Donald: ''A History of Engineering in Classical and Medieval Times'', Routledge 1984, p.&amp;nbsp;106.&lt;/ref&gt; They used both natural pozzolans ([[trass]] or [[pumice]]) and artificial pozzolans (ground brick or pottery) in these concretes.  Many excellent examples of structures made from these concretes are still standing, notably the huge [[monolith]]ic [[dome]] of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]] and the massive [[Baths of Caracalla]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20061018162743/http://www.chamorro.com/community/pagan/Azmar_Natural_Pozzolan.pdf Pure natural pozzolan cement.]&lt;/ref&gt; The vast system of [[Roman aqueduct]]s also made extensive use of hydraulic cement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/2006/4/06.04.04.x.html Aqueduct Architecture: Moving Water to the Masses in Ancient Rome.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although any preservation of this knowledge in literary sources from the [[Middle Ages]] is unknown, medieval [[masonry|masons]] and some military engineers maintained an active tradition of using hydraulic cement in structures such as [[canal]]s, [[fortress]]es, [[harbor]]s, and [[Shipyard|shipbuilding facilities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sismondo&quot;&gt;Sismondo, Sergio. [http://books.google.com/books?id=LescwF8FBigC&amp;dq ''An Introduction to Science and Technology Studies'']. John Wiley and Sons, 2009. 2nd edition, illustrated. 256 pages (page 142). ISBN 978-1-405-18765-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mukerji&quot;&gt;Mukerji, Chandra. [http://books.google.com/books?id=fRwNRrFswv8C&amp;dq ''Impossible engineering: technology and territoriality on the Canal du Midi'']. Princeton University Press, 2009. Illustrated edition. 304 pages (page 121). ISBN 978-0-691-14032-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The technical knowledge of making hydraulic cement was later formalized by French and British engineers in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sismondo&quot;/&gt;

===Modern cement===
Modern hydraulic cements began to be developed from the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]] (around 1800), driven by three main needs:
* Hydraulic [[stucco|render]] (stucco) for finishing brick buildings in wet climates.
* Hydraulic mortars for masonry construction of harbor works, etc., in contact with sea water.
* Development of strong concretes.
In [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] particularly, good quality building stone became ever more expensive during a period of rapid growth, and it became a common practice to construct prestige buildings from the new industrial bricks, and to finish them with a [[stucco]] to imitate stone. Hydraulic limes were favored for this, but the need for a fast set time encouraged the development of new cements. Most famous was Parker's &quot;[[Roman cement]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Francis, ''The Cement Industry 1796–1914: A History'', David &amp; Charles, 1977, ISBN 0-7153-7386-2, Chap. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was developed by [[James Parker (cement maker)|James Parker]] in the 1780s, and finally patented in 1796.  It was, in fact, nothing like any material used by the Romans, but was a &quot;Natural cement&quot; made by burning [[Septarian concretion|septaria]] – nodules that are found in certain clay deposits, and that contain both [[clay minerals]] and [[calcium carbonate]]. The burnt [[nodule (geology)|nodule]]s were ground to a fine powder.  This product, made into a mortar with sand, set in 5–15 minutes. The success of &quot;Roman Cement&quot; led other manufacturers to develop rival products by burning artificial mixtures of [[clay]] and [[chalk]].

[[John Smeaton]] made an important contribution to the development of cements when he was planning the construction of the third [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] (1755–9) in the [[English Channel]].  He needed a hydraulic mortar that would set and develop some strength in the twelve hour period between successive high tides.  He performed an exhaustive market research on the available hydraulic limes, visiting their production sites, and noted that the &quot;hydraulicity&quot; of the lime was directly related to the clay content of the [[limestone]] from which it was made. Smeaton was a [[civil engineer]] by profession, and took the idea no further.  Apparently unaware of Smeaton's work, the same principle was identified by [[Louis Vicat]] in the first decade of the nineteenth century.  Vicat went on to devise a method of combining chalk and clay into an intimate mixture, and, burning this, produced an &quot;artificial cement&quot; in [[1817]].  [[James Frost (cement maker)|James Frost]],&lt;ref&gt;Francis ''op. cit.'', Chap.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; working in Britain, produced what he called &quot;British cement&quot; in a similar manner around the same time, but did not obtain a patent until 1822.  In 1824, [[Joseph Aspdin]] patented a similar material, which he called Portland cement, because the render made from it was in color similar to the prestigious [[Portland stone]].

All the above products could not compete with lime/pozzolan concretes because of fast-setting (giving insufficient time for placement) and low early strengths (requiring a delay of many weeks before [[formwork]] could be removed).  Hydraulic limes, &quot;natural&quot; cements, and &quot;artificial&quot; cements all rely upon their [[belite]] content for [[strength]] development.  Belite develops strength slowly.  Because they were burned at temperatures below 1250&amp;nbsp;°C, they contained no [[alite]], which is responsible for early strength in modern cements.  The first cement to consistently contain alite was made by Joseph Aspdin's son [[William Aspdin|William]] in the early 1840s.  This was what we call today &quot;modern&quot; Portland cement.  Because of the air of mystery with which William Aspdin surrounded his product, others (''e.g.,'' Vicat and [[Isaac Charles Johnson|I.C. Johnson]]) have claimed precedence in this invention, but recent analysis&lt;ref&gt;Hewlett ''op. cit.'', Chap.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt; of both his concrete and raw cement have shown that William Aspdin's product made at [[Northfleet]], [[Kent]] was a true alite-based cement.  However, Aspdin's methods were &quot;rule-of-thumb&quot;: Vicat is responsible for establishing the chemical basis of these cements, and Johnson established the importance of sintering the mix in the kiln.

William Aspdin's innovation was counterintuitive for manufacturers of &quot;artificial cements&quot;, because they required more lime in the mix (a problem for his father), a much higher kiln temperature (and therefore more fuel), and the resulting [[clinker (cement)|clinker]] was very hard and rapidly wore down the [[millstone]]s, which were the only available grinding technology of the time.  Manufacturing costs were therefore considerably higher, but the product set reasonably slowly and developed strength quickly, thus opening up a market for use in concrete.  The use of concrete in construction grew rapidly from 1850 onwards, and was soon the dominant use for cements.  Thus Portland cement began its predominant role.

In the US the first large scale use of cement was [[Rosendale cement]] a natural cement mined from a massive deposit of a large [[Dolostone|dolostone rock]] deposit discovered in the early 19th century near [[Rosendale, New York]].  Rosendale cement was extremely popular for the foundation of buildings (''e.g.'', [[Statue of Liberty]], [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]], [[Brooklyn Bridge]]) and lining water pipes.  But its long [[curing time]] of at least a month made it unpopular after World War One in the construction of highways and bridges and many states and construction firms turned to the use of Portland Cement.  Because of the switch to Portland Cement, by the end of the 1920s of the 15 Rosendale cement companies, only one had survived.  But in the early 1930s it was soon discovered that Portland Cement while it had a faster setting time was not as durable, especially for highways, to the point that some states stop building highways and roads with cement.  An engineer, Bertrain H. Wait, whose company had worked on the construction of the New York Cities [[Catskill Aqueduct]], and was impressed with the durability of Rosendale cement, came up with a blend of both Rosendale and synthetic cements which has the good attributes of both: it was highly durable and had a much faster setting time.  Mr. Wait convinced the New York Commissioner of Highways to construct an experimental section highway near [[New Paltz, New York]], of one sack of Rosendale to six sacks of synthetic cement, and it was proved a success and for decades hence the Rosendale-synthetic cement blend became common use in highway and bridge construction. &lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=VCcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=motor+gun+boat&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5CjqTKr6CM6lnAfK0eToDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=motor%20gun%20boat&amp;f=true &quot;Natural Cement Comes Back&quot;, October 1941, ''Popular Science'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of modern cement ==
=== Portland cement ===
{{Main|Portland cement}}
Cement is made by heating [[limestone]] (calcium carbonate) with small quantities of other materials (such as [[clay]]) to 1450&amp;nbsp;°C in a [[kiln]], in a process known as [[calcination]], whereby a molecule of [[carbon dioxide]] is liberated from the calcium carbonate to form [[calcium oxide]], or quicklime, which is then blended with the other materials that have been included in the mix. The resulting hard substance, called 'clinker', is then ground with a small amount of [[gypsum]] into a powder to make 'Ordinary Portland Cement', the most commonly used type of cement (often referred to as OPC).

Portland cement is a basic ingredient of [[concrete]], [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and most non-speciality [[grout]]. The most common use for Portland cement is in the production of concrete. Concrete is a composite material consisting of [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] ([[gravel]] and [[sand]]), cement, and [[water]]. As a construction material, concrete can be cast in almost any shape desired, and once hardened, can become a structural (load bearing) element.  Portland cement may be grey or white.

===Portland cement blends===
Portland cement blends are often available as inter-ground mixtures from cement manufacturers, but similar formulations are often also mixed from the ground components at the concrete mixing plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Kosmatka, S.H. | coauthors = Panarese, W.C. | title = Design and Control of Concrete Mixtures | publisher = Portland Cement Association | year = 1988 | location = Skokie, IL, USA | pages = 17, 42, 70, 184 | isbn = 0-89312-087-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Portland blastfurnace cement''' contains up to 70&amp;nbsp;% [[ground granulated blast furnace slag]], with the rest Portland clinker and a little gypsum.  All compositions produce high ultimate strength, but as slag content is increased, early strength is reduced, while sulfate resistance increases and heat evolution diminishes.  Used as an economic alternative to Portland sulfate-resisting and low-heat cements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = U.S. Federal Highway Administration | authorlink = Federal Highway Administration | title = Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Portland flyash cement''' contains up to 30&amp;nbsp;% [[fly ash]].  The fly ash is [[pozzolanic]], so that ultimate strength is maintained.  Because fly ash addition allows a lower concrete water content, early strength can also be maintained.  Where good quality cheap fly ash is available, this can be an economic alternative to ordinary Portland cement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = U.S. Federal Highway Administration | authorlink = Federal Highway Administration | title = Fly Ash | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/flyash.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Portland pozzolan cement''' includes fly ash cement, since fly ash is a [[pozzolan]], but also includes cements made from other natural or artificial pozzolans.  In countries where [[volcanic ash]]es are available (e.g. [[Italy]], [[Chile]], [[Mexico]], the [[Philippines]]) these cements are often the most common form in use.

'''Portland silica fume cement'''. Addition of [[silica fume]] can yield exceptionally high strengths, and cements containing 5–20&amp;nbsp;% silica fume are occasionally produced.  However, silica fume is more usually added to Portland cement at the concrete mixer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = U.S. Federal Highway Administration | authorlink = Federal Highway Administration | title = Silica Fume | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/silica.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Masonry cements''' are used for preparing bricklaying [[mortar (masonry)|mortars]] and [[stuccos]], and must not be used in concrete.  They are usually complex proprietary formulations containing Portland clinker and a number of other ingredients that may include limestone, hydrated lime, [[air entrainer]]s, retarders, waterproofers and coloring agents.  They are formulated to yield workable mortars that allow rapid and consistent masonry work.  Subtle variations of Masonry cement in the US are Plastic Cements and [[Stucco Cement]]s.  These are designed to produce controlled bond with masonry blocks.

'''Expansive cements''' contain, in addition to Portland clinker, expansive clinkers (usually sulfoaluminate clinkers), and are designed to offset the effects of drying shrinkage that is normally encountered with hydraulic cements.  This allows large floor slabs (up to 60&amp;nbsp;m square) to be prepared without contraction joints.

'''White blended cements''' may be made using white clinker and white supplementary materials such as high-purity [[metakaolin]].

'''Colored cements''' are used for decorative purposes.  In some standards, the addition of pigments to produce &quot;colored Portland cement&quot; is allowed.  In other standards (e.g. ASTM), pigments are not allowed constituents of Portland cement, and colored cements are sold as &quot;blended hydraulic cements&quot;.

'''Very finely ground cements'''  are made from mixtures of cement with sand or with slag or other pozzolan type minerals that are extremely finely ground together. Such cements can have the same physical characteristics as normal cement but with 50% less cement particularly due to their increased surface area for the chemical reaction. Even with intensive grinding they can use up to 50% less energy to fabricate than ordinary Portland cements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = SINTEF Civil and Environmental Engineering, Cement and Concrete, N-7465 Trondheim, Norway |  title = Mechanism for performance of energetically modified cement EMC | url = http://www.emccement.com/Articles/EMC%20mechanism%20paper.pdf | Cement and Concrete Research 35 (2005) 315– 323.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-Portland hydraulic cements===

'''Pozzolan-lime cements.''' Mixtures of ground [[pozzolanic ash|pozzolan]] and [[Agricultural lime|lime]] are the cements used by the Romans, and can be found in Roman structures still standing (e.g. the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome). They develop strength slowly, but their ultimate strength can be very high. The hydration products that produce strength are essentially the same as those produced by Portland cement.

'''Slag-lime cements.''' [[Ground granulated blast furnace slag]] is not hydraulic on its own, but is &quot;activated&quot; by addition of alkalis, most economically using lime. They are similar to pozzolan lime cements in their properties. Only granulated slag (i.e. water-quenched, glassy slag) is effective as a cement component.

'''Supersulfated cements.''' These contain about 80% ground granulated blast furnace slag, 15&amp;nbsp;% [[gypsum]] or [[anhydrite]] and a little Portland clinker or lime as an activator. They produce strength by formation of [[ettringite]], with strength growth similar to a slow Portland cement. They exhibit good resistance to aggressive agents, including sulfate.

'''[[Calcium aluminate cements]]''' are hydraulic cements made primarily from [[limestone]] and [[bauxite]].  The active ingredients are monocalcium aluminate CaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (CaO · Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or CA in [[Cement chemist notation]], CCN) and [[mayenite]] Ca&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; (12 CaO · 7 Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; , or C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; in CCN). Strength forms by hydration to calcium aluminate hydrates. They are well-adapted for use in refractory (high-temperature resistant) concretes, e.g. for furnace linings.

'''Calcium sulfoaluminate cements''' are made from clinkers that include [[ye'elimite]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(AlO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;\bar \mathrm{S}&lt;/math&gt; in [[Cement chemist notation|Cement chemist's notation]]) as a primary phase. They are used in expansive cements, in ultra-high early strength cements, and in &quot;low-energy&quot; cements. Hydration produces ettringite, and specialized physical properties (such as expansion or rapid reaction) are obtained by adjustment of the availability of calcium and sulfate ions.  Their use as a low-energy alternative to Portland cement has been pioneered in China, where several million tonnes per year are produced.&lt;ref&gt;Bye G.C. (1999), ''Portland Cement'' 2nd Ed., Thomas Telford, 1999, ISBN 0-7277-2766-4, pp. 206–208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhang L., Su M., Wang Y., ''Development of the use of sulfo- and ferroaluminate cements in China'' in ''Adv. Cem. Res.'' '''11''' N°1, pp. 15–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Energy requirements are lower because of the lower kiln temperatures required for reaction, and the lower amount of limestone (which must be endothermically decarbonated) in the mix. In addition, the lower limestone content and lower fuel consumption leads to a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission around half that associated with Portland clinker. However, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions are usually significantly higher.

'''&quot;Natural&quot; cements''' correspond to certain cements of the pre-Portland era, produced by burning [[argillaceous minerals|argillaceous limestones]] at moderate temperatures. The level of clay components in the limestone (around 30–35&amp;nbsp;%) is such that large amounts of [[belite]] (the low-early strength, high-late strength mineral in Portland cement) are formed without the formation of excessive amounts of free lime. As with any natural material, such cements have highly variable properties.

'''[[Geopolymers|Geopolymer]] cements''' are made from mixtures of water-soluble alkali metal silicates and aluminosilicate mineral powders such as [[fly ash]] and [[metakaolin]].

==The setting of cement==
Cement sets when mixed with water by way of a complex series of hydration chemical reactions still only partly understood. The different constituents slowly hydrate and crystallise while the interlocking of their crystals gives to cement its strength.  After the initial setting, immersion in warm water will speed up setting. In [[Portland cement]], [[gypsum]] is added as a compound preventing cement flash setting. The time it takes for cement to set varies; and can take anywhere from twenty minutes for initial set, to twenty-four hours, or more, for final set.

==Safety issues==
Bags of cement routinely have health and safety warnings printed on them because not only is cement highly [[alkali]]ne, but the setting process is [[exothermic]]. As a result, wet cement is strongly [[caustic]] and can easily cause severe [[skin burn]]s if not promptly washed off with water. Similarly, dry cement powder in contact with [[mucous membrane]]s can cause severe eye or respiratory irritation. Cement users should wear protective clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/cis26.pdf CIS26 – cement]. (PDF) .

==Environmental impacts==
Cement manufacture causes environmental impacts at all stages of the process. These include emissions of airborne pollution in the form of dust, gases, noise and vibration when operating machinery and during blasting in [[quarry|quarries]], and damage to countryside from quarrying. Equipment to reduce dust emissions during quarrying and manufacture of cement is widely used, and equipment to trap and separate exhaust gases are coming into increased use. Environmental protection also includes the re-integration of quarries into the countryside after they have been closed down by returning them to nature or re-cultivating them.

===CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions===
Cement manufacturing releases CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere both directly when [[calcium carbonate]] is heated, producing [[lime (mineral)|lime]] and [[carbon dioxide]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggrpt/carbon.html EIA – Emissions of Greenhouse Gases in the U.S. 2006-Carbon Dioxide Emissions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and also indirectly through the use of energy if its production involves the emission of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The cement industry is the second largest CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitting industry behind power generation. The cement industry produces about 5% of global man-made CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, of which 50% is from the chemical process, and 40% from burning fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=ODY3MA The Cement Sustainability Initiative: Progress report], ''[[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]]'', published 2002-06-01&lt;/ref&gt;
The amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted by the cement industry is nearly 900&amp;nbsp;kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for every 1000&amp;nbsp;kg of cement produced.

In certain applications, [[lime mortar]], reabsorbs the same amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as was released in its manufacture, and has a lower energy requirement in production than mainstream cement. Newly developed cement types from Novacem&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imperialinnovations.co.uk/?q=node/176 Novacem | Imperial Innovations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eco-cement]] can absorb [[carbon dioxide]] from ambient air during hardening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/dec/31/cement-carbon-emissions | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Revealed: The cement that eats carbon dioxide| first=Alok | last=Jha | date=2008-12-31 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the [[Kalina cycle]] during production can also increase energy efficiency.

===Heavy metal emissions in the air===
In some circumstances, mainly depending on the origin and the composition of the raw materials used, the high-temperature calcination process of limestone and clay minerals can release in the atmosphere gases and dust rich in volatile [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s, a.o, [[Thallium#Thallium pollution|thallium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.epa.gov/safewater/pdfs/factsheets/ioc/thallium.pdf|accessdate = 2009-09-15| title = Factsheet on: Thallium}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cadmium]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] are the most toxic. Heavy metals (Tl, Cd, Hg, ...) are often found as trace elements in common metal [[sulfide]]s ([[pyrite|pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]], [[Sphalerite|zinc blende (ZnS)]], [[galena|galena (PbS)]], ...) present as secondary minerals in most of the raw materials. Environmental regulations exist in many countries to limit these emissions.

===Heavy metals present in the clinker===
The presence of heavy metals in the clinker arises both from the natural raw materials and from the use of recycled by-products or alternative fuels. The high pH prevailing in the cement porewater (12.5 &lt; pH &lt; 13.5) limits the mobility of many heavy metals by decreasing their solubility and increasing their sorption onto the cement mineral phases. [[Nickel]], [[zinc]] and [[lead]] are commonly found in cement in non-negligible concentrations.

===Use of alternative fuels and by-products materials===
A cement plant consumes 3 to 6 [[GJ]] of fuel per tonne of clinker produced, depending on
the raw materials and the process used. Most cement kilns today use coal and petroleum coke as primary fuels, and to a lesser extent natural gas  and fuel oil. Selected waste and by-products with recoverable calorific value can be used as fuels in a cement kiln, replacing a portion of conventional fossil fuels, like coal, if they meet strict specifications. Selected waste and by-products containing useful minerals such as calcium, silica, alumina, and iron can be used as raw materials in the kiln, replacing raw materials such as clay, [[shale]], and limestone. Because some materials have both useful mineral content and recoverable calorific value, the distinction between alternative fuels and raw materials is not always clear. For example, sewage sludge has a low but significant calorific value, and burns to give ash containing minerals useful in the clinker matrix.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbcsd.org/DocRoot/Vjft3qGjo1v6HREH7jM6/tf2-guidelines.pdf Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Fuels and Raw Materials in the Cement Manufacturing Process], ''[[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]]'', published 2005-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cement industry in the world==
[[File:2004cement (hydraulic).PNG|thumb|right|400px|Cement output in 2004]]
{{See also|List of countries by cement production }}
In 2002 the world production of hydraulic cement was 1,800 million [[tonne]]s. The top three producers were China with 704, India with 100, and the United States with 91 million tonnes for a combined total of about half the world total by the world's three most populated states.

===China===
&quot;For the past 18 years, China consistently has produced more cement than any other country in the world. [...] (However,) China's cement export peaked in 1994 with 11 million tonnes shipped out and has been in steady decline ever since. Only 5.18 million tonnes were exported out of China in 2002. Offered at $34 a ton, Chinese cement is pricing itself out of the market as Thailand is asking as little as $20 for the same quality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Li Yong Yan [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FA07Ad02.html China's way forward paved in cement], ''Asia Times'' January 7, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 it was estimated that China manufactured 1.235 billion tonnes of cement, which was 44% of the world total cement production.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEAA070619b&quot;&gt;[http://www.mnp.nl/en/dossiers/Climatechange/moreinfo/Chinanowno1inCO2emissionsUSAinsecondposition.html China now no. 1 in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions; USA in second position: more info], ''[[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency|NEAA]]'', published 2007-06-19. Retrieved 2007-07-20.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Demand for cement in China is expected to advance 5.4% annually and exceed 1 billion tonnes in 2008, driven by slowing but healthy growth in construction expenditures. Cement consumed in China will amount to 44% of global demand, and China will remain the world's largest national consumer of cement by a large margin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://replay.web.archive.org/20090427075804/http://cementamericas.com/mag/cement_chinas_cement_demand/ China's cement demand to top 1 billion tonnes in 2008], CementAmericas, Nov 1, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cincinnati Reds''' are a [[Major League Baseball]] team based in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]. They are members of the [[National League Central|National League Central Division]]. The franchise originated in 1882 as the Cincinnati Red Stockings, a charter member of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]], then one of the two major leagues. They joined the National League in 1890. 

The Reds have won five [[World Series]] titles, the last in [[1990 World Series|1990]].

Since 2003, the Reds have played at [[Great American Ball Park]], next to their previous home [[Riverfront Stadium]].  The Reds field manager is [[Dusty Baker]], their general manager [[Walt Jocketty]] and their majority owner is [[Bob Castellini]].  

==Franchise history==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[National League]] --&gt;
{{Main|History of the Cincinnati Reds}}
{{see also|List of Cincinnati Reds seasons}}

===Beginnings: the original &quot;Red Stockings&quot; (1866–1889)===
[[Image:1869-cincinnati-red-stockings.jpg|thumb|left|The 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings team photograph.]]
The original [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]], baseball's first openly all-professional team, were founded as an amateur club in [[1845 to 1868 in baseball|1866]], and became fully professional in 1869. The Red Stockings won 130 straight games throughout 1869 and [[1870 in baseball|1870]], before being defeated by the [[Brooklyn Atlantics]]. Star players included brothers [[Harry Wright|Harry]] and [[George Wright (sportsman)|George Wright]], Fred Walterman, and pitcher [[Asa Brainard]]. The 1869 Red Stockings made an eastern swing of 21 games and went undefeated. According to Walter Camp, the team received a banquet and a &quot;champion bat...this rather remarkable testimonial was twenty-seven feet long and nine inches (229 mm) in diameter&quot;. The following year, the team lost only one game. They were defeated at the Brooklyn Atlantics' [[Capitoline Grounds]]. According to Camp, the Red Stockings lost 8&amp;ndash;7 in 11 innings. The game apparently served as a precursor to today's unruly crowds because he wrote: &quot;A crowd of ten thousand people assembled to witness this match, and so lost their heads in the excitement as to give the Western men a very unfair reception.&quot;

In 1869, the Red Stockings posted a perfect 57-0 record. So far the only perfect season in baseball history.   This was the first team to play on the East and West coasts in the same season. More than 2,000 people greeted the team when it arrived in San Francisco at 10 p.m. “They really helped nationalize the game and put Cincinnati on the map as a baseball town,” said Greg Rhodes, a Reds historian who wrote “The First Boys of Summer” (Road West Publishing Company, 1994), along with Enquirer reporter John Erardi, about the 1869-1870 Red Stockings.

The best players of the Cincinnati Red Stockings relocated to Boston after the [[1870 in baseball|1870]] season, taking the nickname along with them and becoming the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Red Stockings]], a team later dubbed the &quot;Beaneaters&quot; and eventually the &quot;Braves&quot;, who are now based in Atlanta. A new [[Cincinnati Reds (1876-1880)|Cincinnati Red Stockings]] team became a charter member of the [[National League]] in 1876, five years after the first Red Stockings team. The second Red Stockings team was expelled from the league after the 1880 season, in part for violating league rules by serving beer to fans at games, and for their refusal to stop renting out their ballpark, the [[Bank Street Grounds]], on Sundays.

A third Cincinnati team of the same name became a founding member of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]], a rival league that began play in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scsr.org/Subsites/Reds-NL/History.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.associationreds.com&lt;/ref&gt; That team (which is the same franchise of today) played for eight seasons in the American Association and won the Association's inaugural pennant in 1882. The pennant winning club still holds the record for the highest winning percentage of any Reds club to date (.688) save the perfect season by their illustrious namesakes of 1869. In November 1889, the Cincinnati Red Stockings and the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] both left the Association for the National League.

===New League: the National League returns to Cincinnati (1890–1911)===
[[Image:Cincinnati Reds.jpg|thumb|left|Cincinnati Reds baseball team in 1909]]
Although some dispute whether the two teams are the same,&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Peter &amp; Gillette, Gary, editors, ''The Baseball Encyclopedia.'' New York: Barnes &amp; Noble Books, 2004, pp 1370 &amp; 1387&lt;/ref&gt; the Cincinnati Red Stockings left the American Association in 1890 to play in the National League. One of the main reasons was the emergence of the new Player's League. This new league, an early failed attempt to break the [[reserve clause]] in baseball, threatened both existing leagues. Because the National League decided to expand while the American Association was weakening, the team accepted an invitation to join the National League. It was also at this time that the team first shortened their name from &quot;Red Stockings&quot; to &quot;Reds&quot;. The Reds wandered through the 1890s signing local stars and aging veterans. During this time, the team never finished above third place (1897) and never closer than 10½ games (1890).

At the turn of the century, the Reds had hitting stars  [[Sam Crawford]] and [[Cy Seymour]]. Seymour's .377 average in 1905 was the first individual batting crown won by a Red. In 1911, [[Bob Bescher]] stole 81 bases, which is still a team record. Like the previous decade, the 1900s were not kind to the Reds, as much of the decade was spent in the league's [[first division (baseball)|second division]].

===Growth of a Franchise: Redland Field to the Great Depression (1912–1932)===
[[Image:Edd Roush Baseball.jpg|thumb|150px|Hall of famer [[Edd Roush]] led Cincinnati to the 1919 World Series.]]In 1912, the club opened a new steel-and-concrete ballpark, [[Redland Field]] (later to be known as [[Crosley Field]]). The Reds had been playing baseball on that same site, the corner of Findlay and Western Avenues on the city's west side, for 28 years, in wooden structures that had been occasionally damaged by fires. By the late 1910s the Reds began to come out of the second division. The 1918 team finished fourth, and new manager [[Pat Moran]] led the Reds to an NL [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] in 1919, in what the club inaccurately advertised as its &quot;Golden Anniversary&quot;. The 1919 team had hitting stars [[Edd Roush]] and [[Heinie Groh]] while the pitching staff was led by [[Hod Eller]] and left-hander [[Slim Sallee|Harry &quot;Slim&quot; Sallee]]. The Reds finished ahead of [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw's]] [[1919 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], and then won the [[world championship]] in eight games over the [[1919 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]].

By 1920, the [[Black Sox Scandal|&quot;Black Sox&quot; scandal]] had brought a taint to the Reds' first championship. After 1926, and well into the 1930s, the Reds were second division dwellers. [[Eppa Rixey]], [[Dolf Luque]] and [[Pete Donohue]] were pitching stars, but the offense never lived up to the pitching. By 1931, the team was bankrupt, the [[Great Depression]] was in full swing and Crosley Field was in a state of disrepair.

===Championship Baseball: revival of 1930s (1933–1940)===
[[Powel Crosley Jr.]], an [[electronics]] [[business magnate|magnate]] who, with his brother [[Lewis M. Crosley]], produced [[radio]]s, [[refrigerator]]s, and other household items, bought the Reds out of bankruptcy in 1933, and hired [[Larry MacPhail]] to be the General Manager. Crosley had started [[WLW]] radio, the Reds flagship radio broadcaster, and the [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation]] in Cincinnati, where he was also a prominent civic leader. MacPhail began to develop the Reds' [[minor league baseball|minor league system]] and expanded the Reds' fan base. The Reds, throughout the 1930s, became a team of &quot;firsts&quot;. [[Crosley Field]], (formerly Redland Field), became the host of the first night game in 1935, which was also the first baseball fireworks night, the fireworks at the game were shot by Joe Rozzi of Rozzi's Famous Fireworks. [[Johnny Vander Meer]] became the only pitcher in major league history to throw back-to-back no-hitters in 1938. Thanks to Vander Meer, [[Paul Derringer]] and second baseman/third baseman-turned-[[pitcher]] [[Bucky Walters]], the Reds had a solid pitching staff. The offense came around in the late 1930s. By 1938 the Reds, now led by manager [[Bill McKechnie]], were out of the second division finishing fourth. [[Ernie Lombardi]] was named the National League's Most Valuable Player in 1938. By 1939, they were National League champions, but in the World Series, they were swept by the [[New York Yankees]]. In 1940, they repeated as NL Champions, and for the first time in 21 years, the Reds captured a World championship, beating the [[1940 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] 4 games to 3. [[Frank McCormick]] was the 1940 NL MVP. Other position players included [[Harry Craft]], [[Lonny Frey]], [[Ival Goodman]], [[Lew Riggs]] and [[Bill Werber]].

===Beginnings of the Machine: from WWII through the 1960s (1941–1969)===
[[World War II]] and age finally caught up with the Reds. Throughout the 1940s and early 1950s, Cincinnati finished mostly in the second division. In 1944, [[Joe Nuxhall]] (who was later to become part of the radio broadcasting team), at age 15, pitched for the Reds on loan from Wilson Junior High school in Hamilton, Ohio. He became the youngest person ever to play in a major league game — a record that still stands today. Ewell &quot;The Whip&quot; Blackwell was the main pitching stalwart before arm problems cut short his career. [[Ted Kluszewski]] was the NL home run leader in 1954. The rest of the offense was a collection of over-the-hill players and not-ready-for-prime-time youngsters.

In 1956, led by National League [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] [[Frank Robinson]], the Redlegs hit 221 HR to tie the NL record. By 1961, Robinson was joined by [[Vada Pinson]], [[Wally Post]], [[Gordy Coleman]] and [[Gene Freese]]. Pitchers [[Joey Jay]], [[Jim O'Toole]] and [[Bob Purkey]] led the staff. The Reds captured the 1961 National League pennant, holding off the [[1961 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] and the [[1961 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]], only to be defeated by the perennially powerful [[1961 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in the [[1961 World Series|World Series]]. The Reds had winning teams during the rest of the 1960s, but did not produce any championships. They won 98 games in 1962, paced by Purkey's 23), but finished third. In 1964, they lost the pennant by one game to the Cardinals after having taken first place when the Phillies collapsed in September. Their beloved manager [[Fred Hutchinson]] died of cancer just weeks after the end of the 1964 season. The failure of the Reds to win the 1964 pennant led to owner [[Bill DeWitt|Bill DeWitt's]] selling off key components of the team, in anticipation of relocating the franchise. After the 1965 season he executed what may be the most lopsided trade in baseball history, sending former Most Valuable Player Frank Robinson to the Baltimore Orioles for pitchers [[Milt Pappas]] and [[Jack Baldschun]], and outfielder [[Dick Simpson]]. Robinson went on to win the MVP and triple crown in the American league for 1966, and lead Baltimore to its first ever World Series title in a sweep of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Reds did not recover from this trade until the rise of the &quot;Big Red Machine&quot; of the 1970s.

Starting in the early 1960s, the Reds' farm system began producing a series of stars, including [[Jim Maloney]] (the Reds pitching ace of the 1960s), [[Pete Rose]], [[Tony Pérez]], [[Johnny Bench]], [[Lee May]], [[Tommy Helms]], [[Bernie Carbo]], [[Hal McRae]], [[Dave Concepción]] and [[Gary Nolan (baseball player)|Gary Nolan]]. The tipping point came in 1967 with the appointment of [[Bob Howsam]] as general manager. That same year the Reds avoided a move to San Diego when the city of Cincinnati and Hamilton County agreed to build a state of the art, downtown stadium on the edge of the Ohio River. The Reds entered into a 30-year lease in exchange for the stadium commitment keeping the franchise in its original home city. In a series of strategic moves, Howsam brought in key personnel to complement the homegrown talent. The Reds' final game at Crosley Field, home to more than 4,500 baseball games, was played on June 24, 1970, a 5&amp;ndash;4 victory over the [[1970 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]].

Twice in the 1950s (the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]]), the Reds, fearing that their traditional club nickname would associate them with the threat of [[Communism]], officially changed the name of the team to the '''Cincinnati Redlegs'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Baseball's Reluctant Challenge |last=Davis |first=Jack E. |year=1992 |pages=144–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1956 to 1960, the club's logo was altered to remove the term &quot;REDS&quot; from the inside of the &quot;wishbone ''C''&quot; symbol. The &quot;REDS&quot; reappeared on the 1961 uniforms, but the point of the ''C'' was removed, leaving a smooth, non-wishbone curve. The traditional home-uniform logo was restored in 1967.

Under Howsam's administration starting in the late 1960s, the Reds instituted a strict rule barring the team's players from wearing facial hair and long hair. The clean cut look was meant to present the team as wholesome in an era of turmoil. All players coming to the Reds were required to shave and cut their hair for the next three decades. Over the years, the rule was controversial, but persisted well into the ownership of [[Marge Schott]]. On at least one occasion, in the early 1980s, enforcement of this rule lost them the services of star reliever [[Rollie Fingers]], who would not shave his trademark handlebar mustache in order to join the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DEFD91739F931A15751C0A960948260 | work=The New York Times | title=Sports People; Fingers Won't Conform | date=February 22, 1986 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule was not officially rescinded until 1999 when the Reds traded for slugger [[Greg Vaughn]], who had a goatee.

The Reds' rules also included conservative uniforms. In major league baseball, a club generally provides most of the equipment and clothing needed for play. However, players are required to supply their gloves and shoes themselves. Many players enter into sponsorship arrangements with shoe manufacturers, but through the mid-1980s, the Reds had a strict rule that players were to wear only plain black shoes with no prominent logo. Reds players decried what they considered to be the boring color choice as well as the denial of the opportunity to earn more money through shoe contracts. A compromise was struck in which players were allowed to wear red shoes.

===Dynasty: the Big Red Machine (1970–1976)===
[[Image:Riverfront stadium.jpg|thumb|Riverfront Stadium, (Cinergy Field)]]
In {{by|1970}}, little known [[Sparky Anderson|George &quot;Sparky&quot; Anderson]] was hired as manager, and the Reds embarked upon a decade of excellence, with a team that came to be known as &quot;[[The Big Red Machine]]&quot;. Playing at Crosley Field until June 30, 1970, when the Reds moved into brand-new [[Riverfront Stadium]], a 52,000 seat multi-purpose venue on the shores of the [[Ohio River]], the Reds began the 1970s with a bang by winning 70 of their first 100 games. [[Johnny Bench]], [[Tony Pérez]], [[Pete Rose]], [[Lee May]] and [[Bobby Tolan]] were the early Red Machine offensive leaders; [[Gary Nolan (baseball player)|Gary Nolan]], [[Jim Merritt]], [[Wayne Simpson]] and [[Jim McGlothlin]] led a pitching staff which also contained veterans [[Tony Cloninger]] and [[Clay Carroll]] and youngsters [[Pedro Borbón]] and [[Don Gullett]]. The Reds breezed through the 1970 season, winning the NL West and captured the NL pennant by sweeping the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in three games. By time the club got to the [[1970 World Series|World Series]], however, the Reds pitching staff had run out of gas and the veteran [[Baltimore Orioles]] beat the Reds in five games.

After the disastrous {{by|1971}} [[1971 Major League Baseball season|season]] (the only season of the '70s during which the Reds finished with a losing record) the Reds reloaded by trading veterans Jimmy Stewert, May, and [[Tommy Helms]] for [[Joe Morgan]], [[César Gerónimo]], [[Jack Billingham]], [[Ed Armbrister]], and [[Denis Menke]]. Meanwhile, [[Dave Concepción]] blossomed at [[shortstop]]. 1971 was also the year a key component of the future world championships was acquired in [[George Foster (baseball)|George Foster]] from the San Francisco Giants in a trade for shortstop [[Frank Duffy (baseball)|Frank Duffy]].

The {{by|1972}} [[1972 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] won the NL West in baseball's first ever [[1972 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] [[1972 Major League Baseball season|season]] and defeated the [[1972 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] in an exciting [[1972 National League Championship Series|five-game playoff series]]. They then faced the [[1972 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in the [[1972 World Series|World Series]]. Six of the seven games were won by one run. With powerful slugger [[Reggie Jackson]] sidelined due to an injury incurred during Oakland's [[1972 American League Championship Series|playoff series]], Ohio native [[Gene Tenace]] got a chance to play in the series, delivering four home runs that tied the World Series record for homers, propelling Oakland to a dramatic seven-game series win. This was the first World Series in which no starting pitcher for either side pitched a complete game.

The [[1973 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] won a third NL West crown in {{by|1973}} after a dramatic second half comeback, that saw them make up {{frac|10|1|2}} games on the [[1973 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] after the [[1973 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star break]]. However they lost the NL pennant to the [[1973 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] in five games in the [[1973 National League Championship Series|NCLS]]. In game one, [[Tom Seaver]] faced Jack Billingham in a classic pitching duel, with all three runs of the 2&amp;ndash;1 margin being scored on home runs. [[John Milner]] provided New York's run off Billingham, while Pete Rose tied the game in the seventh inning off Seaver, setting the stage for a dramatic game ending home run by Johnny Bench in the bottom of the ninth. The New York series provided plenty of controversy with the riotous behavior of [[Shea Stadium]] fans towards Pete Rose when he and [[Bud Harrelson]] scuffled after a hard slide by Rose into Harrelson at second base during the fifth inning of Game 3. A full bench-clearing fight resulted after Harrelson responded to Rose's aggressive move to prevent him from completing a double play by calling him a name. This also led to two more incidents in which play was stopped. The Reds trailed 9&amp;ndash;3 and New York's manager, [[Yogi Berra]], and legendary outfielder [[Willie Mays]], at the request of National League president [[Warren Giles]], appealed to fans in left field to restrain themselves. The next day the series was extended to a fifth game when Rose homered in the 12th inning to tie the series at two games each.

The Reds won 98 games in {{by|1974}} but they finished second to the 102-win [[1974 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]]. The [[1974 Major League Baseball season|1974 season]] started off with much excitement, as the [[1974 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] were in town to open the season with the Reds. [[Hank Aaron]] entered opening day with 713 home runs, one shy of tying Babe Ruth's record of 714. The first pitch Aaron swung at in the '74 season was the record tying home run off Jack Billingham. The next day the Braves benched Aaron, hoping to save him for his record breaking home run on their season opening homestand. The commissioner of baseball, [[Bowie Kuhn]], ordered Braves management to play Aaron the next day, where he narrowly missed the historic home run in the fifth inning. Aaron went on to set the record in Atlanta two nights later. 1974 also was the debut of Hall of Fame radio announcer [[Marty Brennaman]], who replaced [[Al Michaels]], after Michaels left the Reds to broadcast for the [[San Francisco Giants]].

With 1975, the Big Red Machine lineup solidified with the starting team of [[Johnny Bench]] (c), [[Tony Perez]] (1b), [[Joe Morgan]] (2b), [[Dave Concepción]] (ss), [[Pete Rose]] (3b), [[Ken Griffey, Sr.|Ken Griffey]] (rf), [[César Gerónimo]] (cf), and [[George Foster (baseball player)|George Foster]] (lf). The starting pitchers included [[Don Gullett]], [[Fred Norman]], [[Gary Nolan (baseball player)|Gary Nolan]], [[Jack Billingham]], [[Pat Darcy]], and [[Clay Kirby]]. The bullpen featured [[Rawly Eastwick]] and [[Will McEnaney]] combining for 37 saves, and veterans [[Pedro Borbon]] and [[Clay Carroll]].  On Opening Day, Rose still played in left field, Foster was not a starter, while [[John Vukovich]], an off-season acquisition, was the starting third baseman. While Vuckovich was a superb fielder, he was a weak hitter. In May, with the team off to a slow start and trailing the Dodgers, Sparky Anderson made a bold move by moving Rose to third base, a position where he had very little experience, and inserting Foster in left field. This was the jolt that the Reds needed to propel them into first place, with Rose proving to be reliable on defense, while adding Foster to the outfield gave the offense some added punch. During the season, the Reds compiled two notable streaks: (1) by winning 41 out of 50 games in one stretch, and (2) by going a month without committing any errors on defense.

In the [[1975 Major League Baseball season|1975 season]], [[1975 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]] clinched the NL West with 108 victories, then swept the [[1975 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] in three games to win the NL pennant. In the [[1975 World Series|World Series]], the [[1975 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] were the opponents. After splitting the first four games, the Reds took Game 5. After a three-day rain delay, the two teams met in Game 6, one of the most memorable baseball games ever played and considered by many to be the best World Series game ever. The Reds were ahead 6&amp;ndash;3 with 5 outs left, when the Red Sox tied the game on former Red [[Bernie Carbo]]'s three-run [[home run]]. It was Carbo's second pinch-hit three-run homer in the series. After a few close-calls either way, [[Carlton Fisk]] hit a dramatic 12th inning [[home run]] off the [[foul pole]] in left field (which is considered to be one of the greatest TV sports moments of all time) to give the Red Sox a 7&amp;ndash;6 win and force a deciding Game 7. Cincinnati prevailed the next day when Morgan's [[run batted in|RBI]] [[single (baseball)|single]] won Game 7 and gave the Reds their first championship in 35 years. The Reds have not lost a World Series game since Carlton Fisk's home run, a span of 9 straight wins.

1976 saw a return of the same starting eight in the field. The starting rotation was again led by Nolan, Gullett, Billingham, and Norman, while the addition of rookies [[Pat Zachry]] and [[Santo Alcalá]] comprised an underrated staff in which four of the six had ERAs below 3.10. Eastwick, Borbon, and McEnaney shared closer duties, recording 26, 8, and 7 saves respectively. The [[1976 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] won the NL West by ten games. They went undefeated in the postseason (to date the only team to do so since playoffs were introduced), sweeping the [[1976 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] (winning Game 3 in their final at-bat) to return to the [[1976 World Series|World Series]]. They continued to dominate by sweeping the [[1976 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in the newly renovated [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], the first World Series games played in Yankee Stadium since 1964. This was only the second ever sweep of the Yankees in the World Series. In winning the Series, the Reds became the first NL team since the 1921&amp;ndash;22 [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] to win consecutive World Series championships, and the Big Red Machine of 1975&amp;ndash;76 is considered one of the best teams ever.  So far in MLB history, the 1975 and '76 Reds were the last NL team to repeat as champions.

Beginning with the 1970 National League pennant, the Reds beat either the [[Phillies–Pirates rivalry|Philadelphia Phillies or the Pittsburgh Pirates]] to win their pennants (Pirates in 1970, 1972, 1975, and 1990, Phillies in 1976), making The Big Red Machine part of the rivalry between the two Pennsylvania teams. In 1979, [[Pete Rose]] added further fuel in The Big Red Machine being part of the rivalry when he signed with the Phillies and helped them win their first World Series championship in {{wsy|1980}}.

===Post-Dynasty: the Machine Dismantled (1977–1989)===
The later years of the 1970s brought turmoil and change. Popular [[Tony Perez]] was sent to [[Montreal Expos|Montreal]] after the 1976 season, breaking up the Big Red Machine's starting lineup. Manager Sparky Anderson and General Manager [[Bob Howsam]] later considered this trade the biggest mistake of their careers. Starting pitcher [[Don Gullett]] left via free agency and signed with the New York Yankees. In an effort to fill that gap, a trade with the [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland A's]] for starting ace [[Vida Blue]] was arranged during the '76&amp;ndash;'77 off-season. However, Bowie Kuhn, the Commissioner of Baseball, vetoed the trade in an effort to maintain the competitive balance in baseball. On June 15, 1977, the Mets' franchise pitcher [[Tom Seaver]] was traded to the Reds for Pat Zachry, [[Doug Flynn]], Steve Henderson, and Dan Norman. In other deals that proved to be less successful, the Reds traded Gary Nolan to the Angels for [[Craig Hendrickson]], Rawly Eastwick to St. Louis for [[Doug Capilla]] and [[Mike Caldwell (baseball)|Mike Caldwell]] to Milwaukee for [[Rick O'Keeffe]] and [[Garry Pyka]], and got [[Rick Auerbach]] from Texas. The end of the Big Red Machine era was heralded by the replacement of General Manager Bob Howsam with [[Dick Wagner (baseball)|Dick Wagner]].

In Rose's last season as a Red, he gave baseball a thrill as he challenged [[Joe DiMaggio]]'s 56- game hitting streak, tying for the second-longest streak ever at 44 games. The streak came to an end in Atlanta after striking out in his fifth at bat in the game against [[Gene Garber]]. Rose also earned his 3,000th hit that season, on his way to becoming baseball's all-time hits leader when he rejoined the Reds in the mid 80s. The year also witnessed the only no-hitter of Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Seaver's career, coming against the [[1978 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] on June 16, 1978.

After the [[1978 Major League Baseball season|1978 season]] and two straight second place finishes, Wagner fired manager Anderson. Pete Rose, who since 1963 had played almost every position for the team except pitcher and catcher, signed with Philadelphia as a free agent. By 1979, the starters were Bench (c), [[Dan Driessen]] (1b), Morgan (2b), Concepcion (ss), [[Ray Knight]] (3b), with Griffey, Foster, and Geronimo again in the outfield. The pitching staff had experienced a complete turnover since 1976 except for Fred Norman. In addition to ace starter [[Tom Seaver]]; the remaining starters were [[Mike La Coss]], [[Bill Bonham]], and [[Paul Moskau]]. In the bullpen, only Borbon had remained. [[Dave Tomlin]] and [[Mario Soto (baseball)|Mario Soto]] worked middle relief with [[Tom Hume]] and [[Doug Bair]] closing.  The [[1979 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] won the 1979 NL West behind the pitching of Tom Seaver but were dispatched in the [[1979 National League Championship Series|NL playoffs]] by [[1979 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh]]. Game 2 featured a controversial play in which a ball hit by Pittsburgh's [[Phil Garner]] was caught by Cincinnati outfielder [[Dave Collins]] but was ruled a trap, setting the Pirates up to take a 2&amp;ndash;1 lead. The Pirates swept the series 3 games to 0 and went on to win the World Series against the [[Baltimore Orioles]].

The [[1981 Cincinnati Reds season|1981 team]] fielded a strong lineup, but with only Concepcion, Foster, and Griffey retaining their spots from the 1975-76 heyday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CIN/1976.shtml |title=1976 Cincinnati Reds Statistics and Roster|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CIN/1981.shtml |title=1981 Cincinnati Reds Statistics and Roster|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Johnny Bench was able to play only a few games at catcher each year after 1980 due to ongoing injuries, [[Joe Nolan]] took over as starting catcher. Driessen and Bench shared 1st base, and Knight starred at third. Morgan and Geronimo had been replaced at second base and center field by [[Ron Oester]] and Dave Collins. Mario Soto posted a banner year starting on the mound, only surpassed by the outstanding performance of Seaver's Cy Young runner-up season. La Coss, [[Bruce Berenyi]], and [[Frank Pastore]] rounded out the starting rotation. Hume again led the bullpen as closer, joined by Bair and [[Joe Price]].  In {{by|1981}}, [[1981 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]] had the best overall record in baseball, but they finished second in the division in both of the half-seasons that were created after a mid-season players' [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|strike]], and missed the playoffs. To commemorate this, a team photo was taken, accompanied by a banner that read &quot;Baseball's Best Record 1981&quot;.

By {{by|1982}}, the [[1982 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] were a shell of the original Red Machine; they lost 101 games that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CIN/1982_sched.shtml |title=1982 Cincinnati Reds Schedule, Box Scores and Splits|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=2008-03-30 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnny Bench, after an unsuccessful transition to 3rd base, retired a year later.

After the heartbreak of 1981, General Manager Dick Wagner pursued the strategy of ridding the team of veterans including third-baseman Knight and the entire starting outfield of Griffey, Foster, and Collins. Bench, after being able to catch only seven games in 1981, was moved from platooning at first base to be the starting third baseman; [[Alex Trevino]] became the regular starting catcher. The outfield was staffed with [[Paul Householder]], [[César Cedeño]], and [[Clint Hurdle]] on opening day. Hurdle was an immediate bust, and rookie [[Eddie Milner]] took his place in the starting outfield early in the year. The highly touted Householder struggled throughout the year despite extensive playing time. Cedeno, while providing steady veteran play, was a disappointment, and was unable to recapture his glory days with the Houston Astros. The starting rotation featured the emergence of a dominant Mario Soto, and featured strong years by Pastore and [[Bruce Berenyi]], but Seaver was injured all year, and their efforts were wasted without a strong offensive lineup. Tom Hume still led the bullpen, along with Joe Price. But the colorful [[Brad Lesley|Brad &quot;The Animal&quot; Lesley]] was unable to consistently excel, and former all-star [[Jim Kern]] was a big disappointment. Kern was also publicly upset over having to shave off his prominent beard to join the Reds, and helped force the issue of getting traded during mid-season by growing it back.

The Reds fell to the bottom of the Western Division for the next few years. After his injury-riddled 1982 season, Seaver was traded back to the Mets. The year 1983 found [[Dann Bilardello]] behind the plate, Bench returning to part-time duty at first base, rookies [[Nick Esasky]] taking over at third base and [[Gary Redus]] taking over from Cedeno. Tom Hume's effectiveness as a closer had diminished, and no other consistent relievers emerged. Dave Concepción was the sole remaining starter from the Big Red Machine era.

Wagner's reign of terror ended in 1983, when Howsam, the architect of the Big Red Machine, was brought back. Howsam began his return by acquiring Cincinnati native [[Dave Parker]] from Pittsburgh. In {{by|1984}} the Reds began to move up, depending on trades and some minor leaguers. In that season Dave Parker, [[Dave Concepción]] and [[Tony Pérez]] were in Cincinnati uniforms. In the middle of the 1984 season, [[Pete Rose]] was hired to be the Reds player-manager. After raising the franchise from the grave, Howsam gave way to the administration of [[Bill Bergesch]], who attempted to build the team around a core of highly regarded young players in addition to veterans like Parker. However, he was unable to capitalize on an excess of young and highly touted position players including [[Kurt Stillwell]], [[Tracy Jones]], and [[Kal Daniels]] by trading them for pitching. Despite the emergence of Tom Browning as rookie of the year in 1985 when he won 20 games, the rotation was devastated by the early demise of Mario Soto's career to arm injury.

Under Bergesch, from {{by|1985}}&amp;ndash;[[1989 in baseball|89]] the Reds finished second four times. Among the highlights, Rose became the all-time hits leader, [[Tom Browning]] threw a [[perfect game]], and [[Chris Sabo]] was the [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|1988 National League Rookie of the Year]]. The Reds also had a bullpen star in [[John Franco]], who was with the team from 1984 to 1989. In {{by|1989}}, Rose was banned from baseball by [[Baseball commissioner|Commissioner]] [[A. Bartlett Giamatti|Bart Giamatti]], who declared Rose guilty of &quot;conduct detrimental to baseball&quot;. Controversy also swirled around Reds owner [[Marge Schott]], who was accused several times of [[List of ethnic slurs|ethnic and racial slurs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4D61439F934A35751C1A964958260 |title=BASEBALL; Call for Schott to Step Down|publisher=New York Times|date=December 7, 1992|accessdate=2008-03-30 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Pete Rose: a World Championship and the End of an Era (1990–2002)===
[[Image:Eric davis.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]] in 1990]]
In {{by|1987}}, General Manager Bergesch was replaced by [[Murray Cook]], who initiated a series of deals that would finally bring the Reds back to the championship, starting with acquisitions of [[Danny Jackson]] and [[Jose Rijo]]. An aging Dave Parker was let go after a revival of his career in Cincinnati. Barry Larkin emerged as the starting shortstop over Kurt Stillwell, who along with reliever Ted Power, was traded for Jackson. In {{by|1989}}, Cook was succeeded by [[Bob Quinn (baseball grandson)|Bob Quinn]], who put the final pieces of the championship puzzle together, with the acquisitions of [[Hal Morris]], [[Billy Hatcher (baseball)|Billy Hatcher]], and [[Randy Myers]].

In {{by|1990}}, the [[1990 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] under new manager [[Lou Piniella]] shocked baseball by leading the NL West from wire-to-wire. They started off 33&amp;ndash;12, winning their first 9 games, and maintained their lead throughout the year. Led by [[Chris Sabo]], [[Barry Larkin]], [[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]], [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]] and Billy Hatcher in the field, and by [[José Rijo]], Tom Browning and the &quot;Nasty Boys&quot; of [[Rob Dibble]], [[Norm Charlton]] and [[Randy Myers]] on the mound, the Reds took out the [[1990 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pirates]] in the [[1990 National League Championship Series|NLCS]]. The Reds swept the heavily favored [[Oakland Athletics]] in four straight, and extended a Reds winning streak in the World Series to 9 consecutive games. The World Series, however, saw Eric Davis severely bruise a kidney diving for a fly ball in Game 4, and his play was greatly limited the next year. In winning the World Series the Reds, became the first and only, National League team to go wire to wire.

In {{by|1992}}, Quinn was replaced in the front office by [[Jim Bowden]]. On the field, manager Lou Piniella wanted outfielder Paul O'Neill to be a power-hitter to fill the void Eric Davis left when he was traded to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in exchange for [[Tim Belcher]]. However, O'Neill only hit .246 and 14 homers. The Reds returned to winning after a losing season in 1991, but 90 wins was only enough for 2nd place behind the division-winning [[1992 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]]. Before the season ended, Piniella got into an altercation with reliever Rob Dibble. In the off season, [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]] was traded to the [[New York Yankees]] for outfielder [[Roberto Kelly]]. Kelly was a disappointment for the Reds over the next couple of years, while O'Neill blossomed, leading a down-trodden Yankees franchise to a return to glory. Also, the Reds would replace their outdated &quot;Big Red Machine&quot; era uniforms in favor of a pinstriped uniform with no sleeves.

For the [[1993 Cincinnati Reds season|1993 season]] Piniella was replaced by fan favorite Tony Perez, but he lasted only 44 games at the helm, replaced by [[Davey Johnson]]. With Johnson steering the team, the Reds made steady progress upward. In 1994, the Reds were in the newly-created [[National League Central Division]] with the [[Chicago Cubs]], [[St. Louis Cardinals]], as well as fellow rivals [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and [[Houston Astros]]. By the time the strike hit, the Reds finished a half-game ahead of the Astros for first-place in the NL Central. By {{by|1995}}, the Reds won the division thanks to [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player|Most Valuable Player]] [[Barry Larkin]]. After defeating the NL West champion Dodgers in the first NLDS since 1981, they lost to the [[Atlanta Braves]]. 

Team owner [[Marge Schott]] announced mid-season that Johnson would be gone by the end of the year, regardless of outcome, to be replaced by former Reds third baseman Ray Knight. Johnson and Schott had never gotten along and she did not approve of Johnson living with his fiancée before they were married,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/orioles/longterm/memories/davey/articles/poorcomm.htm | work=The Washington Post | date=May 12, 1998 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Knight, along with his wife, professional golfer [[Nancy Lopez]], were friends of Schott's. The team took a dive under Knight and he was unable to complete two full seasons as manager, subject to complaints in the press about his strict managerial style.

In {{by|1999}} the [[1999 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] won 96 games, led by manager [[Jack McKeon]], but lost to the [[New York Mets]] in a [[1999 National League Wild-Card tie-breaker game|one game playoff]]. Earlier that year, Schott sold controlling interest in the Reds to Cincinnati businessman [[Carl Lindner]]. Despite an 85&amp;ndash;77 finish in 2000, and being named 1999 NL manager of the year, McKeon was fired after the [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000 season]]. The Reds did not have another winning season until 2010.

===New owner, new stadium: Contemporary era (2003–present)===
[[Image:Gabp.jpg|thumb|GABP opened in 2003, becoming the seventh home field for the Reds]]
[[Riverfront Stadium]], (Cinergy Field), was demolished in {{by|2002}} and ended an era marked by three world championships. [[Great American Ball Park]] opened in {{by|2003}} with high expectations for a team led by local favorites, including [[outfielder]] [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]], [[shortstop]] [[Barry Larkin]], and [[first baseman]] [[Sean Casey (baseball)|Sean Casey]]. Although attendance improved considerably with the new ballpark, the team continued to lose. Schott had not invested much in the farm system since the early 1990s, leaving the team relatively thin on talent. After years of promises that the club was rebuilding toward the opening of the new ballpark, General Manager [[Jim Bowden]] and manager [[Bob Boone]] were fired on July 28. This broke up the father-son combo of manager Bob Boone and [[third baseman]] [[Aaron Boone]], and Aaron was soon traded to the [[New York Yankees]]. Following the season [[Dan O'Brien (baseball executive)|Dan O'Brien]] was hired as the Reds' 16th General Manager.

The {{by|2004}} and {{by|2005}} seasons continued the trend of big hitting, poor pitching, and poor records. Griffey, Jr. joined the 500-home run club in 2004, but was again hampered by injuries. [[Adam Dunn]] emerged as consistent home run hitter, including a {{convert|535|ft|m|sing=on}} home run against [[Jose Lima]]. He also broke the major league record for [[strikeouts]] in 2004. Although a number of [[free agent]]s were signed before 2005, the Reds were quickly in last place and manager [[Dave Miley]] was forced out in the [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005 midseason]] and replaced by [[Jerry Narron]]. Like many other small market clubs, the Reds dispatched some of their veteran players and began entrusting their future to a young nucleus that included [[Adam Dunn]] and [[Austin Kearns]]. 

Late summer 2004 saw the opening of the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. The Reds HOF had been in existence in name only since the 1950s, with player plaques, photos and other memorabilia scattered throughout their front offices. Ownership and management desired a stand-alone facility, where the public could walk through inter-active displays, see locker room recreations, watch videos of classic Reds moments and peruse historical items. The first floor houses a movie theater which resembles an older, ivy-covered brick wall ballyard.  The hallways contain many vintage photographs. The rear of the building features a three-story wall containing a baseball for every hit [[Pete Rose]] had during his career. The third floor contains interactive exhibits including a pitcher's mound, radio booth, and children's area where the fundamentals of baseball are taught by former Reds player videos.

For Opening Day 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] threw out the [[ceremonial first pitch]], becoming the first sitting [[President of the United States|president]] to throw out the first pitch at a Reds game. [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006]] also began a new era in Reds baseball as fruit and vegetable wholesaler [[Robert Castellini]] took over as controlling owner from Lindner. Castellini promptly fired general manager Dan O'Brien. [[Wayne Krivsky]], previously an assistant General Manager with the [[Minnesota Twins]], was appointed as the General Manager after a protracted search. The first move Krivsky made was to trade young outfielder [[Wily Mo Peña]] to the [[Boston Red Sox]] for pitcher [[Bronson Arroyo]]. Arroyo made his first start in a Reds uniform on April 5, 2006. He not only earned the win, but also led off the third inning with his first career home run. Krivsky also gave fans hope with mid season trades that bolstered the bullpen, trading for [[Eddie Guardado|&quot;Everyday Eddie&quot; Guardado]] and then trading outfielder [[Austin Kearns]], shortstop [[Felipe López (baseball)|Felipe López]], and [[2004 Major League Baseball draft|2004 first round draft pick]] [[Ryan Wagner]] to the [[Washington Nationals]] for relievers [[Gary Majewski]], [[Bill Bray]], shortstop [[Royce Clayton]], and two prospects. This move was controversial, as not only did it seem as if the Reds did not receive much in return for two starting position players and a former first-round draft pick, but also it was later discovered that the Nationals may have hidden Majewski's health problems. The Reds made a run at the playoffs but ultimately fell short.

The [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007 season]] was again mired in mediocrity. Midway through the season Jerry Narron was fired as manager and replaced by [[Pete Mackanin]], an advance scout for the club. The Reds ended up posting a winning record under Mackanin, but finished the season in 5th place in the Central Division. Mackanin was manager in an interim capacity only, and the Reds, seeking a big name to fill the spot, ultimately brought in [[Dusty Baker]].  Early in the [[2008 Major League Baseball season|2008 season]], Wayne Krivsky was fired and replaced by former St. Louis Cardinals general manager [[Walt Jocketty]], who helped build the [[2006 World Series|2006 World Champion]] [[2006 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]]. Jocketty had been added by Castellini in the offseason in an advisory role, and after another poor start by the Reds, took the reins of general manager. Though the Reds did not win under Krivsky, he is credited with revamping the farm system and signing young talent that could potentially lead the Reds to success in the future.

The Reds failed to post winning records in both 2008 and 2009 but added/developed many key players in those seasons that would facilitate an incredible run at the NL Central Division Championship in 2010.  Under the leadership of [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|2010 NL MVP]] [[Joey Votto]] and [[Gold Glove]]rs [[Brandon Phillips]] and [[Scott Rolen]] the Reds posted a 91-71 record for a season that included many memorable moments.  The Reds came from behind to win in over 40 games, many in their final at-bat, and the pitching from the likes of [[Bronson Arroyo]], [[Johnny Cueto]], [[Edinson Volquez]] and rookies [[Mike Leake]] and [[Travis Wood]], (who threw 8 innings of perfect baseball in one outing), was nothing short of stellar all season.  On August 10, 2010, the Reds had a highly publicized brawl with the St. Louis Cardinals at Great American Ballpark predicated by derogatory comments made by Brandon Phillips concerning the Cardinals. The scuffle lasted for several minutes before it was broken up and play continued.  The long term results of the incident were career ending injuries to Cardinals backup catcher (and former Red) [[Jason LaRue]], a 7-game suspension for Johnny Cueto, and fines for several others. From this point forward, there has been a developing bitter rivalry between the two teams.

On Tuesday, September 28, 2010, right-fielder Jay Bruce led off the bottom of the 9th inning in Great American Ballpark with a solo home run to give the Reds a 3-2 victory over Houston. Also keeping the Reds in the game was a 3rd inning over-the-wall catch by center-fielder  Drew Stubbs that blocked a potential two-run homer.&lt;ref&gt;http://cincinnati.com/blogs/reds/2010/09/28/astros-2-reds-1-after-2/&lt;/ref&gt; The victory clinched the National League Central championship for the Reds and earned the team its first playoff appearance in 15 seasons. [[Jay Bruce]] became only the fifth player in MLB history to hit a walk-off home run to clinch a playoff spot for his team. The following week, the Reds became only the second team in MLB history to be no-hit in a postseason game when Philadelphia's Roy Halladay shut down the National League's number one offense in game one of the NLDS.&lt;ref&gt;http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2010_10_06_cinmlb_phimlb_1&amp;mode=gameday&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 10, 2010 the Reds lost 2-0 to the Phillies resulting in a 3 game sweep of the NLDS for Philadelphia.

==Ballpark==
{{Main|Great American Ballpark}}
The Cincinnati Reds play their homes games at Great American Ballpark, located on 100 Joe Nuxhall Way, in downtown Cincinnati.  Great American Ballpark opened in 2003 at the cost of $290 million and has a capacity of 42,271.  Along with serving as the home field for the Reds, Great American Ballpark also holds the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame.  The Hall of Fame was added as a part of Reds tradition  allowing fans to walk through the history of the franchise as well as participating in many interactive baseball features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/cin/ballpark/museum/index.jsp]&lt;/ref&gt;

Great American Ballpark is the seventh home of the Cincinnati Reds, built on the site which [[Riverfront Stadium]], later named Cinergy Field, once was.  The first ballpark the Reds occupied was [[Bank Street Grounds]] from 1882–1883 unit they moved to [[League Park I (Cincinnati)|League Park I]] 1884, where they would remain until 1893.  Through the late 1890s and early 1900s, the Reds moved to two different parks where they stayed from less than ten years.  [[League Park II (Cincinnati)|League Park II]] was the third home field for the Reds from 1894–1901, and then moved to the [[Palace of the Fans]] which served as the home of the Reds in the 1910s.  It was in 1912 that the Reds moved to [[Crosley Field]] which they called home for fifty-eight years.  Crosley served as the home field for the Reds under two [[World Series]] titles, five [[National League]] pennants, and many division titles.  After 1970 and during the dynasty of the Big Red Machine, the Reds moved to [[Riverfront Stadium]], appropriately named due it location right by the [[Ohio River]].  Riverfront saw three World Series titles and five national league pennants.  It was in the late 1990s that the city agreed to build two separate stadiums on the riverfront for the Reds and the [[Cincinnati Bengals]].  Thus, in 2003, the Reds began a new era with the opening of the current stadium. 

The Reds hold their spring training in [[Goodyear, Arizona]] at [[Goodyear Ballpark]].  The Reds moved into this stadium and the Cactus League in 2010 after staying in the Grapefruit League for most of their history.  The Reds share Goodyear Park with their rivals in [[Ohio]], the [[Cleveland Indians]].

==Rivalries==
===Cleveland Indians===
{{Main|Ohio Cup}}

The '''Ohio Cup''' was an annual [[spring training|pre-season]] [[baseball]] game, which pitted the [[Ohio]] rivals [[Cleveland Indians]] and Cincinnati Reds.

In its first series it was a single-game cup, played each year at minor-league [[Cooper Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]], was staged just days before the start of each new [[Major League Baseball]] season. A total of eight Ohio Cup games were played, in 1989 to 1996, with the Indians winning six of them. It stopped because [[interleague play]] started in 1997. The winner of the game each year was awarded the Ohio Cup in postgame ceremonies. The Ohio Cup was a favorite among baseball fans in Columbus, with attendances regularly topping 15,000.

In 1997 and  after, the two teams competed annually in the regular-season Battle of Ohio or Buckeye Series.  In 2008 the Ohio Cup restarted.

The Indians currently lead the interleague series 36&amp;ndash;35.  &lt;!-- through 2011 season --&gt;

===Historical Rivalries===
====Pittsburgh Pirates====

The Reds had an intense rivalry with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] throughout the 1970s.  The two teams met in the [[National League Championship Series]] four times, with the Reds winning three times in [[1970 NLCS|1970]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1970.shtml|title=1970 National League Team Statistics and Standings|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1972 NLCS|1972]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1972.shtml|title=1972 National League Team Statistics and Standings|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[1975 NLCS|1975]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1975.shtml|title=1975 National League Team Statistics and Standings|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Pirates winning in [[1979 NLCS|1979]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1979.shtml|title=1979 National League Team Statistics and Standings|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the two teams met for a fifth time in the [[1990 NLCS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1990.shtml|title=1990 National League Team Statistics and Standings|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the Reds also won, bringing their total record against the Pirates in the NLCS to 4-1.  This is tied with the Phillies-Dodgers for the most times any two teams have met in the NLCS.

==Media==
{{See also|Cincinnati Reds Radio Network|List of Cincinnati Reds broadcasters}}

===Radio===
The Reds' [[flagship]] [[radio station]] has been [[WLW]], 700AM since 1969.  Prior to that, the Reds were heard over:  WKRC, WCPO, WSAI and WCKY. WLW, a 50,000-watt station, is &quot;[[Clear-channel stations|clear channel]]&quot; in more than one way, as [[Clear Channel Communications]] owns the &quot;blowtorch&quot; outlet which is also known as &quot;The Nation's Station&quot;. 

[[Marty Brennaman]] has been the Reds' play-by-play voice since 1974 and has won the [[Ford C. Frick Award]] for his work, which includes his famous call of &quot;...and this one belongs to the Reds!&quot; after a win. Joining him for years on color was former Reds pitcher [[Joe Nuxhall]], who worked in the radio booth from 1967 (the year after his retirement as an active player) until 2004, plus three more seasons doing select home games until his passing, in 2007.

In 2007, [[Thom Brennaman]], a veteran announcer seen nationwide on [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]], joined his father [[Marty Brennaman|Marty]] in the radio booth. retired relief pitcher [[Jeff Brantley]], formerly of ESPN, also joined the network in 2007. As of 2010, Brantley and Thom Brennaman's increased TV schedule (see below) has led to more appearances for [[Jim Kelch]], who had filled in on the network since 2008.

===Television===
Televised games are seen exclusively on [[FSN Ohio]] (in Cincinnati, Dayton, Columbus and Kentucky) and [[FSN Indiana]]. [[George Grande]], who hosted the first ''[[SportsCenter]]'' on [[ESPN]] in 1979, was the [[play-by-play]] announcer from 1993 until his retirement during the final game of the '09 season, usually alongside [[Chris Welsh]]. Grande returned in 2009 and 2010, to work part time for the Reds when no play-by-play announcer was available. Thom Brennaman has been the head play-by-play commentator since 2010, and Welsh and Brantley, share time as the color commentator. [[Paul Keels]], the current radio play-by-play announcer for [[Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]] [[Ohio State Buckeyes|Buckeyes]] Radio Network, served as the Reds backup play-by-play television announcer for 2010. [[Jim Kelch]] will replace Keels for the 2011 season, The Reds also added former Cincinnati First Baseman [[Sean Casey]] to do color commentary for 15 games in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20110114&amp;content_id=16436490&amp;vkey=pr_cin&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cin&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NBC]] affiliate [[WLWT]] carried Reds games from 1948&amp;ndash;1995. Among those that have called games for WLWT include [[Waite Hoyt]], [[Ray Lane]], [[Steve Physioc]], [[Johnny Bench]], [[Joe Morgan]], and [[Ken Wilson (sportscaster)|Ken Wilson]]. [[Al Michaels]], legendary NBC sportscaster spent a year in Cincinnati before being drafted by NBC. [[WSTR-TV]] aired games from 1996–1998, and the Reds have not broadcast games over-the-air on a regular basis since then. However, a few games, including one against state rival [[Cleveland Indians]], were aired on [[Fox Network]] during the 2008 season. In 2010, [[WKRC]] simulcast the [[FSN Ohio]] feed for Opening Day; it was the first game broadcast locally over-the-air since Opening Day 2002.

===DVD===
On June 8, 2010, [[Shout! Factory]] released ''Reds Memories: The Greatest Moments in Cincinnati Reds History'' on DVD. In 2006, Major League Baseball released the Reds' 1975 World Series victory over the Boston Red Sox on DVD.

'''[[Caribbean]] cuisine''' is a fusion of [[African cuisine|African]], [[Amerindian cuisine|Amerindian]], [[British cuisine|British]], [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]], [[French cuisine|French]], [[Dutch cuisine|Dutch]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], and [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] cuisine. These traditions were brought from the many homelands of this region's population. In addition, the population has created styles that are unique to the region.

A local version of Caribbean goat stew has been chosen as the official national dish of [[Montserrat]] and is also one of the signature dishes of [[St. Kitts and Nevis]]. It is a [[tomato]]-based stew, made with goat meat, [[breadfruit]], green pawpaw ([[papaya]]), and dumplings (also known as &quot;droppers&quot;). Another popular dish in the Anglophone Caribbean is called &quot;Cook-up&quot;, or Pelau, a dish which combines variations of meats like chicken, beef, saltfish and or [[pigeon pea]]s or vegetables with rice. [[Callaloo]] is a dish containing leafy vegetables and sometimes [[okra]] amongst others, widely distributed in the Caribbean, with a distinctively mixed African and indigenous character.



==Dessert==
In some areas [[Black Cake]], a derivative of English Christmas pudding may be served, especially on special occasions.

The '''Central Powers''' ([[German language|German]]: '''''Mittelmächte'''''; [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: '''''Központi hatalmak'''''; [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: '''''İttifak Devletleri''''' or '''''Bağlaşma Devletleri'''''; [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: '''''Централни сили''''') was one of the two sides that participated in [[World War I]] and was also known as the '''[[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]''', the other being the [[Allies of World War I|Triple Entente (Allied Powers)]]. It was made up of the [[German Empire]], the [[Austria–Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]].

==Member states==
The Central Powers consisted of the [[German Empire]], the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the Kingdom of Bulgaria. The name &quot;Central Powers&quot; is derived from the location of these countries; all four were located between the [[Russian Empire]] in the east and [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in the west.

==Italy==
On 7 October 1879, Germany and Austria-Hungary became allies and formed the Dual Alliance. On 20 May 1882, they were joined by the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] in what was known as the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. This alliance was intended to be limited to defensive purposes only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.byu.edu/~rdh/wwi/1914m/tripally.html The Triple Alliance (First 8 Articles)] The World War I Document Archive, Brigham Young University Library, accessed 2008-04-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.dickinson.edu/~rhyne/232/Six/Triple_Alliance_1882.html Triple Alliance, 1882] Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania, accessed 2008-04-21&lt;/ref&gt; 

When [[World War I]] began, the petition made by Germany and Austria-Hungary for Italian intervention was rejected by the Italian Government on the grounds of these two countries declaring war on the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], rather than taking defensive action against it. 

Italy eventually entered World War I on May 23, 1915, but it fought against Germany and Austria-Hungary rather than with them, because of the land promised them in the Treaty of London made with France and Britain. This treaty promised Italy the Italian-speaking lands of Austria-Hungary and territories in Asia Minor, Africa and the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Lynn.  The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures. 3. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin’s in 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria==
{{main|Bulgaria during World War I|}}
Following the outbreak of war in [[Europe]] during August 1914, the Ottoman Empire intervened at the end of October by taking action against Russia, resulting in declarations of war by the [[Triple Entente]].

Bulgaria, still resentful after its [[Second Balkan War|defeat]] in July 1913 at the hands of Serbia, [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and the Ottoman Empire, was the last nation to enter the war against the Allies, invading Serbia in conjunction with [[German Army (German Empire)|German]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian forces]] in October 1915.

==Other movements==
{{main|Irish Republican Brotherhood|Hindu–German Conspiracy|Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition|Polish Legions in World War I|Kingdom of Finland (1918)|Kingdom of Lithuania (1918)|Ukrainian State|Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (1918)|Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus}}
{{see also|Zimmermann Telegram}}
Other movements supported the efforts of the Central Powers for their own reasons, such as the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood|Irish Nationalists]] who launched the [[Easter Rising]] in [[Dublin]] in April 1916; they referred to their &quot;gallant allies in Europe&quot;. In 1914 [[Józef Piłsudski]] was permitted by the Rebel Alliance to form independent [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish legions]]. Piłsudski wanted his legions to help the Central Powers defeat Russia and then side with France and the UK and win the war with them. During the years 1917 and 1918, the [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finns]] under [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|C.G.E. Mannerheim]] and the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] and [[Lithuania]]n nationalists fought Russia for a [[Co-belligerence|common cause]]. The Ottoman Empire also had its own allies in [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]] and the [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus|Northern Caucasus]]. The three nations fought alongside each other under the [[Ottoman Army of Islam|Army of Islam]] in the [[Battle of Baku]].

[[Image:WorldWarI-MilitaryDeaths-CentralPowers-Piechart.svg|thumb|right|Military deaths of the Central Powers.]]

==Armistice and treaties==
Bulgaria signed an [[armistice]] with the Allies on 29 September 1918, following a successful Allied advance in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The Ottoman Empire followed suit on 30 October 1918 in the face of British and [[Arab]] gains in [[Palestine]] and [[Syria]]. [[German Austria|Austria]] and [[Hungarian Democratic Republic|Hungary]] concluded ceasefires separately during the first week of November following the disintegration of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] and the Italian offensive at [[Vittorio Veneto]]; Germany signed the armistice ending the war on the morning of 11 November 1918 after the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], and a succession of advances by [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]]n, [[Canada|Canadian]], [[Belgium|Belgian]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]], [[France|French]] and [[United States|US]] forces in north-eastern France and Belgium. There was no unified treaty ending the war; the Central Powers were dealt with in separate treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Conservatism}}

'''Conservatism''' ({{lang-la|conservare}}, &quot;to preserve&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Davies, N, 'Europe: A History', (Pimlico:London,1997) p.812&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[political philosophy|political]] and [[social philosophy]] that promotes the maintenance of traditional institutions and supports, at the most, minimal and gradual change in society. Some conservatives seek to preserve things as they are, emphasizing stability and continuity, while others oppose modernism and seek a return to the way things were.&lt;ref&gt;Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, &quot;Conservatism&quot;, ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', Third Edition, &quot;Sometimes it (conservatism) has been outright opposition, based on an existing model of society that is considered right for all time.  It can take a 'reactionary' form, harking back to, and attempting to reconstruct, forms of society which existed in an earlier period.&quot;, Oxford University Press, 2009, ISBN 978019205165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/133435/conservatism|title=Conservatism (political philosophy)|publisher=Britannica.com}} Retrieved on 1&amp;nbsp;November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The first established use of the term in a political context was by [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] in 1819, following the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/articles/43075.html The Scary Echo of the Intolerance of the French Revolution in America Today]&lt;/ref&gt; The term has since been used to describe a wide range of views.

[[Political science]] often credits the [[Ireland|Irish]] politician [[Edmund Burke]] (who served in the British House of Commons and opposed the [[French Revolution]]) with many of the ideas now called ''conservative''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/burke_edmund.shtml BBC: Edmund Burke (1729 - 1797)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Hailsham]], a former chairman of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], &quot;Conservatism is not so much a philosophy as an attitude, a constant force, performing a timeless function in the development of a free society, and corresponding to a deep and permanent requirement of human nature itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Viscount Hailsham. ''The Conservative Case''. Middlesex: Penguin Books, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Eccleshall states, &quot;It is the persistent image of society as a command structure in which the responsibilities of leadership can be exercised within the framework of a strong state manifested in divine-right royalism ... that distinguishes English conservatism from rival ideologies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eccleshall, pp. 3, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservative political parties]] include the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the United States, the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] in Japan, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the United Kingdom, the [[Liberal Party of Australia]], the [[Kuomintang]] of the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], the [[Pakistan Muslim League]] in Pakistan, and the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] in India.

==Development of Western conservatism==
===English conservatism===
English conservatism, which was called [[Toryism]], emerged during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] (1660–1688). It supported a hierarchical society with a monarch who ruled by [[Divine right of kings|divine right]]. However the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688), which established constitutional government, led to a reformulation of Toryism which now considered sovereignty vested in the three estates of Crown, Lords, and Commons.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleshall, p. ix, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

According to conservative historians, [[Richard Hooker]] was the founding father of conservatism, the [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]] is commended for his pragmatism, [[David Hume]] is commended for his conservative mistrust of rationalism in politics, and [[Edmund Burke]] is considered the leading early theorist. They have, however, been accused of selectivity in choosing writers who present a moderate and defensible view of conservatism. For example, Hooker lived before the emergence of conservatism, Halifax did not belong to any party, Hume was not involved in politics, and Burke was a [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]]. In the 19th century, Conservatives rejected Burke because of his defense of Catholic emancipation, and found inspiration in [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]] instead. [[John Reeves]], who wrote a Tory response to the French Revolution, is ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleshall, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatives also objected to Burke's support of the American Revolution, which the Tory [[Samuel Johnson]], for example, attacked in &quot;[[Samuel Johnson|Taxation No Tyranny]]&quot;.

Conservatism developed in [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] England from [[Cavalier|royalism]]. Royalists supported absolute monarchy, arguing that the sovereign governed by [[Divine right of kings|divine right]]. They opposed the theory that sovereignty derived from the people, the authority of parliament and freedom of religion. [[Robert Filmer]]’s ''Patriarcha: or the Natural Power of Kings'', which had been written before the [[English Civil War]], became accepted as the statement of their doctrine. Following the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, the conservatives, known as [[Tory (British political party)|Tories]], accepted that the three estates of Crown, Lords, and Commons held sovereignty jointly.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleshall, pp. 21-25&lt;/ref&gt; However Toryism became marginalized during the long period of Whig ascendency.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleshall, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The party, which was renamed the Conservative Party in the 1830s, returned as a major political force after becoming home to both paternalistic aristocrats and free market capitalists in an uneasy alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleshall, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edmund Burke]] was the private secretary to the Marquis of Rockingham and official pamphlateer to the Rockingham branch of the Whig Party.&lt;ref&gt;Stanlis, Peter J. ''Edmund Burke: selected writings and speeches''. New York: Transaction Publishers (2009), p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the Tories, they were the conservatives in the late 18th century United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, M. Morton ''The Conservative Illusion''. Columbia University Press (1959), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's views were a mixture of liberal and conservative, with the crucial caveat that the meaning of these terms in this time period was markedly different from popular conceptions of the present day. He supported the [[American Revolution]] but abhored the violence of the [[French Revolution]]. He accepted the liberal ideals of private property and the economics of Adam Smith, but thought that economics should be kept subordinate to the conservative social ethic, that capitalism should be subordinate to the medieval social tradition and that the business class should be subordinate to aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, M. Morton ''The conservative illusion.'' Columbia University Press (1959), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; He insisted on standards of honor derived from the medieval aristocratic tradition, and saw the aristocracy as the nation's natural leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, M. Morton ''The Conservative Illusion''. Columbia University Press (1959) ,p.37&lt;/ref&gt; That meant limits on the powers of the Crown, since he found the institutions of Parliament to be better informed than commissions appointed by the executive.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, M. Morton ''The conservative illusion''. Columbia University Press (1959), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; He favored an [[established church]], but allowed for a degree of [[religious toleration]].&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, M. Morton ''The conservative illusion''. Columbia University Press (1959), pp. 53-54&lt;/ref&gt; Burke justified the social order on the basis of tradition: tradition represented the wisdom of the species and he valued community and social harmony over social reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, M. Morton ''The conservative illusion.'' Columbia University Press (1959), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Edmund Burke2.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797)]]

In the 19th century, conflict between wealthy businessmen and the aristocracy split the British conservative movement, with the aristocracy calling for a return to medieval ideas while the business classes called for laissez-faire capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, M. Morton ''The conservative illusion.'' Columbia University Press (1959), pp. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

Although conservatives opposed attempts to allow greater representation of the middle class in parliament, in 1834 they conceded that electoral reform could not be reversed and promised to support further reforms so long as they did not erode the institutions of church and state. These new principles were presented in the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] which is considered by historians to be the basic statement of the beliefs of the new Conservative Party.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleshall, pp. 79-80&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conservatives lamented the passing of a pastoral world where the ethos of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' had promoted respect from the lower classes. They saw the [[Anglican Church]] and the aristocracy as balances against commercial wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleshall, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; They worked toward legislation for improved working conditions and urban housing.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleshall, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint would later be called [[Tory Democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Eccleshall, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; However since Burke there has always been tension between traditional aristocratic conservatism and the wealthy business class.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleshall, p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century, the traditional business supporters of the UK [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] had joined the Conservatives, making them the party of business and commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Feuchtwanger, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, conservatism developed after the Second World War when [[Russell Kirk]] and other writers identified an American conservative tradition based on the ideas of Edmund Burke. However many writers do not accept American conservatism as genuine and consider it to be a variety of liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;''The conservative political tradition in Britain and the United States'' Arthur Aughey, Greta Jones, W. T. M. Riches, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press (1992) pp. 1-31&lt;/ref&gt;

===French conservatism===
{{Main|Latin Conservatism}}
{{Expand section|date=September 2010}}
Another form of conservatism developed in France in parallel to conservatism in Britain. It was influenced by [[Counter-Enlightenment]] works by men such as [[Joseph de Maistre]] and [[Louis de Bonald]]. French conservatism was less pragmatic and more [[reactionary]] than the conservatism of Burke.

Eventually conservatives added [[patriotism]] and [[nationalism]] to the list of traditional values they support. German conservatives were the first to embrace nationalism, which was previously associated with [[liberalism]] and the Revolution in France.&lt;ref&gt;ams, Ian Political Ideology Today (2nd edition), Manchester University Press, 2002, pg. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, movements that use the name &quot;conservative&quot; have a wide variety of views.

==Variants==
===Liberal conservatism===
[[Liberal conservatism]] is a variant of conservatism that combines conservative values and policies with classical [[Liberalism|liberal]] stances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=xGNRRwkZFysC&amp;pg=PA109 Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science]  Ellen Grigsby, Cengage Learning, 2008
ISBN 978-0-495-50112-1, 9780495501121 pp. 108, 109, 112, 347&lt;/ref&gt; As these latter two terms have had different meanings over time and across countries, liberal conservatism also has a wide variety of meanings. Historically, the term often referred to the combination of [[Liberal theory of economics|economic liberalism]], which champions [[laissez-faire]] markets, with the classical conservatism concern for established [[tradition]], respect for authority and religious values. It contrasted itself with [[classical liberalism]], which supported [[Individual freedom|freedom for the individual]] in both the economic and social spheres.

Over time, the general conservative ideology in many countries adopted economic liberal arguments, and the term ''liberal conservatism'' was replaced with ''conservatism''. This is also the case in countries where liberal economic ideas have been the tradition, such as the United States, and are thus considered conservative. In other countries where liberal conservative movements have entered the political mainstream, such as [[Italy]] and [[Spain]], the terms ''liberal'' and ''conservative'' may be synonymous. The liberal conservative tradition in the United States combines the economic [[individualism]] of the classical liberals with a [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] form of conservatism (which has also become part of the [[American conservatism|American conservative]] tradition, such as in the writings of [[Russell Kirk]]).

A secondary meaning for the term ''liberal conservatism'' that has developed in [[Europe]] is a combination of more modern conservative (less traditionalist) views with those of [[social liberalism]]. This has developed as an opposition to the more [[collectivist]] views of [[socialism]]. Often this involves stressing what are now conservative views of free-market economics and belief in individual responsibility, with social liberal views on defence of [[civil rights]], [[environmentalism]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. This philosophy is that of [[Sweden|Swedish]] Prime Minister [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]]. In continental Europe, this is sometimes also translated into [[English language|English]] as [[social conservatism]].

===Conservative liberalism===
[[Conservative liberalism]] is a variant of [[liberalism]] that combines liberal values and policies with conservative stances, or, more simply, the right wing of the liberal movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm Ipolitique.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parties-and-elections.de/contents.html Parties-and-elections.de]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mair&quot;&gt;[[Michael Gallagher (academic)|M. Gallagher]], M. Laver and [[Peter Mair|P. Mair]], ''Representative Government in Europe'', p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of conservative liberalism are found at the beginning of the [[History of liberal thought|history of liberalism]]. Until the two [[World Wars]], in most European countries the political class was formed by conservative liberals, from [[Germany]] to [[Italy]]. The events such as [[World War I]] occurring after 1917 brought the more radical version of classical liberalism to a more conservative (i.e. more moderate) type of liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Allen R.T., ''Beyond Liberalism'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libertarian conservatism===
{{Main|Libertarian conservatism}}
[[Libertarian conservatism]] describes certain political ideologies within the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] which combines [[libertarian]] economic issues with aspects of conservatism. Its five main branches are [[Constitutionalism]], [[paleolibertarianism]], neolibertarianism, [[American conservatism|small government conservatism]] and [[Christian libertarianism]]. They generally differ from [[paleoconservatives]], in that they are in favor of more [[liberty|personal]] and [[economic freedom]].

[[Agorist]]s such as [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]] labeled libertarian conservatism [[right-libertarianism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nlm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=New Libertarian Manifesto|url=http://agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;int&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview With Samuel Edward Konkin III|url=http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/software/konkin-interview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to [[paleoconservative]]s, libertarian conservatives support strict [[laissez-faire]] policies such as [[free trade]], opposition to any national bank and opposition to [[regulations|business regulations]]. They are vehemently opposed to [[environmental regulation]]s, [[corporate welfare]], [[subsidies]], and other areas of economic intervention. Many of them have views in accord to [[Ludwig von Mises]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} However, many of them oppose [[abortion]], as they see it as a [[positive liberty]] and violates the [[non-aggression principle]] because abortion is aggression towards the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/vance/vance133.html|title=Is Ron Paul Wrong on Abortion?|last=Vance|first=Laurence |date=January 29, 2008|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiscal conservatism===
[[Fiscal conservatism]] is the economic philosophy of prudence in government spending and debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=B10JkvO82x8C&amp;pg=PA109 Correctional organization and management: public policy challenges, behavior, and structure] Robert M. Freeman, Elsevier, 1999  ISBN 978-0-7506-9897-9, 9780750698979 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Edmund Burke, in his '[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]', argued that a government does not have the right to run up large debts and then throw the burden on the taxpayer:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...[I]t is to the property of the citizen, and not to the demands of the creditor of the state, that the first and original faith of civil society is pledged. The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, superior in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether possessed by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation in the goods of some community, were no part of the creditor's security, expressed or implied...[T]he public, whether represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Green conservatism===
[[Green conservatism]] is a term used to refer to conservatives who have incorporated [[Green politics|green]] concerns into their [[ideology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=qiSp-MuGjZkC&amp;pg=PA124 Beyond the New Right] John Gray, Routledge, 1995 ISBN 978-0-415-10706-8, 9780415107068]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first uses of the term ''green conservatism'' was by former United States [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]], in a debate on environmental issues with [[John Kerry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=20393&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1&amp;gd=04232007 We Can Have Green Conservatism - And We Should - HUMAN EVENTS].

Retrieved February 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, the green conservative movement was sometimes referred to as the ''crunchy con'' movement, a term popularized by ''[[National Review]]'' magazine and the writings of [[Rod Dreher]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DreherCC&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The Conservative Party in the United Kingdom under David Cameron has embraced a green agenda:{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, including a tax on workplace car parking spaces, a halt to airport growth, a tax on gas-guzzling 4x4s and restrictions on car advertising. The measures were suggested by The Quality of Life Policy Group, which was set up by Cameron to help fight climate change{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

===Cultural and social conservatism===
{{Main|Cultural conservatism|social conservatism}}
Cultural conservatives support the preservation of the heritage of one nation, or of a shared culture that is not defined by national boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=RbwDNb5jtzUC&amp;printsec=frontcover Cultural conservatism, political liberalism: from criticism to cultural studies ] James Seaton, University of Michigan Press, 1996 ISBN 978-0-472-10645-5, 9780472106455]&lt;/ref&gt; The shared culture may be as divergent as [[Western culture]] or [[Chinese culture]]. In the United States, the term ''cultural conservative'' may imply a conservative position in the [[culture war]]. Cultural conservatives hold fast to traditional ways of thinking even in the face of monumental change. They believe strongly in traditional values and traditional politics, and often have an urgent sense of nationalism.

Social conservatism is distinct from cultural conservatism, although there are some overlaps. Social conservatives believe that the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing what they consider traditional values or behaviors. A social conservative wants to preserve traditional morality and social mores, often through civil law or regulation. Social change is generally regarded as suspect.

A second meaning of the term ''social conservatism'' developed in the [[Nordic countries]] and [[continental Europe]]. There it refers to [[liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]] supporting modern European [[welfare state]]s.

Social conservatives (in the first meaning of the word) in many countries generally favor the [[pro-life]] position in the [[abortion controversy]] and oppose public funding of [[embryonic stem cell]] research; oppose both [[eugenics]] (inheritable genetic modification) and [[human enhancement]] ([[transhumanism]]) while supporting [[bioconservatism]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utne.com/2005-01-01/TheNextDigitalDivide.aspx?page=2 The Next Digital Divide] (utne article)&lt;/ref&gt; support a traditional definition of marriage as being one man and one woman; view the [[nuclear family]] model as society's foundational unit; oppose expansion of [[civil marriage]] and [[child adoption]] rights to couples in [[same-sex relationship]]s; promote [[public morality]] and traditional [[family values]]; oppose [[secularism]] and privatization of religious belief; support the prohibition of [[Prohibition (drugs)|drugs]], [[prostitution]], [[premarital sex]], [[extramarital sex|non-marital sex]] and [[euthanasia]]; and support the [[censorship]] of [[pornography]] and what they consider to be [[obscenity]] or [[indecency]].

===Religious conservatism===
{{See also|Religious right (disambiguation)| Christian Right|Fundamentalist Islam}}
Religious conservatives principally seek to apply the teachings of particular religions to politics, sometimes by merely proclaiming the value of those teachings, at other times by having those teachings influence laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=LP9bIrZ9xacC&amp;pg=PA469 Sociology: understanding a diverse society ] Margaret L. Andersen, Howard Francis Taylor , Cengage Learning, 2005 ISBN 978-0-534-61716-5, 9780534617165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservatism in different countries==
{{further|[[right-wing]] and [[political spectrum]]}}
Conservative political parties vary widely from country to country in the goals they wish to achieve. Both conservative and liberal parties tend to favor private ownership of property, in opposition to communist, socialist and green parties, which favor communal ownership or laws requiring social responsibility on the part of property owners. Where conservatives and liberals differ is primarily on social issues. Conservatives tend to reject behavior that does not conform to some social norm. For many years, conservative parties fought to stop extension of voting rights to groups such as to non-Christians, non-whites and women. Modern conservative parties often define themselves by their opposition to liberal or labour parties. The United States usage of the term ''conservative'' is unique to that country.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan. ''Political Parties and Party Systems''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. ISBN 978-0-19-878076-2, pp. 31-33&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alan Ware, Belgium, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK retained viable conservative parties into the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan. ''Political Parties and Party Systems''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. ISBN 978-0-19-878076-2&lt;/ref&gt; Ware said that Australia, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malta, New Zealand, Spain and the US had no conservative parties, although they had either Christian Democrats or liberals as major right-wing parties. Canada, Ireland, and Portugal had right-wing political parties that defied categorization: the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]]; [[Fianna Fáil]], [[Fine Gael]], and [[Progressive Democrats]] in Ireland; and the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] of Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan. ''Political Parties and Party Systems''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. ISBN 978-0-19-878076-2, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the [[Swiss People's Party]] has moved to the extreme right and is no longer considered to be conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Flecker, Jörg.

[[Klaus von Beyme]], who developed the method of party categorization, found that no modern Eastern European parties could be considered conservative, although the communist and communist-successor parties had strong similarities.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Paul G. ''Political parties in post-communist Eastern Europe''. Routledge, 2000. ISBN 978-0-415-20182-7 pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, which was united by liberals and radicals (''[[risorgimento]]''), liberals not conservatives emerged as the party of the Right.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Denis Mack. ''Modern Italy: a political history''.  University of Michigan Press, 1997. ISBN 978-0-472-10895-4 p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In the Netherlands, conservatives merged into a new Christian democratic party in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Daalder, Hans and  Irwin, Galen A. ''Politics in the Netherlands: how much change?'' Routledge, 1989. ISBN 07146336 pp. 154-157&lt;/ref&gt; In Austria, Germany, Portugal and Spain, conservatism was transformed into and incorporated into fascism or the [[far right]].&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn, Martin. ''Fascists and conservatives''. Routledge, 1990.  p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, all Japanese parties were merged into a single fascist party.

[[Louis Hartz]] explained the absence of conservatism in Australia or the United States as a result of their settlement as radical or liberal fragments of Great Britain. Although he said English Canada had a negligible conservative influence, subsequent writers claimed that [[United Empire Loyalist|loyalists]] opposed to the American Revolution brought a Tory ideology into Canada. Hartz explained conservatism in Quebec and Latin America as a result of their settlement as feudal societies.&lt;ref&gt;Fierlbeck, Katherine. ''Political thought in Canada: an intellectual history''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2006. ISBN 978-1-55111-711-9 pp.87-88&lt;/ref&gt; The American conservative writer [[Russell Kirk]] provided the opinion that conservatism had been brought to the US and interpreted the American revolution as a &quot;conservative revolution&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Russell. ''The Conservative Mind''. Washington, DC: Regnery Publishing, 2001. ISBN 978-0-89526-171-7, 2001. ISBN 978-0-89526-171-7 p. 6, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative elites have long dominated Latin American nations. Mostly this has been achieved through control of and support for civil institutions, the church and the armed forces, rather than through party politics. Typically the church was exempt from taxes and its employees immune from civil prosecution. Where national conservative parties were weak or non-existent, conservatives were more likely to rely on military dictatorship as a preferred form of government. However in some nations where the elites were able to mobilize popular support for conservative parties, longer periods of political stability were achieved. Chile, Colombia and Venezuela are examples of nations that developed strong conservative parties. Argentina, Brazil, El Salvador and Peru are examples of nations where this did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Middlebrook, Kevin J. ''Conservative parties, the right, and democracy in Latin America''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000 ISBN 978-0-8018-6386-8 p. 1-52&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative Party of Venezuela disappeared following the [[Federal War]]s of 1858-1863.&lt;ref&gt;Peeler, John A. ''Latin American Democracies: Colombia, Costa Rica, Venezuela''. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1985. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Chile's conservative party, the [[National Party (Chile, 1966–1973)|National Party]] disbanded in 1973 following a military coup and did not re-emerge as a political force following the subsequent return to democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim, Lois Hecht.

The conservative [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] governed the province of Quebec in periods from 1936 to 1960, in a close alliance with English Canadian business elites and the Catholic Church. This period, known as the [[Grande Noirceur|Great Darkness]] ended with the [[Quiet Revolution]] and the party went into terminal decline.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, John Frederick.

===Belgium===
Founded in 1945 as the Christian People's Party, the [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Flemish Christian Democrats]] (CD&amp;V) dominated politics in post-war Belgium. In 1999, the party's support collapsed and it became the country's fifth largest party.&lt;ref&gt;Annesley, Claire. ''A political and economic dictionary of Western Europe''. London: Routledge, 2005. ISBN 978-1-85743-214-5, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
Brazil's last conservative party, in a democratic regime, was the [[National Democratic Union|UDN]], but it ceased to exist in 1965 with the rise of brazilian's [[Brazilian military government|military government]]. Today, even with little political representation, individuals such as philosopher [[Olavo de Carvalho]] try to rescue the country's conservative values.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olavodecarvalho.org/textos/0801entrevista.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{Main|Canadian conservatism}}
Canada's ''Conservatives'' had their roots in the Loyalists - Tories - who left America after the American Revolution. They developed in the socio-economic and political cleavages that existed during the first three decades of the 19th century, and had the support of the business, professional and established Church (Anglican) elites in Ontario and to a lesser extent in Quebec. Holding a monopoly over administrative and judicial offices, they were called the &quot;[[Family Compact]]&quot; in Ontario and the &quot;[[Chateau Clique]]&quot; in Quebec. [[John A. Macdonald]]'s successful leadership of the movement to confederate the provinces and his subsequent tenure as prime minister for most of the late 19th century rested on his ability to bring together the English-speaking Protestant oligarchy and the [[ultramontane]] Catholic hierarchy of Quebec and to keep them united in a conservative coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Kornberg, Allan and Mishler, William. ''Influence in Parliament, Canada''. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1976. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservatives combined [[economic liberalism|pro-market liberalism]] and [[Toryism]]. They generally supported an activist government and state intervention in the marketplace, and their policies were marked by ''[[noblesse oblige]]'', a paternalistic responsibility of the elites for the less well-off.&lt;ref&gt;Schultze, Rainer-Olaf; Sturm, Roland and Eberle, Dagmar. ''Conservative parties and right-wing politics in North America: reaping the benefits of an ideological victory?''. Germany: VS Verlag, 2003. ISBN 978-3-8100-3812-8 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; From 1942, the party was known as the Progressive Conservatives, until 2003, when the national party merged with the [[Canadian Alliance]] to form the [[Conservative Party of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Panizza, Francisco. ''Populism and the mirror of democracy''. London: Verso, 2005. ISBN 978-1-85984-489-2 p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
The [[Colombian Conservative Party]], founded in 1849, traces its origins to opponents of General [[Francisco de Paula Santander]]'s 1833-37 administration. While the term &quot;liberal&quot; had been used to describe all political forces in Colombia, the conservatives began describing themselves as &quot;conservative liberals&quot; and their opponents as &quot;red liberals&quot;. From the 1860s until the present, the party has supported strong central government, and supported the Catholic Church, especially its role as protector of the sanctity of the family, and opposed separation of church and state. Its policies include the legal equality of all men, the citizen's right to own property and opposition to dictatorship. It has usually been Colombia's second largest party, with the [[Colombian Liberal Party]] being the largest.

===Denmark===
Founded in 1915, the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party of Denmark]]. was the successor of ''Højre'' (literally &quot;[[Right-wing politics|right&quot;]]).  In the 2005 election it won 18 out of 179 seats in the ''Folketing'' and became a junior partner in coalition with the Liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Annesley, Claire. ''A political and economic dictionary of Western Europe''. London: Routledge, 2005. ISBN 978-1-85743-214-5, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; The party is preceded by 11 years by the [[Young Conservatives (Denmark)|Young Conservatives‎‎‎ (KU)]], today the youth movement of the party.

===Finland===
The conservative party in Finland is the [[National Coalition Party]] (in Finnish ''Kansallinen Kokoomus'', ''Kok''). The party was founded in 1918 when several monarchist parties united.  Although in the past the party was right-wing, today it is a moderate party.  While the party advocates [[economic liberalism]], it is committed to the [[social market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Siaroff, Alan. ''Comparative European party systems: an analysis of parliamentary elections since 1945''. New York and London: Garland Publishing Inc., 2000. ISBN 978-0-8153-2930-5, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
Following the Second World War, conservatives in France supported Gaullist groups and have been nationalistic, and emphasized tradition, order, and the regeneration of France. Gaullists held divergent views on social issues. The number of Conservative groups, their lack of stability, and their tendency to be identified with local issues defy simple categorization.  Conservatism has been the major political force in France since the second world war.&lt;ref&gt;Viereck, Peter and Ryn, Claes G. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2005. ISBN 978-0-7658-0576-8 p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually, post-war French conservatism was formed around the personality of a leader, [[Charles de Gaulle]], and did not draw on traditional French conservatism, but on the [[Bonapartism]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Alan. ''Political Parties and Party Systems''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. ISBN 978-0-19-878076-2, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  Gaullism in France continues under the [[Union for a Popular Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Hauss, Charles. ''Comparative Politics: Domestic Responses to Global Challenges''.  Belmont, CA: Cengage Learning, 2008. ISBN 978-0-495-50109-1 p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;  The word &quot;conservative&quot; itself is a term of abuse in France.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, Andrew and Wright, Vincent. ''The government and politics of France''.  New york: Routledge, 2006. ISBN 978-0-415-35733-3 p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
The main interwar conservative party was called the [[People's Party (Greece)|People's Party]] (PP), which supported constitutional monarchy and opposed the republican Liberal Party. It was able to re-group after the Second World War as part of a ''United Nationalist Front'' which achieved power campaigning on a simple anticommunist, ultranationalist platform. However, the vote received by the PP declined, leading them to create an expanded party, the [[Greek Rally]], under the leadership of the charismatic General [[Alexandros Papagos]]. The conservatives opposed the far right dictatorship of the colonels (1967–1974) and established the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democratic Party]] following the fall of the dictatorship. The new party had four objectives: to confront Turkish expansionism in Cyprus, to reestablish and solidify democratic rule, to give the country a strong government, and to make a powerful moderate party a force in Greek politics.&lt;ref&gt;Penniman, Howard Rae. ''Greece at the polls: the national elections of 1974 and 1977''.  Washington: American Enterprise Institute, 1981. ISBN 978-0-8447-3434-7 pp. 49-59&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iceland===
Founded in 1926 as the Conservative Party, Iceland's [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] adopted its current name in 1929. From the beginning they have been the largest vote-winning party, averaging around 40%. They combine liberalism and conservatism, supporting nationalization and opposed to class conflict. While mostly in opposition during the 1930s, they embraced [[economic liberalism]], but accepted the welfare state after the war and participated in governments supportive of state intervention and protectionism. Unlike other Scandanivian conservative (and liberal) parties, it has always had a large working-class following.&lt;ref&gt;Grofman, Bernard and Lijpart, Arend, editors.

Hardarson ISBN 978-0-87586-138-8, pp. 107-108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luxembourg===
Luxembourg's major conservative party, the [[Christian Social People's Party]] (CSV or PCS) was formed as the Party of the Right in 1914, and adopted its present name in 1945. It was consistently the largest political party in Luxembourg and dominated politics throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Urwin, Derek W. ''A Dictionary of European History and Politics, 1945-1995''. London: Pearson UK, 1996. ISBN 978-0-582-25874-7 p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
The [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party of Norway]] (Norwegian: Høyre, literally &quot;[[Right-wing politics|right&quot;]]) was formed by the old upper class of state officials and wealthy merchants to fight the populist democracy of the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]], but lost power in 1884 when parliamentarian government was first practised.  It has elements both of paternalism, stressing the responsibilities of the state and of economic liberalism.  It first returned to power in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Knut Heidar|Heidar, Knut]]. ''Norway: elites on trial''. Boulder Westview Press, 2001. ISBN 978-0-8133-3200-0, p. 66-67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===

[[Singapore]]'s only conservative party or party on the right of the political spectrum is the [[People's Action Party]].  It is currently in government and has been in government since independence from the British in the 1960s. It has promoted conservative values in the form of '[[Asian values]]' or 'shared values'.  The main party on the left of the political spectrum in Singapore is the [[Workers' Party of Singapore]].

===Sweden===

Sweden's conservative party, the [[Moderate Party]], was formed in 1904, two years after the founding of the liberal party.&lt;ref&gt;Grofman, Bernard and Lijpart, Arend, editors. ''The evolution of electoral and party systems in the Nordic countries''. New York: Agathon Press, 2002. &quot;The Icelandic electoral system 1844-1999&quot; by Olafur Th. Hardarson ISBN 978-0-87586-138-8, pp. 107-235&lt;/ref&gt;  The party emphasizes tax reductions, deregulation of private enterprise, and the partial privatization of education.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Clive S. (editor). ''Political Parties and Interest Groups: Shaping Democratic Governance''. Boulder: Lynne Rienner, 2001. ISBN 978-1-55587-978-5 &quot;Sweden: Weakening Links Between Political Parties and Interest Organizations&quot; by Anders Widfeldt&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Conservatism in the [[United Kingdom]] is related to its counterparts in other Western nations, but has a distinct tradition. [[Edmund Burke]] is often considered the ''father of conservatism'' in the English-speaking world. Burke was a [[British Whig Party|Whig]], while the term ''[[Tory]]'' is given to the later Conservative Party. One [[Australia]]n scholar argues, &quot;For Edmund Burke and Australians of a like mind, the essence of conservatism lies not in a body of theory, but in the disposition to maintain those institutions seen as central to the beliefs and practices of society.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gw&quot;&gt;Worthington, Glen, [http://web.archive.org/web/20060913184447/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rn/2001-02/02RN29.htm Conservatism in Australian National Politics], Parliament of Australia Parliamentary Library, 19 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thatcher - Reagan c872-9.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Margaret Thatcher]] and Ronald Reagan in 1981]]
The old established form of English and, after the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]], British conservatism, was the Tory Party. It reflected the attitudes of a rural land owning class, and championed the institutions of the monarchy, the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]], the family, and property as the best defence of the social order. In the early stages of the [[industrial revolution]], it seemed to be totally opposed to a process that seemed to undermine some of these bulwarks. The new industrial elite were seen by many as enemies to the social order. [[Robert Peel]] was able to reconcile the new industrial class to the Tory landed class by persuading the latter to accept the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846. He created a new political group that sought to preserve the old status quo while accepting the basics of [[laissez-faire]] and [[free trade]]. The new coalition of traditional landowners and sympathetic industrialists constituted the new Conservative Party.

[[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]] gave the new party a political ideology. As a young man, he was influenced by the [[romantic movement]] and [[medievalism]], and developed a devastating critique of industrialism. In his novels, he outlined an England divided into two nations, each living in perfect ignorance of each other. He foresaw, like [[Karl Marx]], the phenomenon of an alienated industrial proletariat. His solution involved a return to an idealised view of a corporate or organic society, in which everyone had duties and responsibilities towards other people or groups. This &quot;one nation&quot; conservatism is still a significant tradition in British politics. It has animated a great deal of social reform undertaken by successive Conservative governments.

Although nominally a Conservative, Disraeli was sympathetic to some of the demands of the [[Chartists]] and argued for an alliance between the landed aristocracy and the working class against the increasing power of the middle class, helping to found the [[Young England]] group in 1842 to promote the view that the rich should use their power to protect the poor from exploitation by the middle class. The conversion of the Conservative Party into a modern mass organisation was accelerated by the concept of [[Tory Democracy]] attributed to [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], father of Britain's wartime Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].

[[File:CMEC 1 009.jpg|thumb|[[David Cameron]] is the current [[prime minister]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and leader of Conservative Party.]]
A Liberal-Conservative coalition during [[World War I]], coupled with the ascent of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], hastened the collapse of the Liberals in the 1920s. After [[World War II]], the Conservative Party made concessions to the socialist policies of the Left. This compromise was a pragmatic measure to regain power, but also the result of the early successes of [[central planning]] and state ownership forming a cross-party consensus. This was known as [[Butskellism]], after the almost identical [[Keynesian]] policies of [[Rab Butler]] on behalf of the Conservatives, and [[Hugh Gaitskell]] for Labour.

However, in the 1980s, under the leadership of [[Margaret Thatcher]], and the influence of [[Keith Joseph]], there was a dramatic shift in the ideological direction of British conservatism, with a movement towards [[free-market]] economic policies. As one commentator explains, &quot;The [[privatization]] of state owned industries, unthinkable before, became commonplace [during Thatcher's government] and has now been imitated all over the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mt&quot;&gt;Davies, Stephen, [http://www.ashbrook.org/publicat/onprin/v1n2/davies.html Margaret Thatcher and the Rebirth of Conservatism], Ashbrook Center for Public Affairs, July 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have questioned whether [[Thatcherism]] was consistent with the traditional concept of conservatism in the [[United Kingdom]], and saw her views as more consistent with radical [[classical liberalism]]. Thatcher was described as &quot;a radical in a conservative party&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;mt&quot;/&gt; and her ideology has been seen as confronting &quot;established institutions&quot; and the &quot;accepted beliefs of the elite&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;mt&quot;/&gt; both concepts incompatible with the traditional conception of conservatism as signifying support for the established order and existing social convention.

===United States===
{{Main|Conservatism in the United States}}
 
Conservatism in the [[United States]] includes a variety of political ideologies including [[fiscal conservatism]], [[supply-side economics]], [[social conservatism]], [[libertarian conservatism]], [[bioconservative|bioconservatism]] and religious conservatism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/library/weekly/aa070898.htm About atheism]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as support for a strong [[military]]. Modern American conservatism was largely born out of alliance between [[Classical liberalism|classical liberals]] and social conservatives in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;&gt;Clark, B. (1998). ''Political economy: A comparative approach''. Westport, CT: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:President Reagan speaking in Minneapolis 1982.jpg|thumb|left|160px|President Ronald Reagan in 1982]]

Contemporary American conservatism traces its heritage back to Anglo-Irish political philosopher [[Edmund Burke]], who developed his views in response to the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Russell, ''The Conservative Mind,'' p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; US President [[Abraham Lincoln]] wrote that conservatism is &quot;the adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Russell, ''The Conservative Mind,'' p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; US president [[Ronald Reagan]], who was a self-declared conservative, is widely seen as a symbol of American conservatism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Conservatism|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/conservatsm.html|encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia|year=2008|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, he said &quot;I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is [[libertarianism]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/29318.html Inside Ronald Reagan], a [[Reason (magazine)|Reason magazine]] Interview with Ronald Reagan, July 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations in the US committed to promoting conservative ideology include the [[American Conservative Union]], [[Eagle Forum]], [[Heritage Foundation]], ''[[Citizens United]]'', and the [[Hoover Institution]]. US-based media outlets that are conservative include ''[[Human Events]]'', ''[[National Review]]'', ''[[The American Conservative]]'', ''[[Policy Review]]'', and ''[[The Weekly Standard]]''.

In the US, social conservatives emphasize traditional views of social units such as the [[family]], [[Church body|church]], or [[Localism (politics)|locale]]. Social conservatism may entail defining [[marriage]] as relationships between one man and one woman (thereby prohibiting [[same-sex marriage]] and [[polygamy]]) and laws placing restrictions on the practice of [[abortion]]. While many religious conservatives believe that government should have a role in defending moral values, libertarian conservatives such as [[Barry Goldwater]] advocated a hands-off government where social values were concerned.

== Psychology ==
Following the Second World War, psychologists conducted research into the different motives and tendencies that account for ideological differences between left and right. The early studies focused on conservatives, beginning with [[Theodor W. Adorno]]'s ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950). This book has been heavily criticized on theoretical and methodological grounds, but some of its findings have been confirmed by further empirical research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jost, J.J 2003&quot;&gt;Jost, J.J, Glaser, J., Kruglanski, A.A., &amp; Sulloway, F.J. (2003). Political conservatism as motivated social cognition. ''Psychological Bulletin, 129''(3), 339-375.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, British psychologist [[Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|Glenn Wilson]] published an influential book providing evidence that a general factor underlying conservative beliefs is &quot;fear of uncertainty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, G.D. (Ed.)(1973) The Psychology of Conservatism, London: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of research literature by Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, and Sulloway in 2003 found that many factors, such as [[Ambiguity tolerance|intolerance of ambiguity]] and need for [[Cognitive closure (psychology)|cognitive closure]], contribute to the degree of one's political conservatism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jost, J.J 2003&quot;/&gt; A study by Kathleen Maclay stated these traits &quot;might be associated with such generally valued characteristics as personal commitment and unwavering loyalty.&quot; The research also suggested that both liberals and conservatives are resistant to change; liberals simply have a higher tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/07/22_politics.shtml Berkeley.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to psychologist [[Robert Altemeyer]], individuals who are politically conservative tend to rank high in [[Right-wing Authoritarianism|Right-Wing Authoritarianism]] on his RWA scale.&lt;ref&gt;Altemeyer, B. (1981). Right-wing authoritarianism. Winnipeg, Canada: University of Manitoba Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This finding was echoed by [[Theodor Adorno]]. A study done on Israeli and Palestinian students in Israel found that RWA scores of right-wing party supporters were significantly higher than those of left-wing party supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Rubinstein | first1=G. | doi=10.1177/0022022196272005 | title=Two Peoples in One Land: A Validation Study of Altemeyer's Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale in the Palestinian and Jewish Societies in Israel | journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | year=1996 | volume=27  |pages=216–230}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2005 study by H. Michael Crowson and colleagues suggested a moderate gap between RWA and other conservative positions. &quot;The results indicated that conservatism is not synonymous with RWA.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Crowson, H. Michael, Stephen J. Thoma, and Nita Hestevold. &quot;Is political conservatism synonymous with authoritarianism?.&quot; The Journal of Social Psychology 145.5 (Oct 2005): 571(22). Expanded Academic ASAP. Gale. Remote Access. 20 May 2009 [http://find.galegroup.com/itx/start.do?prodId=EAIM Galegroup.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Felicia Pratto and her colleagues have found evidence to support the idea that a high [[Social Dominance Orientation]] (SDO) is strongly correlated with conservative political views, and opposition to social engineering to promote equality, though Pratto's findings have been highly controversial.&lt;ref name=&quot;pratto&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pratto |first1=Felicia |last2=Sidanius |first2=Jim |last3=Stallworth |first3=Lisa M. |last4=Malle |first4=Bertram F. |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.4.741 |title=Social dominance orientation: A personality variable predicting social and political attitudes |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=1994 |volume=67 |pages= 741–763 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratto and her colleagues found that high SDO scores were highly correlated with measures of [[prejudice]]. They were refuted in this claim by [[David J. Schneider]], who wrote that &quot;correlations between prejudice and political conservative are reduced virtually to zero when controls for SDO are instituted&quot; &lt;ref&gt;The psychology of stereotyping, David J. Schneider,  Guilford Press, 2005 ISBN 978-1-59385-193-4, 9781593851934 704 pages page 275&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Kenneth Minogue]] who wrote &quot;It is characteristic of the conservative temperament to value established identities, to praise habit and to respect prejudice, not because it is irrational, but because such things anchor the darting impulses of human beings in solidities of custom which we do not often begin to value until we are already losing them. Radicalism often generates youth movements, while conservatism is a condition found among the mature, who have discovered what it is in life they most value.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;The Social science encyclopedia, Jessica Kuper, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1985 ISBN 978-0-7102-0008-2, 9780710200082 916 pages pp 155-6&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 study on the relationship between racism and conservatism found that the correlation was stronger among more educated individuals, though specifically anti-Black racism did not increase. They also found that the correlation between racism and conservatism could be entirely accounted for by their mutual relationship with social dominance orientation. The authors concluded that opposition to affirmative action, especially among more highly educated conservatives, was better explained by social dominance orientation than by principled conservatism.&lt;ref name=&quot;sidanius96&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.476 |last1=Sidanius |first1= J |last2=Pratto |first2= F |last3=Bobo |first3= L |year=1996 |title=Racism, conservatism, affirmative action, and intellectual sophistication: A matter of principled conservatism or group dominance? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume= 70 |issue=3 |pages= 476–490 |url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/faculty/bobo/pdf%20documents/Racism.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study by scientists at Harvard and The University of California at San Diego found that there is also a genetic predisposition towards [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.discovery.com/human/is-there-a-liberal-gene.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Classical liberalism''' is a philosophy committed to the ideal of [[limited government]], [[individual liberty|liberty of individuals]] including [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of speech|speech]], [[freedom of the press|press]], [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], and [[free markets]].&lt;ref name=&quot;google.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.google.com/books?id=sq-1z8VMhDEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Modern%20Political%20Philosophy&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Modern political philosophy'' (1999), Richard Hudelson, p, 37–38]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Classical liberalism developed in the 19th century in [[Western Europe]], and the [[Americas]]. Although classical liberalism built on ideas that had already developed by the end of the 18th century, it advocated a specific kind of society, government and public policy required as a result of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Hamowy, p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt; Notable individuals who have contributed to classical liberalism include [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], [[Thomas Malthus]] and [[David Ricardo]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; It drew on the economics of [[Adam Smith]], a psychological understanding of individual liberty, [[natural law]] and [[utilitarianism]], and a belief in progress. Classical liberals established political parties that were called &quot;liberal&quot;, although in the United States classical liberalism came to dominate both existing major political parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;google.com&quot;/&gt; There was a revival of interest in classical liberalism in the 20th century led by [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, classical liberalism developed into [[neo-classical liberalism]], which argued for government to be as small as possible in order to allow the exercise of individual freedom. In its most extreme form, it advocated [[Social Darwinism]]. [[Libertarianism]] is a modern form of neo-classical liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''classical liberalism'' was applied in retrospect to distinguish earlier 19th-century liberalism from the newer [[social liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''classical liberalism'' is also sometimes used to refer to all forms of [[liberalism]] before the 20th century, and some [[conservatives]] and [[libertarians]] use the term classical liberalism to describe their belief in the primacy of economic freedom and minimal government. It is not always clear which meaning is intended.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncpa.org/pub/what-is-classical-liberalism is an example of an article that defines &quot;classical liberalism&quot; as all liberalism before the 20th Century.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mises.org/etexts/classical.asp is an example of an article that defines &quot;classical liberalism&quot; as small government.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mason.gmu.edu/~ihs/guideintro.html defines &quot;classical liberalism&quot; as a belief in peace and freedom.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core principles==
According to E. K. Hunt, classical liberals made four assumptions about human nature: People were &quot;egoistic, coldly calculating, essentially inert and atomistic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Being egoistic, people were motivated solely by pain and pleasure. Being calculating, they made decisions intended to maximize pleasure and minimize pain. If there were no opportunity to increase pleasure or reduce pain, they would become inert. Therefore, the only motivation for labor was either the possibility of great reward or fear of hunger. This belief led classical liberal politicians to pass the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]], which limited the provision of social assistance. On the other hand, classical liberals believed that men of higher rank were motivated by ambition. Seeing society as atomistic, they believed that society was no more than the sum of its individual members. These views departed from earlier views of society as a family and, therefore, greater than the sum of its members.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, pp. 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical liberals agreed with [[Thomas Hobbes]] that government had been created by individuals to protect themselves from one another. They thought that individuals should be free to pursue their self-interest without control or restraint by society. Individuals should be free to obtain work from the highest-paying employers, while the profit motive would ensure that products that people desired were produced at prices they would pay. In a free market, both labor and capital would receive the greatest possible reward, while production would be organized efficiently to meet consumer demand.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adopting [[Thomas Malthus]]'s population theory, they saw poor urban conditions as inevitable, as they believed population growth would outstrip food production; and they considered that to be desirable, as starvation would help limit population growth. They opposed any income or wealth redistribution, which they believed would be dissipated by the lowest orders.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, pp. 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Government, as explained by [[Adam Smith]], had only three functions: protection against foreign invaders, protection of citizens from wrongs committed against them by other citizens, and building and maintaining public institutions and public works that the private sector could not profitably provide. Classical liberals extended protection of the country to protection of overseas markets through armed intervention. Protection of individuals against wrongs normally meant protection of private property and enforcement of contracts and the suppression of trade unions and the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement. Public works included a stable currency, standard weights and measures, and support of roads, canals, harbors, railways, and postal and other communications services.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, pp. 51–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In the [[United States]], liberalism took a strong root because it had little opposition to its ideals, whereas in [[Europe]] liberalism was opposed by many reactionary interests. In a nation of farmers, especially farmers whose workers were slaves, little attention was paid to the economic aspects of liberalism. But, as America grew, industry became a larger and larger part of American life; and, during the term of America's first populist president, [[Andrew Jackson]], economic questions came to the forefront. The economic ideas of the Jacksonian era were almost universally the ideas of classical liberalism. Freedom was maximized when the government took a &quot;hands off&quot; attitude toward industrial development and supported the value of the currency by freely exchanging paper money for gold. The ideas of classical liberalism remained essentially unchallenged until a series of [[Depression (economics)|depression]]s, thought to be impossible according to the tenets of [[classical economics]], led to economic hardship from which the voters demanded relief. In the words of [[William Jennings Bryan]], &quot;You shall not crucify the American farmer on a cross of gold.&quot; Despite the common recurrence of depressions, classical liberalism remained the orthodox belief among American businessmen until the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=Voegelin&gt;Eric Voegelin, Mary Algozin, and Keith Algozin, [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0034-6705%28197410%2936%3A4%3C504%3ALAIH%3E2.0.CO%3B2-A &quot;Liberalism and Its History&quot;], ''Review of Politics'' 36, no. 4 (1974): 504–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Depression saw a sea change in liberalism, leading to the development of [[modern liberalism]]. In the words of [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]]:

{{quote|When the growing complexity of industrial conditions required increasing government intervention in order to assure more equal opportunities, the liberal tradition, faithful to the goal rather than to the [[dogma]], altered its view of the state,&quot; and &quot;there emerged the conception of a social [[welfare state]], in which the national government had the express obligation to maintain high levels of employment in the economy, to supervise standards of life and labor, to regulate the methods of business competition, and to establish comprehensive patterns of social security.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schelesinger Jr., [http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schleslib.html &quot;Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans&quot;], in ''The Politics of Hope'' (Boston: Riverside Press, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Classical liberalism places a particular emphasis on the [[sovereignty of the individual]], with [[private property]] rights being seen as essential to individual liberty. This forms the philosophical basis for ''laissez-faire'' public policy. According to [[Alan Ryan]], the ideology of the original ''classical liberals'' argued against [[direct democracy]], where law is made by majority vote by citizens, &quot;for there is nothing in the bare idea of majority rule to show that majorities will always respect the rights of property or maintain rule of law.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan&quot;&gt;Alan Ryan, &quot;Liberalism&quot;, in ''A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy'', ed. Robert E. Goodin and Philip Pettit (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 1995), 293.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[James Madison]] argued for a [[constitutional republic]] with protections for individual liberty over a [[pure democracy]], reasoning that, in a pure democracy, a &quot;common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole...and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;James Madison, [[Federalist No. 10]] (November 22, 1787), in Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison, ''The Federalist: A Commentary on the Constitution of the United States'', ed. Henry Cabot Lodge (New York, 1888), [http://books.google.com/books?id=XcllKruLvi4C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;vq=%22common+passion+or+interest%22 56].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Anthony Quinton]], classical liberals believe that &quot;an unfettered market&quot; is the most efficient mechanism to satisfy human needs and channel resources to their most productive uses: they &quot;are more suspicious than [[Conservatism|conservative]]s of all but the most minimal government.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anthony Quinton 1995&quot;&gt;Anthony Quinton, &quot;Conservativism&quot;, in ''A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy'', ed. Robert E. Goodin and Philip Pettit (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 1995), 246.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarcho-capitalist]] [[Walter Block]] claims, however, that, while Adam Smith was an advocate of [[economic freedom]], he also allowed for government to intervene in many areas.&lt;ref&gt;Jeet Heer, [http://www.jeetheer.com/politics/smith.htm &quot;Adam Smith and the Left&quot;], ''[[National Post]]'', December 3, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical liberalism holds that individual rights are natural, inherent, or inalienable, and exist independently of government. Thomas Jefferson called these ''[[inalienable rights]]'': &quot;...rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add 'within the limits of the law', because law is often but the tyrant's will, and always so when it violates the rights of the individual.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson, letter to Isaac H. Tiffany, 1819.&lt;/ref&gt; For classical liberalism, rights are of a ''[[Negative and positive rights|negative]]'' nature—rights that require that other individuals (and governments) refrain from interfering with individual liberty, whereas [[social liberalism]] (also called ''modern liberalism'' or ''welfare liberalism'') holds that individuals have a right to be provided with certain benefits or services by others.&lt;ref name=Kelley&gt;David Kelley, ''A Life of One's Own: Individual Rights and the Welfare State'' (Washington, DC: Cato Institute, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike social liberals, classical liberals are &quot;hostile to the [[welfare state]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan&quot;/&gt; They do not have an interest in [[material equality]] but only in &quot;[[equality before the law]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chandran Kukathas]], &quot;Ethical Pluralism from a Classical Liberal Perspective,&quot; in ''The Many and the One: Religious and Secular Perspectives on Ethical Pluralism in the Modern World'', ed. Richard Madsen and Tracy B. Strong, Ethikon Series in Comparative Ethics (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2003), 61 (ISBN 0-691-09993-6).&lt;/ref&gt; Classical liberalism is critical of social liberalism and takes offense at [[group rights]] being pursued at the expense of [[individual rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Evans, ed., ''Edinburgh Companion to Contemporary Liberalism: Evidence and Experience'' (London: Routledge, 2001), 55 (ISBN 1-57958-339-3).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]] identified two different traditions within classical liberalism: the &quot;British tradition&quot; and the &quot;French tradition&quot;. Hayek saw the British philosophers [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[Josiah Tucker]], [[Edmund Burke]] and [[William Paley]] as representative of a tradition that articulated beliefs in [[empiricism]], the [[common law]], and in traditions and institutions which had spontaneously evolved but were imperfectly understood. The French tradition included [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Marquis de Condorcet|Condorcet]], the [[Encyclopédie|Encyclopedist]]s and the [[Physiocrats]]. This tradition believed in rationalism and the unlimited powers of reason and sometimes showed hostility to tradition and religion. Hayek conceded that the national labels did not exactly correspond to those belonging to each tradition: Hayek saw the Frenchmen [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], [[Benjamin Constant|Constant]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Tocqueville]] as belonging to the &quot;British tradition&quot; and the British [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]], [[Richard Price]] and [[Thomas Paine]] as belonging to the &quot;French tradition&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;F. A. Hayek, ''The Constitution of Liberty'' (London: Routledge, 1976), 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek also rejected the label &quot;laissez faire&quot; as originating from the French tradition and alien to the beliefs of Hume, Smith and Burke.

==History==

Classical liberalism in the United Kingdom developed from [[Whig (British political party)|Whiggery]] and [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]], and represented a new political ideology. Whiggery had become a dominant ideology following the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, and was associated with the defence of Parliament, upholding the rule of law and defending [[landed property]]. The origins of rights were seen as being in an ancient constitution, which had existed from [[time immemorial]]. These rights, which some Whigs considered to include freedom of the press and freedom of speech, were justified by custom rather than by [[natural rights]]. They believed that the power of the executive had to be constrained. While they supported limited suffrage, they saw voting as a privilege, rather than as a right. However there was no consistency in Whig ideology, and diverse writers including [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]] and [[Edmund Burke]] were all influential among Whigs, although none of them were universally accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vincent, pp. 28-29&quot;&gt;Vincent, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

British radicals, from the 1790s to the 1820s, concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasizing [[natural rights]] and popular sovereignty. [[Richard Price]] and [[Joseph Priestly]] adapted the language of Locke to the ideology of radicalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vincent, pp. 28-29&quot;/&gt; The radicals saw parliamentary reform as a first step toward dealing with their many greivances, including the treatment of [[English Dissenters|Protestant Dissenters]], the slave trade, high prices and high taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

There was greater unity to classical liberalism ideology than there had been with Whiggery. Classical liberals were committed to individualism, liberty and equal rights. They believed that required a free economy with minimal government interference. Writers such as [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]] opposed both aristocratic privilege and property, which they saw as an impediment to the development of a class of [[yeoman]] farmers.  Some elements of Whiggery opposed this new thinking, and were uncomfortable with the commercial nature of classical liberalism. These elements became associated with conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical liberalism was the dominant political theory of the United Kingdom from the early 19th century until the First World War. Its notable victories were the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829]], the [[Reform Act of 1832]], and the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846. The [[Anti-Corn Law League]] brought together a coalition of liberal and radical groups in support of free trade under the leadership of [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]], who opposed militarism and public expenditure. Their policies of low public expenditure and low taxation were adopted by [[William Ewart Gladstone]] when he became [[chancellor of the exchequer]] and later prime minister. Classical liberalism was often associated with religious dissent and [[nonconformism]].&lt;ref&gt;Gray, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Although classical liberals aspired to a minimum of state activity, they accepted the principle of government intervention in the economy from the early 19th century with passage of the [[Factory Acts]]. From around 1840 to 1860, [[laissez-faire]] advocates of the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]] and writers in ''[[The Economist]]'' were confident that their early victories would lead to a period of expanding economic and personal liberty and world peace but would face reversals as government intervention and activity continued to expand from the 1850s. [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[James Mill]], although advocates of laissez-faire, non-intervention in foreign affairs, and individual liberty, believed that social institutions could be rationally redesigned through the principles of [[Utilitarianism]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] prime minister, [[Benjamin Disraeli]], rejected classical liberalism altogether and advocated [[Tory Democracy]]. By the 1870s, [[Herbert Spencer]] and other classical liberals concluded that historical development was turning against them.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; By the First World War, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] had largely abandoned classical liberal principles.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual sources==
===John Locke===
Central to classical liberal ideology was their interpretation of [[John Locke]]'s ''[[The Second Treatise of Civil Government#Second Treatise|Second treatise of government]]'' and &quot;[[A Letter Concerning Toleration|A letter concerning toleration]]&quot;, which had been written as a defence of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688. Although these writings were considered too radical at the time for the United Kingdom's new rulers, they later came to be cited by Whigs, radicals and supporters of the American Revolution. However much of later liberal thought was absent in Locke's writings or scarcely mentioned, and his writings have been subject to various interpretations. There is little mention for example of constitutionalism, the separation of powers and limited government.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

James L. Richardson identified five central themes in Locke's writing: individualism, consent, the concepts of the rule of law and government as trustee, the significance of property and religious toleration. Although Locke did not develop a theory of natural rights, he envisioned individuals in the state of nature as being free and equal. The individual, rather than the community or institutions, was the point of reference. Locke believed that individuals had given consent to government and therefore authority derived from the people rather than from above. This belief would influence later revolutionary movements.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

As a trustee Government was expected to serve the interests of the people not the rulers, and rulers were expected to follow the laws enacted by legislatures. Locke also held that the main purpose of men uniting into commonwealths and governments was for the preservation of their property. Despite the ambiguity of the Locke's definition of property, this principle held great appeal to individuals possessed of great property.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Locke held that the individual had the right to follow his own religious beliefs and that the state should not impose a religion against [[Dissenters]]. But there were limitations. No tolerance should be shown for atheists, who were seen as amoral, or to Catholics, who were seen as owing allegiance to the Pope over their own national government.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adam Smith===
[[Adam Smith]]'s [[Wealth of Nations]], published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of classical liberal economics, at least until the publication of [[J. S. Mill]]'s ''Principles'' in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, pp. 63, 68&lt;/ref&gt; Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of prices and the distribution of wealth, and the policies the state should follow in order to maximize wealth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mills, p. 64&quot;&gt;Mills, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith saw self-interest, rather than altruism, as the motivation for the production of goods and services. An &quot;[[invisible hand]]&quot; directed the tradesman to work toward the public good. This provided a moral justification for the accumulation of wealth, which had previously been viewed as sinful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mills, p. 64&quot;/&gt; He assumed that workers could be paid as low as was necessary for their survival, which was later transformed by Ricardo and Malthus into the &quot;[[Iron Law of Wages]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; His main emphasis was on the benefit of free internal and international trade, which he thought could increase wealth through specialization in production.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; He also opposed restrictive trade preferences, state grants of monopolies, and employers' organisations and trade unions.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Government should be limited to defence, public works and the administration of justice, financed by taxes based on income.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's economics was carried into practice in the 19th century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the [[Poor Relief Act 1662|Poor Relief Act]], that had restricted the mobility of labour, in 1834, and the end of the rule of the [[East India Company]] over India in 1858.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mills, p. 69&quot;&gt;Mills, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Say, Malthus and Ricardo===
In addition to Adam Smith's legacy, [[Say's law]], Malthus theories of population and Ricardo's [[iron law of wages]] became central doctrines of classical economics. The pessimistic nature of these theories led to Carlyle calling economics the [[dismal science]] and it provided a basis of criticism of capitalism by its opponents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mills, p. 76&quot;&gt;Mills, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Baptiste Say]] was a French economist who introduced Adam Smith's economic theories into France and whose commentaries on Smith were read in both France and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mills, p. 69&quot;/&gt; Say challenged Smith's [[labour theory of value]], believing that prices were determined by utility and also emphasized the criterical role of the entrepreneur in the economy. However neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. His most important contribution to economic thinking was &quot;[[Say's law]]&quot;, which was interpreted by classical economists that there could be no overproduction in a market, and that there would always be a balance between supply and demand.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; This general belief influenced government policies until the 1930s. Following this law, since the economic cycle was seen as self-correcting, government did not intervene during periods of economic hardship because it was seen as futile.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Malthus]] wrote two books, ''[[An essay on the principle of population]]'', published in 1798, and ''[[Principles of Political Economy (Malthus)|Principles of political economy]]'', published in 1820. The second book which was a rebuttal of Say's law had little influence on contemporary economists.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; His first book however became a major influence on classical liberalism. In that book, Malthus claimed that population growth would outstrip food production, because population grew geometrically, while food production grew arithmetically. As people were provided with food, they would reproduce until their growth outstripped the food supply. Nature would then provide a check to growth in the forms of vice and misery. No gains in income could prevent this, and any welfare for the poor would be self-defeating. The poor were in fact responsible for their own problems which could have been avoided through self-restraint.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Ricardo]], who was an admirer of Adam Smith, covered many of the same topics but while Smith drew conclusions from broadly empirical observations, Ricardo used induction, drawing conclusions by reasoning from basic assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; While Ricardo accepted Smith's [[labour theory of value]], he acknowledged that utility could influence the price of some rare items. Rents on agricultural land were seen as the production that was surplus to the subsistence required by the tenants. Wages were seen as the amount required for workers' subsistence and to maintain current population levels.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 74-75&lt;/ref&gt; According to his [[Iron Law of Wages]], wages could never rise beyond subsistence levels. Ricardo explained profits as a return on capital, which itself was the product of labour. But a conclusion many drew from his theory was that profit was a surplus appropriated by capitalists to which they were not entitled.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utilitarianism===
[[Utilitarianism]] provided the political justification for implementation of economic liberalism by British governments, which was to dominate economic policy from the 1830s. Although utilitarianism prompted legislative and administrative reform and [[John Stuart Mill]]'s later writings on the subject foreshadowed the welfare state, it was mainly used as a justification for [[laissez-faire]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The central concept of utilitarianism, which was developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]], was that that public policy should seek to provide &quot;the greatest happiness of the greatest number&quot;. While this could be interpreted as a justification for state action to reduce poverty, it was used by classical liberals to justify inaction with the argument that the net benefit to all individuals would be higher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mills, p. 76&quot;/&gt;

==Political economy==
Classical liberals saw [[utilitarianism|utility]] as the foundation for public policies. This broke both with conservative &quot;tradition&quot; and Lockean &quot;[[Natural_rights#John_Locke|natural rights]]&quot;, which were seen as irrational. Utility, which emphasizes the happiness of individuals, became the central ethical value of all liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Although utilitarianism inspired wide-ranging reforms, it became primarily a justification for ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics. However, classical liberals rejected [[Adam Smith]]'s belief that the &quot;invisible hand&quot; would lead to general benefits and embraced [[Thomas Malthus]]' view that population expansion would prevent any general benefit and [[David Ricardo]]'s view of the inevitability of class conflict. ''Laissez-faire'' was seen as the only possible economic approach, and any government intervention was seen as useless. The [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]] was defended on &quot;scientific or economic principals&quot; while the authors of the [[Elizabethan Poor Law (1601)|Elizabethan Poor Law]] of 1601 were seen as not having had the benefit of reading Malthus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richardson, p. 33&quot;&gt;Richardson, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Commitment to ''laissez-faire'', however, was not uniform. Some economists advocated state support of public works and education. Classical liberals were also divided on free trade. Ricardo, for example, expressed doubt that the removal of grain tariffs advocated by [[Richard Cobden]] and the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] would have any general benefits. Most classical liberals also supported legislation to regulate the number of hours that children were allowed to work and usually did not oppose factory reform legislation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richardson, p. 33&quot;/&gt;

Despite the pragmatism of classical economists, their views were expressed in dogmatic terms by such popular writers as [[Jane Marcet]] and [[Harriet Martineau]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Richardson, p. 33&quot;/&gt; The strongest defender of ''laissez-faire'' was ''[[The Economist]]'' founded by [[James Wilson (UK politician)|James Wilson]] in 1843. ''The Economist'' criticized Ricardo for his lack of support for free trade and expressed hostility to welfare, believing that the lower orders were responsible for their economic circumstances. ''The Economist'' took the position that regulation of factory hours was harmful to workers and also strongly opposed state support for education, health, the provision of water, and granting of patents and copyrights. A rigid belief in ''laissez-faire'' also guided government response in 1846–1849 to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in Ireland, during which an estimated 1.5 million people died. It was expected that private enterprise and free trade, rather than government intervention, would alleviate the famine.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Free trade and world peace==
Several liberals, including Adam Smith and [[Richard Cobden]], argued that the free exchange of goods between nations could lead to world peace, a view recognized by such modern American political scientists as Dahl, Doyle, Russet, and O'Neil. Dr. Gartzke, of Columbia University states, &quot;Scholars like Montesquieu, Adam Smith, Richard Cobden, [[Norman Angell]], and [[Richard Rosecrance]] have long speculated that free markets have the potential to free states from the looming prospect of recurrent warfare&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, &quot;Economic Freedom and Peace,&quot; in ''Economic Freedom of the World: 2005 Annual Report'' (Vancouver: Fraser Institute, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; American political scientists John R. Oneal and Bruce M. Russett, well known for their work on the democratic peace theory, state:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The classical liberals advocated policies to increase liberty and prosperity. They sought to empower the commercial class politically and to abolish royal charters, monopolies, and the protectionist policies of [[mercantilism]] so as to encourage entrepreneurship and increase productive efficiency. They also expected democracy and laissez-faire economics to diminish the frequency of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/1468-2478.00042}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Adam Smith]] argued in the ''Wealth of Nations'' that, as societies progressed from hunter gatherers to industrial societies, the spoils of war would rise but that the costs of war would rise further, making war difficult and costly for industrialized nations.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Doyle, ''Ways of War and Peace: Realism, Liberalism, and Socialism'' (New York: Norton, 1997), 237 (ISBN 0-393-96947-9).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...the honours, the fame, the emoluments of war, belong not to [the middle and industrial classes]; the battle-plain is the harvest field of the [[aristocracy]], watered with the blood of the people...Whilst our trade rested upon our foreign dependencies, as was the case in the middle of the last century...force and violence, were necessary to command our customers for our manufacturers...But war, although the greatest of consumers, not only produces nothing in return, but, by abstracting labour from productive employment and interrupting the course of trade, it impedes, in a variety of indirect ways, the creation of wealth; and, should hostilities be continued for a series of years, each successive war-loan will be felt in our commercial and manufacturing districts with an augmented pressure. Richard Cobden&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Stringham, [http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_09_1_6_stringham.pdf &quot;Commerce, Markets, and Peace: Richard Cobden's Enduring Lessons&quot;], ''Independent Review'' 9, no. 1 (2004): 105, 110, 115.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|When goods cannot cross borders, armies will. – Frederic Bastiat&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Griswold, [http://www.cato.org/dailys/12-31-98.html &quot;Peace on Earth, Free Trade for Men&quot;], Cato Institute, December 31, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|By virtue of their mutual interest does nature unite people against violence and war…the spirit of trade cannot coexist with war, and sooner or later this spirit dominates every people. For among all those powers…that belong to a nation, financial power may be the most reliable in forcing nations to pursue the noble cause of peace…and wherever in the world war threatens to break out, they will try to head it off through mediation, just as if they were permanently leagued for this purpose – Immanuel Kant, the Perpetual Peace.}}

Cobden believed that military expenditures worsened the welfare of the state and benefited a small but concentrated elite minority. Summing up British [[imperialism]], which he believed was the result the economic restrictions of [[mercantalism|mercantilist]] policies. To Cobden, and many classical liberals, those who advocated peace must also advocate free markets.

==Relationship to modern liberalism==
Many modern scholars of liberalism argue that no particularly meaningful distinction between classical and modern liberalism exists. Alan Wolfe summarizes this viewpoint, which &lt;blockquote&gt;reject(s) any such distinction and argue(s) instead for the existence of a continuous liberal understanding that includes both Adam Smith and John Maynard Keynes... The idea that liberalism comes in two forms assumes that the most fundamental question facing mankind is how much government intervenes into the economy... When instead we discuss human purpose and the meaning of life, Adam Smith and John Maynard Keynes are on the same side. Both of them possessed an expansive sense of what we are put on this earth to accomplish. Both were on the side of enlightenment. Both were optimists who believed in progress but were dubious about grand schemes that claimed to know all the answers. For Smith, mercantilism was the enemy of human liberty. For Keynes, monopolies were. It makes perfect sense for an eighteenth century thinker to conclude that humanity would flourish under the market. For a twentieth century thinker committed to the same ideal, government was an essential tool to the same end.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Alan Wolfe,[http://www.tnr.com/blog/alan-wolfe/false-distinction &quot;A False Distinction&quot;], ''The New Republic'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

According to William J. Novak, however, ''liberalism'' in the United States shifted, &quot;between 1877 and 1937...from laissez-faire constitutionalism to [[New Deal]] statism, from classical liberalism to democratic social-welfarism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Novak, [http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/24.1/novak.html &quot;The Not-So-Strange Birth of the Modern American State: A Comment on James A. Henretta's 'Charles Evans Hughes and the Strange Death of Liberal America'&quot;], ''Law and History Review'' 24, no. 1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobhouse, in ''Liberalism'' (1911), attributed this purported shift, which included qualified acceptance of government intervention in the economy and the collective right to equality in dealings, to an increased desire for what Hobhouse called &quot;just consent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;L. T. Hobhouse, ''Liberalism'', in ''Hobhouse: Liberalism and Other Writings'', James Meadowcroft, editor, Cambridge University Press, 1994, ISBN 978-0-521-43726-4&lt;/ref&gt; F. A. Hayek wrote that Hobhouse's book would have been more accurately titled ''Socialism'', and Hobhouse himself called his beliefs &quot;liberal socialism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Hayek, ''The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism'' (University of Chicago Press, 1991), 110.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Joseph A. Schumpeter attributes this supposed shift in liberal philosophy to the 19th century expansion of the franchise to include the working class. Rising [[literacy]] rates and the spread of knowledge led to social [[activism]] in a variety of forms. [[Social liberalism|Social liberals]] called for laws against [[child labor]], laws requiring minimum standards of [[Occupational safety and health|worker safety]], laws establishing a [[minimum wage]] and old age pensions, and laws regulating banking with the goal of ending cyclic depressions, monopolies, and cartels. ''[[Laissez faire]]'' economic liberals considered such measures to be an unjust imposition upon [[liberty]], as well as a hindrance to [[economic development]], and, as the working class in the West became increasingly prosperous, they also became more conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Schumpeter, ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy'', Routledge, 2010, ISBN 978-0-415-56789-3&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another regularly asserted contrast between classical and modern liberals: classical liberals tend to see government power as the enemy of liberty, while modern liberals fear the concentration of wealth and the expansion of corporate power.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Johnston, ''Syndromes of Corruption: Wealth, Power, and Democracy'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, ISBN 978-0-521-61859-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cat''' ('''''Felis catus'''''), also known as the '''domestic cat''' or '''housecat'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/housecat |title=&quot;Housecat&quot; in the American Heritage Dictionary |publisher=Education.yahoo.com |accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish it from other [[felinae|felines]] and [[felidae|felids]], is a small furry [[Domestication|domesticated]] [[carnivore|carnivorous]] [[mammal]] that is valued by [[human]]s for its companionship and for its ability to hunt [[vermin]] and household pests. Cats have been associated with humans for at least 9,500 years,&lt;ref name=&quot;9500 years&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Oldest Known Pet Cat? 9500-Year-Old Burial Found on Cyprus|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/04/0408_040408_oldestpetcat.html|accessdate = 6 March 2007 |date=8 April 2004|publisher=National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are currently the most popular pet in the world.&lt;ref name=SciAm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-taming-of-the-cat |title=The Evolution of House Cats |publisher=Scientific American |author=Carlos A. Driscoll, Juliet Clutton-Brock, Andrew C. Kitchener and Stephen J. O'Brien |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to their close association with humans, cats are now found almost everywhere in the world.

Cats are similar in [[anatomy]] to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. As [[nocturnal]] predators, cats use their acute hearing and ability to see in near darkness to locate prey. Not only can cats hear sounds too faint for human ears, they can also hear sounds higher in [[frequency]] than humans can perceive. This is because the usual prey of cats (particularly rodents such as mice) make high frequency noises, so the hearing of the cat has [[evolution|evolved]] to pinpoint these faint high-pitched sounds. Cats rely more on smell than taste, and have a much better sense of smell than humans.

Despite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species and use a variety of [[animal communication|vocalization]]s, [[pheromone]]s and types of [[Cat body language|body language]] for [[cat communication|communication]]. These include [[Meowing|meow]]ing, [[purr]]ing, [[trill consonant|trilling]], [[hiss#Animals|hissing]], [[growling]], and grunting.&lt;ref name=Moelk/&gt;

Cats have a rapid breeding rate. Under controlled breeding, they can be bred and shown as [[Cat registry|registered]] pedigree pets, a hobby known as [[animal fancy|cat fancy]]. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering and the abandonment of former household pets has resulted in large numbers of [[feral cat]]s worldwide, with a population of up to 60&amp;nbsp;million of these animals in the United States alone.&lt;ref name=Rochlitz/&gt;

==Nomenclature and etymology==
The word ''cat'' derives from [[Old English]] ''catt'', which belongs to a group of related words in [[Languages of Europe|European languages]], including Welsh ''cath'', Spanish ''gato'', French ''chat'' ({{IPA-fr|ʃa}})&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:fr:chat#Français]]&lt;/ref&gt;, Basque ''katu'', [[Byzantine Greek]] ''Κάτια'' ''kátia'', [[Old Irish]] ''cat'', [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] and Dutch ''kat'', German ''Katze'', [[Armenian language|Armenian]] ''[[wikt:կատու|katu]]'', and [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''kotka''. The ultimate source of all these terms is [[Late Latin]] ''catus, cattus, catta'' &quot;domestic cat&quot;, as opposed to ''feles'' 'European wildcat'. It is unclear whether the Greek or the Latin came first, but they were undoubtedly borrowed from a word in an [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language akin to [[Berber languages|Berber]] ''kaddîska'', meaning 'wildcat'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Cat|url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cat|work=[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php The Online etymology dictionary]|accessdate = 15 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This term was either [[cognate]] with or borrowed from [[Late Egyptian]] ''čaus'' 'jungle cat, African wildcat' (later giving [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ''šau'' 'tomcat'),&lt;ref&gt;Crum, Walter Ewing. ''A Coptic Dictionary]''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1939: 601&lt;/ref&gt; itself from earlier [[Ancient Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''tešau'' 'female cat'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chat-et-cie.fr/chat.htm &quot;Le chat: origines et étymologie.&quot; ''Chat et compagnie''. 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; (vs. ''miew'' 'tomcat').&lt;ref&gt;SenenAnep Meritamen. &quot;[http://www.ancientworlds.net/399761 English to Egyptian Dictionary].&quot; posted 29 August 2004. ''Ancient Worlds''. AncientWorlds LLC, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; The term ''puss'' (as in pussycat) may come from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''poes'' or from [[Low German]] ''Puuskatte'', dialectal [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''kattepus'', or [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''pus'', ''pusekatt'', all of which primarily denote a woman and, by extension, a female cat.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language''.

While ''[[wildcat]]s'' are the ancestral species from which domestic cats are descended, there are several intermediate stages between domestic pet and pedigree cats and these entirely wild cats. The semi-feral cat is a cat that is not owned by any one individual, but is generally friendly to people and may be fed by several households. [[Feral cat]]s are associated with human habitations and may be fed by people or forage in rubbish, but are wary of human interaction. Pseudo-wildcats are descended from domestic cats, but now tend to live entirely independently from people.&lt;ref name=Bradshaw1999/&gt;

A group of cats is referred to as a &quot;clowder&quot;, a male cat is called a &quot;tom&quot; (or a &quot;gib&quot;, if neutered), and a female is called a &quot;molly&quot; or &quot;queen&quot;. The male progenitor of a cat, especially a pedigreed cat, is its &quot;sire&quot;, and its female progenitor is its &quot;dam&quot;. An immature cat is called a &quot;[[kitten]]&quot; (which is also an alternative name for young rats, rabbits, [[hedgehog]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[squirrel]]s and [[skunk]]s).

In [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval Britain]], the word ''kitten'' was interchangeable with the word ''catling''. A cat whose [[genealogy|ancestry]] is formally registered is called a [[pedigree (cat)|pedigreed cat]], [[purebred cat]], or a [[show cat]]. In strict terms, a pure-bred cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed. A pedigreed cat is one whose ancestry is recorded, but may have ancestors of different breeds. Cats of unrecorded mixed ancestry are referred to as [[domestic longhair cat|domestic longhairs]] and [[domestic shorthair cat|domestic shorthairs]] or commonly as random-bred, moggies, mongrels, or mutt-cats.

This also provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain. Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a &quot;pacing&quot; [[gait]]; that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. This trait is shared with [[camel]]s and [[giraffe]]s. As a walk speeds up into a trot, a cat's gait will change to be a &quot;diagonal&quot; gait, similar to other mammals: the diagonally opposite hind and forelegs will move simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Outwitting Cats|first=Wendy|last=Christensen|page=23|publisher=Globe Pequot|year=2004|isbn=1592282407|url=http://books.google.com/?id=WmuQQXU6EtAC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=cats+giraffes+camels+pace&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As cats are familiar and easily kept animals, their physiology has been particularly well studied; it generally resembles that of other carnivorous mammals but displays several unusual features probably attributable to cats' descent from desert-dwelling species.&lt;ref name=MacDonald/&gt; For instance, cats are able to tolerate quite high temperatures: humans generally start to feel uncomfortable when their skin temperature passes about 44.5&amp;nbsp;°C (112&amp;nbsp;°F), but cats show no discomfort until their skin reaches around 52&amp;nbsp;°C (126&amp;nbsp;°F),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Case|2003|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can tolerate temperatures of up to 56&amp;nbsp;°C (133&amp;nbsp;°F) if they have access to water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Subcommittee on Dog and Cat Nutrition Co |title=Nutrient requirements of dogs and cats |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=2006 |page=292 |isbn=0-309-08628-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cats, particularly longhaired cats, occasionally regurgitate [[hairball]]s of fur that have collected in their stomachs from grooming. These clumps of fur are usually sausage-shaped and about two to three centimeters long. Hairballs can be prevented with remedies that ease elimination of the hair through the gut, as well as regular grooming of the coat with a comb or stiff brush.&lt;ref name=hairballs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vet.cornell.edu/FHC/news/hair.htm |title=When Hair Balls Aren't Harmless. |publisher=Cornell Feline Health Center |year=2006 |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spaying females and neutering males will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to [[sex hormone]]s.

When fighting, cats make themselves appear more impressive and threatening by raising their fur and arching their backs, thus increasing their apparent size.&lt;ref name=behaviourguide&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animal.discovery.com/guides/cats/behavior/bodylanguageintro.html |title=Cat Guide: Body Language |publisher=Animal Planet |accessdate=26 August 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080630210950/http://animal.discovery.com/guides/cats/behavior/bodylanguageintro.html |archivedate = 30 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. Attacks usually comprise powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites, but serious damage is rare; usually the loser runs away with little more than a few scratches to the face, and sometimes the ears. Cats will also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pets_for_life_program/cat_behavior_tip_sheets/aggression_between_family_cats.html Aggression Between Family Cats]{{dead link|date=April 2011}} ''The Humane Society of the United States'' 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, serious injuries from fighting will be limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of [[feline immunodeficiency virus]] (FIV).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pedersen NC, Yamamoto JK, Ishida T, Hansen H |title=Feline immunodeficiency virus infection |journal=Vet.

===Hunting and feeding===
Cats feed on small prey, primarily birds and rodents.&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt; Feral cats and house cats that are free-fed tend to consume many small meals in a single day, although the frequency and size of meals varies between individuals.&lt;ref name=Bradshaw&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bradshaw JW, Goodwin D, Legrand-Defrétin V, Nott HM |title=Food selection by the domestic cat, an obligate carnivore |journal=Comp.

Although it is not certain, the type of strategy used may depend on the prey species in the area, with for example, cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds.&lt;ref name=Turner153&gt;{{Harv|Turner|Bateson|2000|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for settling in high places, or perching. In the wild, a higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats may strike prey by pouncing from such a perch as a tree branch, as does a [[leopard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Why Do Cats Like High Places?|publisher=Dr. Holly Nash, DVM, MS|url =http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=1+1313&amp;aid=1125|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080102145008/http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?cls=1&amp;cat=1313&amp;articleid=1125|archivedate=2 January 2008|work=Drs. Foster &amp; Smith, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible explanations include that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territory. During a fall from a high place, a cat can reflexively twist its body and right itself using its acute [[equilibrioception|sense of balance]] and flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Falling Cats|url = http://www.verrueckte-experimente.de/leseproben_e.html|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051026122408/http://www.verrueckte-experimente.de/leseproben_e.html|archivedate = 26 October 2005|accessdate = 24 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the cat's &quot;[[cat righting reflex|righting reflex]]&quot;. It always rights itself in the same way, provided it has the time to do so, during a fall. The height required for this to occur is around 90&amp;nbsp;cm (3&amp;nbsp;feet). Cats without a tail also have this ability, since a cat mostly moves its hind legs and relies on conservation of [[angular momentum]] to set up for landing, and the tail is in fact little used for this feat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://helix.gatech.edu/Classes/ME3760/1998Q3/Projects/Nguyen/|title=How does a Cat always land on its feet?|author=Huy D.

[[File:Cat-eating-prey.jpg|thumb|Eating a [[house sparrow]]]]

One poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human owners. [[Ethology|Ethologist]] Paul Leyhausen proposed that cats adopt humans into their social group, and share excess kill with others in the group according to the local [[pecking order]], in which humans are placed at or near the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Leyhausen |first=Paul |title=Cat Behavior: The Predatory and Social Behavior of Domestic and Wild Cats |year=1978 |isbn=978-0824070175 |publisher=Garland STPM Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist and animal scientist [[Desmond Morris]], in his 1986 book ''Catwatching'', suggests that when cats bring home mice or birds, they are teaching their human to hunt, or helping their human as if feeding &quot;an elderly cat, or an inept kitten&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Since cats cannot fully close their mouths to create suction, they use a lapping method with the tongue to draw liquid upwards into their mouths. Lapping at a rate of four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue to the surface of the water, and quickly retracts it, drawing water upwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Reproduction===
[[File:Cats having sex in Israel.jpg|thumb|When cats mate, the male [[Tomcat|tom]] bites the scruff of the female's neck as she assumes a position conducive to [[mating]].]]
Female cats are seasonally [[polyestrous]], which means they may have many periods of heat over the course of a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days.&lt;ref name=compendium/&gt; Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female will reject the male, but eventually the female will allow the male to mate. The female will utter a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her. This is because a male cat's [[penis]] has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing spines, which are about one [[millimeter]] long;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Aronson LR, Cooper ML |title=Penile spines of the domestic cat: their endocrine-behavior relations |journal=Anat. Rec. |volume=157 |issue=1 |pages=71–8 |year=1967|pmid=6030760 |doi=10.1002/ar.1091570111 |url=http://www.catcollection.org/files/PenileSpines.pdf |format=PDF|first1=LR |first2=ML|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's [[vagina]], which is a trigger for [[ovulation]]. This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a 2nd (or more) mating, thus giving the latter males a larger chance of conception.

After mating, the female will wash her [[vulva]] thoroughly. If a male attempts to mate with her at this point, the female will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.&lt;ref name=compendium/&gt;

Because ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wildt DE, Seager SW, Chakraborty PK |title=Effect of copulatory stimuli on incidence of ovulation and on serum luteinizing hormone in the cat |journal=Endocrinology |volume=107 |issue=4 |pages=1212–7 |year=1980|pmid=7190893 |doi=10.1210/endo-107-4-1212 |first1=DE |first2=SW |first3=PK|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, cats are [[superfecundation|superfecund]]; that is, a female may mate with more than one male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathers.&lt;ref name=compendium&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vlsstore.com/Media/PublicationsArticle/PV_23_12_1049.pdf |format=PDF|title=Prolific Cats: The Estrous Cycle |publisher=Veterinary Learning Systems |accessdate=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, there are few scientific data available to assess the impact of cat predation on prey populations.

Some of the same factors that have promoted [[adaptive radiation]] of island [[Bird|avifauna]] over evolutionary time appear to promote vulnerability to non-native species in modern time. The susceptibility inherent of many island birds is undoubtedly due to evolution in the absence of mainland predators, competitors, diseases and parasites. In addition to lower reproductive rates and extended incubation periods.&lt;ref name=dowd&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Dowding|first=J.E.|coauthors= Murphy, E.C.|year=2001 |title= The Impact of Predation be Introduced Mammals on Endemic Shorebirds in New Zealand: A Conservation Perspective. |journal=Biological Conservation|volume=99|pages=47–64|doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(00)00187-7| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of flight, or reduced flying ability is also characteristic of many island endemics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Whiting|first=M.F.|coauthors= Bradler, S. and Maxwell, T.|year=2003 |title= Loss and Recovery of Wings in Stick Insects |journal=Nature|volume=421|pages=264–267|doi=10.1038/nature01313|pmid=12529642|issue=6920| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; These biological aspects have increased vulnerability to extinction in the presence of introduced species, such as the domestic cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=WCMC|first=.|year=1992|title= World Conservation Monitoring Centre.|publisher=Chapman and Hall. |coauthor= McComb, J., Groombridge, B., Byford, E., Allan, C., Howland, J., Magin, C., Smith, H., Greenwood, V. and Simpson, L.|isbn=2831701562}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, behavioural traits exhibited by island species, such as ‘predatory naivety’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Steadman|first=D.W.|coauthors= Martin, P.S.|year=2003 |title= The Late Quaternary Extinction and Future Resurrection of Birds on Pacific Islands |journal=Earth Science Reviews|volume=61|pages=133–147|doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00116-2| ref=harv|bibcode=2003ESRv...61..133S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ground-nesting,&lt;ref name=dowd/&gt; have also contributed to their susceptibility.

It has long been common for cats to be eaten in some parts of China and in some other Asian countries. According to the ''Chengdu Business Daily'', people in southern China's [[Guangdong]] province ate 10,000 cats a day.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28292558/ China protesters: Stop 'cooking cats alive'].&quot; Msnbc.com. 18 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal People estimates that 4&amp;nbsp;million cats are killed and consumed in Asia every year.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.animalpeoplenews.org/03/9/dogs.catseatenAsia903.html How many dogs and cats are eaten in Asia?]&quot;.

===Domesticated varieties===
{{Main|Cat breed}}
[[File:Chocolate Persian.jpg|thumb|right|A [[purebred]] chocolate [[Persian (cat)|Persian]]]]
The concept of a cat breed appeared in Britain during the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Mason|1984|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[list of cat breeds]] is quite large: with the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] recognizing 41 breeds, of which 16 are &quot;natural breeds&quot; that probably emerged before humans began breeding pedigree cats, while the others were developed over the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Lipinski/&gt; The owners and breeders of show cats compete to see whose animal bears the closest resemblance to the &quot;ideal&quot; definition and standard of the breed (see [[selective breeding]]). Because of common crossbreeding in populated areas, many cats are simply identified as belonging to the homogeneous breeds of [[domestic longhaired cat|domestic longhair]] and [[domestic shorthaired cat|domestic shorthair]], depending on their type of fur. In the United Kingdom and Australasia, non-purebred cats are referred in slang as moggies (derived from &quot;Maggie&quot;, short for Margaret, reputed to have been a common name for cows and calves in 18th century England and latter applied to housecats during the [[Victorian era]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-mog1.htm
| title=Moggie
| publisher=Worldwidewords.org
| accessdate=15 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a non-purebred cat is sometimes referred to in slang as a barn or alley cat, even if it is not a [[feral cat|stray]].

Cats come in a variety of colors and patterns. These are physical properties and should not be confused with a breed of cat. Furthermore, cats may show the color and/or pattern particular to a certain breed without actually being of that breed. For example, cats may have seal point coloration, but not be [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese]].

Some original cat breeds that have a distinct phenotype that is the main type occurring naturally as the dominant domesticated cat type in their region of origin are sometimes considered as subspecies and also have received names as such in nomenclature, although this is not supported by feline biologists. Some of these cat breeds are:
*''F. catus anura'' – the Manx – The Manx is a stocky, solid cat with a dense double [[Coat (animal)|coat]] (long or short), a compact body, very short back, hind legs that are visibly longer than the front legs, big bones, a wide chest, and greater depth of flank (sides of the cat nearest the rear) than other cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fanciers.com/breed-faqs/manx-faq.html#description| title=Description|accessdate= 25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A female Manx would not weigh more than {{convert|10|lb}} and a male does not weigh over {{convert|12|lb}}. Specific to this breed is the way their ears appear as a &quot;cradle&quot; when looked at from behind. A Manx cat is mainly recognized by its appearance as it does not have a tail. Although some of them may have a small tail, most Manx cats are tailless. Because of the genetic deformation of these cats they are susceptible of developing what is called Manx Syndrome, a condition that could be fatal for a kitten. Although the gene normally affects only the tail, there is the risk of causing damage to the [[Vertebra|spine]] such as fused vertebrae.
*''F. catus siamensis'' – the Siamese – Siamese cats are amongst the firstly recognized Oriental cats, a type of cat with a long body but an elegant posture. The length is the main characteristic based on which these cats are distinguished. Their body, legs and tail are all long and still Siamese cats are known for their grace. Also, they are famous because of their blue almond eyes and they are also called &quot;people cats&quot; because of the affection they show to their owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/siamese.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080511203954/http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/siamese.html|archivedate=2008-05-11| title=Breed Profile: Siamese|accessdate= 25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''F. catus cartusenensis'' – the Chartreux – The Chartreux is a natural French breed, which is easily recognized by its size, grayish color and double coat. These cats are also famous because of the paradox coming from the combination between a massively build body and smiling expression and sweet [[voice]].
*''F. catus angorensis'' – the Turkish Angora

====Coat patterns====
[[Cat coat genetics]] can produce a variety of coat patterns. Some of the most common are:

[[File:Co-kbk-07-001.jpg|thumb|Blue (grey) and white bicolor cat]]
; [[Bicolor cat|Bicolor, Tuxedo and Van]] :This pattern varies between the [[tuxedo cat]] which is mostly black with a white chest, and possibly markings on the face and paws/legs, all the way to the ''Van'' pattern (so named after the [[Lake Van]] area in Turkey, which gave rise to the [[Turkish Van]] breed), where the only colored parts of the cat are the tail (usually including the base of the tail proper), and the top of the head (often including the ears). There are several other terms for amounts of white between these two extremes, such as ''Harlequin'' or ''[[jellicle]] cat''. Bicolor cats can have as their primary (non-white) color black, red, any dilution thereof, and tortoiseshell (see below for definition).

[[File:Felis silvestris - July 2007-1.jpg|thumb|Mackerel tabby, showing the characteristic &quot;M&quot; on its forehead.]]
; [[Tabby]] :Striped, with a variety of patterns. The classic blotched tabby (or marbled) pattern is the most common and consists of butterflies and bullseyes. The mackerel or striped tabby is a series of vertical stripes down the cat's side (resembling the fish). This pattern broken into spots is referred to as a spotted tabby. Finally, the tabby markings may look like a series of ticks on the fur, thus the ticked tabby, which is almost exclusively associated with the Abyssinian breed of cats. The worldwide evolution of the cat means that certain types of tabby are associated with certain countries; for instance, blotched tabbies are quite rare outside NW Europe, where they are the most common type.

[[File:Curlycat02.jpg|thumb|Female tortoiseshell-and-white cat.]]
; [[Tortoiseshell cat|Tortoiseshell and calico]]
: This cat is also known as a calimanco cat or clouded tiger cat, and by the abbreviation 'tortie'. In the cat fancy, a tortoiseshell cat is patched over with red (or its dilute form, cream) and black (or its dilute blue) mottled throughout the coat. Additionally, the cat may have white spots in its fur, which make it a 'tortoiseshell and white' cat; if there is a significant amount of white in the fur and the red and black colors form a patchwork rather than a mottled aspect, in North America the cat will be called a calico. All calicos are tortoiseshell (as they carry both black and red), but not all tortoiseshells are calicos (which requires a significant amount of white in the fur and patching rather than mottling of the colors). The calico is also sometimes called a tricolor cat. The Japanese refer to this pattern as ''mi-ke'' (meaning &quot;triple fur&quot;), while the Dutch call these cats ''lapjeskat'' (meaning &quot;patches cat&quot;). A true tricolor must consist of three colors: a reddish color, dark or light; white; and one other color, typically a brown, black, or blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Torties, Calicos and Tricolor cats|url=http://www.fanciers.com/cat-faqs/tricolors.shtml| accessdate=24 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both tortoiseshell and calico cats are typically female because the coat pattern is the result of differential [[X chromosome]] [[x-inactivation|inactivation]] in females (which, as with all normal female mammals, have two X chromosomes). Conversely, cats where the overall color is ginger (orange) are commonly male (roughly in a 3:1 ratio). In a litter sired by a ginger tom, the females will be tortoiseshell or ginger. Male tortoiseshells can occur as a result of chromosomal abnormalities (often linked to sterility) or by a phenomenon known as [[mosaic (genetics)|mosaicism]], where two early stage embryos are merged into a single kitten.

[[File:Niobe050905-Siamese Cat.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Siamese (cat)|Siamese cat]], classical colorpoint pattern.]]

; [[Point (coat color)|Colorpoint]]
: The colorpoint pattern is most commonly associated with Siamese cats, but may also appear in any domesticated cat. A colorpointed cat has dark colors on the face, ears, feet, and tail, with a lighter version of the same color on the rest of the body, and possibly some white. The exact name of the colorpoint pattern depends on the actual color, so there are seal points (dark brown), chocolate points (warm lighter brown), blue points (dark gray), lilac or frost points (silvery gray-pink), red or flame points (orange), and tortie (tortoiseshell mottling) points, among others. This pattern is the result of a [[Mutation#Special classes|temperature sensitive mutation]] in one of the [[enzyme]]s in the [[metabolic pathway]] from [[tyrosine]] to pigment, such as [[melanin]]; thus, little or no pigment is produced except in the extremities or points where the skin is slightly cooler. For this reason, colorpointed cats tend to darken with age as bodily temperature drops; also, the fur over a significant injury may sometimes darken or lighten as a result of temperature change.

: The tyrosine pathway also produces [[neurotransmitter]]s, thus mutations in the early parts of that pathway may affect not only pigment, but also neurological development. This results in a higher frequency of [[strabismus|cross-eyes]] among colorpointed cats, as well as the [[White tiger#Genetics and albinism|high frequency of cross-eyes in white tigers]].

; White cats
[[File:Cat Gato branco.jpg|thumb|White cat]]
: True albinism (a mutation of the tyrosinase gene) is quite rare in cats. Much more common is the appearance of white coat color that is caused by a lack of [[melanocyte]]s in the skin. A [[Melanin#Genetic disorders and disease states|higher frequency of deafness in white cats]] is due to a reduction in the population and survival of melanoblast stem cells, which in addition to creating pigment producing cells, develop into a variety of neurological cell types. White cats with one or two blue eyes have a particularly high likelihood of being deaf.

; Smoke cats
: The bottom eighth of each hair is white or creamy-white, with the rest of the hair being a solid color. Genetically this color is a non-[[agouti signalling peptide|agouti]] cat with the dominant inhibitor gene; a non-agouti version of the silver [[tabby cat|tabby]]. Smoke cats will look solid colored until they move, when the white undercoat becomes apparent. It is mostly found in [[cat breed|pedigreed cat]]s (especially longhair breeds) but also present in some [[domestic longhaired cat]]s.

====Body types====
Cats can also come in several body types, ranging between two extremes:

; Oriental: Not a specific breed, but any cat with an elongated slender build, almond-shaped eyes, long nose, large ears (the Siamese and [[Oriental Shorthair]] breeds are examples of this).
; Foreign: Less slender than the oriental type, but nevertheless a cat with a slight build and generally athletic look. Typical example breeds would be the [[Abyssinian (cat)|Abyssinian cat]] and the [[Turkish Angora]]. Some people consider the foreign and oriental body types as being the same, however.
; Semi-Foreign: More or less the middle range of body conformation types, this type of cat is less slender without being stocky. Example breeds would be the [[Devon Rex]] and the [[Egyptian Mau]].
; Semi-Cobby: These cats look more rounded without looking too stocky. Example breeds would be the [[American Shorthair]] and [[British Shorthair]].
; Cobby: Any cat with a short, muscular, compact build, roundish eyes, short nose, and small ears. [[Persian (cat)|Persian cat]]s and [[Exotic Shorthair|Exotic cat]]s are two prime examples of such a body type.

===Effects on human health===
Because of their small size, domesticated house cats pose little physical danger to adult humans. However, in the USA cats inflict about 400,000 bites per year, with 90% of these bites coming from provoked animals; this number represents about one in ten of all animal bites.&lt;ref name=Kravetz/&gt; Many cat bites will become infected,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Talan DA, Citron DM, Abrahamian FM, Moran GJ, Goldstein EJ |title=Bacteriologic analysis of infected dog and cat bites.

As well as posing health risks, interactions with cats may improve health and reduce physical responses to stress: for example the presence of cats may moderate increased [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Allen K, Blascovich J, Mendes WB |title=Cardiovascular reactivity and the presence of pets, friends, and spouses: the truth about cats and dogs |journal=Psychosom Med |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=727–39 |year=2002 |pmid=12271103 |doi=10.1097/01.PSY.0000024236.11538.41 |first1=K |first2=J |first3=WB |format=Free full text|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cat ownership may also improve psychological health by providing emotional support and dispelling feelings of depression, anxiety and loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Fogle|1981|pp=23–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ability to provide companionship and friendship are common reasons given for owning a cat.&lt;ref name=Gallup/&gt;

From another point of view, cats are thought to be able to improve the general [[mood (psychology)|mood]] of their owners by alleviating negative attitudes. According to a Swiss study carried out in 2003, cats may change the overall psychological state of their owner as their company's effect appears to be comparable to that of a human partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.scientificcommons.org/20081280| title=Spouses and cats and their effects on human mood|accessdate= 25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers concluded that, while cats were not shown to promote positive moods, they do alleviate negative ones.

Several studies have shown that cats develop affection towards their owners. However, the effect of these pets on human health is closely related to the time and effort the cat owner is able to invest in it, in terms of bonding, playing and buying accessories for their pet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catadmirer.com/| title=Cat Supplies|accessdate= 25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indoor scratching===
A natural behavior in cats is to periodically hook their front claws into suitable surfaces and pull backwards.

Scratching posts made of [[sisal]] rope or [[corrugated fiberboard|corrugated cardboard]] are also common.

Although scratching can serve cats to keep their claws from growing excessively long, their nails can be trimmed if necessary. Another response to indoor scratching is [[onychectomy]], commonly known as declawing. This is a surgical procedure to remove the claw and first bone of each digit of a cat's paws. Declawing is most commonly only performed on the front feet. A related procedure is [[tendonectomy]], which involves cutting a tendon needed for cats to extend their claws.&lt;ref name=Swiderski&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Swiderski J |title=Onychectomy and its alternatives in the feline patient |journal=Clin Tech Small Anim Pract |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=158–61 |year=2002 |pmid=12587280 |doi=10.1053/svms.2002.36604 |first1=J|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Declawing is a major surgical procedure and can produce pain, infections and permanent lameness.&lt;ref name=Swiderski/&gt;

Since this surgery is almost always performed for the benefit of owners, it is controversial and remains uncommon outside of North America.&lt;ref name=AMAwelfare&gt;[http://www.avma.org/reference/backgrounders/declawing_bgnd.pdf Welfare Implications of Declawing of Domestic Cats] ''American Veterinary Medical Association'' 9 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, declawing is prohibited by [[animal welfare]] laws and it is ethically controversial within the veterinary community.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Patronek GJ |title=Assessment of claims of short- and long-term complications associated with onychectomy in cats |journal=J.

Cats bury their urine and feces. Indoor cats are usually provided with a box containing [[cat litter|litter]], typically [[bentonite]], but sometimes other absorbent material such as shredded paper or wood chips, or sometimes [[sand]] or similar material. It should be cleaned daily and changed often, depending on the number of cats in a household and the type of litter; if it is not kept clean, a cat may be fastidious enough to find other locations in the house for urination or defecation. This may also happen for other reasons; for instance, if a cat becomes [[constipation|constipated]] and defecation is uncomfortable, it may associate the discomfort with the litter box and avoid it in favor of another location.

Daily attention to the litter box also serves as a monitor of the cat's health. Bentonite or clumping litter is a variation which absorbs urine into clumps which can be sifted out along with feces, and thus stays cleaner longer with regular sifting, but has sometimes been reported to cause health problems in some cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=8888544 |year=1996 |last1=Hornfeldt |first1=CS |last2=Westfall |title=Suspected bentonite toxicosis in a cat from ingestion of clay cat litter. |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=365–6 |journal=Veterinary and human toxicology |author2=Westfall|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some cats can be trained to use the human toilet, eliminating the litter box and its attendant expense, [[unpleasant odor]], and the need to use landfill space for disposal. Training may involve four to six weeks of incremental moves, such as moving and elevating the litter box until it is near the toilet, as well as employing an adapter such as a bowl or small box to suspend the litter above the toilet bowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toilettrainedcat.com/toilet-train-cat.php |title=A Step-By-Step Guide on How To Train Your Cat to Use the Human Toilet |publisher=The Toilet Trained Cat |accessdate=15 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When training is complete, the cat uses the toilet by squatting on the toilet seat over the bowl.

==Feral cats==
{{Main|Feral cat}}
[[File:Feral cat Virginia crop.jpg|thumb|upright|American feral [[farm cat]].]]

[[Feral cat]]s are wild cats that are unfamiliar with humans and roam freely in urban or rural areas.&lt;ref name=Rochlitz&gt;{{Cite book|author=Irene Rochlitz |title=The Welfare of Cats (Animal Welfare) |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2007 |pages=141–175 |isbn=1-4020-6143-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers of feral cats are not known, but estimates of the US feral population range from 25 to 60&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=Rochlitz/&gt; Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large groups called [[feral cat colony|feral colonies]], which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food.&lt;ref name=hsus-feral&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080501093143/http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affecting_our_pets/feral_cats/feral_cats_frequently_asked_questions.html#1_What_is_a_feral_cat What is the difference between a stray cat and a feral cat?] Humane Society of the United States&lt;/ref&gt; Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the [[Colosseum]] and [[Forum Romanum]], with cats at some of these sites being fed and vetted by volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romancats.com/index_eng.php Torre Argentina cat shelter].

Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark the feral as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again.&lt;ref name=hsus-feral/&gt; Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives, and not only is their lifespan greatly increased, but behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are also greatly reduced.&lt;ref name=hsus-feral/&gt;

==History and mythology==
{{Main|Cultural depictions of cats|Cats in ancient Egypt}}
[[File:Egypte louvre 058.jpg|thumb|upright|Egyptian sculpture at the [[Louvre]].]]

Traditionally, historians tended to think that [[ancient Egypt]] was the site of cat domestication, owing to the clear depictions of house cats in Egyptian paintings about 3,600 years old.&lt;ref name=Driscoll/&gt; However, in 2004, a Neolithic grave was excavated in [[Shillourokambos]], Cyprus, that contained the skeletons, laid close to one another, of both a human and a cat. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, pushing back the earliest known feline-human association significantly.&lt;ref name=&quot;9500 years&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Hazel |last=Muir|title=Ancient remains could be oldest pet cat |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4867.html |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=8 April 2004 |accessdate=23 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Marsha|last=Walton |title=Ancient burial looks like human and pet cat |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/TECH/science/04/08/cats.cyprus/index.html |publisher=CNN|date= 9 April 2004|accessdate=23 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cat specimen is large and closely resembles the [[African wildcat]] (''Felis silvestris lybica''), rather than present-day domestic cats. This discovery, combined with genetic studies, suggest that cats were probably domesticated in the Near East, in the [[Fertile Crescent]] around the time of the development of agriculture and then they were brought to Cyprus and Egypt.&lt;ref name=Driscoll&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Driscoll CA, Menotti-Raymond M, Roca AL |title=The Near Eastern origin of cat domestication |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5837 |pages=519–23 |year=2007 |pmid=17600185 |doi=10.1126/science.1139518 |first1=CA |first2=M |first3=AL |first4=K |first5=WE |first6=E |first7=EH |first8=M |first9=D |first11=N |last12=O'brien |first12=SJ |last13=Macdonald |first13=DW|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Egypt]] cats were [[animal worship|sacred animal]]s, with [[Bastet|Bast]] often depicted in cat form, sometimes taking on the warlike aspect of a lioness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Mason|1984|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] are often credited with introducing the domestic cat from Egypt to Europe;&lt;ref name=Mason223&gt;{{Harv|Mason|1984|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Gallia Aquitania|Roman Aquitaine]], a 1st or 2nd century epitaph of a young girl holding a cat is one of two earliest depictions of the Roman domesticated cat.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Veyne, &quot;The Household and its Freed Slaves&quot;, in Philippe Ariès and Georges Duby, eds, ''A History of Private Life !; FromPagan Rome to Byzantium'' 198781 and illustration (Bordeaux, Aquitaine Museum)&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible that cats were already kept in Europe prior to the [[Roman Empire]], as they may have already been present in Britain in the late [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref name=OConnor/&gt; Domestic cats were spread throughout much of the rest of the world during the [[Age of Discovery]], as they were carried on [[sailing ship]]s to control shipboard rodents and as good-luck charms.&lt;ref name=Mason223/&gt;
[[File:Freya by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Freyja]] and her cats]]
Several ancient religions believed that cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that they are all-knowing but are mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans. In Japan, the [[Maneki Neko]] is a cat that is a symbol of good fortune. Although there are no sacred species in Islam, some writers have stated that [[Muhammad]] had a favorite cat, [[Muezza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Geyer, Georgie Anne|year = 2004|title = When Cats Reigned Like Kings: On the Trail of the Sacred Cats|isbn = 0740746979|publisher=Andrews McMeel Pub.|location = Kansis City}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is reported to have loved cats so much that &quot;he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one that was sleeping on it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reeves&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author=Minou Reeves|title = Muhammad in Europe|publisher=New York University (NYU) Press|page = 52|isbn = 0814775330|year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freyja]]—the goddess of love, beauty, and fertility in [[Norse mythology]]—is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by cats.

Many cultures have negative [[superstition]]s about cats. An example would be the belief that a [[black cat]] &quot;crossing your path&quot; leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s used to augment a witch's powers and skills. This led to the widespread extermination of cats in Europe in [[medieval]] times. The [[Black Plague]] was spread by [[flea]]s carried by infected rats, and the killing of cats ostensibly caused an increase in the rat population. The killing of cats in Medieval [[Ypres]] is commemorated in the innocuous present-day [[Kattenstoet]] (cat parade).

According to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives. In many countries, they are believed to have nine lives, but in some Spanish-speaking regions they are said to have seven lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://elcomercio.pe/impresa/notas/vidas-gato/20100307/423959|date=7 March 2010|accessdate=19 March 2010|author=Nora Sugobono|language= Spanish|title= Las vidas del gato|publisher=El Comercio}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Turkish and Arabic traditions the number of lives is six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Guardian |location=UK|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/gallery/2010/mar/18/guide-to-pets-pet-myths?picture=360591960|accessdate=18 March 2010|author=Tim Dowling|title= Tall tails: Pet myths busted|location=London|date=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations.&lt;ref name=myth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.best-cat-art.com/cat-myths.html |title=Cat Myths, Misinformation and Untruths |publisher=Best-cat-art.com |accessdate=22 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also lending credence to this myth is that [[cat righting reflex|falling cats]] often land on their feet because of an inbuilt automatic twisting reaction and are able to twist their bodies around to land feet first, though they can still be injured or killed by a high fall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cats.about.com/od/catsafety/a/highrisefalls.htm The ASPCA Warns About High-Rise Falls by Cats.] About.com&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''clade'''&lt;ref group=note&gt;(from [[Ancient Greek]] ''{{Polytonic|κλάδος}}'', ''klados'', &quot;branch&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; is a group consisting of an organism and all its descendants. In the terms of [[systematics|biological systematics]], a clade is a single &quot;branch&quot; on the &quot;[[Tree of life (science)|tree of life]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Dupuis&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dupuis | first=Claude | year=1984 | title=Willi Hennig's impact on taxonomic thought | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=15 | pages=1–24 | issn=0066-4162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that such a &quot;natural group&quot; of organisms should be grouped together and given a [[Taxonomy|taxonomic]] name is central to [[biological classification]]. In [[cladistics]] (which takes its name from the term), clades are the only acceptable units.

The term was coined in 1958 by [[England|English]] biologist [[Julian Huxley]].&lt;ref name=Dupuis/&gt;

===Clade and ancestor===
A clade is termed [[monophyletic]], meaning it contains one ancestor which can be an organism, [[population]], or [[species]] and all its descendants.&lt;ref group=note&gt;
A semantic case has been made that the name should be &quot;holophyletic,&quot; but this term has not yet acquired widespread use. For more information, see ''[[holophyly]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The PhyloCode, Chapter 1|url=http://www.ohio.edu/phylocode/art1-3.html#chapter1|year=2009|publisher=International Society for Phylogenetic Nomenclature|accessdate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | volume = 94
 | page = 217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term clade refers to the grouping of the ancestor and its living and/or deceased descendants together. The ancestor can be a theoretical or actual species.

===Clade definition===
Three methods of defining clades are featured in [[phylogenetic nomenclature]]: node-, stem-, and apomorphy-based:
* In node-based definition, clade name A refers to the ''least inclusive'' clade containing taxa (or specimens) X, Y, etc., and their common ancestor. The ancestor is the branch point, or ''node''.
* In stem-based definition, A refers to the ''most inclusive'' clade containing X, Y, etc., and their common ancestor, down to where Z branches off below A. Taxa are included between the node of A and down to (but not including) the branching point to Z; that is, the ''[[Crown group#Stem groups|stem]]'' of A.
* In [[apomorphy]]-based definition, A refers to the clade identified by an apomorphy (a trait) found in X, Y, etc., and their common ancestor.

In [[Linnaean taxonomy]], clades are defined by a set of traits (apomorphies) unique to the group. This system is basically similar to the apomorphy-based clades of phylogenetic nomenclature. The difference is one of weight: While phylogenetic nomenclature bases the group on an ancestor with a certain trait, Linnaean taxonomy uses the traits themselves to define the group.

===Clades as constructs===
In [[cladistics]], the clade is a hypothetical construct based on experimental data. Clades are found using multiple (sometimes hundreds) of traits from a number of species (or specimens) and [[analysis|analysing]] them [[statistics|statistically]] to find the most likely phylogenetic tree for the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jaako|last=Hyvönen|year=2005|title=Monophyly, consensus, compromise|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~jhyvonen/ec05/05_11.11.pdf|format=pdf|publisher=University of Helsinki|accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although similar in some ways to a [[biological classification]] of species, the method is statistical and more open to scrutiny than traditional methods. With changing phylogenetic analysis, the actual content of any defined clade involved may change as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nixon|first=Kevin C.|coauthors=Carpenter, James M.|title=On the Other “Phylogenetic Systematics”|journal=Cladistics|year=2000|volume=16|pages=298–318|doi=10.1006/clad.2000.0137|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1096-0031.2000.tb00285.x/pdf|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Although taxonomists use clades as a tool in classification where feasible, the taxonomic &quot;[[Tree of life (science)|tree of life]]&quot; is not the same as the cladistic. The traditional genus, family, etc. names are not necessarily clades; though they will often be.

===Clade names===
In Linnaean systematics, the various groups are ordered into a series of [[taxonomic rank]]s (the familiar [[order (biology)|order]], [[family (biology)|family]] etc.). These ranks will by convention dictate the ending to names for some groups. Clades do not by their nature fit this scheme, and no such restriction exists as to their names in [[cladistics]]. There is however a convention for naming more or less inclusive groups, which are given prefixes like ''crown-'' or ''pan-'', see [[Crown group]].

== Taxonomy and systematics ==

[[File:Haeckel arbol bn.png|thumb|right|Early phylogenetic tree by [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], 1866]]

The idea of a &quot;clade&quot; did not exist in pre-[[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] [[Linnaean taxonomy]], which was based only on [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] similarities between organisms – although it happens that many of the better known animal groups in Linnaeus' original [[Systema Naturae]] (notably among the [[vertebrate]] groups) do represent clades. With the publication of Darwin's [[Evolution|theory of evolution]] in 1859, taxonomy gained a theoretical basis, and the idea was born that groups used in a system of classification should represent branches on the evolutionary [[tree of life]]. In the century and a half since then, taxonomists have worked to make the taxonomic system reflect evolution. However, partly because the Tree of Life branches rather unevenly, the [[hierarchy]] of the Linnaean system does not always lend itself well to representing clades. The result is that when it comes to [[Nomenclature#Biology|naming]], [[cladistics]] and [[Linnaean taxonomy]] are not always compatible. In particular, higher level taxa in Linnaean taxonomy often represent [[evolutionary grade]]s rather than clades, resulting in groups made up of clades where one or two sub-branches have been excluded. Typical examples include [[Osteichthyes|bony fishes]], which include the ancestor of [[tetrapoda|tetrapods]], and [[reptiles]], ancestral to both [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The term &quot;reptile&quot; is here to be understood as traditionally defined, e.g. Romer &amp; Parson (1985): ''The Vertebrate Body.'' (6th ed.) Saunders, Philadelphia. There are other (cladistic) definitions of &quot;reptile&quot; that exclude the first [[amniote]]s and the [[synapsid]] line, see [[Sauropsida]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[phylogenetic nomenclature]], clades can be nested at any level, and do not have to be slotted into a small number of [[ranking|ranks]] in an overall hierarchy. In contrast, the Linnaean units of &quot;[[order (biology)|order]]&quot;, &quot;[[class (biology)|class]]&quot; etc. must be used when naming a new taxon. As there are only seven formal levels to the Linnaean system ([[species]] being the lowest), only a finite number of sub- and super-units can be created. In order to be able to use the full complexity of taxonomic trees ([[cladogram]]s) in an area with which they are very familiar, some researchers have opted to dispense with ranks all together, instead using clade names without Linnaean ranks. The reason for preferring one system over the other is partly one of application: cladistic trees give details, suitable for specialists; the Linnaean system gives a well ordered overview, at the expense of details of the phylogenetic tree.

In a few instances, the Linnaean system has actually impeded our understanding of the phylogeny and broad evolutionary patterns. The best known example is the interpretation of the strange [[fossils of the Burgess Shale]] and the subsequent idea of a &quot;[[Cambrian Explosion]]&quot;
&lt;ref name=Budd2000&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
With the application of cladistics, and the rejection of any significance of the concept of [[phylum|phyla]], the confusion of the late 20th century over the Burgess animals has been resolved. It appears there never was an &quot;explosion&quot; of major [[bauplan]]s with subsequent [[extinction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =  Erwin, D.H.| year =  2007| doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00614.x| title = Disparity: Morphological Pattern And Developmental Context| journal = Palaeontology| volume = 50| pages = 57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The seemingly weird critters themselves have been found to be representatives of a group, the [[Lobopodia]], that includes [[Arthropoda|arthropods]], [[Tardigrada|water bears]] and [[Onychophora|velvet worms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In most instances the two systems are not at odds, however. The cladistic statement, that the clade Lobopodia contains (among others) the Arthropoda, Tardigrada and Onychophora, is factually identical to the Linnaean evolutionary statement that the group Lobopodia is ancestral to the phyla Arthropoda, Tardigrada and Onychophora. The difference is one of semantics rather than phylogeny.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Communications in [[Afghanistan]]''' has dramatically increased since 2002, and has embarked on wireless companies, internet, radio stations and television channels. Afghan telecommunication companies, such as [[Afghan Wireless]] and [[Roshan (Telecom)|Roshan]], have been boasting rapid increase in cellular phone usage in the mid 2000s. In response to this [[Etisalat]] and [[MTN Group]] were launched in 2007. 

The [[Ministry of Communications (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Communications]] signed a $64.5 agreement in 2006 with China's [[ZTE]] on the establishment of a countrywide [[optical fiber]] [[cable network]]. The plan was intended to improve telephone, internet, television and radio broadcast services throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pajhwok.com/viewstory.asp?lng=eng&amp;id=26882 ''Ministry signs contract with Chinese company''], Pajhwok Afghan News.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telephone==
{{See|Telephone numbers in Afghanistan}}
There are 12 million [[mobile phone]] lines (cellular phone lines) in Afghanistan as of 2009&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2151.html?countryName=Afghanistan&amp;countryCode=af&amp;regionCode=sas&amp;#af CIA - The World Factbook - Field Listing :: Telephones - mobile cellular&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;, but only 129,300 [[landline|fixed-telephone-lines]]. Mobile communications have improved because of the introduction of wireless carriers into this [[developing country]]. The first was [[Afghan Wireless]], which is US based that was founded by [[Ehsan Bayat]]. The second was [[Roshan (telco)|Roshan]], which began providing services to all major cities within Afghanistan. There are also five or more [[VSAT]]'s installed in [[Kabul]], [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], [[Mazari Sharif]], and [[Jalalabad]], providing international and domestic voice/data connectivity. The international calling code for Afghanistan is [[Telephone numbers in Afghanistan|+93]]. The following is a partial list of mobile phone companies in the country:

==Internet==
{{Main|Internet in Afghanistan}}
[[File:Afghan man reading Wikipedia article in Kandahar.jpg|thumb|Internet user at [[Kandahar University]]]]
Afghanistan was given legal control of the &quot;[[.af]]&quot; domain in 2003, and the Afghanistan Network Information Center (AFGNIC) was established to administer [[domain name]]s. As of 2020, there are at least 46 [[internet service provider]]s (ISPs) in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2184.html?countryName=Afghanistan&amp;countryCode=af&amp;regionCode=sas&amp;#af CIA - The World Factbook - Field Listing :: Internet hosts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet in Afghanistan]] is also at the peak with 1 million users in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2153.html?countryName=Afghanistan&amp;countryCode=af&amp;regionCode=sas&amp;#af CIA - The World Factbook - Field Listing :: Internet users&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a partial list of the internet service providers operating in Afghanistan:

==Television==
{{Main|List of television channels in Afghanistan}}
There are at least 8 [[television network]]s based inside Afghanistan, and about a dozen international broadcasters are available.

==Radio==
As of 2007, there are an estimated 50 private radio stations throughout the country. At least 5 are [[FM]], 21 [[amplitude modulation|AM]], and 1 [[shortwave]] (broadcasting in [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Dari (Afghanistan)|Dari]], and [[English language|English]] languages). The following is an incomplete list of radio channels broadcasing from within Afghanistan:

==Postal service==
{{See also|Postage stamps and postal history of Afghanistan}}

In 1870, a central [[post office]] was established at [[Bala Hissar]] in Kabul and a post office in the capital of each province. The service was slowly being expanded over the years as more postal offices were established in each large city by 1918. Afghanistan became member of the [[Universal Postal Union]] in 1928, and the postal administration elevated to the [[Afghan Ministry of Communications|Ministry of Communication]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://afghanpost.gov.af/about.htm|title=afghanpost.gov.af - About}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil war caused a disruption in issuing official stamps during the 1980s-90s war&lt;ref name=fabio&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://digilander.libero.it/fabioalarici/a.html|title=Postal Authorities A}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1999 postal service was operating again. Postal services to/from Kabul worked remarkably well all throughout the war years. Postal services to/from Herat resumed in 1997. &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.afghan-network.net/Culture/stamps.html|title=Afghanistan @ Stamps}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Afghan government has reported to the UPU several times about illegal stamps being issued and sold in 2003 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.upu.int/philately/en/2003/002_upu_circular_en.pdf|title=2003 UPU Circular}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.upu.int/philately/en/2007/177_upu_circular_en.pdf|title=2007 UPU Circular}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afghanistan Post has been reorganizing the postal service in 2000s with the help of [[Pakistan Post]].&lt;ref name=fabio/&gt; The Afghanistan Postal commission was formed to prepare a written policy for the development of the postal sector, which will form the basis of a new postal services law governing licensing of postal services providers. The project was expected to finish by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.mcit.gov.af/Documents/RunningProjects/AfghanPost.pdf|title=Afghanistan Postal commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Christian of Oliva''', '''Christian of Prussia''', ({{lang-pl|Christian z Oliwy}}) (died 1245) was the first [[Bishop]] of [[Prussia (Baltic)|Prussia]]. 

He was a [[Cistercian]]. Most but not all authors identify him with [[Godfrey of Łękno]]. Before his appointment as bishop, he had been the [[abbot]] of the [[Abbey|monastery]] of [[Łekno]] near [[Gniezno]].

In 1209, Christian was commissioned by [[Pope Innocent III]] to be responsible for the Prussian missions between the Rivers [[Vistula]] and [[Neman River|Neman]]. He was appointed bishop in 1212. [[1215|Three years later]], he went to Rome in order to report to the Pope on the condition and prospects of his mission, and was consecrated first Bishop of Prussia. His seat as a Bishop was Oliva ([[Oliwa]]) Abbey, founded in 1178 by the dukes of eastern [[Pomerania]] near [[Gdańsk]] at the [[Baltic Sea]]. So his seat was on the western side of the Vistula, whereas the pagan [[Prussia (region)|Prussian]] territory was on the eastern side of it.

Together with [[Conrad of Mazovia]], Christian later created the [[Order of Dobrzyń]].

From 1233 to 1239, Christian was held captive by pagan Prussians, and freed in trade for five other hostages who then in turn were released for a ransom of 800 [[mark (money)|Marks]], granted to him by [[Pope Gregory IX]]. 

In 1243, the Papal legate [[William of Modena]] divided [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] into four bishoprics 
*[[Bishopric of Culm (Chełmno)]] (Kulmerland, [[Chełmno Land]], Ziemia Chełminska)
*[[Bishopric of Pomesania]] ([[Pomesania]])
*[[Archbishopric of Warmia|Bishopric of Warmia]] (Ermland)
*[[Bishopric of Samland]] ([[Sambia]])
under the [[archbishopric of Riga]]. Christian was supposed to choose one of them, but did not agree to the division, and died before the conflict was solved.

'''Coca-Cola''' is a [[carbonation|carbonated]] [[soft drink]] sold in the stores, restaurants, and [[vending machine]]s of more than 200 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Coca-Cola official website | url=http://www.virtualvender.coca-cola.com/ft/index.jsp | title=Brand Fact Sheet | date=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced by [[The Coca-Cola Company]] of [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and is often referred to simply as '''Coke''' (a registered trademark of The Coca-Cola Company in the United States since March 27, 1944). Originally intended as a [[patent medicine]] when it was invented in the late 19th century by [[John Pemberton]], Coca-Cola was bought out by businessman [[Asa Griggs Candler]], whose marketing tactics led Coke to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century.

The company produces [[concentrate]], which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world. The bottlers, who hold territorially exclusive contracts with the company, produce finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate in combination with filtered water and sweeteners. The bottlers then sell, distribute and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores and vending machines. Such bottlers include [[Coca-Cola Enterprises]], which is the largest single Coca-Cola bottler in North America and western Europe. The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for [[soda fountain]]s to major restaurants and [[food service]] distributors.

The Coca-Cola Company has, on occasion, introduced other cola drinks under the Coke brand name. The most common of these is [[Diet Coke]], with others including [[Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola]], Diet Coke Caffeine-Free, [[Coca-Cola Cherry]], [[Coca-Cola Zero]], [[Coca-Cola Vanilla]], and special editions with lemon, lime or coffee.

In response to consumer insistence on a more natural product, the company is in the process of phasing out E211, or [[sodium benzoate]], the controversial additive used in Diet Coke and linked to [[DNA]] damage in yeast cells and hyperactivity in children. The company has stated that it plans to remove E211 from its other products, including [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]] and [[Oasis (drink)|Oasis]], as soon as a satisfactory alternative is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=The Daily Mail | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1021820/Diet-Coke-drop-additive-DNA-damage-fear.html | title=DNA Damage Fear | date=2008-05-24 | location=London | first=Colin | last=Fernandez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[prototype]] Coca-Cola recipe was formulated at the Eagle Drug and Chemical Company, a drugstore in [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] by [[John Pemberton]], originally as a [[coca wine]] called [[Pemberton's French Wine Coca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/ga/muscogee/photos/pemberto13411gph.txt |title=Coca Cola Inventor was Local Pharmacist, Columbus Ledger |date= |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gadailynews.com/news/columbus/64433-columbus-helped-make-coke-x2019-s-success-x2018-the-real-thing-x2019.html |title=Columbus helped make Coke’s success}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/ourbrands/default.aspx?id=9 |title=Coca-Cola&amp;nbsp; — Our Brands |accessdate=2007-02-11 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been inspired by the formidable success of [[Vin Mariani]], a European coca wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Mark Pendergrast | title=For God, Country and Coca-Cola | publisher=Basic Books | year=2000 | page=25 | isbn=0-465-05468-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, when Atlanta and [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] passed [[prohibition]] legislation, Pemberton responded by developing Coca-Cola, essentially a non-alcoholic version of French Wine Coca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jack |last=Hayes |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Coca-Cola Television Advertisements: Dr. John S. Pemberton |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/ccmphtml/colainvnt.html |work= |publisher=Nation's Restaurant News |date= |accessdate=2007-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first sales were at Jacob's Pharmacy in Atlanta, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], on May 8, 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/heritage/chronicle_birth_refreshing_idea.html |title= The Chronicle Of Coca-Cola |accessdate=2007-11-28 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially sold as a patent medicine for five [[Cent (currency)|cents]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2165787/ |title=The Mystery of the 5-Cent Coca-Cola: Why it's so hard for companies to raise prices |first=Tim |last=Harford |publisher=Slate |date=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; a glass at [[soda fountain]]s, which were popular in the United States at the time due to the belief that [[carbonated water]] was good for the health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/ccmphtml/colatime1.html |title=Themes for Coca-Cola Advertising (1886–1999) |accessdate=2007-02-11 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pemberton claimed Coca-Cola cured many diseases, including [[morphine]] addiction, [[dyspepsia]], [[neurasthenia]], [[headache]], and [[impotence]]. Pemberton ran the first advertisement for the beverage on May 29 of the same year in the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Mark Pendergrast | title=For God, Country and Coca-Cola | publisher=Basic Books | year=2000 | page=32 | isbn=0-465-05468-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1888, three versions of Coca-Cola — sold by three separate businesses — were on the market. [[Asa Griggs Candler]] acquired a stake in Pemberton's company in 1887 and incorporated it as the [[Coca Cola Corporation|Coca Cola Company]] in 1888.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendergrast2000&quot;&gt;Mark Pendergrast (2000). ''For God, Country and Coca-Cola''. [[Basic Books]]. ISBN 0-465-05468-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, while suffering from an ongoing addiction to [[morphine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/nutrition/Biographies/Pemberton-John-S.html |title=Pemberton Bio|accessdate=2009-12-07|work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pemberton sold the rights a second time to four more businessmen: [[J.C. Mayfield]], A.O. Murphey, C.O. Mullahy and E.H. Bloodworth. Meanwhile, Pemberton's alcoholic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Mark Pendergrast | title=For God, Country and Coca-Cola | publisher=Basic Books | year=2000 | page=48 | isbn=0-465-05468-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; son [[Charley Pemberton]] began selling his own version of the product.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendergrast&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Mark Pendergrast | title=For God, Country and Coca-Cola | publisher=Basic Books | year=2000 | pages=41&amp;nbsp;–45 | isbn=0-465-05468-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Pemberton declared that the ''name'' &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; belonged to Charley, but the other two manufacturers could continue to use the ''formula''. So, in the summer of 1888, Candler sold his beverage under the names Yum Yum and Koke. After both failed to catch on, Candler set out to establish a legal claim to Coca-Cola in late 1888, in order to force his two competitors out of the business. Candler purchased [[exclusive right]]s to the formula from John Pemberton, Margaret Dozier and Woolfolk Walker. However, in 1914, Dozier came forward to claim her signature on the bill of sale had been forged, and subsequent analysis has indicated John Pemberton's signature was most likely a forgery as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendergrast1&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Mark Pendergrast | title=For God, Country and Coca-Cola | publisher=Basic Books | year=2000 | pages=45&amp;nbsp;–47 | isbn=0-465-05468-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892 Candler incorporated a second company, [[The Coca-Cola Company|''The'' Coca-Cola Company]] (the current corporation), and in 1910 Candler had the earliest records of the company burned, further obscuring its legal origins. By the time of its 50th anniversary, the drink had reached the status of a national icon in the USA. In 1935, it was certified [[kosher]] by Rabbi [[Tobias Geffen]], after the company made minor changes in the sourcing of some ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ajhs.org/scholarship/chapters/chapter.cfm?documentID=270 | title=Beyond Seltzer Water: The Kashering of Coca-Cola | publisher = American Jewish Historical Society |accessdate=2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coca-Cola was sold in [[bottle]]s for the first time on March 12, 1894. The first outdoor wall advertisement was painted in the same year as well in [[Cartersville, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM2DK6 First painted wall sign to advertise Coca-Cola : Cartersville, GA] – Waymarking&lt;/ref&gt; [[aluminum can|Cans]] of Coke first appeared in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.comcast.net/~collectiblesodacans/Cokepg1.htm |title=Coke Can History |accessdate=2007-01-21 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first bottling of Coca-Cola occurred in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], [[Mississippi]], at the Biedenharn Candy Company in 1891. Its proprietor was Joseph A. Biedenharn. The original bottles were Biedenharn bottles, very different from the much later hobble-skirt design that is now so familiar. Asa Candler was tentative about bottling the drink, but two entrepreneurs from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], Benjamin F. Thomas and Joseph B. Whitehead, proposed the idea and were so persuasive that Candler signed a contract giving them control of the procedure for only one dollar. Candler never collected his dollar, but in 1899 Chattanooga became the site of the first Coca-Cola bottling company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chattanoogacocacola.com/history.asp |title= Chattanooga Coca-Cola History |accessdate=2008-08-24 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The loosely termed contract proved to be problematic for the company for decades to come. Legal matters were not helped by the decision of the bottlers to subcontract to other companies, effectively becoming parent bottlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/ourcompany/historybottling.html |title= History Of Bottling |accessdate=2007-02-23 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coke concentrate, or Coke syrup, was and is sold separately at pharmacies in small quantities, as an over-the-counter remedy for nausea or mildly upset stomach.

===New Coke===

On April 23, 1985, Coca-Cola, amid much publicity, attempted to change the [[Coca-Cola formula|formula]] of the drink with &quot;New Coke&quot;. Follow-up taste tests revealed that most consumers preferred the taste of New Coke to both Coke and Pepsi, but Coca-Cola management was unprepared for the public's [[nostalgia]] for the old drink, leading to a [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]]. The company gave in to protests and returned to a variation of the [[Coca-Cola formula|old formula]], under the name Coca-Cola Classic on July 10, 1985.

===21st century===
On February 7, 2005, the Coca-Cola Company announced that in the second quarter of 2005 they planned to launch a [[Diet Coke]] product sweetened with the [[Sugar substitute|artificial sweetener]] [[sucralose]], the same sweetener currently used in [[Pepsi One]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.coca-cola.com/presscenter/newproducts_dietcoke_splenda.html |title=Diet Coke Sweetened with Splenda |accessdate=2007-01-06 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pepsi.com/help/faqs/faq.php?category=pepsi_brands&amp;page=pepsi_one |title=Pepsi Brands&amp;nbsp; — Pepsi One |accessdate=2007-01-06 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 21, 2005, it announced another diet product, [[Coca-Cola Zero]], sweetened partly with a blend of [[aspartame]] and [[acesulfame potassium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7257920/ |title=Coke to launch new no-calorie soda |accessdate=2007-11-28 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Coca-Cola began to sell a new &quot;healthy soda&quot;: Diet Coke with vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, magnesium, niacin, and zinc, marketed as &quot;Diet Coke Plus.&quot;

On July 5, 2005, it was revealed that Coca-Cola would resume operations in [[Iraq]] for the first time since the [[Arab League]] boycotted the company in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rory Carroll in Baghdad |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/jul/05/iraq.rorycarroll |title=Cola wars as Coke moves on Baghdad – The |publisher=Guardian |date= 2005-07-05|accessdate=2011-03-13 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, in Canada, the name &quot;Coca-Cola Classic&quot; was changed back to &quot;Coca-Cola.&quot; The word &quot;Classic&quot; was truncated because &quot;New Coke&quot; was no longer in production, eliminating the need to differentiate between the two.&lt;ref&gt;According to a Coca-Cola customer-service representative.&lt;/ref&gt; The formula remained unchanged.

In January 2009, Coca-Cola stopped printing the word &quot;Classic&quot; on the labels of {{convert|16|USfloz|ml|adj=on}} bottles sold in parts of the [[southeastern United States]].&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news |title=Coke to Omit 'Classic' |first=Betsy |last=McKay |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=January 30, 2009 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123332768434033495.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The change is part of a larger strategy to rejuvenate the product's image.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

In November 2009, due to a dispute over wholesale prices of Coca-Cola products, [[Costco]] stopped restocking its shelves with Coke and Diet Coke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Fredrix, Emily and Sarah Skidmore |title=Costco nixes Coke products over pricing dispute |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hC_n50ZLyl8FLDBIkGfCn7-110BwD9C1F1C80 |agency=Associated Press |date=November 17, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of stimulants in formula==
When launched Coca-Cola's two key ingredients were [[cocaine]] (benzoylmethyl ecgonine) and [[caffeine]]. The cocaine was derived from the [[coca]] leaf and the caffeine from [[kola nut]], leading to the name Coca-Cola (the &quot;K&quot; in Kola was replaced with a &quot;C&quot; for marketing purposes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pponline.co.uk/encyc/0204.htm |title=Coca-cola |publisher=Pponline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/a/coca_cola.htm |title=The History of Coca Cola |accessdate=2007-01-23 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coca — cocaine===
Pemberton called for five [[ounce]]s of coca leaf per gallon of syrup, a significant dose; in 1891, Candler claimed his formula (altered extensively from Pemberton's original) contained only a tenth of this amount. Coca-Cola did once contain an estimated nine [[milligram]]s of cocaine per glass, but in 1903 it was removed.&lt;ref&gt;Liebowitz, Michael, R. (1983). ''The Chemistry of Love''. Boston: Little, Brown, &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Coca-Cola still contains coca flavoring.

After 1904, instead of using fresh leaves, Coca-Cola started using &quot;spent&quot; leaves — the leftovers of the cocaine-extraction process with cocaine trace levels left over at a molecular level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_033.html|title=Is it true Coca Cola once contained cocaine? |work= |accessdate=2007-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, Coca-Cola uses as an ingredient a cocaine-free [[coca]] leaf extract prepared at a [[Stepan Company]] plant in [[Maywood, New Jersey]].

In the United States, [[Stepan Company]] is the only manufacturing plant authorized by the Federal Government to import and process the [[coca]] plant,&lt;ref&gt;May, Clifford D. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D7123BF932A35754C0A96E948260 &quot;How Coca-Cola Obtains Its Coca&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 1, 1998. Accessed December 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; which it obtains mainly from [[Peru]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Bolivia]]. Besides producing the coca flavoring agent for Coca-Cola, [[Stepan Company]] extracts cocaine from the coca leaves, which it sells to [[Mallinckrodt]], a [[St. Louis, Missouri]] [[pharmaceutical]] manufacturer that is the only company in the United States licensed to purify cocaine for medicinal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Drew |last=Benson |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Coca kick in drinks spurs export fears|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Food/2004/Kdrink-Coca-Drink19apr04.htm |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kola nuts — caffeine===
[[Kola nut]]s act as a flavoring and the source of [[caffeine]] in Coca-Cola. In Britain, for example, the ingredient label states &quot;Flavourings (Including Caffeine).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/yourhealth/what_our_labels_tell_you/ |title=Coca-Cola Your Health – You and Your Family's GDA Questions Answered |publisher=Coca-cola.co.uk |date=2010-04-13 |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kola nuts contain about 2 percent to 3.5 percent caffeine, are of bitter flavor and are commonly used in [[cola]] [[soft drinks]]. In 1911, the U.S. government initiated [[United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola]], hoping to force Coca-Cola to remove caffeine from its formula. The case was decided in favor of Coca-Cola. Subsequently, in 1912 the U.S. Pure Food and Drug Act was amended, adding [[caffeine]] to the list of &quot;habit-forming&quot; and &quot;deleterious&quot; substances which must be listed on a product's label.

Coca-Cola contains 46&amp;nbsp;mg of [[caffeine]] per 12 fluid ounces, while [[Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola]] and [[Diet Coke Caffeine-Free]] contain 0&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/?id=WxmBmvhsoZ8C&amp;pg=PA363&amp;lpg=PA363&amp;dq=caffeine+coca+cola | title=Caffeine Content of Some Cola Beverages | work=Google Books | isbn=9780849326479 | author1=Spiller, Gene A | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A can of Coke (12 fl ounces/355&amp;nbsp;ml) has 39&amp;nbsp;grams of carbohydrates (all from sugar, approximately 10 teaspoons),&lt;ref&gt;1 teaspoon of sugar is ~4 g&lt;/ref&gt; 50&amp;nbsp;mg of sodium, 0&amp;nbsp;grams fat, 0&amp;nbsp;grams potassium, and 140 calories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyplate.com/nutrition-calories/food/coca-cola/coca-cola-classic-12oz-can |title=The Daily Plate |publisher=The Daily Plate |date= |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formula of natural flavorings===
{{Main|Coca-Cola formula}}

The exact formula of Coca-Cola's natural flavorings (but not its other ingredients which are listed on the side of the bottle or can) is a [[trade secret]]. The original copy of the formula is held in [[SunTrust Bank]]'s main vault in Atlanta. Its predecessor, the [[Trust Company]], was the [[underwriter]] for the Coca-Cola Company's [[initial public offering]] in 1919. A popular myth states that only two executives have access to the formula, with each executive having only half the formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/ |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Cokelore |accessdate=2007-02-10 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The truth is that while Coca-Cola does have a rule restricting access to only two executives, each knows the entire formula and others, in addition to the prescribed duo, have known the formulation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/formula.asp|title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Cokelore (Have a Cloak and a Smile) |accessdate=2007-02-22 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 11, 2011 [[Ira Glass]] revealed on his [[Public Radio International|PRI]] radio show, ''[[This American Life]]'', that the secret formula to Coca-Cola had been uncovered in a 1979 newspaper. The formula found basically matched the formula found in Pemberton's diary.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Rogers, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/blog-post/2011/02/this_american_life_bursts_coca.html &quot;'This American Life' bursts Coca-Cola's bubble: What's in that original recipe, anyway?,&quot;] ''[[Washington Post]]'' BlogPost, February 15, 2011, retrieved February 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brett Michael Dykes, [http://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_thelookout/20110215/ts_yblog_thelookout/did-nprs-this-american-life-discover-cokes-secret-formula &quot;Did NPR’s ‘This American Life’ discover Coke’s secret formula?,&quot;] The Lookout, [[Yahoo!]] News, February 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David W.

===Franchised production model===
The actual production and distribution of Coca-Cola follows a franchising model. The Coca-Cola Company only produces a syrup concentrate, which it sells to bottlers throughout the world, who hold Coca-Cola franchises for one or more geographical areas. The bottlers produce the final drink by mixing the syrup with filtered water and sweeteners, and then carbonate it before putting it in cans and bottles, which the bottlers then sell and distribute to retail stores, vending machines, restaurants and food service distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/ourcompany/aboutbottling.html |title=Coca-Cola&amp;nbsp; — Our Company&amp;nbsp; — About Bottling |accessdate=2007-02-22 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070216144908/http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/ourcompany/aboutbottling.html |archivedate = February 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coca-Cola Company owns minority shares in some of its largest franchises, like [[Coca-Cola Enterprises]], [[Coca-Cola Amatil]], [[Coca-Cola Hellenic|Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company]] (CCHBC) and [[Coca-Cola FEMSA]], but fully independent bottlers produce almost half of the volume sold in the world.
Independent bottlers are allowed to sweeten the drink according to local tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cokecce.com/pages/allContent.asp?page_id=84#q1 |title=What Is the Difference Between Coca-Cola Enterprises and the Coca-Cola Company |accessdate=2007-02-22 |work= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The bottling plant in [[Skopje]], [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]], received the 2009 award for &quot;Best Bottling Company&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/7151/1/ |title=Coca Cola: Macedonia makes the best Coke |publisher=Macedoniaonline.eu |date=2009-06-16 |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logo design===
[[File:Elmira Coca-Cola Detail.jpg|150px|thumb|Detail on Elmira Coca-Cola Bottling Plant, [[Elmira, NY]].]]

The famous Coca-Cola [[logo]] was created by John Pemberton's bookkeeper, [[Frank Mason Robinson]], in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/advertisingmedia/ss/Coca_Cola_Comp_2.htm |title=Coca Cola Company&amp;nbsp; — Red Spencerian Script |accessdate=2007-01-11 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson came up with the name and chose the logo's distinctive cursive script. The [[typeface]] used, known as [[Spencerian Script|Spencerian script]], was developed in the mid 19th century and was the dominant form of formal handwriting in the United States during that period.

Robinson also played a significant role in early Coca-Cola [[advertising]]. His promotional suggestions to Pemberton included giving away thousands of free drink coupons and plastering the city of [[Atlanta]] with publicity banners and [[streetcar]] signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Frank Robinson, creator of the Coca-Cola logo| url=http://coca-cola-art.com/2008/06/05/frank-robinson/| accessdate = 2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Contour bottle design''===

[[File:Coca Cola liter bottle label.svg|thumb|Designer label for 2 litre Coca-Cola bottle]]

The equally famous Coca-Cola bottle, called the &quot;contour bottle&quot; within the company, but known to some as the &quot;[[hobble skirt]]&quot; bottle, was created by bottle designer [[Earl R. Dean]]. In 1915, the [[Coca-Cola Company]] launched a competition among its bottle suppliers to create a new bottle for the beverage that would distinguish it from other beverage bottles, &quot;a bottle which a person could recognize even if they felt it in the dark, and so shaped that, even if broken, a person could tell at a glance what it was.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vigo.lib.in.us&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Inventory: Earl R. Dean Collection |url=http://www.vigo.lib.in.us/vcplarchive/inventories/business/dean.asp|work= |publisher=[[Vigo County Public Library]]|date= |accessdate=2008-12-14}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman J. Root, president of [[the Root Glass Company]] of [[Terre Haute]], [[Indiana]], turned the project over to members of his supervisory staff, including company auditor T. Clyde Edwards, plant superintendent Alexander Samuelsson, and [[Earl R. Dean]], bottle designer and supervisor of the bottle molding room. Root and his subordinates decided to base the bottle's design on one of the soda's two ingredients, the [[coca leaf]] or the [[kola nut]], but were unaware of what either ingredient looked like. Dean and Edwards went to the [[Emeline Fairbanks Memorial Library]] and were unable to find any information about coca or kola. Instead, Dean was inspired by a picture of the gourd-shaped [[cocoa pod]] in the [[Encyclopedia Britannica]]. Dean made a rough sketch of the pod and returned back to the plant to show Mr. Root. He explained to Root how he could transform the shape of the pod into a bottle. Chapman Root gave Dean his approval.&lt;ref name=&quot;vigo.lib.in.us&quot;/&gt;

Faced with the upcoming scheduled maintenance of the mold-making machinery, over the next 24 hours Dean sketched out a concept drawing which was approved by Root the next morning. Dean then proceeded to create a bottle mold and produced a small number of bottles before the glass-molding machinery was turned off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bottle |last=Lundy |first=Betty |year=1986 |publisher=American Heritage Inc. |issn=0002-8738 |pages=98–101 |url=http://contourbottle.angelfire.com/The_Bottle.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman Root approved the prototype bottle and a [[design patent]] was issued on the bottle in November, 1915. The prototype never made it to production since its middle diameter was larger than its base, making it unstable on [[conveyor belt]]s. Dean resolved this issue by decreasing the bottle's middle diameter. During the 1916 bottler's convention, Dean's contour bottle was chosen over other entries and was on the market the same year. By 1920, the contour bottle became the standard for the [[Coca-Cola Company]]. Today, the contour Coca-Cola bottle is one of the most recognized packages on the planet...&quot;even in the dark!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=1916 ... Birth of the Contour Bottle|url=http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/ourcompany/historybottling.html |work= |publisher=The Coca-Cola Company |date= |accessdate=2007-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reward for his efforts, Dean was offered a choice between a $500 bonus or a lifetime job at [[the Root Glass Company]]. He chose the lifetime job and kept it until the [[Owens-Illinois Glass Company]] bought out [[the Root Glass Company]] in the mid-1930s. Dean went on to work in other Midwestern glass factories.

Although endorsed by some{{Who|date=June 2009}}, this version of events is not considered authoritative by many{{Who|date=June 2009}} who consider it implausible. One alternative depiction has [[Raymond Loewy]] as the inventor of the unique design, but, while Loewy did serve as a designer of Coke cans and bottles in later years, he was in the [[French Army]] the year the bottle was invented and did not emigrate to the United States until 1919. Others have attributed inspiration for the design not to the cocoa pod, but to a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] [[Hoop skirt|hooped dress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/bottle.asp |title=Snopes urban legend of the Coca-Cola bottle shape |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, Associate Justice [[Roger J. Traynor]] of the [[Supreme Court of California]] took advantage of a case involving a waitress injured by an exploding Coca-Cola bottle to articulate the doctrine of [[strict liability]] for [[product liability|defective products]]. Traynor's [[concurring opinion]] in ''[[Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co.]]'' is widely recognized as a landmark case in U.S. law today.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Lawrence M. Friedman, ''American Law in the 20th Century'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004), 356–357, and Jay M. Feinman, ''Law 101: Everything You Need to Know About the American Legal System'', rev. ed. (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), 165–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Coca-Cola also introduced a &quot;contour can,&quot; similar in shape to its famous bottle, on a few test markets, including [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]], [[Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beverage-digest.com/editorial/970221.html |title=Coke Debuts Contour Can }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new can has never been widely released.

A new slim and tall can began to appear in Australia as of December 20, 2006; it cost AU$1.95. The cans have a distinct resemblance to [[energy drink]] cans. The cans were commissioned by Domino's Pizza and are available exclusively at their restaurants.

In January 2007, Coca-Cola Canada changed &quot;Coca-Cola Classic&quot; labeling, removing the &quot;Classic&quot; designation, leaving only &quot;Coca-Cola.&quot; Coca-Cola stated this is merely a name change and the product remains the same. The cans still bear the &quot;Classic&quot; logo in the United States.

In 2007, Coca-Cola introduced an aluminum can designed to look like the original glass Coca-Cola bottles.

In 2007, the company's logo on cans and bottles changed. The cans and bottles retained the red color and familiar typeface, but the design was simplified, leaving only the logo and a plain white swirl (the &quot;dynamic ribbon&quot;).

In 2008, in some parts of the world, the plastic bottles for all Coke varieties (including the larger 1.5- and 2-liter bottles) was changed to include a new plastic [[screw cap]] and a slightly taller contoured bottle shape, designed to evoke the old glass bottles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/presscenter/nr_20080613_2l_contour.html Press release] 2 liter contour bottle&lt;/ref&gt;

===Designer bottles===
[[Karl Lagerfeld]] is the latest designer to have created a collection of aluminum bottles for Coca-Cola. Lagerfeld is not the first fashion designer to create a special version of the famous Coca-Cola Contour bottle. A number of other limited edition bottles by fashion designers for Coca Cola Light soda have been created in the last few years.

In 2009, in Italy, Coca-Cola Light had a Tribute to Fashion to celebrate 100 years of the recognizable contour bottle. Well known Italian designers Alberta Ferretti, Blumarine, Etro, Fendi, Marni, Missoni, Moschino, and Versace each designed limited edition bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifitshipitshere.blogspot.com/2010/04/coca-cola-light-get-dressed-by-another.html|title=Coca-Cola Light Gets Dressed By Another Designer, Karl Lagerfeld|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local competitors==
[[Pepsi]] is usually second to Coke in sales, but outsells Coca-Cola in some markets. Around the world, some local brands compete with Coke. In [[South America|South]] and Central America [[Kola Real]], known as [[Big Cola]] in Mexico, is a fast-growing competitor to Coca-Cola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ricardo|last= Mireles |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= In Mexico, Big Cola is the real thing |url= http://www.logisticstoday.com/sNO/6366/iID/20876/LT/displayStory.asp|work= |publisher=Logistics Today |date= |accessdate=2007-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the French island of [[Corsica]], [[Corsica Cola]], made by brewers of the local Pietra beer, is a growing competitor to Coca-Cola. In the French region of [[Brittany]], [[Breizh Cola]] is available. In Peru, [[Inca Kola]] outsells Coca-Cola, which led [[The Coca-Cola Company]] to purchase the brand in 1999. In Sweden, [[Julmust]] outsells Coca-Cola during the [[Christmas]] season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kristallbeverage.com/KBJulmust.html &quot;About Kristall Beverage&quot;].

==Advertising==
Coca-Cola's advertising has significantly affected [[Culture of the United States|American culture]], and it is frequently credited with inventing the modern image of [[Santa Claus]] as an old man in a red-and-white suit. Although the company did start using the red-and-white Santa image in the 1930s, with its winter advertising campaigns illustrated by [[Haddon Sundblom]], the motif was already common.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Mikkelson and David P. Mikkelson, &quot;[http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/santa.asp The Claus That Refreshes],&quot; snopes.com, February 27, 2001 (accessed June 10, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usir.salford.ac.uk&quot;&gt;See George McKay [http://usir.salford.ac.uk/2227/ 'Consumption, Coca-colonisation, cultural resistance—and Santa Claus'], in Sheila Whiteley, ed. (2008) ''Christmas, Ideology and Popular Culture''. Edinburgh University Press, pp. 50–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Coca-Cola was not even the first soft drink company to use the modern image of Santa Claus in its advertising: [[White Rock Beverages]] used Santa in advertisements for its [[ginger ale]] in 1923, after first using him to sell [[mineral water]] in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;The White Rock Collectors Association, &quot;[http://www.whiterocking.org/santa.html#article Did White Rock or The Coca-Cola Company create the modern Santa Claus Advertisement?],&quot; whiterocking.org, 2001 (accessed January 19, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White Rock Beverages, &quot;[http://www.bevnet.com/news/2006/12-18-2006-white_rock_coke_santa_claus.asp Coca-Cola's Santa Claus: Not The Real Thing!],&quot; BevNET.com, December 18, 2006 (accessed January 19, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Before Santa Claus, Coca-Cola relied on images of smartly dressed young women to sell its beverages. Coca-Cola's first such advertisement appeared in 1895, featuring the young Bostonian actress [[Hilda Clark]] as its spokeswoman.

[[Image:Cocacola-5cents-1900 edit1.jpg|thumb|An 1890s advertisement showing model [[Hilda Clark]] in formal [[Victorian fashion|19th century attire]]. The ad is titled ''Drink Coca-Cola 5¢''. ([[United States|US]])]]

1941 saw the first use of the nickname &quot;Coke&quot; as an official trademark for the product, with a series of advertisements informing consumers that &quot;Coke means Coca-Cola&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coca-colaconversations.com/my_weblog/2008/06/coke-means-coca.html |title=Coke means Coca-Cola |publisher=Coca-Cola Conversations |date=2008-06-16 |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 a song from a Coca-Cola commercial called &quot;[[I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing]]&quot;, produced by [[Roquel Billy Davis|Billy Davis]], became a [[hit single]].

Coke's advertising is pervasive, as one of [[Ernest Woodruff|Woodruff]]'s stated goals was to ensure that everyone on Earth drank Coca-Cola as their preferred beverage. This is especially true in southern areas of the United States, such as [[Atlanta]], where Coke was born.

[[File:Cokelahore.jpg|thumb|left|Coca-Cola signboard in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]].]]

Some of the memorable Coca-Cola [[Television advertisement|television commercials]] between 1960 through 1986 were written and produced by former Atlanta radio veteran [[Don Naylor]] ([[WGST]] 1936–1950, [[WAGA (TV)|WAGA]] 1951–1959) during his career as a producer for the [[McCann Erickson]] [[advertising agency]]. Many of these early television commercials for Coca-Cola featured [[movie star]]s, sports heroes and popular singers.

[[Image:Ft Dodge ghost sign.jpg|thumb|left|Coca-Cola [[ghost sign]] in [[Fort Dodge, Iowa]]. Note older Coca-Cola ghosts behind Borax and telephone ads.]]

During the 1980s, [[Pepsi-Cola]] ran a series of television advertisements showing people participating in taste tests demonstrating that, according to the commercials, &quot;fifty percent of the participants who said they preferred Coke ''actually'' chose the Pepsi.&quot; Statisticians were quick to point out the problematic nature of a 50/50 result: most likely, all the taste tests really showed was that in blind tests, most people simply ''cannot tell the difference'' between Pepsi and Coke. Coca-Cola ran ads to combat Pepsi's ads in an incident sometimes referred to as the ''[[cola wars]]''; one of Coke's ads compared the so-called [[Pepsi challenge]] to two [[chimpanzee]]s deciding which [[tennis ball]] was furrier. Thereafter, Coca-Cola regained its leadership in the market.

[[Selena]] was a spokesperson for Coca-Cola from 1989 till the time of her death. She filmed three commercials for the company. In 1994, to commemorate her five years with the company, Coca-Cola issued special Selena coke bottles.&lt;ref&gt;Orozco, Cynthia E. [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/QQ/fquxg.html Quintanilla Perez, Selena.] The Handbook of Texas online. Retrieved on June 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coca-Cola Company purchased [[Columbia Pictures]] in 1982, and began inserting Coke-product images in many of its films. After a few early successes during Coca-Cola's ownership, Columbia began to under-perform, and the studio was sold to [[Sony]] in 1989.

Coca-Cola has gone through a number of different [[advertising slogan]]s in its long history, including &quot;The pause that refreshes,&quot; &quot;I'd like to buy the world a Coke,&quot; and &quot;Coke is it&quot; (see [[Coca-Cola slogans]]).

In 2006, Coca-Cola introduced [[My Coke Rewards]], a customer loyalty campaign where consumers earn points by entering codes from specially marked packages of Coca-Cola products into a website. These points can be redeemed for various prizes or sweepstakes entries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mycokerewards.com My Coke Rewards] (Official Site)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holiday campaigns===
[[File:Weihnachtstruck.jpg|thumb|150px|left|upright|Coca-Cola [[Christmas]] truck in [[Dresden, Germany]].]]

The &quot;Holidays are coming!&quot; advertisement features a train of red delivery trucks, emblazoned with the Coca-Cola name and decorated with [[Christmas lights]], driving through a snowy landscape and causing everything that they pass to light up and people to watch as they pass through.&lt;ref name=Sandison&gt;{{cite news|title=Coca-Cola revives popular 'holidays are coming' ad|author=Nikki Sandison|work=[[Brand Republic]]|date=2007-11-16|url=http://brandrepublic.com/News/767575/Coca-Cola-revives-popular-holidays-coming-ad/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertisement fell into disuse in 2001, as the Coca-Cola company restructured its advertising campaigns so that advertising around the world was produced locally in each country, rather than centrally in the company's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Stephen Armstrong|date=2001-05-14|url=http://guardian.co.uk./media/2001/may/14/mondaymediasection6|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|title=Coke goes for broke}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2007, the company brought back the campaign after, according to the company, many consumers telephoned its information center saying that they considered it to mark the beginning of Christmas.&lt;ref name=Sandison /&gt; The advertisement was created by U.S. advertising agency Doner, and has been part of the company's global advertising campaign for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Coca-Cola Challenge|work=Campaign|date=2004-10-22|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7140327_ITM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keith Law, a producer and writer of commercials for [[Belfast CityBeat]], was not convinced by Coca-Cola's reintroduction of the advertisement in 2007, saying that &quot;I don't think there's anything Christmassy about [[Heavy Goods Vehicle|HGVs]] and the commercial is too generic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Do TV campaigns ad up?|author=Jane Hardy|date=2007-12-27|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk./lifestyle/do-tv-campaigns-ad-up-13505247.html|work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, singer [[Melanie Thornton]] recorded the campaign's advertising jingle as a single, ''Wonderful Dream (Holidays are Coming)'', which entered the pop-music charts in Germany at no. 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|language=German|date=2001-11-25|title=Melanie Thornton: &quot;Ich wollte immer Musik&quot;|url=http://spiegel.de./panorama/0,1518,169615,00.html|publisher=SPIEGELnet GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charleston native Thornton to be buried on Saturday.|work=[[The Post and Courier]]|location=Charleston, SC|date=2001-12-07|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-2079594_ITM|author=Prentiss Findlay}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Coca-Cola expanded the advertising campaign to radio, employing several variations of the jingle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coca-Cola restructures in healthy drinks focus|author=Nicola Clark|date=2005-11-29|work=[[Brand Republic]]|url=http://brandrepublic.com./News/530102/Coca-Cola-restructures-healthy-drinks-focus/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports sponsorship===
Coca-Cola was the first commercial [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] of the [[Olympic Games|Olympic games]], at the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 games]] in [[Amsterdam]], and has been an Olympics sponsor ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/facts/programme/profiles_uk.asp?sponsor=1 |title=International Olympic Committee&amp;nbsp; — Organisation&amp;nbsp; — Facts and Figures |accessdate=2007-01-13 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This corporate sponsorship included the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] hosted in [[Atlanta]], which allowed Coca-Cola to spotlight its hometown. Most recently, Coca-Cola has released localized commercials for the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver; one Canadian commercial referred to Canada's hockey heritage and was modified after Canada won the gold medal game on February 28, 2010 by changing the ending line of the commercial to say &quot;Now they know whose game they're playing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99msEwWpJBE |title=YouTube Post of Coca-Cola 2010 Olympic Hockey Commercial |accessdate=2010-03-02 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1978, Coca-Cola has sponsored each [[FIFA World Cup]], and other competitions organised by FIFA. In fact, one [[FIFA]] tournament trophy, the [[FIFA World Youth Championship]] from [[Tunisia]] in 1977 to [[Malaysia]] in 1997, was called &quot;FIFA&amp;nbsp; — Coca Cola Cup&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/partners/index/0,3517,13,00.html |title=Marketing &amp; TV &gt; FIFA Partners &gt; Coca Cola |accessdate=2007-01-13 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070112104745/http://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/partners/index/0,3517,13,00.html |archivedate = January 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Coca-Cola sponsors the annual [[Coca-Cola 600]] and [[Coke Zero 400]] for the [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]] at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in [[Concord, North Carolina]] and [[Daytona International Speedway]] in Daytona, Florida. Coca-Cola has a long history of sports marketing relationships, which over the years have included [[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Football League]], [[National Basketball Association]] and the [[National Hockey League]], as well as with many teams within those leagues. Coca-Cola is the official soft drink of many [[College football|collegiate football]] teams throughout the nation.

Coca-Cola was one of the official sponsors of the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]] held on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Coca Cola is also one of the associate sponsor of [[Delhi Daredevils]] in [[Indian Premier League]].

In England, Coca-Cola is the main sponsor of [[The Football League]], a name given to the three professional divisions below the [[Premier League]] in [[association football|football]] (soccer). It is also responsible for the renaming of these divisions&amp;nbsp; — until the advent of Coca-Cola sponsorship, they were referred to as Divisions One, Two and Three. Since 2004, the divisions have been known as The Championship (equiv. of Division 1), League One (equiv. of Div. 2) and League 2 (equiv. of Division 3). This renaming has caused unrest amongst some fans, who see it as farcical that the third tier of [[Football in England|English Football]] is now called &quot;League One.&quot; In 2005, Coca-Cola launched a competition for the 72 clubs of the football league&amp;nbsp; — it was called &quot;Win a Player&quot;. This allowed fans to place 1 vote per day for their beloved club, with 1 entry being chosen at random earning £250,000 for the club; this was repeated in 2006. The &quot;Win A Player&quot; competition was very controversial, as at the end of the 2 competitions, Leeds United AFC had the most votes by more than double, yet they did not win any money to spend on a new player for the club. In 2007, the competition changed to &quot;Buy a Player&quot;. This competition allowed fans to buy a bottle of Coca-Cola Zero or Coca-Cola and submit the code on the wrapper on the Coca-Cola website {www.coca-colafootball.co.uk}. This code could then earn anything from 50p to £100,000 for a club of their choice. This competition was favored over the old &quot;Win A Player&quot; competition, as it allowed all clubs to win some money.

Introduced March 1, 2010, in [[Canada]], to celebrate the [[2010 Olympics]], Coca Cola will sell [[gold (color)|gold colored]] cans in packs of 12 355 [[millilitre|mL]] each, in select stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coca-Cola to Release Gold Can Commemorating the 2010 Olympics|url=http://bevwire.wordpress.com/2010/03/01/coca-cola-to-release-gold-can-commemorating-the-2010-olympics/|publisher=BevWire|accessdate=2010-03-22|date=2010-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In mass media===
Coca-Cola has been prominently featured in countless films and television programs. It was a major plot element in films such as ''[[One, Two, Three]]'', ''[[The Coca-Cola Kid]]'', and ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy]]''. It provides a setting for comical corporate shenanigans in the novel [[Syrup (novel)|''Syrup'']] by [[Maxx Barry]]. And in music, in the Beatles' song, &quot;[[Come Together]]&quot;, the lyrics said, &quot;He shoot Coca-Cola, he say...&quot;.

==Health effects==
Since studies indicate &quot;soda and sweetened drinks are the main source of calories in [the] American diet&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/05/050527111920.htm&lt;/ref&gt; most [[nutrition]]ists advise that Coca-Cola and other soft drinks can be harmful if consumed excessively, particularly to young children whose soft drink consumption competes with, rather than complements, a balanced diet. Studies have shown that regular soft drink users have a lower intake of [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[ascorbic acid]], [[riboflavin]], and [[vitamin A]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Michael F. (2005). &quot;[http://www.cspinet.org/new/pdf/liquid_candy_final_w_new_supplement.pdf Liquid Candy: How Soft Drinks are Harming Americans' Health]&quot;, pp. 5–6. Center for Science in the Public Interest.

A common criticism of Coke based on its allegedly toxic acidity levels has been found to be baseless by researchers; [[lawsuit]]s based on these notions have been dismissed by several American courts for this reason. Although numerous court cases have been filed against The Coca-Cola Company since the 1920s, alleging that the acidity of the drink is dangerous, no evidence corroborating this claim has been found. Under normal conditions, [[scientific evidence]] indicates Coca-Cola's acidity causes no immediate harm.&lt;ref&gt;Mikkelson, Barbara &amp; Mikkelson, David P.

Since 1980 in the U.S., Coke has been made with [[high-fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS) as an ingredient. Originally it was used in combination with more expensive cane-sugar, but by late 1984 the formulation was sweetened entirely with HFCS. Some nutritionists caution against consumption of HFCS because it may aggravate obesity and type-2 diabetes more than cane sugar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/news/ng.asp?id=51623-single-food-ingredient &quot;Single food ingredient the cause of obesity ?

In India, there is a major controversy whether there are [[pesticide]]s and other harmful chemicals in bottled products, including Coca-Cola. In 2003 the [[Centre for Science and Environment|Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)]], a [[non-governmental organization]] in New Delhi, said [[aerated water]]s produced by soft drinks manufacturers in India, including multinational giants [[PepsiCo]] and Coca-Cola, contained toxins including [[lindane]], [[DDT]], [[malathion]] and [[chlorpyrifos]]&amp;nbsp; — [[pesticides]] that can contribute to cancer and a breakdown of the [[immune system]]. CSE found that the Indian produced Pepsi's soft drink products had 36 times the level of pesticide residues permitted under [[European Union]] regulations; Coca-Cola's soft drink was found to have 30 times the permitted amount. CSE said it had tested the same products sold in the U.S. and found no such residues.&lt;ref&gt;PTF (2003). [http://www.rediff.com/money/2003/aug/05pepsicoke.htm &quot;Pepsi, Coke contain pesticides: CSE&quot;]. Retrieved June 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After the pesticide allegations were made in 2003, Coca-Cola sales in India declined by 15 percent. In 2004 an Indian parliamentary committee backed up CSE's findings and a government-appointed committee was tasked with developing the world's first pesticide standards for soft drinks. The Coca-Cola Company has responded that its plants filter water to remove potential contaminants and that its products are tested for pesticides and must meet minimum health standards before they are distributed.&lt;ref&gt;Coca-Cola website (2006).

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of Coca-Cola}}

Coca-Cola has been criticized for alleged adverse health effects, its aggressive marketing to children, exploitative labor practices, high levels of pesticides in its products, building plants in [[Nazi Germany]] which employed slave labor, environmental destruction, monopolistic business practices, and hiring paramilitary units to murder trade union leaders. In October 2009, in an effort to improve their image, Coca-Cola partnered with the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], providing a $500,000 grant to help promote healthy-lifestyle education; the partnership spawned sharp criticism of both Coca-Cola and the AAFP by physicians and nutritionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hcrenewal.blogspot.com/2009/11/paging-and-paying-dr-coca-cola.html |title=Health Care Renewal: Paging (and Paying) &quot;Dr Coca-Cola&quot; |publisher=Hcrenewal.blogspot.com |date=2009-11-09 |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coca-Cola drink has a high degree of identification with the United States, being considered by some an &quot;American Brand&quot; or as an item representing America. 

The identification with the spread of American culture has led to the pun &quot;[[Cocacolonization|Coca-Colanization]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;usir.salford.ac.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/Coca-Colanization.asp |title=Word Spy&amp;nbsp; — Coca-Colanization |accessdate=2007-01-03 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drink is also often a [[metonymy|metonym]] for the Coca-Cola Company.

There are some consumer boycotts of Coca-Cola in [[Arab world|Arab countries]] due to Coke's early investment in Israel during the [[Arab League boycott of Israel]] (its competitor Pepsi stayed out of Israel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inminds.co.uk/boycott-coca-cola.html |title= Boycott Israel Campaign page on Coca-Cola|accessdate=2007-08-03 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mecca Cola]] and Pepsi have been successful alternatives in the Middle East.

A Coca-Cola fountain dispenser (officially a Fluids Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus-2 or FGBA-2) was developed for use on the [[Space Shuttle]] as a test bed to determine if carbonated beverages can be produced from separately stored carbon dioxide, water and flavored syrups and determine if the resulting fluids can be made available for consumption without bubble nucleation and resulting foam formation. 

The unit flew in 1996 aboard [[STS-77]] and held 1.65 liters each of Coca-Cola and Diet Coke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/shuttle_pk/pk/Flight_077_STS-077_Press_Kit.pdf National Aeronautics and Space Administration] accessdate 2009-06-13&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Distinguish|cofiniteness}}
In [[mathematics]], especially in [[order theory]], the '''cofinality''' cf(''A'') of a [[partially ordered set]] ''A'' is the least of the [[cardinality|cardinalities]] of the [[cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] subsets of ''A''. 

This definition of cofinality relies on the [[axiom of choice]], as it uses the fact that every non-empty set of [[cardinal number]]s has a least member. The cofinality of a partially ordered set ''A'' can alternatively be defined as the least [[ordinal number|ordinal]] ''x'' such that there is a function from ''x'' to ''A'' with cofinal [[Image (mathematics)|image]]. This second definition makes sense without the axiom of choice. If the axiom of choice is assumed, as will be the case in the rest of this article, then the two definitions are equivalent.

Cofinality can be similarly defined for a [[directed set]] and is used to generalize the notion of a [[subsequence]] in a [[Net (mathematics)|net]].

== Examples ==
*  The cofinality of a partially ordered set with [[greatest element]] is 1 as the set consisting only of the greatest element is cofinal (and must be contained in every other cofinal subset).
** In particular, the cofinality of any nonzero finite ordinal, or indeed any finite directed set, is 1, since such sets have a greatest element.
* Every cofinal subset of a partially ordered set must contain all [[maximal element]]s of that set. Thus the cofinality of a finite partially ordered set is equal to the number of its maximal elements.
** In particular, let ''A'' be a set of size ''n'', and consider the set of subsets of ''A'' containing no more than ''m'' elements.  This is partially ordered under inclusion and the subsets with ''m'' elements are maximal.  Thus the cofinality of this poset is ''n'' [[Binomial coefficient|choose]] ''m''.
* A subset of the natural numbers '''N''' is cofinal in '''N''' if and only if it is infinite, and therefore the cofinality of &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; is a [[regular cardinal]].
* The cofinality of the [[real number]]s with their usual ordering is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;, since '''N''' is cofinal in '''R'''.  The usual ordering of '''R''' is not [[order isomorphic]] to ''c'', the [[cardinality of the continuum|cardinality of the real numbers]], which has cofinality strictly greater than &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;.  This demonstrates that the cofinality depends on the order; different orders on the same set may have different cofinality.

==Properties==
If ''A'' admits a [[total order|totally ordered]] cofinal subset, then we can find a subset ''B'' which is well-ordered and cofinal in ''A''. Any subset of ''B'' is also well-ordered. If two cofinal subsets of ''B'' have minimal cardinality (i.e. their cardinality is the cofinality of ''B''), then they are order isomorphic to each other.

== Cofinality of ordinals and other well-ordered sets ==
The '''cofinality of an ordinal''' &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest ordinal &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; which is the [[order type]] of a [[cofinal subset]] of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  The cofinality of a set of ordinals or any other [[well-ordered set]] is the cofinality of the order type of that set.

Thus for a [[limit ordinal]], there exists a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-indexed strictly increasing sequence with limit &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, the cofinality of ω² is ω, because the sequence ω·''m'' (where ''m'' ranges over the natural numbers) tends to ω²; but, more generally, any countable limit ordinal has cofinality ω.  An uncountable limit ordinal may have either cofinality ω as does &lt;math&gt;\omega_\omega&lt;/math&gt; or an uncountable cofinality.

The cofinality of 0 is 0. The cofinality of any [[successor ordinal]] is 1.  The cofinality of any limit ordinal is at least &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;.

== Regular and singular ordinals ==
A '''regular ordinal''' is an ordinal which is equal to its cofinality. A '''singular ordinal''' is any ordinal which is not regular. 

Every regular ordinal is the [[initial ordinal]] of a cardinal.  Any limit of regular ordinals is a limit of initial ordinals and thus is also initial but need not be regular. Assuming the Axiom of choice, &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\alpha+1}&lt;/math&gt; is regular for each α.  In this case, the ordinals 0, 1, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\omega_2&lt;/math&gt; are regular, whereas 2, 3, &lt;math&gt;\omega_\omega&lt;/math&gt;, and ω&lt;sub&gt;ω·2&lt;/sub&gt; are initial ordinals which are not regular.

The cofinality of any ordinal ''α'' is a regular ordinal, i.e. the cofinality of the cofinality of ''α'' is the same as the cofinality of ''α''.  So the cofinality operation is ''idempotent''.

==Cofinality of cardinals==
If κ is an infinite cardinal number, then cf(κ) is the least cardinal such that there is an [[bounded (set theory)|unbounded]] function from it to κ; and cf(κ) = the cardinality of the smallest collection of sets of strictly smaller cardinals such that their sum is κ; more precisely

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{cf}(\kappa) = \inf \left\{ \mathrm{card}(I)\ |\ \kappa = \sum_{i \in I} \lambda_i\ \mathrm{and}\ (\forall i)(\lambda_i &lt; \kappa)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

That the set above is nonempty comes from the fact that

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa = \bigcup_{i \in \kappa} \{i\}&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. the [[disjoint union]] of κ singleton sets. This implies immediately that cf(κ) ≤ κ.
The cofinality of any totally ordered set is regular, so one has cf(κ) = cf(cf(κ)).

Using [[König's theorem (set theory)|König's theorem]], one can prove κ &lt; κ&lt;sup&gt;cf(κ)&lt;/sup&gt; and κ &lt; cf(2&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt;) for any infinite cardinal κ.

The last inequality implies that the cofinality of the cardinality of the continuum must be uncountable. On the other hand,

:&lt;math&gt; \aleph_\omega = \bigcup_{n &lt; \omega} \aleph_n &lt;/math&gt;.

the ordinal number ω being the first infinite ordinal, so that the cofinality of &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\omega&lt;/math&gt; is card(ω) = &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;.  (In particular, &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\omega&lt;/math&gt; is singular.) Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}\neq\aleph_\omega.&lt;/math&gt;

(Compare to the [[continuum hypothesis]], which states &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}= \aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;.)

Generalizing this argument, one can prove that for a limit ordinal δ

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{cf} (\aleph_\delta) = \mathrm{cf} (\delta) &lt;/math&gt;.

A '''citadel''' is a [[Fortification|fortress]] for protecting a [[town]], sometimes incorporating a [[castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Castles: Their Construction and History |author= [[Sidney Toy]]|year=1985|publisher=[[Courier Dover]]|isbn=0486248984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term derives from the same [[Latin language|Latin]] root as the word &quot;city&quot;, ''civis'', meaning citizen.

In a [[fortification]] with [[bastion]]s, the citadel is the strongest part of the system, sometimes well inside the outer walls and bastions, but often forming part of the outer wall for the sake of economy.  It is positioned to be the last line of defence should the enemy breach the other components of the fortification system.  A citadel is also a term of the third part of a medieval castle, with higher walls than the rest.  It was to be the last line of defence before the [[keep]] itself.

The oldest known structures which have served as citadels were built by the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], where the citadel represented a centralised authority. The main citadel in Indus Valley was almost 12 meters tall. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thapar |first=B. K. |year=1975 |title=Kalibangan: A Harappan Metropolis Beyond the Indus Valley |journal=Expedition |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=19–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these structures, however, remains debated. Though the structures found in the ruins of [[Mohenjo-daro]] were walled, it is far from clear that these structures were defensive against enemy attacks. Rather, they may have been built to divert flood waters.

In ancient [[Greece]], the [[Acropolis]] (literally: &quot;peak of the city&quot;), placed on a commanding eminence, was important in the life of the people, serving as a [[refuge]] and [[stronghold]] in peril and containing military and food supplies, the [[shrine]] of the god and a royal [[palace]]. The most well-known is the [[Acropolis of Athens]], but nearly every Greek city-state had one - the [[Acrocorinth]] famed as a particularly strong fortress. In a much later period, when Greece was ruled by the [[Latin Empire]], the same strongpoints were used by the new feudal rulers for much the same purposes.  

In various countries, the citadels gained a specific name such as &quot;[[Kremlin]]&quot; in [[Russia]] or &quot;[[Alcazaba]]&quot; in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. In European cities, the term &quot;Citadel&quot; and &quot;City Castle&quot; are often used interchangeably. The term &quot;tower&quot; is also used in some cases such as the [[Tower of London]] and Jerusalem's (misnamed) [[Tower of David]]. 

At various periods, and particularly during the [[Middle Ages]], the citadel - having its own fortifications, independent of the city walls - was the last defence of a besieged army, often held after the town had been conquered. A city where the citadel held out against an invading army was not considered conquered. For example, in the 1543 [[Siege of Nice]] the Ottoman forces led by [[Barbarossa]] conquered and pillaged the town itself and took many captives - but the city castle held out, due to which the townspeople were accounted the victors (and took considerable pride in it). 

Similarly, rebels who took power in the city but with the citadel still held by the former rulers could by no means regard their tenure of power as secure. One such incident played an important part in the history of the [[Maccabean Revolt]] against the [[Seleucid Empire]]. The Hellenistic garrison of [[Jerusalem]] and local supporters of the Seleucids held out for many years in the [[Acra (fortress)|Acra]] citadel, making Maccabean rule in the rest of Jerusalem precarious. When finally gaining possession of the place, the Maccabeans pointedly destroyed and razed the Acra, though they constructed another citadel for their own use in a different part of Jerusalem.  

As late as the 19th Century, a similar situation developed at [[Antwerp]], where a Dutch garrison under General [[David Hendrik Chassé]] held out in the city's citadel between 1830 and 1832, while the city itself had already become part of the independent [[Belgium]]. 
   
In time of war the citadel in many cases afforded retreat to the people living in the areas around the town. However, Citadels were often used also to protect a garrison or political power from the inhabitants of the town where it was located, being designed to ensure loyalty from the town which they defended. 

For example [[Barcelona]] had a great citadel built in 1714 to intimidate the [[Catalan people|Catalans]] against repeating their mid 17th and early 18th century rebellions against the Spanish central government. In the 19th century, as soon as the political climate had liberalised enough to permit it, the people of Barcelona had the citadel torn down, and replaced it with the city's main central park, the [[Parc de la Ciutadella]]. A similar example is the [[Citadella]] in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. 

The attack on the [[Bastille]] in the [[French Revolution]] - though afterwards remembered mainly for the release of the handful of prisoners incarcerated there - was to considerable degree motivated by the structure being a Royal citadel in the midst of revolutionary Paris. 

Similarly, after [[Garibaldi]]'s overthrow of [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] rule in [[Palermo]], during the [[1860]] [[Unification of Italy]], Palermo's Castellamare Citadel - symbol of the hated and oppressive former rule - was ceremoniously demolished. 

The [[Siege of the Alcázar]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]], in which the Nationalists held out against a much larger Republican force for two months until relieved, shows that in some cases a citadel can be effective even in modern warfare; a similar case is the [[Battle of Huế]], where an NVA division held the citadel of Huế for 26 days against roughly their own numbers of much better-equipped US and South Vietnamese troops.

The [[Citadelle of Quebec]]  still survives as the largest citadel still in official military operation in North America after more than two hundred years of existence.

'''Mail''' or '''chain mail''' is a type of [[armour]] consisting of small metal rings linked together in a pattern to form a mesh. The word ''chainmail'' is of relatively recent coinage, having been in use only since the 18th century; prior to this it was referred to simply as ''mail''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mail first appeared some time after 400 BC. and its invention is credited to the [[Celts]].  It may have been inspired by the much earlier [[scale armour]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Sidnell, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=l4KYsLl0sVIC&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true ''Warhorse: Cavalry in Ancient Warfare''], Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006 ISBN 1852853743, p.159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Krebs, Carolyn A. Krebs, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0H0fjBeseVEC&amp;pg=PA309#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true ''Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the Ancient World''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003 ISBN 0313313423, p.309&lt;/ref&gt;  Mail was a highly successful type of armour and was used by nearly every metalworking culture. From its adoption by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] in 300 BC&lt;ref&gt;Michel Feugère, [http://books.google.com/books?id=RXffAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=first+chainmail&amp;dq=first+chainmail&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V5Z4TayQF4ji0gH9nOXvAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA ''Weapons of the Romans''], Tempus, 2002 p.101&lt;/ref&gt; to its decline in the 17th and 18th centuries the history of mail was one of proliferation. From its start in Europe it came to be used in North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, India, Tibet, Korea  and finally Japan. Through trade, mail spread around the world yet its basic design remained the same although certain features of mail armour started to change during its journey eastward. The 2500 year history of mail continues into the 21st century as it remains in limited use as a component of stab vests and a number of other applications. Mail is also used in reenactments, decorative uses and jewelry.

==Etymology==
{{refimprove|section|date=March 2011}}
[[File:Bayeux haubert.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Mail byrnie from the Museum of Bayeux]]
In the Dark Ages coin mail was often referred to as &quot;ring maille&quot; to distinguish it from other types of mail, such as [[Lamellar armour|lamellar]] and [[splinted mail]]. In the [[Middle Ages]] scale armour died out, but mail remained under the French term &quot;maille&quot; or &quot;mayle&quot;, meaning &quot;mesh or net&quot; which derived from Latin ''macula'', or &quot;mesh in a net&quot;. In the [[Victorian England|Victorian period]], interest in the Middle Ages was rekindled, and the [[Gothic revival]] began. Because of its resemblance to chains, &quot;maille&quot; took on the name of ''chain mail''. The word ''mail'' refers to the armour material, not the garment made from it. Civilizations that used mail had different terms for the individual types of garments.  In the English language European types of garments made with mail are leggings'' [[chausses]]'', mail hoods ''[[coif]]'' and mail mittens ''mitons''. A mail collar hanging from a helmet is ''camail'' or ''[[aventail]]''. A mail collar worn strapped around the neck was called a ''pixane'' or ''standard''. A shirt made from mail is a ''[[hauberk]]'' if knee-length and a ''[[haubergeon]]'' if mid-thigh length. A waist-length coat in medieval Europe was called a ''byrnie'' although the composition of a byrnie is unclear.  Noting that the byrnie was the ″most highly valued piece of armour″ to the [[Charlemagne|Carolingian]] soldier, Bennet, Bradbury, DeVries, Dickie, and Jestice&lt;ref&gt;Bennet, M., Bradbury, J., DeVries, K., Dickie, I., &amp; Jestice, P. ''Fighting Techniques of the Medieval World''. Thomas Dunne Books, 2005, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;There is some dispute among historians as to what exactly constituted the Carolingian byrnie.  Relying . . . only on artistic and some literary sources because of the lack of archaelogical examples, some believe that it was a heavy leather jacket with metal scales sewn onto it. It was also quite long, reaching below the hips and covering most of the arms.  Other historians claim instead that the Carolingian byrnie was nothing more than a coat of chain mail, but longer and perhaps heavier than traditional early medieval mail. Without more certain evidence, this dispute will continue&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The use of mail was prominent throughout the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], [[Middle Ages|High Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], and reached its apex in Europe, in terms of coverage, during the 13th century, when mail covered the whole body.
The earliest finds of mail are from the 3rd century BC from Horný Jatov, Slovakia, and a [[Celt]]ic chieftain's burial located in Ciumeşti, Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Rusu, M., &quot;Das Keltische Fürstengrab von Ciumeşti in Rumänien&quot;, Germania 50, 1969, pp. 267–269&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the [[Roman Republic]] first came into contact with mail fighting the Gauls in [[Cisalpine Gaul]], now [[Northern Italy]]. The Roman army adopted the technology for their troops in the form of the [[lorica hamata]] which was used as a primary form of armour through the Imperial period. 

After the fall of the Western Empire much of the infrastructure needed to create [[plate armour]] was lost and it was replaced by mail armour in most regions. Eventually the word &quot;mail&quot; came to be synonymous with armour. It was typically an extremely prized commodity as it was expensive and time consuming to produce and could mean the difference between life and death in a battle. Thus, it was usually only worn by chieftains, nobility, and wealthier soldiers or mercenaries. A Viking haubergeon was said to cost the equivalent of twelve milk cows and a suit often cost as much as a small house. Mail from dead combatants was frequently looted and was used by the new owner or sold for a lucrative price. As time went on and infrastructure improved it came to be used by more soldiers. Eventually with the rise of the lanced cavalry charge, impact warfare and high-powered [[crossbows]] mail came to be used as a secondary armour to plate for the mounted nobility.

By the 14th century, [[plate armour]] was commonly used to supplement mail. Eventually mail was supplanted by plate for the most part as it provided greater protection against windlass crossbows, bludgeoning weapons, and lance charges. However, mail was still widely used by many soldiers as well as [[brigandine]]s and [[padded jack]]s. These three types of armour made up the bulk of the equipment used by soldiers with mail being the most expensive. It was quite often more expensive than plate armour.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Jr., Robert W.&quot;Armour Purchases and Lists from the Howard Household Books&quot;, The Journal of the Mail Research Society, Vol. 1. No. 1, July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; A mail shirt interwoven between two layers of fabric is called ''jazzeraint'', and can be worn as protective clothing. Mail typically persisted longer in less technologically advanced areas such as Eastern Europe but was in use everywhere into the 16th century.

==Mail armour in Asia==
{{ref improve section|date=December 2010}}
Mail Armour was introduced to the Middle East and Asia through the Romans and was adopted by the [[Sassanid]] Persians starting in the 3rd century AD, where it was supplemental to the scale and lamellar types already used. It was commonly also used as horse armour for [[cataphracts]] and heavy cavalry as well as armour for the soldiers themselves. Asian mail was typically lighter than the European variety and sometimes had prayer symbols stamped on the rings as a sign of their craftsmanship as well as for divine protection. Indeed, mail armour is mentioned in the [[Koran]] as being a gift revealed by Allah to David:

21:80 ''It was We Who taught him the making of coats of mail for your benefit, to guard you from each other's violence: will ye then be grateful?'' (Yusuf Ali's translation).

From the Middle East mail was quickly adopted in Central Asia by the Sogdians and by India in the South. It was not commonly used in Mongol armies due to its weight and the difficulty of its maintenance, but it eventually became the armour of choice in India. Indian mail was typically light in construction and was often used with plate protection. [[Plated mail]] was in common use in India until the [[Battle of Plassey]] and the subsequent British conquest of the sub-continent.

The [[Ottoman Empire]] used plated mail widely and it was used in their armies until the 18th century by heavy cavalry and elite units such as the Janissaries. They spread its use into North Africa where it was adopted by [[Mamluk]] Egyptians and the Sudanese who produced it until the early 20th century.

Mail was introduced to [[China]] when its allies in Central Asia paid tribute to the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang Emperor]] in 718 by giving him a coat of &quot;link armour&quot; assumed to be chainmail. China first encountered the armour in 384 when its allies in the nation of [[Kuchi]] arrived wearing &quot;armour similar to chains&quot;. Once in China mail was imported but was not produced widely. It was typically the armour of high-ranking guards and those who could afford the import rather than the armour of the rank and file, who used the easier to produce and maintain brigandine and [[Lamellar armour|lamellar]] types. However, it was one of the only military products that China imported from foreigners. Mail spread to Korea slightly later where it was imported as the armour of imperial guards and generals.

===Mail armour (kusari) in Japan===
The Japanese had more varieties of mail then all the rest of the world put together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=A4Rp_Qx9in4C&amp;pg=PA70 ''A glossary of the construction, decoration, and use of arms and armour'' by George Cameron, p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Japan]] mail is called [[Commons:category:Japanese chain mail|''kusari'']] which means chain. When the word ''kusari'' is used in conjunction with an armoured item it usually means that the ''kusari'' makes up the majority of the armour defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=J5PgapzD6FoC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=kusari&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=509hTfGDMIa0lQfds-CTDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=kusari&amp;f=true ''A Glossary of the Construction, Decoration and Use of Arms and Armor: In All Countries and in All Times'', George Cameron Stone, Courier Dover Publications, 1999 p. 403]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this would be ''kusari gusoku'' which means chain armour.  ''Kusari'' ''[[Commons:category:Kusari katabira|jackets]]'', ''[[Commons:category:Kusari zukin|hoods]]'', ''[[Commons:Category:Kusari han kote|gloves]]'', ''[[Commons:category:Kusari vests|vests]]'', ''[[Commons:category:Kusari suneate|shin]]'', shoulder, ''[[Commons:Category:Kusari haidate|thigh guards]]'', and other armoured clothing were produced, even ''[[Commons:category:Kusari tabi|kusari tabi]]'' socks.   

[[Commons:category:Japanese chain mail|''Kusari'']] was used in Japanese armour at least from the time of the Mongol invasion (1270s) but particularly from the Nambokucho period (1336–1392).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=QOH-icuirzAC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=Japanese+mail+armor&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=P7tgTYPtNIeglAfPrbDnCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Japanese%20mail%20armor&amp;f=true ''Brassey's Book of Body Armor'', Robert C. Woosnam-Savage, Anthony Hall, Brassey's, 2002 p.92]&lt;/ref&gt; Two primary weave methods were used: a square 4-in-1 pattern (''so gusari'') and a hexagonal 6-in-1 pattern (''hana gusari''). Kusari was typically made with rings that were much smaller than their European counterparts, and patches of kusari were used to link together plates and to drape over vulnerable areas such as the underarm.  

'''Riveted kusari''' was known and used in Japan. In the book Japanese Arms &amp; Armor Introduction By Robinson, H Russell NA on page 58 there is a picture of Japanese riveted kusari,&lt;ref&gt;JAPANESE ARMS &amp; ARMOR, INTRODUCTION BY ROBINSON, H RUSSELL NA,Publisher: CROWN,1969,p.58,ASIN:B000PSBYO8&lt;/ref&gt; and
according to this translated reference from Sakakibara Kozan's 1800 book, The Manufacture of Armour and Helmets in Sixteenth Century Japan, the Japanese not only knew of and used riveted kusari they manufactured it as well.

Its invention is credited to Fukushima Dembei Kunitaka, pupil, of Hojo Awa no Kami Ujifusa, but it is also said to be derived directly from foreign models.

The samurai era ended in the 1860s, this along with the 1876 ban on swords being worn in public signaled the end of any practical use for mail and other armours in Japan. Japan turned to a conscription army and uniforms replaced armour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=zPyswmGDBFkC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=meiji+sword+ban&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gN53TZvlMJT3rAGo79H_CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=meiji%20sword%20ban&amp;f=false The connoisseur's book of Japanese swords, Kōkan Nagayama, Kodansha International], 1998 p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
{{ref improve section|date=December 2010}}
Mail armour provided an effective defence against slashing blows by an [[blade|edged weapon]] and penetration by thrusting and piercing weapons; in fact the [[Royal Armouries|Royal Armoury]] at [[Leeds]] concluded that &quot;... it is almost impossible to penetrate using any conventional medieval weapon...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Medieval Military Surgery&quot;, Medieval History Magazine, Vol 1 is 4, December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Deadliest Warrior]]: episode 2; katana unable to penetrate chain mail&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, mail's resistance to weapons is determined by four factors: linkage type (riveted, butted, or welded), material used (iron versus bronze or steel), weave density (a tighter weave needs a thinner weapon to surpass), and ring thickness (generally ranging from 18 to 14 gauge in most examples). Mail, if a warrior could afford it, could provide a significant advantage to a warrior when combined with competent fighting techniques. However, a good sword blow arriving in exactly perpendicular angle to the surface ''could'' cut through the links {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}; when the mail was not riveted, a well placed thrust from a spear or thin sword could penetrate, and a [[Pollaxe (polearm)|poleaxe]] or [[halberd]] blow could break through the armour. In India, punching daggers known as [[katars]] were developed that could pierce the light mail used in the area. Some evidence indicates that during armoured combat the intention was to actually get around the armour rather than through it—according to a study of skeletons found in [[Visby]], Sweden, a majority of the skeletons showed wounds on less well protected legs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The flexibility of mail meant that a blow would often injure the wearer, potentially causing serious bruising or fractures, and it was a poor defence against head trauma. Mail-clad warriors typically wore separate rigid, [[helmet|helms]] over their mail coifs for head protection. Likewise, blunt weapons such as [[Mace (club)|mace]]s and [[war hammer|warhammer]]s could harm the wearer by their impact without penetrating the armour; usually a soft armour, such as [[gambeson]], was worn under the hauberk. Mediaeval surgeons were very well capable of setting and caring for bone fractures resulting from blunt weapons. With the poor understanding of hygiene however, cuts that could get infected were much more of a problem. Thus mail armour proved to be sufficient protection in most situations.

==Manufacture==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
[[File:Chainmail detail.jpg|left|thumb|modern riveted mail made of alternating rows of riveted and solid links.]]
Several patterns of linking the rings together have been known since ancient times, with the most common being the 4-to-1 pattern (where each ring is linked with four others). In Europe, the 4-to-1 pattern was completely dominant. Mail was also common in East Asia, primarily Japan, with several more patterns being utilised and an entire nomenclature developing around them.

Historically, in Europe, from the pre-Roman period on, the rings composing a piece of mail would be [[rivet]]ed closed to reduce the chance of the rings splitting open when subjected to a thrusting attack or a hit by an arrow.
 
Up until the 14th century European mail was made of alternating rows of both riveted rings and solid rings. After that it was almost all made from riveted rings only. Both would have been made using [[wrought iron]]. Some later pieces were made of wrought steel with an appreciable carbon content that allowed the piece to be heat treated. Wire for the riveted rings was formed by either of two methods. One was to hammer out wrought iron into plates and cut or slit the plates. These thin pieces were then pulled through a draw-plate repeatedly until the desired diameter was achieved. [[Waterwheel]] powered drawing mills are pictured in several period manuscripts. Another method was to simply forge down an iron billet into a rod and then proceed to draw it out into wire. The solid links would have been made by punching from a sheet. Guild marks were often stamped on the rings to show their origin and craftsmanship. Forge welding was also used to create solid links, but the only known example from Europe is that of the 7th century Coppergate mail drape. Outside of Europe this practice was more common such as &quot;theta&quot; links from India. Very few examples of historic butted mail have been found and it is generally accepted that butted mail was never in wide use historically except in Japan were mail ''kusari'' was commonly made from ''butted'' links.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;

Mail is used as protective clothing for butchers against meat-packing equipment. Workers may wear up to 8&amp;nbsp;lb (4&amp;nbsp;kg) of mail under their white coats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butchers also commonly wear a single mail glove to protect themselves from self-inflicted injury while cutting meat. 

Woodcarvers sometimes use similar mail gloves to protect their hands from cuts and punctures.

Scuba divers use mail to protect them from sharkbite, as do animal control officers for protection against the animals they handle. Shark expert and underwater filmmaker [[Ron &amp; Valerie Taylor|Valerie Taylor]] was among the first to develop and test the mail suit in 1979 while diving with sharks. The [[British police]] use mail gloves for dealing with knife-armed aggressors.

During World War I, mail was evaluated as a material for [[Ballistic vest|bulletproof vests]], but results were unsatisfactory, as the rings would fragment and further aggravate the damage. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} A mail fringe, designed by Captain Cruise of the British Infantry, was added to helmets to protect the face, but this proved unpopular with soldiers, in spite of being proven to defend against a three-ounce (100 g) [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] round fired at a distance of one hundred yards (90 m).

====Stab proof Vests====
Conventional textile based ballistic vests are designed to stop soft nosed bullets but offer little defense from knife attacks. Knife resistant armors are designed to defend against knife attacks, some of these use layers of metal plates, mail and metallic wires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=FMgpdulJsGgC&amp;pg=PA368&amp;dq=chainmail+stab+proof+vest&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5l2hTay4PIqWtwfj1qCeAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true Illustrated Directory of Special Forces, Ray Bonds, David Miller, Zenith Imprint, 2003 P.368]&lt;/REF&gt;
===Historical re-enactment===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
[[File:Woman wearing chainmail.jpg|right|thumb|A woman models a [[haubergeon]] and coif of modern make.]]
[[File:Major's shoulder chains.JPG|right|thumb|Major's shoulder chains]]

Many [[historical reenactment]] groups, especially those whose focus is [[Ancient history|Antiquity]] or the [[Middle Ages]], commonly use mail both as practical armour and for costuming. Mail is especially popular amongst those groups which use steel weapons. A fighter wearing hauberk and chausses can run, lie, stand up, jump, do somersaults (or even cartwheels), and even swim wearing full armour, depending on the fitness of the wearer. A modern hauberk made from 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm diameter wire with 10&amp;nbsp;mm inner diameter rings weighs roughly 10&amp;nbsp;kg and contains 15,000–45,000 rings. Mail can be used under everyday clothes and many reenactors wear a hauberk under their regular clothes to accustom themselves to it. 

One of the two real drawbacks of mail is the uneven weight distribution; the stress falls mainly on shoulders. Weight can be better distributed by wearing a belt over the mail, which provides another point of support.

Mail worn today for re-enactment and recreational use can be made in a variety of styles and materials. Most recreational mail today is made of galvanized or stainless steel and is butted, which is historically inaccurate (except for Japanesed based mail ''kusari'' which was commonly made from ''butted links''&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;) but is much cheaper to procure and maintain. Mail can also be made of titanium, aluminum, bronze, or copper. Riveted mail is much more expensive than butted but has significantly more historical accuracy as well as protection ability. Some television shows such as [[Deadliest Warrior]] have incorrectly portrayed butted mail as having been used historically in Europe or the Middle East. 
 
A reenactment of a long-distance march conforming to service conditions in the Imperial Western Roman army
has recently revealed that mail which is worn daily is effectively rustproof and self-polishing; the motion of the rings against each other keeps them scoured.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Decorative uses===
Mail remained in use as a decorative and possibly high-status symbol with military overtones long after its practical usefulness had passed. It was frequently used for the [[epaulette]]s of military uniforms. It is still used in this form by the British [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]], and the [[Canadian Army#Armour|Royal Canadian Armour Corps]] of the [[Canadian Army]].

Mail also has applications in sculpture and jewelry, especially when made out of precious metals or colorful [[anodizing|anodized]] metals. Recent trends in mail artwork include headdresses, Christmas ornaments, chess sets, and all manner of jewelry. For these non-traditional applications, hundreds of new weaves or patterns have been invented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rescyou.deviantart.com/gallery/ DeviantArt.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film==
 {{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
In some films, knitted string spray-painted with a metallic paint is used instead of actual mail in order to cut down on cost (a notable example being ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', which was filmed on a very small budget). Films more dedicated to costume accuracy often use [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS plastic]] rings, for the lower cost and weight. Such ABS mail coats were made for [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|the ''Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]], in addition to many metal coats. The metal coats are used rarely because of their weight, except in close-up filming where the appearance of ABS rings is clearly distinguishable.

Cerberus featured in many works of ancient Greek and Roman literature and in works of both ancient and modern art and architecture, although, the depiction and background surrounding Cerberus often differed across various works by different authors of the era. The most notable difference is the number of its heads: Most sources describe or depict three heads; others show it with two or even just one; a smaller number of sources show a variable number, sometimes as many as 50.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Cerberus-Blake.jpeg|thumb|left|Cerberus, watercolor by [[William Blake]].]]
The name &quot;Cerberus&quot; is a [[Latinised]] version of the Greek ''Kerberos'', which may be related to the [[Sanskrit]] word सर्वरा &quot;sarvarā&quot;, used as an epithet of one of the dogs of [[Yama]], from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word *ḱerberos, meaning &quot;spotted&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World|coauthors=J. P. Mallory, D. Q. Adams|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=0199287910|page=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This etymology suffers from the fact that it includes a reconstructed *b, which is extremely rare in Proto-Indo-European. Yet according to [[Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch|Pokorny]] it is well distributed, with additional apparent cognates in Slavic, British and Lithuanian).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=config&amp;morpho=0&amp;basename=%5Cdata%5Cie%5Cpokorny&amp;first=921 |title= ? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a dog is uncertain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Cerberus|title= Cerberus|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|first=Douglas|last=Harper|accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://colet.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/chuck/woodhouse_pages.pl?page_num=1005|title=Woodhouse's English-Greek Dictionary|publisher= University of Chicago Library|accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; although mythologists have speculated that the association was first made in the city of Trikarenos in Phliasia.&lt;ref name=&quot;maurice-7&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Cerberus the Dog of Hades|first=Maurice|last= Bloomfield|year=2003|publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing]]|isbn=0766130207|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cerberus is said to be the sibling of the [[Lernaean Hydra]], the [[Nemean Lion]], the [[Sphinx#Greek traditions|Sphinx]], the [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]], and the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]].

&quot;Cerberus&quot; is generally pronounced in English with a soft C as in cell, even though the ancient pronunciation, in both Greek and Latin was with a hard C as in cat.

Cerberus was the offspring of [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], a hybrid half-woman and half-serpent, and [[Typhon]], a fire-breathing giant whom even the Olympian gods feared. Its brother is [[Orthrus]], always depicted as a two-headed [[hellhound]].&lt;ref name=&quot;perseus-cerberustask&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Herakles/cerberus.html|title=Hercules' Twelfth Labor: Cerberus|publisher=Perseus Project|accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common depiction of Cerberus in Greek mythology and art is as having three heads, a mane of live serpents (similar to [[Medusa]]'s hair) and a snake's tail. In most works the three-heads each respectively see and represent the past, the present, and the future, while other sources suggest the heads represent birth, youth, and old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cerberus the Dog of Hades|first=Maurice|last=Bloomfield|year= 2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=0766130207|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of Cerberus' heads is said to have an appetite only for live meat and thus allow the spirits of the dead to freely enter the underworld, but allow none to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Myths, Gods &amp; Fantasy|first=Pamela|last=Allardice|year=1991|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=0874366607|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cerberus was always employed as Hades' loyal watchdog, and guarded the gates that granted access and exit to the underworld (also called Hades).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Myths of Greece and Rome|first=Helene|last=Guerber|isbn=0766148564|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Twelfth Labor of Heracles===
[[File:Herakles Kerberos Eurystheus Louvre E701.jpg|thumb|left|An ancient Etruscan vase from [[Caere]] (ca 525 BC) depicting [[Heracles]] presenting Cerberus to [[Eurystheus]].]]
The task of capturing Cerberus alive, without using weapons, was the final labour assigned to [[Heracles]] (Hercules) by [[Eurystheus|King Eurystheus]], in recompense for the killing of his own children by [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]] after he was driven insane by [[Hera]], and therefore was the most dangerous and difficult. In the traditional version, Heracles would not have been required to capture Cerberus, however Eurystheus discounted the completion of two of the tasks as Heracles had received assistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;perseus-cerberustask&quot;/&gt;

After having been given the task, Heracles went to [[Eleusis]] to be initiated in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] so that he could learn how to enter and exit the underworld alive, and in passing absolve himself for killing centaurs. He found the entrance to the underworld at [[Tanaerum]], and [[Athena]] and [[Hermes]] helped him to traverse the entrance in each direction. He passed [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] with Hestia's assistance and his own heavy and fierce frowning.

Whilst in the underworld, Heracles met [[Theseus]] and [[Pirithous]]. The two companions had been imprisoned by Hades for attempting to kidnap [[Persephone]]. One tradition tells of snakes coiling around their legs then turning into stone; another that Hades feigned hospitality and prepared a feast inviting them to sit. They unknowingly sat in chairs of forgetfulness and were permanently ensnared. When Heracles had pulled Theseus first from his chair, some of his thigh stuck to it (this explains the supposedly lean thighs of Athenians), but the earth shook at the attempt to liberate Pirithous, whose desire to have the wife of a god for himself was so insulting he was doomed to stay behind.

Heracles found [[Hades]] and asked permission to bring Cerberus to the surface, which Hades agreed to if Heracles could overpower the beast without using weapons. Heracles was able to overpower Cerberus and proceeded to sling the beast over his back, dragging it out of the underworld through a cavern entrance in the [[Peloponnese]] and bringing it to Eurystheus. The king was so frightened of the beast that he jumped into a [[pithos]], and asked Heracles to return it to the underworld in return for releasing him from his labors.

Cerberus featured in many prominent works of Greek and Roman literature, most famously in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Peisandros of Rhodes]]' [[epic poem]] the ''[[Labours of Hercules]]'', the story of [[Orpheus]] in [[Plato]]'s ''Symposium'', and in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', which is the only known reference to one of Heracles' labours which first appeared in a literary source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Iliad|author=Homer|chapter=8|page=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin//ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134&amp;layout=&amp;loc=8.366 366–369]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The depiction of Cerberus is relatively consistent between different works and authors, the common theme of the mane of serpents is kept across works, as is the serpent's tail, most literary works of the era describe Cerberus as having three heads with the only notable exception being [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' in which he had 50 heads.&lt;ref name=&quot;hesiod-differs&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title= Theogony|author=Hesiod|page=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D310 310]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most occurrences in ancient literature revolve around the basis of the threat of Cerberus being overcome to allow a living being access to the underworld; in the ''Aeneid'' Cerberus was lulled to sleep after being tricked into eating drugged honeycakes and Orpheus put the creature to sleep with his music. Capturing Cerberus alive was the twelfth and final labour of Heracles. In [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', Canto VI, the &quot;great worm&quot; Cerberus is found in the Third Circle of Hell, where he oversees and rends to pieces those who have succumbed to [[gluttony]], one of [[Roman Catholicism]]'s [[seven deadly sins]]. &lt;ref&gt;Dante. ''Divine Comedy'' [http://www.everypoet.com/archive/poetry/dante/dante_i_06.htm Inferno, canto VI]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Cerberus (constellation)|constellation Cerberus]] introduced by  [[Johannes Hevelius]] in 1687, Cerberus is sometimes substituted for the &quot;branch from the tree of the golden apples&quot; fetched by Atlas from the garden of the Hesperides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/cerberus.htm Ian Ridpath, &quot;Star Tales&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; This branch is the literary source of the &quot;[[Rex Nemorensis|golden bough]]&quot; in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' by [[Virgil]].

In ''[[Paradise Lost]]''11.65, Cerberean hounds are mentioned in Hell: &quot;A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark'd With wide Cerberean mouths full loud&quot;.

[[File:12th labour of Heracles - Project Gutenberg eText 19119.png|thumb|In this vase painting, Heracles leads a two-headed Cerberus out of Hades.]]
Numerous references to Cerberus have appeared in ancient [[Greek art|Greek]] and [[Roman art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Monist|publisher=Hegeler Institute|first=Edward|last=Hegeler|year=1904|page=524}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in [[archaeological]] ruins and often including in statues and architecture, inspired by the mythology of the creature. Cerberus' depiction in ancient art is not as definitive as in literature; the poets and linguists of ancient Greece and Rome mostly agreed on the physical appearance (with the notable exception in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' in which he had 50 heads).&lt;ref name=&quot;hesiod-differs&quot;/&gt; His depiction in classical art mostly shows the recurring motif of serpents, but the number of heads differs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cerberus the Dog of Hades|first=Maurice|last=Bloomfield|isbn=0766130207|page=3|chapter=Cerberus in Classical Art|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year =2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue in the [[Galleria Borghese]] depicts Cerberus with three heads sitting by the side of Hades, while a bronze sculpture depicting Heracles' twelfth labour shows the demi-god leading a two-headed Cerberus from the underworld. The majority of vases depicting the twelfth task also show Cerberus as having two heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cerberus the Dog of Hades|first= Maurice|last=Bloomfield|isbn=0766130207|page=4|chapter=Cerberus in Classical Art|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical critics have identified one of the earliest works of Cerberus as &quot;the most imaginative,&quot; that being a Laconian vase created around 560 BC in which Cerberus is shown with three-heads and with rows of serpents covering his body and heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to Classical Mythology|first=Robert|last=Lenardon|coauthors=Mark Morford, Michael Sham|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|isbn=0195147251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations==
There have been many attempts to explain the depiction of Cerberus. Greek philosopher, [[Heraclitus]], claimed [[Euhemerus|Euhemeristically]] that Cerberus had two pups which were never away from their father, as such Cerberus was in fact a normal (however very large) dog but artists incorporating the two pups into their work made it appear as if his two children were in fact extra heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Περὶ ἀπίστων|author=Heraclitus|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical historians have dismissed Heraclitus' explanation as &quot;feeble&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;maurice-7&quot;/&gt; Mythologers have speculated that if Cerberus was given his name in Trikarenos it could be interpreted as &quot;three karenos&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;maurice-7&quot;/&gt; Certain experts believe that the monster was inspired by the [[golden jackal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GJ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Golden Jackal|work= |publisher=Canids.org|url=http://www.canids.org/species/Golden_jackal.pdf|accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''camelCase''' (''camel case'' or ''camel-case'')—also known as '''medial capitals'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=www.askoxford.com |url=http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutwords/medial |title=What is the name for a word containing two capital letters (like WordPad)? |publisher=AskOxford |date= |accessdate=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;—is the practice of writing [[compound noun and adjective|compound word]]s or phrases in which the elements are joined without [[Whitespace (computer science)|space]]s, with each element's initial letter [[capitalization|capitalized]] within the compound and the first letter is either upper or lower case—as in &quot;[[Patti LaBelle|LaBelle]]&quot;, BackColor, &quot;[[McDonald's]]&quot;, or &quot;[[iPod]]&quot;. The name comes from the uppercase &quot;bumps&quot; in the middle of the compound word, suggestive of the humps of a [[camel]].  The practice is known by [[#Variations and synonyms|many other names]].

An early systematic use of medial capitals is the standard notation for [[chemical formula]]e, such as [[Sodium chloride|NaCl]], that has been widely used since the 19th century.  In the 1970s, medial capitals became an alternative (and often standard) [[naming conventions (programming)|identifier naming convention]] for several [[programming language]]s.  Since the 1980s, following the popularization of computer technology, it has become fashionable in [[marketing]] for names of products and companies.  However, medial capitals are rarely used in formal written English and most [[style guide]]s recommend against their use.

==Variations and synonyms==
The first letter of a camel-case compound may or may not be capitalized. For clarity, this article calls the two alternatives '''upper camel case''' and '''lower camel case'''.  Some people and organizations use the term ''camel case'' only for lower camel case. Other synonyms include:
&lt;!-- It's *not* called:

[[StudlyCaps]] style is similar (but not necessarily identical) to camel case.&lt;ref name=&quot;semicolon&quot;/&gt; It is sometimes used in reference to camel case but can also refer to random mixed capitalization (as in &quot;MiXeD CaPitALiZaTioN&quot;), popularly used in [[leet|online culture]].

Camel case is also distinct from [[title case]], which is traditionally used for book titles and headlines. Title case capitalizes most of the words yet retains the spaces between the words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2005/03/15/title-case-in-php/ Title Case in PHP] at [[SitePoint]] Blogs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordtips.vitalnews.com/Pages/T1685_Intelligent_Title_Case.html WordTips: Intelligent Title Case]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bloggingabout.net/blogs/jschreuder/archive/2006/11/14/How-to_3A00_-Change-casing-in-Text-to-TitleCase.aspx How to: Change casing in Text to TitleCase - Jan Schreuder on .Net]&lt;/ref&gt;

Camel case is also distinct from [[Tall Man lettering]], which uses capitals to emphasize the differences between similar-looking words.

==History==
=== Early uses in personal names ===

Medial capitals have always been used (albeit sporadically) in English, for example, as a traditional spelling style for certain surnames, such as in [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Clan MacLean|MacLean]] (originally, &quot;son of Gillean&quot;) and [[Hiberno-Norman]] [[FitzGerald]] (&quot;son of Gerald&quot;).  This same convention is sometimes used in English for surnames of foreign origin which include prepositions or other particles, e.g., [[DuPont]] (from [[French language|French]] ''Dupont'' or ''du Pont''), [[Leonardo DiCaprio|DiCaprio]] (from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''di Caprio'') and [[James A. VanDyke|VanDyke]] (from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''van Dijk'').  The actress [[ZaSu Pitts]], whose fame peaked in the 1930s and 1940s, sometimes spelt her [[given name]] in camel case, emphasizing its derivation from two other names.

===Chemical formulae===
The first systematic and widespread use of medial capitals for technical purposes was the notation for chemical formulae invented by the [[Swedish people|Swedish]] chemist [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius|Berzelius]] in 1813. To replace the multitude of naming and symbol conventions used by chemists until that time, he proposed to indicate each chemical element by a symbol of one or two letters, the first one being capitalized. The capitalization allowed formulae like 'NaCl' to be written without spaces and still be parsed without ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;
  Jöns Jacob Berzelius (1813). ''Essay on the Cause of Chemical Proportions and on Some Circumstances Relating to Them: Together with a Short and Easy Method of Expressing Them''. Annals of Philosophy 2, 443-454, 3, 51-52; (1814) 93-106, 244-255, 353-364
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
  Henry M. Leicester &amp; Herbert S. Klickstein, eds. (1952, ''A Source Book in Chemistry, 1400-1900'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Berzelius's system remains in use to this day, augmented with three-letter symbols like '[[Ununquadrium|Uuq]]' for unnamed elements; and has been extended to describe the [[aminoacid]] sequences of [[protein]]s and other similar domains. Internal capitalization has also been used for other technical codes like [[HeLa]] (1983).

===''The King's English''===
In their English style guide ''[[The King's English]]'', first published in 1906, [[Henry Watson Fowler|H. W. Fowler]] and [[Francis George Fowler|F. G. Fowler]] suggested that medial capitals could be used in triple [[compound word]]s where [[hyphen]]s would cause ambiguity—the examples they give are &quot;KingMark-like&quot; (as against &quot;King Mark-like&quot;) and &quot;Anglo-SouthAmerican&quot; (as against &quot;Anglo-South American&quot;).  However, they described the system as &quot;too hopelessly contrary to usage at present.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early use in trademarks===
Since the mid-20th century, medial capitals have occasionally been used for [[corporation|corporate]] names and product [[trademark]]s, such as
* [[CinemaScope]] and [[VistaVision]], rival [[widescreen]] [[film|movie]] formats (1953)
* [[ShopKo Stores, Inc.|ShopKo]] (1962)

===Computer programming===
{{Original research|section|reason=no citations and internet search shows no original sources, only sources that got it from wikipedia|date=May 2011}}
In the 1970s and 1980s, medial capitals were adopted as a standard or alternative [[identifier naming convention|naming convention]] for multi-word [[identifier]]s in several [[programming language]]s.  The origin of this convention has not yet been settled. However a 1954 conference proceedings&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/mit/summer_session_1954/Digital_Computers_Advanced_Coding_Techniques_Summer_1954.pdf &quot;Resume of Session 8&quot;. Digital Computers: Advanced Coding Techniques. Summer Session 1954, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, page 8-6.]&lt;/ref&gt; informally referred to IBM's [[Speedcoding]] system as &quot;SpeedCo&quot;. Christopher Strachey's paper on [[GPM]] (1965) 
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = [[Christopher Strachey|Strachey]]| first = Christopher | title = A General Purpose Macrogenerator| journal = Computer Journal| volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 225–241| date = October 1965 | doi = 10.1093/comjnl/8.3.225  }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows a program that includes some medial capital identifiers, including &quot;&lt;tt&gt;NextCh&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;tt&gt;WriteSymbol&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.

====Background: multi-word identifiers====
Computer [[Computer program|programmers]] often need to write descriptive (hence multi-word) [[identifier]]s, like &quot;&lt;tt&gt;end of file&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;tt&gt;char table&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;, in order to improve the readability of their code.  However, most popular programming languages forbid the use of spaces inside identifiers, since they are interpreted as [[delimiter]]s between [[Lexical analysis|tokens]].  The alternative of writing the words together as in &quot;&lt;tt&gt;endoffile&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;tt&gt;chartable&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; is not satisfactory, since the word boundaries may be quite difficult to discern in the result.

Some early programming languages, notably [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] (1958) and  [[COBOL]] (1959), addressed this problem by allowing a [[hyphen]] (&quot;-&quot;) to be used between words of compound identifiers, as in &quot;END-OF-FILE&quot;.  However, this solution was not adequate for algebraic-oriented languages such as [[FORTRAN]] (1955) and [[ALGOL 58|ALGOL]] (1958), which used the hyphen as an intuitively-obvious subtraction operator. (FORTRAN also restricted identifiers to six characters or fewer at the time, preventing multi-word identifiers except those made of very short words.) Since the common [[punched card]] character sets of the time had no lower-case letters and no other special character that would be adequate for the purpose, those early languages had to do without multi-word identifiers.

It was only in the late 1960s that the widespread adoption of the [[ASCII]] character set made both lower case and the [[underscore]] character &quot;&lt;tt&gt;_&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; universally available.  Some languages, notably [[C (programming language)|C]], promptly adopted underscores as word separators; and underscore-separated compounds like &quot;&lt;tt&gt;end_of_file&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; are still prevalent in C programs and libraries. However, some languages and programmers chose to avoid underscores and adopted camel case instead.  Two accounts are commonly given for the origin of this convention.

====The &quot;Lazy Programmer&quot; theory====
One theory for the origin of the camel case convention holds that C programmers and [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]] simply found it more convenient than the standard underscore-based style.

The underscore key is inconveniently placed on [[QWERTY]] keyboards.  Additionally, in some fonts the underscore character can be confused with a minus sign; it can be overlooked because it falls below the string of characters or it can be lost entirely when displayed or printed underlined or when printed on a [[dot-matrix printer]] with a defective pin or misaligned ribbon.  Moreover, early compilers severely restricted the length of identifiers (e.g., to 8 or 14 letters) or silently truncated all identifiers to that length.  Finally, the small size of [[computer display]]s available in the 1970s encouraged the use of short identifiers. Many C programmers opted to use camel case instead of underscores, for it yielded legible compound names with fewer keystrokes and fewer characters.

====The &quot;Alto Keyboard&quot; theory====
Another account claims that the camel case style first became popular at [[Xerox PARC]] around 1978, with the [[Mesa programming language]] developed for the [[Xerox Alto]] computer.  This machine lacked an underscore key and the hyphen and space characters were not permitted in identifiers, leaving CamelCase as the only viable scheme for readable multiword names.  The PARC Mesa Language Manual (1979) included a coding standard with specific rules for Upper-  and lowerCamelCase which was strictly followed by the Mesa libraries and the Alto operating system.

The [[Smalltalk]] language, which was developed originally on the Alto and became quite popular in the early 1980s, may have been instrumental in spreading the style outside PARC.  Camel case was also used by convention for many names in the [[PostScript]] page description language (invented by [[Adobe Systems]] founder and ex-PARC scientist [[John Warnock]]), as well as for the language itself.  A further boost was provided by [[Niklaus Wirth]] (the inventor of [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]) who acquired a taste for camel case during a sabbatical at PARC and used it in [[Modula]], his next programming language.

===Spread to mainstream usage===
Whatever its origins within the computing world, camel case spread to a wider audience in the 1980s and 1990s, when the advent of the [[personal computer]] exposed [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker culture]] to the world.  Camel case then became [[fashion]]able for corporate [[trade name]]s, first in computer-related fields but later expanding further into the mainstream. Examples ranging from the 1970s to the 2000s give a history of the spread of the usage:

&lt;!-- limit to two or three per year, esp. after 1990 where they're just too common; aim for showing different industries, usages; the second or third product by a company which has already used camel case (i.e., MacBook) is unlikely to be notable.  Again, this is a documentation of new usages, not a complete list of all CamelCase products which would be unencyclopedic --&gt;

During the [[dot-com bubble]] of the late 1990s, the lowercase prefixes &quot;e&quot; (for &quot;[[electronics|electronic]]&quot;) and &quot;i&quot; (for &quot;[[Internet]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Farhad Manjoo |url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2002/04/52181 |title=Grads Want to Study on EMacs, Too |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[information]]&quot;, &quot;[[intelligent]]&quot;, etc.) became quite common, giving rise to some camel case names like [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iMac]] and the [[Zentyal|eBox]] software platform.

In 1998, Dave Yost suggested that chemists use medial capitals to aid readability of long chemical names, e.g. write AmidoPhosphoRibosylTransferase instead of [[amidophosphoribosyltransferase]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15821399.900-feedback.html ''Feedback, 20 June 1998''] Vol 158 No 2139 [[New Scientist]] 20 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

This practice is sometimes given to the abbreviated names of certain neighborhoods, particularly New York City neighborhoods, such as ''SoHo'' (''So''uth of ''Ho''uston Street) and ''TriBeCa'' (''Tri''angle ''Be''low ''Ca''nal Street). CamelCase is not always used and the neighborhoods are instead rendered as ''Soho'' and ''Tribeca''.

===History of the name &quot;camel case&quot;===
The original name of the practice, used in [[media studies]], [[grammar]]s and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', was &quot;medial capitals&quot;. The fancier names such as &quot;InterCaps&quot;, &quot;CamelCase&quot; and variations thereof are relatively recent and seem more common in computer-related communities.

The earliest known occurrence of the term &quot;InterCaps&quot; on Usenet is in an April 1990 post to the group &lt;tt&gt;alt.folklore.computers&lt;/tt&gt; by Avi Rappoport,&lt;ref name=&quot;compoundNames&quot; /&gt; with &quot;BiCapitalization&quot; appearing slightly later in a 1991 post  by [[Eric S. Raymond]] to the same group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/misc.misc/msg/f5f25b79cd9026bd |title=The jargon file version 2.5.1 29 January 1991 follows in 15 parts - misc.misc &amp;#124; Google Groups |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest use of the name &quot;CamelCase&quot; occurs in 1995, in a post by [[Newton Love]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Newton Love &amp;nbsp; View profile &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;More options |url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.os2.advocacy/msg/ab3c8107c6e150fa |title=I'm happy again! - comp.os.os2.advocacy &amp;#124; Google Groups |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;''With the advent of programming languages having these sorts of constructs, the humpiness of the style made me call it HumpyCase at first, before I settled on CamelCase. I had been calling it CamelCase for years,''&quot; said Love, &quot;''The citation above was just the first time I had used the name on USENET.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sluug.org/~newt/ Newton Love]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name &quot;CamelCase&quot; is not related to the &quot;Camel Book&quot; (''[[Programming Perl]]''), which uses all-lowercase identifiers with [[underscore]]s in its sample code.

==Current usage in computing==
=== Programming and coding ===
The use of medial caps for compound identifiers is recommended by the [[coding style]] guidelines of many organizations or software projects.  For some languages (such as [[Mesa (programming language)|Mesa]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Modula]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Google Summer of Code|Google SOC]]'s [[Python (programming language)|Python]] recommendations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/soc/wiki/PythonStyleGuide#Naming |title=PythonStyleGuide - soc - Style guide for Python code contributed to Melange - Project Hosting on Google Code |publisher=Code.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]]) this practice is recommended by the language developers or by authoritative manuals and has therefore become part of the language's &quot;culture&quot;. (Note that Google's SOC is a project rather than a language - the use of CamelCase is not standardised by the Python language and much Python code makes use of underscores to delimit variable names).

Style guidelines often distinguish between upper and lower camel case, typically specifying which variety should be used for specific kinds of entities: [[variable (computer science)|variable]]s, [[field (computer science)|record fields]], [[method (computer science)|method]]s, [[procedure (computer science)|procedures]], [[type (computer science)|types]], etc. These rules are sometimes supported by [[static code analysis|static analysis]] tools that check source code for adherence.

The original [[Hungarian notation]] for programming, for example, specifies that a lowercase abbreviation for the &quot;usage type&quot; (not data type) should prefix all variable names, with the remainder of the name in upper camel case; as such it is a form of lower camel case.

Programming identifiers often need to contain [[acronyms and initialisms]] which are already in upper case, such as &quot;old HTML file&quot;. By analogy with the title case rules, the natural camel case rendering would have the abbreviation all in upper case, namely &quot;oldHTMLFile&quot;.  However, this approach is problematic when two acronyms occur together (e.g., &quot;parse DBM XML&quot; would become &quot;parseDBMXML&quot;) or when the standard mandates lower camel case but the name begins with an abbreviation (e.g. &quot;SQL server&quot; would become &quot;sQLServer&quot;).  For this reason, some programmers prefer to treat abbreviations as if they were lower case words and write &quot;oldHtmlFile&quot;, &quot;parseDbmXml&quot; or &quot;sqlServer&quot;.

Camel case is by no means universal in computing.  In some programming languages, notably [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] and [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], compound names are usually separated by hyphens, which are claimed to be more readable and more convenient to type.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Wiki link markup===
Camel case is used in some [[wikitext|wiki markup languages]] for terms that should be automatically linked to other [[wiki]] pages. This convention was originally used in [[Ward Cunningham]]'s original [[wiki software]], the [[WikiWikiWeb]] and is still used by some other wikis, such as [[FosWiki]], [[JSPWiki]], [[TiddlyWiki]], [[Trac]] and [[PMWiki]].  [[Wikipedia]] formerly used camel case linking as well, but switched to explicit link markup using [[square brackets]] and many other wiki sites have done the same. Some wikis which use a different link markup by default have an option (sometimes with a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]]) to enable camel case links. Some wikis which do not use camel case linking may still use the camel case as a naming convention, such as [[AboutUs]].

===Other uses===
The [[National Information Exchange Model|NIEM]] registry requires that [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] data elements use upper camel case and XML attributes use lower camel case.

Camel case is also the official convention for file names in Java and for the [[Amiga]] personal computer.&lt;!--Are these upper or lower CamelCase?--&gt;

Most popular [[shell (computing)|command-line interfaces]] and [[shell script|scripting]] languages cannot easily handle file names that contain embedded spaces (usually requiring the name to be put in quotes).  Therefore, users of those systems often resort to camel case (or underscores, hyphens and other &quot;safe&quot; characters) for compound file names like &lt;tt&gt;MyJobResume.pdf&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Current usage in natural languages==
CamelCase has been used in languages other than [[English language|English]] for a variety of purposes, including the ones below:

===Orthographic markings===
Camel case is sometimes used in the transcription of certain scripts, to differentiate letters or markings.  An example is the rendering of [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]] proper names like ''rLobsang'': the &quot;r&quot; here stands for a prefix glyph in the original script that functions as [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] marker rather than a normal letter.  Another example is ''tsIurku'', a Latin transcription of the [[Chechen language|Chechen]] term for the capping stone of the characteristic [[Vainakh medieval towers|Medieval defensive towers]] of [[Chechenia]] and [[Ingushetia]]; the capital letter &quot;I&quot; here denoting a [[phoneme]] distinct from the one transcribed as &quot;i&quot;.

===Inflection prefixes===
Camel case may also be used when writing proper names in languages that inflect words by attaching prefixes to them.  In some of those languages, the custom is to leave the prefix in lower case and capitalize the root.

This convention is used in [[Irish orthography]] as well as [[Scottish Gaelic alphabet|Scots Gaelic orthography]]; e.g., {{lang|ga|''i nGaillimh''}} (&quot;in [[Galway]]&quot;), from {{lang|ga|''Gaillimh''}} (&quot;Galway&quot;);  {{lang|ga|''an tAlbanach''}} (&quot;the [[Scottish people|Scottish person]]&quot;), from {{lang|ga|''Albanach''}} (&quot;Scottish person&quot;); {{lang|ga|''go hÉireann''}} (&quot;to [[Ireland]]&quot;), from {{lang|ga|''Éire''}} (&quot;Ireland).

Similarly, in transliteration of the [[Hebrew language]], ''haIvrit'' means &quot;the Hebrew person&quot; and ''biYerushalayim'' means &quot;in Jerusalem&quot;.

This convention is also used by several [[Bantu languages]] (e.g., ''kiSwahili'' = &quot;[[Swahili language]]&quot;, ''isiZulu''  = &quot;[[Zulu language]]&quot;) and several indigenous [[languages of Mexico]] (e.g. [[Nahuatl languages|Nahuatl]], [[Totonacan languages|Totonacan]], [[Mixe-Zoque languages|Mixe-Zoque]] and some [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] languages).

===In abbreviations and acronyms===
Abbreviations of some academic qualifications are sometimes presented in CamelCase without punctuation, e.g. [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] or [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]].

In [[French language|French]], CamelCase acronyms such as [[Oulipo|OuLiPo]] (1960) were favored for a time as alternatives to initialisms.

CamelCase is often used to transliterate initialisms into alphabets  where two letters may be required to represent a single character of the original alphabet, e.g., [[DShK]] from [[Cyrillic]] ДШК. &lt;!-- Need a real example for the following: In [[Japan]], CamelCase is sometimes used when transliterating [[Hiragana]] or [[Katakana]] product names or initialisms into Roman alphabet. --&gt;

===Honorifics within compound words===
In several languages, including English, [[pronoun]]s and [[possessive]]s may be capitalized to indicate respect, e.g., when referring to the reader of a formal letter or to [[God]].  In some of those languages, the capitalization is customarily retained even when those words occur within compound words or [[enclitic|suffixed to a verb]].  For example, in [[Italian language|Italian]] one would write {{lang|it|''porgendoLe distinti saluti''}} (&quot;offering to You respectful salutations&quot;) or {{lang|it|''adorarLo''}} (&quot;adore Him&quot;).

===Other uses===
In [[German language|German]], all nouns carry a [[grammatical gender]]—which, for roles or job titles, is usually masculine.  Since the [[feminist movement]] of the 1980s, some writers and publishers have been using the feminine title suffixes ''-in'' ([[grammatical number|singular]]) and ''-innen'' (plural) to emphasize the inclusion of females; but written with a capital 'I', to indicate that males are not excluded.  Example: {{lang|de|''MitarbeiterInnen''}} (&quot;co-workers, &lt;nowiki&gt;male or&lt;/nowiki&gt; female&quot;) instead of {{lang|de|''Mitarbeiter''}} (&quot;co-workers&quot;, masculine grammatical gender) or {{lang|de|''Mitarbeiterinnen'''}} (&quot;female co-workers&quot;).  This use is analogous to the use of [[parentheses]] in English, for example in the phrase &quot;congress(wo)man.&quot;

In German, the names to statutes are also abbreviated using embedded capitals, e.g. StGB (Strafgesetzbuch) for criminal code and PatG (Patentgesetz) for Patent Act.

[[File:Various grains.jpg|thumb|250px|Oats, barley, and some food products made from cereal grains.]]

'''Cereals''', '''grains''', or '''cereal grains''' are [[Poaceae|grasses]] (members of the [[Monocotyledon|monocot]] families [[Poaceae|Poaceae or Gramineae]])&lt;ref&gt;The seeds of several other plants, such as [[buckwheat]], are also used in the same manner as grains, but since they are not grasses they cannot strictly be called such&lt;/ref&gt; cultivated for the edible components of their fruit seeds (botanically, a type of [[fruit]] called a [[caryopsis]]): the [[endosperm]], [[cereal germ|germ]], and [[bran]]. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop; they are therefore [[staple food|staple crops]].

In their natural form (as in ''[[whole grain]]''), they are a rich source of [[vitamins]], [[minerals]], [[carbohydrates]], [[fat]]s, oils, and [[protein]]. However, when refined by the removal of the [[bran]] and [[cereal germ|germ]], the remaining [[endosperm]] is mostly [[carbohydrate]] and lacks the majority of the other nutrients. In some [[developing nation]]s, grain in the form of [[rice]], [[wheat]], millet, or [[maize]] constitutes a majority of daily sustenance. In [[developed nations]], cereal consumption is  moderate and varied but still substantial. 

The word ''cereal'' derives from ''[[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]]'', the name of the Roman goddess of harvest and agriculture.

==History==
The first cereal grains were [[domesticated]] about 12,000 years ago by ancient farming communities in the [[Fertile Crescent]] region of [[southwest Asia]]. [[Emmer|Emmer wheat]], [[einkorn wheat]], and [[barley]] were three of the so-called [[Neolithic founder crops]] in the development of [[agriculture]].

==Production==
The following table shows annual production of cereals, in 1961,&lt;ref&gt;1961 is the earliest year for which [[FAO]] statistics are available.&lt;/ref&gt; 2005, 2006, and 2007 ranked by 2007 production.&lt;ref name=&quot;prodstat&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx | title=ProdSTAT | work=FAOSTAT | accessdate=2006-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; All but [[buckwheat]] and [[quinoa]] are true grasses (these two are '''[[pseudocereal]]s''').

Maize, wheat and rice together accounted for 87% of all grain production worldwide, and 43% of all food calories in 2003,&lt;ref name=&quot;prodstat&quot;/&gt; while the production of oats and rye have drastically fallen from their 1960s levels. 
Other grains that are important in some places, but that have little production globally (and are not included in [[FAO]] statistics), include:

* [[Teff]], popular in [[Ethiopia]] but scarcely known elsewhere. This ancient grain is a staple in Ethiopia. It is high in fiber and protein. Its flour is often used to make [[injera]]. It can also be eaten as a warm breakfast cereal similar to [[farina (food)|farina]] with a chocolate or nutty flavor. Its flour and whole grain products can usually be found in natural foods stores.
* [[Wild rice]], grown in small amounts in North America
* [[Amaranth grain|Amaranth]], ancient pseudocereal, formerly a staple crop of the [[Aztec Empire]] and now widely grown in Africa
* [[Kañiwa]], close relative of [[quinoa]]

Several other species of wheat have also been domesticated, some very early in the history of agriculture:

* [[Spelt]], a close relative of common wheat
* [[Einkorn]], a wheat species with a single grain
* [[Emmer]], one of the first crops domesticated in the [[Fertile Crescent]]
* [[Durum]], the only [[tetraploid]] species of wheat currently cultivated, used to make [[semolina]]

== Farming ==
[[File:040719 172 dorset marnhull.jpg|thumb|220px|A wheat field in [[Dorset]], England.]]
While each individual species has its own peculiarities, the cultivation of all cereal crops is similar. All are [[annual plant]]s; consequently one planting yields one harvest. Wheat, rye, triticale, oats, barley, and spelt are the &quot;cool-season&quot; cereals.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} These are hardy plants that grow well in moderate weather and cease to grow in hot weather (approximately 30 °C but this varies by species and variety). The &quot;warm-season&quot; cereals are tender and prefer hot weather. Barley and rye are the hardiest cereals, able to overwinter in the [[subarctic]] and [[Siberia]]. Many cool-season cereals are grown in the tropics. However, some are only grown in cooler highlands, where it may be possible to grow multiple crops in a year.

=== Planting ===
The warm-season cereals are grown in tropical lowlands year-round and in temperate climates during the frost-free season. Rice is commonly grown in flooded fields, though some strains are grown on dry land. Other warm climate cereals, such as [[sorghum]], are adapted to arid conditions. 

Cool-season cereals are well-adapted to temperate climates. Most varieties of a particular species are either '''winter''' or '''spring''' types. Winter varieties are sown in the autumn, germinate and grow vegetatively, then become [[dormancy|dormant]] during winter. They resume growing in the springtime and mature in late spring or early summer. This cultivation system makes optimal use of water and frees the land for another crop early in the growing season. 

Winter varieties do not flower until springtime because they require [[vernalization]]: exposure to low temperature for a genetically determined length of time. Where winters are too warm for vernalization or exceed the hardiness of the crop (which varies by species and variety), farmers grow spring varieties. Spring cereals are planted in early springtime and mature later that same summer, without vernalization. Spring cereals typically require more irrigation and yield less than winter cereals.
[[Image:3-piantagione,Taccuino Sanitatis, Casanatense 4182..jpg|thumb|180px|Threshing; ''Tacuinum Sanitatis'', 14th century.]]

=== Period ===
Once the cereal plants have grown their seeds, they have completed their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. The plants die and become brown and dry. As soon as the parent plants and their seed kernels are reasonably dry, harvest can begin.

In developed countries, cereal crops are universally machine-harvested, typically using a [[combine harvester]], which cuts, [[threshing|threshes]], and [[winnowing|winnows]] the grain during a single pass across the field. In developing countries, a variety of harvesting methods are in use, depending on the cost of labor, from combines to hand tools such as the [[scythe]] or [[cradle (grain)|cradle]].

If a crop is harvested during wet weather, the grain may not dry adequately in the field to prevent spoilage during its storage. In this case, the grain is sent to a dehydrating facility, where artificial heat dries it.

In North America, farmers commonly deliver their newly harvested grain to a [[grain elevator]], a large storage facility that consolidates the crops of many farmers. The farmer may sell the grain at the time of delivery or maintain ownership of a share of grain in the pool for later sale.
Storage facilities should be protected from small grain pests, rodents and birds.

== Nutritional facts ==
Some grains are deficient in the [[essential amino acid]] [[lysine]]. That is why a multitude of vegetarian cultures, in order to get a balanced diet, combine their diet of grains with [[legumes]]. Many legumes, on the other hand, are deficient in the [[essential amino acid]] [[methionine]], which grains contain. Thus a combination of legumes with [[Food grain|grains]] forms a [[well-balanced]] diet for vegetarians. Common examples of such combinations are [[dal]] (lentils) with [[rice]] by [[South India]]ns and [[Bengali people|Bengalis]], dal with wheat in [[Pakistan]] and [[North India]], and [[beans]] with corn tortillas, [[tofu]] with [[rice]], and [[peanut butter]] with wheat bread (as sandwiches) in several other cultures, including Americans.&lt;ref name= vogel301&gt;Vogel, Steven.

'''Christendom''',&lt;ref name=&quot;MWChristendom&quot; /&gt; or the '''Christian world''',&lt;ref&gt;Marty, Martin E. [http://books.google.com/books?id=MoolUlqQdmAC The Christian World: A Global History]. Modern Library chronicles, 29. New York: Modern Library, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; has several meanings. In a [[Culture|cultural]] sense it refers to the [[cultural community|worldwide community]] of [[Christian]]s, adherents of [[Christianity]]. In a [[History|historical]] or [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] sense the term usually refers collectively to [[Christian majority countries]] or countries in which Christianity dominates&lt;ref name=&quot;MWChristendom&quot;&gt;See [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Christendom Merriam-Webster.com : dictionary, &quot;Christendom&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; or was a territorial phenomenon.

==Terminology and usage==
The term ''Christendom'' is developed from the Latin word ''Christianus''. The ''Christian world'' is also known collectively as the '''''Corpus Christianum'''''. The Latin term ''Corpus Christianum'' is often translated as ''the Christian body'', meaning the community of all Christians. The Christian polity, embodying a less secular meaning, can be compatible with the idea of both a religious and a temporal body: ''Corpus Christianum''. The ''Corpus Christianum'' can be seen as a Christian equivalent of the Muslim ''[[Ummah]]''. The ''[[Kingdom of God]]'' is also frequently used, denoting that the Christian world is within (or among) people.&lt;ref&gt;Kingdom is within: &quot;The kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, ‘See here!’ or ‘See there!’ For indeed, the kingdom of God is within [or among] you.&quot; {{bibleverse||Luke|17:20-21|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Christendom&quot; is used in this article to denote the [[community|global community]] of Biblical Christianity. Christendom as such is set on the appellation of [[religious|religious aspect]]s. However, the word is also used with its other meaning to [[Framing (social sciences)|frame-true Christianity]]. A more secular meaning can denote that the term ''Christendom'' refers to Christians considered as a group, the &quot;'''Political Christian World'''&quot;, as an informal [[cultural hegemony]] that Christianity has traditionally enjoyed in the [[Western world|West]].

==History==
{{Main|Christian history}}

===Early Christendom===
{{Main|Early Christianity|Hebrew Gospel}}
[[Image:T and O map Guntherus Ziner 1472.jpg|thumb|This [[T-and-O map]], which abstracts the then known world to a cross inscribed within an orb, remakes geography in the service of Christian iconography. More detailed versions place [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] at the center of the world.]]

In the beginning of Christendom, early Christianity was a religion spread in the Greek/Roman world and beyond as a 1st century [[Judaism|Jewish]] sect,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Acts|3:1}}; {{bibleref|Acts|5:27–42}}; {{bibleref|Acts|21:18–26}}; {{bibleref|Acts|24:5}}; {{bibleref|Acts|24:14}}; {{bibleref|Acts|28:22}}; {{bibleref|Romans|1:16}}; Tacitus, ''Annales'' xv 44; Josephus ''Antiquities'' xviii 3; Mortimer Chambers, ''The Western Experience Volume II'' chapter 5; ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion'' page 158.&lt;/ref&gt; which historians refer to as [[Jewish Christianity]]. It may be divided into two distinct phases: the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic period]], when the first apostles were alive and organising the Church, and the [[post-apostolic period]], when an early [[Historical episcopate|episcopal structure]] developed, whereby bishoprics were governed by [[bishops]] (overseers).

The post-apostolic period concerns the time roughly after the death of the apostles when bishops emerged as overseers of urban Christian populations. The earliest recorded use of the terms ''[[Christianity]]'' (Greek {{polytonic|Χριστιανισμός}}) and ''[[Catholic]]'' (Greek {{polytonic|καθολικός}}), dates to this period, the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], attributed to [[Ignatius of Antioch]] ''c.'' 107.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Bauer, ''Greek-English Lexicon''; [[Ignatius of Antioch]] [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/ignatius-magnesians-roberts.html Letter to the Magnesians] 10, Letter to the Romans ([http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-01/anf01–19.htm#P1838_311890 Roberts-Donaldson tr.], [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/ignatius-romans-lightfoot.html Lightfoot tr.], [http://www.ccel.org/l/lake/fathers/ignatius-romans.htm Greek text]). However, an [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/ignatius-romans-roberts.html edition] presented on some websites, one that otherwise corresponds exactly with the Roberts-Donaldson translation, renders this passage to the interpolated inauthentic longer recension of Ignatius's letters, which does not contain the word &quot;Christianity.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Early Christendom would close at the end of [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|imperial persecution of Christians]] after the ascension of [[Constantine the Great]] and the [[Edict of Milan]] in AD&amp;nbsp;313 and the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325.

===Middle Christendom===
{{Main|First seven Ecumenical Councils}}
{{See also|State church of the Roman Empire}}

&quot;Christendom&quot; has referred to the [[medieval]] and [[renaissance]] notion of the ''Christian world'' as a [[sociopolitical]] [[polity]]. In essence, the earliest vision of Christendom was a vision of a Christian [[theocracy]], a [[government]] founded upon and upholding [[Christian values]], whose institutions are spread through and over with [[Christian doctrine]]. In this period, members of the Christian [[clergy]] wield [[political authority]]. The specific relationship between the [[political leader]]s and the clergy varied but, in theory, the national and political divisions were at times subsumed under the leadership of the [[Christian Church|church as an institution]]. This model of church-state relations was accepted by various [[Church hierarchy|Church leader]]s and political leaders throughout much of European history.

[[File:Nicaea icon.jpg|thumb|Icon depicting [[Constantine I|the Emperor Constantine]] and the [[bishop]]s of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) holding the [[Nicene Creed#The Niceno–Constantinopolitan Creed of 381|Niceno–Constantinopolitan Creed of 381]].]]

[[Emperor Constantine]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 proclaiming toleration for the Christian religion, and [[convoke]]d the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 whose [[Nicene Creed]] included belief in &quot;one holy catholic and apostolic Church&quot;. [[State church of the Roman Empire|Christianity became the state religion of the Empire]] in 392 when [[Emperor Theodosius|Theodosius I]] prohibited the practice of [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan religions]] with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]]. The Church gradually became a defining institution of the Empire.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

As the [[Western Roman Empire]] [[Decline of the Roman Empire|disintegrated]] into [[feudalism|feudal kingdom]]s and [[principalities]], the concept of Christendom changed as the western church became independent of the Emperor and the Christians of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. The [[Byzantine Empire]] came to see themselves as the last bastion of Christendom. Christendom would take a turn with the rise of the [[Franks]], a Germanic tribe who converted to the Christian faith and entered into [[communion with Rome]]. On Christmas Day 800 AD, [[Pope Leo III]] made the fateful decision to switch his allegiance from the emperors in [[Constantinople]] and crowned [[Charlemagne]], the king of the Franks, as the Emperor of what came to be known as the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. This empire created an alternative definition of ''Christendom'' in contrast to the Byzantine Empire. The question of what constituted ''true Christendom'' would occupy political and religious leaders up into the [[modern era]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

After the [[collapse of Charlemagne's empire]], the southern remnants of the Holy Roman Empire became a collection of [[papal states|states loosely connected]] to the [[Holy See|Holy See of Rome]]. Tensions between [[Pope Innocent III]] and secular rulers ran high, as the pontiff exerted control over their temporal counterparts in the west and vice versa. The pontificate of Innocent III is considered the height of temporal power of the papacy. The ''Corpus Christianum'' described the then current notion of the [[community]] of all [[Christian]]s united under the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. This community was to be guided by Christian values in its politics, economics and social life. Its legal basis was the ''[[Canon Law|corpus iuris canonica]]'' (body of canon law).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In the East, Christendom became more defined as the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s gradual loss of territory to an [[Muslim conquests|expanding Islam]] and the [[muslim conquest of Persia]]. This caused Christianity to become important to the Byzantine identity. After the [[East-West Schism]] which divided the Church religiously, there had been the notion of a ''universal Christendom'' that included the East and the West. The Byzantines divided themselves in the [[Byzantine rite]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|eastern rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. The political reunion with the west, after the East-West schism, was put asunder by the [[Fourth Crusade]] when [[Crusades|Crusaders]] [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|conquered the Byzantine capital of Constantinople]] and hastened the [[decline of the Byzantine Empire]] on the [[Byzantine–Ottoman Wars|path to its destruction]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} With the breakup of the Byzantine Empire into individual nations with nationalist Orthodox Churches, the term Christendom described Western Europe, Catholicism, Orthodox Byzantines, and other Eastern rites of the Church.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Late Christendom===
The [[Catholic Church]]'s peak of authority over all European Christians and their common endeavours of the Christian community — for example, the [[Crusades]], the fight against the [[Moors]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and against the [[Ottomans]] in the [[Balkans]] — helped to develop a sense of communal identity against the obstacle of Europe's deep political divisions. But this authority was also sometimes abused, and fostered the [[Inquisition]] and [[Anti-Judaism|anti-Jewish]] [[pogroms]], to root out divergent elements and create a religiously uniform community. Ultimately, the Inquisition was dissolved by order of the Pope.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[File:Grand schisme 1378-1417.svg|thumb|right|Historical map of the [[Western Schism]]: red is support for Avignon, blue for Rome]]
Christendom ultimately was led into specific crisis in the [[late Middle Ages]], when the [[monarch|kings]] of France managed to establish a French national church during the 14th century and the papacy became ever more aligned with the [[Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]]. Known as the [[Western Schism]], western Christendom was a split between three men, who were driven by politics rather than any real theological disagreement for simultaneously claiming to be the true pope. The [[Avignon Papacy]] developed a reputation of corruption that estranged major parts of Western Christendom. The schism was ended by the [[Council of Constance]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Before the modern period, Christendom was in a general crisis at the time of the [[Renaissance Papacy|Renaissance Popes]] because of the moral laxity of these pontiffs and their willingness to seek and rely on temporal power as secular rulers did. Many in the Catholic Church's hierarchy in the Renaissance became increasingly entangled with insatiable greed for material wealth and temporal power, which led to many reform movements, some merely wanting a moral reformation of the Church's clergy, while others repudiated the Church and separated from it in order to form new sects. The [[Italian Renaissance]] produced ideas or institutions in the by which men living in society could be held together in harmony. In the early 16th century, [[Baldassare Castiglione]] (The [[Book of the Courtier]]) laid out his vision of the ideal gentleman and lady, while [[Machiavelli]] cast a jaundiced eye on &quot;la verita effetuale delle cose&quot; — the actual truth of things — in [[The Prince]], composed, humanist style, chiefly of parallel ancient and modern examples of [[Virtù]]. Some Protestant movements grew up along lines of [[mysticism]] or [[renaissance humanism]] ([[cf]]. [[Erasmus]]). The Catholic Church fell into general neglect under the Renaissance Popes, whose inability to govern the Church properly set the climate for what would ultimately become the Protestant Reformation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the ensuing rise of independent states caused the term &quot;Christendom&quot; to take on a new, more general, meaning in Western Europe, signifying countries which were predominantly Christian (Regardless of whether they were Catholic or Protestant) as opposed to Islamic or [[pagan]] countries. Catholics at the time advocated Christendom's restoration and argued that, with the fragmented nature of Protestantism's many denominations, Christendom could only apply to the civilization of Catholic nations that espoused the doctrine of the Social Reign of [[Christ the King]], and which recognised the Catholic Church. The Catholic nations did represent a large portion of European Christians and the ''Corpus Christianum'' initially was composed of the Christian community of these nations, rather than all Christians worldwide. But developments in western philosophy and European events were critical in the change of the notion of the ''Corpus Christianum''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The [[Hundred Years' War]] accelerated the process of transforming France from a feudal monarchy to a centralized state. The rise of [[Absolutism (European history)|strong, centralized monarchies]]&lt;ref&gt;This was presaging the modern [[nation-state]]&lt;/ref&gt; denoted the European transition from [[feudalism]] to [[capitalism]]. By the end of the Hundred Years' War, both France and England were able to raise enough money through taxation to create independent standing armies. In the [[Wars of the Roses]], [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] took the crown of [[England]]. His heir, the [[Absolutism (European history)|absolute]] king [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] establishing the [[Church of England|English church]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Art and literature===
====Writings and poetry====
{{Main|Christian literature|Christian poetry}}
[[Christian literature]] is writing that deals with Christian themes and incorporates the Christian world view. This constitutes a huge body of extremely varied writing. [[Christian poetry]] is any [[poetry]] that contains [[Christianity|Christian]] teachings, themes, or references. The influence of Christianity on poetry has been great in any area that Christianity has taken hold. Christian poems often directly reference the [[Bible]], while others provide [[allegory]].

====Supplemental arts====
{{Main|Christian art}}
[[Christian art]] is art produced in an attempt to illustrate, supplement and portray in tangible form the principles of Christianity. Virtually all Christian groupings use or have used art to some extent. The prominence of art and the media, style, and representations change; however, the unifying theme is ultimately the representation of the life and times of [[Jesus]] and in some cases the [[Old Testament]]. Depictions of saints are also common, especially in [[Anglicanism]], [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]].

====Illumination====
{{Main|Illuminated manuscript}}

[[File:Codex Bruchsal 1 01v cropped.jpg|thumb|Picture of [[Christ in Majesty]] contained in an illuminated manuscript.]]
An [[illuminated manuscript]] is a [[manuscript]] in which the [[Writing|text]] is supplemented by the addition of decoration. The earliest surviving substantive illuminated manuscripts are from the period AD 400 to 600, primarily produced in [[Ireland]], [[Constantinople]] and [[Italy]]. The majority of surviving manuscripts are from the [[Middle Ages]], although many illuminated manuscripts survive from the 15th century [[Renaissance]], along with a very limited number from [[Late Antiquity]].

Most illuminated manuscripts were created as [[codex|codices]], which had superseded scrolls; some isolated single sheets survive. A very few illuminated manuscript fragments survive on [[papyrus]]. Most medieval manuscripts, illuminated or not, were written on [[parchment]] (most commonly of [[calfskin|calf]], sheep, or goat skin), but most manuscripts important enough to illuminate were written on the best quality of parchment, called [[vellum]], traditionally made of unsplit [[calfskin]], though high quality parchment from other skins was also called ''parchment''.

====Iconography====
{{Main|Iconoclasm|Religious image|Christian icons|Christian symbolism}}
[[Image:St. Theodor.jpg|thumb|There are few old ceramic icons, such as this [[St. Theodor]] icon which dates to ca. 900 (from [[Preslav]], [[Bulgaria]]).]]
Christian art began, about two centuries after Christ, by borrowing motifs from Roman Imperial imagery, classical Greek and Roman religion and popular art. [[Religious images]] are used to some extent by the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] Christian faith, and often contain highly complex iconography, which reflects centuries of accumulated tradition. In the [[Late Antique]] period iconography began to be standardised, and to relate more closely to [[Biblical]] texts, although many gaps in the [[canonical Gospel]] narratives were plugged with matter from the [[apocrypha|apocryphal gospels]]. Eventually the Church would succeed in weeding most of these out, but some remain, like the ox and ass in the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]].

An [[icon]] is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, from [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] or one of the [[Eastern Catholic Church|Eastern Rites of the Catholic Church]]. Christianity has used [[Christian symbolism|symbolism]] from its very beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Encyclopedia'', [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14373b.htm article '''Symbolism''']&lt;/ref&gt; In both East and West, numerous iconic types of [[Christ]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and saints and other subjects were developed; the number of named types of icons of Mary, with or without the infant Christ, was especially large in the East, whereas [[Christ Pantocrator]] was much the commonest image of Christ.

[[Christian symbolism]] invests objects or actions with an inner meaning expressing Christian ideas. [[Christianity]] has borrowed from the common stock of significant symbols known to most periods and to all regions of the world. [[Religious symbolism]] is effective when it appeals to both the intellect and the emotions. Especially important depictions of Mary include the [[Hodegetria]] and [[Panagia]] types. Traditional models evolved for narrative paintings, including large cycles covering the events of the Life of Christ, the [[Life of the Virgin]], parts of the Old Testament, and, increasingly, the lives of popular [[saint]]s. Especially in the West, a system of [[emblem|attributes]] developed for [[Saint symbology|identifying individual]] figures of saints by a standard appearance and symbolic objects held by them; in the East they were more likely to identified by text labels.

Each [[saint]] has a story and a reason why he or she led an exemplary life. Symbols have been used to tell these stories throughout the history of the Church. A number of Christian [[saint]]s are traditionally represented by a symbol or [[Icon|iconic motif]] associated with their life, termed an attribute or [[emblem]], in order to identify them. The study of these forms part of [[iconography]] in [[Art history]]. They were particularly

====Architecture====
{{Main|Christian architecture}}

[[Image:Gotic3d2.jpg|thumb|The structure of a typical Gothic cathedral.]]
[[Christian architecture]] encompasses a wide range of both secular and religious styles from the foundation of Christianity to the present day, influencing the design and construction of buildings and structures in Christian culture.

Buildings were at first adapted from those originally intended for other purposes but, with the rise of distinctively ecclesiastical architecture, church buildings came to influence secular ones which have often imitated religious architecture. In the 20th century, the use of new materials, such as concrete, as well as simpler styles has had its effect upon the design of churches and arguably the flow of influence has been reversed. From the birth of Christianity to the present, the most significant period of transformation for Christian architecture in the west was the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedral]]. In the east, [[Byzantine architecture]] was a continuation of [[Roman architecture]].

=== Philosophy ===
{{Main|Christian philosophy|Scholasticism}}

[[Christian philosophy]] is a term to describe the fusion of various fields of [[philosophy]] with the [[Theology|theological]] doctrines of Christianity. [[Scholasticism]], which means &quot;that [which] belongs to the school&quot;, and was a method of learning taught by the [[academics]] (or ''school people'') of medieval [[university|universities]] c. 1100–1500. Scholasticism originally started to reconcile the [[philosophy]] of the ancient classical philosophers with medieval Christian theology. Scholasticism is not a philosophy or theology in itself but a tool and method for learning which places emphasis on [[dialectical reasoning]].

==Christian civilization==

[[Image:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|[[Science]], and particularly [[geometry]] and [[astronomy]], was linked directly to the divine for most medieval scholars. Since God created the universe after geometric and harmonic principles, to seek these principles was therefore to seek and worship God.]]

=== Medieval conditions ===
{{Main|Medieval science|Medieval technology}}
The [[Byzantine Empire]], which was the most sophisticated culture during antiquity, suffered under [[muslim conquests]] limiting its scientific prowess during the Medieval period. Christian [[Western Europe]] had suffered a catastrophic loss of knowledge following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. But thanks to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] scholars such as [[Aquinas]] and [[Buridan]], the West carried on at least the spirit of scientific inquiry which would later lead to Europe's taking the lead in science during the [[Scientific Revolution]] using [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translations of medieval works]].

[[Medieval technology]] refers to the technology used in medieval Europe under Christian rule. After the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], medieval Europe saw a radical change in the rate of new inventions, innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production, and economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Crosby described some of this technological revolution in his ''The Measure of Reality : Quantification in Western Europe, 1250–1600'' and other major historians of technology have also noted it.&lt;/ref&gt; The period saw major [[technology|technological]] advances, including the adoption of [[gunpowder]] and the [[astrolabe]], the invention of [[spectacles]], and greatly improved [[water mill]]s, building techniques, [[agriculture]] in general, [[clock]]s, and [[ship]]s. The latter advances made possible the dawn of the [[Age of Exploration]]. The development of water mills was impressive, and extended from agriculture to [[sawmill]]s both for timber and stone, probably derived from [[Roman technology]]. By the time of the [[Domesday Book]], most large villages in [[Great Britain|Britain]] had mills. They also were widely used in [[mining]], as described by [[Georg Agricola]] in [[De Re Metallica]] for raising ore from shafts, crushing ore, and even powering [[bellows]].

Significant in this respect were advances within the fields of [[navigation]]. The [[compass]] and [[astrolabe]] along with advances in shipbuilding, enabled the navigation of the [[Ocean|World Oceans]] and thus domination of the worlds economic trade. [[Johann Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]’s [[printing press]] made possible a dissemination of knowledge to a wider population, that would not only lead to a gradually more egalitarian society, but one more able to dominate other cultures, drawing from a vast reserve of knowledge and experience.

=== Renaissance innovations===
{{Main|History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance technology}}
During the [[Renaissance]], great advances occurred in geography, astronomy, chemistry, physics, math, manufacturing, and engineering.  The rediscovery of ancient scientific texts was accelerated after the Fall of Constantinople, and the invention of [[printing]] which would democratize learning and allow a faster propagation of new ideas. ''[[Renaissance technology]]'' is the set of artifacts and customs, spanning roughly the 14th through the 16th century. The era is marked by such profound technical advancements like the [[printing press]], [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspectivity]], [[patent law]], [[Santa Maria del Fiore|double shell domes]] or [[Bastion fortress]]es. Draw-books of the Renaissance artist-engineers such as [[Taccola]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] give a deep insight into the mechanical technology then known and applied.

[[History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance science]] spawned the [[Scientific Revolution]]; science and technology began a cycle of mutual advancement. The ''Scientific Renaissance'' was the early phase of the Scientific Revolution. In the two-phase model of [[early modern]] science: a ''Scientific Renaissance'' of the 15th and 16th centuries, focused on the restoration of the natural knowledge of the ancients; and a ''Scientific Revolution'' of the 17th century, when scientists shifted from recovery to innovation.

==Modern Christendom==
In [[modern history]], [[the Reformation]] and rise of [[modernity]] in the early 16th century entailed a change in the ''Corpus Christianum''. The [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555 officially ended the idea among secular leaders that all Christians must be united under one church. The principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (&quot;whose the region is, his religion&quot;) established the religious, political and geographic divisions of Christianity, and this was established in [[international law]] with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, which legally ended the concept of a single Christian [[hegemony]], despite the Catholic Church's doctrine that it alone is the one true Church founded by Christ. Subsequently, each government determined the religion of their own state. Christians living in states where their denomination was ''not'' the established one were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will. With the Treaty of Westphalia, the [[European wars of religion|Wars of Religion]] came to an end, and in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 the concept of the [[national sovereignty|sovereign national state]] was born. The ''Corpus Christianum'' has since existed with the modern idea of a tolerant and diverse society consisting of many different communities.

===Notable Christian organizations ===
A [[religious order]] is a lineage of communities and organizations of people who live in some way set apart from society in accordance with their specific religious devotion, usually characterized by the principles of its founder's religious practice. In contrast, the term [[Holy Orders]] is used by many Christian churches to refer to ordination or to a group of individuals who are set apart for a special role or ministry. Historically, the word &quot;order&quot; designated an established civil body or corporation with a hierarchy, and ordinatio meant legal incorporation into an ordo. The word &quot;holy&quot; refers to the Church. In context, therefore, a holy order is set apart for ministry in the Church. Religious orders are composed of initiates (laity) and, in some traditions, ordained clergies.

Various organizations include:
* [[Roman Catholic religious order]]s are the major form of consecrated life in the Roman Catholic Church. They are organisations of laity and/or clergy who live a common life following a religious rule under the leadership of a religious superior. (ed., see [[:Category:Roman Catholic orders and societies]] for a particular listing.)
* [[Anglican religious order]]s are communities of laity and/or clergy in the Anglican Communion who live under a common rule of life. (ed., see [[:Category:Anglican organizations]] for a particular listing)

==Christianity law and ethics==
===Church and state framing===
{{Main|Canon law|Christian ethics}}
Within the framework of Christianity, there are at least three possible definitions for Church law. One is the Torah/Mosaic Law (from what Christians consider to be the [[Old Testament]]) also called [[Divine Law]] or [[Biblical law]]. Another is the instructions of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] in the [[Gospel]] (sometimes referred to as [[the Law of Christ]] or the [[New Commandment]] or the [[New Covenant]]). A third is [[canon law]] which is the internal [[ecclesiastical]] law governing the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches, and the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Communion]] of churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09056a.htm|title=Canon law|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way that such church law is [[legislative power|legislated]], interpreted and at times [[court|adjudicated]] varies widely among these three bodies of churches. In all three traditions, a canon was initially a rule adopted by a [[ecumenical council|council]] (From [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kanon'' / κανών, [[Hebrew]] kaneh / קנה, for rule, standard, or measure); these canons formed the foundation of canon law.

[[Christian ethics]] in general has tended to stress the need for [[divine grace|grace]], [[mercy]], and [[forgiveness]] because of human weakness and developed while [[Early Christians]] were subjects of the [[Roman Empire]]. From the time Nero blamed Christians for setting Rome ablaze (64 AD) until Galarius (311 AD), persecutions against Christians erupted periodically. Consequently, Early Christian ethics included discussions of how believers should relate to Roman authority and to the empire.

Under the [[Constantine I and Christianity|Emperor Constantine I]] (312-337), Christianity became a legal religion. While some scholars debate whether Constantine's conversion to Christianity was authentic or simply matter of political expediency, [[Edict of Milan|Constantine's decree]] made the empire safe for Christian practice and belief. Consequently, issues of Christian doctrine, ethics and church practice were debated openly, see for example the [[First Council of Nicaea]] and the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils]]. By the time of [[Theodosius I]] (379-395), Christianity had become the [[state religion]] of the empire. With Christianity in power, ethical concerns broaden and included discussions of the proper role of the state.

[[Render unto Caesar…]] is the beginning of a phrase attributed to Jesus in the [[synoptic gospel]]s which reads in full, &quot;''Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s''&quot;. This phrase has become a widely quoted summary of the relationship between Christianity and secular authority. The gospels say that when Jesus gave his response, his interrogators &quot;marvelled, and left him, and went their way.&quot; Time has not resolved an ambiguity in this phrase, and people continue to interpret this passage to support various positions that are poles apart. The traditional division, carefully determined, in Christian thought is the [[Sovereign state|state]] and [[Christian Church|church]] have separate [[sphere of influence|spheres of influence]].

[[Thomas Aquinas]] thoroughly discussed that ''human law'' is [[positive law]] which means that it is [[natural law]] applied by governments to societies. All human laws were to be judged by their conformity to the natural law. An unjust law was in a sense no law at all. At this point, the natural law was not only used to pass judgment on the moral worth of various laws, but also to determine what the law said in the first place. This could result in some tension.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, &quot;Aquinas's Two Doctrines of Natural Law.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Hardly a single portion of ethics does Aquinas present to us but is enriched with his keen philosophical commentaries. Late ecclesiastical writers followed in his footsteps.

====Democratic ideology====
{{Main|Christian democracy}}
[[Christian democracy]] is a political ideology that seeks to apply Christian principles to public policy. It emerged in 19th-century Europe, largely under the influence of [[Catholic social teaching]]. In a number of countries, the democracy's Christian ethos has been diluted by [[secularisation]]. In practice, Christian democracy is often considered [[social conservatism|conservative]] on cultural, social and moral issues and [[progressivism|progressive]] on fiscal and economic issues. In places, where their opponents have traditionally been secularist [[socialism|socialists]] and [[social democracy|social democrats]], Christian democratic parties are moderately [[conservatism|conservative]], whereas in other cultural and political environments they can lean to the left.

===Women roles===
{{Main|Women in Christianity}}
Attitudes and beliefs about the roles and responsibilities of [[women in Christianity]] vary considerably today as they have throughout the last two millennia — evolving along with or counter to the societies in which Christians have lived. The Bible and Christianity historically have been interpreted as excluding women from church leadership and placing them in submissive roles in marriage. Male leadership has been assumed in the church and within marriage, society and government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blevins&quot;&gt;Blevins, Carolyn DeArmond, ''Women in Christian History: A Bibliography.'' Macon, Georgia: Mercer Univ Press, 1995. ISBN 086554493X&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary writers describe the role of women in the life of the church as having been downplayed, overlooked, or denied throughout much of Christian history. [[Paradigm shift]]s in gender roles in society and also many churches has inspired reevaluation by many Christians of some long-held attitudes to the contrary. [[Christian egalitarianism|Christian egalitarians]] have increasingly argued for equal roles for men and women in [[Christian views of marriage|marriage]], as well as for the [[ordination of women]] to the [[clergy]]. Contemporary conservatives meanwhile have reasserted what has been termed a &quot;[[Complementarianism|complementarian]]&quot; position, promoting the traditional belief that the [[Bible]] ordains different roles and responsibilities for women and men in the Church and family.

A [[Christian denomination]] is an identifiable religious body under a common name, structure, and doctrine within Christianity. Worldwide, Christians are divided, often along ethnic and linguistic lines, into separate churches and traditions. Various denominations, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses, make particular distinctions in their literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|JW}}While the generally-accepted definition of &quot;Christendom&quot; is sometimes intended, ''[[The Watchtower]]'' and other [[List of Jehovah's Witnesses publications|publications of Jehovah's Witnesses]] more often intend the term to indicate merely ''professed Christianity'' as distinct from ''true Christianity''. Although they self-identify as Christian, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] claim to be no part of &quot;Christendom&quot;. They explain their use of the term:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;What is the definition of “Christendom” as used in Watch Tower publications?&lt;br&gt;Most often the term “Christendom” is used in the Society’s publications in the more restricted way in which the word is first defined in the dictionary: “Christianity”; actually, professed Christianity, in contrast to the true Christianity of the Bible. This focuses primarily on the religious aspects. However, the word is sometimes used in our publications in its enlarged second meaning: “the portion of the world in which Christianity prevails.” (&quot;Questions From Readers&quot;, ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1981, page 31)
&lt;/blockquote&gt; For details, see &quot;True Christianity Is Flourishing&quot;, The Watchtower, March 1, 2004, page 7 [http://www.watchtower.org/e/20040301/article_02.htm As retrieved 2009-04-09], &quot;While Christendom's theologians, missionaries, and churchgoers continue to grapple with the gathering storm of controversy in their churches, true Christianity is flourishing worldwide. Indeed, true Christians [...] invite you to join Jehovah's Witnesses in united Christian worship of the only true God, Jehovah.&quot;; and Watchtower, April 1, 2001, page 18, &quot;Equally striking is the contrast between Jehovah’s Witnesses and Christendom today. [...] The very features that Christendom lacks abound among Jehovah’s Witnesses!&quot;; Also The Watchtower, April 15, 1962, page 229, &quot;It is out of date to define Christendom as meaning Christianity. True Christians today do not confuse Christendom with Christianity or make them identical.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt; Technically, divisions between one group and another are defined by [[Ecclesiology|church doctrine]] and [[church authority]]. Centering on language of ''professed Christianity'' and ''true Christianity'', issues that separate one group of followers of [[Jesus]] from another include:
* [[Apostolic succession]],
* [[Biblical authority]],
* [[Biblical criticism]],
* [[Biblical inerrancy]],
* [[Biblical infallibility]],
* [[Biblical inspiration]],
* [[Biblical interpretation]],
* [[Papal primacy]], and
* [[christian views of Jesus|Views of Jesus]] ([[Christology]]).

Christianity is composed of, but not limited to, five major branches of Churches: [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]]; some groupings include Anglicans amongst Protestants. The [[Assyrian Church of the East]] is also a distinct Christian body, but is much smaller in adherents and geographic scope. Each of these five branches has important subdivisions. Because the Protestant subdivisions do not maintain a common theology or earthly leadership, they are far more distinct than the subdivisions of the other four groupings. ''Denomination'' typically refers to one of the many Christian groupings including each of the multitude of Protestant subdivisions.

==Christendom and other beliefs==
In the interaction between Christendom and other belief systems,&lt;ref&gt;These belief systems include various non-Christian [[life stance]]s, [[world view]]s, [[ideology|ideologies]], [[philosophy|philosophies]], and religions.&lt;/ref&gt; men and women when not at war with their neighbors have always made an effort to understand [[Other|the Other]] (not least because understanding is a strategy for defense, but also because for as long as there is dialogue wars are delayed). Such interactions have led to various [[interfaith dialogue]] events. History records many examples of interfaith initiatives and dialogue throughout the ages. In the field of [[comparative religion]], the interactions connects fundamental ideas in Christianity with similar ones in other religions. [[Christianity and other religions]] appear to share some elements. Regarding Christianity's relationship with other world beliefs, Christianity and other beliefs have differences and similarities in connection with each other.

The declaration [[Nostra Aetate]] officially established inter-religious dialogue between Catholics and Hindus. It has promoted common values between religions. There are over 17.3 million Catholics in India, which represents less than 2% of the total population and is the largest Christian Church within India. However, the Holy See has expressed concern with regards to religious violence in the state of [[Orissa]], which is closely related to the ideology of Hindutva.

[[File:Irreligion map.png|thumb|222px|[[Atheists]], [[agnostics]] and [[nonreligious]], by the Dentsu Institute (2006) and Zuckerman (2005)]]
[[Irreligion]] is an absence of religion, indifference to religion, and/or hostility to religion. [[Secularism]], in one sense, may assert the right to be free from religious rule and teachings and freedom from the imposition of religion upon the people. In its most prominent form, secularism is critical of religious orthodoxy and asserts that religion impedes human progress because of its focus on [[superstition]] and [[dogma]] rather than on [[reason]] and the [[scientific method]]. [[Humanism]] refers to a philosophy centered on humankind. Much of Humanism's life stance upholds human reason, ethics, and justice, and rejects [[supernaturalism]] ([[Christian mythology]]).

==Name==
The name ''coyote'' is [[loanword|borrowed]] from [[Mexican Spanish]], ultimately derived from the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] word ''cóyotl''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/coyote coyote]&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[binomial nomenclature|scientific name]], ''Canis latrans'', means &quot;barking dog&quot; in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.westwildcon.org/library_coyotes.html|title=Coyote (''Canis latrans'')|publisher=Western Wildlife Conservancy|accessdate=November 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary genetic evidence, however, has shown that &quot;coyotes&quot; in some areas are, genetically speaking, 85–90% ''Canis latrans,'' and from 10 to 15% ''Canis lupus,'' along with some domestic dog DNA; this prompted one researcher to suggest, jokingly, that they be called '''''&quot;Canis soupus,&quot;''''' as they are a &quot;soup&quot; (mixture) of canid species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/The-yowl-of-the-suburbs-612669.php#page-2 The yowl of the suburbs].

==Description==
[[File:Coyote portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Coyote profile]]
[[File:Coyoteskull.jpg|thumb|left|Skull]]
The color of the coyote's [[Fur|pelt]] varies from [[Grey|grayish]] [[brown]] to yellowish gray on the upper parts, while the [[throat]] and belly tend to have a buff or white color. The forelegs, sides of the head, muzzle and paws are reddish brown. The back has tawny-colored underfur and long, black-tipped [[guard hair]]s that form a black [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] stripe and a dark cross on the [[shoulder]] area. The black-tipped [[tail]] has a [[scent gland]] located on its dorsal base. Coyotes [[shed]] once a year, beginning in May with light hair loss, ending in July after heavy shedding. The ears are proportionately large in relation to the head, while the [[Foot|feet]] are relatively small in relation to the rest of the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;GJ&quot; /&gt; Certain experts have noted that the shape of a [[Domestication|domestic]] dog's [[Neurocranium|brain case]] is closer to the coyote's in shape than the [[wolf|wolf's]]. [[Mountain]] [[dwelling]] coyotes tend to be dark furred while [[desert]] coyotes tend to be more light brown in color.&lt;ref name=&quot;LC&quot; /&gt;

Coyotes typically grow to up to {{convert|30|-|34|in|cm|abbr=on}} in length, not counting a tail of {{convert|12|-|16|in|cm|abbr=on}}, stand about {{convert|23|-|26|in|cm|abbr=on}} at the shoulder and, on average, weigh from {{convert|15|-|46|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;GJ&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onrc.washington.edu/gis/trail/coyote.ppt&lt;/ref&gt; Northern coyotes are typically larger than southern subspecies, with the largest coyotes on record weighing 74¾ pounds (33.7&amp;nbsp;kg) and measuring over five feet in total length.&lt;ref&gt;[http://replay.web.archive.org/20090418042529/http://home.sou.edu/~rible/wildlife/coyote.html Coyote]&lt;/ref&gt;

The coyote's [[Dentition|dental formula]] is I 3/3, C 1/1, Pm 4/4, M usually 2/2, occasionally 3/3, 3/2, or 2/3 × 2 = 40, 44, or 42&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsrl.ttu.edu/tmot1/canilatr.htm Coyote (Canis latrans)], The Mammals of Texas – Online Edition, Texas Tech University&lt;/ref&gt; Normal spacing between the upper [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]] is 1⅛–1⅜&amp;nbsp;inches (29–35&amp;nbsp;mm) and 1–1¼&amp;nbsp;inches (25–32&amp;nbsp;mm) between the lower canine teeth.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Coyote Predation – Description|work=A.

This trait, however, is absent in the large [[New England]] coyotes, which are thought to have some wolf ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOGS&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author=Coppinger, Ray|title=Dogs: a Startling New Understanding of Canine Origin, Behavior and Evolution|year=2001|page=352|isbn= 0684855305|publisher=Scribner|location= New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During pursuit, a coyote may reach speeds up to {{convert|43|mph|km/h|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0004737.html Speed of Animals], Infoplease.com, sourced from ''Natural History Magazine'', March 1974; The American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; and can jump a distance of over {{convert|13|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;GJ&quot; /&gt;

==Behavior==

Though coyotes have been observed to travel in large groups, they primarily hunt in pairs. Typical packs consist of six closely related adults, yearlings and young. Coyote packs are generally smaller than wolf packs and associations between individuals are less stable,&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia&quot; /&gt; thus making their social behavior more in line with that of the [[dingo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;helmut&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZUcKwPQNXWEC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Domestication: the decline of environmental appreciation''] by Helmut Hemmer, translated by Neil Beckhaus, Edition: 2, illustrated. Published by Cambridge University Press, 1990. ISBN 0-521-34178-7&lt;/ref&gt; It has been theorized that this is due to an earlier expression of aggression, and the fact that coyotes reach their full growth in their first year, unlike wolves, which reach it in their second.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author=Macdonald, David|url = http://www.amazon.com/dp/0871968711|title = The Encyclopedia of Mammals: 1| year = 1984|page = 446|isbn = 0-04-500028-x|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common names of coyote groups are a band, a pack, or a rout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mindprod.com/jgloss/collectivenouns.html Collective Nouns: Java Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;
Coyotes are primarily nocturnal, but can often be seen during daylight hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;GJ&quot; /&gt; Coyotes were once essentially [[Diurnality|diurnal]], but have adapted to more nocturnal behavior with pressure from humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McClennen, N., R. Wigglesworth, and S. H. Anderson|year= 2001|title=The effect of suburban and agricultural development on the activity patterns of coyotes (''Canis latrans'')|journal= American Midland Naturalist|volume=146|pages= 27–36|jstor=3083149|doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2001)146[0027:TEOSAA]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coyotes are capable of digging their own burrows, though they often prefer the burrows of [[groundhog]]s or [[American badger]]s. Coyote territorial ranges can be as much as 19 kilometers in diameter around the [[maternity den|den]], and travel occurs along fixed trails.&lt;ref name=&quot;GJ&quot; /&gt;

In areas where wolves have been exterminated, coyotes usually flourish. For example, as New England became increasingly settled and the resident wolves were eliminated, the coyote population increased, filling the empty biological niche. Coyotes appear better able than wolves to live among people.&lt;ref name=&quot;EC&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Eastern Coyotes Are Becoming Coywolves|work=David Zimmerman|publisher=Caledonian record|url = http://www.propertyrightsresearch.org/2006/articles04/eastern_coyotes_are_becoming_coy.htm|accessdate = August 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coyotes have been known to live a maximum of 10 years in the wild and 18 years in captivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;GJ&quot; /&gt; They seem to be better than dogs at [[observational learning]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DOGS&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author=Coppinger, Ray|title=Dogs: a Startling New Understanding of Canine Origin, Behavior and Evolution|year=2001|pages= p352|isbn=0684855305|publisher=Scribner|location= New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[File:Coyote pup.jpg|thumb|left|Newborn coyote pup]]
[[File:SevenCoyotePups08.jpg|thumb|right|Eight coyote pups]]
Female coyotes are [[Estrus cycle|monoestrous]], and remain in heat for 2–5 days between late January and late March, during which mating occurs. Once the female chooses a partner, the mated pair may remain temporarily monogamous for a number of years.
Depending on geographic location, [[spermatogenesis]] in males takes around 54 days, and occurs between January and February. The gestation period lasts from 60 to 63 days. Litter size ranges from 1 to 19 pups; the average is 6.&lt;ref name=&quot;GJ&quot; /&gt; These large litters act as compensatory measures against the high juvenile mortality rate, with approximately 50–70% of pups not surviving to adulthood.&lt;ref name=&quot;michigan&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Coyote (Canis latrans)| publisher=Michigan Department of Natural Resources| url = http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10370_12145_12205-60378--,00.html| accessdate = March 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pups weigh approximately 250&amp;nbsp;grams at birth, and are initially blind and limp-eared.&lt;ref name=&quot;GJ&quot; /&gt; Coyote growth rate is faster than that of wolves, being similar in length to that of the [[dhole]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DHOLE&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author=Fox, Michael W.| url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0873958438|title=The Whistling Hunters: Field Studies of the Asiatic Wild Dog (Cuon Alpinus)|year=1984|page= 150|isbn=0873958438|publisher=State University of New York Press|location= Albany }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eyes open and ears become erect after 10 days. Around 21–28 days after birth, the young begin to emerge from the den, and by 35 days they are fully weaned. Both parents feed the weaned pups with regurgitated food. Male pups will disperse from their dens between months 6 and 9, while females usually remain with the parents and form the basis of the pack. The pups attain full growth between 9 and 12 months. Sexual maturity is reached by 12 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;GJ&quot; /&gt; Unlike wolves, mother coyotes will tolerate other lactating females in their pack.&lt;ref name=&quot;wits&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = The Evolution &amp; History of Wolves|work=Rioghal Kennels| publisher=Rioghal Kennels| url = http://hal_macgregor.tripod.com/kennel/Kennel.htm| accessdate = November 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interspecific hybridization====
[[File:COYDOG.JPG|thumb|A Coyote-German Shepherd hybrid]]
Coyotes will sometimes mate with [[domestic dog]]s, usually in areas like Texas and Oklahoma, where the coyotes are plentiful and the breeding season is extended because of the warm weather. The resulting hybrids, called [[coydog]]s, maintain the coyote's predatory nature, along with the dog's lack of timidity toward humans, making them a more serious threat to livestock than pure-blooded animals. This cross-breeding has the added effect of confusing the breeding cycle. Coyotes usually breed only once a year, while coydogs will breed year-round, producing many more pups than a wild coyote. Differences in the ears and tail are generally what can be used to distinguish coydogs from domestic/feral dogs or pure coyotes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health-serve.com/coyoteclub/coydogs.html CoyoteClub.org: Photos of deceased coydogs]&lt;/ref&gt; Breeding experiments in Germany with [[poodle]]s, coyotes, and later on with the resulting dog-coyote hybrids showed that unlike [[wolfdog]]s, coydogs show a decrease in fertility, significant communication problems as well as an increase of genetic diseases after three generations of interbreeding.&lt;ref&gt;Doris Feddersen-Petersen, Hundepsychologie, 4. Auflage, 2004, Franck-Kosmos-Verlag 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Coyotes have also been known on occasion to mate with [[wolf|wolves]], though this is less common than with dogs, due to the wolf's hostility to the coyote. The offspring, known as a [[coywolf]], is generally intermediate in size to both parents, being larger than a pure coyote, but smaller than a pure wolf. A study showed that of 100 coyotes collected in [[Maine]], 22 had half or more wolf ancestry, and one was 89% wolf. A theory has been proposed that the large eastern coyotes in Canada are actually hybrids of the smaller western coyotes and wolves that met and mated decades ago as the coyotes moved toward New England from their earlier western ranges.&lt;ref name=&quot;EC&quot; /&gt; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources research scientist Brent Patterson has revealed findings that most coyotes in [[Eastern Ontario]] are wolf-coyote hybrids and that the [[Eastern wolf|Eastern wolves]] in [[Algonquin Park]] are, in general, not inter-breeding with coyotes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpaws-ov-vo.org/eastern_wolf_e.html Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society – Eastern Wolf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Red Wolf]] is thought by certain scientists to be in fact a wolf/coyote hybrid rather than a unique species. Strong evidence for hybridization was found through genetic testing, which showed that red wolves have only 5% of their [[alleles]] unique from either gray wolves or coyotes. Genetic distance calculations have indicated that red wolves are intermediate between coyotes and gray wolves, and that they bear great similarity to wolf/coyote hybrids in southern [[Quebec]] and [[Minnesota]]. Analyses of mitochondrial DNA showed that existing red wolf populations are predominantly coyote in origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = The red wolf (Canis rufus) – hybrid or not?| publisher=Montana State University|url = http://www.montana.edu/~wwwbi/staff/creel/bio480/The%20red%20wolf.pdf|accessdate = August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
The calls a coyote makes are high-pitched and variously described as howls, yips, yelps, and barks. These calls may be a long rising and falling note (a howl) or a series of short notes (yips). These calls are most often heard at dusk or night, but may sometimes be heard in the day or in the middle of the day. Although these calls are made throughout the year, they are most common during the spring mating season and in the fall when the pups leave their families to establish new territories. When a coyote calls his pack together, he howls at one high note. When the pack is together, he howls higher and higher, and then they yip and yelp and also do a yi-yi sound very shrill with the howl.

==Ecology==
===Diet and hunting===
[[File:Coyoteelk.jpg|thumb|Coyote on elk carcass in winter in Lamar Valley]]
Coyotes are opportunistic, versatile carnivores with a 90% mammalian diet, depending on the season. They primarily eat small mammals, such as [[vole]]s, [[prairie dogs]], [[Eastern Cottontail|eastern cottontails]], [[ground squirrel]]s, and [[Mouse|mice]], though they will eat [[bird]]s, [[snake]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[deer]], [[javelina]], and [[livestock]], as well as large [[insect]]s and other large [[invertebrate]]s. The coyote will also target any species of bird that nests on the ground. Though they will consume large amounts of [[carrion]], they tend to prefer fresh meat. Fruits and vegetables are a significant part of the coyote's diet in the autumn and winter months. Part of the coyote's success as a species is its dietary adaptability. As such, coyotes have been known to eat human rubbish and domestic pets. They catch cats and dogs when they come too close to the pack. Urban populations of coyotes have been known to actively hunt cats, and to leap shorter fences to take small dogs. In particularly bold urban packs, coyotes have also been reported to shadow human joggers or larger dogs, and even to take small dogs while the dog is still on a leash. However, this behavior is often reported when normal urban prey, such as [[brown rat]]s, [[black rat]]s and [[rabbit]]s, have become scarce. Yet, confirmed reports of coyotes killing a human have been documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/nova-scotia/story/2009/10/28/ns-coyote-attack-died.html|work=CBC News|title=Coyotes kill Toronto singer in Cape Breton|date=October 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GJ&quot; /&gt;

Though the coyote is the basis for the character of [[Wile E. Coyote]] in the Warner Brothers [[Looney Tunes]] and [[Merrie Melodies]] animated cartoons, especially about the [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner|Road Runner]], coyotes have not been known as yet to attack [[Greater Roadrunner]]s for prey.

Coyotes shift their hunting techniques in accordance with their prey. When hunting small animals such as mice, they slowly stalk through the grass, and use their acute sense of smell to track down the prey. When the prey is located, the coyotes stiffen and pounce on the prey in a cat-like manner. Coyotes will commonly work in teams when hunting large ungulates such as deer, which is more common in winter (when large prey is likely weakened) and in larger-bodied Northern coyotes. Coyotes may take turns in baiting and pursuing the deer to exhaustion, or they may drive it towards a hidden member of the pack.&lt;ref name=&quot;GJ&quot; /&gt; When attacking large prey, coyotes attack from the rear and the flanks of their prey. Occasionally they also grab the neck and head, pulling the animal down to the ground. Coyotes are persistent hunters, with successful attacks sometimes lasting as long as 21 hours; even unsuccessful ones can continue more than 8 hours before the coyotes give up.

===Interspecific predatory relationships===
[[File:Wolfkilledcoyote.jpg|thumb|Rolf Peterson investigating the carcass of a coyote killed by a wolf in Yellowstone National Park, January 1996]]
The [[gray wolf]] is a significant predator of coyotes wherever their ranges overlap. Since the [[Wolf reintroduction#Yellowstone National Park and Idaho|Yellowstone Gray Wolf Reintroduction]] in 1995 and 1996, the local coyote population went through a dramatic restructuring. Until the wolves returned, [[Yellowstone National Park]] had one of the densest and most stable coyote populations in America due to a lack of human impacts. Two years after the wolf reintroductions, the pre-wolf population of coyotes had been reduced 50% through both competitive exclusion and intraguild predation. In [[Grand Teton]], coyote densities were 33% lower than normal in the areas where they coexisted with wolves, and 39% lower in the areas of Yellowstone where wolves were reintroduced. In one study, about 16% of radio-collared coyotes were preyed upon by wolves. Yellowstone coyotes have had to shift their territories as a result, moving from open meadows to steep terrain. Carcasses in the open no longer attract coyotes; when a coyote is chased on flat terrain, it is often killed. They feel more secure on steep terrain where they will often lead a pursuing wolf downhill. As the wolf comes after it, the coyote will turn around and run uphill. Wolves, being heavier, cannot stop and the coyote gains a large lead. Though physical confrontations between the two species are usually dominated by the larger wolves, coyotes have been known to attack wolves if they outnumber them. Both species will kill each other's pups given the opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1998/3/weavingwolfweb.cfm &quot;Weaving A New Web: Wolves Change An Ecosystem&quot;], ''Zoogoer'' magazine, May/June 1998, Smithsonian National Zoo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coyotevwolf&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Coyotes Cower in Wolf Territory| publisher=Livescience| url = http://www.livescience.com/animals/070911_wolves_coyotes.html| accessdate = March 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wolf urine has been marketed and claimed to be an organic coyote deterrent, such as for deterring attacks on sheep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ag.ansc.purdue.edu/sheep/ansc442/Semprojs/2002/predation/predators_and_prey.htm &quot;Preventing Predation of Your Sheep Flock: Predators and Prey&quot;, student project at Purdue University]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cougar]]s sometimes kill coyotes. The coyote's instinctive fear of cougars has led to the development of anti-coyote sound systems which repel coyotes from public places by replicating the sounds of a cougar.&lt;ref name=&quot;CR&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Coyote In the Suburbs| publisher=Q&amp;A websites|url = http://www.qawebsites.com/coyote.htm|accessdate = September 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bears can also rarely kill coyotes, more likely in competitive rather than predatory attacks. However, both cougars and bears have been displaced from carcasses by coyote packs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yellowstonenationalpark.com/coyote.htm Yellowstone Wildlife – Coyote]. Yellowstonenationalpark.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In sympatric populations of coyotes and [[red fox]]es, fox territories tend to be located largely outside of coyote territories. The principal cause of this separation is believed to be active avoidance of coyotes by the foxes. Interactions between the two species vary in nature, ranging from active antagonism to indifference. The majority of aggressive encounters are initiated by coyotes, and there are few reports of red foxes acting aggressively toward coyotes except when attacked or when their pups were approached. Conversely, foxes and coyotes have sometimes been seen feeding together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/mammals/cfoxint/index.htm &quot;Observed Interactions Between Coyotes and Red Foxes&quot;], [[Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center]], [[United States Geological Survey]]&lt;/ref&gt; In southern California, coyotes frequently kill gray foxes, and these smaller canids tend to avoid areas with high coyote densities.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fedriani, J .

Coyotes will sometimes form a symbiotic relationship with [[American badger]]s. Because coyotes are not very effective at digging rodents out of their burrows, they will chase the animals while they are above ground. Badgers on the other hand are not fast runners, but are well-adapted to digging. When hunting together, they effectively leave little escape for prey in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;GJ&quot; /&gt;

In some areas, coyotes share their ranges with [[bobcat]]s. It is rare for these two similarly sized species to physically confront one another, though bobcat populations tend to diminish in areas with high coyote densities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1139/z89-170|author=Litvaitis, J.

==Relationship with humans==
===Adaptation to human environment===
[[File:Coyote arizona.jpg|thumb|A coyote standing by a road in [[Arizona]]]]
Despite being extensively hunted, the coyote is one of the few medium-to-large-sized animals that has enlarged its range since human encroachment began. It originally ranged primarily in the western half of North America, but it has adapted readily to the changes caused by human presence and, since the early 19th century, has been steadily and dramatically extending its range.&lt;ref&gt;Gompper, M. 2002.

Coyotes have moved into most of the areas of North America formerly occupied by [[Gray Wolf|wolves]], and are often observed foraging in suburban garbage bins.

Coyotes thrive in suburban settings and even some urban ones. A study by wildlife ecologists at [[The Ohio State University]] yielded some surprising findings in this regard. Researchers studied coyote populations in Chicago over a seven-year period (2000–2007), proposing that coyotes have adapted well to living in densely populated urban environments while avoiding contact with humans. They found, among other things, that urban coyotes tend to live longer than their rural counterparts, kill rodents and small pets, and live anywhere from parks to industrial areas. The researchers estimate that there are up to 2,000 coyotes living in &quot;the greater Chicago area&quot; and that this circumstance may well apply to many other urban landscapes in North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;urb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://www.world-science.net/othernews/060105_coyotefrm.htm &quot;Thriving under our noses, stealthily: coyotes&quot;] URL accessed on January 9, 2006.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In Washington, D.C.'s [[Rock Creek Park]], coyotes den and raise their young, scavenge roadkill, and hunt rodents. &quot;I don't see it as a bad thing for a park,&quot; the assigned [[National Park Service]] biologist told a reporter for ''Smithsonian Magazine'' (March 2006). &quot;I see it as good for keeping animal populations in control, like the squirrels and the mice.&quot;

In another testament to the coyote's habitat adaptability, a coyote nicknamed &quot;Hal&quot; made his way to New York City's [[Central Park]] in March 2006, wandering about the park for at least two days before being captured by officials. New York's parks commissioner Adrian Benepe noted this coyote had to be very &quot;adventurous&quot; and &quot;curious&quot; to get so far into the city.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Maria, and Janon Fisher.

===Attacks on humans===
[[File:No Feeding.jpg|thumb|A sign discouraging people from feeding coyotes, which can lead to them habituating themselves to human presence, thus increasing the likelihood of attack]]
Coyote attacks on humans are uncommon and rarely cause serious injuries, due to the relatively small size of the coyote. However, coyote attacks on humans have increased since 1998 in the state of California. Data from USDA Wildlife Services, the California Department of Fish &amp; Game, and other sources show that while 41 attacks occurred during the period of 1988–1997, 48 attacks were verified from 1998 through 2003. The majority of these incidents occurred in Southern California near the suburban-wildland interface.&lt;ref name=&quot;AOH&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Coyote Attacks: An Increasing Suburban Problem|url = http://www.co.san-diego.ca.us/awm/docs/coyoteattacks.pdf|accessdate = August 19, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070926044522/http://www.co.san-diego.ca.us/awm/docs/coyoteattacks.pdf  |archivedate = September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to an absence of harassment by residents, urban coyotes lose their natural fear of humans, which is further worsened by people intentionally feeding coyotes. In such situations, some coyotes have begun to act aggressively toward humans, chasing joggers and bicyclists, confronting people walking their dogs, and stalking small children.&lt;ref name=&quot;AOH&quot; /&gt; Non-[[Rabies|rabid]] coyotes in these areas will sometimes target small children, mostly under the age of 10, though some adults have been bitten. In June 2010 a 3-year-old girl and a 6-year-old girl were attacked and seriously injured in separate attacks by coyotes in [[Rye, New York]], a suburb of New York City. The 6-year-old was attacked by two coyotes on June 25 and the 3-year-old was attacked by one coyote on June 29. There was no indication the animals were rabid, but the girls were given treatment as a precaution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myrye.com/my_weblog/2010/06/coyote-attack-rye-pd-press-conference-and-statement.html Coyote Attack – Rye PD Press Conference and Statement].

===Livestock and pet predation===
Coyotes are presently the most abundant livestock predators in western North America, causing the majority of [[sheep]], [[goat]] and [[cattle]] losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP&quot; /&gt; For example, according to the [[National Agricultural Statistics Service]], coyotes were responsible for 60.5% of the 224,000 sheep deaths that were attributed to predation in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| publication-date =May 6, 2005|title =Sheep and Goats Death Loss|publisher=[[National Agricultural Statistics Service]]|url =http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1628|accessdate = December 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the total number of sheep deaths in 2004 comprised only 2.22% of the total sheep and lamb population in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nass.usda.gov/QuickStats/indexbysubject.jsp?Text1=&amp;site=NASS_MAIN&amp;select=Select+a+State&amp;Pass_name=&amp;Pass_group=Livestock+%26+Animals&amp;Pass_subgroup=Livestock#top National Agricultural Statistics Service]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[National Agricultural Statistics Service]] USDA report, &quot;All sheep and lamb inventory in the United States on July 1, 2005, totaled 7.80&amp;nbsp;million head, 2% above July 1, 2004. [[Animal husbandry|Breeding]] [[sheep]] inventory at 4.66&amp;nbsp;million head on July 1, 2005 was 2% above July 1, 2004.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/Shee/Shee-07-22-2005.txt |title=Sheep and lamb inventory |publisher=usda.mannlib.cornell.edu |accessdate=February 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By virtue of the fact that coyote
populations are typically many times greater and more widely distributed than those of wolves, coyotes cause more overall predation losses. However, an Idaho census taken in 2005 showed that individual coyotes were one-twentieth as likely to attack livestock than individual wolves.&lt;ref name=&quot;relative&quot;&gt;''Relative risks of predation on livestock posed by individual wolves, black bears, mountain lions and coyotes in Idaho'', Mark Collinge, United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Wildlife Services, Boise, Idaho&lt;/ref&gt;

Coyotes will typically bite the throat just behind the jaw and below the ear when attacking adult sheep or goats, with death commonly resulting from suffocation. Blood loss is usually a secondary cause of death. Calves and heavily-fleeced sheep are killed by attacking the flanks or hind-quarters, causing shock and blood loss. When attacking smaller prey, such as young lambs, the kill is made by biting the skull and spinal regions, causing massive tissue and ossular damage. Small or young prey may be completely carried off, leaving only blood as evidence of a kill. Coyotes will usually leave the hide and most of the skeleton of larger animals relatively intact, unless food is scarce, in which case they may leave only the largest bones. Scattered bits of wool, skin and other parts are characteristic where coyotes feed extensively on larger carcasses.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP&quot; /&gt;
[[File:coyote with typical hold on lamb.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Coyote with a typical throat hold on domestic sheep]]
Coyote predation can usually be distinguished from dog or [[coydog]] predation by the fact that coyotes partially consume their victims. Tracks are also an important factor in distinguishing coyote from dog predation. Coyote tracks tend to be more oval-shaped and compact than those of domestic dogs, plus, claw marks are less prominent and the tracks tend to follow a straight line more closely than those of dogs. With the exception of [[sighthound]]s, most dogs of similar weight to coyotes have a slightly shorter stride.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP&quot; /&gt; Coyote kills can be distinguished from wolf kills by the fact that there is less damage to the underlying tissues. Also, coyote scats tend to be smaller than wolf scats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://animalrangeextension.montana.edu/articles/wildlife/wolf_depredation.htm Ranchers' Guide to Wolf Depredation], Montana State University&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. government]] routinely shoots, poisons, traps and kills 90,000 coyotes each year to protect livestock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31880990/ns/us_news-environment/ Controlling wily coyotes?

Coyotes are often attracted to [[dog food]] and animals that are small enough to appear as prey. Items like garbage, pet food, and sometimes feeding stations for birds and squirrels will attract coyotes into backyards. Approximately 3 to 5 pets attacked by coyotes are brought into the Animal Urgent Care hospital of south Orange County (California) each week, the majority of which are dogs, since cats typically do not survive the attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;AOP&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = For coyotes, pets are prey|work=Greg Hardesty|publisher=Orange County Register|url = http://www.ocregister.com/ocr/sections/news/focus_in_depth/article_508026.php|accessdate = August 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scat analysis collected near [[Claremont, California]] revealed that coyotes relied heavily on pets as a food source in winter and spring.&lt;ref name=&quot;AOH&quot; /&gt; At one location in Southern California, coyotes began relying on a colony of [[feral cat]]s as a food source. Over time, the coyotes killed most of the cats, and then continued to eat the cat food placed daily at the colony site by citizens who were maintaining the cat colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;AOH&quot; /&gt;
Coyotes usually attack smaller sized dogs, but they have been known to attack even large, powerful breeds like the [[Rottweiler]] in exceptional cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.whdh.com/news/articles/local/BO52127/ &quot;A coyote attacks in Weymouth and kills a dog&quot;], WHDH-TV – New England News&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs larger than coyotes are generally able to drive them off, and have been known to kill coyotes. Smaller breeds are more likely to suffer injury or death.

===Pelts===
In the early days of European settlement in [[North Dakota]], [[American Beaver]]s were the most valued and sought after [[furbearers]], though other species were also taken, including coyotes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/mammals/furtake/history.htm History of the Fur Trade], Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center, USGS&lt;/ref&gt; Coyotes are an important furbearer in the region. During the 1983–86 seasons, North Dakota buyers purchased an average of 7,913 pelts annually, for an average annual combined return to takers of $255,458. In 1986–87, South Dakota buyers purchased 8,149 pelts for a total of $349,674 to takers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/wetlands/basinwet/chap3g.htm Dakotas Prairie Basin Wetlands], Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center, USGS&lt;/ref&gt;

The harvest of coyote pelts in Texas has varied over the past few decades, but has generally followed a downward trend. A study from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, however, found that there was no indication of population decline, and suggested that, as pelt prices were not increasing, the decrease in harvest was likely due to decreasing demand, and not increasing scarcity (where pelt prices would go up.) It suggested that fashion, and the changing custom of wearing fur garments, may be significant among these factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://texnat.tamu.edu/symposia/coyote/p18.htm Coyotes As Part Of Texas' Fur Trade], Symposium Proceedings, ''Coyotes in the Southwest: A Compendium of Our Knowledge'' December 13–14, 1995, Angelo, Texas&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, coyote fur is still used for full coats and trim and is particularly popular for men’s coats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iftf.com/iftf_2_4_2.php International Fur Trade Federation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character in mythology==
[[File:Coyotewithpossuminpersimmontree.png|thumb|Coyote tries to persuade [[Virginia opossum|Opossum]] to let him have some [[persimmon]]s, in a [[Caddo]] story.]]
{{Main|Coyote (mythology)}}
Traditional stories from many [[Native American (Americas)|Native American]], [[First Nations]], and [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] cultures include a deity whose name is translated into English as ''Coyote''. Although especially common in stories told by southwestern Native American nations, such as the [[Navajo Nation|Diné]] and [[Apache]], stories about Coyote appear in dozens of Native American nations from Canada to Mexico.

Usually appearing as a [[trickster]], a [[culture hero]] or both, Coyote also often appears in [[creation myth]]s and [[just-so stories|etiological myths]]. Although often appearing in stories as male, Coyote can be female, [[hermaphrodite]], or gender changing, in traditional Aboriginal stories.

==Contemporary cultural references==
{{Main|Coyotes in popular culture}}
The coyote is a popular figure in [[folklore]] and [[popular culture]]. References may invoke either the animal or the mythological figure. Traits commonly described in pop culture appearances include inventiveness, mischievousness, and evasiveness. By far the best known representation is the animated [[Wile E. Coyote]], whose popularity has spread the three-syllable Spanish pronunciation of the word ''coyote'' throughout English-speaking North America.

''Coyote'' is also a slang term for a person who [[people smuggling|smuggles illegal immigrants]] over the border from Mexico to the United States.

The [[Phoenix Coyotes]] are a [[National Hockey League]] franchise based in [[Arizona]].

The mascot of the [[University of South Dakota]] is the coyote.

===Genus controversy===
In 1816, in the third volume of [[Lorenz Oken]]'s ''Lehrbuch der Naturgeschichte'', the author found sufficient similarities in the dentition of coyotesgenus from ''Canis'' called ''Thos'' after the classical Greek word ''θώς'' (jackal). Oken's idiosyncratic nomenclatorial ways, however, aroused the scorn of a number of zoological systematists. Nearly all the descriptive words used to justify the genus division were relative terms without a reference measure, and the argument did not take into account the size differences between the species, which can be considerable. [[Angel Cabrera (naturalist)|Angel Cabrera]], in his 1932 monograph on the mammals of [[Morocco]], briefly touched upon the question of whether or not the presence of a [[cingulum (tooth)|cingulum]] on the upper [[Molar (tooth)|molars]] of the jackals and its corresponding absence in the rest of ''Canis'' could justify a subdivision of the genus ''Canis''. In practice, he chose the undivided-genus alternative and referred to the jackals as ''Canis''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thos&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Thos vs Canis| publisher=Holger Homann’s Home Page|url = http://www.holgerhomann.us/Thos_vs%20%20Canis.htm|accessdate = March 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few authors, however, [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] being among them, accepted Oken's nomenclature, and went as far as referring to the coyote as ''American jackal''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author=Seton, Ernest Thompson|url = http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0486447472?qisbn=1206802027|title = Art Anatomy of Animals|year = 2006|page = 160|isbn = 0486447472|publisher=Dover Publications|location = Mineola, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oken/Heller proposal of the new genus ''Thos'' did not affect the classification of the coyote. [[Gerrit S. Miller]] still had in his 1924 edition of ''List of North American Recent Mammals'' in the section “Genus ''Canis'' Linnaeas,” the subordinate heading “Subgenus ''Thos'' Oken” and backed it up with a reference to Heller. In the reworked version of the book in 1955, [[Philip Hershkovitz]] and [[Hartley Jackson]] led him to drop ''Thos'' both as an available scientific term and as a viable subgenus of ''Canis''. In his definitive study of the taxonomy of the coyote, Jackson had, in response to Miller, queried whether Heller had seriously looked at specimens of coyotes prior to his 1914 article and thought the characters to be “''not sufficiently important or stable to warrant subgeneric recognition for the group''”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thos&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Conan9.png|298px|thumb|&quot;Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the Earth under his sandalled feet.&quot; &lt;br /&gt; — [[Robert E. Howard]], ''[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]'', 1932. &lt;br /&gt;Illustration by [[Mark Schultz (comicbook writer)|Mark Schultz]].]]

'''Conan the Barbarian''' (also known as '''Conan the Cimmerian''', from the name of the character's homeland, [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmeria]]) is a fictional character. He is a hero,&lt;ref name=&quot;Conan1&quot;&gt;The Robert E. Howard United Press Association, David McAllister; [http://www.rehupa.com/marek_omb37.htm selections from One More Barbarian #37].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Conan2&quot;&gt;Towson University, John L. Flynn; [http://pages.towson.edu/flynn/heroes.html A HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF HEROES IN CONTEMPORARY WORKS OF FANTASY LITERATURE].&lt;/ref&gt; a well known and iconic figure in American fantasy, and the most famous [[barbarian]] in fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Herron (1984). p. 149: &quot;Robert E. Howard of Cross Plains, Texas, created one of the great mythic figures in modern popular culture, the Dark Barbarian… [which] put Howard in the select ranks of the literary legend-makers&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Conan is often associated with the [[Fantasy subgenres|fantasy subgenre]] of [[sword and sorcery]] and [[heroic fantasy]]. He was created by [[Texas|Texan]] writer [[Robert E. Howard]] in 1932 via a series of [[fantasy]] stories sold to ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine. The character has since appeared in licensed [[Conan (books)|books]], [[Conan (comics)|comics]], [[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|films]], [[Conan the Adventurer (animated series)|television]] [[Conan the Adventurer (TV series)|programs]], [[Conan (game)#Video games|video games]], roleplaying games, and even a board game, all of which contribute to the hero's long-standing popularity.

''Conan the Barbarian'' is also the title of a [[Gnome Press]] collection of stories published in 1954, a [[Conan (comics)|comic]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] beginning in 1970, and a [[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|film]] and its novelization in 1982.

==Publication history==
Conan the Barbarian was created by [[Robert E. Howard]] and was the spiritual successor to an earlier character, [[Kull of Atlantis]]. For months, Howard had been in search of a new character to market to the burgeoning pulp outlets of the early 1930s. In October 1931, Howard submitted a short story titled &quot;People of the Dark&quot; to Clayton Publications' new magazine, ''Strange Tales of Mystery and Terror'' (June 1932). &quot;People of the Dark&quot; is a remembrance story of &quot;[[past lives]]&quot;, and in its first-person narrative the protagonist describes one of his previous incarnations: Conan, a black-haired [[barbarian]] hero who swears by a deity called [[Crom (fictional deity)|Crom]]. Some Howard scholars believe this Conan to be a forerunner of the more famous character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyborian Genesis&quot;&gt;Patrice Louinet. ''Hyborian Genesis: Part 1'', pages 429 to 453, ''[[The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian]]''; 2003, Del Rey.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 1932, Howard vacationed at a border town on the lower [[Rio Grande]] to enjoy the local culture. During this trip, he further conceived the character of Conan and also wrote the poem &quot;[[Cimmeria (poem)|Cimmeria]]&quot;, much of which echoes specific passages in [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]]''. According to some scholars, there is a strong likelihood that Howard's conception of Conan and the Hyborian Age originated in [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s ''[[Thomas Bulfinch|The Outline of Mythology]]'' (1913) which inspired Howard to &quot;coalesce into a coherent whole his literary aspirations and the strong physical, autobiographical elements underlying the creation of Conan.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyborian Genesis&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Conan phoenix on sword.jpg|thumb|200px|An interior ''[[Weird Tales]]'' illustration by Jayem Wilcox from 1932. The illustration depicts a scene from Howard's ''[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]''. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The original short story was written by Howard and first appeared in the December 1932 issue of ''Weird Tales'' magazine.]]

Having digested these prior influences after he returned from his trip, Howard rewrote the rejected Kull story &quot;By This Axe I Rule!&quot; (May 1929) with his new hero in mind, re-titling it &quot;[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]&quot;. Howard also wrote &quot;[[The Frost Giant's Daughter]]&quot;, inspired by the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] of [[Daphne]], and submitted both stories to ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine. Although &quot;The Frost-Giant's Daughter&quot; was rejected, the magazine accepted &quot;The Phoenix on the Sword&quot; after it received the requested polishing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyborian Genesis&quot;/&gt;

&quot;The Phoenix on the Sword&quot; appeared in ''Weird Tales'' in December 1932, thus marking Conan's first appearance in print. ''Weird Tales'' would become famous for its unique stable of notable authors, including [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Clark Ashton Smith]], [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Seabury Quinn]] and others. The acceptance of &quot;The Phoenix on the Sword&quot; by editor [[Farnsworth Wright]] prompted Howard to write an [[The Hyborian Age|8,000 word essay]] for personal use detailing &quot;the [[Hyborian Age]],&quot; the fictional setting for Conan. Using this essay as his guideline, Howard began plotting &quot;[[The Tower of the Elephant]]&quot;, a new Conan story that would be the first to truly integrate his new conception of the Hyborian world, and thus to introduce the setting to the reader.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyborian Genesis&quot;/&gt;

The publication and success of &quot;The Tower of the Elephant&quot; would spur Howard to write many more Conan stories for ''Weird Tales''. By the time of Howard's suicide in 1936, he had written twenty-one complete tales, seventeen of which had been published, as well as a number of unfinished fragments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyborian Genesis&quot;/&gt;

Following Howard's death, the copyright of the Conan stories passed through several hands. Eventually, under the guidance of [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Lin Carter]], the stories were expurgated, revised and sometimes rewritten. For roughly forty years, the original versions of Howard's Conan stories remained out of print. Only with the Berkley editions in 1977 was an attempt made to return to the earliest published (''Weird Tales'') form of the texts, but these failed to displace the edited versions. In the 1980s and 1990s, the copyright holders of the Conan franchise permitted Howard's stories to go out of print entirely, while continuing to sell Conan works by other authors.

In 2000, the British publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz Science Fiction]] issued a two-volume, complete edition of Howard's Conan stories as part of their Fantasy Masterworks imprint, including several stories which had never seen print in their original form. The Gollancz edition mostly used the versions of the stories as published in ''Weird Tales''.

In 2003, a British publisher named Wandering Star made an effort both to restore Howard's original manuscripts and to provide a more scholarly and historical view of the Conan stories. They published deluxe hardcover editions in England, which were republished in the United States by the Del Rey imprint of [[Ballantine Books]]. The first book, ''Conan of Cimmeria: Volume One (1932–1933)'' (2003; published in the US as ''The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian'') includes Howard's notes on his fictional setting, as well as letters and poems concerning the genesis of his ideas. This was followed by ''Conan of Cimmeria: Volume Two (1934)'' (2004) and ''Conan of Cimmeria: Volume Three (1935–1936)'' (2005); these were published in the US in 2005 as ''The Bloody Crown of Conan'' and ''The Conquering Sword of Conan''. Among them, the three books include all of the original unedited Conan stories.

==Setting==
[[Image:Chrysagon Hyboria 1024.jpg|thumb|298px|A map of Robert E. Howard's ''Hyborian Age''.]]
{{main|Hyborian Age}}

The various stories of Conan the Barbarian occur in the fictional &quot;[[Hyborian Age]]&quot;, set after the destruction of [[Atlantis]] and before the rise of the known [[Ancient history|ancient civilizations]]. This is a specific epoch in a fictional timeline created by Howard for many of the [[low fantasy]] tales of his [[artificial mythology|artificial legendary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyboria.xoth.net/history/hyborian_age.htm Robert E. Howard's ''Hyborian Age'' essay] adapted by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Walt Simonson]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons behind the invention of the Hyborian Age were perhaps commercial: Howard had an intense love for history and historical dramas; however, at the same time, he recognized the difficulties and the time-consuming research work needed in maintaining historical accuracy. By conceiving a timeless setting &amp;mdash; &quot;a ''vanished'' age&quot; &amp;mdash; and by carefully choosing names that resembled human history, Howard shrewdly avoided the problem of historical anachronisms and the need for lengthy exposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyborian Genesis&quot;/&gt;

According to &quot;The Phoenix on the Sword&quot;, the adventures of Conan take place ''&quot;...Between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the years of the rise of the [[Aryan race|Sons of Aryas]]...&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert E. Howard|Howard, Robert E.]], &quot;[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]&quot;, ''The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality and character==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Conan_adventurer--Frazetta.jpeg|thumb|298px|Cover of ''[[Conan the Adventurer]]'' (1966). Art by [[Frank Frazetta]].]] --&gt;

Conan is a Cimmerian (based somewhat loosely on the [[Celts]]), a [[barbarian]] of the far north. One of his grandfathers, however, came from a southern tribe. He was born on a battlefield and is the son of a village [[blacksmith]]. Conan matured quickly as a youth and, by age fifteen, he was already a respected [[warrior]] who had participated in the destruction of the [[Aquilonia (Conan)|Aquilonian]] outpost of Venarium. After its destruction, he was struck by wanderlust and began the adventures chronicled by Howard, encountering skulking monsters, evil [[Magicians in fantasy|wizard]]s, tavern wenches, and beautiful [[princess]]es. He roamed throughout the [[Hyborian Age]] nations as a [[thief]], [[outlaw]], [[mercenary]] and [[pirate]]. As he grew older, he began commanding larger units of men and escalating his ambitions. In his forties, he seized the crown of the tyrannical [[monarch|king]] of Aquilonia, the most powerful kingdom of the Hyborian Age, having strangled the previous ruler on the steps of the throne. Conan's adventures often result in him performing heroic feats, though his motivation for doing so is largely for his own survival or for personal gain, implying that the character displays the characteristics of an [[anti-hero]] and could be described as the archetypal &quot;amoral swordsman&quot; of the [[Sword and Sorcery]] genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conan1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Conan2&quot;&gt;Towson University, John L. Flynn; [http://pages.towson.edu/flynn/heroes.html A Historical Overview of Heroes in Contemporary Works of Fantasy Literature].&lt;/ref&gt; This observation could however be said to be in contrast to the assumption that Conan was merely another barbarian hero as envisioned by Howard for Weird Tales magazine.

=== Appearance ===
Conan has &quot;sullen&quot; or &quot;smoldering&quot; blue eyes and a black &quot;square-cut mane&quot;. Howard once describes him as having a hairy chest and, while comic book interpretations often portray Conan as wearing a loincloth or other minimalist clothing, Howard describes the character as wearing whatever garb is typical for the land and culture in which Conan finds himself. Howard never gave a strict height or weight for Conan in a story, only describing him in loose terms like &quot;giant&quot; and &quot;massive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Howard. &quot;[[A Witch Shall Be Born]]&quot;: &quot;the man was almost a giant in stature&quot;; &quot;Knots and bunches of muscle started out of the massive arms&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; In the tales no human is ever described as stronger than Conan, although several are mentioned as taller (such as the strangler Baal-pteor) or of larger bulk. In a letter to [[P. Schuyler Miller]] and [[John D. Clark]] in 1936 only three months before Howard's death, Conan is described as standing {{convert|6|ft|m}} and weighing {{convert|180|lb}} when he takes part in an attack on Venarium at only 15 years old, though being far from fully grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= The Conquering Sword of Conan |author=Robert E. Howard | illustrator= Gregory Manchess | date=November 29, 2005 | page=360 | publisher=Del Rey | ISBN=0345461533}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although Conan is muscular, Howard frequently compares his agility and way of moving to that of a panther (see for instance &quot;[[Jewels of Gwahlur]]&quot;, &quot;[[Beyond the Black River]]&quot; or &quot;[[Rogues in the House]]&quot;). His skin is frequently characterized as bronzed from constant exposure to the sun. In his younger years, he is often depicted wearing a light chain shirt and a horned helmet, though appearances vary with different artists.

During his reign as king of Aquilonia, Conan was &quot;... a tall man, mightily shouldered and deep of chest, with a massive corded neck and heavily muscled limbs. He was clad in silk and velvet, with the royal lions of Aquilonia worked in gold upon his rich jupon, and the crown of Aquilonia shone on his square-cut black mane; but the great sword at his side seemed more natural to him than the regal accoutrements. His brow was low and broad, his eyes a volcanic blue that smoldered as if with some inner fire. His dark, scarred, almost sinister face was that of a fighting-man, and his velvet garments could not conceal the hard, dangerous lines of his limbs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Howard. ''[[The Hour of the Dragon]]'', pages 89 and 90, ''The Bloody Crown of Conan''; 2005, Del Rey.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though several later authors have referred to Conan as &quot;[[Germanic people|Germanic]]-looking&quot;, Howard imagined the Cimmerians as a proto-[[Celt]]ic people with mostly black hair and blue or grey eyes. Ethnically the Cimmerians to which Conan belongs are descendants of the Atlanteans, though they do not remember their ancestry. In his fictional historical essay ''[[The Hyborian Age]]'', Howard describes how the people of Atlantis — the land where his character [[King Kull]] originated — had to move east after a great cataclysm changed the face of the world and sank their island, settling where northern [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]] would eventually be located. In the same work, Howard also described how the Cimmerians eventually moved south and east after the age of Conan (presumably in the vicinity of the [[Black Sea]], where the historical [[Cimmerians]] dwelt).

===Abilities===
{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}
Despite his brutish appearance, Conan uses his brains as well as his brawn. The Cimmerian is a talented fighter, but his travels have given him vast experience in other trades, especially as a [[Thief (character class)|thief]]; he is also a talented commander, tactician and strategist, as well as a born leader. In addition, Conan speaks many languages, including advanced reading and writing abilities: in certain stories, he is able to recognize, or even decipher, certain ancient or secret signs and writings. He also has incredible stamina, enabling him to go without sleep for a few days.

Another noticeable trait is his sense of humor, largely absent in the comics and movies but very much a part of Howard's original vision of the character, particularly apparent in &quot;[[Xuthal of the Dusk]]&quot;, also known as &quot;The Slithering Shadow.&quot;
He is a loyal friend to those true to him, with a barbaric code of conduct that often marks him as more honorable than the more sophisticated people he meets in his travels. Indeed, his straightforward nature and barbarism are constants in all the tales.

Conan is a formidable armed and unarmed combatant. With his back to the wall Conan is capable of engaging and killing opponents by the score. This is seen in several stories, such as &quot;[[Queen of the Black Coast]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Scarlet Citadel]]&quot; and &quot;[[A Witch Shall be Born]]&quot;. Conan is not superhuman, though; he did need the providential help of Zelata's wolf to defeat four Nemedian soldiers in the story ''[[The Hour of the Dragon]]''. Some of his hardest victories have come from fighting single opponents of inhuman strength: one such as Thak, the ape man from &quot;[[Rogues in the House]]&quot;, or the strangler Baal-Pteor in &quot;[[Shadows in Zamboula]]&quot;. Conan is far from untouchable and has been captured and defeated several times (on one occasion knocking himself out drunkenly running into a wall).

===Influences===
{{main|Robert E. Howard}}
Howard frequently corresponded with [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and the two would sometimes insert references or elements of each others' settings in their works. Later editors reworked many of the original Conan stories by Howard, thus diluting this connection. Nevertheless, many of Howard's unedited Conan stories are arguably part of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrice Louinet. ''Hyborian Genesis: Part 1'', page 436, ''The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian''; 2003, Del Rey.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many of the Conan stories by Howard, de Camp and Carter used geographical place names from [[Clark Ashton Smith]]'s [[Hyperborean Cycle]].

Additionally, fans such as comic book artist [[Mark Schultz (comics)|Mark Schultz]] have concluded that Conan was an idealized [[alter ego]] for Howard. Unlike the modern, stereotypical view of a brainless barbarian, Howard originally created Conan as a thoughtful figure, although primarily a man of action rather than a man of deep thought or brooding. A closer alter ego for Howard, often depicted as a melancholic man who often battled with [[clinical depression|depression]], much like Howard himself (the writer eventually committed suicide) is King Kull, Conan's original forebear (cf &quot;''[[By This Axe, I Rule]]''&quot; and &quot;''[[The Mirrors of Tuzun Thune]]''&quot;).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let teachers and priests and philosophers brood over questions of reality and illusion. I know this: if life is an illusion, then I am no less an illusion, and being thus, the illusion is real to me. I live, I burn with life, I love, I slay, and I am content. — &quot;[[Queen of the Black Coast]]&quot;, [[Robert E. Howard]], ''[[Weird Tales]]'', May 1934.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Book editions==
{{main|Conan (books)}}
[[Image:Conan usurper.jpg|thumb|175px|Cover of ''[[Conan the Usurper]]'' (1967). Art by [[Frank Frazetta]].]]
The character of Conan has proven durably popular, resulting in Conan stories by later writers such as [[Poul Anderson]], [[Leonard Carpenter]], [[Lin Carter]], [[L. Sprague de Camp]], [[Roland J. Green]], [[John C. Hocking]], [[Robert Jordan]], [[Sean A. Moore]], [[Björn Nyberg]], [[Andrew J. Offutt]], [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry]], [[John Maddox Roberts]], [[Harry Turtledove]], and [[Karl Edward Wagner]]. Some of these writers have finished incomplete Conan manuscripts by Howard. Others were created by rewriting Howard stories which originally featured entirely different characters from entirely different milieus. Most, however, are completely original works. In total, more than fifty novels and dozens of short stories featuring the Conan character have been written by authors other than Howard.

[[Image:Tales of Conan.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Cover of ''[[Tales of Conan]]'' (Gnome Press, 1955). Art by [[Ed Emshwiller]].]]
The [[Conan (books)#Gnome Press editions, 1950-1957|Gnome Press edition]] (1950–1957) was the first hardcover collection of Howard's Conan stories, including all the original Howard material known to exist at the time, some left unpublished in his lifetime. The later volumes contain some stories rewritten by [[L. Sprague de Camp]] (like &quot;The Treasure of Tranicos&quot;), including several non-Conan Howard stories, mostly historical exotica situated in the [[Levant]] at the time of the crusades, which he turned into Conan yarns. The Gnome edition also issued the first Conan story written by an author other than Howard — the final volume published, which is by [[Björn Nyberg]] and revised by de Camp.

The [[Conan (books)#Lancer/Ace paperback editions, 1966-1977|Lancer/Ace editions]] (1966–1977), under the direction of de Camp and [[Lin Carter]], were the first comprehensive paperbacks, compiling the material from the Gnome Press series together in chronological order with all the remaining original Howard material, including that left unpublished in his lifetime and fragments and outlines. These were completed by de Camp and Carter, and new stories written entirely by the two were added as well. Lancer Books went out of business before bringing out the entire series, the publication of which was completed by Ace Books. Its covers featured dynamic images by [[Frank Frazetta]] that, for many fans, presented the &quot;definitive&quot; impression of Conan and his world. For decades to come, most other portrayals of the Cimmerian and his imitators were heavily influenced by the cover paintings of this series.

Editions after the Lancer/Ace series have been of either the original Howard stories or Conan material by others, but not both. Notable later editions of the Howard stories include the [[Conan (books)#Donald M. Grant editions, 1974-1989|Donald M. Grant editions]] (1974–1989); [[Conan (books)#Berkley editions, 1977|Berkley editions]] (1977); [[Conan (books)#Gollancz editions, 2000-2006|Gollancz editions]] (2000–2006), and [[Conan (books)#Wandering Star/Del Rey editions, 2003-2005|Wandering Star/Del Rey editions]] (2003–2005). Later series of new Conan material include the [[Conan (books)#Bantam editions, 1978-1982|Bantam editions]] (1978–1982), [[Conan (books)#Ace Maroto editions, 1978-1981|Ace Maroto editions]] (1978–1981), and [[Conan (books)#Tor editions, 1982-2004|Tor editions]] (1982–2004).

==Conan chronologies==
{{main|Conan chronologies}}

In an attempt to provide a coherent timeline which fit the numerous adventures of Conan penned by Robert E. Howard and later writers, various &quot;Conan chronologies&quot; have been prepared by many people from the 1930s onward. Note that no consistent timeline has yet accommodated every single Conan story. The following are the principal theories that have been advanced over the years.

*[[Conan chronologies#Miller/Clark chronology|Miller/Clark chronology]] — ''A Probable Outline of Conan's Career'' (1936) was the first effort to put the tales in chronological order. Completed by [[P. Schuyler Miller]] and [[John D. Clark]], the chronology was later revised by Clark and [[L. Sprague de Camp]] in ''An Informal Biography of Conan the Cimmerian'' (1952).
*[[Conan chronologies#Robert Jordan chronology|Robert Jordan chronology]] — ''A Conan Chronology by Robert Jordan'' (1987) was a new chronology written by Conan writer [[Robert Jordan]] that included all written Conan material up to that point. It was heavily influenced by the Miller/Clark/de Camp chronologies, though it departed from them in a number of idiosyncratic instances.
*[[Conan chronologies#William Galen Gray chronology|William Galen Gray chronology]] — ''Timeline of Conan's Journeys'' (1997, rev. 2004), was fan William Galen Gray's attempt to create &quot;a chronology of all the stories, both Howard and pastiche.&quot; Drawing on the earlier Miller/Clark and Jordan chronologies, it represents the ultimate expression of their tradition to date.
*[[Conan chronologies#Joe Marek chronology|Joe Marek chronology]] — Joe Marek's chronology is limited to stories written (or devised) by Howard, though within that context it is essentially a revision of the Miller/Clark tradition to better reflect the internal evidence of the stories and avoid forcing Conan into what he perceives as a &quot;mad dash&quot; around the Hyborian world within timeframes too rapid to be credible.
*[[Conan chronologies#Dale Rippke chronology|Dale Rippke chronology]] — ''The Darkstorm Conan Chronology'' (2003) was a completely revised and heavily researched chronology, radically repositioning a number of stories and including only those stories written or devised by Howard. The [[Conan (Dark Horse comic)|Dark Horse comic series]] follows this chronology.

====Arnold Schwarzenegger films====
{{main|Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Destroyer}}
[[Image:Conan the barbarian.jpg|200px|thumb|''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982) poster.]]
The very first Conan cinematic project was planned by [[Edward Summer]]. Summer envisioned a series of Conan movies, much like the [[James Bond]] franchise. He outlined six stories for this film series, but none were ever made. An original screenplay by Summer and [[Roy Thomas]] was written, but their lore-authentic screen story was never filmed. However, the resulting film, ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982), was a creative mixture of screenwriters' [[Oliver Stone]] and [[John Milius]] ideas as well as plots from Conan stories (written also by Howard's successors, notably [[Lin Carter]] and [[L. Sprague de Camp]]). The addition of Nietzschean motto and Conan's life philosophy were crucial for bringing the spirit of Howard's literature to the screen.

The plot of ''Conan the Barbarian'' (1982) begins with Conan being enslaved by the Vanir raiders of [[Thulsa Doom (character)|Thulsa Doom]], a malevolent [[warlord]] who is responsible for the slaying of Conan's parents and the genocide of his people. Later, Thulsa Doom becomes a cult leader of a shamanist [[religion]] that worships Set, a Snake God. The vengeful Conan, the [[Archery|archer]] Subotai and the [[thief]] Valeria set out on a quest to rescue a princess held captive by Thulsa Doom. The film was directed by [[John Milius]] and produced by [[Dino De Laurentiis]]. The character of Conan was played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and was his break-through role as an actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Katz |first=Ephraim |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Film Encyclopedia |year=2006 |publisher=HarperCollins |location= |isbn=0060742143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This film was followed by a less popular sequel, ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;tessay&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Clark | last=Collis | coauthors= | title=Empire Essay: The Terminator | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 | work =Empire magazine | pages = | accessdate = 2007-04-22 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This sequel was a more typical [[fantasy]]-genre film and was even less faithful to Howard's Conan stories.

====Conan the Conqueror (Cancelled)====
The third film in the Conan trilogy was planned for 1987 to be titled ''[[Conan the Conqueror]]''. The director was to be either [[Guy Hamilton]] or [[John Guillermin]]. However Arnold Schwarzenegger was committed to the film ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' and De Laurentiis's contract with the star had expired after his obligation to ''[[Red Sonja (1985 film)|Red Sonja]]'' and ''[[Raw Deal (1986 film)|Raw Deal]]'' and he wasn't keen to negotiate a new one, thus the third Conan movie sank into [[development hell]]. The script was eventually turned into ''[[Kull the Conqueror]]''.

====Conan the Barbarian (2011)====
{{main|Conan the Barbarian (2011 film)}}
There were rumours in the late 1990s of another second Conan sequel, a story about an older Conan titled ''King Conan: Crown of Iron'', but Schwarzenegger's election in 2003 as governor of [[California]] ended this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/453/453828p1.html |title=Goodbye Hollywood, Hello Sacramento |author=Brian Linder |date=October 8, 2003 |work=[[IGN|IGN.com]] |publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc. |accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warner Bros.]] spent seven years trying to get the project off the ground, with development attempts made by [[Wachowski brothers|Larry and Andy Wachowski]], [[John Milius]], and [[Robert Rodriguez]] who was closest to completing development but left the project for ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]''. [[Boaz Yakin]] was hired in 2006 to start again. However, in June 2007 the rights reverted to [[Paradox Entertainment]], though all drafts made under Warner remained with them. Paradox's [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], [[Fredrik Malmberg]], told ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' &quot;we have great respect for Warner Bros., but after seven years, we came to the point where we needed to see progress to production.&quot; Paradox were auctioning the rights after and various groups took interest in producing, including [[New Line Cinema]], [[Hollywod Gang]], and [[Millenium Films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967759.html |title='Barbarian's' at the gate for New Line |author=Michael Fleming |date=June 27, 2007 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Reed Elsevier|Reed Elsevier Inc.]] |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to development-time frustrations felt when the rights were with Warner, Malmberg made deal terms where he was asking for $1 million for a one-year option, with another $1 million for each year's renewal. In August 2007, it was announced that Millennium had acquired the right to the project in an unrevealed seven-figure deal, with Malmberg and Millennium's [[Avi Lerner]], [[Boaz Davidson]], [[Joe Gatta]], and [[George Furla]] set to [[film producer|produce]]. The deal was brokered by Gatta, who originally made the deal between Paradox and Warner in 2002. Production was aimed for a Spring 2006 start, with the intention of having stories more faithful to the [[Robert E. Howard]] creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117970116.html |title=Millennium wins rights to 'Conan' |author=Michael Fleming |date=August 12, 2007 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Reed Elsevier|Reed Elsevier Inc.]] |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, [[Brett Ratner]] was prematurely announced to be the director of ''Conan'' to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' by Lerner, something which displeased him as he pointed out: &quot;I am not doing ''Conan'' now.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i431ca797a370fbb291584be186e82c07 |title=Brett Ratner circles 'Conan' |author=Jay A.

====Animated film====
An animated feature, [[Red_Nails#Adaptations|''Conan: Red Nails'']], based upon the [[Red Nails|novella]] of the same name, was partially completed but appears to have stalled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conanrednails.com/ Conan: Red Nails – Official film website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
There have been three television series related to Conan: A live-action TV series and animated cartoon series — both entitled ''Conan the Adventurer'', as well as a second animated series entitled ''[[Conan and the Young Warriors]]''.
*'''[[Conan the Adventurer (animated series)|Conan The Adventurer]]''' was the name of a popular [[animated television series]]. Produced by ''Jetlag Productions'' and ''Sunbow Productions'', the series debuted on October 1, 1992, ran for 64 episodes and concluded exactly two years later, on October 1, 1994. The series involved Conan chasing [[Serpent Men]] across the world in an attempt to release his parents from eternal imprisonment as living statues.
*'''[[Conan and the Young Warriors]]''' was an [[animated television series]] which premiered in 1994 and ran for 13 episodes. [[DiC Entertainment]] produced the show and [[CBS]] aired this series as a spin-off to the previous [[Conan the Adventurer (animated series)|Conan the Adventurer]] animated series. This cartoon took place after the finale of ''Conan the Adventurer'' with Wrath-Amon vanquished and Conan's family returned to life from living stone. Conan soon finds that the family of one of his friends are being turned into wolves by an evil sorceress and he must train three warriors in order to aid him in rescuing them.
*'''[[Conan the Adventurer (TV series)|Conan: The Adventurer]]''' was a [[television series]] loosely based on Conan. The TV show premiered on September 22, 1997, and ran for 22 episodes. This live-action series starred German bodybuilder [[Ralf Möller]] as Conan and [[Danny Woodburn]] as his sidekick Otli. The storyline was quite different from the Conan lore of [[Robert E. Howard]]. In this adaptation, Conan is a pleasant and jovial person. Also in this version, Conan is not a loner but one member in a merry band of adventurers.

{{main|Conan (comics)}}
Conan the Barbarian has appeared in comics nearly non-stop since 1970. The comics are arguably, apart from the books, the vehicle that had the greatest influence on the longevity and popularity of the character. Aside from an earlier and unofficial Conan comic published in Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comicvine.com/conan/29-2438/&lt;/ref&gt; the two main publishers of Conan comics have been [[Marvel Comics]] and [[Dark Horse Comics]]. Marvel Comics launched ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1970–1993) and the now-classic [[Savage Sword of Conan]] (1974–1995). Dark Horse launched their ''[[Conan (Dark Horse Comics)#Conan|Conan]]'' series in 2003. Dark Horse Comics is currently publishing compilations of the 1970s Marvel Comics series in [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] format.

The current president of the United States, [[Barack Obama]], is a collector of Conan the Barbarian comic books and a big fan of the character&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Swaine |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/3401168/Barack-Obama-The-50-facts-you-might-not-know.html |title=Barack Obama: The 50 facts you might not know |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=November 7, 2008 |accessdate=November 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared [[Barack Obama in comics|as a character]] in a comic book called ''[[Barack the Barbarian]]'' from [[Devil's Due]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mail Foreign Service |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1168213/Barack-Barbarian-takes-scantily-clad-nemesis-Sarah-Palin-new-comic-superhero-role.html |title=Meet Barack the Barbarian taking on scantily clad nemesis Sarah Palin in new comic superhero role |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=April 7, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alex |last=Spillius |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/5120374/Barack-Obama-and-Sarah-Palin-appear-in-comic-series.html |title=Barack Obama and Sarah Palin appear in comic series |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=April 7, 2009 |accessdate=November 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alison |last=Flood |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/apr/08/obama-comic-palin |title=Obama battles Red Sarah in comic clash |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=November 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marvel Comics====
{{main|Conan (Marvel Comics)}}
[[Marvel Comics]] introduced a relatively lore-faithful version of Conan the Barbarian in 1970 with ''Conan the Barbarian'', written by [[Roy Thomas]] and illustrated by [[Barry Windsor-Smith]]. Smith was succeeded by [[penciller]] [[John Buscema]], while Thomas continued to write for many years. Later writers included [[J.M. DeMatteis]], [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]], [[Michael Fleisher]], [[Doug Moench]], [[Jim Owsley]], [[Alan Zelenetz]], [[Chuck Dixon]], and [[Don Kraar]]. The highly successful ''Conan the Barbarian'' series spawned the more adult, black-and-white ''Savage Sword of Conan'' in 1974. Written by Roy Thomas and most art by [[John Buscema]] or [[Alfredo Alcala]], the ''Savage Sword of Conan'' soon became one of the most popular comic series in the 1970s and is now-considered a [[cult classic]].

The Marvel Conan stories were also adapted as a newspaper [[comic strip]] which appeared daily and Sunday from 4 September 1978 to 12 April 1981. Originally written by Roy Thomas and illustrated by John Buscema, the strip was continued by several different Marvel artists and writers.

[[Dark Horse Comics]] began their comic adaptation of the Conan saga in 2003. Entitled simply ''Conan'', the series was first written by [[Kurt Busiek]] and pencilled by [[Cary Nord]]. [[Tim Truman]] replaced Busiek when Busiek signed an exclusive contract with [[DC Comics]]; however, Busiek issues were sometimes used for filler. This series is an interpretation of the original Conan material by Robert E. Howard with no connection whatsoever to the earlier Marvel comics or any Conan story not written or envisioned by Howard supplemented by wholly original material.

They released a second series, ''[[Conan the Cimmerian (comics)|Conan the Cimmerian]]'' in 2008.

Dark Horses third series(Conan Road of Kings) began in December 2010.

==Copyright and trademark dispute==
The name Conan and the names of Robert E. Howard's other principal characters are claimed as trademarked by [[Paradox Entertainment]] of Stockholm, Sweden, through its US subsidiary Paradox Entertainment Inc. Paradox copyrights stories written by other authors under license from Conan Properties Inc.

However, since Robert E. Howard published his Conan stories at a time when the date of publication was the marker (1932 through 1963), and any new owners failed to renew them to maintain the copyrights,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robert-e-howard.org/AnotherThought4rerevised.html Paul Herman's research on the copyright status of Robert Howard's works]&lt;/ref&gt; the exact copyright status of all of Howard's Conan works are in question.&lt;ref&gt;

The Australian site of [[Project Gutenberg]] has many Robert E. Howard stories, including several Conan stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gutenberg.net.au/plusfifty-a-m.html#letterH Robert E. Howard's stories on Project Gutenberg]&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that, in their opinion, the stories are free from copyright and may be used by anyone, at least under Australian law, which was 50 years from author's death until 2005. Subsequent stories written by other authors are subject to the copyright laws of the relevant time.

In the United Kingdom, 70 years after the death of an author his works fall into the [[public domain]] and as such the works of Robert E. Howard have now fallen into the public domain there.

'''Chris Marker''' (born 29 July 1921) is a French [[writer]], [[photographer]], [[film director]], [[multimedia]] artist and [[Documentary film|documentary]] maker.

His best known films are ''[[La jetée]]'' ([[1962 in film|1962]]), ''[[A Grin Without a Cat]]'' ([[1977 in film|1977]]), ''[[Sans Soleil]]'' ([[1983 in film|1983]]) and ''[[AK (film)|AK]]'' ([[1985 in film|1985]]), a documentary on the Japanese filmmaker [[Akira Kurosawa]].

==Biography==
Marker was born '''Christian François Bouche-Villeneuve''', in Paris, [[France]], 29 July 1921, yet other sources and himself claim that he was born in [[Ulan Bator]], [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, David, The New Biographical Dictionary of Film - Fourth Edition, Little, Brown (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; (The 1949 edition of ''Le Cœur Net'' specifies his birthday as 22 July.) In [[World War II]] he joined the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis (FTP)]]. After the war he began to write and make films. He traveled to many [[socialist]] countries and documented what he saw in films and books. ''Les statues meurent aussi'' (1953) which he codirected with [[Alain Resnais]] was one of the first anticolonial films. [[Anatole Dauman]] produced his earliest films of Chris Marker and two more later, ''[[Sunday in Peking]]'' and ''[[Letter from Siberia]]''.

He became known internationally for the [[short film]] ''[[La jetée]]'' (1962). It tells of a [[post-apocalyptic science fiction|post-nuclear war]] experiment in [[time travel]] by using a series of filmed photographs developed as a [[photomontage]] of varying pace, with limited narration and sound effects. ''La Jetée'' was the inspiration for [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s 1987 debut live action feature ''[[The Red Spectacles]]''  (and, later for, parts of Oshii's 2001 film ''[[Avalon (2001 film)|Avalon]]'' as well) and also inspired [[Terry Gilliam]]'s ''[[12 Monkeys]]'' (1995). It also inspired many of director [[Mira Nair]]'s shots for the 2003 film ''[[The Namesake (film)|The Namesake]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In 1982 Marker completed ''[[Sans Soleil]]'', stretching the limits of what could be called a [[Documentary film|documentary]]. It is an [[essay]], a [[Film editing|montage]], mixing pieces of documentary with [[fiction]] and philosophical comments, creating an atmosphere of [[dream]] and [[science fiction]]. The main themes are [[Japan]], [[Africa]], [[memory]] and [[travel]]. A sequence in the middle of the film takes place in [[San Francisco]], and heavily references [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.

Beginning with ''Sans Soleil'', he developed a deep interest in [[digital]] [[technology]], which led to his film ''Level 5'' (1996) and ''[[Immemory]]'' (1998, 2008), an interactive multimedia [[CD-ROM]], produced for the [[Centre Pompidou]] (French language version) and from [[Exact Change]] (English version). Marker created a 19 minute multimedia piece in 2005 for The Museum of Modern Art in New York titled ''Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men'' which was influenced by [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem.

Chris Marker lives in Paris and very rarely grants interviews. When asked for a picture of himself, he usually offers a photograph of a cat instead. (Marker was represented in Agnes Varda's 2008 documentary &quot;The Beaches of Agnes&quot; by a cartoon drawing of a cat, speaking in a technologically altered voice.) Marker's own cat is named Guillaume-en-egypte.

In the 2007 Criterion Collection release of ''La Jetée'' and ''Sans Soleil'', Marker included a short essay, &quot;Working on a shoestring budget&quot;.  He confessed to shooting all of ''Sans Soleil'' with a silent film camera and recording all the audio on a primitive audio cassette recorder. Marker also reminds the reader that only one short scene in ''La Jetée'' is of a moving image, as Marker could only borrow a movie camera for one afternoon while working on the film.

'''Cardinal vowels''' are a set of reference vowels used by phoneticians in describing the sounds of languages. For instance, the vowel of the [[English language|English]] word &quot;feet&quot; can be described with reference to cardinal vowel 1, {{IPA|[i]}}, which is the cardinal vowel closest to it.

A cardinal vowel is a [[vowel]] sound produced when the [[tongue]] is in an extreme position, either front or back, high or low. The current system was systematised by [[Daniel Jones (phonetician)|Daniel Jones]] in the early 20th century, though the idea goes back to earlier phoneticians, notably Ellis and Bell.

Three of the cardinal vowels, {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[ɑ]}} and {{IPA|[u]}} have articulatory definitions. [i] is produced with the tongue as far forward and as high in the mouth as is possible (without producing friction), with spread lips. {{IPA|[u]}} is produced with the tongue as far back and as high in the mouth as is possible, with pursed lips. This sound can be approximated by adopting the posture to whistle a very low note, or blow out a candle. {{IPA|[ɑ]}} is produced with the tongue as low and as far back in the mouth as possible. 

The other vowels are 'auditorily equidistant' between these three 'corner vowels', at four degrees of aperture or 'height': close (high tongue position), close-mid, open-mid, and open (low tongue position). The [[Ngwe language]] of [[West Africa]] has been cited as a language with a vowel system that has 8 vowels which are rather similar to the 8 primary cardinal vowels (Ladefoged 1971:67).

These degrees of aperture plus the front-back distinction define 8 reference points on a mixture of articulatory and auditory criteria. These eight vowels are known as the eight 'primary cardinal vowels', and vowels like these are common in the world's languages. 

The lip positions can be reversed with the lip position for the corresponding vowel on the opposite side of the front-back dimension, so that e.g. Cardinal 1 can be produced with the rounding for Cardinal 9, etc.; these are known as 'secondary cardinal vowels'. Sounds such as these are less common in the world's languages. Other vowel sounds are also recognised on the vowel chart of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].

Columbia was settled in [[Pre-Columbian]] times by the [[Mound builder (people)|mound-building]] [[Mississippian culture]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. In 1818, a group of settlers incorporated under the Smithton Land Company purchased over 2,000&amp;nbsp;acres (8&amp;nbsp;km²) and established the village of Smithton near present-day downtown Columbia. In 1821, the settlers moved and re-named the settlement [[Historical Columbia|Columbia]]—a poetic name for the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Switzler | first=William | title=History of Boone County, Missouri | publisher=St. Louis Western Historical Company |year=1882 | pages=150–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of the University of Missouri in 1839 established the city as a center of education and research. Two other institutions of higher education, [[Stephens College]] in 1833 and [[Columbia College (Columbia, Missouri)|Columbia College]] in 1851, were also established within the city.

Located among small [[tributary]] [[valleys]] of the [[Missouri River]], Columbia is roughly equidistant from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. [[Greater St. Louis]] is {{convert|70|mi|km}} to the East, and the [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area]] is {{convert|100|mi|km}} to the West.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Columbia, Missouri}}
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS TOO LONG. PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING ADDITIONS TO THE MAIN &quot;HISTORY OF COLUMBIA, MISSOURI&quot; ARTICLE INSTEAD. --&gt; [[Image:CoMoPano1869.jpg|thumb|right|An aerial view of Columbia's downtown district in 1869. The large building on the right is University of Missouri Academic Hall.]]

The Columbia area was once part of the [[Mississippian culture]] and home to the [[Mound builder (people)|Mound Builders]]. When European explorers arrived, the area was populated by the [[Osage Nation|Osage]] and [[Missouri tribe|Missouri]] Indians.&lt;ref name = &quot;syeszw&quot;/&gt; In 1678, [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle]] claimed all of [[Missouri]] for France. The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] passed by the area on the Missouri River in 1803. In 1806, [[Daniel Boone]] and his sons established a [[salt lick]] {{nowrap|{{convert|40|mi|km|0}}}} northwest of Columbia. [[The Booneslick Trail]] wound from [[Kentucky]] through [[St. Charles, Missouri|St. Charles]] to the lick. In 1818, a group of settlers, incorporated under the Smithton Land Company, purchased over 2,000&amp;nbsp;acres (8&amp;nbsp;km²) and established the village of Smithton less than a mile from current day downtown Columbia.&lt;ref name = &quot;ckbome&quot;/&gt; In 1821, the settlers moved, because of lack of water, across the Flat Branch to the plateau between the Flat Branch and Hinkson creeks in what is now the downtown district. They re-named the settlement [[Historical Columbia|Columbia]]—a popular historical name for the United States.&lt;ref name = &quot;syeszw&quot;/&gt;

The roots of Columbia's three economic foundations—education, medicine, and insurance—can be traced back to incorporation in 1821.&lt;ref name = &quot;ckbome&quot;/&gt; Original plans for the town set aside land for a state university. Columbia College (distinct from today's), later to become The University of Missouri, was founded in 1839. When the state legislature decided to establish a state university, Columbia raised three times as much money as any other competing city&lt;ref name = &quot;skbsjf&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Switzler | first=William | title=History of Boone County, Missouri | publisher=St. Louis Western Historical Company |year=1882 | pages=300–310}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James S. Rollins]] donated the land that is today the Francis Quadrangle.&lt;ref name = &quot;skbsjf&quot;/&gt; Soon other educational institutions were founded in Columbia such as Christian Female College, the first college for women west of the Mississippi, which later became the current [[Columbia College (Columbia, Missouri)|Columbia College]]. In 1833, Columbia Baptist Female College opened, which later became [[Stephens College]]. The city benefited from being a stagecoach stop of the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]] and [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]] trails, and later from the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. In 1822 the first hospital was set up by [[William Jewell]]. In 1830, the first newspaper began; in 1832, the first theater in the state was opened; and in 1835, the state's first agricultural fair was held. By 1839, the population (13,000) and wealth of Boone County was exceeded in Missouri only by that of [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]], which at that time included the [[St. Louis, Missouri|City of St. Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Switzler | first=William | title=History of Boone County, Missouri | publisher=St. Louis Western Historical Company |year=1882 | pages=325–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CoMo1919broadway.jpg|thumb|left|A busy day on Broadway in 1919.]]
Columbia's infrastructure was wholly untouched by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Missouri, as a slave state, had Southern sympathies, but remained in the union. The majority of the city was pro-union,&lt;ref name = &quot;ckbome&quot;/&gt; however, the surrounding agricultural areas of Boone County and the rest of central Missouri were decidedly pro-slavery. Because of this, the University of Missouri became a base from which union troops operated. No battles were fought within the city because the presence of union troop dissuaded the confederate guerrillas from attacking, though several major battles occurred nearby at [[Boonville, Missouri|Boonville]] and [[Centralia, Missouri|Centralia]].

In 1963, Columbia become home to the headquarters of both the [[University of Missouri System]], which today serves over 71,000 students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.umsystem.edu/ums/about/history/| title=History of the University | work=[[University of Missouri System]] | accessdate=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Columbia College (Columbia, Missouri)|Columbia College system]], which today serves about 25,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ccis.edu/about/ | title=Welcome to Columbia College | work=[[Columbia College (Columbia, Missouri)|Columbia College]] | accessdate=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insurance industry also became important to the local economy as several companies established headquarters in Columbia, including [[Shelter Insurance]], [[Missouri Employers Mutual]], and [[Columbia Insurance Group]]. [[State Farm Insurance]] has a regional office in Columbia. In addition, the now defunct Silvey Insurance was once a large local employer. Columbia became a transportation crossroads when [[U.S. Route 63 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 63]] and [[U.S. Route 40 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 40]] (which became present-day [[Interstate 70 (Missouri)|Interstate 70]]) were routed through the city. Soon after the city opened the [[Columbia Regional Airport]]. The latter 20th century saw tremendous growth, and by the end of the century the population was over 80,000 in the city proper.&lt;ref name = &quot;dpmpnc&quot;/&gt;

In early 2006, Columbia embarked on a plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gocolumbiamo.com/Public_Comm/Visioning/visioning_overview.php | title=Imagine Columbia’s Future Visioning Overview | work=City of Columbia | accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; to manage the continued growth as the city nears 100,000 population. The city is today growing especially towards the [[Missouri River]] in southwest Boone County. The downtown district has maintained its status as a cultural center and is undergoing significant development in both residential and commercial sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.komu.com/satellite/SatelliteRender/KOMU.com/ba8a4513-c0a8-2f11-0063-9bd94c70b769/d8d58321-80ce-0971-017d-b4f88f4ea5f5 | title=Columbia Marks a milestone | publisher=KOMU news | last=Haile-Selassie |first=Fanna | date=2007-12-14 | accessdate=2008-08-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080209030215/http://www.komu.com/satellite/SatelliteRender/KOMU.com/ba8a4513-c0a8-2f11-0063-9bd94c70b769/d8d58321-80ce-0971-017d-b4f88f4ea5f5 |archivedate = February 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Missouri, which has tremendous economic impact on the city, experienced record enrollment in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2007/0820-freshmen-enrollment.php | title=MU Freshman Enrollment Surpasses 5,000 | work=University of Missouri News Bureau | accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is undertaking significant construction.

== Geography ==
Columbia, located in the center of Missouri, is {{convert|120|mi|km}} away from both [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], and {{convert|29|mi|km}} north of the state capital [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.medpedsresidency.missouri.edu/columbia_missouri.htm | title=About Columbia| work=MU internal Medicine and Child Health | accessdate=2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is near the [[Missouri River]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chamber.columbia.mo.us/community/about.asp?Maps | title=Maps | work=Columbia Chamber of Commerce | accessdate=2008-01-11|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080209060935/http://chamber.columbia.mo.us/community/about.asp?Maps |archivedate = February 9, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the [[Ozark Plateau]] and the [[Geography of Missouri#Regions|Northern Plains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/ozar/hrs3.htm | title=Early Settlement Rural...Ozark Frontier | work=National Park Service | accessdate=2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trees are mainly [[oak]], [[maple]], and [[hickory]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mdc.mo.gov/forest/IandE/oak_hickory/ | title=Missouri's Oaks and Hickories | work=Missouri Department of Conservation | accessdate=2008-01-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060929053910/http://www.mdc.mo.gov/forest/IandE/oak_hickory/ |archivedate = September 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; common understory trees include [[Eastern Redbud]], Serviceberry, and [[Flowering Dogwood]]. [[Riparian]] areas are forested with mainly American sycamore. Much of the residential area of the city is planted with large native [[shade tree]]s. In Autumn, the changing color of the trees is notable. Most species here are typical of the Eastern Woodland.

=== Topography ===
[[Image:CoMoNature.jpg|thumb|right|The Pinnacles, a natural formation carved by hundreds of years of flowing water, just north of Columbia.]]

The city generally slopes from the highest point in the Northeast to the lowest point in the Southwest towards the Missouri River. Prominent tributaries of the river are Perche Creek, Hinkson Creek, and Flat Branch Creek. Along these, and other creeks in the area can be found large valleys, cliffs, and cave systems such as that in [[Rock Bridge State Park]] just south of the city. These creeks are largely responsible for numerous stream valleys giving Columbia hilly terrain similar to the Ozarks while also having flatland typical of northern Missouri. The city operates several greenbelts with trails and parks throughout the city. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 53.3&amp;nbsp;square miles (138.1&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 53.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (137.5&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.3&amp;nbsp;square miles (0.7&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (0.51%) is water.{{GR|2}}

=== Animal life ===
Large [[mammals]] found in the city include urbanized [[coyotes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mammals/coyote/ | title=Coyote | work=Missouri Department of Conservation | accessdate=2008-01-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060928232433/http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mammals/coyote/ |archivedate = September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous [[whitetail deer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mammals/deer2/ | title=Whitetale deer | work=Missouri Department of Conservation | accessdate=2008-01-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060928232140/http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mammals/deer2/ |archivedate = September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eastern Gray Squirrel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mammals/squirrel/ | title=Eastern Gray Squirrel | work=Missouri Department of Conservation | accessdate=2008-01-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060928232328/http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mammals/squirrel/ |archivedate = September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[rodents]] are abundant, as well as [[Cottontail rabbit]]s and the nocturnal [[Opossum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mdc4.mdc.mo.gov/applications/MDCLibrary/MDCLibrary2.aspx?NodeID=394 | title=Mammals (In Missouri) | work=Missouri Department of Conservation | accessdate=2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Raccoon]]. Large bird species are abundant in parks and include the [[Canada goose]], [[Mallard duck]], as well as shorebirds, including the [[Great Egret]] and [[Great Blue Heron]]. Turkeys are also common in wooded areas and can occasionally be seen on the MKT recreation trail. Populations of [[Bald Eagle]]s are found by the Missouri River. The city is on the [[Mississippi Flyway]], used by migrating birds, and has a large variety of small bird species, common to the eastern U.S. The [[Eurasian Tree Sparrow]], an introduced species, is limited in North America to the counties surrounding St. Louis. Columbia has large areas of forested and open land and many of these areas are home to wildlife.

Frogs are commonly found in the springtime, especially after extensive wet periods. Common species include the [[American toad]] and species of chorus frogs, commonly called &quot;spring peepers&quot; that are found in nearly every pond. Some years have outbreaks of [[cicadas]] or [[ladybugs]]. [[Mosquito]]s and [[houseflies]] are common insect nuisances; because of this, windows are nearly universally fitted with screens, and &quot;screened-in&quot; porches are common in homes of the area.

Columbia has a climate marked by sharp seasonal contrasts in temperature, falling between a [[humid continental]] and [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa/Cfa'', respectively). Monthly daily averages range from {{convert|27.8|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|77.4|°F|1}} in July, and the annual mean is {{convert|54.0|°F|1}}. The temperature exceeds {{convert|90|°F|0}} on an average 36 days per year, and every few years exceeds {{convert|100|°F|0}}, while 5 to 6 nights of below {{convert|0|°F|0}} conditions can be expected.&lt;ref name = NCDC /&gt; Precipitation tends to be greatest and most frequent in spring, when severe weather is also most common. Snow averages {{convert|26|in|cm|0}} per season, and typically falls in light amounts at a time. Extreme temperatures have ranged from {{convert|−26|°F|0}} in February 1899 to {{convert|113|°F}} in July 1954.

== Cityscape ==
[[Image:Tiger hotel.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Columbia]]
Columbia's most commonly recognizable architectural attributes reside downtown and within the university campuses. Widely used icons of the city are the University of Missouri's [[Jesse Hall]] and the [[neo-gothic]] [[Memorial Union (University of Missouri)|Memorial Union]]. The [[David R. Francis Quadrangle]] is an example of [[Thomas Jefferson|Thomas Jefferson's]] [[Jeffersonian architecture|academic village]] concept. There are four [[historic district (United States)|historic districts]] listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] within the city: [[Downtown Columbia, Missouri|Downtown Columbia]], [[East Campus Neighborhood]], [[Francis Quadrangle]], and [[North Ninth Street Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/nrlist.htm | title=Recent Listings | work=[[National Park Service]] | accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The downtown skyline is relatively low and is dominated by the 10-story [[Tiger Hotel]], and the 15-story Paquin Tower.
&lt;!-- This image has been removed until this section grows larger in size.  [[Image:University of Missouri - Memorial Union.jpg|thumb|right|The most prominent example of [[neo-gothic architecture]] in Columbia is the [[Memorial Union (University of Missouri)|Memorial Union Tower]]]] --&gt;

Downtown Columbia is an area of approximately one square mile surrounded by the University of Missouri on the south, Columbia College on the north, and Stephens College to the east. The area serves as Columbia's financial and business district and is the topic of a large initiative to draw tourism, which includes plans to capitalize on the area's historic architecture, and bohemian characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.downtown.org/index.html | title=Discover The District | work=The District | accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's historic residential core lies in a ring around downtown, extending especially to the west along Broadway, and south into the East Campus neighborhoods. Columbia can be divided into roughly 36 neighborhoods and subdivisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gocolumbiamo.com/Public_Comm/Neighborhood_Associations/documents/NAContactList.pdf |format=PDF| title=Columbia, Missouri Neighborhood Associations | work=City of Columbia| accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's most dense commercial areas are primarily located along [[Interstate 70 (Missouri)|Interstate 70]], [[U.S. Route 63 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 63]], Stadium Blvd, Grindstone Pkwy, and the downtown area.

=== Demographics ===

In 2000, the city had a day time population of 106,487.&lt;ref name = &quot;kabzht&quot;/&gt; As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 84,531 people, 33,689 households, and 17,282 families residing in the city.

There were 33,689 households out of which 26.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.2% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 10.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.7% were non-families. 33.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 6.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.26 and the average family size was 2.92.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://columbiamo.areaconnect.com/statistics.htm | title=Columbia population and demographics | work=Area Connect | accessdate=2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the city the population was spread out with 19.7% under the age of 18,&lt;ref name=&quot;demo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.citytowninfo.com/places/missouri/columbia | title=Columbia, Missouri | work=City Town Info | accessdate=2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 26.7% from 18 to 24, 28.7% from 25 to 44, 16.2% from 45 to 64, and 8.6% who were 65 years of age or older.&lt;ref name=&quot;demo&quot;/&gt; The median age was 27 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;demo&quot;/&gt; For every 100 females, there were 91.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.1 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $33,729,&lt;ref name=&quot;epo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/incomeOverview.php?locIndex=20205 | title=Columbia, MO | work=Epodunk | accessdate=2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the median income for a family was $52,288.&lt;ref name=&quot;demo&quot;/&gt; Males had a median income of $34,710 versus $26,694 for females.

However, traditional measures of income and poverty can be misleading when applied to cities with high student populations, such as Columbia.

== Economy ==
The economy of Columbia is historically dominated by education, healthcare, and the insurance industry.&lt;ref name = &quot;ckbome&quot;/&gt; Jobs in government are also common, either in Columbia or a half-hour away in [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]].&lt;ref name = &quot;vffbdr&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbiaredi.com/area_data/LargestEmployers.php | title=Largest Employers | work=Columbia REDI | accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Commutes into the city are also common and in 2000 the city had a day time population of 106,487.&lt;ref name = &quot;kabzht&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.missourieconomy.org/pdfs/daytime_population.pdf |format=PDF| title=Daytime Population | work=Missouri Economic Research Center | accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Columbia Regional Airport]] and the Missouri River [[Rocheport, Missouri|Port of Rocheport]] connect the region with trade and transportation. The University of Missouri is by far the city's largest employer.&lt;ref name = &quot;vffbdr&quot;/&gt;

The economy of the metro area is slightly larger than that of the [[Bahamas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.missourieconomy.org/newsletter/gmp.htm | title=Economies of Missouri Metros Larger than Many Countries | work=Missouri Economic Research and Development | accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a Gross Metropolitan Product of $5.84 billion in 2004, Columbia's economy makes up 2.9% of the Gross State Product of Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://usmayors.org/metroeconomies/Top100_2006.pdf |format=PDF| title=The Role of Metro Areas in the U.S. Economy | work=U.S. Conference of Mayors |page=119 |date=March 2006 |accessdate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insurance corporations headquartered in Columbia include [[Shelter Insurance]], and [[Columbia Insurance Group]]. Other organizations include [[MFA Incorporated]], [[Missouri State High School Activities Association]] and [[MFA Oil]].

== Government and politics ==
{{Main|Government of Columbia, Missouri}}

[[Image:CourthouseCoMo.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Boone County Courthouse (Missouri)|Boone County Courthouse]] within the Boone County Government Center]]
The City of Columbia's current government was established by a [[Home rule municipality|home rule charter]] adopted by voters on November 11, 1974, which established a [[Council-manager government]] that invested power in the [[City Council]]. The City Council is made up of seven members - six elected by each of Columbia's six [[ward (politics)|wards]], plus an [[at-large]] council member, the Mayor, who is elected by all city voters. All members of the council, none of whom receive a salary for their work, are elected to staggered three-year terms. The Mayor, in addition to being a voting member of the City Council, is recognized as the head of city government for ceremonial purposes. Chief executive authority is invested in a [[city manager]], who oversees the day-to-day operations of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gocolumbiamo.com/Council/Columbia_Code_of_Ordinances/Chapter_99/01.html | title=Columbia Code of Ordinances | work=City of Columbia | accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbia is the county seat of Boone County, and the county court and government center are located there. The City is located in the ninth U.S. [[Congressional district]]. The 19th [[Missouri State Senate]] district covers all of Boone County. There are five [[Missouri House of Representatives]] districts (9, 21, 23, 24, 25) in the city. Columbia is home to a plethora of attorneys and serves as a legal hub and testing grounds for many new laws and grassroot efforts. The principle law enforcement agency is the [[Columbia Police Department]], with the [[Columbia Fire Department]] providing fire protection. [[The Public Service Joint Communications Center]] coordinates efforts between the two organizations as well as the [[Boone County Fire Protection District]] which operates [[Urban Search and Rescue Missouri Task Force 1]].

&lt;br /&gt;In 2007, a Transit Master Plan was created to address the future transit needs of the city and county with a comprehensive plan to add infrastructure in three key phases.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gocolumbiamo.com/PublicWorks/Transportation/documents/transitmasterplan2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The five to 15-year plan intends to add service along the southwest, southeast and northeast sections of Columbia and develop alternative transportation models for Boone County.
&lt;br /&gt;Fares are $1.00 for adults, and $.50 for children 5-11, for students with valid I.D, for handicapped/Medicare recipients, and for senior citizens age 65 and up. Columbia Transit offers ''FASTPass'' electronic fare cards and issues electronic transfers for accuracy and convenience. Para-transit fares are $2.00 for a one-way trip, and the service area includes all of Columbia. &lt;br /&gt;Buses operate Monday through Saturday, from 6:25am to 6:25pm Monday-Wednesday, 6:25am to 10:25pm Thursday and Friday, and from 1:00am to 7:30pm on Saturday.

'''Charlton Athletic Football Club''' (also known as '''The Addicks''') is a professional [[the Football League|English Football league]] club based in [[Charlton, London|Charlton]], in the [[London Borough of Greenwich]], England. The club was founded on 9 June 1905, when a number of youth clubs in the southeast London area, including East Street Mission and Blundell Mission, combined to form Charlton Athletic Football Club. 

The club is based at [[The Valley (London)|The Valley]], [[Charlton, London|Charlton]], where it has played since 1919, apart from one year in [[Catford]], during [[1923-24 in English football|1923–24]], and seven years at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] between 1985 and 1992. Since then they've returned to The Valley.

Charlton turned professional in 1920 and first entered [[the Football League]] in 1921. Since then they have had four separate periods in the top flight of [[Football in England|English football]]: between 1936 and 1957; 1986 and 1990; 1998 and 1999, and 2000 to 2007. Historically, Charlton's most successful period was the 1930s, when the club's highest league finishes were recorded, including runners-up of the league in 1937, and after World War II, when the club reached the [[FA Cup]] final twice, winning in [[FA Cup Final 1947|1947]]. After being relegated from the Championship in 2008–09, they will play in [[Football League One]] as of the [[2011-12 Football League One|2011–12]] season.

==History==


===Early history===
Charlton Athletic were formed on 9&amp;nbsp;June 1905&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; by a group of 15- to 17-year-old boys in an area of Charlton which is no longer residential, near to the present-day site of the [[Thames Barrier]]. In the club's early years its progress was hampered by the nearby presence of [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal F.C.]] (now Arsenal), which was one of the largest clubs in the country, and Charlton spent the years before the First World War playing in local leagues. Woolwich Arsenal's move to North London in 1913 gave Charlton an opportunity to develop, and they became a senior side by joining the Lewisham League.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;&gt;{{cite news
| title = Charlton Athletic – Club History
| url = http://www.cafc.co.uk/history.ink
| publisher = Charlton Athletic FC
| date = 
| accessdate = 5 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, they joined the Kent League for one season (1919–20) before becoming professional, appointing [[Walter Rayner]] as the first full-time manager. They were accepted by the Southern League and played just a single season (1920–21) before being voted into [[the Football League]]. Charlton's first Football League match was against [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] in August 1921, which they won 1–0. In 1923 it was proposed that Charlton merged with Catford Southend to create a larger team with bigger support.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 2001, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1923–24 season Charlton played in Catford at [[The Mount stadium]] and wore the colours of &quot;The Enders&quot;, light and dark blue vertical stripes. However, the move fell through and the Addicks returned to the Charlton area in 1924, returning to the traditional red and white colours in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 2001, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;  Charlton finished second bottom in the Football League in 1926 and were forced to apply for re-election which was successful. Three years later the Addicks won the [[Football League Division Three|Division Three]] championship in 1929&lt;ref name=&quot;England 1928/29&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Seed, an ex-miner who had made a career as a footballer despite suffering the effects of poison-gas in the first war, remains the most successful manager in Charlton's history and he is commemorated in the name of a stand at the Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Jimmy Seed, Soccer From the Inside (Thorsons Publishers, 1947), p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Seed was an innovative thinker about the game at a time when tactical formations were still relatively unsophisticated. He later recalled &quot;a simple scheme that enabled us to pull several matches out of the fire&quot; during the 1934-35 season: when the team was in trouble &quot;the centre-half was to forsake his defensive role and go up into the attack to add weight to the five forwards.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Seed, Soccer From the Inside, p.66.&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation Seed brought to the team proved effective and the Addicks gained successive promotions from the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] between 1934 and 1936.&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; Charlton finally secured promotion to the First Division by beating local rivals West Ham in front of 41,254 fans at the Valley, with their valiant centre-half John Oakes playing on despite concusion and a broken nose.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Cameron, Home and Away with Chalton Athletic 1920-2004 (2004), p.69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Charlton finished runners up in the First Division,&lt;ref name=&quot;1936/1937 English Division 1 (old) Table&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Post-war history===
Charlton were finalists in the 1946 [[FA Cup]], but lost 4–1 to [[FA Cup Final 1946|FA Cup Final 1946]]  [[Derby County F.C.|Derby]]. Chalrton's Bert Turner scored an own goal in the eightieth minute before equalising for the Addicks a minute later to take them into extra time, but they conceded three further goals in the extra period.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Home and Away with Charlton Athletic 1910-2004, p.112.&lt;/ref&gt; When the full league programme resumed in 1946-47 Charlton could finish only 19th in the First Division, just above the relegation spots. But they made amends with their performance in the FA Cup, reaching the final once again. This time they were succesful, beating [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] [[FA Cup Final 1947|1–0]], [[Chris Duffy (footballer)|Chris Duffy]] scoring the only goal of the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;1947 FA Cup Final&quot;&gt;{{cite news

| url = http://www.cafc.co.uk/personality.ink?page=7770
| publisher = Charlton Athletic FC
| date = 
| accessdate = 5 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period of renewed football attendances, Charlton became one of only eleven English football teams to average over 40,000 as their attendance during a full season.&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; The Valley was the largest football ground in the League, drawing crowds in excess of 70,000.&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; However, in the 1950s little investment was made either for players or to The Valley, hampering the club's growth. In 1956, the then board undermined Jimmy Seed and then sacked, and Charlton were relegated the following year.&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; 

From the late 1950s until the early 1970s, Charlton remained a mainstay of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] before relegation to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in 1972&lt;ref name=&quot;England 1971/72&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though it did not feel like it, this was a turning point in the club's history leading to a period of turbulence and change including further promotion and exile. A change in management and shortly after a change in club ownership&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 2001, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; led to severe problems, such as the reckless signing of former [[European Footballer of the Year]] [[Allan Simonsen]], and the club looked like it would go out of business.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton 2001, pp.142-150&lt;/ref&gt;

===The &quot;wilderness&quot; years===
In 1984 financial matters came to a head and the club went into administration, to be reformed as Charlton Athletic (1984) Ltd.&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; But the club's finances were still far from secure, and they were forced to leave the Valley just after the start of the 1985–86 season after its safety was criticised by Football League officials.
The club began to groundshare with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] at [[Selhurst Park]]&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; and this arrangement looked to be for the long-term, as Charlton did not have enough funds to revamp the Valley to meet safety requirements.

Despite the move away from the Valley, Charlton were promoted to the First Division as Second Division runners-up at the end of 1985–86,&lt;ref name=&quot;England 1985/86&quot;&gt;{{cite web
| author = Felton, Paul

Eventually, however, the Addicks fell to relegation in 1990 after a dismal season.&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; Manager [[Lennie Lawrence]] remained in charge for one more season before he accepted an offer to take charge of [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. He was replaced by joint player-managers [[Alan Curbishley]] and [[Steve Gritt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlton Athletic - Club History&quot;/&gt; The pair had unexpected success in their first season finishing just outside the play-offs, and [[1992-93 in English football|1992–93]] began promisingly and Charlton looked good bets for promotion in the new Division One (the new name of the old Second Division following the formation of the [[Premier League]]). However, the club was forced to sell players such as [[Rob Lee]] to help pay for a return to The Valley, which eventually happened in December 1992.

There was a tragedy at the club late in the 1992–93 season. Defender [[Tommy Caton]], who had been out of action due to injury since January 1991, announced his retirement from playing on medical advice in March 1993, having failed to recover full fitness, and he died suddenly at the end of the following month, aged just 30 years.

An insight into life at the football club in this period is provided by Left Foot Forward: A Year in the Life of a Journeyman Footballer, a highly-praised account of the 1994-95 season written in diary form by Charlton forward Garry Nelson.&lt;ref&gt;Garry Nelson, Left Foot Forward (Headline, 1995). The book was shortlisted for William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award.&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;ref name = &quot;Charlton 1 - 0 Portsmouth&quot;/&gt;

===Back to The Valley===
In 1995, new chairman [[Richard Murray]] appointed Alan Curbishley as sole manager of Charlton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alan Curbishley profile&quot;&gt;{{cite news
| title = Alan Curbishley profile
| url = http://www.cafc.co.uk/AlanCurbishley.ink
| publisher = Charlton Athletic FC
| date = 
| accessdate = 5 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under his sole leadership Charlton made an appearance in the playoffs in 1996 but were eliminated by Crystal Palace in the semi-finals and the following season brought a disappointing 15th place finish.  [[1997-98 in English football|1997–98]] was Charlton's best season for years. They reached the Division One playoff final and battled against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in a thrilling game which ended with a 4–4 draw after extra time. Charlton won 7–6 on penalties,&lt;ref name=&quot;1998 play-off final&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Charlton's first Premier League campaign began promisingly (they went top after two games) but they were unable to keep up their good form and were soon battling relegation. The battle was lost on the final day of the season but the club's board kept faith in Curbishley, confident that they could bounce back. And Curbishley rewarded the chairman's loyalty with the Division 
One title in 2000 which signalled a return to the Premier League.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlton bounce back in style&quot;&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate = 5 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the club's return, Curbishley proved an astute spender and by 2003 he had succeeded in establishing Charlton in the top flight. In the 2003–04 season, Charlton spent much of the campaign challenging for a [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] place, but a late-season slump in form, combined with the sale of star player [[Scott Parker (footballer)|Scott Parker]] to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], left Charlton in 7th place,&lt;ref name=&quot;Curbishley basks in glory&quot;&gt;{{cite news

However, Charlton failed to build on this achievement and Curbishley left two years afterwards in 2006, after 15 years as manager, with the club still established as a solid mid table side.&lt;ref name=&quot;Curbishley to leave Charlton&quot;&gt;{{cite news

In May 2006, [[Iain Dowie]] was named as Curbishley's successor,&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlton unveil Dowie as new boss&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Charlton's return to [[The Championship|the second tier of English football]] was a disappointment, with their promotion campaign tailing off to an 11th place finish. Early in the following season the Addicks were linked with a foreign takeover,&lt;ref name=&quot;Group eyes £50m Charlton takeover&quot;&gt;{{cite news

More recently, on 10 October 2008 Charlton received an indicative offer for the club from a Dubai-based diversified investment company. However, the deal later fell through. The full significance of this soon became apparent as the club recorded net losses of over £13&amp;nbsp;million in the past financial year.

On 22 November 2008 Charlton suffered a 2–5 loss to Sheffield United at home, which meant that the club had gone eight successive games without a win and had slipped into the relegation zone—particularly disastrous considering they were among the pre-season favourites for promotion. Hours after the game, Alan Pardew left Charlton by mutual consent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pardew and Charlton part company&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Charlton continued their poor run of form to go 18 games without a win, a new club record, before finally achieving a 1–0 away victory over [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in an FA Cup Third Round replay. They then went on to beat Crystal Palace 1–0 at the Valley on 27 January to achieve their first league win under [[Phil Parkinson]], whose contract was made permanent despite the lack of progress in the league. Charlton's relegation from the Championship was all but confirmed on Easter Monday (13 April) when, despite picking up a point in a 0–0 draw at [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry]], they found themselves 12 points from safety with four games remaining. With a vastly inferior goal difference and with the two teams directly above them ([[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]) still having to play each other, it was effectively an impossible task for Charlton to avoid relegation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coventry 0-0 Charlton&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Parkinson had spent less than any other manager on purchasing players since Lennie Lawrence in the 1980s and was able to maintain a top six status despite only having the opportunity to bring in lower level players on loan. The new owners, however, decided to remove both Parkinson and Charlton legend Mark Kinsella, intending to replace them with an as yet unknown team. Another Charlton legend, [[Chris Powell]] was appointed manager of the club in January, winning his first game in charge 2-0 over Plymouth at the Valley, Charlton's first win since November. Powell's bright start continued with a further three victories, before running into a dreadful downturn which saw the club go 11 games in succession without a win. Yet the fans' respect for Powell saw him come under remarkable little criticism. The club's fortunes picked up towards the end of the season, but leaving them far short of the playoffs.

The club's first ground was Siemens Meadow (1905–1907), a patch of rough ground by the River Thames. This was over-shadowed by the now demolished [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] Telegraph Works. Then followed [[Woolwich Common]] (1907–1908), Pound Park (1908–1913), and Angerstein Lane (1913–1915). After the end of the First World War, a chalk quarry known as the Swamps was identified as Charlton's new ground, and in the summer of 1919 work began to create the level playing area and remove debris from the site.&lt;ref name = &quot;Details about Charlton Athletic&quot;/&gt; The first match at this site, now known as the club's current ground The Valley, was in September 1919. Charlton stayed at The Valley until 1923, when the club moved to [[The Mount stadium]] in [[Catford]] as part of a proposed merger with Catford Southend Football Club. However, after this move collapsed in 1924 Charlton returned to The Valley.

During the 1930s and 40s, significant improvements were made to the ground, making it one of the largest in the country at that time.&lt;ref name = &quot;Details about Charlton Athletic&quot;/&gt; In 1938 the highest attendance to date at the ground was recorded at over 75,000 for a [[FA Cup]] match against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. During the 1940s and 50s the attendance was often above 40,000, and Charlton had one of the largest support bases in the country. However, after the club's relegation little investment was made in The Valley as it fell into decline.

In the 1980s matters came to a head as the ownership of the club and The Valley was divided. The large East Terrace had been closed down by the authorities after the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] and the ground's owner wanted to use part of the site for housing. In September 1985, Charlton made the controversial move to ground-share with South London neighbours [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] at [[S
