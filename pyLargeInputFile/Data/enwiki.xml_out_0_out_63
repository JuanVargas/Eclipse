The interactions among musicians from different ethnic groups produced music unique to this region of [[North America]]. [[Appalachian]] [[String band (American music)|string band]]s of the early 20th century primarily consisted of the fiddle, guitar, and banjo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shoppbs.org/sm-pbs-the-appalachians-dvd--pi-2048969.html#Details |title=Shoppbs.org |publisher=Shoppbs.org |date=2009-02-16 |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early country music along with early recorded country music is often referred to as [[old-time music]].

According to [[Bill Malone]] in ''Country Music U.S.A'', country music was “introduced to the world as a southern phenomenon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Bill. ''Country Music U.S.A.'' Austin: University of Texas Press, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In the South, folk music was a combination of cultural strains, combining musical traditions of a variety of ethnic groups in the region. For example, some instrumental pieces from Anglo-British and Irish immigrants were the basis of folk songs and ballads that form what is now known as [[old time music]], from which country music descended. It is commonly thought that British and Irish folk music influenced the development of old time music. British and Irish arrivals to the Southern U.S. included immigrants from Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and England.

Often, when many people think or hear country music, they think of it as a creation of European-Americans. However, a great deal of style—and of course, the banjo, a major instrument in most early American folk songs—came from African Americans. One of the reasons country music was created by African-Americans, as well as European-Americans, is because blacks and whites in rural communities in the south often worked and played together, just as recollected by [[DeFord Bailey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/deford/music/influences.html |title=PBS.org |publisher=PBS.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the PBS documentary, ''DeFord Bailey:  A Legend Lost''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/deford/ |title=PBS.org |publisher=PBS.org |date=2005-02-14 |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 19th century, several [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant]] groups from [[Europe]], most notably from [[Ireland]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]], and [[Italy]] moved to [[Texas]]. These groups interacted with [[Mexican American|Mexican]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], and U.S. communities that were already established in Texas. As a result of this cohabitation and extended contact, Texas has developed unique cultural traits that are rooted in the culture of all of its founding communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/CC/xbc3.html |title=Texas Handbook on Line |publisher=Tshaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1920s==
Local performers from Atlanta and Fort Worth were being played on radio stations in 1922. Along with local performers, barn-dance programs became popular among radio stations as well. Some record companies in Georgia turned away early artists such as Fiddlin' John Carson; while others realized that his music would fit perfectly with the lifestyle of the country's agricultural employees.&lt;ref&gt;Richard, Crawford,. America's musical life a history. New York: Norton, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercial recording of what was considered country music was &quot;Sallie Gooden&quot; by fiddlist [[Eck Robertson|A.C. (Eck) Robertson]] in 1922 for Victor Records. [[Columbia Records]] began issuing records with &quot;hillbilly&quot; music (series 15000D &quot;Old Familiar Tunes&quot;) as early as 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.78discography.com/COL15000D.htm 78discography.com] ''The Online Discography Project''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many &quot;hillbilly&quot; musicians, such as [[Cliff Carlisle]], recorded blues songs throughout the decade&lt;ref&gt;Country Music Originals - The Legends and the Lost. Tony Russell. 2007.

[[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and the [[Carter Family]] are widely considered to be important early country musicians. Their songs were first captured at a [[Bristol sessions|historic recording session]] in [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]] on August 1, 1927, where [[Ralph Peer]] was the talent scout and sound recordist.&lt;ref&gt;Country Music Originals - The Legends and the Lost.

(film)]]'' depicts a similar occurrence in the same timeframe.

Rodgers fused hillbilly country, gospel, jazz, blues, pop, cowboy, and folk; and many of his best songs were his compositions, including “Blue Yodel”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpdiscography.com/r/Rodgers/jimmie-sp.htm |title=LPdiscography.com |publisher=LPdiscography.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; which sold over a million records and established Rodgers as the premier singer of early country music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alamhof.org/rodgersj.htm Alamhof.org]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nothing But the Blues 1993, White Country Blues by Charles Wolfe page 233&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1927, and for the next 17 years the Carters recorded some 300 old-time ballads, traditional tunes, country songs and Gospel hymns, all representative of America's southeastern folklore and heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southernmusic.net/carterfamily.htm Southernmusic.net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], The Carter Family.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1930s&amp;ndash;1940s ==
One effect of the [[Great Depression]] was to reduce the number of records that could be sold. Radio, and broadcasting, became a popular source of entertainment, and &quot;barn dance&quot; shows featuring country music were started all over the South, as far north as Chicago, and as far west as California.
[[File:Roy Acuff.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Roy Acuff]]]]

The most important was the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', aired starting in 1925 by [[WSM (AM)|WSM-AM]] in Nashville to the present day. Some of the early stars on the ''Opry'' were [[Uncle Dave Macon]], [[Roy Acuff]] and African American harmonica player DeFord Bailey. WSM's 50,000 watt signal (1934) could often be heard across the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=code:v_farquharson@kshira_interactive and j_nowicki@kshira_interactive design:k_wilson@framewerk |url=http://www.pbs.org/americanrootsmusic/pbs_arm_episode_summaries.html |title=American Roots Music : Episode Summaries |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many musicians performed and recorded songs in any number of styles. [[Moon Mullican]], for example, played Western swing, but also recorded songs that can be called rockabilly. [[Bill Haley]] sang cowboy songs, and was at one time a cowboy yodeler. Haley became most famous as an early player of rock n roll, adding [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]-stylings to his environment, thus creating a sound that was very much his own. Between 1947 and 1949, country crooner [[Eddy Arnold]] placed eight songs in the top 10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_index.jsp Billboard.com] ''Billboard.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singing cowboys and Western swing ==
{{Main|Western music (North America)}}
During the 1930s and 1940s, cowboy songs, or Western music, which had been recorded since the 1920s, were popularized by films made in Hollywood. Some of the popular [[singing cowboy]]s from the era were [[Gene Autry]], the [[Sons of the Pioneers]] and [[Roy Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NAME: |url=http://www.roughstock.com/history/cowboy.html |title=Roughstock's History of Country Music - Cowboy Music |publisher=Roughstock.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And it wasn't only cowboys; cowgirls contributed to the sound in various family groups. [[Patsy Montana]] opened the door for female artists with her history making song &quot;I Want To Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart&quot;. This would begin a movement toward opportunities for women to have successful solo careers.

[[Bob Wills]] was another country musician from the Lower Great Plains who had become very popular as the leader of a “hot string band,” and who also appeared in [[Western (genre)|Hollywood Westerns]]. His mix of country and [[jazz]], which started out as dance hall music, would become known as [[Western swing]]. [[Spade Cooley]] and [[Tex Williams]] also had very popular bands and appeared in films. At its height, Western swing rivaled the popularity of other [[big band]] jazz.

=== Changing instrumentation ===
Drums were scorned by early country musicians as being &quot;too loud&quot; and &quot;not pure,&quot; but by 1935 Western swing [[big band]] leader Bob Wills had added drums to the Texas Playboys. In the mid 1940s, the Grand Ole Opry did not want the Playboys’ drummer to appear on stage. Although drums were commonly used by rockabilly groups by 1955, the less-conservative-than-the-Grand Ole Opry ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' kept its infrequently used drummer back stage as late as 1956. By the early 1960s, however, it was rare that a country band didn't have a drummer.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/experience-museum-programs-school-instruments.aspx Instruments | Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Nashville, Tennessee&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bob Wills was one of the first country musicians known to have added an electric guitar to his band, in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://takecountryback.com/reviews/merlebobwills.htm Takecountryback.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Merle Haggard - Bob Wills&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later (1948) [[Arthur &quot;Guitar Boogie&quot; Smith|Arthur Smith]] achieved top 10 US country chart success with his MGM Records recording of &quot;[[Guitar Boogie (song)|Guitar Boogie]]&quot;, which crossed over to the US pop chart, introducing many people to the potential of the electric guitar.
For several decades Nashville session players preferred the warm tones of the Gibson and Gretsch archtop electrics, but a “hot” Fender style, utilizing guitars which became available beginning in the early 1950s, eventually prevailed as the signature guitar sound of country.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empsfm.org/exhibitions/index.asp?categoryID=129&amp;ccID=132 Empsfm.org &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], exhibitions - online features&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hillbilly boogie ===
Country musicians began recording [[boogie woogie|boogie]] in 1939, shortly after it had been played at Carnegie Hall, when [[Johnny Barfield]] recorded &quot;Boogie Woogie.&quot; The trickle of what was initially called hillbilly boogie, or okie boogie (later to be renamed country boogie), became a flood beginning in late 1945. One notable release from this period was the [[Delmore Brothers]]' &quot;Freight Train Boogie,&quot; considered to be part of the combined evolution of country music and blues towards [[rockabilly]]. In 1948, [[Arthur &quot;Guitar Boogie&quot; Smith]] achieved top ten US country chart success with his MGM Records recordings of &quot;[[Guitar Boogie (song)|Guitar Boogie]]&quot; and &quot;Banjo Boogie,&quot; with the former crossing over to the US pop charts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Arthur-Smith.html Oldies.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Arthur Smith Biography.&lt;/ref&gt; Other country boogie artists included [[Merrill Moore]] and [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]]. The hillbilly boogie period lasted into the 1950s and remains one of many subgenres of country into the 21st century.

=== Bluegrass, folk and gospel ===
[[File:Clyde J Foley.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Red Foley]]]]

By the end of [[World War II]], &quot;mountaineer&quot; string band music known as [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] had emerged when [[Bill Monroe]] joined with [[Lester Flatt]] and [[Earl Scruggs]], introduced by Roy Acuff at the Grand Ole Opry. Gospel music, too, remained a popular component of country music. [[Red Foley]], the biggest country star following World War II, had one of the first million-selling gospel hits (&quot;[[Peace In The Valley]]&quot;) and also sang boogie, blues and rockabilly.

In the post-war period, country music was called &quot;folk&quot; in the trades, and &quot;hillbilly&quot; within the industry.

=== Honky tonk ===
Another type of stripped down and raw music with a variety of moods and a basic ensemble of guitar, bass, dobro or steel guitar (and later) drums became popular, especially among poor white southerners. It became known as [[Honkey tonk#Honky tonk music|honky tonk]] and had its roots in Texas. [[Bob Wills]] and His Texas Playboys personified this music which has been described as &quot;a little bit of this, and a little bit of that, a little bit of black and a little bit of white...just loud enough to keep you from thinking too much and to go right on ordering the whiskey.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Workin 1999. page 135&quot;&gt;Workin' Man Blues - Country Music in California. Gerald W. Haslan. [[University of California Press]]. 1999. page 135.

Williams' influence in particular would prove to be enormous, inspiring many of the pioneers of rock and roll, such as Elvis Presley and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], as well as [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Ike Turner]], while providing a framework for emerging honky tonk talents like [[George Jones]]. [[Webb Pierce]] was the top-charting country artist of the 1950s, with 13 of his singles spending 113 weeks at number one. He charted 48 singles during the decade; 31 reached the top ten and 26 reached the top four.

=== Rockabilly ===
{{Main|Rockabilly}}
Rockabilly was most popular with country fans in the 1950s, and 1956 could be called the year of [[rockabilly]] in country music. Rockabilly was a mixture of rock-and-roll and hillbilly music. During this period Elvis Presley converted over to country music. He played a huge role in the music industry during this time. The number two, three and four songs on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' charts for that year were [[Elvis Presley]], &quot;[[Heartbreak Hotel]]&quot;; [[Johnny Cash]], &quot;[[I Walk the Line]]&quot;; and [[Carl Perkins]], &quot;[[Blue Suede Shoes]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+Country+Songs&amp;g=Year-end+Singles&amp;year=1956 |title=Billboard.com |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JohnnyCash1969.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Johnny Cash]]]]
Cash and Presley placed songs in the top 5 in 1958 with No. 3 &quot;Guess Things Happen That Way/Come In, Stranger&quot; by Cash, and No. 5 by Presley &quot;Don't/I Beg Of You.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+Country+Songs&amp;g=Year-end+Singles&amp;year=1958 Billboard.com] ''Billboard.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Presley acknowledged the influence of rhythm and blues artists and his style, saying &quot;The colored folk been singin' and playin' it just the way I'm doin' it now, man for more years than I know.&quot; But he also said, &quot;My stuff is just hopped-up country.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Workin 1999. page 135&quot;/&gt;
Within a few years, many rockabilly musicians returned to a more mainstream style or had defined their own unique style.

Country music gained national television exposure through ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' on ABC-TV and radio from 1955–1960 from [[Springfield, Missouri]]. The program showcased top stars including several rockabilly artists, some from the [[Ozarks]]. As Webb Pierce put it in 1956, &quot;Once upon a time, it was almost impossible to sell country music in a place like New York City.  Nowadays, television takes us everywhere, and country music records and sheet music sell as well in large cities as anywhere else.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, Art &quot;Dynamo - Country Style&quot; (1956), ''TV Guide'', p, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 1950s saw the emergence of the [[Lubbock sound]], but by the end of the decade, backlash as well as traditional artists such as [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], [[Marty Robbins]], and [[Johnny Horton]] began to shift the industry away from the rock n' roll influences of the mid-50s.

=== The Nashville and countrypolitan sounds ===
{{Main|Nashville sound}}
Beginning in the mid 1950s, and reaching its peak during the early 1960s, the Nashville sound turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Under the direction of producers such as [[Chet Atkins]], [[Owen Bradley]], and later [[Billy Sherrill]], the sound brought country music to a diverse audience and helped revive country as it emerged from a commercially fallow period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/floyd-cramer |title=Rockhall.com |publisher=Rockhall.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jim Reeves.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Jim Reeves]]]]
This subgenre was notable for borrowing from 1950s pop stylings: a prominent and &quot;smooth&quot; vocal, backed by a string section and vocal chorus. Instrumental soloing was de-emphasized in favor of trademark &quot;licks&quot;. Leading artists in this genre included [[Patsy Cline]], [[Jim Reeves]] and [[Eddy Arnold]]. The &quot;slip note&quot; piano style of session musician [[Floyd Cramer]] was an important component of this style.

Nashville's pop song structure became more pronounced and it morphed into what was called [[Countrypolitan#Countrypolitan|countrypolitan]]. Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s. Top artists included [[Tammy Wynette]] and [[Charlie Rich]].

=== Country soul - crossover===
{{Main|Country soul}}
In 1962, [[Ray Charles]] surprised the pop world by turning his attention to country and western music, topping the charts and rating number three for the year on ''Billboard's'' pop chart&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=The+Billboard+Hot+100&amp;g=Year-end+Singles&amp;year=1962 |title=Billboard.com |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the &quot;[[I Can't Stop Loving You]]&quot; single, and recording the landmark album ''[[Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music]]''.

=== The Bakersfield sound ===
{{Main|Bakersfield sound}}
Another genre of country music grew out of hardcore honky tonk with elements of [[Western swing]] and originated {{convert|112|mi|km|0}} north-northwest of [[Los Angeles]] in [[Bakersfield, California]]. Influenced by one-time West Coast residents [[Bob Wills]] and [[Lefty Frizzell]], by 1966 it was known as the [[Bakersfield sound]]. It relied on electric instruments and amplification, in particular the [[Telecaster]] electric guitar, more than other subgenres of country of the era, and can be described as having a sharp, hard, driving, no-frills, edgy flavor. Leading practitioners of this style were [[Buck Owens]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Tommy Collins (country music)|Tommy Collins]], [[Dwight Yoakam]] and [[Wynn Stewart]], each of whom had his own style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/haggard_merle/bio.jhtml |title=Merle Haggard : Biography |publisher=CMT.com |date=1937-04-06 |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buckowens.com/aboutbuck18.html Buckowens.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Buck Owen's Crystal Palace: About Buck&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Country rock ===
{{Main|Country rock}}
The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres. In the aftermath of the [[British Invasion]], many desired a return to the &quot;old values&quot; of rock n' roll. At the same time there was a lack of enthusiasm in the country sector for Nashville-produced music. What resulted was a crossbred genre known as [[country rock]].[[File:Gram Parsons promo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Gram Parsons]] influenced [[rock music]]ians from [[The Rolling Stones]] to [[The Byrds]] in the late 1960s]]

Early innovators in this new style of music in the 60s and 70s included rock n' roll icon band [[The Byrds]] and its spin-off [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] (both featuring [[Gram Parsons]]), guitarist [[Clarence White]], [[Michael Nesmith]] ([[Monkees]] and [[First National Band]]), [[the Grateful Dead]], [[Neil Young]], [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen|Commander Cody]], [[The Allman Brothers]], [[The Marshall Tucker Band]], [[Poco]], [[Buffalo Springfield]], and [[Eagles (band)|The Eagles]] among many. [[The Rolling Stones]] also got into the act with songs like &quot;[[Honky Tonk Women]]&quot; and &quot;[[Dead Flowers (The Rolling Stones song)|Dead Flowers]]&quot;.

Described by [[Allmusic]] as the &quot;father of country-rock&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5109|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic.com], Gram Parsons: Overview&lt;/ref&gt; Gram Parsons' work in the early '70s was acclaimed for its purity and for his appreciation for aspects of traditional country music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/gramparsons Rollingstone.com]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though his career was cut tragically short by his 1973 death, his legacy was carried on by his mentee and duet partner [[Emmylou Harris]]; Harris would release her debut solo in 1975, an amalgamation of country, rock and roll, folk, blues and pop.

Subsequent to the initial blending of the two polar opposite genres, other offspring soon resulted, including [[Southern rock]], [[heartland rock]] and in more recent years, [[alternative country]].

In the decades that followed, artists such as [[Juice Newton]], [[Alabama (band)|Alabama]], [[Hank Williams, Jr.]], [[Gary Allan]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Brooks &amp; Dunn]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Dwight Yoakam]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] moved country further towards rock influence.

=== Outlaw country ===
{{Main|Outlaw country}}
Derived from the traditional and honky tonk sounds of the late 1950s and 1960s, including [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] (whose band, the &quot;Cherokee Cowboys&quot;, included [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Roger Miller]]) and mixed with the anger of an alienated subculture of the nation during the period, outlaw country revolutionized the genre of country music.

[[File:WillieNelson.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Willie Nelson]]]]
&quot;After I left Nashville (the early 70s), I wanted to relax and play the music that I wanted to play, and just stay around Texas, maybe Oklahoma. Waylon and I had that outlaw image going, and when it caught on at colleges and we started selling records, we were O.K. The whole outlaw thing, it had nothing to do with the music, it was something that got written in an article, and the young people said, 'Well, that's pretty cool.' And started listening.&quot; (Willie Nelson)&lt;ref&gt;The Roots of Country Music&quot; Collectors Edition by Life September 1, 1994 page 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''outlaw country'' is traditionally associated with [[Hank Williams, Jr]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[David Allan Coe]], [[Whitey Morgan &amp; The 78's]], [[John Prine]], [[Billy Joe Shaver]], [[Gary Stewart (singer)|Gary Stewart]], [[Townes Van Zandt]] and with a few female vocalists such as [[Jessi Colter]] and [[Sammi Smith]]. It was encapsulated in the 1976 album ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]''. A related subgenre is [[Red Dirt (music)|Red Dirt]].

=== Country pop ===
{{Main|Country pop}}
Country pop or soft pop, with roots in both the [[countrypolitan]] sound and in [[soft rock]], is a subgenre that first emerged in the 1970s. Although the term first referred to country music songs and artists that crossed over to top 40 radio, country pop acts are now more likely to cross over to [[adult contemporary music]]. It started with pop music singers like [[Michael Nesmith]], [[The Bellamy Brothers]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[John Denver]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Marie Osmond]], [[B. J. Thomas]] and [[Anne Murray]] having hits on the country charts. Campbell's &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot; was one of the biggest crossover hits in country music history.

[[File:Lynnanderson(by Scott Dudelson).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Lynn Anderson]] in concert]]

In 1974, Newton-John, an Australian pop singer, won the &quot;Best Female Country Vocal Performance&quot; as well as the Country Music Association's most coveted award for females, &quot;Female Vocalist of the Year&quot;. In the same year, a group of artists, troubled by this trend, formed the short-lived [[Association of Country Entertainers]]. The debate raged into 1975, and reached its apex at that year's Country Music Association Awards when reigning Entertainer of the Year [[Charlie Rich]] (who himself had a series of crossover hits) presented the award to his successor, John Denver. As he read Denver's name, Rich set fire to the envelope with a cigarette lighter. The action was taken as a protest against the increasing pop style in country music.

During the mid-1970s, [[Dolly Parton]], a highly successful mainstream country artist since the late '60s, mounted a high profile campaign to crossover to pop music, culminating in her 1977 hit &quot;Here You Come Again&quot;, which topped the U.S. country singles chart, and also reached No. 3 on the pop singles charts. Parton's male counterpart, [[Kenny Rogers]] came from the opposite direction, aiming his music at the country charts, after a successful career in pop, rock and folk music, achieving success the same year with &quot;Lucille&quot;, which topped the country charts and reached No. 5 on the U.S. pop singles charts. Parton and Rogers would both continue to have success on both country and pop charts simultaneously, well into the 1980s. Artists like [[Crystal Gayle]], [[Ronnie Milsap]] and [[Barbara Mandrell]] would also find success on the pop charts with their records as well.

In 1975, author Paul Hemphill stated in the ''Saturday Evening Post'', “Country music isn’t really country anymore; it is a hybrid of nearly every form of popular music in America.”&lt;ref&gt;Hemphill, Paul. &quot;Nashville--Where It All Started.&quot; Saturday Evening Post 247.3 (1975): 44-86. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Web. 1 Feb. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1980s, country artists continued to see their records perform well on the pop charts. [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Juice Newton]] each had two songs in the top 5 of the Billboard Hot 100 in the early eighties: Nelson charted &quot;Always On My Mind&quot; (No. 5, 1982) and &quot;To All The Girls I've Loved Before&quot; (No. 5, 1984), and Newton achieved success with &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot; (No. 2, 1981) and &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot; (No. 4, 1981). Four country songs topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in the 1980s: &quot;Lady&quot; by [[Kenny Rogers]], from the late fall of 1980; &quot;9 to 5&quot; by [[Dolly Parton]], &quot;I Love a Rainy Night&quot; by [[Eddie Rabbitt]] (these two back-to-back at the top in early 1981); and &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;, a duet by [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Kenny Rogers]] in 1983, a pop-country crossover hit written by Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb of the [[Bee Gees]]. Newton's &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot; almost reached No. 1, but was kept out of the spot by the pop ballad juggernaut &quot;Endless Love&quot; by [[Diana Ross]] and [[Lionel Richie]].

The record-setting, multi-platinum group, Alabama, was named Artist of the Decade for the 1980s by the Academy of Country Music.

=== Neocountry ===
In 1980, a style of &quot;neocountry disco music&quot; was popularized by the film ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Workin 1999. page 259&quot;&gt;Workin' Man Blues - Country Music in California. Gerald W. Haslan. University of California Press. 1999. page 259. ISBN 0-520-21800-0.&lt;/ref&gt; which also included more traditional songs such as &quot;[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia]]&quot; by the [[Charlie Daniels Band]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyricsoncall.com/lyrics/charlie-daniels-band/the-devil-went-down-to-georgia-lyrics.html Lyricsoncall.com] ''Lyricsoncall.com''&lt;/ref&gt; A related subgenre is [[Texas country music]].

Sales in record stores rocketed to $250 million in 1981; by 1984, 900 radio stations began programming country or neocountry pop full time. As with most sudden trends, however, by 1984 sales had dropped below 1979 figures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Workin 1999. page 259&quot;/&gt;

=== Neotraditionalist movement ===
{{Main|Neotraditionalist country}}
During the mid-1980s, a group of new artists began to emerge who rejected the more polished country-pop sound that had been prominent on radio and the charts, in favor of more, traditional, &quot;back-to-basics&quot; production. Led by [[Randy Travis]], whose 1986 debut album ''[[Storms of Life]]'', sold four million copies and was Billboard's year-end top country album of 1987, many of the artists during the latter half of the '80s drew on traditional honky tonk, bluegrass, folk and western swing. Artists who typified this sound included [[Travis Tritt]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Kathy Mattea]], [[George Strait]] and [[The Judds]].

Country music was aided by the FCC's Docket 80-90, which led to a significant expansion of [[FM radio]] in the 1980s by adding numerous higher-fidelity FM signals to rural and suburban areas. At this point, country music was mainly heard on rural [[AM radio]] stations; the expansion of FM was particularly helpful to country music, which migrated to FM from the AM band as AM became overcome by [[talk radio]]. This wider availability of country music led to producers seeking to polish their product for a wider audience.

With his debut on the national country music scene in 1989, singer and songwriter [[Clint Black]] would usher in a new sound that would define much of country music for the 1990s and beyond.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In the 1990s, country music became a worldwide phenomenon thanks to [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] and [[Garth Brooks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Country Worldwide&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0LYxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_OIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1510,3298161&amp;dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&amp;hl=en |title=Country is No. 1 musical style |date=1992-08-19 |publisher=Reading Eagle |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Country Worldwide2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TjQfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=B88EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4760,3698051&amp;dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&amp;hl=en |title=Country music reflects the time |date=1992-09-27 |publisher=Herald-Journal |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Country Worldwide3&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/504338431.html?dids=504338431:504338431&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+25%2C+1993&amp;author=Jack+Hurst&amp;pub=The+Record&amp;desc=Country+music+is+making+waves+across+the+seas&amp;pqatl=google |title=Country music is making waves across the seas |date=1993-11-25 |publisher=thestar.com |accessdate=2010-07-26 | first=Jack | last=Hurst}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter enjoyed one of the most successful careers in popular music history, breaking records for both sales and concert attendance throughout the decade.

[[Mindy McCready]], [[Jo Dee Messina]], and the [[Dixie Chicks]] all released [[platinum]] selling albums in the 90s.

In the mid 1990s, country western music was influenced by the popularity of [[line dancing]]. This influence was so great that [[Chet Atkins]] was quoted as saying &quot;The music has gotten pretty bad, I think. It's all that damn line dancing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Roots of Country Music&quot; Collectors Edition by Life September 1, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the decade, however, at least one line dance choreographer complained that good country line dance music was no longer being released.

=== Alternative country ===
{{Main|Alternative country}}
In the 1990s, alternative country came to refer to a diverse group of musicians and singers operating outside the traditions and industry of mainstream country music. In general, they eschewed the high production values and pop outlook of the Nashville-dominated industry, to produce music with a [[lo-fi]] sound, frequently infused with a strong [[punk rock|punk]] and [[alternative rock|alternative]] aesthetic, bending the traditional rules of country music. Lyrics were often bleak, gothic or socially aware. Key alternative country artists include [[Old 97's]], [[Lyle Lovett]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Uncle Tupelo]], [[Son Volt]], [[Ryan Adams]], [[Will Oldham]] and [[Drive-By Truckers]].

Several rock and pop stars have ventured into country music. In 2000, [[Richard Marx]] made a brief cross-over with his ''[[Days In Avalon (album)|Days In Avalon]]'' album, which features five country songs and several singers and musicians. [[Alison Krauss]] sang background vocals to Marx's single &quot;Straight From My Heart.&quot; Also, [[Bon Jovi]] had a hit single, &quot;[[Who Says You Can't Go Home]]&quot;, with [[Jennifer Nettles]] of [[Sugarland]]. Other rock stars who featured a country song on their albums were [[Don Henley]] and [[Poison (band)|Poison]].

One infrequent, but consistent theme in modern country music is that of proud, stubborn [[individualism]]. &quot;Country Boy Can Survive&quot; and &quot;[[Copperhead Road]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steveearle.net/lyrics/ly-coppe.php |title=Steveearle.net |publisher=Steveearle.net |date=2001-02-19 |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; are two of the more serious songs along those lines; while &quot;Some Girls Do&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cowboylyrics.com/lyrics/sawyer-brown/some-girls-do-15017.html |title=Cowboylyrics.com |publisher=Cowboylyrics.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;[[Redneck Woman]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lyricstop.com/r/redneckwoman-gretchenwilson.html |title=Lyricstop.com |publisher=Lyricstop.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; are more light-hearted variations on the theme.[[File:Taylor Swift by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Taylor Swift]]]]

In 2005, country singer [[Carrie Underwood]] rose to fame as the winner of the fourth season of ''[[American Idol]]'' and became a multi-platinum selling recording artist and multiple [[Grammy Award]] winner. With her first single, &quot;[[Inside Your Heaven]]&quot;, Underwood became the only country artist to have a #1 Hit on [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard Hot 100 Songs]] chart in the 2000-2009 decade. In 2007, Underwood won the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] and became the first country artist in 10 years to win such award and the second of only three to ever win it. Underwood also made history by becoming the seventh woman to win Entertainer Of The Year for the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], and the first woman in history to win Entertainer of the Year for the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] twice, as well as twice consecutively. Underwood's debut album, &quot;[[Some Hearts (Carrie Underwood album)|Some Hearts]]&quot;, was not only the fastest-selling debut album by any country artist in history, but was ranked by [[Billboard.com]] as the #1 Country Album of the 2000-2009 decade.

In 2008, [[Taylor Swift]] rose as a major country-pop artist, with her single &quot;[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]&quot; becoming the first country song to reach No. 1 one on the Nielsen BDS CHR/Top 40 chart. Another of her singles, &quot;[[You Belong with Me]]&quot;, also reached No. 1, making Swift the only country artist to have two No. 1 singles atop the chart. Both &quot;Love Story&quot; and &quot;You Belong with Me&quot; became the best-selling country song of all time, with &quot;Love Story&quot; in the first position with a domestic total of 4.4 million digital copies sold, and &quot;You Belong with Me&quot; in the second with 3.4 million sales, respectively. In 2010, Swift's sophomore album &quot;[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]&quot; was awarded the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]], becoming the first album in history to win the [[American Music Award]] (AMA), [[Academy of Country Music Award]] (ACM), [[Country Music Association Award]] (CMA), and the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in the same year.

In the same year, [[Hootie &amp; the Blowfish]] vocalist [[Darius Rucker]] released his second solo album and country music debut, ''[[Learn to Live]]''. The first three singles from that album all debuted at No. 1, making Rucker the first solo artist to debut with three No. 1 hits in over a decade. He is also the first [[African American]] with a No. 1 country hit since [[Charley Pride]] in 1983.

In 2009, [[George Strait]] was named Artist of the Decade by the Academy of Country Music.

In 2010, the group [[Lady Antebellum]] won five Grammys, including the coveted [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and [[Record of the Year]] for &quot;[[Need You Now (song)|Need You Now]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/13/AR2011021303447.html?hpid=top |title=Esperanza Spalding, Arcade Fire top a night of upsets at 2011 Grammys |first=Chris |last=Richards |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2011-02-14 |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Canadian Country Music Association|Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame}}

Outside of the US, Canada has the largest country music fan and artist base. Mainstream country music is culturally ingrained in the [[Maritimes]] and the [[Canadian Prairies|prairie provinces]]: areas with large numbers of rural residents. Canadian country music originated in Atlantic Canada in the form of British and Irish folk music popular amongst Irish and Scottish immigrants to Canada's Maritime Provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island). Like the southern United States and Appalachia, all three regions are of heavy British Isles stock and rural; as such, The development of country music in the Maritimes mirrored the development of country music in the US south and Appalachia. 

[[Don Messer's Jubilee]] was a Halifax, Nova Scotia based country/folk variety television show that was broadcast nationally from 1957 to 1969. It out drew the Ed Sullivan Show from the United States and became the #1 rated television show in Canada throughout much of the 1960s. Don Messer's Jubilee followed a consistent format throughout its years, beginning with a tune named &quot;Goin' to the Barndance Tonight&quot;, followed by fiddle tunes by Messer, songs from some of his &quot;Islanders&quot; including singers Marg Osburne and Charlie Chamberlain, the featured guest performance, and a closing hymn. It ended with &quot;Till We Meet Again&quot;.

The guest performance slot gave national exposure to numerous Canadian folk musicians, including Stompin' Tom Connors and Catherine McKinnon. Some Maritime country performers went on to further fame beyond Canada. Hank Snow, Wilf Carter (also known as Montana Slim), and Anne Murray are the three most notable.
 
The cancellation of the show by the public broadcaster in 1969 caused a nationwide protest, including the raising of questions in the Canadian parliament.

Despite country's roots in the Maritimes, many traditional country artists are present in Eastern and Western Canada. They make common use of fiddle and pedal steel guitar styles. Some notable Canadian country artists include: [[Shania Twain]], [[Blue Rodeo]], [[Marg Osburne]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Johnny Mooring]], [[Don Messer]], [[Doc Walker]], [[Emerson Drive]], [[Paul Brandt]], [[The Wilkinsons]], [[Wilf Carter]], [[Michelle Wright]], [[Corb Lund and the Hurtin' Albertans]], [[Stompin' Tom Connors]], [[Terri Clark]], [[Crystal Shawanda]], [[Shane Yellowbird]], [[The Road Hammers]], [[Anne Murray]], and [[Prairie Oyster] and  The Higgins.

[[File:Olivia Newton-John Sydney 2008.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Olivia Newton-John]] singing in Sydney in 2008.]]

[[Australian country music]] has a long tradition. Influenced by American country music it has developed a distinct style, shaped by British and Irish folk ballads and Australian [[bush ballad]]eers like [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]]. Country instruments, including the [[guitar]], [[banjo]], [[fiddle]] and [[harmonica]] create the distinctive sound of country music in Australia and accompany songs with strong storyline and memorable chorus. 

Folk songs sung in Australia between the 1780s and 1920s based around such themes as the struggle against government [[tyranny]], or the lives of [[bushrangers]], [[swagmen]], [[Drover (Australian)|drovers]], [[stockmen]] and [[shearer]]s continue to influence the genre. This strain of Australian country, with lyrics focusing on Australian subjects, is generally known as &quot;bush music&quot; or &quot;[[bush band]] music&quot;. [[Waltzing Matilda]], often regarded as Australia's unofficial [[National anthem]], is a quintessential Australian country song, influenced more by British and Irish folk ballads than by American Country and Western music. The lyrics were composed by the poet [[Banjo Paterson]] in 1895. Other popular songs from this tradition include [[The Wild Colonial Boy]], [[Click Go The Shears]], [[The Queensland Drover]] and [[The Dying Stockman]]. Later themes which endure to the present include the experiences of war, of droughts and flooding rains, of [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginality]] and of the railways and trucking routes which link Australia's vast distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/bush/ |title=Bush songs and music - Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/country/ |title=Australian country music - Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date=2006-11-24 |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pioneers of a more Americanised popular country music in Australia included [[Tex Morton]] (known as ''The Father of Australian Country Music'') in the 1930s and other early stars like [[Buddy Williams (country musician)|Buddy Williams]], [[Shirley Thoms]] and [[Smoky Dawson]]. In 1952, Dawson began a radio show, and went on to national stardom as a singing cowboy of radio, TV and film.

[[Slim Dusty]] (1927–2003) was known as the ''King of Australian Country Music'', and helped to popularise the Australian [[bush ballad]]. His successful career spanned almost six decades and his 1957 hit &quot;[[Pub With No Beer]]&quot; was the biggest-selling record by an Australian to that time, and with over seven million record sales in Australia he is the most successful artist in Australian musical history&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;Guardian-obit&quot;&gt;Dave&quot; Laing, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/sep/20/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries &quot;Slim Dusty: Country singer famous for A Pub With No Beer&quot;], ''The Guardian (UK)'', 20 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Dusty recorded and released his one-hundredth album in the year 2000 and was given the honour of singing ''[[Waltzing Matilda]]'' in the closing ceremony of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Olympic Games]]. Dusty's wife [[Joy McKean]] penned several of his most popular songs.

[[Chad Morgan]], who began recording in the 1950s has represented a vaudeville style of comic Australian country; [[Frank Ifield]] achieved considerable success in the early 1960s, especially in the UK Singles Charts and [[Reg Lindsay]] was one of the first Australians to perform at [[Nashville]]'s [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duncan |first=Jamie |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/reg-lindsay-country-great-takes-final-bow/1236107.aspx |title=Reg Lindsay, country great, takes final bow - Local News - News - General |publisher=The Canberra Times |date=2008-08-06 |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Bogle]]'s 1972 folk lament to the [[Gallipoli campaign]] &quot;[[And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda]]&quot; recalled the British and Irish origins of Australian folk-country.

By the 1990s, country music had attained cross-over success in the pop charts with artists like [[James Blundell]] and [[James Reyne]] singing &quot;[[Way Out West]]&quot;, and country star [[Kasey Chambers]] winning the [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA]] for Best Female Artist in 2003. The cross-over influence of Australian country is also evident in the music of successful contemporary bands [[The Waifs]] and [[The John Butler Trio]]. [[Nick Cave]] has been heavily influenced by the country artist [[Johnny Cash]]. In 2000, Cash, covered Cave's &quot;[[The Mercy Seat (song)|The Mercy Seat]]&quot; on the album ''American III: Solitary Man'', seemingly repaying Cave for the compliment he paid by covering Cash's &quot;The Singer&quot; (originally &quot;The Folk Singer&quot;) on his ''Kicking Against the Pricks'' album. Subsequently, Cave cut a duet with Cash on a version of [[Hank Williams]]' &quot;[[I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry]]&quot; for Cash's ''[[American IV: The Man Comes Around]]'' album (2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nick Cave |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/sep/13/arts.artsnews1 |title=Nick Cave on Johnny Cash &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2003-09-13|accessdate=2011-02-01 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular contemporary performers of Australian country music include: [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]] (who wrote the iconic &quot;[[True Blue (John Williamson song)|True Blue]]&quot;), [[Lee Kernaghan]] (whose hits include &quot;[[Boys From the Bush]]&quot; and &quot;[[the Outback Club]]&quot;), [[Gina Jeffreys]] and [[Sara Storer]]. In the USA, [[Olivia Newton John]], [[Sherrié Austin]] and [[Keith Urban]] have attained great success.

Country music has also been a particularly popular form of musical expression among [[Indigenous Australians]]. [[Troy Cassar-Daley]] is among Australia's successful contemporary indigenous performers Aboriginal artists and [[Kev Carmody]] and [[Archie Roach]] employ a combination of folk-rock and country music to sing about Aboriginal rights issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/folk/ |title=Australian folk music - Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tamworth Country Music Festival]] began in 1973 and now attracts up to a 100,000 visitors annually. Held in [[Tamworth, New South Wales]] (Country music capital of Australia), it celebrates the culture and heritage of Australian country music. During the festival the [[Country Music Association of Australia|CMAA]] holds the [[Country Music Awards of Australia]] ceremony awarding the [[Golden Guitar]] trophies.

Other significant country music festivals include the Whittlesea Country Music Festival (near [[Melbourne]]) and Boyup Brook Country Music Festival ([[Western Australia]]) in February; the Bamera Country Music Festival in June ([[South Australia]]), the National Country Muster held in [[Gympie]] during August, [[Mildura Country Music Festival]] for &quot;independent&quot; performers during October and the [[Canberra Country Music Festival]] held in the national capital during November. Some festivals are quite unique in their location: Grabine State Park in [[New South Wales]] promotes Australian country through the Grabine Music Muster Festival; Marilyns Country Music Festival is a unique event held in South Australia's Smoky Bay in September and is the only music festival in the world using an oyster barge as a stage.

''Country HQ'' showcases new talent on the rise in the country music scene [[downunder]]. CMC (the [[Country Music Channel]]), a 24 hour music channel dedicated to non-stop country music, can be viewed on [[pay tv]] and features once a year the Golden Guitar Awards, CMAs and CCMAs alongside international shows such as The Wilkinsons, The Road Hammers, and Country Music Across America.

=== Other international country music ===
Tom Roland, from the [[Country Music Association]] International, explains Country Music’s global popularity: “In this respect, at least, Country Music listeners around the globe have something in common with those in the United States. In Germany, for instance, Rohrbach identifies three general groups that gravitate to the genre: people intrigued with the American cowboy icon, middle-aged fans who seek an alternative to harder rock music and younger listeners drawn to the pop-influenced sound that underscores many current Country hits.”&lt;ref name=int/&gt;

One of the first Americans to perform country music abroad was [[George Hamilton IV]]. He was the first country musician to perform in the Soviet Union; he also toured in Australia and the Middle East. He was deemed the &quot;International Ambassador of Country Music&quot; for his contributions to the globalization of country music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.unc.edu/spotlight/hamilton_loudermilk.html Lib.unc.edu] ''“Country Music Figures Donate Papers, Give Concert”''&lt;/ref&gt; Johnny Cash, Emmylou Harris, Keith Urban, and Dwight Yoakam have also made numerous international tours.&lt;ref name=int&gt;[http://www.cmaworld.com/international/default.asp CMAworld.com]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Country Music Association]] undertakes various initiatives to promote country music internationally.&lt;ref name=int/&gt;

In the United Kingdom, a country-derived genre known as [[skiffle]] peaked in the 1950s thanks to the efforts of [[Lonnie Donegan]]; though the genre as a whole was very short-lived, most of the bands involved with the [[British Invasion]] began their careers as skiffle musicians.&lt;ref&gt;C. McDevitt, ''Skiffle: The Roots of UK Rock'' (Robson Books, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In South America, on the last weekend of September, the yearly &quot;San Pedro Country Music Festival&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country2.com |title=Country2.com |publisher=Country2.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes places in the town of [[San Pedro, Buenos Aires|San Pedro, Argentina]]. The festival features bands from different places of [[Argentina]], as well as international artist from [[Brazil]], [[Uruguay]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]] and the [[United States]].

In Ireland [[TG4]] began a quest for Ireland's next country star called ''[[Glór Tíre]]'', translated as Country Voice, it is now in its 6th season and is one of TG4 most watched TV shows.
A recent success in the Irish arena has been [[Crystal Swing]].

In [[Sweden]] there was a group called [[Rednex]] which combined country music with electro-pop. Rednex had a worldwide hit with their version of the traditional Southern tune &quot;[[Cotton-Eyed Joe]]&quot;.

[[Rhodesia]] during the 1970s had an active country and western music scene. Many songs combined country ballads with patriotic or military inspired lyrics. For example, [[Clem Tholet]]'s ''Rhodesians Never Die'' rose to the top of the Rhodesian pop charts.

== Performers and shows ==
{{Main|List of country music performers|List of country performers by era|List of country television and radio shows}}

=== US cable television ===
Four U.S. [[cable TV]] networks are at least partly devoted to the genre: [[Country Music Television|CMT]] and [[CMT Pure Country]] (both owned by [[Viacom]]), [[RFD-TV|Rural Free Delivery TV]] (owned by Rural Media Group) and [[Great American Country|GAC]] (owned by [[E. W. Scripps Company|The E. W. Scripps Company]]). The first American country music video cable channel was [[The Nashville Network]], launched in the early 1980s. In 2000, the channel was renamed and reformatted as The ''National'' Network, a general-interest network, and eventually became [[Spike TV]].

=== Canadian television ===
Only one television channel is currently dedicated to country music in Canada and that is [[CMT (Canada)]] owned by [[Corus Entertainment]] (90%) and Viacom (10%). But in the past the show Don Messer's Jubilee had great impact on country music in Canada in fact it is the program that launched Anne Murray's career.

=== Australian cable television ===
The only network dedicated to Country Music in Australia is the [[Country Music Channel]] owned by [[XYZnetworks]].

[[Image:Cold War WorldMap 1953.png|right|thumb|550px|1953 World Map of alignments]]
The '''Cold War (1947–1953)''' is the period within the [[Cold War]] from the [[Truman Doctrine]] in 1947 to the [[Korean War]] in 1953.  The [[Origins of the Cold War|Cold War began]] almost immediately following [[World War II]] and lasted through most of the rest of the twentieth century.

==Creation of the Eastern Bloc==
[[File:EasternBloc BorderChange38-48.svg|right|thumb|267px]]
{{Main|Eastern Bloc}}
During [[World War II]], the Soviet Union annexed several countries as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] within the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]].  Most of those territories had been ceded to it by the secret agreement portion of the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannicamr&quot;&gt;Encyclopedia Britanica, ''German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mrtext&quot;&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1939pact.html ''Text of the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact''], executed August 23, 1939&lt;/ref&gt;   These later annexed territories include Eastern [[Poland]] (incorporated into [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|two different SSRs]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars43&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latvia]] (became [[Latvia SSR]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig20&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig20&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;senn&quot;&gt;Senn, Alfred Erich, ''Lithuania 1940 : revolution from above'', Amsterdam, New York, Rodopi, 2007 ISBN 978-90-420-2225-6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estonia]] (became [[Estonian SSR]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig20&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;senn&quot;/&gt; [[Lithuania]] (became [[Lithuania SSR]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig20&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;senn&quot;/&gt; part of eastern [[Finland]] (became part of the [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]])&lt;ref name=&quot;ckpipe&quot;&gt;Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline, ''Stalin's Cold War'', New York: Manchester University Press, 1995, ISBN 0-7190-4201-1&lt;/ref&gt; and northern [[Romania]] (became the [[Moldavian SSR]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;stalinswars55&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shirer794&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the other countries it occupied that were not directly annexed into the [[USSR]] became [[Satellite state|Soviet satellite states]].  In [[East Germany]] after local election losses, a forced merger of political parties in the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party (&quot;SED&quot;)]], followed by elections in 1946 where political opponents were oppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=96–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the non-[[USSR]] annexed portion of [[Poland]], less than a third of Poland's population voted in favor of massive communist land reforms and industry nationalizations&lt;ref&gt;Curp, David, ''A Clean Sweep?: The Politics of Ethnic Cleansing in Western Poland, 1945-1960'', Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2006, ISBN 1-58046-238-3, pages 66-69&lt;/ref&gt; in a policies referendum known as &quot;[[Polish people's referendum, 1946|3 times YES]]&quot; (''3 razy TAK''; ''3xTAK''), whereupon a second [[electoral fraud|vote rigged]] election was held to get the desired result.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchanan&quot;&gt;Tom Buchanan, ''Europe's Troubled Peace, 1945–2000: 1945–2000'', Blackwell Publishing, 2005, ISBN 0-631-22163-8, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0631221638&amp;id=zeqdrL3Wzy8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA84&amp;lpg=RA1-PA84&amp;ots=sdtzUrdhbs&amp;dq=Polish+referendum+1946+falsified&amp;sig=5einoBUu1HWsfCzOoauJcrxCTvg Google Print, p.84]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;poloniatodayhistory&quot;&gt;[http://www.poloniatoday.com/history13.htm A brief history of Poland: Chapter 13: The Post-War Years, 1945–1990].

In [[Hungary]], when the Soviets installed a communist government, [[Mátyás Rákosi]] was appointed [[General Secretary]] of the [[Hungarian Communist Party]],&lt;ref name=&quot;sugar375&quot;&gt;Sugar, Peter F., Peter Hanak and Tibor Frank, ''A History of Hungary'', Indiana University Press, 1994, ISBN 0-253-20867-X, page 375-77&lt;/ref&gt; which began one of the harshest dictatorships in Europe&lt;ref name=&quot;granville&quot;&gt;Granville, Johanna, ''The First Domino: International Decision Making during the Hungarian Crisis of 1956'', Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2004.

In [[Bulgaria]], toward the end of World War II, the Soviet Union crossed the border and created the conditions for a communist [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944|coup d'état]] on the following night.&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig50&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet military commander in Sofia assumed supreme authority, and the communists whom he instructed, including [[Kimon Georgiev]] (who was not a communist himself, but a member of the elitarian political organization &quot;[[Zveno]]&quot;, working together with the communists), took full control of domestic politics&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig50&quot;/&gt; in the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]].  

With Soviet backing, the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] assumed undisputed control over the government of Czechoslovakia in the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948]], ushering in a dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grenville|2005|pp=370–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grogin|2001|pp=134–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Saxonberg|2001|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Romanian general election, 1946|Romanian general election elections of 1946]], the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) employed widespread intimidation tactics and electoral fraud to obtain 80% of the vote and, thereafter, eliminated the role of the centrist parties and forced mergers, the result of which was that, by 1948, most non-Communist politicians were either executed, in exile or in prison. In the [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1945|December 1945 Albanian election]], the only effective ballot choices were those of the communist [[Democratic Front (Albania)]], led by [[Enver Hoxha]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cook17&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cook17&quot;/&gt;  In 1946, Albania was declared the [[People's Republic of Albania]].

Initially, Stalin directed systems in the Eastern Bloc countries that rejected Western institutional characteristics of [[market economy|market economies]], democratic governance (dubbed &quot;[[bourgeois democracy]]&quot; in Soviet parlance) and the rule of law subduing discretional intervention by the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;hardt12&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were economically communist and depended upon the Soviet Union for significant amounts of materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;hardt15&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While in the first five years following World War II, massive emigration from these states to the West occurred, restrictions implemented thereafter stopped most East-West migration, except that under limited bilateral and other agreements.&lt;ref name=&quot;bocker209&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Böcker|1998|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Containment==
The immediate post-1945 period may have been the historical high point for the popularity of [[communism|communist]] ideology. The burdens the [[Red Army]] and the [[Soviet Union]] endured had earned it massive respect which, had it been fully exploited by [[Joseph Stalin]], had a good chance of resulting in a communist [[Europe]]. Communist parties achieved a significant popularity in such nations as [[China]], [[Greece]], [[Iran]], and the [[Republic of Mahabad]]. Communist parties had already come to power in [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Albania]], and [[Yugoslavia]]. The [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] were concerned that electoral victories by communist parties in any of these countries could lead to sweeping economic and political change in [[Western Europe]].

===Morgenthau and Marshall Plans===
{{See|Morgenthau Plan|Marshall Plan|Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948}}
Having lost 27 million people in the war, the Soviet Union was determined to destroy Germany's capacity for another war, and pushed for such in wartime conferences. The resulting [[Morgenthau plan]] policy foresaw returning Germany to a pastoral state without heavy industry. Because of the increasing costs of food imports to avoid mass-starvation in Germany, and with the danger of losing the entire nation to communism, the U.S. government abandoned the Morgenthau plan in September 1946 with [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes]]' speech [[Restatement of Policy on Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gimbel]] [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0032-3195%28197206%2987%3A2%3C242%3AOTIOTP%3E2.0.CO%3B2-9 &quot;''On the Implementation of the Potsdam Agreement: An Essay on U.S. Postwar German Policy&quot;''] Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 87, No. 2. (Jun., 1972), pp. 242-269.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 1947, Truman appointed General [[George Marshall]] as Secretary of State, and enacted JCS 1779, which decreed that an orderly and prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;beschloss277&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Beschloss|2003|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directive comported with the view of  General [[Lucius D. Clay]] and the [[Joint Chief of Staff]] over growing communist influence in [[Germany]], as well as of the failure of the rest of the European economy to recover without the German industrial base on which it previously had been dependent. Administration officials met with Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and others to press for an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller16&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After six weeks of negotiations, Molotov refused the demands and the talks were adjourned.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller16&quot;/&gt; Marshall was particularly discouraged after personally meeting with Stalin, who expressed little interest in a solution to German economic problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller16&quot;/&gt; The United States concluded that a solution could not wait any longer.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller16&quot;/&gt;  In a June 5, 1947 speech,&lt;ref name=&quot;marshallspeech&quot;&gt;Marshall, George C, [[s:The Marshall Plan Speech|''The Marshal Plan Speech'']], June 5, 1947&lt;/ref&gt; comporting with the [[Truman Doctrine]], Marshall announced a comprehensive program of American assistance to all European countries wanting to participate, including the Soviet Union and those of Eastern Europe, called the [[Marshall Plan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;miller16&quot;/&gt;  

Fearing American political, cultural and economic penetration, Stalin eventually forbade Soviet [[Eastern bloc]] countries of the newly formed [[Cominform]] from accepting [[Marshall Plan]] aid.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller16&quot;/&gt; In [[Czechoslovakia]], that required a Soviet-backed [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948]],&lt;ref name=trueye&gt;''Airbridge to Berlin'', &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot; chapter&lt;/ref&gt;   the brutality of which shocked Western powers more than any event so far and set in a motion a brief scare that war would occur and swept away the last vestiges of opposition to the Marshall Plan in the United States Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller19&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Greek Civil War and the Truman Doctrine===
{{Main|Truman Doctrine|Greek Civil War}}
Both East and West regarded [[Greece]] as a nation well within the sphere of influence of Britain. Stalin had respected his agreement with [[Winston Churchill]] to not intervene, but Yugoslavia and Albania defied the USSR's advice and sent supplies during the [[Greek Civil War]] to the partisan forces of the [[Communist Party of Greece]], the ELAS (National Popular Liberation Army). The UK had given aid to the royalist Greek forces and ELAS leaders who, failing to realize that there would be no Soviet aid and having boycotted the elections, were at a disadvantaged position. However, by 1947, the near-bankrupt British government could no longer maintain its massive overseas commitments. In addition to granting [[Partition of India|independence to India]] and handing back the [[Palestinian Mandate]] to the [[United Nations]], the British government decided to withdraw from both Greece and nearby Turkey. This would have left the two nations, in particular Greece, on the brink of a communist-led revolution.

Notified that British aid to Greece and Turkey would end in less than six weeks, and already hostile towards and suspicious of Soviet intentions, because of their [[Iran crisis of 1946|reluctance to withdraw from Iran]], the Truman administration decided that additional action was necessary.  With [[United States Congress|Congress]] solidly in [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] hands, and with [[isolationism|isolationist]] sentiment strong among the U.S. public, Truman adopted an ideological approach. In a meeting with congressional leaders, the argument of &quot;apples in a barrel infected by one rotten one&quot; was used to convince them of the significance in supporting Greece and Turkey. It was to become the &quot;[[domino theory]]&quot;. On the morning of March 12, 1947, President [[Harry S. Truman]] appeared before Congress to ask for $400 million of aid to Greece and Turkey. Calling on congressional approval for the United States to &quot;support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures,&quot; or in short a policy of &quot;[[containment]]&quot;, Truman articulated a presentation of the ideological struggle that became known as the &quot;Truman Doctrine.&quot; Although based on a simplistic analysis of internal strife in Greece and Turkey, it became the single dominating influence over U.S. policy until at least the [[Vietnam War]].

Truman's speech had a tremendous effect. The anti-communist feelings that had just begun to hatch in the U.S. were given a great boost, and a silenced Congress voted overwhelmingly in approval of aid. The United States would not withdraw back to the [[Western Hemisphere]] as it had after [[World War I]]. From then on, the U.S. actively engaged any communist threats anywhere in the globe under the ostensible causes of &quot;freedom&quot;, &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;human rights.&quot; The U.S. brandished its role as the leader of the &quot;free world.&quot; Meanwhile, the Soviet Union brandished its position as the leader of the &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;anti-imperialist&quot; camp.

===U.S. Military Doctrine Debate===
{{Main|Revolt of the Admirals}}

After [[World War II]], the [[General (United States)|generals]] of the newly-formed [[U.S. Air Force]] propounded a new [[Military doctrine|doctrine]]: that [[strategic bombing]], particularly with [[nuclear weapon]]s, was the sole decisive element necessary to win any future war; and was therefore the sole means necessary to deter an adversary from launching a [[Pearl Harbor]] like surprise attack or war against the United States. To implement this doctrine, which the Air Force and its supporters regarded as the highest national priority, the Air Force proposed that it should be funded by the Congress to build a large fleet of U.S. based long-range strategic [[heavy bomber]]s.  The Air Force generals argued that this project should receive large amounts of funding, beginning with the [[Convair B-36|B-36 Peacemaker]] bomber.&lt;ref&gt;Air Force insistence on their [[monopoly]] for this strategic role also helped kill the [[P6M SeaMaster]]. Piet, Stan, and Raithel, Al. ''Martin P6M SeaMaster''. Bel Air, Maryland: Martineer Press, 2001, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Admiral (United States)|admirals]] of the Navy disagreed. Pointing to the overwhelming dominance of the [[aircraft carrier]] in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific Theater]], they asked the [[United States Congress]] to fund a large fleet of &quot;[[supercarrier]]s&quot; and their supporting [[Carrier battle group|battle groups]], beginning with the [[USS United States (CVA-58)|USS ''United States'' (CVA-58)]]. The Navy leadership believed that wars could not be won by strategic bombing alone, with or without the use of nuclear weapons.  The Navy also maintained that to decide, at the outset of any future conflict, to initiate the widespread use of nuclear weapons—attacking the major population centers of the enemy homeland—was immoral.

===''Nazi-Soviet relations'' and ''Falsifiers of History''===
[[Image:FalsifiersOfHistoryCover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of English version of ''[[Falsifiers of History]]'']]
{{Main|Falsifiers of History}}
Relations further deteriorated when, in January 1948, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] also published a collection of documents titled ''Nazi-Soviet Relations, 1939–1941: Documents from the Archives of The German Foreign Office'', which contained documents recovered from the Foreign Office of [[Nazi Germany]]&lt;ref name=&quot;henig67&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealing Soviet conversations with Germany regarding the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], including its secret protocol dividing eastern Europe,&lt;ref name=&quot;roberts97&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; the[[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|1939 German-Soviet Commercial Agreement]],&lt;ref name=&quot;roberts97&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|pp=32–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[German–Soviet Axis talks|discussions of the Soviet Union potentially becoming the fourth Axis Power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchill|1953|pp=512–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In response, one month later, the Soviet Union published ''[[Falsifiers of History]]'', a Stalin edited and partially re-written book attacking the West.&lt;ref name=&quot;henig67&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Henig|2005|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book did not attempt to directly counter or deal with the documents published in ''Nazi-Soviet Relations''&lt;ref name=&quot;roberts100&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rather, focused upon Western culpability for the outbreak of war in 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;roberts97&quot;/&gt; It argues that &quot;Western powers&quot; aided Nazi rearmament and aggression, including that American bankers and industrialists provided capital for the growth of German war industries, while deliberately encouraging Hitler to expand eastward.&lt;ref name=&quot;henig67&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;roberts97&quot;/&gt;  The book also included the claim that, during the Pact's operation, Stalin rejected Hitler's offer to share in a division of the world, without mentioning [[German–Soviet Axis talks|the Soviet offers to join the Axis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nekrich202&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historical studies, official accounts, memoirs and textbooks published in the Soviet Union used that depiction of events [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|until the Soviet Union's dissolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nekrich202&quot;/&gt;

===Berlin Blockade===
[[Image:C-54landingattemplehof.jpg|thumb|Berliners watching a C-54 land at Tempelhof Airport (1948)]]
{{Main|Berlin Blockade}}
After the [[Marshall Plan]], the introduction of a new currency to Western Germany to replace the debased [[Reichsmark]] and massive electoral losses for communist parties in 1946, in June 1948, the Soviet Union cut off surface road access to [[Berlin]].  On the day of the  [[Berlin Blockade]], a Soviet representative told the other occupying powers  &quot;We are warning both you and the population of Berlin that we shall apply economic and administrative sanctions that will lead to circulation in Berlin exclusively of the currency of the Soviet occupation zone.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;miller32&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Thereafter, street and water communications were severed, rail and barge traffic was stopped and the Soviets initially stopped supplying food to the civilian population in the non-Soviet sectors of Berlin.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller25&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=25–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because Berlin was located within the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany and the other occupying powers had previously relied on Soviet good will for access to Berlin, the only available methods of supplying the city were three limited air corridors.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller6&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By February 1948, because of massive post-war military cuts, the entire United States army had been reduced to 552,000 men.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller28&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Military forces in non-Soviet Berlin sectors totaled only 8,973 Americans, 7,606 British and 6,100 French.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller33&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soviet military forces in the Soviet sector that surrounded Berlin totaled one and a half million men.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller30&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two United States regiments in Berlin would have provided little resistance against a Soviet attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller29&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that Britain, France and the United States had little option other than to acquiesce, the Soviet Military Administration in Germany celebrated the beginning of the blockade.&lt;ref name=&quot;miller35&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, a massive aerial supply campaign of food, water and other goods was initiated by the United States, Britain, France and other countries.&lt;ref name=mac&gt;''MAC and the Legacy of the Berlin Airlift''&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets derided &quot;the futile attempts of the Americans to save face and to maintain their untenable position in Berlin.&quot;&lt;ref name=indiana&gt;[http://www.indianamilitary.org/ATTERBURYAAF/History/BerlinAirlift.html ''Fifty years ago, a massive airlift into Berlin showed the Soviets that a post-WW II blockade would not work''], C.V. Glines&lt;/ref&gt;   The success of the airlift eventually caused the Soviets to lift their blockade in May 1949.

===Tito-Stalin Split===
{{See|Tito–Stalin split}}
After disagreements between Yugoslavian leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] and the Soviet Union regarding Greece and the [[People's Republic of Albania]], a [[Tito-Stalin split]] occurred, followed by Yugoslavia being expelled from the [[Cominform]] in June 1948 and a brief failed Soviet putsch in Belgrade.&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig156&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The split created two separate communist forces in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig156&quot;/&gt;  A vehement campaign against &quot;Titoism&quot; was immediately started in the Eastern Bloc, describing agents of both the West and Tito in all places engaging in subversive activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig156&quot;/&gt; This resulted in the persecution of many major party cadres, including those in East Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;wettig157&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NATO===
[[File:Nato 1970.jpg|thumb|right|[[NATO]] v. the [[Warsaw Pact]]]]
[[Image:Europe-blocs-49-89x4.svg|right|thumb|300px|Cold War map of [[Eastern Bloc]], western-aligned and other countries in Europe.]]
The United States joined Britain, France, Canada, Denmark, Portugal, Norway, Belgium, Iceland, Luxembourg, Italy, and the Netherlands in 1949 to form the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the United States' first &quot;entangling&quot; European alliance in 170 years. West Germany, Spain, Greece, and Turkey would later join this alliance. The Eastern leaders retaliated against these steps by integrating the economies of their nations in [[Comecon]], their version of the [[Marshall Plan]]; exploding the first Soviet [[nuclear weapon|atomic device]] in 1949; signing an alliance with [[People's Republic of China]] in February 1950; and forming the [[Warsaw Pact]], Eastern Europe's counterpart to NATO, in 1955. The Soviet Union, Albania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland founded this military alliance.

===NSC-68===
U.S. officials quickly moved to escalate and expand &quot;containment.&quot; In a secret 1950 document, [[NSC-68]], they proposed to strengthen their alliance systems, quadruple defense spending, and embark on an elaborate propaganda campaign to convince the U.S. public to fight this costly cold war. Truman ordered the development of a [[hydrogen bomb]]. In early 1950, the U.S. took its first efforts to oppose communist forces in Vietnam; planned to form a West German army, and prepared proposals for a peace treaty with Japan that would guarantee long-term U.S. military bases there.

==Chinese Civil War==
{{refimprove|section|date=September 2009}}
{{Main|Chinese Civil War}}
Shortly after World War II, the civil war resumed in China between the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) led by Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the [[Communist Party of China]] led by [[Mao Zedong]]. The USSR had signed a Treaty of Friendship with the Kuomintang in 1945 and disavowed support for the Chinese Communists. The outcome was closely fought, with the Communists finally prevailing with superior military tactics. Although the Nationalists had an advantage in numbers of men and weapons, initially controlled a much larger territory and population than their adversaries, and enjoyed considerable international support, they were exhausted by the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|long war with Japan]] and the attendant internal responsibilities. In addition, the Chinese Communists were able to fill the political vacuum left in [[Manchuria]] after Soviet forces withdrew from the area and thus gained China's prime industrial base. The Chinese Communists were able to fight their way from the north and northeast, and virtually all of [[mainland China]] was taken by the end of 1949. On October 1, [[1949]], Mao Zedong proclaimed the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). Chiang Kai-shek and 600,000 Nationalist troops and 2 million refugees, predominantly from the government and business community, fled from the mainland to the island of [[Taiwan]]. In December 1949, Chiang proclaimed [[Taipei]] the temporary capital of the Republic of China (ROC) and continued to assert his government as the sole legitimate authority in China.

The continued hostility between the Communists on the mainland and the Nationalists on Taiwan continued throughout the Cold War. Though the United States refused to aide Chiang Kai-shek in his hope to &quot;recover the mainland,&quot; it continued supporting the Republic of China with military supplies and expertise to prevent Taiwan from falling into PRC hands. Through the support of the Western bloc (most Western countries continued to recognize the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China), the Republic of China on Taiwan retained [[China and the United Nations|China's seat in the United Nations]] until 1971.

==Korean War==
[[File:Truman initiating Korean involvement.jpg|thumb|right|200px|President Truman signing a proclamation declaring a national emergency that initiates U.S. involvement in the Korean War.]]
{{Main|Korean War}}
In early 1950, the United States made its first commitment to form a peace treaty with Japan that would guarantee long-term U.S. military bases. Some observers (including [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]]) believed that the Japanese treaty led Stalin to approve a plan to invade U.S.-supported [[South Korea]] on June 25, 1950. [[Korea]] had been divided at the end of World War II along the 38th parallel into Soviet and U.S. occupation zones, in which a communist government was installed in the [[North Korea|North]] by the Soviets, and an elected government in the South came to power after UN-supervised elections in 1948. 

In June 1950, [[Kim Il-sung]]'s [[Korean People's Army|North Korean People's Army]] invaded South Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokesbury1990&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= A Short History of the Korean War|last=Stokesbury |first= James L|year= 1990|publisher=Harper Perennial |location= New York|isbn= 0688095135|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fearing that communist Korea under a Kim Il Sung dictatorship could threaten Japan  and foster other communist movements in Asia, Truman committed U.S. forces and obtained help from the [[United Nations]] to counter the North Korean invasion. The Soviets boycotted [[UN Security Council]] meetings while protesting the Council's failure to seat the [[People's Republic of China]] and, thus, did not veto the Council's approval of UN action to oppose the North Korean invasion. A joint UN force of personnel from South Korea, the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Turkey]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[France]], the [[Philippines]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[New Zealand]] and other countries joined to stop the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Fehrenbach, T. R., ''This Kind of War: The Classic Korean War History'', Brassey's, 2001, ISBN 1-57488-334-8, page 305&lt;/ref&gt;  After a Chinese invasion to assist the North Koreans, fighting stabilized along the 38th parallel, which had separated the Koreas. Truman faced a hostile China, a Sino-Soviet partnership, and a defense budget that had quadrupled in eighteen months.

The [[s:Korean Armistice Agreement]] was signed in July 1953 after the death of Stalin, who had been insisting that the North Koreans continue fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Byrd, Peter|editor=McLean, Iain; McMillan, Alistair|encyclopedia=The concise Oxford dictionary of politics|title=Cold War (entire chapter)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xLbEHQAACAAJ&amp;ei=E45VSJrQO4e4jgGh_oWODA|accessdate=2008-06-16|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192802763}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In North Korea, Kim Il-sung created a highly centralized and brutal [[dictatorship]], according himself unlimited power and generating a formidable [[cult of personality]].&lt;ref&gt;Oberdorfer, Don, ''The two Koreas: a contemporary history'', Basic Books, 2001, ISBN 0-465-05162-6, page 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No, Kum-Sok and  J.

==Hydrogen Bomb==
A [[hydrogen bomb]]—which produced [[nuclear fusion]] instead of [[nuclear fission]]—was first tested by the United States in November 1952 and the Soviet Union in August 1953.  Such bombs were first deployed in the 1960s.

==Culture and media==
[[File:DuckandCover.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The title screen from ''Duck and Cover''.]]

{{refimprove|section|date=September 2009}}
Fear of a nuclear war spurred the production of public safety films by the [[Federal Government of the United States|United States federal government's]] [[Civil Defense]] branch that demonstrated ways on protecting oneself from a Soviet nuclear attack.  The 1951 children's film ''[[Duck and Cover (film)|Duck and Cover]]'' is a prime example.

George Orwell's classic dystopia [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] was published in 1949. The novel explores life in an imagined future world where a totalitarian government has achieved terrifying levels of power and control. With Nineteen Eighty-Four, Orwell taps into the anti-communist fears that would continue to haunt so many in the West for decades to come. In a Cold War setting his descriptions could hardly fail to evoke comparison to Soviet communism and the seeming willingness of Stalin and his successors to control those within the Soviet bloc by whatever means necessary. Orwell's famous allegory of totalitarian rule, [[Animal Farm]], published in 1945, provoked similar anti-communist sentiments.

==Significant documents==
*[[Potsdam Declaration]]:  July 26, 1945. An informal statement issued by Harry S. Truman, [[Winston Churchill]], and [[Chiang Kai-Shek]], which outlined the terms for a [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Japanese surrender]].
*[[Baruch Plan]]: 1946. A proposal by the U.S. to the [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission]] (UNAEC) to a) extend between all nations the exchange of basic scientific information for peaceful ends; b) implement control of atomic  energy to the extent necessary to ensure its use only for peaceful purposes; c) eliminate from national armaments atomic weapons and all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction; and d) establish effective safeguards by way of inspection and other means to protect complying States against the hazards of violations and evasions. When the Soviet Union was the only member state which refused to sign, the U.S. embarked on a massive nuclear weapons testing, development, and deployment program.
*The Long Telegram and The &quot;[[X Article]]&quot;, 1946-1947. Formally titled &quot;''The Sources of Soviet Conduct''&quot;. The article describes the concepts that became the foundation of United States Cold War policy and was published in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' in 1947. The article was an expansion of a well-circulated top secret [[State Department]] cable called the X Article and became famous for setting forth the doctrine of containment. Though the article was signed [[pseudonym]]ously by &quot;X,&quot; it was well known at the time that the true author was [[George F. Kennan]], the deputy chief of mission of the United States to the Soviet Union from 1944 to 1946, under [[ambassador]] [[W. Averell Harriman]].
*[[NSC-68]]: April 14, 1950. A [[classified information|classified]] report written and issued by the [[United States National Security Council]]. The report outlined the [[National Security Strategy of the United States]] for that time and provided a comprehensive analysis of the capabilities of the Soviet Union and of the United States from military, economic, political, and psychological standpoints. NSC-68's principal thesis was that the Soviet Union intended to become the single dominant world power. The report argued that the Soviet Union had a systematic strategy aimed at the spread of communism across the entire world, and it recommended that the United States government adopt a policy of containment to stop the further spread of Soviet power. NSC-68 outlined a drastic [[foreign policy]] shift from defensive to active containment and advocated aggressive military preparedness. NSC-68 shaped government actions in the Cold War for the next 20 years and has subsequently been labeled the &quot;blueprint&quot; for the Cold War.
*Speech by [[James F. Byrnes]],  [[United States Secretary of State]] &quot;''[[Restatement of Policy on Germany]]''&quot; [[Stuttgart]] September 6, 1946.  Also known as the &quot;''Speech of hope,''&quot; it set the tone of future U.S. policy as it repudiated the [[Morgenthau Plan]] economic policies and gave the Germans hope for the future. The Western powers worst fear was that the poverty and hunger would drive the Germans to communism. General [[Lucius Clay]] stated &quot;There is no choice between being a communist on 1,500 calories a day and a believer in democracy on a thousand&quot;. The speech was also seen as a stand against the Soviet Union because it stated the firm intention of the United States to maintain a military presence in Europe indefinitely. But the heart of the message was as Byrnes stated a month later &quot;The nub of our program was to win the German people . . . it was a battle between us and Russia over minds. . . .&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Crony capitalism''' is a term describing an allegedly [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy in which success in business depends on close relationships between business people and government officials.  It may be exhibited by favoritism in the distribution of legal permits, government grants, special [[tax break]]s, and so forth.

Crony capitalism is believed to arise when political [[cronyism]] spills over into the business world; self-serving friendships and family ties between businessmen and the government influence the economy and society to the extent that it corrupts [[public good|public-serving]] economic and political ideals.

==Crony capitalism in practice==

[[Image:World Map Index of perception of corruption.png|thumb|[[Transparency International]]'s overview of the index of perception of corruption, 2007]]

In its lightest form, crony capitalism consists of [[collusion]] among market players. While perhaps lightly competing against each other, they will present a unified front to the government in requesting subsidies or aid (sometimes called a trade association or [[industry trade group]]). Newcomers to a market may find it difficult to find loans or acquire shelf space to sell their product; in technological fields, they may be accused of infringing on [[patent]]s that the established competitors never invoke against each other. Distribution networks will refuse to aid the entrant. That said, there will still be competitors who &quot;crack&quot; the system when the legal barriers are light, especially where the old guard has become inefficient and is failing to meet the needs of the market. Of course, some of these upstarts may then join with the established networks to help deter any other new competitors. Examples of this have been argued to include the ''[[keiretsu]]'' of post-war Japan, the print media in India, the ''[[chaebol]]'' of South Korea, and the powerful families who control much of the investment in [[Latin America]].

Crony capitalism is generally associated with more virulent government intervention, however. Intentionally ambiguous laws and regulations are common in such systems. Taken strictly, such laws would greatly impede practically all business; in practice, they are only erratically enforced. The specter of having such laws suddenly brought down upon a business provides incentive to stay in the good graces of political officials. Troublesome rivals who have overstepped their bounds can have the laws suddenly enforced against them, leading to fines or even jail time.

&lt;!-- Please do not list every country in the world, just the ones that are both corrupt AND capitalist enough. Every country has a little, this is only for the best examples.--&gt;

States often said to exhibit crony capitalism include the [[People's Republic of China]]; [[India]], especially up to the early 1990s when  manufacturing was strictly controlled by the government (the &quot;[[Licence Raj]]&quot;); [[Indonesia]]; [[Argentina]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_NSDQQPS Peronism and its perils] on Economist.com accessed at August 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brazil]]; [[Malaysia]]; [[Russia]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_NGGRNJR Having it both ways] on Economist.com accessed at December 30, 2007 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; and most other ex-[[Eastern Bloc]] states. Critics claim that government connections are almost indispensable to business success in these countries. [[Wu Jinglian]], one of China's leading economists&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_NSDVGSD Hu Shuli, crusading Chinese business journalist] on Economist.com accessed at December 30, 2007 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; and a longtime champion of its transition to free markets, says that it faces two starkly contrasting futures: a market economy under the rule of law or crony capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/article_abstract_visitor.aspx?ar=1782 The road ahead for capitalism in China] on The McKinsey Quarterly accessed at December 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cronyism in sections of an economy==

More direct government involvement can lead to specific areas of crony capitalism, even if the economy as a whole may be healthy. Governments will, often in good faith, establish government agencies to regulate an industry. However, the members of an industry have a very strong interest in the actions of a regulatory body, while the rest of the citizenry are only lightly affected. As a result, it is not uncommon for current industry players to gain control of the &quot;watchdog&quot; and use it against competitors. This phenomenon is known as [[regulatory capture]].

A famous early example in the United States would be the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]], which was established in 1887 to regulate the railroad &quot;[[robber baron (industrialist)|robber barons]]&quot;; instead, it quickly became controlled by the railroads, which set up a permit system that was used to deny access to new entrants and functionally legalized [[price fixing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Timothy |last=Lee  |title=Entangling the Web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/03/opinion/03lee.html |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=2006-08-03 |accessdate=2009-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

An example from 2004 would be the case of [[Creekstone Farms Premium Beef|Creekstone Farms]].  After the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|mad cow]] scare, Creekstone decided to test all its cows for mad cow disease.  This would enable them to sell again to Japan, which had blocked import of all American beef that had not been completely tested. After the proper facilities had been built and the personnel hired to make such a change, the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] issued an injunction and refused to allow Creekstone to buy the kits necessary to test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.organicconsumers.org/madcow/preventtesting010305.cfm Beef Giants &amp; USDA Prevent Small Slaughterhouses from Testing for Mad Cow Disease] on Organic Consumer Association accessed at December 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed the larger beef producers to keep costs low and not be out-competed by a smaller rival. Creekstone sued the USDA in response for abrogating free competition in the market.  Economist [[Paul Krugman]] commented that the incident showed that &quot;the imperatives of crony capitalism trump[ed] professed faith in free markets,&quot; at least for the Department of Agriculture at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Krugman |authorlink=Paul Krugman |title=Bad Cow Disease |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/13/opinion/13krugman.html |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=2008-06-13 |accessdate=2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[military-industrial complex]] in the United States is often described as an example of crony capitalism in an industry. Connections with [[The Pentagon]] and lobbyists in Washington are described by critics as more important than actual competition, due to the political and secretive nature of defense contracts.  In the [[Transatlantic relations#Boeing and Airbus subsidies|Airbus-Boeing WTO dispute]], Airbus (which receives outright [[subsidy|subsidies]] from European governments) has stated Boeing receives similar subsidies, which are hidden as inefficient defense contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pulling Boeing Out of a Tailspin |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_50/b3862121_mz029.htm |publisher=''[[Business Week]]'' |quote=A national treasure, once No. 1 in commercial aviation, Boeing has become a risk-averse company stumbling to compete in the marketplace and dependent on political connections and chicanery to get government contracts. Boeing needs a strong board and a rejuvenated corporate culture based on innovation and competitiveness, not crony capitalism. |date=2003-12-15 |accessdate=2009-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In another example, Bechtel, claiming that it should have had a chance to bid for certain contracts, said Halliburton had received no-bid contracts due to having cronies in the Bush administration.

[[Gerald P. O'Driscoll]], former vice president at the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas]], stated that [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] became examples of crony capitalism. Government backing let Fannie and Freddie dominate mortgage underwriting. &quot;The politicians created the mortgage giants, which then returned some of the profits to the pols - sometimes directly, as campaign funds; sometimes as &quot;contributions&quot; to favored constituents.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/09092008/postopinion/opedcolumnists/fannie_freddie_bailout_baloney_128135.htm | work=New York Post | title=Fannie/Freddie Bailout Baloney | first=Gerald P. | last=O'Driscoll Jr | date=September 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of crony capitalism in developing economies==

In its worst form, crony capitalism can devolve into simple [[Political corruption|corruption]], where any pretense of a free market is dispensed with. Bribes to government officials are considered ''de rigueur'' and [[tax evasion]] is common; this is seen in many parts of Africa, for instance.  This is sometimes called [[plutocracy]] (rule by wealth) or [[kleptocracy]] (rule by theft).

Corrupt governments may favor one set of business owners who have close ties to the government over others. This may also be done with racial, religious, or ethnic favoritsm; for instance, [[Alawites]] in [[Syria]] have a disproportionate share of power in the government and business there. ([[Bashar al-Assad|President Assad]] is an Alawite.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/world/asia/01makhlouf.html?_r=1&amp;hp Syrian Businessman Becomes Magnet for Anger and Dissent] &quot;Like Mr. Ezz in Egypt, he has become a symbol of how economic reforms turned crony socialism into crony capitalism, making the poor poorer and the connected rich fantastically wealthier.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This can be explained by considering personal relationships as a [[social network]]. As government and business leaders try to accomplish various things, they naturally turn to other powerful people for support in their endeavors. These people form hubs in the network. In a developing country those hubs may be very few, thus concentrating economic and political power in a small interlocking group.

Normally, this will be untenable to maintain in business; new entrants will affect the market. However, if business and government are entwined, then the government can maintain the small-hub network.

==Political viewpoints==

Critics of capitalism including [[socialism|socialists]] and other [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalists]] often assert that crony capitalism is the inevitable result of ''any'' capitalist system. [[Jane Jacobs]] described it as a natural consequence of collusion between those managing [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[trade]], while [[Noam Chomsky]] has argued that the word &quot;crony&quot; is superfluous when describing capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20081114.htm &quot;Black Faces in Limousines:&quot; A Conversation with Noam Chomsky] from chomsky.info accessed on June 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Since businesses make money and money leads to political power, business will inevitably use their power to influence governments. Much of the impetus behind [[campaign finance reform]] in the United States and in other countries is an attempt to prevent economic power being used to take political power.

Capitalists oppose crony capitalism as well, but consider it an aberration brought on by governmental favors incompatible with a true [[free market]]. Sometimes it is referred to as &quot;state [[corporatism]].&quot; In this view, crony capitalism is the result of an excess of socialist-style interference in the market, which requires active corporate lobbying to reduce red tape. In fact, some have advocated use of the term &quot;crony socialism&quot; instead to emphasize that the only way to run a profitable business in such systems is to have help from corrupt government officials. These advocates point to the higher levels of interaction between corporations and governments that are considered more socialist, taken to its maximum in the form of [[nationalization]] of industries. Even if the initial regulation was well-intentioned (to curb actual abuses), and even if the initial lobbying by corporations was well-intentioned (to reduce illogical regulations), the mixture of business and government eventually proves poisonous.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} In his book ''The Myth of the Robber Barons'', [[Burton W. Folsom, Jr.]] distinguished those that engage in crony capitalism—designated by him &quot;political entrepreneurs&quot;—from those who compete in the marketplace without special aid from government, whom he calls &quot;market entrepreneurs.&quot;

Socialist economists have criticized the term as an ideologically motivated attempt to cast what is in their view the fundamental problems of capitalism as avoidable irregularities. The term &quot;crony capitalism&quot; made its first significant impact in the public arena as an explanation of the [[Asian financial crisis]]. This explanation is frequently dismissed as apologetics for failures of neoliberal policy and more fundamental weaknesses of market allocation. According to socialist economist [[Robin Hahnel]],

:IMF officials Michel Camdessus and Stanley Fischer were quick to explain that the afflicted economies had only themselves to blame. Crony capitalism, lack of transparency, accounting procedures not up to international standards, and weak-kneed politicians too quick to spend and too afraid to tax were the problems according to IMF and US Treasury Department officials. The fact that the afflicted economies had been held up as paragons of virtue and IMF/World Bank success stories only a year before, the fact that neoliberalism’s only success story had been the Newly Industrialized Countries (NIC's) who were now in the tank, and the fact that the IMF and Treasury department story just didn’t fit the facts since the afflicted economies were no more rife with crony capitalism, lack of transparency, and weak-willed politicians than dozens of other economies untouched by the Asian financial crisis, simply did not matter.&lt;ref&gt;Hahnel, Robin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Other uses|Constitution (disambiguation)}}

A '''constitution''' is a set of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a [[State (polity)|state]] or other organization is governed.&lt;ref&gt;''The [[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'', Second Edn., [[Erin McKean]] (editor), 2051 pages, May 2005, Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-517077-6.&lt;/ref&gt; These rules together make up, i.e. constitute, what the entity is. When these principles are written down into a single or set of legal documents, those documents may be said to comprise a written constitution.

Constitutions concern different levels of organizations, from sovereign states to companies and unincorporated associations. A [[treaty]] which establishes an [[international organization]] is also its constitution in that it would define how that organization is constituted. Within [[state (polity)|state]]s, whether [[sovereign state|sovereign]] or [[federated state|federated]], a constitution defines the principles upon which the state is based, the procedure in which laws are made and by whom. Some constitutions, especially written constitutions, also act as limiters of state power by establishing lines which a state's rulers cannot cross such as [[fundamental rights]].

The [[Constitution of India]] is the longest written constitution of any sovereign country in the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;longest&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Pylee | first = M.V. | authorlink = | title = India's Constitution | publisher = S.

Ltd.| page = 363| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=smahlYxg-8YC&amp;pg=PA363| isbn = 9788120339798}}&lt;/ref&gt; 12 schedules and 94 amendments, with 117,369 words in its [[English language]] version,&lt;ref name=&quot;lawmin_info&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/welcome.html |title=Constitution of India |accessdate=2008-12-17 |work= |publisher=Ministry of Law and Justice of India |date=July, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[United States Constitution]] is the shortest written constitution, at 7 articles and 27 amendments.&lt;ref name=&quot;shortest&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushistory.org/tour/tour_ncc.htm |title=National Constitution Center |accessdate=2010-04-22 |publisher=Independence Hall Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Etymology ==
The term ''constitution'' comes through [[French (language)|French]] from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''constitutio'', used for regulations and orders, such as the [[Roman Emperor|imperial]] enactments  (''constitutiones principis'': edicta, mandata, decreta, rescripta).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2MqfUsMiDbYC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=%22constitutiones+principis%22 The historical and institutional context of Roman law, George Mousourakis, 2003, p. 243]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the term was widely used in [[canon law]] for an important determination, especially a decree issued by the [[Pope]], now referred to as an ''[[apostolic constitution]]''.

== General features ==
Generally, every modern written constitution confers specific powers to an organization or institutional entity, established upon the primary condition that it abides by the said constitution's limitations. According to Scott Gordon, a political organization is constitutional to the extent that it &quot;contain[s] [[institution]]alized mechanisms of power control for the protection of the interests and [[Liberty|liberties]] of the [[citizenry]], including those that may be in the [[Minority group|minority]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gordon |first=Scott |title=Controlling the State: Constitutionalism from Ancient Athens to Today |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1999 |page=4 |isbn=0674169875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin term ''[[ultra vires]]'' describes activities of officials within an organization or polity that fall outside the constitutional or statutory authority of those officials. For example, a [[students' union]] may be prohibited as an organization from engaging in activities not concerning students; if the union becomes involved in non-student activities these activities are considered ''ultra vires'' of the union's charter, and nobody would be compelled by the charter to follow them. An example from the constitutional law of [[sovereign state]]s would be a provincial government in a [[federal state]] trying to legislate in an area exclusively enumerated to the federal government in the constitution, such as ratifying a treaty. ''Ultra vires'' gives a legal justification for the forced cessation of such action, which might be enforced by the people with the support of a decision of the [[judiciary]], in a case of [[judicial review]]. A violation of rights by an official would be ''ultra vires'' because a (constitutional) right is a restriction on the powers of government, and therefore that official would be exercising powers he doesn't have.

In most but not all modern states the constitution has supremacy over ordinary statute law (see [[#Uncodified constitution|Uncodified constitution]] below); in such states when an official act is unconstitutional, i.e. it is not a power granted to the government by the constitution, that act is ''null and void'', and the nullification is ''[[ab initio]]'', that is, from inception, not from the date of the finding. It was never &quot;law&quot;, even though, if it had been a statute or statutory provision, it might have been adopted according to the procedures for adopting legislation. Sometimes the problem is not that a statute is unconstitutional, but the application of it is, on a particular occasion, and a court may decide that while there are ways it could be applied that are constitutional, that instance was not allowed or legitimate. In such a case, only the application may be ruled unconstitutional. Historically, the remedy for such violations have been petitions for common law [[writ]]s, such as ''[[quo warranto]]''.

== History and development ==
=== Early constitutions ===
Excavations in modern-day [[Iraq]] by [[Ernest de Sarzec]] in 1877 found evidence of the earliest known code of justice, issued by the [[Sumer]]ian king [[Urukagina]] of [[Lagash]] ''ca'' 2300 BC.  Perhaps the earliest prototype for a law of government, this document itself has not yet been discovered; however it is known that it allowed some rights to his citizens.  For example, it is known that it relieved tax for widows and orphans, and protected the poor from the [[usury]] of the rich.
[[File:Hammurabi.jpg|thumb|200px|Detail from [[Hammurabi]]'s [[stele]] shows him receiving the laws of [[Babylon]] from the seated [[sun deity]].]]
After that, many governments ruled by special codes of written laws.  The oldest such document still known to exist seems to be the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] of [[Ur]] (''ca'' 2050 BC). Some of the better-known ancient law codes include the code of [[Lipit-Ishtar]] of [[Isin]], the [[code of Hammurabi]] of [[Babylonia]], the [[Hittite laws|Hittite code]], the [[Assyrian law|Assyrian code]] and [[613 Commandments|Mosaic law]].

=== Later constitutions===
[[File:Aristotle-constitutions-2.png|thumb|350px|Diagram illustrating the classification of constitutions by [[Aristotle]].]]

==== Athens ====
In 621 BC a scribe named [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]] codified the cruel oral laws of the [[city-state]] of [[Athens]]; this code prescribed the [[death penalty]] for many offences (nowadays very severe rules are often called &quot;[[Draco (lawgiver)#&quot;Draconian&quot;|Draconian]]&quot;).  In 594 BC [[Solon]], the ruler of Athens, created the new ''[[Solonian Constitution]]''.  It eased the burden of the workers, and determined that membership of the ruling class was to be based on wealth ([[plutocracy]]), rather than by birth ([[aristocracy]]). [[Cleisthenes of Athens|Cleisthenes]] again reformed the Athenian constitution and set it on a democratic footing in 508 BC.

[[Aristotle]] (''ca'' 350 BC) was one of the first in recorded history to make a formal distinction between ordinary law and constitutional law, establishing ideas of constitution and [[constitutionalism]], and attempting to classify different forms of constitutional government. The most basic definition he used to describe a constitution in general terms was &quot;the arrangement of the offices in a state&quot;. In his works ''[[Constitution of Athens]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', and ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' he explores different constitutions of his day, including those of Athens, [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Sparta]], and [[Carthage]]. He classified both what he regarded as good and what he regarded as bad constitutions, and came to the conclusion that the best constitution was a mixed system, including monarchic, aristocratic, and democratic elements. He also distinguished between citizens, who had the right to participate in the state, and non-citizens and slaves, who did not.

==== Rome ====
The Romans first codified their constitution in 450 BC as the ''[[Twelve Tables]]''. They operated under a series of laws that were added from time to time, but [[Roman law]] was never reorganised into a single code until the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'' (AD 438); later, in the Eastern Empire the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|''Codex repetitæ prælectionis'']] (534) was highly influential throughout Europe. This was followed in the east by the ''Ecloga'' of [[Leo III the Isaurian]] (740) and the ''Basilica'' of [[Basil I]] (878).

;India
The ''[[Edicts of Ashoka]]'' established constitutional principles for the 3rd century BC [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] king's rule in [[History of India|Ancient India]].

;Germania
Many of the Germanic peoples that filled the power vacuum left by the Western Roman Empire in the [[Early Middle Ages]] codified their laws.  One of the first of these [[Germanic tribal laws|Germanic law codes]] to be written was the Visigothic ''Code of [[Euric]]'' (471).  This was followed by the ''[[Lex Burgundionum]]'', applying separate codes for Germans and for Romans; the ''[[Lex Alamannorum|Pactus Alamannorum]]''; and the [[Salic Law]] of the [[Franks]], all written soon after 500.  In 506, the ''[[Breviary of Alaric|Breviarum]]'' or ''&quot;Lex Romana&quot;'' of [[Alaric II]], king of the Visigoths, adopted and consolidated the ''Codex Theodosianus'' together with assorted earlier Roman laws. Systems that appeared somewhat later include the ''[[Edictum Rothari]]'' of the [[Lombards]] (643), the ''[[Lex Visigothorum]]'' (654), the ''Lex Alamannorum'' (730) and the ''[[Lex Frisionum]]'' (''ca'' 785). These continental codes were all composed in Latin, whilst [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] was used for those of England, beginning with the Code of [[Ethelbert of Kent]] (602). In ca. 893, [[Alfred the Great]] combined this and two other earlier Saxon codes, with various Mosaic and Christian precepts, to produce the [[Doom book|''Doom Book'']] code of laws for England.

;Japan
[[Japan]]'s ''[[Seventeen-article constitution]]'' written in 604, reportedly by [[Prince Shotoku|Prince Shōtoku]], is an early example of a constitution in Asian political history. Influenced by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings, the document focuses more on social morality than institutions of government ''per se'' and remains a notable early attempt at a government constitution. Another is the ''[[Constitution of Medina]]'', drafted by the prophet of [[Islam]], [[Muhammad]], in 622. It is said to be one of the earliest constitutions which guarantees basic rights to religions and adherents as well as reinforcing a judiciary process regarding the rules of warfare, tax and civil disputes.

;Medina
The [[Constitution of Medina]] ({{lang-ar|صحیفة المدینه}}, Ṣaḥīfat al-Madīna), also known as the '''Charter of Medina''', was drafted by the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. It constituted a formal agreement between [[Muhammad]] and all of the significant tribes and families of Yathrib (later known as [[Medina]]), including [[Muslim]]s, [[Jew]]s, and [[pagan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*Reuven Firestone, ''Jihād: the origin of holy war in Islam‎'' (1999) p. 118;
*&quot;Muhammad&quot;, ''Encyclopedia of Islam Online''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watt. Muhammad at Medina and R. B. Serjeant &quot;The Constitution of Medina.&quot; ''Islamic Quarterly'' 8 (1964) p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The document was drawn up with the explicit concern of bringing to an end the bitter inter tribal fighting between the clans of the Aws ([[Banu Aus|Aus]]) and [[Khazraj]] within Medina.  To this effect it instituted a number of rights and responsibilities for the [[Muslim]], [[Jew]]ish, and pagan communities of Medina bringing them within the fold of one community—the [[Ummah]].&lt;ref&gt;R. B. Serjeant, ''The Sunnah Jami'ah, pacts with the Yathrib Jews, and the Tahrim of Yathrib: Analysis and translation of the documents comprised in the so-called &quot;Constitution of Medina.&quot; Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 41, No. 1. 1978), page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise dating of the Constitution of Medina remains debated but generally scholars agree it was written shortly after the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] (622).&lt;ref&gt;Watt. ''Muhammad at Medina''. pp. 227-228 Watt argues that the initial agreement was shortly after the hijra and the document was amended at a later date specifically after the battle of Badr (AH [anno hijra] 2, = AD 624). Serjeant argues that the constitution is in fact 8 different treaties which can be dated according to events as they transpired in Medina with the first treaty being written shortly after Muhammad's arrival. R. B. Serjeant. &quot;The Sunnah Jâmi'ah, Pacts with the Yathrib Jews, and the Tahrîm of Yathrib: Analysis and Translation of the Documents Comprised in the so called 'Constitution of Medina'.&quot; in ''The Life of Muhammad: The Formation of the Classical Islamic World'': Volume iv.

Wellhausen argues that it belongs to the first year of Muhammad's residence in Medina, before the battle of Badr in 2/624.  Wellhausen bases this judgement on three considerations; first Muhammad is very diffident about his own position, he accepts the Pagan tribes within the Umma, and maintains the Jewish clans as clients of the Ansars see Wellhausen, Excursus, p. 158. Even Moshe Gil a skeptic of Islamic history argues that it was written within 5 months of Muhammad's arrival in Medina. Moshe Gil. &quot;The Constitution of Medina: A Reconsideration.&quot; ''Israel Oriental Studies'' 4 (1974): p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; It effectively established the first Islamic state.  The Constitution established: the security of the community, religious freedoms, the role of Medina as a [[haram]] or sacred place (barring all violence and weapons), the security of women, stable tribal relations within Medina, a tax system for supporting the community in time of conflict, parameters for exogenous political alliances, a system for granting protection of individuals, a judicial system for resolving disputes, and also regulated the paying of [[Blood money (term)|Blood money]] (the payment between families or tribes for the slaying of an individual in lieu of [[Eye for an eye|lex talionis]]).

;Wales
In Wales, the [[Welsh law|''Cyfraith Hywel'']] was codified by [[Hywel Dda]] c. 942–950.

;Rus
The ''Pravda Yaroslava'', originally combined by [[Yaroslav the Wise]] the [[List of Ukrainian rulers|Grand Prince of Kiev]], was granted to [[Great Novgorod]] around 1017, and in 1054 was incorporated into the ''[[Russkaya Pravda]]'', that became the law for all of [[Kievan Rus]]. It survived only in later editions of the 15th century.

;Iroquois
{{main|Great Law of Peace}}
The ''Gayanashagowa'', the oral constitution of the [[Iroquois]] nation also known as the Great Law of Peace, established a system of governance in which [[sachem]]s (tribal chiefs) of the members of the Iroquois League made decisions on the basis of universal consensus of all chiefs following discussions that were initiated by a single tribe.  The position of sachem descended through families, and were allocated by senior female relatives.&lt;ref name = Tooker&gt;{{cite book |editor=Clifton JA |title=The Invented Indian: cultural fictions and government policies |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Brunswick, N.J., U.S.A |year=1990 |pages= [http://books.google.ca/books?id=ARbVmr941TsC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 107–128] | chapter = The United States Constitution and the Iroquois League |isbn=1-56000-745-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2010-11-24 | author = Tooker E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;England
In [[England]], [[Henry I of England|Henry I's]] proclamation of the [[Charter of Liberties]] in 1100 bound the king for the first time in his treatment of the clergy and the nobility. This idea was extended and refined by the English barony when they forced [[John of England|King John]] to sign ''[[Magna Carta]]'' in 1215. The most important single article of the ''Magna Carta'', related to &quot;''[[habeas corpus]]''&quot;, provided that the king was not permitted to imprison, outlaw, exile or kill anyone at a whim—there must be [[due process]] of law first. This article, Article 39, of the ''Magna Carta'' read:

''No free man shall be arrested, or imprisoned, or deprived of his property, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any way destroyed, nor shall we go against him or send against him, unless by legal judgement of his peers, or by the law of the land.''

This provision became the cornerstone of English liberty after that point. The [[social contract]] in the original case was between the king and the nobility, but was gradually extended to all of the people. It led to the system of [[Constitutional Monarchy]], with further reforms shifting the balance of power from the monarchy and nobility to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].

;Serbia
The [[Nomocanon]] of [[Saint Sava]] ({{lang-sr|'''Zakonopravilo'''}})&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.se/books?id=QDFVUDmAIqIC&amp;pg=PA118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.search.com/reference/Nomocanon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alanwatson.org/sr/petarzoric.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was the first [[Serbia]]n constitution from 1219. This [[legal act]] was well developed. [[St. Sava's Nomocanon]] was the compilation of [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]], based on [[Roman Law]] and [[Canon law]], based on [[Ecumenical Councils]] and its basic purpose was to organize functioning of the young [[Serbia in the Middle Ages|Serbian kingdom]] and the [[Serbian Ortodox Church|Serbian church]]. Saint Sava began the work on the Serbian Nomocanon in 1208 while being at [[Mount Athos]], using ''The Nomocanon in Fourteen Titles'', ''Synopsis of Stefan the Efesian'', ''Nomocanon of [[John Scholasticus]]'', Ecumenical Councils' documents, which he modified with the canonical commentaries of Aristinos and [[John Zonaras]], local church meetings, rules of the [[Holy Fathers]], the law of [[Moses]], translation of Prohiron and the [[Byzantine emperors]]' [[Novellae Constitutiones|Novellae]] (most were taken from [[Justinian]]'s Novellae). The Nomocanon was completely new compilation of civil and canonical regulations, taken from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] sources, but completed and reformed by St. Sava to function properly in Serbia. Beside decrees that organized the life of church, there are various norms regarding civil life, most of them were taken from Prohiron. [[Legal transplants]] of [[Roman Law|Roman]]-[[Byzantine law]] became the basis of the Serbian medieval law. The essence of Zakonopravilo was based on [[Corpus Iuris Civilis]].

;Hungary
In 1222, Hungarian King [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]] issued the [[Golden Bull of 1222]].

;Saxony
Between 1220 and 1230, a [[Saxony|Saxon]] administrator, [[Eike von Repgow]], composed the ''[[Sachsenspiegel]]'', which became the supreme law used in parts of Germany as late as 1900.

;Mali Empire
In 1236, [[Sundiata Keita]] presented an oral constitution federating the [[Mali Empire]], called the ''[[Kouroukan Fouga]]''.

;Ethiopia
Meanwhile, around 1240, the [[Copt]]ic Egyptian Christian writer, [['Abul Fada'il Ibn al-'Assal]], wrote the ''[[Fetha Negest]]'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]].  'Ibn al-Assal took his laws partly from apostolic writings and Mosaic law, and partly from the former Byzantine codes.  There are a few historical records claiming that this law code was translated into [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] and entered Ethiopia around 1450 in the reign of [[Zara Yaqob]].  Even so, its first recorded use in the function of a constitution (supreme law of the land) is with [[Sarsa Dengel]] beginning in 1563.  The ''Fetha Negest'' remained the supreme law in Ethiopia until 1931, when a modern-style [[Constitution of Ethiopia|Constitution]] was first granted by Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] I.

;Serbia
[[Stefan Dušan]], Emperor of Serbs and Greeks, enacted [[Dušan's Code]] ({{lang-sr|'''Dušanov Zakonik'''}})&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dusanov-zakonik.com/indexe.html&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Serbia]], in two state congresses: in 1349 in [[Skopje]] and in 1354 in [[Serres]]. It regulated all social spheres, so it was the second Serbian constitution, after St. Sava's Nomocanon (Zakonopravilo). The Code was based on [[Roman Law|Roman]]-[[Byzantine law]]. The legal [[Legal transplants|transplanting]] is notable with the articles 171 and 172 of Dušan's Code, which regulated the juridical independence. They were taken from the Byzantine code [[Basilika]] (book VII, 1, 16-17).

;China
In [[China]], the [[Hongwu Emperor]] created and refined a document he called ''[[Ancestral Injunctions]]'' (first published in 1375, revised twice more before his death in 1398). These rules served in a very real sense as a constitution for the [[Ming Dynasty]] for the next 250 years.

;Sardinia
In 1392 the '''Carta de Logu''' was [[legal code]] of the [[Giudicato of Arborea]] promulgated by the ''giudicessa'' [[Eleanor of Arborea|Eleanor]]. It was in force in [[Sardinia]] until it was superseded by the code of [[Charles Felix of Sardinia|Charles Felix]] in April 1827. The Carta was a work of great importance in [[Sardinia]]n history. It was an organic, coherent, and systematic work of legislation encompassing the [[Civil law (area)|civil]] and [[penal law]].

=== Modern constitutions===
[[File:Pylyp-orlyk-constitution-1710.jpg|thumb|upright|The Bendery Constitution by Hetman [[Pylyp Orlyk]].]]

The earliest written constitution still governing a sovereign nation today may be that of [[San Marino]]. The ''[[Constitution of San Marino|Leges Statutae Republicae Sancti Marini]]'' was written in Latin and consists of six books. The first book, with 62 articles, establishes councils, courts, various executive officers and the powers assigned to them. The remaining books cover criminal and civil law, judicial procedures and remedies. Written in 1600, the document was based upon the ''Statuti Comunali'' (Town Statute) of 1300, itself influenced by the ''Codex Justinianus'', and it remains in force today.

In 1639, the [[Colony of Connecticut]] adopted the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], which is considered the first [[North America]]n constitution, and is the basis for every new Connecticut constitution since, and is also the reason for [[Connecticut]]'s nickname, &quot;the [[Constitution State]]&quot;. England had two short-lived written Constitutions during Cromwellian rule, known as the [[Instrument of Government]] (1653), and [[Humble Petition and Advice]] (1657).

''[[Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk|Agreements and Constitutions of Laws and Freedoms of the Zaporizian Host]]'' can be acknowledged as the first European constitution in a modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.venice.coe.int/docs/1996/CDL-STD(1996)018-e.asp Pylyp Orlyk Constitution]'', European commission for democracy through law (Venice Commission) The Constitutional Heritage of Europe. Montpellier, 22–23 November 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; It was written in 1710 by [[Pylyp Orlyk]], ''hetman'' of the [[Zaporozhian Host]]. This ''&quot;[[Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk]]&quot;'' (as it is widely known) was written to establish a free Zaporozhian-Ukrainian Republic, with the support of [[Charles XII of Sweden]]. It is notable in that it established a democratic standard for the separation of powers in government between the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches, well before the publication of Montesquieu's ''[[Spirit of the Laws]]''. This Constitution also limited the executive authority of the ''hetman'', and established a democratically elected Cossack parliament called the General Council. However, Orlyk's project for an independent [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] State never materialized, and his constitution, written in exile, never went into effect.

Other examples of early European constitutions were the [[Corsican Constitution]] of 1755 and the [[Swedish Constitution of 1772]].

All of the British colonies in North America that were to become the 13 original United States, adopted their own constitutions in 1776 and 1777, during the American Revolution (and before the later [[Articles of Confederation]] and [[United States Constitution]]), with the exceptions of Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. The [[Massachusetts|Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] adopted its Constitution in 1780, the oldest still-functioning constitution of any U.S. state; while Connecticut and Rhode Island officially continued to operate under their old colonial charters, until they adopted their first state constitutions in 1818 and 1843, respectively.

==== Enlightenment constitutions ====
What is sometimes called the ''&quot;enlightened constitution&quot;'' model was developed by philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] such as Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and John Locke. The model proposed that constitutional governments should be stable, adaptable, accountable, open and should represent the people (i.e. support democracy).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/134169/constitution&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Constitution, ratified June 21, 1788, was influenced by the British constitutional system and the political system of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], plus the writings of [[Polybius]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], and others. The document became a benchmark for [[republicanism]] and codified constitutions written thereafter.

The [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] served as a model for other liberal constitutions of several [[South Europe|South-European]] and [[Latin America]]n nations like [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|Portuguese Constitution of 1822]], constitutions of various [[Italy|Italian]] states during [[Carbonari]] revolts (i.e. in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]), or [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Mexican Constitution of 1824]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Payne |first= Stanley G. |authorlink=Stanley G.

Italian liberalism in 1820-1821 relied on junior officers and the provincial middle classes, essentially the same social base as in Spain. It even used a Hispanized political vocabulary, for it was led by ''giunte'' (juntas), appointed local ''capi politici'' (''jefes políticos''), used the terms of ''liberali'' and ''servili'' (emulating the Spanish word serviles applied to supporters of absolutism), and in the end talked of resisting by means of a ''guerrilla''.

However the Norwegians managed to infuse a radically democratic and liberal [[Constitution of Norway|constitution]] in 1814, adopting many facets from the American constitution and the revolutionary French ones; but maintaining a hereditary [[Constitutional monarchy|monarch]] limited by the constitution, like the Spanish one. The [[Serbian revolution]] initially led to a proclamation of a proto-constitution in 1811, which was the first such legal act in [[Central and Eastern Europe]];{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} the full-fledged Constitution of Serbia followed few decades later, in 1835, by which also the country became the first constitutional monarchy in that part of Europe.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

== Principles of constitutional design ==
After tribal people first began to live in cities and establish nations, many of these functioned according to unwritten customs, while some developed autocratic, even tyrannical monarchs, who [[rule by decree|ruled by decree]], or mere personal whim. Such rule led some thinkers to take the position that what mattered was not the design of governmental institutions and operations, as much as the character of the rulers. This view can be seen in [[Plato]], who called for rule by &quot;philosopher-kings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;'' Aristotle, by Francesco Hayez&lt;/ref&gt; Later writers, such as [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]] and [[Plutarch]], would examine designs for government from a legal and historical standpoint.

The [[Renaissance]] brought a series of political philosophers who wrote implied criticisms of the practices of monarchs and sought to identify principles of constitutional design that would be likely to yield more effective and just governance from their viewpoints. This began with revival of the Roman [[law of nations]] concept&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.constitution.org/victoria/victoria_.htm Relectiones]'', Franciscus de Victoria (lect. 1532, first pub. 1557).&lt;/ref&gt; and its application to the relations among nations, and they sought to establish customary &quot;laws of war and peace&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Law of War and Peace]]'', Hugo Grotius (1625)&lt;/ref&gt; to ameliorate wars and make them less likely. This led to considerations of what authority monarchs or other officials have and don't have, from where that authority derives, and the remedies for the abuse of such authority.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.constitution.org/vct/vct.htm Vindiciae Contra Tyrannos (Defense of Liberty Against Tyrants)]'', &quot;Junius Brutus&quot; (Orig. Fr. 1581, Eng. tr. 1622, 1688)&lt;/ref&gt;

A seminal juncture in this line of discourse arose in England from the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], the [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] [[Commonwealth of England|Protectorate]], the writings of [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Samuel Rutherford]], the [[Levellers]], [[John Milton]], and [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], leading to the debate between [[Robert Filmer]], arguing for the divine right of monarchs, on the one side, and on the other, [[Henry Neville (writer)|Henry Neville]], [[James Tyrrell (writer)|James Tyrrell]], [[Algernon Sidney]], and [[John Locke]]. What arose from the latter was a concept of government being erected on the foundations of first, a state of nature governed by natural laws, then a state of society, established by a social contract or compact, which bring underlying natural or social laws, before governments are formally established on them as foundations.

Along the way several writers examined how the design of government was important, even if the government were headed by a monarch. They also classified various historical examples of governmental designs, typically into democracies, aristocracies, or monarchies, and considered how just and effective each tended to be and why, and how the advantages of each might be obtained by combining elements of each into a more complex design that balanced competing tendencies. Some, such as [[Montesquieu]], also examined how the functions of government, such as legislative, executive, and judicial, might appropriately be separated into branches. The prevailing theme among these writers was that the design of constitutions is not completely arbitrary or a matter of taste. They generally held that there are underlying principles of design that constrain all constitutions for every polity or organization. Each built on the ideas of those before concerning what those principles might be.

The later writings of [[Orestes Brownson]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=2053 ''The American Republic: its Constitution, Tendencies, and Destiny''], O. A. Brownson (1866)&lt;/ref&gt; would try to explain what constitutional designers were trying to do. According to Brownson there are, in a sense, three &quot;constitutions&quot; involved: The first the ''constitution of nature'' that includes all of what was called &quot;natural law.&quot; The second is the ''constitution of society'', an unwritten and commonly understood set of rules for the society formed by a social contract before it establishes a government, by which it establishes the third, a ''constitution of government''. The second would include such elements as the making of decisions by public [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]] called by [[public notice]] and conducted by established [[Parliamentary procedure|rules of procedure]]. Each constitution must be consistent with, and derive its authority from, the ones before it, as well as from a historical act of society formation or constitutional ratification. Brownson argued that a [[state (polity)|state]] is a society with effective dominion over a well-defined territory, that consent to a well-designed constitution of government arises from presence on that territory, and that it is possible for provisions of a written constitution of government to be &quot;unconstitutional&quot; if they are inconsistent with the constitutions of nature or society. Brownson argued that it is not ratification alone that makes a written constitution of government legitimate, but that it must also be competently designed and applied.

Other writers&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Constitutional Design'', Donald S. Lutz (2006) ISBN 0-521-86168-3&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that such considerations apply not only to all national constitutions of government, but also to the constitutions of private organizations, that it is not an accident that the constitutions that tend to satisfy their members contain certain elements, as a minimum, or that their provisions tend to become very similar as they are amended after experience with their use. Provisions that give rise to certain kinds of questions are seen to need additional provisions for how to resolve those questions, and provisions that offer no course of action may best be omitted and left to policy decisions. Provisions that conflict with what Brownson and others can discern are the underlying &quot;constitutions&quot; of nature and society tend to be difficult or impossible to execute, or to lead to unresolvable disputes.

Constitutional design has been treated as a kind of [[metagame]] in which play consists of finding the best design and provisions for a written constitution that will be the rules for the game of government, and that will be most likely to optimize a balance of the utilities of justice, liberty, and security. An example is the metagame [[Nomic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/psa/ The Paradox of Self-Amendment], byPeter Suber (1990) ISBN 0-8204-1212-0&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governmental constitutions ==
[[File:Red copy of the Russian constitution.jpg|thumb|upright|[[President of Russia|Presidential]] copy of the [[Russian Constitution]].]]

Most commonly, the term ''constitution'' refers to a set of rules and principles that define the nature and extent of government. Most constitutions seek to regulate the relationship between institutions of the state, in a basic sense the relationship between the executive, legislature and the judiciary, but also the relationship of institutions within those branches. For example,  executive branches can be divided into a head of government, government departments/ministries, executive agencies and a [[civil service]]/bureaucracy. Most constitutions also attempt to define the relationship between individuals and the state, and to establish the broad rights of individual citizens. It is thus the most basic law of a territory from which all the other laws and rules are hierarchically derived; in some territories it is in fact called &quot;[[Basic Law]]&quot;.

=== Key features ===
The following are features of democratic constitutions that have been identified by political scientists to exist, in one form or another, in virtually all national constitutions.

==== Codification ====
A fundamental classification is codification or lack of codification. A codified constitution is one that is contained in a single document, which is the single source of constitutional law in a state. An uncodified constitution is one that is not contained in a single document, consisting of several different sources, which may be written or unwritten.

===== Codified constitution =====
Most states in the world have codified constitutions.

Codified constitutions are often the product of some dramatic political change, such as a [[revolution]]. The process by which a country adopts a constitution is closely tied to the historical and political context driving this fundamental change. The legitimacy (and often the longevity) of codified constitutions has often been tied to the process by which they are initially adopted.

States that have codified constitutions normally give the constitution supremacy over ordinary [[statute]] law. That is, if there is any conflict between a legal statute and the codified constitution, all or part of the statute can be declared ''ultra vires'' by a court, and struck down as [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. In addition, exceptional procedures are often required to [[constitutional amendment|amend a constitution]].  These procedures may include: convocation of a special [[constituent assembly]] or constitutional convention, requiring a [[supermajority]] of legislators' votes, the consent of regional legislatures, a [[referendum]] process, and other procedures that make amending a constitution more difficult than passing a simple law.

Constitutions may also provide that their most basic principles can never be abolished, even by amendment. In case a formally valid amendment of a constitution infringes these principles protected against any amendment, it may constitute a so-called ''unconstitutional constitutional law''.

Codified constitutions normally consist of a ceremonial [[preamble]], which sets forth the goals of the state and the motivation for the constitution, and several [[Article (law)|article]]s containing the substantive provisions. The preamble, which is omitted in some constitutions, may contain a [[Constitutional references to God|reference to God]] and/or to fundamental values of the state such as liberty, democracy or human rights.

===== Uncodified constitution =====
{{Main|Uncodified constitution}}
[[File:Magna Carta.jpg|thumb|[[Magna Carta]]]]
{{As of|2010}} at least three states have uncodified constitutions: [[Israel]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Uncodified constitutions (also known as unwritten constitutions) are the product of an &quot;evolution&quot; of laws and conventions over centuries. By contrast to codified constitutions, in the [[Westminster System|Westminster]] tradition that originated in England, uncodified constitutions include written sources: e.g. constitutional statutes enacted by the Parliament ([[House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975]], [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]], [[Scotland Act 1998]], [[Government of Wales Act 1998]], [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]] and [[Human Rights Act 1998]]); and also unwritten sources: [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional conventions]], observation of [[precedent]]s, [[royal prerogative]]s, [[convention (norm)|custom]] and tradition, such as always holding the General Election on Thursdays; together these constitute the [[British constitutional law]]. In the days of the [[British Empire]], the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] acted as the constitutional court for many of the British colonies such as [[Canada]] and [[Australia]] which had federal constitutions.

Elements of constitutional law in states with uncodified constitutions can be entrenched; for example, sections of the [[Electoral Act 1993]] of New Zealand relating to the maximum term of parliament and how elections are held require a three-quarter majority in the House of Representatives or a simple majority in a referendum to be amended or repealed.

===== Written versus unwritten / codified versus uncodified =====
The term ''written constitution'' is used to describe a constitution that is entirely written, which by definition includes every codified constitution; but not all constitutions based entirely on written documents are codified.

Some constitutions are largely, but not wholly, codified. For example, in the Constitution of Australia, most of its fundamental political principles and regulations concerning the relationship between branches of government, and concerning the government and the individual are codified in a single document, the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. However, the presence of statutes with constitutional significance, namely the [[Statute of Westminster]], as adopted by the Commonwealth in the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942]], and the [[Australia Act 1986]] means that Australia's constitution is not contained in a single constitutional document.  The [[Constitution of Canada]], which evolved from the [[British North America Acts]] until severed from nominal British control by the [[Canada Act 1982]] (analogous to the Australia Act 1986), is a similar example. Canada's constitution [[List of Canadian constitutional documents|consists of almost 30 different statutes]]

The terms ''written constitution'' and ''codified constitution'' are often used interchangeably, as are ''unwritten constitution'' and ''uncodified constitution'', although this usage is technically inaccurate. Strictly speaking, ''unwritten constitution'' is never an accurate synonym for ''uncodified constitution'', because all modern democratic constitutions mainly comprise written sources, even if they have no different legal status than ordinary statutes. Another, correct, term used is ''formal'' (or ''formal written'') ''constitution'', for example in the following context: &quot;The United Kingdom has no formal [written] constitution&quot; (which does not preclude a constitution based on documents but not codified).

==== Entrenchment ====
{{Original research|section|date=December 2010}}
{{Ref improve section|date=December 2010}}
[[File:Constitution Pg1of4 AC.jpg|thumb|[[The U.S. Constitution]]]]

The presence or lack of entrenchment is a fundamental feature of constitutions. An entrenched constitution cannot be altered in any way by a legislature as part of its normal business concerning ordinary statutory laws, but can only be amended by a different and more onerous procedure. There may be a requirement for a [[Constituent assembly|special body]] to be set up, or the proportion of favourable votes of members of existing legislative bodies may be required to be higher to pass a constitutional  amendment than for [[statute]]s. The [[entrenched clause]]s of a constitution can create different degrees of entrenchment, ranging from simply excluding constitutional amendment from the normal business of a legislature, to making certain amendments either more difficult than normal modifications, or forbidden under any circumstances.

Entrenchment is an inherent feature in most codified constitutions. A codified constitution will incorporate the rules which must be followed for the constitution itself to be changed.

The US constitution is an example of an entrenched constitution, and the UK constitution is an example of a constitution that is not entrenched (or codified). In some states the text of the constitution may be changed; in others the original text is not changed, and [[Constitutional amendment|amendments]] are passed which add to and may override the original text and earlier amendments.

Procedures for constitutional amendment vary between states. In a nation with a federal system of government the approval of a majority of state or provincial legislatures may be required. Alternatively, a national referendum may be required. Details are to be found in the articles on the constitutions of the various nations and federal states in the world.

In constitutions that are not entrenched, no special procedure is required for modification. Lack of entrenchment is a characteristic of uncodified constitutions; the constitution is not recognised with any higher legal status than ordinary [[statutes]]. In the UK, for example laws which modify written or unwritten provisions of the constitution are passed on a simple majority in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. No special &quot;constitutional amendment&quot; procedure is required. The principle of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] holds that no sovereign parliament may be bound by the acts of its predecessors;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sovereignty.org.uk/features/eucon/fcosov.html UK principle: no Parliament is bound by the acts of its predecessors]&lt;/ref&gt; and there is no higher authority that can create law which binds Parliament. The [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|sovereign]] is nominally the head of state with important powers, such as the power to declare war; the [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|uncodified and unwritten constitution]] removes all these powers in practice.

In practice democratic governments do not use the lack of entrenchment of the constitution to impose the will of the government or abolish all civil rights, as they could in theory do, but the distinction between constitutional and other law is still somewhat arbitrary, usually following historical principles embodied in important past legislation. For example, several British [[Acts of Parliament]] such as the [[English Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], Human Rights Act and, prior to the creation of Parliament, Magna Carta are regarded as granting fundamental rights and principles which are treated as almost constitutional. Several rights that in another state might be guaranteed by constitution have indeed been abolished or modified by the British parliament in the early 21st century, including the unconditional right to [[trial by jury]], the [[right to silence]] without prejudicial inference, [[Habeas corpus|permissible detention before a charge is made]] extended from 24 hours to 42 days, and the [[Double jeopardy|right not to be tried twice for the same offence]].

{{further|[[Fundamental Laws of England]]}}

===== Absolutely unmodifiable articles =====
The strongest level of [[entrenched clause|entrenchment]] exists in those constitutions that state that some of their most fundamental principles are absolute, i.e. certain articles may not be amended under any circumstances. An amendment of a constitution that is made consistently with that constitution, except that it violates the absolute non-modifiability, can be called an ''unconstitutional constitutional law''. Ultimately it is always possible for a constitution to be overthrown by internal or external force, for example, a [[revolution]] (perhaps claiming to be justified by the [[right to revolution]]) or invasion.

An example of absolute unmodifiability is the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Federal Constitution]]. This states in Articles 1 and 20 that the state powers, which derive from the people, must protect human dignity on the basis of human rights, which are directly applicable law binding on all three branches of government, which is a democratic and social federal republic; that legislation must be according to the rule of law; and that the people have the right of resistance as a last resort against any attempt to abolish the constitutional order. [[Entrenched clause#Germany|Article 79, Section 3]] states that these articles cannot be changed, even according to the methods of amendment defined elsewhere in the document.

Another example is the [[Constitution of Honduras]], which has an article stating that the article itself and certain other articles cannot be changed in any circumstances. Article 374 of the Honduras Constitution asserts this unmodifiability, stating, &quot;It is not possible to reform, in any case, the preceding article, the present article, the constitutional articles referring to the form of government, to the national territory, to the presidential period, the prohibition to serve again as President of the Republic, the citizen who has performed under any title in consequence of which she/he cannot be President of the Republic in the subsequent period.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;georgetown_const_82-05_art374&quot;&gt;{{Cite document | title= Republic of Honduras: Political Constitution of 1982 through 2005 reforms; Article 374 | publisher= [[Georgetown University]] | work= Political Database of the Americas | url= http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Honduras/hond05.html Honduran Constitution | language= [[Spanish language|Spanish]] | postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; This unmodifiability article played an important role in the [[2009 Honduran constitutional crisis]].

==== Distribution of sovereignty ====
{{See also|Federalism}}

Constitutions also establish where sovereignty is located in the state. There are three basic types of distribution of sovereignty according to the degree of centralisation of power: unitary, federal, and confederal. The distinction is not absolute.

In a unitary state, sovereignty resides in the state itself, and the constitution determines this. The territory of the state may be divided into regions, but they are not sovereign and are subordinate to the state. In the UK, the constitutional doctrine of [[Parliamentary sovereignty]] dictates than sovereignty is ultimately contained at the centre. Some powers have been [[devolution|devolved]] to [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]], and [[Wales]] (but not [[England]]). Some unitary states ([[Spain]] is an example) devolve more and more power to sub-national governments until the state functions in practice much like a federal state.

A federal state has a central structure with at most a small amount of territory mainly containing the institutions of the federal government, and several regions (called ''states'', ''provinces'', etc.) which comprise the territory of the whole state. Sovereignty is divided between the centre and the constituent regions. The constitutions of Canada and the United States establish federal states, with power divided between the federal government and the provinces or states. Each of the regions may in turn have its own constitution (of unitary nature).

A confederal state comprises again several regions, but the central structure has only limited coordinating power, and sovereignty is located in the regions. Confederal constitutions are rare, and there is often dispute to whether so-called &quot;confederal&quot; states are actually federal.

To some extent a group of states which do not constitute a federation as such may by [[treaty|treaties]] and accords give up parts of their sovereignty to a [[supranational]] entity. For example the countries comprising the [[European Union]] have agreed to abide by some Union-wide measures which restrict their absolute sovereignty in some ways, e.g., the use of the [[metric system of measurement]] instead of national units previously used.

==== Separation of powers ====
{{Main|Separation of powers}}

Constitutions usually explicitly divide power between various branches of government.  The standard model, described by the [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]], involves three branches of government: [[executive branch|executive]], [[legislature|legislative]] and [[judiciary|judicial]].  Some constitutions include additional branches, such as an [[audit|auditory branch]]. Constitutions vary extensively as to the degree of separation of powers between these branches.

==== Lines of accountability ====
In [[presidential]] and [[semi-presidential]] systems of government, department secretaries/ministers are accountable to the [[president]], who has patronage powers to appoint and dismiss ministers. The president is accountable to the people in an election.

In [[parliamentary]] systems, ministers are accountable to [[Parliament]], but it is the [[prime minister]] who appoints and dismisses them. In turn the prime minister will resign if the government loses the confidence of the parliament (or a part of it). Confidence can be lost if the government loses a [[vote of no confidence]] or, depending on the country, loses a particularly important vote in parliament such as vote on the budget. When a government loses confidence it stays in office until a new government is formed; something which normally but not necessarily required the holding of a general election.

====State of emergency====
{{Main|State of emergency}}
Many constitutions allow the declaration under exceptional circumstances of some form of state of emergency during which some rights and guarantees are suspended. This deliberate [[loophole]] can be and has been abused to allow a government to suppress dissent without regard for human rights&amp;mdash;see the article on [[state of emergency]].

=== Façade constitutions ===
{{See also|Constitutionalism}}
Italian political theorist [[Giovanni Sartori]] noted the existence of national constitutions which are a façade for authoritarian sources of power. While such documents may express respect for [[human rights]] or establish an independent judiciary, they may be ignored when the government feels threatened, or never put into practice. An extreme example was the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]] that on paper supported [[freedom of assembly]] and [[freedom of speech]]; however, citizens who transgressed unwritten limits were summarily [[Political prisoner|imprisoned]]. The example demonstrates that the protections and benefits of a constitution are ultimately provided not through its written terms but through deference by government and society to its principles. A constitution may change from being real to a façade and back again as democratic and autocratic governments succeed each other.

The constitution of the United States, being the first document of its type, necessarily had many unforeseen shortcomings which had to be patched through amendments, but has generally been honored and a powerful structure, and no dictatorship has been able to take hold; the [[constitution of Argentina]] written many years later in 1853 building on many years of experience of the US constitution was arguably a better document, but did not prevent a succession of dictatorial governments from ignoring it&amp;mdash;a [[state of emergency]] was declared 52 times to bypass constitutional guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://derecho.laguia2000.com/derecho-politico/estado-de-sitio State of emergency in Argentina and other Spanish-speaking countries (in Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constitutional courts ==
{{See|Constitutional court|Constitutionality}}

Constitutions are often, but by no means always, protected by a legal body whose job it is to interpret those constitutions and, where applicable, declare void executive and legislative acts which infringe the constitution. In some countries, such as [[Germany]], this function is carried out by a dedicated constitutional court which performs this (and only this) function. In other countries, such as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the ordinary courts may perform this function in addition to their other responsibilities. While elsewhere, like in the [[United Kingdom]], the concept of declaring an act to be unconstitutional does not exist.

A constitutional violation is an action or legislative act that is judged by a [[constitutional court]] to be contrary to the constitution, that is, unconstitutional. An example of constitutional violation by the executive could be a public office holder who acts outside the powers granted to that office by a constitution. An example of constitutional violation by the legislature is an attempt to pass a law that would contradict the constitution, without first going through the proper constitutional amendment process.

Some countries, mainly those with uncodified constitutions, have no such courts at all. For example the [[United Kingdom]] has traditionally operated under the principle of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] under which the laws passed by [[United Kingdom Parliament]] could not be questioned by the courts.

'''Common law''' (also known as '''[[case law]]''' or '''[[precedent]]'''), is [[law]] developed by [[judge]]s through [[legal opinion|decisions]] of [[courts]] and similar tribunals rather than through [[statute law|legislative statutes]] or [[Executive (government)|executive branch action]]. A &quot;common law system&quot; is a [[Legal systems of the world|legal system]] that gives great precedential weight to common law,&lt;ref&gt;Washington Probate, &quot;Estate Planning &amp; Probate Glossary&quot;, ''Washington (State) Probate'', s.v. &quot;common law&quot;, [htm], 8 Dec. 2008: &lt;http://www.wa-probate.com/Intro/Estate-Probate-Glossary.htm&gt;, retrieved on 7 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; on the principle that it is unfair to treat similar facts differently on different occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Arnold-Baker, ''The Companion to British History'', s.v. &quot;English Law&quot; (London: Loncross Denholm Press, 2008), 484.&lt;/ref&gt; The body of [[precedent]] is called &quot;common law&quot; and it binds future decisions. In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, an idealized common law court looks to past [[precedent]]ial decisions of relevant courts. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is [[Binding precedent|bound]] to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (this principle is known as ''[[stare decisis]]''). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a &quot;[[Case of first impression|matter of first impression]]&quot;), judges have the authority and duty to make law by creating [[precedent]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marbury v. Madison'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=5&amp;page=137 5 U.S. 137] (1803) (&quot;It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the new decision becomes precedent, and will bind future courts.

In practice, common law systems are considerably more complicated than the idealized system described above. The decisions of a court are binding only in a particular [[jurisdiction]], and even within a given jurisdiction, some courts have more power than others. For example, in most jurisdictions, decisions by [[appellate courts]] are binding on lower courts in the same jurisdiction and on future decisions of the same appellate court, but decisions of lower courts are only non-binding persuasive authority. Interactions between common law, [[constitutional law]], [[statutory law]] and [[regulatory law]] also give rise to considerable complexity. However ''[[stare decisis]]'', the principle that similar cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that they will reach similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems.

Common law legal systems are in widespread use, particularly in [[Kingdom of England|England]] where it originated in the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/188090/English-law ; British History: Middle Ages {{cite web | title = Common Law – Henry II and the Birth of a State | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/henryii_law_01.shtml | publisher = BBC | accessdate = 2009-07-23 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in nations or regions that trace their legal heritage to England as former colonies of the [[British Empire]], including the [[United States]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/new_links/Abu_Dhabi__as_delivered.pdf |title=India, being a common law country |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ghana]], [[Cameroon]], [[Canada]], [[Law of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.uniroma1.it/idc/centro/publications/43finn.pdf |title=The Common Law in the World: the Australian Experience |publisher=W3.uniroma1.it |date= |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary connotations==
The term ''common law'' has three main connotations and several historical meanings worth mentioning:

===Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law===
[[Common_law#1._Common_law_as_opposed_to_statutory_law_and_regulatory_law |Connotation 1]] distinguishes the authority that promulgated a law. For example, most areas of law in most Anglo-American [[jurisdiction]]s include &quot;[[statute|statutory law]]&quot; enacted by a [[legislature]], &quot;[[regulations|regulatory law]]&quot; promulgated by executive branch agencies pursuant to delegation of rule-making authority from the legislature, and common law or &quot;[[case law]]&quot;, ''i.e.'', decisions issued by [[courts]] (or quasi-judicial [[tribunal]]s within agencies).&lt;ref name=&quot;garner177&quot;&gt;Garner 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;salmond32&quot;&gt;Salmond 32&lt;/ref&gt; This first connotation can be further differentiated into (a) pure common law arising from the traditional and inherent authority of courts to define what the law is, even in absence of an underlying statute, ''e.g.'', most [[criminal law]] and [[procedural law]] before the 20th century, and even today, most of [[contract law]] and the law of [[torts]], and (b) court decisions that decide the fine boundaries and distinctions in law promulgated by other bodies, such as judicial interpretations of the [[Constitution]], of statutes, and of regulations.&lt;ref name=&quot;garner178&quot;&gt;Garner 178&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common law legal systems as opposed to civil law legal systems===
[[Common_law#2._Common_law_legal_systems_as_opposed_to_civil_law_legal_systems|Connotation 2]] differentiates &quot;common law&quot; jurisdictions and legal systems from &quot;[[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]&quot; or &quot;[[Codification (law)|code]]&quot; jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;garner178&quot;/&gt; Common law systems place great weight on court decisions, which are considered &quot;law&quot; with the same force of law as statutes—for nearly a millennium, common law courts have had the authority to make law where no legislative statute exists, and statutes mean what courts interpret them to mean. By contrast, in civil law jurisdictions (the legal tradition that prevails in, or is combined with common law in, Europe and most non-Islamic, non-common law countries), courts lack authority to act where there is no statute, and judicial precedent is given less interpretive weight (which means that a judge deciding a given case has more freedom to interpret the text of a statute independently, and less predictably), and scholarly literature is given more. For example, the [[Napoleonic code]] expressly forbade French judges from pronouncing general principles of law.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;5. The judges are forbidden to pronounce, by way of general and legislative determination, on the causes submitted to them.&quot; [http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/code/book1/c_preliminary.html Code of Napoleon, Law 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a rough [[rule of thumb]], common law systems trace their history to England, while civil law systems trace their history to [[Roman law]] and the [[Napoleonic Code]].

The contrast between common law and civil law systems is elaborated in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law#Contrasts_between_common_law_and_civil_law_systems  &quot;Contrasts between common law and civil law systems&quot;] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law#Alternatives_to_common_law_systems &quot;Alternatives to common law systems&quot;], below.

===Law as opposed to equity===
This connotation differentiates &quot;common law&quot; (or just &quot;law&quot;) from &quot;[[equity (law)|equity]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;garner177&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;salmond32&quot;/&gt; Before 1873, [[England and Wales|England]] had two parallel court systems: courts of &quot;law&quot; that could only award [[Monetary damages|money damages]] and recognized only the legal owner of property, and courts of &quot;equity&quot; ([[courts of chancery]]) that could issue [[injunction|injunctive relief]] (that is, a [[court order]] to a party to do something, give something to someone, or stop doing something) and recognized [[trust (law)|trusts]] of property. This split propagated to many of the colonies, including the United States (see &quot;[[Common law#Propagation of the common law to the colonies and Commonwealth by reception statutes|Reception Statutes]]&quot;, below). For most purposes, most jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal system and most states, have merged the two courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule2.htm Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 2] (&quot;There is one form of action—the civil action.&quot;) (1938)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;friedmanxix&quot;&gt;Friedman xix&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, even before the separate courts were merged together, most courts were permitted to apply both law and equity, though under potentially different procedural law. Nonetheless, the historical distinction between &quot;law&quot; and &quot;equity&quot; remains important today when the case involves issues such as the following:
* categorizing and prioritizing [[rights to property]]—for example, the same article of property often has a &quot;[[Equitable title#Equitable versus legal title|legal title]]&quot; and an &quot;equitable title,&quot; and these two groups of ownership rights may be held by different people.
* in the United States, determining whether [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|the Seventh Amendment's]] right to a [[jury trial]] applies (a determination of a fact necessary to resolution of a &quot;common law&quot; claim)&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In Suits at common law ... the right of [[Trial by Jury|trial by jury]] shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; or whether the issue will be decided by a [[judge]] (issues of what the law is, and all issues relating to equity).
* the standard of review and degree of deference given by an appellate tribunal to the decision of the lower tribunal under review (issues of law are reviewed ''de novo'', that is, &quot;as if new&quot; from scratch by the appellate tribunal, while most issues of equity are reviewed for &quot;abuse of discretion,&quot; that is, with great deference to the tribunal below).
* the remedies available and rules of procedure to be applied.

===Historical uses===
In addition, there are several historical uses of the term that provide some background as to its meaning. The [[English Court of Common Pleas]] dealt with lawsuits in which the King had no interest, i.e. between commoners. Additionally, from at least the 11th century and continuing for several centuries after that, there were several different circuits in the royal court system, served by itinerant judges who would travel from town to town dispensing the King's justice. The term &quot;common law&quot; was used to describe the law held in common between the circuits and the different stops in each circuit. The more widely a particular law was recognized, the more weight it held, whereas purely local customs were generally subordinate to law recognized in a plurality of jurisdictions. These definitions are archaic, their relevance having dissipated with the development of the English legal system over the centuries, but they do explain the origin of the term.

==Basic principles of common law==
===Common law adjudication===
In a common law jurisdiction several stages of research and analysis are required to determine &quot;what the law is&quot; in a given situation. First, one must ascertain the facts. Then, one must locate any relevant statutes and cases. Then one must extract the principles, analogies and statements by various courts of what they consider important to determine how the next court is likely to rule on the facts of the present case. Later decisions, and decisions of higher courts or legislatures carry more weight than earlier cases and those of lower courts.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'', ''Ex parte Holt'', 19 USPQ2d 1211, 1214 (Bd. Patent App. &amp; Interf. 1991) (explaining the hierarchy of precedent binding on tribunals of the United States Patent Office)&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, one integrates all the lines drawn and reasons given, and determines what &quot;the law is&quot;. Then, one applies that law to the facts.

===The common law evolves to meet changing social needs and improved understanding===
The common law is more malleable than statutory law. First, common law courts are not absolutely bound by precedent, but can (when extraordinarily good reason is shown) reinterpret and revise the law, without legislative intervention, to adapt to new trends in political, legal and [[social philosophy]]. Second, the common law evolves through a series of [[incrementalism|gradual steps]], that gradually works out all the details, so that over a decade or more, the law can change substantially but without a sharp break, thereby reducing disruptive effects.&lt;ref&gt;The beneficial qualities of the common law's incrementalist evolution was most eloquently expressed by the future [[Lord Mansfield]], then Solicitor General Murray, in the case of ''Omychund v. Barker'', who contended that &quot;a statute very seldom can take in all cases; therefore the common law, that works itself pure by rules drawn from the fountain of justice, is for that reason superior to an [[Act of Parliament|act of parliament]].&quot; I Atk. 21, 33, 26 Eng. Rep. 15, 22-23 (Ch. 1744)&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to common law incrementalism, the legislative process is very difficult to get started, as legislatures tend to delay action until a situation is totally intolerable. For these reasons, legislative changes tend to be large, jarring and disruptive (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively, and sometimes with unintended consequences).

One example of the gradual change that typifies the common law is the gradual change in liability for negligence. For example, the traditional common law rule through most of the 19th century was that a plaintiff could not recover for a defendant's negligent production or distribution of a harmful instrumentality unless the two were in [[privity of contract]]. Thus, only the immediate purchaser could recover for a product defect, and if a part was built up out of parts from parts manufacturers, the ultimate buyer could not recover for injury caused by a defect in the part. ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright]]'', 10 M&amp;W 109, 152 Eng.Rep. 402, 1842 WL 5519 (Exchequer of pleas 1842). In ''Winterbottom'', the postal service had contracted with Wright to maintain its coaches. Winterbottom was a driver for the post. When the coach failed and injured Winterbottom, he sued Wright. The ''Winterbottom'' court recognized that there would be &quot;absurd and outrageous consequences&quot; if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved, and knew it had to draw a line somewhere, a limit on the causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury. The court looked to the contractual relationships, and held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract (&quot;privity&quot;) with the negligent party.

A first exception to this rule arose in [http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/thomas_winchester.htm ''Thomas v. Winchester''], 6 N.Y. 397 (N.Y. 1852), which held that mislabeling a poison as an innocuous herb, and then selling the mislabeled poison through a dealer who would be expected to resell it, put &quot;human life in imminent danger.&quot; ''Thomas'' used this as a reason to create an exception to the &quot;privity&quot; rule. In ''Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.'', 195 N.Y. 478, 480 (N.Y. 1909) held that a coffee urn manufacturer was liable to a person injured when the urn exploded, because the urn &quot;was of such a character inherently that, when applied to the purposes for which it was designed, it was liable to become a source of great danger to many people if not carefully and properly constructed.&quot;

Yet the privity rule survived. In ''Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson'', 221 F. 801 (2nd Cir. 1915) (decided by the federal appeals court for New York and several neighboring states), the court held that a car owner could not recover for injuries from a defective wheel, when the automobile owner had a contract only with the automobile dealer and not with the manufacturer, even though there was &quot;no question that the wheel was made of dead and ‘dozy‘ wood, quite insufficient for its purposes.&quot; The ''Cadillac'' court was willing to acknowledge that the case law supported exceptions for &quot;an article dangerous in its nature or likely to become so in the course of the ordinary usage to be contemplated by the vendor.&quot; However, held the ''Cadillac'' court, &quot;one who manufactures articles dangerous only if defectively made, or installed, e.g., tables, chairs, pictures or mirrors hung on the walls, carriages, automobiles, and so on, is not liable to third parties for injuries caused by them, except in case of willful injury or fraud,&quot;

Finally, in the famous case of [http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/macpherson_buick.htm ''MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.''], 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916), [[Benjamin Cardozo|Judge Benjamin Cardozo]] pulled a broader principle out of these predecessor cases. The facts were almost identical to ''Cadillac'' a year earlier: a wheel from a wheel manufacturer was sold to Buick, to a dealer, to MacPherson, and the wheel failed, injuring MacPherson. Judge Cardozo held:

:It may be that Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co. have extended the rule of Thomas v. Winchester. If so, this court is committed to the extension. The defendant argues that things imminently dangerous to life are poisons, explosives, deadly weapons—things whose normal function it is to injure or destroy. But whatever the rule in Thomas v. Winchester may once have been, it has no longer that restricted meaning. A scaffold (Devlin v. Smith, supra) is not inherently a destructive instrument. It becomes destructive only if imperfectly constructed. A large coffee urn (Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co., supra) may have within itself, if negligently made, the potency of danger, yet no one thinks of it as an implement whose normal function is destruction. What is true of the coffee urn is equally true of bottles of aerated water (Torgeson v. Schultz, 192 N. Y. 156). We have mentioned only cases in this court. But the rule has received a like extension in our courts of intermediate appeal. In Burke v. Ireland (26 App. Div. 487), in an opinion by CULLEN, J., it was applied to a builder who constructed a defective building; in Kahner v. Otis Elevator Co. (96 App. Div. 169) to the manufacturer of an elevator; in Davies v. Pelham Hod Elevating Co. (65 Hun, 573; affirmed in this court without opinion, 146 N. Y. 363) to a contractor who furnished a defective rope with knowledge of the purpose for which the rope was to be used. We are not required at this time either to approve or to disapprove the application of the rule that was made in these cases. It is enough that they help to characterize the trend of judicial thought.

:We hold, then, that the principle of ''Thomas v. Winchester'' is not limited to poisons, explosives, and things of like nature, to things which in their normal operation are implements of destruction. If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully. ... There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable.

Note that Cardozo's new &quot;rule&quot; exists in no prior case, but is inferrable as a synthesis of the &quot;thing of danger&quot; principle stated in them, merely extending it to &quot;foreseeable danger&quot; even if &quot;the purposes for which it was designed&quot; were not themselves &quot;a source of great danger.&quot; ''MacPherson'' takes some care to present itself as foreseeable progression, not a wild departure. Note that Judge Cardozo continues to adhere to the original principle of [[Winterbottom v. Wright|''Winterbottom'']], that &quot;absurd and outrageous consequences&quot; must be avoided, and he does so by drawing a new line in the last sentence quoted above: &quot;There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable.&quot; But while adhering to the underlying principle that ''some'' boundary is necessary, [[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.|''MacPherson'']] overruled the prior common law by rendering the formerly dominant factor in the boundary, that is, the privity formality arising out of a contractual relationship between persons, totally irrelevant. Rather, the most important factor in the boundary would be the nature of the thing sold and the foreseeable uses that downstream purchasers would make of the thing.

This illustrates two crucial principles that are often not well understood by non-lawyers. (a) The law evolves, this evolution is in the hands of judges, and judges have &quot;made law&quot; for hundreds of years. (b) The reasons given for a decision are often more important in the long run than the outcome in a particular case. This is the reason that judicial opinions are usually quite long, and give rationales and policies that can be balanced with judgment in future cases, rather than the bright-line rules usually embodied in statutes.

===Interaction of constitutional, statutory and common law===
In common law legal systems ([[Common_law#2._Common_law_legal_systems_as_opposed_to_civil_law_legal_systems|connotation 2]]), the common law ([[Common_law#1._Common_law_as_opposed_to_statutory_law_and_regulatory_law |connotation 1]]) is crucial to understanding almost all important areas of law. For example, in [[English law|England and Wales]] and in most states of the [[Law of the United States|United States]], the basic law of [[contract]]s, [[tort]]s and [[property]] do not exist in statute, but only in common law (though there may be isolated modifications enacted by statute). As another example, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1877,&lt;ref&gt;''Meister v. Moore'', 96 U.S. 76 (1877) (&quot;No doubt a statute may take away a common law right, but there is always a presumption that the legislature has no such intention unless it be plainly expressed.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; held that a [[Michigan]] statute that established rules for solemnization of marriages did not abolish pre-existing common-law marriage, because the statute did not affirmatively require statutory solemnization and was silent as to preexisting common law. In almost all areas of the law (even those where there is a statutory framework, such as contracts for the sale of goods,&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', [http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/ Uniform Commercial Code, Article 2, on Contracts for the Sales of Goods]&lt;/ref&gt; or the criminal law),&lt;ref&gt;[[Model Penal Code]] as adopted in several states, for example, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/nycodes/c82.html New York's Penal Law]&lt;/ref&gt; legislature-enacted statutes generally give only terse statements of general principle, and the fine boundaries and definitions exist only in the common law ([[Common_law#1._Common_law_as_opposed_to_statutory_law_and_regulatory_law | connotation 1]]). To find out what the precise law is that applies to a particular set of facts, one has to locate [[precedent]]ial decisions on the topic, and reason from those decisions by [[analogy]]. To consider but one example, the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] states &quot;[[United States Congress|Congress]] shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof&quot;—but interpretation (that is, determining the fine boundaries, and resolving the tension between the &quot;establishment&quot; and &quot;free exercise&quot; clauses) of each of the important terms was delegated by Article III of the Constitution to the judicial branch,&lt;ref&gt;Graham Hughes, Common Law Systems, § VII, collected in Alan B. Morrison, Fundamentals of American Law, p. 23-24, Oxford University Press (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; so that the current legal boundaries of the Constitutional text can only be determined by consulting the common law.&lt;ref&gt;To consider one example, ''Lemon v. Kurtzman'', 403 U.S. 602 (1971), resolves one part of the tension between the &quot;establishment&quot; and &quot;free exercise&quot; clauses of the First Amendment with a three part test: a government-sponsored message violates the Establishment Clause if: (1) it does not have a secular purpose; (2) its principal or primary effect advances or inhibits religion; or (3) it creates an excessive entanglement of the government with religion..&lt;/ref&gt;

In common law jurisdictions, legislatures operate under the assumption that [[statute]]s will be interpreted against the backdrop of the pre-existing common law and custom. For example, in most U.S. states, the criminal statutes are primarily codification of pre-existing common law. ([[Codification (law)|Codification]] is the process of enacting a statute that collects and restates pre-existing law in a single document—when that pre-existing law is common law, the common law remains relevant to the interpretation of these statutes.) In reliance on this assumption, modern statutes often leave a number of terms and fine distinctions unstated—for example, a statute might be very brief, leaving the precise definition of terms unstated, under the assumption that these fine distinctions will be inherited from pre-existing common law. (For this reason, many modern American law schools teach the common law of crime as it stood in England in 1789, because that centuries-old English common law is a necessary foundation to interpreting modern criminal statutes.)

With the transition from English law, which had common law crimes, to the new legal system under the [[U.S. Constitution]], which prohibited [[ex post facto law|''ex post facto'' laws]] at both the federal and state level, the question was raised whether there could be common law crimes in the United States. It was settled in the case of ''[[United States v. Hudson and Goodwin]]'', {{ussc|11|32|1812}}, which decided that federal courts had no jurisdiction to define new common law crimes, and that there must always be a (constitutional) statute defining the offense and the penalty for it.

Still, many states retain selected common law crimes. For example, in Virginia, the definition of the conduct that constitutes the crime of robbery exists only in the common law, and the robbery statute only sets the punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''Johnson v. Commonwealth'', 209 Va. 291, 293, 163 S.E.2d 570, ___ (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Code of Virginia|Virginia Code]] section 1-200 establishes the continued existence and vitality of common law principles and provides that &quot;The common law of England, insofar as it is not repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of this Commonwealth, shall continue in full force within the same, and be the rule of decision, except as altered by the General Assembly.&quot;

By contrast to statutory codification of common law, some statutes displace common law, for example to create a new [[cause of action]] that did not exist in the common law, or to legislatively overrule the common law. An example is the [[tort]] of [[wrongful death]], which allows certain persons, usually a spouse, child or [[estate (law)|estate]], to sue for damages on behalf of the deceased. There is no such tort in English common law; thus, any jurisdiction that lacks a wrongful death statute will not allow a lawsuit for the wrongful death of a loved one. Where a wrongful death statute exists, the compensation or other remedy available is limited to the remedy specified in the statute (typically, an upper limit on the amount of damages). Courts generally interpret statutes that create new causes of action narrowly – that is, limited to their precise terms—because the courts generally recognize the legislature as being supreme in deciding the reach of judge-made law unless such statute should violate some &quot;second order&quot; [[constitutional law]] provision (''cf''. [[judicial activism]]).

Where a tort is rooted in common law, all traditionally recognized damages for that tort may be sued for, whether or not there is mention of those [[damages]] in the current [[statutory law]]. For instance, a person who sustains bodily injury through the [[negligence]] of another may sue for medical costs, pain, suffering, loss of earnings or earning capacity, mental and/or emotional distress, loss of [[quality of life]], disfigurement and more. These damages need not be set forth in statute as they already exist in the tradition of common law. However, without a wrongful death statute, most of them are extinguished upon death.

In the United States, the power of the federal judiciary to review and invalidate unconstitutional acts of the federal executive branch is stated in the constitution, Article III sections 1 and 2: &quot;The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. ... The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority...&quot; The first famous statement of &quot;the judicial power&quot; was ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', {{ussc|5|137|1803|Cranch|1}}. Later cases interpreted the &quot;judicial power&quot; of Article III to establish the power of federal courts to consider or overturn any action of congress or of any state that conflicts with the constitution.

===Overruling precedent—the limits of ''stare decisis''===
Most of the U.S. federal courts of appeal have adopted a rule under which, in the event of any conflict in decisions of panels (most of the courts of appeal almost always sit in panels of three), the earlier panel decision is controlling, and a panel decision may only be overruled by the court of appeals sitting ''en banc'' (that is, all active judges of the court) or by a higher court.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''South Corp. v. United States'', 690 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1982) (''en banc'' in relevant part) (explaining order of precedent binding on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit); ''Bonner v. City of Prichard, Alabama'', 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981) (''en banc'') (after the Eleventh Circuit was split off from the Fifth Circuit, adopting precedent of Fifth Circuit as binding until overruled by the Eleventh Circuit ''en banc'': &quot;The [pre-split] Fifth followed the absolute rule that a prior decision of the circuit (panel or ''en banc'') could not be overruled by a panel but only by the court sitting ''en banc''. The Eleventh Circuit decides in this case that it chooses, and will follow, this rule.&quot;); ''Ex parte Holt'', 19 USPQ2d 1211, 1214 (Bd. Patent App. &amp; Interf. 1991) (explaining the hierarchy of precedent binding on tribunals of the United States Patent Office).&lt;/ref&gt; In these courts, the older decision remains controlling when an issue comes up the third time.

Other courts, for example, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the Supreme Court, always sit ''en banc'', and thus the ''later'' decision controls. These courts essentially overrule all previous cases in each new case, and older cases survive only to the extent they do not conflict with newer cases. The interpretations of these courts - for example, Supreme Court interpretations of the constitution or federal statutes - are stable only so long as the older interpretation maintains the support of a majority of the court. The majority may persist through some combination of belief that the old decision is right, and that it is not sufficiently wrong to be overruled.

In the UK, since 2009, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] has the authority to overrule and unify decisions of lower courts. From 1966 to 2009, this [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|power]] lay with the [[House of Lords]], granted by the Practice Statement of 1966.&lt;ref&gt;83 Cr App R 191, 73 Cr App R 266&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common law as a foundation for commercial economies===
The reliance on judicial opinion is a strength of common law systems, and is a significant contributor to the robust commercial systems in the United Kingdom and United States. Because there is common law to give reasonably precise guidance on almost every issue, parties (especially commercial parties) can predict whether a proposed course of action is likely to be lawful or unlawful. This ability to predict gives more freedom to come close to the boundaries of the law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Yeo Tiong Min, &quot;[http://www.singaporelaw.sg/content/SomeDifferences.html A Note on Some Differences in English Law, New York Law, and Singapore Law]&quot; (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many commercial contracts are more economically efficient, and create greater wealth, because the parties know ahead of time that the proposed arrangement, though perhaps close to the line, is almost certainly legal. Newspapers, taxpayer-funded entities with some religious affiliation, and political parties can obtain fairly clear guidance on the boundaries within which their [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] rights apply.

In contrast, in non-common-law countries, and jurisdictions with very weak respect for precedent (example, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]]), fine [[Question of law|questions of law]] are redetermined anew each time they arise, making consistency and prediction more difficult, and procedures far more protracted than necessary because parties cannot rely on written statements of law as reliable guides. In jurisdictions that do not have a strong allegiance to a large body of precedent, parties have less ''a priori'' guidance and must often leave a bigger &quot;safety margin&quot; of unexploited opportunities, and final determinations are reached only after far larger expenditures on legal fees by the parties.

This is the reason for the frequent choice of the law of the State of New York in commercial contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Eisenberg &amp; Geoffrey P. Miller, The Flight to New York: An Empirical Study of Choice of Law and Choice of Forum Clauses in Publicly-Held Companies’ Contracts (2008). New York University Law and Economics Working Papers. Paper 124, http://lsr.nellco.org/nyu_lewp/124 (based on a survey of 2882 contracts, &quot;New York law plays a role for major corporate contracts similar to the role Delaware law plays in the limited setting of corporate governance disputes.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial contracts almost always include a &quot;choice of law clause&quot; to reduce uncertainty. Somewhat surprisingly, contracts throughout the world (for example, contracts involving parties in Japan, France and Germany, and from most of the other states of the United States) often choose the law of New York, even where the relationship of the parties and transaction to New York is quite attenuated. Because of its history as the nation's commercial center, New York common law has a depth and predictability not (yet) available in any other jurisdiction. Similarly, corporations are often formed under Delaware [[Corporations law|corporate law]], and contracts relating to corporate law issues ([[Mergers and acquisitions|merger and acquisitions]] of companies, rights of shareholders, and so on.) include a Delaware [[choice of law]] clause, because of the deep body of law in Delaware on these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg &amp; Miller&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some other jurisdictions have sufficiently developed bodies of law so that parties have no real motivation to choose the law of a foreign jurisdiction (for example,, England and Wales, and the state of California), but not yet so fully developed that parties with no relationship to the jurisdiction choose that law{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. The common theme in each case is that commercial parties seek predictability and simplicity in their contractual relations, and frequently choose the law of a common law jurisdiction with a well-developed body of common law to achieve that result.

Likewise, for litigation of commercial disputes arising out of unpredictable torts (as opposed to the prospective choice of law clauses in contracts discussed in the previous paragraph), certain jurisdictions attract an unusually high fraction of cases, because of the predictability afforded by the depth of decided cases. For example, [[London]] is considered the pre-eminent centre for litigation of [[Admiralty law|admiralty]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-becomes-litigation-capital-of-the-world-1031231.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Richard | last=Osley | title=London becomes litigation capital of the world | date=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not to say that common law is better in every situation. For example, civil law can be clearer than case law when the legislature has had the foresight and diligence to address the precise set of facts applicable to a particular situation. For that reason, civil law statutes tend to be somewhat more detailed than statutes written by common law legislatures – but, conversely, that tends to make the statute more difficult to read (the United States tax code is an example).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Taxpayer Advocate Service, 2008 Report to Congress, http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/08_tas_arc_msp_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, as a practical matter, no civil law legislature can ever address the full spectrum of factual possibilities in the breadth, depth and detail of the case law of the common law courts of even a smaller jurisdiction, and that deeper, more complete body of law provides additional predictability that promotes commerce.

==History==

The term &quot;common law&quot; originally derives from the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], in the 1150s and 1160s.  The &quot;common law&quot; was the law that emerged as &quot;common&quot; throughout the realm (as distinct from the various legal codes that preceded it, such as [[Mercia|Mercian law]], the [[Danelaw]] and the law of [[Wessex]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/citizen_subject/law.htm Outside the law] [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]&lt;/ref&gt; as the king's judges followed each other's decisions to create a unified common law throughout England. The doctrine of precedent developed during the 12th and 13th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jeffery |first=Clarence Ray |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1957 |month= |title=The Development of Crime in Early English Society |journal=Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=647–666|quote= |doi=10.2307/1140057 |publisher=The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science, Vol. 47, No. 6 |jstor= 1140057 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the collective judicial decisions that were based in [[tradition]], [[custom (law)|custom]] and [[precedent]].&lt;ref&gt;Winston Chruchill, ''A History of the English Speaking Peoples'', Chapter 13, ''The English Common Law''&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of reasoning used in common law is known as [[casuistry]] or [[case-based reasoning]]. The common law, as applied in [[civil case]]s (as distinct from [[criminal case]]s), was devised as a means of [[damages|compensating]] someone for wrongful acts known as [[tort]]s, including both [[intentional tort]]s and torts caused by [[negligence]], and as developing the body of law recognizing and regulating [[contract]]s. The type of [[legal procedure|procedure]] practiced in common law courts is known as the [[adversarial system]]; this is also a development of the common law.

===Medieval English common law===
{{See also|English law}}

In the late 800s, [[Alfred the Great]] assembled the [[Doom book]] (not to be confused with the more-famous [[Domesday Book]] from 200 years later), which collected the existing laws of Kent, Wessex, and Mercia, and attempted to blend in the Mosaic code, Christian principles, and old Germanic customs.&lt;ref&gt;''see'' [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], ''The Common Law'', Lecture I, sec. 2, &quot;In Massachusetts today...there are some (rules) which can only be understood by reference to the infancy of procedure among the German tribes.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Norman conquest]] in 1066, justice was administered primarily by [[county courts]]&lt;sup&gt;Counties didn't exit before the Normans, they were Shires&lt;/sup&gt;, presided by the diocesan [[bishop]] and the [[sheriff]], exercising both [[ecclesiastical jurisdiction|ecclesiastical]] and civil jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=cath&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Common Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trial by jury began in these courts.&lt;ref name=cath/&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 1154, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] became the first [[Plantagenet]] king. Among many achievements, Henry institutionalized common law by creating a unified system of law &quot;common&quot; to the country through incorporating and elevating local custom to the national, ending local control and peculiarities, eliminating arbitrary remedies and reinstating a [[jury]] system – citizens sworn on oath to investigate reliable criminal accusations and civil claims. The jury reached its [[verdict]] through evaluating common [[Traditional knowledge|local knowledge]], not necessarily through the presentation of [[evidence (law)|evidence]], a distinguishing factor from today's civil and criminal court systems.

Henry II developed the practice of sending judges from his own central court to hear the various disputes throughout the country. His judges would resolve disputes on an [[ad hoc]] basis according to what they interpreted the customs to be. The king's judges would then return to London and often discuss their cases and the decisions they made with the other judges. These decisions would be recorded and filed. In time, a rule, known as ''[[stare decisis]]'' (also commonly known as precedent) developed, whereby a judge would be bound to follow the decision of an earlier judge; he was required to adopt the earlier judge's interpretation of the law and apply the same principles promulgated by that earlier judge if the two cases had similar facts to one another. Once judges began to regard each other's decisions to be binding precedent, the pre-Norman system of local customs and law varying in each locality was replaced by a system that was (at least in theory, though not always in practice) common throughout the whole country, hence the name &quot;common law.&quot;

Henry II's creation of a powerful and unified court system, which curbed somewhat the power of [[canon law|canonical]] (church) courts, brought him (and England) into conflict with the church, most famously with [[Thomas Becket]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Eventually, Becket was murdered inside [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by four knights who believed themselves to be acting on Henry's behalf. Whether Henry actually intended to bring about the assassination of Becket is debatable, but there is no question that at the time of the murder, the two men were embroiled in a bitter dispute regarding the power of Royal Courts to exercise jurisdiction over former clergymen. The murder of the Archbishop gave rise to a wave of popular outrage against the King. Henry was forced to repeal the disputed laws and to abandon his efforts to hold church members accountable for secular crimes (see also [[Constitutions of Clarendon]]).

Judge-made common law operated as the primary source of law for several hundred years, before [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] acquired legislative powers to create [[statutory law]]. It is important to understand that common law is the older and more traditional source of law, and legislative power is simply a layer applied on top of the older common law foundation. Since the 12th century, courts have had parallel and co-equal authority to make law&lt;ref&gt;William Burnham, ''Introduction to the Law and Legal System of the United States'', 4th ed. (St. Paul, Thomson West, 2006), 42.&lt;/ref&gt; -- &quot;legislating from the bench&quot; is a traditional and essential function of courts, which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the &quot;judicial power&quot; specified by Article III of the U.S. constitution,.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., ''MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.'', 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916) (discussed above, adjudicating the tort of negligence that existed in no statute, and expanding the law to cover parties that had never been addressed by statute); Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Exch 341 (defining a new rule of contract law with no basis in statute); ''Marbury v. Madison'', 137 5 U.S. 137 (1803) (&quot;It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.&quot;); Alexander Hamilton, THE FEDERALIST, Nos. 78 and 81 (J. Cooke ed. 1961), 521-530, 541-55 (&quot;The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution, is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body.&quot;); see [[rule against perpetuities]] for a judicially created law originating in 1682 that governs the validity of trusts and [[future interests]] in [[real property]], [[Rule in Shelley's Case]] for a rule created by judges in 1366 or before, and [[life estate]] and [[fee simple]] for rules of real property ownership that were judicially created in the late 1100's as the crown began to give law-making power to courts.&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] observed in 1917 that &quot;judges do and must legislate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen'', 244 U.S. 205, 221 (1917) (Holmes, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; There are legitimate debates on how the powers of courts and legislatures should be balanced. However, a view that courts lack law-making power is historically inaccurate and constitutionally unsupportable.

===Influences of foreign legal systems===
==== Roman law ====

The term &quot;common law&quot; ([[Common_law#2._Common_law_legal_systems_as_opposed_to_civil_law_legal_systems|connotation 2]]) is often used as a contrast to Roman-derived &quot;civil law&quot;, and the fundamental processes and forms of reasoning in the two are quite different. Nonetheless, there has been considerable cross-fertilization of ideas, while the two traditions and sets of foundational principles remain distinct.

By the time of the rediscovery of the [[Roman law]] in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, the common law had already developed far enough to prevent a Roman law reception as it occurred on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., R. C. van Caenegem, ''The Birth of the English Common Law'' 89-92 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first common law scholars, most notably [[Ranulf de Glanvill|Glanvill]] and [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]], as well as the early royal common law judges, had been well accustomed with Roman law. Often, they were clerics trained in the Roman canon law.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [[Peter Birks]], Grant McLeod, ''Justinian's Institutes'' 7 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first and throughout its history one of the most significant treatises of the common law, Bracton’s ''De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae'' (On the Laws and Customs of England), was heavily influenced by the division of the law in Justinian’s ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Institutes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., George E. Woodbine (ed.), Samuel E. Thorne (transl.), ''Bracton on the Laws and Customs of England'', Vol. I (Introduction) 46 (1968); Carl Güterbock, ''Bracton and his Relation to the Roman Law'' 35-38 (1866).&lt;/ref&gt; The impact Roman law had decreased sharply after the age of Bracton, but the Roman divisions of actions into ''in rem'' and ''in personam'' used by Bracton had a lasting effect and laid the groundwork for a return of Roman law structural concepts in the 18th and 19th centuries. Signs of this can be found in Blackstone’s ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'',&lt;ref&gt;Stephen P. Buhofer, ''Structuring the Law: The Common Law and the Roman Institutional System'', Swiss Review of International and European Law (SZIER/RSDIE) 5/2007, 24 (download at http://www.szier.ch - archive).&lt;/ref&gt; and Roman law ideas regained importance with the revival of academic law schools in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stein, ''Continental Influences on English Legal thought, 1600 - 1900'', ''in'' Peter Stein, ''The Character and Influence of the Roman Civil Law'' 223 ''et seq''. (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, today, the main systematic divisions of the law into property, contract, and tort (and to some extent [[unjust enrichment]]) can be found in the civil law as well as in the common law.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Stephen P. Buhofer, ''Structuring the Law: The Common Law and the Roman Institutional System'', Swiss Review of International and European Law (SZIER/RSDIE) 5/2007 (download at http://www.szier.ch - archive).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propagation of the common law to the colonies and Commonwealth by reception statutes===
====Initial reception of English common law into new colonies====

In ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (Bk I, ch.4, pp 106–108), Sir [[William Blackstone]] described the process by which English common law followed English colonization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Plantations or colonies, in distant countries, are either such where the lands are claimed by right of occupancy only, by finding them [[terra nullius|desert and uncultivated]], and peopling them from the mother-country; or where, when already cultivated, they have been either gained by [[conquest (military)|conquest]], or ceded to us by [[treaty|treaties]]. And both these rights are founded upon the law of nature, or at least upon that of nations. But there is a difference between these two species of colonies, with respect to the laws by which they are bound. For it hath been held, that if an uninhabited country be discovered and planted by English subjects, all the English laws then in being, which are the birthright of every subject, are immediately there in force... But in conquered or ceded countries, that have already laws of their own, the [[List of British monarchs|king]] may indeed alter and change those laws; but, till he does actually change them, the ancient laws of the country remain, unless such as are against the law of God, as in the case of an infidel country.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, if an 'uninhabited' or 'infidel' territory is colonized by Britain, then the English law automatically applies in this territory from the moment of colonization; however if the colonized territory has a pre-existing legal system, the native law would apply (effectively a form of [[indirect rule]]) until formally superseded by the English law, through [[Royal Prerogative]] subjected to the [[Westminster Parliament]].

====Reception statutes as a step in decolonization====

As colonies gained independence from England, most adopted [[British common law]] as the basis for their legal systems. In most cases, newly independent colonies received common law [[precedent]] as of the date independence as the default law, to the extent not explicitly rejected by the newly freed colony's founding documents or government.

For example, following the [[American Revolution]] in 1776, one of the first legislative acts undertaken by each of the newly independent states was to adopt a &quot;[[reception statute]]&quot; that gave legal effect to the existing body of English common law to the extent that American legislation or the [[Constitution]] had not explicitly rejected English law.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Lammi and James Chang, &quot;[http://www.wlf.org/upload/121704LBChang.pdf Michigan High Court Ruling Offers Positive Guidance on Challenges to Tort Reform Laws]&quot; (December 17, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Some states enacted reception statutes as legislative statutes, while other states received the English common law through provisions of the state's constitution, and some by court decision. British traditions such as the [[monarchy]] were rejected by the U.S. Constitution, but many English common law traditions such as [[habeas corpus]], [[jury trials]], and various other [[civil liberties]] were adopted in the United States. Significant elements of English common law prior to 1776 still remain in effect in many jurisdictions in the United States, because they have never been rejected by American courts or legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;''Milestones! 200 Years of American Law: Milestones in Our Legal History''

For example, the New York Constitution of 1777&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/ny01.htm New York Constitution of 1777] via Avalon Project at [[Yale]] Law School.&lt;/ref&gt; provides that:
{{quote|[S]uch parts of the common law of England, and of the statute law of England and Great Britain, and of the acts of the legislature of the colony of New York, as together did form the law of the said colony on the 19th day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, shall be and continue the law of this State, subject to such alterations and provisions as the legislature of this State shall, from time to time, make concerning the same.}}

[[Alexander Hamilton]] emphasized in [[The Federalist]] that this New York constitutional provision expressly made the common law subject &quot;to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Hamilton, [http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa84.htm Federalist 84] (1788).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even when reception was effected by a constitution, the common law was still subject to alteration by a legislature's statute.

One could note a certain irony: one of the first acts of many of the newly independent states was to adopt the law of the foreign sovereign from whom independence had just been gained. But this is one more demonstration of the point mentioned above ([[Common law#Common law as a foundation for commercial economies|Commercial economies]]), that the newly independent states recognized the importance of a predictable and established body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses, and therefore adopted the richest available source of law.

The [[Northwest Ordinance]], which was approved by the [[Congress of the Confederation]] in 1787, guaranteed &quot;judicial proceedings according to the course of the common law.&quot; [[Nathan Dane]], the primary author of the Northwest Ordinance, viewed this provision as a default mechanism in the event that federal or territorial statutes were silent about a particular matter; he wrote that if &quot;a statute makes an offence, and is silent as to the mode of trial, it shall be by jury, according to the course of the common law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Dane, 6 ''General Abridgment and Digest of American Law'' §182, art. 5, 230 (Cummings, Hilliard &amp; Co. 1823).&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the provision operated as a reception statute, giving legal authority to the established common law in the vast territories where no states had yet been established.

Over time, as new states were formed from federal territories, these territorial reception statutes became [[obsolete]] and were re-enacted as state law. For example, a reception statute enacted by legislation in the state of Washington requires that &quot;[t]he common law, so far as it is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, or of the state of Washington nor incompatible with the institutions and condition of society in this state, shall be the rule of decision in all the courts of this state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Legal Foundation v. Legal Foundation of Washington'', [http://laws.lp.findlaw.com/getcase/9th/case/9835154&amp;exact=1 271 F.3d 835] (9th Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the common law was eventually incorporated into the legal systems of every state except [[Louisiana]] (which inherited a [[civil law (system)|civil law]] system from its [[France|French]] colonizers before the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, adopting a code similar to but not directly based on the [[Napoleonic code|Napoleonic Code]] of 1804).

The pattern was repeated in many other former British colonies as they gained independence from the United Kingdom. [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Belize]], and various Caribbean and African nations have adopted English common law through reception statutes.

====Reception in Hong Kong====

For example, when Hong Kong was handed over to [[People's Republic of China|China]] in 1997, Hong Kong retained the common law through a reception statute in Chapter I, Article 8 of the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_1.html |title=Chapter I, Section 8 of Hong Kong Basic Law |publisher=Basiclaw.gov.hk |date=2008-03-17 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The laws previously in force in Hong Kong, that is, the common law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation and customary law shall be maintained, except for any that contravene this Law, and subject to any amendment by the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.}}

===Decline of Latin maxims, and adding flexibility to ''stare decisis''===
Well into the 19th century, ancient maxims played a large role in common law adjudication. Many of these maxims had originated in Roman Law, migrated to England before the introduction of Christianity to the British Isles&lt;sup&gt;[needs a citation]&lt;/sup&gt;, and were typically stated in Latin even in English decisions. Many examples are familiar in everyday speech even today, &quot;One cannot be a judge in one's own cause&quot; (see [[Dr. Bonham's Case]]), rights are reciprocal to obligations, and the like. Judicial decisions and treatises of the 17th and 18th centuries, such at those of Lord Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]], presented the common law as a collection of such maxims. See also [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s letter to Thomas Cooper.

Reliance on old maxims and rigid adherence to precedent, no matter how old or ill-considered, was under full attack by the late 19th century. [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] in his famous article, &quot;The Path of the Law&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=10 |journal=Harvard Law Review |pages=457, 469 |year=1897|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2373|title=The Path of the Law|first=Oliver Wendell |last=Holmes, Jr.|doi=10.2307/1322028|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; commented, &quot;It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past.&quot; Justice Holmes noted that study of maxims might be sufficient for &quot;the man of the present,&quot; but &quot;the man of the future is the man of statistics and the master of economics.&quot; In an 1880 lecture at Harvard, he noted &quot;The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow men, have had a good deal more to do than the [[syllogism]] in determining the rules by which men should be governed. The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the [[axiom]]s and corollaries of a book of mathematics.&quot;

In the early 20th century, [[Louis Brandeis]], later appointed to the United States Supreme Court, became noted for his use of policy-driving facts and economics in his [[Brandeis Brief|briefs]], and extensive appendices presenting facts that lead a judge to the advocate's conclusion. By this time, briefs relied more on facts than on Latin maxims.

Reliance on old maxims is now deprecated.&lt;ref&gt;''Acree v. Republic of Iraq'', 370 F.3d 41 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (Roberts, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; Common law decisions today reflect both precedent and policy judgment drawn from economics, the social sciences, business, decisions of foreign courts, and the like. The degree to which these external factors ''should'' influence adjudication is the subject of active debate, but that judges ''do'' draw of learning from other fields and jurisdictions is a fact of modern legal life.

===1870 through 20th century, and the procedural merger of law and equity===
&lt;!-- &quot;Fusion of law and equity&quot; redirects here. Please edit redirect if changing the name of this section header --&gt;
As early as the 15th century, it became the practice that litigants who felt they had been cheated by the common-law system would petition the [[Monarch|King]] in person. For example, they might argue that an award of damages (at common law) was not sufficient redress for a trespasser occupying their land, and instead request that the trespasser be evicted. From this developed the system of [[Equity (law)|equity]], administered by the [[Lord Chancellor]], in the courts of [[Court of equity|chancery]]. By their nature, equity and law were frequently in conflict and litigation would frequently continue for years as one court countermanded the other,&lt;ref&gt;Salmond 34&lt;/ref&gt; even though it was established by the 17th century that equity should prevail. A famous example is the fictional case of [[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]] in ''[[Bleak House]]'', by [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref name=lobban&gt;{{cite web | author=Lobban, M. | title=Preparing for Fusion: Reforming the Nineteenth-Century Court of Chancery, Part II | year=2004 | work=Law and History Review | url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/22.3/forum_lobban.html#FOOT142 | publisher=[[University of Illinois]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, courts of law and equity were combined by the [[Judicature Acts]] of 1873 and 1875, with equity being supreme in case of conflict.&lt;ref name=lobban/&gt;

In the [[United States]], parallel systems of law (providing money [[damages]], with cases heard by a jury upon either party's request) and equity (fashioning a remedy to fit the situation, including injunctive relief, heard by a judge) survived well into the 20th century. The [[United States federal courts]] procedurally separated law and equity: the same judges could hear either kind of case, but a given case could only pursue causes in law or in equity, and the two kinds of cases proceeded under different procedural rules. This became problematic when a given case required both money damages and injunctive relief. In 1937, the new [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] combined law and equity into one form of action, the &quot;civil action.&quot; Fed.R.Civ.P. 2. The distinction survives to the extent that issues that were &quot;common law&quot; as of 1791 (the date of adoption of the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]]) are still subject to the right of either party to request a jury, and &quot;equity&quot; issues are decided by a judge.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.'', 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996) (&quot;[W]e [the U.S. Supreme Court] have understood that the right of trial by jury thus preserved is the right which existed under the English common law when the Amendment was adopted. In keeping with our longstanding adherence to this 'historical test,' we ask, first, whether we are dealing with a cause of action that either was tried at law at the time of the founding or is at least analogous to one that was. If the action in question belongs in the law category, we then ask whether the particular trial decision must fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance of the common-law right as it existed in 1791.&quot; citations and quotations omitted, holding that interpretation of the scope of a patent had no analogy in 1790, and is thus a question to be decided by a judge, not a jury)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alabama]], [[Delaware]], [[Mississippi]], [[New Jersey]], [[Tennessee]] still have separate courts of law and equity, for example, the [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]]. In many [[U.S. states|states]] there are separate divisions for law and equity within one court.

===Common law pleading and its abolition in the early 20th century===
For centuries, through the 19th century, the common law recognized only specific causes of action, and required very careful drafting of the opening pleading to slot into one of them: Debt, Detinue, Covenant, Special Assumpsit, General Assumpsit, Trespass, Trover, Replevin, Case (or Trespass on the Case), and Ejectment.&lt;ref&gt;John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common Law Pleading (1894).&lt;/ref&gt; To initiate a law suit, a pleading had to be drafted to meet myriad technical requirements: correctly categorizing the case into the correct legal pigeonhole (pleading in the alternative was not permitted), and using specific &quot;magic words&quot; encrusted over the centuries. Under the old common law pleading standards, a suit by a ''pro se'' (&quot;for oneself,&quot; without a lawyer) party was all but impossible, and there was often considerable procedural jousting at the outset of a case over minor wording issues.

One of the major reforms of the late 19th century and early 20th century was the abolition of common law pleading requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Note that the remainder of the &quot;common law&quot; discussed in the rest of the article remained intact; all that was abolished were the highly technical requirements for language of the paper provided by the plaintiff to the defendant to initiate a case.&lt;/ref&gt; A plaintiff can initiate a case by giving the defendant &quot;a short and plain statement&quot; of facts that constitute an alleged wrong. This reform moved the attention of courts from technical scrutiny of words to a more rational consideration of the actual facts, and opened access to justice far more broadly.

==Contrasts between common law and civil law systems==
===Adversarial system vs. inquisitorial system===
Common law courts tend to use an [[adversarial system]], in which two sides present their cases to a neutral judge. In contrast, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, [[inquisitorial system]] proceedings, where an examining magistrate serves two roles by developing the evidence and arguments for one and the other side during the investigation phase.

The examining magistrate then presents the dossier detailing his or her findings to the president of the bench that will adjudicate on the case where it has been decided that a trial shall be conducted. Therefore the president of the bench's view of the case is not neutral and may be biased while conducting the trial after the reading of the dossier. Unlike the common law proceedings, the president of the bench in the inquisitorial system is not merely an umpire and is entitled to directly interview the witnesses or express comments during the trial, as long as he or she does not express his or her view on the guilt of the accused.

The proceeding in the inquisitorial system is essentially by writing. Most of the witnesses would have given evidence in the investigation phase and such evidence will be contained in the dossier under the form of police reports. In the same way, the accused would have already put his or her case at the investigation phase but he or she will be free to change his evidence at trial. Whether the accused pleads guilty or not, a trial will be conducted. Unlike the adversarial system, the conviction and sentence to served (if any) will be released by the trial jury together with the president of the trial bench, following their common deliberation.

There are many exceptions in both directions. For example, most proceedings before U.S. federal and state agencies are inquisitorial in nature, at least the initial stages (''e.g.'', a patent examiner, a social security hearing officer, and so on.) even though the law to be applied is developed through common law processes.

===Contrasting role of treatises and academic writings in common law and civil law systems===
The role of the legal academy presents a significant &quot;cultural&quot; difference between common law ([[Common_law#2._Common_law_legal_systems_as_opposed_to_civil_law_legal_systems|connotation 2]]) and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions.

In common law jurisdictions, legal treatises compile common law decisions, and state overarching principles that (in the author's opinion) explain the results of the cases. However, in common law jurisdictions, treatises are not the law, and lawyers and judges tend to use these treatises as only &quot;finding aids&quot; to locate the relevant cases. In common law jurisdictions, scholarly work is seldom cited as authority for what the law is.&lt;ref&gt;At least in the U.S., practicing lawyers tend to use &quot;law professor&quot; or &quot;law review article&quot; as a pejorative to describe a person or work that is insufficiently grounded in reality or practicality - every young lawyer is admonished repeatedly by senior lawyers not to write &quot;law review articles,&quot; but instead to focus on the facts of the case and the practical effects of a given outcome.&lt;/ref&gt; When common law courts rely on scholarly work, it is almost always only for factual findings, policy justification, or the [[Legal history|history and evolution of the law]], but the court's legal conclusion is reached through analysis of relevant statutes and common law, seldom scholarly commentary.

In contrast, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, the writings of [[law school|law professors]] are given significant weight by courts. In part, this is because civil law decisions traditionally were very brief, sometimes no more than a paragraph stating who wins and who loses. The rationale has to come from somewhere else, and the academy often filled that role. As civil law court decisions move in the direction of common law reasoning, it is possible that this balance may shift.

]]
The common law constitutes the basis of the legal systems of: [[English law|England and Wales]], [[Northern Ireland law|Northern Ireland]], [[Law of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], federal law in the [[U.S. law|United States]] and the law of individual [[U.S. state]]s (except [[Louisiana law|Louisiana]]), federal law throughout [[Canadian law|Canada]] and the law of the individual [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] (except [[Law of Quebec|Quebec]]), [[Law of Australia|Australia]] (both federal and individual states), [[Law of Kenya|Kenya]], [[Law of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Law of India|India]], [[Law of Malaysia|Malaysia]], [[Law of Bangladesh|Bangladesh]], [[Law of Brunei|Brunei]], [[Law of Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Law of Singapore|Singapore]], [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], and many other generally [[English-speaking countries]] or [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries (except [[Scots Law|Scotland]], which is [[bijuridicial law|bijuridicial]], and [[Malta]]). Essentially, every country that was colonised at some time by England, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], or the [[United Kingdom]] uses common law except those that were formerly colonised by other nations, such as [[Law of Quebec|Quebec]] (which follows the [[bijuridicial law|law]] of France in part), [[South Africa]] and [[Law of Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] (which follow [[Roman Dutch law]]), where the prior civil law system was retained to respect the [[civil rights]] of the local colonists. [[India]] uses common law except in the state of [[Goa]] which retains the Portuguese [[civil code]].

===Scotland (1707)===
[[Scotland]] is often said to use the civil law system but it has [[Scots law|a unique system]] that combines elements of an uncodified civil law dating back to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] with an element of common law long predating the [[Act of Union (1707)|Treaty of Union]] with England in 1707 (see [[Legal institutions of Scotland in the High Middle Ages]]). Scots common law differs in that the use of ''precedents'' is subject to the courts' seeking to discover the principle that justifies a law rather than searching for an example as a ''precedent'', and principles of [[natural justice]] and fairness have always played a role in Scots Law. Comparable [[Legal systems of the world#Pluralistic systems|pluralistic (or 'mixed') legal systems]] operate in [[Quebec]], [[Louisiana]] and [[South Africa]].

===States of the United States (1775 on)===
The state of [[New York]], which also has a civil law history from its [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch colonial]] days, also began a [[Codification (law)|codification]] of its law in the 19th century. The only part of this codification process that was considered complete is known as the [[Field Code]] applying to [[civil procedure]]. The original colony of [[New Netherlands]] was settled by the Dutch and the law was also Dutch. When the [[Kingdom of England|English]] captured pre-existing colonies they continued to allow the local settlers to keep their civil law. However, the Dutch settlers revolted against the English and the colony was [[Second Anglo-Dutch War|recaptured]] by the Dutch. When the English finally regained control of New Netherland they forced, as a punishment unique in the history of the British Empire, the English common law upon all the colonists, including the Dutch. This was problematic, as the [[patroon]] system of land holding, based on the [[Feudalism|feudal system]] and civil law, continued to operate in the colony until it was abolished in the mid-19th century. The influence of [[Roman Dutch law]] continued in the colony well into the late 19th century. The codification of a law of general obligations shows how remnants of the civil law tradition in [[New York]] continued on from the Dutch days.

The [[U.S. state]] of [[California]] has a system based on common law, but it has [[Codification (law)|codified]] the law in the manner of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. The reason for the enactment of the codes in California in the 19th century was to replace a pre-existing system based on [[Spain|Spanish]] civil law with a system based on common law, similar to that in most other states. California and a number of other [[Western United States|Western states]], however, have retained the concept of [[community property]] derived from civil law. The California courts have treated portions of the codes as an extension of the common-law tradition, subject to judicial development in the same manner as judge-made common law. (Most notably, in the case ''[[Li v. Yellow Cab Co.]]'', 13 Cal.3d 804 (1975), the [[California Supreme Court]] adopted the principle of [[comparative negligence]] in the face of a [[California Civil Code]] provision codifying the traditional common-law doctrine of [[contributory negligence]].)

Instead of common law, the [[U.S. state]] of [[Louisiana]] uniquely uses a system based on the [[Napoleonic code]], remaining true to the state's French and Spanish roots, which predate the U.S. annexation of the Louisiana territory in 1803. Historically notable among the code's differences from the more typically implemented system of common law is the role of property rights among women, particularly in inheritance gained by widows.

===United States federal system (1789 and 1938)===

The [[United States]] federal government (as opposed to the states) has a variant on a common law system. [[United States federal courts]] only act as interpreters of statutes and the constitution by elaborating and precisely defining the broad language ([[Common_law#1._Common_law_as_opposed_to_statutory_law_and_regulatory_law|connotation 1(b)]] above), but, unlike state courts, do not act as an independent source of common law ([[Common_law#1._Common_law_as_opposed_to_statutory_law_and_regulatory_law|connotation 1(a)]] above).

Before 1938, the federal courts, like almost all other common law courts, decided the law on any issue where the relevant legislature (either the U.S. Congress or state legislature, depending on the issue), had not acted, by looking to courts in the same system, that is, other federal courts, even on issues of state law, and even where there was no express grant of authority from Congress or the Constitution.

In 1938, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins]]'' [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=304&amp;page=64 304 U.S. 64, 78] (1938), overruled earlier precedent,&lt;ref&gt;''Swift v. Tyson'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=41&amp;page=1 41 U.S. 1] (1842). In ''Swift'', the [[United States Supreme Court]] had held that federal courts hearing cases brought under their [[diversity jurisdiction]] (allowing them to hear cases between parties from different states) had to apply the statutory law of the states, but not the common law developed by state courts. Instead, the Supreme Court permitted the federal courts to make their own common law based on general principles of law. ''Erie v. Tompkins'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=304&amp;page=64 304 U.S. 64] (1938). ''Erie'' over-ruled ''Swift v. Tyson'', and instead held that federal courts exercising diversity jurisdiction had to use all of the same [[substantive law]] as the courts of the states in which they were located. As the ''Erie'' Court put it, there is no &quot;general federal common law&quot;, the key word here being '''''general'''''. This history is elaborated in
[[federal common law]].&lt;/ref&gt; and held &quot;There is no federal general common law,&quot; thus confining the federal courts to act only as interpreters of law originating elsewhere. ''E.g.'', ''Texas Industries v. Radcliff'', {{ussc|451|630|1981}} (without an express grant of statutory authority, federal courts cannot create rules of intuitive justice, for example, a right to contribution from co-conspirators). Post-1938, federal courts deciding issues that arise under state law are required to defer to state court interpretations of state statutes, or reason what a state's highest court would rule if presented with the issue, or to certify the question to the state's highest court for resolution.

Later courts have limited ''Erie'' slightly, to create a few situations where [[United States federal courts]] are permitted to create [[federal common law]] rules without express statutory authority, for example, where a federal rule of decision is necessary to protect uniquely federal interests. ''See, e.g.'', ''[[Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States]]'', {{ussc|318|363|1943}} (giving federal courts the authority to fashion common law rules with respect to issues of federal power, in this case [[negotiable instrument]]s backed by the federal government); ''see also'' ''[[International News Service v. Associated Press]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=248&amp;page=215 248 U.S. 215] (1918) (creating a cause of action for misappropriation of &quot;hot news&quot; that lacks any statutory grounding, but that is one of the handful of federal common law actions that survives today); ''National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc.'', 105 F.3d 841, 843-44, 853 (2d Cir. 1997) (noting continued vitality of INS &quot;hot news&quot; tort under New York state law, but leaving open the question of whether it survives under federal law). Except on Constitutional issues, Congress is free to legislatively overrule federal courts' common law.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Boerne v. Flores'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=521&amp;invol=507 521 U.S. 507] (1997) (invalidating the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]], in which Congress had attempted to redefine the court's jurisdiction to decide constitutional issues); ''Milwaukee v. Illinois'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=451&amp;invol=304 451 U.S. 304] (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

===India (1857)===
[[Image:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Constitution of India]] is the longest written constitution for a country, containing 395 articles, 12 schedules, numerous amendments and 117,369 words.]]
Indian Law is largely based on [[English law|English]] common law because of the long period of [[British Empire|British colonial influence]] during the period of the [[British India|British Raj]].

After the failed [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion]] against the British in 1857, the [[British Parliament]] took over the reign of India from the [[British East India Company]], and [[British India]] came under the direct rule of [[the Crown]]. The British Parliament passed the [[Government of India Act 1858|Government of India Act of 1858]] to this effect, which set up the structure of British government in India. It established in [[England]] the office of the [[Secretary of State for India]] through whom the Parliament would exercise its rule, along with a [[Council of India]] to aid him. It also established the office of the [[Governor-General of India]] along with an Executive Council in India, which consisted of high officials of the British Government.

Much of contemporary Indian law shows substantial European and American influence. Various legislations first introduced by the British are still in effect in their modified forms today. During the drafting of the [[Indian Constitution]], laws from [[Ireland]], the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and [[France]] were all synthesized to get a refined set of Indian laws, as it currently stands. Indian laws also adhere to the [[United Nations]] guidelines on [[human rights law]] and the [[environmental law]]. Certain [[international trade law]]s, such as those on [[intellectual property]], are also enforced in India.

Indian [[family law]] is complex, with each religion adhering to its own specific laws. In most states, registering marriages and divorces is not compulsory. There are separate laws governing [[Hindu]]s, [[Muslim]]s, [[Christian]]s, [[Sikh]]s and followers of other religions. The exception to this rule is in the state of [[Goa]], where a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[uniform civil code]] is in place, in which all religions have a common law regarding marriages, divorces and adoption.

[[History of India|Ancient India]] represented a distinct tradition of [[law]], and had an historically independent school of legal theory and practice. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', dating from 400 BCE and the ''[[Manusmriti]]'', from 100 CE, were influential treatises in India, texts that were considered authoritative legal guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]'s central philosophy was tolerance and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], and was cited across [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in this period, which finally culminated in the creation of the Gupta Empire, relations with ancient Greece and Rome were not infrequent. The appearance of similar fundamental institutions of international law in various parts of the world show that they are inherent in international society, irrespective of culture and tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Alexander |first=C.H. |year=1952 |month=July |title=International Law in India |journal=The International and Comparative Law Quarterly |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=289–300 |issn=00205893}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inter-State relations in the pre-Islamic period resulted in clear-cut rules of warfare of a high humanitarian standard, in rules of neutrality, of treaty law, of customary law embodied in religious charters, in exchange of embassies of a temporary or semi-permanent character.&lt;ref&gt;Viswanatha, S.T., ''International Law in Ancient India'', 1925&lt;/ref&gt; When India became part of the [[British Empire]], there was a break in tradition, and Hindu and Islamic law were supplanted by the common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the present judicial system of the country derives largely from the British system and has little correlation to the institutions of the pre-British era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jain|2006|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 1160 laws as on September 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonlii.org/in/legis/num_act/ |title=Indian Legislation |publisher=Commonlii.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada (1867)===
All but one of the provinces of [[Law of Canada|Canada]] use a common law system (the exception being [[Law of Quebec|Quebec]], which uses a civil law system for issues arising within provincial jurisdiction). Criminal law, which is uniform throughout Canada, is based on the common law as interpreted by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. The mid-tier [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] is a single court that sits and hears cases in multiple cities, and thus mid-tier decisions have precedential value throughout Canada (that is, unlike the United States, Canada is not divided into appellate circuits).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fca-caf.gc.ca/index_e.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian federal statutes, when they refer to matters that are within provincial jurisdiction, such as property ownership, must use the terminology of both the common law and civil law for those matters; this is referred to as legislative bijuralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canada.justice.gc.ca/eng/bijurilex/index.html |title=Canadian Legislative Bijuralism Site At the Crossroads of our Legal Diversity |publisher=Canada.justice.gc.ca |date=2009-08-05 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nicaragua===
Nicaragua's legal system also is a mixture of the English Common Law and the Civil Law through the influence of British administration of the Eastern half of the country from the mid-17th century until about 1905, the [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] period from about 1855 through 1857, USA interventions/occupations during the period from 1909 to 1933, the influence of USA institutions during the [[Somoza family]] administrations (1933 through 1979) and the considerable importation between 1979 and the present of USA culture and institutions.

===Israel (1948)===
[[Law of Israel|Israel]] has a mixed system of common law and civil law. While [[Israeli law]] is undergoing codification, its basic principles are inherited from the law of the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] and thus resemble those of British and American law, namely: the role of courts in creating the body of law and the authority of the [[Supreme Court of Israel|supreme court]] in [[judicial review|reviewing]] and if necessary overturning legislative and executive decisions, as well as employing the adversarial system. One of the primary reasons that the [[Constitution of Israel|Israeli constitution]] remains [[unwritten constitution|unwritten]] is the fear by whatever party holds power that creating a written constitution, combined with the common-law elements, would severely limit the powers of the [[Knesset]] (which, following the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], holds near-unlimited power).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mahler|first= Gregory S.|authorlink=Gregory Mahler |title= Politics and Government in Israel: The Maturation of a Modern State|year=2004 |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0-7425-611-3 |page= 126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternatives to common law systems===
The main alternative to the common law system is the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, which is used in [[Continental Europe]], and most of the rest of the world. The contrast between civil law and common law legal systems has become increasingly blurred, with the growing importance of [[jurisprudence]] (almost like [[case law]] but in name) in civil law countries, and the growing importance of statute law and codes in common law countries.

Examples of common law being replaced by statute or codified rule in the United States include criminal law (since 1812, U.S. courts have held that criminal law must be embodied in statute if the public is to have fair notice), [[commercial law]] (the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] in the early 1960s) and procedure (the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in the 1930s and the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] in the 1970s). But note that in each case, the statute sets the general principles, but the common law process determines the scope and application of the statute.

An example of convergence from the other direction is shown in [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61981J0283:EN:NOT Srl CILFIT and Lanificio di Gavardo SpA v Ministry of Health (Corte suprema di Cassazione, Italy, 1982)], in which Italy's Supreme Court held that questions it has already answered need not be resubmitted. This brought in a distinctly common law principle into an essentially civil law jurisdiction. As the Italian courts continue to follow this precedent and assume that the Supreme Court's rulings have precedential value.{{Clarify|post-text=sentence fragment|date=August 2010}}

The former [[Soviet Bloc]] and other Socialist countries used a [[Socialist law]] system.

==Scholarly works==
[[File:WilliamBlackstone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sir William Blackstone]] as illustrated in his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''.]]
Lord Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]], a 17th-century [[England|English]] [[jurist]] and [[Member of Parliament]], wrote several legal texts that formed the basis for the modern common law, with lawyers in both England and America learning their law from his [[Institutes of the Lawes of England|''Institutes'']] and ''Reports'' until the end of the 18th century. His works are still cited by common law courts around the world.

The next definitive historical treatise on the common law is ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', written by Sir [[William Blackstone]] and first published in 1765 - 1769. Since 1979, a facsimile edition of that first edition has been available in four paper-bound volumes. Today it has been superseded in the English part of the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Halsbury's Laws of England]] that covers both common and statutory English law.

While he was still on the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]], and before being named to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] published a short volume called ''[[The Common Law]]'', which remains a classic in the field. Unlike Blackstone and the Restatements, Holmes' book only briefly discusses what the law ''is''; rather, Holmes describes the common law ''process''. Law professor [[John Chipman Gray]]'s ''The Nature and Sources of the Law'', an examination and survey of the common law, is also still commonly read in [[Law school in the United States|U.S. law schools]].

In the United States, [[Restatement of the Law|Restatements]] of various subject matter areas (Contracts, Torts, Judgments, and so on.), edited by the [[American Law Institute]], collect the common law for the area. The ALI Restatements are often cited by American courts and lawyers for propositions of uncodified common law, and are considered highly persuasive authority, just below binding precedential decisions. The [[Corpus Juris Secundum]] is an encyclopedia whose main content is a compendium of the common law and its variations throughout the various state jurisdictions.

Scots ''common law'' covers matters including murder and theft, and has sources in custom, in legal writings and previous court decisions. The legal writings used are called ''Institutional Texts'' and come mostly from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Examples include Craig, ''Jus Feudale'' (1655) and Stair, ''The Institutions of the Law of Scotland'' (1681).

In [[evolutionary biology]], a group of [[organism]]s have '''common descent''' if they have a common [[ancestor]]. &quot;There is strong quantitative support, by a formal test&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theobald&quot; /&gt; for the theory that all living organisms on [[Earth]] are descended from a [[Last universal ancestor|common ancestor]].&lt;ref name = &quot;steel&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steel | first1 = Mike | last2 = Penny | first2 = David | title = Origins of life: Common ancestry put to the test | journal = Nature | volume = 465 | issue = 7295 | pages = 168–9 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20463725 | doi = 10.1038/465168a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]] proposed the theory of universal common descent through an [[evolution]]ary process in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', saying, &quot;There is a grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;origin&quot;&gt;Darwin, C., &quot;The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle For Life&quot;, London, John Murrary, (1859) p. 490&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|History of evolutionary thought}}

In the 1740s, [[Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis]] made the first known suggestion in a series of essays that all organisms may have had a common ancestor, and that they had diverged through random variation and [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bromley&quot;&gt;J. S. Bromley, [http://books.google.com/books?id=OOgzAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=Maupertuis+%22for+the+first+time%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Maupertuis%20%22for%20the%20first%20time%22&amp;f=false The new Cambridge modern history: The rise of Great Britain and Russia, 1688-1715/25], CUP Archive, 1970, ISBN 978-0-521-07524-4, pgs. 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Russell Richards Treasure, [http://books.google.com/books?id=C94OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=%22blind+destiny+has+produced%22&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=%22blind%20destiny%20has%20produced%22&amp;f=false The making of modern Europe, 1648-1780], Taylor &amp; Francis, 1985, ISBN 978-0-416-72370-0, pg. 142&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Essai de Cosmologie'', Maupertuis noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Could one not say that, in the fortuitous combinations of the productions of nature, as there must be some characterized by a certain relation of fitness which are able to subsist, it is not to be wondered at that this fitness is present in all the species that are currently in existence? Chance, one would say, produced an innumerable multitude of individuals; a small number found themselves constructed in such a manner that the parts of the animal were able to satisfy its needs; in another infinitely greater number, there was neither fitness nor order: all of these latter have perished. Animals lacking a mouth could not live; others lacking reproductive organs could not perpetuate themselves ... The species we see today are but the smallest part of what blind destiny has produced ...&lt;ref&gt;C. Leon Harris, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Fkqg3TIkBJwC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=Essai+de+Cosmologie+%22blind+destiny%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Essai%20de%20Cosmologie%20%22blind%20destiny%22&amp;f=false Evolution, genesis and revelations, with readings from Empedocles to Wilson], SUNY Press, 1981, ISBN 978-0-87395-487-7, pg. 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1790, [[Immanuel Kant]] wrote in ''Kritik der Urtheilskraft'' (''[[Critique of Judgement]]'') that the analogy of animal forms implies a common original type, and thus a common parent.&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant and Werner S. Pluhar, [http://books.google.com/books?id=y5wQD-ioaUUC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=Critique+of+Judgment+%22original+mother%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Critique of Judgment''], Hackett Publishing, 1987, ISBN 978-0-87220-025-8, p. 304: &quot;Despite all the variety among these forms, they seem to have been produced according to a common archetype, and this analogy among them reinforces our suspicion that they are actually akin, produced by a common original mother.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1795, Charles Darwin's grandfather, [[Erasmus Darwin]], asked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]ould it be too bold to imagine, that in the great length of time, since the earth began to exist, perhaps millions of ages before the commencement of the history of mankind, would it be too bold to imagine, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which {{Smallcaps|the great First Cause}} endued with animality, with the power of acquiring new parts attended with new propensities, directed by irritations, sensations, volitions, and associations; and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down those improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In 1859, Charles Darwin's ''The Origin of Species'' was published. The views about common descent expressed therein were that it was possible that there was only one progenitor for all life forms.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed.&quot; &lt;ref name = &quot;origin&quot;/&gt; (p 484)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Darwin's famous closing sentence describes the &quot;grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;origin&quot;/&gt; (p 490)

==Evidence of universal common descent==
{{Main|Evidence of common descent}}

===Common biochemistry and genetic code===
All known forms of life are based on the same fundamental biochemical organisation: genetic information encoded in [[DNA]], transcribed into RNA, through the effect of protein- and RNA-[[enzyme]]s, then translated into [[protein]]s by (highly similar) ribosomes, with ATP, NADH and others as energy sources, etc. Furthermore, the [[genetic code]] (the &quot;translation table&quot; according to which DNA information is translated into proteins) is nearly identical for all known lifeforms, from [[bacteria]] to [[human]]s. The universality of this code is generally regarded by biologists as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent. Analysis of the small differences in the genetic code has also provided support for universal common descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Knight, Robin, et al. | year=2001 | month=January | title=Rewiring the Keyboard: Evolvability of the Genetic Code | journal=Nature Reviews Genetics | pages=49–58 | volume=2 | issue=1 | pmid=11253070 | doi=10.1038/35047500}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statistical comparison of various alternative hypotheses has shown that universal common ancestry is significantly more probable than models involving multiple origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;theobald&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Theobald, Douglas L. | name=A formal test of the theory of universal common ancestry | date=13 May 2010 | journal=Nature | volume=465 | pages=219–222 | doi=10.1038/nature09014 | issue=7295 | pmid=20463738 | title=A formal test of the theory of universal common ancestry.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Selectively neutral similarities====
Similarities which have no adaptive relevance cannot be explained by convergent evolution, and therefore they provide compelling support for the theory of universal common descent.

Such evidence has come from two areas: amino acid sequences and DNA sequences. Proteins with the same three-dimensional structure need not have identical [[amino acid]] sequences; any irrelevant similarity between the sequences is evidence for common descent. In certain cases, there are several [[codon]]s (DNA triplets) that code for the same amino acid. Thus, if two species use the same codon at the same place to specify an amino acid that can be represented by more than one codon, that is evidence for a recent common ancestor.

====Other similarities====
The universality of many aspects of cellular life is often pointed to as supportive evidence to the more compelling evidence listed above. These similarities include the energy carrier [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), and the fact that all amino acids found in proteins are left-handed. It is possible that these similarities resulted because of the laws of physics and chemistry, rather than universal common descent and therefore resulted in [[convergent evolution]].

===Phylogenetic trees===
{{PhylomapB|caption=A phylogenetic tree based on rRNA genes.}}
{{See also|Tree of life (science)}}
Another important piece of evidence is that it is possible to construct detailed [[phylogenetic tree]]s (that is, &quot;genealogic trees&quot; of species) mapping out the proposed divisions and common ancestors of all living species. In 2010 an analysis of available genetic data, mapping them to phylogenetic trees, gave &quot;firm quantitative support for the unity of life. ...there is now strong quantitative support, by a formal test,&lt;ref name=&quot;theobald&quot; /&gt; for the unity of life.&lt;ref name = &quot;steel&quot; /&gt;

Traditionally, these trees have been built using morphological methods, such as appearance, [[embryology]], etc. Recently, it has been possible to construct these trees using molecular data, based on similarities and differences between genetic and protein sequences. All these methods produce essentially similar results, even though most [[genetic variation]] has no influence over external morphology. That phylogenetic trees based on different types of information agree wit h each other is strong evidence of a real underlying common descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Artificial selection===
[[Artificial selection]] demonstrates the diversity that can exist among organisms that share a relatively recent common ancestor. In artificial selection, one species is bred selectively at each generation, allowing only those organisms that exhibit desired characteristics to reproduce. These characteristics become increasingly well-developed in successive generations. Artificial selection was successful long before science discovered the genetic basis. [[Image:IMG013biglittledogFX wb.jpg|thumb|The [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] [[mixed-breed dog|mix]] and [[Great Dane]] illustrate the range of sizes among dog breeds.]]

====Dog breeding====
{{Main|Dog breeding}}
The diversity of domesticated [[dog]]s is an example of the power of artificial selection. All breeds share common ancestry, having descended from [[wolves]]. Humans selectively bred them to enhance specific characteristics, such as color and length or body size. This created a range of breeds that include the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]], [[Great Dane]], [[Basset Hound]], [[Pug]], and [[Poodle]]. Wild wolves, which did not undergo artificial selection, are relatively uniform in comparison.

====Wild cabbage====
[[Image:Brassica oleracea0.jpg|thumb|Wild Cabbage plant]]
{{Main|Brassica oleracea}}
Early farmers cultivated many popular vegetables from the [[Brassica oleracea]] (wild cabbage) by artificially selecting for certain attributes. Common vegetables such as [[cabbage]], [[kale]], [[broccoli]], [[cauliflower]], [[kohlrabi]] and [[Brussels sprouts]] are all descendants of the wild cabbage plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Natural selection===
{{Main|Natural selection}}
[[Image:Darwin's finches.jpeg|thumb|Darwin's finches]]
Natural selection is the evolutionary process by which [[heritable]] traits that increase an individual's fitness become more common, and heritable traits that decrease an individual's fitness become less common.

====Darwin's finches====
{{Main|Darwin's finches}}
During [[Charles Darwin]]'s studies on the [[Galápagos Islands]], Darwin observed 13 species of [[Darwin's finches|finches]] that are closely related and differ most markedly in the shape of their [[beak]]s. The beak of each [[species]] is suited to the food available in its particular environment, suggesting that beak shapes evolved by [[natural selection]]. Large beaks were found on the islands where the primary source of food for the finches are [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] and therefore the large beaks allowed the birds to be better equipped for opening the nuts and staying well nourished. Slender beaks were found on the finches which found [[insect]]s to be the best source of food on the island they inhabited; their slender beaks allowed the birds to be better equipped for pulling out the insects from their tiny hiding places. The finch is also found on the main land and it is thought that they [[bird migration|migrated]] to the islands and began [[adaptation|adapting]] to their environment through [[natural selection]].

:''This article is about the modern folkloristic genre and its history. For the music and instruments of the ancient Celts until late Antiquity, see [[Ancient Celtic music]].''

'''Celtic music''' is a term utilised by artists, record companies, music stores and music magazines to describe a broad grouping of [[musical genre]]s that evolved out of the [[folk music]]al traditions of the [[Celtic people]] of [[Western Europe]]. As such there is no real body of [[music]] which can be accurately described as ''Celtic'', but the term has stuck and may refer to both orally-transmitted traditional music and recorded [[popular music]].
 
''Celtic music'' means two things mainly. First, it is the music of the peoples calling themselves ''Celts'' (a non-musical, primarily political definition), as opposed to, say, &quot;French music&quot; or &quot;English music.&quot; Secondly, it refers to whatever qualities may be unique to the musics of the Celtic Nations (a musical definition). Some insist that different ostensibly Celtic musics actually have nothing in common-–such as Geoff Wallis and Sue Wilson in their book ''The Rough Guide to Irish Music''-–whereas others (such as [[Alan Stivell]]), say they do. 

Often, the term ''Celtic music'' is applied to the [[Folk music of Ireland|music of Ireland]] and [[music of Scotland|Scotland]] because both lands have produced well-known distinctive styles which actually have genuine commonality and clear mutual influences; however, it is notable that Irish and Scottish traditional musicians themselves avoid the term &quot;Celtic music,&quot; except when forced by the necessities of the market. The definition is further complicated by the fact that Irish independence has allowed Ireland to promote 'Celtic' music as a specifically Irish product. In reality, the terms 'Scots/Scottish' and 'Irish' are purely modern geographical references to a people who share a common Celtic ancestry and consequently, a common musical heritage.

These styles are known because of the importance of Irish and Scottish people in the English speaking world, especially in the [[United States]], where they had a profound impact on [[American music]], particularly [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[country music]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chincoteagueculturalalliance.org/articles/article/5493371/95457.htm Chincoteagueculturalalliance.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[music of Wales]], [[music of Cornwall|Cornwall]], the [[music of the Isle of Man|Isle of Man]], [[music of Brittany|Brittany]], [[music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias|Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias]] ([[Spain]]) and [[music of Portugal|Portugal]] are also considered Celtic music, the tradition being particularly strong in [[Brittany]], where Celtic festivals large and small take place throughout the year, and in Wales, where the ancient [[eisteddfod]] tradition has been revived and flourishes. Additionally, the musics of ethnically Celtic peoples abroad are vibrant, especially [[Celtic music in Canada|in Canada]] and the [[Celtic music in the United States|United States]].

== Divisions ==
In ''Celtic Music: A Complete Guide'', June Skinner Sawyers acknowledges six [[Celtic nations|Celtic nationalities]] divided into two groups according to their linguistic heritage. The [[Q-Celtic]] nationalities are the [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Manx people]]s, while the [[P-Celtic]] groups are the [[Cornish people|Cornish]], [[Breton people|Bretons]] and [[Welsh people]]s. Musician [[Alan Stivell]] uses a similar dichotomy, between the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] (Irish/Scottish/Manx) and the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] (Breton/Welsh/Cornish) branches, which differentiate &quot;mostly by the extended range (sometimes more than two octaves) of Irish and Scottish melodies and the closed range of Breton and Welsh melodies (often reduced to a half-octave), and by the frequent use of the pure pentatonic scale in Gaelic music.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;translation by Steve Winick&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition debate ==
At issue is the lack of many common threads uniting the &quot;Celtic&quot; peoples listed above. While the ancient [[Celt]]s undoubtedly had their own musical styles, the actual sound of their music remains a complete mystery.

There is also tremendous variation between &quot;Celtic&quot; regions. Ireland, Scotland, and Brittany have living traditions of language and music, and there has been a recent major revival of interest in Wales. However, Cornwall and the Isle of Man have only small-scale revivalist movements that have yet to take hold. Galicia has no Celtic language today (Galician is a [[Romance language]] descending from [[Galician-Portuguese]], although all the Western part of the Peninsula had Celtic languages in pre-Roman times, as did much of Europe, but Galician music is often claimed to be &quot;Celtic.&quot; The same is true of the music of Asturias, Cantabria, and that of Northern [[Music of Portugal|Portugal]] (some say even traditional music from Central Portugal can be labeled Celtic). Thus traditionalists and [[musicology|musicological]] scholars dispute that the &quot;Celtic&quot; lands have any folk connections to each other. 

Critics of the idea of modern Celtic music claim that the idea is the creation of modern [[marketing]] designed to stimulate regional identity in the creation of a [[consumer]] [[niche market|niche]]; June Skinner Sawyers, for example, notes that &quot;Celtic music is a marketing term that I am using, for the purposes of this book, as a matter of convenience, knowing full well the [[cultural baggage]] that comes with it&quot;. The so-called &quot;marketing&quot; or &quot;show-business&quot; creation was popularized by the idealistic man who first (late 1960s) blended the music of all the Celtic countries with a modern touch in his recordings and concerts such as the 1971 album [[Renaissance of the Celtic Harp]]: the [[Breton people|Breton]] [[Alan Stivell]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Elder.

Retrieved 15 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this composer is one of the main modern promoters of this kind of music, he did not create the term.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;JT Koch (ed). Celtic Culture. A Historical Encyclopaedia ABC-CLIO 2006 pp 1627-1628&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms ==
Identifying &quot;common characteristics&quot; of Celtic music is problematic. Most of the popular musical forms now thought of as characteristically &quot;Celtic&quot; were once common in many places in Western Europe. There is debate over whether [[jigs]] were adapted from the Italian gigue, a common form of the baroque era,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standingstones.com/cmaoitm.html The origins of Irish traditional music]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Ho9DONbTpbwC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=origin+jig+italy&amp;source=web&amp;ots=GWuCTr0v3a&amp;sig=btJv8eysnsgfSzFiqbQqRwijFvw Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, while [[polka]]s have their origin in Czech and Polish tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=polka&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary, &quot;polka&quot;]; Compact Oxford English Dictionary, &quot;polka&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there are musical genres and styles specific to each Celtic country, due in part to the influence of individual song traditions and the characteristics of specific languages. [[strathspey (dance)|Strathspeys]] are specific to Highland Scotland, for example, and it has been hypothesized that they mimic the rhythms of the [[Scottish Gaelic]] language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconglen.com/culture/gaelicsong.html Traditional Gaelic song and singing sean-nós]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celtic music scene involves a large number of [[music festival]]s. Some of the most prominent include:

==Celtic fusion ==
{{main|Celtic Fusion}}

The oldest musical tradition which fits under the label of Celtic fusion originated in the rural American south in the early colonial period and incorporated Scottish, Scots-Irish, Irish, English, and African influences. Variously referred to as roots music, American folk music, or old-time music, this tradition has exerted a strong influence on all forms of American music, including country, blues, and rock and roll.&lt;ref&gt;Irish Folk, Trad and Blues: A Secret History&quot; by Colin Harper (2005) covers Horslips, The Pogues, Planxty and others.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its lasting effects on other genres, it marked the first modern large-scale mixing of musical traditions from multiple ethnic and religious communities within the [[Celtic diaspora (disambiguation)|Celtic diaspora]].

In the 1960s several bands put forward modern adaptations of Celtic music pulling influences from several of the Celtic nations at once to create a modern [[pan-celtic]] sound. A few of those include [[bagad]]où (Breton pipe bands), [[Fairport Convention]], [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]], [[Steeleye Span]] and [[Horslips]].  

In the 1970s [[Clannad]] made their mark initially in the [[Folk music|folk]] and traditional scene, and then subsequently went on to bridge the gap between traditional Celtic and [[pop music]] in the 1980s and 1990s, incorporating elements from [[New Age music|New Age]], [[smooth jazz]], and [[folk rock]]. Traces of Clannad's legacy can be heard in the music of many artists, including [[Enya]], [[Altan (band)|Altan]], [[Capercaillie (band)|Capercaillie]], [[The Corrs]], [[Loreena McKennitt]], [[Anúna]], [[Riverdance]] and [[U2]].

Later, beginning in 1982 with [[The Pogues]]' invention of Celtic folk-punk and [[Stockton's Wing]] blend of Irish traditional and Pop, Rock and Reggie, there has been a movement to incorporate [[Celt]]ic influences into other genres of music. Bands like [[Flogging Molly]], [[Black 47]], [[Dropkick Murphys]], [[The Young Dubliners]], [[The Tossers]] introduced a hybrid of [[Celtic rock]], [[Punk rock|punk]], [[reggae]], [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] and other elements in the 1990s that has become popular with Irish-American youth.

Today there are Celtic-influenced sub genres of virtually every type of popular music including [[electronica]], [[Celtic rock|rock]], [[Celtic metal|metal]], [[Celtic punk|punk]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[reggae]], [[New Age music|new age]], [[latin music|Latin]], [[Andean music|Andean]] and [[Pop music|pop]]. Collectively these modern interpretations of Celtic music are sometimes referred to as [[Celtic fusion]].

== Other modern adaptations ==
Outside of America, the first deliberate attempts to create a &quot;Pan-Celtic music&quot; were made by the Breton [[François Jaffrennou|Taldir Jaffrennou]], having translated songs from Ireland, Scotland, and Wales into Breton between the two world wars. One of his major works was to bring &quot;[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]&quot; (the Welsh [[national anthem]]) back in Brittany and create lyrics in Breton. Eventually this song became &quot;''Bro goz va zadoù''&quot; (&quot;Old land of my fathers&quot;) and is the most widely accepted Breton anthem. In the 70s, the Breton [[Alan Cochevelou]] (future [[Alan Stivell]]) began playing a mixed repertoire from the main Celtic countries on the Celtic harp his father created.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Probably the most successful all inclusive Celtic music composition in recent years is [[Shaun Davey]]s composition [[The Pilgrim (1983 album)|'The Pilgrim']]. This suite depicts the journey of St. Colum Cille through the Celtic nations of [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], the [[Isle of Man]], [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], [[Brittany]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. The suite which includes a Scottish pipe band, Irish and Welsh harpists, [[Galician gaita]]s, Irish [[uilleann pipes]], the [[bombarde]]s of [[Brittany]], two vocal soloists and a narrator is set against a background of a classical orchestra and a large choir. 

Modern music may also be termed &quot;Celtic&quot; because it is written and recorded in a Celtic language, regardless of musical style. Many of the Celtic languages have experienced resurgences in modern years, spurred on partly by the action of artists and musicians who have embraced them as hallmarks of identity and distinctness. In 1971, the Irish band ''[[Skara Brae (band)|Skara Brae]]'' recorded its first and only [[LP album|LP]] (simply called ''Skara Brae''), all songs in [[Irish Gaelic]]. In 1978 [[Runrig]] recorded an album in [[Scottish Gaelic]]. In 1992 [[Capercaillie (band)|Capercaillie]] recorded &quot;A Prince Among Islands&quot;, the first Scottish Gaelic language record to reach the UK top 40. In 1996, a song in Breton represented France in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|41st Eurovision Song Contest]], the first time in history that France had a song without a word in French. Since about 2005, [[Oi Polloi]] (from Scotland) have recorded in Scottish Gaelic. [[Mill a h-Uile Rud]] (a [[Scottish Gaelic punk]] band from Seattle) recorded in the language in 2004.

Several contemporary bands have Welsh language songs, such as [[Ceredwen]], which fuses traditional instruments with [[trip-hop]] beats, the [[Super Furry Animals]], [[Fernhill (band)|Fernhill]], and so on (see the [[Music of Wales]] article for more Welsh and Welsh-language bands). The same phenomenon occurs in Brittany, where many singers record songs in Breton, traditional or modern (hip hop, [[Rap music|rap]], and so on.).

{{More footnotes|date=November 2009}}
[[File:Orion constellation map.svg|320px|thumb|The constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] is one of the most recognizable in the night sky. The name is associated with the region of the star map marked in yellow, as well as with the pattern of stars within this area, marked in green.]]
In modern [[astronomy]], a '''constellation''' is an internationally defined area of the [[celestial sphere]]. Historically, the term was also used to refer to a perceived pattern formed by prominent stars within apparent proximity to one another, and this practice is still common today.

==Definition==
In colloquial usage, a constellation is a group of celestial bodies, usually stars, which appear to form a pattern or picture in the sky. Astronomers today still utilize the term, though the current system focuses primarily on constellations as grid-like segments of the celestial sphere rather than as patterns. A star-pattern that is not officially classed as a constellation is referred to as an [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]. One famous example is the asterism known as the [[Big Dipper]], a term unused by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) as the stars are considered part of the larger constellation of [[Ursa Major]].

In 1922, [[Henry Norris Russell]] aided the IAU in dividing the celestial sphere into 88 official constellations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/iaulist1.htm| title = The original names and abbreviations for constellations from 1922. | accessdate = 2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where possible, these modern constellations usually share the names of their Graeco-Roman predecessors, such as [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] and [[Scorpius]]. While such celestial formations were originally linked to a mythical event, creature or person, the categorization of the night sky into recognizable patterns was important in early land and naval navigation prior to the invention of the [[compass]] during the [[Age of Discovery]]. With the technical advancement of astronomy, it became important to move from a pattern-based system of constellations to one based on area-mapping, which led to several historic formations becoming obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iau.org/public/constellations//| title = The IAU on constellations| accessdate = 2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the modern constellations, 37 lie predominantly in the northern sky, and the other 51 predominantly in the southern. Since much of the southern sky was not visible to classical astronomers based around the [[Mediterranean Sea]], many of the constellations of the far south were named only in the last 300 years, and have no ancient counterparts.

In 1930, the boundaries between the 88 official constellations were devised by [[Eugène Delporte]] along vertical and horizontal lines of [[right ascension]] and [[declination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/boundaries.htm| title = Constellation boundaries. | accessdate = 2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the data he used originated back to [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] [[B1875.0]], which was when [[Benjamin A. Gould]] first made the proposal to designate boundaries for the celestial sphere, a suggestion upon which Delporte would base his work. The consequence of this early date is that due to the [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] of the [[equinox]]es, the borders on a modern star map, such as epoch [[J2000]], are already somewhat skewed and no longer perfectly vertical or horizontal. This effect will increase over the years and centuries to come.

==Proximity==
The stars within a constellation rarely have any substantial astrophysical relationship to each other, and their apparent proximity when viewed from Earth disguises the fact that they are far apart, some being much farther from Earth than others. However, there are some exceptions: many of the stars in the constellation of [[Ursa Major]] (including most of the [[Big Dipper]]) are genuinely close to one another, travel through the [[galaxy]] with similar [[proper motion|velocities]], and are likely to have formed together as part of a [[star cluster|cluster]] that is slowly dispersing. These stars form the [[Ursa Major moving group]].

==History==
{{see|Obsolete constellations}}

{{See also|Babylonian star catalogues}}
The oldest catalogues of stars and constellations are from [[Old Babylonian astronomy]], beginning in the [[Middle Bronze Age]]. The numerous [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] names in these catalogues suggest that they build on older, but otherwise unattested, [[Sumer]]ian traditions of the [[Early Bronze Age]].  The classical [[Zodiac]] is a product of a revision of the Old Babylonian system in later [[Neo-Babylonian]] astronomy.
===Graeco-Roman===
The first ancient Greek works which dealt with the constellations were books of star myths. The oldest of these was a poem composed by [[Hesiod]] in or around the eighth century BC, of which only fragments survive. 

[[Aratus]] in the 3rd century BC compiled a verse setting of the otherwise lost catalogue of constellations of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] (4th century BC). Eudoxus was  in the reception of the older [[Babylonian star catalogues]] in ancient [[Greek astronomy]].

The most complete existing works dealing with the mythical origins of the constellations are by the Hellenistic writer termed [[pseudo-Eratosthenes]] and an early Roman writer styled pseudo-[[Hyginus]].
In the 2nd century AD, the Greek astronomer [[Ptolemy]] described the constellations in great detail in his influential work the ''[[Almagest]]''.

===Chinese===
{{Main|Chinese constellation}}
Chinese constellations are different from the Western constellations due to the independent development of ancient [[China|Chinese]] [[astronomy]]. One difference is that the Chinese counterpart of the 12 western [[zodiac]] constellations is the 28 &quot;Xiu&quot; (宿) or &quot;mansions&quot; (a literal translation).

==Dark cloud constellations==

[[File:Emu public.jpg|frame|The &quot;[[Emu]] in the sky,&quot; a constellation defined by dark clouds rather than the stars. A western interpretation would recognise [[Crux]] (the Southern Cross) above the emu's head and [[Scorpius]] on the left. The head of the emu is the [[Coalsack]].]]

More visible and striking in the [[southern hemisphere]] than in the northern, dark patches in the [[Milky Way]] vividly stand out in Earth conditions when the Milky Way central region casts noticeable shadows on the ground. Some cultures have discerned shapes in these patches and have given names to these &quot;dark cloud constellations.&quot; Members of the [[Inca]] civilization identified various dark areas or [[dark nebula]]e in the [[Milky Way]] as animals, and associated their appearance with the seasonal rains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronomy.pomona.edu/archeo/andes/inca.nightsky.html The Incan View of the Night Sky]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian Aboriginal astronomy]] also describes dark cloud constellations, the most famous being the &quot;emu in the sky&quot; whose head is formed by the [[Coalsack]].

[[File:Canon ir2270.jpg|thumb|A modern printer with scanning/copying capability]]
[[File:Nintendo PocketPrinter.JPG|thumb|upright|Small printer]]

In computing, a '''printer''' is a [[peripheral]] which produces a text and/or graphics of documents stored in 
[[electronics|electronic]] form, usually on physical print media such as paper or transparencies. Many printers are primarily used as local peripherals, and are attached by a [[printer cable]] or, in most newer printers, a [[USB]] cable to a computer which serves as a document source. Some printers, commonly known as ''network printers'', have built-in [[computer network|network]] interfaces, typically [[wireless LAN|wireless]] and/or [[Ethernet]] based, and can serve as a hard copy device for any user on the network. Individual printers are often designed to support both local and network connected users at the same time. In addition, a few modern printers can directly interface to electronic media such as [[memory card]]s, or to image capture devices such as [[digital camera]]s, [[image scanner|scanners]]; some printers are combined with a scanners and/or [[fax]] machines in a single unit, and can function as [[photocopier]]s. Printers that include non-printing features are sometimes called [[multifunction printer]]s (MFP), multi-function devices (MFD), or all-in-one (AIO) printers. Most MFPs include printing, scanning, and copying among their many features. 

Consumer and some commercial printers are designed for low-volume, short-turnaround print jobs; requiring virtually no setup time to achieve a hard copy of a given document. However, printers are generally slow devices (30 pages per minute is considered fast; and many inexpensive consumer printers are far slower than that), and the cost per page is actually relatively high. However, this is offset by the on-demand convenience and project management costs being more controllable compared to an out-sourced solution. The [[printing press]] remains the machine of choice for high-volume, professional publishing.  However, as printers have improved in quality and performance, many jobs which used to be done by professional print shops are now done by users on local printers; see [[desktop publishing]]. The world's first computer printer was a 19th century mechanically driven apparatus invented by [[Charles Babbage]] for his [[Difference Engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/710950.stm | title = Babbage printer finally runs | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 13 April 2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[virtual printer]] is a piece of computer software whose user interface and [[Application programming interface|API]] resemble that of a printer driver, but which is not connected with a physical computer printer.

== Printing technology ==
Printers are routinely classified by the printer technology they employ; numerous such technologies have been developed over the years. The choice of engine has a substantial effect on what jobs a printer is suitable for, as different technologies are capable of different levels of image or text quality, print speed, low cost, noise; in addition, some printer technologies are inappropriate for certain types of physical media, such as [[carbon paper]] or [[transparency (projection)|transparencies]]. 

A second aspect of printer technology that is often forgotten is resistance to alteration: liquid [[ink]], such as from an inkjet head or fabric ribbon, becomes absorbed by the paper fibers, so documents printed with liquid ink are more difficult to alter than documents printed with toner or solid inks, which do not penetrate below the paper surface.

Cheques should either be printed with liquid ink or on special cheque paper with toner anchorage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abagnale.com/pdf/protection_b.pdf|format=PDF|title=Protection Against Cheque Fraud|publisher=abagnale.com|author=Abagnale, Frank|authorlink=Frank Abagnale|year=2007|accessdate=2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; For similar reasons carbon film ribbons for IBM Selectric typewriters bore labels warning against using them to type negotiable instruments such as cheques. The machine-readable lower portion of a cheque, however, must be printed using [[magnetic ink character recognition|MICR]] toner or ink. Banks and other clearing houses employ automation equipment that relies on the [[magnetic flux]] from these specially printed characters to function properly.

== Modern print technology ==
The following printing technologies are routinely found in modern printers:

=== Toner-based printers ===
{{main|Laser printer}}
A [[laser printer]] rapidly produces high quality text and graphics. As with digital photocopiers and multifunction printers (MFPs), laser printers employ a [[xerography|xerographic]] printing process but differ from analog photocopiers in that the image is produced by the direct scanning of a [[laser]] beam across the printer's [[photodetector|photoreceptor]].

Another toner-based printer is the [[LED printer]] which uses an array of [[light-emitting diode|LEDs]] instead of a [[laser]] to cause toner [[adhesion]] to the print drum.

=== Liquid inkjet printers ===
[[Inkjet printers]] operate by propelling variably-sized droplets of liquid or molten material (ink) onto almost any sized page. They are the most common type of computer printer used by consumers.

=== Solid ink printers ===
{{main|Solid ink}}
[[Solid ink]] printers, also known as phase-change printers, are a type of [[thermal transfer printer]]. They use solid sticks of [[CMYK color model|CMYK]]-coloured ink, similar in consistency to candle wax, which are melted and fed into a piezo crystal operated print-head. The printhead sprays the ink on a rotating, oil coated drum. The paper then passes over the print drum, at which time the image is transferred, or transfixed, to the page. Solid ink printers are most commonly used as colour office printers, and are excellent at printing on transparencies and other non-porous media. Solid ink printers can produce excellent results. Acquisition and operating costs are similar to laser printers. Drawbacks of the technology include high [[energy conservation|energy consumption]] and long warm-up times from a cold state. Also, some users complain that the resulting prints are difficult to write on, as the wax tends to repel inks from [[pen]]s, and are difficult to feed through [[automatic document feeder]]s, but these traits have been significantly reduced in later models. In addition, this type of printer is only available from one manufacturer, [[Xerox]], manufactured as part of their [[Xerox Phaser]] office printer line, it is also available by various Xerox concessionaires [http://www.xactuk.com].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xactuk.com&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, [[solid ink]] printers were manufactured by [[Tektronix]], but Tek sold the printing business to Xerox in 2001.

=== Dye-sublimation printers ===
{{main|Dye-sublimation printer}}
A '''dye-sublimation printer''' (or '''dye-sub printer''') is a printer which employs a printing process that uses heat to transfer dye to a medium such as a plastic card, paper or [[canvas print|canvas]]. The process is usually to lay one colour at a time using a ribbon that has colour panels. Dye-sub printers are intended primarily for high-quality colour applications, including colour photography; and are less well-suited for text. While once the province of high-end print shops, dye-sublimation printers are now increasingly used as dedicated consumer photo printers.

=== Inkless printers ===
==== Thermal printers ====
{{main|Thermal printer}}
'''Thermal printers''' work by selectively heating regions of special heat-sensitive paper. Monochrome thermal printers are used in cash registers, [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]], [[Fuel dispenser|gasoline dispensers]] and some older inexpensive fax machines. Colours can be achieved with special papers and different temperatures and heating rates for different colours; these coloured sheets are not required in black-and-white output. One example is the ZINK technology.

==== UV printers ====
[[Xerox]] is working on an inkless printer which will use a special reusable paper coated with a few [[micrometre]]s of [[Ultraviolet|UV light]] sensitive chemicals. The printer will use a special UV light bar which will be able to write and erase the paper. As of early 2007 this technology is still in development and the text on the printed pages can only last between 16–24 hours before fading.

== Obsolete and special-purpose printing technologies {{anchor|Impact printers}} ==
[[image:Epson MX-80.jpg|thumb|right|An Epson MX-80]]
The following technologies are either obsolete, or limited to special applications though most were, at one time, in widespread use.

'''Impact printers''' rely on a [[force|forcible]] impact to transfer ink to the media, similar to the action of a [[typewriter]]. All but the [[dot matrix printer]] rely on the use of [[typesetting|formed characters]], [[letterform]]s that represent each of the characters that the printer was capable of printing. In addition, most of these printers were limited to monochrome printing in a single typeface at one time, although [[emphasis (typography)|bolding]] and [[underlining]] of text could be done by &quot;overstriking&quot;, that is, printing two or more impressions in the same character position. Impact printers varieties include, typewriter-derived printers, teletypewriter-derived printers, daisy wheel printers, dot matrix printers and line printers. Dot matrix printers remain in common use in businesses where multi-part forms are printed, such as car rental services. ''An overview of impact printing'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/416/zable.pdf|format=PDF|title=An overview of impact printing|publisher=IBM Journal of Research and Development|author=J. L. Zable and H. C. Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains a detailed description of many of the technologies used.

'''Pen-based plotters''' were an alternate printing technology once common in engineering and architectural firms. Pen-based plotters rely on contact with the paper, but not impact, per se, and special purpose pens that are mechanically run over the paper to create text and images.

=== Typewriter-derived printers ===
{{main|Friden Flexowriter|IBM Selectric typewriter}}
Several different computer printers were simply computer-controllable versions of existing electric typewriters. The [[Friden Flexowriter]] and [[IBM Selectric typewriter]] were the most-common examples. The Flexowriter printed with a conventional typebar mechanism while the Selectric used IBM's well-known &quot;golf ball&quot; printing mechanism. In either case, the letter form then struck a ribbon which was pressed against the paper, printing one character at a time. The maximum speed of the Selectric printer (the faster of the two) was 15.5 characters per second.

=== Teletypewriter-derived printers ===
{{main|Teleprinter}}
The common [[teleprinter]] could easily be interfaced to the computer and became very popular except for those computers manufactured by [[IBM]]. Some models used a &quot;typebox&quot; that was positioned, in the X- and Y-axes, by a mechanism and the selected letter form was struck by a hammer. Others used a type cylinder in a similar way as the Selectric typewriters used their type ball. In either case, the letter form then struck a ribbon to print the letterform. Most teleprinters operated at ten characters per second although a few achieved 15 CPS.

=== Daisy wheel printers ===
{{main|Daisy wheel printer}}
Daisy-wheel printers operate in much the same fashion as a [[typewriter]]. A hammer strikes a wheel with petals, the &quot;daisy wheel&quot;, each petal containing a letter form at its tip. The letter form strikes a ribbon of [[ink]], depositing the ink on the page and thus printing a character. By rotating the daisy wheel, different characters are selected for printing. These printers were also referred to as ''letter-quality printers'' because, during their heyday, they could produce text which was as clear and crisp as a typewriter, though they were nowhere near the quality of [[printing press]]es. The fastest letter-quality printers printed at 30 characters per second.

=== Dot-matrix printers ===
{{main|Dot matrix printer}}
In the general sense many printers rely on a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of [[pixel]]s, or [[decimal separator|dot]]s, that together form the larger image. However, the term [[dot matrix printer]] is specifically used for impact printers that use a matrix of small [[pin]]s to create precise dots. The advantage of dot-matrix over other impact printers is that they can produce [[graphic design|graphical]] images in addition to text; however the text is generally of poorer quality than impact printers that use letterforms (''type'').

[[Image:Tandy1000HX.jpg|thumbnail|right|275px|A [[Tandy 1000]] HX with a Tandy DMP-133 dot-matrix printer.]]
Dot-matrix printers can be broadly divided into two major classes:
* Ballistic wire printers (discussed in the [[dot matrix printer]]s article)
* [[Stored energy printer]]s

Dot matrix printers can either be [[character (computing)|character]]-based or line-based (that is, a single horizontal series of pixels across the page), referring to the configuration of the print head.

At one time, dot matrix printers were one of the more common types of printers used for general use, such as for home and small office use. Such printers would have either 9 or 24 pins on the print head. 24-pin print heads were able to print at a higher quality. Once the price of inkjet printers dropped to the point where they were competitive with dot matrix printers, dot matrix printers began to fall out of favor for general use.

Some dot matrix printers, such as the NEC P6300, can be upgraded to print in colour. This is achieved through the use of a four-colour ribbon mounted on a mechanism (provided in an upgrade kit that replaces the standard black ribbon mechanism after installation) that raises and lowers the ribbons as needed. Colour graphics are generally printed in four passes at standard resolution, thus slowing down printing considerably. As a result, colour graphics can take up to four times longer to print than standard monochrome graphics, or up to 8-16 times as long at high resolution mode.

Dot matrix printers are still commonly used in low-cost, low-quality applications like [[cash register]]s, or in demanding, very high volume applications like [[invoice]] printing. The fact that they use an impact printing method allows them to be used to print multi-part documents using [[carbonless copy paper]], like sales invoices and [[credit card]] receipts, whereas other printing methods are unusable with paper of this type. Dot-matrix printers are now (as of 2005) rapidly being superseded even as receipt printers.

===Line printers===
'''Line printers''', as the name implies, print an entire line of text at a time. Three principal designs existed. In drum printers, a drum carries the entire character set of the printer repeated in each column that is to be printed. In chain printers, also known as train printers, the character set is arranged multiple times around a chain that travels horizontally past the print line. In either case, to print a line, precisely timed hammers strike against the back of the paper at the exact moment that the correct character to be printed is passing in front of the paper. The paper presses forward against a ribbon which then presses against the character form and the impression of the character form is printed onto the paper.

Comb printers, also called [[line matrix printer]]s, represent the third major design. These printers were a hybrid of [[dot matrix printing]] and line printing. In these printers, a comb of hammers printed a portion of a row of pixels at one time, such as every eighth pixel. By shifting the comb back and forth slightly, the entire pixel row could be printed, continuing the example, in just eight cycles. The paper then advanced and the next pixel row was printed. Because far less motion was involved than in a conventional dot matrix printer, these printers were very fast compared to dot matrix printers and were competitive in speed with formed-character line printers while also being able to print dot matrix graphics.

Line printers, better known as [[line matrix printer]]s are widely used in the automotive, logistic and banking world for high speed and [[barcode]] printing. They are known as robust and durable printers that have the lowest price per page, label or other item.  [[Printronix]] and [[TallyGenicom]] are among the leading manufacturers today. 

Line printers were the fastest of all impact printers and were used for bulk printing in large computer centres. They were virtually never used with [[personal computer]]s and have now been replaced by high-speed [[laser printer]]s.  The legacy of line printers lives on in many computer [[operating system]]s, which use the abbreviations &quot;lp&quot;, &quot;lpr&quot;, or &quot;LPT&quot; to refer to printers.

=== Pen-based plotters ===
{{main|Plotter}}
A '''plotter''' is a [[vector graphics]] printing device which operates by moving a pen over the surface of paper. Plotters have been used in applications such as [[computer-aided design]], though they are rarely used now and are being replaced with wide-format conventional printers, which nowadays have sufficient resolution to render high-quality vector graphics using a [[rasterized]] print engine. It is commonplace to refer to such wide-format printers as &quot;plotters&quot;, even though such usage is technically incorrect. There are two types of plotters, flat bed and drum.

Since 2005, the world's top selling brand of [[inkjet]] and [[laser printers]] has been [[HP]] which now has 46% of sales in [[inkjet]] and 50.5% in laser printers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/02/27/news/companies/lashinsky_hurd.fortune/index.htm |title=Mark Hurd's moment |first=Adam |last=Lashinsky |date=March 3, 2009 |work=[[CNN Money]] }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other printers ==
A number of other sorts of printers are important for historical reasons, or for special purpose uses:
* [[Minilab|Digital minilab]] ([[photographic paper]])
* [[VT52|Electrolytic printers]]
* [[Spark printer]]
* [[Barcode printer]] multiple technologies, including: [[thermal printing]], [[inkjet printing]], and [[laser printing]] [[barcode]]s
* Billboard / sign paint spray printers
* Laser etching (product packaging) industrial printers
* Microsphere (special paper)

== Printing mode ==
The data received by a printer may be:
* [[plain text|A string of characters]]
* [[raster graphics|A bitmapped image]]
* [[vector graphics|A vector image]]

Some printers can process all three types of data, others not.

* Character printers, such as [[daisy wheel printer]]s, can handle only plain text data or rather simple point plots.
* Pen [[plotter]]s typically process [[vector image]]s. Inkjet based plotters can adequately reproduce all three.
* [http://www.firstcopy.co.uk Modern printing technology], such as [[laser printer]]s and [[inkjet printer]]s, can adequately reproduce all three. This is especially true of printers equipped with support for [[PostScript]] and/or [[page description language|PCL]]; which includes the vast majority of printers produced today.

Today it is common to print everything (even plain text) by sending ready bitmapped images to the printer, because it allows better control over formatting.&amp;nbsp; Many [[printer driver]]s do not use the text mode at all, even if the printer is capable of it.

== Monochrome, colour and photo printers ==
A [[monochrome]] printer can only produce an [[image]] consisting of one [[colour]], usually black. A monochrome printer may also be able to produce various tones of that color, such as a [[grayscale|grey-scale]]. A colour printer can produce images of multiple colours. A photo printer is a colour printer that can produce images that mimic the [[gamut|colour range]] (gamut) and [[image resolution|resolution]] of prints made from [[photographic film]]. Many can be used on a [[standalone]] basis without a computer, using a [[memory card]] or [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] connector.

== The printer manufacturing business ==
Often the [[freebie marketing|razor and blades business model]] is applied. That is, a company may sell a printer at cost, and make profits on the [[ink cartridge]], paper, or some other [[spare part|replacement part]]. This has caused legal disputes regarding the right of companies other than the printer manufacturer to sell [[computer compatibility|compatible]] ink cartridges. To protect their business model, several manufacturers invest heavily in developing new cartridge technology and patenting it.

Other manufacturers, in reaction to the challenges from using this business model, choose to make more money on printers and less on the ink, promoting the latter through their advertising campaigns. Finally, this generates two clearly different proposals: &quot;cheap printer&amp;nbsp;— expensive ink&quot; or &quot;expensive printer&amp;nbsp;— cheap ink&quot;. Ultimately, the consumer decision depends on their reference [[interest rate]] or their [[time preference]]. From an [[Economics]] viewpoint, there is a clear [[trade-off]] between cost per copy and cost of the printer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officenet.com.ar/impresoras/ Cost per Page versus Printer cost in currently available printers&lt;!-- could not find an English version, only Spanish or Portuguese http://www.officenet.com.br/impresoras/--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Printing speed ==
The speed of early printers was measured in units of characters per second. More modern printers are measured in pages per minute. These measures are used primarily as a marketing tool, and are not as well standardised as [[ISO/IEC 19752|toner yields]]. Usually pages per minute refers to sparse monochrome office documents, rather than dense pictures which usually print much more slowly, especially colour images. PPM are most of the time referring to [[ISO 216|A4 paper]] in Europe and [[letter (paper size)|letter]] paper in the United States, resulting in a 5-10% difference.

== Printer steganography ==
[[Image:Printer Stenography Illustration.png|250px|thumb|right|An illustration showing small yellow tracking dots on white paper, generated by a color laser printer.]]
:''Main article: [[printer steganography]]''
Printer steganography is a type of [[steganography]] produced by [[color printer]]s, including [[Brother Industries|Brother]], Canon, Dell, Epson, [[HP]], IBM, [[Konica Minolta]], Kyocera, Lanier, Lexmark, Ricoh, Toshiba and [[Xerox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Printers Which Do or Do Not Display Tracking Dots|url=https://www.eff.org/pages/list-printers-which-do-or-do-not-display-tracking-dots|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]}} Retrieved 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; brand color [[laser printers]], where tiny yellow dots are added to each page.

{{Intellectual property}}

'''Copyright''' 
is a set of [[exclusive rights]] granted to the author or creator of an original work, including the right to copy, distribute and adapt the work. In most jurisdictions copyright arises upon fixation and does not need to be registered. Copyright owners have the exclusive statutory right to exercise control over copying and other exploitation of the works for a specific period of time, after which the work is said to enter the [[public domain]]. Uses covered under [[limitations and exceptions to copyright]], such as [[fair use]], do not require permission from the copyright owner. All other uses require permission. Copyright owners can license or permanently transfer or assign their exclusive rights to others.

Initially copyright law applied to only the copying of books. Over time other uses such as translations and [[derivative works]] were made subject to copyright. Copyright now covers a wide range of works, including [[maps]], [[sheet music]], [[drama|dramatic works]], [[painting]]s, [[photograph]]s, [[architectural drawing]]s, [[sound recording]]s, [[motion picture]]s and [[computer program]]s. The British [[Statute of Anne]] 1709, full title &quot;An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or purchasers of such Copies, during the Times therein mentioned&quot;, was the first copyright statute. Today copyright laws are partially standardized through international and regional agreements such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] and the [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty | WIPO Copyright Treaty]]. Although there are consistencies among nations' copyright laws, each jurisdiction has separate and distinct laws and regulations covering copyright. National copyright laws on licensing, transfer and assignment of copyright still vary greatly between countries and copyrighted works are licensed on a territorial basis. Some jurisdictions also recognize [[moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] of creators, such as the right to be credited for the work.

==Justification==
{{Main|Philosophy of copyright}}
The British [[Statute of Anne]] of 1709 was the first act to directly protect the rights of authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broussard&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| first= Sharee L.  | last= Broussard| title= The copyleft movement: creative commons licensing | publisher= Communication Research Trends | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7081/is_3_26/ai_n28457434?tag=content;col1 | date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under US copyright law, the justification appears in [[Enumerated powers|Article I, Section 8]] Clause 8 of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], known as the [[Copyright Clause]]. It empowers the [[United States Congress]] &quot;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Article I, Section 8, Clause 8, [[United States Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] the purpose of copyright is twofold:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;To encourage a dynamic culture, while returning value to creators so that they can lead a dignified economic existence, and to provide widespread, affordable access to content for the public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Copyright and Related Rights | publisher = World Intellectual Property Organization | url = http://www.wipo.int/copyright/en/ | accessdate = 7 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of copyright law}}

===Early European printers' monopoly===
The origin of copyright law in most European countries lies in efforts by the church and governments to regulate and control printing,&lt;ref name=&quot;MacQueen 2007 34&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = MacQueen | first = Hector L | coauthors = Charlotte Waelde and Graeme T Laurie | title = Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2007 | page = 34 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=_Iwcn4pT0OoC&amp;dq=contemporary+intellectual+property&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 9780199263394}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was widely established in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacQueen 2007 34&quot;/&gt; Before the invention of the [[printing press]] a writing, once created, could only be physically multiplied by the highly laborious and error-prone process of manual copying by [[scribe]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;de Sola Pool 1983 14&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = de Sola Pool| first = Ithiel | title = Technologies of freedom| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1983 | page = 14 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=BzLXGUxV4CkC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=36#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false| isbn = 9780674872332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing allowed for multiple exact copies of a work, leading to a more rapid and widespread circulation of ideas and information (see [[print culture]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;MacQueen 2007 34&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Areopagitica 1644bw gobeirne.png|thumb|left|150px|[[John Milton]]'s 1644 edition of ''[[Areopagitica]]'', long title ''Areopagitica: A speech of Mr. John Milton for the liberty of unlicensed printing to the Parliament of England'', in it he argued forcefully against the [[Licensing Order of 1643]].]]
While governments and the church encouraged printing in many ways, which allowed the dissemination of [[Bible]]s and government information, works of dissent and criticism could also circulate rapidly. As a consequence, governments established controls over printers across Europe, requiring them to have official licenses to trade and produce books. The licenses typically gave printers the exclusive right to print particular works for a fixed period of years, and enabled the printer to prevent others from printing or importing the same work during that period.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacQueen 2007 34&quot;/&gt; The notion that the expression of dissent should be tolerated, not censured or punished by law, developed alongside the rise of [[printing]] and the [[news media|press]]. The [[Areopagitica]], published in 1644 under the full title ''Areopagitica: A speech of Mr. John Milton for the liberty of unlicensed printing to the Parliament of England'', was [[John Milton]]'s response to the [[British parliament]] re-introducing government licensing of [[printer (publishing)|printers]], hence [[publishers]]. In doing so, Milton articulated the main strands of future discussions about [[freedom of expression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Sanders| first = Karen| title = Ethics &amp; Journalism| publisher = Sage| year = 2003| page = 66| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=bnpliIUyO60C&amp;dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780761969679}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the &quot;menace&quot; of printing spread, governments established centralized control mechanisms&lt;ref name=&quot;de Sola Pool 1983 15&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = de Sola Pool| first = Ithiel | title = Technologies of freedom| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1983 | page = 15 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=BzLXGUxV4CkC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=36#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false| isbn = 9780674872332}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1557 the [[British Crown]] thought to stem the flow of seditious and heretical books by chartering the [[Stationers' Company]]. The right to print was limited to the members of that guild, and thirty years later the [[Star Chamber]] was chartered to curtail the &quot;greate enormities and abuses&quot; of &quot;dyvers contentyous and disorderlye persons professinge the arte or mystere of pryntinge or selling of books.&quot; The right to print was restricted to two universities and to the 21 existing printers in the [[city of London]],  which had 53 [[printing presses]]. The French crown also repressed printing, and printer [[Etienne Dolet]] was burned at the stake in 1546. As the British took control of type founding in 1637, printers fled to the [[Netherlands]]. Confrontation with authority made printers radical and rebellious, with 800 authors, printers and book dealers being incarcerated in the [[Bastille]] before it was stormed in 1789.&lt;ref name=&quot;de Sola Pool 1983 15&quot;/&gt;

===Early British copyright law===
{{Main|Statute of Anne}}
[[Image:Statute of anne.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Statute of Anne]] came into force in 1710]]

In England the printers, known as stationers, formed a collective organization, known as the [[Stationers' Company]]. In the 16th century the Stationers' Company was given the power to require all lawfully printed books to be entered into its register. Only members of the Stationers' Company could enter books into the register. This meant that the Stationers' Company achieved a dominant position over publishing in 17th century England (no equivalent arrangement formed in Scotland and Ireland). The monopoly came to an end in 1694, when the English Parliament did not renew the Stationers Company's power.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacQueen 2007 34&quot;/&gt; The newly established [[Parliament of Great Britain]] passed the first copyright statute, the [[Statute of Anne]], full title &quot;An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or purchasers of such Copies, during the Times therein mentioned&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacQueen 2007 34&quot;/&gt;

The coming into force of the Statute of Anne in April 1710 marked a historic moment in the development of copyright law. As the world's first copyright statute it granted publishers of a book legal protection of 14 years with the commencement of the statute. It also granted 21 years of protection for any book already in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ronan | first = Deazley| title = Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2006| page = 13| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9781845422820 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the monopoly granted to the [[Stationers' Company]] previously, the Statute of Anne was concerned with the reading public, the continued production of useful literature, and the advancement and spread of [[education]]. To encourage &quot;learned men to compose and write useful books&quot; the statute guaranteed the finite right to print and reprint those works. It established a pragmatic bargain involving authors, the booksellers and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ronan | first = Deazley| title = Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2006| pages = 13–14| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9781845422820 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Statute of Anne ended the old system whereby only literature that met the [[censorship]] standards administered by the booksellers could appear in print. The statute furthermore created a [[public domain]] for literature, as previously all literature belonged to the booksellers forever.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jonathan 1997 34&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Jonathan| first = Rosenoer| title = Cyberlaw: the law of the internet| publisher = Springer| year = 1997| page = 34| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=HlG2esMIm7kC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780387948324 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Common law copyright====
When the statutory [[copyright term]] provided for by the Statute of Anne began to expire in 1731 London booksellers thought to defend their dominant position by seeking [[injunctions]] from the [[Court of Chancery]] for works by authors that fell outside the statute's protection. At the same time the London booksellers lobbied parliament to extend the copyright term provided by the Statute of Anne. Eventually, in a case known as Midwinter v. Hamilton (1743–1748), the London booksellers turned to [[common law]] and starting a 30 year period known as the ''battle of the booksellers''. The London booksellers argued that the Statute of Anne only supplemented and supported a pre-existing common law copyright. The dispute was argued out in a number of notable cases, including Millar v Kincaid (1749–1751), Tonson v Collins (1761–1762),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ronan | first = Deazley| title = Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2006| page = 14| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9781845422820 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Donaldson v Beckett]] (1774). Donaldson v Beckett eventually established that copyright was a &quot;creature of statute&quot;, and that the rights and responsibilities in copyright were determined by legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Rimmer| first = Matthew| title = Digital copyright and the consumer revolution: hands off my iPod | publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing | year = 2007| page = 4| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=1ONyncVruj8C&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright+scotland&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9781845429485}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lords clearly voted against perpetual copyright&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Marshall| first = Lee| title = Bootlegging: romanticism and copyright in the music industry| publisher = Sage| year = 2006| page = 15| url =http://www.google.com/books?id=25luX89BlA0C&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright+scotland&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780761944904 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by confirming that the [[copyright term]]—that is the length of time a work is in copyright—did expire according to statute the Lords also confirmed that a large number of works and books first published in Britain were in the public domain, either because the copyright term granted by statute had expired, or because they were first published before the [[Statute of Anne]] was enacted in 1709. This opened the market for cheap reprints of works from [[Shakespeare]], [[John Milton]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], works now considered classics. The expansion of the public domain in books broke the dominance of the London booksellers and allowed for competition, with the number of London booksellers and publishers rising threefold from 111 to 308 between 1772 and 1802.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Van Horn Melton| first = James| title = The rise of the public in Enlightenment Europe| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2001| pages =140–141| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=QZovusQ1SjYC&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =9780521469692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early French copyright law===
{{Main|French copyright law}}
In pre-[[French Revolution|revolutionary]] France all books needed to be approved by official censors and authors and publishers had to obtain a royal privilege before a book could be published. Royal privileges were exclusive and usually granted for six years, with the possibility of renewal. Over time it was established that the owner of a royal privilege has the sole right to obtain a renewal indefinitely. In 1761 the Royal Council awarded a royal privilege to the heirs of an author rather than the author's publisher, sparking a national debate on the nature of literary property similar to that taking place in Britain during the battle of the booksellers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter K 2007 141–142&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Peter K| first = Yu| title = Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2007| pages = 141–142| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=tgK9BzcF5WgC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780275988838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1777 a series of royal decrees reformed the royal privileges. The duration of privileges were set at a minimum duration of 10 years or the life of the author, which ever was longer. If the author obtained a privilege and did not transfer or sell it on, he could publish and sell copies of the book himself, and pass the privilege on to his heirs, who enjoyed an exclusive right into perpetuity. If the privilege was sold to a publisher, the exclusive right would only last the specified duration. The royal decrees prohibited the renewal of privileges and once the privilege had expired anyone could obtain a &quot;permission simple&quot; to print or sell copies of the work. Hence the [[public domain]] in books whose privilege had expired was expressly recognized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter K 2007 141–142&quot;/&gt;

After the [[French Revolution]] a dispute over [[Comédie-Française]] being granted the exclusive right to the public performance of all dramatic works erupted and in 1791 the [[National Assembly]] abolished the privilege. Anyone was allowed to establish a public theater and the National Assembly declared that the works of any author who had died more than five years ago were [[public property]]. In the same degree the National Assembly granted authors the exclusive right to authorize the public performance of their works during their lifetime, and extended that right to the authors' heirs and assignees for five years after the author's death. The National Assembly took the view that a published work was by its nature a public property, and that an author's rights are recognized as an exception to this principle, to compensate an author for his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter K 2007 141–142&quot;/&gt;

In 1793 a new law was passed giving authors, composers, and artists the exclusive right to sell and distribute their works, and the right was extended to their heirs and assigns for 10 years after the author's death. The National Assembly placed this law firmly on a natural right footing, calling the law the &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Genius&quot; and so evoking the famous [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]. However, author's rights were subject to the condition of depositing copies of the work with the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] and 19th Century commentators characterized the 1793 law as [[utilitarian]] and &quot;a charitable grant from society&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter K 2007 141–142&quot;/&gt;

===Early US copyright law===
{{Main|United States copyright law}}
[[Image:Copyright Act of 1790 in Colombian Centinel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Copyright Act of 1790 in the ''[[Columbian Centinel]]'']]
The [[Statute of Anne]] did not apply to the American colonies. The colonies' economy was largely [[agrarian]], hence copyright law was not a priority, resulting in only three private copyright acts being passed in America prior to 1783. Two of the acts were limited to seven years, the other was limited to a term of five years. In 1783 several authors' petitions persuaded the [[Continental Congress]] &quot;that nothing is more properly a man's own than the fruit of his study, and that the protection and security of literary property would greatly tends to encourage genius and to promote useful discoveries.&quot; But under the [[Articles of Confederation]], the Continental Congress had no authority to issue copyright, instead it passed a resolution encouraging the States to &quot;secure to the authors or publishers of any new book not hitherto printed... the copy right of such books for a certain time not less than fourteen years from the first publication; and to secure to the said authors, if they shall survive the term first mentioned,... the copy right of such books for another term of time no less than fourteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Peter K| first = Yu| title = Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2007| page = 142| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=tgK9BzcF5WgC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780275988838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three states had already enacted copyright statutes in 1783 prior to the Continental Congress resolution, and in the subsequent three years all of the remaining states except [[Delaware]] passed a copyright statute. Seven of the States followed the [[Statute of Anne]] and the Continental Congress' resolution by providing two fourteen year terms. The five remaining States granted copyright for single terms of fourteen, twenty and twenty one years, with no right of renewal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter K 2007 143&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Peter K| first = Yu| title = Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2007| page = 143| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=tgK9BzcF5WgC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780275988838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Constitutional Convention 1787|Constitutional Convention of 1787]] both [[James Madison]] of Virginia and [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney|Charles Pinckney]] of [[South Carolina]] submitted proposals that would allow Congress the power to grant copyright for a limited time. These proposals are the origin of the [[Copyright Clause]] in the [[United States Constitution]], which allows the granting of copyright and [[patent]]s for a limited time to serve a [[utilitarian]] function, namely &quot;to promote the progress of science and useful arts&quot;. The first federal copyright act, the [[Copyright Act of 1790]] granted copyright for a term of &quot;fourteen years from the time of recording the title thereof&quot;, with a right of renewal for another fourteen years if the author survived to the end of the first term. The act covered not only books, but also maps and charts. With exception of the provision on maps and charts the Copyright Act of 1790 is copied almost verbatim from the [[Statute of Anne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter K 2007 143&quot;/&gt;

At the time works only received protection under federal statutory copyright if the statutory formalities, such as a proper [[copyright notice]], were satisfied. If this was not the case the work immediately entered into the [[public domain]]. In 1834 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in [[Wheaton v. Peters]], a case similar to the British [[Donaldson v Beckett]] of 1774, that although the author of an unpublished work had a [[common law copyright|common law right]] to control the first publication of that work, the author did not have a common law right to control reproduction following the first publication of the work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter K 2007 143&quot;/&gt;

===Latin America===

Latin American countries established national copyright laws following independence from the Spanish and Portuguese colonial powers. Latin American countries were among the first countries outside Europe to establish copyright law, with Brazil being the fourth country in the world to establish national copyright laws in 1804, after the UK, France and the United States. The foundation of Brazilian copyright law&lt;ref name=&quot;Brazilian Law Code&quot;&gt; {{Cite book| last = Penal Code| first = Brasilian| title =Brasilian Penal Code|url = http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil/leis/L9610.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[French Civil Code]]. Copyright law was initially established in Mexico following a Spanish court order in 1820 and in 1832 Mexico passed its first copyright statute. Copyright statutes had been established in eight Latin American countries by the 1850s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deere 2009 35&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Deere| first = Carolyn| title = The implementation game: the TRIPS agreement and the global politics of intellectual property reform in developing countries| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2009| page = 35| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ZI3jI-YaTI0C&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Carolyn+Deere%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xzeFTIGBDp6TOPGQ6MAO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA| isbn = 9780199550616 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa, Asia, and the Pacific===
Copyright law was introduced in African, Asian and Pacific countries in the late 19th Century by European colonial powers, especially Britain and France. After the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|1884 Congress of Berlin]] European colonial powers imposed new laws and institutions in their colonies, including copyright laws. The [[British Empire]] introduced copyright law in its African and Asian colonies though the [[Copyright Act 1911]], also known as the Imperial Copyright Act of 1911. Similarly France applied its copyright law throughout its colonies and the [[French National Institute for Intellectual Property]] (INPI) acted as the colonial [[intellectual property]] authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deere 2009 35&quot;/&gt; The introduction of copyright laws in colonies occurred in the context of colonial powers' desire to &quot;civilize&quot; their colonies and to protect the commercial interest of the colonial powers. While approaches varied, copyright laws were generally not adapted to fit local conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Deere| first = Carolyn| title = The implementation game: the TRIPS agreement and the global politics of intellectual property reform in developing countries| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2009| page = 36| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ZI3jI-YaTI0C&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Carolyn+Deere%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xzeFTIGBDp6TOPGQ6MAO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA| isbn = 9780199550616 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works===
{{Main|Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works}}
[[File:Berne Convention signatories.svg|thumb|350px|[[List of countries party to the Berne Convention|Berne Convention signatory countries]] (in blue).]]
The [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] was first established in 1886, and was subsequently re-negotiated in 1896 (Paris), 1908 (Berlin), 1928 (Rome), 1948 (Brussels), 1967 (Stockholm) and 1971 (Paris). The convention relates to literary and artistic works, which includes films, and the convention requires its member states to provide protection for every production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain. The Berne Convention has a number of core features, including the principle of ''national treatment'', which holds that each member state to the Convention would give citizens of other member states the same rights of copyright that it gave to its own citizens (Article 3-5).&lt;ref name=&quot;MacQueen 2007 37&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = MacQueen | first = Hector L | coauthors = Charlotte Waelde and Graeme T Laurie | title = Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2007 | page = 37 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=_Iwcn4pT0OoC&amp;dq=contemporary+intellectual+property&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 9780199263394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another core feature is the establishment of minimum standards of national copyright legislation in that each member state agrees to certain basic rules which their national laws must contain, though member states can if they wish increase the amount of protection given to copyright owners. One important minimum rule was that the [[copyright term|term of copyright]] was to be a minimum of the author's lifetime plus 50 years. Another important minimum rule established by the Berne Convention is that copyright arises with the creation of a work and does not depend upon any formality such as a system of public registration (Article 5(2)). At the time some countries did require registration of copyright, and when Britain implemented the Berne Convention in the [[Copyright Act 1911]] it had to abolish its system of registration at [[Stationers' Hall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MacQueen 2007 37&quot;/&gt;

The Berne Convention focuses on authors as the key figure in copyright law and the stated purpose of the convention is &quot;the protection of the rights of authors in their literary and artistic works&quot; (Article 1), rather than the protection of publishers and other actors in the process of disseminating works to the public. In the 1928 revision the concept of [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] was introduced (Article 10bis), giving authors the right to be identified as such and to object to derogatory treatment of their works. These rights, unlike economic rights such as preventing reproduction, are generally not transferrable to others.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacQueen 2007 37&quot;/&gt;

The Berne Convention also enshrined [[limitations and exceptions to copyright]], enabling the reproduction of literary and artistic works without the copyright owners prior permission. The detail of these exceptions was left to national copyright legislation, but the guiding principle is stated in Article 9 of the convention. The so called [[Berne three-step test|three-step test]] holds that an exception is only permitted &quot;in certain special cases, provided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author&quot;. Free use of copyrighted work is expressly permitted in the case of quotations from lawfully published works, illustration for teaching purposes, and news reporting (Article 10).&lt;ref name=&quot;MacQueen 2007 37&quot;/&gt;

===European copyright law===
In the 1980s the [[European Community]] started to regard copyright as an element in the creation of a [[single market]]. Since 1991 the EU has passed a number of [[Directive (European Union)|directives]] on copyright, designed to harmonize copyright laws in member states in certain key areas, such as computer programs, databases and the internet. The directives aimed to reduce obstacles to the free movement of goods and services within the European Union, such as for example in [[Public Lending Right|rental rights]], satellite broadcasting, [[copyright term]] and resale rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacQueen 2007 39&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = MacQueen | first = Hector L | coauthors = Charlotte Waelde and Graeme T Laurie | title = Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2007 | page = 39 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=_Iwcn4pT0OoC&amp;dq=contemporary+intellectual+property&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 9780199263394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key directives include the 1993 [[Copyright Duration Directive]], Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market ('Directive on electronic commerce' or [[E-Commerce Directive]]),the 2001 [[InfoSoc Directive]], also known as Copyright Directive, and the 2004 [[Directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights]].

===Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)===
{{Main|Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights}}
Important developments on copyright at international level in the 1990s include the 1994 [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]], known as the TRIPS Agreement. TRIPS was negotiated at the end of the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) and contains a number of provisions on copyright. Compliance with the TRIPS Agreement is required of states wishing to be members of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). States need to be signatory of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] and comply with all its provisions, except for the provision on moral rights (Article 9(1)). States need to bring [[computer programs]] and [[databases]] within the scope of works covered by copyright law (Article 10). States need to provide for [[Public Lending Right|rental rights]] in at least [[computer programs]] and [[films]] (Article 11). Where [[copyright term]], that is, duration of copyright, is calculated other than by reference to the life of a natural person, States need to give a minimum term of 50 years calculated from either the date of authorized publication or the creation of the work.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacQueen 2007 39&quot;/&gt;

===Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement===
{{Main|Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement}}
The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is a proposed [[Plurilateral agreement|plurilateral]] [[trade agreement]] which is claimed by its proponents to be in response &quot;to the increase in global trade of counterfeit goods and pirated copyright protected works.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/ContentTopicSummary____34357.aspx |title=Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement &amp;#124; Intellectual Property Enforcement &amp;#124; Intellectual Property Policy |publisher=Med.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of ACTA is broad, including [[counterfeit]] physical goods, as well as &quot;internet distribution and information technology&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;What is ACTA&quot; &gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.eff.org/issues/acta | title=What is ACTA?| publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) | accessdate=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007 the United States, the [[European Community]], Switzerland and Japan announced that they would negotiate ACTA. Furthermore the following countries have joined the negotiations: Australia, the [[Republic of Korea]], New Zealand, Mexico, [[Jordan]], [[Morocco]], [[Singapore]], the [[United Arab Emirates]] and Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;What is ACTA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=geiger&gt;{{Cite news| last=Geiger | first=Andrea | title=A View From Europe: The high price of counterfeiting, and getting real about enforcement | url=http://thehill.com/business--lobby/a-view-from-europe-the-high-price-of-counterfeiting-and-getting-real-about-enforcement-2008-04-30.html | publisher=The Hill | date=30 April 2008 | accessdate=27 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pilieci&gt;{{Cite news| last=Pilieci | first = Vito | title=Copyright deal could toughen rules governing info on iPods, computers | publisher=Vancouver Sun | date=26 May 2008 | accessdate=27 May 2008 | url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/story.html?id=ae997868-220b-4dae-bf4f-47f6fc96ce5e&amp;p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACTA negotiations have been largely conducted in secrecy, with very little information being officially disclosed.

==Copyright by country==
Copyright laws have been standardized to some extent through international conventions such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]]. Although there are consistencies among nations' [[intellectual property]] laws, each jurisdiction has separate and distinct laws and regulations about copyright.&lt;ref name=Broussard /&gt; The [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] summarizes each of its member states' intellectual property laws on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/about-ip/en/ipworldwide/country.htm WIPO Guide to Intellectual Property Worldwide]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obtaining copyright==
[[File:Copyright.svg|thumb|right|100px|© is the [[copyright symbol]] in a [[copyright notice]]]]
Copyright law is different from country to country, and a [[copyright notice]] is required in about 20 countries for a work to be protected under copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Fries| first = Richard C.| title = Reliable design of medical devices| publisher = CRC Press| year = 2006| page = 197| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=nO0yEZmE3ZkC&amp;dq=copyright+notices&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 0824723759, 9780824723750 |quote=In addition, copyright protection is not available in some 20 foreign countries unless a work contains a copyright notice.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1989, all published works in the US had to contain a copyright notice, the © symbol followed by the publication date and copyright owner's name, to be protected by copyright. This is no longer the case and use of a copyright notice is now optional in the US, though they are still used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Fries| first = Richard C.| title = Reliable design of medical devices| publisher = CRC Press| year = 2006| page = 196| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=nO0yEZmE3ZkC&amp;dq=copyright+notices&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 0824723759, 9780824723750 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all countries that are members of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]], copyright is automatic and need not be obtained through official registration with any government office. Once an idea has been reduced to tangible form, for example by securing it in a fixed medium (such as a drawing, sheet music, photograph, a videotape, or a computer file), the copyright holder, or '''rightsholder''', is entitled to enforce his or her exclusive rights. However, while registration isn't needed to exercise copyright, in jurisdictions where the laws provide for registration, it serves as ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence of a valid copyright. The original copyright owner of the copyright may be the ''employer'' of the author rather than the author himself, if the work is a &quot;[[work for hire]]&quot;.

In the United States, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 37 Section 202.1a prohibits copyright of a single word, title or small group of words or phrases, regardless of originality (Planesi v. Peters, 2005 WL 1939885 (9th Cir. 2005) No. 05-781 (SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES). In some circumstances these may be covered by [[trademark]]s.

==Copyright term==
{{anchor|Duration}}&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Little Nemo]] --&gt;
{{Main|Copyright term}}
{{See also|List of countries' copyright length}}
Copyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions. The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. [[musical composition]] or [[novel]]), whether the work has been published or not, and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is for a term ending 70 years after the death of the author. If the work was a work for hire (e.g., those created by a corporation) then copyright persists for 120 years after creation or 95 years after publication, whichever is shorter. In some countries (for example, the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|17|305}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom),&lt;ref&gt;The Duration of Copyright and Rights in Performances Regulations 1995, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19953297_en_3.htm part II], Amendments of the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt; copyrights expire at the end of the calendar year in question. Although proposed amendments may change the way that these laws are enforced. &lt;ref&gt; UK must modernise copyright laws, report urges, &lt;http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/intellectual-property/2011/05/18/uk-must-modernise-copyright-laws-report-urges-40092815/)&lt;/ref&gt;

The length and requirements for copyright duration are subject to change by legislation, and since the early 20th century there have been a number of adjustments made in various countries, which can make determining the duration of a given copyright somewhat difficult. For example, the United States used to require copyrights to be renewed after 28 years to stay in force, and formerly required a copyright notice upon first publication to gain coverage. In Italy and France, there were post-wartime extensions that could increase the term by approximately 6 years in Italy and up to about 14 in France. Many countries have extended the length of their copyright terms (sometimes retroactively). International treaties establish minimum terms for copyrights, but individual countries may enforce longer terms than those treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Exclusive rights granted by copyright==
Copyright is literally, the right to copy, though in legal terms &quot;the right to control copying&quot; is more accurate. Copyright are exclusive statutory rights to exercise control over copying and other exploitation of the works for a specific period of time. The copyright owner is given two sets of rights: an exclusive, positive right to copy and exploit the copyrighted work, or license others to do so, and a negative right to prevent anyone else from doing so without consent, with the possibility of legal remedies if they do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Jones| first = Hugh| coauthors = and Benson, Christopher| title = Publishing law| publisher = Routledge| year = 2002| pages = 12–13| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=CIsb4fsmJD8C&amp;dq=uk+copyright+law&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780415261548 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyright initially only granted the exclusive right to copy a book, allowing anybody to use the book to, for example, make a translation, adaptation or public performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter K 2007 346&quot;/&gt; At the time [[printing|print]] on [[paper]] was the only format in which most text based copyrighted works were distributed. Therefore, while the language of book contracts was typically very broad, the only exclusive rights that had any significant economic value were rights to distribute the work in print.&lt;ref name=&quot;google.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organization | issue= 897 of WIPO publication| year = 2004 | page = 17 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;dq=copyright+transfer+and+licensing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn =9789280512717}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusive rights granted by copyright law to copyright owners have been gradually expanded over time and now uses of the work such as dramatization, translations, and [[derivative works]] such as adaptations and transformations, fall within the scope of copyright.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter K 2007 346&quot;/&gt; With a few exceptions, the exclusive rights granted by copyright are strictly territorial in scope, as they are granted by copyright laws in different countries. Bilateral and multilateral treaties establish minimum exclusive rights in member states, meaning that there is some uniformity across Berne Convention member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organization | issue= 897 of WIPO publication| year = 2004 | page = 9 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;dq=copyright+transfer+and+licensing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn =9789280512717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The print on paper format means that content is affixed onto paper and the content can't be easily or conveniently manipulated by the user. Duplication of printed works is time-consuming and generally produces a copy that is of lower quality. Developments in technology have created new formats, in addition to paper, and new means of distribution. Particularly digital formats distributed over computer networks have separated the content from its means of delivery. Users of content are now able to exercise many of the exclusive rights granted to copyright owners, such as reproduction, distribution and adaptation.

==Types of work subject to copyright==
The types of work which are subject to copyright has been expanded over time. Initially only covering [[books]], copyright law was revised in the 19th century to include [[maps]], [[charts]], [[engravings]], [[printmaking|prints]], [[musical compositions]], [[drama|dramatic works]], [[photographs]], [[paintings]], [[drawings]] and [[sculptures]]. In the 20th century copyright was expanded to cover [[motion pictures]], [[computer programs]], [[sound recordings]], [[choreography]] and [[architecture|architectural works]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter K 2007 346&quot;/&gt;

==Idea–expression divide==
{{Main|Idea-expression divide}}

Copyright law is typically designed to protect the fixed expression or manifestation of an [[idea]] rather than the fundamental idea itself. Copyright does not protect ideas, only their expression and in the Anglo-American law tradition the [[idea-expression divide]] is a legal concept which explains the appropriate function of copyright laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Simon| first = Stokes| title = Art and copyright| publisher = Hart Publishing| year = 2001| pages = 48–49| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=h-XBqKIryaQC&amp;dq=idea-expression+dichotomy&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9781841132259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related rights and neighboring rights==
{{Main|Related rights}}

[[Related rights]] is used to describe [[database rights]], [[public lending rights]] (rental rights), [[droit de suite]] and [[performers' rights]]. Related rights may also refer to copyright in broadcasts and sound recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The way ahead&amp;nbsp;– A Strategy for Copyright in the Digital Age | publisher = Intellectual Property Office and Department for Business Innovation &amp; Skills |date = October 2009| page = 10  | url = http://www.ipo.gov.uk/c-strategy-digitalage.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related rights award copyright protection to works which are not author works, but rather technical media works which allowed author works to be communicated to a new audience in a different form. The substance of protection is usually not as great as there is for author works. In continental European copyright law, a system of ''neighboring rights'' has thus developed and the approach was reinforced by the creation of the [[Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = MacQueen | first = Hector L | coauthors = Charlotte Waelde and Graeme T Laurie | title = Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2007 | page = 38 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=_Iwcn4pT0OoC&amp;dq=contemporary+intellectual+property&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 9780199263394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First-sale doctrine and exhaustion of rights==
{{Main|First-sale doctrine|Exhaustion of rights}}
Copyright law does ''not'' restrict the owner of a copy from reselling legitimately obtained copies of copyrighted works, provided that those copies were originally produced by or with the permission of the copyright holder. It is therefore legal, for example, to resell a copyrighted book or [[compact disc|CD]]. In the United States, this is known as the [[first-sale doctrine]], and was established by the [[court]]s to clarify the legality of reselling books in second-hand [[bookstore]]s. Some countries may have [[parallel importation]] restrictions that allow the copyright holder to control the resale market. This may mean for example that a copy of a book that does not infringe copyright in the country where it was printed '''does''' infringe copyright in a country into which it is imported for retailing. The first-sale doctrine is known as [[exhaustion of rights]] in other countries and is a principle that also applies, though somewhat differently, to [[patent]] and [[trademark]] rights. It is important to note that the first-sale doctrine permits the transfer of the particular legitimate copy involved. It does not permit making or distributing additional copies.

==Limitations and exceptions==
{{Main|Limitations and exceptions to copyright}}

The expression &quot;'''limitations and exceptions'''&quot; refers to situations in which the [[exclusive right]]s granted to authors, or their assignees under [[copyright law]] do not apply or are limited for [[public interest]] reasons. They generally limit use of copyrighted material to certain cases that do not require permission from the rightsholders, such as for commentary, criticism, news reporting, research, teaching or scholarship, archiving, access by the visually impaired etc. They essentially create a limitation, or an exception to the  [[monopoly]] exclusive rights that are granted to the creator of a  copyright work by law. Copyright theory teaches that the balance between monopoly granted to the creator, and the exceptions to this monopoly are at the heart of creativity. i.e. Exclusive rights stimulate investment and the production of  creative works and simultaneously, exceptions to those rights create a balance that allows for the use of creative works to support innovation, creation, competition and the public interest.

Limitations and exceptions have a number of important [[public policy]] goals such as [[market failure]], [[freedom of speech]],&lt;ref&gt;P. Bernt Hugenholtz. ''Copyright And Freedom Of Expression In Europe''(2001) Published in: Rochelle Cooper Dreyfuss, Harry First and Diane Leenheer Zimmerman (eds.), ''Expanding the Boundaries of Intellectual Property'',  Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; education and equality of access (such as by the visually impaired.)

Some view &quot;limitations and exceptions&quot; as &quot;user rights&quot; - seeing user rights provide an essential balance to the rights of copyright owners. There is no consensus amongst copyright experts as to whether they are &quot;rights&quot; or not. See for example the National Research Council's [http://books.nap.edu/html/digital_dilemma/exec_summ.html#REF1 Digital Agenda Report, note 1]. The concept of user rights has also been recognized by courts, including the [[Canadian Supreme Court]] in [http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-scc/en/pub/2004/vol1/html/2004scr1_0339.html CCH Canadian Ltd v. Law Society of Upper Canada] (2004 SCC 13), which classed &quot;fair dealing&quot; as such a user right. These kinds of disagreements in [[philosophy]] are quite common in the [[philosophy of copyright]], where debates about jurisprudential reasoning tend to act as proxies for more substantial disagreements about good policy.

===Changing technology and limitations and exceptions===
The scope of copyright limitations and exceptions became a subject of significant controversy within various nations in the late 1990s and early 2000s, largely due to the impact of digital technology, the changes in national copyright legislations for compliance with [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|TRIPS]], and the enactment of [[anti-circumvention rules]] in response to the [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]]. Academics and defenders of copyright exceptions fear that technology, contract law undermining copyright law and copyright law not being amended, is reducing the scope of important exceptions and therefore harming creativity. This has resulted in a number of declarations on the importance of access to knowledge being important for creativity, such as the [[Adelphi Charter]] in 2005 and  at a European level in May 2010 a declaration entitled [[Copyright for Creativity]] - A Declaration for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.copyright4creativity.eu/bin/view/Main/PressRelease05May2010 |title=Copyright for Creativity.Broad coalition calls for European copyright to support digital creativity and innovation] 5 May 2010.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration was supported by industry, artist, education and consumer groups. The declaration states that &quot;While exclusive rights have been adapted and harmonized to meet the challenges of the knowledge economy, copyright’s exceptions are radically out of line with the needs of the modern information society. The lack of harmonisation of exceptions hinders the circulation of knowledge based goods and services across Europe. The lack of flexibility within the current European exceptions regime also prevents us from adapting to a constantly changing technological environment.&quot;

===International legal instruments and limitations and exceptions===
Limitations and exceptions are also the subject of significant regulation by global treaties. These treaties have [[harmonization|harmonized]] the exclusive rights which must be provided by copyright laws, and the [[Berne three-step test]] operates to constrain the kinds of copyright exceptions and limitations which individual nations can enact.  On the other hand, international copyright treaties place almost no ''requirements'' on national governments to provide exemptions from exclusive rights; a notable exception to this is Article 10(1) of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]], which guarantees a limited right to make quotations from copyrighted works. Because of the lack of balance in international treaties in October 2004, WIPO agreed to adopt a significant proposal offered by Argentina and Brazil, the &quot;Proposal for the Establishment of a Development Agenda for WIPO&quot;  also known simply as the &quot;Development Agenda&quot; - from the [[Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/ip/wipo/genevadeclaration.html |title=Consumer Project on Technology web site, '&amp;#39;Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization'&amp;#39; |publisher=Cptech.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal was well supported by developing countries. A number of civil society bodies have been working on a draft Access to Knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/a2k/ |title=Consumer Project on Technology web site, '&amp;#39;Access to Knowledge (A2K) |publisher=Cptech.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; or A2K, Treaty which they would like to see introduced.

===Fair use and fair dealing===
{{Main|Fair use|Fair dealing}}
Copyright does not prohibit all copying or replication. In the United States, the [[fair use]] doctrine, codified by the [[United States Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act of 1976]] as {{UnitedStatesCode|17|107}}, permits some copying and distribution without permission of the copyright holder or payment to same. The statute does not clearly define fair use, but instead gives four non-exclusive factors to consider in a fair use analysis. Those factors are:

# the purpose and character of the use;
# the nature of the copyrighted work;
# the amount and substantialness of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
# the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|17|107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom and many other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, a similar notion of fair dealing was established by the [[court]]s or through [[legislation]]. The concept is sometimes not well defined; however in Canada, private copying for personal use has been expressly permitted by statute since 1999. In Australia, the [[fair dealing]] exceptions under the ''Copyright Act 1968'' (Cth) are a limited set of circumstances under which copyrighted material can be legally copied or adapted without the copyright holder's consent. Fair dealing uses are research and study; review and critique; parody and satire; news reportage and the giving of professional advice (i.e. [[legal advice]]). Under current [[Law of Australia|Australian law]] it is still a breach of copyright to copy, reproduce or adapt copyright material for personal or private use without permission from the copyright owner. Other technical exemptions from infringement may also apply, such as the temporary reproduction of a work in machine readable form for a computer.

In the United States the AHRA ([[Audio Home Recording Act]] Codified in Section 10, 1992) prohibits action against consumers making noncommercial recordings of music, in return for royalties on both media and devices plus mandatory copy-control mechanisms on recorders.

:''Section 1008. Prohibition on certain infringement actions''

:''No action ever may be brought under this title alleging infringement of copyright based on the manufacture, importation, or distribution of a digital audio recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog recording device, or an analog recording medium, or based on the non-commercial use by a consumer of such a device or medium for making digital musical recordings or analog musical recordings.''

Later acts amended US Copyright law so that for certain purposes making 10 copies or more is construed to be commercial, but there is no general rule permitting such copying. Indeed making one complete copy of a work, or in many cases using a portion of it, for commercial purposes will not be considered fair use. The [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] prohibits the manufacture, importation, or distribution of devices whose intended use, or only significant commercial use, is to bypass an access or copy control put in place by a copyright owner. An appellate court has held that fair use is not a defense to engaging in such distribution.

Educational use is regarded as &quot;fair use&quot; in most jurisdictions, but the restrictions vary wildly from nation to nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teflpedia.com/index.php?title=Copyright_in_English_language_teaching |title=International comparison of Educational &quot;fair use&quot; legislation |publisher=Teflpedia.com |date=2010-12-19 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing, transfer, and assignment==
[[Image:All rights reserved.jpg|thumb|right|250px|DVD: [[All Rights Reserved]]]]
Copyright may be bought and sold much like other [[properties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organization | issue= 897 of WIPO publication| year = 2004 | page = 15 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;dq=copyright+transfer+and+licensing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn =9789280512717}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the individual licensing model the copyright owner authorizes the use of the work against remuneration and under the conditions specified by the license. The conditions of the license may be complex since the exclusive rights granted by copyright to the copyright owner can be split territorially or with respect to language, the sequence of uses may be fixed, the number of copies to be made and their subsequent use may also be specified. Furthermore sublicenses and representation agreements may also be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organization | issue= 897 of WIPO publication| year = 2004 | page = 100 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;dq=copyright+transfer+and+licensing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn =9789280512717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contractual transfer of all or some of the rights in a copyrighted work is a known as a copyright license. A copyright assignment is an immediate and irrevocable transfer of the copyright owner's entire interest in all or some of the rights in the copyrighted work. Copyright licensing and assignment cover only the specified geographical region. There are significant differences in national copyright laws with regards to copyright licensing and assignment.&lt;ref name=&quot;WIPO p7&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organization | issue= 897 of WIPO publication| year = 2004 | page = 7 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;dq=copyright+transfer+and+licensing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn =9789280512717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyright licenses, as a minimum, define the copyrighted works and rights subject to the license, the territories or geographic region in which the license applies, the term or length of the license, and the consideration (such as a one of payment or [[royalties]]) for the license. The exclusive rights granted by copyright law can all be licensed, but they vary depending on local law. Depending on how the work may be used different licenses need to be acquired. For example, the activity of distributing [[videocassettes]] of a [[motion picture]] will require the license for the right to reproduce the motion picture on a videocassette and the right to distribute the copies to the public. Because the ratio of a television screen is different from that of a wide-screen cinema, requiring the cutting of the wide-screen &quot;ends&quot;, it may also be necessary to obtain a license for the right to modify the motion picture. If the motion picture is to be edited or modified the copyright owner may include control over or approval of the editing process, or of the final result. Existing contractual agreements between the copyright owner and the director, may also require approval from the director to any changes made to the copyrighted work.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organization | issue= 897 of WIPO publication| year = 2004 | page = 8 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;dq=copyright+transfer+and+licensing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn =9789280512717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different types of exclusive licenses exist, such as licenses that excludes the licensor from use of the licensed copyrighted work in the relevant region and for the stated time period. Or exclusive licenses may prevent the licensor from licensing other parties in the geographic region and during the license term. There are also various types of non-exclusive licenses, including the right of first refusal should the licensor elect to offer future licenses to third parties. If a licensing agreement does not specify that the license is exclusive it may nonetheless be deemed exclusive depending on the language of the contract. Depending on local laws the owner of an exclusive license may be deemed the &quot;copyright owner&quot; of that work and bring charges for copyright infringement.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organization | issue= 897 of WIPO publication| year = 2004 | pages = 10–11 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;dq=copyright+transfer+and+licensing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn =9789280512717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term or length of the copyright license is not allowed to exceed the copyright term specified by local law. Licenses may establish various pay arrangements, such as royalties as a percentage of sales or as a stepped up or down percentage of sales, e.g. 5 percent of sales up to 50,000 units, 2.5 percent of sales in excess thereof. The trigger for royalty payments may be sales, or other factors, such as the number of &quot;hits&quot; or views on a [[website]]. Minimum royalty payments are arrangements whereby a minimum up-front payment is made and then recouped against the percentage of sales. The up-front payment may be non-refundable if sales royalties do not reach the amount of the payment.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Minimum royalty payment arrangements may be accompanied by [[marketing]] duties for the licensee, e.g. best effort and reasonable effort to market and promote the copyrighted work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organization | issue= 897 of WIPO publication| year = 2004 | page = 11 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;dq=copyright+transfer+and+licensing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn =9789280512717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collective rights management===
{{main|Collective rights management}}
Collective rights management is the licensing of copyright and related rights by organizations acting on behalf of rights owners. Collective management organizations, such as [[collecting societies]], typically represent groups of copyright and related rights owners, such as authors, composers, publishers, writers, photographers, musicians and performers.&lt;ref name=&quot;wipo.int&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Collective Management of Copyright and Related Rights| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organization| url = http://www.wipo.int/about-ip/en/about_collective_mngt.html#P46_4989| accessdate = 14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following exclusive rights granted under copyright law are commonly collectively managed by collecting societies: the right to public performance, the right to broadcasting, the mechanical reproduction rights in recorded music, the performing rights in dramatical works, the rights of reprographic reproduction of literary and musical works, and related rights, for example the rights of performers and producers in recorded music when used in broadcasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;wipo.int&quot;/&gt;

The collective management of copyright and related rights is undertaken by various types of collective management organizations, most commonly [[collecting societies]]. Collecting societies act on behalf of their members, which may be authors or performers, and issue copyright licenses to users authorizing the use of the works of their members.&lt;ref name=&quot;wipo.int&quot;/&gt; Other forms of collective management organizations include rights clearance centers and one-stop shops. One-stop shops are a coalition of collecting societies and rights clearance centers offering a centralized source for users to obtain licenses. They have become popular in response to multi-media productions requiring users to obtain multiple licenses for relevant copyright and related rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;wipo.int&quot;/&gt;

===Extended collective licensing===
{{main|extended collective licensing}}
The first extended collective licensing (ECL) laws were established in [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gervais 2006 264–265&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gervais| first = Daniel| title = Collective management of copyright and related rights| publisher = Kulwar Law International| date = 2006| pages =264–265 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=W_N0ctyT10wC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9789041123589}}&lt;/ref&gt; ECL is a form of [[collective rights management]] whereby ECL laws allow for freely negotiated copyright licensing contracts for the exclusive rights granted by copyright. ECL laws are designed specifically for mass use, where negotiating alone will rarely allow a single right owner to fully financially benefit from their exclusive rights. Under ECL laws, [[collecting societies]] negotiate ECL agreements with users, such as a TV broadcaster, covering the types of copyrighted works for uses specified in the ECL license.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gervais 2006 264–265&quot;/&gt;

Subject to certain conditions [[collecting societies]] can under ECL law apply to represent all rights owners on a non-exclusive basis in a specific category of copyrighted works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Gervais| first = Daniel | title = Application of an Extended Collective Licensing Regime in Canada: Principles and Issues Relating to Implementation| work = Study prepared for the Department of Canadian Heritage| publisher = University of Ottawa| date = June 2003| page=5| url = http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~dgervais/publications/extended_licensing.pdf| format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collecting society can then negotiate an ECL agreement with a user for certain uses. This agreement applies to members of that [[collecting society]], as well as non-members. ECL laws require that collecting societies treat rights owners who are non-members in the same way they treat their members. Non-members are also given the right to individual remuneration, i.e. royalty payment, by the collecting society, and the right to exclude their work from an ECL agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Olsson| first = Henry| title = The Extended Collective License As Applied in the Nordic Countries| work = Presentation at Kopinor 25th Anniversary International Symposium May 2005| publisher =  [[Kopinor]]| date = 10 March 2010  | url = http://www.kopinor.no/en/copyright/extended-collective-license/documents/The+Extended+Collective+License+as+Applied+in+the+Nordic+Countries.748.cms | accessdate = 14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compulsory licensing===
{{main|Compulsory license}}
In some countries copyright law provides for compulsory licenses of copyrighted works for specific uses. In many cases the remuneration or royalties received for a copyrighted work under compulsory license are specified by local law, but may also be subject to negotiation. Compulsory licensing may be established through negotiating licenses that provide terms within the parameters of the compulsory license.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organization | issue= 897 of WIPO publication| year = 2004 | page = 16 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;dq=copyright+transfer+and+licensing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn =9789280512717}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 11bis(2) and Article 13(1) of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] provide the legal basis for compulsory licenses. They state that member states are free to determine the conditions under which certain exclusive rights may be exercised in their national laws. They also provide for the minimum requirements to be set when compulsory licenses are applied, namely that they must not prejudice the author to fair compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organization | issue= 897 of WIPO publication| year = 2004 | page = 101 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;dq=copyright+transfer+and+licensing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn =9789280512717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future rights under pre-existing agreements===
It is commonplace in copyright licensing to license not only new uses which may be developed but also works which are not yet created. However, local law may not always recognize that the wording in licensing agreements does cover new uses permitted by subsequently developed technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;WIPO p7&quot;/&gt; Whether a license covers future, as yet unknown, technological developments is subject to frequent disputes. Litigation over the use of a licensed copyrighted work in a medium unknown when the license was agreed is common.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

==Enforcement==
Copyrights are generally enforced by the holder in a [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] court, but there are also criminal infringement statutes in some jurisdictions. While [[copyright registry|central registries]] are kept in some countries, which aid in proving claims of ownership, registering does not necessarily prove ownership, nor does the fact of copying (even without permission) necessarily [[legal proof|prove]] that copyright was infringed. Criminal sanctions are generally aimed at serious counterfeiting activity, but are now becoming more commonplace as copyright collectives such as the [[RIAA]] are increasingly targeting the [[file sharing]] domestic Internet user. (See: [[File sharing and the law]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Infringement==
{{Main|Copyright infringement}}
[[Image:Piracy is a crime - Unskippable Anti-Piracy track.png|thumb|An unskippable anti-piracy film included on movie DVDs equates [[copyright infringement]] with [[theft]].]]
Copyright infringement, or copyright violation, is the unauthorized use of works covered by copyright law, in a way that violates one of the copyright owner's [[exclusive right]]s, such as the right to reproduce or perform the copyrighted work, or to make [[derivative work]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

For [[electronic media|electronic]] and audio-visual media under copyright, unauthorized reproduction and distribution is also commonly referred to as [[piracy]]. An early reference to piracy in the context of copyright infringement was made by [[Daniel Defoe]] in 1703 when he said of his novel ''[[The True-Born Englishman]]'' &quot;Had I wrote it for the gain of the press, I should have been concerned at its being printed again and again by PIRATES, as they call them, and PARAGRAPHMEN: but if they do justice, and print it true, according to the copy, they are welcome to sell it for a penny, if they please: the pence, indeed, is the end of their works.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The life and times of Daniel De Foe: with remarks digressive and discursive. [http://books.google.com/books?id=kRhAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of labeling the act of infringement as &quot;piracy&quot; predates statutory copyright law. Prior to the [[Statute of Anne]] 1709, the [[Stationers' Company]] of London in 1557 received a [[Royal Charter]] giving the company a [[monopoly]] on publication and tasking it with enforcing the charter. Those who violated the charter were labeled pirates as early as 1603.&lt;ref&gt;T.

==Orphan works==
{{Main|Orphan works}}
An orphan work is a work under copyright protection whose copyright owner is difficult or impossible to contact. The creator may be unknown, or where the creator is known it is unknown who represents them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The work and operation of the Copyright Tribunal: second report of session 2007-08, report, together with formal minutes, oral and written evidence| publisher = Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Innovation, Universities &amp; Skills Committee| year = 2009| page = 28| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=kKw6n5kCFlkC&amp;dq=copyright+orphan+works&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780215514257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright as property right==
In the Anglo-American tradition copyright is understood as property, as distinguished from the [[droit d'auteur]] understanding of copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Deazley| first = Ronan| coauthors = Kretschmer, Martin &amp; Bently, Lionel| title = Privilege and Property: Essays on the History of Copyright| publisher = Open Book Publishers | date = 2010| page = 347| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=SRBkCOC8d-4C&amp;dq=copyright+Limitations+and+exceptions+history&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9781906924188 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain copyright was initially conceived of as a &quot;[[chose in action]]&quot;, that is an [[intangible property]], as opposed to [[tangible property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Coyle| first = Michael| title = The History of Copyright| publisher = Lawdit| date = 23 April 2002| url = http://www.lawdit.co.uk/reading_room/room/view_article.asp?name=../articles/The%20History%20of%20Copyright.htm|accessdate = 6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of tangible property the property rights are bundled with the ownership of the property, and property rights are transferred once the property is sold. In contrast copyright law detaches the exclusive rights granted under property law to the copyright owner from ownership of the good which is regarded as a reproduction. Hence the purchaser of a book buys ownership of the book as a good, but not the underlying copyright in the book's content. If a derivative work based on the content of the book is made, permission needs to be sought from the copyright owner, not all owners of a copy of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Laikwan| first = Pang| title = Cultural control and globalization in Asia: copyright, piracy, and cinema| publisher = Routledge| year = 2006| page = 32| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=a38gdoGOF-oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| isbn = 9780415352017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Statute of Anne]] specifically referred to copyright in terms of [[literary property]] that is limited in time. Many contemporaries did not believe that the statute was concerned with property &quot;in the strict sense of the word&quot; and the question of whether copyright is property right dates back to the [[Common law copyright#Battle of the booksellers|Battle of the Booksellers]]. In 1773 [[Lord Gardenston]] commented in Hinton v. Donaldson that &quot;the ordinary subjects of property are well known, and easily conceived... But property, when applied to ideas, or literary and intellectual compositions, is perfectly new and surprising...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Brad| first = Sherman| coauthors = Lionel Bently| title = The making of modern intellectual property law: the British experience, 1760-1911| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 1999| page = 19| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=u2aMRA-eF1gC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780521563635 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the 19th century that the term ''[[intellectual property]]'' began to be used as an umbrella term for [[patents]], copyright and other laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brad 1999 207&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Brad| first = Sherman| coauthors = Lionel Bently| title = The making of modern intellectual property law: the British experience, 1760-1911| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 1999| page = 207| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=u2aMRA-eF1gC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780521563635 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lemley 2005&quot;&gt;&quot; property as a common descriptor of the field probably traces to the foundation of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) by the United Nations.&quot; in Mark A. Lemley, [http://www.utexas.edu/law/journals/tlr/abstracts/83/83Lemley.pdf ''Property, Intellectual Property, and Free Riding''], Texas Law Review, 2005, Vol. 83:1031, page 1033, footnote 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of copyright and [[copyright term]] are mirrored in the rhetoric that has been employed in referring to copyright. Courts, when strengthening copyright, have characterized it as a type of [[property]]. Companies have strongly emphasized copyright as property, with leaders in the music and movie industries seeking to &quot;protect private property from being pillaged&quot; and making forceful assertions that copyright is absolute property right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Peter K| first = Yu| title = Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2007| pages = 345–346| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=tgK9BzcF5WgC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780275988838}}&lt;/ref&gt; With reference to the expanding scope of copyright, one commentator noted that &quot;We have gone from a regime where a tiny part of creative content was controlled to a regime where most of the most useful and valuable creative content is controlled for every significant use.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter K 2007 346&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Peter K| first = Yu| title = Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2007| page = 346| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=tgK9BzcF5WgC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780275988838}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Graham Dutfield and Uma Suthersanen copyright is now a &quot;class of intangible business assets&quot;, mostly owned by companies who function as &quot;investor, employer, distributor and marketer&quot;.

==Copyright and authors==
Copyright law emerged in 18th Century Europe in relation to printed books and a new notion of ''authorship''. In the European [[Renaissance]] and [[Neoclassical]] period the writer was regarded as an instrument, not as an independent creator. The writer was seen as using external sources to create a work of inspiration. In the 18th Century a changing concept of ''genius'' located the source of inspiration within the writer, whose special talents and giftedness was the basis for creating works of inspiration and uniqueness. The concept of the ''[[author]]'' as original creator and owner of their work emerged partly from the new concept of ''[[property rights]]'' and [[John Locke]]'s theory that individuals were &quot;owners of themselves&quot;. According to Locke individuals invested their labour into natural goods, and so creating property. Authors were argued to be the owners of their work because they had invested their labour in creating it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Van Horn Melton| first = James| title = The rise of the public in Enlightenment Europe| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2001| page =140| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=QZovusQ1SjYC&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =9780521469692}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Patterson and Livingston there remains confusion about the nature of copyright ever since [[Donaldson v Beckett]], a case heard in 1774 by the British House of Lords about whether copyright is the natural law right of the author or the statutory grant of a limited [[monopoly]]. One theory holds that copyright's origin occurs at the creation of a work, the other that its origin exists only through the copyright statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Jonathan| first = Rosenoer| title = Cyberlaw: the law of the internet| publisher = Springer| year = 1997| pages = 34–35| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=HlG2esMIm7kC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780387948324 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright and competition law==
Copyright is typically thought of as a limited, legally sanctioned [[monopoly]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WIPO p7&quot;/&gt; Because of this, copyright licensing may sometimes interfere too much in free and competitive markets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Port&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = Licensing Intellectual Property in the Information Age | author=Kenneth L. Port | publisher=Carolina Academic Press | edition=2nd | year=2005 | pages=425–566 | isbn=0-89089-890-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These concerns are governed by legal doctrines such as [[competition law]] in the [[European Union]], [[United States antitrust law|anti-trust law]] in the United States, and anti-monopoly law in [[Russian competition law|Russia]] and [[Japanese competition law|Japan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Port&quot; /&gt; Competition issues may arise when the licensing party unfairly leverages market power, engages in [[price discrimination]] through its licensing terms, or otherwise uses a licensing agreement in a discriminatory or unfair manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;WIPO p7&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Port&quot; /&gt; Attempts to extend the [[copyright term]] granted by law&amp;nbsp;– for example, by collecting [[royalties]] for use of the work after its copyright term has expired and it has passed into the [[public domain]]&amp;nbsp;– raise such competition concerns.&lt;ref name=&quot;WIPO p7&quot;/&gt; In April 1995, the US published &quot;Antitrust Guidelines for the licensing of Intellectual Property&quot; which apply to [[patents]], copyright, and [[trade secrets]]. In January 1996, the [[European Union]] published Commission Regulation No.240/96 which applies to patents, copyright, and other intellectual property rights, especially regarding licenses. The guidelines apply ''[[mutatis mutandis]]'' to the extent possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights| publisher = World Intellectual Property Organization | issue= 897 of WIPO publication| year = 2004 | page = 78 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&amp;dq=copyright+transfer+and+licensing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn =9789280512717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright and contract==
In all but a few countries, private contracts can override the limitations and exceptions provided in copyright law.&lt;ref name=&quot;ipo.gov.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipresearch-coprightworkshop-201003.pdf|date=October 2010|title=The Relationship Between Copyright Law and Contract Law }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright and economic development==
The view that a restrictive copyright benefits anybody has been challenged. According to the historian Eckhard Höffner the 1710 introduction of copyright law in England (and later in France) acted as a barrier to economic progress for over a century, a situation he contrasts with Germany where authors were paid by page and their work was not protected by any copyright laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cippm.org.uk/downloads/Symposium%202009/Hoffner%20-%20vortrag_eng-10_min.pdf Comparison of historical copyright situtaion in Britain and Germany]&lt;/ref&gt; Höffner argues that copyright laws allowed British publishers to print books only in limited quantities for high prices, while in Germany a proliferation of publishing took place that benefitted authors, publishers, and the public, and may have been an important factor in Germany's economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,710976,00.html |title=Der Spiegel 18 August 2010 article: No Copyright Law |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Geschichte und Wesen des Urheberrechts'' (History and nature of copyright) by Eckhard Höffner, July 2010 (in German) ISBN 3-930893-16-9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catalan''' ({{IPA-en|kætəˈlæn}}, {{IPA-en|ˈkætəlæn|}}, {{IPA-en|ˈkætələn|}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Catalan Catalan] Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. (accessed: March 20, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Catalan: '''''català''''' {{IPA-ca|kətəˈɫa|}} or {{IPA-ca|kataˈla|}}) is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]], the [[national language|national]] and the only [[official language]] of [[Andorra]], and a [[official language|co-official language]] in the [[Autonomous Communities of Spain|Spanish autonomous communities]] of [[Catalonia]], the [[Balearic Islands]] and [[Valencian Community]], where it is known as '''[[Valencian]]''' ('''''valencià''''' {{IPA-ca|valensiˈa|}}), as well as in the [[city]] of [[Alghero]] on the [[Italy|Italian]] [[List of islands in the Mediterranean|island]] of [[Sardinia]]. It is also spoken, with no official recognition, in the [[Autonomous Communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] of [[Aragon]] (in [[La Franja]]) and [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] (in [[Carche]]) in [[Spain]], and in the historic [[Roussillon]] region of southern [[France]], roughly equivalent to the current ''[[Departments of France|département]]'' of the [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] ([[Northern Catalonia]]).

Although recognized as a regional language of the department [[Pyrénées-Orientales]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Charte en faveur du Catalan&quot;/&gt; since 2007, Catalan has no official recognition in France, as French is the only official language of that country, according to the [[French Constitution|French Constitution of 1958]].&lt;ref&gt;French Constitution, 1958: Article 2. The language of the Republic shall be French.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Middle Ages: origin===
The Catalan language developed from [[Vulgar Latin]] on both sides of the eastern end of the [[Pyrenees]] mountains (counties of [[Roussillon|Rosselló]], [[Empúries]], [[Besalú]], [[Cerdanya]], [[Urgell]], [[Pallars]] and [[Ribagorça]]). It shares origin and features with [[Gallo-Romance]], [[Ibero-Romance]], and the [[Gallo-Italian]] speech types of Northern Italy. Though some hypothesize a historical split from languages of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] typology, the area from Liguria on the present Italian coast to Alicante in Spain can be viewed as a classic [[dialect continuum]], with some perturbation as a result of political divisions and overlay of standard national languages.

As a consequence of the Aragonese and Catalan [[Reconquista|conquests from Al-Andalus]] to the south and to the west, it spread to present-day [[Catalonia]], the [[Balearic Islands]] and most of the [[Valencian Community]].

In the 15th century, during the [[:ca:Segle d'or valencià|Valencian Golden Age]], Catalan literature reached its apex, which was not matched again until [[Renaixença|La Renaixença]], 4 centuries later.

===18th century to the present: France===
{{See also|Language policy in France|La Vergonha}}

After the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], a [[royal decree]] by [[Louis XIV of France]] on 2 April 1700, prohibited the use of Catalan language in present-day [[Northern Catalonia]] in all official documents under the threat of being invalidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.crdp-montpellier.fr/cd66/artscult/fichesVauban/cdvauban/PERIODES/moyenagetempsmodernes/chateaucollioureinterdictioncatalan.pdf |title=''L'interdiction de la langue catalane en Roussillon par Louis XIV'' |publisher= &quot;CRDP, Académie de Montpellier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Right after the Kingdom of France, the centralized [[French Republic]] banned and enacted discriminating policies against the nonstandard languages of France (''[[patois]]''); as Catalan, Occitan or Basque.

The deliberate process of eradicating non-French [[vernacular]]s in modern France and disparaging them as mere local and often strictly oral dialects was formalized with [[Abbé Grégoire]]'s ''Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalise the use of the French language'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.languefrancaise.net/dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=66 Abbé Grégoire's ''Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalize the use of the French language'']&lt;/ref&gt; which he presented on June 4, 1794 to the [[National Convention]]; thereafter, all languages other than French were officially banned in the administration and schools for the sake of [[linguistics|linguistically]] uniting post-[[Bastille Day]] France.

Up to this day, the French Republic does not recognize other official languages besides French. Nevertheless, on 10 December 2007, the [[General Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales]] officially recognized Catalan as one of the languages of the department in the Article 1 (a) of its ''Charte en faveur du Catalan''&lt;ref name=&quot;Charte en faveur du Catalan&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cg66.fr/202-charte-en-faveur-du-catalan.htm|title=''Charte en faveur du Catalan''}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.cg66.fr/199-la-catalanitat-a-catalunya-nord.htm |title=''La catalanitat a la Catalunya Nord''}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.cg66.fr/culture/patrimoine_catalanite/catalanite/charte.html |title=''Catalanité'' |publisher=cg66.fr |date=2004-07-28 |accessdate=2010-05-16}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seek to further promote it in public life and education.

===18th century to the present: Spain===
{{See also|Language politics in Spain under Franco}}

After the [[Nueva Planta Decrees]], administrative use of and education in Catalan was also banned in the territories of the [[Kingdom of Spain]]. It was not until the [[Renaixença]] that use of the Catalan language started to recover.

In [[Francoist Spain]] (1939&amp;ndash;1975), the use of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in place of Catalan was promoted, and public use of Catalan was discouraged by official propaganda campaigns. The use of Catalan in government-run institutions and in public events was banned. During later stages of the Francoist regime, certain folkloric or religious celebrations in Catalan were resumed and tolerated. Use of Catalan in the [[mass media]] was initially forbidden, but was permitted from the early 1950s&lt;ref&gt;Marc Howard Ross, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Oe4popSDfW0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en#PPA139,M1 Cultural Contestation in Ethnic Conflict], page 139. Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in the theatre. Publishing in Catalan continued throughout the dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Thomas |first=Earl W. |year=1962 |pages=43-8 |title= The Resurgence of Catalan |journal=Hispania (vol. 45, March No. 1)|DOI=10.2307/337523}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no official prohibition of speaking Catalan in public or in commerce, but all advertising and signage had to be in Spanish alone, as did all written communication in business.&lt;ref&gt;Order from the Excmo. Sr. Gobernador Civil of Barcelona. ''EL USO DEL IDIOMA NACIONAL EN TODOS LOS SERVICIOS PÚBLICOS''. 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of [[Franco]] in 1975 and the restoration of democracy, the use of Catalan increased significantly because of new affirmative action and subsidy policies and the Catalan language is now used in politics, education and the media, including the newspapers ''[[Avui]]'' (&quot;Today&quot;), ''El Punt'' (&quot;The Point&quot;), ''[[Ara (newspaper)|Ara]]'' (&quot;Now&quot;), ''[[La Vanguardia]]'' and ''[[El Periódico de Catalunya]]'' (sharing content with ''[[El Periòdic d'Andorra]]'', printed in [[Andorra]]); and the [[television]] channels of ''Televisió de Catalunya'' (TVC): [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]], the main channel, and [[Canal 33]] (culture channel), [[Canal Super3|Super3]]/[[3XL]] (cartoons channel) as well as a 24-hour news channel [[3/24]] and the sports channel [[Esport 3]]; in Valencia [[Canal 9]], [[24/9]] and [[Punt 2]]; in the Balearic islands [[IB3]]; in Catalonia there are also some private channels such as [[8TV (Catalonia)|8TV]] and [[Barça TV]]. There are also many local channels available in region in Catalan.

==Classification==
The ascription of Catalan to the [[Occitano-Romance languages|Occitano-Romance]] branch of [[Gallo-Romance languages]] is not shared by all linguists, particularly those from Spanish-speaking areas; furthermore, many modern linguists consider any internal classification of the Romance languages a pointless task. According to [[Pierre Bec]], its specific classification is as follows:

*[[Indo-European languages]]
**[[Italic languages]]
***[[Romance languages]]
****[[Italo-Western languages]]
*****[[Western Italo-Western languages]]
******[[Gallo-Romance]]
*******[[Occitano-Romance]]
********Catalan language

Catalan bears varying degrees of similarity to the linguistic varieties subsumed under the cover term ''[[Occitan language]]''. (See also [[Occitan#Differences between Occitan and Catalan|Differences between Occitan and Catalan]] and [[Gallo-Romance languages]]).
Thus, as it should be expected from closely related languages, Catalan today shares many traits with other Romance languages.

==Features==
As a member of the [[Dialect_continuum#Romance_languages|dialect continuum of Romance languages]], Catalan evinces linguistic features similar to those of its closest neighbors ([[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]). The following features represent in some cases unique changes in the evolution of Catalan from [[Vulgar Latin]]; other features are common in other Romance-speaking areas.

===Vowel system===
*Common features with [[Gallo-Romance]]:
** Loss of final unstressed vowels except -{{sm|a}} ({{sm|mūrvs}} 'wall' → ''mur'', {{sm|flos}}/{{sm|flōris}} 'flower' → ''flor''); cf. the maintenance of all final vowels except -{{sm|is}} and -{{sm|e}} in [[Ibero-Romance]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]/[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''muro'' but ''flor''); Italo-Romance maintains all final vowels ([[Italian language|Italian]] ''muro'', ''fiore'').
*Common features with [[Occitan language|Occitan]]:
** Richness of diphthongs and monosyllabic words: {{IPA|[aj]}} ''mai'' ('never'), {{IPA|[ej]}} ''rei'' ('king'), {{IPA|[aw]}} ''cau'' ('s/he falls'), {{IPA|[ew]}} ''beu'' ('s/he drinks'), {{IPA|[ow]}} ''pou'' ('a well'), etc.
[[Image:Homilies d'Organya.jpg|thumb|200px|Homilies d'Organyà: First manuscript in Catalan]]

*Distinguishing features from [[Gallo-Romance]]:
** Preservation of Latin -{{sm|ū}}- as {{IPA|[u]}} ({{sm|lūna}} 'moon' → ''lluna'' {{IPA|[ˈʎunə]}} or {{IPA|[ˈʎuna/ɛ]}}, Occitan ''luna'' {{IPA|[ˈlynɔ]}}, French ''lune'' {{IPA|[lyn]}}).
*Features that distinguish Catalan from [[Spanish language|Spanish]]:
** Maintenance of [[Vulgar Latin]] stressed -{{sm|e}}- and -{{sm|o}}- (short ‹ĕ› and ‹ŏ›), {{IPA|[ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}} respectively ({{sm|terra}} 'land' → ''terra'' {{IPA|[ˈtɛrə]}} or {{IPA|[ˈtɛra/ɛ]}}, {{sm|focvs}} 'fire'→ ''foc'' {{IPA|[ˈfɔk]}}); cf. Spanish diphthongs in ''tierra'' {{IPA|[ˈtjera]}}, ''fuego'' {{IPA|[ˈfweɣo]}}.
*Distinguishing features from [[Occitan language|Occitan]] (generally):
** Diphthong -{{sm|av}}- reduced to open {{IPA|[ɔ]}} ({{sm|cavlis}} 'cabbage' → ''col'', {{sm|pavcvs}} 'not much' → ''poc'').
*Features shared with other Western Romance (Southern Lengadocian, [[Ibero-Romance]]):
** The group -{{sm|act}}- becomes -''et''- ({{sm|lactis}} 'milk' → ''lleyt''* or ''lleit''* → ''llet'', {{sm|factvs}} 'done, fact' → ''feyt''* → ''fet'').

===Consonant system===
*Feature shared with Western Romance (particularly [[Ibero-Romance]]):
** [[Consonant voicing and devoicing|Voicing]] (and [[lenition]]) of intervocalic -{{sm|p}}-, -{{sm|t}}-, -{{sm|c}}- into -''b''-, -''d''-, -''g''- ({{sm|capra}} 'goat' → ''cabra'', {{sm|catēna}} 'chain' → ''cadena'', {{sm|secūrvs}} 'safe' → ''segur'').
*Features shared with Gallo-Romance:
**Preservation of initial {{sm|pl}}-, {{sm|cl}}-, {{sm|fl}}- ({{sm|plicāre}} 'fold' → ''aplegar'' 'to reach', {{sm|clavis}} 'key' → ''clau'', {{sm|flamma}} 'flame' → ''flama''); cf. palatalization of these initial clusters in Spanish ''llegar'', ''llave'', ''llama'' [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''chegar'', ''chave'', ''chama''. In the Italo-Romance group this slenderisation generally replaces the second consonant with -''i''- {{IPA|[j]}}; hence Italian ''piegare'', ''chiave'', ''fiamma''.
*Features shared with Occitan (specifically [[Languedocien]]):
** Loss of word-final (originally intervocalic) -{{sm|n}}: {{sm|panis}} ('bread') → ''pa'', {{sm|vinvm}} ('wine') → ''vi''. Unlike in Languedoc and Northern Catalan, plural forms conserve this {{IPA|[n]}}: ''pans'', ''vins''.
** Voiced obstruents undergo [[final obstruent devoicing]]: {{sm|frigidvs}} ('cold') → ''fred'' {{IPA|[ˈfɾɛt]}} or {{IPA|[ˈfɾet]}}. However, final voiceless consonants are voiced before vowels and voiced consonants ([[Assimilation (linguistics)|regressive voicing assimilation]]): ''els homes'' 'the men' {{IPA|[əɫs] + [ˈɔməs] &amp;rarr; [əɫˈzɔməs]}}; ''peix bo'' 'good fish' {{IPA|[ˈpe(j)ʃ] + [ˈbɔ] &amp;rarr; [ˈpe(j)ʒˈβɔ]}}.
*Catalan shows a rare evolution of an early {{IPA|[ts]}} (from Latin -{{sm|d}}-, and -{{sm|c}}- when followed by a front vowel {{sm|e}} or {{sm|i}}, or from the second-person plural verb ending -{{sm|tis}}) to -''u'' {{IPA|[w]}}:
** {{sm|pes}}/{{sm|pedis}} ('foot') → ''peu''
** {{sm|crux}}/{{sm|crvcis}} ('cross') → ''creu'', {{sm|credit}} ('he believes') → ''(ell) creu''
** Verbs in second-person plural ending in -{{sm|tis}}: {{sm|mirātis}} → ''miratz''* → ''mirau'' → ''mireu''/''mirau'' ('you look' [[grammatical number|pl.]]).
*Consonantal palatalisations common to many modern Romance languages, resulting from the combination of a consonant plus [[yod]] (palatal approximant) from a variety of sources:
**{{IPA|/k/ + [[yod]]}} → {{IPA|[ts]*}} → {{IPA|[s]}}: {{sm|caelvm}} ('sky, heaven') → ''cel'' {{IPA|[ˈsɛɫ]}}.
**{{IPA|/ɡ/ + [[yod]]}} → {{IPA|[dʒ]*}} → {{IPA|[ʒ] or [dʒ]}}: {{sm|gelvm}} ('ice') → ''gel'' {{IPA|[ˈʒɛɫ] or [ˈdʒɛɫ]}}.
**{{IPA|/j/}} → {{IPA|[dʒ]*}} → {{IPA|[ʒ] or [dʒ]}}: {{sm|iactāre}} ('lay down') → ''gitar'' {{IPA|[ʒiˈta] or [dʒiˈta(ɾ)]}}.
**Intervocalic {{IPA|/l/ + [[yod]]}} (-{{sm|li}}-, -{{sm|le}}-), -{{sm|ll}}-, -{{sm|cvl}}-, and -{{sm|tvl}}- → ''ll'' {{IPA|[ʎ]}}: {{sm|mvliēris}} ('wife') → ''muller'', {{sm|caballvs}} ('horse') → ''cavall'', {{sm|avricvla}} ('ear') → ''oric'la''* → ''orella'', {{sm|vetvlvs}} ('old') → ''vec'lus''* → ''{{sic|hide=y|vell}}''. In other cases like {{sm|villa}} ('villa') [[gemination]] has been simplified: ''vila'' ('town').
**Intervocalic {{IPA|n + [[yod]]}} (-{{sm|ni}}-, -{{sm|ne}}-), -{{sm|gn}}-, and -{{sm|nn}}- → ''ny'' {{IPA|[ɲ]}}: {{sm|ligna}} ('firewood') → ''llenya'', {{sm|ānnvs}} ('year') → ''any'' (cf. Spanish ''año'').
*Less common among Romance languages, but attested elsewhere:
** [[Palatalization]] of initial {{sm|l}}- ({{sm|lūna}} 'moon' → ''lluna'', {{sm|lvpvs}} 'wolf' → ''llop''). This feature can be found as well in the [[Foix]] dialect of Occitan and in [[Astur-Leonese]].
** Palatalization of -{{sm|x}}- {{IPA|/ks/}} and -{{sm|sc}}- {{IPA|/sk/}} to {{IPA|[(j)ʃ]}} ({{sm|coxa}} 'thigh' → ''cuixa'', {{sm|piscis}} 'fish' → ''peix''). Verbs of the third conjugation (-{{sm|īre}}) that took what was originally an [[inchoative verb|inchoative infix]] (-{{sm|ēsc}}-/-{{sm|īsc}}-) show this palatalization: {{sm|servēscit}} 'serves' (present tense, 3rd person singular indicative) → ''serveix/servix''.
*Other innovations can also be found in other Romance languages:
** Reduction of consonant clusters -{{sm|mb}}-, -{{sm|nd}}- to -''m''-, -''n''- respectively ({{sm|camba}} 'leg' → ''cama'', {{sm|mandāre}} 'to send, to lead' → ''manar''). Also found in [[Gascon language|Gascon]] and southern [[Languedoc]].
** Presence of double consonants: {{sm|septimāna}} ('week') → ''setmana'' {{IPA|[səmˈmanə]}}, {{sm|cvtina}} from {{sm|cvtis}} ('skin') → ''cotna'' {{IPA|[ˈkonːə]}} ('pork rind'), {{sm|modvlvs}} ('mold') → ''motlle''/''motle'' {{IPA|[ˈmɔʎːə]/[ˈmɔlːe]}} ('mold, a spring'), {{sm|athlēta}} ('athlete') → ''atleta'' {{IPA|[əɫˈɫɛtə]}}, {{sm|intelligens}} ('intelligent') → ''intel·ligent'' {{IPA|[intəɫːiˈʒen(t)]}}. Also found in [[Italian language|Italian]].

===Morphology===
* The definite [[article (grammar)|article]]s ''el'', ''la'', ''els'', ''les'' derive from Latin demonstratives {{sm|ille}}, {{sm|illa}}. The older forms ''lo'' ([[grammatical gender|m.]] [[grammatical number|s.]]) and ''los'' ([[grammatical gender|m.]] [[grammatical number|pl.]]) are still common nowadays in some western dialects and in [[Algherese]]. Several varieties of the Catalan language ([[Balearic Islands]], [[Costa Brava]], and [[Tàrbena]]) have maintained an article called ''[[:ca:article salat|salat]]'' (&lt; Latin {{sm|ipse}}, {{sm|ipsa}} →  ''es'', ''sa''), probably formed before the variants of {{sm|ille}} developed. Singular articles are elided before vowel-initial words, in speech and writing: ''el'' + ''home'' &gt; ''l'home'' 'the man', ''la'' + ''hora'' &gt; ''l'hora'' 'the time'.
* [[Possessive adjectives]] are formed with the definite article (''el meu gos'' 'my dog') like in Italian (''il mio cane''), Portuguese (''o meu cão'') and in many Occitan dialects (Languedocien and Pyrenean Gascon). Weak forms of possessive adjectives (''mon, ma, mos, mes,'' etc.) are fossilized for certain usages, as close familiar relatives or in order to express a high degree of affection (for instance: ''mon pare'' 'my dad', ''ma mare'' 'my mum'; in Valencian ''ma casa'' 'my home', ''ma vida'' 'my life'). Also note the postposition of the possessive to express particular nuances, e.g. ''casa meva'' ('my home', literally 'a house of mine') as different from ''la meva casa'' ('my house').
*Plurals are formed in a number of ways:
** ''-a'' becomes -''es''  (e.g. ''casa'' 'house' &gt; ''cas&lt;u&gt;es&lt;/u&gt;'').
**Most consonant- and vowel-final words (except -''a'') add -''s'': ''noi'' 'boy' &gt; ''noi&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;'', ''detall'' 'detail' &gt; ''detall&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;''
**Words ending in sibilants (-''s'', -''ç'', -''x'', -''ig'') form plurals with -''os'': ''gos'' 'dog' &gt; ''goss&lt;u&gt;os&lt;/u&gt;'', ''peix'' 'fish' &gt; ''peix&lt;u&gt;os&lt;/u&gt;''. Some plural words with -''ig'' may alternate forming plural by adding -''os'' or a silent -''s'': ''raig'' 'ray' &gt; ''raj&lt;u&gt;os&lt;/u&gt;''/''raig&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;''.
**Words ending in sibilant clusters (-''sc'', -''st'', -''xt'') may form plurals by adding -''os'' or -''s'': ''bosc'' 'forest' &gt; ''bosc&lt;u&gt;os&lt;/u&gt;''/''bosc&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;'', ''aquest'' 'this' &gt; ''aquest&lt;u&gt;os&lt;/u&gt;''/''aquest&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;''.
**Words ending in a stressed vowel often take -''ns'': ''pi'' 'pine' &gt; ''pi&lt;u&gt;ns&lt;/u&gt;'', ''cinturó'' 'belt' &gt; ''cinturo&lt;u&gt;ns&lt;/u&gt;'' (but ''esquí'' 'ski' &gt; ''esquís'', ''tabú'' 'taboo' &gt; ''tabús''). In Western Catalan dialects, some particular words ending in unstressed vowels may also form plural by adding -''ns'': ''home'' 'man' &gt; ''hòme&lt;u&gt;ns&lt;/u&gt;'' (from Latin {{sm|homo}} &gt; {{sm|homini}}).
* Partitive: While Catalan patterns with Ibero-Romance in the lack of a partitive article (e.g. ''vull pa'' 'I want some bread', cf. Spanish ''quiero pan'' but French ''je veux du pain''), it does have a partitive pronoun, like in Gallo-Romance languages: ''jo &lt;u&gt;en&lt;/u&gt; tinc tres'' 'I have three of them' (Spanish ''tengo tres'' but French ''j'en ai trois'').
* The construction used to express [[Grammatical aspect|punctual/perfective aspect]] in the past tense is one of the most distinctive features of Catalan. It is a periphrasis formed with a special conjugation of ''anar'' ('to go'), that comes from the Latin verb {{sm|vadere}}, plus the infinitive form of the main verb. For example: ''jo &lt;u&gt;vaig&lt;/u&gt; dir'' ('I said'). This construction has almost completely replaced the historical simple past form (''jo diguí''), which corresponds to the Spanish preterit or French passé simple.

===Lexicon===
The basic vocabulary shows more affinities with the Gallo-Romance group than with Ibero-Romance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Wheeler |first=Max H. |year=2006 |title=Catalan, in the [[Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Colón |first=Germà |year=1993 |title=El lèxic català dins la Romània |collection=Biblioteca Lingüística Catalana |publisher=Universitat de València |place=Valencia |isbn=84-370-1327-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These similarities are most notable with Occitan (examples below are from Languedocian).

* {{sm|fenestra}} &gt; ''finestra'' 'window' ([[Occitan language|Oc.]] ''fenèstra/finèstra'', [[french language|Fr.]] ''fenêtre'', [[Italian language|It.]] ''finestra'') vs {{sm|ventvs}} &gt; ''ventana'' ([[Spanish language|Sp.]]), ''janela'' ([[Portuguese language|Pt.]])
* {{sm|mandvcāre}} &gt; ''menjar'' 'to eat' ([[Occitan language|Oc.]] ''manjar'', [[French language|Fr.]] ''manger'', [[Italian language|It.]] mangiare) vs {{sm|comedere}} &gt; ''comer'' ([[Spanish language|Sp]] and [[Portuguese language|Pt.]])
* {{sm|matvtīnvs}} &gt; ''matí'' 'morning' ([[Occitan language|Oc.]] ''matin'', [[French language|Fr.]] ''matin'', [[Italian language|It.]] ''mattino/mattina'') vs {{sm|hora maneāna}} &gt; ''mañana'' ([[Spanish language|Sp.]]), ''amanhã'' ([[Portuguese language|Pt.]])
* {{sm|parabolāre}} &gt; ''parlar'' 'to speak' ([[Occitan language|Oc.]] ''parlar'', [[French language|Fr.]] ''parler'', [[Italian language|It.]] ''parlare'') vs {{sm|fābvlāre}} &gt; ''hablar'' ([[Spanish language|Sp.]]), ''falar'' [[Portuguese language|Pt.]])
* {{sm|tabvla}} &gt; ''taula'' 'table' ([[Occitan language|Oc.]]  ''taula'', [[French language|Fr.]] ''table'', [[Italian language|It.]] ''tavola'') vs {{sm|mensa}} &gt; ''mesa'' ([[Spanish language|Sp.]] and [[Portuguese language|Pt.]])

===Writing system===
{{Main|Catalan orthography}}
The Catalan writing system has a number of distinctive features. The graph ‹l·l› (named ''ela geminada'' 'geminated-l') is composed of an [[interpunct]] (or middot) between two ‹l› (e.g. ''intel·ligent'' 'intelligent' or ''novel·la'' 'novel') and is used to distinguish phonetically {{IPA|[ɫɫ]}} from {{IPA|[ʎ]}} (written ‹ll› like in Spanish). Another special digraph is ‹ny› {{IPA|[ɲ]}}, found in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Malay language|Malay]] and in some African languages (e.g. ''banys'' 'baths'). Also of note is the final digraph ‹-ig›, pronounced {{IPA|[tʃ]}} after a vowel (e.g. ''faig'' 'I do', ''maig'' 'May', ''raig'' 'ray', ''roig'' 'red', ''veig'' 'I see', ''puig'' 'hill') and {{IPA|[itʃ]}} after a consonant (e.g. ''mig'' 'half', ''desig'' 'desire'). The combination of  ‹t› + nasal or lateral consonant is pronounced as a [[gemination|geminate]] of the second consonant: ‹tm› {{IPA|[mm]}}, ‹tn› {{IPA|[nn]}}, ‹tl› {{IPA|[ɫɫ]}} and ‹tll› {{IPA|[ʎʎ]}} (e.g. ''setmana'' 'week', ''cotna'' 'pork rind', ''Betlem'' 'Betlehem', ''bitllet'' 'bank note'), whereas ‹t› + sibilant consonant indicates [[affricate consonant|affrication]]: ‹tx› {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, ‹ts› {{IPA|[ts]}}, ‹tz› {{IPA|[dz]}}, ‹tg› and ‹tj› {{IPA|[dʒ]}} (e.g. ''potser'' 'maybe', ''dotze'' 'twelve', ''jutge'' 'judge', ''platja'' 'beach'). In addition, Catalan spelling utilizes ‹ç› (called ''[[c-cedilla|ce trencada]]'', literally 'broken-c') when ‹c› takes the soft sound {{IPA|[s]}} before ‹a›, ‹o› and ‹u› (e.g. ''caça'' 'hunt'). Furthermore, the letter ‹x› can represent different sibilant sounds; {{IPA|[ks]}} (e.g. ''fixar'' 'fix'), {{IPA|[gz]}} (e.g. ''exacte'' 'exact'), {{IPA|[ʃ]}} (e.g. ''xarxa'' 'net') and dialectally {{IPA|[tʃ]}} (e.g. ''xiquet'' 'boy'), while the digraph ‹ix› always represents {{IPA|[(j)ʃ]}} (e.g. ''calaixos'' 'drawers') or {{IPA|[(j)ʒ]}} (e.g. ''peix al forn'' 'oven fish').

==Geographic distribution==
===Països Catalans===
Catalan is spoken in:
*[[Andorra]] (''Principat d'Andorra''), a [[sovereign state]] where Catalan is the [[national language|national]] and only [[official language]].
*[[Catalonia]] (''Catalunya''), in [[Spain]].
*Most of the [[Valencian Community]] (''Comunitat Valenciana'', also known as ''País Valencià''), in [[Spain]], where it is called [[Valencian]] (''valencià'').
*[[La Franja]], an adjacent strip of [[Aragon]], in [[Spain]] (in particular the ''[[Comarcas of Aragon|comarques]]'' of [[Ribagorça]], [[Llitera]], [[Baix Cinca]], and [[Matarranya]]).
*[[Balearic Islands]] (''Illes Balears''), in [[Spain]].
*[[Northern Catalonia]] (''Catalunya Nord'': name used officially for the first time on 10 December 2007 by the General Council of the [[Pyrénées-Orientales]]), in [[France]].
*The city of [[Alghero]] (''l'Alguer'') in [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]].
*A small region in [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]], [[Spain]], known as [[Carche]] (''El Carxe'').

These territories are referred as [[Catalan Countries]] (''Països Catalans''), a denomination based on cultural affinity and common heritage, that has also had a subsequent political interpretation but no official status.

#The number of people who understand Catalan includes those who can speak it.
#Figures relate to all self-declared capable speakers, not just native speakers.&lt;/small&gt;

The number of persons fluent in Catalan varies depending on the sources used. The 2004 language study cited below in this article does not indicate the total number of speakers, but an estimate of 9-9.5 million can be made, by matching the percentage of speakers to the population of each area where Catalan is spoken (&quot;Sociolinguistic Situation in Catalan-speaking Areas.&quot; cited in the Section, External Links, of this article). The web site of the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] gives the number, as of June 2007, as 9,118,882 speakers of Catalan. And according to [[Ethnologue|Ethnologue: Languages of the World]], Catalan has a total of 11,530,160 speakers.&lt;ref name=&quot;number of speakers&quot;&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=size Number of Catalan speakers], [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=cat Catalan-Valencian-Balear] Ethnologue.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
In 1861, [[Manuel Milà i Fontanals]] proposed a division of Catalan into two major dialect blocks: [[Eastern Catalan]] and [[Western Catalan]]. The different Catalan dialects show deep differences in lexicon, grammar, morphology and pronunciation due to historical isolation. Each dialect also encompasses several regional varieties.

There is no precise linguistic border between one dialect and another because there is nearly always a transition zone of some size between pairs of geographically separated dialects (except for dialects specific to an island).{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The main difference between the two blocks is their treatment of unstressed vowels, in addition to a few other features:

*'''Eastern Catalan''' (''bloc o branca del català oriental''):
**The vowels {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} reduce to {{IPA|[ə]}} when unstressed, and {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} reduce to {{IPA|[u]}} (though in most of Majorcan, {{IPA|[o]}} also appears in unstressed position).
**Latin long {{IPA|/eː/}} and short {{IPA|/i/}} have become {{IPA|/ɛ/}}; e.g. ''sec'' {{IPA|/ˈsɛk/}} 'dry' (though in most of Balearic Catalan it has become a stressed {{IPA|/ə/}}; e.g. ''sec'' {{IPA|/ˈsək/}}, while {{IPA|/e/}} in [[Alguerese]]; ''sec'' {{IPA|/ˈsek/}}).
**Initial or post-consonantal ‹x› is the fricative {{IPA|/ʃ/}}. Between vowels or when final and preceded by ''i'' it is also {{IPA|/ʃ/}}; e.g. ''caixa'' {{IPA|/ˈkaʃə/}} ('box').
**1st person present indicative is -''o'', -''i'' or there is no marker: ''parlo'', ''temo'', ''sento'' (Central Catalan); ''parl'', ''tem'', ''sent'' (Balearic) and ''parli'', ''temi'', ''senti'' (Northern Catalan).
**Inchoative verbs in -''eixo'', -''eix'', -''eixen'', -''eixi''.
**The {{IPA|/n/}} of medieval nasal plural is loss in proparoxytone words: ''homes'' 'men', ''joves'' 'youth'.
**Specific lexicon: ''mirall'' 'mirror', ''noi'' 'boy', ''escombra'' 'broom', ''llombrígol'' 'navel/belly bottom', etc.

*'''Western Catalan''' (''bloc o branca del català occidental''):
**Unstressed vowels: {{IPA|[a e i o u]}}. Distinction between unstressed ‹e› and ‹a›, and ‹o› and ‹u› (though unstressed {{IPA|[e]}} may merge with {{IPA|[a]}} before nasal and sibilant consonants: ''encara'' {{IPA|[aŋˈkaɾa]}} 'still', and {{IPA|/o/}} may reduce to {{IPA|[u]}} before a bilabial consonants, or before a stressed syllable with {{IPA|/i/}}; ''conill'' {{IPA|[kuˈniʎ]}} 'rabbit').
**Latin long {{IPA|/eː/}} and short {{IPA|/i/}} have become {{IPA|/e/}}; e.g. ''sec'' {{IPA|/ˈsek/}} ('dry').
**Initial or post-consonantal ‹x› is affricated {{IPA|[tʃ]}} (however there are many exceptions, e.g. [[Xàtiva]], Xavier, ''xarxa'' 'net', ''xilòfon'' 'xilophone', etc. where it is a fricative {{IPA|/ʃ/}}). Between vowels or when final and preceded by ‹i›, it is {{IPA|/jʃ/}}; e.g. ''caixa'' {{IPA|/ˈkajʃa/}} ('box').
**1st person present indicative is -''e'' (elided in verbs of the 2nd and 3rd conjugation) or -''o'': ''parle'', ''tem'', ''sent'' (Valencian); ''parlo'', ''temo'', ''sento'' (North-Western Catalan).
**Inchoative verbs in -''isc''/-''ixo'', -''ix'', -''ixen'', -''isca''.
**Maintenance of medieval nasal plural in proparoxytone words: ''hòmens'' 'men', ''jóvens'' 'youth'.
**Specific lexicon: ''espill'' 'mirror', ''xiquet'' 'boy', ''granera'' 'broom', ''melic'' 'navel/belly bottom', etc.

In addition, neither [[dialect]] is completely homogeneous: any dialect can be subdivided into several sub-dialects. Catalan can be subdivided into two major dialect blocks and those blocks into individual dialects:

Catalan is a [[pluricentric language]] with two main standards; one regulated by the ''[[Institut d'Estudis Catalans]]'' (IEC), general standard, with [[Pompeu Fabra]]'s orthography as axis, keeping features from [[Central Catalan]], and the other regulated by the ''[[Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua]]'' (AVL), restricted scale standard, focused on [[Valencian]] standardization on the basis of [[Normes de Castelló]], that is, [[Pompeu Fabra]]'s orthography but more adapted to [[Western Catalan]] pronunciation and features of Valencian dialects.

IEC's Standard, apart from the basis of Central Catalan features, takes also other dialects features considering as standard. Despite this, the most notable difference between both standards is some tonic ‹e› accentuation, for instance: ''francès, anglès'' (IEC) - ''francés, anglés'' (AVL) ('French, English'), ''cafè'' (IEC) - ''café'' (AVL) ('coffee'), ''conèixer'' (IEC) - ''conéixer'' ('to know'), ''comprèn'' (IEC) - ''comprén'' (AVL) ('he understands'). This is because of the different pronunciation of some tonic ‹e›, especially tonic {{sm|ē}} (long ‹ē›) and {{sm|i}} (short ‹ĭ›) from [[Vulgar Latin|Latin]], in both Catalan blocks ({{IPA|[ɛ]}} in Eastern Catalan and [e] in Western Catalan). Despite this, AVL's standard keeps grave accent ‹è›, without pronouncing this ‹e› {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, in some words like: ''què'' ('what'), ''València'', ''èter'' ('ether'), ''sèsam'' ('sesame'), ''sèrie'' ('series') and ''època'' ('age').

There are also some other divergences like the digraph ‹tl› used by AVL in some words instead of ‹tll› like in ''ametla''/''ametlla'' ('almond'), ''espatla''/''espatlla'' ('back' [[anatomy|an.]]) or ''butla''/''butlla'' ('bull'), the use of elided demonstratives (''este'' 'this', ''eixe'' 'that' -near-) in the same level as reinforced ones (''aquest, aqueix'') or the use of many verbal forms common in Valencian, and some of these common in the rest of Western Catalan too, like subjunctive mood or inchoative conjugation in -''ix''- at the same level as -''eix''- or the priority use of -''e'' morpheme in 1st person singular in present indicative (-''ar'' verbs): ''jo compre'' instead of ''jo compro'' ('I buy').

In the [[Balearic Islands]], IEC's standard is used but adapted for the Balearic dialect by the [[University of the Balearic Islands]]'s philological section, ''[[Govern de les Illes Balears]]'''s consultative organ. In this way, for instance, IEC says it is correct writing ''cantam'' as much as ''cantem'' ('we sing') but the University says that the priority form in the Balearic Islands must be &quot;''cantam''&quot; in all fields. Another feature of the Balearic standard is the non-ending in the 1st person singular present indicative: ''jo compr'' ('I buy'), ''jo tem'' ('I fear'), ''jo dorm'' ('I sleep').

In [[Alghero]], the IEC has adapted its standard to the [[Alguerese|Alguerese dialect]]. In this standard one can find, among other features: the definite article ''lo'' instead of ''el'', special possessive pronouns and determinants ''la mia'' ('mine'), ''lo sou/la sua'' ('his/her'), ''lo tou/la tua'' ('yours'), and so on, the use of ''-v-'' {{IPA|/v/}} in the imperfect tense in all conjugations: ''cantava'', ''creixiva'', ''llegiva''; the use of many archaic words, usual words in Alguerese: ''manco'' instead of ''menys'' ('less'), ''calqui u'' instead of ''algú'' ('someone'), ''qual/quala'' instead of ''quin/quina'' ('which'), and so on; and the adaptation of [[weak pronouns in Catalan|weak pronouns]].

In 2011, the [[Aragon|Aragonese government]] passed a decree for the establishment of a new language regulator of Catalan in [[La Franja]] (the so-called Catalan-speaking areas of Aragon). The new entity, designated as [[Acadèmia Aragonesa del Català]], shall allow a facultative education in Catalan and a standardization of the Catalan language in [[La Franja]].

==Status of Valencian==
{{Main|Valencian}}
{{Refimprove|section|date=March 2011}}
[[Image:Subdialectes del valencià.svg|thumb||200px|Sub-varieties of Valencian]]

The official language academy of the [[Valencian Community]] (the [[Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua]]) considers ''Catalan'' and ''Valencian'' simply to be [[names of Catalan language|two names]] for the same language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avl.gva.es/img/EdicionsPublicacions/AcordsGenerals/NOMENTITAT.pdf ''&quot;Dictamen de l'Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua sobre els principis i criteris per a la defensa de la denominació i l'entitat del valencià&quot;'']. Report from [[Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua]] about denomination and identity of Valencian.&lt;/ref&gt; All universities teaching Romance languages, and virtually all linguists, consider these two to be linguistic variants of the same language (similar to [[Canadian French]] versus Metropolitan French, and [[European Portuguese|European]] versus [[Brazilian Portuguese]]).

There is a roughly continuous [[dialect continuum|set of dialects]] covering the regional forms of Catalan/Valencian, with no break at the border between Catalonia and the Valencian Community,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and the various forms of Catalan and Valencian are mutually intelligible.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  This is not to say that there are no differences between them; the speech of Valencians is recognizable both in pronunciation as well as in morphological and lexical peculiarities.  However, these differences are not any wider than among North-Western Catalan and Eastern Catalan. In fact, Northern Valencian (spoken in the Castelló province and Matarranya valley, a strip of [[Aragon]]) is more similar to the Catalan of the lower [[Ebro]] [[drainage basin|basin]] (spoken in southern half of [[Tarragona province]] and another strip of Aragon) than to ''apitxat'' Valencian (spoken in the area of [[L'Horta]], in the province of Valencia).

What gets called a [[language]] (as opposed to a dialect) is defined partly by mutual comprehensibility as well as political and cultural factors. In this case, the perceived status of Valencian as a dialect of Catalan has historically had important political implications including [[Catalan nationalism]] and the idea of the ''Països Catalans'' or [[Catalan countries]]. Arguing that Valencian is a separate language may sometimes be part of an effort by Valencians to resist a perceived Catalan nationalist agenda aimed at incorporating Valencians into what they feel is a &quot;constructed&quot; nationality centered on Barcelona.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} As such, the issue of whether Catalan and Valencian constitute different languages or merely dialects has been the subject of political agitation several times since the end of the Franco era.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The latest political controversy regarding Valencian occurred on the occasion of the drafting of the [[European Constitution]] in 2004. The Spanish government supplied the [[European Union|EU]] with translations of the text into [[Basque language|Basque]], Galician, Catalan, and Valencian, but the Catalan and Valencian versions were identical.&lt;ref&gt;Isabel I Vilar, Ferran. [http://www.mail-archive.com/infozefir@listserv.rediris.es/msg00442.html ''&quot;Traducció única de la Constitució europea&quot;'']. I-Zefir. 30 Oct. 2004. 29 Apr. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; While professing the unity of the Catalan language, the Spanish government claimed to be constitutionally bound to produce distinct Catalan and Valencian versions because the Statute of Autonomy of the Valencian Community refers to the language as ''Valencian''. In practice, the Catalan, Valencian, and Balearic versions of the EU constitution are identical: the government of Catalonia accepted the Valencian translation without any changes under the premise that the Valencian standard is accepted by the norms set forth by the IEC.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Catalan may be seen instead as a multi-centric language (much like English); there exist two standards, one for Oriental Catalan, regulated by the IEC, which is centered on Central Catalan (with slight variations to include Balearic verb inflection) and one for Occidental, regulated by the AVL, centered on Valencian.

The AVL accepts the conventions set forth in the [[Normes de Castelló]] as the normative spelling, shared with the IEC that allows for the diverse idiosyncrasies of the different language dialects and varieties. As the normative spelling, these conventions are used in education, and most contemporary Valencian writers make use of them. Nonetheless, a small minority mainly of those who advocate for the recognition of Valencian as a separate language, use in a non-normative manner an alternative spelling convention known as the [[Normes del Puig]].

==Grammar==
{{Main|Catalan grammar}}
The first descriptive and normative grammar book of modern Catalan was written by [[Pompeu Fabra]] in 1918. In 1995, a new grammar by [[Antoni Maria Badia i Margarit]] was published, which also documents the Valencian and Balearic varieties.

The grammar of Catalan follows the general pattern of Western Romance languages. The primary [[word order]] is [[Subject Verb Object|SVO]] (Subject-Verb-Object).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_ctl The World Atlas of Language Structures]. wals.info.&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantives and adjectives are not declined by case, as in Classical Latin. There are two [[grammatical gender]]s—masculine and feminine.

Grammatical [[article (grammar)|article]]s developed from Latin [[demonstrative]]s. The form of the article depends on the gender and the number of the subject and the first sounds of the word and can be combined with prepositions that precede them. A unique feature of Catalan is a definite article that may precede [[personal names]] in certain contexts. Its basic form is ''en'' and it can change according to its environment (note [[clitic]] ''en'' has also other lexical meanings). One of the common usages of this article is in the word ''can'', a combination of ''la casa'' shortened to ''ca'' ('house', as [[French language|French]] ''chez'') and ''en'', which here means 'the'. For example ''la casa d'en Sergi'' becomes ''Can Sergi'' meaning 'the house of Sergi', 'Sergi's house'. Note here, other articles (''el, la, els, les'') can also be used with personal names like in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], as ''la Maria'' (or ''na Maria'').

Verbs are conjugated according to tense and mood similarly to other Western Romance languages—present and simple preterite are based on classical Latin, future is formed from infinitive followed by the present form of the auxiliary verb ''haver'' (written together and not considered periphrastic), and periphrastic tenses are formed from the conjugated auxiliary verbs ''haver'' ('to have') and ''ésser'' ('to be') followed by the past participle. A unique tense in Catalan is the &quot;periphrastic simple preterite,&quot; which is formed of ''vaig'', ''vas'' (or ''vares''), ''va'', ''vam'' (or ''vàrem''), ''vau'' (or ''vàreu'') and ''van'' (there is the usual wrong idea these forms are the conjugated forms of ''anar'', which means 'to go'), which is followed by the infinitive of the verb.  Thus, ''jo vaig parlar'' (or more simply ''vaig parlar'') means 'I spoke'.

Nominative pronouns are often omitted, as the subject can be usually derived from the conjugated verb. The Catalan rules for combination of the object pronoun [[clitic]]s with verbs, articles and other pronouns are significantly more complex than in most other Romance languages; see [[Weak pronouns in Catalan]].

==Catalan names==
{{main|Catalan names}}

Catalan naming customs are similar to those of Spain and [[Portugal]]; people receive two last names – their father's and their mother's – which are separated by the particle ''i'', meaning 'and' (in Spanish the equivalent particle is written ''y'', but often omitted altogether).

For example, the full name of the architect [[Antoni Gaudí]] is Antoni ''Gaudí i Cornet'' after his parents: Francesc ''Gaudí'' i Serra and Antònia ''Cornet'' i Bertran, meaning he was son of ''Gaudí'' and ''Cornet''.

'''STS-51-F''' (also known as '''Spacelab 2''') was the nineteenth flight of [[NASA]]'s [[Space Shuttle program]], and the eighth flight of [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']]. It launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]], [[Florida]], on 29 July 1985, and landed just under eight days later on 6 August.

While STS-51-F's primary payload was the [[Spacelab]]-2 laboratory module, the payload which received the most publicity was the ''Carbonated Beverage Dispenser Evaluation'', which was an experiment in which both [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]] tried to make their carbonated drinks available to astronauts.

==Launch==
STS-51-F's first launch attempt on 12 July 1985 was halted with the countdown at T-3 seconds after main engine ignition, when a malfunction of the number two [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]] (SSME) coolant valve caused the shutdown of all three main engines.
 
''Challenger'' launched successfully on its second attempt at 29 July 1985, 17:00 EDT, after a delay of one hour and 37 minutes due to a problem with the table maintenance block update uplink. 

Three minutes and 31 seconds into the ascent, one of the center engine's two high pressure fuel turbopump turbine discharge temperature sensors failed. Two minutes and 12 seconds later, the second sensor failed, causing the shutdown of the center engine. To date, this has been the only in-flight main engine failure of the shuttle program. Approximately 8 minutes into the flight, one of the same temperature sensors in the right engine failed, and the remaining right engine temperature sensor displayed readings near the redline for engine shutdown. [[Booster Systems Engineer]] Jenny M. Howard acted quickly to command the crew to inhibit any further automatic SSME shutdowns based on readings from the remaining sensors, preventing the potential shutdown of a second engine and a possible abort mode that may have resulted in the loss of the vehicle and crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The failed SSME resulted in an [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Abort to Orbit (ATO)|Abort To Orbit (ATO)]] trajectory, whereby the shuttle achieved a lower-than-planned orbital altitude.

STS-51-F's primary payload was the laboratory module [[Spacelab]]-2. A special part of the modular Spacelab system, the &quot;[[igloo]]&quot;, which was located at head of a three-pallet train, provided on-site support to instruments mounted on pallets. The main mission objective was to verify performance of Spacelab systems, determine the interface capability of the orbiter, and measure the environment created by the spacecraft. Experiments covered [[life science]]s, [[plasma physics]], [[astronomy]], high-energy [[astrophysics]], [[solar physics]], [[atmospheric physics]] and technology research. Despite mission replanning necessitated by ''Challenger''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Intact abort modes|abort to orbit]] trajectory, the Spacelab mission was declared a success.

The flight marked the first time the [[European Space Agency|ESA]] Instrument Pointing System (IPS) was tested in orbit. This unique pointing instrument was designed with an accuracy of one [[arcsecond]]. Initially, some problems were experienced when it was commanded to track the [[Sun]], but a series of software fixes were made and the problem was corrected.

In addition, [[Anthony W. England|Tony England]] became the second [[amateur radio operator]] to [[Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment|transmit from space]] during the mission.

The Spacelab Infrared Telescope (IRT) was also flown on the mission.&lt;ref name=kent/&gt; The IRT was a 15.2&amp;nbsp;cm aperture helium-cooled [[infrared]] telescope, observing light between wavelengths of 1.7 to 118 μm.&lt;ref name=kent&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1992ApJS...78..403K Kent, et al. – '''Galactic structure from the Spacelab infrared telescope''' (1992)]&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment experienced some problems, such as heat emissions from the Shuttle corrupting data, but still returned useful astronomical data.&lt;ref name=kent/&gt;

In a heavily-publicised marketing experiment, astronauts aboard STS-51-F enjoyed [[soft drink|carbonated beverage]]s from specially-designed cans provided by [[Cola Wars|competitors]] [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearlman|first=Robert|title=A Brief History of Space Marketing |url=http://www.space.com/news/spaceagencies/space_market_010531-1.html|accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landing==
''Challenger'' landed at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]], on 6 August, 1985, at 12:45:26&amp;nbsp;pm PDT. Its rollout distance was {{convert|8569|ft|m}}. The mission had been extended by 17 orbits for additional payload activities due to the abort-to-orbit. The orbiter arrived back at Kennedy Space Center on 11 August 1985.

==Mission insignia==
The mission insignia was designed by [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] artist Skip Bradley. [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] is depicted ascending toward the heavens in search of new knowledge in the field of solar and stellar astronomy, with its Spacelab 2 payload. The constellations [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] and [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] are shown in the positions they were in relative to the Sun during the flight. The nineteen stars indicate that the mission is the 19th shuttle flight.

The dates of the '''Classical Period''' in Western music are generally accepted as being between about 1750 and 1830. However, the term ''[[classical music]]'' is used colloquially to describe a variety of Western musical styles from the ninth century to the present, and especially from the sixteenth or seventeenth to the nineteenth. This article is about the specific period from 1750 to 1830.&lt;ref&gt;*[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', 985 pages,  ISBN 0-19-861459-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Classical period falls between the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods. The best known [[composer]]s from this period are [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], and [[Franz Schubert]]; other notable names include [[Luigi Boccherini]], [[Muzio Clementi]], [[Antonio Soler]], [[Antonio Salieri]], [[François Joseph Gossec]], [[Johann Stamitz]], [[Carl Friedrich Abel]], [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]. Ludwig van Beethoven is also sometimes regarded either as a Romantic composer or a composer who was part of the transition to the Romantic; [[Franz Schubert]] is also something of a transitional figure, as are [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]], [[Mauro Giuliani]], [[Friedrich Kuhlau]], [[Fernando Sor]], [[Luigi Cherubini]], [[Jan Ladislav Dussek]], and [[Carl Maria von Weber]]. The period is sometimes referred to as the era of ''Viennese Classic'' or ''Classicism'' ({{lang-de|Wiener Klassik}}), since Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn, and Ludwig van Beethoven all worked at some time in [[Vienna]], and Franz Schubert was born there.

== Classicism ==
In the middle of the 18th century , Europe began to move toward a new style in [[architecture]], literature, and the arts, generally known as [[Classicism]], which sought to emulate the ideals of [[Classical antiquity]] and especially those of [[Classical Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamien, Roger. Music: An Appreciation. 6th. New York, NY: McGraw Hill, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  While still tightly linked to the court culture and absolutism, with its formality and emphasis on order and hierarchy, the new style was also a cleaner style —one that favored clearer divisions between parts, brighter contrasts and colors, and simplicity rather than complexity. The remarkable development of ideas in &quot;natural philosophy&quot; had established itself in the public consciousness with [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] physics taken as a paradigm: structures should be well-founded in [[axiom]]s and be both well-articulated and orderly. This taste for structural clarity worked its way into the world of music, moving away from the layered [[polyphony]] of the Baroque period, towards a style where a [[melody]] over a subordinate [[harmony]] —a combination called [[homophony]]— was preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Kamien, Roger. Music: An Appreciation. 6th. New York, NY: McGraw Hill, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the playing of [[Chord (music)|chords]], even if they interrupted the melodic smoothness of a single part, became a much more prevalent feature of music. This, in turn, made the [[tonality|tonal]] structure of works [[counterpoint|more audible]].

The new style was also pushed forward by changes in the economic order and in social structure. As the 18th century progressed, the nobility became the primary patrons of instrumental music, and there was a rise in the public taste for comic [[opera]]. This led to changes in the way music was performed, the most crucial of which was the move to standard instrumental groups and the reduction in the importance of the ''[[basso continuo|continuo]]'' — the harmonic fill beneath the music, often played by several instruments. One way to trace this decline of the continuo and its [[figured bass|figured]] chords is to examine the decline of the term ''[[obbligato]]'', meaning a mandatory instrumental part in a work of [[chamber music]]. In the Baroque world, additional instruments could be optionally added to the continuo; in the Classical world, all parts were noted specifically, though not always ''notated'', as a matter of course, so the word &quot;obbligato&quot; became redundant. By 1800, the term was practically extinct.
{{Classicism}}
The changes in economic situation also had the effect of altering the balance of availability and quality of musicians. While in the late Baroque a major composer would have the entire musical resources of a town to draw on, the forces available at a hunting lodge were smaller and more fixed in their level of ability. This was a spur to having primarily simple parts to play, and in the case of a resident virtuoso group, a spur to writing spectacular, idiomatic parts for certain instruments, as in the case of the [[Mannheim orchestra]]. In addition, the appetite for a continual supply of new music, carried over from the Baroque, meant that works had to be performable with, at best, one rehearsal. Indeed, even after 1790 Mozart writes about &quot;the rehearsal&quot;, with the implication that his concerts would have only one.

Since polyphonic texture was no longer the main focus of music (excluding the development section) but rather a single melodic line with accompaniment, there was greater emphasis on notating that line for [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] and phrasing. The simplification of texture made such instrumental detail more important, and also made the use of characteristic rhythms, such as attention-getting opening fanfares, the funeral march rhythm, or the minuet genre, more important in establishing and unifying the tone of a single movement.

Forms such as the concerto and sonata were more heavily defined and given more specific rules, whereas the symphony was created in this period (this is popularly attributed to Joseph Haydn). The ''concerto grosso'' (a concerto for more than one musician) began to be replaced by the ''solo concerto'' (a concerto featuring only one soloist), and therefore began to place more importance on the particular soloist's ability to show off. There were, of course, some ''concerto grossos'' that remained, the most famous of which being Mozart's [[Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra (Mozart)|Sinfonia Concertante for Violin and Viola in E flat Major]].

== Main characteristics ==
Classical music has a lighter, clearer texture than [[Baroque]] music and is less complex. It is mainly [[homophonic]] &lt;ref&gt;Blume, Friedrich. Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey. New York: W.W. Norton .	&amp; Company, 1970. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; — melody above chordal accompaniment (but [[counterpoint]] is by no means forgotten, especially later in the period).
Variety and contrast within a piece became more pronounced than before. Variety of keys, melodies, rhythms and dynamics (using [[wikt:crescendo|crescendo]], [[wikt:diminuendo|diminuendo]] and [[wikt:sforzando|sforzando]]), along with frequent changes of mood and timbre were more commonplace in the Classical period than they had been in the Baroque. Melodies tended to be shorter than those of Baroque music, with clear-cut phrases and clearly marked [[Cadence (music)|cadences]]. The [[Orchestra]] increased in size and range; the [[harpsichord]] continuo fell out of use, and the [[woodwind]] became a self-contained section. As a solo instrument, the [[harpsichord]] was replaced by the [[piano]] (or [[fortepiano]]). Early piano music was light in texture, often with [[Alberti bass]] accompaniment, but it later became richer, more sonorous and more powerful.

Importance was given to instrumental music — the main kinds were [[sonata]], trio, [[string quartet]], [[symphony]], [[concerto]], [[serenade]] and [[divertimento]]. [[Sonata form]] developed and became the most important form. It was used to build up the first movement of most large-scale works, but also other movements and single pieces (such as [[overture]]s).

==History==
===The Baroque/Classical transition c. 1730–1760===
{{See also|History of sonata form}}
At first the new style took over Baroque forms —the ternary ''[[da capo aria]]'' and the ''[[sinfonia]]'' and ''[[concerto]]''— but composed with simpler parts, more notated ornamentation and more emphatic division into sections. However, over time, the new aesthetic caused radical changes in how pieces were put together, and the basic layouts changed. Composers from this period sought dramatic effects, striking melodies, and clearer textures. The [[Italy|Italian]] composer [[Domenico Scarlatti]] was an important figure in the transition from Baroque to Classical. His unique compositional style is strongly related to that of the early Classical period. He is best known for composing more than five hundred one-movement keyboard sonatas. In [[Spain]], [[Antonio Soler]] also produced valuable keyboard sonatas, more varied in form than those of Scarlatti, with some pieces in three or four movements. Another important break with the past was the radical overhaul of opera by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], who cut away a great deal of the layering and improvisational ornament and focused on the points of [[Modulation (music)|modulation]] and transition. By making these moments where the harmony changes more focal, he enabled powerful dramatic shifts in the emotional color of the music. To highlight these episodes he used changes in instrumentation, melody, and [[Musical mode|mode]]. Among the most successful composers of his time, Gluck spawned many emulators, one of whom was [[Antonio Salieri]]. Their emphasis on accessibility brought huge successes in opera, and in vocal music more widely: songs, oratorios, and choruses. These were considered the most important kinds of music for performance and hence enjoyed greatest success in the public estimation.

The phase between the Baroque and the rise of the Classical, with its broad mixture of competing ideas and attempts to unify the different demands of taste, economics and &quot;worldview&quot;, goes by many names. It is sometimes called ''[[Galant]]'', ''[[Rococo]]'', or ''pre-Classical'', or at other times ''early Classical''{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. It is a period where some composers still working in the Baroque style flourish, though sometimes thought of as being more of the past than the present — Bach, Handel, and Telemann all composed well beyond the point at which the homophonic style is clearly in the ascendant. Musical culture was caught at a crossroads: the masters of the older style had the technique, but the public hungered for the new. This is one of the reasons [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.P.E. Bach]] was held in such high regard: he understood the older forms quite well and knew how to present them in new garb, with an enhanced variety of form.

===Circa 1750–1775===
{{See also|Symphony}}
[[File:Haydnportrait.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Haydn]] (1732 - 1809). Depicts Haydn ca. 1770]]
By the late 1750s there were flourishing centers of the new style in Italy, Vienna, Mannheim, and Paris; dozens of symphonies were composed and there were &quot;bands&quot; of players associated with theatres. Opera or other vocal music was the feature of most musical events, with concertos and &quot;symphonies&quot; (arising from the ''[[overture]]'') serving as instrumental interludes and introductions for operas and church services. Over the course of the Classical period, &quot;symphonies&quot; and concertos developed and were presented independently of vocal music. The &quot;normal&quot; ensemble—a body of strings supplemented by winds—and movements of particular rhythmic character were established by the late 1750s in Vienna. However, the length and weight of pieces was still set with some Baroque characteristics: individual movements still focused on one ''affect'' or had only one sharply contrasting middle section, and their length was not significantly greater than Baroque movements. There was not yet a clearly enunciated theory of how to compose in the new style. It was a moment ripe for a breakthrough.

Many consider this breakthrough to have been made by C.P.E. Bach, Gluck, and several others. Indeed, C.P.E. Bach and Gluck are often considered to be founders of the Classical style.

The first great master of the style was the composer [[Joseph Haydn]]. In the late 1750s he began composing symphonies, and by 1761 he had composed a triptych (''Morning'', ''Noon'', and ''Evening'') solidly in the &quot;contemporary&quot; mode. As a vice-[[Kapellmeister]] and later Kapellmeister, his output expanded: he composed over forty symphonies in the 1760s alone. And while his fame grew, as his orchestra was expanded and his compositions were copied and disseminated, his voice was only one among many.

While some suggest that he was overshadowed by Mozart and Beethoven, it would be difficult to overstate Haydn's centrality to the new style, and therefore to the future of Western art music as a whole. At the time, before the pre-eminence of Mozart or Beethoven, and with Johann Sebastian Bach known primarily to connoisseurs of keyboard music, Haydn reached a place in music that set him above all other composers except perhaps George Friedrich Handel. He took existing ideas, and radically altered how they functioned — earning him the titles &quot;father of the [[symphony]],&quot; and &quot;father of the [[string quartet]].&quot;

One of the forces that worked as an impetus for his pressing forward was the first stirring of what would later be called ''[[Romanticism]]'' — the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'', or &quot;storm and stress&quot; phase in the arts, a short period where obvious emotionalism was a stylistic preference. Haydn accordingly wanted more dramatic contrast and more emotionally appealing melodies, with sharpened character and individuality. This period faded away in music and literature: however, it influenced what came afterward and would eventually be a component of aesthetic taste in later decades.

The [[Symphony No. 45 (Haydn)|''Farewell Symphony'']], No. 45 in F{{music|sharp}} Minor, exemplifies Haydn's integration of the differing demands of the new style, with surprising sharp turns and a long adagio to end the work. In 1772, Haydn completed his Opus 20 set of six string quartets, in which he deployed the polyphonic techniques he had gathered from the previous era to provide structural coherence capable of holding together his melodic ideas. For some this marks the beginning of the &quot;mature&quot; Classical style, where the period of reaction against the complexity of the late Baroque began to be replaced with a period of integration of elements of both Baroque and Classical styles.

===Circa 1775–1790===
{{See also|Musical development}}
[[File:Mozart (unfinished) by Lange 1782.jpg|thumb|Unfinished portrait of Mozart by his brother-in-law [[Joseph Lange]]]]
Haydn, having worked for over a decade as the music director for a prince, had far more resources and scope for composing than most and also the ability to shape the forces that would play his music. This opportunity was not wasted, as Haydn, beginning quite early on his career, sought to press forward the technique of building ideas in music. His next important breakthrough was in the Opus 33 string quartets (1781), where the melodic and the harmonic roles segue among the instruments: it is often momentarily unclear what is melody and what is harmony. This changes the way the ensemble works its way between dramatic moments of transition and climactic sections: the music flows smoothly and without obvious interruption. He then took this integrated style and began applying it to orchestral and vocal music.

Haydn's gift to music was a way of composing, a way of structuring works, which was at the same time in accord with the governing aesthetic of the new style. However, a younger contemporary, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], brought his genius to Haydn's ideas and applied them to two of the major genres of the day: opera, and the virtuoso concerto. Whereas Haydn spent much of his working life as a court composer, Mozart wanted public success in the concert life of cities. This meant opera, and it meant performing as a virtuoso. Haydn was not a virtuoso at the international touring level; nor was he seeking to create operatic works that could play for many nights in front of a large audience. Mozart wanted both. Moreover, Mozart also had a taste for more chromatic chords (and greater contrasts in harmonic language generally), a greater love for creating a welter of melodies in a single work, and a more Italianate sensibility in music as a whole. He found, in Haydn's music and later in his study of the polyphony of Bach, the means to discipline and enrich his gifts.

Mozart rapidly came to the attention of Haydn, who hailed the new composer, studied his works, and considered the younger man his only true peer in music. In Mozart, Haydn found a greater range of instrumentation, dramatic effect and melodic resource; the learning relationship moved in two directions.

Mozart's arrival in Vienna in 1780 brought an acceleration in the development of the Classical style. There Mozart absorbed the fusion of Italianate brilliance and Germanic cohesiveness which had been brewing for the previous 20 years. His own taste for brilliances, rhythmically complex melodies and figures, long cantilena melodies, and virtuoso flourishes was merged with an appreciation for formal coherence and internal connectedness. It is at this point that war and inflation halted a trend to larger orchestras and forced the disbanding or reduction of many theatre orchestras. This pressed the Classical style inwards: towards seeking greater ensemble and technical challenge — for example, scattering the melody across woodwinds, or using thirds to highlight the melody taken by them. This process placed a premium on chamber music for more public performance, giving a further boost to the string quartet and other small ensemble groupings.

It was during this decade that public taste began, increasingly, to recognize that Haydn and Mozart had reached a higher standard of composition. By the time Mozart arrived at age 25, in 1781, the dominant styles of Vienna were recognizably connected to the emergence in the 1750s of the early Classical style. By the end of the 1780s, changes in performance practice, the relative standing of instrumental and vocal music, technical demands on musicians, and stylistic unity had become established in the composers who imitated Mozart and Haydn. During this decade Mozart composed his most famous operas, his six late symphonies which helped to redefine the genre, and a string of piano concerti which still stand at the pinnacle of these forms.

One composer who was influential in spreading the more serious style that Mozart and Haydn had formed is [[Muzio Clementi]], a gifted virtuoso pianist who tied with Mozart in a musical &quot;duel&quot; before the emperor in which they each improvised and performed their compositions. Clementi's sonatas for the piano circulated widely, and he became the most successful composer in [[London]] during the 1780s. Also in London at this time was [[Jan Ladislav Dussek]], who, like Clementi, encouraged piano makers to extend the range and other features of their instruments, and then fully exploited the newly opened possibilities. The importance of London in the Classical period is often overlooked, but it served as the home to the [[Broadwood and Sons|Broadwood's]] factory for piano manufacturing and as the base for composers who, while less notable than the &quot;Vienna School&quot;, had a decisive influence on what came later. They were composers of many fine works, notable in their own right. London's taste for virtuosity may well have encouraged the complex passage work and extended statements on tonic and dominant.

===Circa 1790–1830===
When Haydn and Mozart began composing, symphonies were played as single movements —before, between, or as interludes within other works— and many of them lasted only ten or twelve minutes; instrumental groups had varying standards of playing, and the continuo was a central part of music-making. In the intervening years, the social world of music had seen dramatic changes: international publication and touring had grown explosively, concert societies were beginning to be formed, notation had been made more specific, more descriptive, and schematics for works had been simplified (yet became more varied in their exact working out). In 1790, just before Mozart's death, with his reputation spreading rapidly, Haydn was poised for a series of successes, notably his late oratorios and &quot;London&quot; symphonies. Composers in [[Paris]], [[Rome]], and all over Germany turned to Haydn and Mozart for their ideas on form.

The moment was again ripe for a dramatic shift. During the 1790s, there emerged of a new generation of composers, born around 1770, who, while they had grown up with the earlier styles, found in the recent works of Haydn and Mozart a vehicle for greater expression. In 1788 [[Luigi Cherubini]] settled in Paris and in 1791 composed ''Lodoiska'', an opera that rose him to fame. Its style is clearly reflective of the mature Haydn and Mozart, and its instrumentation gave it a weight that had not yet been felt in the [[grand opera]]. His contemporary [[Étienne Méhul]] extended instrumental effects with his 1790 opera ''Euphrosine et Coradin'', from which followed a series of successes.

The most fateful of the new generation was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], who launched his numbered works in 1794 with a set of three piano trios, which remain in the repertoire. Somewhat younger than the others, though equally accomplished because of his youthful study under Mozart and his native virtuosity, was [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]]. Hummel studied under Haydn as well; he was a friend to Beethoven and [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and a teacher to [[Franz Liszt]]. He concentrated more on the piano than any other instrument, and his time in London in 1791 and 1792 generated the composition and publication in 1793 of three piano sonatas, opus 2, which idiomatically used Mozart's techniques of avoiding the expected cadence, and Clementi's sometimes modally uncertain virtuoso figuration. Taken together, these composers can be seen as the vanguard of a broad change in style and the center of music. They studied one another's works, copied one another's gestures in music, and on occasion behaved like quarrelsome rivals.

The crucial differences with the previous wave can be seen in the downward shift in melodies, increasing durations of movements, the acceptance of Mozart and Haydn as paradigmatic, the greater use of keyboard resources, the shift from &quot;vocal&quot; writing to &quot;pianistic&quot; writing, the growing pull of the minor and of modal ambiguity, and the increasing importance of varying accompanying figures to bring &quot;texture&quot; forward as an element in music. In short, the late Classical was seeking a music that was internally more complex. The growth of concert societies and amateur orchestras, marking the importance of music as part of middle-class life, contributed to a booming market for pianos, piano music, and virtuosi to serve as examplars. Hummel, Beethoven, and Clementi were all renowned for their improvising.

&lt;!--provide reference...One explanation for the shift in style has been advanced by [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] and others:{{Fact|date=May 2007}} the increasing centrality of the idea of [[theme and variations]] in compositional thinking. Schoenberg argues that the Classical style was one of &quot;continuing variation&quot;, where a development was, in effect, a theme and variations with greater continuity. In any event, theme and variations replaced the [[fugue]] as the standard vehicle for improvising, and was often included, directly or indirectly, as a movement in longer instrumental works.--&gt;
Direct influence of the Baroque continued to fade: the [[figured bass]] grew less prominent as a means of holding performance together, the performance practices of the mid 18th century continued to die out. However, at the same time, complete editions of Baroque masters began to become available, and the influence of Baroque style continued to grow, particularly in the ever more expansive use of brass. Another feature of the period is the growing number of performances where the composer was not present. This led to increased detail and specificity in notation; for example, there were fewer &quot;optional&quot; parts that stood separately from the main score.

The force of these shifts became apparent with Beethoven's 3rd Symphony, given the name ''Eroica'', which is Italian for &quot;heroic&quot;, by the composer. As with Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', it may not have been the first in all of its innovations, but its aggressive use of every part of the Classical style set it apart from its contemporary works: in length, ambition, and harmonic resources.

==Classical influence on later composers==
{{See also|Tonality}}
Musical eras seldom disappear at once; instead, features are replaced over time, until the old is simply felt as &quot;old-fashioned&quot;. The Classical style did not &quot;die&quot; so much as transform under the weight of changes.

One crucial change was the shift towards harmonies centering around &quot;flatward&quot; keys: shifts in the [[subdominant]] direction. In the Classical style, major key was far more common than minor, chromaticism being moderated through the use of &quot;sharpward&quot; modulation, and sections in the minor mode were often merely for contrast. Beginning with Mozart and Clementi, there began a creeping colonization of the subdominant region. With Schubert, subdominant moves flourished after being introduced in contexts in which earlier composers would have confined themselves to dominant shifts. This introduced darker colors to music, strengthened the minor mode, and made structure harder to maintain. Beethoven contributed to this by his increasing use of the [[Interval (music)|fourth]] as a consonance, and modal ambiguity — for example, the opening of the D Minor Symphony.

[[Franz Schubert]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]], and [[John Field (composer)|John Field]] are among the most prominent in this generation of &quot;Classical Romantics&quot;, along with the young [[Felix Mendelssohn]]. Their sense of form was strongly influenced by the Classical style, and they were not yet &quot;learned&quot; (imitating rules which were codified by others), but they directly responded to works by Beethoven, Mozart, Clementi, and others, as they encountered them. The instrumental forces at their disposal were also quite &quot;Classical&quot; in number and variety, permitting similarity with Classical works.

However, the forces destined to end the hold of the Classical style gathered strength in the works of each of these composers. The most commonly cited one is harmonic innovation. However, also important is the increasing focus on having a continuous and rhythmically uniform accompanying figuration: [[Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata]] was the model for hundreds of later pieces — where the shifting movement of a rhythmic figure provides much of the drama and interest of the work, while a melody drifts above it. Greater knowledge of works, greater instrumental expertise, increasing variety of instruments, the growth of concert societies, and the unstoppable domination of the piano —which created a huge audience for sophisticated music— all contributed to the shift to the &quot;Romantic&quot; style.

Drawing the line exactly is impossible: there are sections of Mozart's works which, taken alone, are indistinguishable in harmony and orchestration from music written 80 years later, and composers continue to write in normative Classical styles into the 20th century. Even before Beethoven's death, composers such as [[Louis Spohr]] were self-described Romantics, incorporating, for example, more extravagant [[chromaticism]] in their works. However, generally the fall of Vienna as the most important musical center for orchestral composition is felt to be the occasion of the Classical style's final eclipse, along with its continuous organic development of one composer learning in close proximity to others. [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Frédéric Chopin]] visited Vienna when young, but they then moved on to other vistas. Composers such as [[Carl Czerny]], while deeply influenced by Beethoven, also searched for new ideas and new forms to contain the larger world of musical expression and performance in which they lived.

Renewed interest in the formal balance and restraint of 18th century classical music led in the early 20th century to the development of so-called [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassical]] style, which numbered [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]] among its proponents, at least at certain times in their careers.

A '''character encoding''' system consists of a [[code]] that pairs each [[character (computing)|character]] from a given repertoire with something else, such as a sequence of natural [[number]]s, [[octet (computing)|octets]] or electrical pulses, in order to facilitate the transmission of data (generally numbers and/or text) through telecommunication networks or [[Computer data storage|storage]] of [[Character (computing)|text]] in [[computer]]s.

Other terms like '''character encoding''', '''character set''' ''(charset)'', and sometimes '''character map''' or '''code page''' are used almost interchangeably, but these terms now have related but distinct meanings. See [[#General terminology|general terminology]].

==History==

Common examples of character encoding systems include [[Morse code]], the [[Baudot code]], the [[American Standard Code for Information Interchange]] ([[ASCII]]) and [[Unicode]].

[[Morse code]] was introduced in the 1840s and is used to encode each letter of the [[Latin alphabet]] and each [[Arabic numeral]] as a series of long and short presses of a [[telegraph key]]. Representations of characters encoded using Morse code varied in length.

The [[Baudot code]] was created by [[Émile Baudot]] in 1870, patented in 1874, modified by Donald Murray in 1901, and standardized by CCITT as International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2) in 1930.

[[ASCII]] was introduced in 1963 and is a 7-bit encoding scheme used to encode letters, numerals, symbols, and device [[control code]]s as fixed-length codes using [[integer]]s. 

[[IBM]]'s [[Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code]] (usually abbreviated [[EBCDIC]]) is an 8-bit encoding scheme developed in 1963.

The limitations of such sets soon became apparent, and a number of [[ad hoc|ad-hoc]] methods were developed to extend them. The need to support more [[writing system]]s for different languages, including the [[CJK characters|CJK]] family of East Asian scripts, required support for a far larger number of characters and demanded a systematic approach to character encoding rather than the previous [[ad hoc]] approaches.

Early binary repertoires include:
* [[Braille]]
* [[International maritime signal flags]]
* [[Chinese telegraph code]] ([[Hans Schjellerup]], 1869, modified 1872 and following)
*:Encoding of Chinese characters as 4-digit decimals.

== Terminology ==
===Unicode encoding model===

[[Unicode]] and its parallel standard, the ISO/IEC 10646 [[Universal Character Set]], together constitute a modern, unified character encoding. Rather than mapping characters directly to octets ([[byte]]s), they separately define what characters are available, their numbering, how those numbers are encoded as a series of &quot;code units&quot; (limited-size numbers), and finally how those units are encoded as a stream of octets. The idea behind this decomposition is to establish a universal set of characters that can be encoded in a variety of ways.&lt;ref name=utr17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr17/ |title=Unicode Technical Report #17: Unicode Character Encoding Model |date=2008-11-11 |accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; To correctly describe this model one needs more precise terms than &quot;character set&quot; and &quot;character encoding&quot;. The terms used in the modern model follow:&lt;ref name=utr17/&gt;

A '''character repertoire''' is the full set of abstract characters that a system supports. The repertoire may be closed, i.e. no additions are allowed without creating a new standard (as is the case with ASCII and most of the ISO-8859 series), or it may be open, allowing additions (as is the case with Unicode and to a limited extent the [[Windows code page]]s). The characters in a given repertoire reflect decisions that have been made about how to divide writing systems into linear information units. The basic variants of the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], and [[Cyrillic alphabet]]s, can be broken down into letters, digits, punctuation, and a few '''special characters''' like the space,{{citation needed|date=March 2010}} which can all be arranged in simple linear sequences that are displayed in the same order they are read. Even with these alphabets however [[diacritic]]s pose a complication: they can be regarded either as part of a single character containing a letter and diacritic (known in modern terminology as a precomposed character), or as separate characters. The former allows a far simpler text handling system but the latter allows any letter/diacritic combination to be used in text. Other writing systems, such as Arabic and Hebrew, are represented with more complex character repertoires due to the need to accommodate things like bidirectional text and [[glyph]]s that are joined together in different ways for different situations.

{{anchor|CCS}}
A '''coded character set''' (CCS) specifies how to represent a repertoire of characters using a number of non-negative integer codes called ''[[code point]]s''. For example, in a given repertoire, a character representing the capital letter &quot;A&quot; in the Latin alphabet might be assigned to the integer 65, the character for &quot;B&quot; to 66, and so on. A complete set of characters and corresponding integers is a coded character set. Multiple coded character sets may share the same repertoire; for example [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]] and IBM code pages 037 and 500 all cover the same repertoire but map them to different codes. In a coded character set, each code point only represents one character, i.e., a coded character set is a [[function (mathematics)|function]].

A '''character encoding form''' (CEF) specifies the conversion of a coded character set's integer codes into a set of limited-size integer ''code values'' that facilitate storage in a system that represents numbers in binary form using a fixed number of bits (i.e. practically any computer system). For example, a system that stores numeric information in 16-bit units would only be able to directly represent integers from 0 to 65,535 in each unit, but larger integers could be represented if more than one 16-bit unit could be used. This is what a CEF accommodates: it defines a way of mapping a ''single'' code ''point'' from a range of, say, 0 to 1.4 million, to a series of ''one or more'' code ''values'' from a range of, say, 0 to 65,535.

The simplest CEF system is simply to choose large enough units that the values from the coded character set can be encoded directly (one code point to one code value). This works well for coded character sets that fit in 8 bits (as most legacy non-CJK encodings do) and reasonably well for coded character sets that fit in 16 bits (such as early versions of Unicode). However, as the size of the coded character set increases (e.g. modern Unicode requires at least 21 bits/character), this becomes less and less efficient, and it is difficult to adapt existing systems to use larger code values. Therefore, most systems working with later versions of Unicode use either [[UTF-8]], which maps Unicode code points to variable-length sequences of octets, or [[UTF-16/UCS-2]], which maps Unicode code points to variable-length sequences of 16-bit words.

Next, a '''character encoding scheme''' (CES) specifies how the fixed-size integer code values should be mapped into an octet sequence suitable for saving on an octet-based file system or transmitting over an octet-based network. With Unicode, a simple character encoding scheme is used in most cases, simply specifying whether the bytes for each integer should be in big-[[endianness|endian]] or little-endian order (even this isn't needed with UTF-8). However, there are also compound character encoding schemes, which use escape sequences to switch between several simple schemes (such as [[ISO/IEC 2022]]), and compressing schemes, which try to minimise the number of bytes used per code unit (such as [[Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode|SCSU]], [[Binary Ordered Compression for Unicode|BOCU]], and [[Punycode]]). See [[comparison of Unicode encodings]] for a detailed discussion.

Finally, there may be a '''higher level protocol''' which supplies additional information that can be used to select the particular variant of a [[Unicode]] character, particularly where there are regional variants that have been 'unified' in Unicode as the same character. An example is the [[XML]] attribute xml:lang.

The Unicode model reserves the term '''character map''' for historical systems which directly assign a sequence of characters to a sequence of bytes, covering all of CCS, CEF and CES layers.&lt;ref name=utr17/&gt;

=== General terminology ===
In [[computer science]], the terms '''character encoding''', '''character map''', '''character set''' or '''code page''' were historically synonymous{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}, as the same standard would specify a repertoire of characters and how they were to be encoded into a stream of code units — usually with a single character per code unit. The terms now have related but distinct meanings, reflecting the efforts of standards bodies to use precise terminology when writing about and unifying many different encoding systems.&lt;ref name=utr17/&gt; Regardless, the terms are still used interchangeably, with ''character set'' being nearly ubiquitous.

A '''[[code page]]''' usually means a [[byte oriented]] encoding, but with emphasis to some suite of encodings (covering different scripts), where many characters share same [[code point|codes]] in all these code pages (or most). Well known code page suites are &quot;Windows&quot; (based on Windows-1252) and &quot;IBM&quot;/&quot;DOS&quot; (based on code page 437), see [[Windows code page]] for details. Most encodings referred to as code pages, but not all of them, are single byte encodings.

IBM's Character Data Representation Architecture (CDRA) designates with coded character set identifiers ([[CCSID]]s) and each of which is variously called a '''charset''', '''character set''', '''code page''', or '''CHARMAP'''.&lt;ref name=utr17/&gt;

Contrasted to [[#CCS|CCS above]], a '''character encoding''' is a map from abstract characters to [[code word]]s. A '''character set''' in [[HTTP]] (and [[MIME]]) parlance is the same as a character encoding (but not the same as CCS).

'''[[legacy system|Legacy]] encoding''' is a cliché used sometimes to characterize old character encoding, but with an ambiguity of sense. Most of its use is in the context of [[Unicode|Unicodification]], where it refers to encodings that do not cover all Unicode code points, or, more generally, using somewhat different character repertoire: several code points representing one Unicode character,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basistech.co.jp/knowledge-center/database/uc-trillium-2.ppt &quot;Processing database information using Unicode, a case study&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; or versa (see e.g. [[code page 437]]). Some sources declare an encoding to be ''legacy'' only because it preceded Unicode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=IWS-Chapter03#79e846db|publisher=[[SIL International]]|title=Character set encoding basics|work=Implementing Writing Systems: An introduction|first=Peter|last=Constable|date=2001-06-13|accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Windows code pages are usually referred to as legacy.

In [[computing]] and [[telecommunication]], a '''control [[Grapheme|character]]''' or '''non-printing character''' is a [[code point]] (a [[number]]) in a [[character encoding|character set]], that does not in itself represent a written symbol.
It is [[in-band signaling]] in the context of [[character encoding]].
All entries in the [[ASCII]] table below code 32 (technically the [[C0 and C1 control codes|C0]] control code set) and 127 are of this kind, including BEL (which is intended to cause an audible signal in the receiving terminal), SYN (which is a synchronization signal), and ENQ (a signal that is intended to trigger a response at the receiving end, to see if it is still present). The [[Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code]] (EBCDIC) character set contains 65 control codes, including all of the ASCII control codes as well as additional codes which are mostly used to control IBM peripherals. Unicode makes a distinction between Control characters ([[C0 and C1 control codes]]) versus Formatting characters (such as the [[Zero-width non-joiner]]). 

Other characters are '''printing''', '''printable''', or '''[[graphic character]]s''', except perhaps for the &quot;space&quot; character (see [[ASCII#ASCII printable characters|ASCII printable characters]]).

==History==
{{Expand section|date=January 2009}}
[[Prosigns for Morse code|Procedural signs]] in [[Morse code]] are a form of control character.

A form of control characters were introduced in the 1870 [[Baudot code]]: NUL and DEL.
The 1901 [[Murray code]] added the [[carriage return]] (CR) and [[line feed]] (LF), and other versions of the Baudot code included other control characters.

The [[bell character]] (BEL), which rang a bell to alert operators, was also an early [[teletype]] control character.

They have also been called &quot;format effectors&quot;.

==In ASCII==
The control characters in ASCII still in common use include:
* 0 ([[null character|null]], &lt;code&gt;NUL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^@&lt;/code&gt;), originally intended to be an ignored character, but now used by many [[programming language]]s to mark the end of a string.
* 7 ([[bell character|bell]], &lt;code&gt;BEL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^G&lt;/code&gt;), which may cause the device receiving it to emit a warning of some kind (usually audible).
* 8 ([[backspace]], &lt;code&gt;BS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\b&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^H&lt;/code&gt;), used either to erase the last character printed or to overprint it.
* 9 ([[tab key|horizontal tab]], &lt;code&gt;HT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\t&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^I&lt;/code&gt;), moves the printing position some spaces to the right.
* 10 ([[Newline|line feed]], &lt;code&gt;LF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^J&lt;/code&gt;), used as the end of line marker in most [[Unix|UNIX systems]] and variants.
&lt;!--* 11 ([[Tab key|vertical tab]], &lt;code&gt;VT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\v&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^K&lt;/code&gt;)--&gt;
* 12 ([[Page break|form feed]], &lt;code&gt;FF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\f&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^L&lt;/code&gt;), to cause a printer to eject paper to the top of the next page, or a video terminal to clear the screen.
* 13 ([[carriage return]], &lt;code&gt;CR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\r&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^M&lt;/code&gt;), used as the end of line marker in [[Mac OS]], [[OS-9]], [[FLEX (operating system)|FLEX]] (and variants).  A carriage return/line feed pair is used by [[CP/M]]-80 and its derivatives including [[DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and by [[Application Layer]] [[communications protocol|protocols]] such as [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]]&lt;!--since when is HTTP on AL--&gt;.
* 27 ([[escape character|escape]], &lt;code&gt;ESC&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\e&lt;/code&gt; [GCC only], &lt;code&gt;^[&lt;/code&gt;).
* 127 ([[delete character|delete]], &lt;code&gt;DEL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^?&lt;/code&gt;), originally intended to be an ignored character, but now used in some systems to erase a character.

Occasionally one might encounter modern uses of other codes, such as code 4 (End of transmission), used to end a [[Unix shell]] session or [[PostScript]] printer transmission. For the full list of control characters, see [[ASCII#ASCII control characters|ASCII]].

Even though many control characters are rarely used, the concept of sending device-control information intermixed with printable characters is so useful that device makers found a way to send hundreds of device instructions. Specifically, they used ASCII code 27 (escape), followed by a series of characters called a &quot;control sequence&quot; or &quot;[[escape sequence]]&quot;. The mechanism was invented by [[Bob Bemer]], the father of ASCII.

Typically, code 27 was sent first in such a sequence to alert the device that the following characters were to be interpreted as a control sequence rather than as plain characters, then one or more characters would follow to specify some detailed action, after which the device would go back to interpreting characters normally. For example, the sequence of code 27, followed by the printable characters &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;[2;10H&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, would cause a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] VT-102 terminal to move its [[cursor (computers)|cursor]] to the 10th cell of the 2nd line of the screen. Several standards exist for these sequences, notably [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] X3.64. But the number of non-standard variations in use is large, especially among printers, where technology has advanced far faster than any standards body can possibly keep up with.

==In Unicode==
In Unicode, &quot;Control-characters&quot; are those defined in C0 and C1 control codes. Their [[Unicode Character Properties#General Category|General Category]] is &quot;Cc&quot;. Formatting codes are distinct, in General Category &quot;Cf&quot;. The Cc control characters have no Name in Unicode. They may be indicated informally as &quot;&lt;control-001A&gt;&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[General Category Unicode 5.2, Chapter 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display==
There are a number of techniques to display non-printing characters, which may be illustrated with the [[bell character]] in [[ASCII]] encoding:
* [[Code point]]: decimal 7, hexadecimal 0x07
* An abbreviation, often three capital letters: BEL
* A special character: Unicode U+2407 (␇), &quot;symbol for bell&quot; (note that this uses the abbreviation, specially formatted)
* [[Caret notation]] in ASCII, where code point 00xxxxx is represented as a caret followed by the capital letter at code point 10xxxxx: ^G
* An [[escape sequence]], as in [[printf]] codes: &lt;tt&gt;\a&lt;/tt&gt;

==How control characters map to keyboards==
ASCII-based [[keyboard (computing)|keyboards]] have a key labelled &quot;[[control key|Control]]&quot;, &quot;Ctrl&quot;, or (rarely) &quot;Cntl&quot; which is used much like a shift key, being pressed in combination with another letter or symbol key. In one implementation, the control key generates the code 64 places below the code for the (generally) uppercase letter it is pressed in combination with (i.e., subtract 64 from ASCII code value in decimal of the (generally) uppercase letter).  The other implementation is to take the ASCII code produced by the key and [[bitwise operation|bitwise AND]] it with 63, forcing bits 6 and 7 to zero.  For example, pressing &quot;control&quot; and the letter &quot;g&quot; or &quot;G&quot; (code 103 or 71 in [[decimal|base 10]], which is 01000111 in [[Binary numeral system|binary]], produces the code 7 (Bell, 7 in base 10, or 00000111 in binary).  The NULL character (code 0) is represented by Ctrl-@, &quot;@&quot; being the code immediately before &quot;A&quot; in the ASCII character set.  For convenience, a lot of terminals accept Ctrl-Space as an alias for Ctrl-@.  In either case, this produces one of the 32 ASCII control codes between 0 and 31.  This approach is not able to represent the DEL character because of its value (code 127), but Ctrl-? is often used for this character, as subtracting 64 from a '?' gives −1, which if masked to 7 bits is 127.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20091028135111/http://geocities.com/dtmcbride/tech/charsets/ascii.html&lt;/ref&gt;

When the control key is held down, letter keys produce the same control characters regardless of the state of the [[shift key|shift]] or [[caps lock]] keys.  In other words, it does not matter whether the key would have produced an upper-case or a lower-case letter.  The interpretation of the control key with the space, graphics character, and digit keys (ASCII codes 32 to 63) vary between systems.  Some will produce the same character code as if the control key was not held down.  Other systems translate these keys into control characters when the control key is held down.  The interpretation of the control key with non-ASCII (&quot;foreign&quot;) keys also varies between systems.

Control characters are often rendered into a printable form known as [[caret notation]] by printing a caret (^) and then the ASCII character that has a value of the control character plus 64.  Control characters generated using letter keys are thus displayed with the upper-case form of the letter.  For example, ^G represents code 7, which is generated by pressing the G key when the control key is held down.

Keyboards also typically have a few single keys which produce control character codes. For example, the key labelled &quot;Backspace&quot; typically produces code 8, &quot;Tab&quot; code 9, &quot;Enter&quot; or &quot;Return&quot; code 13 (though some keyboards might produce code 10 for &quot;Enter&quot;).

Modern keyboards have many keys that do not correspond to any ASCII printable or control character, for example cursor control arrows and [[word processing]] functions.  These keyboards communicate these keys to the attached computer by one of four methods: appropriating some otherwise unused control character for the new use; using some encoding other than ASCII; using multi-character control sequences; or using an additional mechanism outside of generating characters to handle these events. &quot;Dumb&quot; [[computer terminal]]s typically use control sequences.  Keyboards attached to stand-alone [[personal computer]]s made in the 1980s typically use one (or both) of the first two methods.  Modern computer keyboards generate [[scancode]]s that identify the specific physical keys that are pressed; computer software then determines how to handle the keys that are pressed, including any of the four methods described above.

==The design purpose==
The control characters were designed to fall into a few groups: printing and display control, data structuring, transmission control, and miscellaneous.

===Printing and display control===
Printing control characters were first used to control the physical mechanism of printers, the earliest output device.  An early implementation of this idea was the [[out-of-band]] [[ASA carriage control characters]].  Later, control characters were integrated into the stream of data to be printed.
The carriage return character (CR), when sent to such a device, causes it to put the character at the edge of the paper at which writing begins (it may, or may not, also move the printing position to the next line).
The line feed character (LF/NL) causes the device to put the printing position on the next line. It may (or may not), depending on the device and its configuration, also move the printing position to the start of the next line (whichever direction is first—left in Western languages and right in Hebrew and Arabic). 
The vertical and horizontal tab characters (VT and HT/TAB) cause the output device to move the printing position to the next tab stop in the direction of reading. 
The form feed character (FF/NP) starts a new sheet of paper, and may or may not move to the start of the first line. 
The backspace character (BS) moves the printing position one character space  backwards. On printers, this is most often used so the printer can overprint characters to make other, not normally available, characters. On terminals and other electronic output devices, there are often software (or hardware) configuration choices which will allow a destruct backspace (i.e., a BS, SP, BS sequence) which erases, or a non-destructive one which does not. 
The shift in and shift out characters (SO and SI) selected alternate character sets, fonts, underlining or other printing modes. Escape sequences were often used to do the same thing. 

With the advent of [[computer terminal]]s that did not physically print on paper and so offered more flexibility regarding screen placement, erasure, and so forth, printing control codes were adapted. Form feeds, for example, usually cleared the screen, there being no new paper page to move to. More complex escape sequences were developed to take advantage of the flexibility of the new terminals, and indeed of newer printers. The concept of a control character had always been somewhat limiting, and was extremely so when used with new, much more flexible, hardware. Control sequences (sometimes implemented as escape sequences) could match the new flexibility and power and became the standard method. However, there were, and remain, a large variety of standard sequences to choose from.

===Data structuring===
The separators (File, Group, Record, and Unit: FS, GS, RS and US) were made to structure data, usually on a tape, in order to simulate [[punched card]]s.
End of medium (EM) warns that the tape (or other recording medium) is ending.
While many systems use CR/LF and TAB for structuring data, it is possible to encounter the separator control characters in data that needs to be structured.  The separator control characters are not overloaded; there is no general use of them except to separate data into structured groupings.  Their numeric values are contiguous with the space character, which can be considered a member of the group, as a word separator.

===Transmission control===
The transmission control characters were intended to structure a data stream, and to manage re-transmission or graceful failure, as needed, in the face of transmission errors.

The start of heading (SOH) character was to mark a non-data section of a data stream—the part of a stream containing addresses and other housekeeping data. The start of text character (STX) marked the end of the header, and the start of the textual part of a stream. The end of text character (ETX) marked the end of the data of a message. A widely used convention is to make the two characters preceding ETX a checksum or [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] for error-detection purposes. The end of transmission block character (ETB) was used to indicate the end of a block of data, where data was divided into such blocks for transmission purposes.

The escape character ([[escape character|ESC]]) was intended to &quot;quote&quot; the next character, if it was another control character it would print it instead of performing the control function. It is almost never used for this purpose today.

The substitute character ([[substitute character|SUB]]) was intended to request a translation of the next character from a printable character to another value, usually by setting bit 5 to zero. This is handy because some media (such as sheets of paper produced by typewriters) can transmit only printable characters. However, on MS-DOS systems with files opened in text mode, &quot;end of text&quot; or &quot;end of file&quot; is marked by this [[Control-Z|Ctrl-Z]] character, instead of the [[Control-C|Ctrl-C]] or [[End-of-transmission character|Ctrl-D]], which are common on other operating systems.

The cancel character ([[cancel character|CAN]]) signalled that the previous element should be discarded. The negative acknowledge character ([[negative-acknowledge character|NAK]]) is a definite flag for, usually, noting that reception was a problem, and, often, that the current element should be sent again.  The acknowledge character ([[acknowledge character|ACK]]) is normally used as a flag to indicate no problem detected with current element. 

When a transmission medium is half duplex (that is, it can transmit in only one direction at a time), there is usually a master station that can transmit at any time, and one or more slave stations that transmit when they have permission. The enquire character ([[Enquiry character|ENQ]]) is generally used by a master station to ask a slave station to send its next message. A slave station indicates that it has completed its transmission by sending the end of transmission character ([[end-of-transmission character|EOT]]).

The device control codes (DC1 to DC4) were originally generic, to be implemented as necessary by each device. However, a universal need in data transmission is to request the sender to stop transmitting when a receiver can't take more data right now. [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] invented a convention which used 19, (the device control 3 character ([[Software flow control|DC3]]), also known as control-S, or [[Software flow control|XOFF]]) to &quot;S&quot;top transmission, and 17, (the device control 1 character ([[Software flow control|DC1]]), aka control-Q, or [[Software flow control|XON]]) to start transmission. It has become so widely used that most don't realize it is not part of official ASCII. This technique, however implemented, avoids additional wires in the data cable devoted only to transmission management, which saves money. A sensible protocol for the use of such transmission flow control signals must be used, to avoid potential deadlock conditions, however. 

The data link escape character ([[C0 and C1 control codes|DLE]]) was intended to be a signal to the other end of a data link that the following character is a control character such as STX or ETX.  For example a packet may be structured in the following way ([[C0 and C1 control codes|DLE]]) &lt;STX&gt; &lt;PAYLOAD&gt; ([[C0 and C1 control codes|DLE]]) &lt;ETX&gt;.

===Miscellaneous codes===
Code 7 ([[bell character|BEL]]) is intended to cause an audible signal in the receiving terminal.

Many of the ASCII control characters were designed for devices of the time that are not often seen today. For example, code 22, &quot;synchronous idle&quot; ([[C0 and C1 control codes|SYN]]), was originally sent by synchronous modems (which have to send data constantly) when there was no actual data to send. (Modern systems typically use a start bit to announce the beginning of a transmitted word&amp;mdash; this is a feature of ''asynchronous'' communication.  ''Synchronous'' communication links were more often seen with mainframes, where they were typically run over corporate leased lines to connect a mainframe to another mainframe or perhaps a minicomputer.)

Code 0 (ASCII code name [[null character|NUL]]) is a special case. In paper tape, it is the case when there are no holes.  It is convenient to treat this as a ''fill'' character with no meaning otherwise.  Since the position of a NUL character has no holes punched, it can be replaced with any other character at a later time, so it was typically used to reserve space, either for correcting errors or for inserting information that would be available at a later time or in another place.

Code 127 ([[Delete character|DEL]], a.k.a. &quot;rubout&quot;) is likewise a special case. Its 7-bit code is ''all-bits-on'' in binary, which essentially erased a character cell on a [[punched tape|paper tape]] when overpunched. Paper tape was a common storage medium when ASCII was developed, with a computing history dating back to WWII code breaking equipment at [[Biuro Szyfrów]]. Paper tape became obsolete in the 1970s, so this clever aspect of ASCII rarely saw any use after that.  (However it should be noted that non-erasable [[Programmable read-only memory|Programmable ROM]]s are typically implemented as arrays of fusible elements, each representing a [[bit]], which can only be switched one way, usually from one to zero.  In such PROMs, the DEL and NUL characters can be used in the same way that they were used on punched tape: one to reserve meaningless fill bytes that can be written later, and the other to convert written bytes to meaningless fill bytes.  For PROMs that switch one to zero, the roles of NUL and DEL are reversed; also, DEL will only work with 7-bit characters, which are rarely used today; for 8-bit content, the character code 255, commonly defined as a nonbreaking space character, can be used instead of DEL.)  Some systems (such as the original Apples) converted it to a backspace.  But because its code is in the range occupied by other printable characters, and because it had no official assigned glyph, many computer equipment vendors used it as an additional printable character (often an all-black &quot;box&quot; character useful for erasing text by overprinting with ink).

Many [[file system]]s do not allow control characters in the [[filename]]s, as they may have reserved functions.

'''Carbon''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|ɑr|b|ən}}) is the [[chemical element]] with symbol '''C''' and [[atomic number]] 6. As a member of [[group 14]] on the [[periodic table]], it is [[nonmetal]]lic and [[tetravalence|tetravalent]]—making four electrons available to form [[covalent bond|covalent]] chemical bonds. There are three naturally occurring [[isotopes]], with [[Carbon-12|&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C]] and [[Carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] being stable, while [[Carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]] is [[radioactive]], decaying with a [[half-life]] of about 5730&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;isotopes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/C/isot.html|title=Carbon&amp;nbsp;– Naturally occurring isotopes|publisher=WebElements Periodic Table|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon is one of the [[Discoveries of the chemical elements|few elements known since antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemicalelements.com/show/dateofdiscovery.html |title=Periodic Table: Date of Discovery|publisher=Chemical Elements.com|accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=D2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chemistry.about.com/library/das/aa030303a.htm |title=Timeline of Element Discovery|accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;carbon&quot; comes from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''carbo'', coal.

There are several [[allotropes of carbon]] of which the best known are [[graphite]], [[diamond]], and [[amorphous carbon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;therm prop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://invsee.asu.edu/nmodules/Carbonmod/point.html |title=World of Carbon&amp;nbsp;– Interactive Nano-visulisation in Science &amp;Engineering Edukation (IN-VSEE)|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[physical properties]] of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, diamond is highly [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]], while graphite is [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and black. Diamond is among the hardest materials known, while graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek word &quot;to write&quot;). Diamond has a very low [[electrical conductivity]], while graphite is a very good [[Electrical conductor|conductor]]. Under normal conditions, diamond has the highest [[thermal conductivity]] of [[List of thermal conductivities|all known materials]]. All the allotropic forms are solids under normal conditions but graphite is the most [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|thermodynamically stable]].

All forms of carbon are highly stable, requiring high temperature to react even with oxygen. The most common [[oxidation state]] of carbon in [[inorganic compounds]] is +4, while +2 is found in [[carbon monoxide]] and other [[transition metal]] [[Metal carbonyl|carbonyl]] complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are [[limestone]]s, [[dolomite]]s and [[carbon dioxide]], but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of [[coal]], [[peat]], [[petroleum|oil]] and [[methane clathrate]]s. Carbon forms more [[chemical compound|compounds]] than any other element, with almost ten million pure [[organic compound]]s described to date, which in turn are a tiny fraction of such compounds that are theoretically possible under standard conditions.&lt;ref name=lanl&gt;{{cite web|author=Chemistry Operations|date=December 15, 2003|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html|title=Carbon|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon is the 15th [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|most abundant]] element in the Earth's crust, and the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass]] after [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], and [[oxygen]]. It is present in all known life forms, and in the human body carbon is the second most abundant element by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/elbio.html|title=Biological Abundance of Elements|publisher = The Internet Encyclopedia of Science |accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This abundance, together with the unique diversity of [[organic compounds]] and their unusual polymer-forming ability at the temperatures commonly encountered on [[Earth]], make this element the chemical basis of all known life.

==Characteristics==

The different forms or ''[[allotropes]]'' of carbon (see below) include the hardest naturally occurring substance, [[diamond]], and also one of the softest known substances, [[graphite]]. Moreover, it has an affinity for [[chemical bond|bonding]] with other small [[atom]]s, including other carbon atoms, and is capable of forming multiple stable [[covalent]] bonds with such atoms. As a result, carbon is known to form almost ten million different compounds; the large majority of all [[chemical compounds]].&lt;ref name=lanl/&gt; Carbon also has the highest [[melting point|melting]] and [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] point of all elements. At [[atmospheric pressure]] it has no melting point as its [[triple point]] is at 10.8 ± 0.2&amp;nbsp;MPa and 4600 ± 300 K,&lt;ref name=triple2/&gt;&lt;ref name=triple3/&gt; so it sublimates at about 3900&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name=&quot;triple&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Nature|volume = 276|page= 695|year=1978|doi = 10.1038/276695a0|title = The controversial carbon solid−liquid−vapour triple point|first =A.|last = Greenville Whittaker|issue=5689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://lbruno.home.cern.ch/lbruno/documents/Bibliography/LHC_Note_78.pdf|title =On Graphite Transformations at High Temperature and Pressure Induced by Absorption of the LHC Beam| author = J.M.

Carbon sublimes in a carbon arc which has a temperature of about 5800 K. Thus, irrespective of its allotropic form, carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than the highest melting point metals such as [[tungsten]] or [[rhenium]]. Although thermodynamically prone to oxidation, carbon resists oxidation more effectively than elements such as iron and copper that are weaker reducing agents at room temperature.

Carbon compounds form the basis of all known life on [[Earth]], and the [[CNO cycle|carbon-nitrogen cycle]] provides some of the energy produced by the [[Sun]] and other stars. Although it forms an extraordinary variety of compounds, most forms of carbon are comparatively unreactive under normal conditions. At standard temperature and pressure, it resists all but the strongest oxidizers. It does not react with [[sulfuric acid]], [[hydrochloric acid]], [[chlorine]] or any alkalis. At elevated temperatures carbon reacts with oxygen to form carbon oxides, and will reduce such metal oxides as iron oxide to the metal. This [[exothermic]] reaction is used in the iron and steel industry to control the carbon content of steel:

:{{chem|Fe|3|O|4}} + 4 C&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 Fe&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 CO&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt;

with [[sulfur]] to form [[carbon disulfide]] and with steam in the coal-gas reaction:
:C&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; → CO&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2(g)&lt;/sub&gt;.
Carbon combines with some metals at high temperatures to form metallic carbides, such as the iron carbide [[cementite]] in steel, and [[tungsten carbide]], widely used as an [[abrasive]] and for making hard tips for cutting tools.

===Allotropes===
{{main|Allotropes of carbon}}
[[Atomic carbon]] is a very short-lived species and, therefore, carbon is stabilized in various multi-atomic structures with different molecular configurations called [[allotropes]]. The three relatively well-known allotropes of carbon are [[amorphous carbon]], [[graphite]], and [[diamond]]. Once considered exotic, [[fullerene]]s are nowadays commonly synthesized and used in research; they include [[buckyball]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;buckyballs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nanotubes&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor=Ebbesen, TW |year=1997 |title=Carbon nanotubes—preparation and properties |publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=0849396026}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[carbon nanotube]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;nanotubes2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |editor=MS Dresselhaus, G Dresselhaus, Ph Avouris |year=2001 |title=Carbon nanotubes: synthesis, structures, properties and applications |journal=Topics in Applied Physics |volume=80| isbn = 3540410864 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[carbon nanobud]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;nanobuds&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |year=2007 |title=A novel hybrid carbon material |journal=Nature Nanotechnology |volume=2 |pages=156–161 |doi=10.1038/nnano.2007.37 |author=Nasibulin, Albert G. |pmid=18654245 |last2=Pikhitsa |first2=PV |last3=Jiang |first3=H |last4=Brown |first4=DP |last5=Krasheninnikov |first5=AV |last6=Anisimov |first6=AS |last7=Queipo |first7=P |last8=Moisala |first8=A |last9=Gonzalez |first9=D |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[carbon nanofibers|nanofibers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2007 |title=Investigations of NanoBud formation |journal=Chemical Physics Letters |volume=446 |pages=109–114 |doi=10.1016/j.cplett.2007.08.050 |author=Nasibulin, A |last2=Anisimov |first2=Anton S. |last3=Pikhitsa |first3=Peter V. |last4=Jiang |first4=Hua |last5=Brown |first5=David P. |last6=Choi |first6=Mansoo |last7=Kauppinen |first7=Esko I.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2004 |title=Synthesis and characterisation of carbon nanofibers with macroscopic shaping formed by catalytic decomposition of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over nickel catalyst |journal=Applied Catalysis A |volume=274 |pages=1–8 |doi=10.1016/j.apcata.2004.04.008 |author=Vieira, R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other exotic allotropes have also been discovered, such as [[lonsdaleite]],&lt;ref name=&quot;lonsdaletite&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |year=1967 |title=Lonsdaleite, a new hexagonal polymorph of diamond |journal=Nature |volume=214 |pages=587–589 |doi=10.1038/214587a0 |first = Frondel|last = Clifford |last2=Marvin |first2=Ursula B. |issue=5088}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[glassy carbon]],&lt;ref name=&quot;glassy carbon&quot;/&gt; [[carbon nanofoam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1999 |title=Structural analysis of a carbon foam formed by high pulse-rate laser ablation |journal=Applied Physics A-Materials Science &amp; Processing |volume=69 |pages=S755–S758 |doi=10.1007/s003390051522 |author=Rode, A.V. |last2=Hyde |first2=S.T. |last3=Gamaly |first3=E.G. |last4=Elliman |first4=R.G. |last5=McKenzie |first5=D.R. |last6=Bulcock |first6=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[linear acetylenic carbon]].&lt;ref name=LAC&gt;Carbyne and Carbynoid Structures Series: Physics and Chemistry of Materials with Low-Dimensional Structures, Vol. 21 Heimann, R.B.; Evsyukov, S.E.; Kavan, L.

The [[amorphous]] form is an assortment of carbon atoms in a non-crystalline, irregular, glassy state, which is essentially [[graphite]] but not held in a crystalline macrostructure. It is present as a powder, and is the main constituent of substances such as [[charcoal]], [[lampblack]] ([[soot]]) and [[activated carbon]].At normal pressures carbon takes the form of [[graphite]], in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused [[hexagon]]al rings, just like those in [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The polymorphism of elements and compounds |last=Jenkins |first=Edgar |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1973 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=XNYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP8&amp;dq=.At+normal+pressures+carbon+takes+the+form+of+graphite,+in+which+each+atom+is+bonded+trigonally+to+three+others+in+a+plane+composed+of+fused+hexagonal+rings,+just+like+those+in+aromatic+hydrocarbons.&amp;ots=gvobLXhbxM&amp;sig=Z2Sw4n1MTXu2EihCgzvZvlUKPr0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting network is 2-dimensional, and the resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak [[van der Waals force]]s.&lt;!-- no evidence for upper case van der Waals; see [[Talk:Van der Waals#Van should be capitalized unless preceded by first name]] rebuttal --&gt; This gives graphite its softness and its [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleaving]] properties (the sheets slip easily past one another). Because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a [[Delocalized electron|π-cloud]], graphite conducts [[electricity]], but only in the plane of each [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] sheet. This results in a lower bulk [[electrical conductivity]] for carbon than for most [[metals]]. The delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature.&lt;br/&gt;[[Image:Eight Allotropes of Carbon.png|thumb|300px|Some allotropes of carbon: a) [[diamond]]; b) [[graphite]]; c) [[lonsdaleite]]; d–f) [[fullerene]]s (C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;540&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;); g) [[amorphous carbon]]; h) [[carbon nanotube]].]]

At very high pressures carbon forms the more compact allotrope [[diamond]], having nearly twice the density of graphite. Here, each atom is bonded [[tetrahedron|tetrahedrally]] to four others, thus making a 3-dimensional network of puckered six-membered rings of atoms. Diamond has the same [[cubic crystal system|cubic structure]] as [[silicon]] and [[germanium]] and because of the strength of the carbon-carbon [[chemical bond|bonds]], it is the hardest naturally occurring substance [[Mohs scale|in terms of resistance to scratching]]. Contrary to the popular belief that ''&quot;[[Diamonds Are Forever (novel)|diamonds are forever]]&quot;'', they are in fact thermodynamically unstable under normal conditions and transform into [[graphite]].&lt;ref name=&quot;therm prop&quot;/&gt; But due to a high activation energy barrier, the transition into graphite is so extremely slow at room temperature as to be unnoticeable.*Under some conditions, carbon crystallizes as [[lonsdaleite]]. This form has a [[hexagonal]] [[crystal]] lattice where all atoms are covalently bonded. Therefore, all properties of lonsdaleite are close to those of diamond.&lt;ref name=&quot;lonsdaletite&quot;/&gt;

[[Fullerene]]s have a graphite-like structure, but instead of purely [[hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] packing, they also contain pentagons (or even heptagons) of carbon atoms, which bend the sheet into spheres, ellipses or cylinders. The properties of fullerenes (split into [[buckyball]]s, [[carbon nanotube|buckytube]]s and [[nanobud]]s) have not yet been fully analyzed and represent an intense area of research in [[nanomaterials]]. The names ''&quot;fullerene&quot;'' and ''&quot;buckyball&quot;'' are given after [[Buckminster Fuller|Richard Buckminster Fuller]], popularizer of [[geodesic dome]]s, which resemble the structure of fullerenes. The buckyballs are fairly large molecules formed completely of carbon bonded trigonally, forming [[spheroid]]s (the best-known and simplest is the soccerball-shaped structure C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; [[buckminsterfullerene]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;buckyballs&quot;/&gt; Carbon nanotubes are structurally similar to buckyballs, except that each atom is bonded trigonally in a curved sheet that forms a hollow [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nanotubes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nanotubes2&quot;/&gt; Nanobuds were first published in 2007 and are hybrid bucky tube/buckyball materials (buckyballs are covalently bonded to the outer wall of a nanotube) that combine the properties of both in a single structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;nanobuds&quot;/&gt;

Of the other discovered allotropes, [[carbon nanofoam]] is a [[ferromagnetic]] allotrope discovered in 1997. It consists of a low-density cluster-assembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web, in which the atoms are bonded trigonally in six- and seven-membered rings. It is among the lightest known solids, with a density of about 2&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newton.ex.ac.uk/aip/physnews.678.html#1 |title=Carbon Nanofoam is the World's First Pure Carbon Magnet |accessdate=2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[glassy carbon]] contains a high proportion of closed [[porosity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;glassy carbon&quot;/&gt; But unlike normal graphite, the graphitic layers are not stacked like pages in a book, but have a more random arrangement. [[Linear acetylenic carbon]]&lt;ref name=LAC/&gt; has the chemical structure&lt;ref name=&quot;LAC&quot;/&gt; -(C:::C)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;-. Carbon in this modification is linear with ''sp'' [[orbital hybridization]], and is a [[polymer]] with alternating single and triple bonds. This type of carbyne is of considerable interest to [[nanotechnology]] as its [[Young's modulus]] is forty times that of the hardest known material&amp;nbsp;– diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Harder than Diamond: Determining the Cross-Sectional Area and Young's Modulus of Molecular Rods|author=Lior Itzhaki|doi=10.1002/ange.200502448|journal=Angew.

Carbon is the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant chemical element]] in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon is abundant in the [[Sun]], [[star]]s, [[comet]]s, and in the [[celestial body's atmosphere|atmospheres]] of most [[planet]]s. Some [[meteorite]]s contain microscopic diamonds that were formed when the [[solar system]] was still a [[protoplanetary disk]]. Microscopic diamonds may also be formed by the intense pressure and high temperature at the sites of meteorite impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark |last=Mark |year=1987 |title=Meteorite Craters |publisher=University of Arizona Press |isbn=0816509026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In combination with [[oxygen]] in [[carbon dioxide]], carbon is found in the Earth's atmosphere (approximately 810&amp;nbsp;[[gigatonne]]s of carbon) and dissolved in all water bodies (approximately 36,000&amp;nbsp;gigatonnes of carbon). Around 1,900&amp;nbsp;gigatonnes of carbon are present in the [[biosphere]]. [[Hydrocarbons]] (such as [[coal]], [[petroleum]], and [[natural gas]]) contain carbon as well—[[coal]] [[Mineral resource classification|&quot;reserves&quot; (not &quot;resources&quot;)]] amount to around 900&amp;nbsp;gigatonnes, and [[oil reserves]] around 150&amp;nbsp;gigatonnes. Proven sources of natural gas are about 175 [[tetrillion]] cubic metres (representing about 105 gigatonnes carbon), but it is estimated that there are also about 900 tetrillion cubic metres of &quot;unconventional&quot; gas such as [[shale gas]], representing about 540 gigatonnes of carbon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20627641.100-wonderfuel-welcome-to-the-age-of-unconventional-gas.html?full=true &quot;Wonderfuel: Welcome to the age of unconventional gas&quot;] by Helen Knight, ''[[New Scientist]]'', 12 June 2010, pp. 44–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
Carbon is also locked up as [[methane]] and [[methane hydrates]] in polar regions. It is estimated that at least 1,400 [[gigatonne|Gt]] of carbon is in this form just in (and under) the submarine [[permafrost]] of the [[Siberian Shelf]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Shakhova, I. Semiletov, A.

Carbon is a major component in very large masses of [[carbonate]] rock ([[limestone]], [[dolomite]], [[marble]] and so on).

[[Coal]] is a significant commercial source of mineral carbon; [[anthracite]] containing 92–98% carbon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Coal Mining Technology: Theory and Practice| author = R. Stefanenko| publisher = Society for Mining Metallurgy|year = 1983| isbn = 0895204045}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the largest source (4,000&amp;nbsp;Gt, or 80% of coal, gas and oil reserves) of carbon in a form suitable for use as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = James|last = Kasting |year=1998 |title=The Carbon Cycle, Climate, and the Long-Term Effects of Fossil Fuel Burning |journal=Consequences: the Nature and Implication of Environmental Change|volume = 4|url = http://gcrio.org/CONSEQUENCES/vol4no1/carbcycle.html |issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphite is found in large quantities in the [[United States]] (mostly in [[New York]] and [[Texas]]), [[Russia]], [[Mexico]], [[Greenland]], and [[India]].

Natural diamonds occur in the rock [[kimberlite]], found in ancient [[volcano|volcanic]] &quot;necks,&quot; or &quot;pipes&quot;. Most diamond deposits are in [[Africa]], notably in [[South Africa]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], and [[Sierra Leone]]. There are also deposits in [[Arkansas]], [[Canada]], the Russian [[Arctic]], [[Brazil]] and in Northern and Western [[Australia]].

Diamonds are now also being recovered from the ocean floor off the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. However, though diamonds are found naturally, about 30% of all industrial diamonds used in the U.S. are now made synthetically.

Carbon-14 is formed in upper layers of the troposphere and the stratosphere, at altitudes of 9–15&amp;nbsp;km, by a reaction that is precipitated by [[cosmic ray]]s. [[Thermal neutron]]s are produced that collide with the nuclei of nitrogen-14, forming carbon-14 and a proton.

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of carbon}}
[[Isotope]]s of carbon are [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] that contain six [[proton]]s plus a number of [[neutron]]s (varying from 2 to 16). Carbon has two stable, naturally occurring [[isotope]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;isotopes&quot;/&gt; The isotope [[carbon-12]] (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C) forms 98.93% of the carbon on Earth, while [[carbon-13]] (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) forms the remaining 1.07%.&lt;ref name=&quot;isotopes&quot;/&gt; The concentration of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C is further increased in biological materials because biochemical reactions discriminate against &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last =Gannes|first =Leonard Z.|last2 =Del Rio|first2 =Carlos Martı́nez|last3 =Koch|first3 =Paul|title =Natural Abundance Variations in Stable Isotopes and their Potential Uses in Animal Physiological Ecology|journal =Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology&amp;nbsp;– Part A: Molecular &amp; Integrative Physiology|volume =119|issue =3|pages =725–737|year= 1998|doi =10.1016/S1095-6433(98)01016-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) adopted the isotope [[carbon-12]] as the basis for [[atomic weight]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/base_units/ |title=Official SI Unit definitions |accessdate=2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identification of carbon in [[NMR]] experiments is done with the isotope &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C.

[[Carbon-14]] (&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C) is a naturally occurring [[radioisotope]] which occurs in trace amounts on Earth of up to 1 part per [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]] (0.0000000001%), mostly confined to the atmosphere and superficial deposits, particularly of [[peat]] and other organic materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Tom|date=March 1, 2006|url=http://www.llnl.gov/str/March06/Brown.html|title=Carbon Goes Full Circle in the Amazon|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|accessdate=2007-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This isotope decays by 0.158 MeV [[beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; emission]]. Because of its relatively short [[half-life]] of 5730&amp;nbsp;years, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C is virtually absent in ancient rocks, but is created in the [[upper atmosphere]] (lower [[stratosphere]] and upper [[troposphere]]) by interaction of [[nitrogen]] with [[cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bowman, S. |first=S. |last=Bowman |year=1990 |title=Interpreting the past: Radiocarbon dating |publisher=British Museum Press |isbn=0-7141-2047-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abundance of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C in the [[atmosphere]] and in living organisms is almost constant, but decreases predictably in their bodies after death. This principle is used in [[radiocarbon dating]], invented in 1949, which has been used extensively to determine the age of carbonaceous materials with ages up to about 40,000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Libby WF |last=Libby |first=WF |year=1952 |title=Radiocarbon dating |publisher=Chicago University Press and references therein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are 15 known isotopes of carbon and the shortest-lived of these is &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;C which decays through [[proton emission]] and [[alpha decay]] and has a half-life of 1.98739x10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt; [[Second|s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://barwinski.net/isotopes/query_select.php |title=Use query for carbon-8 |accessdate=2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exotic &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;C exhibits a [[nuclear halo]], which means its [[radius]] is appreciably larger than would be expected if the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] were a [[sphere]] of constant [[density]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/286/5437/28?ck=nck |title=Beaming Into the Dark Corners of the Nuclear Kitchen |accessdate=2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation in stars===
{{main|Triple-alpha process|CNO cycle}}
Formation of the carbon atomic nucleus requires a nearly simultaneous triple collision of [[alpha particle]]s ([[helium]] nuclei) within the core of a [[giant star|giant]] or [[supergiant]] star. This happens in conditions of &gt; 100 megakelvin temperature and helium concentration that the rapid expansion and cooling of the early universe prohibited, and therefore no significant carbon was created during the [[Big Bang]]. Instead, the interiors of stars in the [[H-R diagram|horizontal branch]] transform three helium nuclei into carbon by means of this [[triple-alpha process]]. In order to be available for formation of life as we know it, this carbon must then later be scattered into space as dust, in [[supernovae|supernova]] explosions, as part of the material which later forms second, third-generation star systems which have planets accreted from such dust. The [[Solar System]] is one such [[Metallicity|third-generation star]] system.

One of the fusion mechanisms powering stars is the [[carbon-nitrogen cycle]].

Rotational transitions of various isotopic forms of carbon monoxide (for example, &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;CO, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CO, and C&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O) are detectable in the [[submillimetre astronomy|submillimeter]] regime, and are used in the study of [[Star formation|newly forming stars]] in [[molecular clouds]].

===Carbon cycle===
{{main|Carbon cycle}}
[[File:Carbon cycle-cute diagram.svg|thumb|300px||Diagram of the carbon cycle. The black numbers indicate how much carbon is stored in various reservoirs, in billions of tons (&quot;GtC&quot; stands for gigatons of carbon; figures are circa 2004). The purple numbers indicate how much carbon moves between reservoirs each year. The sediments, as defined in this diagram, do not include the ~70 million GtC of carbonate rock and kerogen.]]
Under terrestrial conditions, conversion of one element to another is very rare. Therefore, the amount of carbon on Earth is effectively constant. Thus, processes that use carbon must obtain it somewhere and dispose of it somewhere else. The paths that carbon follows in the environment make up the [[carbon cycle]]. For example, plants draw [[carbon dioxide]] out of their environment and use it to build biomass, as in [[carbon respiration]] or the [[Calvin cycle]], a process of [[carbon fixation]]. Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, whereas some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide. The carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop; for example, some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans; dead plant or animal matter may become [[petroleum]] or [[coal]], which can burn with the release of carbon, should bacteria not consume it.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal|journal = Science|year = 2000|volume = 290|issue = 5490|pages = 291–296|doi = 10.1126/science.290.5490.291|title = The Global Carbon Cycle: A Test of Our Knowledge of Earth as a System|author = P.

Carbon has the ability to form very long chains of interconnecting C-C bonds. This property is called [[catenation]]. Carbon-carbon bonds are strong, and stable. This property allows carbon to form an almost infinite number of compounds; in fact, there are more known carbon-containing compounds than all the compounds of the other chemical elements combined except those of hydrogen (because almost all organic compounds contain hydrogen too).

The simplest form of an organic molecule is the [[hydrocarbon]]—a large family of [[organic molecule]]s that are composed of [[hydrogen]] atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms. Chain length, side chains and [[functional group]]s all affect the properties of organic molecules. By [[IUPAC]]'s definition, all the other organic compounds are functionalized compounds of hydrocarbons.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Carbon occurs in all known [[organic material|organic]] life and is the basis of [[organic chemistry]]. When united with [[hydrogen]], it forms various [[hydrocarbon]]s which are important to industry as [[refrigerants]], [[lubricants]], [[solvents]], as chemical feedstock for the manufacture of [[plastic]]s and [[petrochemicals]] and as [[fossil fuel]]s.

When combined with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including [[sugar]]s, [[lignan]]s, [[chitin]]s, [[alcohol]]s, [[fat]]s, and aromatic [[ester]]s, [[carotenoids]] and [[terpenes]]. With [[nitrogen]] it forms [[alkaloid]]s, and with the addition of sulfur also it forms [[antibiotic]]s, [[amino acid]]s, and [[rubber]] products. With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, it forms [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], the chemical-code carriers of life, and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), the most important energy-transfer molecule in all living cells.

===Inorganic compounds===
{{main|Compounds of carbon}}

Commonly carbon-containing compounds which are associated with minerals or which do not contain hydrogen or fluorine, are treated separately from classical [[organic compounds]]; however the definition is not rigid (see reference articles above). Among these are the simple oxides of carbon. The most prominent oxide is [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}). This was once the principal constituent of the [[paleoatmosphere]], but is a minor component of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=JS Levine, TR Augustsson and M Natarajan |year=1982 |title=The prebiological paleoatmosphere: stability and composition |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume= 12 |pages=245–259 |doi=10.1007/BF00926894 |issue=3 |bibcode=1982OrLi...12..245L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissolved in [[water (molecule)|water]], it forms [[carbonic acid]] ({{chem|H|2|C||O|3}}), but as most compounds with multiple single-bonded oxygens on a single carbon it is unstable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = T.

Some important minerals are carbonates, notably [[calcite]]. [[Carbon disulfide]] ({{chem|C||S|2}}) is similar.

The other common oxide is [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). It is formed by incomplete combustion, and is a colorless, odorless gas. The molecules each contain a triple bond and are fairly [[polar molecule|polar]], resulting in a tendency to bind permanently to hemoglobin molecules, displacing oxygen, which has a lower binding affinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haldane J. |year=1895 |title=The action of carbonic oxide on man |journal=Journal of Physiology |volume=18 |pages=430–462|pmid=16992272 |issue=5–6 |pmc=1514663}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2003 |title=The clinical toxicology of carbon monoxide |journal=Toxicology |number=187 |pages=25–38 |doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(03)00005-2 |author=Gorman, D |volume=187 |pmid=12679050 |last2=Drewry |first2=A |last3=Huang |first3=YL |last4=Sames |first4=C |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyanide]] (CN&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;), has a similar structure, but behaves much like a [[halide]] ion ([[pseudohalogen]]).

A few carbides are covalent lattices, like [[Silicon carbide|carborundum]] (SiC), which resembles [[diamond]].

===Organometallic compounds===
{{main|Organometallic chemistry}}
Organometallic compounds by definition contain at least one carbon-metal bond. A wide range of such compounds exist; major classes include simple alkyl-metal compounds (for example, [[tetraethyllead]]), η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-alkene compounds (for example, [[Zeise's salt]]), and η&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-allyl compounds (for example, [[allylpalladium chloride dimer]]); [[metallocene]]s containing cyclopentadienyl ligands (for example, [[ferrocene]]); and [[transition metal carbene complex]]es. Many [[metal carbonyl]]s exist (for example, [[tetracarbonylnickel]]); some workers consider the [[carbon monoxide]] ligand to be purely inorganic, and not organometallic.

While carbon is understood to exclusively form four bonds, an interesting compound containing an octahedral hexacoordinated carbon atom has been reported. The cation of the compound is [(Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PAu)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;C]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. This phenomenon has been attributed to the [[aurophilicity]] of the gold ligands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1002/anie.198815441|author = Franz Scherbaum, Andreas Grohmann, Brigitte Huber, Carl Krüger, Hubert Schmidbaur|journal = [[Angew.

==History and etymology==
[[Image:Antoine lavoisier.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Antoine Lavoisier]] in his youth]]
The [[English language|English]] name ''carbon'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''carbo'' for coal and charcoal,&lt;ref&gt;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and from hence also comes the [[French language|French]] ''charbon'', meaning charcoal. In [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], the names for carbon are ''Kohlenstoff'', ''koolstof'' and ''kulstof'' respectively, all literally meaning [[coal]]-substance.

Carbon was discovered in prehistory and was known in the forms of [[soot]] and [[charcoal]] to the earliest [[human]] [[civilization]]s. Diamonds were known probably as early as 2500&amp;nbsp;BCE in China, while carbon in the form of [[charcoal]] was made around Roman times by the same chemistry as it is today, by heating wood in a [[pyramid]] covered with [[clay]] to exclude air.&lt;ref name=ancient_China&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4555235.stm|title = Chinese made first use of diamond|publisher = BBC News|date= 17 May 2005|accessdate = 2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=C |title=Carbonium/Carbon at Elementymology &amp; Elements Multidict |author= Peter van der Krogt |last=van der Krogt |first=Peter |accessdate=2010-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Carl Wilhelm Scheele from Familj-Journalen1874.png|thumb|upright|[[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]]]]
In 1722, [[René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur]] demonstrated that iron was transformed into steel through the absorption of some substance, now known to be carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=R-A Ferchault de Réaumur |last=Ferchault de Réaumur |first=R-A |year=1722 |title=L'art de convertir le fer forgé en acier, et l'art d'adoucir le fer fondu, ou de faire des ouvrages de fer fondu aussi finis que le fer forgé (English translation from 1956) |location=Paris, Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1772, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] showed that diamonds are a form of carbon; when he burned samples of charcoal and diamond and found that neither produced any water and that both released the same amount of [[carbon dioxide]] per [[gram]].
In 1779,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadaconnects.ca/chemistry/1009 |title=Carbon|publisher=Canada Connects|accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] showed that graphite, which had been thought of as a form of [[lead]], was instead identical with charcoal but with a small admixture of iron, and that it gave &quot;aerial acid&quot; (his name for carbon dioxide) when oxidized with nitric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Senese, Fred|url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/inorganic/faq/discovery-of-carbon.shtml|title=Who discovered carbon?|publisher=Frostburg State University |accessdate=2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1786, the French scientists [[Claude Louis Berthollet]], [[Gaspard Monge]] and C. A. Vandermonde confirmed that graphite was mostly carbon by oxidizing it in oxygen in much the same way Lavoisier had done with diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Federico Giolitti|year=1914
|title=The Cementation of Iron and Steel|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company, inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some iron again was left, which the French scientists thought was necessary to the graphite structure. However, in their publication they proposed the name ''carbone'' (Latin ''carbonum'') for the element in graphite which was given off as a gas upon burning graphite. Antoine Lavoisier then listed '''carbon''' as an [[chemical element|element]] in his 1789 textbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Senese,Fred|date = 200-09-09|url = http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/inorganic/faq/discovery-of-carbon.shtml|title=Who discovered carbon?|publisher=Frostburg State University|accessdate=2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
===Graphite===
{{main|Graphite}}
Commercially viable natural deposits of graphite occur in many parts of the world, but the most important sources economically are in [[China]], [[India]], [[Brazil]], and [[North Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/graphite/myb1-2006-graph.pdf USGS Minerals Yearbook: Graphite, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Graphite deposits are of [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] origin, found in association with [[quartz]], [[mica]] and [[feldspar]]s in schists, [[gneiss]]es and metamorphosed [[sandstone]]s and [[limestone]] as [[lens (geology)|lenses]] or [[vein (geology)|veins]], sometimes of a meter or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in [[Borrowdale]], [[Cumberland]], [[England]] were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, [[pencil]]s were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood. Today, smaller deposits of graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on water.

According to the [[USGS]], world production of natural graphite in 2006 was 1.03 million tons and in 2005 was 1.04 million tons (revised), of which the following major exporters produced: China produced 720,000&amp;nbsp;tons in both 2006 and 2005, Brazil 75,600&amp;nbsp;tons in 2006 and 75,515&amp;nbsp;tons in 2005 (revised), Canada 28,000&amp;nbsp;tons in both years, and Mexico (amorphous) 12,500&amp;nbsp;tons in 2006 and 12,357&amp;nbsp;tons in 2005 (revised). In addition, there are two specialist producers: Sri Lanka produced 3,200&amp;nbsp;tons in 2006 and 3,000&amp;nbsp;tons in 2005 of lump or vein graphite, and Madagascar produced 15,000&amp;nbsp;tons in both years, a large portion of it &quot;crucible grade&quot; or very large flake graphite. Some other producers produce very small amounts of &quot;crucible grade&quot;.

According to the [[USGS]], U.S. (synthetic) graphite electrode production in 2006 was 132,000&amp;nbsp;tons valued at $495 million and in 2005 was 146,000&amp;nbsp;tons valued at $391 million, and high-modulus graphite (carbon) fiber production in 2006 was 8,160&amp;nbsp;tons valued at $172 million and in 2005 was 7,020&amp;nbsp;tons valued at $134 million.

===Diamond===
{{main|Diamond}}
[[Image:Diamond output2.PNG|thumb|right|Diamond output in 2005]]

The diamond supply chain is controlled by a limited number of powerful businesses, and is also highly concentrated in a small number of locations around the world (see figure).

Only a very small fraction of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care has to be taken in order to prevent larger diamonds from being destroyed in this process and subsequently the particles are sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of [[X-ray fluorescence]], after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of [[X-ray]]s became commonplace, the separation was done with grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than the other minerals in the ore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page = 223| title = The nature of diamonds| author = G.

Diamond production of primary deposits (kimberlites and lamproites) only started in the 1870s after the discovery of the Diamond fields in South Africa. Production has increased over time and now an accumulated total of 4.5 billion carats have been mined since that date.&lt;ref name=giasummer2007&gt;{{cite journal| last = Janse|first= A. J.

There are also commercial deposits being actively mined in the [[Northwest Territories]] of [[Canada]], [[Siberia]] (mostly in [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia territory]], for example [[Mir Mine|Mir pipe]] and [[Udachnaya pipe]]), Brazil, and in Northern and Western [[Australia]]. Diamond prospectors continue to search the globe for diamond-bearing [[kimberlite]] and [[lamproite]] pipes.

Carbon is essential to all known living systems, and without it life as we know it could not exist (see [[alternative biochemistry]]). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the [[fossil fuel]] [[methane]] gas and [[crude oil]] (petroleum). Crude oil is used by the [[petrochemical industry]] to produce, amongst others, [[gasoline]] and [[kerosene]], through a [[distillation]] process, in [[refinery|refineries]]. [[Cellulose]] is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of [[cotton]], [[linen]], and [[hemp]]. [[Cellulose]] is mainly used for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include [[wool]], [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]] and [[silk]]. [[Plastics]] are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.

The uses of carbon and its compounds are extremely varied. It can form [[alloys]] with [[iron]], of which the most common is [[carbon steel]]. [[Graphite]] is combined with [[clay]]s to form the 'lead' used in [[pencil]]s used for [[writing]] and [[drawing]]. It is also used as a [[lubricant]] and a [[pigment]], as a molding material in [[glass]] manufacture, in [[electrodes]] for dry [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and in [[electroplating]] and [[electroforming]], in [[brush]]es for [[electric motors]] and as a [[neutron moderator]] in [[nuclear reactors]].

[[Charcoal]] is used as a drawing material in [[art]]work, for [[grilling]], and in many other uses including iron smelting. Wood, coal and oil are used as [[fuel]] for production of energy and space heating. Gem quality [[diamond]] is used in jewelry, and [[Industrial diamond]]s are used in drilling, cutting and polishing tools for machining metals and stone. Plastics are made from fossil hydrocarbons, and [[carbon fiber]], made by [[pyrolysis]] of synthetic [[polyester]] [[fiber]]s is used to reinforce plastics to form advanced, lightweight [[composite materials]]. [[Carbon fiber]] is made by pyrolysis of extruded and stretched filaments of [[polyacrylonitrile]] (PAN) and other organic substances. The crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend on the type of starting material, and on the subsequent processing. Carbon fibers made from PAN have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite, but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. The result is fibers with higher [[specific strength|specific tensile strength]] than steel.&lt;ref name=cantwell&gt;{{cite journal|author=W.J. Cantwell, J Morton|title=The impact resistance of composite materials&amp;nbsp;– a review|journal=Composites|year=1991|volume=22|issue=5|pages=347–62|doi=10.1016/0010-4361(91)90549-V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carbon black]] is used as the black [[pigment]] in [[printing]] [[ink]], artist's oil paint and water colours, [[carbon paper]], automotive finishes, [[India ink]] and [[laser printer]] [[toner]]. [[Carbon black]] is also used as a [[Filler (materials)|filler]] in [[rubber]] products such as tyres and in [[plastic]] compounds. [[Activated charcoal]] is used as an [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]] and [[adsorbent]] in [[Filter (chemistry)|filter]] material in applications as diverse as [[gas masks]], [[water purification]] and [[kitchen]] [[extractor hood]]s and in medicine to [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorb]] toxins, poisons, or gases from the [[gastrointestinal tract|digestive system]]. Carbon is used in [[Redox|chemical reduction]] at high temperatures. [[Coke (fuel)|Coke]] is used to reduce iron ore into iron. [[Case hardening]] of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. [[Carbide]]s of [[silicon carbide|silicon]], [[tungsten carbide|tungsten]], [[boron carbide|boron]] and [[titanium carbide|titanium]], are among the hardest known materials, and are used as [[abrasives]] in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make up most of the materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic [[textiles]] and [[leather]], and almost all of the interior surfaces in the [[built environment]] other than glass, stone and metal.

===Diamonds===
The [[diamond]] industry can be broadly separated into two basically distinct categories: one dealing with gem-grade diamonds and another for industrial-grade diamonds. While a large trade in both types of diamonds exists, the two markets act in dramatically different ways.

A large trade in [[Gemstone|gem]]-grade diamonds exists. Unlike [[precious metal]]s such as [[gold]] or [[platinum]], gem diamonds do not trade as a [[commodity]]: there is a substantial mark-up in the sale of diamonds, and there is not a very active market for resale of diamonds.

The market for industrial-grade diamonds operates much differently from its gem-grade counterpart. Industrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity, making many of the gemological characteristics of diamond, including clarity and color, mostly irrelevant. This helps explain why 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20,000&amp;nbsp;kg annually), unsuitable for use as gemstones and known as ''[[bort]]'', are destined for industrial use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Turning And Mechanical Manipulation| author = Ch. Holtzapffel| publisher= Charles Holtzapffel| year = 1856}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to mined diamonds, [[synthetic diamond]]s found industrial applications almost immediately after their invention in the 1950s; another 3 billion carats (600&amp;nbsp;[[Tonne|metric tons]]) of synthetic diamond is produced annually for industrial use.&lt;ref name=usgs&gt;{{cite web| url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/diamond/| accessdate = 2009-05-05| title = Industrial Diamonds Statistics and Information| publisher = United States Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant industrial use of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing. Most uses of diamonds in these technologies do not require large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds that are gem-quality except for their small size, can find an industrial use. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author =R. T. Coelho |title =The application of polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tool materials when drilling and reaming aluminum-based alloys including MMC| doi =10.1016/0890-6955(95)93044-7 |journal =International journal of machine tools &amp; manufacture |volume =35 |year =1995 |page = 761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for [[Pressure experiment|high pressure experiments]] (see [[diamond anvil cell]]), high-performance [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], and limited use in specialized [[window]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| pages = 303–334| title = Materials for infrared windows and domes: properties and performance| author = D.

Nusinovich| title = Introduction to the physics of gyrotrons| publisher = JHU Press|year = 2004|isbn = 0801879213| page = 229}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the continuing advances being made in the production of synthetic diamonds, future applications are beginning to become feasible. Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a [[semiconductor]] suitable to build [[integrated circuit|microchip]]s from, or the use of diamond as a [[heat sink]] in [[electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = 120 W CW output power from monolithic AlGaAs (800 nm) laser diode array mounted on diamond heatsink|author = M. Sakamoto, J. G. Endriz, D. R. Scifres|journal = Electronics Letters|year = 1992|volume = 28|issue = 2|pages = 197–199|doi = 10.1049/el:19920123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==
[[File:Worker at carbon black plant2.jpg|thumb|upright|Worker at [[carbon black]] plant in [[Sunray, Texas]] (photo by [[John Vachon]], 1942)]]Pure carbon has extremely low [[toxicity]] to humans and can be handled and even ingested safely in the form of graphite or charcoal. It is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack, even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract, for example. Consequently once it enters into the body's tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely. [[Carbon black]] was probably one of the first pigments to be used for [[tattoo]]ing, and [[Ötzi the Iceman]] was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200&amp;nbsp;years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Leopold|last = Dorfer|year = 1998|title = 5200-year old acupuncture in Central Europe?|journal = Science|volume = 282|pages = 242–243|doi = 10.1126/science.282.5387.239f|pmid = 9841386|last2 = Moser|first2 = M|last3 = Spindler|first3 = K|last4 = Bahr|first4 = F|last5 = Egarter-Vigl|first5 = E|last6 = Dohr|first6 = G|issue = 5387}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, inhalation of coal dust or soot ([[carbon black]]) in large quantities can be dangerous, irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive [[lung]] disease [[coalworker's pneumoconiosis]]. Similarly, diamond dust used as an abrasive can do harm if ingested or inhaled. Microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel engine exhaust fumes, and may accumulate in the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Donaldson|first = K|year = 2001|title = Ultrafine particles|journal = Occupational and Environmental Medicine|volume = 58|pages = 211–216|url = http://oem.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/58/3/211|doi = 10.1136/oem.58.3.211|pmid = 11171936|last2 = Stone|first2 = V|last3 = Clouter|first3 = A|last4 = Renwick|first4 = L|last5 = MacNee|first5 = W|issue = 3|pmc = 1740105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these examples, the harmful effects may result from contamination of the carbon particles, with organic chemicals or heavy metals for example, rather than from the carbon itself.

Carbon generally has low toxicity to almost all [[life on Earth]], however to some creatures it can still be toxic, for instance carbon nanoparticles are a deadly toxins to [[Drosophila]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/08/090807103921.htm Carbon Nanoparticles Toxic To Adult Fruit Flies But Benign To Young] ScienceDaily (Aug. 17, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon may also burn vigorously and brightly in the presence of air at high temperatures, as in the [[Windscale fire]], which was caused by sudden release of stored [[Wigner energy]] in the graphite core. Large accumulations of coal, which have remained inert for hundreds of millions of years in the absence of oxygen, may [[spontaneous combustion|spontaneously combust]] when exposed to air, for example in coal mine waste tips.

The great variety of carbon compounds include such lethal poisons as [[tetrodotoxin]], the [[lectin]] [[ricin]] from seeds of the [[castor oil plant]] ''[[Ricinus communis]]'', [[Cyanide poisoning|cyanide]] (CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[Carbon monoxide poisoning|carbon monoxide]]; and such essentials to life as [[glucose]] and [[protein]].

'''Computer data storage''', often called '''storage''' or '''memory''', refers to [[computer]] components and [[Data storage device|recording media]] that retain digital [[data (computing)|data]] used for computing for some interval of time. Computer data storage provides one of the core functions of the modern computer, that of information retention. It is one of the fundamental components of all modern computers, and coupled with a [[central processing unit]] (CPU, a processor), implements the basic computer model used since the 1940s.

In contemporary usage, ''memory'' usually refers to a form of [[semiconductor]] storage known as [[random-access memory]], typically [[DRAM]] (Dynamic-RAM) but ''memory'' can refer to other forms of fast but temporary storage. Similarly, ''storage'' today more commonly refers to storage devices and their media not directly accessible by the [[CPU]] ([[Computer_data_storage#Secondary_storage|secondary]] or [[Computer_data_storage#Tertiary_storage|tertiary storage]]) &amp;mdash; typically [[hard disk drive]]s, [[optical disc]] drives, and other devices slower than RAM but more permanent.&lt;ref&gt;'''Storage''' as defined in Microsoft Computing Dictionary, 4th Ed. (c)1999 or in The Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE Standard Terms, 7th Ed., (c) 2000. &lt;/ref&gt; Historically, ''memory'' has been called ''main memory'', ''real storage'' or ''internal memory'' while storage devices have been referred to as ''secondary storage'', ''external memory'' or ''auxiliary/peripheral storage''. 

The contemporary distinctions are helpful, because they are also fundamental to the architecture of computers in general. The distinctions also reflect an important and significant technical difference between memory and mass storage devices, which has been blurred by the historical usage of the term ''storage''. Nevertheless, this article uses the traditional nomenclature.

Many different forms of storage, based on various natural phenomena, have been invented. So far, no practical universal storage medium exists, and all forms of storage have some drawbacks. Therefore a computer system usually contains several kinds of storage, each with an individual purpose.

A [[Computer|digital computer]] represents [[data]] using the [[binary numeral system]]. Text, numbers, pictures, audio, and nearly any other form of information can be converted into a string of [[bit]]s, or binary digits, each of which has a value of 1 or 0. The most common unit of storage is the [[byte]], equal to 8 bits. A piece of information can be handled by any computer whose storage space is large enough to accommodate ''the binary representation of the piece of information'', or simply [[data (computing)|data]]. For example, using eight million bits, or about one [[megabyte]], a typical computer could store a short novel.

Traditionally the most important part of every computer is the [[central processing unit]] (CPU, or simply a processor), because it actually operates on data, performs any calculations, and controls all the other components.

Without a significant amount of memory, a computer would merely be able to perform fixed operations and immediately output the result. It would have to be reconfigured to change its behavior. This is acceptable for devices such as desk [[calculator]]s or simple [[digital signal processing|digital signal processors]]. [[von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] machines differ in that they have a memory in which they store their operating [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]]s and data. Such computers are more versatile in that they do not need to have their hardware reconfigured for each new program, but can simply be [[computer programming|reprogrammed]] with new in-memory instructions; they also tend to be simpler to design, in that a relatively simple processor may keep [[program state|state]] between successive computations to build up complex procedural results. Most modern computers are von Neumann machines.

In practice, almost all computers use a variety of memory types, organized in a [[memory hierarchy|storage hierarchy]] around the CPU, as a trade-off between performance and cost. Generally, the lower a storage is in the hierarchy, the lesser its [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and the greater its access [[latency (engineering)|latency]] is from the CPU. This traditional division of storage to primary, secondary, tertiary and off-line storage is also guided by cost per bit.

== Hierarchy of storage ==
[[File:Computer storage types.svg|thumb|right|350px|Various forms of storage, divided according to their distance from the [[central processing unit]]. The fundamental components of a general-purpose computer are [[arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic and logic unit]], [[control unit|control circuitry]], storage space, and [[input/output]] devices. Technology and capacity as in common [[home computer]]s around 2005.]]

=== Primary storage === &lt;!-- Note that additional DIRECT links point to this section by its name. --&gt;
:''Direct links to this section: Primary storage, Main memory, Internal Memory.''  &lt;!-- A *lot* of people will need a direct to link to the subject, and mostly they don't know about # magic. Inform them about the possibility, or they will split this article in no-time. --&gt;

'''Primary storage''' (or '''main memory''' or '''internal memory'''), often referred to simply as '''memory''', is the only one directly accessible to the CPU. The CPU continuously reads instructions stored there and executes them as required. Any data actively operated on is also stored there in uniform manner.

Historically, [[History of computing hardware|early computers]] used [[delay line memory|delay lines]], [[Williams tube]]s, or rotating [[drum memory|magnetic drums]] as primary storage. By 1954, those unreliable methods were mostly replaced by [[magnetic core memory]]. Core memory remained dominant until the 1970s, when advances in [[integrated circuit]] technology allowed [[semiconductor memory]] to become economically competitive.&lt;!-- Please DO NOT EXPAND above text! Change but no expand any further. Anyone desiring to know more types, let it be [[twister memory]] or [[bubble memory]] etc, will click the History link. Do not confuse other readers. --&gt;

This led to modern [[random-access memory]] (RAM). It is small-sized, light, but quite expensive at the same time. (The particular types of RAM used for primary storage are also [[volatile memory|volatile]], i.e. they lose the information when not powered). 

As shown in the diagram, traditionally there are two more sub-layers of the primary storage, besides main large-capacity RAM:
* [[Processor register]]s are located inside the processor. Each register typically holds a [[Word (data type)|word]] of data (often 32 or 64 bits). CPU instructions instruct the [[arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic and logic unit]] to perform various calculations or other operations on this data (or with the help of it). Registers are the fastest of all forms of computer data storage.
* [[CPU cache|Processor cache]] is an intermediate stage between ultra-fast registers and much slower main memory. It's introduced solely to increase performance of the computer. Most actively used information in the main memory is just duplicated in the cache memory, which is faster, but of much lesser capacity. On the other hand it is much slower, but much larger than processor registers. Multi-level [[Memory hierarchy|hierarchical cache]] setup is also commonly used&amp;mdash;''primary cache'' being smallest, fastest and located inside the processor; ''secondary cache'' being somewhat larger and slower. &lt;!-- Please DO NOT EXPAND above text, especially with L1/L2/etc variants - reader can always click the link. --&gt;

Main memory is directly or indirectly connected to the central processing unit via a ''memory bus''. It is actually two buses (not on the diagram): an [[address bus]] and a [[Bus (computing)|data bus]]. The CPU firstly sends a number through an address bus, a number called [[memory address]], that indicates the desired location of data. Then it reads or writes the data itself using the data bus. Additionally, a [[memory management unit]] (MMU) is a small device between CPU and RAM recalculating the actual memory address, for example to provide an abstraction of [[virtual memory]] or other tasks.&lt;!-- No more about pretty advanced concept of virtualization needed here, or readers will freak out. Yeah MMU can do much more - they will click the link. --&gt;

As the RAM types used for primary storage are volatile (cleared at start up), a computer containing only such storage would not have a source to read instructions from, in order to start the computer. Hence, [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile primary storage]] containing a small startup program ([[BIOS]]) is used to [[Bootstrapping (computing)|bootstrap]] the computer, that is, to read a larger program from non-volatile ''secondary'' storage to RAM and start to execute it. A non-volatile technology used for this purpose is called ROM, for [[read-only memory]] (the terminology may be somewhat confusing as most ROM types are also capable of ''random access'').&lt;!-- yes there are other things besides BIOS, those will be easily accessed with [[bootstrap]] link --&gt;

Many types of &quot;ROM&quot; are not literally ''read only'', as updates are possible; however it is slow and memory must be erased in large portions before it can be re-written. Some [[embedded system]]s run programs directly from ROM (or similar), because such programs are rarely changed. Standard computers do not store non-rudimentary programs in ROM, rather use large capacities 
of secondary storage, which is non-volatile as well, and not as costly. &lt;!-- mention NVRAM here, and risk severe confusion - as this is secondary memory, yet RAM descendent --&gt;

Recently, ''primary storage'' and ''secondary storage'' in some uses refer to what was historically called, respectively, ''secondary storage'' and ''tertiary storage''.&lt;ref&gt;http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/topics/0,295493,sid5_tax298620,00.html &quot;Primary Storage or Storage Hardware&quot; (shows usage of term &quot;primary storage&quot; meaning &quot;hard disk storage&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary storage=== &lt;!-- Note that additional DIRECT links point to this section by its name. --&gt;
[[File:Hard disk platter reflection.jpg|thumb|A [[hard disk drive]] with protective cover removed.]]

'''Secondary storage''' (also known as external memory or auxiliary storage), differs from primary storage in that it is not directly accessible by the CPU. The computer usually uses its [[input/output]] channels to access secondary storage and transfers the desired data using [[Data buffer|intermediate area]] in primary storage. Secondary storage does not lose the data when the device is powered down&amp;mdash;it is non-volatile. Per unit, it is typically also two orders of magnitude less expensive than primary storage. Consequently, modern computer systems typically have two orders of magnitude more secondary storage than primary storage and data is kept for a longer time there.

In modern computers, [[hard disk drive]]s are usually used as secondary storage. The time taken to access a given byte of information stored on a hard disk is typically a few thousandths of a second, or milliseconds. By contrast, the time taken to access a given byte of information stored in random access memory is measured in billionths of a second, or nanoseconds. This illustrates the  significant access-time difference which distinguishes solid-state memory from rotating magnetic storage devices: hard disks are typically about a million times slower than memory. Rotating [[Optical disc drive|optical storage]] devices, such as [[Compact Disc|CD]] and [[DVD]] drives, have even longer access times. With disk drives, once the disk read/write head reaches the proper placement and the data of interest rotates under it, subsequent data on the track are very fast to access. As a result, in order to hide the initial seek time and rotational latency, data is transferred to and from disks in large contiguous blocks.

When data reside on disk, block access to hide latency offers a ray of hope in designing efficient [[external memory algorithms]]. Sequential or block access on disks is orders of magnitude faster than random access, and many sophisticated paradigms have been developed to design efficient algorithms based upon sequential and block access . Another way to reduce the I/O bottleneck is to use multiple disks in parallel in order to increase the bandwidth between primary and secondary memory.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. S. Vitter]], ''[http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/jsv/Papers/Vit.IO_book.pdf Algorithms and Data Structures for External Memory]'', Series on Foundations and Trends in Theoretical Computer Science, now Publishers, Hanover, MA,
2008, ISBN 978-1-60198-106-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other examples of secondary storage technologies are: [[flash memory]] (e.g. [[USB flash drive]]s or keys), [[floppy disk]]s, [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]], [[Punched tape|paper tape]], [[punched card]]s, standalone [[RAM disk]]s, and [[Iomega Zip drive]]s. 

The secondary storage is often formatted according to a [[file system]] format, which provides the abstraction necessary to organize data into [[Computer file|files]] and [[Folder (computing)|directories]], providing also additional information (called [[metadata]]) describing the owner of a certain file, the access time, the access permissions, and other information.

Most computer [[operating system]]s use the concept of [[virtual memory]], allowing utilization of more primary storage capacity than is physically available in the system. As the primary memory fills up, the system moves the least-used chunks (''[[page (computing)|pages]]'') to secondary storage devices (to a [[Paging|swap file]] or [[paging|page file]]), retrieving them later when they are needed. As more of these retrievals from slower secondary storage are necessary, the more the overall system performance is degraded.

=== Tertiary storage === &lt;!-- Note that additional DIRECT links point to this section by its name. --&gt;
[[File:StorageTek Powderhorn tape library.jpg|thumb|Large [[tape library]]. Tape cartridges placed on shelves in the front, robotic arm moving in the back. Visible height of the library is about 180 cm.]]

'''Tertiary storage''' or '''tertiary memory''',&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1994/CSD-94-847.pdf A thesis on Tertiary storage] &lt;/ref&gt; provides a third level of storage. Typically it involves a robotic mechanism which will ''mount'' (insert) and ''dismount'' removable mass storage media into a storage device according to the system's demands; this data is often copied to secondary storage before use. It is primarily used for archiving rarely accessed information since it is much slower than secondary storage (e.g. 5–60 seconds vs. 1-10 milliseconds). This is primarily useful for extraordinarily large data stores, accessed without human operators. Typical examples include [[tape library|tape libraries]] and [[optical jukebox]]es.

When a computer needs to read information from the tertiary storage, it will first consult a catalog [[database]] to determine which tape or disc contains the information. Next, the computer will instruct a [[industrial robot|robotic arm]] to fetch the medium and place it in a drive. When the computer has finished reading the information, the robotic arm will return the medium to its place in the library.

=== Off-line storage === &lt;!-- Note that additional DIRECT links point to this section by its name. --&gt;
'''Off-line storage''' is a computer data storage on a medium or a device that is not under the control of a [[central processing unit|processing unit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document

It must be inserted or connected by a human operator before a computer can access it again. Unlike tertiary storage, it cannot be accessed without human interaction.

[[Online and offline|Off-line]] storage is used to [[Data transmission|transfer information]], since the detached medium can be easily physically transported. Additionally, in case a disaster, for example a fire, destroys the original data, a medium in a remote location will probably be unaffected, enabling [[disaster recovery]]. Off-line storage increases general [[information security]], since it is physically inaccessible from a computer, and data confidentiality or integrity cannot be affected by computer-based attack techniques. Also, if the information stored for archival purposes is accessed seldom or never, off-line storage is less expensive than tertiary storage.

In modern personal computers, most secondary and tertiary storage media are also used for off-line storage. Optical discs and flash memory devices are most popular, and to much lesser extent removable hard disk drives. In enterprise uses, magnetic tape is predominant. Older examples are floppy disks, Zip disks, or punched cards.

== Characteristics of storage ==
[[File:DDR RAM-2.jpg|thumb|250px|A 1GB DDR [[Random-access memory|RAM]] memory module (detail)]]

Storage technologies at all levels of the storage hierarchy can be differentiated by evaluating certain core characteristics as well as measuring characteristics specific to a particular implementation. These core characteristics are volatility, mutability, accessibility, and addressibility. For any particular implementation of any storage technology, the characteristics worth measuring are capacity and performance.

=== Volatility ===
; [[Non-volatile memory]] : Will retain the stored information even if it is not constantly supplied with electric power. It is suitable for long-term storage of information.
&lt;!-- This is too much information for this section and is redundant to information already in sections on types of storage
In 1950s and 1960s primary storage was often in the form of [[magnetic core memory]], which is non-volatile. The introduction of low-cost (volatile) semiconductor RAM in the late 1960s rendered magnetic core obsolete, and most non-volatile memory took the form of magnetic tapes, or magnetic disks, or (from the 1980s) of optical or magneto-optical media. All of these are several orders of magnitude too slow for use as primary storage, so non-volatile memory became associated with secondary, tertiary, and off-line storage.  More recently these technologies have been joined by [[flash RAM]], which is much closer in speed to dynamic RAM (though still much slower), but has a number of limitations that make it unsuitable for use as primary storage.
--&gt;
; [[Volatile memory]] : Requires constant power to maintain the stored information. The fastest memory technologies of today are volatile ones (not a universal rule). Since primary storage is required to be very fast, it predominantly uses volatile memory.

=== Differentiation ===
; [[Dynamic random access memory]] : A form of volatile memory which also requires the stored information to be periodically re-read and re-written, or [[memory refresh|refreshed]], otherwise it would vanish.
; [[Static random access memory|Static memory]] : A form of volatile memory similar to DRAM with the exception that it never needs to be refreshed as long as power is applied. (It loses its content if power is removed).

=== Mutability ===
; Read/write storage or mutable storage : Allows information to be overwritten at any time. A computer without some amount of read/write storage for primary storage purposes would be useless for many tasks. Modern computers typically use read/write storage also for secondary storage.
; Read only storage : Retains the information stored at the time of manufacture, and '''write once storage''' ([[Write Once Read Many]]) allows the information to be written only once at some point after manufacture. These are called '''immutable storage'''. Immutable storage is used for tertiary and off-line storage. Examples include [[CD-ROM]] and [[CD-R]].
; Slow write, fast read storage : Read/write storage which allows information to be overwritten multiple times, but with the write operation being much slower than the read operation. Examples include [[CD-RW]] and [[flash memory]].

=== Accessibility ===
; [[Random access]] : Any location in storage can be accessed at any moment in approximately the same amount of time. Such characteristic is well suited for primary and secondary storage.
; [[Sequential access]] : The accessing of pieces of information will be in a serial order, one after the other; therefore the time to access a particular piece of information depends upon which piece of information was last accessed. Such characteristic is typical of off-line storage.

=== Addressability ===
; Location-addressable : Each individually accessible unit of information in storage is selected with its numerical [[memory address]]. In modern computers, location-addressable storage usually limits to primary storage, accessed internally by computer programs, since location-addressability is very efficient, but burdensome for humans.
; [[file system|File addressable]] : Information is divided into ''[[computer file|files]]'' of variable length, and a particular file is selected with [[human-readable]] directory and file names. The underlying device is still location-addressable, but the [[operating system]] of a computer provides the file system [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] to make the operation more understandable. In modern computers, secondary, tertiary and off-line storage use file systems.
; [[content-addressable memory|Content-addressable]] : Each individually accessible unit of information is selected based on the basis of (part of) the contents stored there. Content-addressable storage can be implemented using [[computer software|software]] (computer program) or [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]] (computer device), with hardware being faster but more expensive option. Hardware content addressable memory is often used in a computer's [[CPU cache]].

=== Capacity ===
; Raw capacity : The total amount of stored information that a storage device or medium can hold. It is expressed as a quantity of [[bit]]s or [[byte]]s (e.g. 10.4 [[megabyte]]s).
; [[Memory storage density]] : The compactness of stored information. It is the storage capacity of a medium divided with a unit of length, area or volume (e.g. 1.2 megabytes per square inch).

=== Performance ===
; [[Latency (engineering)|Latency]] : The time it takes to access a particular location in storage. The relevant [[units of measurement|unit of measurement]] is typically [[1 E-9 s|nanosecond]] for primary storage, [[millisecond]] for secondary storage, and [[second]] for tertiary storage. It may make sense to separate read latency and write latency, and in case of sequential access storage, minimum, maximum and average latency.
; [[Throughput]] : The rate at which information can be read from or written to the storage. In computer data storage, throughput is usually expressed in terms of megabytes per second or MB/s, though [[bit rate]] may also be used. As with latency, read rate and write rate may need to be differentiated. Also accessing media sequentially, as opposed to randomly, typically yields maximum throughput.

=== Energy use ===
* Storage devices that reduce fan usage, automatically shut-down during inactivity, and low power hard drives can reduce energy consumption 90 percent. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springlightcfl.com/consumer/energy_savings_calculator.aspx Energy Savings Calculator] and [http://www.simpletech.com/content/eco-friendly-redrive Fabrik website] &lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamental storage technologies ==
As of 2008, the most commonly used data storage technologies are semiconductor, magnetic, and optical, while paper still sees some limited usage.  Some other fundamental storage technologies have also been used in the past or are proposed for development.

=== Semiconductor ===
'''[[Semiconductor memory]]''' uses [[semiconductor]]-based [[integrated circuit]]s to store information. A semiconductor memory chip may contain millions of tiny [[transistor]]s or [[capacitor]]s. Both ''volatile'' and ''non-volatile'' forms of semiconductor memory exist. In modern computers, primary storage almost exclusively consists of dynamic volatile semiconductor memory or [[dynamic random access memory]]. Since the turn of the century, a type of non-volatile semiconductor memory known as [[flash memory]] has steadily gained share as off-line storage for home computers. Non-volatile semiconductor memory is also used for secondary storage in various advanced electronic devices and specialized computers.

=== Magnetic ===
{{Magnetic storage media}}

'''[[Magnetic storage]]''' uses different patterns of [[magnetization]] on a [[magnetism|magnetically]] coated surface to store information. Magnetic storage is ''non-volatile''. The information is accessed using one or more read/write heads which may contain one or more recording transducers. A read/write head only covers a part of the surface so that the head or medium or both must be moved relative to another in order to access data. In modern computers, magnetic storage will take these forms:
* [[Disk storage|Magnetic disk]] 
** [[Floppy disk]], used for off-line storage
** [[Hard disk drive]], used for secondary storage
* [[Magnetic tape data storage]], used for tertiary and off-line storage

In early computers, magnetic storage was also used for primary storage in a form of [[Drum memory|magnetic drum]], or [[Magnetic core memory|core memory]], [[core rope memory]], [[thin-film memory]], [[twistor memory]] or [[bubble memory]]. Also unlike today, magnetic tape was often used for secondary storage.

=== Optical ===
{{Optical storage media}}

'''[[Optical storage]]''', the typical [[optical disc]], stores information in deformities on the surface of a circular disc and reads this information by illuminating the surface with a [[laser diode]] and observing the reflection. Optical disc storage is ''non-volatile''. The deformities may be permanent (read only media ), formed once (write once media) or reversible (recordable or read/write media). The following forms are currently in common use:&lt;ref&gt; The [http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html DVD FAQ] is a comprehensive reference of DVD technologies. &lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Compact Disc|CD]], [[CD-ROM]], [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc|BD-ROM]]: Read only storage, used for mass distribution of digital information (music, video, computer programs)
* [[CD-R]], [[DVD-R]], [[DVD+R]], [[Blu-ray Disc recordable|BD-R]]: Write once storage, used for tertiary and off-line storage
* [[CD-RW]], [[DVD-RW]], [[DVD+RW]], [[DVD-RAM]], [[Blu-ray Disc recordable|BD-RE]]: Slow write, fast read storage, used for tertiary and off-line storage
* [[Ultra Density Optical]] or UDO is similar in capacity to [[Blu-ray Disc recordable|BD-R or BD-RE]] and is slow write, fast read storage used for tertiary and off-line storage.

'''[[Magneto-optical drive|Magneto-optical disc storage]]''' is optical disc storage where the magnetic state on a [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] surface stores information. The information is read optically and written by combining magnetic and optical methods. Magneto-optical disc storage is ''non-volatile'', ''sequential access'', slow write, fast read storage used for tertiary and off-line storage.

'''[[3D optical data storage]]''' has also been proposed.

=== Paper ===
{{Paper data storage media}}

'''[[Paper data storage]]''', typically in the form of [[punched tape|paper tape]] or [[punched card]]s, has long been used to store information for automatic processing, particularly before general-purpose computers existed. Information was recorded by punching holes into the paper or cardboard medium and was read mechanically (or later optically) to determine whether a particular location on the medium was solid or contained a hole.
A few technologies allow people to make marks on paper that are easily read by machine—these are widely used for tabulating votes and grading standardized tests. [[Barcode]]s made it possible for any object that was to be sold or transported to have some computer readable information securely attached to it.

===Uncommon===
; Vacuum tube memory : A [[Williams tube]] used a [[cathode ray tube]], and a [[Selectron tube]] used a large [[vacuum tube]] to store information. These primary storage devices were short-lived in the market, since Williams tube was unreliable and Selectron tube was expensive.

; Electro-acoustic memory : [[Delay line memory]] used [[Longitudinal wave|sound wave]]s in a substance such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]] to store information. Delay line memory was dynamic volatile, cycle sequential read/write storage, and was used for primary storage.

; [[Optical tape]] : is a medium for optical storage generally consisting of a long and narrow strip of plastic onto which patterns can be written and from which the patterns can be read back. It shares some technologies with cinema film stock and optical discs, but is compatible with neither. The motivation behind developing this technology was the possibility of far greater storage capacities than either magnetic tape or optical discs.

; [[Phase-change memory]] : uses different mechanical phases of [[Phase Change Material]] to store information in an X-Y addressable matrix, and reads the information by observing the varying [[electrical resistance]] of the material. Phase-change memory would be non-volatile, random access read/write storage, and might be used for primary, secondary and off-line storage. Most rewritable and many write once optical disks already use phase change material to store information.

; [[Holographic data storage]] : stores information optically inside [[crystal]]s or [[photopolymer]]s. Holographic storage can utilize the whole volume of the storage medium, unlike optical disc storage which is limited to a small number of surface layers. Holographic storage would be non-volatile, sequential access, and either write once or read/write storage. It might be used for secondary and off-line storage. See [[Holographic Versatile Disc]] (HVD).

; [[Molecular memory]] : stores information in [[polymer]] that can store electric charge. Molecular memory might be especially suited for primary storage. The theoretical storage capacity of molecular memory is 10 terabits per square inch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090219141438.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related technologies ==
=== Network connectivity ===
A secondary or tertiary storage may connect to a computer utilizing [[computer network]]s.
This concept does not pertain to the primary storage, which is shared between multiple processors in a much lesser degree.
* '''[[Direct-attached storage]]''' (DAS) is a traditional mass storage, that does not use any network. This is still a most popular approach. This term was coined lately, together with NAS and SAN.
* '''[[Network-attached storage]]''' (NAS) is mass storage attached to a computer which another computer can access at file level over a [[local area network]], a private [[wide area network]], or in the case of [[File hosting service|online file storage]], over the [[Internet]]. NAS is commonly associated with the [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] and [[Server Message Block|CIFS/SMB]] protocols.
* '''[[Storage area network]]''' (SAN) is a specialized network, that provides other computers with storage capacity. The crucial difference between NAS and SAN is the former presents and manages file systems to client computers, whilst the latter provides access at block-addressing (raw) level, leaving it to attaching systems to manage data or file systems within the provided capacity. SAN is commonly associated with [[Fibre Channel]] networks.

=== Robotic storage ===
Large quantities of individual magnetic tapes, and optical or magneto-optical discs may be stored in robotic tertiary storage devices. In tape storage field they are known as [[tape library|tape libraries]], and in optical storage field [[optical jukebox]]es, or optical disk libraries per analogy. Smallest forms of either technology containing just one drive device are referred to as [[autoloader (data storage device)|autoloaders]] or [[autochanger]]s.

Robotic-access storage devices may have a number of slots, each holding individual media, and usually one or more picking robots that traverse the slots and load media to built-in drives. The arrangement of the slots and picking devices affects performance. Important characteristics of such storage are possible expansion options: adding slots, modules, drives, robots. Tape libraries may have from 10 to more than 100,000 slots, and provide [[terabyte]]s or [[petabyte]]s of near-line information. Optical jukeboxes are somewhat smaller solutions, up to 1,000 slots.

Robotic storage is used for [[backup]]s, and for high-capacity archives in imaging, medical, and video industries. [[Hierarchical storage management]] is a most known archiving strategy of automatically ''migrating'' long-unused files from fast hard disk storage to libraries or jukeboxes. If the files are needed, they are ''retrieved'' back to disk.

In a [[chemical reaction]], '''chemical equilibrium''' is the state in which the [[concentration]]s of the reactants and products have no net change with time. Usually, this state  results when the forward reaction proceeds at the same rate as the [[Reversible reaction|reverse reaction]]. The [[reaction rate]]s of the forward and reverse reactions are generally not zero but, being equal, there are no net changes in the concentrations of the reactant and product. This process is called [[dynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name=aj/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=chemical equilibrium|file=C01023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==

[[File:Burette.svg|thumb|right|100px|A [[burette]], an apparatus for carrying out e.g. acid-base [[titration]], is an important part of equilibrium chemistry.]]
The concept of chemical equilibrium was developed after [[Berthollet]] (1803) found that some [[chemical reaction]]s are [[Reversible reaction|reversible]]. For any reaction mixture to exist at equilibrium, the [[reaction rate|rates]] of the forward and backward (reverse) reactions are equal. In the following [[chemical equation]] with arrows pointing both ways to indicate equilibrium, A and B are [[reactant]] chemical species, S and T are product species, and [[Alpha (letter)|α]], [[Beta (letter)|β]], [[sigma|σ]], and [[tau|τ]] are the [[stoichiometric coefficient]]s of the respective reactants and products:
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha A + \beta B \rightleftharpoons \sigma S + \tau T&lt;/math&gt;

The equilibrium position of a reaction is said to lie &quot;far to the right&quot; if, at equilibrium, nearly all the reactants are consumed. Conversely the equilibrium position is said to be &quot;far to the left&quot; if hardly any product is formed from the reactants.

[[Cato Maximilian Guldberg|Guldberg]] and [[Peter Waage|Waage]] (1865), building on Berthollet’s ideas, proposed the [[law of mass action]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{forward reaction rate} = k_+ {A}^\alpha{B}^\beta \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{backward reaction rate} = k_{-} {S}^\sigma{T}^\tau \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where A, B, S and T are [[activity (chemistry)|active masses]] and k&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; and k&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; are [[rate constant]]s. Since at equilibrium forward and backward rates are equal:

:&lt;math&gt; k_+ \left\{ A \right\}^\alpha \left\{B \right\}^\beta = k_{-} \left\{S \right\}^\sigma\left\{T \right\}^\tau \,&lt;/math&gt;

and the ratio of the rate constants is also a constant, now known as an [[equilibrium constant]].
:&lt;math&gt;K=\frac{k_+}{k_-}=\frac{\{S\}^\sigma \{T\}^\tau } {\{A\}^\alpha \{B\}^\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

By convention the products form the [[numerator]].
However, the [[law of mass action]] is valid only for concerted one-step reactions that proceed through a single [[transition state]] and is '''not valid in general''' because [[reaction rate#Rate equation|rate equations]] do not, in general, follow the [[stoichiometry]] of the reaction as Guldberg and Waage had proposed (see, for example, [[nucleophilic aliphatic substitution]] by S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 or reaction of [[hydrogen]] and [[bromine]] to form [[hydrogen bromide]]). Equality of forward and backward reaction rates, however, is a [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary condition]] for chemical equilibrium, though it is not [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|sufficient]] to explain why equilibrium occurs.

Despite the failure of this derivation, the equilibrium constant for a reaction is indeed a constant, independent of the activities of the various species involved, though it does depend on temperature as observed by the [[van 't Hoff equation]]. Adding a [[catalyst]] will affect both the forward reaction and the reverse reaction in the same way and will not have an effect on the equilibrium constant. The catalyst will speed up both reactions thereby increasing the speed at which equilibrium is reached.&lt;ref name=aj&gt;Atkins, Peter W and Jones, Loretta  ''Chemical Principles: The Quest for Insight'' 2nd Ed. ISBN 0716799030&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chemistry: Matter and Its Changes'' James E. Brady , Fred Senese 4th Ed. ISBN 0-471-21517-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the macroscopic equilibrium concentrations are constant in time reactions do occur at the molecular level. For example, in the case of [[acetic acid]] dissolved in water and forming [[acetate]] and [[hydronium]] ions,
:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{unicode|⇌}} CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
a proton may hop from one molecule of acetic acid on to a water molecule and then on to an acetate anion to form another molecule of acetic acid and leaving the number of acetic acid molecules unchanged. This is an example of [[dynamic equilibrium]]. Equilibria, like the rest of thermodynamics, are statistical phenomena, averages of microscopic behavior.

'''[[Le Chatelier's principle]]''' (1884) gives an idea of the behavior of an equilibrium system when changes to its reaction conditions occur. ''If a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the position of equilibrium moves to partially reverse the change''. For example, adding more S from the outside will cause an excess of products, and the system will try to counteract this by increasing the reverse reaction and pushing the equilibrium point backward (though the equilibrium constant will stay the same).

If [[mineral acid]] is added to the acetic acid mixture, increasing the concentration of hydronium ion, the amount of dissociation must decrease as the reaction is driven to the left in accordance with this principle. This can also be deduced from the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction:
:&lt;math&gt;K=\frac{\{CH_3CO_2^-\}\{H_3O^+\}} {\{CH_3CO_2H\}}&lt;/math&gt;
If {H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;} increases {CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H} must increase and {CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;} must decrease. The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is left out as it is a pure liquid and its concentration is undefined.

A quantitative version is given by the [[reaction quotient]].

[[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. W. Gibbs]] suggested in 1873 that equilibrium is attained when the [[chemical potential|Gibbs energy]] of the system is at its minimum value (assuming the reaction is carried out under constant pressure). What this means is that the derivative of the Gibbs energy with respect to [[reaction coordinate]] (a measure of the [[extent of reaction]] that has occurred, ranging from zero for all reactants to a maximum for all products) vanishes, signalling a [[stationary point]]. This derivative is usually called, for certain technical reasons, the Gibbs energy change.&lt;ref name=a&gt;Atkins, Peter W. and Julio de Paula ''Physical Chemistry'', 4th Edition, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim 2006, ISBN 978-3-527-31546-8&lt;/ref&gt; This criterion is both necessary and sufficient. If a mixture is not at equilibrium, the liberation of the excess Gibbs energy (or [[Helmholtz energy]] at constant volume reactions) is the “driving force” for the composition of the mixture to change until equilibrium is reached. The equilibrium constant can be related to the standard [[Gibbs energy]] change for the reaction by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta_rG^\ominus = -RT \ln K_{eq} 
&lt;/math&gt;

where R is the [[universal gas constant]] and T the [[temperature]].

When the reactants are [[solution|dissolved]] in a medium of high [[ionic strength]] the quotient of [[activity coefficient]]s may be taken to be constant. In that case the '''concentration quotient''', K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;K_c=\frac{[S]^\sigma [T]^\tau } {[A]^\alpha [B]^\beta}&lt;/math&gt;
where [A] is the [[concentration]] of A, etc., is independent of the [[analytical concentration]] of the reactants. For this reason, equilibrium constants for [[solution]]s are usually [[Determination of equilibrium constants|determined]] in media of high ionic strength. K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; varies with ionic strength, temperature and pressure (or volume). Likewise K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; for gases depends on [[partial pressure]]. These constants are easier to measure and encountered in high-school chemistry courses.

==Thermodynamics==

The relationship between the Gibbs energy and the equilibrium constant can be found by considering chemical potentials.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Peter W. Physical Chemistry, third edition, Oxford University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
At constant temperature and pressure the function '''G''' [[Gibbs free energy]] for the reaction, depends only with the [[extent of reaction]]: '''ξ''' and can only decrease according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. It means that the derivative of '''G''' with '''ξ''' must be negative if the reaction happens; at the equilibrium the derivative being equal to zero.
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac {dG}{d\xi}\right)_{T,p} = 0~&lt;/math&gt;: equilibrium

At constant volume, one must consider the [[Helmholtz free energy]] for the reaction: '''A'''.

In this article only the constant pressure case is considered. The constant volume case is important in [[geochemistry]] and [[atmospheric chemistry]] where pressure variations are significant. Note that, if reactants and products were in standard state (completely pure), then there would be no reversibility and no equilibrium. The mixing of the products and reactants contributes a large entropy (known as [[entropy of mixing]]) to states containing equal mixture of products and reactants. The combination of the standard Gibbs energy change and the Gibbs energy of mixing determines the equilibrium state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schultz|first1=Mary Jane|title=Why Equilibrium? Understanding Entropy of Mixing|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=76|pages=1391|year=1999|doi=10.1021/ed076p1391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clugston|first1=Michael J.|title=A mathematical verification of the second law of thermodynamics from the entropy of mixing|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=67|pages=203|year=1990|doi=10.1021/ed067p203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general an equilibrium system is defined by writing an equilibrium equation for the reaction

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha A + \beta B \rightleftharpoons \sigma S + \tau T&lt;/math&gt;

In order to meet the thermodynamic condition for equilibrium, the Gibbs energy must be stationary, meaning that the derivative of G with respect to the [[extent of reaction]] : '''ξ''', must be zero. It can be shown that in this case, the sum of [[chemical potential]]s of the products is equal to the sum of those corresponding to the reactants. Therefore, the sum of the Gibbs energies of the reactants must be the equal to the sum of the Gibbs energies of the products.
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha \mu_A + \beta \mu_B = \sigma \mu_S + \tau \mu_T \,&lt;/math&gt;

where [[Mu (letter)|μ]] is in this case a partial molar Gibbs energy, a [[chemical potential]]. The chemical potential of a reagent A is a function of the
[[Activity (chemistry)|activity]], {A} of that reagent.

:&lt;math&gt; \mu_A = \mu_{A}^{\ominus} + RT \ln\{A\} \,&lt;/math&gt;, ( &lt;math&gt; \mu_{A}^{\ominus}~&lt;/math&gt; is the '''standard chemical potential ).

Substituting expressions like this into the [[Gibbs energy|Gibbs energy equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; dG = Vdp-SdT+\sum_{i=1}^k \mu_i dN_i &lt;/math&gt; in the case of a [[closed system]].
Now
:&lt;math&gt; dN_i = \nu_i d\xi \,&lt;/math&gt; ( &lt;math&gt; \nu_i~&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the [[Stoichiometric coefficient]] and &lt;math&gt; d\xi~&lt;/math&gt; is the [[differential of a function|differential]] of the extent of reaction ).

At constant pressure and temperature we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac {dG}{d\xi}\right)_{T,p} = \sum_{i=1}^k \mu_i \nu_i = \Delta_rG_{T,p}&lt;/math&gt; which corresponds to the '''[[Gibbs free energy change]] for the reaction''' .

This results in:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta_rG_{T,p} = \sigma \mu_{S} + \tau \mu_{T} - \alpha \mu_{A} - \beta \mu_{B} \,&lt;/math&gt;.

By substituting the chemical potentials:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta_rG_{T,p} = ( \sigma \mu_{S}^{\ominus} + \tau \mu_{T}^{\ominus} ) - ( \alpha \mu_{A}^{\ominus} + \beta \mu_{B}^{\ominus} ) + ( \sigma RT \ln\{S\} + \tau RT \ln\{T\} ) - ( \alpha RT \ln\{A\} + \beta RT \ln \{B\} ) &lt;/math&gt;,

the relationship becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta_rG_{T,p}=\sum_{i=1}^k \mu_i^\ominus \nu_i + RT \ln \frac{\{S\}^\sigma \{T\}^\tau} {\{A\}^\alpha \{B\}^\beta} &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^k \mu_i^\ominus \nu_i = \Delta_rG^{\ominus}&lt;/math&gt;: which is the '''standard Gibbs energy change for the reaction'''. It is a constant at a given temperature, which can be calculated, using thermodynamical tables.
::&lt;math&gt; RT \ln \frac{\{S\}^\sigma \{T\}^\tau} {\{A\}^\alpha \{B\}^\beta} = RT \ln Q_r &lt;/math&gt;
:::( &lt;math&gt;Q_r ~&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reaction quotient]] when the system is not at equilibrium ).

Therefore
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac {dG}{d\xi}\right)_{T,p} = \Delta_rG_{T,p}= \Delta_rG^{\ominus} + RT \ln Q_r &lt;/math&gt;

At equilibrium &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac {dG}{d\xi}\right)_{T,p} = \Delta_rG_{T,p} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; Q_r = K_{eq}~&lt;/math&gt; ; the reaction quotient becomes equal to the [[equilibrium constant]].

leading to:

:&lt;math&gt; 0 = \Delta_rG^{\ominus} + RT \ln K_{eq} &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta_rG^{\ominus} = -RT \ln K_{eq} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
'''Obtaining the value of the standard Gibbs energy change, allows the calculation of the equilibrium constant'''
&lt;/center&gt;

[[File:Diag eq.svg|thumb|350px|right]]

===Addition of reactants or products===
For a reactional system at equilibrium: &lt;math&gt;Q_r = K_{(eq)}~&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\xi = \xi_{eq}~&lt;/math&gt;.
:If are modified activities of constituents, the value of the reaction quotient changes and becomes different from the equilibrium constant: &lt;math&gt;Q_r \neq K_{(eq)}~&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac {dG}{d\xi}\right)_{T,p} = \Delta_rG^{\ominus} + RT \ln Q_r~&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\Delta_rG^{\ominus} = - RT \ln K_{(eq)}~&lt;/math&gt;

then

&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac {dG}{d\xi}\right)_{T,p} = RT \ln \left(\frac {Q_r}{K_{(eq)}}\right)~&lt;/math&gt;

*If activity of a reagent &lt;math&gt;i~&lt;/math&gt; increases

&lt;math&gt;Q_r = \frac{\prod (a_j)^{\nu_j}}{\prod(a_i)^{\nu_i}}~&lt;/math&gt;, the reaction quotient decreases.
:then

&lt;math&gt;Q_r &lt; K_{(eq)}~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac {dG}{d\xi}\right)_{T,p} &lt;0~&lt;/math&gt; : The reaction will shift to the right (i.e. in the forward direction, and thus more products will form).

*If activity of a product &lt;math&gt;j~&lt;/math&gt; increases
:then

&lt;math&gt;Q_r &gt; K_{(eq)}~&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac {dG}{d\xi}\right)_{T,p} &gt;0~&lt;/math&gt; : The reaction will shift to the left (i.e. in the reverse direction, and thus less products will form).

''Note'' that activities and equilibrium constants are dimensionless numbers.

===Treatment of activity===

The expression for the equilibrium constant can be rewritten as the product of a concentration quotient, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and an [[activity coefficient]] quotient, Γ.
:&lt;math&gt;K=\frac{{[S]} ^\sigma {[T]}^\tau ... } {{[A]}^\alpha {[B]}^\beta ...}
\times \frac{{\gamma_S} ^\sigma {\gamma_T}^\tau ... } {{\gamma_A}^\alpha {\gamma_B}^\beta ...} = K_c \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;

[A] is the concentration of reagent A, etc. It is possible in principle to obtain values of the activity coefficients, γ. For solutions, equations such as the [[Debye-Hückel equation]] or extensions such as [[Davies equation]]&lt;ref&gt;C.W. Davies, ''Ion Association'', Butterworths, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; [[Specific ion interaction theory]] or [[Pitzer equations]]&lt;ref name=&quot;davies&quot;&gt;I. Grenthe and H. Wanner, [http://www.nea.fr/html/dbtdb/guidelines/tdb2.pdf ''Guidelines for the extrapolation to zero ionic strength'']&lt;/ref&gt;
may be used.&lt;sup&gt;[[#Software for chemical equilibria|Software (below)]]&lt;/sup&gt;. However this is not always possible. It is common practice to assume that Γ is a constant, and to use the concentration quotient in place of the thermodynamic equilibrium constant. It is also general practice to use the term ''equilibrium constant'' instead of the more accurate ''concentration quotient''. This practice will be followed here.

For reactions in the gas phase [[partial pressure]] is used in place of concentration and [[fugacity coefficient]] in place of activity coefficient. In the real world, for example, when making [[Haber process|ammonia]] in industry, fugacity coefficients must be taken into account. Fugacity, ''f'', is the product of partial pressure and fugacity coefficient. The chemical potential of a species in the gas phase is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \mu^{\Theta} + RT \ln \left( \frac{f}{bar} \right) = \mu^{\Theta} + RT \ln \left( \frac{p}{bar} \right) + RT \ln \gamma &lt;/math&gt;
so the general expression defining an equilibrium constant is valid for both solution and gas phases.

===Concentration quotients===

In aqueous solution, equilibrium constants are usually determined in the presence of an &quot;inert&quot; electrolyte such as [[sodium nitrate]] NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or [[Potassium perchlorate]] KClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The [[ionic strength]], ''I'', of a solution containing a dissolved salt, X&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Y&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, is given by
:&lt;math&gt; I = \frac{1}{2}\left(c_X z_X^2 + c_Y z_Y^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n c_i z_i^2\right) &lt;/math&gt;
where ''c'' stands for concentration, ''z'' stands for ionic charge and the sum is taken over all the species in equilibrium. When the concentration of dissolved salt is much higher than the analytical concentrations of the reagents, the ionic strength is effectively constant. Since activity coefficients depend on ionic strength the activity coefficients of the species are effectively independent of concentration. Thus, the assumption that [[Gamma|Γ]] is constant is justified. The concentration quotient is a simple multiple of the equilibrium constant.&lt;ref&gt;F.J.C. Rossotti and H. Rossotti, ''The Determination of Stability Constants'', McGraw-Hill, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; K_c = \frac{K}{\Gamma} &lt;/math&gt;
However, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; will vary with ionic strength. If it is measured at a series of different ionic strengths the value can be extrapolated to zero ionic strength.&lt;ref name=&quot;davies&quot;/&gt; The concentration quotient obtained in this manner is known, paradoxically, as a thermodynamic equilibrium constant.

To use a published value of an equilibrium constant in conditions of ionic strength different from the conditions used in its determination, the value should be adjusted&lt;sup&gt;[[#Software for chemical equilibria|Software (below)]]&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Metastable mixtures===

A mixture may be appear to have no tendency to change, though it is not at equilibrium. For example, a mixture of [[Sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is [[metastable]] as there is a [[Activation energy|kinetic barrier]] to formation of the product, [[Sulfur trioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]].
:2SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; 2SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The barrier can be overcome when a [[Catalysis|catalyst]] is also present in the mixture as in the [[contact process]], but the catalyst does not affect the equilibrium concentrations.

Likewise, the formation of [[bicarbonate]] from [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]] is very slow under normal conditions
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; +H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
but almost instantaneous in the presence of the catalytic [[enzyme]] [[carbonic anhydrase]].

==Pure compounds==

When pure substances (liquids or solids) are involved in equilibria they do not appear in the equilibrium equation &lt;ref name=CEM&gt;''Concise Encyclopedia Chemistry'' 1994 ISBN 0-89925-457-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying the general formula for an equilibrium constant to the specific case of acetic acid one obtains
:&lt;math&gt;CH_3CO_2H + H_2O \rightleftharpoons CH_3CO_2^- + H_3O^+&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;K_c=\frac{[{CH_3CO_2}^-][{H_3O}^+]} {[{CH_3CO_2H}][{H_2O}]}&lt;/math&gt;

It may be assumed that the concentration of water is constant. This assumption will be valid for all but very concentrated solutions. The equilibrium constant expression is therefore usually written as
:&lt;math&gt;K=\frac{[{CH_3CO_2}^-][{H_3O}^+]} {[{CH_3CO_2H}]}&lt;/math&gt;

where now

&lt;math&gt;K=K_c \cdot [H_2O]\,&lt;/math&gt;

a constant factor is incorporated into the equilibrium constant.

A particular case is the [[self-ionization of water]] itself

:&lt;math&gt;H_2O + H_2O \rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ + OH^-&lt;/math&gt;

The self-ionization constant of water is defined as

&lt;math&gt;K_w = [H^+][OH^-]\,&lt;/math&gt;

It is perfectly legitimate to write [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] for the [[hydronium ion]] concentration, since the state of [[solvation]] of the proton is constant (in dilute solutions) and so does not affect the equilibrium concentrations. K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; varies with variation in ionic strength and/or temperature.

The concentrations of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; are not independent quantities. Most commonly [OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] is replaced by ''K''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in equilibrium constant expressions which would otherwise [[hydroxide]].

Solids also do not appear in the equilibrium equation. An example is the [[Boudouard reaction]] &lt;ref name=CEM/&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;2CO \rightleftharpoons CO_2 + C &lt;/math&gt;

for which the equation (without solid carbon) is written as:

:&lt;math&gt;K_c=\frac{[CO_2]} {[CO]^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Multiple equilibria==

Consider the case of a dibasic acid H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A. When dissolved in water, the mixture will contain H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A, HA&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and A&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;. This equilibrium can be split into two steps in each of which one proton is liberated.
:&lt;math&gt;H_2A \rightleftharpoons HA^- + H^+ :K_1=\frac{[HA^-][H^+]} {[H_2A]}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;HA^- \rightleftharpoons A^{2-} + H^+ :K_2=\frac{[A^{2-}][H^+]} {[HA^-]}&lt;/math&gt;
''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and'' K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are examples of ''stepwise'' equilibrium constants. The ''overall'' equilibrium constant,&lt;math&gt;\beta_D&lt;/math&gt;, is product of the stepwise constants.
:&lt;math&gt;H_2A \rightleftharpoons A^{2-} + 2H^+ :\beta_D = \frac{[A^{2-}][H^+]^2} {[H_2A]}=K_1K_2&lt;/math&gt;
Note that these constants are [[Acid dissociation constant|dissociation constants]] because the products on the right hand side of the equilibrium expression are dissociation products. In many systems, it is preferable to use association constants.
:&lt;math&gt;A^{2-} + H^+ \rightleftharpoons HA^- :\beta_1=\frac {[HA^-]} {[A^{2-}][H^+]}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A^{2-} + 2H^+ \rightleftharpoons H_2A :\beta_2=\frac {[H_2A]} {[A^{2-}][H^+]^2}&lt;/math&gt;
β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are examples of association constants. Clearly β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/β&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;; lg β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = pK&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and lg β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = pK&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + pK&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.T. Beck, ''Chemistry of Complex Equilibria'', Van Nostrand, 1970. 2nd. Edition by M.T. Beck and I Nagypál, Akadémiai Kaidó, Budapest, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
For multiple equilibrium systems, also see: theory of [[Response reactions]].

==Effect of temperature==

The effect of changing temperature on an equilibrium constant is given by the [[van 't Hoff equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d\ln K} {dT} = \frac{{\Delta H_m}^{\Theta}} {RT^2}&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, for [[exothermic]] reactions, (ΔH is negative) ''K'' decreases with an increase in temperature, but, for [[endothermic]] reactions, (ΔH is positive) ''K'' increases with an increase temperature. An alternative formulation is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d\ln K} {d(1/T)} = -\frac{{\Delta H_m}^{\Theta}} {R}&lt;/math&gt;
At first sight this appears to offer a means of obtaining the standard molar enthalpy of the reaction by studying the variation of ''K'' with temperature. In practice, however, the method is unreliable because error propagation almost always gives very large errors on the values calculated in this way.

# The related [[Nernst equation]] in electrochemistry gives the difference in electrode potential as a function of redox concentrations.
# When molecules on each side of the equilibrium are able to further react irreversibly in secondary reactions, the final product ratio is determined according to the [[Curtin-Hammett principle]].

In these applications, terms such as stability constant, formation constant, binding constant, affinity constant, association/dissociation constant are used. In biochemistry, it is common to give units for binding constants, which serve to define the concentration units used when the constant’s value was determined.

==Composition of a mixture==

When the only equilibrium is that of the formation of a 1:1 adduct as the composition of a mixture, there are any number of ways that the composition of a mixture can be calculated. For example, see [[ICE table]] for a traditional method of calculating the pH of a solution of a weak acid.

There are three approaches to the general calculation of the composition of a mixture at equilibrium.

#The most basic approach is to manipulate the various equilibrium constants until the desired concentrations are expressed in terms of measured equilibrium constants (equivalent to measuring chemical potentials) and initial conditions.
#Minimize the Gibbs energy of the system.&lt;ref&gt;This approach is described in detail in W. R. Smith and R. W. Missen, ''Chemical Reaction Equilibrium Analysis: Theory and Algorithms'', , Krieger Publishing, Malabar, Fla, 1991 (a reprint, with corrections, of the same title by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], 1982). A comprehensive treatment of the theory of chemical reaction equilibria and its computation. Details at [http://www.mathtrek.com http://www.mathtrek.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Satisfy the equation of [[mass balance]]. The equations of mass balance are simply statements that demonstrate that the total concentration of each reactant must be constant by the law of [[conservation of mass]].

===Mass-balance equations===

In general, the calculations are rather complicated. For instance, in the case of a dibasic acid, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A dissolved in water the two reactants can be specified as the [[conjugate base]], A&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;, and the [[hydronium|proton]], H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The following equations of mass-balance could apply equally well to a base such as [[Ethylenediamine|1,2-diaminoethane]], in which case the base itself is designated as the reactant A:
:&lt;math&gt;T_A = [A] + [HA] +[H_2A] \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T_H = [H] + [HA] + 2[H_2A] - [OH] \,&lt;/math&gt;

With T&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; the total concentration of species A. Note that it is customary to omit the ionic charges when writing and using these equations.

When the equilibrium constants are known and the total concentrations are specified there are two equations in two unknown &quot;free concentrations&quot; [A] and [H]. This follows from the fact that [HA]= β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[A][H], [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A]= β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[A][H]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and [OH] = K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;[H]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; T_A = [A] + \beta_1[A][H] + \beta_2[A][H]^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_H = [H] + \beta_1[A][H] + 2\beta_2[A][H]^2 - K_w[H]^{-1} \,&lt;/math&gt;

so the concentrations of the &quot;complexes&quot; are calculated from the free concentrations and the equilibrium constants.
General expressions applicable to all systems with two reagents, A and B would be
:&lt;math&gt;T_A=[A]+\sum_i{p_i \beta_i[A]^{p_i}[B]^{q_i}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T_B=[B]+\sum_i{q_i \beta_i[A]^{p_i}[B]^{q_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to see how this can be extended to three or more reagents.

====Polybasic acids====

The composition of solutions containing reactants A and H is easy to calculate as a function of [[pH|p[H]]]. When [H] is known, the free concentration [A] is calculated from the mass-balance equation in A. Here is an example of the results that can be obtained.

[[File:AL hydrolysis.png]]

This diagram, for the hydrolysis of the [[aluminium]] [[Lewis acid]] Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;aq&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;ref&gt;The diagram was created with the program [http://www.hyperquad.co.uk/hyss.htm HySS]&lt;/ref&gt; shows the species concentrations for a 5×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;M solution of an aluminium salt as a function of pH. Each concentration is shown as a percentage of the total aluminium.

====Solution and precipitation====

The diagram above illustrates the point that a [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] that is not one of the main species in the solution equilibrium may be formed. At pH just below 5.5 the main species present in a 5μM solution of Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; are [[aluminium hydroxide]]s Al(OH)&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Al&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7+&lt;/sup&gt;, but on raising the pH [[aluminium hydroxide|Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] precipitates from the solution. This occurs because Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a very large [[lattice energy]]. As the pH rises more and more Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; comes out of solution. This is an example of [[Le Chatelier's principle]] in action: Increasing the concentration of the hydroxide ion causes more aluminium hydroxide to precipitate, which removes hydroxide from the solution. When the hydroxide concentration becomes sufficiently high the soluble aluminate, Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, is formed.

Another common instance where precipitation occurs is when a metal cation interacts with an anionic ligand to form an electrically-neutral complex. If the complex is [[hydrophobic]], it will precipitate out of water. This occurs with the [[nickel]] ion Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [[dimethylglyoxime]], (dmgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): in this case the lattice energy of the solid is not particularly large, but it greatly exceeds the energy of [[solvation]] of the molecule Ni(dmgH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Minimization of free energy===

At equilibrium, ''G'' is at a minimum:

:&lt;math&gt;dG= \sum_{j=1}^m \mu_j\,dN_j = 0&lt;/math&gt;

For a closed system, no particles may enter or leave, although they may combine in various ways. The total number of atoms of each element will remain constant. This means that the minimization above must be subjected to the constraints:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^m a_{ij}N_j=b_i^0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the number of atoms of element ''i'' in molecule ''j'' and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is the total number of atoms of element ''i'', which is a constant, since the system is closed. If there are a total of ''k'' types of atoms in the system, then there will be ''k'' such equations.

This is a standard problem in [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]], known as [[constrained minimisation]]. The most common method of solving it is using the method of [[Lagrange multipliers]], also known as [[undetermined multipliers]] (though other methods may be used).

Define:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}= G + \sum_{i=1}^k\lambda_i\left(\sum_{j=1}^m a_{ij}N_j-b_i^0\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; are the Lagrange multipliers, one for each element. This allows each of the &lt;math&gt;N_j&lt;/math&gt; to be treated independently, and it can be shown using the tools of [[multivariate calculus]] that the equilibrium condition is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathcal{G}}{\partial N_j}=0&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathcal{G}}{\partial \lambda_i}=0&lt;/math&gt;

(For proof see [[Lagrange multipliers]])

This is a set of ''(m+k)'' equations in ''(m+k)'' unknowns (the &lt;math&gt;N_j&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;) and may, therefore, be solved for the equilibrium concentrations &lt;math&gt;N_j&lt;/math&gt; as long as the chemical potentials are known as functions of the concentrations at the given temperature and pressure. (See [[Thermodynamic databases for pure substances]]).

This method of calculating equilibrium chemical concentrations is useful for systems with a large number of different molecules. The use of ''k'' atomic element conservation equations for the mass constraint is straightforward, and replaces the use of the stoichiometric coefficient equations.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasa&quot;/&gt;

In [[mathematics]] a '''combination''' is a way of selecting several things out of a larger group, where (unlike [[permutations]]) order does not matter. In smaller cases it is possible to count the number of combinations. For example given three fruit, an apple, orange and pear say, there are three combinations of two that can be drawn from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or a pear and an orange.
More formally a ''k''-'''combination''' of a set ''S'' is a subset of ''k'' distinct elements of ''S''. If the set has ''n'' elements the number of ''k''-combinations is equal to the [[binomial coefficient]]
:&lt;math&gt; \binom nk = \frac{n(n-1)\ldots(n-k+1)}{k(k-1)\dots1},&lt;/math&gt;
which can be written using [[factorial]]s as &lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;k\leq n&lt;/math&gt;, and which is zero when &lt;math&gt;k&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.
The set of all ''k''-combinations of a set ''S'' is sometimes denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;\binom Sk\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Combinations can consider the combination of ''n'' things taken ''k'' at a time without or with repetitions.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Kreyszig, ''Advanced Engineering Mathematics'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, INC, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In the above example repetitions were not allowed. If however it was possible to have two of any one kind of fruit there would be 3 more combinations: one with two apples, one with two oranges, and one with two pears.

With large sets, it becomes necessary to use mathematics to find the number of combinations. For example, a [[Hand (poker)|poker hand]] can be described as a 5-combination (''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5) of cards from a 52 card deck (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;52). The 5 cards of the hand are all distinct, and the order of cards in the hand does not matter. There are 2,598,960 such combinations, and the chance of drawing any one hand at random is&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;2,598,960.

The [[Permutations_and_combinations#case_in|number of ''k''-combinations]] from a given set ''S'' of ''n'' elements is often denoted in elementary combinatorics texts by ''C''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''k''), or by a variation such as &lt;math&gt;C^n_k&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;{}_nC_k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{}^nC_k&lt;/math&gt; or even &lt;math&gt;C_n^k&lt;/math&gt; (the latter form is standard in French and Polish texts).  The same number however occurs in many other mathematical contexts, where it is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt;; notably it occurs as coefficient in the [[binomial formula]], hence its name '''binomial coefficient'''. One can define &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt; for all natural numbers ''k'' at once by the relation

:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle(1+X)^n=\sum_{k\geq0}\binom nk X^k,&lt;/math&gt;

from which it is clear that &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n0=\tbinom nn=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk=0&lt;/math&gt; for ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''. To see that these coefficients count ''k''-combinations from ''S'', one can first consider a collection of ''n'' distinct variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; labeled by the elements ''s'' of ''S'', and expand the [[Multiplication|product]] over all elements of&amp;nbsp;''S'':

:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\prod_{s\in S}(1+X_s);&lt;/math&gt;

it has 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; distinct terms corresponding to all the subsets of ''S'', each subset giving the product of the corresponding variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;. Now setting all of the ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; equal to the unlabeled variable ''X'', so that the product becomes {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the term for each ''k''-combination from ''S'' becomes ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, so that the coefficient of that power in the result equals the number of such ''k''-combinations.

Binomial coefficients can be computed explicitly in various ways. To get all of them for the expansions up to {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, one can use (in addition to the basic cases already given) the recursion relation

:&lt;math&gt;\binom nk=\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\binom{n-1}k,\text{ for }0&lt;k&lt;n,&lt;/math&gt;

which follows from {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; }}={{nowrap| (1 + ''X'')&lt;sup&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;(1 + ''X'')}}; this leads to the construction of [[Pascal's triangle]].

For determining an individual binomial coefficient, it is more practical to use the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\binom nk = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[numerator]] gives the number of [[Permutations_and_combinations#case_i|''k''-permutations]] of ''n'', i.e., of sequences of ''k'' distinct elements of ''S'', while the [[denominator]] gives the number of such ''k''-permutations that give the same ''k''-combination when the order is ignored.

When ''k'' exceeds ''n''/2, the above formula contains factors common to the numerator and the denominator, and canceling them out gives the relation

:&lt;math&gt; \binom nk = \binom n{n-k},\text{ for }0 \le k \le n.&lt;/math&gt;

This expresses a symmetry that is evident from the binomial formula, and can also be understood in terms of ''k''-combinations by taking the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of such a combination, which is an {{nowrap|(''n'' − ''k'')}}-combination.

Finally there is a formula which exhibits this symmetry directly, and has the merit of being easy to remember:

:&lt;math&gt; \binom nk = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt; denotes the [[factorial]] of ''n''. It is obtained from the previous formula by multiplying denominator and numerator by {{nowrap|(''n'' − ''k'')}}!, so it is certainly inferior as a method of computation to that formula.

The last formula can be understood directly, by considering the ''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt; permutations of all the elements of ''S''. Each such permutation gives a ''k''-combination by selecting its first ''k'' elements. There are many duplicate selections: any combined permutation of the first ''k'' elements among each other, and of the final (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'') elements among each other produces the same combination; this explains the division in the formula.

From the above formulas follow relations between adjacent numbers in Pascal's triangle in all three directions:

:&lt;math&gt; \binom nk = \binom n{k-1} \frac {n-k+1}k,\text{ for }k&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \binom nk = \binom {n-1}k \frac n{n-k},\text{ for }{k&lt;n} &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \binom nk = \binom {n-1}{k-1} \frac nk,\text{ for }n,k&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;.

Together with the basic cases &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n0=1=\tbinom nn&lt;/math&gt;, these allow successive computation of respectively all numbers of combinations from the same set (a row in Pascal's triangle), of ''k''-combinations of sets of growing sizes, and of combinations with a complement of fixed size {{nowrap|''n'' − ''k''}}.

=== Example of counting combinations ===
As a concrete example, one can compute the number of five-card hands possible from a standard fifty-two card deck as:

:&lt;math&gt; {52 \choose 5} = \frac{52\times51\times50\times49\times48}{5\times4\times3\times2\times1} = \frac{311,875,200}{120} = 
2,598,960.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively one may use the formula in terms of factorials and cancel the factors in the numerator against parts of the factors in the denominator, after which only multiplication of the remaining factors is required:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{alignat}{2}{52 \choose 5} &amp;= \frac{52!}{5!47!} \\
&amp;= \frac{52\times51\times50\times49\times48\times\cancel{47!}}{5\times4\times3\times2\times\cancel{1}\times\cancel{47!}} \\
&amp;= \frac{52\times51\times50\times49\times48}{5\times4\times3\times2} \\
&amp;= \frac{(26\times\cancel{2})\times(17\times\cancel{3})\times(10\times\cancel{5})\times49\times(12\times\cancel{4})}{\cancel{5}\times\cancel{4}\times\cancel{3}\times\cancel{2}} \\
&amp;= {26\times17\times10\times49\times12} \\&amp;= 2,598,960.\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;

Another alternative computation, almost equivalent to the first, is based on writing

:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose k} = \frac { ( n - 0 ) }1 \times \frac { ( n - 1 ) }2 \times \frac { ( n - 2 ) }3 \times \cdots \times \frac { ( n - (k - 1) ) }k,&lt;/math&gt;

which gives

:&lt;math&gt; {52 \choose 5} = \frac{52}1 \times \frac{51}2 \times \frac{50}3 \times \frac{49}4 \times \frac{48}5 = 2,598,960.&lt;/math&gt;
When evaluated as {{math|52 ÷ 1 × 51 ÷ 2 × 50 ÷ 3 × 49 ÷ 4 × 48 ÷ 5}}, this can be computed using only integer arithmetic. The reason that all divisions are without remainder is that the intermediate results they produce are themselves binomial coefficients.

Using the symmetric formula in terms of factorials without performing simplifications gives a rather extensive calculation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 {52 \choose 5} &amp;= \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \frac{52!}{5!(52-5)!} = \frac{52!}{5!47!} \\
&amp;= \tfrac{80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000}{120\times258,623,241,511,168,180,642,964,355,153,611,979,969,197,632,389,120,000,000,000} \\
&amp;= 2,598,960.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Enumerating ''k''-combinations ===

One can [[enumerate]] all ''k''-combinations of a given set {{mvar|''S''}} of ''n'' elements in some fixed order, which establishes a [[bijection]] from an interval of &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt; integers with the set of those  ''k''-combinations. Assuming {{mvar|''S''}} is itself ordered, for instance {{math|''S'' {{=}} {1,2, ...,''n''}}}, there are two natural possibilities for ordering its ''k''-combinations: by comparing their smallest elements first (as in the illustrations above) or by comparing their largest elements first. The latter option has the advantage that adding a new largest element to {{mvar|''S''}} will not change the initial part of the enumeration, but just add the new ''k''-combinations of the larger set after the previous ones. Repeating this process, the enumeration can be extended indefinitely with ''k''-combinations of ever larger sets. If moreover the intervals of the integers are taken to start at&amp;nbsp;0, then the ''k''-combination at a given place ''i'' in the enumeration can be computed easily from ''i'', and the bijection so obtained is known as the [[combinatorial number system]].  

== Number of combinations with repetition ==
{{See also|Multiset coefficient}}

[[File:Combinations with repetition; 5 multichoose 3.svg|thumb|370px|Bijection between&lt;br&gt;3-element multisets with elements from a 5-element set (on the right)&lt;br&gt;and 3-element subsets of a 7-element set (on the left)]]
A ''k''-'''combination with repetitions''', or ''k''-'''multicombination''', or '''multiset''' of size ''k'' from a set ''S'' is given by a sequence of ''k'' not necessarily distinct elements of ''S'', where order is not taken into account: two sequences of which one can be obtained from the other by permuting the terms define the same multiset. If ''S'' has ''n'' elements, the number of such ''k''-multicombinations is also given by a [[binomial coefficient]], namely by

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{n + k - 1}{k} = \binom{n + k - 1}{n - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

(the case where both ''n'' and ''k'' are zero is special; the correct value 1 (for the empty 0-multicombination) is given by left hand side &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{-1}0&lt;/math&gt;, but not by the right hand side &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{-1}{-1}&lt;/math&gt;).

=== Example of counting multicombinations ===

For example, if you have ten types of donuts (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10) on a menu to choose from and you want three donuts (''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3), the number of ways to choose can be calculated as

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{10+3-1}3 = \binom{12}3 = \frac{12\times11\times10}{3\times2\times1} = 220.&lt;/math&gt;

The analogy with the ''k''-combination case can be stressed by writing the numerator as a rising power

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{n + k - 1}{k} =  \frac{n(n+1)\cdots(n+k-1)}{k!}.&lt;/math&gt;

There is an easy way to understand the above result. Label the elements of ''S'' with numbers 0, 1, ..., {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}}, and choose a ''k''-combination from the set of numbers { 1, 2, ..., {{nowrap|''n'' + ''k'' − 1}} } (so that there are {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}} ''unchosen'' numbers). Now change this ''k''-combination into a ''k''-multicombination of ''S'' by replacing every (chosen) number ''x'' in the ''k''-combination by the element of ''S'' labeled by the ''number of unchosen numbers'' less than ''x''. This is always a number in the range of the labels, and it is easy to see that every ''k''-multicombination of ''S'' is obtained for one choice of a ''k''-combination.

A concrete example may be helpful. Suppose there are 4 types of fruits (apple, orange, pear, banana) at a grocery store, and you want to buy 12 pieces of fruit. So ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 and ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12. Use label 0 for apples, 1 for oranges, 2 for pears, and 3 for bananas. A selection of 12 fruits can be translated into a selection of 12 distinct numbers in the range 1,...,15 by selecting as many consecutive numbers starting from 1 as there are apples in the selection, then skip a number, continue choosing as many consecutive numbers as there are oranges selected, again skip a number, then again for pears, skip one again, and finally choose the remaining numbers (as many as there are bananas selected). For instance for 2 apples, 7 oranges, 0 pears and 3 bananas, the numbers chosen will be 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15. To recover the fruits, the numbers 1, 2 (not preceded by any unchosen numbers) are replaced by apples, the numbers 4,&amp;nbsp;5,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;10 (preceded by one unchosen number: 3) by oranges, and the numbers 13, 14, 15 (preceded by three unchosen numbers: 3, 11, and 12) by bananas; there are no chosen numbers preceded by exactly 2 unchosen numbers, and therefore no pears in the selection.
The total number of possible selections is

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{4+12-1}{12} = \binom{15}{12} = \binom{15}3 = \frac{15\times14\times13}{3\times2\times1} = 455. &lt;/math&gt;

== Number of ''k''-combinations for all k ==
{{See also|Binomial coefficient#Sum of coefficients row}}

The number of ''k''-combinations for all ''k'', &lt;math&gt;\sum_{0\leq{k}\leq{n}}\binom nk = 2^n&lt;/math&gt;, is the sum of the ''n''th row (counting from 0) of the [[Binomial coefficient#Sum of coefficients row|binomial coefficients]]. These combinations are enumerated by the 1 digits of the set of [[base 2]] numbers counting from 0 to &lt;math&gt;2^n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, where each digit position is an item from the set of ''n''.

'''Computer software''', or just '''software''', is a collection of [[computer program]]s and related [[data]] that provide the instructions for telling a [[computer]] what to do and how to do it.
In other words, software is a conceptual entity which is a set of computer programs, procedures, and associated documentation concerned with the operation of a data processing system. We can also say software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer for some purposes. In other words software is a set of '''programs, procedures, algorithms''' and its '''documentation'''. Program [[software]] performs the [[Function (engineering)|function]] of the [[Computer program|program]] it implements, either by directly providing [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] to the computer hardware or by serving as input to another piece of software. The [[Terminology|term]] was coined to contrast to the old term [[hardware]] (meaning physical devices). In contrast to hardware, software is intangible, meaning it &quot;cannot be touched&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = Wordreference.com: WordNet 2.0
| publisher = Princeton University, Princeton, NJ
| url = http://www.wordreference.com/definition/software
| accessdate = 2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense, meaning [[application software]] only. Sometimes the term includes data that has not traditionally been associated with computers, such as film, tapes, and records.&lt;ref&gt;software..(n.d.). ''Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1)''. Retrieved 2007-04-13, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/software&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of computer software include:
* [[Application software]] includes end-user applications of computers such as [[word processors]] or [[video game]]s, and [[ERP software]] for groups of users.
* [[Middleware]] controls and co-ordinates [[distributed computing|distributed systems]].
* [[Programming language]]s define the [[syntax]] and [[semantics]] of computer programs. For example, many mature banking applications were written in the [[COBOL]] language, originally invented in 1959. Newer applications are often written in more modern programming languages.
* [[System software]] includes [[operating system]]s, which govern computing resources. Today{{When|date=November 2010}} large{{quantify|date=October 2010}} applications running on remote machines such as [[Website]]s are considered{{By whom|date=November 2010}} to be system software, because{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} the end-[[user interface]] is generally through a [[graphical user interface]], such as a [[web browser]].
* [[Testware]] is software for testing hardware or a [[software package (programming)|software package]].
* [[Firmware]] is low-level software often stored on electrically programmable memory devices. Firmware is given its name because it is treated like hardware and run (&quot;executed&quot;) by other software programs.
* Shrinkware is the older name given to consumer-purchased software, because it was often sold in retail stores in a [[Shrink wrap|shrink-wrapped]] box.
* [[Device drivers]] control parts of computers such as [[disk drive]]s, [[printer (computing)|printers]], [[CD drive]]s, or [[computer monitor]]s.
* [[Programming tool]]s help conduct computing tasks in any category listed above. For programmers, these could be tools for [[debugging]] or [[reverse engineering]] older [[legacy system]]s in order to check [[source code compatibility]].

==History==
{{For|the history prior to 1946|History of computing hardware}}
The first theory about software was proposed by [[Alan Turing]] in his 1935 essay ''Computable numbers with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem (Decision problem)''.&lt;ref&gt;Hally, Mike (2005:79). ''Electronic brains/Stories from the dawn of the computer age''. British Broadcasting Corporation and Granta Books, London. ISBN 1-86207-663-4.&lt;/ref&gt;
The term &quot;software&quot; was first used in print by [[John W. Tukey]] in 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;&gt;John Tukey, 85, Statistician; Coined the Word 'Software', New York Times, Obituaries, July 28, 2000 [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E4DA173DF93BA15754C0A9669C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=&amp;pagewanted=1]&lt;/ref&gt; Colloquially, the term is often used to mean application software. In computer science and [[software engineering]], software is all [[information]] processed by [[computer system]], programs and [[data]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTobit&quot;/&gt; The academic fields studying software are [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]].
&lt;!-- replaced the following citation with the reusable one
&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E4DA173DF93BA15754C0A9669C8B63|title=John Tukey, 85, Statistician; Coined the Word 'Software'|publisher=New York Times |date=July 28, 2000 | first=David | last=Leonhardt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

The history of computer software is most often traced back to the first [[software bug]] in 1946{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. As more and more programs enter the realm of firmware, and the hardware itself becomes smaller, cheaper and faster as predicted by [[Moore's law]], elements of computing first considered to be software, join the ranks of hardware. Most hardware companies today have more software programmers on the payroll than hardware designers{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, since software tools have automated many tasks of [[Printed circuit board]] engineers. Just like the [[Auto industry]], the [[Software industry]] has grown from a few visionaries operating out of their garage with [[prototype]]s. [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Bill Gates]] were the [[Henry Ford]] and [[Louis Chevrolet]] of their times{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, who capitalized on ideas already commonly known before they started in the business. In the case of [[Software development]], this moment is generally agreed to be the publication in the 1980s of the specifications for the [[IBM Personal Computer]] published by [[IBM]] employee [[Philip Don Estridge]]. Today his move would be seen as a type of [[crowd-sourcing]].

Until that time, software was ''[[Bundled software|bundled]]'' with the hardware by [[Original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEMs) such as [[Data General]], [[Digital Equipment]] and IBM{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. When a customer bought a [[minicomputer]], at that time the smallest computer on the market, the computer did not come with [[Pre-installed software]], but needed to be installed by engineers employed by the OEM. Computer hardware companies not only bundled their software, they also placed demands on the location of the hardware in a refrigerated space called a [[Data center|computer room]]. Most companies had their software on the books for 0 dollars, unable to claim it as an asset (this is similar to financing of popular music in those days). When Data General introduced the [[Data General Nova]], a company called Digidyne wanted to use its [[RDOS]] operating system on its own [[Clone (computing)|hardware clone]]. Data General refused to [[Software license|license their software]] (which was hard to do, since it was on the books as a free asset), and claimed their &quot;bundling rights&quot;. The [[Supreme Court]] set a precedent called Digidyne v. Data General in 1985. The Supreme Court let a 9th circuit decision stand, and Data General was eventually forced into licensing the Operating System software because it was ruled that restricting the license to only DG hardware was an illegal ''tying arrangement''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/1372482 Tying Arrangements and the Computer Industry: Digidyne Corp. vs. Data General]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, IBM 'published' its [[DOS]] source for free, and [[Microsoft]] was born. Unable to sustain the loss from lawyer's fees, Data General ended up being taken over by [[EMC Corporation]]. The Supreme Court decision made it possible to value software, and also purchase [[Software patent]]s. The move by IBM was almost a protest at the time. Few in the industry believed that anyone would profit from it other than IBM (through free publicity). Microsoft and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] were able to thus cash in on 'soft' products. It is hard to imagine today that people once felt that software was worthless without a machine. There are many successful companies today that sell only software products, though there are still many common software licensing problems due to the complexity of designs and poor documentation, leading to [[patent troll]]s.

With open software specifications and the possibility of software licensing, new opportunities arose for software tools that then became the [[de facto standard]], such as DOS for operating systems, but also various proprietary word processing and [[spreadsheet]] programs. In a similar growth pattern, proprietary development methods became standard [[Software development methodology]].

==Overview==
[[Image:Operating system placement.svg|thumb|A layer structure showing where [[operating system]] is located on generally used software systems on [[desktop computer|desktops]]]]
Software includes all the various forms and roles that digitally stored ''data'' may have and play in a computer (or similar system), regardless of whether the data is used as ''code'' for a CPU, or other [[interpreter]], or whether it represents other kinds of [[information]]. Software thus encompasses a wide array of products that may be developed using different techniques such as ordinary [[programming languages]], [[scripting languages]], [[microcode]], or an [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] configuration.

The types of software include [[web pages]] developed in languages and frameworks like [[HTML]], [[PHP]], [[Perl]], [[JavaServer Pages|JSP]], [[ASP.NET]], [[XML]], and [[desktop application]]s like [[OpenOffice.org]], [[Microsoft Word]] developed in languages like [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Objective-C]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], or [[Smalltalk]]. [[Application software]] usually runs on an underlying software [[operating system]]s such as [[Linux]] or [[Microsoft Windows]]. Software (or [[firmware]]) is also used in [[video game]]s and for the configurable parts of the [[logic]] systems of [[automobile]]s, [[television]]s, and other [[consumer electronics]].

[[Computer]] software is so called to distinguish it from [[computer hardware]], which encompasses the physical interconnections and devices required to store and execute (or run) the software. At the lowest level, executable code consists of machine language instructions specific to an individual processor. A machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. Programs are an ordered sequence of instructions for changing the state of the computer in a particular sequence. It is usually written in [[high-level programming language]]s that are easier and more efficient for humans to use (closer to [[natural language]]) than machine language. High-level languages are compiled or interpreted into machine language object code. Software may also be written in an [[assembly language]], essentially, a mnemonic representation of a machine language using a natural language alphabet. Assembly language must be assembled into object code via an [[Assemblers|assembler]].

==Types of software==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}
Practical [[computer system]]s divide [[software system]]s into three major classes{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}: [[system software]], [[programming software]] and [[application software]], although the distinction is arbitrary, and often blurred.

===System software===
[[System software]] provides the basic functions for computer usage and helps run the [[computer]] [[hardware]] and system. It includes a combination of the following:
* [[Device driver]]s
* [[Operating system]]s
* [[server (computing)|Servers]]
* [[software utility|Utilities]]
* [[Window system]]s

System software is responsible for managing a variety of independent hardware components, so that they can work together harmoniously. Its purpose is to unburden the [[application software]] [[programmer]] from the often complex details of the particular computer being used, including such accessories as [[communications device]]s, printers, device readers, displays and keyboards, and also to partition the computer's resources such as memory and processor time in a safe and stable manner.

===Programming software===
[[Programming software]] usually provides tools to assist a programmer in writing [[computer program]]s, and software using different programming languages in a more convenient way. The tools include:
* [[Compiler]]s
* [[Debugger]]s
* [[interpreter (computing)|Interpreters]]
* [[linker (computing)|Linkers]]
* [[Text editor]]s
An [[Integrated development environment]] (IDE) is a single application that attempts to manage all these functions..

===Application software===
[[Application software]] is developed to aid in any task that benefits from computation. It is a broad category, and encompasses [[software]] of many kinds, including the [[internet browser]] being used to display this page.
This category includes:
* [[Business software]]
* [[Computer-aided design]]
* [[Database]]s
* [[Decision making software]]
* [[Educational software]]
* [[Image editing]]
* [[automation|Industrial automation]]
* [[Mathematical software]]
* [[Medical software]]
* [[List of software for molecular mechanics modeling|Molecular modeling software]]
* [[List of quantum chemistry and solid state physics software|Quantum chemistry and solid state physics software]]
* [[Simulation software]]
* [[Spreadsheet]]s
* [[Telecommunication]]s (i.e., [[Internet|the Internet]] and everything that flows on it)
* [[Video game]]s
* [[Word processing]]

==Software topics==
===Architecture===
{{See also|Software architecture}}
Users often see things differently than programmers. People who use modern general purpose computers (as opposed to [[embedded system]]s, [[analog computer]]s and [[supercomputer]]s) usually see three layers of software performing a variety of tasks: platform, application, and user software.
* Platform software: [[Platform (computing)|Platform]] includes the [[firmware]], [[device driver]]s, an [[operating system]], and typically a [[graphical user interface]] which, in total, allow a user to interact with the computer and its [[peripheral]]s (associated equipment). Platform software often comes bundled with the computer. On a [[Personal computer|PC]] you will usually have the ability to change the platform software.
* Application software: [[Application software]] or Applications are what most people think of when they think of software. Typical examples include office suites and video games. Application software is often purchased separately from computer hardware. Sometimes applications are bundled with the computer, but that does not change the fact that they run as independent applications. Applications are usually independent programs from the operating system, though they are often tailored for specific platforms. Most users think of compilers, databases, and other &quot;system software&quot; as applications.
* User-written software: [[End-user development]] tailors systems to meet users' specific needs. User software include spreadsheet templates and [[word processor]] templates. Even email filters are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is. Depending on how competently the user-written software has been integrated into default application packages, many users may not be aware of the distinction between the original packages, and what has been added by co-workers.

===Documentation===
{{main|Software documentation}}

Most software has [[software documentation]] so that the [[end user]] can understand the program, what it does, and how to use it. Without clear documentation, software can be hard to use—especially if it is very specialized and relatively complex like [[Photoshop]] or [[AutoCAD]].

Developer documentation may also exist, either with the code as comments and/or as separate files, detailing how the programs works and can be modified.

===Library===
{{main|Software library}}

An executable is almost always not sufficiently complete for direct execution. [[Software library|Software libraries]] include collections of [[function (computer science)|functions]] and functionality that may be embedded in other applications. Operating systems include many standard Software libraries, and applications are often distributed with their own libraries.

===Standard===
{{main|Software standard}}
Since software can be designed using many different [[programming languages]] and in many different [[operating systems]] and [[operating environment]]s, [[software standard]] is needed so that different software can understand and exchange information between each other. For instance, an [[email]] sent from a [[Microsoft Outlook]] should be readable from [[Yahoo! Mail]] and vice versa.

===Execution===
{{main|Execution (computing)}}

Computer software has to be &quot;loaded&quot; into the [[computer storage|computer's storage]] (such as the [[hard drive]] or [[Computer memory|memory]]). Once the software has loaded, the computer is able to ''execute'' the software. This involves passing [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] from the application software, through the system software, to the [[hardware]] which ultimately receives the instruction as [[machine language|machine code]]. Each instruction causes the computer to carry out an operation&amp;nbsp;– moving [[data (computing)|data]], carrying out a [[computation]], or altering the [[control flow]] of instructions.

Data movement is typically from one place in memory to another. Sometimes it involves moving data between memory and registers which enable high-speed data access in the CPU. Moving data, especially large amounts of it, can be costly. So, this is sometimes avoided by using &quot;pointers&quot; to data instead. Computations include simple operations such as incrementing the value of a variable data element. More complex computations may involve many operations and data elements together.
&lt;!-- This section is simply to long for this article and needs to be compressed into the intro above, or moved to the articlee itselve ....
Instructions may be performed sequentially, conditionally, or iteratively. Sequential instructions are those operations that are performed one after another. Conditional instructions are performed such that different sets of instructions execute depending on the value(s) of some data. In some languages this is known as an &quot;if&quot; statement. Iterative instructions are performed repetitively and may depend on some data value. This is sometimes called a &quot;loop.&quot; Often, one instruction may &quot;call&quot; another set of instructions that are defined in some other program or [[module (programming)|module]]. When more than one computer processor is used, instructions may be executed simultaneously.

A simple example of the way software operates is what happens when a user selects an entry such as &quot;Copy&quot; from a menu. In this case, a conditional instruction is executed to copy text from data in a 'document' area residing in memory, perhaps to an intermediate storage area known as a 'clipboard' data area. If a different menu entry such as &quot;Paste&quot; is chosen, the software may execute the instructions to copy the text from the clipboard data area to a specific location in the same or another document in memory.

Depending on the application, even the example above could become complicated. The field of software engineering endeavors to manage the complexity of how software operates. This is especially true for software that operates in the context of a large or powerful [[computer system]].

Currently, almost the only limitations on the use of computer software in applications is the ingenuity of the designer/programmer. Consequently, large areas of activities (such as playing grand master level chess) formerly assumed to be incapable of software simulation are now routinely programmed. The only area that has so far proved reasonably secure from software simulation is the realm of human art— especially, pleasing music and literature.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Kinds of software by operation: [[computer program]] as [[executable]], [[source code]] or [[script (computer programming)|script]], [[computer configuration|configuration]].--&gt;

===Quality and reliability===
{{main|Software quality|Software testing|Software reliability}}

Software quality is very important, especially for commercial and system software like [[Microsoft Office]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]]. If software is faulty (buggy), it can delete a person's work, crash the computer and do other unexpected things. Faults and errors are called &quot;[[Software bug|bugs]].&quot; Many bugs are discovered and eliminated (debugged) through [[software testing]]. However, software testing rarely&amp;nbsp;– if ever&amp;nbsp;– eliminates every bug; some programmers say that &quot;every program has at least one more bug&quot; (Lubarsky's Law). All major software companies, such as Microsoft, Novell and [[Sun Microsystems]], have their own software testing departments with the specific goal of just testing. Software can be tested through [[unit testing]], [[regression testing]] and other methods, which are done manually, or most commonly, automatically, since the amount of code to be tested can be quite large. For instance, [[NASA]] has extremely rigorous software testing procedures for many operating systems and communication functions. Many NASA based operations interact and identify each other through command programs called software. This enables many people who work at NASA to check and evaluate functional systems overall. Programs containing command software enable hardware engineering and system operations to function much easier together.

===License===
{{main|Software license}}

The software's license gives the user the right to use the software in the licensed environment. Some software comes with the license when purchased off the shelf, or an OEM license when bundled with hardware. Other software comes with a [[free software license]], granting the recipient the rights to modify and redistribute the software. Software can also be in the form of [[freeware]] or [[shareware]].

===Patents===
{{main|Software patent|Software patent debate}}

Software can be patented in some but not all countries; however, [[software patent]]s can be controversial in the software industry with many people holding different views about it. The controversy over software patents is about specific [[algorithms]] or techniques that the software contains, which may not be duplicated by others and considered [[intellectual property]] and [[copyright infringement]] depending on the severity.

==Design and implementation==
{{main|Software development|Computer programming|Software engineering}}
Design and implementation of software varies depending on the complexity of the software. For instance, design and creation of [[Microsoft Word]] software will take much more time than designing and developing [[Microsoft Notepad]] because of the difference in functionalities in each one.

Software is usually designed and created (coded/written/programmed) in [[integrated development environment]]s (IDE) like [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], [[Emacs]] and [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] that can simplify the process and [[compiler|compile]] the program. As noted in different section, software is usually created on top of existing software and the [[application programming interface]] (API) that the underlying software provides like [[GTK+]], JavaBeans or [[Swing (Java)|Swing]]. Libraries (APIs) are categorized for different purposes. For instance, [[JavaBeans]] library is used for designing [[enterprise application]]s, [[Windows Forms]] library is used for designing graphical user interface (GUI) applications like [[Microsoft Word]], and [[Windows Communication Foundation]] is used for designing [[web services]]. Underlying [[computer programming]] [[concept]]s like [[quicksort]], [[hashtable]], [[array data type|array]], and [[binary tree]] can be useful to creating software. When a program is designed, it relies on the API. For instance, if a user is designing a Microsoft Windows desktop application, he/she might use the [[.NET Framework|.NET]] Windows Forms library to design the desktop application and call its APIs like ''Form1.Close()'' and ''Form1.Show()''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/default.aspx | title=MSDN Library|accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to close or open the application and write the additional operations him/herself that it need to have. Without these APIs, the programmer needs to write these APIs him/herself. Companies like [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Novell]], and [[Microsoft]] provide their own APIs so that many applications are written using their [[software library|software libraries]] that usually have numerous APIs in them.

Computer software has special economic characteristics that make its design, creation, and distribution different from most other economic goods.&lt;ref&gt;
v. Engelhardt, Sebastian (2008): [http://ideas.repec.org/p/jrp/jrpwrp/2008-045.html &quot;The Economic Properties of Software&quot;, Jena Economic Research Papers, Volume 2 (2008), Number 2008-045.] (in Adobe [[Portable Document Format|pdf]] format)
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.doxpara.com/read.php/core.html &quot;Why Open Source Is The Optimum Economic Paradigm for Software&quot;] by Dan Kaminsky 1999
&lt;/ref&gt;
A person who creates software is called a [[programmer]], [[software engineer]], [[software developer]], or [[code monkey]], terms that all have a similar meaning.

==Industry and organizations==
{{main|Software industry}}

A great variety of software companies and programmers in the world comprise a software industry. Software can be quite a profitable industry: [[Bill Gates]], the founder of [[Microsoft]] was the richest person in the world in 2009 largely by selling the [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Microsoft Office]] software products. The same goes for [[Larry Ellison]], largely through his [[Oracle database]] software. Through time the software industry has become increasingly specialized.

Non-profit software organizations include the [[Free Software Foundation]], [[GNU Project]] and [[Mozilla Foundation]]. Software standard organizations like the [[W3C]], [[IETF]] develop software standards so that most software can interoperate through standards such as [[XML]], [[HTML]], [[HTTP]] or [[FTP]].

Other well-known large software companies include [[Novell]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Symantec]], [[Adobe Systems]], and [[Corel]], while small companies often provide innovation.

[[Computer Mouse|Mouse]]&lt;/div&gt;]]A [[personal computer]] is made up of multiple physical components of '''computer hardware''', upon which can be installed a system software called an [[operating system]], and a multitude of [[Computer software|software]] applications to perform the operator's desired functions.

Though a PC comes in many different forms, a typical [[personal computer]] consists of a [[Computer case|case]] or chassis in a tower shape (desktop), containing components such as a [[motherboard]].

==Motherboard==
{{Main|Motherboard}}
The motherboard is the main component inside the case. It is a large rectangular board with integrated circuitry that connects the rest of the parts of the computer including the [[CPU]], the [[RAM]], the disk drives ([[CD]], [[DVD]], [[hard disk]], or any others) as well as any peripherals connected via the ports or the expansion slots.

Components directly attached to the motherboard include:
* The '''[[central processing unit]] ('''CPU''')''' performs most of the calculations which enable a computer to function, and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;brain&quot; of the computer.  It is usually [[Computer cooling#Spot cooling|cooled]] by a heat sink and fan.
* The '''[[chip set]]''' mediates communication between the CPU and the other components of the system, including main memory.
* '''[[Random-access memory|RAM]]''' (Random Access Memory) stores resident part of  the current running OS (OS core and so on) and all running processes (application parts, using CPU or input/output (I/O) channels or waiting for CPU or I/O channels).
* The '''[[BIOS]]''' includes boot [[firmware]] and power management.  The '''B'''asic '''I'''nput '''O'''utput '''S'''ystem tasks are handled by [[operating system]] drivers.
* '''Internal [[Bus (computing)|Buses]]''' connect the CPU to various internal components and to expansion cards for graphics and sound.
** '''Current'''
*** The [[Northbridge (computing)|north bridge]] memory controller, for RAM and PCI Express
**** [[PCI Express]], for expansion cards such as graphics and physics processors, and high-end network interfaces
*** [[Conventional PCI|PCI]], for other expansion cards
*** [[Serial ATA|SATA]], for disk drives
*** [[Parallel ATA|ATA]]
** '''Obsolete'''
*** [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] (superseded by PCI Express)
*** [[VESA Local Bus|VLB]] VESA Local Bus (superseded by AGP)
*** [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] (expansion card slot format obsolete in PCs, but still used in industrial computers)
*'''External Bus Controllers''' support ports for external peripherals.  These ports may be controlled directly by the [[Southbridge (computing)|south bridge]] I/O controller or based on expansion cards attached to the motherboard through the PCI bus.
** [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]]
** [[FireWire]]
** [[Serial ATA|eSATA]]
** [[SCSI]]

==Power supply==
{{Main|Power supply unit (computer)}}
[[File:Computer from inside 018.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Inside a custom-built computer: the power supply at the bottom has its own cooling fan.]]A power supply unit (PSU) converts alternating current (AC) electric power to low-voltage DC power for the internal components of the computer. Some power supplies have a switch to change between 230 V and 115 V. Other models have automatic sensors that switch input voltage automatically, or are able to accept any voltage between those limits. Power supply units used in computers are nearly always [[Switch mode power supply|switch mode power supplies (SMPS)]].  The SMPS provides regulated direct current power at the several voltages required by the motherboard and accessories such as disk drives and cooling fans.

{{software development process}}
'''Computer programming''' (often shortened to '''programming''' or '''coding''') is the process of designing, writing, testing, [[debugging]] / [[troubleshooting]], and maintaining the [[source code]] of [[computer program]]s. This source code is written in a [[programming language]]. The purpose of programming is to create a program that exhibits a certain desired behavior. The process of writing source code often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized [[algorithm]]s and [[logic|formal logic]].

==Definition==
{{expand section|alternate definitions of computer programming|date=November 2010}}
Hoc and Nguyen-Xuan define computer programming as &quot;the process of transforming a mental plan in familiar terms into one compatible with the computer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hoc, J.-M. and Nguyen-Xuan, A. Language semantics, mental models and analogy. J.-M. Hoc et al., Eds. Psychology of Programming. Academic Press. London, 1990, 139–156, cited through [http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1015864.1015888 Brad A. Myers, John F. Pane, Andy Ko, Natural programming languages and environments, Communications of the ACM, v.47 n.9, September 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Said another way, programming is the craft of transforming [[requirement]]s into something that a [[computer]] can execute.

==Overview==
Within [[software engineering]], programming (the ''implementation'') is regarded as one phase in a [[software development process]].

There is an ongoing debate on the extent to which the writing of programs is an [[art]], a [[craft]] or an [[engineering]] discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paul Graham |year=2003 |url=http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html |title=Hackers and Painters |accessdate=2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, good programming is considered to be the measured application of all three, with the goal of producing an efficient and evolvable software solution (the criteria for &quot;efficient&quot; and &quot;evolvable&quot; vary considerably). The discipline differs from many other technical professions in that [[programmer]]s, in general, do not need to be licensed or pass any standardized (or governmentally regulated) certification tests in order to call themselves &quot;programmers&quot; or even &quot;software engineers.&quot; However, representing oneself as a &quot;Professional Software Engineer&quot; without a license from an accredited institution is [[Controversies over the term Engineer|illegal in many parts of the world]]. However, because the discipline covers many areas, which may or may not include critical applications, it is debatable whether licensing is required for the profession as a whole.  In most cases, the discipline is self-governed by the entities which require the programming, and sometimes very strict environments are defined (e.g. [[United States Air Force]] use of [[AdaCore]] and security clearance).

Another ongoing debate is the extent to which the [[programming language]] used in writing [[computer program]]s affects the form that the final program takes. This debate is analogous to that surrounding the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth E. Iverson]], the originator of the [[APL (programming language)|APL programming language]], believed that the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis applied to computer languages (without actually mentioning the hypothesis by name).  His [[Turing award]] lecture, &quot;Notation as a tool of thought&quot;, was devoted to this theme, arguing that more powerful notations aided thinking about computer algorithms. Iverson K.E.,&quot;[http://elliscave.com/APL_J/tool.pdf Notation as a tool of thought]&quot;, ''Communications of the ACM'', 23: 444-465 (August 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; in [[linguistics]], which postulates that a particular spoken language's nature influences the habitual thought of its speakers. Different language patterns yield different patterns of thought. This idea challenges the possibility of representing the world perfectly with language, because it acknowledges that the mechanisms of any language condition the thoughts of its speaker community.

One system employed in these devices was the use of pegs and [[cam]]s placed into a wooden drum at specific locations. which would sequentially trigger [[lever]]s that in turn operated [[percussion instrument]]s. The output of this device was a small drummer playing various rhythms and drum patterns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/marcoms/eview/articles58/robot.html A 13th Century Programmable Robot]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}, [[University of Sheffield]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Museum of Music: A History of Mechanical Instruments|first=Charles B.|last=Fowler|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=54|issue=2|date=October 1967|pages=45–49|doi=10.2307/3391092|url=http://jstor.org/stable/3391092|publisher=Music Educators Journal, Vol. 54, No. 2|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jacquard Loom]], which Joseph Marie Jacquard developed in 1801, uses a series of [[Card stock|pasteboard]] cards with holes punched in them. The hole pattern represented the pattern that the loom had to follow in weaving cloth. The loom could produce entirely different weaves using different sets of cards. [[Charles Babbage]] adopted the use of [[punched cards]] around 1830 to control his [[Analytical Engine]]. The synthesis of numerical calculation, predetermined operation and output, along with a way to organize and input instructions in a manner relatively easy for humans to conceive and produce, led to the modern development of computer programming. Development of computer programming accelerated through the [[Industrial Revolution]].

In the late 1880s, [[Herman Hollerith]] invented the recording of data on a medium that could then be read by a machine.  Prior uses of machine readable media, above, had been for control, not data.  &quot;After some initial trials with paper tape, he settled on [[punched card]]s...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/hollerith.html |title=Columbia University Computing History - Herman Hollerith |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To process these punched cards, first known as &quot;Hollerith cards&quot; he invented the [[tabulating machine|tabulator]], and the [[keypunch]] machines. These three inventions were the foundation of the modern information processing industry.  In 1896 he founded the ''[[Tabulating Machine Company]]'' (which later became the core of [[IBM]]). The addition of a [[plugboard|control panel]] (plugboard)&lt;!-- see text in plugboard article, &quot;control panel&quot; is the application specific term for plugboards used in unit record applications --&gt; to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to do different jobs without having to be physically rebuilt. By the late 1940s, there were a variety of control panel programmable machines, called [[unit record equipment]], to perform data-processing tasks. 
[[Image:PunchCardDecks.agr.jpg|thumb|left|Data and instructions could be stored on external [[punched card]]s, which were kept in order and arranged in program decks.]]

The invention of the [[von Neumann architecture]] allowed computer programs to be stored in [[computer memory]]. Early programs had to be painstakingly crafted using the instructions (elementary operations) of the particular machine, often in [[binary numeral system|binary]] notation. Every model of computer would likely use different instructions ([[machine language]]) to do the same task. Later, [[assembly language]]s were developed that let the programmer specify each instruction in a text format, entering abbreviations for each operation code instead of a number and specifying addresses in symbolic form (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL). Entering a program in assembly language is usually more convenient, faster, and less prone to human error than using machine language, but because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine language, any two machines with different instruction sets also have different assembly languages.

In 1954, [[FORTRAN]] was invented; it was the first [[high-level language|high level programming language]] to have a functional implementation, as opposed to just a design on paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=12:10 p.m. ET |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17704662/ |title=Fortran creator John Backus dies - Tech and gadgets- msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.grin.edu/~rebelsky/Courses/CS302/99S/Outlines/outline.02.html |title=CSC-302 99S : Class 02: A Brief History of Programming Languages |publisher=Math.grin.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A high-level language is, in very general terms, any programming language that allows the programmer to write programs in terms that are more [[abstraction (computer science)|abstract]] than assembly language instructions, i.e. at a level of abstraction &quot;higher&quot; than that of an assembly language.)  It allowed programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula directly (e.g. {{nowrap|Y &amp;#0061; X*2 + 5*X + 9}}). The program text, or ''source'', is converted into machine instructions using a special program called a [[compiler]], which translates the FORTRAN program into machine language.  In fact, the name FORTRAN stands for &quot;Formula Translation&quot;.  Many other languages were developed, including some for commercial programming, such as [[COBOL]]. Programs were mostly still entered using punched cards or [[paper tape]]. (See [[computer programming in the punch card era]]). By the late 1960s, [[data storage device]]s and [[computer terminal]]s became inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing directly into the computers. [[Text editor]]s were developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with punched cards. (Usually, an error in punching a card meant that the card had to be discarded and a new one punched to replace it.)

As time has progressed, computers have made giant leaps in the area of processing power. This has brought about newer programming languages that are more abstracted from the underlying hardware. Although these high-level languages usually incur greater [[Computational overhead|overhead]], the increase in speed of modern computers has made the use of these languages much more practical than in the past. These increasingly abstracted languages typically are easier to learn and allow the programmer to develop applications much more efficiently and with less source code. However, high-level languages are still impractical for a few programs, such as those where low-level hardware control is necessary or where maximum processing speed is vital.

Throughout the second half of the twentieth century, programming was an attractive career in most developed countries. Some forms of programming have been increasingly subject to [[offshore outsourcing]] (importing software and services from other countries, usually at a lower wage), making programming career decisions in developed countries more complicated, while increasing economic opportunities in less developed areas. It is unclear how far this trend will continue and how deeply it will impact programmer wages and opportunities. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Quality requirements===
Whatever the approach to software development may be, the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties. The following properties are among the most relevant:
*'''[[Algorithmic efficiency|Efficiency]]'''/'''[[performance engineering|performance]]''': the amount of system resources a program consumes (processor time, memory space, slow devices such as disks, network bandwidth and to some extent even user interaction): the less, the better. This also includes correct disposal of some resources, such as cleaning up [[temporary file]]s and lack of [[memory leak]]s.
*'''[[Reliability engineering#Software reliability|Reliability]]''': how often the results of a program are correct. This depends on conceptual correctness of algorithms, and minimization of programming mistakes, such as mistakes in resource management (e.g., [[buffer overflow]]s and [[race condition]]s) and logic errors (such as division by zero or [[off-by-one error]]s).
*'''[[Robustness (computer science)|Robustness]]''': how well a program anticipates problems not due to programmer error. This includes situations such as incorrect, inappropriate or corrupt data, unavailability of needed resources such as memory, operating system services and network connections, and user error.
*'''[[Usability]]''': the [[ergonomics]] of a program: the ease with which a person can use the program for its intended purpose, or in some cases even unanticipated purposes. Such issues can make or break its success even regardless of other issues. This involves a wide range of textual, graphical and sometimes hardware elements that improve the clarity, intuitiveness, cohesiveness and completeness of a program's user interface.
*'''[[Software portability|Portability]]''': the range of [[computer hardware]] and [[operating system]] platforms on which the [[source code]] of a program can be [[compiler|compiled]]/[[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] and run. This depends on differences in the programming facilities provided by the different platforms, including hardware and operating system resources, expected behaviour of the hardware and operating system, and availability of platform specific compilers (and sometimes libraries) for the language of the source code.
*'''[[Maintainability]]''': the ease with which a program can be modified by its present or future developers in order to make improvements or customizations, fix [[Software bug|bugs]] and [[Vulnerability (computing)|security holes]], or adapt it to new environments. Good practices during initial development make the difference in this regard. This quality may not be directly apparent to the end user but it can significantly affect the fate of a program over the long term.

===Readability of source code===
In computer programming, readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose, control flow, and operation of [[source code]]. It affects the aspects of quality above, including portability, usability and most importantly maintainability.

Readability is important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading, trying to understand and modifying existing source code, rather than writing new source code. Unreadable code often leads to [[software bug|bugs]], inefficiencies, and [[Code duplication|duplicated code]]. A study&lt;ref&gt;James L. Elshoff , Michael Marcotty, [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/358589.358596 Improving computer program readability to aid modification], Communications of the ACM, v.25 n.8, p.512-521, Aug 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; found that a few simple readability transformations made code shorter and drastically reduced the time to understand it.

Following a consistent [[programming style]] often helps readability. However, readability is more than just programming style. Many factors, having little or nothing to do with the ability of the computer to efficiently compile and execute the code, contribute to readability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Readability | title=Readability | author=Multiple (wiki) | work=Docforge | accessdate=2010-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these factors include:
*Different [[indentation style]]s (whitespace)
*[[Comment (computer programming)|Comments]]
*[[decomposition (computer science)|Decomposition]]
*[[Naming conventions (programming)|Naming conventions]] for objects (such as variables, classes, procedures, etc.)

===Algorithmic complexity===
The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely concerned with discovering and implementing the most efficient [[algorithm]]s for a given class of problem. For this purpose, algorithms are classified into ''orders'' using so-called [[Big O notation]], ''O(n)'', which expresses resource use, such as execution time or memory consumption, in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers are familiar with a variety of well-established algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose algorithms that are best suited to the circumstances.

===Methodologies===
The first step in most formal software development projects is requirements analysis, followed by testing to determine value modeling, implementation, and failure elimination ([[debugging]]).
There exist a lot of differing approaches for each of those tasks. One approach popular for [[requirements analysis]] is [[Use Case]] analysis. Nowadays many programmers use forms of [[Agile software development]] where the various stages of formal software development are more integrated together into short cycles that take a few weeks rather than years. There are many approaches to the [[Software development process]].

Popular modeling techniques include Object-Oriented Analysis and Design ([[OOAD]]) and Model-Driven Architecture ([[Model-Driven Architecture|MDA]]). The Unified Modeling Language ([[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]) is a notation used for both the OOAD and MDA.

A similar technique used for database design is Entity-Relationship Modeling ([[Entity-Relationship Model|ER Modeling]]).

Implementation techniques include imperative languages ([[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] or [[procedural programming|procedural]]), [[functional programming|functional languages]], and [[logic programming|logic languages]].

===Measuring language usage===
It is very difficult to determine what are the most popular of modern programming languages. Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications (e.g., [[COBOL]] is still strong in the corporate data center, often on large [[mainframe computer|mainframes]], [[Fortran (programming language)|FORTRAN]] in engineering applications, [[scripting language]]s in web development, and [[C (programming language)|C]] in [[embedded software|embedded applications]]), while some languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications. Also many applications use a mix of several languages in their construction and use.

Methods of [[measuring programming language popularity]] include: counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2007/09/11/226631/sslcomputer-weekly-it-salary-survey-finance-boom-drives-it-job.htm Survey of Job advertisements mentioning a given language]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the number of books teaching the language that are sold (this overestimates the importance of newer languages), and estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language (this underestimates the number of users of business languages such as COBOL).

===Debugging===
[[Image:H96566k.jpg|thumb|A [[Software bug|bug]], which was debugged in 1947]]
[[Debugging]] is a very important task in the software development process, because an incorrect program can have significant consequences for its users. Some languages are more prone to some kinds of faults because their specification does not require [[compiler]]s to perform as much checking as other languages. Use of a [[static analysis]] tool can help detect some possible problems.

Debugging is often done with [[Integrated development environment|IDE]]s like [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], [[Kdevelop]], [[NetBeans]], [[Code::Blocks]], and [[Visual Studio]]. Standalone debuggers like [[gdb]] are also used, and these often provide less of a visual environment, usually using a [[command line]].

==Programming languages==
{{Main|Programming language|List of programming languages}}

Different programming languages support different styles of programming (called ''[[programming paradigm]]s''). The choice of language used is subject to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task, availability of third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the programming language best suited for the task at hand will be selected. Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers who know the language to build a team, the availability of [[compiler]]s for that language, and the efficiency with which programs written in a given language execute. Languages form an approximate spectrum from &quot;low-level&quot; to &quot;high-level&quot;; &quot;low-level&quot; languages are typically more machine-oriented and faster to execute, whereas &quot;high-level&quot; languages are more abstract and easier to use but execute less quickly. It is usually easier to code in &quot;high-level&quot; languages than in &quot;low-level&quot; ones.

Allen Downey, in his book ''How To Think Like A Computer Scientist'', writes:

:The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language:
:*'''input''': Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.
:*'''output''': Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.
:*'''arithmetic''': Perform basic arithmetical operations like addition and multiplication.
:*'''conditional execution''': Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements.
:*'''repetition''': Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.

Many computer languages provide a mechanism to call functions provided by libraries such as in [[Dynamic Link Library|.dlls]]. Provided the functions in a library follow the appropriate run time conventions (e.g., method of passing arguments), then these functions may be written in any other language.

{{Italic title}}
[[Image:Boethius.consolation.philosophy.jpg|thumb|right|This early printed book has many hand-painted illustrations depicting Lady Philosophy and scenes of daily life in fifteenth-century [[Ghent]] (1485)]]

'''''Consolation of Philosophy''''' ({{lang-la|'''Consolatio Philosophiae'''}}) is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] work by [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]], written around the year 524. It has been described as the single most important and influential work in the West on [[Medieval]] and early [[Renaissance]] [[Christianity]], and is also the last great Western work that can be called Classical.&lt;ref&gt;''The Consolation of Philosophy (Oxford World's Classics)'', Introduction (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dante Divine&quot;&gt;[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] placed Boethius the “last of the Romans and first of the Scholastics” among the doctors in his Paradise (see ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'') (see also below).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consolation of Philosophy ==
{{cquote|A golden volume not unworthy of the leisure of [[Plato]] or [[Cicero|Tully]] -- &lt;small&gt;[[Edward Gibbon]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Consolation of Philosophy'' was written during a one-year imprisonment Boethius served while awaiting trial &amp;ndash; and eventual horrific execution &amp;ndash; for the crime of [[treason]] under the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] King [[Theodoric the Great]]. Boethius was at the very heights of power in [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and was brought down by treachery. This experience inspired the text, which reflects on how evil can exist in a world governed by God (the problem of [[theodicy]]), and how happiness can be attainable amidst fickle fortune, while also considering the nature of happiness and God. It has been described as &quot;by far the most interesting example of [[prison literature]] the world has ever seen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia. The quote is commonly seen in a number of sources, but without attribution; the Catholic Encyclopedia article is the oldest “known” citation found.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though reference is often made to God, the book is not strictly religious. A link is often assumed, yet there is no reference made to Jesus Christ or Christianity or any other specific religion. God is however represented not only as an eternal and all-knowing being, but as the source of all Good.

Boethius writes the book as a conversation between himself and Lady Philosophy. She consoles Boethius by discussing the transitory nature of fame and wealth (&quot;no man can ever truly be secure until he has been forsaken by Fortune&quot;), and the ultimate superiority of things of the mind, which she calls the &quot;one true good&quot;. She contends that happiness comes from within, and that one's virtue is all that one truly has, because it is not imperilled by the vicissitudes of fortune.

Boethius engages questions such as the nature of [[predestination]] and [[free will]], why [[Problem of evil|evil men often prosper]] and good men fall into ruin, [[human nature]], [[virtue]], and [[justice]]. He speaks about the nature of free will versus [[determinism]] when he asks if God knows and sees all, or does man have free will. To quote V.E. Watts on Boethius, ''God is like a spectator at a chariot race; He watches the action the charioteers perform, but this does not cause them.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Consolation of Philosophy'' (Penguin Classics), Introduction, xxxi, 2000. ISBN 0140447806. [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0140447806&amp;id=tdoTDYYuWSoC&amp;pg=PR31&amp;lpg=PR31&amp;ots=Bxcv4SRC4K&amp;dq=%22God+is+like+a+spectator+at+a+chariot+race%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;sig=WsI8gtbOQNjDuTixQRDfGl08vhg]&lt;/ref&gt; On human nature, Boethius says that humans are essentially good and only when they give in to “wickedness” do they “sink to the level of being an animal.” On justice, he says criminals are not to be abused, rather treated with sympathy and respect, using the analogy of doctor and patient to illustrate the ideal relationship between prosecutor and criminal.

In the ''Consolation'', Boethius answered religious questions without reference to Christianity, relying solely on natural philosophy and the Classical [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] tradition. He believed in harmony between faith and reason. The truths found in Christianity would be no different from the truths found in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Chadwick| first = Henry | editor = Edward Craig| encyclopedia = Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy | title = Boethius, Anicius Manlius Severinus (c.480-525/6)| year = 1998| publisher = Routledge|quote=The ''Opuscula sacra'' regard faith and reason as independent but parallel and compatible ways of attaining to higher metaphysical truths, and the independent validity of logical reasoning is also an underlying presupposition throughout ''De consolatione''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Henry Chadwick, &quot;If the ''Consolation'' contains nothing distinctively Christian, it is also relevant that it contains nothing specifically pagan either...[it] is a work written by a Platonist who is also a Christian, but is not a Christian work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Chadwick, ''Boethius: The Consolations of Music, Logic, Theology and Philosophy'', 1990, ISBN 0-19-826549-2&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Carolingian]] epoch to the end of the Middle Ages and beyond, this was the most widely copied work of secular literature in Europe. It was one of the most popular and influential philosophical works, read by statesmen, poets, and historians, as well as of philosophers and theologians. It is through Boethius that much of the thought of the Classical period was made available to the Western Medieval world. It has often been said Boethius was the “last of the Romans and the first of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]]”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dante Divine&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Consolation of philosophy 1385 boethius images.jpg|thumb|200px|From a 1385 Italian manuscript of the ''Consolation'': Miniatures of Boethius teaching and in prison]]

The philosophical message of the book fits well with the religious piety of the Middle Ages. Readers were encouraged not to seek worldly goods such as money and power, but to seek internalized virtues. Evil had a purpose, to provide a lesson to help change for good; while suffering from evil was seen as virtuous. Because God ruled the universe through Love, prayer to God and the application of Love would lead to true happiness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck&quot;&gt;Sanderson Beck (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The Middle Ages, with their vivid sense of an overruling fate, found in Boethius an interpretation of life closely akin to the spirit of Christianity. The ''Consolation of Philosophy'' stands, by its note of fatalism and its affinities with the Christian doctrine of humility, midway between the pagan philosophy of [[Seneca the Younger]] and the later Christian philosophy of consolation represented by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature]]'', [http://www.bartleby.com/211/0605.html Volume I Ch.6.5: ''De Consolatione Philosophiae''], 1907–1921.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is heavily influenced by [[Plato]] and his [[Socratic Dialogue|dialogues]] (as was Boethius himself). Its popularity can in part be explained by its [[neoplatonic]] and Christian ethical messages, although current scholarly research is still far from clear exactly why and how the work became so vastly popular in the Middle Ages. Notably, the book has not received much attention in the recent modern era, possibly in part because of its foreign inward looking virtues and rejection of the modern emphasis on material productiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck&quot; /&gt; As Sanderson Beck says of the Middle Ages:

[[Image:ForutuneWheel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Lady Fortune]] with [[the Wheel of Fortune]] in a medieval manuscript of a work by [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]; ''Consolation of Philosophy'' was responsible for the popularity of the goddess of Fortune and the wheel of fortune in the Middle Ages]]

: “Who can say that this inward period of humanity did not prepare the way for the productiveness of the Renaissance like a person quiets one's consciousness in contemplation and prayer before creating a great work of art or literature or science? The Middle Ages were difficult times politically and economically, but who can estimate how much happiness they inwardly received from the Consolation of Philosophy?”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck&quot; /&gt;

Translations into the [[vernacular]] were done by famous notables, including [[King Alfred]] ([[Old English language|Old English]]), [[Jean de Meun]] ([[Old French]]), [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] ([[Middle English]]), [[Queen Elizabeth I]] ([[Early Modern English]]), and [[Notker Labeo]] ([[Old High German]]).

Found within ''Consolation'' are themes that have echoed throughout the Western canon: the female figure of wisdom that informs Dante, the ascent through the layered universe that is shared with Milton, the reconciliation of opposing forces that find their way into Chaucer in The Knight's Tale, and the Wheel of Fortune so popular throughout the Middle Ages.

Citations from it occur frequently in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divina Commedia]]''. Of Boethius, Dante remarked ''“The blessed soul who exposes the deceptive world to anyone who gives ear to him.”&lt;ref&gt;''Dante ''The Divine Comedy''. “blessed souls” inhabit Dante's Paradise, and appear as flames. (see note above).&lt;/ref&gt;

Boethian influence can be found nearly everywhere in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s poetry, e.g. in ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', ''[[The Knight's Tale]]'', ''[[The Clerk's Tale]]'', ''[[The Franklin's Tale]]'', ''[[The Parson's Tale]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Melibee]]'', in the character of Lady Nature in ''[[The Parliament of Fowls]]'' and some of the shorter poems, such as ''Truth'', ''The Former Age'' and ''Lak of Stedfastnesse''. Chaucer translated the work in his ''[[Boece (Chaucer)|Boece]]''.

The [[Italians|Italian]] composer [[Luigi Dallapiccola]] used some of the text in his choral work ''[[Canti di prigionia]]'' (1938).  The [[Australia]]n composer [[Peter Sculthorpe]] quoted parts of it in his opera or music theatre work ''[[Rites of Passage (Sculthorpe)|Rites of Passage]]'' (1972-73), which was commissioned for the opening of the [[Sydney Opera House]] but was not ready in time.

[[Tom Shippey]] in ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'' says how “Boethian” much of the treatment of evil is in [[Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Shippey says that Tolkien knew well the translation of Boethius that was made by King Alfred and he quotes some “Boethian” remarks from [[Frodo]], [[Treebeard]] and [[Elrond]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''The Road to Middle-earth'', pg. 140, ISBN 0-395-33973-1, (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Boethius and ''Consolatio Philosophiae'' are cited frequently by the main character Ignatius J. Reilly in the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[A Confederacy of Dunces]]'' (1980).

It is a [[prosimetrum|prosimetrical]] text, meaning that it is written in alternating sections of [[prose]] and metered [[Meter (poetry)|verse]]. In the course of the text, Boethius displays a virtuosic command of the forms of [[Latin poetry]]. It is classified as a [[Menippean satire]], a fusion of [[allegory|allegorical]] tale, [[platonic dialogue]], and lyrical poetry.

In the 20th century there were close to four hundred manuscripts still surviving, a testament to its former popularity.

'''''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon''''' (臥虎藏龍, Wò Hǔ Cáng Lóng) is a 2000 [[wuxia]] [[Martial arts film|martial arts]] film. A [[Taiwanese film|Taiwan]]-[[Chinese film|Chinese]]-[[Hong Kong film|Hong Kong]]-[[American film|American]] [[Co-production (film)|co-production]], the film was directed by [[Ang Lee]] and featured an international cast of ethnic Chinese actors, including [[Chow Yun-fat]], [[Michelle Yeoh]], [[Zhang Ziyi]], and [[Chang Chen]]. The film was based on [[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (novel)|the fourth novel]] in a [[pentalogy]], known in China as the ''[[Crane Iron Pentalogy]]'', by ''wuxia'' novelist [[Wang Dulu]]. The martial arts and [[Stage combat|action sequences]] were choreographed by [[Yuen Wo Ping]].

Made on a mere US$15 million budget, with dialogue in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' became a surprise international success. After its US [[Film premiere|premiere]] at the [[Hawaii International Film Festival]], it grossed US$128 million in the United States and $213.5 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing foreign-language film in American history. It has won over 40 awards. The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] ([[Republic of China|Taiwan]]) and three other Academy Awards, and was nominated for six other Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mojo&quot;&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/oscar/movies/?id=crouchingtigerhiddendragon.htm Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]. ''Box Office Mojo''. Accessed December 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The film also won three ''[[BAFTAs]]'' and two ''[[Golden Globes]]'', one for &quot;Best Foreign Film&quot; as well as additional nominations for ten ''[[BAFTA]]s'' including &quot;Best Picture&quot;.

==Plot==
The film is set in the [[Qing Dynasty]] during [[Emperor Qianlong]]'s 43rd year of reign (1779).  Li Mu Bai ([[Chow Yun-fat]]) is an accomplished [[Wudangquan|Wudan]] swordsman. Long ago, his master was murdered by Jade Fox ([[Cheng Pei-pei]]), a woman who sought to learn Wudang skills. Mu Bai is also a good friend of Yu Shu Lien ([[Michelle Yeoh]]), a female warrior. Mu Bai and Shu Lien have developed feelings for each other, but have never acknowledged or acted on them. Mu Bai, intending to give up his warrior life, asks Shu Lien to transport his sword, also referred to as the ''Green Destiny'', to the city of [[Beijing]], as a gift for their friend, Sir Te ([[Sihung Lung]]). At Sir Te's estate, Shu Lien meets Jen ([[Zhang Ziyi]]), the daughter of Governor Yu (Fa Zeng Li), a visiting [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]. Jen, destined for an arranged marriage and yearning for adventure, seems envious of Shu Lien's warrior lifestyle.

One evening, a masked thief sneaks into Sir Te's estate and steals the sword. Mu Bai and Shu Lien, with the assistance of Sir Te's servant Master Bo (Xian Gao), trace the theft to Governor Yu's compound and learn that Jade Fox has been posing as Jen's governess for many years. Bo makes the acquaintance of Inspector Tsai (De Ming Wang), a police investigator from the provinces, and his daughter, May (Li Li), who have come to Beijing in pursuit of Jade Fox, who had murdered Tsai's wife years before. While the three are eating lunch, Jade Fox fires a dart with a written message attached to it, challenging them to a showdown that night. Following a protracted battle, the group is on the verge of defeat when Mu Bai arrives and outmaneuvers Jade Fox. Before Mu Bai can kill Jade Fox, the masked thief reappears and partners with Jade Fox to fight. Jade Fox resumes the fight and kills Tsai before fleeing with the thief (who is revealed to be Jade Fox's protegée, Jen). After seeing Jen fight Mu Bai, Jade Fox realizes Jen had been secretly studying the Wudang manual and has surpassed her in skill. After finding out that Tsai was a police officer, a guilt-ridden Jen returns the Green Destiny to Sir Te's estate but is intercepted by Mu Bai. Mu Bai easily defeats her and offers her to become his pupil. Jen angrily rebukes his offer and flees.  When she returns home, Jen confronts Jade Fox and banishes her from the Governor's compound.

That night, a desert bandit named Lo ([[Chang Chen]]) breaks into Jen's bedroom and asks her to leave with him. A flashback reveals that in the past, when Governor Yu and his family were traveling in the western deserts, Lo (also referred to as &quot;Dark Cloud&quot;) and his bandits had raided Jen's caravan; Lo took an heirloom comb from Jen and she pursued him to get it back, but succumbed to exhaustion in the desert. Lo took her to his cave hideout, from which she escaped (knocking Lo out in the process) only to pass out again; when she awoke she was back in the cave again and Lo had tied her up (to keep her from attacking him again). However, Lo and Jen soon fell passionately in love. Lo eventually convinced Jen to return to her family, though not before telling her a legend of a man who jumped off a cliff to make his wishes come true. Because the man's heart was pure, he did not die. Lo came to Beijing to persuade Jen not to go through with her arranged marriage. However, Jen refuses to leave with him; he gives back the stolen comb before he goes. Later, Lo interrupts Jen's wedding procession, begging her to come away with him. Nearby, Shu Lien and Mu Bai convince Lo to wait for Jen at [[Wudang Mountains|Wudang Mountain]], where he will be safe from Jen's family, who are furious with him and have vowed to hunt him down and kill him.

After the wedding, Jen runs away and steals the Green Destiny again. Mu Bai, Shu Lien, and Lo are ordered to find and retrieve Jen. Jen visits Shu Lien at one of her dojos, who tells her that Lo is waiting for her at Wudang Mountain. After an angry dispute, the two women engage in a duel. Wielding the ''Green Destiny'', Jen gains the upper hand by destroying every weapon that Shu Lien uses, despite being on the defensive more often than not. But Shu Lien finally uses this to her advantage, surprising Jen by pressing a broken sword to her throat. However, rather than acknowledging her defeat and handing over the sword, Jen injures Shu Lien when she lowers her broken weapon. Mu Bai arrives and pursues Jen into a bamboo forest. A duel ensues where Mu Bai over comes a challenge Jen sets before him (to determine whether she will be his pupil), regaining possession of the ''Green Destiny''. But when Jen still refuses his offer, Mu Bai realizes that she is without honor, thus unworthy of becoming his pupil despite her skills  and throws the sword over a waterfall. In pursuit, Jen dives into an adjoining river to retrieve the sword, and is then rescued by Fox. Fox puts Jen into a drugged sleep and places her in a cavern; Mu Bai, Shu Lien and Bo discover her there. Fox suddenly reappears and attacks the others with poisoned darts. Mu Bai blocks the needles with his sword and avenges his master's death by mortally wounding Fox, only to realize that one of the darts hit him in the neck. Fox dies, confessing that her goal had been to kill Jen, because she was furious that Jen hid the secrets of Wudan from her.

As Jen runs off to prepare the antidote for the poisoned dart, Mu Bai prepares to die. With his last breaths, he finally confesses his love for Shu Lien, and dies in her arms as Jen returns too late to save him. The ''Green Destiny'' is returned back to Sir Te. Jen later goes to Wudang Mountain and spends one last night with Lo. The next morning, Lo finds Jen standing on a balcony overlooking the edge of the mountain. In an echo of the legend that they spoke about in the desert, she asks him to make a wish. He complies, wishing for them to be together, back in the desert. Jen then leaps over the side of the mountain into the clouds.

==Production==
Although its [[Academy Award]] was presented to Taiwan, ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' was in fact an international [[Co-production (film)|co-production]] between companies in four regions: the Chinese company [[China Film Co-Production Corporation]]; the American companies [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia]], [[Sony Pictures Classics]] and [[Good Machine]]; the Hong Kong company EDKO Film; and the Taiwanese Zoom Hunt International Productions Company, Ltd; as well as the unspecified United China Vision, and Asia Union Film &amp; Entertainment Ltd., created solely for this film.

The film was made in Beijing, with location shooting in the [[Anhui]], [[Hebei]], [[Jiangsu]] and [[Xinjiang]] provinces of China.

===Post-development===
A [[Taiwan]]ese TV serial was made based on the original novel. It was later compiled into a DVD film titled ''[[New Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' in the West in 2004. The DVD film was over an hour and half longer than the original theatrical film.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
''Crouching Tiger'' was very well received in the Western world, receiving critical acclaim and numerous awards. The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 97% of critics gave ''Crouching Tiger'' positive reviews, based on 143 reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/crouching_tiger_hidden_dragon/ |title=Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (1999) |accessdate=July 27, 2010 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Metacritic]] reported the film had an average score of 93 out of 100, based on 31 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon |title=Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon |accessdate=July 21, 2008 |publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, however ''Crouching Tiger'' was widely dismissed as just another '[[wuxia]]' film among many others. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Some Chinese-speaking viewers were bothered by the accents of the leading actors. Neither Chow (a native [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] speaker) nor Yeoh (who was born and raised in Malaysia) speaks [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] as a [[mother tongue]]. All four main actors spoke with different accents: Chow speaks with a Cantonese accent;&lt;ref&gt;Hu, Brian (December 20, 2006). [http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=59579 An Accent on Acting: An Interview with Gong Li]. ''UCLA Asia Institute''. Accessed December 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Yeoh with a Malaysian accent; Chang Chen a Taiwanese accent; and Zhang Ziyi a Beijing accent. Yeoh responded to this complaint in a December 28, 2000, interview with ''[[Cinescape]]''. She argued that &quot;My character lived outside of Beijing, and so I didn't have to do the Beijing accent&quot;. When the interviewer, Craig Reid, remarked that &quot;My mother-in-law has this strange [[Sichuan]]-Mandarin accent that's hard for me to understand&quot;, Yeoh responded: &quot;Yes, provinces all have their very own strong accents. When we first started the movie, Cheng Pei Pei was going to have her accent, and Chang Zhen was going to have his accent, and this person would have that accent. And in the end nobody could understand what they were saying. Forget about us, even the crew from Beijing thought this was all weird&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Craig (December 28, 2000).

The film led to a boost in popularity of Chinese wuxia films in the western world, where they were previously little known, and led to films such as ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' marketed towards western audiences. The film also provided the breakthrough role for [[Zhang Ziyi]]'s career, who noted that:

{{quote|Because of movies like ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'', and ''Hero'' and ''Memoirs of a Geisha'', a lot of people in the United States have become interested not only in me but in Chinese and Asian actors in general. Because of these movies, maybe there will be more opportunities for Asian actors&quot;.}}

The film also ranks at #497 on [[Empire (magazine)|''Empire'' magazine]]'s 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time, and at number 230 on [[Internet Movie Database|IMDB]]'s user voted Top 250 Films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empireonline.com/500/1.asp The 500 Greatest Movies Of All Time]. ''Empire''. Accessed July 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of Lo, or &quot;Dark Cloud,&quot; the desert bandit, influenced the development of the [[protagonist]] of the ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' series of video games.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Prince of Persia'': Anatomy of a Prince&quot;, ''PlayStation: The Official Magazine'' 13 (December 2008): 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
Gathering widespread critical acclaim at the [[Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto]] and [[New York Film Festival|New York]] [[film festival]]s, the film also became a favorite when [[Academy Awards]] nominations were announced in 2001. The film was however screened out of competition at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;festival-cannes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/10532/year/2000.html |title=Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon |accessdate=October 17, 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charlemagne''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|ʃ|ɑr|l|ɨ|m|eɪ|n}};  {{IPA-fr|ʃaʁ.lə.maɲ}}; {{lang-de|Karl der Große}}, {{lang-la|Carolus Magnus'' or ''Karolus Magnus}}, meaning '''Charles the Great'''; possibly 742{{ndash}}28 January 814) was [[List of Frankish kings|King of the Franks]] from 768 and [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]] (''Imperator Romanorum'') from 800 to his death in 814. He expanded the [[Franks|Frankish]] kingdom into an [[Carolingian Empire|empire]] that incorporated much of [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]]. During his reign, he conquered [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Italy]] and was [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] {{lang|la|''Imperator Augustus''}} by [[Pope Leo III]] on 25 December 800. This temporarily made him a rival of the [[Byzantine Emperor]] in [[Constantinople]]. His rule is also associated with the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], a revival of art, religion, and culture through the medium of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. Through his foreign conquests and internal reforms, Charlemagne helped define both [[Western Europe]] and the Middle Ages. He is numbered as '''Charles I''' in the regnal lists of [[List of German monarchs|Germany]], the [[Holy Roman Emperors|Holy Roman Empire]], and [[List of French monarchs|France]].

The son of King [[Pepin the Short]] and [[Bertrada of Laon]], a Frankish queen, he succeeded his father in 768 and co-ruled with his brother [[Carloman I of the Franks|Carloman I]]. The latter got on badly with Charlemagne, but war was prevented by the sudden death of Carloman in 771. Charlemagne continued the policy of his father towards the [[papacy]] and became its protector, removing the [[Lombards]] from power in Italy, and leading an incursion into Muslim Spain, to which he was invited by the Muslim governor of Barcelona. Charlemagne was promised several Iberian cities in return for giving military aid to the governor; however, the deal was withdrawn. Subsequently, Charlemagne's retreating army experienced its worst defeat at the hands of the [[Basques]], at the [[Battle of Roncesvalles]] (778) (memorialised, although heavily fictionalised, in the ''[[Song of Roland]]''). He also campaigned against the peoples to his east, especially the [[Saxons]], and after a protracted war subjected them to his rule. By forcibly [[Christianization|Christianizing]] the Saxons and banning on penalty of death their native [[Germanic paganism]], he integrated them into his realm and thus paved the way for the later [[Ottonian dynasty]].

Today he is regarded not only as the founding father of both [[List of French monarchs|French]] and [[List of German monarchs|German]] monarchies, but also as a ''Pater Europae'' (father of Europe)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.karlspreis.de/preistraeger/seine_heiligkeit_papst_johannes_paul_ii/ansprache_von_seiner_heiligkeit_papst_johannes_paul_ii.html&lt;/ref&gt;: his empire united most of Western Europe for the first time since the Romans, and the Carolingian renaissance encouraged the formation of a common European identity.&lt;ref&gt;Riché, Preface xviii, Pierre Riché reflects: &quot;[H]e enjoyed an exceptional destiny, and by the length of his reign, by his conquests, legislation and legendary stature, he also profoundly marked the history of Western Europe.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Albrecht Dürer 047.jpg|thumb|left|''Kaiser Karl der Große'' (1512) by [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]
By the 6th century, the [[Germanic peoples|West Germanic]] [[Franks]] were [[Germanic Christianity|Christianised]] and [[Francia]], ruled by the [[Merovingians]], had become the most powerful of the kingdoms which succeeded the [[Western Roman Empire]]. But following the [[Battle of Tertry]], the Merovingians declined into a state of powerlessness, for which they have been dubbed the do-nothing kings (''[[rois fainéants]]''). Almost all government powers of any consequence were exercised by their chief officer, the [[mayor of the palace]] or ''major domus''.

In 687, [[Pippin of Herstal]], mayor of the palace of [[Austrasia]], ended the strife between various kings and their mayors with his victory at Tertry and became the sole governor of the entire Frankish kingdom. Pippin himself was the grandson of two of the most important figures of the Austrasian Kingdom, Saint [[Arnulf of Metz]] and [[Pippin of Landen]]. Pippin the Middle was eventually succeeded by his illegitimate son Charles, later known as [[Charles Martel]] (the Hammer). After 737, Charles governed the Franks without a king on the throne but declined to call himself &quot;king&quot;. Charles was succeeded by his sons [[Carloman, son of Charles Martel|Carloman]] and [[Pepin the Short]], the father of Charlemagne. To curb separatism in the periphery of the realm, the brothers placed on the throne [[Childeric III]], who was to be the last Merovingian king.

After Carloman resigned his office, Pepin, with [[Pope Zachary]]'s approval, had Childeric III deposed. In 751, Pepin was elected and anointed King of the Franks and in 754 [[Pope Stephen II]] again anointed him and his young sons, now heirs to the great realm which already covered most of western and central Europe. Thus was the Merovingian dynasty replaced by the [[Carolingian]] dynasty, named after Pepin's father, Charles Martel.

Under the new dynasty, the Frankish kingdom spread to encompass an area including most of Western Europe. The division of that kingdom formed [[History of France|France]] and [[History of Germany|Germany]];&lt;ref&gt;Oman, Charles. ''The Dark Ages 476–919'' Rivingtons: London, 1914. Regards Charlemagne's grandsons as the first kings of France and Germany, which at the time comprised the whole of the Carolingian Empire save Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Religion|religious]], [[Politics|political]], and [[art]]istic evolutions originating from a centrally positioned Francia made a defining imprint on the whole of Western Europe.

==Personal traits==
===Date and place of birth===
Charlemagne is believed to have been born in 741; however, several factors have led to a reconsideration of this date. First, the year 742 was calculated from his age given at death, rather than from attestation in primary sources. Another date is given in the ''[[Annales Petaviani]]'', that of 2 April{{Failed verification|date=June 2010}} 747.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The year is given as 747 in ''Annales Petaviani'' [&quot;''Et ipso anno fuit natus Karolus rex''.&quot; ''Annales Petaviani'', [[Sub anno|s.a.]] 747, [http://sbaldw.home.mindspring.com/hproject/prov/charl000.htm MGH SS 1:11.]&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, 2 April was at [[Easter]]. The birth of an emperor at Eastertime is a coincidence likely to provoke comment, but there was no such comment documented in 747, leading some to suspect that the Easter birthday was a [[pious fiction]] concocted as a way of honoring the Emperor. Other commentators weighing the primary records have suggested that his birth was one year later, in 748. At present, it is impossible to be certain of the date of the birth of Charlemagne. The best guesses include  1 April 747, after  15 April 747, or  1 April 748, in [[Herstal]] (where his father was born, a town close to [[Liège (city)|Liège]] in modern day [[Belgium]]), the region from where both the Merovingian and Carolingian families originated. He went to live in his father's villa in [[Jupille]] when he was around seven, which caused Jupille to be listed as a possible place of birth in almost every history book. Other cities have been suggested, including, [[Prüm]], [[Düren]], [[Gauting]] and [[Aachen]].
[[File:Karl der Grosse - Pippin der Bucklige.jpg|left|thumb|Charlemagne (left) and [[Pippin the Hunchback]]. Tenth-century copy of a lost original from about 830.]]

Dubbed ''Charles le Magne'' &quot;Charles the Great&quot;, he was named after his grandfather, [[Charles Martel]].  The name derives from Germanic *''karlaz'' &quot;free man, commoner&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/voornamen/VNB/index.php?id=10650&amp;act=zoeken Etymology of &quot;Charles/Karl/Karel&quot;] {{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gave German ''Kerl'' &quot;man, guy&quot; and English ''[[churl]]''. His name, however, is first attested in its Latin form, &quot;''Carolus''&quot; or &quot;''Karolus''.&quot;

In many European languages, the very word for &quot;king&quot; derives from Charles' name (''e.g.'', {{lang-pl|król}}, {{lang-cs|král}}, {{lang-lt|karalius}}, {{lang-lv|karalis}}, {{lang-hu|király}}, {{lang-bg|крал}}, {{lang-sr|краљ}}, {{lang-hr|kralj}}, {{lang-ru|король}}, {{lang-tr|kral}}, {{lang-sk|kráľ}}))

===Language===
Charlemagne's [[native language]] was undoubtedly{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} a form of [[Germanic languages|Germanic idiom]]; however, the specifics as to which remain a matter of controversy. It was probably a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[dialect]] of the [[Ripuarian Franks]], but [[Linguistics|linguists]]{{Who|date=May 2011}} differ on its identity and chronology. Some linguists go so far as to say that he did not speak [[Old Frankish]]. Old Frankish is reconstructed from its descendant, [[Old Dutch|Old Low Franconian]], which would give rise to the Dutch language and to the modern dialects in the German North Rhineland, which were dubbed Ripuarian in modern times. Another important source are loanwords in [[Old French]]. Linguists know very little about Old Frankish, as it is attested mainly as phrases and words in the law codes of the main Frankish tribes (especially those of the Salian and Ripuarian Franks), which are written in Latin interspersed with Germanic elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/loisalique/loi2.htm Original text of the Salic law.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Franconian language had been replaced with an [[Old High German]] form in the area comprising the contemporary Southern Rhineland, The Palatinate South Hessen and Northern parts of Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria. The present Dutch language area along with the modern Ripuarian areas in the North Rhine region preserved a form of Franconian dubbed [[Old Dutch|Old Low Franconian]] or [[Old Low Franconian|Old Dutch]].

The area of Charlemagne's birth does not make determination of his native language easier. Most historians agree he was born around [[Liège (city)|Liège]], like his father, but some say he was born in or around [[Aachen]], some {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} away. At that time, this was an area of some linguistic diversity. Dialects around Liège (around 750) included:
* Old East Low Franconian in the city, north and northwest;
* the closely related Old [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian Franconian]] to the east and in Aachen; and
* [[Gallo-Romance]] (the ancestor of the [[Walloon language|Walloon]] dialect of Old French) in the south and southwest.

The names he gave his [[Charlemegne#Marriages and heirs|children]] may be indicators of the language he spoke, as all of his daughters received [[Old High German]] names.

Apart from his native language he also spoke [[Latin]] &quot;as fluently as his own tongue&quot; and understood a bit of Greek: ''Grecam vero melius intellegere quam pronuntiare poterat'', &quot;He understood Greek better than he could pronounce it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Einhard, ''Life'', 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a fifteenth century Irish source, he also spoke Arabic. In the 'Gabhaltais Shearluis Mhoir' or 'Conquests of Charlemagne' from the Book of Lismore edited by Douglas Hyde, ch. 10, p.&amp;nbsp;35:
&lt;blockquote&gt; When Agiolandus heard the Saracen language from Charles he marvelled at it greatly.  For when Charles was a youth he had been among the Paynims in the city which is called Toletum (Toledo) and he had learnt the language of the Saracens in that city.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Personal appearance===
Although no description from Charlemagne's lifetime exists, his personal appearance is known from a good description by [[Einhard]], author of the biography ''[[Vita Karoli Magni]]''. Einhard tells in his twenty-second chapter:&lt;ref&gt;''Charlemagne'' By Alessandro Barbero, Allan Cameron ''P. 116''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was heavily built, sturdy, and of considerable stature, although not exceptionally so, since his height was seven times the length of his own foot. He had a round head, large and lively eyes, a slightly larger nose than usual, white but still attractive hair, a bright and cheerful expression, a short and fat neck, and he enjoyed good health, except for the fevers that affected him in the last few years of his life. Toward the end he dragged one leg. Even then, he stubbornly did what he wanted and refused to listen to doctors, indeed he detested them, because they wanted to persuade him to stop eating roast meat, as was his wont, and to be content with boiled meat.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The physical portrait provided by Einhard is confirmed by contemporary depictions of the emperor, such as coins and his 8-inch bronze statue kept in the [[Louvre]]. In 1861, Charlemagne's tomb was opened by scientists who reconstructed his skeleton and estimated it to be  measured 74.9&amp;nbsp;inches (190 centimeters).&lt;ref&gt;''Charlemagne'' By Alessandro Barbero, Allan Cameron ''P. 118''&lt;/ref&gt; A modern study based on the dimensions of his [[tibia]] estimated his height as 1.84 m. This puts him in the 99th [[percentile]] of tall people of his period, given that average male height of his time was 1.69 m. The width of the bone suggested he was gracile but not robust in body build&lt;ref&gt;Ruhli, F.J, Blumich B, Henneberg M. (2010). Charlemagne was very tall, but not robust. Economics and Human Biology 8 289–290. {{doi|10.1016/j.ehb.2009.12.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles is well known to have been fair-haired, tall, and stately, with a disproportionately thick neck. The Roman tradition of realistic personal portraiture was in complete eclipse in his time, where individual traits were submerged in [[icon]]ic typecastings. Charlemagne, as an ideal ruler, ought to be portrayed in the corresponding fashion, any contemporary would have assumed. The images of enthroned Charlemagne, God's representative on Earth, bear more connections to the icons of Christ in majesty than to modern (or antique) conceptions of portraiture. Charlemagne in later imagery (as in the [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]] portrait) is often portrayed with flowing blond hair, due to a misunderstanding of Einhard, who describes Charlemagne as having ''canitie pulchra'', or &quot;beautiful white hair&quot;, which has been rendered as blonde or fair in many translations.

===Dress===
Charlemagne wore the traditional, inconspicuous and distinctly non-aristocratic [[Early medieval European dress|costume of the Frankish people]], described by Einhard thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He used to wear the national, that is to say, the Frank dress: next to his skin a linen shirt and linen breeches, and above these a tunic fringed with silk; while hose fastened by bands covered his lower limbs, and shoes his feet, and he protected his shoulders and chest in winter by a close-fitting coat of otter or marten skins.&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

He wore a blue cloak and always carried a sword with him. The typical sword was of a golden or silver hilt. He wore fancy jewelled swords to banquets or ambassadorial receptions. Nevertheless:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He despised foreign costumes, however handsome, and never allowed himself to be robed in them, except twice in Rome, when he donned the Roman [[tunic]], [[chlamys]], and shoes; the first time at the request of Pope Adrian, the second to gratify Leo, Adrian's successor.&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

He could rise to the occasion when necessary. On great feast days, he wore embroidery and jewels on his clothing and shoes. He had a golden buckle for his cloak on such occasions and would appear with his great [[Diadem (personal wear)|diadem]], but he despised such apparel, according to Einhard, and usually dressed like the common people.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Rise to power==
===Early life===
Charlemagne was the eldest child of [[Pepin the Short]] (714 – 24 September 768, reigned from 751) and his wife [[Bertrada of Laon]] (720 – 12 July 783), daughter of [[Caribert of Laon]] and [[Bertrada of Cologne]]. Records name only [[Carloman I, King of the Franks|Carloman]], [[Gisela (daughter of Pepin the Short)|Gisela]], and a short-lived child named Pippin as his younger siblings. The semi-mythical [[Redburga]], wife of King [[Egbert of Wessex]], is sometimes claimed to be his sister (or sister-in-law or niece), and the legendary material makes him [[Roland]]'s maternal uncle through a lady Bertha.

Much of what is known of Charlemagne's life comes from his biographer, [[Einhard]], who wrote a ''Vita Caroli Magni'' (or ''Vita Karoli Magni''), the ''Life of Charlemagne''. Einhard says of the early life of Charles:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It would be folly, I think, to write a word concerning Charles' birth and infancy, or even his boyhood, for nothing has ever been written on the subject, and there is no one alive now who can give information on it. Accordingly, I determined to pass that by as unknown, and to proceed at once to treat of his character, his deeds, and such other facts of his life as are worth telling and setting forth, and shall first give an account of his deeds at home and abroad, then of his character and pursuits, and lastly of his administration and death, omitting nothing worth knowing or necessary to know.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the death of Pepin, the kingdom of the Franks was divided—following tradition—between Charlemagne and Carloman. Charles took the outer parts of the kingdom, bordering on the sea, namely [[Neustria]], western [[Aquitaine]], and the northern parts of [[Austrasia]], while Carloman retained the inner parts: southern Austrasia, [[Septimania]], eastern Aquitaine, [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], [[Provence]], and [[Swabia]], lands bordering on [[Italy]].

===Joint rule===
On 9 October, immediately after the funeral of their father, both the kings withdrew from [[Saint Denis]] to be proclaimed by their nobles and consecrated by the bishops, Charlemagne in [[Noyon]] and Carloman in [[Soissons]].

The first event of the brothers' reign was the uprising of the Aquitainians and [[Gascony|Gascon]]s, in 769, in that territory split between the two kings. Years before, Pippin had suppressed the revolt of [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]]. Now, one Hunold (seemingly other than [[Hunald of Aquitaine|Hunald]] the duke) led the Aquitainians as far north as [[Angoulême]]. Charlemagne met Carloman, but Carloman refused to participate and returned to Burgundy. Charlemagne went to war, leading an army to [[Bordeaux]], where he set up a fort at Fronsac. Hunold was forced to flee to the court of Duke [[Lop II of Gascony|Lupus II of Gascony]]. Lupus, fearing Charlemagne, turned Hunold over in exchange for peace.  He was put in a monastery. Aquitaine was finally fully subdued by the Franks.

The brothers maintained lukewarm relations with the assistance of their mother Bertrada, but in 770 Charlemagne signed a treaty with Duke [[Tassilo III of Bavaria]] and married a Lombard Princess (commonly known today as [[Desiderata, wife of Charlemagne|Desiderata]]), the daughter of King [[Desiderius]], to surround Carloman with his own allies. Though [[Pope Stephen III]] first opposed the marriage with the Lombard princess, he would soon have little to fear from a Frankish-Lombard alliance.

Less than a year after his marriage, Charlemagne repudiated Desiderata, and quickly remarried to a 13-year-old Swabian named [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]]. The repudiated Desiderata returned to her father's court at [[Pavia]]. The Lombard's wrath was now aroused and he would gladly have allied with Carloman to defeat Charles. But before war could break out, Carloman died on 5 December 771. Carloman's wife [[Gerberge, wife of Carloman|Gerberga]] fled to Desiderius' court with her sons for protection.

==Italian campaigns==
===Conquest of Lombardy===
[[File:Charlemagne and Pope Adrian I.jpg|thumb|left|The Frankish king Charlemagne was a devout Catholic who maintained a close relationship with the papacy throughout his life. In 772, when [[Pope Adrian I]] was threatened by invaders, the king rushed to Rome to provide assistance. Shown here, the pope asks Charlemagne for help at a meeting near Rome]]

At the succession of [[Pope Adrian I]] in 772, he demanded the return of certain cities in the former [[exarchate of Ravenna]] as in accordance with a promise of Desiderius' succession. Desiderius instead took over certain papal cities and invaded the [[Pentapolis]], heading for [[Rome]]. Adrian sent embassies to Charlemagne in autumn requesting he enforce the policies of his father, Pippin. Desiderius sent his own embassies denying the pope's charges. The embassies both met at [[Thionville]] and Charlemagne upheld the pope's side. Charlemagne promptly demanded what the pope had demanded and Desiderius promptly swore never to comply. Charlemagne and his uncle [[Bernhard, son of Charles Martel|Bernard]] crossed the Alps in 773 and chased the Lombards back to [[battle of Pavia (773)|Pavia, which they then besieged]]. Charlemagne temporarily left the siege to deal with [[Adelchis]], son of Desiderius, who was raising an army at [[Verona]]. The young prince was chased to the [[Adriatic]] littoral and he fled to [[Constantinople]] to plead for assistance from [[Constantine V]], who was waging war with [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]].

The siege lasted until the spring of 774, when Charlemagne visited the pope in Rome. There he confirmed his father's grants of land, with some later chronicles claiming—falsely—that he also expanded them, granting [[Tuscany]], [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], [[Venice]], and [[Corsica]]. The pope granted him the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]''. He then returned to Pavia, where the Lombards were on the verge of surrendering.

In return for their lives, the Lombards surrendered and opened the gates in early summer. Desiderius was sent to the [[abbey]] of [[Corbie]] and his son Adelchis died in Constantinople a patrician. Charles, unusually, had himself crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] and made the magnates of Lombardy do homage to him at Pavia. Only Duke [[Arechis II of Benevento]] refused to submit and proclaimed independence. Charlemagne was then master of Italy as king of the Lombards. He left Italy with a garrison in Pavia and a few Frankish counts in place that very year.

There was still instability, however, in Italy. In 776, Dukes [[Hrodgaud of Friuli]] and [[Hildeprand of Spoleto]] rebelled. Charlemagne rushed back from [[Saxony]] and defeated the duke of Friuli in battle. The duke was slain. The duke of Spoleto signed a treaty. Their co-conspirator, Arechis, was not subdued, and Adelchis, their candidate in [[Byzantium]], never left that city. Northern Italy was now faithfully his.

===Southern Italy===
In 787 Charlemagne directed his attention toward [[Benevento]], where Arechis was reigning independently. Charlemagne besieged [[Salerno]], and Arechis submitted to [[vassalage]]. However, with his death in 792, Benevento again proclaimed independence under his son [[Grimoald III of Benevento|Grimoald III]]. Grimoald was attacked by armies of Charles or his sons many times, but Charlemagne himself never returned to the [[Mezzogiorno]], and Grimoald never was forced to surrender to Frankish [[suzerainty]].

==Charles and his children==
During the first peace of any substantial length (780–782), Charles began to appoint his sons to positions of authority within the realm, in the tradition of the kings and mayors of the past. In 781, he made his two younger sons kings, having them crowned by the Pope. The elder of these two, [[Pippin of Italy|Carloman]], was made [[king of Italy]], taking the Iron Crown which his father had first worn in 774, and in the same ceremony was renamed &quot;Pippin.&quot; The younger of the two, [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], became [[king of Aquitaine]]. Charlemagne ordered Pippin and Louis to be raised in the customs of their kingdoms, and he gave their regents some control of their subkingdoms, but real power was always in his hands, though he intended his sons to inherit their realms some day. Nor did he tolerate insubordination in his sons: in 792, he banished his eldest, though illegitimate, son, [[Pippin the Hunchback]], to the monastery of Prüm, because the young man had joined a rebellion against him.

Charles was determined to have his children educated, including his daughters, as he himself was not. His children were taught all the arts, and his daughters were learned in the way of being a woman. His sons took archery, horsemanship, and other outdoor activities.

The sons fought many wars on behalf of their father when they came of age. [[Charles the Younger|Charles]] was mostly preoccupied with the Bretons, whose border he shared and who insurrected on at least two occasions and were easily put down, but he was also sent against the Saxons on multiple occasions. In 805 and 806, he was sent into the Böhmerwald (modern [[Bohemia]]) to deal with the Slavs living there ([[Czech people|Czechs]]). He subjected them to Frankish authority and devastated the valley of the Elbe, forcing a tribute on them. Pippin had to hold the [[Eurasian Avars|Avar]] and Beneventan borders but also fought the [[Slavs]] to his north. He was uniquely poised to fight the [[Byzantine Empire]] when finally that conflict arose after Charlemagne's imperial coronation and a [[Venetia (region)|Venetian]] rebellion. Finally, Louis was in charge of the [[Spanish March]] and also went to southern Italy to fight the duke of Benevento on at least one occasion. He took Barcelona in a great siege in the year 797 (see below).

Charlemagne's attitude toward his daughters has been the subject of much discussion. He kept them at home with him and refused to allow them to contract [[marriage#Marriage and religion|sacramental marriages]] – possibly to prevent the creation of [[cadet]] branches of the family to challenge the main line, as had been the case with [[Tassilo III of Bavaria|Tassilo of Bavaria]] – yet he tolerated their extramarital relationships, even rewarding their common-law husbands, and treasured the illegitimate grandchildren they produced for him. He also, apparently, refused to believe stories of their wild behavior. After his death the surviving daughters were banished from the court by their brother, the pious Louis, to take up residence in the convents they had been bequeathed by their father. At least one of them, Bertha, had a recognised relationship, if not a marriage, with [[Angilbert]], a member of Charlemagne's court circle.

===Roncesvalles campaign===
[[File:Rolandfealty.jpg|thumb|right|Roland pledges his [[fealty]] to Charlemagne in an illustration taken from a manuscript of a ''[[chanson de geste]]'']]

According to the Muslim historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], the Diet of Paderborn had received the representatives of the [[Muslim]] rulers of [[Zaragoza]], [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]], and [[Huesca]]. Their masters had been cornered in the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] peninsula by [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], the [[Umayyad]] [[emir of Córdoba]]. These [[Moorish]] or &quot;Saracen&quot; rulers offered their homage to the great king of the Franks in return for military support. Seeing an opportunity to extend [[Christendom]] and his own power and believing the Saxons to be a fully conquered nation, Charlemagne agreed to go to [[Spain]].

In 778, he led the Neustrian army across the Western [[Pyrenees]], while the Austrasians, Lombards, and Burgundians passed over the Eastern Pyrenees. The armies met at Zaragoza and Charlemagne received the homage of the Muslim rulers, Sulayman al-Arabi and Kasmin ibn Yusuf, but the city did not fall for him. Indeed, Charlemagne was facing the toughest battle of his career where the Muslims had the upper hand and forced him to retreat. He decided to go home, since he could not trust the [[Basques]], whom he had subdued by conquering [[Pamplona]]. He turned to leave Iberia, but as he was passing through the Pass of [[Roncesvalles]] one of the most famous events of his long reign occurred. The Basques fell on his rearguard and baggage train, utterly destroying it. The [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]], less a battle than a mere skirmish, left many famous dead: among which were the [[seneschal]] Eggihard, the count of the palace Anselm, and the [[wikt:warden|warden]] of the [[Breton March]], [[Roland]], inspiring the subsequent creation of the [[Song of Roland]] (''La Chanson de Roland'').

===Wars with the Moors===
[[File:Harun-Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|left|[[Harun al-Rashid]] receiving a delegation of Charlemagne in [[Baghdad]], by [[Julius Köckert]].]]
The conquest of Italy brought Charlemagne in contact with the [[Saracen]]s who, at the time, controlled the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Pippin, his son, was much occupied with Saracens in Italy. Charlemagne conquered [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] at an unknown date and in 799 the [[Balearic Islands]]. The islands were often attacked by Saracen pirates, but the counts of [[Genoa]] and Tuscany ([[Boniface I of Tuscany|Boniface]]) kept them at bay with large fleets until the end of Charlemagne's reign. Charlemagne even had contact with the [[caliph]]al court in [[Baghdad]]. In 797 (or possibly 801), the caliph of Baghdad, [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented Charlemagne with an [[Asian elephant]] named [[Abul-Abbas]] and a [[clock]].&lt;ref&gt;Gene W. Heck ''When worlds collide: exploring the ideological and political foundations of the clash of civilizations'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2007 ISBN 0-7425-5856-8, p. 172 [http://books.google.com/books?id=dtAyMXqaozwC&amp;pg=PA172 Google Books Search]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hispania]], the struggle against the Moors continued unabated throughout the latter half of his reign. His son Louis was in charge of the Spanish border. In 785, his men captured Gerona permanently and extended Frankish control into the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] littoral for the duration of Charlemagne's reign (and much longer, it remained nominally Frankish until the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]] in 1258). The Muslim chiefs in the northeast of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] were constantly revolting against Córdoban authority, and they often turned to the Franks for help. The Frankish border was slowly extended until 795, when Gerona, [[Cardona]], [[Osona|Ausona]], and [[Urgel]] were united into the new [[Spanish March]], within the old duchy of [[Septimania]].

In 797 [[Barcelona]], the greatest city of the region, fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against Córdoba and, failing, handed it to them. The [[Umayyad]] authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis of Aquitaine marched the entire army of his kingdom over the [[Pyrenees]] and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated. The Franks continued to press forward against the [[emir]]. They took [[Tarragona]] in 809 and [[Tortosa]] in 811. The last conquest brought them to the mouth of the [[Ebro]] and gave them raiding access to [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], prompting the Emir [[al-Hakam I]] to recognize their conquests in 812.

==Eastern campaigns==
===Saxon Wars===
{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}
[[File:Frankish Empire 481 to 814-en.svg|thumb|left|300px|Map showing Charlemagne's additions (in light green) to the Frankish Kingdom.]]
Charlemagne was engaged in almost constant battle throughout his reign, often at the head of his elite ''[[scara]]'' bodyguard squadrons, with his legendary sword [[Joyeuse]] in hand. After thirty years of war and eighteen battles—the [[Saxon Wars]]—he conquered [[Old Saxony|Saxonia]] and proceeded to convert the conquered to Christianity.

The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Saxons]] were divided into four subgroups in four regions. Nearest to Austrasia was [[Westphalia]] and furthest away was [[Eastphalia]]. In between these two kingdoms was that of [[Engria]] and north of these three, at the base of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, was [[Nordalbingia]].

In his first campaign, Charlemagne forced the Engrians in 773 to submit and cut down an [[Irminsul]] pillar near [[Paderborn]]. The campaign was cut short by his first expedition to Italy. He returned in 775, marching through Westphalia and conquered the Saxon [[Fort of Hohensyburg|fort of Sigiburg]]. He then crossed Engria, where he defeated the Saxons again. Finally, in Eastphalia, he defeated a Saxon force, and its leader [[Hessi]] converted to [[Christianity]]. He returned through Westphalia, leaving encampments at Sigiburg and [[Eresburg]], which had, up until then, been important Saxon bastions. All of Saxony but Nordalbingia was under his control, but Saxon resistance had not ended.

Following his campaign in Italy subjugating the dukes of Friuli and Spoleto, Charlemagne returned very rapidly to Saxony in 776, where a rebellion had destroyed his fortress at Eresburg. The Saxons were once again brought to heel, but their main leader, [[Widukind]], managed to escape to Denmark, home of his wife. Charlemagne built a new camp at [[Karlstadt am Main|Karlstadt]]. In 777, he called a national diet at Paderborn to integrate Saxony fully into the Frankish kingdom. Many Saxons were baptised as Christians.

In the summer of 779, he again invaded Saxony and reconquered Eastphalia, Engria, and Westphalia. At a diet near [[Lippe]], he divided the land into missionary districts and himself assisted in several mass baptisms (780). He then returned to Italy and, for the first time, there was no immediate Saxon revolt. Saxony was peaceful from 780 to 782.

[[File:Charlemagne 742 814 receiving the submission of Witikind at Paderborn in 785 Ary Schefferr 1795 1858.jpg|thumb|Charlemagne (742–814) receiving the submission of [[Witikind]] at [[Paderborn]] in 785, by [[Ary Scheffer]] (1795–1858). [[Versailles]].]]
He returned to Saxony in 782 and instituted a code of law and appointed counts, both Saxon and Frank. The laws were [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] on religious issues; for example, the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'' prescribed death to Saxon pagans who refused to convert to Christianity. This revived a renewal of the old conflict. That year, in autumn, Widukind returned and led a new revolt. In response, at [[Verden, Germany|Verden]] in [[Lower Saxony]], Charlemagne is recorded as having ordered the execution of 4,500 Saxon prisoners, known as the [[Massacre of Verden]] (&quot;Verdener Blutgericht&quot;). The killings triggered three years of renewed bloody warfare (783–785). During this war the [[Frisians]] were also finally subdued and a large part of their fleet was burned. The war ended with [[Widukind]] accepting baptism.

Thereafter, the Saxons maintained the peace for seven years, but in 792 the Westphalians again rose against their conquerors. The Eastphalians and Nordalbingians joined them in 793, but the insurrection did not catch on and was put down by 794. An Engrian rebellion followed in 796, but the presence of Charlemagne, Christian Saxons and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] quickly crushed it. The last insurrection of the independent-minded people occurred in 804, more than thirty years after Charlemagne's first campaign against them. This time, the most restive of them, the Nordalbingians, found themselves effectively disempowered from rebellion for the time being. According to Einhard:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The war that had lasted so many years was at length ended by their acceding to the terms offered by the King; which were renunciation of their national religious customs and the worship of devils, acceptance of the sacraments of the Christian faith and religion, and union with the Franks to form one people.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Submission of Bavaria===
In 788, Charlemagne turned his attention to [[Bavaria]].  He claimed Tassilo was an unfit ruler, due to his oath-breaking.  The charges were exaggerated, but Tassilo was deposed anyway and put in the monastery of [[Jumièges]].  In 794, he was made to renounce any claim to Bavaria for himself and his family (the [[Agilolfings]]) at the [[synod]] of [[Frankfurt]].  Bavaria was subdivided into Frankish counties, as had been done with Saxony.

===Avars campaigns===
In 788, the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]], a pagan Asian horde which had settled down in what is today [[Hungary]] (Einhard called them [[Huns]]), invaded Friuli and Bavaria. Charlemagne was preoccupied until 790 with other things, but in that year, he marched down the [[Danube]] into their territory and ravaged it to the [[Raab]]. Then, a Lombard army under Pippin marched into the [[Drava]] valley and ravaged [[Pannonia]]. The campaigns would have continued if the Saxons had not revolted again in 792, breaking seven years of peace.

For the next two years, Charlemagne was occupied with the Slavs against the Saxons. Pippin and Duke [[Eric of Friuli]] continued, however, to assault the Avars' ring-shaped strongholds. The great Ring of the Avars, their capital fortress, was taken twice. The booty was sent to Charlemagne at his capital, [[Aachen]], and redistributed to all his followers and even to foreign rulers, including King [[Offa of Mercia]]. Soon the Avar [[tudun]]s had thrown in the towel and travelled to Aachen to subject themselves to Charlemagne as vassals and Christians. Charlemagne accepted their surrender and sent one native chief, baptised Abraham, back to Avaria with the ancient title of [[khagan]]. Abraham kept his people in line, but in 800, the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] under [[Krum|Khan Krum]] swept the Avar state away. In the 10th century, the [[Magyars]] settled the Pannonian plain and presented a new threat to Charlemagne's descendants.

===Northeast Slav expeditions===
In 789, in recognition of his new pagan neighbours, the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], Charlemagne marched an Austrasian-Saxon army across the [[Elbe]] into [[Obotrite]] territory. The Slavs immediately submitted under their leader Witzin. Charlemagne then accepted the surrender of the [[Wiltzes]] under Dragovit and demanded many hostages and the permission to send, unmolested, missionaries into the pagan region. The army marched to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] before turning around and marching to the Rhine with much booty and no harassment. The tributary Slavs became loyal allies. In 795, when the Saxons broke the peace, the Abotrites and Wiltzes rose in arms with their new master against the Saxons. Witzin died in battle and Charlemagne avenged him by harrying the Eastphalians on the Elbe. Thrasuco, his successor, led his men to conquest over the Nordalbingians and handed their leaders over to Charlemagne, who greatly honoured him. The Abotrites remained loyal until Charles' death and fought later against the Danes.

===Southeast Slav expeditions===
When Charlemagne incorporated much of Central Europe, he brought the Frankish state face to face with the Avars and Slavs in the southeast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce Ross&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Bruce Ross | first=James | pages=212–235 | url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/2854596 | title=Two Neglected Paladins of Charlemagne: Erich of Friuli and Gerold of Bavaria Speculum, Vol. 20, No. 2 | publisher=Medieval Academy of America | location= | year=Apr., 1945 | language= | isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most southeast Frankish neighbors were [[Croats]], who settled in [[Pannonian Croatia]] and [[Littoral Croatian Duchy]].

Charlemagne also directed his attention to the [[South Slavs|Slavs]] to the west of the Avar khaganate: the [[Carantania]]ns and [[Carniola]]ns. These people were subdued by the Lombards and Bavarii, were made tributaries, but were never fully incorporated into the Frankish state.

[[File:Aachen-cathedral-inside.jpg|thumb|[[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|Charlemagne's chapel]] at [[Aachen Cathedral]].]]
In 799, [[Pope Leo III]] had been mistreated by the Romans, who tried to put out his eyes and tear out his tongue. Leo escaped and fled to Charlemagne at Paderborn, asking him to intervene in Rome and restore him. Charlemagne, advised by [[Alcuin of York]], agreed to travel to Rome, doing so in November 800 and holding a council on December 1. On 23 December Leo swore an oath of innocence. At [[Mass]], on Christmas Day (25 December), when Charlemagne knelt at the altar to pray, the Pope [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] him ''Imperator Romanorum'' (&quot;Emperor of the Romans&quot;) in [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]]. In so doing, the Pope was effectively attempting to transfer the office from [[Constantinople]] to Charles. Einhard says that Charlemagne was ignorant of the Pope's intent and did not want any such coronation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[H]e at first had such an aversion that he declared that he would not have set foot in the Church the day that they [the imperial titles] were conferred, although it was a great feast-day, if he could have foreseen the design of the Pope.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many modern scholars&lt;ref&gt;Tierney, Brian. ''The Crisis of the Church and State 1050–1300''. University of Toronto Press, 1964. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that Charlemagne was indeed aware of the coronation; certainly he cannot have missed the bejeweled crown waiting on the altar when he came to pray. In any event, he used these circumstances to claim that he was the renewer of the Roman Empire, which had apparently fallen into degradation under the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]. In his official charters, Charles preferred the style ''Karolus serenissimus Augustus a Deo coronatus magnus pacificus imperator Romanum gubernans imperium''&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', Diplomata Karolinorum I, 77ff.; title used from 801 onward.&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;Charles, most serene Augustus crowned by God, the great, peaceful emperor ruling the Roman empire&quot;) to a more direct ''Imperator Romanorum'' (&quot;Emperor of the Romans&quot;).

The [[iconoclasm (Byzantine)|Iconoclasm]] of the [[Leo III the Isaurian|Isaurian Dynasty]] and resulting religious conflicts with the Empress [[Byzantine Empress Irene|Irene]], sitting on the throne in Constantinople in 800, were probably the chief causes of the Pope's desire to formally acclaim Charles as Roman Emperor. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010|reason: Conflict between Irene and the Pope were not sparked by Iconoclasm, as Irene was an Iconodule. Some evidence should also be provided to support the implication that Leo intended to acclaim Charles as a check against the Eastern Emperors.}} He also most certainly desired to increase the influence of the papacy, honour his saviour Charlemagne, and solve the constitutional issues then most troubling to European jurists in an era when Rome was not in the hands of an emperor. Thus, Charlemagne's assumption of the imperial title was not an usurpation in the eyes of the Franks or Italians. It was, however, in Byzantium, where it was protested by Irene and her successor [[Nicephorus I]]—neither of whom had any great effect in enforcing their protests.

The Byzantines, however, still held several territories in Italy: Venice (what was left of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]), [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] (in [[Calabria]]), [[Brindisi]] (in [[Apulia]]), and [[Naples]] (the ''[[Ducatus Neapolitanus]]''). These regions remained outside of Frankish hands until 804, when the Venetians, torn by infighting, transferred their allegiance to the Iron Crown of Pippin, Charles' son. The ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'' ended. Nicephorus ravaged the coasts with a fleet, and the only instance of war between the Byzantines and the Franks, as it was, began. It lasted until 810, when the pro-Byzantine party in Venice gave their city back to the Byzantine Emperor, and the two emperors of Europe made peace: Charlemagne received the [[Istria]]n peninsula and in 812 the emperor [[Michael I Rhangabes]] recognised his status as Emperor,&lt;ref&gt;''eum imperatorem et basileum appellantes'', cf. ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'', a. 812.&lt;/ref&gt; although not necessarily as &quot;Emperor of the Romans&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;E. Eichmann, ''Die Kaiserkrönung im Abendland'' I (Würzburg: 1942), 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Danish attacks===
After the conquest of Nordalbingia, the Frankish frontier was brought into contact with Scandinavia. The [[Norse paganism|pagan]] Danes, &quot;a race almost unknown to his ancestors, but destined to be only too well known to his sons&quot; as [[Charles Oman]] described them, inhabiting the [[Jutland]] peninsula, had heard many stories from Widukind and his allies who had taken refuge with them about the dangers of the Franks and the fury which their Christian king could direct against pagan neighbours.

In 808, the king of the Danes, [[Gudfred|Godfred]], built the vast [[Danevirke]] across the isthmus of [[Schleswig]]. This defence, last employed in the Danish-Prussian War of 1864, was at its beginning a {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} long earthenwork rampart. The Danevirke protected Danish land and gave Godfred the opportunity to harass [[Frisia]] and [[Flanders]] with pirate raids. He also subdued the Frank-allied Wiltzes and fought the Abotrites.

Godfred invaded Frisia, joked of visiting Aachen, but was murdered before he could do any more, either by a Frankish assassin or by one of his own men. Godfred was succeeded by his nephew [[King Hemming|Hemming]], who concluded the [[Treaty of Heiligen]] with Charlemagne in late 811.

===Death===

In 813, Charlemagne called [[Louis the Pious]], king of [[Aquitaine]], his only surviving legitimate son, to his court. There Charlemagne crowned his son with his own hands as co-emperor and sent him back to Aquitaine. He then spent the autumn hunting before returning to Aachen on 1 November. In January, he fell ill with [[pleurisy]].&lt;ref&gt;Einhard, ''Life'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; In deep depression (mostly because many of his plans were not yet realized), he took to his bed on 21 January and as [[Einhard]] tells it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He died January twenty-eighth, the seventh day from the time that he took to his bed, at nine o'clock in the morning, after partaking of the [[Holy Communion]], in the seventy-second year of his age and the forty-seventh of his reign.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Sarg Karl.jpg|thumb|[[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II's]] gold and silver casket for Charlemagne]]
He was buried the same day as his death, in [[Aachen Cathedral]], although the cold weather and the nature of his illness made such a hurried burial unnecessary. The earliest surviving ''[[planctus]]'', the ''[[Planctus de obitu Karoli]]'', was composed by a monk of [[Bobbio Abbey|Bobbio]], which he had patronised.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Godman (1985), ''Latin Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press), 206–211.&lt;/ref&gt; A later story, told by Otho of Lomello, Count of the Palace at Aachen in the time of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]], would claim that he and Emperor Otto had discovered Charlemagne's tomb: the emperor, they claimed, was seated upon a throne, wearing a crown and holding a sceptre, his flesh almost entirely incorrupt. In 1165, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]] re-opened the tomb again and placed the emperor in a sarcophagus beneath the floor of the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin, Russell, ''The Emperor Charlemagne'', pp. 222–224&lt;/ref&gt; In 1215 [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] re-interred him in a casket made of gold and silver.

Charlemagne's death greatly affected many of his subjects, particularly those of the literary clique who had surrounded him at [[Aachen]]. An anonymous monk of Bobbio lamented:
&lt;sup&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;From the lands where the sun rises to western shores, People are crying and wailing...the Franks, the Romans, all Christians, are stung with mourning and great worry...the young and old, glorious nobles, all lament the loss of their Caesar...the world laments the death of Charles...O Christ, you who govern the heavenly host, grant a peaceful place to Charles in your kingdom. Alas for miserable me.&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, PE, ''Carolingian Civilization: A Reader''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

He was succeeded by his surviving son, Louis, who had been crowned the previous year. His empire lasted only another generation in its entirety; its division, according to custom, between Louis's own sons after their father's death laid the foundation for the modern states of Germany and France.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Administration==
As an administrator, Charlemagne stands out for his many reforms: [[monetary]], governmental, military, cultural, and [[ecclesiastic]]al. He is the main protagonist of the &quot;Carolingian Renaissance.&quot;

===Military===
It has long been held that the dominance of Charlemagne's military was based on a &quot;[[heavy cavalry|cavalry]] revolution&quot; led by [[Charles Martel]] in 730s. However, the [[stirrup]], which made the &quot;shock cavalry&quot; [[lance]] charge possible, was not introduced to the Frankish kingdom until the late eighth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;Hooper, Nicholas / Bennett, Matthew. [http://books.google.com/books?id=Sf8UIynR0koC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=cavalry+made+the+carolingian+expansion+possible&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=cavalry%20made%20the%20carolingian%20expansion%20possible&amp;f=false ''The Cambridge illustrated atlas of warfare: the Middle Ages''] Cambridge University Press, 1996, Pg. 12–13 ISBN 0-521-44049-1, 9780521440493&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Charlemagne's success rested primarily on novel [[siege]] technologies and excellent logistics.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlus, Charles R. [http://books.google.com/books?id=0XBtVwukIogC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=charlemagne+heavy+cavalry+revolution&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=charlemagne%20heavy%20cavalry%20revolution&amp;f=false ''The battle of Lechfeld and its aftermath, August 955: the end of the age of migrations in the Latin West''] Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006, Pg. 49 ISBN 0-7546-5470-2, 9780754654704&lt;/ref&gt; However, large numbers of horses were used by the Frankish military during the age of Charlemagne. This was because horses provided a quick, long-distance method of [[mounted infantry|transporting troops]], which was critical to building and maintaining such a large empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;

===Economic and monetary reforms===
[[File:Karldergrossesignatur.jpg|left|thumb|[[Monogram]] of Charlemagne, from the subscription of a royal diploma: &quot;{{lang|la|Signum (monogr.: KAROLVS) Karoli gloriosissimi regis}}&quot;]]

Charlemagne had an important role in determining the immediate economic future of Europe. Pursuing his father's reforms, Charlemagne abolished the monetary system based on the gold {{lang|fr|''[[solidus (coin)|sou]]''}}, and he and the [[Anglo-Saxon monarchs|Anglo-Saxon King]] [[Offa of Mercia]] took up the system set in place by Pippin. There were strong pragmatic reasons for this abandonment of a gold standard, notably a shortage of gold itself, which was a direct consequence of the conclusion of peace with Byzantium, which resulted in the ceding of Venice and Sicily and the loss of their trade routes to Africa and to the East. This standardisation also had the effect of economically harmonising and unifying the complex array of currencies which had been in use at the commencement of his reign, thus simplifying trade and commerce.

[[File:Charlemagne denier Tours 793 to 812.jpg|left|thumb|Charlemagne, denier, [[Tours]], 793–812.]]
He established a new standard, the {{lang|fr|''[[French livre|livre carolinienne]]''}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|''libra'']]}}, the modern [[pound (currency)|pound]]), which was based upon a pound of [[silver]]—a unit of both money and weight—which was worth 20 sous (from the Latin {{lang|la|''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]''}} [which was primarily an accounting device and never actually minted], the modern [[shilling]]) or 240 {{lang|fr|''[[denier (coin)|deniers]]''}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|''[[denarius]]''}}, the modern [[penny]]). During this period, the {{lang|fr|''livre''}} and the {{lang|fr|''sou''}} were counting units; only the {{lang|fr|''denier''}} was a coin of the realm.

Charlemagne instituted principles for [[accountancy|accounting practice]] by means of the [[Capitulare de villis vel curtis imperii|Capitulare de villis]] of 802, which laid down strict rules for the way in which incomes and expenses were to be recorded.

The lending of money for interest was prohibited and then strengthened in 814, when Charlemagne intro
