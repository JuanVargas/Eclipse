'''Alfonso the Magnanimous''' (also '''Alphonso'''; {{lang-ca|'''Alfons'''}}; 1396 &amp;ndash; 27 June 1458) was the [[King of Aragon]] (as '''Alfonso V'''), [[King of Valencia|Valencia]] (as '''Alfonso III'''), [[Kingdom of Majorca|Majorca]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia and Corsica]] (as '''Alfonso II'''), and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Count of Barcelona]] (as '''Alfonso IV''') from 1416 and [[King of Naples]] (as '''Alfonso I''') from 1442 until his death. He was one of the most prominent figures of the early [[Renaissance]] and a knight of the [[Order of the Dragon]].

==Biography==
Born at [[Medina del Campo]], he was the son of [[Ferdinand I of Aragon]] (known as Ferdinand of Antequera) and [[Eleanor of Alburquerque]]. He represented the old line of the counts of [[Barcelona]] only through women, and was on his father's side descended from the [[House of Trastamara]], a noble family of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]]. By hereditary right he was king of [[Sicily]] and disputed the island of [[Sardinia]] with [[Genoa]]. Alfonso was also in possession of much of [[Corsica]] by the 1420s.

In 1421 Queen [[Joan II of Naples]], who had no children, adopted and named him as heir to the [[Kingdom of Naples]], and Alfonso went to [[Naples]]. Here he hired the famous [[condottiero]] [[Braccio da Montone]] with the task of reducing the resistance of the other pretender, [[Louis III of Anjou]], and his forces led by [[Muzio Attendolo]] [[Sforza]]. As Pope [[Martin V]] supported Sforza, Alfonso switched religious allegiance to the Aragonese [[antipope Benedict XIII]]. When Sforza also abandoned Louis, Alfonso seemed to have all his problems solved; however, his relationship with Joanna suddenly worsened, and in May 1423 he had her lover, and a powerful figure in the Neapolitan court, [[Gianni Caracciolo]], arrested.

After an attempt to arrest the queen herself failed, Joanna called Sforza who defeated the Aragonese milices near [[Castel Capuano]] in Naples. Alfonso fled to Castel Nuovo, but the help of a fleet of 22 galleys led by [[Giovanni da Cardona]] improved his situation. Sforza and Joanna ransomed Caracciolo and retreated to the fortress of [[Aversa]]. Here she repudiated her earlier adoption of Alfonso and, with support from Martin V, named Louis III as her heir instead.

The Milanese [[Filippo Maria Visconti]] joined the anti-Aragonese coalition. Alfonso requested support from Braccio da Montone, who was besieging Joanna's troops in [[L'Aquila]], but had to set sail for Spain, where a war had broken out between his brothers and the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. On his way towards Barcelona, he destroyed [[Marseille]], a possession of Louis III.

[[File:King-alfonsoVaragon2.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Manuscript detail of Alfonso V of Aragon.]]

In the late 1423 the Genoese fleet of Visconti moved in the southern [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] and easily conquered [[Gaeta]], [[Procida]], [[Castellammare di Stabia|Castellammare]] and [[Sorrento]]. Naples, which was held by Alfonso's brother, Pedro de Aragon , was besieged in 1424 by the Genoese ships and Joanna's troops, now led by [[Francesco Sforza]], son of Muzio (who had died at L'Aquila). The city fell in the April of that year. Pedro, after a short resistance in Castel Nuovo, fled to [[Sicily]] in August. Joanna II and Louis III again took possession of the realm, although the true power was in the hands of [[Gianni Caracciolo]].

An opportunity for Alfonso to reconquer Naples occurred in 1432, when Caracciolo was killed in a conjure. Alfonso tried to regain the favour of the queen, but failed, and had to wait for the death of both Louis (at Cosenza in 1434) and Joanna herself (February 1435). In her will, she bequeathed her realm to [[René I of Naples|René of Anjou]], Louis III's brother. This solution was opposed by the new pope, [[Eugene IV]], who was nominal feudal lord of the King of Naples. As the Neapolitans had called for the French, Alfonso decided to intervene and, with the support of several barons of the kingdom, captured [[Capua]] and besieged the important sea fortress of Gaeta. His fleet of 25 galleys was met by the Genoese ships sent by Visconti, led by [[Biagio Assereto]]. In the [[Battle of Ponza (1435)|battle]] that ensued, Alfonso was defeated and taken prisoner.

In Milan, however, he impressed his captor with his cultured demeanor and persuaded him to let him go by making it plain that it was not in Milan's interest to prevent the victory of the Aragonese party in Naples. Helped by a Sicilian fleet, Alfonso recaptured Capua and set his base in Gaeta in the February of 1436. Papal troops had invaded the Neapolitan kingdom, but Alfonso corrupted the cardinal [[Giovanni Vitelleschi]], who commanded them, and his successes waned.

In the meantime, René had managed to reach Naples on 19 May 1438. Alfonso tried to besiege the city in the following September, but failed. His brother Pedro was killed during the battle. Castel Nuovo, where an Aragonese garrison resisted, fell to the Angevine mercenaries in the August of 1439. After the death of his condottiero [[Jacopo Caldora]], however, René's fortune started to wane: Alfonso could easily capture [[Aversa]], [[Salerno]], [[Benevento]], [[Manfredonia]] and [[Bitonto]]. René, whose possession included now only part of the [[Abruzzi]] and Naples, obtained 10,000 men from the pope, but the cardinal leading them signed a truce with Alfonso. Giovanni Sforza came with a reduced corps, as troops sent by Eugene IV had halted his father Francesco in the [[Marche]].

Alfonso, who was provided with the most impressive artillery of the time, again besieged Naples. The siege began on 10 November 1441, and ended on 2 June of the following year.  After the return of René to Provence, Alfonso easily reduced the remaining resistance and made his triumphal entrance in Naples on 26 February 1443, as the monarch of a pacified kingdom. In 1446 he conquered also Sardinia.

[[File:Medalla de Alfonso V de Aragón (Pisanello, M.A.N. Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Alfonso V's silver medal (1449), by [[Pisanello]].]]

Alfonso, by formally submitting his reign to the Papacy, obtained the consent of Pope [[Eugene IV]] that the Kingdom of Naples would go to his immature son [[Ferdinand I of Naples|Ferdinand]]. He died in [[Castel dell'Ovo]] in 1458, while he was planning the conquest of [[Genoa]]. At the time, Alfonso was at odds with [[Pope Callixtus III|Callixtus III]], who died shortly thereafter.

His Spanish possessions were ruled for him by his brother John, later king [[John II of Aragon]].  Sicily and [[Sardinia]] were inherited by his brother John, who survived him.

He was also a powerful and consistent supporter of [[Scanderbeg]], whom he decided to take under his protection as a vassal in 1451, shortly after the latter had scored his second victory against [[Murad II]]. In addition to financial assistance, he supplied the [[Albania]]n leader with troops, military equipment, and sanctuary for himself and his family if such a need should arise.  This was because in 1448, while Scanderbeg was victoriously fighting off the Turkish invasions, three military columns, commanded by [[Demetrio Reres]] along with his sons Giorgio and Basilio, were dispatched to help Alfonso V defeat the barons of Naples who had rebelled against him.

==Family==

Alfonso had been betrothed to [[Maria of Castile]] (1401&amp;ndash;1458; sister of [[John II of Castile]]) in [[Valladolid]] in 1408; the marriage was celebrated in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] on 12 June 1415. They failed to produce children.  Alfonso had been in love with a woman of noble family named [[Lucrezia d'Alagno]], who served as a ''de facto'' queen at the Neapolitan court as well as an inspiring [[muse]].

Genealogical trackings indicate however that the royal talamus of Aragon  stranged king Alfonso V was occupied many times by [[Giraldona Carlino]], the mother of :

* his successor in Naples, bastard born king [[Ferdinand I of Naples]], (1423 - king 1458 - 1494).
* [[Maria d'Aragona]] (died 1449, aged around 15 or 16). She had married in 1444 [[Leonello d' Este, margrave of Ferrara]], deceased 1450.
* Leonora d'Aragona, who married circa 1443, Mariano Marzano, Duke of Squillace, Prince of Rossano.

==Art and administration==
Like a true prince of the Renaissance he favoured men of letters whom he trusted to preserve his reputation to posterity.  He founded the Academy of [[Naples]] under [[Giovanni Pontano]] and, for his entrance in the city in 1443, had a magnificent triumphal arch added to the main gate of [[Castel Nuovo]]. This edifice, considered the most important civil piece of art of the time, was designed by [[Francesco Laurana]]. His devotion to the [[classics]] was exceptional even for the time.

For example, Alfonso halted his army in pious respect before the birthplace of a Latin writer, carried [[Livy]] or [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] on his campaigns with him, and his panegyrist [[Panormita]] even stated that the king was cured of an illness when a few pages of [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]]' history of [[Alexander the Great]] were read to him.  However, the classics had not refined his taste, for he was amused by setting itinerant scholars, who swarmed to his court, to abuse one another in the indescribably filthy Latin scolding matches which were then the fashion.
[[File:NapoliMaschioAngioinoIngresso.jpg|thumb|left|Castel Nuovo - triumphal arch entrance.]]

After his conquest of Naples in 1442, Alfonso ruled by his mercenary soldiers and mercenary men of letters. In his Italian kingdom, he maintained the former political and administrative institutions.

A unified General Chancellorship for the whole Aragonese reign was set in [[Naples]], although the main functionaries were of Aragonese nationality. Apart from financial, administrative and artistical improvements, his other accomplishments in the Sicilian kingdom include the restoration of the aqueducts, the drainage of marshy areas, and the pavement of streets.

==Connection with Ethiopia==
Alfonso was the object of diplomatic contacts from the empire of [[Ethiopia]]. In 1428, he received a letter from [[Yeshaq I of Ethiopia]], borne by two dignitaries, which proposed an alliance against the [[Muslim]]s and would be sealed by a dual marriage that would require the Infante Don Pedro to bring a group of artisans to Ethiopia where he would marry Yeshaq's daughter.

In return, Alfonso sent a party of 13 craftsmen, all of whom perished on the way to Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Girma Beshah and Merid Wolde Aregay, ''The Question of the Union of the Churches in Luso-Ethiopian Relations (1500-1632)'' (Lisbon:Junta de Investigações do Ultramar and Centro de Estudos Históricos Ultramarinos, 1964), pp.13-4.&lt;/ref&gt; He later sent a letter to Yeshaq's successor [[Zara Yaqob]] in 1450, in which he wrote that he would be happy to send artisans to Ethiopia if their safe arrival could be guaranteed, but it probably never reached the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Girma Beshah and Merid Wolde Aregay, ''The Question of the Union of the Churches'', pp.14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[O. G. S. Crawford]] (editor), ''Ethiopian Itineraries, circa 1400 - 1524'' (Cambridge: the Hakluyt Society, 1958), pp. 12f.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amathus''' (Greek ''Αμαθούς'') was one of the most ancient royal cities of [[Cyprus]], on the southern coast in front of [[Agios Tychonas]], about 24 miles west of [[Larnaca]] and 6 miles east of [[Limassol]]. Its ancient cult of [[Aphrodite]] was the most important, after [[Paphos]], in Cyprus, her homeland, though the ruins of Amathus are less well-preserved than neighboring [[Kourion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''Greek Religion'' 1985, p. 153; J.

==Pre-history and ancient era==
[[File:Ancient Amathus.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient Amathus outside [[Limassol]]]]
The pre-history of Amathus mixes myth and [[archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Petit, &quot;Eteocypriot myth and Amathousian reality,&quot; ''JMA'' '''12''' (1999:108-20&lt;/ref&gt; Though there was no Bronze Age city on the site, archaeology has detected human activity that is evident from the earliest [[Iron Age]], circa [[1100 BC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Amathus during the First Iron Age|journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|month=November | year=1997|first=Pierre|last=Aupert|coauthors=|volume=308|issue=|pages=19–25|id= |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1357406|format=|accessdate=2008-07-11|doi=10.2307/1357406 }}; M. Iacovou, &quot;Amathous, an early Iron Age polity in Cyprus: the chronology of its foundation&quot;, ''Report of the Department of Antiquities of Cyprus'' (2002) pp 101-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The city's legendary founder was [[Cinyras]], linked with the birth of [[Adonis]], who called the city after his mother Amathous. According to a version of the [[Ariadne]] legend noted by [[Plutarch]],&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[[Biography|vita]]'' of Theseus (20.3-.5), citing the lost text of an obscure Amathusan mythographer, [[Paeon of Amathus|Paeon]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theseus]] abandoned Ariadne at Amathousa, where she died giving birth to her child and was buried in a sacred tomb. According to Plutarch's source, Amathousians called the [[sacred grove]] where her shrine was situated the Wood of Aphrodite Ariadne. More purely Hellenic myth would have Amathus settled instead by one of the sons of [[Heracles]], thus accounting for the fact that he was worshiped there.
 
It was said in antiquity that the people of Amathus were [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthonous]], or &quot;[[Pelasgian]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;/&gt; Their non-Greek language is confirmed on the site by inscriptions in the [[Cypriot syllabary]] which alone in the Aegean world survived the [[Bronze Age collapse]] and continued to be used down to the 4th century BC.
 
Amathus was built on the coastal cliffs with a natural harbor and flourished at an early date, soon requiring several cemeteries. Greeks from [[Euboea]] left their pottery at Amathus from the tenth century BC. During the post-Phoenician era of the eighth century a [[palace]] was erected and a port was also constructed, which served the trade with the [[Greeks]] and the [[Levant]]ines. A special burial ground for infants, a ''[[tophet]]'' &lt;ref&gt; Agelarakis A., Kanta A., and N. Ch. Stampolidis, “The Osseous Record in the Western Necropolis of Amathous: an Archaeo-Anthropological Investigation”,  Eastern Mediterranean, Cyprus-Dodecanese-Crete 16th-6th c. B.C., Proceedings of the International Symposium: The Eastern Mediterranean, Cyprus-Dodecanese-Crete 16th-6th c. B.C., Rethymnon, Crete, 1998: 217-232 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Agelarakis A., “The Amathous (tophet) cremations in Cyprus”, In D. Christou on “Human Cremations at the Western Necropolis of Amathous”  &lt;Cremations in Bronze and Early Iron Age&gt;, Proceedings of Int. Symposium.  Ministries of the Aegean and of Culture,  Greece, 2001:  201-204 &lt;/ref&gt; served the culture of the [[Phoenicia]]ns. For the Hellenes, high on the cliff a temple was built, which became a worship site devoted to [[Aphrodite]], in her particular local presence as ''[[Amathusia|Aphrodite Amathusia]]'' along with a bearded male Aphrodite called ''[[Aphroditos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' III, 8. Hesychius ''s.v'' Ἀφρόδιτος. Catullus 68, 51, calling the Amathusian Aphrodite ''duplex'', confirms the attribution to Amathus.&lt;/ref&gt; The excavators discovered the final stage of the Temple of Aphrodite, also known as [[Aphrodisias]], which dates approximately to the first century BC. According to the legend, it was where festive [[Adonia]] took place, in which athletes competed in hunting wild boars during sport competitions; they also competed in dancing and singing, all to the honour of Adonis.

[[File:Apollo Amathus.jpg|thumb|portrait|left|Apollo Temple at Amathus-[[Limassol]]]]
The earliest remains hitherto found on the site are tombs of the early [[Iron Age]] period of Graeco-[[Phoenicia]]n influences ([[1000 BC|1000]]-[[600 BC|600 B.C.]]). Amathus is identified&lt;ref&gt;For example by E. Oberhummer, ''Die Insel Cypern'', i., 1902, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; with ''Kartihadasti'' (Phoenician &quot;New-Town&quot;) in the Cypriote tribute-list of [[Esarhaddon]] of [[Assyria]] (668 B.C.).&lt;ref&gt;But see [[Citium]].&lt;/ref&gt;  It certainly maintained strong [[Phoenicia]]n sympathies, for it was its refusal to join the philhellene league of [[Onesilus|Onesilos]] of [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]] which provoked the revolt of Cyprus from [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persia]] in [[500 BC|500]]-[[494BC]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], v. 105&lt;/ref&gt; when Amathus was besieged unsuccessfully and avenged itself by the capture and execution of Onesilos. Herodotus reports
:&quot;Because he had besieged them, the Amathusians cut off Onesilos’ head and brought it to Amathous, where they hung it above the gates. As it hung there empty, a swarm of bees entered it and filled it with honeycomb.&lt;ref&gt;The [[mytheme]] of bees in the carcase, familiar from the legend of [[Samson]] ( Judges 14:8, a lion's carcase) and the Greek myth of [[Aristaeus]] (a bullock carcase), and in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Georgics]]'', is examined by Othniel Margalith, &quot;Samson's Riddle and Samson's Magic Locks&quot; ''Vetus Testamentum'', '''36'''.2 (1986:.&lt;/ref&gt; When they sought advice about this event, an oracle told them to take the head down and bury it, and to make annual sacrifice to Onesilos as a hero, saying that it would be better for them if they did this. The Amathusians did as they were told and still perform these rites in my day.&quot; (''Histories'' 5.114)

About 385-380 BC the philhellene [[Evagoras]] of Salamis was similarly opposed by Amathus, in conjunction with [[Citium]] and [[Soli, Cyprus|Soli]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]] xiv. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; and even after [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] the city resisted annexation, and was bound over to give hostages to [[Seleucus]].&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xix. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Its political importance now ended, but its temple of [[Adonis]] and [[Amathusia|Aphrodite Amathusia]] remained famous in [[Roman Empire|Roman times]]. The epithet ''Amathusia'' in Roman poetry often means little more than &quot;Cypriote,&quot; attesting to the fame of the city. 

The wealth of Amathus was derived partly from its grain&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] 340, quoting the mid-sixth century writer [[Hipponax]].&lt;/ref&gt; partly from its sheep and [[copper]] mines,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'' x. 220, 227. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; of which traces can be seen inland.&lt;ref&gt;G. Mariti, i. 187; L. Ross, ''Inselreise,'' iv. 195; W. H. Engel, ''Kypros,'' i. 111 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Amathus was a rich and densely populated kingdom with a flourishing agriculture and mines situated very close to the northeast [[Tenta, Cyprus|Kalavasos]]. In the Roman era it became the capital of one of the four administrative regions of Cyprus.

==In Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages==
Later, in the fourth century AD Amasus became the see of a Christian bishop and continued to flourish until the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period. In the late sixth century, Ayios Ioannis Eleimonas (Saint John the Charitable), protector of the [[Knights of St. John]], was born in Amathus.

Amathus still flourished and produced a distinguished patriarch of [[Alexandria]], [[St. John the Merciful]], as late as 606-616, and a ruined [[Byzantian Empire|Byzantine]] church marks the site; but it declined and was already almost deserted when [[Richard I of England|Richard Plantagenet]] won Cyprus by a victory there over [[Isaac Comnenus of Cyprus|Isaac Comnenus]] in 1191. The tombs were plundered and the stones from the beautiful edifices were brought to [[Limassol]] to be used for new constructions. Much later, in 1869, a great number of blocks of stone from Amathus were used for the construction of the [[Suez Canal]].

==In modern times==
A new settlement close to Amathus but further inland, Agios Tychonas, is named after the bishop Saint [[Tychon of Amathus]]. The site of the ruins is within the borders of this village, though the expansion of the Limassol tourist area has threatened the ruins: it is speculated that some of the hotels are on top of the Amathus necropolis.

The city had vanished, except fragments of wall and of a great stone cistern on the acropolis. A similar vessel was transported to the [[Musée du Louvre]] in 1867, a limestone ''dim'', used for storing the must from the grapes, which dates to the sixth century BC. It is {{convert|1.85|m|0|abbr=on}} high and weighs 14 tons. It was made from a single stone and has four curved handles bearing the head of a bull. In the 1870s [[Luigi Palma di Cesnola]] carried out excavations in the [[necropolis]] of  Amathus, as elsewhere in Cyprus, enriching the early collections of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]; some objects went to the [[British Museum]]. More modern archaeological joint Cypriote-French excavations started in 1980 and continue. The Acropolis, the Temple of Aphrodite, the market, the city’s walls, the [[basilica]] and the port have all been excavated.

Further archaeological objects found during the excavations are conserved at the Cyprus Museum in Nicosia, as well as at the Limassol District Archaeological Museum.  
 
In the market marble columns are decorated with spiral ornaments; there are  huge paved precincts. At the coastal side of the city there are indications of an Early Christian basilica with mosaic floors decorated with semi-precious stones. Farther, near the terraced road leading to the Temple, situated on the top of the cliff, several houses built in a row dating to the Hellenistic period have been discovered. In the east and west extremes of the city the two acropoleis are situated, where a number of tombs have been found, many of which are intact. 

Two small sanctuaries, with terracotta votive offerings of Graeco-Phoenician age, lie not far off, but the location of the great shrines of Adonis and Aphrodite have not been identified (M. Ohnefalsch-Richter, ''Kypros,'' i. ch.1).

'''''Alfonso''''' (Italian and Spanish), '''''Alfons''''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], Dutch, German and Polish), '''''Afonso''''' (Portuguese and [[Galician language|Galician]]), '''''Affonso''''' (Ancient Portuguese), '''''[[Alphonse]]''''', '''''Alfonse''''' (Italian, French and English), '''''Αλφόνσος''''' ('''Alfonsos''', '''Alphonsos''') (Greek), '''''Alphonsus''''' (Latin), '''''Alphons''''' (Dutch), '''''Alfonsu''''' in ([[Leonese language|Leonese]]) or '''''Alphonso''''' (English and [[Filipino language|Filipino]]) is a masculine name, originally from the [[Gothic language]], '''''Alfonsas''''' (Lithuanian).

The original meaning of the name is uncertain. It could be derived from ''adal'' &quot;noble&quot; and ''funs'' &quot;ready&quot; or from the name '''''Hildefuns''''', which is preserved in the Spanish and Portuguese '''''Ildefonso''''' ([[Latinisation (literature)|Latinised]] as ''Ildephonsus'') and means &quot;battle ready&quot; (''hild'' &quot;battle&quot; combined with ''funs'' &quot;ready&quot;). In any case is almost certainly of Germanic and not of Latin origin.

It is the name of many historical personages and others:

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|the Amati family of luthiers|the proposed automobile marque|Mazda}}
'''Amati''' is the name of a family of [[Italy|Italian]] [[violin]] makers, who flourished at [[Cremona]] from about 1549 to 1740.

==Family members==
===Andrea Amati===
'''Andrea Amati''' (ca. 1505 – ca. 1578) was not the earliest maker of violins whose instruments still survive today. Indeed he seems more or less responsible together with Gasparo da Salò and some Micheli's like Zanetto or Pellegrino for giving the instruments of the modern violin family their definitive profile. A very small number of his instruments survive, dated between the years of 1560 and 1574 and most bearing the coat of arms of [[Charles IX of France]].  His work is marked by great elegance and an awareness of geometrical principles in design.
&lt;ref&gt;Dilworth, John. &quot;The Violin and Bow-Origins and Development.&quot; ''The Cambridge Companion to the Violin''. Ed. Robin Stowell. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992. 1–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antonio and Girolamo Amati===
Andrea Amati was succeeded by his sons '''Antonio Amati''' (born ca. 1550) and '''Girolamo Amati''' (1551–1635). &quot;The Brothers Amati&quot;, as they were known, implemented far-reaching innovations in design, including the perfection of the shape of the [[f-holes]]. They are also thought to have pioneered the modern alto format of [[viola]], in contrast to older tenor violas, but this stating is not correct since Gasparo made violas from altos of 39 to tenors of 44,7 cm.

===Nicolo Amati===
{{main|Nicolò Amati}}
'''Nicolò Amati''' (December 3, 1596 – April 12, 1684) was the son of Girolamo Amati. He was the most eminent of the family. He improved the model adopted by the rest of the Amatis and produced instruments capable of yielding greater power of [[timbre|tone]]. His pattern was unusually small, but he also made a wider model now known as the &quot;Grand Amati&quot;, which have become his most sought-after violins.

Of his pupils, the most famous were [[Antonio Stradivari]] and [[Andrea Guarneri]], the first of the Guarneri family of violin makers. (There is much controversy regarding the apprenticeship of Antonio Stradivari. While Stradivari's first known violin states that he was a pupil of Amati, the validity of his statement is questioned.)

===Girolamo Amati (Hieronymus II)===
The last maker of the family was Nicolo's son, '''Girolamo Amati''', known as '''Hieronymus II''' (February 26, 1649 – February 21, 1740). Although he improved on the arching of his father's instruments, by and large they are inferior and no match for the greatest maker of his day, Antonio Stradivari.

The '''Amazons''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀμαζόνες}}, ''Amazónes'', singular {{lang|grc|Ἀμαζών}}, ''Amazōn'') are a nation of all-female warriors in [[Classical antiquity]] and [[Greek mythology]]. [[Herodotus]] placed them in a region bordering [[Scythia]] in [[Sarmatians|Sarmatia]] (modern territory of [[Ukraine]]). Other historiographers place them in [[Asia Minor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=0627113515282-2010-06-28 |title=4,000-year-old legend about northern Turkey to become film - Hurriyet Daily News and Economic Review |publisher=Hurriyetdailynews.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Libya|Libya]],&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Schmitz | first = Leonhard | authorlink = Leonhard Schmitz | title = Amazones | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 137–138 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0146.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Ancient India|India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india9.com/i9show/Unniyarcha-78557.htm India9.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable queens of the Amazons are '''[[Penthesilea]]''', who participated in the [[Trojan War]], and her sister '''[[Hippolyta]]''', whose magical girdle, given to her by her father [[Ares]], was the object of one of the [[labours of Hercules]]. Amazonian raiders were often depicted in battle with Greek warriors in [[amazonomachy|amazonomachies]] in classical art.  

The Amazons have become associated with various historical peoples throughout the [[Roman Empire period]] and [[Late Antiquity]]. In [[Roman historiography]], there are various accounts of Amazon raids in Asia Minor. From the Early Modern period, their name has become a term for [[woman warrior]]s in general.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word is uncertain. It may be derived from an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[ethnonym]] ''*ha-mazan-'', &quot;warriors&quot;, a word attested as a denominal verb (formed with the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] root ''kar-'' &quot;make&quot; also in ''[[karma|kar-ma]]'')  in [[Hesychius of Alexandria]]'s gloss {{polytonic|ἁμαζακάραν· πολεμεῖν. Πέρσαι}} (&quot;''hamazakaran'': 'to make war' (Persian)&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz,  ''Xenia Lide´niana'' (1912), 270ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]], ''Greek Etymological Dictionary'' (1960, 1970) [http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/param-change-handle.cgi?url=response.cgi%3Froot%3Dleiden%26morpho%3D0%26basename%3D\data\ie\frisk%26first%3D351&amp;encoding=utf-eng]&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively, a Greek derivation from ''{{PIE|*ṇ-mṇ-gw-jon-es}}'' &quot;manless, without husbands&quot; ([[privative a|''a-'' privative]] and a derivation of ''[[Man (word)|*man-]]'' also found in Slavic ''muzh'') has been proposed, an explanation deemed &quot;unlikely&quot; by [[Hjalmar Frisk]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsohn, [[Kuhns Zeitschrift|KZ]] 54, 278ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]] (1960, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;
19th century scholarship also connected the term to the ethnonym [[Amazigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Cadogan Rothery, ''The Amazons
'' (1910) , [http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/ama/ama08.htm ch. 7]: &quot;There have been some authors who trace the word Amazon from this term.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Classical Greeks, ''amazon'' was given a [[popular etymology]] as from ''a-mazos'', &quot;without [[breast]]&quot;, connected with an [[etiology|etiological]] tradition that Amazons had their right [[mastectomy|breast cut off]] or [[breast ironing|burnt out]], so they would be able to use a bow more freely and throw spears without the physical limitation and obstruction;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no indication of such a practice in works of art, in which the Amazons are always represented with both breasts, although the right is frequently covered.

==Origins==
[[File:Amazons vs Greeks.jpg|thumb|300px|left|A [[Woodcut]] depicting defeated Greeks being cruelly executed by Amazons.]]
[[File:Amazon trousers BM VaseB673.jpg|upright|thumb|Amazon wearing trousers and carrying a shield with an attached patterned cloth and a quiver. [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] Attic white-ground [[alabastron]], ca. 470 BC, [[British Museum]], London]]

Amazons were said to have lived in [[Pontus]], which is part of modern day [[Turkey]] near the shore of the [[Euxine Sea]] (the [[Black Sea]]). There they formed an independent kingdom under the government of a queen named [[Hippolyta]] or [[Hippolyta|Hippolyte]] (&quot;loose, unbridled mare&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;This area is known to have been occupied in the Late Bronze Age by a transhumant group known to the Hittites as the [[Kaskians|Kaŝka]]; though they were not directly known to Greeks, modern archaeologists have detected that they finally defeated their enemies, the Hittites, about 1200 BCE; they left no inscriptions.&lt;/ref&gt; The Amazons were supposed to have founded many towns, amongst them [[Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]], [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], and [[Paphos]]. According to the dramatist [[Aeschylus]], in the distant past they had lived in [[Scythia]] (modern [[Crimea]]), at the ''Palus Maeotis'' (&quot;Lake Maeotis&quot;, the [[Sea of Azov]]), but later moved to [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]] on the River [[Thermodon]] (the Terme river in northern Turkey). [[Herodotus]] called them ''Androktones'' (&quot;killers of men&quot;), and he stated that in the Scythian language they were called ''Oiorpata'', which he asserted had this meaning.

==The myth==
In some versions of the myth, no men were permitted to have sexual encounters or reside in Amazon country; but once a year, in order to prevent their race from dying out, they visited the [[Gargareans]], a neighbouring tribe.  The male children who were the result of these visits were either killed, sent back to their fathers or [[child abandonment|exposed in the wilderness]] to fend for themselves; the females were kept and brought up by their mothers, and trained in agricultural pursuits, hunting, and the art of war. In other versions when the Amazons went to war they would not kill all the men. Some they would take as slaves, and once or twice a year they would have [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] with their slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] xi. 503.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Iliad]]'', the Amazons were referred to as ''Antianeirai'' (&quot;those who fight like men&quot;). 

The Amazons appear in [[Greek art]] of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] and in connection with several Greek legends. They invaded [[Lycia]], but were defeated by [[Bellerophon]], who was sent against them by [[Iobates]], the king of that country, in the hope that he might meet his death at their hands.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' vi. 186, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]] ''On [[Lycophron]]'' 17&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb of '''[[Myrine]]''' is mentioned in the ''Iliad''; later interpretation made of her an Amazon: according to [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' Book ii.45-46; book iii.52-55&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Myrine led her Amazons to victory against [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] and much of [[Gorgon]].

They attacked the [[Phrygia]]ns, who were assisted by [[Priam]], then a young man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' iii. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Although in his later years, towards the end of the [[Trojan War]], his old opponents took his side again against the Greeks under their queen [[Penthesilea]] &quot;of [[Thrace|Thracian]] birth&quot;, who was slain by [[Achilles]].&lt;ref&gt;In the ''[[Aethiopis]]'', a continuation of the ''Iliad''. The epic, by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], is lost: only references to it survive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] i. 699&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justin]] ii.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 490&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' v. 11. § 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]] ''Her.'' xix. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the tasks imposed upon [[Heracles]] by [[Eurystheus]] was to obtain possession of the [[girdle]] of the Amazonian queen [[Hippolyta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' ii. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' iv. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] xi. 244&lt;/ref&gt; He was accompanied by his friend [[Theseus]], who carried off the princess '''[[Antiope (mythology)|Antiope]]''', sister of Hippolyte, an incident which led to a retaliatory invasion of [[Attica]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' i. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Theseus'' 26-28&lt;/ref&gt; in which Antiope perished fighting by the side of Theseus. In some versions, however, Theseus marries Hippolyta and in others, he marries Antiope and she does not die; by this marriage with the Amazon Theseus had a son [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]]. The battle between the Athenians and Amazons is often commemorated in an entire genre of art, [[amazonomachy]], in marble [[bas-relief]]s such as from the [[Parthenon]] or the sculptures of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]].
[[Image:Thalestris, Queen of the Amazons, visits Alexander (1696).jpg|left|thumb|[[Thalestris]], Queen of the Amazons, visits [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] (1696)]]

The Amazons are also said to have undertaken an expedition against the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|island of Leuke]], at the mouth of the [[Danube]], where the ashes of Achilles had been deposited by [[Thetis]]. The ghost of the dead hero appeared and so terrified the horses, that they threw and trampled upon the invaders, who were forced to retire. [[Pompey]] is said to have found them in the army of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]].

They are heard of in the time of Alexander, when some of the king's biographers make mention of Amazon Queen '''[[Thalestris]]''' visiting him and becoming a mother by him (the story is known from the ''[[Alexander Romance]]''). However, several other biographers of Alexander dispute the claim, including the highly regarded [[secondary source]], [[Plutarch]]. In his writing he makes mention of a moment when Alexander's secondary naval commander, [[Onesicritus]], was reading the Amazon passage of his Alexander history to King [[Lysimachus]] of [[Thrace]] who was on the original expedition: the king smiled at him and said &quot;And where was I, then?&quot;

The Roman writer [[Virgil]]'s characterization of the [[Volsci]]an warrior maiden [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' borrows heavily from the myth of the Amazons.

[[Jordanes]]' ''[[Getica]]'' (c. 560), purporting to give the earliest history of the [[Goths]], relates that the Goths' ancestors, descendants of [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]], originally dwelt within Scythia, on the [[Sea of Azov]] between the [[Dnieper]] and [[Don River]]s.  After a few centuries, following an incident where the Goths' women successfully fended off a raid by a neighboring tribe, while the menfolk were off campaigning against Pharaoh [[Vesosis]], the women formed their own army under [[Marpesia]] and crossed the Don, invading Asia.  Her sister [[Lampedo]] remained in Europe to guard the homeland. They procreated with men once a year. These Amazons conquered Armenia, Syria, and all of Asia Minor, even reaching [[Ionia]] and [[Aeolia]], holding this vast territory for 100 years. Jordanes also mentions that they fought with Hercules, and in the Trojan War, and that a smaller contingent of them endured in the Caucasus Mountains until the time of Alexander. He mentions by name the Queens Menalippe, Hippolyte, and Penthesilea.

===Lists===
There are several (conflicting) lists of names of Amazons.

[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], ''[[Posthomerica]]'' I&lt;/ref&gt; lists the attendant warriors of Penthesilea: &quot;'''Clonie''' was there, '''Polemusa''', '''Derinoe''', '''Evandre''', and '''[[Antandre]]''', and '''[[Bremusa]]''', '''[[Hippothoe]]''', dark-eyed '''Harmothoe''', '''[[Alcibie]]''', '''Derimacheia''', '''Antibrote''', and '''Thermodosa''' glorying with the spear.&quot; 

[[Diodorus Siculus]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' IV. 16&lt;/ref&gt; enlists nine Amazons who challenged Heracles to single combat during his quest for Hippolyte's girdle and died against him one by one: '''[[Aella (Amazon)|Aella]]''', '''Philippis''', '''Prothoe''', '''Eriboea''', '''[[Celaeno]]''', '''Eurybia''', '''[[Phoebe]]''', '''Deianeira''', '''[[Asteria]]''', '''Marpe''', '''Tecmessa''', '''[[Alcippe]]'''. After Alcippe's death, a group attack followed.

Another list of Amazons' names is found in [[Hyginus]]' ''Fabulae''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 163&lt;/ref&gt; Along with  [[Hippolyte]], [[Otrera]], [[Antiope (mythology)|Antiope]] and [[Penthesilea]], it attests the following names: '''Ocyale''', '''Dioxippe''', '''Iphinome''', '''Xanthe''', '''[[Hippothoe]]''', '''Laomache''', '''[[Glauce]]''', '''[[Agave]]''', '''Theseis''',''' [[Clymene]]''', '''[[Polydora]]'''.

Yet another different set of names is found in [[Valerius Flaccus]]' ''Argonautica''&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Flaccus]], ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/ValeriusFlaccus1.html Argonautica]'', 6. 370-377&lt;/ref&gt;: he mentions '''Euryale''', '''Harpe''', '''Lyce''', '''Menippe''' and '''Thoe'''.

[[John Tzetzes]] in ''Posthomerica''&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]], ''Posthomerica'', 176-183&lt;/ref&gt; enumerates the Amazons that fell at [[Troy]]: '''Hippothoe''', '''Antianeira''', '''Toxophone''', '''Toxoanassa''', '''Gortyessa''', '''Iodoce''', '''Pharetre''', '''Andro''', '''Ioxeia''', '''Oïstrophe''', '''Androdaïxa''', '''Aspidocharme''', '''Enchesimargos''', '''Cnemis''', '''Thorece''', '''Chalcaor''', '''Eurylophe''', '''Hecate''', '''Anchimache''', '''Andromache''' the queen. Concerning Antianeira and Andromache, see below; for almost all the other names on the list, this is a unique attestation.

Other names of Amazons from various sources include:
* '''[[Aegea]]''', queen of the Amazons who was thought by some to have been the [[eponym]] of the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus]], s. v. ''Aegeum Mare''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hero cults===
According to ancient sources, ([[Plutarch]] [[Theseus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:BiDerPMT15YJ:classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/theseus.html+Amazon+statues+in+Scotussa&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4 |title=The Internet Classics Archive &amp;#124; Theseus by Plutarch |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]), Amazon tombs could be found frequently throughout what was once known as the ancient Greek world. Some are found in [[Megara]], [[Athens]], [[Chaeronea]], [[Chalcis]], [[Thessaly]] at [[Skotousa]], in [[Cynoscephalae]] and statues of Amazons are all over Greece. At both [[Chalcis]] and [[Athens]] [[Plutarch]] tells us that there was an Amazoneum or shrine of Amazons that implied the presence of both tombs and cult. On the day before the Thesea at Athens there were annual sacrifices to the Amazons. In historical times Greek maidens of [[Ephesus]] performed an annual circular dance with weapons and shields that had been established by [[Hippolyta]] and her Amazons. They had initially set up wooden statues of [[Artemis]], a bretas, ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], (fl.c.[[160]]): Description of Greece, Book I: Attica).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/pausanias-bk1.html Ancient History Sourcebook: Pausanias: Description of Greece, Book I: Attica&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In art===
In works of art, battles between Amazons and Greeks are placed on the same level as and often associated with battles of Greeks and [[centaur]]s. The belief in their existence, however, having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of not unnatural beings. Their occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield, nearly in the shape of a crescent, called ''pelta'', and in early art a helmet, the model before the Greek mind having apparently been the goddess Athena. In later art they approach the model of Artemis, wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly [[Iran|Persian]] &amp;ndash; that is, close-fitting trousers and a high cap called the kidaris. They were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot. They can also be identified in vase paintings by the fact that they are wearing one earring. The battle between Theseus and the Amazons (''[[Amazonomachy]]'') is a favourite subject on the friezes of temples (e.g. the reliefs from the frieze of the temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Bassae]], now in the [[British Museum]]), vases and sarcophagus reliefs; at [[Athens]] it was represented on the shield of the statue of [[Athena Parthenos]], on wall-paintings in the [[Theseum]] and in the [[stoa|''Stoa Poikile'']]. There were also three standard [[Amazon statue types]].

==In historiography==
[[Herodotus]] reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their females observed their ancient maternal customs, &quot;frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men&quot;. Moreover, said Herodotus, &quot;No girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle&quot;. In the story related by [[Herodotus]], a group of Amazons was blown across the [[Sea of Azov|Maeotian Lake]] (the [[Sea of Azov]]) into [[Scythia]] near the cliff region (today's southeastern [[Crimea]]). After learning the Scythian language, they agreed to marry Scythian men, on the condition that they not be required to follow the customs of Scythian women. According to Herodotus, this band moved toward the northeast, settling beyond the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]] ([[Don River (Russia)|Don]]) river, and became the ancestors of the [[Sarmatians|Sauromatians]]. According to [[Herodotus]], the [[Sarmatians]] fought with the Scythians against [[Darius the Great]] in the 5th century B.C. 

Hippocrates describes them as: &quot;They have no right breasts...for while they are yet babies their mothers make red-hot a bronze instrument constructed for this very purpose and apply it to the right breast and cauterize it, so that its growth is arrested, and all its strength and bulk are diverted to the right shoulder and right arm.&quot; (See [[breast ironing]], a current practice in which breast growth is deliberately stunted.)
 
Amazons came to play a role in [[Roman historiography]]. Caesar reminded the Senate of the conquest of large parts of Asia by [[Semiramis]] and the Amazons. Successful Amazon raids against Lycia and Cilicia contrasted with effective resistance by Lydian cavalry against the invaders ([[Strabo]] 5.504; [[Nicholas Damascenus]]). [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] pays particularly detailed attention to the Amazons. The story of the Amazons as deriving from a Cappadocian colony of two Scythian princes Ylinos and Scolopetos is due to him. [[Philostratus]] places the Amazons in the [[Taurus Mountains]]. [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] places them east of [[Tanais]], as neighbouring the [[Alans]]. [[Procopius]] places them in the Caucasus. 
[[Diodorus Siculus]] (''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' chapter 49) derived the Amazons from [[Atlantis]] and located them in western [[Ancient Libya|Libya]]. He also  relates the story of Hercules defeating the Amazons at Themiscyre.
Although Strabo shows scepticism as to their historicity, the Amazons in general continue to be taken as historical throughout Late Antiquity. Several Church Fathers speak of the Amazons as of a real people. [[Gaius Julius Solinus|Solinus]] embraces the account of [[Pliny the Elder|Plinius]]. Under [[Aurelianus]], captured [[Goths|Gothic]] women were identified as Amazons ([[Claudianus]]). The account of [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]] was influential, and was used as a source by [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] who continued to be read during the European Middle Ages. Medieval authors thus continue the tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, [[Adam of Bremen]] placing them at the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the heart of Germania.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. A. Ukert]], ''Die Amazonen'', Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (1849), 63..&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance literature==
Amazons continued to be discussed by authors of the European Renaissance, and with the [[Age of Exploration]], they were located in ever more remote areas. In 1542, [[Francisco de Orellana]] reached the [[Amazon River]] (''Amazonas'' in Spanish), naming it after a tribe of warlike women he claimed having encountered and fought there.&lt;ref&gt;It has been suggested that what Orellana actually engaged was an especially warlike tribe of Native Americans whose warrior men had long hair and thus appeared to him as women. See Theobaldo Miranda Santos, ''Lendas e mitos do Brasil'' (&quot;Brazil's legends and myths&quot;), Companhia Editora Nacional, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards the whole basin and region of the Amazon (''Amazonía'' in Spanish) were named after the river. Amazons also figure in the accounts of both [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Walter Raleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Ukert (1849), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Famous medieval traveller [[John Mandeville]] mentions them in his book:

:&quot;Beside the land of Chaldea is the land of Amazonia, that is the land of Feminye. And in that real is all woman and no man; not as some may say, that men may not live there, but for because that the women will not suffer no men amongst them to be their sovereigns.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'', Dover publications, Mineola, New York, 2006, cap. XVII, p. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval and Renaissance authors credit the Amazons with the invention of the [[Corded Ware culture|battle-axe]]. This is probably related to the [[Sagaris]], an axe-like weapon associated with both Amazons and Scythian tribes by Greek authors (see also [[Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo kurgan]]). [[Paulus Hector Mair]] expresses astonishment that such a &quot;manly weapon&quot; should have been invented by a &quot;tribe of women&quot;, but he accepts the attribution out of respect for his authority, [[Johannes Aventinus]].

[[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' contains a country of warrior women, ruled by Queen Orontea; the epic describes an origin much like that in Greek myth, in that the women, abandoned by a band of warriors and unfaithful lovers, rallied together to form a nation from which men were severely reduced, to prevent them from regaining power.They and Queen Hippolyta were also referenced in Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in The Knight's Tale.

==Historical background==
[[Classics|Classicist]] Peter Walcot wrote, &quot;Wherever the Amazons are located by the Greeks, whether it is somewhere along the Black Sea in the distant north-east, or in Libya in the furthest south, it is always beyond the confines of [[Civilization|the civilized world]]. The Amazons exist outside the range of normal human experience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;P. Walcot, &quot;Greek Attitudes towards Women: The Mythological Evidence&quot; ''Greece &amp; Rome''2nd Series '''31'''.1 (April 1984, pp. 37-47) p 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are various proposals for a historical nucleus of the Amazons of Greek historiography, the most obvious candidates being historical [[Scythia]] and [[Sarmatia]] in line with the account by [[Herodotus]], but some authors prefer a comparison to cultures of Asia Minor or even [[Minoan Crete]].

== Archaeology ==
=== Scythians and Sarmatians ===
Speculation that the idea of Amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological findings from burials, pointing to the possibility that some Sarmatian women may have participated in battle. These findings have led scholars to suggest that the Amazonian legend in [[Greek mythology]] may have been &quot;inspired by real warrior women&quot;,&lt;ref name=amaz&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml Lyn Webster Wilde, &quot;Did the Amazons really exist?&quot; ''Diotima'']&lt;/ref&gt; though this remains a minority opinion among classical historians.

Evidence of high-ranking warrior women comes from [[kurgans]] in southern Ukraine and Russia. 
David Anthony notes, &quot;About 20% of [[Scythian]]-[[Sarmatian]] &quot;warrior graves&quot; on the lower [[Don river|Don]] and lower [[Volga river|Volga]] contained females dressed for battle as if they were men, a phenomenon that probably inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons.&quot;&lt;ref name=anthonyd&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Amazone Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2342.jpg|thumb|Mounted Amazon in [[Scythia]]n costume, on an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figure vase, ca 420 BCE]]
Up to 25% of military burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml Diotima&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Russian archaeologist [[Vera Kovalevskaya]] points out that when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women would have to be able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-[[hegemony]] in the Near-East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually intended to base this on a factual base.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; Before modern archaeology uncovered some of the Scythian burials of warrior-maidens entombed under [[kurgan]]s in the region of [[Altai Mountains]] and Sarmatia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/9701/abstracts/sarmatians.html &quot;Warrior Women of Eurasia&quot;], Archaeology Magazine (Abstract) Volume 50 Number 1, January/February 1997 Retrieved 7/10/08.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;In a recent excavation of [[Sarmatian]] sites by Dr. Jeannine Davis-Kimball,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} a tomb was found wherein female warriors were buried.&lt;/ref&gt; giving concrete form at last to the Greek tales of mounted Amazons, the origin of the story of the Amazons has been the subject of speculation among classics scholars. In the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] speculation ranged along the following lines:

:&quot;While some regard the Amazons as a purely mythical people, others assume an historical foundation for them. The deities worshipped by them were [[Ares]] (who is consistently assigned to them as a god of war, and as a god of [[Thrace|Thracian]] and generally northern origin) and [[Artemis]], not the usual Greek goddess of that name, but an Asiatic deity in some respects her equivalent. It is conjectured that the Amazons were originally the temple-servants and priestesses (''hierodulae'') of this goddess; and that the removal of the breast corresponded with the self-mutilation of the god [[Attis]] and the [[galli]], Roman priests of [[Cybele|Rhea Cybele]]. Another theory is that, as the knowledge of geography extended, travellers brought back reports of tribes ruled entirely by women, who carried out the duties which elsewhere were regarded as peculiar to man, in whom alone the rights of nobility and inheritance were vested, and who had the supreme control of affairs. Hence arose the belief in the Amazons as a nation of female warriors, organized and governed entirely by women. According to J. Viirtheim (''De Ajacis'' origine, 1907), the Amazons were of Greek origin [...] It has been suggested that the fact of the conquest of the Amazons being assigned to the two famous heroes of Greek mythology, Heracles and Theseus [...] shows that they were mythical illustrations of the dangers which beset the Greeks on the coasts of Asia Minor; rather perhaps, it may be intended to represent the conflict between the Greek culture of the colonies on the [[Black Sea|Euxine]] and the barbarism of the native inhabitants.&quot;
[[Image:Deruet-Departure of the Amazons-1620.jpg|thumb|400px|''Departure of the Amazons'', by [[Claude Deruet]], 1620.]]

===Minoan Crete===
When Minoan archeology was still in its infancy, nevertheless, a theory raised in an essay regarding the Amazons contributed by [[Lewis Richard Farnell]] and [[John Myres]] to [[Robert Ranulph Marett]]'s ''Anthropology and the Classics'' (1908),&lt;ref&gt;L.R. Farnell and J.L. Myres, &quot;Herodotus and anthropology&quot; in [[Robert Ranulph Marett|Robert R. Marett]] ''Anthropology and the Classics'' 1908, pp. 138ff.&lt;/ref&gt; placed their possible origins in [[Minoan civilization]], drawing attention to overlooked similarities between the two cultures. According to Myres, (pp.&amp;nbsp;153 ff), the tradition interpreted in the light of evidence furnished by supposed Amazon cults seems to have been very similar and may have even originated in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] culture. &lt;!--The following is a &quot;hard sell&quot; for an outdated idea: &quot;The theory that the Amazons originally represented Minoan Crete's females has a strong case based on what [[archeologists]] and historians have been discovering about Minoan culture. Out of all the ancient civilizations which are so far known to archaeologists and historians the Minoans seem to fit most of the aspects that classical Greeks and later scholars have come to associate with the Amazonian culture.&quot;--&gt;

'''Ambergris''' ('''Ambra grisea''', '''Ambre gris''', '''ambergrease''', or '''grey amber''') is a solid, waxy, flammable substance of a dull gray or blackish color produced in the digestive system of and regurgitated or excreted by [[sperm whale]]s.

Freshly produced ambergris has a marine, fecal odor.  However, as it ages, it acquires a sweet, earthy scent commonly likened to the fragrance of [[rubbing alcohol]] without the vaporous chemical astringency. The principal historical use of ambergris was as a [[fixative (perfumery)|fixative]] in [[perfumery]], though it has now been largely displaced by synthetics.

== Source ==

Ambergris occurs as a [[biliary]] [[secretion]] of the [[intestines]] of the sperm whale and can be found floating upon the sea, or in the sand near the coast. It is also sometimes found in the [[abdomen]]s of [[whale]]s. Because the beaks of [[giant squid]]s have been found embedded within lumps of ambergris, scientists have theorised that the substance is produced by the whale's gastrointestinal tract to ease the passage of hard, sharp objects that the whale might have eaten.

Ambergris is usually passed in the fecal matter. Ambergris that forms a mass too large to be passed through the intestines is expelled via the mouth, leading to the reputation of ambergris as primarily coming from whale vomit.&lt;ref&gt;William F. Perrin, Bernd Würsig, J. G. M. Thewissen, Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambergris can be found in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and on the coasts of [[Brazil]], [[Madagascar]] the [[East Indies]], [[The Maldives]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[India]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[Maluku Islands|Molucca islands]]. Most commercially collected ambergris comes from [[The Bahamas]] in the Caribbean, particularly [[New Providence]].

== Physical properties ==

Ambergris is found in lumps of various shapes and sizes, weighing from 15&amp;nbsp;[[gram|g]] (½&amp;nbsp;[[ounce|oz]]) to 50&amp;nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]] (100&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|pounds]]) or more. When initially expelled by or removed from the whale, the fatty precursor of ambergris is pale white in color (sometimes streaked with black), soft, with a strong fecal smell. Following months to years of [[photo-degradation]] and [[oxidation]] in the ocean, this precursor gradually hardens, developing a dark gray or black color, a crusty and waxy texture, and a peculiar odor that is at once sweet, earthy, marine, and animalic. Its smell has been generally described as a vastly richer and smoother version of [[isopropanol]] without its stinging harshness.

In this developed condition, ambergris has a [[specific gravity]] ranging from 0.780 to 0.926. It melts at about 62[[degree (temperature)|°]][[celsius|C]] to a fatty, yellow resinous liquid; and at {{convert|100|C|0|abbr=on}} it is volatilized into a white vapor. It is soluble in [[diethyl ether|ether]], and in volatile and fixed oils.

== Chemical properties ==

Ambergris is relatively nonreactive to [[acid]]. White crystals of a substance called [[ambrein]] can be separated from ambergris by heating raw ambergris in alcohol, then allowing the resulting solution to cool.

== Historical and cross-cultural uses==

Ambergris has been mostly known for its use in creating perfume and fragrance much like [[musk]]. While perfumes can still be found with ambergris around the world, American perfumers usually avoid it because of legal ambiguities. It was banned from use in many countries in the 1970s, including the United States, because its precursor originates from the [[sperm whale]], which is an endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/cetaceans/spermwhale.htm Office of Protected Resources] The sperm whale was listed as endangered throughout its range on June 2, 1970 under the Endangered Species Conservation Act of 1969 (35 FR 8495) and is also protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been legal since 2005 because of strict monitoring of distributors who ensure that only ambergris that has been naturally washed to shore is sold. Ancient Egyptians burned ambergris as incense, while in modern Egypt ambergris is used for scenting cigarettes.&lt;ref name=&quot;MatHB&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Materials Handbook: An Encyclopedia for Managers, Technical Professionals, Purchasing and Production Managers, Technicians, and Supervisors |page=64 |author=Brady, George Stuart; Clauser,  Henry R.; Vaccari, John A.|isbn=978-0-07-136076-0 |year=2002 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Chinese called the substance &quot;dragon's spittle fragrance&quot;.&lt;ref name=sciam&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa029&amp;articleID=2E5F81BB-E7F2-99DF-3928BF47EA6CBAC3 |title=Strange but True: Whale Waste Is Extremely Valuable: Scientific American |publisher=Sciam.com |date=2007-04-26 |accessdate=2010-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Black Death]] in Europe, people believed that carrying a ball of ambergris could help prevent them from getting the plague.  This was because the fragrance covered the smell of the air which was believed to be the [[Miasma theory of disease|cause of plague]].

This substance has also been used historically as a flavouring for food, and some people consider it an aphrodisiac. During the Middle Ages, Europeans used ambergris as a medication for headaches, colds, epilepsy, and other ailments.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt;

== In popular culture ==

[[Heston Blumenthal]] used ambergris as an ingredient in [[cucumber]] jelly created for the [[Channel Four]] television programme &quot;Heston's Christmas Feast&quot; in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|title=Heston's Christmas Feast|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2009/dec/18/hestons-christmas-feast-review|accessdate=16 April 2011|newspaper=Guardian (UK)|date=18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd]]'', [[Beadle Bamford]] refers to his cologne as having &quot;a touch of ambergris&quot;.

In &quot;[[The Fountain of Lamneth]]&quot;, a song by [[Rush (band)|Rush]], the protagonist catches &quot;the scent of ambergris&quot; in the Part IV: ''Panacea'' section of the song.

In &quot;[[Three Hundred Big Boys]]&quot;, an episode of [[Futurama]], Kif is arrested after retrieving a watch from the vomit of a sperm whale and being deemed a thief. He finds out later that what he in fact unintentionally &quot;stole&quot; was significant amounts of precious ambergris that comprised the vomit and had clung to his clothing.

In &quot;[[Lead 'Em and Weep]]&quot;, an episode of ''[[The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack]]'', Bubbie spits out ambergris to a hypnotized Captain K'nuckles thinking he's a seal so Flapjack could save him.

There is a song called &quot;Amber Gris&quot; by the [[avant-garde]] [[jazz]] trio [[Medeski, Martin and Wood]].  They frequently play the song live, and it is recorded on the album &quot;Radiolarians II.&quot;

[[Image:Ambiorix.jpg|thumb|Statue of Ambiorix in [[Tongeren]] (a fanciful interpretation, rather than an archaeological reconstruction, of his possible appearance).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}]]
'''Ambiorix''' was, together with [[Catuvolcus]], prince of the [[Eburones]], leader of a [[Belgae|Belgic]] tribe of north-eastern [[Gaul]] ([[Gallia Belgica]]), where modern [[Belgium]] is located. In the 19th century Ambiorix became a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Folk hero|national hero]] because of his [[Resistance movement|resistance]] against [[Julius Caesar]], as written in Caesar's ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Smith | first = William | authorlink = William Smith (lexicographer) | title = Ambiorix | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 138–139 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0147.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==

In 57 BC Julius Caesar conquered [[Gaul]] and also [[Belgica]] (modernday Northern France, Belgium and a southern section of  the [[Netherlands]] to the [[Rhine]] River; and the north-western portion of North Rhine-Westfalia, Germany.) There were several tribes in the country who fought against each other regularly. The [[Eburones]] were ruled by Ambiorix and [[Catuvolcus]]. In 54 BC Caesar's troops urgently needed more food and thereby the local tribes were forced to give up part of their [[harvest]], which had not been good that year. Understandably the [[starving]] Eburones were reluctant to do so and Caesar ordered that [[Military camp|camps]] be built near the Eburones' villages. Each [[centurion]] was ordered to make sure the food supplies were delivered to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[soldiers]]. This created resentment among the Eburones. 

Although [[Julius Caesar]] had freed him from paying tribute to the [[Atuatuci]], Ambiorix joined [[Catuvolcus]] in the winter of 54 BC in an uprising against the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] forces under [[Quintus Titurius Sabinus]] and [[Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta]].

==Resisting the Romans==

Ambiorix and his tribesmen attacked and killed several Roman soldiers who were foraging for [[wood]] in the nearby vicinity. The survivors fled back to their camp, followed by Ambiorix and his men. There he realised there were too many Romans for his troops to fight and he decided to negotiate with them. Ambiorix explained to the Roman camp leaders, Sabinus and [[Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta|Cotta]], that he had no problems with them and in fact, was very happy with them, because now he had no troubles with the other [[tribe]]s. He warned the Romans that a coalition of other tribes were planning to attack them and would get the support of the German tribes who would cross the [[Rhine]]. Ambiorix advised them to relocate to another Roman [[Military camp|camp]] so that they would be stronger to battle these troops. He also promised them he would leave them alone when they made this crossing.

Sabinus and Cotta debated the whole night on what they should do. Sabinus trusted Ambiorix and considered it would be wise to do what he had advised them. Cotta thought it would be better to stay and try to fight back when the attacks would happen. Ultimately, Cotta decided they would stay, but it wouldn't be his fault if they all got killed by doing so. This made the Roman troops very unsure and therefore they decided to leave anyway. The two closest Roman camps were behind hills and in the other option behind a plain near a valley. Sabinus and Cotta chose for the easy solution and crossed the valley. While they crossed the valley Ambiorix and his men attacked them from up the hills and slaughtered them. Sabinus, Cotta and their troops were massacred.

==Caesar's revenge==

When the Roman [[Roman senate|Senate]] heard what happened, Caesar swore to put down all the Belgic tribes. It was very important that the other Roman provinces know that the almighty Roman republic couldn't be beaten so easily. After all, Ambiorix had killed a whole Roman [[Roman legion#Imperial legion|legion]] and five [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]]. A Belgic attack on [[Quintus Cicero]] (brother of the [[Cicero|orator]]), then stationed with a legion in the [[Nervii]]'s territory, failed due to the timely appearance of Caesar.  The Roman campaigns against the [[Belgae]] took a few years, but eventually the Belgae were no match against 50,000 trained Roman soldiers. The tribes were slaughtered or driven out and their fields burned. The Eburones were history from that point. According to the writer [[Florus]], Ambiorix and his men managed to cross the [[Rhine]] and disappear without a trace.&lt;ref&gt;[[Florus]], iii. 10. § 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Caesar wrote about Ambiorix in his commentary about his battles against the Gauls: &quot;[[De Bello Gallico]]&quot;. In this text he also wrote the famous line: &quot;Of all the Gauls, the Belgae are the bravest.&quot; (&quot;...Horum omnium fortissimi sunt Belgae...&quot;).  

Ambiorix remained forgotten until the 19th century. When Belgium became independent in 1830 the national government started searching through their historical archives for persons who could serve as [[national heroes]]. In Caesar's &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot; they discovered Ambiorix and his deeds. In 1841 the Belgian [[poet]] Joannes Nolet de Brauwere van Steeland wrote a [[lyric poetry|lyric]]al [[epic poetry|epic]] about Ambiorix and on September 5, 1866 a [[statue]] of Ambiorix was erected on the Great Market of [[Tongeren]] in [[Belgium]]. There is no proof he ever lived there, but since [[Tongeren]] is [[Belgium]]'s oldest city and Caesar referenced [[Atuatuca]] (Tongeren's original name was ''Atuatuca Tongorum'') it was placed there.

Nowadays Ambiorix is one of the most famous characters in [[Belgium|Belgian]] history. Many companies, bars and [[friterie|french fry stands]] have named themselves after him and in many Belgian [[comics]] such as [[Suske en Wiske]] and [[Jommeke]] he has played a guest role. There was also a short lived comic called ''Ambionix'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ambionix official home page |url=http://www.wimswerts.be/htmlmap/ambionix.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which features a scientist teleporting a [[Belgae]] chief, loosely based on Ambiorix, to modern day [[Belgium]].

In the French comic [[Asterix]] in the album [[Asterix in Belgium]] [[Asterix]], [[Obelix]], [[Dogmatix]] and [[Recurring characters in Asterix#Vitalstatistix|Vitalstatistix]] go to Belgium because they are angry with Caesar about his remark that the Belgians are the bravest of all the Gauls.

In 2005 Ambiorix was nominated for the title [[De Grootste Belg]] (The Greatest Belgian). In the [[Flemish Community of Belgium|Flemish]] edition he ended in fourth place. In the [[French Community of Belgium|Walloon]] edition he ended in 50th place.

'''August Wilhelm Ambros''' (November 17, 1816 &amp;ndash; June 28, 1876)&lt;ref name=Blom&gt;[[Eric Blom|Blom, Eric]] (2005) ''Everyman's Dictionary of Music'', Kessinger Publishing. p. 15. ISBN 1-4179-8918-1.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Austria]]n composer and music historian of [[Czech people|Czech]] descent.

== Life ==
He was born at [[Mýto]], [[Rokycany District]], [[Bohemia]].&lt;ref name=Blom /&gt; His father was a cultured man, and his mother was the sister of [[Raphael Georg Kiesewetter]]&lt;ref&gt;Todd. R. Larry. (1991) ''Mendelssohn and His World'', Princeton University Press. p. 304. ISBN 0-691-02715-3.&lt;/ref&gt; (1773-1850), the musical archaeologist and collector. Ambros studied at the [[Charles University of Prague|University of Prague]]&lt;ref name=Blom /&gt; and was well-educated in music and the arts, which were his abiding passion. He was, however, destined for the law and an official career in the Austrian civil service, and he occupied various important posts under the ministry of justice, music being an [[avocation]].

From 1850 onwards he became well-known as a critic and essay-writer, and in 1860 he began working on his magnum opus, his ''History of Music'', which was published at intervals from 1862&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Henry Lang|Lang, Paul Henry]]. (1997) ''Music in Western Civilization'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company. p. 987. ISBN 0-393-04074-7.&lt;/ref&gt; in five volumes, the last two (1878, 1882) being edited and completed by [[Otto Kade]] and [[Wilhelm Langhans]]. 

Ambros was professor of the history of music at [[Prague]] from 1869 to 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Meinong, Alexius &amp; [[Guido Adler|Adler, Guido]] (1995) ''Eine Freundschaft in Briefen Alexius'', Rodopi. p. 8. ISBN 90-5183-867-0.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Prague, he seated on the board of governors in the [[Prague Conservatory|Prague Royal Conservatory]]. By 1872, he was living in Vienna and was employed by the Department of Justice as an officer and by [[Prince Rudolf]]'s family as his tutor. Through his work in Vienna, he was given leave of absence for half the year in order to let him travel the world to collect musical information to include in his ''History of Music'' book. He was an excellent [[pianist]], and the author of numerous compositions somewhat reminiscent of [[Felix Mendelssohn]].

Ambros died at [[Vienna]], Austria at the age of 59.

In its upper stretches the Amazon river is called [[Apurímac River|Apurímac]] (in Peru) and [[Solimões]] (in Brazil).

The width of the Amazon varies between {{convert|1.6|and|10|km|mi}} at low stage, but expands during the wet season to {{convert|48|km|mi}} or more. The river enters the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in a broad [[estuary]] about {{convert|240|km|mi}} wide.

At no point is the Amazon crossed by bridges.&lt;ref name=encarta/&gt; This is not because of its huge dimensions; in fact, for most of its length, the Amazon's width is well within the capability of modern engineers to bridge. However, the bulk of the river flows through [[Amazon rain forest|tropical rainforest]], where there are few roads or cities, limiting the need for crossings.

The Amazon Basin, the largest drainage basin in the world, covers about 40 percent of South America, an area of approximately {{convert|7050000|km2}}. It gathers its waters from [[5th parallel north|5 degrees north latitude]] to [[20th parallel south|20 degrees south latitude]]. Its most remote sources are found on the inter-[[Andes|Andean]] plateau, just a short distance from the Pacific Ocean.

The Amazon River and its tributaries are characterized by extensive forested areas that become flooded every rainy season. Every year the river rises more than {{convert|9|m|ft}}, flooding the surrounding forests, known as ''[[Freshwater swamp forest|várzea]]'' (&quot;flooded forests&quot;). The Amazon's flooded forests are the most extensive example of this habitat type in the world.&lt;ref name=wwf&gt;{{cite web|title= Amazon River and Flooded Forests |publisher= [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] |url= http://www.nationalgeographic.com/wildworld/profiles/g200/g147.html |accessdate= 4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an average [[dry season]], {{convert|110000|km2}} of land are water-covered, while in the [[wet season]], the flooded area of the Amazon Basin rises to {{convert|350000|km2}}.&lt;ref name=guo&gt;{{Cite book|last= Guo |first= Rongxing |title= Territorial Disputes and Resource Management: A Global Handbook |year= 2006 |publisher= Nova |isbn= 9781600214455 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=z5Le627xQLgC&amp;pg=PA44 |page= 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantity of water released by the Amazon to the Atlantic Ocean is enormous: up to {{convert|300000|m3/s|cuft/s}} in the rainy season, with an average of  {{convert|209000|m3/s|cuft/s}} from 1973 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Molinier et al. http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_6/colloques2/42687.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Amazon is responsible for about 20% of the Earth's [[freshwater]] entering the ocean.&lt;ref name=wwf/&gt; The river pushes a vast plume of freshwater into the ocean. The plume is about {{convert|400|km|mi}} long and between {{convert|100|and|200|km|mi}} wide. The freshwater, being lighter, overrides the salty ocean, diluting the salinity and altering the color of the ocean surface over an area up to {{convert|1000000|sqmi|km2}} large. For centuries ships have reported freshwater near the Amazon's mouth yet well out of sight of land in what otherwise seemed to be the open ocean.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

The Atlantic has sufficient wave and tidal energy to carry most of the Amazon's sediments out to sea, thus the Amazon does not form a true delta. The great deltas of the world are all in relatively protected bodies of water while the Amazon empties directly into the turbulent Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Penn |first= James R. |title= Rivers of the World |year= 2001 |publisher= ABC-CLIO |isbn= 9781576070420 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=koacGt0fhUoC&amp;pg=PA8 |page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tidal bore]] is the reason the Amazon does not have a protruding [[river delta|delta]]; the ocean rapidly carries away the vast volume of [[silt]] carried by the Amazon, making it impossible for a delta to grow past the shoreline.

There is a natural water union between the Amazon and the [[Orinoco]] basins, the so-called [[Casiquiare canal]]. The Casiquiare is a river [[distributary]] of the upper Orinoco, which flows southward into the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]], which in turn flows into the Amazon. The Casiquiare is the largest river on the planet that links two major river systems, a so called bifurcation.

[[Image:The Source of the Amazon River.jpg|thumb|Source of the Amazon]]

The Amazon river has a series of major river systems in [[Colombia]], Ecuador and Peru, some of which flow into the [[Marañón River|Marañón]] and [[Ucayali River|Ucayali]], others directly into the Amazon proper. Among others, these include the following rivers: [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]], [[Caquetá]], [[Vaupés River|Vaupés]], [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Guainía]], [[Morona]], [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], [[Nucuray]], [[Urituyacu]], [[Chambira River|Chambira]], [[Tigre River|Tigre]], [[Nanay River|Nanay]], [[Napo River|Napo]], and [[Huallaga River|Huallaga]].

The most distant source of the Amazon was established in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palkiewicz.com/ekspedycje/index.php?p=zrodl_amaz |title=Source of the Amazon River Identificated (Jacek Palkiewicz) |publisher=Palkiewicz.com |date=19 November 1999 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2000/12/1221amazon.html |title=Explorers Pinpoint Source of the Amazon (National Geographic News) |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=21 December 2000 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2007,&lt;ref name=bbc-amazon&gt;{{cite news|title= Amazon river 'longer than Nile' |publisher= BBC News |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6759291.stm |accessdate= 3 August 2010 | date=16 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2008,&lt;ref name=inpe&gt;{{cite web|title= Studies from INPE indicate that the Amazon River is 140&amp;nbsp;km longer than the Nile |publisher= Brazilian National Institute for Space Research |url= http://www.inpe.br/ingles/news/news_dest29.php |accessdate= 3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a glacial stream on a snowcapped {{convert|5597|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}} peak called [[Nevado Mismi]] in the Peruvian [[Andes]], roughly {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} west of [[Lake Titicaca]] and {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} southeast of [[Lima]]. The waters from Nevado Mismi flow into the Quebradas [[Carhuasanta]] and Apacheta, which flow into the [[Apurímac River|Río Apurímac]] which is a tributary of the [[Ucayali River|Ucayali]] which later joins the [[Marañón River|Marañón]] to form the Amazon proper. While the Ucayali–Marañón confluence is the point at which most geographers place the beginning of the Amazon proper, in Brazil the river is known at this point as the ''[[Solimões]] das Águas''. Shortly downriver from that confluence the darkly colored waters of the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] meet the sandy colored [[Solimões|Rio Solimões]], and for over {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} these waters run side by side without mixing.

After the confluence of [[Apurímac River|Río Apurímac]] and [[Ucayali River|Ucayali]], the river leaves Andean terrain and is instead surrounded by [[floodplain]]. From this point to the [[Marañón River|Marañón]], some {{convert|1600|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}}, the forested banks are just out of water, and are inundated long before the river attains its maximum flood stage. The low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills, and the river enters the enormous [[Amazon Rainforest]].

The river systems and flood plains in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela, whose waters drain into the ''Solimões'' and its tributaries are called the &quot;Upper Amazon&quot;.
The Amazon River proper runs mostly through Brazil and Peru, it is part of the border between Colombia and Perú, and it has tributaries reaching into Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Bolivia.

==Flooding==
 [[Image:Amazon-river-NASA.jpg|thumb|A [[NASA]] satellite image of a flooded portion of the river.]] Not all of the Amazon's tributaries flood at the same time of the year. Many branches begin flooding in November, and may continue to rise until June. The rise of the Rio Negro starts in February or March, and begins to recede in June. The Madeira River rises and falls two months earlier than most of the rest of the Amazon.

The average depth of the Amazon between [[Manacapuru]] and [[Óbidos, Brazil|Óbidos]] has been calculated as between {{convert|20|to|26|m|ft}}. At Manacapuru the Amazon's water level is only about {{convert|24|m|ft}} above [[Sea level|mean sea level]]. More than half of the water in the Amazon downstream of Manacapuru is below sea level.&lt;ref name=junk&gt;{{Cite book|last= Junk |first= Wolfgang J. |title= The Central Amazon Floodplain: Ecology of a Pulsing System |year= 1997 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 9783540592761 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=1eMWTwL4rbEC&amp;pg=PA44 |page= 44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its lowermost section the Amazon's depth averages {{convert|20|to|50|m|ft}}, in some places as much as {{convert|100|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=whitton&gt;{{Cite book|last= Whitton |first= B.A. |title= River Ecology |year= 1975 |publisher= University of California Press |isbn= 9780520030169 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=q5H_1PtdvrAC&amp;pg=PA462 |page= 462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main river is navigable for large ocean steamers to [[Manaus]], {{convert|1500|km|mi|abbr=off|lk=off}} upriver from the mouth. Smaller ocean vessels of 3,000 tons or 9,000 tons&lt;ref name=encarta/&gt; and {{convert|5.5|m|ft|abbr=off|lk=off}} [[Draft (hull)|draft]] can reach as far as [[Iquitos]], Peru, {{convert|3600|km|mi|abbr=off|lk=off}} from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach {{convert|780|km|mi|abbr=off|lk=off}} higher as far as [[Actual Point]]. Beyond that, small boats frequently ascend to the [[Pongo de Manseriche]], just above Achual Point.

==Geography==
[[Image:Manaus Encontro das aguas 10 2006 103 8x6.jpg|thumb|left|[[Meeting of Waters]] is the [[confluence]] of the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] (black) and the [[Solimões|Rio Solimões]] (sandy) near [[Manaus]], Brazil.]]

At some points the river divides into [[anabranch]]s, or multiple channels, often very long, with inland and lateral [[Stream channel|channels]], all connected by a complicated system of natural canals, cutting the low, flat ''igapó'' lands, which are never more than {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=off|lk=off}} above low river, into many islands.

From the town of Canaria at the great bend of the Amazon to the Negro, only very low land is found, resembling that at the mouth of the river.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Vast areas of land in this region are submerged at high water, above which only the upper part of the trees of the sombre forests appear. Near the mouth of the Rio Negro to Serpa, nearly opposite the river Madeira, the banks of the Amazon are low, until approaching Manaus, they rise to become rolling hills. At Óbidos, a bluff {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}} above the river is backed by low hills. The lower Amazon seems to have once been a [[Headlands and bays|gulf]] of the Atlantic Ocean, the waters of which washed the cliffs near Óbidos.

Only about ten percent of the Amazon's water enters downstream of Óbidos, very little of which is from the northern slope of the valley. The drainage area of the Amazon Basin above Óbidos city is about {{convert|5000000|km2|sqmi}}, and, below, only about {{convert|1000000|km2|sqmi}} (around 20%), exclusive of the {{convert|1400000|km2|sqmi}} of the Tocantins basin. The [[Tocantins River]] enters the Amazon very close to its mouth.

In the lower reaches of the river, the north bank consists of a series of steep, table-topped hills extending for about {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=off|lk=off}} from opposite the mouth of the Xingu as far as [[Monte Alegre, Pará|Monte Alegre]]. These hills are cut down to a kind of [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] which lies between them and the river.

On the south bank, above the Xingu, an almost-unbroken line of low bluffs bordering the floodplain extends nearly to [[Santarém, Brazil|Santarém]] in a series of gentle curves before they bend to the southwest, and, abutting upon the lower Tapajós, merge into the bluffs which form the terrace margin of the Tapajós river valley.

==Mouth==
[[File:Amazon-river-delta-NASA.jpg|thumb|A satellite image of the mouth of the Amazon River, looking south]]
The definition of where exactly the mouth of the Amazon is located, and how wide it is, a matter of dispute, because of the area's peculiar geography. The Pará and the Amazon are connected by a series of river channels called ''furos'' near the town of [[Breves, Brazil|Breves]]; between them lies [[Marajó]], an island almost the size of Switzerland that is the world's largest combined river/sea island.

If the Pará river and the Marajó island ocean frontage are included, the Amazon [[estuary]] is some {{convert|325|km|mi|abbr=off|lk=off}} wide.&lt;ref name=guo/&gt; In this case, the width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from [[Cable Note]], in the Brazilian state of [[Amapá]], to Ponta da Tijoca near the town of [[Curuçá]], in the state of [[Pará]]. By this criterion, the Amazon is wider at its mouth than the entire length of the [[River Thames]] in England.

A more conservative measurement excluding the Pará river estuary, from the mouth of the [[Araguari River (Amapá)|Araguari River]] to Ponta do Navio on the northern coast of Marajó, would still give the mouth of the Amazon a width of over {{convert|180|km|mi|abbr=off|lk=off}}. If only the river's main channel is considered, between the islands of Curuá (state of Amapá) and Jurupari (state of Pará), the width falls to about {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=off|lk=off}}.

==Wildlife==
[[Image:Piranha1.jpg|thumb|[[Characin]]s, such as the [[piranha]] species, are prey for the [[Giant Otter]], but these aggressive fish may also pose a danger to humans.]]

More than one-third of all species in the world live in the Amazon Rainforest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:20757099~pagePK:64257043~piPK:437376~theSitePK:4607,00.html |title=Amazon rainforest fact sheet |publisher=Web.worldbank.org |date=15 December 2005 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a giant tropical forest and river basin with an area that stretches more than {{convert|5400000|km2|sqmi}}.

Along with the [[Orinoco]], the Amazon is one of the main habitats of the ''[[boto]]'', also known as the [[Amazon River Dolphin]] (''Inia geoffrensis''). It is the largest species of river dolphin, and it can grow to lengths of up to {{convert|2.6|m|ft}}. The color of its skin changes with age. It varies from gray when it is young, to pink and white as it matures. The dolphins use sonar to navigate and hunt in the river's tricky depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazon River Dolphin|url=http://rainforest-alliance.org/kids/species-profiles/river-dolphin|publisher=Rainforest Alliance|accessdate=3/20/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''boto'' is the subject of a very famous legend in Brazil about a dolphin that turns into a man and seduces maidens by the riverside. The [[tucuxi]] (''Sotalia fluviatilis''), also a dolphin species, is found both in the rivers of the Amazon Basin and in the coastal waters of South America.

The [[Amazonian Manatee]] (Trichechus inunguis) also known as “seacow” is found in the northern Amazon River Basin and its tributaries. It is a mammal and a herbivore. Its population is limited to fresh water habitats and unlike other manatees, they do not venture into salt water. It is classified as vulnerable by the [[IUCN]].

The Amazon and its tributaries are the main habitat of the [[Giant Otter]] (Pteronura brasiliensis). The giant otter is a member of the weasel family and is the largest of its kind. Because of habitat destruction and hunting its population has dramatically decreased.

Also present in large numbers is the notorious [[piranha]], a carnivorous fish which congregates in large schools, and may attack livestock and even humans. There are approximately from 30 to 60 species of piranha. However, only a few of its species are known to attack humans, most notably ''[[Pygocentrus nattereri]]'', the Red-bellied Piranha.

The [[bull shark]] (''Carcharhinus leucas'') has been reported {{convert|4000|km|mi}} up the Amazon River at [[Iquitos]] in Peru. The [[arapaima]], known in Brazil as the ''pirarucu'' (''[[Arapaima gigas]]''), is a South American tropical [[freshwater fish]]. It is one of the largest freshwater fish in the world, reportedly with a maximum length in excess of {{convert|4.5|m|ft}} and weight up to {{convert|200|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/07/070724-giant-fish.html Megafishes Project to Size Up Real &quot;Loch Ness Monsters&quot;]. ''National Geographic''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Amazonian freshwater fish is the [[arowana]] (or ''aruanã'' in Portuguese), such as the [[Silver arowana]] (''[[Osteoglossum bicirrhosum]]''), which is also a predator and very similar to the arapaima, but only reaches a length of maximum {{convert|120|cm}}. The [[candirú]] are a number of genera of parasitic, freshwater [[catfish]] in the family ''[[Trichomycteridae]]''; all are native to the Amazon River.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[electric eel]] (''Electrophorus electricus'') is also found in the river.

The [[anaconda]] snake is found in shallow waters in the Amazon Basin. One of the world's largest species of snake, the anaconda spends most of its time in the water, with just its nostrils above the surface. In addition to the thousands of species of fish, the river supports crabs, algae, and turtles.

==Colonial encounters==
{{See also|Timeline of Amazon history}}
During what many [[archaeologist]]s call the ''formative period'', Amazonian societies were deeply involved in the emergence of South America's highland [[agriculture|agrarian]] systems, and possibly contributed directly to the social and religious fabric constitutive of the [[Andean]] civilizational orders.

In 1500, [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzón]] was the first European to sail into the river.&lt;ref name=Morison1974&gt;{{Cite book

For 350 years after the first European encounter of the Amazon by Pinzón, the Portuguese portion of the basin remained an untended former food gathering and planned agricultural landscape occupied by the [[indigenous peoples]] who survived the arrival of European diseases. There is ample evidence for complex large-scale, pre-Columbian social formations, including [[chiefdom]]s, in many areas of Amazonia (particularly the inter-fluvial regions) and even large towns and cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Mann, C, C., ed. | title=1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus | publisher=University of Texas | year=2005 | isbn=1400032059 |page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance the pre-Columbian culture on the island of [[Marajó]] may have developed [[social stratification]] and supported a population of 100,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author=Mann, C, C., ed. | title=1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus | publisher=University of Texas | year=2005 | isbn=1400032059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Native Americans of the Amazon rain forest may have used [[Terra preta]] to make the land suitable for the large scale agriculture needed to support large populations and complex social formations such as chiefdoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann&quot; /&gt;

One of [[Gonzalo Pizarro]]'s lieutenants, [[Francisco de Orellana]], set off in 1541 to explore east of [[Quito]] into the South American interior in search of [[El Dorado]] and the &quot;Country of [[Cinnamon]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/431769/Francisco-de-Orellana Francisco de Orellana (Spanish explorer and soldier)]. Encyclopedia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordered to follow the [[Coca River]] and return when the river reached its confluence. After 170&amp;nbsp;km, the Coca River joined the [[Napo River]] (at a point now known as Puerto Francisco de Orellana), and his men threatened to mutiny if he followed his orders and the expedition turned back. On 26 December 1541, he accepted to change the purpose of the expedition to the conquest of new lands in the name of the King of Spain, and the 49 men built a larger boat in which to navigate downstream. After a journey of 600&amp;nbsp;km down the Napo River, constantly threatened by the [[Cambeba|Omaguas]], they reached a further major confluence, at a point near modern [[Iquitos]], and then followed what is now known as the Amazon River for a further 1200&amp;nbsp;km to its confluence with the Rio Negro (near modern [[Manaus]]), which they reached on 3 June 1542. This area around the Amazon was dominated by the Icamiaba natives, who were mistaken for fierce female warriors by the members of the expedition.  Orellana later narrated the belligerent victory of the Icamiaba “women” over the Spanish invaders to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], who, recalling the [[Amazons]] of Greek mythology, baptized the river Amazonas, the name by which it is still known in both Spanish and Portuguese. At the time, however, the river was referred to by the expedition as Grande Río (&quot;Great River&quot;), Mar Dulce (&quot;Freshwater Sea&quot;) or Río de la Canela (&quot;Cinnamon River&quot;).  Orellana claimed that he had found great cinnamon trees there, in other words a source of one of the most important spices reaching Europe from the East. In fact, true cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum) is not native to South America. Other related cinnamon-containing plants (of the family Lauraceae) do occur  and Orellana must have observed some of these.  The expedition continued a further 1200&amp;nbsp;km to the mouth of the Amazon, which it reached on 24 August 1542, demonstrating the practical navigability of the Great River. This was surely one of the most improbably successful voyages in known history.
[[File:Indios munduruku.jpg|thumb|Mundurukú Indians. Painted by [[Hercules Florence]]]]
In 1560 another Spanish [[conquistador]], [[Lope de Aguirre]], made the second descent of the Amazon.

In 1637–47 the Portuguese explorer [[Pedro Teixeira]] was the first European to ascend the river from Belém, near the mouth, to [[Quito]], part of the Spanish [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], and then to return the same way. Teixeira's expedition was massive—some 2000 people in 37 large canoes. From 1648 to 1652, [[António Raposo Tavares]] lead one of the longest known expeditions from [[São Paulo]] to the mouth of the Amazon, investigating many of its tributaries, including the Rio Negro, and covering a distance of more than {{convert|10000|km|0|abbr=on}}.

In what is currently Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, a number of [[colonization|colonial]] and religious settlements were established along the banks of primary rivers and tributaries for the purpose of trade, slaving and evangelization among the indigenous peoples of the vast rain forest, such as the [[Urarina]]. [[Samuel Fritz|Father Fritz]], apostle of the Omaguas, established some forty mission villages. [[Charles Marie de La Condamine]] accomplished the first scientific exploration of the Amazon River. 

Many indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare. According to James Stuart Olson, &quot;The [[Munduruku]] expansion dislocated and displaced the Kawahib, breaking the tribe down into much smaller groups...

The [[Cabanagem]], one of the bloodiest regional wars ever in Brazil, which was chiefly directed against the white ruling class, reduced the population of [[Pará]] from about 100,000 to 60,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/licaodecasa/materias/fundamental/historia/brasil/ult1689u20.jhtm|title=Cabanagem (1835–1840): Uma das mais sangrentas rebeliões do período regencial|work=[[Universo Online]] Liçao de Casa|author=Renato Cancian|accessdate=12 November 2007|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total population of the Brazilian portion of the Amazon Basin in 1850 was perhaps 300,000, of whom about two-thirds comprised by Europeans and slaves, the slaves amounting to about 25,000. The Brazilian Amazon's principal commercial city, Pará (now Belém), had from 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants, including slaves. The town of Manáos, now Manaus, at the mouth of the Rio Negro, had a population between 1,000 to 1,500. All the remaining villages, as far up as [[Tabatinga]], on the Brazilian frontier of Peru, were relatively small.

==Post-colonial history==
[[Image:Naturalist on the River Amazons figure 32.png|thumb|170px|[[Henry Walter Bates]] was most famous for his expedition to the Amazon (1848–1859).]]

On 6 September 1850 the emperor, [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], sanctioned a law authorizing steam navigation on the Amazon, and gave the Viscount of Mauá ([[Irineu Evangelista de Sousa]]) the task of putting it into effect. He organized the &quot;Companhia de Navegação e Comércio do Amazonas&quot; in Rio de Janeiro in 1852; and in the following year it commenced operations with three small steamers, the ''Monarch'', the ''Marajó'' and ''Rio Negro''.

At first, navigation was principally confined to the main river; and even in 1857 a modification of the government contract only obliged the company to a monthly service between Pará and Manaus, with steamers of 200 tons cargo capacity, a second line to make six round voyages a year between Manaus and Tabatinga, and a third, two trips a month between Pará and Cametá. This was the first step in opening up the vast interior.

The success of the venture called attention to the opportunities for economic exploitation of the Amazon, and a second company soon opened commerce on the Madeira, Purus and Negro; a third established a line between Pará and Manaus; and a fourth found it profitable to navigate some of the smaller streams. In that same period, the Amazonas Company was increasing its fleet. Meanwhile, private individuals were building and running small steam craft of their own on the main river as well as on many of its tributaries.

On 31 July 1867 the government of Brazil, constantly pressed by the maritime powers and by the countries encircling the [[upper Amazon]] basin, especially [[Peru]], decreed the opening of the Amazon to all flags; but limited this to certain defined points: Tabatinga – on the Amazon; Cametá – on the Tocantins; Santarém – on the Tapajós; Borba – on the Madeira, and Manaus – on the Rio Negro. The Brazilian decree took effect on 7 September 1867.

Thanks in part to the [[mercantile]] development associated with [[steamboat]] navigation, coupled with the internationally driven demand for [[natural rubber]] (1880–1920), Manáos (now Manaus) and Pará (now Belém) in (Brazil), and [[Iquitos]], Peru became thriving, cosmopolitan centers of commerce and spectacular—albeit illusory—&quot;modern&quot; &quot;urban growth&quot;. This was particularly the case for Iquitos during its late 19th and early 20th century ''Rubber Bonanza'' zenith when this dynamic boomtown was known abroad as the [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] of the Amazon. Foreign companies settled in this city, from where they controlled the extraction of rubber. In 1851 Iquitos had a population of 200 and by 1900 its population reached 20,000.  In the 1860s, approximately 3,000 tons of rubber was being exported annually and by 1911 annual exports had grown to 44,000 tons, representing 9.3% of Peru’s exports.&lt;ref&gt;Historia del Peru, Editorial Lexus. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[rubber boom]] it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants such as [[typhus]] or [[malaria]] killed 40,000 native Amazonians.&lt;ref&gt;La Republica Oligarquica.  Editorial Lexus 2000 p. 925&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first direct foreign trade with Manaus was commenced around 1874. Local trade along the river was carried on by the English successors to the Amazonas Company—the Amazon Steam Navigation Company—as well as numerous small steamboats, belonging to companies and firms engaged in the rubber trade, navigating the Negro, Madeira, Purus and many other tributaries, such as the Marañón to ports as distant as [[Nauta]], Peru. The Amazon Steam Navigation Company had 38 vessels.

By the turn of the 20th century, the principal exports of the Amazon Basin were [[Natural rubber|India-rubber]], [[cacao bean]]s, [[Brazil nut]]s and a few other products of minor importance, such as [[Fur|pelts]] and ''exotic'' forest produce ([[resin]]s, barks, woven [[hammock]]s, prized bird [[feather]]s, live animals, etc.) and extracted goods ([[lumber]], gold, etc.).

==20th and 21st century concerns==
[[Image:Manaus-Amazon-NASA.jpg|thumb|[[Manaus]], the largest city in [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], as seen from a [[NASA]] satellite image, surrounded by the dark [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] and the muddy Amazon River.]]

Four centuries after the European discovery of the Amazon river, the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than {{convert|65|km2}}, excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters. This situation changed dramatically during the 20th century.

Wary of foreign exploitation of the nation's resources, Brazilian governments in the 1940s set out to develop the interior, away from the seaboard, where foreigners owned large tracts of land. The original architect of this expansion was President [[Getúlio Vargas]], with the demand for rubber from the Allied forces in World War II providing funding for the drive.

In 1960, the construction of the new capital city of [[Brasília]] in the interior also contributed to the opening up of the Amazon Basin. A large-scale colonization program saw families from Northeastern Brazil relocated to the forests, encouraged by promises of cheap land. Many settlements grew along the road from Brasilia to Belém, but rainforest soil proved difficult to cultivate.

Still, long-term development plans continued. Roads were cut through the forests, and in 1970, the work on the [[Trans-Amazonian highway]] (''Transamazônica'') network began. The network's three pioneering highways were completed within ten years, but never fulfilled their promise. Large portions of the Trans-Amazonian and its accessory roads, such as [[Brazilian Highway System#BR-319|BR-319]] (Manaus-[[Porto Velho]]), are derelict and impassable in the rainy season. Small towns and villages are scattered across the forest and because its vegetation is so dense, some remote areas are still unexplored.

With a current population of 1.8&amp;nbsp;million people, Manaus is the Amazon’s largest city. Manaus alone represents approximately 50% of the population of the Brazilian state of Amazonas, which is the largest state. The racial makeup of the city is 64% [[Pardo]] (Mulatto and mestizo) and 32% [[White Brazilian|White]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/listabl.asp?z=cd&amp;o=7&amp;i=P&amp;c=2094|title=Síntese de Indicadores Sociais 2000|publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]|location=Manaus, Brazil|format=PDF|isbn=85-240-3919-1|accessdate=31 January 2009|year=2000|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispute regarding length==
While debate as to whether the Amazon or the Nile is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest. However, the Amazon has been measured by different geographers as being anywhere between {{convert|6259|and|6800|km|mi}} long. It is often said to be &quot;at least&quot; {{convert|6400|km|mi}} long.&lt;ref name=britannica-amazon&gt;{{cite web|title= Amazon River |publisher= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |year= 2010 |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/18722/Amazon-River |accessdate= 3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nile is reported to be anywhere from {{convert|5499|to|6690|km|mi}}. Often it is said to be &quot;about&quot; {{convert|6650|km|mi}} long.&lt;ref name=britannica-nile&gt;{{cite web|title= Nile River |publisher= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |year= 2010 |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/415347/Nile-River |accessdate= 3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many factors that can affect these measurements.

A study by Brazilian scientists concluded that the Amazon is actually longer than the Nile. Using [[Nevado Mismi]], which in 2001 was labeled by the [[National Geographic Society]] as the Amazon's source, these scientists made new calculations of the Amazon's length. They calculated the Amazon's length as {{convert|6992|km|mi}}. Using the same techniques they calculated the length of the Nile as {{convert|6853|km|mi}}, which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. They made it possible by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of ''Canal do Sul'' and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Marajó and finally including the marine Waters of the ''Río Pará'' bay in its entire length.&lt;ref name=inpe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/06/070619-amazon-river.html |title=Amazon Longer Than Nile River, Scientists Say |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guido Gelli]], director of science at the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE), told the Brazilian TV network [[Rede Globo|Globo]] in June 2007 that it could be considered as a fact that the Amazon was the longest river in the world. However, other geographers have had access to the same data since 2001, and a consensus has yet to emerge to support the claims of these Brazilian scientists. As of 2010 the length of both the Amazon and the Nile remains open to interpretation and continued debate.&lt;ref name=britannica-amazon/&gt;

==Major tributaries==
The Amazon has over 1,100 [[Tributary|tributaries]], 17 of which are over {{convert|1500|km}} long.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Sterling: ''Der Amazonas''. Time-Life Bücher 1979, 8th German Printing, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more notable ones are:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Alredus, or '''Alfred of Beverley''', ([[floruit|fl.]] 1143),  [[English historians in the Middle Ages|English chronicler]], was [[sacristan]] of the church of [[Beverley]] in the first half of the twelfth century.

He wrote, apparently about the year 1143, a [[chronicle]] entitled ''Annales sive Historia de gestis regum Britanniae'',  which begins with [[Brutus of Britain|Brutus]] and carries the history of England down to 1129.

[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] and [[Simeon of Durham]] are Alured's chief sources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autpert Ambrose (Ambroise)''' ({{lang-la|'''Ambrosius Autpertus'''}}) (ca. 730 – 784) was a [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Benedictine]] monk.

He became abbot of San Vicenzo on the Volturno in South Italy in the time of [[Desiderius]], king of the [[Lombards]].  Autpert's election as [[abbot]] caused internal dissent at St. Vicenzo, and both [[Pope Stephen III]] and [[Charlemagne]] intervened.  The disagreement was based both on objections to Autpert's personality and to his Frankish origin.

He wrote a considerable number of works on the Bible and religious subjects generally. Among these are commentaries on the [[Apocalypse]], on the [[Psalms]], and on the [[Song of Solomon]]; ''Lives of Saints Paldo, Tuto and Vaso''; ''[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] of the Virgin''; and a ''Combat between the Virtues and the Vices''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Ambrose, Autpert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] gave a homily about him in Saint Peter's square. In this homily, Autpert's death date is given as 784 (older scholarship had given a date between 778 and 779).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-25689?l=english On Ambrose Autpert, &quot;1st Mariologist of the West&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Abu Bakr (Abdullah ibn Abi Qahafa)''' ({{lang-ar-at|a= عبد الله بن أبي قحافة|t= 'Abdullāh bin Abī Quhāfah}}, c. 573 CE unknown exact date 634/13 AH) was a senior companion (''[[Sahabah]]'') and the father-in-law of the [[Islamic Prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. He ruled over the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] from 632-634 CE when he became the first Muslim [[Caliph]] following Muhammad's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;brit&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/2153/Abu-Bakr], from [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Caliph]], Abu Bakr succeeded to the political and administrative functions previously exercised by the Prophet, since the religious function and authority of prophethood ended with Muhammad's death according to [[Islam]]. He was called ''Al-Siddiq'' (The Truthful)&lt;ref name=&quot;Campo&quot;&gt;Juan Eduardo Campo, &quot;Encyclopedia of Islam&quot;, Infobase Publishing, 2009 ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]''&lt;/ref&gt; and was known by that title among later generations of Muslims.

As a young man, Abu Bakr became a cloth merchant and he traveled extensively in Arabia and neighboring lands in the Middle East, through which he gained both wealth and experience. He eventually came to be recognized as the chief of his clan.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1991&quot;&gt;The ''[[Middle East Journal]]'' by the [[Middle East Institute]], [[Washington, D.C.]], published 1991&lt;/ref&gt; On his return from a business trip to [[Yemen]], he was informed that in his absence [[Muhammad]] had openly declared his prophethood. Not long after, Abu Bakr accepted Islam and was the first person outside the family of Muhammad to openly become a [[Muslim]]. He was instrumental in the conversion of many people to the Islamic faith&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashraf&quot;&gt;Shahid Ashraf, &quot;Encyclopaedia of Holy Prophet and Companions&quot;, Anmol Publications PVT. LTD., 2004, ISBN 81-261-1940-3 ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=j6ErUIqzyKoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]''&lt;/ref&gt; and early in 623, Abu Bakr's daughter Aisha was married to Muhammad, strengthening the ties between the two men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campo&quot; /&gt;

Abu Bakr served as a trusted advisor and close friend to the Prophet. During the lifetime of Muhammad, he was involved in several campaigns such as the [[Battle of Uhud]], the [[Battle of the Trench]], the [[Invasion of Banu Qurayza]], [[Battle of Khaybar]], the [[Conquest of Mecca]], the [[Battle of Hunayn]], the [[Siege of Ta'if]], and the [[Battle of Tabuk]] where he was reported to have given all of his wealth for the preparation of this expedition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maghazi&quot;&gt;Tabqat ibn al-Saad book of Maghazi, page no:62&lt;/ref&gt; He also participated in the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]] and was made one of the witnesses over the pact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maghazi&quot;/&gt; 

In 631, three months after completing his [[Farewell Pilgrimage]] to Mecca, the Prophet became fatally ill. After his death Abu Bakr became the first Muslim [[Caliph]]. During his rule, he defeated the rebellion of several Arab tribes in a successful campaign, unifying the entire Arabian peninsula and giving it stability.&lt;ref name=blewis/&gt; This enabled him to launch successful campaigns against the [[Sassanid Empire]] (Persian Empire) and the [[East Roman Empire]] (Byzantine Empire) who were threatening Arabia's borders. Prior to dispatching his army to Syria against the Romans he gave them the following commands which established the conduct of war for later Muslim generations: {{quote|Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not kill a young woman. Bring no harm to the trees which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save it for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Muwatta]]; Book 21, Number 21.3.10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zuhur&gt;Aboul-Enein, H. Yousuf and Zuhur, Sherifa, ''Islamic Rulings on Warfare'', p. 22, Strategic Studies Institute, US Army War College, Diane Publishing Co., Darby PA, ISBN 1-4289-1039-5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Abu Bakr's Caliphate lasted for a little over two years (or 27 months), ending with his death after an illness. Though the period of his caliphate was not long it included successful invasions of the two most powerful empires of the time, a remarkable achievement in its own right. He set in motion a historical trajectory that in few decades would lead to one of the largest empires in history.

==Lineage and title==
Abu Bakr's full name is 'Abd Allah ibn 'Uthman ibn Aamir ibn Amr ibn Ka'ab ibn Sa'ad ibn Tamim ibn Murrah ibn Ka'ab ibn Lu'ai ibn Ghalib ibn Fihr al-Quraishi at-Tamimi.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Book of the Major Classes|Tabaqat ibn Sa'd]] 3/ 169&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Arabic]], the name 'Abd Allah' means (servant of God). Although he is most known by his title 'Abu Bakr', he has many other titles. One of his titles was 'atiqe' (the saved one) and he was known by this title before Islam. Muhammad confirmed this title later when he said that Abu Bakr is the 'atiqe' (the one saved from hell fire by God).&lt;ref&gt;Abi Na'eem, &quot;Ma'arifat al-sahaba&quot;, no. 60&lt;/ref&gt; He was called 'Al-Siddiq' (the truthful')&lt;ref name=&quot;Campo&quot;/&gt; by the Prophet after he believed him in the event of [[Isra and Mi'raj]] when other people didn't, and [[Ali]] confirmed that title several times.&lt;ref&gt;Abi Na'eem, &quot;Ma'arifat al-sahaba&quot;, no. 64, 65&lt;/ref&gt;

He was mentioned in the [[Quran]] as the &quot;second of the two who lay in the cave&quot; in reference to the event of [[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]], with the Prophet Muhammad where they hid in the cave in [[Jabal Thawr]] from the [[Mecca]]n search party that was sent after them, thus being one of few who were given direct reference to in the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Glassé, Huston Smith, &quot;The new encyclopedia of Islam&quot;, Rowman Altamira, 2003, ISBN 0-7591-0190-6 ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=focLrox-frUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Imam Jafar al Sadiq famously narrated how the title ''Siddiq'' was given to Abu Bakr from Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;''The divine guide in early Shi'ism: the sources of esotericism in Islam'' by Mohammad Ali Amir-Moezzi, SUNY Press, 1994, p95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Classical Islam and the Naqshbandi Sufi Tradition By Muhammad Hisham Kabbani, ISCA, 2003, p124&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a direct descendant of Abu Bakr from his maternal side, as well as being a paternal descendant of [[Ali]] from his father's side. Jafar al-Sadiq was also the successor of the [[Naqshbandi]] Sufi order originating from Abu Bakr himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Classical Islam and the Naqshbandi Sufi Tradition'' by Muhammad Hisham Kabbani, ISCA, 2003, p.iv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Naqshbandiyya: orthodoxy and activism in a worldwide Sufi tradition'' by Itzchak Weismann, 2007, p24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Shadows of the Prophet: Martial Arts and Sufi Mysticism'' by D. S. Farrer, 2009, p273&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Islamic Sufism'' by Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah, Tractus Books, 2000, p104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Naqshbandiyya: orthodoxy and activism in a worldwide Sufi tradition'' by Itzchak Weismann, Routledge, 2007, p24&lt;/ref&gt;

Imam Muhammad al Baqir, the father of Imam Jafar Sadiq also called Abu Bakr with the title Siddiq.&lt;ref&gt;''Kashf al-Ghumma'' Abu al-Hasan al-Irbili, vol 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Abu Bakr was born in Mecca some time in 573 CE, to a rich family in the [[Banu Tamim]] branch of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] tribe. Abu Bakr's father's name was [[Uthman Abu Qahafa]] (nicknamed ''Abu Quhafa'') and his mother was [[Salma Umm-ul-Khair]] (nicknamed ''Umm-ul-Khair''). Abu Bakr was a thin man with white skin.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Book of the Major Classes|Tabaqat ibn Sa'd]] 3/ 188&lt;/ref&gt; Tabari relates ([[Suyuti]] also relates the same through [[Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi]]'s report) from [[Aisha]] her description of Abu Bakr:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He was a man with fair skin, thin, emaciated, with a sparse beard, a slightly hunched frame, sunken eyes and protruding forehead, and the bases of his fingers were hairless.&lt;ref&gt;[[History of the Prophets and Kings|Tarikh ar-Rusul wa al-Muluk]] 3/ 524&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He spent his early childhood like other [[Arab]] children of the time among the [[Bedouin]]s who called themselves ''Ahl-i-Ba'eer''- the people of the [[camel]], and developed a particular fondness for camels. In his early years he played with the camel foals and goats, and his love for camels earned him the nickname &quot;''Abu Bakr''&quot;, the father of the [[foal]] of the camel.&lt;ref&gt;''War and Peace in the Law of Islam'' by [[Majid Khadduri]]. Translated by Muhammad Yaqub Khan Published 1951 Ahmadiyyah Anjuman Ishaat Islam. Original from the [[University of Michigan]]. Digitized 23 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

When Abu Bakr was 10 years old, he went to Syria along with his father with the merchants' [[Camel train|caravan]]. Muhammad, who was 12 years old at the time, was also with the caravan. In 591 at the age of 18, Abu Bakr went into trade and adopted the profession of cloth merchant, which was the family's business. In the coming years Abu Bakr traveled extensively with caravans. Business trips took him to [[Yemen]], Syria, and elsewhere. These travels brought him wealth and added to his experience. His business flourished and he rose in the scale of social importance. Though his father, Uthman Abu Quhafa, was still alive, he came to be recognized as chief of his tribe. Abu Bakr was assigned the office of awarding [[Blood money (term)|blood money]] in cases of murder. His office was something like the office of an honorary [[magistrate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1991&quot;/&gt;

Like other children of the rich Meccan merchant families, Abu Bakr was literate and developed a fondness for [[Arabic poetry|poetry]]. He used to attend the annual fair at [[Sha'ir|Ukaz]], and participate in poetical symposia. He had a very good memory and had a good knowledge of the [[genealogy]] of the Arab tribes, their stories and their [[politics]].&lt;ref&gt;Al-zarkali, &quot;al-a'alam&quot;, dar al'ilm lil'malayeen, 15th edition, may 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acceptance of Islam===
On his return from a business trip from [[Yemen]], he was informed by friends that in his absence Muhammad had declared himself the Messenger of God, and proclaimed a new religion. Abu Bakr was the first ''[[baligh]]'' (post-puberty) [[Islam and slavery|free male]] to accept Muhammad's prophethood (though Shias maintain Abu Talib and other adult members of Muhammad's immediate blood family were, i.e. the Hashemites). Scholars, as well as other Sunnis and all Shi'a Muslims maintain that the second person (and first male) to publicly accept Muhammed as the messenger of Allah was [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]], though to Shias Ali always knew of Muhammad's status through pre-knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;M. Th. Houtsma et al., eds., ''E.J. Brill's first [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', 1913-1936,'' Leiden: E. J. Brill, 8 vols. with Supplement (vol. 9), 1991. ISBN 90-04-09796-1&lt;/ref&gt; However, 'Ali was still a pre-pubescent child when he accepted Islam, and therefore may have been excluded from the duties of a Muslim. Also Abu Bakr was the first person outside the family of Muhammad to openly become a [[Muslim]].

===Life after accepting Islam===
{{Sunni Islam}}
His wife [[Qutaylah bint Abd-al-Uzza]] did not accept Islam and he divorced her. His other wife, [[Um Ruman]], became a Muslim. All his children except [[Abdu'l-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr‎]] accepted Islam, and Abu Bakr separated from his son Abdu'l-Rahman.

His conversion brought the most benefit to Islam. Abu Bakr's brought many people to Islam. He persuaded his intimate friends to convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Bidayah wa al-Nihayah|al-Bidayah wa'an-Nihayah]] 3/26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Merriam-Webster]]'s ''Encyclopedia of World Religions'' by Wendy Doniger ISBN 978-0877790440&lt;/ref&gt; and presented Islam to others in such a way that many of his friends accepted Islam.

Those who converted to Islam at the instance of Abu Bakr were:&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashraf&quot; /&gt;
* [[Uthman Ibn Affan]] (who would became the 3rd Caliph)
* [[Al-Zubayr]] (played a part in the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]])
* [[Talhah|Talha Ibn Ubayd-Allah]]
* [[Abdur Rahman bin Awf]] (who would remain an important part of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]])
* [[Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas]] (played a part in the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]])
* Umar ibn Masoan
* [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah]] (who remained commander in chief of the [[Rashidun army]] in Syria )
* Abdullah bin Abdul Asad
* Abu Salama
* [[Khalid ibn Sa`id]]
* [[Abu Hudhaifah ibn al-Mughirah]]

Abu Bakr's acceptance proved to be a milestone in Muhammad's mission. [[Slavery]] was common in Mecca, and many slaves accepted Islam. When an ordinary free man accepted Islam, despite opposition, he would enjoy the protection of his tribe. For slaves however, there was no such protection and they commonly experienced persecution. Abu Bakr felt compassion for slaves, so he purchased eight slaves(four men and four women) and then freed them, paying 40,000 [[dinar]] for their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Book of the Major Classes|Tabaqat ibn Sa'd]] 3/ 169, 174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[History of the Prophets and Kings|Tarikh ar-Rusul wa al-Muluk]] 3/ 426&lt;/ref&gt;

The men were
* [[Bilal ibn Ribah]]
* [[Abu Fakih]]
* [[Ammar ibn Yasir]]
* [[Abu Fuhayra]]
The women were:
* [[Lubaynah]]
* [[Al-Nahdiah]]
* [[Umm Ubays]]
* [[Harithah bint al-Muammil]]

Most of the slaves liberated by Abu Bakr were either women or old and frail men.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mohammedan Dynasties: Chronological and Genealogical Tables with Historical Introductions (1894)'' by [[Stanley Lane-Poole]], published by Adamant Media Corporation ISBN 978-1402166662&lt;/ref&gt; The father of Abu Bakr asked him to for why doesn't he liberate strong and young slaves who could be a source of strength for him, Abu Bakr replied that he was freeing the slaves for the sake of [[Allah]], and not for his own sake. According to Sunni tradition the following verses of the [[Qur'an]] were revealed due to this:{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He who gives in charity and fears Allah And in all sincerity testifies to the Truth; We shall indeed make smooth for him the path of Bliss {92:5-7}.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Those who spend their wealth for increase in self-purification; And have in their minds no favor from any one For which a reward is expected in return, But only the desire to seek the Countenance, Of their Lord, Most High; And soon they shall attain complete satisfaction {92:8-21}.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shias maintain these verses were revealed about Ali.

===Persecution by the Quraysh, 613===
{{Main|Persecution of Muslims by the Meccans}}
For three years after the advent of Islam, Muslims kept secret their faith, and prayed in secret. In 613 Muhammad decided to call people to Islam openly. The first public address inviting people to offer allegiance to Muhammad was delivered by Abu Bakr.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In a fit of fury the young men of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] tribe rushed at Abu Bakr, and beat him mercilessly till he lost consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;''Abu Bakr'' by Atta Mohy-ud-Din, published 1968 S. Chand Original from the University of Michigan, digitized 6 January 2006, [[Amazon Standard Identification Number|ASIN]] B0006FFA0O.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this incident Abu Bakr's mother converted to Islam. Abu Bakr was persecuted many times by the Quraysh. Abu Bakr's beliefs would have been defended by his own clan, but not by the entire Quraysh tribe.

==Migrations to Abyssinia, 615==
Being the first man to go over to Islam, Abu Bakr had brought upon himself the special anger and hatred of the Meccan chiefs. Soon he felt hard pressed and asked permission of the Holy Prophet to go to Abyssinia. The permission was granted and Abu Bakr set off on his journey. However, on the way he met Ibn-ud-Daghinna, the chief of Qara. Under Ibn-ud-Daghinna's protection, he soon came back to Makkah.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Fazl Ahmed, ''Hazrat Abu Bakr'', New Delhi: Idara Ishaat-e-Diniyat, p.15. ISBN-8171010016&lt;/ref&gt;
==Last years in Mecca==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Abu Bakr.jpg|thumb|250px|Abu Bakr As-Siddique inscribed in Arabic on a plaque in the [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
In 617, the Quraysh enforced a boycott against the [[Banu Hashim]]. Muhammad along with his supporters from Banu Hashim, were shut up in a pass away from [[Mecca]]. All social relations with the Banu Hashim were cut off and their state was that of imprisonment. Before it many Muslims migrated to [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]] (now Ethiopia). Abu Bakr, feeling distressed, set out for Yemen and then to Abyssinia from there. He met a friend of his named Ad-Dughna (chief of the [[Qarah]]{{dn}} tribe) outside Mecca, who invited Abu Bakr to seek his protection against the Quraysh. Abu Bakr went back to Mecca, it was a relief for him, but soon due to the pressure of Quraysh, Ad-Dughna was forced to renounce his protection. Once again the Quraysh were free to persecute Abu Bakr.

In 620 Muhammad's wife and uncle died. Abu Bakr's daughter [[Aisha]] was engaged to Muhammad, however it was decided that the actual marriage ceremony would be held later. In 620 Abu Bakr was the first person to testify to Muhammad's [[Isra and Mi'raj]] (night Journey).&lt;ref&gt;''Islam (Exploring Religions)'' by Anne Geldart, published by [[Heinemann (book publisher)|Heinemann Library]], 28 September 2000. ISBN 978-0431093017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration to Medina==
{{Main|Hijra (Islam)}}
In 622, on the invitation of the Muslims of [[Medina]], Muhammad ordered Muslims to migrate to Medina. The migration began in batches. Ali was the last to remain in Mecca, entrusted with responsibility for settling any loans the Muslims had taken, and famously slept in the bed of Muhammad when the Quraysh led by Ikrima attempted to murder Muhammad as he slept. Meanwhile Abu Bakr accompanied Muhammad in his migration for Medina. Due to the danger of the Quraysh, they did not take the road to Medina. They moved in the opposite direction, and took refuge in a cave in [[Jabal Thawr]] some five miles south of Mecca. [[`Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr]], the son of Abu Bakr, would listen to the plans and talks of the Quraysh, and at night he would carry the news to the fugitives in the cave. [[Asma bint Abi Bakr]], the daughter of Abu Bakr, brought them meals every day.&lt;ref&gt;''Islamic Culture'' by the Islamic Cultural Board Published 1927 [s.n. Original from the University of Michigan, digitized 27 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Aamir, a servant of Abu Bakr, would bring a flock of goats to the mouth of the cave every night where they were milked. The Quraysh sent search parties in all directions. One party came close to the entrance to the cave, but was unable to sight them. Due to this the following verse of the [[Qur'an]] was revealed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If ye help not (your Leader) (it is no matter): for Allah did indeed help him; when the unbelievers drove him out: he had no more than one companion: they two were in the cave, and he said to his companion &quot;Have no Fear, for Allah is with us&quot;: then Allah sent down His peace upon him, and strengthened him with forces which ye saw not, and humbled to the depths the word of the Unbelievers. But the word of Allah is exalted to the heights: for Allah is Exalted in might, Wise. {{cite quran|9|40}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Aisha|'Aa'ishah]], [[Abu Sa`id al-Khudri|Abu Sa`eed al-Khudri]] and [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas|ibn 'Abbaas]] in [[Tafsir|interpreting]] this verse said
&lt;blockquote&gt;Abu Bakr was the one who stayed with the Prophet in that cave&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is narrated from [[Al-Bara' ibn `Azib|al-Barra' ibn 'Azib]], he said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Once Abu Bakr bought a ride from 'Azib for 10 Dirham, then Abu Bakr said to 'Azib, &quot;Tell your son the Barra to deliver that beast.&quot; Then 'Azib said, &quot;No, until you tell us about your journey with the Messenger of Allah when he went out of Makkah while the [[Shirk (Islam)|Mushrikeen]] were busy looking for you.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;We set out from Makkah, walking day and night, until it came the time of [[Dhuhr|Zuhr]], so I was looking for a place so that we can rest under it, it came to be that I saw a big rock, so I came to it and there was the place, so I spread a matress for the Prophet, then I said to him, &quot; Rest O' Prophet of Allah.&quot; So he rested, while I surveyed the area around me, are there people looking for us coming here to spy... Suddenly I saw there was a shepherd herding his sheep to the direction of the place under the rock wanting to shade himself like us, so I asked, &quot;Who is your master O' slave?&quot; He answered, &quot;Slave of the fulan, someone of the Quraish.&quot; He mentioned the name of his master and I knew him, then I asked, &quot;Does your sheep have milk?&quot; He answered, &quot;Yes!&quot; So he took one of the sheep, after that I ordered him to clean the breasts of the sheep first from dirt and dust, then I ordered him to blow his hand from dust, so he pat his two hands and he started milking, while I prepared a vessel with its mouth wrapped with cloth to contain the milk, so I poured the milk that was milked to the vessel and I waited until the bottom was cold, then I brought to the Prophet and it was that he had waken up, instantly I told him, &quot;Drink O' Messenger of Allah.&quot; So he started to drink until I saw that he was full, then I told him, &quot;Are we not going to continue walking O' Messenger of Allah?&quot; He answered, &quot;Yes!&quot; At last we continued the journey while the mushrikeen kept looking for us, not that could pursue us except [[Suraqa bin Malik|Suraqah ibn Malik ibn Ju'sham]] who rode his horse, so I said to the Messenger of Allah, &quot;This man has succeeded in pursuing us O' Messenger of Allah,&quot; but he answered, &quot;ﻻ ﺗﺤﺰ ﻥ ﺇ ﻥ ﺍﷲ ﻣﻌﻨﺎ&quot; (Do not worry, verily Allah is with us).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is narrated from [[Anas ibn Malik|Anas]] from Abu Bakr he said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I said to the Prophet when were in the cave, &quot;If only they had looked under their feet we would assuredly be seen&quot; The Messenger answered, &quot;ﻣﺎ ﻇﻨﻚ ﻳﺎ ﺃ ﺑﺎ ﺑﻜﺮ ﺑﺎ ﺛﻨﻴﻦ ﺍﷲ ﺛﺎ ﻟﺘﻬﻤﺎ&quot; (What do you think O' Abu Bakr about two people if Allah is the third, meaning God was with them.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Tahthib 2002 page 16&quot;&gt;Tartib wa Tahthib [[Kitab]] [[Al-Bidayah wa al-Nihayah|al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah]] by [[ibn Kathir]], published by Dar al-Wathan publications , Riyadh Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 1422 [[Islamic calendar|Anno hegiræ]] (2002) compiled by Dr. Muhammad ibn Shamil as-Sulami, page 16, ISBN 979-3407-19-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After staying at the cave for three days and three nights, Abu Bakr and Muhammad proceed to [[Medina]], staying for some time at Quba, a suburb of Medina. While Sunni sources portray Abu bakr in an exalted light in the cave, Shia sources however generally tend to portray the incident in the cave as a Quranic condemndation of Abu Bakr for cowardice and fear.

===Life in Medina===
{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad}}
In Medina, Muhammad decided to construct a [[mosque]]. A piece of land was chosen and the price of the land was paid for by Abu Bakr. Muslims constructed a mosque named [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] at the site and Abu Bakr also took part in construction. Abu Bakr was paired with Khaarij ah bin Zaid Ansari (who was from Medina) as a [[Brotherhood among the Sahaba|brother in faith]]. Abu Bakr's relationship with Khaarjah was most cordial, which was further strengthened when Abu Bakr married Habiba, a daughter of Khaarijah.

Khaarij ah bin Zaid Ansari used to live at Sukh, a suburb of Medina, and Abu Bakr also settled there. After Abu Bakr's family arrived in Medina he bought another house near Muhammad's.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hazrat]] ''Abu Bakr, the First Caliph of Islam'' by Muhammad Habibur Rahman Khan Sherwani, published 1963 Sh. Muhammad Ashraf. Original from the University of Michigan. Digitized 14 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate of Mecca was dry, but the climate of Medina was damp and this adversely affected the health of the immigrants, so that on arrival most of them fell sick. Abu Bakr also suffered from fever for several days and during this time he was attended to by Khaarijah and his family. At Mecca, Abu Bakr was a trader in cloth and he started the same business in Medina. He was a wholesaler, and had his store at Sukh, and from there cloth was supplied to the market at Medina. Soon his business flourished at Medina. Early in 623, Abu Bakr's daughter Aisha, who was already engaged to Muhammad, was handed over to Muhammad in a simple marriage ceremony, and this further strengthen the relation between Abu Bakr and Muhammad.

In 624 Abu Bakr was involved in the first battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh of Mecca, known as the [[Battle of Badr]], but did not fight, instead acting as one of the guards of Muhammad's tent. In 625 he participated in the [[Battle of Uhud]] which ended in a rout by the majority of the Muslims. Before the battle begun, Abu Bakr's son [[Abdu'l-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr]], who was still non-Muslim and was fighting from the side of the Quraysh, came forward and threw down a challenge for a duel. Abu Bakr accepted the challenge but was stopped by Muhammad. His son later converted to [[Islam]] and gained fame during the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]] as a fierce warrior. In the second phase of the battle, [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]]’s cavalry attacked the Muslims from behind, changing a Muslim victory to defeat. Many Muslim warriors were routed from the battlefield but in Sunni accounts Abu Bakr remained, guarding Muhammad from the attacks of the Quraysh soldiers, while Shia and many Sunni accounts dispute this. Shia criticisms of his lack-lustre military achievements in comparison with the genuinely accomplised Ali should be put into context: Abu Bakr was a middle aged man during these battles, was not a soldier but a merchant by trade, and had never seen battle before - it may thus be unfair to directly compare him with Ali in this regard. In Sunni accounts during one such attack, two discs from Abu Bakr's shield penetrated into Muhammad's cheeks. Abu Bakr went forward with the intention of extracting these discs but Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah requested he leave the matter to him, losing his two [[incisor]]s during the process. In these stories subsequently Abu Bakr, along with other companions, led Muhammad to a place of safety. Later in the year Abu Bakr was a part of campaign again the [[Jew]]ish tribe of [[Banu Nadir]].

In 627 he participated in the [[Battle of the Trench]] and also in the [[Banu Qurayza|Battle of Banu Qurayza]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Maghazi&quot;/&gt; In 628 he participated in [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]] and was made one of the witnesses over the pact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maghazi&quot;/&gt;

In 628 he was a part of the Muslim [[Battle of Khaybar|campaign to Khaybar]]. In 629 Muhammad sent [['Amr ibn al-'As]] to Zaat-ul-Sallasal from where he called for reinforcements and Muhammad sent [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah]]. Commanding an army under him were Abu Bakr and [[Umar]] and they attacked and defeated the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih-al-Bhukari book of Maghazi, Ghazwa Saif-al-Jara&lt;/ref&gt;

In 630 when Muslim armies rushed for the [[Conquest of Mecca]], Abu Bakr was a part of the army. Before the conquest of Mecca his father Uthman Abu Qahafa converted to Islam. In 630 he was part of [[Battle of Hunayn]] and [[Siege of Ta'if]]. He was part of the Muslim army in the campaign of [[Battle of Tabouk|Tabuk]] under Muhammad's command and he was reported to have given all his wealth for the preparation of this expedition.

In 631, Muhammad sent a delegation of three hundred Muslims from Medina to perform the ''[[Hajj]]'' according to the new Islamic way. Abu Bakr was appointed as the leader of the delegates in some Sunni accounts. If this version is correct Abu Bakr had thus the honor of being the first Amir-ul-Haj in the history of Islam. In 632 Abu Bakr followed Muhammad to Mecca for the farewell Hajj.

A short time after returning from the farewell pilgrimage, Muhammad became ill. In his fatal illness, Muhammad came out with a piece of cloth tied around his head and sat on the pulpit. After thanking and praising Allah he said,ﺇ ﻥ ﺍ ﷲ ﺧﻴﺮ ﻋﺒﺪﺍ ﺑﻴﻦ ﺍﻟﺪ ﻧﻴﺎ ﻭ ﺑﻴﻦ ﻣﺎ ﻋﻨﺪ ﻩ ﻓﺎ ﺧﺘﺎ ﺭ ﺫ ﻟﻚ ﺍﻟﻌﺒﺪ ﻣﺎ ﻋﻨﺪ ﺍﷲ
&quot;Allah has given one of His Slaves the choice of receiving the splendor and luxury of the worldly life whatever he likes or to accept the good which is with Allah. So he has chosen that good which is with Allah.&quot;

Abu Bakr wept profusely and said, &quot;Our fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you.&quot; The companions were astonished by this (they wondered why Abu Bakr wept), and the people said, &quot;Look at this old man! Allah's Apostle talks about a [[‘Abdullah (name)|Slave of Allah]] to whom He has given the option to choose either the splendor of this worldly life or the good which is with Him, while he says &quot;our fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you&quot;. It turned out Muhammad himself was that servant, as Abu Bakr later told the companions.

Muhammad continued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
No doubt, I am indebted to Abu Bakr more than to anybody else regarding both his companionship and his wealth. And if I had to take a Khalil from my followers, I would certainly have taken Abu Bakr, but the fraternity of Islam is sufficient. Let no Door of the Mosque remain open, except the door of Abu Bakr &lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih al-Bukhari]], Volume 1, Book 8, Number 456 and Volume 5, Book 58, Number 244 narrated by [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas|ibn 'Abbaas]] and [[Abu Sa`id al-Khudri|Abu Sa`eed al-Khudri]] respectively&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The good referred in the first part means the good in the hereafter. Khalil means intimate friend. The door referred to here is the door to the [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi|mosque of Muhammad]]. When the fever developed he directed Abu Bakr to go to the war following Usama who was 18. When [[Muhammad#Farewell pilgrimage and death|Muhammad died]] Muslims gathered in Al-Masjid al-Nabawi and there were suppressed sobs and sighs. Abu Bakr came from his house at As-Sunh (a village) on a horse where he had been with his new wife. He dismounted and entered the Prophet's Mosque, but did not speak to anyone until he entered upon 'Aa'isha. He went straight to Muhammad who was covered with Hibra cloth (a kind of Yemenite cloth). He then uncovered Muhammad's face and bowed over him and kissed him and wept, saying, &quot;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you. By Allah, Allah will never cause you to die twice. As for the death which was written for you, has come upon you.&quot; 'Umar was making a sermon to the people saying, &quot;By Allah, he is not dead but has gone to his Lord as [[Moses|Musa ibn Imran]] went and remained hidden from his people for forty days. Musa returned after it was said that he had died. By Allah, the Messenger of Allah will come back and he will cut off the hands and legs of those who claim his death.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[[History of the Prophets and Kings|Tarikh ar-Rusul wa al-Muluk]] 9/ 184&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu Bakr arrived and said, &quot;Sit down, O 'Umar!&quot; But 'Umar refused to sit down. So the people came to Abu Bakr and left Umar. Abu Bakr said,
&quot;To proceed, if anyone amongst you used to worship Muhammad, then Muhammad has passed away, but if (anyone of) you used to worship Allah, then Allah is Alive and shall never die. Allah said, &quot;And Muhammad is but a messenger; the messengers have come before him; if then he dies or is killed will you [[Apostasy in Islam|turn back upon your heels]]? And whoever turns back upon his heels, he will by no means do harm to Allah in the least and Allah will reward the grateful.&quot; (3.144)

'Umar said, &quot;By Allah, when I heard Abu Bakr reciting it, my legs could not support me and I fell down at the very moment of hearing him reciting it, declaring that the Prophet had passed away.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih al-Bukhari]], Volume 5, Book 59, Number 733, narrated by [[Aisha|'Aa'ishah]], [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas|ibn 'Abbaas]] and az-Zuhri&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Ahadith on Virtues of Abubakr==

There are many ahadith that mention the virtues and special position of Abu Bakr:

[[Abu Huraira]] reported that the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] said, &quot;There is not anyone who may have been kind to us, or helped us without my returning to him (his favor) except Abu Bakr.  The kindness that he has shown us, only Allah will reward him for that on the Day of Resurrection.  No one's property has been of benefit to me as much as Abu Bakr's.  And if I were to take a Khaleel (close friend from my companions) then I would take Abu Bakr as one.  But you must know that I am Allah's Khaleel.&lt;ref&gt;Jami [[Tirmidhi]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Specify|date=November 2010}}

Ayshah reported that Muhammad said, &quot;It does not behoove a people who have Abu Bakr among them to have anybody other than him as their [[imam]].&lt;ref&gt;Jami Tirmidhi&lt;/ref&gt;{{Specify|date=November 2010}}

Ayshah also reported that the Muhammad  said to her: &quot;Call your father (Abu Bakr) and brother [`Abd al-Rahman] here so I will put something down in writing, for truly I fear lest someone forward a claim or form some ambition, and Allah and the believers refuse anyone other than Abu Bakr.&quot;   from [[Sahih Muslim]]{{Specify|date=November 2010}}

Jubayr ibn Mut'im reported that a woman came and spoke to Muhammad about a matter.  He asked her to come back later some time.  She said, &quot;Tell me if I come later and do not find you?&quot;  Jubayr ibn Mut'im said that it seemed that she meant he may not be alive when she came back.  He said, &quot;If you do not find me then go to Abu Bakr.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Specify|date=November 2010}}

[[Abu Hurairah]] reported that Muhammad said, &quot;Jibreel came to me, held my hand and pointed out to me the gate of Paradise through which my [[Ummah]] will enter it.&quot;  Abu Bakr said, &quot;O Messenger of Allah!  I wish that I had been with you and seen the gate!&quot;  So, Muhammad said, &quot;Know, O Abu Bakr, you will be the first of my Ummah to enter Paradise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sunan [[Abu Dawud]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Specify|date=November 2010}}

[[Ibn Umar]] said that one day, Muhammad came out and entered the [[masjid]], Abu Bakr and Umar with him, to his right and left.  Muhammad had held their hands and he said, &quot;The three of us will be raised on the Day of Resurrection in this way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jami Tirmidhi&lt;/ref&gt;{{Specify|date=November 2010}}

Abu Saeed al Khudri reported that Muhammad said: &quot;Every prophet has two wazeer (ministers) from the dwellers of the heaven (angels) and two wazeer from the inhabitants of the earth.  So, my wazeer from the dwellers of heaven are Jibrael and Mikael and my wazeer from the earthlings are Abu Bakr and Umar.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jami Tirmidhi&lt;/ref&gt;{{Specify|date=November 2010}}

==Election of Abu Bakr to Caliphate==
[[Image:Caliph Abu Bakr's empire at its peak 634-mohammad adil rais.PNG|left|thumb|300px|Caliph Abu Bakr's empire at its peak in August 634.]]
{{Main|Succession to Muhammad|Hadith of the pond of Khumm|List of Sahaba not giving bay'ah to Abu Bakr}}
After Muhammad's death, previously dormant tensions between the Meccan [[Immigration|immigrants]], the [[Muhajirun]], and the Medinan converts, the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]], threatened to break out and split the [[Ummah]]. Other Arabic tribes also wished to revert to local leadership and split from Medina's control. In some places, people claiming prophethood started to establish leaderships to oppose Medina, e.g. [[Al-Aswad Al-Ansi]] and [[Musaylimah]]. All of which are events that lead to splitting the Muslim community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donner&quot;&gt;Fred M. Donner, &quot;Muhammad and the Believers: At the Origins of Islam&quot;, Harvard University Press, 2010, ISBN 978-0-674-05097-6 ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=qBzRj7OajmEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ansar, the leaders of the tribes of Medina, met in a hall or house called [[saqifah]], to discuss whom they would support as their new leader. When Abu Bakr was informed of the meeting, he, [[Umar]], [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah]] and a few others rushed to prevent the Ansar from making a premature decision. Accounts of this meeting vary greatly. All agree that during the meeting Umar declared that Abu Bakr should be the new leader, and declared his allegiance to Abu Bakr, followed by Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, and thus Abu Bakr became the first Muslim [[caliph]], who was given the title, ''Khalifa-tul-Rasool'' (''Successor of messenger of Allah''), a title only accepted by Sunni Muslims. Shias criticise Abu Bakr for forsaking the funeral of Muhammad to attend the political gathering, and believe that Muhammad had already appointed Ali in his lifetime as his successor. This view portrays Abu Bakr and Umar as plotters in a political coup against the Alids. The Ismaili Shia Institute researcher Wilfred Madelung&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.macmillan.com/author/wilfredmadelung Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for Ismaili Studies in London]&lt;/ref&gt;  portrays Abu Bakr as a political opportunist whose character as the founder of Sunni Islam has been extensively embellished by subsequent kings and emperors (caliphs) making it difficult to openly criticise him. Some sects of Islam like Shia strongly believe that Abu Bakr deceived Ali, keeping Ali from his right as khilafat since he was true successor to Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;[Madelung, The Succession to Muhammad&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign as a Caliph==
After assuming the office of [[Caliphate]] Abu Bakr's first address was as follow:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been given the authority over you, and I am not the best of you. If I do well, help me; and if I do wrong, set me right. Sincere regard for truth is loyalty and disregard for truth is treachery. The weak amongst you shall be strong with me until I have secured his rights, if God wills; and the strong amongst you shall be weak with me until I have wrested from him the rights of others, if God wills. Obey me so long as I obey God and His Messenger. But if I disobey God and His Messenger, ye owe me no obedience. Arise for your prayer, God have mercy upon you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Abu Bakr's Caliphate lasted for 27 months, during which he crushed the rebellion of the Arab tribes throughout [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] in the successful [[Ridda Wars|campaign against Apostasy]]. In the last months of his rule, he launched campaigns against the [[Sassanid Empire]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantine Empire) and thus set in motion a historical trajectory&lt;ref name=&quot;Donner&quot; /&gt; (continued later on by [[Umar]] and [[Uthman ibn Affan|Uthman]]) that in just a few short decades would lead to one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in history]]. He had little time to pay attention to the administration of state, though state affairs remained stable during his Caliphate. On the advice of Umar and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah he agreed to have a salary from state treasury and abolish his cloth trade.

===Ridda Wars===
{{Main|Ridda Wars}}
[[File:Mohammad adil-Riddah wars.PNG|thumb|300px|Map detailing the sites of Major battles fought during ridda wars.]]
Troubles emerged soon after Abu Bakr's succession, threatening the unity and stability of the new community and state. Several Arabic tribes revolted against Abu Bakr. In four of the six centres of the insurrection, the rebells rallied around people who claimed to be prophets, the most prominent among these was [[Musaylimah]]. The tribes claimed that they had submitted to Muhammad only, and that with Muhammad's death, their allegiance had ended. This was common practice in pre-islamic Arabia. After the death of a tribal leader the alliance with the tribe of that leader was regarded as having ended.&lt;ref name=blewis/&gt; Thus several tribes acted in accordance to this pre-islamic practice and refused to pay ''[[Zakat]]''. Abu Bakr, however, insisted that they had not just submitted to a simple human leader but joined the Muslim religious community, of which he was the new head. So, in contrast to pre-islamic times, their allegiance was not seen as having ended at all.

This was the start of the ''Ridda wars'' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] for the Wars of Apostasy). The apostasy of central Arabia was led by self-proclaimed prophet Musaylimah of in [[al-Yamama]], while the other centers were to the south and east in [[Bahrain]], [[Oman]], [[Al Mahrah Governorate|Mahra]] region and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Donner&quot; /&gt; Abu Bakr planned his strategy accordingly and formed the Muslim army into 11 [[corps]]. The strongest corps, and this was the main punch of the Muslim army, was that of [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] and was used to fight the most powerful of the rebel forces. Other corps were given areas of secondary importance in which to bring the less dangerous apostate tribes. Abu Bakr's plan was first to clear the area of west and central Arabia (the area nearest Medina), then tackle [[Malik ibn Nuwayrah]], and finally concentrate against the most dangerous enemy Musaylimah. After series of successful campaigns, Khalid ibn al-Walid finally defeated Musaylimah and his tribe, the [[Banu Hanifa]], in the [[Battle of Yamama]].&lt;ref&gt;Tabari: Vol. 2, p. 518&lt;/ref&gt; The Campaign of the Apostasy was fought and completed during the eleventh year after [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]. The year 12 Hijri dawned, on 18 March 633, with Arabia united under the central authority of the Caliph at Medina.

This phenomenon was later regarded as primarily a religious movement by Arabic historians. However, the early sources indicate that in reality it was mainly political.&lt;ref&gt;Laura V. Vaglieri in ''The Cambridge History of Islam'', p.58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=griffel&gt;Frank Griffel: Apostasie und Toleranz im Islam, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; After all, the revolting Arabs only refused to pay [[Zakat]] (Charity), but they did not refuse to perform the [[salah]].&lt;ref name=griffel/&gt; This however is disputed and explained by Muslim scholars in that the dictation of Zakat was one of the Five pillars of Islam and its denial or withholding is an act of denial of a cornerstone of faith, and is therefore an act of apostasy. [[Bernard Lewis]] states that the fact that Islamic Historians have regarded this as a primarily religious movement was due to a later interpretation of events in terms of a theological world-view.&lt;ref name=blewis&gt;Bernard Lewis: ''The Arabs in History'', p.65&lt;/ref&gt;
The opponents of the Muslim armies were not only apostates, but also - if not most of them - tribes which were largely or even completely independent from the Muslim community.&lt;ref name=griffel/&gt;
However, these revolts also had a religious aspect: [[Medina]] had become the centre of a social and political system, of which religion was an integral part; consequently it was inevitable that any reaction against this system should have a religious aspect.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopaedia of Islam''. New Edition. Vol.1, p.110&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Qur'an'' — preservation===
{{Main|Origin and development of the Qur'an}}
According to [[Sunni Islam]], Abu Bakr was instrumental in preserving the Qur'an in written form. It is said that after the hard-won victory over Musaylimah in the Battle of Yamama fought in 632, Umar (the later ''Caliph'' Umar), saw that many of the Muslims who had memorized the ''Qur'an'' had died in battle. Fearing that the Qur'an may be lost or corrupted, Umar requested the Caliph Abu Bakr to authorize the compilation and preservation of the Book in written format. After initial hesitation, Abu Bakr made a committee headed by [[Zayd ibn Thabit]] which included the memorizers of the Qur'an and Umar and to collect all verses of the Book. After collecting all Qur'anic verses from texts in the possession of various [[sahaba]], [[Zayd ibn Thabit]] and members of his committee verified the reading by comparing with those who had memorized the Qur'an. After they were satisfied that they had not missed out any verse or made any mistakes in reading or writing it down, the text was written down as one single manuscript and presented in a book form to the Caliph Abu Bakr. It is believed that this process happened within one year of the death of Muhammad when most of his [[sahaba]] (companions) were still alive.

Prior to his death, Abu Bakr gave this authorized copy of the Qur'an to Umar - his successor. It remained with him throughout his tenure as Caliph (10 years). Prior to his death, Umar gave this Book to his daughter [[Hafsa bint Umar]], who was one of the wives of Muhammad. Umar did not nominate his successor on his deathbed, and thus preferred to leave this copy with Hafsa so as not to indicate his personal preference of who would be the next caliph. Later on, it became the basis of [[Uthman Ibn Affan]]'s definitive text of the ''Qur'an'' which was published far and wide merely 18 years after the death of Muhammad. Later historians give Uthman Ibn Affan the principal credit for re-verification and publishing the ''Qur'an''. Shi'as reject the idea that Abu Bakr or Umar were instrumental in the collection or preservation of the ''Qur'an''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Quran compiled by Imam Ali (AS) | work=Al-Islam.org | url=http://al-islam.org/encyclopedia/chapter8/4.html | accessdate=12 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military expansion===
Once the rebellions had been put down, Abu Bakr began a war of conquest. Whether or not he intended a full-out imperial conquest is hard to say; he did, however, set in motion a historical trajectory that in just a few short decades would lead to one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in history]]. Abu Bakr began with [[Iraq]], the richest province of Persian Empire. He sent his most brilliant general Khalid ibn al-Walid to invade the [[Sassanid Empire]].

===Invasion of Sassanid Persian Empire===
{{See|Islamic conquest of Persia}}
[[File:Mohammad adil-Khalid's conquest of Iraq.PNG|thumb|300px|Map detailing the route of Khalid ibn Walid's conquest of Iraq.]]

After the Ridda Wars, a tribal chief of north eastern Arabia, Muthanna ibn Haris, raided the Persian towns in Iraq. With the success of the raids, a considerable amount of booty was collected. Muthanna ibn Haris went to Medina to inform Caliph Abu Bakr about his success and was appointed commander of his people, after which he began to raid deeper into Iraq. Using the mobility of his [[light cavalry]] he could easy raid any town near the [[desert]] and within moments could disappear again in to the desert, into which the [[Sassanid army]] was unable to chase them. Muthanna’s acts made Abu Bakr think about the expansion of the [[Rashidun Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tabari&quot;&gt;Tabari: Vol. 2, p. 554.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu Bakr started with the invasion of Iraq. The problems faced by Abu Bakr were that the [[Arab]]s feared the Persians with a deep, unreasoning fear which ran in the tribal consciousness as a racial complex and was the result of centuries of Persian power and glory. In return the Persian regarded the Arab with contempt. It was important not to suffer a defeat, for that would confirm and strengthen this instinctive fear. To make certain of victory, Abu Bakr decided on two measures; that the invading army would consist entirely of volunteers; and he put in command of the army his best general Khalid ibn al-Walid. After defeating the self-proclaimed prophet Musaylimah in the Battle of Yamama, Khalid was still at [[Al-Yamama]] when Abu Bakr sent him orders to invade the Sassanid Empire. Making [[Al-Hirah]] the objective of Khalid, Abu Bakr sent reinforcements and ordered the tribal chiefs of north eastern Arabia, Muthanna ibn Haris, Mazhur bin Adi, Harmala and Sulma to operate under the command of Khalid along with their men. In about third week of March 633 (first week of [[Muharram]] 12th Hijrah) Khalid set out from Al-Yamama with an army of 10,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tabari&quot;/&gt; The tribal chiefs, with 2,000 warriors each, joined Khalid; Thus Khalid entered the Persian Empire with 18,000 troops.
After entering [[Iraq]] with his army of 18,000, Khalid won decisive victories in four consecutive battles: [[Battle of Chains]], fought in April 633; [[Battle of River]], fought in the 3rd week of April 633; [[Battle of Walaja]], fought in May 633 (where he successfully used a [[Pincer movement|double envelopment]] manoeuvre), and [[Battle of Ullais]], fought in the mid of May 633. By now the Persian court already disturbed by the internal problems, was down and out. In the last week of May 633, [[Hira]] capital city of Iraq fell to the Muslims after resistance in the [[Battle of Hira|Siege of Hira]]. After resting his armies, in June 633 Khalid laid siege of [[Al Anbar]], which resisted and was eventually surrendered after a siege of a few weeks in July 633 after the [[Battle of Al-Anbar|Siege of Al-Anbar]].
Khalid then moved towards the south, and conquered the city of Ein ul Tamr after the [[Battle of ein-ul-tamr|Battle of Ein ut Tamr]] in the last week of July 633.  By now, almost the whole of Iraq (Euphrates region) was under Islamic control. Khalid got a call of help from northern Arabia at Daumat-ul-Jandal, where another Muslim Arab general, Ayaz bin Ghanam, was trapped among the rebel tribes. Khalid went to Daumat-ul-jandal and defeated the rebels in the [[Battle of Daumat-ul-jandal]] in the last week of August 633. Returning from Arabia, he got news of the assembling of a large Persian army. He decided to defeat them all separately to avoid the risk of defeat to a large unified Persian army. Four divisions of Persian and [[Christian]] Arab auxiliaries were present at Hanafiz, Zumiel, Sanni and Muzieh. Khalid devised a brilliant plan to destroy the Persian forces. He divided his army in three units, and attacked the Persian forces in brilliantly coordinated attacks from three different sides at night, starting from the [[Battle of Muzieh]], then the [[Battle of Sanni]], and finally the [[Battle of Zumail]] during November 633. These devastating defeats ended Persian control over Iraq, and left the Persian capital [[Ctesiphon]] unguarded and vulnerable for Muslims attack, before attacking the Persian Capital Khalid decided to eliminate all Persian forces from south and west, he accordingly marched against the border city of Firaz, where he defeated the combined forces of the [[Sassanid army|Sassanid Persians]], [[Byzantine army|Byzantine]] [[Roman army|Romans]] and Christian Arabs in the [[Battle of Firaz]] in December 633. This was the last battle in his conquest of Iraq. While Khalid was on his way to attack Qadissiyah, a key fort in the way to Persian Capital Ctesiphon, he received the letter of Caliph Abu Bakr and was sent to Roman front in Syria to assume the command of Muslim armies to conquer Roman Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Akram, chapters 19-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invasion of Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire===
{{See|Muslim conquest of Syria}}
[[File:Mohammad adil-Muslims Invasion of Syria.PNG|thumb|300px|Map detailing Rashidun Caliphates invasion of Levant.]]
With a successful invasion of Sassanid Persian province of Iraq, Abu Bakr’s confidence grew.  He concentrated four large corps at Zhu Qissah and sent them to Roman Syria. Each corps was assigned its own commander and its own target. The leaders of the different corps received intelligence of a concentration of large Byzantine armies at Ajnadayn while on the march. The army stopped its advance and the leaders wrote to Abu Bakr for help. Since the Moslem position in Iraq was stable by now, the Caliph accordingly wrote to Khalid to take half of his forces of Iraq to Syria and to assume command of all Muslim armies in Byzantine Syria. The Byzantine province of Syria in those days consisted of modern day Syria, [[Jordan]], [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian territories]], [[Lebanon]] and southern [[Turkey]]. There were two routes towards Syria from Iraq, one was via Daumat-ul-Jandal and the other was through Mesopotamia passing though [[Ar Raqqah]]. Since it was believed that the Muslim armies in Syria were in need of urgent reinforcement, Khalid avoided the conventional route to Syria via Daumat ul Jandal because it was a long route and would take weeks to reach Syria. He also did not take the Mesopotamian route because Roman garrisons held northern Syria and northern Mesopotamia. A conflict with these Roman forces would have forced Khalid to spend too much time while Muslim armies were being outflanked in Syria. Khalid selected, instead, a short and unconventional route to Syria, passing though the [[Syrian Desert]]. Although probably hyperbole, some sources state that his soldiers marched for two days without a single drop of water before reaching an oasis that Khalid had selected in advance. Khalid thus entered Northern Syria at a point where he was least expected, catching the Byzantine forces on their right flank. More recent historians  have suggested that this surprises attack unhinged the Byzantine defenses in Syria.

Khalid entered Syria in June 634 and quickly captured the border forts of

[[File:Mohammad adil-Muslim invasion of Syria-2.PNG|thumb|300px|Map detailing the route of Khalid ibn Walid's invasion of Syria.]]

[[Sawa, Syria|Sawa]], [[Arak, Syria|Arak]], [[Tadmur]], [[Sukhnah]]. [[Qaryatayn]] and [[Hawarin]] after the battles of [[Battle of Qarteen|Qaryatayn]] and [[Battle of Hawareen|Hawarin]]. After dealing with all these cities, Khalid moved towards [[Damascus]], passing though a mountain pass which is now known as '''Sanita-al-Uqab''' (Uqab pass) after the name of Khalid's army standard. From here he moved away from Damascus, towards [[Bosra]], the capital of Ghassanid Arab kingdom, a vassal of Eastern Roman empire. He had ordered other Muslim commaders to concentrate their armies at Bosra, which were still near the Syrian-Arabia border. At Maraj-al-Rahab, Khalid defeated a [[Ghassanids|Ghassanid]] army of Christian Arabs in a quick [[Battle of Marj-al-Rahit]]. Meanwhile Abu Ubaida ibn al-Jarrah, the supreme commander of Muslim armies in Syria had ordered Shurhabil ibn Hasana to attack [[Bosra]].The later laid siege of [[Bosra]] with his small army of 4000 men. Roman and Ghassanid Arab garrison, noticing that this might be the advance guard of the larger Muslim army to come, decided to attack and destroy Shurhabil’s army. They came out of the fortified city and attacked Shurhabil, surrounding him from all sides; Khalid reached the arena with his advance guard cavalry and saved the day for Shurhabil. The combine forces of Khalid, Shurhabil and Abu Ubaidah then laid the [[Battle of Bosra|siege of Bosra]], which surrendered some time in mid July 634. thus effectively ending the Ghassanid Dynasty.

[[File:Mohammad adil-Khalid's(r.a) route to Syria.PNG|thumb|300px|Geographical Map detailing the route of Khalid ibn Walid's invasion of Syria.]]

Here Khalid took over the command of Muslim armies in Syria from Abu Ubaidah, as per the instructions of Caliph. The massive Byzantine armies were concentrating at Ajnadayn to push the invading armies back to desert. Early Muslim sources have mentioned its size to be 90,000, while most of the modern historians doubt the figures, but consider this battle to be the key to breaking the Byzantine power in Syria. According to the instructions of Khalid all Muslim corps concentrated at Ajnadayn, where they fought a decisive battle against Byzantine on 30 July 634.
Defeat at the [[Battle of Ajnadayn]], left Syria vulnerable to the Muslim invaders. Khalid decided to capture Damascus, the Byzantine stronghold. At Damascus Thomas, son in law of Emperor Heraculis, was in charge. Receiving the intelligence of Khalid's march towards Damascus he prepared for the defences of Damascus. He wrote to Emperor Heraculis for reinforcement, who was at Emesa that time. Moreover Thomas, in order to get more time for preparation of a siege, sent the armies to delay or if possible halt Khalid's march to Damascus, one such army was defeated at [[Battle of Yaqusa]] in mid-August 634 near [[Lake Tiberias]] 90 miles from Damascus, another army that halted the Muslim advance to Damascus was defeated in [[battle of Maraj-al-Safar|Battle of Maraj as Saffer]] on 19 August 634. These engagements delayed Khalid’s advance and gave Thomas enough time to prepare for siege. Meanwhile Heraculis's reinforcement had reached the city, which he had dispatched after the bad news of Ajnadyn. Before Heraculis's another regiment could reach Damascus, Khalid had finally reached Damascus. Khalid reached Damascus on 20 August and besieged the city. To isolate the city from rest of the region, Khalid placed the detachments south on the road to Palestine and in north at Damascus-Emesa route, and several other smaller detachments on routes towards Damascus. Heraculis's reinforcement was intercepted and routed at the [[Battle of Sanita-al-Uqab]], 20 miles from Damascus. Khalid's forces withstood three Roman sallies that tried to break the siege. Khalid finally attacked and [[Conquest of Damascus|conquered Damascus]] on 18 September 634 after a 30-day siege. According to some sources the siege lasted for four or six months. Heraculis, having received the news of the fall of Damascus, left for [[Antioch]] from [[Emesa]]. The citizens were given peace on the terms of annual tribute; the [[Byzantine army]] was given a three-day peace to go as far as they could. After the three-day deadline was over, the Muslim cavalry under Khalid's command attacked the Roman army, catching up to them using an unknown shortcut, at the [[Battle of Maraj-al-Debaj]], 190 miles north of Damascus. Abu Bakr died during the [[Conquest of Damascus|siege of Damascus]] and Umar became the new Caliph. He dismissed his cousin Khalid ibn al-Walid from the command and appointed [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah]] the new commander in chief of Islamic army in Syria. Abu Ubaidah got the letter of his appointment and Khalid's disposal during the siege, but he delayed the announcement until the city was conquered.

==Death==
On 23 August 634, Abu Bakr fell sick and did not recover due to his old age. There are two accounts about the sickness of Abu Bakr. One account states that 8 August 634 was a cold day and when Abu Bakr took a bath, he caught a chill. Another account indicates that, about a year before, along with some other companions, Harith bin Kaladah and Attab bin Usaid, he had eaten some poisoned food which did not affect him for a year.

Abu Bakr developed high [[fever]] and was confined to bed. His illness was prolonged and when his condition worsened he felt that his end was near. Realizing his death was near, he sent for Ali and requested him to perform his [[ghusl]] since Ali had also done it for the Prophet Muhammad.

Abu Bakr felt that he should nominate his successor so that the issue should not be a cause of dissension among the Muslims after his death, though there was already controversy over Ali not having been appointed.&lt;ref&gt;''Sidiq-i-Akbar Hazrat Abu Bakr'' by Masudul Hasan. Lahore: Ferozsons, 1976. {{OCLC|3478821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appointed Umar as his successor after discussing with some companions. Some of them favored the nomination and others disliked it, due to the tough nature of Umar.

Abu Bakr thus dictated his last testament to [[Uthman Ibn Affan]] as follows:

{{Quote|In the name of Most Merciful God. This is the last will and testament of Abu Bakr bin Abu Qahafa, when he is in the last hour of the world, and the first of the next; an hour in which the infidel must believe, the wicked be convinced of their evil ways, I nominate Umar bin al Khattab as my successor. Therefore, hear to him and obey him. If he acts right, confirm his actions. My intentions are good, but I cannot see the future results. However, those who do ill shall render themselves liable to severe account hereafter. Fare you well. May you be ever attended by the Divine favor of blessing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alim.org/library/biography/khalifa/content/KAB/18/2 Khalifa Abu Bakr - Death of Abu Bakr]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Abu Bakr next asked [[Aisha]] as to how many pieces of cloth were used for Muhammad's shroud. Aisha said that three pieces had been used. Abu Bakr thereupon desired the same number for his own shroud. On Monday 23 August 634 Abu Bakr died. The funeral prayer was led by Umar. He was buried the same night by the side of Muhammad's grave in Aisha's house near Al-Masjid al-Nabawi

Today there are many families which are the descendants of Abu Bakr. Most of them are known by the name [[Al-Siddiqi]] And Al-Atiqi's Or Al-Atiqi (Al-Ateeqi) ((In Arabic)). But they are also known by some other names in different localities. For example, In East [[Ethiopia]], [[Siddiqis]] are usually called [[Qallu]], which means ''people of the religion'', as they were the first to bring Islam to this area. In [[Somalia]], they are commonly known as [[Sheekhaal]] and they are well respected by other [[Somali people|Somali]] clans. In [[Bangladesh]], they are known by the name of [[Qureshi]]. There are also Al-Atiqi or Atiqi Families in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Syria,Yemen, Iraq and other places in the Arabia Peninsula. All the descendants of Abu Bakr, their Ancestors are: Abdurahman Ibn Abu Bakr and Muhammad Ibn Abu Bakr. The Al-Bakri Family in Egypt are the descendants of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr while the sheekhaal or Fiqi Umar Family found in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya and the Aala Atiq Families found in the Arabia Peninsula are the descendants of Abdurahman Ibn Abu Bakr.

==Legacy==
Abu Bakr became the Caliph on 8 June 632 and he died on 23 August 634. Though the period of his caliphate covers only two years, two months and fifteen days, it included successful invasions of the two most powerful empires of the time: the [[Sassanid Empire]] and [[Byzantine Empire]].

Abu Bakr had the distinction of being the first Caliph in the history of Islam and also the first Caliph to nominate a successor. He was the only Caliph in the history of Islam who refunded to the state treasury at the time of his death the entire amount of the allowance that he had drawn during the period of his caliphate{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}{{Dubious|date=February 2009}}.

He is revered for being the first Muslim ruler to establish:
* [[Bayt al-mal]]
* The Crown Pasture
* '[[Ijtihad]]'{{Dubious|date=February 2009}}.

He has the distinction of purchasing the land for [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]].

Abu Bakr had given up drinking [[wine]] even in the time before [[Islam]]. He was the foremost [[genealogist]] of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] and was well accomplished at interpreting [[dream]]s according to Ibn Sirin.

===Sunni view===
Sunni Muslims also consider Abu Bakr as one of [[hadith of the ten promised paradise|al-`Ashara al-Mubasharîn fi-l-Janna (The Ten Promised Paradise)]] whom Muhammad had testified were destined for Paradise. He is regarded as '''Khalifa Rasulullah''' ''The successor of Messenger of Allah'', and first of the Rightly Guided Caliphs - i.e. [[Rashidun]] and being the rightful successor to Muhammad. Abu Bakr had always been the closest friend and confidant of Muhammad throughout his life. He was always there beside Muhammad at every major event. It was Abu Bakr's wisdom that Muhammad always honored. Abu Bakr is regarded to be among best persons from the followers of Muhammad, as Umar ibn Khattab stated that ‘If the faith of Abu Bakr was weighed against the faith of the people of the earth, the faith of Abu Bakr would outweigh the others.’&lt;ref&gt;Narrated by al-Bayhaqi in ‘al-Jamia’ lashu’ab al-Eemaan’ (1:18) and its narrators are trustworthy.&lt;/ref&gt; During the last few weeks of his life, Muhammad preferred Abu Bakr to lead the Muslims in prayer while he was ill. Upon Muhammad's death, it was Abu Bakr who demonstrated sagacity to keep the ranks of the Muslims together. Muhammad had not left behind a clear will on who would succeed him. There was dissension between the two original tribes of Medina, namely [[Banu Aus|Aws]] and [[Khazraj]] regarding who would become the ruler over the Muslims after Muhammad. This even led to drawing of swords between them. Abu Bakr, [[Umar]] and [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah]] rushed to the spot where the dispute almost turned bloody, and delivered his famous speech to show the path of unity between the Muslims and declared that Umar should become the first caliph. In turn, Umar declared his allegiance to Abu Bakr saying that there is no better man amongst the Muslims after Muhammad. The majority of the sahaba (companions of Muhammad) assembled there followed suit and pledged their allegiance to Abu Bakr. Sunnis point out this fact of avoiding bloodshed between Muslims and preserving the unity of the state as of paramount importance, or it would have led to self-destruction of the new state. The famous scholar Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal also stated that he is among the foremost companions (sahaba) of prophet Muhammad. 

===Shi'a view===
{{Main|Shi'a view of Abu Bakr}} {{See also|Umar at Fatimah's house|Succession to Muhammad}} 

Shi'a Muslims have a different view of Abu Bakr. They believe that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] was supposed to assume Caliphate, and had been appointed by Muhammad as his successor at [[Hadith of the pond of Khumm|Ghadir Khumm]]. It is also believed Abu Bakr and Umar conspired to take over power in the Muslim nation after Muhammad's death, in a [[coup d'état]] against Ali. According to them, they also met secretly with the tribal leaders of Mecca and Medina at Saqifah to elect Abu Bakr. The Shi'a do not view Abu Bakr's being with Muhammad in the cave when the two fled Mecca as a meritorious act. 

The Shi'a criticize Abu Bakr for an alleged dispute between him and Muhammad's daughter, [[Fatimah]], that, according to them, ended with her becoming angry with Abu Bakr and refusing to talk with him for the rest of her life, she died six months later. According to them, Abu Bakr had refused to grant her a piece of land which Muhammad had given to her as a gift before his death. However, Abu Bakr replied by saying that Muhammad had told him that the Prophets of God do not possess any worldly possessions and on this basis he refused to give her the piece of land. Some Shi'a also accuse him of participating in the burning of the house of Ali and Fatima.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Qutayba al Dinawari. Al Imama Wa'l Siyasa.&lt;/ref&gt; (''see [[Fadak]]'')

The Shi'a believe that Abu Bakr sent [[Khalid ibn Walid]] to crush those who were in favour of [[Ali]]'s caliphate (''see [[Ridda Wars]]''). The Shi'a strongly refute the idea that Abu Bakr or Umar were instrumental in the collection or preservation of the ''Qur'an'', claiming that they should have accepted the copy of the book in the possession of Ali&lt;ref&gt;[http://al-islam.org/encyclopedia/chapter8/4.html The Quran Compiled by Imam Ali (AS)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-Muslim views===
[[Edward Gibbon]] wrote about Abu Bakr as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The moderation, and the veracity of Abu Bakr confirmed the new religion,&lt;ref&gt;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&lt;/ref&gt; and furnished an example for invitation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William Muir]] states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Abu Bakr's judgment was sound and impartial; his conversation agreeable and his demeanor affable and much sought after by the Quraysh and he was popular throughout the city.... The faith of Abu Bakr was the greatest guarantee of Muhammad's sincerity in the beginning of his career, and indeed, in a modified sense, throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;Life of Muhammad&lt;/ref&gt; To have such a person as a staunch adherent of his claim, was for Muhammad a most important step.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William Montgomery Watt]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;From 622 to 632 he (Abu Bakr) was Mohammed's chief adviser, but had no prominent public functions except that he conducted the pilgrimage to Mecca in 631, and led the public prayers in Medina during Mohammed's last illness.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Britannia, Vol. I, page 54, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Hadith transmitted by him==

It has been transmitted from [[Sahih Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]] that Abu Bakr related, &quot;I said to the Prophet: 'O Messenger of Allah!  Teach me a supplication which I may make in prayer.'  He replied: 'Say: Oh Allah! I have done my soul a great harm and no one can forgive sins except You; so grant me forgiveness with Your Pleasure, and have Pity on me.  You are [[Al Ghaffur]], Ar-Rahim.'&quot;

In al-Adab al-Mafrud of Imam [[Al-Bukhari]] and in [[ibn Majah]] and the [[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], it has been reported from Abu Bakr that [[Muhammad]] said, &quot;Stick to speaking the truth because truth is a companion of birr (righteousness) and both these are in Paradise; and abstain from lying because it is a companion of fujur (sin) and both these are in Hell.&quot;

It is reported in Sunan [[Abu Dawood]], Ahmad, and [[Tirmidhi]] that Abu Bakr said, &quot;O people! You recite the verse (5:105): ''''O you who believe!  Guard your own souls; if you follow (right) guidance, no hurt can come to you from those who stray'''', but you misinterpret it and do not know what it means.  I once heard the Messenger of Allah  say, 'If people see someone practicing injustice and do not set him right, Allah will almost certainly visit them all with severe punishment.&quot;  Another narration goes, &quot;If they see evil practiced and do not attempt to change it...&quot;

According to a narration of Abu Bakr as reported in Jami al [[Tirmidhi]], [[Tafsir]] ibn Jarir and elsewhere, when Muhammed recited this verse (4:123), &quot;'''And whoever does evil shall be requited for it'''&quot; to him, he felt as if his back was broken.  When Muhammed noticed the reaction on him, he asked, &quot;What is the matter with you?&quot;  Thereupon, Abu Bakr submitted, &quot;Ya RasulAllah, there is hardly anyone among us who can claim to have done nothing bad in one's life.  Now if every evil deed has to be requited, who can hope to go unscathed from among us?  He said, &quot;O Abu Bakr, you and your believing brothers need not worry about it because worldly hardships that you face shall make amends for your sins.&quot;  As it appears in another narration, he said, &quot;O Abu Bakr, do you not get sick?  Are you never tested by distress and sorrow?&quot;  Abu Bakr said, &quot;No doubt, all this does happen.&quot;  Then he said, &quot;There, this is the requital of whatever evil you may have done.&quot;

'''Ambrose the Camaldulian''' (1386 – October 20, 1439), born '''Ambrogio [[Traversari]]''', was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[theology|theologian]].

==Biography==
He was born near [[Forlì]], at the village of [[Portico e San Benedetto|Portico di Romagna]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

At the age of fourteen he entered the [[Camaldolese|Camaldulian]] Order in the monastery of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli, Florence|Santa Maria degli Angeli]] in [[Florence]], and rapidly became a leading theologian and Hellenist. In [[Greek literature]] his master was [[Manuel Chrysoloras|Emmanuel Chrysoloras]]. He became general of the order in 1431, and was a leading advocate of the [[primacy of the Roman Pontiff]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

This attitude he showed clearly when he attended the [[Council of Florence|Council of Basel]] as legate of [[Pope Eugene IV]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} and defended the primacy of the Roman Pontiff and adjured the council not to &quot;rend asunder [[Jesus|Christ's]] seamless robe&quot;.{{sfn|Becket|1913}}

He was next sent by the [[Pope]] to the [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor]] to ask his aid for the [[pontiff]] in his efforts to end this council, which for five years had been trenching on the papal prerogatives. The Pope transferred the council from [[Basel]] to [[Ferrara]] on 18 September 1437.{{sfn|Becket|1913}} So strong was his hostility to some of the delegates that he described Basel as a western [[Babylon (New Testament)|Babylon]]. He likewise supported the pope at Ferrara and Florence, and worked hard in the attempt to reconcile the Eastern and Western Churches.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} But in this council, and later, in that of Florence, Ambrose, by his efforts and charity toward some poor Greek bishops, greatly helped to bring about a union of the two Churches, the decree for which, 6 July 1439, he was called on to draw up. He died soon after.{{sfn|Becket|1913}}

==Character==

According to the author of his biography in the Eleventh edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica &quot;Ambrose is interesting as typical of the new humanism which was growing up within the church. Thus while among his own colleagues he seemed merely a hypocritical and arrogant priest, in his relations with his brother humanists, such as [[Cosimo de' Medici]], he appeared as the student of classical antiquities and especially of Greek theological authors&quot;.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Works==
His works are a treatise on the Holy [[Eucharist]], one on the Procession of the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]], many lives of saints, a history of his generalship of the Camaldolites. He also translated from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Latin]] a life of [[John Chrysostom|Chrysostom]] ([[Venice]], 1533); the Spiritual Wisdom of [[Joannes Moschus|John Moschus]]; ''[[The Ladder of Divine Ascent]]'' of [[John Climacus]] (Venice, 1531), P.G., LXXXVIII.{{sfn|Becket|1913}}

Between 1424 and 1433 he worked to the translation of the ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' by [[Diogenes Laërtius]] that widely circulated in manuscript form and was published at [[Rome]] in 1472 (the first printed edition of the ''Lives''; the Greek text was printed only in 1533).{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

He also translated four books against the errors of the Greeks, by Manuel Kalekas, [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monk ([[Ingolstadt]], 1608), P.G., CLII, col. 13-661, a work known only through Ambrose's translation. He also translated many homilies of St. John Chrysostom; the treatise of the [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] on the celestial hierarchy; [[Basil of Caesarea|St. Basil's]] treatise on virginity; thirty nine discourses of St. [[Ephrem the Syrian]], and many other works of the fathers and writers of the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Church]]. [[Jean Mabillon|Dom Mabillon's]] ''Letters and Orations of S. Ambrose of Camaldoli'' was published at Florence, 1759. St. Ambrose is honoured by the Church on 20 November.{{sfn|Becket|1913}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ambrosians''' is a term that might be applied either to members of one of the religious brotherhoods which at various times since the 14th century have sprung up in and around [[Milan]] or, exceptionally to a 16th century sect of [[Anabaptist Ambrosians|Anabaptists]]. 

==Orders==
Only the oldest of the Catholic Ambrosians, the Fratres S. Ambrosii ad Nemus, had anything more than a very local significance. This order is known from a bull of [[Pope Gregory XI]] addressed to the [[monk]]s of the church of St Ambrose outside Milan.

Saint Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, certainly did not found religious orders, though he took an interest in the monastic life and watched over its beginnings in his diocese, providing for the needs of a monastery outside the walls of Milam, as Saint Augustine recounts in his ''Confessions''. Ambrose also made successful efforts to improve the moral life of women in the Milan of his time by promoting the permanent institution of Virgins, as also of widows. His exhortations and other interventions have survived in various writings: ''De virginibus'', ''De viduis'', ''De virginitate'', ''De institutione virginis'', ''De exhortatione virginitatis'', and ''De lapsu virginis consecratae''. Ambrose was the only Father of the Church to leave behind so many writings on the subject and his attentions naturally enough led to the formation of  communities which later became formal monasteries of women. 

It is against this background that two religious orders or congregations, one of men and one of women, when founded in the Milan area during the 13th and 15th centuries, took Saint Ambrose as their patron and hence adopted his name.
 
===Order of St Ambrose===
The first of these groups was formed in a wood outside Milan by three noble Milanese, Alexander Grivelli, Antonio Petrasancta, and Albert Besuzzi, who were joined by others, including some  priests. In 1375 [[Pope Gregory XI]] gave them the Rule of St Augustine, with set of constitutions. As a canonically recognized order they took the name &quot;Fratres Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus&quot; and adopted a habit consisting of a brown [[tunic]], [[scapular]], and hood. The brethren elected a superior with the title of [[prior]] who was then instituted by the [[Archbishop of Milan]]. The priests of the congregation undertook preaching and other tasks of the ministry but were not allowed to accept charge parishes. In the liturgy they followed the [[Ambrosian Rite]]. Various monasteries were founded on these lines, but without any formal bond between them. In 1441 [[Pope Eugene IV]] merged them into one congregation called &quot;Congregatio Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus&quot;, made the original house the main seat, and laid down a system of government whereby a general chapter met every three years, elected the priors who stayed in office till the next chapter. There was a rector, or superior general, who was assisted by two &quot;visitors&quot;.

Saint Charles Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, successfully reformed their discipline, grown lax, in 1579. In 1589 [[Pope Sixtus V]] united to the Congregation of St Ambrose the monasteries of a group known as the &quot;Brothers of the Apostles of the Poor Life&quot; (or  &quot;Apostolini&quot; or &quot;Brothers of St. Barnabas&quot;), whose houses were in the province of Genoa and in the March of Ancona. This was an order that had been founded by Giovanni Scarpa at the end of the 15th century. The union  was confirmed by [[Pope Paul V]] in 1606, at which time the congregation added the name of St. Barnabas to its title, adopted new constitutions, divided its houses into four provinces, two of them, St Clement's and St Pancras's, being in Rome. Published works have survived from the pen of Ascanio Tasca and Michele Mulozzani, each of whom was superior-general, and of Zaccaria Visconti, Francesco-Maria Guazzi and Paolo Fabulotti. Although various Ambrosians were given the title of Blessed in recognition of their holiness: Antonio Gonzaga of Mantua, Filippo of Fermo, and Gerardo of Monza, the order was eventually dissolved by [[Pope Innocent X]] in 1650. 

===Nuns===
The Nuns of St Ambrose (Ambrosian Sisters) wore a habit of the same colour as the Brothers of St Ambrose, conformed to their constitutions, and followed the [[Ambrosian Rite]], but were independent in government. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] gave the nuns canonical status in 1474. Their one monastery was on the top of Monte Varese, near Lago Maggiore, on the spot where their foundress, the Blessed Catarina Morigia (or Catherine of Palanza), had first led a solitary life.  Other early nuns were the Blessed Juliana of Puriselli, Benedetta Bimia, and Lucia Alciata. The nuns were esteemed by St Charles Borromeo. 

Another group of cloistered &quot;Nuns of St Ambrose&quot;, also called the Annunciatae (Italian: ''Annunziate'') of Lombardy or &quot;Sisters of St Marcellina&quot;, were founded in 1408 by three young women of Pavia, Dorothea Morosini, Eleonora Contarini, and Veronica Duodi. Their houses, scattered throughout Lombardy and Venetia, were united into a congregation by St Pius V, under the Rule of St Augustine with a mother-house, residence of the prioress general, at Pavia. One of the nuns in this group was Saint [[Catharine Fieschi Adorno]], who died on September 14, 1510.

===Oblates of St. Ambrose and of St. Charles===
In some sense also &quot;Ambrosians&quot; are the members of a diocesan religious society founded by St [[Charles Borromeo]], Archbishop of Milan. All priests or destined to become priests, they took a simple vow of obedience to their bishop. The model for this was a society that already existed at Brescia, under the name of &quot;Priests of Peace&quot;. In August 1578 the new society was inaugurated, being entrusted with the church of the Holy Sepulchre and given the name of &quot;Oblates of St. Ambrose.&quot; They later received the approbation of Gregory XIII. St Charles died in 1584. These Oblates were dispersed by [[Napoleon I]] in 1810, while another group called the Oblates of Our Lady of Rho escaped this fate. In 1848 they were reorganized and given the name of &quot;Oblates of St. Charles&quot; and reassigned the house of the Holy Sepulchre. In the course of the 19th century similar groups were founded in a number of countries, including the &quot;Oblates of St Charles&quot;, established in London by Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
'''Ambrosiaster''' is the name given to the writer of a commentary on St [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] epistles, &quot;brief in words but weighty in matter,&quot; and valuable for the criticism of the [[Latin]] text of the [[New Testament]]. This commentary was erroneously attributed for a long time to St [[Ambrose]].

The commentary itself was written during the papacy of [[Pope Damasus I]], that is, between 366 and 384, and is considered an important document of the Latin text of Paul before the [[Vulgate]] of [[Jerome]], and of the interpretation of Paul prior to [[Augustine of Hippo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;/&gt;

In 1527 [[Erasmus]] threw doubt on the accuracy of ascribing the authorship of this document to Ambrose, and its author is now usually spoken of as Ambrosiaster, or pseudo-Ambrose.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last = Kinzig  | first = Wolfram  | contribution = Ambrosiaster  | year = 1996  | title = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]  | editor1-last = Hornblower  | editor1-first = Simon  | editor1-link =Simon Hornblower  | editor2-last = Spawforth  | editor2-first = Anthony  | editor2-link =Anthony Spawforth  | edition = 3rd  | place = Oxford  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | isbn = 0-19-521693-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] cites part of the commentary on [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] as by &quot;Sanctus Hilarius&quot; it has been ascribed by various critics at different times to almost every known Hilary. [[Germain Morin]] broke new ground by suggesting in 1899 that the writer was Isaac,&lt;ref&gt;''Rev. d'hist. et de litt. religieuses'', tom. iv. 97 f.&lt;/ref&gt; a converted Jew and writer of a tract on the Trinity and Incarnation, who was exiled to [[Spain]] in 378-380 and then relapsed to [[Judaism]]; but he afterwards abandoned this theory of the authorship in favour of [[Decimus Hilarianus Hilarius]], proconsul of [[North Africa during the Classical Period|Africa]] in 377.

With this attribution [[Alexander Souter]] agrees.&lt;ref&gt;''Study of Ambrosiaster'' (Cambridge Univ.  Press, 1905).&lt;/ref&gt; There is scarcely anything to be said for the possibility of Ambrose having written the book before he became a bishop, and added to it in later years, incorporating remarks of [[Hilary of Poitiers]] on Romans. The best presentation of the case for Ambrose is by [[P. A. Ballerini]] in his complete edition of that father's works. 

Several other minor works have been attributed to this same author. There is also the ''Quaestiones Veteris et Novi Testamenti,'' which manuscripts have traditionally ascribed to [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. Most scholars consider this work to be that of Pseudo-Ambrose as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;/&gt;

'''Ambrosius Aurelianus''', {{lang-cy|Emrys Wledig}}; called  '''Aurelius Ambrosius''' in the ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' and elsewhere, was a [[King of the Britons|war leader]] of the [[Romano-British]] who won an important battle against the [[Anglo-Saxons]] in the 5th century, according to [[Gildas]].  He also appeared independently in the legends of the Britons, beginning with the 9th-century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]''.

==Aurelianus according to Gildas==
Ambrosius Aurelianus is one of the few people that [[Gildas]] identifies by name in his sermon ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'', and the only one named from the 5th century.&lt;ref name=Fletcher_15&gt;{{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard|title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England|pages=15–16|year= 1989|publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn|isbn=0-85683-089-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the destructive assault of the Saxons, the survivors gather together under the leadership of Ambrosius, who is described as &quot;a gentleman who, perhaps alone of the Romans, had survived the shock of this notable storm. Certainly his parents, who had worn the purple, were slain by it. His descendants in our day have become greatly inferior to their grandfather's [''avita''] excellence.&quot;  We know from Gildas that he was of high birth, and had Roman ancestry; he was presumably a Romano-Briton, rather than a Roman from elsewhere in the empire, though it is impossible to be sure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fletcher_15&quot;/&gt;  It also appears that Ambrosius was a Christian: Gildas says that he won his battles &quot;with God's help&quot;.&lt;ref name=Fletcher_15/&gt; According to Gildas, Ambrosius organised the survivors into an armed force and achieved the first military victory over the Saxon invaders. However, this victory was not decisive: &quot;Sometimes the Saxons and sometimes the citizens [meaning the Romano-British inhabitants] were victorious.&quot;

Two points in this brief description have attracted much scholarly commentary. The first is what Gildas meant by saying Ambrosius' family &quot;had worn the purple&quot;: does this mean that Ambrosius was related to one of the [[Roman Emperor]]s, perhaps the [[House of Theodosius]] or an usurper like [[Constantine III (usurper)|Constantine III]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Roman males of the [[Patrician (Ancient Rome)|senatorial class]] wore clothes with a purple band to denote their class, so the reference to purple may be to his aristocratic heritage. In addition, [[Tribune#Tribune of the soldiers|Roman military tribunes]] (''tribuni militum''), senior officers in Roman legions, wore a similar purple band, so the purple may refer to military leadership background in his family. It has also been suggested that &quot;the purple&quot; is a euphemism for blood, and therefore &quot;wearing the purple&quot; may be a reference to martyrdom.&lt;ref name=Gidlow_80&gt;{{cite book |last= Gidlow|first= Christopher|title= The Reign of Arthur: From History to Legend|pages=80|year= 2004|publisher= Sutton Publishing|isbn=0-7509-3418-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second question is the meaning of the word ''avita'': as Gildas could have meant &quot;ancestors&quot;, or intended it to mean more specifically &quot;grandfather&quot;&amp;mdash;thus indicating Ambrosius lived about a generation before the [[Battle of Mons Badonicus]]. The lack of information for this period inhibits accurate answers to these questions.

==Other accounts of Aurelianus==
[[Bede]] follows Gildas' account of Ambrosius in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', but in his ''Chronica Majora'' he dates Ambrosius' victory to the reign of the [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]] (474-491). 

The ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' preserves several snippets of lore about Ambrosius. The most significant of these is the story about Ambrosius, [[Vortigern]], and the two [[dragon]]s beneath [[Dinas Emrys]], &quot;Fortress of Ambrosius&quot; in Chapters 40 – 42. This story was later retold with more detail by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in his fictionalized ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', conflating the personage of Ambrosius with the Welsh tradition of [[Merlin]] the visionary, known for [[Oracle|oracular]] utterances that foretold the coming victories of the native [[Celt]]ic inhabitants of Britain over the [[Saxons]] and the [[Normans]]. Geoffrey also names him as one of three sons of [[Constantine III (western emperor)|Constantine III]], along with [[Constans II (usurper)|Constans II]] and [[Uther Pendragon]].

But there are smaller snippets of tradition preserved in the ''Historia Brittonum'': in Chapter 31, we are told that Vortigern ruled in fear of Ambrosius; later, in Chapter 66, various events are dated from a battle of Guoloph (often identified with [[Middle Wallop|Wallop]], {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} ESE of [[Amesbury]] near [[Salisbury, England|Salisbury]]), which is said to have been between Ambrosius and Vitolinus; lastly, in Chapter 48, it is said that Pascent, the son of Vortigern, was granted rule over the regions of [[Buellt]] and [[Gwrtheyrnion]] by Ambrosius. It is not clear how these various traditions relate to each other, or whether they come from the same tradition; it is very possible that these references are to different men with the same name. The ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' dates the battle of Guoloph to &quot;the twelfth year of Vortigern&quot;, by which 437 seems to be meant. This is perhaps a generation before the battle that Gildas says were commanded by Ambrosius Aurelianus. 

At the end of the story in Chapters 40 – 42, [[Vortigern]] hands over to Ambrosius &quot;the fortress, with all of the kingdoms of the western part of Britain.&quot; In Chapter 48 Ambrosius Aurelianus is described as &quot;[[Kings of the Britons|king among all the kings of the British nation]]&quot;.  It is impossible to know to what degree he actually wielded political power, and over what area, but it is certainly possible that he ruled some part of England.&lt;ref name=Fletcher_15/&gt; [[Léon Fleuriot]] has suggested Ambrosius is identical to [[Riothamus]], a Brythonic leader who fought a major battle against the Goths in France around the year 470. Fleuriot argues that Ambrosius led the Britons in the battle, in which he was defeated and forced to retreat to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. He then returned to Britain to continue the war against the Saxons.&lt;ref name = &quot;leo&quot;&gt;Léon Fleuriot, ''Les origines de la Bretagne: l’émigration'', Paris,Payot, 1980, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because Ambrosius and Vortigern are shown in the ''Historia Brittonum'' as being in conflict, some historians have suspected that this preserves a historical core of the existence of two parties in opposition to one another, one headed by Ambrosius and the other by Vortigern. [[J. N. L. Myres]] built upon this suspicion and speculated that belief in [[Pelagianism]] reflected an actively provincial outlook in Britain and that Vortigern represented the Pelagian party, while Ambrosius led the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] one. Subsequent later historians accepted Myers' speculation as fact, creating a narrative of events in 5th century Britain with various degrees of elaborate detail. Yet a simpler alternative interpretation of the conflict between these two figures is that the ''Historia Brittonum'' is preserving traditions hostile to the purported descendants of Vortigern, who at this time were a ruling house in [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]]. This interpretation is supported by the negative character of all of the stories retold about Vortigern in the ''Historia Brittonum'', which include his alleged practice of [[incest]].&lt;ref&gt;As argued by Nora K. Chadwick, &quot;A Note on the Name Vortigern&quot; in ''Studies in Early British History'' (Cambridge: University Press, 1954), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambrosius Aurelianus appears in later pseudo-chronicle tradition beginning with [[Geoffrey of Monmouth|Geoffrey's]] ''Historiae Regum Britanniae'' with the slightly garbled name ''Aurelius Ambrosius'', now presented as son of a King Constantine. When King Constantine's eldest son Constans is murdered at Vortigern's instigation, the two remaining sons, Ambrosius and Uther, still very young, are quickly hustled into exile in [[Brittany]]. (This does not fit with Gildas' account in which Ambrosius' family perished in the turmoil of the Saxon uprisings.) Later, when Vortigern's power has faded, the two brothers return from exile with a large army, destroy Vortigern and become friends with [[Merlin]]. 

In Welsh, Ambrosius appears as ''Emrys Wledig'' (Emperor Ambrose). In [[Robert de Boron]]'s ''Merlin'' he is called simply ''Pendragon'' and his younger brother is named ''Uter'', which he changes to ''Uterpendragon'' after the death of the elder sibling. This is probably a confusion that entered oral tradition from [[Wace]]'s ''[[Roman de Brut]]''. Wace usually only refers to ''li roi'' (&quot;the king&quot;) without naming him, and someone has taken an early mention of Uther's epithet ''Pendragon'' as the name of his brother.

S. Appelbaum has suggested that Amesbury in [[Wiltshire]] might preserve in it the name of Ambrosius, and perhaps Amesbury was the seat of his power base in the later fifth century. Place name scholars have found a number of [[Toponymy|place names]] through the Midland dialect regions of Britain that incorporate the ''ambre-'' element: examples include [[Ombersley]] in [[Worcestershire]], [[Ambrosden]] in [[Oxfordshire]], Amberley in [[Herefordshire]], Amberley in [[Gloucestershire]] and Amberley castle in West Sussex. These scholars have claimed this element represents an [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''amor'', the name of a woodland bird. However, Amesbury in Wiltshire is in a different dialect region and does not easily fit into the pattern of the Midland dialect place names. If this etymology is combined with the tradition reported by Geoffrey of Monmouth stating that Ambrosius Aurelianus ordered the building of [[Stonehenge]] – which is located within the parish of Amesbury (and where Ambrosius was supposedly buried) – and with the presence of an [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]] also in that parish, then it may be tempting to connect Ambrosius with Amesbury.

==Ambrosius in popular culture==

The novel [[Coalescent]] by [[Stephen Baxter]] depicts Aurelianus as a General to Artorius, Briton, and basis for the legend of [[King Arthur]].  In Baxter's novel Aurelianus is a minor character who interacts with the book's main Roman-era protagonist, Regina, founder of an (literally) underground matriarchal society.  In the text, he is credited with winning the battle of [[Mount Badon]].  

In [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'', Aurelianus is depicted as the aging High King of Britain, a &quot;too-ambitious&quot; son of a Western Roman Emperor. His sister's son is [[Uther Pendragon]], but Uther is described as not having any Roman blood. Aurelianus is unable to gather the leadership of the native Celts, who refuse to follow any but their own race.

In [[Alfred Duggan]]'s ''[[Conscience of the King (novel)|Conscience of the King]]'', a [[historical novel]] about [[Cerdic of Wessex|Cerdic]], founder of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of [[Wessex]], Ambrosius Aurelianus is a Romano-British general who rose independently to military power, forming alliances with various British kings and setting out to drive the invading Saxons from [[Roman Britain|Britain]]. Cerdic, who is of both [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] and British descent and raised as a [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]], served in his army as a young man. In the novel Ambrosius is a separate character from Arthur, or Artorius, who appears much later as a foe of Cerdic.

In [[Stephen R. Lawhead]]'s ''[[Pendragon Cycle]]'', Aurelianus (most often referred to as &quot;Aurelius&quot;) figures prominently, along with his brother Uther, in the second book of the series, ''Merlin''. He is poisoned soon after becoming [[High King]] of Britain, and Uther succeeds him. Lawhead alters the standard Arthurian story somewhat, in that he has Aurelius marry [[Igraine]] and become the true father of King Arthur (Uther does marry his brother's widow, though).

In [[Valerio Massimo Manfredi]]'s ''[[The Last Legion]]'', Aurelianus (here called &quot;Aurelianus Ambrosius Ventidius&quot;) is a major character and is shown as one of the last loyal Romans, going to enormous lengths for his boy emperor [[Romulus Augustus]], whose power has been wrested by the barbarian [[Odoacer]]. In this story, Romulus Augustus marries [[Igraine]], and [[King Arthur]] is their son, and the sword of [[Julius Caesar]] becomes the legendary [[Excalibur]] in Britain. In the 2007 film version of the novel, he is played by [[Colin Firth]] and his name becomes &quot;Aurelianus Caius Antonius&quot;. In both he is called &quot;Aurelius&quot; for short.

[[Mary Stewart]]'s ''[[The Crystal Cave]]'' follows Geoffrey of Monmouth in calling him Aurelius Ambrosius and portrays him as the father of Merlin, the elder brother of Uther (hence uncle of Arthur), an initiate of [[Mithras]], and generally admired by everyone except the Saxons. Much of the book is set at his court in Brittany or during the campaign to retake his throne from Vortigern. Later books in the series show that Merlin's attitude toward Arthur is influenced by his belief that Arthur is a reincarnation of Ambrosius, who is seen through Merlin's eyes as a model of good kingship.

In [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s ''[[The Lantern Bearers (Sutcliff novel)|The Lantern Bearers]]'' Prince Ambrosius Aurelianus of Arfon drives out the Saxons by training his British army with Roman techniques and making effective use of cavalry. By the end of the novel, the elite cavalry wing is led by a dashing young warrior prince named Artos, whom Sutcliff postulates to be the real Arthur. 

In [[Jack Whyte]]'s ''[[Camulod Chronicles]]'', Ambrosius Aurelianus is the half-brother of Caius Merlyn Britannicus (Merlin) and helps him lead the people of Camulod ([[Camelot]]).

In [[Stargate SG-1]], Ambrosius and Arthur are one and the same. [[Moros (Stargate)|Merlin]] was an [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]], fleeing from [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]] and later Ascends, then comes back in order build the [[Sangraal (Stargate)|Sangraal]], or Holy Grail, to defeat the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]]. [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] also comments that it would mean that Ambrosius was 74 at the [[Battle of Mount Badon]].

'''Ammon''' ({{Hebrew Name|עַמּוֹן|Ammon|ʻAmmôn|&quot;People&quot;}}; {{lang-ar-at|a=عمّون|t=ʻAmmūn}}), also referred to as the '''Ammonites''' and '''children of Ammon''', was an ancient nation located east of the [[Jordan River]], [[Gilead]], and the [[Dead Sea]], in present-day [[Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Texts Relating to the Bible: Amman Citadel|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/educational_site/ancient_texts/Citadel.shtml|accessdate=2011-01-11|publisher=[[University of Southern California]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Ammon |last=MacDonald |first=Burton |coauthors=Randall W.

[[Moloch|Milcom]] and [[Moloch|Molech]] (who may be one and the same) are named in the Bible as the gods of Ammon.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:05-33|NIV}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|23:13|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Bible==

According to the biblical account, {{bibleverse||Genesis|19:37-38|NIV}}, Ammon and [[Moab]] were born to [[Lot (biblical)|Lot]] and Lot's younger and elder daughters, respectively, in the aftermath of the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. The Bible refers to both the Ammonites and Moabites as the &quot;children of Lot&quot;. Throughout the Bible, the Ammonites and Israelites are portrayed as mutual antagonists. During the [[The Exodus|Exodus]], the Israelites were prohibited by the Ammonites from passing through their lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Deuteronomy|23:4|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Book of Judges]], the Ammonites work with [[Eglon (king)|Eglon]], king of the Moabites against Israel. Attacks by the Ammonites on Israelite communities east of the Jordan were the impetus behind the unification of the tribes under [[Saul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|11:1-15|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to both {{bibleverse|1|Kings|14:21-31|NIV}} and {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|12:13|NIV}}, [[Naamah (wife of Solomon)|Naamah]] was an Ammonite. She was the only wife of King [[Solomon]] to be mentioned by name in the [[Tanakh]] as having borne a child. She was the mother of Solomon's successor, [[Rehoboam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = |first = |title = The Jewish Encyclopedia|date = |url = http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1&amp;letter=N|accessdate = 2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ammonites presented a serious problem to the [[Pharisees]] because many marriages with Ammonite (and Moabite) wives had taken place in the days of [[Nehemiah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Nehemiah|13:23|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The men had married women of the various nations without conversion, which made the children not Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;The identity of those particular tribes had been lost during the ''mixing of the nations'' caused by the conquests of [[Assyria]]. As a result, people from those nations were treated as complete gentiles and could convert without restriction.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legitimacy of [[David]]'s claim to royalty was disputed on account of his descent from Ruth, the Moabite.&lt;ref&gt;The Babylonian [[Talmud]] points out that [[Doeg the Edomite]] was the source of this dispute. He claimed that since David was descended from someone who was not allowed to marry into the community, his male ancestors were no longer part of the tribe of [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]] (which was the tribe the King had to belong to).  As a result, he could neither be the king, nor could he marry any Jewish woman (since he descended from a [[Moab]]ite convert). The Prophet [[Samuel]] wrote the Book of Ruth in order to remind the people of the original law that women from [[Moab]] and Ammon were allowed to convert and marry into the Jewish people immediately.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to Assyria==
Ammon maintained its independence from the [[Assyria]]n empire through tribute to the Assyrian king, at a time when nearby kingdoms were being raided or conquered.&lt;ref name = Jordan/&gt; [[Kurkh Monolith|Inscriptions describe]] the Ammonite king [[Baasha ben Ruhubi]]'s army fighting alongside [[Ahab]] of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Syria]]n allies against [[Shalmaneser III]] at the [[Battle of Qarqar]] in 853 BC, possibly as vassals of [[Hadadezer]], the Aramaean king of [[Aram Damascus|Damascus]]. In 734 BC the Ammonite king [[Sanipu]] was a vassal of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], and Sanipu's successor [[Pudu-ilu]] held the same position under [[Sennacherib]] and [[Esarhaddon]]. An Assyrian tribute-list exists from this period, showing that Ammon paid one-fifth of Judah's tribute.&lt;ref&gt;See Schrader, ''K.A.T.'' pp. 141 et seq.; Delitzsch, ''Paradies,'' p. 294; Winckler, ''Geschichte Israels,'' p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhat later, the Ammonite king [[Amminadab (Ammon)|Amminadab I]] was among the tributaries who suffered in the course of the great [[Arabia]]n campaign of [[Assurbanipal]]. Other kings attested to in contemporary sources are [[Barakel]] (attested to in several contemporary [[seal (device)|seals]]) and [[Hissalel]], the latter of whom reigned about 620 BCE. Hissalel is mentioned in an inscription on a bottle found at [[Tel Siran]], Jordan along with his son, King Amminadab II, who reigned around 600 BCE.

==In the Persian, Maccabee, and Roman eras==
Little mention is made of the Ammonites through the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and early [[Hellenistic Age|Hellenistic]] periods. Their name appears, however, during the time of the [[Maccabees]]. The Ammonites, with some of the neighboring tribes, did their utmost to resist and check the revival of the Jewish power under [[Judas Maccabaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[1 Maccabees]] 5:6; cf. [[Josephus]] ''[[Jewish Antiquities]]'' xii. 8. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last notice of the Ammonites is in [[Justin Martyr]] (second century) ''Dialogue with Trypho'' (§ 119), where it is affirmed that they were still a numerous people, concentrated in the south of [[Palestine]].

==Language==
{{Main|Ammonite language}}
The few Ammonite names that have been preserved also include Nahash and [[Hanun (disambiguation)|Hanun]], both from the Bible. The Ammonites's language is believed to be [[Semitic]], closely related to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Moabite language|Moabite]]. Ammonite may have incorporated certain [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] influences, including the use of ''‘bd'', instead of commoner Biblical Hebrew ''‘śh'', for &quot;work&quot;. The only other notable difference with Biblical Hebrew is the sporadic retention of feminine singular ''-t'' (e.g. ''’šħt'' &quot;cistern&quot;, but ''‘lyh'' &quot;high (fem.)&quot;.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Cohen|first = D (ed)|year = 1988|title = Les langues dans le monde ancien et modern, part 3|chapter = Les Langues Chamito-semitiques|publisher = [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|CNRS]]|location = Paris}}{{cite book|last = Aufrecht|first = WE|title = A Corpus of Ammonite Inscriptions|isbn = 0-88946-089-2|location =  Lewiston|publisher = E. Mellen Press|year = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Like its sister-kingdom of Moab, Ammon was the source of numerous natural resources, including [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]]. It had a productive agricultural sector and occupied a vital place along the [[King's Highway (ancient)|King's Highway]], the ancient trade route connecting [[Egypt]] with [[Mesopotamia]], [[Syria]], and [[Anatolia]]. As with the Edomites and Moabites, trade along this route gave them considerable revenue. Circa 950 BCE Ammon showed rising prosperity, due to [[agriculture]] and [[trade]], and built a series of fortresses. Its capital was located in what is now the Citadel of [[Amman]].&lt;ref name = Jordan&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_testament.html|title = The Old Testament Kingdoms of Jordan|accessdate = 2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ammonius Hermiae''' ({{lang-el|Ἀμμώνιος ὁ Ἑρμείου}}; c. 440-c. 520) was a [[Byzantine Empire|Greek]] [[philosopher]], and the son of the [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers [[Hermias (philosopher)|Hermias]] and [[Aedesia]]. He was a pupil of [[Proclus]] in [[Athens]], and taught at [[Alexandria]] for most of his life, writing commentaries on [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and other philosophers.

==Life==
Ammonius' father, [[Hermias]], died when he was a child, and his mother, Aedesia, raised him and his brother, [[Heliodorus of Alexandria|Heliodorus]], in [[Alexandria]]. When they reached adulthood, Aedesia accompanied her sons to [[Athens]] where they studied under [[Proclus]]. Eventually, they returned to Alexandria, where Ammonius, as head of the Neoplatonist school in Alexandria, lectured on [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] for the rest of his life. According to [[Damascius]], during the persecution of the [[paganism|pagans]] at Alexandria in the late 480's, Ammonius made concessions to the [[Christian]] authorities so that he could continue his lectures.&lt;ref&gt;Damascius, ''Philosophos Historia'', 118B, Athanassiadi&lt;/ref&gt; Damascius, who scolds Ammonius for the agreement that he made, does not say what the concessions were, but it may have involved limitations on the doctrines he could teach or promote. He was still teaching in 515, since [[Olympiodorus the Younger|Olympiodorus]] heard him lecture on [[Plato]]'s ''Gorgias'' in that year.&lt;ref&gt;Olympiodorus, ''in Gorgias'', 199, 8-10&lt;/ref&gt; He also taught [[Asclepius of Tralles]], [[John Philoponus]], [[Damascius]] and [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]].

==Writings==
Of his reputedly numerous writings, only his commentary on Aristotle's ''De Interpretatione'' survives intact. A commentary on [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''Isagogue'' may also be his, but it is somewhat corrupt and contains later interpolations.

In ''De Interpretatione,'' Ammonius contends that divine foreknowledge makes void the contingent. Like
[[Boethius]] in his second ''Commentary'' and ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]],'' this argument maintains the effectiveness of prayer. Ammonius cites [[Iamblichus]] who said ''knowledge is intermediate between the knower and the known, since it is the activity of the knower concerning the known.''&lt;ref&gt;
''Medieval Philosophy and the Classical Tradition'', Curzon Press, John Inglis, 2002, pg. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are some notes of Ammonius' lectures written by various students which also survive:

*On Aristotle's ''Categories'' (anonymous writer)
*On Aristotle's ''Prior Analytics I'' (anonymous writer)
*On Aristotle's ''Metaphysics 1-7'' (written by [[Asclepius of Tralles|Asclepius]])
*On [[Nicomachus]]' ''Introduction to Arithmetic'' (written by Asclepius)
*On Aristotle's ''Prior Analytics'' (written by [[John Philoponus]])
*On Aristotle's ''Posterior Analytics'' (written by John Philoponus)
*On Aristotle's ''On Generation and Corruption'' (written by John Philoponus)
*On Aristotle's ''On the Soul'' (written by John Philoponus)

He was also an accomplished [[astronomer]]; he lectured on [[Ptolemy]] and is known to have written a treatise on the [[astrolabe]].

:''For the author of the early Gospel synopsis please see'': [[Ammonius of Alexandria (Christian)|Ammonius of Alexandria]]

'''Ammonius Saccas''' (3rd century AD) ({{lang-grc|Ἀμμώνιος Σακκᾶς}}) was a Greek [[philosopher]] from [[Alexandria]] who was often referred to as one of the founders of [[Neoplatonism]]. He is mainly known as the teacher of [[Plotinus]], whom he taught for eleven years from 232 to 243. He was undoubtably the biggest influence on Plotinus in his development of [[Neoplatonism]], although little is known about his own philosophical views. Later [[Christian]] writers stated that Ammonius was a Christian, but it is now generally assumed that there was a different [[Ammonius of Alexandria (Christian)|Ammonius of Alexandria]] who wrote biblical texts.

==Life==
Not much is known about the life of Ammonius Saccas. He had a humble background, and appears to have earned a living as a [[Porter (carrier)|porter]] at the docks of [[Alexandria]], hence his nickname of &quot;Sack-bearer&quot; (''Sakkas'' for ''sakkophoros''). Most details of his life come from the fragments left from [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s writings. The most famous pupil of Ammonius Saccas was [[Plotinus]] who studied under Ammonius for eleven years. According to Porphyry, in 232, at the age of 28, Plotinus went to [[Alexandria]] to study philosophy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In his twenty-eighth year he [Plotinus] felt the impulse to study philosophy and was recommended to the teachers in Alexandria who then had the highest reputation; but he came away from their lectures so depressed and full of sadness that he told his trouble to one of his friends. The friend, understanding the desire of his heart, sent him to Ammonius, whom he had not so far tried. He went and heard him, and said to his friend, &quot;This is the man I was looking for.&quot; From that day he stayed continually with Ammonius and acquired so complete a training in philosophy that he became eager to make acquaintance with the Persian philosophical discipline and that prevailing among the Indians.&lt;ref name=&quot;porphyry1&quot;&gt;Porphyry, ''Life of Plotinus'', from Reale, G., (1990), ''A History of Ancient Philosophy IV: The Schools of the Imperial Age.'' Page 298. SUNY Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Porphyry, the parents of Ammonius were [[Christians]], but upon learning Greek philosophy, Ammonius rejected his parents' religion for [[paganism]]. This conversion is contested by the Christian writers [[Jerome]] and [[Eusebius]], who state that Ammonius remained a Christian throughout his lifetime:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Porphyry] plainly utters a falsehood (for what will not an opposer of Christians do?) when he says that ... Ammonius fell from a life of piety into heathen customs. ... Ammonius held the divine philosophy unshaken and unadulterated to the end of his life. His works yet extant show this, as he is celebrated among many for the writings which he has left.&lt;ref name=&quot;eusebius1&quot;&gt;Eusebius, ''History of the Church'', vi, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However we are told by [[Cassius Longinus (philosopher)|Longinus]] that Ammonius wrote nothing,&lt;ref&gt;Longinus, quoted by Porphyry, ''Life of Plotinus'', xx.&lt;/ref&gt; and if Ammonius was the principal influence on Plotinus, then it is unlikely that Ammonius would have been a Christian. One way to explain much of the confusion concerning Ammonius is to assume that there were two people called Ammonius: Ammonius Saccas who taught Plotinus, and an [[Ammonius of Alexandria (Christian)|Ammonius the Christian]] who wrote biblical texts.

To add to the confusion, it seems that Ammonius had two pupils called Origen: [[Origen|Origen the Christian]], and [[Origen the Pagan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eusebius1&quot;/&gt; It is quite possible that Ammonius Saccas taught both Origens. Among Ammonius' other pupils there were [[Herennius (Neoplatonist)|Herennius]] and [[Cassius Longinus (philosopher)|Cassius Longinus]].

==Philosophy==
[[Hierocles of Alexandria|Hierocles]], writing in the 5th century, states that Ammonius' fundamental doctrine was that [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] were in full agreement with each other:&lt;ref&gt;Hierocles in Photius, ''Bibl.'' cod. 214, 251.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;He was the first who had a godly zeal for the truth in philosophy and despised the views of the majority, which were a disgrace to philosophy. He apprehended well the views of each of the two philosophers [Plato and Aristotle] and brought them under one and the same ''[[nous]]'' and transmitted philosophy without conflicts to all of his disciples, and especially to the best of those acquainted with him, Plotinus, Origen, and their successors.&lt;ref&gt;Hierocles, in Photius, ''Bibl.'' cod. 251. from Karamanolis, G., (2006), ''Plato and Aristotle in Agreement?: Platonists on Aristotle from Antiochus to Porphyry'', Page 193. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Nemesius]], a [[bishop]] and [[Neoplatonist]] c. 400,  Ammonius held that the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] was immaterial.&lt;ref&gt;Nemesius, ''On the Nature of Man'', ii&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about Ammonius's role in the development of [[Neoplatonism]]. Porphyry seems to suggest that Ammonius was instrumental in helping Plotinus think about philosophy in new ways:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But he [Plotinus] did not just speak straight out of these books but took a distinctive personal line in his consideration, and brought the mind of Ammonius' to bear on the investigation in hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;porphyry1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Two of Ammonius's students - [[Origen the Pagan]], and [[Cassius Longinus (philosopher)|Longinus]] - seem to have held philosophical positions which were closer to [[Middle Platonism]] than Neoplatonism, which perhaps suggests that Ammonius's doctrines were also closer to those of Middle Platonism than the Neoplatonism developed by Plotinus (see the [[Enneads]]), but Plotinus does not seem to have thought that he was departing in any significant way from that of his master.

The '''Book of Amos''' is a prophetic book of the [[Hebrew Bible]], one of the [[Twelve Minor Prophets]]. [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]], an older contemporary of [[Hosea]] and [[Isaiah]],&lt;ref name =&quot;Harris&quot;&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], ''Understanding the Bible''. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; was active c. 750 BCE during the reign of [[Jeroboam II]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt; making the Book of Amos the first biblical prophetic book written. Amos lived in the kingdom of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] but preached in the northern kingdom of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt; His major themes of [[social justice]], God's [[omnipotence]], and [[divine judgment]] became staples of prophecy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt;

==Authorship==
Amos was a [[prophet]] during the reign of Jeroboam ben Joash ([[Jeroboam II]]), ruler of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] from 793  BCE to 753 BCE, and the reign of Uzziah, King of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], at a time when both kingdoms (Israel in the North and Judah in the South) were peaking in prosperity. He was a contemporary of the prophet [[Hosea]], but likely preceded him. Many of the earlier accounts of prophets found in the [[Old Testament]] are found within the context of other accounts of Israel's history. Amos, however, is the first prophet whose name also serves as the title of the corresponding biblical book in which his story is found. Amos also made it a point that before his calling he was a simple husbandman and that he was not a &quot;professional&quot; prophet of the prophetic guild.

==Time of ministry==
{{Books of the Old Testament}}
Most scholars believe that [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] gave his message in the autumn of 750 BCE or 749 BCE.  It is generally understood{{Who|date=January 2010}} that his preaching at [[Bethel]] lasted only a single day at the least and a few days at the most. Leading up to this time, Assyrian armies battled against [[Damascus]] for a number of years, which greatly diminished Syria's threat to [[Israel]]. As a result of the fighting amongst its neighbors, Israel had the benefit of increasing its borders almost to those of the time of [[David (biblical king)|David]] and [[Solomon]].

It should also be noted that Amos preached about two years before a very large earthquake, and made reference to it twice in his book. [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]] remembers this earthquake over 200 years later.

==Place where written==
Some scholars believe that [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]]'s message was recorded after he delivered it to the Northern Kingdom, upon returning to his southern homeland of [[Tuqu'|Tekoa]], a town eight kilometres south of [[Bethlehem]]. It is mentioned many times in the [[Old Testament]] ([[Joshua]] 15:39, [[2 Samuel]] 14:9 and 23:26, [[1 Chronicles]] 11:28). [[Rehoboam]] is reported to have fortified Tekoa along with other cities in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] in [[2 Chronicles]] 11:5-6. 

There are some differing opinions as to the location of the Tekoa Amos was presumably from. It is believed by most that Amos was a southern farmer, called by [[God]] to deliver his prophetic message in the North. However, some believe that Amos was actually from a Tekoa in the North, near [[Galilee]]. They believe that it is more probable that Amos was from the North because it has conditions more suitable for the cultivation of sycamore figs than the Tekoa of the South. Sycamore figs grow at a low elevation, lower than the Tekoa of Judah, which is at a relatively high elevation of 850 metres (overlooking both [[Jerusalem]] and [[Bethlehem]]). Others have discredited the theory about the Galilean Tekoa, citing that the difference in elevation between the two locations is not significant. Scholars in support of the idea of Amos being from the North also say it makes more sense because of Amaziah's accusation of conspiracy found in chapter seven, verse 10. A conspirator, they argue, is more likely to be a national. 

Two other opinions of where Amos's writings were recorded deserve mention. They are that 1) disciples of Amos followed him and recorded his message and 2) that someone in his audience in the North recorded his message.

==Purpose==
The Book of Amos is set in a time when the people of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] have reached a low point in their devotion to [[YHWH]](the [[God of Israel]]) - the people have become greedy and have stopped following and adhering to their values. The wealthy elite are becoming rich at the expense of others. Peasant farmers who once practiced subsistence farming are being forced to farm what is best for foreign trade, mostly wine and oil. 

YHWH speaks to Amos, a farmer and herder, and tells him to go to [[Samaria]], the capital of the Northern kingdom. Through Amos, God tells the people that he is going to judge Israel for its sins, and it will be a foreign nation that will enact his judgment. 

The people understand judgment as the coming of &quot;the Day of the Lord.&quot; &quot;The Day of the Lord&quot; was widely celebrated and highly anticipated by the followers of God. However, Amos came to tell the people that &quot;the Day of the Lord&quot; was coming soon and that it meant divine judgment and justice for their own iniquity.

===The Day of the Lord===
Amos is the first prophet to use the term &quot;[[the Day of the Lord]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, M. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context. (Oxford University Press: Oxford 2009). p260&lt;/ref&gt; This phrase becomes important within future prophetic and apocalyptic literature. For the people of Israel &quot;the day of the Lord&quot; is the day when [[YHWH]] will fight against theirs and his enemies, and it will be a day of victory for Israel. However, Amos and other prophets include Israel as an enemy of YHWH. According to Amos, Israel is guilty of injustice toward the innocent, poor, and young women.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, M. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context. (Oxford University Press: Oxford 2009). p258-259&lt;/ref&gt; As punishment YHWH's vengeance would be directed against Israel, and the prophet warns his audience: &quot;Is not the day of the Lord darkness, not light, and gloom with no brightness in it?&quot; (Amos 5:20) The &quot;day of the Lord&quot; for the people of Israel is not a day of celebration.

==Themes==
Scholars{{Who|date=November 2009}} break the book of Amos up into three sections. Chapters one and two look at the nations surrounding [[Israel]] and then Israel itself through an ethical lens. Chapters three to six are a collection of verses that look more specifically at Israel's transgressions. Chapters seven to nine include visions that YHWH gave Amos as well as Amaziah's rebuke of the prophet. The last section of the book (7:1 to 9:8), commonly referred to as the Book of Visions, contains the only narrative section. 
In the first two visions, [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] is able to convince God not to act out the scenes of discipline presented to him. The ideas of discipline and justice, although not enacted here, correspond to the central message in what some refer to as the Book of Woes (5:1 to 6:14). This message can be seen most clearly in verse 24 of chapter five. The plagues in the preceding chapter, chapter four, were supposed to be seen as acts of discipline that turned Israel back to God. However, the people did not interpret the acts this way, and the discipline turned into judgment for the people's disobedience. In the second set of visions (7:7-9) there is no intercession by Amos, and God says that he &quot;will never pass by them again.&quot; The plight of Israel has become hopeless. [[God]] will not hold back judgment because Israel refuses to listen to the prophets and even goes so far as to try to silence them (2:12, 3:8, 7:10-17). 

The central idea{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} of the book of Amos is that God puts his people on the same level as the nations that surround it - God expects the same purity of them all . As it is with all nations that rise up against the kingdom of God, even Israel and Judah will not be exempt from the judgment of God because of their idolatry and unjust ways. The nation that represents YHWH must be made pure of anything or anyone that profanes the name of God. God's name must be exalted. 

Other major ideas in the book of Amos include: [[social justice]] and concern for the disadvantaged; the idea that Israel's [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with God did not exempt them from his position on sin; God is God of all nations; God is judge of all nations; God is God of moral righteousness; God made all people; God elected Israel and then redeemed Israel so that he would be known throughout the world; election by God means that those elected are responsible to live according to the purposes clearly outlined to them in the law; God will only destroy the unjust and a remnant will remain; and God is free to judge, redeem and act as savior to Israel.

==Highlighted activities within Amos==
The Book of Amos contains several different key activities and genres which are used to expound upon its themes. The following are a few examples &lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan, ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament'' (New York: Oxford, 2009), 256.&lt;/ref&gt;:

'''Amphipolis''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀμφίπολις}} &amp;ndash; ''Amphípolis'') was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient]] [[Greece|Greek]] [[Polis|city]] in the region once inhabited by the [[Edoni]] people in the present-day [[Peripheries of Greece|periphery]] of [[Central Macedonia]]. It was built on a raised plateau overlooking the east bank of the [[river]] [[Struma (river)|Strymon]] where it emerged from Lake Cercinitis, about 3 m. from the [[Aegean Sea]]. Founded in 437 BC, the city was finally abandoned in the 8th century AD. The present village Amfipoli ({{lang-el|Αμφίπολη}}), named after the ancient city, occupies the site. It is a municipality in the [[Serres (peripheral unit)|Serres peripheral unit]] of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Greece]]. The seat of the municipality is [[Rodolivos]].&lt;ref name=Kallikratis&gt;[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Amphipolis Strymon.jpg|thumb|left|View of the delta of Strymon river from the acropolis of Amphipolis.]]
[[File:Amphipolis Cousinery.jpg|thumb|left|The ruins of Amphipolis as seen by E. Cousinéry in 1831: the bridge over Strymon, the city fortifications and the Acropolis.]]

===Origins===
[[Archaeology]] has uncovered remains at the site dating to approximately 3000 BC.  Due to the strategic location of the site it was fortified from very early.In the 8th and 7th century BC the site of Amphipolis was ruled by [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boardman|first=John|title=The prehistory of the Balkans and the Middle East and the Aegean world, tenth to eighth centuries B.C.|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vXljf8JqmkoC&amp;pg=PA655&amp;dq=Vergina+Illyrian&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oB9PTKfaGMmisQbTvdG_AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Vergina%20Illyrian&amp;f=false|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521224969|page=655}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes I]] [[Persia|of Persia]] passed during his invasion of Greece of 480 BC and buried alive nine young men and nine maidens as a sacrifice to the river god.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Near the later site of Amphipolis [[Alexander I of Macedon|Alexander I]] [[Macedon|of Macedon]] defeated the remains of Xerxes' army in 479 BC.

Throughout the 5th century BC, [[Delian League|Athens]] sought to consolidate its control over Thrace, which was strategically important because of its primary materials (the gold and silver of the [[Pangaion hills]] and the dense forests essential for naval construction), and the sea routes vital for Athens' supply of grain from [[Scythia]]. After a first unsuccessful attempt at colonisation in 497 BC by the [[Miletus|Milesian]] [[Tyrant]] [[Histiaeus]], the Athenians founded a first colony at Ennea-Hodoi (‘Nine Ways’) in 465, but these first ten thousand colonists were massacred by the [[Thracians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]] I, 100, 3&lt;/ref&gt; A second attempt took place in 437 BC on the same site under the guidance of [[Hagnon]], son of [[Nicias]].

[[File:Plan Amphipolis-en.svg|thumb|250px|Map of Amphipolis.]]

The new settlement took the name of Amphipolis (literally, &quot;around the city&quot;), a name which is the subject of much debates about [[lexicography]]. Thucydides claims the name comes from the fact that the Strymon flows &quot;around the city&quot; on two sides;&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&amp;layout=&amp;loc=4.102.3 Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; however a note in the [[Suda]] (also given in the lexicon of [[Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]) offers a different explanation apparently given by [[Marsyas]], son of [[Periander]]: that a large proportion of the population lived &quot;around the city&quot;. However, a more probable explanation is the one given by [[Julius Pollux]]: that the name indicates the vicinity of an [[isthmus]]. Furthermore, the [[Etymologicum Genuinum]] gives the following definition: a city of the Athenians or of Thrace, which was once called Nine Routes, (so named) because it is encircled and surrounded by the Strymon river. This description corresponds to the actual site of the city (see adjacent map), and to the description of Thucydides.

Amphipolis subsequently became the main power base of the Athenians in Thrace and, consequently, a target of choice for their [[Sparta]]n adversaries. The Athenian population remained very much in the minority within the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200;query=chapter%3D%23471;layout=;loc=4.105.1 Thucydide, IV.105.1=4.105&lt;/ref&gt; A rescue expedition led by the Athenian strategos (general, and later historian) Thucydides had to settle for securing [[Eion]] and could not retake Amphipolis, a failure for which Thucydides was sentenced to exile. A new Athenian force under the command of [[Cleon]] failed once more in 422 BC during a [[Battle of Amphipolis|battle]] at which both Cleon and [[Brasidas]] lost their lives. Brasidas survived long enough to hear of the defeat of the Athenians and was buried at Amphipolis with impressive pomp. From then on he was regarded as the founder of the city&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200;query=chapter%3D%23511;layout=;loc=5.10.1 Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koukouli-Chrysanthaki Ch., &quot;Excavating Classical Amphipoli&quot;, In (eds) Stamatopoulou M., and M., Yeroulanou &lt;Excavating Classical Culture&gt;, BAR International Series 1031, 2002:57-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agelarakis A., “Physical anthropological report on the cremated human remains of an individual retrieved from the Amphipolis agora”, In “Excvating Classical Amphipolis” by Koukouli-Chrysantkai Ch., &lt;Excavating Classical Culture&gt; (eds.) Stamatopoulou M., and M., Yeroulanou, BAR International Series 1031, 2002: 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt;  
and honoured with yearly games and sacrifices. The city itself kept its independence until the reign of the king [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] despite several other Athenian attacks, notably because of the government of [[Callistratus of Aphidnae|Callistratus]] [[Afidnes|of Aphidnae]].

===Conquest by the Romans===
[[File:Amphipolis fortifications.jpg|thumb|[[Fortification]]s and [[bridge]] of Amphipolis.]]

In 357 BC, Philip removed the block which Amphipolis presented on the road to Macedonian control over Thrace by conquering the town, which Athens had tried in vain to recover during the previous years. According the historian [[Theopompus]], this conquest came to be the object of a secret accord between [[Athens]] and Philip II, who would return the city in exchange for the fortified town of [[Pydna]], but the Macedonian king betrayed the accord, refusing to cede Amphipolis and laying siege to Pydna.

After the conquest by Philip II, the city was not immediately incorporated into the kingdom, and for some time preserved its institutions and a certain degree of autonomy. The border of Macedonia was not moved further east; however, Philip sent a number of Macedonians governors to Amphipolis, and in many respects the city was effectively ‘Macedonianized’. Nomenclature, the calendar and the currency (the [[Stater|gold stater]], installed by Philip to capitalise on the gold reserves of the Pangaion hills, replaced the Amphipolitan [[drachma]]) were all replaced by Macedonian equivalents. In the reign of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], Amphipolis was an important naval base, and the birthplace of three of the most famous Macedonian [[Admirals]]: [[Nearchus]], Androsthenes&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?um=1&amp;q=Androsthenes+Thasos&amp;btnG=Search+Books&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Laomedon of Mytilene|Laomedon]] whose burial place is most likely marked by the famous lion of Amphipolis.

Amphipolis became one of the main stops on the Macedonian royal road (as testified by a border stone found between [[Philippi]] and Amphipolis giving the distance to the latter), and later on the ‘[[Via Egnatia]]’, the principal [[Roman Road]] which crossed the southern Balkans. Apart from the ramparts of the lower town (see photograph), the gymnasium and a set of well-preserved frescoes from a wealthy villa are the only artifacts from this period that remain visible. Though little is known of the layout of the town, modern knowledge of its institutions is in considerably better shape thanks to a rich epigraphic documentation, including a military ordinance of [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] and an [[Ephebarchy|ephebarchic]] (?) law from the gymnasium. After the final victory of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] over Macedonia in a [[Battle of Pydna|battle]] in 168 BC, Amphipolis became the capital one of the four mini-republics, or ‘merides’, which were created by the Romans out of the kingdom of the [[Antigonid Dynasty|Antigonids]] which [[Alexander the Great#Legacy and division of the empire|succeeded]] Alexander’s Empire in Macedon. These 'merides' were gradually incorporated into the Roman client state, and later province, of [[Thracia]].

[[File:Amphipolis, Löwe.jpg|thumb|The &quot;Amphipolis Lion&quot;.]]

===Revival in Late Antiquity===
During the period of [[Late Antiquity]], Amphipolis benefited from the increasing economic prosperity of Macedonia, as is evidenced by the large number of [[Christianity|Christian Churches]] that were built. Significantly however, these churches were built within a restricted area of the town, sheltered by the walls of the [[acropolis]]. This has been taken as evidence that the large fortified perimeter of the ancient town was no longer defendable, and that the population of the city had considerably diminished.

Nevertheless, the number, size and quality of the churches constructed between the fifth and sixth centuries are impressive. Four [[basilica]]s adorned with rich [[mosaic]] floors and elaborate architectural sculptures (such as the ram-headed [[column]] capitals - see picture) have been excavated, as well as a church with a hexagonal central plan which evokes that of the [[Basilica of San Vitale|basilica]] of [[Saint Vitalis of Milan|St. Vitalis]] in [[Ravenna]]. It is difficult to find reasons for such municipal extravagance in such a small town. One possible explanation provided by the historian [[André Boulanger]] is that an increasing ‘willingness’ on the part of the wealthy upper classes in the late Roman period to spend money on local [[gentrification]] projects (which he terms ‘'[[évergétisme]]’', from the Greek verb εύεργετέω,(meaning ‘I do good’) was exploited by the local church to its advantage, which led to a mass gentrification of the urban centre and of the agricultural riches of the city’s territory. Amphipolis was also a [[diocese]] under the [[suffragan]] of [[Thessaloniki]] - the Bishop of Amphipolis is first mentioned in 533 AD.

===From the reduction of the urban area to the disappearance of the city===

The [[Human migration#The great migrations|Slavic invasions]] of the late 6th century gradually encroached on the back-country Amphipolitan lifestyle and led to the decline of the town, during which period its inhabitants retreated to the area around the acropolis. The ramparts were maintained to a certain extent, thanks to materials plundered from the monuments of the lower city, and the large unused cisterns of the upper city were occupied by small houses and the workshops of artisans. Around the middle of the 7th century AD, a further reduction of the inhabited area of the city was followed by an increase in the fortification of the town, with the construction of a new rampart with pentagonal towers cutting through the middle of the remaining monuments. The acropolis, the [[Thermae|Roman baths]], and especially the Episcopal basilica were crossed by this wall.

The city was probably abandoned in the eighth century, as the last bishop was attested in 787. Its inhabitants probably moved to the neighbouring site of ancient Eion, port of Amphipolis, which had been rebuilt and refortified in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]]  under the name “[[Chrysopolis]]”. This small port continued to enjoy some prosperity, before being abandoned during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman period]]. The last recorded sign of activity in the region of Amphipolis was the construction of a fortified tower to the north in 1367 by [[Grand Primicier]] Jean and the [[Stratopedarque]] Alexis to protect the land that they had given to the monastery of Pantokrator on [[Mount Athos]].

==Archaeology==
[[File:Amphipolis frescoes.jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] from a house (Hellenistic period).]]

The site was rediscovered and described by many travellers and archaeologists during  the 19th century, including E. Cousinéry (1831) (engraver), L. Heuzey (1861), and P. Perdrizet (1894–1899). In 1934, M. Feyel, of the [[École française d'Athènes]], led an [[epigraphy|epigraphical mission]] to the site and uncovered the remains of a funeral lion (a reconstruction was given in the,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cefael.efa.gr/detail.php?site_id=1&amp;actionID=page&amp;prevpos=0&amp;serie_id=BCH&amp;volume_number=59&amp;issue_number=0&amp;startpos=289 Bulletin de Correspondance Hellénique] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; a publication of the EfA which is available on line). However, excavations did not truly begin until after the Second World War. The [[Archaeological Society of Athens|Greek Archaeological Society]] under D. Lazaridis excavated in 1972 and 1985, uncovering a necropolis, the rampart of the old town (see photograph), the basilicas, and the acropolis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{For||Amram (disambiguation)|Imran (disambiguation)}}
In the [[Book of Exodus]], '''Amram''' ({{Hebrew Name|עַמְרָם|Amram|ʻAmrām|''Friend of the most high''/''The people are exalted''}}) [[Arabic]] عمران Imran , is the father of [[Aaron]], [[Moses]], and [[Miriam]] and the husband of [[Jochebed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|6:20|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Bible==
In addition to being married to Jochebed, Amram is also described in the Bible as having been related to Jochebed prior to the marriage, although the exact relationship is uncertain; some Greek and Latin manuscripts of the [[Septuagint]] state that Jochebed was Amram's father's cousin, and others state that Amram was Jochebed's cousin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecmarsh.com/lxx-kjv/Exodus/exo_006.htm Exodus 6:16–20, LXX -]&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Masoretic text]] states that he was [[incest|Jochebed's nephew]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[New American Bible]]'', footnote to Exodus 6:20&lt;/ref&gt;

Textual scholars attribute the biblical genealogy to the [[Book of Generations]], a document originating from a similar [[wiktionary:religiopolitical|religiopolitical]] group and date to the [[priestly source]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who Wrote The Bible?''&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Biblical criticism|biblical scholars]], the Torah's genealogy for Levi's descendants, is actually an [[aetiology|aetiological]] [[myth]] reflecting the fact that there were four different groups among the levites – the [[Gershonite]]s, [[Kohathite]]s, [[Merarite]]s, and Aaronids;&lt;ref name = &quot;wnsmyy&quot;&gt;''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron – the eponymous ancestor of the Aaronids – couldn't be portrayed as a brother to Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, as the narrative about the birth of Moses (brother of Aaron), which textual scholars attribute to the earlier [[Elohist]] source, mentions only that ''both'' his parents were Levites (without identifying their names).&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Exodus|2:1–2|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical scholars suspect that the Elohist account offers both [[matrilinear descent|matrilinial]] and [[patrilinear descent|patrilinial]] descent from Levites in order to magnify the religious credentials of Moses.&lt;ref name = &quot;wnsmyy&quot;/&gt;

==In the Qur'an==
'''Amran''' is arabicized to '''Imran'''. Muslims believe that, in the [[Qur'an]], the name Imran is used for two different people. The first one is Amram the father of Moses and the second one is [[Joachim]] the father of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Amram, the father of [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]], is a revered [[patriarch]] of [[Islam]]. The [[Qur'an]] says:

{{Quote|God did choose Adam and Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of Amram above all people,-|Qur'an, sura 3 (''The House of [[Imran]]''), ayah 33&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|33|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although [[Muslim]] scholars have often debated over who this verse refers to, most [[Islamic Golden Age|classical]] [[Tafsir|commentators]] and modern translators have taken the opinion that this refers to Amram, the father of [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]]. Through him would come many other [[priests]] and [[prophet]]s, including [[Saint Anne|Anne]], [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]], [[Islamic views of Mary|Mary]], [[John the Baptist]] and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]].

==Family tree==
According to the [[Septuagint]], Amram's family tree would be as follows:
{{familytree/start}}
{{familytree | }}
{{familytree | | | | | | | | | LEV |~|y|~| WIF | | | BRV | LEV=[[Levi]]|WIF=(Unnamed)|BRV=(unnamed)}}

{{familytree | | | MIR | | AAR | | MOS | | | MIR=[[Miriam]]|AAR=[[Aaron]]|MOS=[[Moses]]}}

while according to the [[Masoretic]] text, Amram's family tree would be as follows:

{{familytree | }}
{{familytree | | | | | | | | | LEV |~|y|~| WIF | | LEV=[[Levi]]|WIF=(unnamed)}}

==In rabbinical literature and apocryphal literature==

In the [[Apocrypha]]l ''[[Testament of Levi]]'', it is stated that Amram was born, as a grandson of [[Levi]], when Levi was 64 years old.&lt;ref&gt;''Testament of the Patriarchs'', Levi:12&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Exodus Rabbah]] argues that when the Pharaoh instructed midwives to throw male children into the Nile, Amram divorced Jochebed, who was three months pregnant with Moses at the time, arguing that there was no justification for the Israelite men to father children if they were just to be killed;&lt;ref name = &quot;ssdjlv&quot;&gt;Exodus Rabbah 1:17&lt;/ref&gt; however, the text goes on to state that Miriam, his daughter, chided him for his lack of care for his wife's feelings, persuading him to recant and marry Jochebed again.&lt;ref name = &quot;ssdjlv&quot;/&gt; According to the [[Talmud]], Amram promulgated the laws of marriage and divorce amongst the Jews in Egypt{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}; the Talmud also argues that Amram had extreme longevity, which he used to ensure that doctrines were preserved through several generations.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the legend of his divorce and remarriage, Amram was also held to have been entirely sinless throughout his life, and was rewarded for this by his corpse remaining without any signs of decay.&lt;ref&gt;[[Baba Batra]] 17a&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his death, according to the [[Book of Jubilees]], Amram was among those who went to Egypt and recovered the bones of the sons of his grandfather and great uncles (excluding those of [[Joseph (dreamer)|Joseph]] which had already been brought to Canaan), so that they could be reburied in the [[cave of Machpelah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jubilees 46:11&quot;&gt;Jubilees 46:11&lt;/ref&gt; The text states that this recovery was opportunistically performed when a war broke out between Egypt and Canaan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jubilees 46:11&quot;/&gt;

One of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] (4Q535, Manuscript B) is written from Amram's point of view, and hence has been dubbed the ''Testament of Amram''. The document is dated to the 2nd century BC and, in the form of a vision, briefly discusses dualism and the [[Grigori|Watchers]]:
{{quote|I saw Watchers in my vision, the dream-vision. Two men were fighting over me...holding a great contest over me. I asked them, 'Who are you, that you are thus empowered over me?' They answered, 'We have been empowered and rule over all mankind.' They said to me, 'Which of us do you choose to rule you?' I raised my eyes and looked. One of them was terrifying in his appearance, like a serpent, his cloak, many-colored yet very dark....And I looked again, and in his appearance, his visage like a [[Viperidae|viper]]....I replied to him, 'This Watcher, who is he?' He answered, 'This Watcher...his three names are [[Belial]] and Prince of Darkness and King of [[Evil]].' I said (to the other Watcher), 'My lord, what dominion (have you?)' He answered, 'You saw (the viper), and he is empowered over all Darkness, while I (am empowered over all Light.)...My three names are [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], [[Prince of Light (Bible)|Prince of Light]] and [[King of Righteousness]].&lt;ref&gt;translation by Prof. Robert Eisenman&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Amyntas I''' was a king of [[Macedon]].
== Name ==
Amyntas's name in [[Greek language|Greek]] is written ''Ἀμύντας Aʹ''.
== Biography ==
Amyntas was born c. 540 BC, and he died in 498 BC. He was a son of [[Alcetas I of Macedon]] and his queen. He married a woman called [[Eurydice]] and had a son [[Alexander I of Macedon|Alexander]]. 

Amyntas was a [[Tributary state|tributary]] [[vassal]] of [[Darius Hystaspes]] of [[Iran|Persia]]. With him the history of Macedon may be said to begin. He was the first of its rulers to have relations with other countries; he entered into an alliance with [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]] of [[Athens]], and when Hippias was driven out of Athens he offered him the territory of [[Anthemus]] on the [[Thermaic Gulf]]. Hippias refused it and [[Iolcos]] as well, the Thessalian offer, as Amyntas probably did not possess Anthemous at that time, but was merely suggesting a plan of joint occupation to Hippias.&lt;ref&gt;Miltiades V.

'''Amyntas III''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ''Ἀμύντας Γ΄'', - 370 BC) son of Arrhidaeus and father of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], was king of [[Macedon]] in 393 BC, and again from 392 to 370 BC. He was also a paternal grandfather of [[Alexander the Great]].

He came to the throne after the ten years of confusion which followed the death of [[Archelaus I of Macedon|Archelaus I]], the patron of art and literature. But he had many enemies at home; in 393 he was driven out by the [[Illyria]]ns, but in the following year, with the aid of the [[Thessalia]]ns, he recovered his kingdom.  Medius, head of the house of the Aleuadae of Larissa, is believed to have provided aid to Amyntas in recovering his throne.  The mutual relations between the Argeadae and the Aleuadae dates to the time of Archelaus I.

To shore up his country against the threat of the Illyrians, Amyntas established an alliance with the [[Chalkidian League]] led by Olynthus.  In exchange for this support, Amyntas granted them rights to Macedonian timber, which was sent back to Athens to help fortify their fleet.  With money flowing into the Olynthus from these exports, their power grew.  In response, Amyntas sought additional allies. He established connections with [[Kotys]], chief of the Odrysians.  Kotys had already married his daughter to the Athenian general [[Iphicrates]].  Prevented from marrying into Kotys' family, Amyntas soon adopted Iphicrates as his son.

After the King's Peace 387 BC, [[History of Sparta|Sparta]] was anxious to re-establish its presence in the north of Greece.  In 385 BC, Bardylis and his [[Illyrians]] attacked [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] instigated and aided by Dionysius of Syracuse,&lt;ref&gt;A History of Greece to 322 B.C.by N. G. L. Hammond. ISBN 0198730950, 1986, page 479, &quot;Molossi, Alcetas, who was a refugee at his court, Dionysius sent a supply of arms and 2,000 troops to the Illyrians, who burst into Epirus and slaughtered 15,000 Molossians. Sparta intervened as soon as they had learned of the events and expelled the Illyrians, but Alcetas had regained his...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to restore the [[Molossian]] king [[Alcetas I of Epirus]] to the throne.  When Amyntas sought Spartan aid against the growing threat of Olynthus, the Spartans eagerly responded.  That Olynthus was backed by Athens and Thebes, rivals to Sparta for the control of Greece, provided them additional incentive to break up this growing power in the north.  Amyntas thus concluded a treaty with the Spartans, who assisted him to reduce [[Olynthus]] (379).  He also entered into a league with [[Jason of Pherae]], and assiduously cultivated the friendship of [[Athens]]. In 371 BC at a Panhellenic congress of the [[Lacedaemonian]] allies, he voted in support of the [[Athenians]]' claim and joined other Greeks in voting to help Athens to recover possession of [[Amphipolis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschines]] - On the Embassy [http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/aeschines-embassy.html 2.32]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History of Greece [http://books.google.com/books?id=5hcPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA336&amp;dq=371+BC+Amyntas+Amphipolis#PPA339,M1] by George Grote&lt;/ref&gt;

With Olynthus defeated, Amyntas was now able to conclude a treaty with Athens and keep the timber revenues for himself.  Amyntas shipped the timber to the house of the Athenian [[Timotheus]], in the [[Piraeus]].

By his wife, [[Eurydice I of Macedon|Eurydice]], he had three sons, [[Alexander II of Macedon|Alexander II]], [[Perdiccas III of Macedon|Perdiccas III]] and the youngest of whom was the famous [[Philip II of Macedon]]. Amyntas died at an advanced age, leaving his throne to his eldest son, Alexander.

'''Anacharsis''' ({{lang-el|Ἀνάχαρσις}}) was a [[Scythian]] philosopher who travelled from his homeland on the northern shores of the [[Black Sea]] to Athens in the early 6th century BCE and made a great impression as a forthright, outspoken &quot;[[barbarian]]&quot;, apparently a forerunner of the [[Cynics]], though none of his works have survived.

==Life==
Anacharsis the son of Gnurus,&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, iv. 76; Diogenes Laertius, i. 101; although [[Lucian]], (''Scytha'') calls him the son of Daucetas.&lt;/ref&gt; a Scythian chief, was half Greek and from a mixed Hellenistic culture, apparently in the region of the [[Cimmerian Bosporus]]. He left his native country to travel in pursuit of knowledge, and came to [[Athens]] about 589 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Sosicrates, ap Diogenes Laertius, i. 101&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when [[Solon]] was occupied with his legislative measures.

According to the story recounted by [[Hermippus of Smyrna|Hermippus]],&lt;ref&gt;Hermippus, ap Diogenes Laertius, i. 101-2&lt;/ref&gt; he arrived at the house of Solon and said, &quot;I have traveled here from afar to make you my friend.&quot; Solon replied, &quot;It's better to make friends at home.&quot; Thereupon the Scythian replied, &quot;Then it is necessary for you, being at home, to make friends with me.&quot;  Solon laughed and accepted him as his friend.

He cultivated the outsider's knack of seeing the illogic in familiar things. His conversation was droll and frank, and Solon and the Athenians took to him as a sage and philosopher. His rough and free discourse became proverbial among Athenians as 'Scythian discourse'.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, i. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Anacharsis was the first foreigner ([[metic]]) who received the privileges of Athenian citizenship. He was reckoned by some ancient authors as one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]],&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, i. 41-2&lt;/ref&gt; and it is said that he was initiated into the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] of the Great Goddess, a privilege denied to those who did not speak fluent Greek.

According to [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, iv, 76; comp. Diogenes Laertius, i. 102&lt;/ref&gt; when Anacharsis returned to the Scythians he was killed by his own brother for his Greek ways and especially for the impious attempt to sacrifice to the Mother Goddess [[Cybele]], whose cult was unwelcome among the Scythians.

==Ideas==
[[Image:Nuremberg chronicles f 60r 1.png|right|thumb|Anacharsis, depicted as a medieval scholar in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]
None of the works ascribed to him in [[Ancient history|ancient times]], if indeed they were written by him, have survived. He was said to have written a book comparing the laws of the Scythians with the laws of the Greeks, as well as work on the art of war. All that remains of his thought is what later tradition ascribes to him. He became famous for the simplicity of his way of living and his acute observations on the institutions and customs of the Greeks. He exhorted moderation in everything, saying that the vine bears three clusters of grapes: the first wine, pleasure; the second, drunkenness; the third, disgust.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, i. 103&lt;/ref&gt; So he became a kind of [[emblem]] to the Athenians, who inscribed on his statues: 'Restrain your tongues, your appetites, your passions.' 

There are ten extant letters ascribed to him, one of which is also quoted by [[Cicero]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Greetings from Anacharsis to Hanno: My clothing is a Scythian cloak, my shoes are the hard soles of my feet, my bed is the earth, my food is only seasoned by hunger - and I eat nothing but milk and cheese and meat. Come and visit me, and you will find me at peace. You want to give me something. But give it to your fellow-citizens instead, or let the immortal gods have it.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Anacharsis, ''Epistle'' 5, quoted in Cicero, ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', v. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
All of the letters are spurious.&lt;ref name=&quot;malherbe&quot;&gt;Abraham J. Malherbe, (1977), ''The Cynic Epistles: A Study Edition'', pages 6-7. SBL&lt;/ref&gt; The first nine probably date from the 3rd century BCE, they are usually included among the ''[[Cynic epistles]]'', and reflect how the Cynic philosophers viewed him as prefiguring many of their ideas;&lt;ref name=&quot;malherbe&quot;/&gt; the tenth letter is quoted by [[Diogenes Laertius]], it is addressed to [[Croesus]], the proverbially rich king of [[Lydia]], it too is fictitious: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Anacharsis to Croesus: O king of the Lydians, I am come to the country of the Greeks, in order to become acquainted with their customs and institutions; but I have no need of gold, and shall be quite contented if I return to Scythia a better man than I left it. However I will come to Sardis, as I think it very desirable to become a friend of yours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diogenes Laertius, i. 105&quot;&gt;Diogenes Laertius, i. 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Strabo]] makes him the (probably legendary) inventor of the [[anchor]] with two flukes, and others made him the inventor of the [[potter's wheel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Diogenes Laertius, i. 105&quot; /&gt;

Having been informed that [[Solon]] was employed to draw up a code of laws for the [[Athenians]], Anacharsis described his occupation, saying:
:''&quot;Laws are spider-webs, which catch the little flies, but cannot hold the big ones.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;'Beeton's Book of Jokes and Jests, or Good Things Said and Sung' - Second Edition, Printed by Frederick Warne &amp; Co., London, 1866&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival in the 18th century==
In 1788 [[Jean Jacques Barthelemy]] (1716&amp;ndash;95), a highly esteemed classical scholar and Jesuit, published ''The Travels of Anacharsis the Younger in Greece,'' about a young [[Scythia]]n descended from Anacharsis. The 4-volume work was an imaginary [[travel journal]], one of the first [[historical novel]]s, which Klemperer called &quot;the encyclopedia of the new cult of the antique&quot; in the late 18th century&lt;ref&gt;[http://whoosh.org/issue56/rich1.html XENA AS HEIRESS OF ANACHARSIS: HER ROUTE TO IMMORTALITY], Edward P. Rich&lt;/ref&gt;. It had an impact on the growth of [[philhellenism]] in France at the time. The book went through many editions, was reprinted in the United States and translated into German and other languages. It later inspired European sympathy for the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek struggle for independence]] and spawned sequels and imitations through the 19th century.

==Quote==
:''&quot;He marvelled that among the Greeks, those who were skillful in a thing vie in competition; those who have ''no'' skill, judge&quot;'' &amp;mdash;[[Diogenes Laertius]], of Anacharsis.

:''This article is about the Iraqi town of Anah. For the district, see [[Anah (district)]], and for the character in the Book of [[Book of Genesis]], see [[List of minor Biblical figures#Anah|List of minor Biblical figures: Anah]].''

'''Anah''', or '''`Ana''', is an [[Iraq]]i town on the [[Euphrates]] river, approximately mid-way between the [[Gulf of Alexandretta]] and the [[Persian Gulf]].

==Etymology==
It is called '''Hanat''' in a [[Babylonia]]n letter (about 2200 BC), '''a-na-at''' by the scribes of Tukulti-Ninurta (885 BC), and '''An-at''' by the scribe of Assur-nasir-pal (879 B.C.), Anatho (Isidore Charax), Anatha (Ammianus Marcellinus) by Greek and Latin writers in the early Christian centuries, `Ana (sometimes, as if plural, `Anat) by Arabic writers. The name has been connected with that of the deity Anat.

==Background==
Whilst `Ana has thus retained its name for forty-one centuries the site is variously described. Most early writers concur in placing it on an island; so [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]], [[Ashur-nasir-pal II|Assur-nasir-pal]], [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]], [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], [[Ibn Serapion]], [[al-Istakri]], [[Abulfeda]] and [[al-Karamani]]. Ammianus&lt;ref&gt;lib. 24, c. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; calls it a ''munimentum'', [[Theophylactus Simocatta]]&lt;ref&gt;iv. 10, v. 1, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; ''to 'Anathon frourion'', [[Zosimus]]&lt;ref&gt;iii. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; a ''frourion'', opp. Fathusai, which may be the Beth(th) ina of Ptolemy (v. 19).&lt;ref&gt;Steph. Byz. (sub Turos) says that [[Arrian]] calls Anatha Turos.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonhart Rauwolff]], in AD 1574, found it &quot;divided ... into two towns,&quot; the one &quot;Turkish,&quot; &quot;so surrounded by the river, that you cannot go into it but by boats,&quot; the other, much larger, on the Arabian side of the river.&lt;ref&gt;Texeira (1610) says that &quot;Anna&quot; lay on both banks of the river, and so Della Valle (i. 671).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This southernmost town of [[Mesopotamia]] proper (''[[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]]'') must have shared the chequered history of that land. Of `Ana's fortunes under the early Babylonian
empire the records have not yet been unearthed; but in a letter dating from the third millennium BC, six men of Hanat (Ha-na-atK1) are mentioned in a statement as to certain disturbances which had occurred in the sphere of the Babylonian
Resident of Suhi, which would include the district of `Ana.

How `Ana fared at the hands of the Mitanni and others is unknown. The suggestion that [[Amenhotep I|Amenophis (Amenhotep) I]]. ([[16th century BC]]) refers to it is improbable; but we seem to be justified in holding `Ana to be the town &quot;in the middle of the Euphrates&quot; opposite (ina put) to which
Assur-nasir-pal halted in his campaign of 879 BC. The supposed reference to `Ana in the speech put into the mouth of [[Sennacherib]]'s messengers to Hezekiah (2 Kings xix. 13, Is. xxxvii. 13) is exceedingly improbable. The town may be mentioned, however, in four 7th century documents edited by [[Claude Hermann Walter Johns]].&lt;ref&gt;Ass. Deeds and Doc. nos. 23, 168, 228, 385. The characters used are DIS TU, which may mean Ana-tu.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at `Ana that the emperor Julian met the first opposition on his disastrous expedition against [[Iran|Persia]] (363), when he got possession of the place and transported the people; and there that Ziyad and Shureih with the advanced guard of `Ali's army were refused passage across the Euphrates (36/657) to join `Ali in Mesopotamia (Tabari i. 3261).

Later `Ana was the place of exile of the caliph Qaim (al-qaim bi-amr-illah) when [[Basisiri]] was in power (450/1058.) In the 14th century `Ana was the seat of a
Catholicos, primate of the Persians (Marin Sanuto). In 1610 [[Pietro Della Valle]] found a [[Scotland|Scot]], George Strachan, resident at `Ana (to study Arabic) as physician to the amir (i. 671-681). In 1835 the steamer &quot;Tigris&quot; of the English Euphrates expedition went down in a hurricane just above `Ana, near where Julian's force had suffered from a similar storm. Della Valle described `Ana as the chief Arab town on the Euphrates, an importance which it owes to its position on one of the routes from the west to [[Baghdad]]; Texeira said that the power of its amir extended to [[Palmyra]] (early 17th century); but Olivier found the ruling prince with only twenty-five men in his service, the town becoming more depopulated every day from lack of protection from the Arabs of the desert.

==Modern Anah==
[[Image:Mosque in Anah Iraq protected by USMC in August 2008.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Mosque in Anah]]
Modern `Ana lies from west to east on the right bank along a bend of the river just before it turns south towards Hit, and presents an attractive appearance. It extends, chiefly as a single street, for several miles along a narrow strip
of land between the river and a ridge of rocky hills. The houses are separated from one another by fruit gardens. `Ana marks the boundary between the olive (north) and the date (south).

Arab poets celebrated its wine,&lt;ref&gt;Yuqut, iii. 593f.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mustaufi (8/14th century) tells of the fame of its palm-groves. In the river, facing the town, is a succession of equally productive islands. The most easterly contains the ruins of the old castle, whilst the remains of the ancient Anatho extend from this island for about 2 miles down the left bank. Coarse cloth is almost the only manufacture.

One of 'Ana's prized possessions was an ancient minaret. Dr. Alastair Northedge, a British archaeologist who wrote a book about findings in 'Ana, wrote that the minaret is 'commonly attributed to the Uqaylid (dynasty) and the 5th/11th century (AH/AD), though ... more probably of the 6th/12th century [AH/AD]. It was situated on the island at 'Ana and belonged to ... the congregational mosque.

When the valley was flooded by the [[Haditha Dam]] at Haditha in 1984-85, the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities cut it into sections, and removed it to the new 'Ana where it was re-erected at the end of the 1980s.' Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq Dr. Muayad Said described the structure before the filling of the reservoir: 'It has an octagonal body enhanced by alcoves, some of which are blind. ... Conservation work on the building was undertaken in 1935 and again in 1963 and 1964, and today it stands 28 metres high and fully restored.'

'''Ānanda''' was one of many principal disciples and a devout attendant of the [[Gotama Buddha|Buddha]]. Amongst the Buddha's many disciples, Ānanda had the most retentive memory and most of the [[Sūtra|suttas]] in the [[Sutta Pitaka]] are attributed to his recollection of the Buddha's teachings during the [[First Buddhist Council]]. For that, he was known as the ''Guardian of the Dharma''.  

According to the Buddha every Buddha in the past and to come will have two chief disciples and one attendant during his ministry.  In the case of [[Gautama Buddha]] the pair of disciples were [[Sariputta]] and [[Mahamoggallana]] and the attendant Ānanda.

The word 'Ānanda' means [[wikt:bliss|'bliss']] in [[Pali]], [[Sanskrit]] as well as other Indian languages. It is a popular [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] name.  

In the Kannakatthala Sutta ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN 90]]), Ananda is identified with the meaning of his name:

:Then King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One, &quot;Lord, what is the name of this monk?&quot;

:&quot;His name is Ananda, great king.&quot;

:&quot;What a joy he is! What a true joy!...&quot;

Ānanda was the first [[cousin]] of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] by their fathers, and was devoted to him.  In the twentieth year of the Buddha's ministry, he became the Buddha's personal attendant, accompanying him on most of his wanderings and taking the part of [[interlocutor]] in many of the recorded [[dialogues]].  He is the subject of a special [[panegyric]] delivered by the Buddha just before the Buddha's [[Parinibbana]] (the [[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]] ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 16)); it is a panegyric for a man who is kindly, unselfish, popular, and thoughtful toward others.

In the long list of the disciples given in the [[Anguttara Nikaya]] (i. xiv.) where each of them is declared to be the chief in some quality, Ānanda is mentioned five times (more often than any other). He was named chief in [[conduct]], in service to others, and in power of [[memory]]. The Buddha sometimes asked him to substitute for him as teacher and then later stated that he himself would not have presented the teachings in any other way.

==The First Council==
 
Because he attended the Buddha personally and often traveled with him, Ānanda overheard and memorized many of the discourses the Buddha delivered to various audiences.  Therefore, he is often called the disciple of the Buddha who &quot;heard much&quot;. At the [[Buddhist councils|First Buddhist Council]], convened shortly after the Buddha died, Ananda was called upon to recite many of the discourses that later became the [[Sutta Pitaka]] of the [[Pāli Canon]].

Despite his long association with and close proximity to the Buddha, Ananda was only a [[Sotapanna|stream-winner]] prior to the Buddha’s death. However, Buddha said that the purity of his heart was so great that, &quot;Should Ananda die without being fully liberated; he would be king of the gods seven times because of the purity of his heart, or be king of the Indian subcontinent seven times. But ... Ananda will experience final liberation in this very life.&quot; ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 3.80)

Prior to the First Buddhist Council, it was proposed that Ananda not be permitted to attend on the grounds that he was not yet an [[arahant]].  According to legend, this prompted Ananda to focus his efforts on the attainment of [[nibbana]] and he was able to reach the specified level of attainment before the calling of the conclave.

In contrast to most of the figures depicted in the [[Pāli Canon]], Ananda is presented as an imperfect, if sympathetic, figure. He mourns the deaths of both [[Sariputta]], with whom he enjoyed a close friendship, and the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]].  A verse of the [[Theragatha]] [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/theragatha/thag-17-03-ao0.html] reveals his loneliness and isolation following the [[parinirvana]] of the Buddha.

In the [[Zen]] tradition, Ananda is considered to be the second Indian patriarch.  He is often depicted with the Buddha alongside [[Mahakashyapa]], the first Indian patriarch.

'''Anaxagoras''' ({{lang-el|Ἀναξαγόρας, ''Anaxagoras''}}, &quot;lord of the assembly&quot;; c. 500 BC &amp;ndash; 428 BC) was a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]]. Born in [[Clazomenae]] in [[Asia Minor]], Anaxagoras was the first philosopher to bring philosophy from [[Ionia]] to [[Athens]]. He attempted to give a scientific account of [[eclipse]]s, [[meteor]]s, [[rainbow]]s, and the [[sun]], which he described as a fiery mass larger than the [[Peloponnese]]. According to [[Diogenes Laertius]] and [[Plutarch]] he fled to [[Lampsacus]] due to a backlash against his pupil [[Pericles]].

Anaxagoras is famous for introducing the [[cosmological]] concept of [[Nous]] (mind), as an ordering force. He regarded material substance as an infinite multitude of imperishable primary [[Classical element|elements]], referring all generation and disappearance to mixture and separation respectively.

==Biography==
Anaxagoras appears to have had some amount of property and prospects of political influence in his native town of [[Clazomenae]] in [[Asia Minor]]. However, he supposedly surrendered both of these out of a fear that they would hinder his search for knowledge. [[Valerius Maximus]] preserves a different tradition: Anaxagoras, coming home from a long voyage, found his property in ruin, and said: &quot;If this had not perished, I would have.&quot; &quot;This is a sentence - says the Roman - denoting the most perfect wisdom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Val. Max., VIII, 7, ext., 5: Qui, cum e diutina peregrinatione patriam repetisset possessionesque desertas vidisset, &quot;non essem - inquit &quot;ego salvus, nisi istae perissent.&quot; Vocem petitae sapientiae compotem!&lt;/ref&gt; Although a Greek, he may have been a soldier of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] army when Clazomenae was suppressed during the [[Ionian Revolt]].

In early manhood (c. 464&amp;ndash;461 BC) he went to [[Athens]], which was rapidly becoming the centre of Greek culture. There he is said to have remained for thirty years. [[Pericles]] learned to love and admire him, and the poet [[Euripides]] derived from him an enthusiasm for science and humanity.

Anaxagoras brought philosophy and the spirit of scientific inquiry from [[Ionia]] to Athens.  His observations of the celestial bodies and the fall of [[meteorites]] led him to form new theories of the universal order. He attempted to give a scientific account of [[eclipse]]s, [[meteor]]s, [[rainbow]]s, and the [[sun]], which he described as a mass of blazing metal, larger than the [[Peloponnese]]. He was the first to explain that the moon shines due to reflected light from the sun. He also said that the moon had mountains and he believed that it was inhabited. The heavenly bodies, he asserted, were masses of stone torn from the earth and ignited by rapid rotation. He explained that though both sun and the stars were fiery stones, we do not feel the heat of the stars because of their enormous distance from earth. He thought that the earth is flat and floats supported by 'strong' air under it and disturbances in this air sometimes causes earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;Burnet J. (1892) ''Early Greek Philosophy'' A. &amp; C. Black, London, [http://worldcat.org/oclc/4365382 OCLC 4365382], and subsequent editions, 2003 edition published by Kessinger, Whitefish, Montana, ISBN 0-7661-2826-1&lt;/ref&gt; These speculations made him vulnerable in Athens to a charge of impiety. [[Diogenes Laertius]] reports the story that he was prosecuted by Cleon for impiety, but Plutarch says that Pericles sent Anaxagoras to Lampsacus for his own safety after the Athenians began to blame him for the Peloponnesian war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/pericles.1b.txt Plutarch, ''Pericles'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

At about 450 BC,&lt;ref&gt;A.E. Taylor, &quot;On the date of the trial of Anaxagoras&quot; ''Classical Quarterly'' '''11''' (1917), pp 81&amp;ndash;87.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Laertius Pericles spoke in his defense at his trial. Even so Anaxagoras was forced to retire from Athens to [[Lampsacus]] in [[Troad]] (c. 434&amp;ndash;433 BC). He died there in around the year 428 BC. Citizens of Lampsacus erected an altar to Mind and Truth in his memory, and observed the anniversary of his death for many years.

Anaxagoras wrote a book of philosophy, but only fragments of the first part of this have survived, through preservation in work of [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] in the sixth century AD.

==Cosmological theory==
[[Image:Anaxagoras Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|right|thumb|Anaxagoras, depicted as a medieval scholar in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]
All things have existed from the beginning.  But originally they existed in infinitesimally small fragments of themselves, endless in number and inextricably combined.  All things existed in this mass, but in a confused and indistinguishable form.  There were the seeds (''spermata'') or miniatures of wheat and flesh and gold in the primitive mixture; but these parts, of like nature with their wholes (the ''homoiomereiai'' of [[Aristotle]]), had to be eliminated from the complex mass before they could receive a definite name and character.
Mind arranged the segregation of like from unlike; ''panta chremata en omou eita nous elthon auta diekosmese''.  This peculiar thing, called Mind (''[[Nous]]''), was no less illimitable than the chaotic mass, but, unlike the ''[[logos]]'' of [[Heraclitus]], it stood pure and independent (''mounos ef eoutou''), a thing of finer texture, alike in all its manifestations and everywhere the same.  This subtle agent, possessed of all knowledge and power, is especially seen ruling in all the forms of life.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Mind causes motion.  It rotated the primitive mixture, starting in one corner or point, and gradually extended until it gave distinctness and reality to the aggregates of like parts, working something like a centrifuge, and eventually creating the known cosmos.  But even after it had done its best, the original intermixture of things was not wholly overcome.  No one thing in the world is ever abruptly separated, as by the blow of an axe, from the rest of things.

It is noteworthy that [[Aristotle]] accuses Anaxagoras of failing to differentiate between ''nous'' and ''psyche'', while Socrates ([[Plato]], ''Phaedo'', 98 B) objects that his ''nous'' is merely a ''[[deus ex machina]]'' to which he refuses to attribute design and knowledge.

Anaxagoras proceeded to give some account of the stages in the process from original chaos to present arrangements.  The division into cold mist and warm ether first broke the spell of confusion.  With increasing cold, the former gave rise to water, earth and stones.  The seeds of life which continued floating in the air were carried down with the rains and produced vegetation.  Animals, including man, sprang from the warm and moist clay.  If these things be so, then the evidence of the senses must be held in slight esteem.  We seem to see things coming into being and passing from it; but reflection tells us that decease and growth only mean a new aggregation (''synkrisis'') and disruption (''diakrisis'').  Thus Anaxagoras distrusted the senses, and gave the preference to the conclusions of reflection.  Thus he maintained that there must be blackness as well as whiteness in snow; how otherwise could it be turned into dark water?

Anaxagoras marked a turning-point in the history of philosophy.
With him speculation passes from the colonies of Greece to settle at Athens.  By the theory of minute constituents of things, and his emphasis on mechanical processes in the formation of order, he paved the way for the [[atomic theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anaxarchus''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|æ|n|ə|ɡ|ˈ|z|ɑr|k|ə|s}}; {{lang-el|Ἀνάξαρχος}}; c. 380 - c. 320 BC) was a [[philosopher]] of the school of [[Democritus]]. Together with [[Pyrrho]], he accompanied [[Alexander the Great]] into Asia. The reports of his philosophical views suggest that he was a forerunner of the [[Pyrrhonism|Greek skeptics]].

==Life==
Anaxarchus was born at [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] in [[Thrace]]. He was the companion and friend of [[Alexander the Great]] in his Asiatic campaigns. According to [[Diogenes Laertius]], in response to Alexander's claim to have been the son of Zeus-Ammon, Anaxarchus pointed to his bleeding wound and remarked, &quot;See the blood of a mortal, not [[ichor]], such as flows from the veins of the immortal gods.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;laertius60&quot;&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives'', ix. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Diogenes Laertius also says that [[Nicocreon]], the tyrant of [[Cyprus]], commanded him to be pounded to death in a mortar, and that he endured this torture with fortitude and [[Cicero]] relates the same story.&lt;ref name=&quot;laertius58&quot;&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives'', ix. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]] tells a story that at [[Bactra]], in 327 BC in a debate with [[Callisthenes]], he advised all to worship Alexander as a god even during his lifetime, is with greater probability attributed to the Sicilian [[Cleon]].

When Alexander was trying to show that he is divine so that the Greeks and Macedonians would perform proskynesis to him, Anaxarchus said that Alexander could &quot;more justly be considered a god than Dionysus or Heracles&quot; (Arrian, 104)

==Philosophy==
Very little is known about his philosophical views. It is thought that he represents a link between the [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]], and the [[Pyrrhonism|skepticism]] of [[Pyrrho]].

Anaxarchus is said to have studied under [[Diogenes of Smyrna]], who in turn studied under [[Metrodorus of Chios]], who used to declare that he knew nothing, not even the fact that he knew nothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;laertius58&quot;/&gt; According to [[Sextus Empiricus]], Anaxarchus &quot;compared existing things to a scene-painting and supposed them to resemble the impressions experienced in sleep or madness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Logicians'', 7.88.&lt;/ref&gt; It was under the influence of Anaxarchus that Pyrrho is said to have adopted &quot;a most noble philosophy,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. taking the form of agnosticism and suspension of judgement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives'', ix. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Anaxarchus is said to have praised Pyrrho's &quot;indifference and sang-froid.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives'', ix. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Anaxarchus is said to have possessed &quot;fortitude and contentment in life,&quot; which earned him the epithet ''eudaimonikos'' (&quot;fortunate&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;laertius60&quot;/&gt; which may imply that he held the end of life to be ''[[eudaimonia]].''

Members of the southeast Asian [[planthopper]] genus '''''Ancyra''''' are well-known for having a pair of prolonged filaments at the tips of the forewings that arise near a pair of small glossy spots; this creates the impression of a pair of antennae, with corresponding &quot;eyes&quot; (a remarkable case of [[automimicry]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wickler, W. 1968. Mimicry in plants and animals. McGraw-Hill, New York&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;false head&quot; effect is further reinforced by the bugs' habit of walking backwards when it detects movement nearby, so as to misdirect predators to strike at its rear, rather than at its actual head.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anaximenes''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀναξιμένης}}) of [[Lampsacus]] (c. 380 – 320 BC) was a [[Classical Greece|Greek]] [[rhetoric]]ian and historian.

==Rhetorical works==
Anaximenes was a pupil of [[Zoilus]]&lt;ref name=OCD&gt;D.A. Russell, &quot;Anaximenes (2),&quot; ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', 3rd ed., rev., 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and, like his teacher, wrote a work on [[Homer]]. As a rhetorician, he was a determined opponent of [[Isocrates]] and his school. He is generally regarded as the author of the ''[[Rhetoric to Alexander]]'', an ''Art of Rhetoric'' included in the traditional [[Corpus Aristotelicum|corpus]] of [[Aristotle]]'s works.  [[Quintilian]] seems to refer to this work under Anaximenes' name in ''Institutio Oratoria'' [http://honeyl.public.iastate.edu/quintilian/3/chapter4.html#9 3.4.9], as the Italian Renaissance philologist [[Piero Vettori]] first recognized.  This attribution has, however, been disputed by some scholars.

The [http://books.google.com/books?id=UdyFQ4a9HOMC&amp;pg=PR58#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false hypothesis] to Isocrates' ''Helen'' mentions that Anaximenes, too, had written a ''Helen'', &quot;though it is more a defense speech (''apologia'') than an [[encomium]],&quot; and concludes that he was &quot;the man who has written about Helen&quot; to whom Isocrates refers (Isoc. ''Helen'' 14).  [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb|Jebb]] entertained the possibility that this work survives in the form of the ''[[Encomium of Helen]]'' ascribed to [[Gorgias]]: &quot;It appears not improbable that Anaximenes may have been the real author of the work ascribed to Gorgias.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Jebb, ''The Attic Orators'', London, 1893, vol. II, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] ([http://books.google.com/books?id=hsLNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA310#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 6.18.6]), Anaximenes was &quot;the first who practised the art of speaking extemporaneously.&quot;  He also worked as a [[Logographer (legal)|logographer]], having written the speech prosecuting [[Phryne]] according to Diodorus Periegetes (quoted by [[Athenaeus]] [http://www.attalus.org/old/athenaeus13c.html#591 XIII.591e]).  The &quot;ethical&quot; fragments preserved in [[Stobaeus]]' ''Florilegium'' may represent &quot;some philosophical book.&quot;&lt;ref name=Mahaffy/&gt;

==Historical works==
Anaximenes wrote a history of Greece in twelve books, stretching from the gods' origins to the death of [[Epaminondas]] at the [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)|Battle of Mantinea]] (''Hellenica'', {{lang-grc|Πρῶται ἱστορίαι}}), and a history of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]] (''Philippica'').  He was a favorite of [[Alexander the Great]], whom he accompanied in his Persian campaigns, and wrote a third historical work on Alexander.  (However, Pausanias [http://books.google.com/books?id=hsLNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA310#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 6.18.6] expresses doubt about his authorship of an [[epic poetry|epic poem]] on Alexander.)  He was one of the eight exemplary historiographers included in the [[Library of Alexandria|Alexandrian]] canon.

[[Didymus Chalcenterus|Didymus]] reports that the work transmitted as speech 11 of [[Demosthenes]] (''Against the Letter of Philip'') could be found in almost identical form in Book 7 of Anaximenes' ''Philippica'', and many scholars regard the work as a historiographic composition by Anaximenes.&lt;ref name=Sealey&gt;Raphael Sealey, ''Demosthenes in His Time'', Oxford, 1993, pp. 239f.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Letter of Philip'' (speech 12) to which speech 11 seems to respond may also be by Anaximenes, or it may be an authentic letter by Philip, perhaps written with the aid of his advisers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sealey&quot;/&gt; The more ambitious theory of Wilhelm Nitsche, which assigned to Anaximenes a larger part of the Demosthenic corpus (speeches 10-13 and 25, letters 1-4, proems), can be rejected.&lt;ref name=Jacoby&gt;Jacoby, commentary on Anaximenes in ''FGrHist''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anaximenes was hostile to [[Theopompus]], whom he sought to discredit with a libelous parody, ''Trikaranos'', published in Theopompus' style and under his name, attacking Athens, Sparta, and Thebes.&lt;ref name=Mahaffy&gt;[[John Pentland Mahaffy|J.P. Mahaffy]], ''The Prose Writers from Isocrates to Aristotle'', London, 1904, pp. [http://books.google.com/books?id=iArl6eYqCNsC&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 38]-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]] criticizes Anaximenes, together with Theopompus and [[Ephorus]], for the &quot;rhetorical effects and grand [[Periodic sentence|periods]]&quot; these historians implausibly gave to men in the midst of urgent battlefield circumstances (''Praecepta gerendae reipublicae'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Praecepta_gerendae_reipublicae*.html#T803b 803b]).

'''Anaximenes''' ({{lang-el|Άναξιμένης}}) of [[Miletus]] ([[b.]] 585 BCE, d. 528 BCE) was an [[Archaic Greece|Archaic Greek]] [[Pre-Socratic]] [[philosopher]] also known as the father of philosophy active in the latter half of the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;lindberg28&quot;&gt;Lindberg, David C. “The Greeks and the Cosmos.” &lt;u&gt;The Beginnings of Western Science&lt;/u&gt;. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007.  28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;graham&quot;&gt;Graham, Daniel W. &quot;Anaximenes&quot;. The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 29.10.2009 [http://www.iep.utm.edu/anaximen].&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the three [[Milesian School|Milesian]] philosophers, he is identified as a younger friend or student of [[Anaximander]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, G.S., J.E. Raven, and M. Schofield.  “Anaximenes of Miletus.”  &lt;u&gt;The Presocratic Philosophers&lt;/u&gt;.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984.  143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guthrie115&quot;&gt;Guthrie, W.K.C.  “The Milesians: Anaximenes.”  &lt;u&gt;A History of Greek Philosophy&lt;/u&gt;.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;  Anaximenes, like others in his school of thought, practiced [[material monism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lindberg29&quot;&gt;Lindberg, David C. “The Greeks and the Cosmos.” &lt;u&gt;The Beginnings of Western Science&lt;/u&gt;. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007.  29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guthrie115&quot;/&gt;  This tendency to identify one specific underlying reality made up of a material thing constitutes the bulk of the contributions for which Anaximenes is most famed.

==Anaximenes and the Arche==
While his predecessors [[Thales]] and Anaximander proposed that the [[Arche|''arche'']], the underlying material of the world, were water and the ambiguous substance [[Apeiron (cosmology)|''apeiron'']], respectively, Anaximenes asserted that air was this most basic stuff of which all other things are made.&lt;ref name=&quot;lindberg28&quot;/&gt;  To him air was not just one of the four basic elements but was the substance from which all things came and to which they would all eventually return.  While the choice of air may seem arbitrary, he based his conclusion on naturally observable phenomena in the process of [[rarefaction]] and [[condensation]].&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, W.K.C.  “The Milesians: Anaximenes.”  &lt;u&gt;A History of Greek Philosophy&lt;/u&gt;.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;  When air condenses it becomes visible, as mist and then rain and other forms of precipitation, and as the condensed air cools Anixemenes supposed that it went on to form earth and ultimately stones.  In contrast, water evaporates into air which ignites and produces flame when further rarefied.&lt;ref name=&quot;guthrie124&quot;&gt;Guthrie, W.K.C.  “The Milesians: Anaximenes.”  &lt;u&gt;A History of Greek Philosophy&lt;/u&gt;.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962. 124-126.&lt;/ref&gt;  While other philosophers also recognized such transitions in states of matter, Anaximenes was the first to associate the quality pairs hot/dry and cold/wet with the density of a single material and add a quantitative dimension to the Milesian monistic system.&lt;ref name=&quot;guthrie124&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, G.S., J.E. Raven, and M. Schofield.  “Anaximenes of Miletus.”  &lt;u&gt;The Presocratic Philosophers&lt;/u&gt;.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984.  146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Origin of the Cosmos==
Having concluded that everything in the world is composed of air, Anaximenes then used his theory to devise a scheme explaining the origins and nature of the earth as well as of the surrounding celestial bodies.  Air felted to create the flat disk of the earth, which he said was table-like and behaved like a leaf floating on air.  In keeping with the prevailing view of celestial bodies as balls of fire in the sky, Anaximenes proposed that the earth let out an exhalation of air that rarefied, ignited and became the stars.  While the sun is similarly described as being aflame, it is not composed of rarefied air like the stars but rather of earth like the moon; its burning comes not from its composition but rather from its rapid motion.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, G.S., J.E. Raven, and M. Schofield.  “Anaximenes of Miletus.”  &lt;u&gt;The Presocratic Philosophers&lt;/u&gt;.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984.  152-153.&lt;/ref&gt;  The moon and sun are likewise considered to be flat and floating on streams of air, and when the sun sets it does not pass under the earth but is merely obscured by higher parts of the earth as it circles around and becomes more distant; the motion of the sun and the other celestial bodies around the earth is likened by Anaximenes to the way that a cap may be turned around the head.&lt;ref name=&quot;graham&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fairbanks, Arthur.  &quot;[http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~simon/TEACH/28000/DavisUniversal.pdf Anaximenes]&quot;. &lt;u&gt;The First Philosophers of Greece&lt;/u&gt;. K. Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; co., ltd., 1898. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Phenomena==
Anaximenes used his observations and reasoning to provide causes for other natural phenomena on the earth as well. [[Earthquakes]] he asserted were the result either of lack of moisture, which causes the earth to break apart because of how parched it is, or of overabundance thereof, which also causes cracks in the earth because of the excess of water. In either case the earth becomes weakened by its cracks and hills collapse, causing earthquakes. [[Lightning]] is also caused by a violent separation, this time of clouds by winds to create a bright, fire-like flash.  [[Rainbows]] are formed when densely compressed air is touched by the rays of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbanks, Arthur.  &quot;[http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~simon/TEACH/28000/DavisUniversal.pdf Anaximenes]&quot;. &lt;u&gt;The First Philosophers of Greece&lt;/u&gt;. K. Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; co., ltd., 1898. 18;20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;  These examples further show how Anaximenes like the other Milesians looked for the broader picture in nature, seeking unifying causes for diversely occurring events rather than treating each one on a case-by-case basis or attributing them to gods or a personified nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;lindberg29&quot;/&gt;

'''Ancus Marcius''' (r. 640 BC &amp;ndash; 616 BC) was the legendary fourth of the [[Kings of Rome]].  
He was the son of Marcius (whose father, also named Marcius, had been a close friend of Numa Pompilius) and Pompilia (daughter of [[Numa Pompilius]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy1:32&quot;&gt;[[Livy]], [[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|''Ab Urbe Condita'']], 1:32&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Festus (historian)|Festus]], Marcius had the surname of ''Ancus'' from his ''crooked'' arm.

Upon the death of the previous king, [[Tullus Hostilius]], the [[Roman Senate]] appointed an [[interrex]], who in turn called a session of the [[Roman assemblies|assembly of the people]] who elected the new king.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy1:32&quot;/&gt;

According to [[Livy]], his first act as king was to order the [[pontifex maximus]] to copy the text concerning the performance of public ceremonies of religion from the commentaries of Numa Pompilius to be displayed to the public, so that the rites of religion should no longer be neglected or improperly performed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy1:32&quot;/&gt;

He waged [[Latin League#First war with Rome|war]] successfully against the [[Latin League|Latins]], and a number of them were settled on the [[Aventine Hill]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy1:33&quot;&gt;[[Livy]], [[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|''Ab Urbe Condita'']], 1:33&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Livy]] the war was commenced by the Latins who anticipated Ancus would follow the pious pursuit of peace adopted by his grandfather, [[Numa Pompilius]].  The Latins initially made an incursion on Roman lands.  When a Roman embassy sought restitution for the damage, the Latins gave a contemptuous reply. Ancus accordingly declared war on the Latins. The declaration is notable since, according to Livy, it was the first time that the Romans had declared war by means of the rites of the [[fetial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:32&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancus Marcius marched from Rome with a newly levied army and took the Latin town of [[Politorium]] (situated near the town of [[Lanuvium]]) by storm.  Its residents were removed to settle on the [[Aventine Hill]] in Rome as new citizens, following the Roman traditions from wars with the [[Sabines]] and [[Alba Longa|Albans]].  When the other Latins subsequently occupied the empty town of Politorium, Ancus took the town again and demolished it.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:33&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin villages of Tellenae and Ficana were also sacked and demolished.

The war then focused on the Latin town of [[Medullia]].  The town had a strong garrison and was well fortified.  Several engagements took place outside the town and the Romans were eventually victorious.  Ancus returned to Rome with much booty.  More Latins were brought to Rome as citizens and were settled at the foot of the Aventine near the [[Palatine Hill]], by the temple of [[Murcia (mythology)|Murcia]]

Ancus Marcius incorporated the [[Janiculum]] into the city, fortifying it with a wall and connecting it with the city by a wooden bridge across the [[Tiber]], the [[Pons Sublicius]].  On the land side of the city he constructed the [[Fossa Quiritium]], a ditch fortification.  He also built Rome's first prison, the [[Mamertine Prison|Mamertine prison]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy1:33&quot;/&gt;

He extended Roman territory to the sea, founding the port of [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]], establishing salt-works around the port, and taking the Silva Maesia, an area of coastal forest north of the [[Tiber]], from the [[Veii|Veientes]].  He expanded the temple of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Feretrius]] to reflect these territorial successes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy1:33&quot;/&gt;

According to a reconstruction of the [[Fasti Triumphales]], Ancus Marcius celebreated at least one triumph, over the [[Sabines]] and Veientes.

Ancus Marcius was succeeded by [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]] who was killed by the sons of Ancus Marcius.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], [[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|''Ab Urbe Condita'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrician Marcius Rex -family descended from this king and remained prominent during the republic and empire.

[[Image:Andaman nicobar 76.jpg|thumb|Detailed map of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]

The '''Andaman Islands''' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: আন্দামান দ্বীপপুঞ্জ, [[Hindi]]: अण्डमान द्वीप समूह, [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: அந்தமான் தீவுகள், [[Telugu language|Telugu]]: అండమాన్ దీవులు) are a group of [[Indian Ocean]] [[archipelago|archipelagic]] islands in the [[Bay of Bengal]] between [[India]] to the west and [[Burma]] (also known as Myanmar) to the north and east. Most of the islands are part of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] [[Union Territory]] of India while a small number at the north of the archipelago belong to Burma.

==History==
[[Image:Andamanese comparative distribution.png|thumb|Comparative distributions of Andamanese indigenous peoples, pre-18C vs present-day]]
The name &quot;Andaman&quot; first appears in the work of [[Arab people|Arab]] geographers of the ninth century (Soleyman in 851),{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} though it is uncertain whether ancient geographers like [[Ptolemy]] also knew of the Andamans but referred to them by a different name. They were also described as being inhabited by fierce [[cannibal]]istic tribes by the [[Persian people|Persian]] navigator Buzurg [[:fr:Ibn Shahriyar|ibn Shahriyar]] of Ramhormuz in his tenth century book ''Ajaib al-Hind'' (''[[:fr:Livre des merveilles de l'Inde|The wonders of India]]''), in which he also mentioned an island he called ''Andaman al-Kabir'' (''Great Andaman'').&lt;ref name=&quot;chakravarti1998&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title=India and South-East Asia Socio-Econo-Cultural Contacts: Socio-econo-cultural Contacts | author=Adhir Chakravarti, Narendra Nath Bhattacharyya | year=1998 | accessdate =2008-11-16 | publisher=Punthi Pustak | isbn=8186791140 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=xLtAAAAAMAAJ | quote=''...

===British Occupation and Penal Colony===
In 1789 the government of [[Bengal]] established a naval base and [[penal colony]] on Chatham Island in the southeast bay of [[South Andaman Island|Great Andaman]]. The settlement is now known as [[Port Blair]] (after the [[Bombay Marine]] lieutenant [[Archibald Blair]] who founded it).  After two years, the colony was moved to the northeast part of [[North Andaman Island|Great Andaman]] and was named Port Cornwallis after Admiral [[William Cornwallis]].  However, there was much disease and death in the penal colony and the government ceased operating it in May 1796.&lt;ref name=&quot;olivierblaise&quot; /&gt;

In 1824 Port Cornwallis was the rendezvous of the fleet carrying the army to the [[First Burmese War]]. In the 1830s and 1840s, shipwrecked crews who landed on the Andamans were often attacked and killed by the natives, alarming the British government.  In 1855, the government proposed another settlement on the islands, including a [[Cellular Jail|convict establishment]], but the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] forced a delay in its construction.  However, since the rebellion gave the British so many prisoners, it made the new Andaman settlement and prison an urgent necessity.  Construction began in November 1857 at Port Blair using inmates' labor, avoiding the vicinity of a salt swamp that seemed to have been the source of many of the earlier problems at Port Cornwallis.

In 1867, the ship Nineveh wrecked on the reef of North Sentinel Island. The 86 survivors reached the beach in the ship's boats. On the 3rd day, they were attacked with iron-tipped spears by naked islanders. One person from the ship escaped in a boat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodheart&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28578579_ITM | work=American Scholar | title=The Last Island of the Savages | date=2000-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!---since bourke is not notable, his assassin probably isn't either!---&gt;
For some time sickness and mortality were high, but [[Land reclamation|swamp reclamation]] and extensive forest clearance continued. The Andaman colony acquired notoriety following the murder of the Viceroy Richard Southwell Bourke, 6th [[Earl of Mayo]] on a visit to the settlement (8 February 1872) by a Muslim convict, a [[Pathan]] from [[Afghanistan]], Sher Ali. In the same year the two island groups, Andaman and [[Nicobar Islands|Nicobar]], were united under a chief commissioner residing at Port Blair.

{{quotation|The garrison consists of 140 British and 300 Indian troops, with a few local European volunteers. The police are organised as a military battalion 643 strong. The number of convicts has somewhat diminished of late years and in 1901 stood at 11,947. The total population of the settlement, consisting of convicts, their guards, the supervising, clerical and departmental staff, with the families of the latter, also a certain number of ex-convicts and trading settlers and their families, numbered 16,106. The labouring convicts are distributed among four jails and nineteen stations; the self-supporters in thirty-eight villages. The elementary education of the convicts' children is compulsory. There are four hospitals, each under a resident medical officer, under the general supervision of a senior officer of the Indian medical service, and medical aid is given free to the whole population. The net annual cost of the settlement to the government is about six pounds per convict. The harbour of Port Blair is well supplied with buoys and harbour lights, and is crossed by ferries at fixed intervals, while there are several launches for hauling local traffic. On Ross Island there is a lighthouse visible for {{convert|19|mi|km}}. A complete system of signaling by night and day on the Morse system is worked by the police. Local posts are frequent, but there is no telegraph and the mails are irregular.}}

The above accounts, written while Britain still controlled India, may leave the impression that these settlements were a model of progressive penal reform. Indian accounts, however, paint a different picture. From the time of its development in 1858 under the direction of James Pattison Walker, and in response to the mutiny and rebellion of the previous year, the settlement was first and foremost a repository for [[political prisoner]]s. The [[Cellular Jail]] at Port Blair when completed in 1910 included 698 cells designed for solitary confinement; each cell measured {{convert|4.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} by {{convert|2.7|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} with a single ventilation window {{convert|3|m|ft|0}} above the floor. [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar]] was one of the notable prisoners there.

There was a prison here in the 10th century. The Indians imprisoned here referred to the Island and its prison as  &quot;Kala Pani&quot; (Black water)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andamancellularjail.org/History.htm |title=History of Andaman Cellular Jail |publisher=Andamancellularjail.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also movie by the same name, which deals with some of these events ''[[Kalapani (film)|Kalapani]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0255289/ |title=Kala Pani (1996) |publisher=Imdb.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;). While the exact number of prisoners who died in this camp is not fully known, it is estimated they number in the thousands (some of the names of the political prisoners who perished can be found here &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andamancellularjail.org/ListOfRevolutionaries.htm |title=Andaman Islands Political Prisoners |publisher=Andamancellularjail.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; - this list is predominantly of those from eastern India and is incomplete). Many more died of harsh treatment, as well as through the harsh living and working conditions, in this camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/12/21/stories/2005122107881100.htm |title=Opinion / News Analysis : Hundred years of the Andamans Cellular Jail |publisher=The Hindu |date= 2005-12-21|accessdate=2010-05-14 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Viper Chain Gang Jail on Viper Island was reserved for troublemakers, and was also the site of hangings. In the 20th century it became a convenient place to house prominent members of India's independence movement.

====Japanese occupation====
The Andaman islands [[Japanese occupation of the Andaman Islands|were later occupied]] by [[Japan]] during [[World War II]]. The islands were nominally put under the authority of the [[Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind]] (Provisional Government of Free India) headed by Netaji [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. Netaji visited the islands during the war, and renamed them as [[Shaheed]] (Martyr) &amp; Swaraj (Self-rule). On December 30, 1943 during the Japanese occupation, [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], who was controversially  allied with the Japanese, first raised the flag of Indian independence.  General Loganathan, of the [[Indian National Army]], was Governor of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which had been annexed to the Provisional Government. Before leaving the islands, the Japanese rounded up and executed 750 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Gruhl, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ow5Wlmu9MPQC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Imperial Japan's World War Two, 1931–1945]'', Transaction Publishers, 2007 ISBN 978-0-7658-0352-8&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the war they briefly returned to British control, before becoming part of the newly independent state of India.

[[Image:Andaman.jpg|thumb|Andaman Islands]]

At the close of the Second World War the British government announced its intention to abolish the penal settlement. The government proposed to employ former inmates in an initiative to develop the island's fisheries, timber, and agricultural resources. In exchange inmates would be granted return passage to the Indian mainland, or the right to settle on the islands. The penal colony was eventually closed on August 15, 1947 when India gained its independence. It has since served as a museum to the independence movement.

===Recent history===
In 1974, a film crew and anthropologist Trilokinath Pandit attempted friendly contact by leaving a tethered pig, some pots and pans, some fruit and toys on the beach at North Sentinel Island. One of the islanders shot the film director in the thigh with an arrow. The following year, European visitors were repulsed with arrows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodheart&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/8170460816 Pandit]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McGirk&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/islanders-running-out-of-isolation-tim-mcgirk-in-the-andaman-islands-reports-on-the-fate-of-the-sentinelese-1477566.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Islanders running out of isolation: Tim McGirk in the Andaman Islands reports on the fate of the Sentinelese | date=1993-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 2, 1981, the ship Primrose grounded on the North Sentinel Island reef. A few days later, crewmen on the immobile vessel observed small black men were carrying spears and arrows and building boats on the beach. The captain of the Primrose radioed for an urgent airdrop of firearms so the crew could defend themselves, but did not receive them. Heavy seas kept the islanders away from the ship.

On January 4, 1991, Pandit made the first known friendly contact with the Sentinelese.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGirk&quot;/&gt;

Until 1996, the Jarawa met all visitors with flying arrows.{{Clarify||just got through saying Pandit made friendly contact|date=August 2010}} From time to time they attacked and killed poachers on the lands reserved to them by the Indian government. They also killed some workers building the ATR Andaman Trunk Road, which traverses Jarawa lands. The first peaceful contact with the Jarawa occurred in 1996. Settlers found a teenage Jarawa boy named Emmei near Kadamtala town. The boy was immobilized with a broken foot. They took Emmei to a hospital where he received good care. Over several weeks, Emmei learned a few words of Hindi before returning to his jungle home. The following year, Jarawa individuals and small groups began appearing along roadsides and occasionally venturing into settlements to steal food. The ATR may have interfered with traditional Jarawa food sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1514/15140660.htm Sekhsaria]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/appeal-under-threat-an-ancient-tribe-emerging-from-the-forests-757672.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Appeal: Under threat: an ancient tribe emerging from the forests | first=Paul | last=Vallely | date=2003-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survival-international.org/news/3950 Survival]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1998, American photographer John S Callahan organized the first surfing project in the Andamans, starting from Phuket in Thailand with the assistance of Southeast Asia Liveaboards (SEAL), a UK owned dive charter company. With a crew of international professional surfers, they crossed the Andaman Sea on the yacht ''Crescent'' and cleared formalities in Port Blair. The group proceeded to Little Andaman Island, where they spent ten days surfing several spots for the first time, including Jarawa Point near Hut Bay, and the long right reef point at the southwest tip of the island, named Kumari Point. The resulting article in SURFER Magazine, &quot;Quest for Fire&quot; by journalist Sam George, put the Andaman Islands on the surfing map for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surfermag.com/magazine/archivedissues/quest-for-fire]&lt;/ref&gt; Footage of the waves of the Andaman Islands also appeared in the film &quot;Thicker than Water&quot;, shot by cinematographer [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]], who later achieved worldwide fame as a popular musician. Callahan went on to make several more surfing projects in the Andamans, including a trip to the Nicobar Islands in 1999.

On 26 December 2004 the coast of the Andaman Islands was devastated by a {{convert|10|m|ft|0|sing=on}} high tsunami following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. On 11 August 2009 a magnitude 7 earthquake struck near the Andaman Islands, causing a tsunami warning to go into effect. On 30 March 2010 a magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck near the Andaman Islands.

==Geography==
The Andaman Archipelago is an oceanic continuation of the Burmese [[Chin Hills|Arakan Yoma range]] in the North and of the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian Archipelago]] in the South. It includes some two hundred islands in the Bay of Bengal with the [[Andaman Sea]] to the east between the islands and the coast of Burma.&lt;ref name=&quot;olivierblaise&quot; /&gt; [[North Andaman Island]] is {{convert|285|km}} south of Burma although a few smaller islands including the three [[Coco Islands]] which belong to Burma are further north, while at the southern end of the archipelago the [[Ten Degree Channel]] separates the Andamans from the [[Nicobar Islands]] to the south. The highest point in the Andamans is [[Saddle Peak]] ({{convert|720|m}}).

The  natural vegetation of the Andamans is tropical forest with [[mangrove]]s on the coast. Most of the forests are evergreen but there are areas of deciduous forest on North Andaman, [[Middle Andaman Island|Middle Andaman]], [[Baratang]] and parts of [[South Andaman Island]]. The rainforests of the islands are similar in composition to those of the west coast of Burma and are largely unspoilt despite logging and the demands of the fast-growing population driven by immigration from the Indian mainland. There are protected areas on [[Little Andaman Island|Little Andaman]], [[Narcondam Island|Narcondam]], North Andaman and South Andaman but these are mainly aimed at preserving the coast and the marine wildlife rather than the rainforests.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldwildlife.org/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial/im/im0101_full.html&lt;/ref&gt; Threats to wildlife come from introduced species including rats, dogs, cats and the elephants of [[Interview Island]] and North Andaman.

===Climate===
The climate is typical of tropical islands of similar latitude. It is always warm, but with sea-breezes. Rainfall is irregular, but usually dry during the north-east, and very wet during the south-west, monsoons.

===Fauna===
The islands are home to a number of endemic species and more that live only here and on the Nicobar Islands to the south. Mammals endemic to the Andaman Islands include three white-toothed shrews: Andaman Spiny Shrew ''[[Crocidura hispida]]'', Andaman White-toothed Shrew ''[[Crocidura andamanensis]]'', and [[Jenkins' Shrew]] ''Crocidura jenkinsi''. Also living on the islands, the [[Andaman Horseshoe Bat]] ''(rhinolophus cognatus)'', the [[Andaman Rat]] ''(rattus stoicus)'' and the [[South Andaman krait]] ''(Bungarus andamanensis)''. Endemic or near endemic birds include a serpent-eagle ''[[Spilornis elgini]]'', a crake ''[[Rallina canningi]]'', a wood-pigeon ''[[Columba palumboides]]'', a cuckoo dove ''[[Macropygia rufipennis]]'', a coucal ''[[Centropus andamanensis]]'', a Scops Owl ''[[Otus balli]]'', a hawk-owl ''[[Ninox affinis]]'', the [[Narcondam Hornbill]] ''(Aceros narcondami)'',  a woodpecker ''[[Dryocopus hodgei]]'', a drongo ''[[Dicrurus andamanensis]]'', a treepie ''[[Dendrocitta bayleyi]]'' and the [[White-headed Starling]] ''(sturnus erythropygius)''. The islands also have a number of endemic reptiles, toads and frogs. There is a sanctuary 45 miles from Havelock island for saltwater crocodiles. Over the past 25 years there have been 24 crocodile attacks with 4 fatalities, including the death of American tourist Lauren Failla. The government has been criticized for failing to inform tourists of the crocodile santuary and danger, while simultaneously promoting tourism. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Knowles Writer |url=http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/crocodile-kills-nj-woman-lauren-failla-snorkeling-in-indian-ocean/19467474?icid=main|htmlws-main-n|dl1|link6|http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aolnews.com%2Fnation%2Farticle%2Fcrocodile-kills-nj-woman-lauren-failla-snorkeling-in-indian-ocean%2F19467474 |title=Crocodile Kills NJ Woman Lauren Failla Snorkeling in Indian Ocean |publisher=AOL News |date= |accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of the Andamans was 356,000 in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;http://india.gov.in/knowindia/ut_andaman.php&lt;/ref&gt; having grown from 50,000 in 1960. Of the people that live in the Andaman Islands, a small minority of about 1,000 are indigenous [[Adivasi]]s of the Andamans. The rest are mainly divided between [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] people from the mainland.&lt;ref name=&quot;distadmin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andamandt.nic.in/profile.htm |title=Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands at a glance |publisher=Andamandt.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Andamanese''' is a collective term to describe the peoples who are the [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal inhabitants]] of the Andaman Islands and [[Nicobar Islands]], located in the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The term includes the [[Great Andamanese]], [[Jarawa (Andaman Islands)|Jarawa]], [[Onge people|Onge]], [[Shompen]], [[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]] and the extinct [[Jangil]]. [[Anthropology|Anthropologically]] they are usually classified as [[Negrito]]s, represented also by the [[Semang]] of [[Malaysia]] and the [[Aeta]] of the [[Philippines]].
[[Image:Great Andamanese couple.jpg|right|thumb|160px|[[Great Andamanese]] couple, in an 1876 photograph.]]
The Andamans are theorized to be a key stepping stone in a [[Great Coastal Migration|great coastal migration]] of humans from Africa via the Arabian peninsula, along the coastal regions of the Indian mainland and towards [[Southeast Asia]], [[Japan]] and [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wells2002&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title=The Journey of Man: A Genetic Odyssey | author=Spencer Wells | year=2002 | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn=069111532X | url=http://books.google.com/?id=WAsKm-_zu5sC | quote=''... the population of south-east Asia prior to 6000 years ago was composed largely of groups of hunter-gatherers very similar to modern Negritos ...

==Government==
[[Port Blair]] is the chief community on the islands, and the administrative centre of the Union Territory. The Andaman Islands form a single administrative district within the Union Territory, the [[Andaman district]] (the Nicobar Islands were separated and established as the new [[Nicobar district]] in 1974).

==Cultural references==
The islands are prominently featured in [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]] mystery, ''[[The Sign of the Four]],'' as well as in [[M.M. Kaye]]'s &quot;Death in the Andamans.&quot;  The magistrate in [[Lady Gregory]]'s play ''[[Spreading the News]]'' had formerly served in the islands.  A principal character in the book &quot;Six Suspects&quot; (ISBN 0-385-60815-2) by [[Vikas Swarup]] is from the Andaman Islands. ''[[Kala Pani (1996 film)|Kalapani]]'' (Malayalam) ''Kala Pani'' (Hindi) ''[[Sirai Chaalai]]'' (Tamil) a 1996 Indian film by Priyadarshan on freedom struggle and the lives of prisoners in Andaman Islands.

==Infrastructure==
===Airports===
The only airport in the islands is [[Vir Savarkar Airport]] in Port Blair, which has scheduled services to [[Kolkata]] and [[Chennai]].  The airport is under control of the [[Indian Air Force]]. Daytime flying is allowed.

Due to the length of these routes and the small number of airlines flying to the islands, fares have traditionally been relatively expensive, although cheaper for locals than visitors. Fares are high during peak seasons of spring and winter, but fares have been decreased over the time due to large expansion of  aviation industry in India.

'''Alexander Anderson''' (c. 1592, Aberdeen &amp;ndash; c. 1620, Paris) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[mathematician]].  He was the son of David Anderson of Finshaugh.  His sister was Janet Anderson, the mother of the celebrated [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]].  In his youth he went to the [[Mainland Europe|continent]] and taught mathematics in [[Paris]], where he published or edited, between the years 1612 and 1619, various [[geometric]] and [[algebra]]ic tracts.

He was selected by the executors of [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]] to revise and edit Viete's manuscript works. The works of Anderson amount to six thin quarto volumes, and as the last of them was published in 1619, it is probable that the author died soon after that year, but the precise date is unknown.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Andocides''' or '''Andokides''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{Polytonic|Ἀνδοκίδης}}, 440&amp;ndash;390 BC) was a [[logographer (legal)|logographer]] (speech writer) in Ancient Greece.  He was one of the ten [[Attic orators]] included in the &quot;Alexandrian Canon&quot; compiled by [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] in the third century BCE.

He was implicated during the [[Peloponnesian War]] in the mutilation of the [[Herms]] on the eve of the departure of the [[Sicilian expedition|Athenian expedition]] against [[Sicily]] in 415 BC. Although he saved his life by turning informer, he was condemned to partial loss of civil rights and forced to leave Athens.  He engaged in commercial pursuits, and returned to [[Classical Athens|Athens]] under the general amnesty that followed the restoration of the democracy (403 BC), and filled some important offices.  In 391 BC he was one of the ambassadors sent to [[Sparta]] to discuss peace terms, but the negotiations failed. [[Oligarch]]ical in his sympathies, he offended his own party and was distrusted by the democrats. Andocides was no professional orator; his style is simple and lively, natural but inartistic.

'''Andrea Andreani''' (1540–1623) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[engraver]] on wood, who was among the first printmakers in Italy to use [[chiaroscuro]], which required multiple colours.
 
Born  and generally active in [[Mantua]] about 1540 (Brulliot says 1560) and died at [[Rome]] in 1623.  His engravings are scarce and valuable, and are chiefly copies of [[Mantegna]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Parmigianino]] and [[Titian]]. The  most remarkable of his works are ''Mercury and Ignorance'', the ''Deluge'', ''Pharaoh's Host Drowned in the Red Sea'' (after Titian), the ''Triumph of Caesar'' (after Mantegna), and ''Christ retiring from the judgment-seat of Pilate'' after a relief by Giambologna. He was active 1584-1610 in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;ULAN&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Budapest Heroes square II Anras.jpg|thumb|Statue of Andrew II, [[Hősök tere|Heroes' Square]], [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]]]
'''Andrew II the Jerosolimitan''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Jeruzsálemi II András/Endre'', [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Andrija II. Arpadović'' [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Ondrej'', [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Андрија II) (c. 1177 – 21 September 1235) was [[King of Hungary]]&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;Andrew II. (2009). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved  19 April 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/23972/Andrew-II&lt;/ref&gt; (1205–1235) and Croatia (1205–1235). He was the younger son of King [[Béla III of Hungary]], who invested him with the government of the [[Principality of Halych]]. However, the boyars of Halych rebelled against his rule and expelled the Hungarian troops. Following their father's death, Andrew continuously conspired against his brother, King [[Emeric of Hungary]] who had to grant him the government of [[Croatia]] and [[Dalmatia]]. When his brother and his infant son died, Andrew ascended the throne and started to grant royal domains to his partisans. He participated in the [[Fifth Crusade]] but he could not achieve any major military success. He was obliged to issue the [[Golden Bull of 1222|Golden Bull]] confirming the privileges of the noblemen of Hungary and later he was also obliged to confirm the special privileges of the clergy. During his long reign, the central power and royal authority potentially weakened. He had several quarrels with his sons.

==The turbulent duke==
Andrew was the second son of King [[Béla III of Hungary|Béla III]] and his first wife, [[Agnes of Antioch]]. As younger son, Andrew had no hope to inherite the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] from his father who wanted to ensure the inheritance of his elder son, [[Emeric of Hungary|Emeric]] and had him crowned already in 1182.

Nevertheless, when Prince [[Vladimir II Yaroslavich|Vladimir II Yaroslavich of Halych]], who had been expelled from his country by his subjects, fled to [[Hungary]] seeking for assistance in 1188, King Béla III had him arrested and occupied his principality and he invested Andrew with [[Halych]]. The child Andrew's rule in Halych must have been only nominal; he  did not even visit his principality. Although, the young prince's troops could get the mastery in 1189 when the [[boyar]]s of [[Halych]] rose against his rule, but shortly afterwards Prince Vladimir II Yaroslavich managed to escape from his captivity and he expelled the Hungarian troops from Halych.

On 23 April 1196, King Béla III died and he left the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] unportioned to his eldest son, Emeric, while Andrew inherited a large amount of money in order to fulfill his father's [[Crusades|Crusader]] oath. However, Andrew used the money to recruit followers among the barons and also sought the assistance of [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria]]. In December 1197, Andrew's troops defeated King Emeric's armies in a battle near to [[Mački|Macsek]] in December 1197. Following Andrew's victory, the king was obliged to transfer the government of the Duchies of [[Croatia]] and [[Dalmatia]] to Andrew.

In the beginning of 1198, [[Pope Innocent III]] requested that Andrew fulfill his father's last wishes and lead a [[Crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]. However, instead of a Crusade, Andrew led a campaign against the neighbouring provinces and occupied [[Zahumlje]] and [[Rama]]. Andrew also went on conspiring with some prelates against his brother, but King Emeric was informed as to Andrew's plans and he personally arrested [[Bishop Boleszlo of Vác]], one of Andrew's main supporters, and he also deprived his brother's followers (''e.g.'', [[Palatine Mog]]) of their privileges. In the summer of 1199, King Emeric defeated Andrew in the [[Battle of Rád]] and Andrew had to flee to Austria. Finally, the two brothers made peace with the mediation of the Papal Legate Gregory, and the king granted rule of Croatia and Dalmatia again to his brother.

Around 1200, Andrew married [[Gertrude of Merania|Gertrude]], a daughter of [[Berthold IV, Duke of Merania]]. It was probably his wife who persuaded him to conspire against his brother again, but when King Emeric, who had realised that Andrew's troops outnumbered his armies, went unarmed, wearing only the crown and the [[sceptre]], to Andrew's camp near [[Varaždin|Varasd]], Andrew immediately surrendered . The king had his brother arrested, but Andrew managed to escape shortly afterwards.

Nevertheless, the king whose health was failing, wanted to secure the ascension of his young son, [[Ladislaus III of Hungary|Ladislaus]], who had been crowned on 26 August 1204. Shortly afterwards, the king reconciled with Andrew whom he appointed to govern the kingdom during his son's minority. After his brother's death on 30 September/November 1204, Andrew took over the government of the kingdom as his nephew's tutor and he also seized the money his brother had deposited on behalf of the child Ladislaus. The Dowager Queen [[Constance of Aragon|Constance]] was anxious for her son's life and she escaped with King Ladislaus to the court of [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]]. Andrew made preparations for a war against [[Austria]], but the child king died on 7 May 1205, thus Andrew inherited the throne.

==''Novæ institutiones''==
Andrew was crowned by [[Archbishop John of Esztergom|Archbishop John of Kalocsa]] on 29 May 1205 in [[Székesfehérvár]], but before the coronation, he had to take an oath. Andrew made a radical alteration in the internal policy followed by his predecessors and he began to bestow the royal estates to his partisans. He called this new policy ''novæ institutiones'' in his deeds, and he declared that ''&quot;Nothing can set bounds to generosity of the Royal Majesty, and the best measure of grants, for a monarch, is immeasurableness&quot;''. He gave away everything - money, villages, domains, whole counties - to the utter impoverishment of the treasury. Andrew was generous primarily with his wife's [[Germans|German]] relatives and followers, which caused discontent among his subjects.

==Struggles for Halych==
During the first years of his reign, Andrew was occupied with the discords within the Principality of Halych. In 1205, he led his armies to the principality to ensure the rule of the child Prince [[Danylo of Halych|Danylo]]. Following his campaign, he adopted the title of ''&quot;King of Galicia and Lodomeria&quot;'' referring to his supremacy over the two neighbouring principalities. In the beginning of the next year, the child Danylo was again expelled from Halych but Andrew denied to give assistance to him because the child prince's opponent, Prince [[Volodymyr III Igorevych]] had bribed him. Nevertheless, in the same year, he made a campaign in Halych and gave assistance to Prince [[Roman Igorevych]] to acquire the throne.

In 1208, taking advantage of the quarrel between Prince Roman Igorevych and his boyars, Andrew occupied Halych and appointed a regent to govern the principality in his name, but Prince Volodymyr III Igorevych managed to reconquer his principality already in the following year.

A group of the aristocrats of his court, scandalised by Andrew's generosity towards his wife's relatives and followers, planned to offer the throne to his cousins, who had been living in the court of the Emperor [[Theodore I Lascaris]] of [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], but their envoy was arrested and Andrew could overcome the conspiracy. In 1211, he granted the [[Burzenland]] to the [[Teutonic Knights]] in order to ensure the security of the southeastern borders of his kingdom against the [[Cumans]]. However, the Teutonic Knights began to establish a country independent of the [[King of Hungary]].

In 1211, Andrew provided military assistance to Prince Danylo to reoccupy Halych. Moreover, in the following year, Andrew lead his armies personally to Halych to repulse the attack of Prince [[Mstislav the Bold|Mstilav of Peresopnytsia]] against Prince Danylo. Shortly afterwards, Prince Danylo, was obliged to leave his country and he sought again Andrew's assistance. Andrew left for his campaign in the summer 1213 when he was informed that a group of conspirators had murdered his queen on 28 September and he had to return.

Following his return, he ordered the execution only the leader of the conspirators and he forgave the other members of the group, which resulted in the emerging antipaty of his son, [[Béla IV of Hungary|Béla]]. Nevertheless, in 1214, Andrew had his son crowned.

In the summer of 1214, Andrew had a meeting with Grand Duke [[Leszek I the White|Leszek I of Poland]] and they agreed that they would divide the Principality of Halych between Hungary and Poland. Their allied troops occupied the neighbouring principality which was granted to Andrew's younger son, [[Coloman of Lodomeria|Coloman]]. However, Andrew denied to transfer the agreed territories to Duke Leszek I who made an alliance with Prince [[Mstislav the Bold|Mstilav of Novgorod]] and they drove away Andrew's troops from the principality.

Shortly afterwards, Andrew made an alliance again with Leszek I and they occupied Halych where again Andrew's son was appointed to prince.

==The Fifth Crusade==
[[File:Andrew II on Holy Land.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Andrew in the [[Holy Land]] (After he defeated [[Sultan of Egypt]])]]
[[File:Hungarian Crusader Knight.png|thumb|right|200 px|Hungarian Crusader Knight]]
In the meantime, Andrew began to deal with the problems of the southern borders of his kingdom. In 1214, the Hungarian troops annexed [[Belgrade]] and [[Braničevo]] from the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]].

In February 1215, Andrew married [[Yolanda de Courtenay|Yolanda]], the niece of [[Henry of Flanders|Henry I]], the Emperor of [[Latin Empire of Constantinople|Constantinople]]. When the Emperor Henry I died on 11 July 1216, Andrew was planning to acquire the imperial throne, but the barons of the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople|Latin Empire]] proclaimed his father-in-law, [[Peter II of Courtenay|Peter of Courtenay]] their emperor.

Nevertheles, Andrew decided to fulfill his father's oath and made preparations for a [[Crusades#Fifth Crusade|Crusade]]. He agreed with the [[Republic of Venice]] to undertake the delivery of his troops to the [[Holy Land]], in exchange he renounced the supremacy over [[Zadar|Zára]] (Zadar) on behalf of the Republic. Andrew and his troops embarked on 23 August 1217 in [[Split (city)|Spalato]] (Split). Before his departure from the city of Split, he had made over to the [[Knights Templar|Templars]] the [[Klis Fortress|Castle of Klis]], a strategic point in the hinterland of Split which controlled the approaches to the town. Andrew appointed [[Pontius de Cruce]], Master of the Order in the Hungarian Kingdom, as a regent in [[Croatia]] and [[Dalmatia]]. They landed on 9 October on [[Cyprus]] from where they sailed to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. The well-mounted army defeated sultan [[Al-Adil I]] ( Sultan of Egypt ) in Bethsaida at [[Jordan River]] on November 10. Muslim forces retreated in their fortress and towns. The catapults and trebuchets didn't arrive on time, so he had fruitless assaults on the fortresses of the [[Lebanon]] and on [[Mount Tabor]]. Afterwards, Andrew spent his time collecting alleged relics.

Andrew set home on ( 18 January 1218). On the way home, he negotiated with King [[Levon I of Armenia]], the Emperor [[Theodore I Laskaris]] of [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]] and Tsar [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]] and arranged several marriage contracts between his children and the courts he visited. When he was staying in [[Nicaea (city)|Nicaea]], his cousins, who had been living there, made an unsuccessful attempt to take his life.

==The Golden Bull and the ''Diploma Andreanum''==
On his return, he found its kingdom in [[anarchy]]. While he had been away in the [[Holy Land]], even his regent, [[Archbishop John of Esztergom]] had been obliged to leave the country and his treasury had been exhausted. He tried to collect money by using new instruments, such as introducing new taxes, undermining the currency and leasing his income to [[Jew]]s and [[Muslim]]s which increased his unpopularity.

His foreign policy was also a total failure. In August 1219, his younger son, Coloman, who had been crowned King of Halych, was expelled from his kingdom by Prince Mstilav of Novgorod. Andrew had to make peace with the Prince of Novgorod and he also engaged his youngest son, [[Andrew of Hungary (prince of Halych)|Andrew]] with one of his opponent's daughter.

In 1220, Andrew entrusted the government of [[Slavonia]], [[Dalmatia]] and [[Croatia]] to his son, Béla. Andrew also enforced Béla to separate from his wife.

In the beginning of 1222, the discontent ''serviens'' (nobles) came to Andrew's court in large numbers, and they persuaded the king to issue the [[Golden Bull of 1222|Golden Bull]] which confirmed their privileges, including the right to disobey the King if he acted not in line with the provisions of the Golden Bull (''ius resistendi'').

In 1223, the junior King Béla IV took back his wife and escaped to Austria fearing of Andrew's anger. Finally, Andrew made an agreement with his son with the mediation of [[Pope Honorius III]] and the junior king took over again the government of [[Slavonia]], [[Dalmatia]] and [[Croatia]]. On 6 June 1224 Andrew made a peace with Duke Leopold VI of Austria.

In 1224, Andrew issued the [[Andreanum Act|''Diploma Andreanum'']] which unified and ensured the special privileges of the [[Transylvanian Saxons]]. It's considered the oldest Autonomy law in the world. In the same year, Andrew expelled the Teutonic Knights from [[Transylvania]] because they had ignored his overlordship.

==Discords with his son==
The junior King Béla IV started, with the authorization of Pope Honorius III, to take back the royal domains in his provinces that Andrew had granted to his partisans during the first half of his reign. Andrew opposed his son's policy and he entrusted Béla with the government of Transylvania while his younger son, [[Coloman of Lodomeria|Coloman]] became the governor of Béla's former provinces.

In the second half of 1226, Andrew lead his armies to Halych on the request of his youngest son, Andrew. Although, Prince Mstilav defeated the royal armies, but finally he agreed to cede the government of the principality to the Hungarian prince.

During 1228, Andrew's two sons started again to take back the former royal domains in their provinces, and they persuaded Andrew to confiscate the estates of the barons who had taken part in the conspiracy against their mother. In 1229, Prince Danylo of Halych expelled Andrew's youngest son from his principality, while [[Frederick II, Duke of Austria]] started to attack the western borders of the kingdom in 1230.

==The Agreement of Bereg==
Andrew, in contrast with the decisions of the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]], often employed [[Jew]]s and [[Muslim]]s in the royal household. Therefore, [[Pope Gregory IX]] requested him to give up this practise. Finally, Andrew was obliged to confirm the Golden Bull and supplement it with a provision that prohibited the employment of non-Christians and also authorised the [[Archbishop of Esztergom]] to punish the king in case he ignored his promise.

In the second half of 1231, Andrew lead his armies to Halych and managed to ensure his youngest son's rule in the principality. On his return to [[Hungary]], [[Archbishop Robert of Esztergom]] took his kingdom under interdict and excommunicated the king's major dignitaries because Andrew insisted on the employment of [[Jew]]s and [[Muslim]]s in his administration. Nevertheless, upon Andrew's request, the Archbishop withdrew the ecclesiastic punishments soon and the Pope promised that the dignitaries of the [[King of Hungary]] would never be excommunicated without his special authorization.

On 20 August 1233, Andrew had a meeting with the legate of Pope Gregory IX in the woods of Bereg, and they made an agreement which ensured the privileges of the clergy. In the autumn of the year, he also met with Duke Frederick II of Austria and they agreed to stop the skirmishes on the border, but the Duke soon broke the agreement.

==His last years==
On 14 May 1234, Andrew, who had lost his second wife in the previous year, married [[Beatrice D'Este (Queen Consort of Hungary)|Beatrice D'Este]] who was thirty years younger than himself. Because of the new marriage, his relationship with his sons worsened.

In the summer of 1234, the [[Bishop John of Bosnia]] excommunicated Andrew because he had not respected some provisions of the Agreement of Bereg. Andrew appealed to the Pope against the bishop's measure. In the autumn of 1234, Prince Danylo laid siege to the capital of Andrew's youngest son who died during the siege. Thus, the Hungarian supremacy over Halych disappeared.

In the beginning of 1235, Andrew made a campaign against [[Austria]] and enforced Duke Frederick II to make a peace.

He was still alive when one of his daughters, [[Elisabeth of Hungary|Elisabeth]], who had died some years before, was canonized on 28 May 1235. Before his death, he was absolved from the excommunication; moreover, the Pope also promised that the King of Hungary and his relatives would not be excommunicated without the special permission of the Pope.

'''''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding''''' is a book by the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Empiricism|empiricist]] [[philosopher]] [[David Hume]], published in 1748. It was a revision of an earlier effort, Hume's ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', published anonymously in [[London]] in 1739&amp;ndash;40. Hume was disappointed with the reception of the ''Treatise'', which &quot;fell stillborn from the press,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The end product of his labours was the ''Enquiry''. The ''Enquiry'' dispensed with much of the material from the ''Treatise'', in favor of clarifying and emphasizing its most important aspects. For example, Hume's views on [[Personal identity (philosophy)|personal identity]], do not appear. However, more vital propositions, such as Hume's argument for the role of [[Habit (psychology)|habit]] in a theory of knowledge, are retained.

This book has proven highly influential, both in the years that would immediately follow and today.  [[Immanuel Kant]] points to it as the book which woke him from his self-described &quot;dogmatic slumber&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;I. [[Kant]] &quot;[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Enquiry'' is widely regarded as a classic in modern philosophical literature.

==Summary==
The argument of the ''Enquiry'' proceeds by a series of incremental steps, separated into chapters which logically succeed one another. After expounding his [[epistemology]], Hume explains how to apply his principles to specific topics.

===Empirical epistemology===
====1. ''Of the different species of philosophy''====

In the first section of the Enquiry, Hume provides a rough introduction to philosophy as a whole. For Hume, philosophy can be split into two general parts: natural philosophy and the philosophy of human nature (or, as he calls it, &quot;moral philosophy&quot;). The latter investigates both actions and thoughts. He emphasizes in this section, by way of warning, that philosophers with nuanced thoughts will likely be cast aside in favor of those whose conclusions more intuitively match popular opinion. However, he insists, precision helps art and craft of all kinds, including the craft of philosophy.

====2. ''Of the origin of ideas''====

Next, Hume discusses the distinction between impressions and ideas. By &quot;impressions&quot;, he means sensations, while by &quot;ideas&quot;, he means memories and imaginings. According to Hume, the difference between the two is that ideas are less ''vivacious'' than impressions. For example, the idea of the taste of an orange is far inferior to the impression (or sensation) of actually eating one. Writing within the tradition of [[empiricism]], he argues that impressions are the source of all ideas.

Hume accepts that ideas may be either the product of mere sensation, or of the imagination working in conjunction with sensation.&lt;ref&gt;In Locke's terminology, this was known as the division between ''simple and complex'' ideas of sense.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hume, the creative faculty makes use of (at least) four mental operations which produce imaginings out of sense-impressions. These operations are ''compounding'' (or the addition of one idea onto another, such as a horn on a horse to create a [[unicorn]]); ''transposing'' (or the substitution of one part of a thing with the part from another, such as with the body of a man upon a horse to make a [[centaur]]); ''augmenting'' (as with the case of a [[giant (mythology)|giant]], whose size has been augmented); and ''diminishing'' (as with [[Lilliput]]ians, whose size has been diminished). (Hume 1974:317) In a later chapter, he also mentions the operations of ''mixing'', ''separating'', and ''dividing''. (Hume 1974:340) [[Image:Missing blue shade.svg|thumb|Fig. 1. The Missing Shade of Blue]]

However, Hume admits that there is one objection to his account: the problem of ''&quot;[[The Missing Shade of Blue]]&quot;''. In this thought-experiment, he asks us to imagine a man who has experienced every shade of blue except for one (see Fig. 1). He predicts that this man will be able to divine the color of this particular shade of blue, despite the fact that he has never experienced it. This seems to pose a serious problem for the empirical account, though Hume brushes it aside as an exceptional case by stating that one may experience a novel idea that itself is derived from combinations of previous impressions. (Hume 1974:319)

====3. ''Of the association of ideas''====

In this chapter, Hume discusses how thoughts tend to come in sequences, as in trains of thought. He explains that there are at least three kinds of associations between ideas: ''resemblance'', ''contiguity'' in space-time, and ''cause-and-effect''. He argues that there must be some ''universal principle'' that must account for the various sorts of connections that exist between ideas. However, he does not immediately show what this principle might be. (Hume 1974:320-321)

====4. ''Skeptical doubts concerning the operations of the understanding (in two parts)''====

In the first part, Hume discusses how the objects of inquiry are either &quot;relations of ideas&quot; or &quot;matters of fact&quot;, which is roughly the [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|distinction]] between [[logical truth|analytic]] and [[fact|synthetic propositions]]. The former, he tells the reader, are proved by demonstration, while the latter are given through experience. (Hume 1974:322) In explaining how matters of fact are entirely a product of experience, he dismisses the notion that they may be arrived at through [[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]] reasoning. For Hume, every effect only follows its cause arbitrarily—they are entirely distinct from one another. (Hume 1974:324)

In part two, Hume inquires into how anyone can justifiably believe that experience yields any conclusions about the world:

::&quot;When it is asked, ''What is the nature of all our reasonings concerning matter of fact?'' the proper answer seems to be, that they are founded on the relation of cause and effect. When again it is asked, ''What is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning that relation?'' it may be replied in one word, ''experience''. But if we still carry on our sifting humor, and ask, ''What is the foundation of all conclusions from experience?'' this implies a new question, which may be of more difficult solution and explication.&quot; (Hume 1974:328)

He shows how a satisfying argument for the validity of experience can be based neither on demonstration (since &quot;it implies no contradiction that the course of nature may change&quot;) nor experience (since that would be a [[circular argument]]). (Hume 1974:330-332) Here he is describing what would become known as the [[problem of induction]].

====5. ''Skeptical solution of these doubts (in two parts)''====

For Hume, we assume that experience tells us something about the world because of ''habit or custom'', which human nature forces us to take seriously. This is also, presumably, the &quot;principle&quot; that organizes the connections between ideas. Indeed, one of the many famous passages of the ''Inquiry'' was on the topic of the incorrigibility of human custom. In a later chapter, he wrote: 

::''&quot;The great subverter of Pyrrhonism or the excessive principles of skepticism is action, and employment, and the occupations of common life. These principles may flourish and triumph in the schools; where it is, indeed, difficult, if not impossible, to refute them. But as soon as they leave the shade, and by the presence of the real objects, which actuate our passions and sentiments, are put in opposition to the more powerful principles of our nature, they vanish like smoke, and leave the most determined skeptic in the same condition as other mortals.&quot;'' (Hume 1974:425)

In the second part, he provides an account of beliefs. He explains that the difference between belief and fiction is that the former produces a certain feeling of confidence which the latter doesn't. (Hume 1974:340)

====6. ''Of probability''====

This short chapter begins with the notions of probability and chance. For him, &quot;probability&quot; means a ''higher chance'' of occurring, and brings about a higher degree of subjective expectation in the viewer. By &quot;chance&quot;, he means all those particular comprehensible events which the viewer considers possible in accord with their experience. However, further experience takes these equal chances, and forces the imagination to observe that certain chances arise more frequently than others. These gentle forces upon the imagination cause the viewer to have strong beliefs in outcomes. This effect may be understood as another case of ''custom or habit'' taking past experience and using it to predict the future. (Hume 1974:346-348)

===Applied epistemology===
====7. ''Of the idea of necessary connection (in two parts)''====

[[Image:Nicolas Malebranche.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Nicolas Malebranche, one of Hume's philosophical opponents]]

Having dispensed with these alternative explanations, he identifies the source of our knowledge of necessary connections as arising out of ''observation of constant conjunction of certain impressions across many instances''. In this way, people know of necessity through rigorous custom or habit, and not from any immediate knowledge of the powers of the will. (Hume 1974:361)

He then produces three explanations for how we account for causation:
# When all objects or events of one kind are immediately followed by objects or events of another kind.
# Where, if there had been no object of the first kind, we would never have seen an object of the second kind.
# Where the appearance of the first object forces one's mind to think about the second one. (Hume 1974:362)

====8. ''Of liberty and necessity (in two parts)''====

Here Hume tackles the problem of how [[liberty]] may be reconciled with metaphysical [[necessity]] (otherwise known as a [[compatibilist]] formulation of [[free will]]). Hume believes that all disputes on the subject have been merely verbal arguments—that is to say, arguments which are based on a lack of prior agreement on definitions. His tactic in this chapter is to repeat his thoughts on the nature of necessity, and define liberty as the ability to act on the basis of one's will. He then shows (quite briefly) how they are compatible notions, and have no bad consequences on ethics or moral life.

====9. ''Of the reason of animals (comparable to man)''====

Hume insists that the conclusions of the Enquiry will be very powerful if they can be shown to apply to animals and not just humans. He believed that animals were able to infer the relation between cause and effect in the same way that humans do: through learned expectations. (Hume 1974:384) He also notes that this &quot;inferential&quot; ability that animals have is not through reason, but custom alone. Hume concludes that there is an innate faculty of instincts which both beasts and humans share, namely, the ability to reason experimentally (through custom). Nevertheless, he admits, humans and animals differ in mental faculties in a number of ways, including: differences in memory and attention, inferential abilities, ability to make deductions in a long chain, ability to grasp ideas more or less clearly, the human capacity to worry about conflating unrelated circumstances, a sagely prudence which arrests generalizations, a capacity for a greater inner library of analogies to reason with, an ability to detach oneself and scrap one's own biases, and an ability to converse through language (and thus gain from the experience of others' testimonies). (Hume 1974:385, footnote 17.)

====10. ''Of miracles (in two parts)''====
{{Main|Of Miracles}}
The next topic which Hume strives to give treatment is that of the reliability of human testimony, and of the role that [[social epistemology|testimony plays a part in epistemology]]. This was not an idle concern for Hume. Depending on its outcome, the entire treatment would give the epistemologist a degree of certitude in the treatment of miracles. 

True to his empirical thesis, Hume tells the reader that, though testimony does have some force, it is never quite as powerful as the direct evidence of the senses. That said, he provides some reasons why we may have a basis for trust in the testimony of persons: because a) human memory can be relatively tenacious; and b) because people are inclined to tell the truth, and ashamed of telling falsities. Needless to say, these reasons are only to be trusted to the extent that they conform to experience. (Hume 1974:389)

And there are a number of reasons to be skeptical of human testimony, also based on experience. If a) testimonies conflict one another, b) there are a small number of witnesses, c) the speaker has no integrity, d) the speaker is overly hesitant or bold, or e) the speaker is known to have motives for lying, then the epistemologist has reason to be skeptical of the speaker's claims. (Hume 1974:390)

There is one final criterion that Hume thinks gives us warrant to doubt any given testimony, and that is f) if the propositions being communicated are miraculous. Hume understands a miracle to be any event which contradicts the laws of nature. He argues that the laws of nature have an overwhelming body of evidence behind them, and are so well demonstrated to everyone's experience, that any deviation from those laws necessarily flies in the face of all evidence. (Hume 1974:391-392)

Moreover, he stresses that talk of the miraculous has no surface validity, for four reasons. First, he explains that in all of history there has never been a miracle which was attested to by a wide body of disinterested experts. Second, he notes that human beings delight in a sense of wonder, and this provides a villain with an opportunity to manipulate others. Third, he thinks that those who hold onto the miraculous have tended towards barbarism. Finally, since testimonies tend to conflict with one another when it comes to the miraculous—that is, one man's religious miracle may be contradicted by another man's miracle—any testimony relating to the fantastic is self-denunciating. (Hume 1974:393-398)

Still, Hume takes care to warn that historians are generally to be trusted with confidence, so long as their reports on facts are extensive and uniform. However, he seems to suggest that historians are as fallible at interpreting the facts as the rest of humanity. Thus, if every historian were to claim that there was a solar eclipse in the year 1600, then though we might at first naively regard that as in violation of natural laws, we'd come to accept it as a fact. But if every historian were to assert that Queen Elizabeth was observed walking around happy and healthy after her funeral, and then interpreted that to mean that they had risen from the dead, then we'd have reason to appeal to natural laws in order to dispute their interpretation. (Hume 1974:400-402)

====11. ''Of a particular providence and of a future state''====
 
Hume continues his application of epistemology to theology by an extended discussion on heaven and hell. The brunt of this chapter allegedly narrates the opinions, not of Hume, but of one of Hume's anonymous friends, who again presents them in an imagined speech by the philosopher [[Epicurus]]. His friend argues that, though it is possible to [[abductive reasoning|trace a cause from an effect]], it is not possible to infer unseen effects from a cause thus traced. The friend insists, then, that even though we might postulate that there is a first cause behind all things—God—we can't infer anything about the afterlife, because we don't know anything of the afterlife from experience, and we can't infer it from the existence of God. (Hume 1974:408)

Hume offers his friend an objection: if we see an unfinished building, then can't we infer that it has been created by humans with certain intentions, and that it will be finished in the future? His friend concurs, but indicates that there is a relevant disanalogy that we can't pretend to know the contents of the mind of God, while we can know the designs of other humans. Hume seems essentially persuaded by his friend's reasoning. (Hume 1974:412-414)

====12. ''Of the academical or skeptical philosophy (in three parts)''====

The first section of the last chapter is organized as an outline of various skeptical arguments. The treatment includes the arguments of atheism, Cartesian skepticism, &quot;light&quot; skepticism, and rationalist critiques of empiricism. Hume shows that even light skepticism leads to crushing doubts about the world which - while they ultimately are philosophically justifiable - may only be combated through the non-philosophical adherence to custom or habit. He ends the section with his own reservations towards Cartesian and Lockean epistemologies.

In the second section he returns to the topic of hard skepticism by sharply denouncing it.

::&quot;For here is the chief and most confounding objection to ''excessive'' skepticism, that no durable good can ever result from it; while it remains in its full force and vigor. We need only ask such a skeptic, ''What his meaning is? And what he proposes by all these curious researches?'' He is immediately at a loss, and knows not what to answer... a Pyrrhonian cannot expect, that his philosophy will have any constant influence on the mind: or if it had, that its influence would be beneficial to society. On the contrary, he must acknowledge, if he will acknowledge anything, that all human life must perish, were his principles universally and steadily to prevail.&quot; (Hume 1974:426)

He concludes the volume by setting out the limits of knowledge once and for all. &quot;''When we run over libraries, persuaded of these principles, what havoc must we make? If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, ''Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number?'' No. ''Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence?'' No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D., ''Inquiries concerning Human Understanding and concerning the Principles of Morals'' Reprinted from 1777 edition, Third Edition, L. A. Selby-Bigge (ed.), Clarendon Press, Oxford, Sect. XII, Part III, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques and rejoinders==
The criteria Hume lists in his examination of the validity of human testimony are roughly upheld in modern social psychology, under the rubric of the communication-persuasion paradigm. Supporting literature includes: the work of [[social impact theory]], which discusses persuasion in part through the number of persons engaging in influence; as well as studies made on the relative influence of communicator [[credibility]] in different kinds of persuasion; and examinations of the [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]]worthiness of the speaker.

The &quot;custom&quot; view of learning can in many ways be likened to [[associationist]] psychology. This point of view has been subject to severe criticism in the research of the 20th century. Still, testing on the subject has been somewhat divided. Testing on certain animals like cats have concluded that they do not possess any faculty which allow their minds to grasp an insight into cause and effect. However, it has been shown that some animals, like chimpanzees, were able to generate creative plans of action to achieve their goals, and thus would seem to have a causal insight which transcends mere custom.&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, Wolfgang.

'''André de Longjumeau''' (also known as '''Andrew of Longjumeau''' in English) was a 13th century [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] missionary and diplomat and one of the most active Occidental diplomats in the East in the 13th century. He led two embassies to the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]]: the first carried letters from [[Pope Innocent IV]] and the second bore gifts and letters from [[Louis IX of France]] to [[Güyük Khan]]. Well acquainted with the [[Middle-East]], he spoke [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and &quot;[[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic|Chaldean]]&quot; (thought to be either [[Syriac language|Syriac]] or [[Persian language|Persian]]).&lt;ref name = &quot;mxpvnk&quot;&gt;Roux, &quot;Les explorateurs&quot;, p.96&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission for the Holy Crown of Thorns==
[[Image:HolyCrown.JPG|thumb|Andrew went to Constantinople to obtain the [[Crown of Thorns]] bought by [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] to [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II]]. It is preserved today in a 19th century reliquary, in [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame Cathedral]], [[Paris]].]]
Andrew's first mission to the East was when he was asked by the French king [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] to go and fetch the [[Crown of Thorns]] which had been sold to him by the Latin king of [[Constantinople]] [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II]] in 1238, who was anxious to obtain support for his tottering empire.&lt;ref name = &quot;mxpvnk&quot;/&gt; Andrew was accompanied on this mission by brother Jacques.

==Papal Mission to the Mongols (1245-1247)==
Andrew of Longjumeau led one of four missions dispatched to the Mongols by [[Pope Innocent IV]]. He left [[Lyon]] in the spring of 1245 for the [[Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory G. Guzman, &quot;Simon of Saint-Quentin and the Dominican Mission to the Mongol Baiju: A Reappraisal&quot; ''Speculum'', Vol. 46, No. 2. (April., 1971), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; He visited Muslim principalities in [[Syria]] and representatives of the [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]] churches in Persia, finally delivering the papal correspondence to a Mongol general near [[Tabriz]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Igor de Rachewiltz]], ''Papal Envoys to the Great Khans'' (Stanford University Press, 1971), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; In Tabriz, André de Longjumeau met with a monk from the [[Far East]], named [[Simeon Rabban Ata]], who had been put in charge by the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of protecting the Christians in the [[Middle-East]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard, &quot;Histoire des Croisades&quot;, p.376&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Mission to the Mongols (1249-1251)==
At the Mongol camp near [[Kars, Turkey|Kars]] Andrew had met a certain [[David and Mark|David]], who in December 1248 appeared at the court of King [[Louis IX of France]] in [[Cyprus]]. Andrew, who was now with Saint Louis, interpreted David's message to the King, a real or pretended offer of alliance from the Mongol general [[Eljigidei]], and a proposal of a joint attack upon the [[Islam]]ic powers of [[Syria]].

In reply to this the French sovereign dispatched Andrew as his ambassador to [[Güyük Khan]]; with Longjumeau went his brother William (also a Dominican) and several others — John Goderiche, John of Carcassonne, Herbert &quot;Le [[Sommelier]],&quot; Gerbert of Sens, Robert (a clerk), a certain William, and an unnamed clerk of [[Poissy]].

The party set out on 27 January 1249, with letters from King Louis and the [[papal legate]], and rich presents, including a chapel-tent, lined with scarlet cloth and embroidered with sacred pictures. From Cyprus they went to the port of [[Antioch]] in Syria, and thence traveled for a year to the Khan's court, going ten leagues (55.56 kilometers) per day. Their route led them through [[Iran|Persia]], along the southern and eastern shores of the [[Caspian Sea]], and certainly through [[Taraz|Talas]], north-east of [[Tashkent]].

On arrival at the supreme Mongol court — either that on the [[Imyl river]] (near [[Lake Alakol]] and the present Russo-Chinese frontier in the [[Altay Mountains|Altay]]), or more probably at or near [[Karakorum]] itself, south-west of [[Lake Baikal]] — Andrew found [[Guyuk Khan|Güyük Khan]] dead, poisoned, as the envoy supposed, by [[Batu Khan]]'s agents. The regent-mother [[Oghul Qaimish]] (the &quot;Camus&quot; of [[William of Rubruck]]) seems to have received and dismissed him with presents and a letter for Louis IX, the latter a fine specimen of Mongol insolence. But it is certain that before the friar had quit &quot;Tartary&quot; [[Möngke Khan|Möngke]], Güyük's successor, had been elected.

Andrew's report to his sovereign, whom he rejoined in 1251 at [[Caesarea Palaestina|Caesarea]] in the [[Palestine]], appears to have been a mixture of history and fable; the latter affects his narrative of the Mongols' rise to greatness, and the struggles of their leader [[Genghis Khan]] with [[Prester John]]; it is still more evident in the position assigned to the [[Mongols|Mongols']] homeland, close to the prison of [[Gog and Magog]]. On the other hand, the envoy's account of Mongol customs is fairly accurate, and his statements about [[Christianity among the Mongols|Mongol Christianity]] and its prosperity, though perhaps exaggerated (e.g. as to the 800 chapels on wheels in the nomadic host), are based on fact.

Mounds of bones marked his road, witnesses of devastations which other historians record in detail. He found Christian prisoners from [[Germany]] in the heart of &quot;Tartary&quot; (at Talas), and was compelled to observe the ceremony of passing between two fires, as a bringer of gifts to a dead [[Genghis Khan|Khan]], gifts which were of course treated by the Mongols as evidence of submission. This insulting behaviour, and the language of the letter with which Andrew reappeared, marked the mission a failure: King Louis, says [[Jean de Joinville|Joinville]], &quot;''se repenti fort''&quot; (&quot;felt very sorry&quot;).

==Death==
Andrew died some time after 1253, while he was active as a missionary in Palestine. The [[Franciscan]] missionary, [[William of Rubruck]], in his work on Asian customs, declares that everything he had heard from Andrew on the subject was fully borne out by his own personal observations.

We only know of Andrew through references in other writers: see especially [[William of Rubruck]]'s in ''Recueil de voyages'', iv. (Paris, 1839), pp.&amp;nbsp;261, 265, 279, 296, 310, 353, 363, 370; Joinville, ed. Francisque Michel (1858, etc.), pp.&amp;nbsp;142, etc.; Jean Pierre Sarrasin, in same vol., pp.&amp;nbsp;254–235; [[William of Nangis]] in ''Recueil des historiens des Gaules'', xx. 359–367; [[Charles de Rémusat|Rémusat]], ''Mémoires sur les relations politiques des princes chrétiens… avec les… Mongols'' (1822, etc.), p.&amp;nbsp;52.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Andriscus''', ({{lang-grc|Ἀνδρίσκος}} ''Andriskos'') and often called the &quot;pseudo-Philip&quot;, was the last [[King of Macedon]] (149 BC - 148 BC), and ruler of [[Edremit (District), Balıkesir|Adramyttium]] in [[Aeolis]] (in western [[Anatolia]]).

In 168 BC, the Romans had invaded [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and overthrew the king, [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]], in the [[Battle of Pydna|First Battle of Pydna]].

In 149 BC, Andriskos, at that time ruler of Adramyttium only, and claiming to be Perseus' son, announced his intention to retake Macedonia from the Romans.

As his first attempt, Andriskos travelled to [[Syria]] to request military help from [[Demetrius I of Syria|Demetrius Soter of Syria]]. Demetrius instead handed him over to the Romans.  

Andriskos escaped from Roman captivity, and raised a [[Thracians|Thracian]] army. With this army, he invaded Macedonia and successfully defeated the Roman praetor [[Publius Juventius]] in 149 BC. Andriskos then declared himself King Philip VI of Macedonia.

In 148 BC, Andriskos conquered [[Thessaly]] and made an alliance with [[Carthage]], thus bringing the Roman wrath on him.  In 148 BC, in what the Romans called the [[Fourth Macedonian War]], he was defeated by the Roman praetor [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus|Q. Caecilius Metellus]] (148) at the [[Battle of Pydna (148 BC)|Second Battle of Pydna]], and fled to [[Thrace]], whose prince gave him up to [[Rome]], thus marking the final end to Andriskos' reign of Macedonia.

Andriscus's brief reign over Macedonia was marked by cruelty and extortion. After this Macedonia was formally reduced to a Roman province.

'''Andronikos III Palaiologos''', Latinized as '''Andronicus III Palaeologus''' ({{lang-el|Ανδρόνικος Γ' Παλαιολόγος, ''Andronikos III Paleologos''}}; March 25, 1297, [[Constantinople]] – June 15, 1341, [[Constantinople]]) reigned as [[Byzantine emperor]] 1328–1341, after being rival emperor since 1321. Andronikos III was the son of [[Michael IX Palaiologos]] and Princess [[Rita of Armenia]] (renamed Maria). His maternal grandparents were King [[Levon II of Armenia (King)|Levon II of Armenia]] and [[Queen Keran of Armenia]].

== Life ==
In 1320, Andronikos accidentally murdered his brother Manuel, whereupon their father died of grief. The murder, and the general dissolute behaviour of Andronikos and his coterie, mostly the young scions of the Empire's great aristocratic clans, resulted in a deep rift in the relations between him and his grandfather, [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]]. The elder Andronikos disowned his grandson, whereupon Andronikos III fled the capital and rallied his supporters around him in [[Thrace]]. From there he waged an intermittent [[Byzantine civil war of 1321–1328|civil war]] against his grandfather, which first secured him recognition of his post as co-emperor, and ultimately led to the deposition of Andronikos II in 1328.

Effective administrative authority during the reign of Andronikos III was wielded by his ''[[megas domestikos]]'' [[John Kantakouzenos]], while the emperor enjoyed himself hunting or waging war. [[Treaty of Chernomen|An alliance]] with his brother-in-law [[Michael Shishman of Bulgaria|Michael Asen III of Bulgaria]] against [[Stefan Decanski|Stefan Uroš III Dečanski]] of [[Raška (state)|Serbia]] failed to secure any gains, as the Serbians defeated the Bulgarians before the latter could join with the Byzantines in the [[Battle of Velbazhd]] (modern [[Kyustendil]]) in 1330. Andronikos III's attempt to make up for this setback by annexing Bulgarian Thrace failed in 1332, when he was defeated by the new Bulgarian emperor [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria|Ivan Alexander]] [[Battle of Rusokastro|at Rousokastron]]. Peace with Bulgaria was secured through territorial concessions and a diplomatic marriage between the children of the two emperors.

The subsequent years witnessed the gradual extinction of Byzantine rule in [[Asia Minor]], as [[Orhan I|Orhan]] of the [[Ottoman Turks]], who had already defeated Andronikos III at [[Battle of Pelekanos|Pelekanos]] in 1329, took [[İznik|Nicaea]] in 1331 and [[Nicomedia]] in 1337. After that, only [[Alaşehir|Philadelpheia]] and a handful of ports remained under Byzantine control in Asia Minor. Earlier Andronikos III had effected the recovery of [[Phocaea]] and the islands of [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]] and [[Chios]] from [[Benedetto Zaccaria]] in 1329, but this did little to stem the Ottoman advance in Asia Minor.

Under [[Stefan Dusan|Stefan Uroš IV Dušan]], Serbia expanded into Byzantine territory in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], taking [[Ohrid]], [[Prilep]], [[Kastoria]], [[Strumica]], and [[Edessa, Greece|Voden]] in about 1334. The one-time governor of [[Thessalonica]], [[Syrgiannes Palaeologos]], had deserted to the side of the Serbians and aided their advance in to Macedonia. The Serbs, led by Syrgiannes, advanced as far as Thessalonica, but there Syrgiannes was betrayed and killed the by the Byzantine general Sphrantzes Palaiologos. This brought the Serbian army into disarray.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, John Julius. ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1996) p. 283-284&lt;/ref&gt; In August of 1334 Stefan Dusan and Andronikos made peace, and the forces of Andronikos were allowed to retake control of those parts of Macedonia that Syrgiannes had captured.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich. ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall'' p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these troubles Andronikos III secured the extension of Byzantine control over [[Thessaly]] in 1333 and [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] in 1337, by taking advantage of succession crises in these principalities.

Andronikos III reorganized the [[Byzantine navy]] (consisted of 10 ships by 1332) and reformed the [[Judiciary|judicial system]] by forming a panel of four universal judges whom he designated &quot;Universal Justices of the Romans&quot;. In retrospect his reign may be said to end before the situation of the [[Byzantine Empire]] became untenable. In spite of several not insignificant reverses at the hands of Bulgarians, Serbians, and Ottomans, the emperor had provided the empire with active leadership, had cooperated with able administrators, and had come closer than any of his predecessors in re-establishing Byzantine control over the Greek peninsula.

The well-known Muslim traveller [[Ibn Battuta]], who visited Constantinople towards the end of 1332, mentions in his memoirs having met Andronikos III. This is not attested in Byzantine sources.

Nicaea, until 1261 the capital of the empire, was under siege by Ottoman Turks. In the summer of 1329, Andronikos III launched a relief attempt which culminated in a defeat at the Battle of Pelekanon on June 10,[15] and in 1331, the city fell. Not wishing to see Nicomedia or the other few remaining forts in Asia Minor suffer the same fate, Andronikos III sought to pay off the Ottomans with tribute — the Ottomans did not stop at this and seized Nicomedia as well in 1337.

Andronikos III died aged 44 in 1341, and was succeeded by his son, [[John V Palaiologos]].

== Family ==
Andronikos III was first married, in 1318, with [[Irene of Brunswick]], daughter of [[Henry I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]]; she died in 1324. They had an unnamed son, who died shortly after birth in 1321.

Andronikos III married as his second wife, in 1326, with [[Anna of Savoy]]. She was a daughter of Count [[Amadeus V, Count of Savoy]] and his second wife Maria of Brabant. They had several children, including:
* [[John V Palaiologos]]
* Michael Palaiologos, ''[[despotes]]''
* Maria (renamed Eirene), who married Emperor [[Michael Asen IV of Bulgaria]]
* Eirene Palaiologos (renamed Maria), who married [[Francesco I of Lesbos]]

According to [[Nicephorus Gregoras]], Andronikos also had an illegitimate daughter, [[Irene Palaiologina of Trebizond]]. She married [[Basil of Trebizond]] and took over the throne of the [[Empire of Trebizond]] from 1340 to 1341.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/BYZANTIUM%2012611453.htm#EirenePdied1341 Profile of Irene in &quot;Medieval Lands&quot; by Charles Cawley]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dictionnaire historique et Généalogique des grandes familles de Grèce, d'Albanie et de Constantinople'' (1983) by Mihail-Dimitri Sturdza adds a second illegitimate daughter of Andronikos, converting to [[Islam]] under the name Bayalun. She was reportedly one of several wives of [[Uzbeg Khan]] of the [[Golden Horde]].&lt;ref&gt;Mihail-Dimitri Sturdza, ''Dictionnaire historique et Généalogique des grandes familles de Grèce, d'Albanie et de Constantinople'' (1983), page 373&lt;/ref&gt; This daughter is not included in the older ''Europäische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europäischen Staaten'' (1978) by Detlev Schwennicke and her existence may reflect Sturdza's own theories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/BYZANTIUM%2012611453.htm#PalaiologinaMUzbekKhan Profile of Bayalun in &quot;Medieval Lands&quot; by Charles Cawley]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

Under Andronikos the Byzantine Empire came closest to regaining a position of power in the Balkan Peninsula since the Fourth Crusade. Although an energetic campaigner, the empire during this period was just too weak to defeat its enemies in Anatolia, Bulgaria and Serbia. His loss of the empire's few remaining territories in Anatolia made the Ottoman Turks posed to expand into Europe as did its lack of strength following his reign to prevent the formation of the Serbian Empire. Yet none of this was due to a lack of leadership on Andronikos' part and his reign could be said to end before the Byzantine Empire's position became untenable due to the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347|ensuing civil war]] which consumed the empire's remaining resources on Andronikos's death.

'''Andronikos II Palaiologos''' ([[Greek Language|Greek]]: '''{{polytonic|Ανδρόνικος Β' Παλαιολόγος}}''') (25 March 1259, [[Nicaea (city)|Nicaea]] – 13 February 1332, [[Constantinople]]) — also '''Andronicus II Palaeologus''' — reigned as [[Byzantine emperor]] from 1282 to 1328.  He was the eldest surviving son of [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] and [[Theodora Doukaina Vatatzina]], grandniece of [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]]. On 8 November 1273, Andronikos II married [[Anne of Hungary (1260–1281)]], daughter of the king [[Stephen V of Hungary]].

==Life==
Andronikos II Palaiologos was acclaimed co-emperor in 1261, after his father Michael VIII recovered [[Constantinople]] from the [[Latin Empire]], but he was crowned only in 1272. Sole emperor from 1282, Andronikos II immediately repudiated his father's unpopular Church union with the [[Papacy]] (which he had been forced to support while his father was still alive), but was unable to resolve the related schism within the Orthodox clergy until 1310. Andronikos II was also plagued by economic difficulties and during his reign the value of the Byzantine ''[[hyperpyron]]'' depreciated precipitously while the state treasury accumulated less than one seventh the revenue (in nominal coins) that it had done previously. Seeking to increase revenue and reduce expenses, Andronikos II raised taxes and reduced tax exemptions, and dismantled the Byzantine fleet (80 ships) in 1285, thereby making the Empire increasingly dependent on the rival republics of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]]. In 1291, he hired 50–60 Genoese ships. Later, in 1320, he tried to resurrect the navy by constructing 20 galleys, but failed.

Andronikos II Palaiologos sought to resolve some of the problems facing the [[Byzantine Empire]] through diplomacy. After the death of his first wife Anne of Hungary, he married [[Irene of Montferrat|Yolanda (renamed Irene) of Montferrat]], putting an end to the Montferrat claim to the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]]. Andronikos II also attempted to marry off his son and co-emperor [[Michael IX Palaiologos]] to the Latin Empress [[Catherine I of Courtenay]], thus seeking to eliminate Western agitation for a restoration of the [[Latin Empire]]. Another marriage alliance attempted to resolve the potential conflict with [[Serbia]] in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], as Andronikos II married off his five-year old daughter [[Simonida|Simonis]] to King [[Stefan Milutin]] in 1298.

[[Image:AndronikosIIandMichaelIXPalaeologusSilverBasilikon.jpg|thumb|left|Andronikos II and [[Michael IX Palaeologus]] (Silver basilikon).]]
In spite of the resolution of problems in [[Europe]], Andronikos II was faced with the collapse of the Byzantine frontier in [[Asia Minor]]. After the failure of the co-emperor Michael IX to stem  the Turkish advance in Asia Minor in 1302 and the disastrous [[Battle of Bapheus]], the Byzantine government hired the [[Catalan Company]] of [[Almogavars]] (adventurers from [[Aragon]] and [[Catalonia]]) led by [[Roger de Flor]] to clear Byzantine Asia Minor of the enemy. In spite of some successes, the Catalans were unable to secure lasting gains. They quarreled with Michael IX, and eventually turned on their Byzantine employers after the murder of Roger de Flor in 1305, devastating [[Thrace]], Macedonia, and [[Thessaly]] on their road to Latin Greece. There they conquered the [[Duchy of Athens]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]. The Turks continued to penetrate the Byzantine possessions, and [[Bursa, Turkey|Prusa]] fell in 1326. By the end of Andronikos II's reign, much of Bithynia was in the hands of the [[Ottoman Turks]] of Osman I and his son and heir [[Orhan I|Orhan]]. Also, [[Karesi]] conquered [[Mysia]] region with [[Balıkesir|Paleokastron]] after 1296, Germiyan conquered [[Simav]] in 1328, Saruhan captured [[Manisa|Magnesia]] in 1313 and [[Aydınoğlu]] captured [[İzmir|Symirna]] in 1310.

The Empire's problems were exploited by [[Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria]], who defeated Michael IX and conquered much of northeastern Thrace in c. 1305–1307. The conflict ended with yet another dynastic marriage, between Michael IX's daughter Theodora and the Bulgarian emperor. The dissolute behavior of Michael IX's son [[Andronikos III Palaiologos]] led to a rift in the family, and after Michael IX's death in 1320, Andronikos II disowned his grandson, prompting a [[First Palaiologan Civil War|civil war]] that raged, with interruptions, until 1328. The conflict precipitated Bulgarian involvement, and [[Michael Shishman of Bulgaria|Michael Asen III of Bulgaria]] attempted to capture Andronikos II under the guise of sending him military support. In 1328 Andronikos III entered Constantinople in triumph and Andronikos II was forced to abdicate. He died as a monk in 1332.

==Family==
In 1274 Andronikos II married as his first wife [[Anna of Hungary]], a daughter of King [[Stephen V of Hungary]] and [[Elizabeth the Cuman]], with whom he had two sons:
* [[Michael IX Palaiologos]]
* Constantine Palaiologos, ''[[despotes]]''
After Anna died in 1281, in 1284 Andronikos II then married [[Irene of Montferrat|Yolanda (renamed Irene)]], a daughter of Marquis [[William VII of Montferrat]], with whom he had:
* John Palaiologos (c. 1286–1308), ''despotes'', married Irene Choumnaina, no issue.
* [[Theodore I of Montferrat|Theodore I, Marquis of Montferrat]] (1291–1338)
* Demetrios Palaiologos (d. after 1343), ''despotes''. Father of [[Irene Palaiologina (Byzantine empress)|Irene Palaiologina]].
* [[Simonida|Simonis Palaiologina]] (1294-after 1336), who married King [[Stefan Milutin]] of Serbia
Andronikos II also had at least two illegitimate daughters:
* Irene, who married [[John II Doukas]], ruler of [[Thessaly]]
* Maria, who married [[Toqta]], khan of the [[Golden Horde]]

'''Andronikos I Komnenos''' (or '''Andronicus I Comnenus''', {{lang-el|Ανδρόνικος Α’ Κομνηνός, ''Andronikos I Komninos''}}; c. 1118 – September 12, 1185) was a [[Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine emperor]] from  1183 to 1185). He was the son of prince [[Isaac Komnenos (d. 1152)|Isaac Komnenos]]. His paternal grandparents were Emperor [[Alexius I Comnenus|Alexios I Komnenos]] and [[Irene Ducaena|Eirene Doukaina]].

==Biography==
===Early years===
Andronikos Komnenos was born early in the 12th century, around 1118. He was endowed by nature with the most remarkable gifts both of mind and body: he was handsome and eloquent, but licentious; and, at the same time, active, hardy, courageous, a great general and an able politician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=hakMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=He+was+endowed+by+nature+with+the+most+remarkable+gifts+both+of+mind+and+body:+he+was+handsome+and+eloquent,+but+licentious%3B+and,+at+the+same+time,+active,+hardy,+courageous,&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TpKyTNywBYGBlAea_LzlDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=He%20was%20endowed%20by%20nature%20with%20the%20most%20remarkable%20gifts%20both%20of%20mind%20and%20body%3A%20he%20was%20handsome%20and%20eloquent%2C%20but%20licentious%3B%20and%2C%20at%20the%20same%20time%2C%20active%2C%20hardy%2C%20courageous%2C&amp;f=false  The Encyclopaedia Britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, and general literature, Volume 2 p. 22]&lt;/ref&gt;

Andronikos' early years were spent in alternate pleasure and military service. In 1141 he was taken captive by the [[Seljuq Turks]] and remained in their hands for a year.  On being ransomed he went to [[Constantinople]], where was held the court of his cousin, the Emperor [[Manuel I Comnenus|Manuel I Komnenos]], with whom he was a great [[favourite]]. Here the charms of his niece, the princess Eudoxia, attracted him and she became his mistress.

In 1152, accompanied by Eudoxia, he set out for an important command in [[Cilicia]].  Failing in his principal enterprise, an attack upon [[Mopsuestia]], he returned, but was again appointed to the command of a province.  This second post he seems also to have left after a short interval, for he appeared again in [[Constantinople]], and narrowly escaped death at the hands of the brothers of Eudoxia.  

About this time (1153) a conspiracy against the emperor, in which Andronikos participated, was discovered and he was thrown into prison.  There he remained for about twelve years, during which time he made repeated but unsuccessful attempts to escape.

===Exile===
At last, in 1165, he was successful in escaping. After passing through many dangers, he reached the court of Prince Yaroslav  of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] ([[Ruthenia]]).  While under the protection of the prince, Andronikos brought about an alliance between him and the emperor Manuel I, and so restored himself to the emperor's favour.  With a Russian army he joined Manuel in the invasion of [[Hungary]] and assisted at the siege of [[Semlin]].

After a successful campaign Manuel I and Andronikos returned together to Constantinople (1168); but a year later, Andronikos refused to take the oath of allegiance to the future king [[Béla III of Hungary]], whom Manuel desired to become his successor.  He was removed from court, but received the province of [[Cilicia]].  

Being still under the displeasure of the emperor, Andronikos fled to the court of [[Raymond of Antioch|Raymond]], [[Principality of Antioch|prince of Antioch]].  While residing here he captivated and seduced the beautiful daughter of the prince, Philippa, sister of the empress [[Maria of Antioch|Maria]].  The anger of the emperor was again roused by this dishonour, and Andronikos was compelled to flee.  

He took refuge with King [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]], whose favour he gained, and who invested him with the [[Principality of Galilee|Lordship of Beirut]].  In Jerusalem he saw [[Theodora Comnena|Theodora Komnene]], the beautiful widow of the late King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]] and niece of the emperor Manuel. Although Andronikos was at that time fifty-six years old, age had not diminished his charms, and Theodora became the next victim of his artful seduction.

To avoid the vengeance of the Emperor, she fled with Andronikos to the court of [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], the [[Rulers of Damascus|Sultan of Damascus]]; but not deeming themselves safe there, they continued their perilous journey through the [[Caucasus]] and [[Anatolia]]. They were well received by the king [[George III of Georgia]], whose anonymous sister had probably been Andronikos’ first wife. Andronikos was granted estates in [[Kakhetia]], in the east of Georgia. In 1073 or 1074, he accompanied the Georgian army on an expedition to [[Shirvan]] up to the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] shores, where George recaptured the fortress of [[Sharaban]] from the invaders from [[Derbent]] for his cousin, the [[shirvanshah]] [[Ahsitan I of Shirvan|Ahsitan I]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Minorsky|Minorsky, Vladimir]], &quot;Khāqānī and Andronicus Comnenus&quot;. ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London'', Vol. 11, No. 3 (1945), pp. 557–558&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finally, Andronikos and Theodora settled in the ancestral lands of the Komnenoi at [[Ünye|Oinaion]], on the shores of the [[Black Sea]], between [[Trebizond]] and [[Sinope]]. 

While Andronikos was on one of his incursions, his castle was surprised by the governor of Trebizond, and Theodora and her two children were captured and sent to Constantinople.  To obtain their release Andronikos in early 1180 made abject submission to the Emperor and, appearing in chains before him, besought pardon.  This he obtained, and was allowed to retire with Theodora into banishment at Oinaion.

===Emperor===
In 1180 the Emperor Manuel died and was succeeded by his 10 year old son [[Alexius II Comnenus|Alexios II]], who was under the guardianship of his mother, Empress Maria. Her Latin origins and culture however led to creeping resentment from her Greek subjects (who felt insulted enough by the late Manuel's Western tastes, let alone being ruled by his Western wife), building up to an explosion of rioting that almost became a full civil war. This gave Andronikos the opportunity to seize the crown for himself, leaving his retirement in 1182 and marching to Constantinople with an army that (according to non-Byzantine sources) included Muslim contingents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Jubayr]] p. 355 Broadhurst (Turks and Arabs); [[William of Tyre]], ''Historia Transmarina'' 22.11 (''innumeras Barbararum nationum secum trahens copias''); [[Walter Map]], ''[[De Nugis Curialium]]'' 2.18 (Turks).&lt;/ref&gt; The defection of the commander of the Byzantine navy, ''[[megas doux]]'' [[Andronikos Kontostephanos]], and the general Andronikos Angelos, played a key role in allowing the rebellious forces to enter Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;Angold p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Andronikos Komnenos' arrival was soon followed by a [[Massacre of the Latins|massacre of the Latin inhabitants]] of the city, who virtually controlled the economy of the city. The massacre resulted in the deaths of 80,000 &quot;Latins&quot;. He was believed to have arranged the poisoning of Alexios II's elder sister [[Maria Komnene (Porphyrogenita)|Maria the Porphyrogenita]] and her husband [[Renier of Montferrat]], although Maria herself had encouraged him to intervene. The poisoner was said to be the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] Pterygeonites. Soon afterwards he had the empress Maria imprisoned and then killed (forcing a signature from the child Emperor Alexius to put his mother to death), by Pterygeonites and the ''[[hetaireiarches]]'' Constantine Tripsychos. Alexios II was compelled to acknowledge Andronikos as colleague in the empire and was then quickly put to death in turn; the killing was carried out by Tripsychos, Theodore Dadibrenos and [[Stephen Hagiochristophorites]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Niketas Choniates]], ''Histories'' pp. 260–274 van Dieten.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Andronikos, now (1183) sole emperor, married [[Agnes of France, Empress consort of the Eastern Roman Empire|Agnes of France]], a child twelve years of age, formerly betrothed to Alexios II. Agnes was a daughter of King [[Louis VII of France]] and his third wife [[Adèle of Champagne]]. By November 1183, Andronikos associated his younger legitimate son John Komnenos on the throne. A Venetian embassy visited Constantinople in 1184 and an agreement was reached that compensation of 1,500 gold pieces would be paid for the losses incurred in 1171.

His short reign was characterized by strong and harsh measures.  He resolved to suppress many abuses, but above all things, to check [[feudalism]] and limit the power of the nobles, who were rivals for his throne.  The people, who felt the severity of his laws, at the same time acknowledged their justice and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors who had grown corrupt under the safety and opulence of [[Manuel I Komnenos|Manuel I]] rule. However, as Andronikos' rule went on, the Emperor became increasingly paranoid and violent – in September 1185, Andronikos ordered the execution of all prisoners, exiles and their families for collusion with the invaders – and the Byzantine Empire descended into a terror state. The aristocrats in turn were infuriated against him. There were several revolts, the stories of chaos leading to an invasion by King [[William II of Sicily|William]] of the Norman Sicilians.  William (with a fleet of 200 ships) landed in [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] with a strong force (80,000 men including 5,000 knights), and marched as far as [[Thessalonica]], which he took and pillaged ruthlessly (7,000 Greeks died). Andronikos hastily assembled five different armies to stop the Sicilian army from reaching Constantinople, but none of these five smaller armies would stand against the Sicilian forces and retreated to the outlying hills. Andronikos also assembled a fleet of 100 ships to stop the Norman fleet from entering the [[Sea of Marmara]].  The invaders were finally driven out in 1186 by his successor, [[Isaac II Angelus|Isaac Angelos]].

===Death===
[[Image:Death of andronic I.png|thumb|250px|A medieval depiction of the death of Andronikos. Original in the Bibliothèque Nationale, France.]]

Andronikos seems then to have resolved to exterminate the aristocracy, and his plans were nearly successful. But on September 11, 1185, during his absence from the capital, Stephen Hagiochristophorites moved to arrest [[Isaac II Angelus|Isaac Angelos]], whose loyalty was suspect. Isaac killed Hagiochristophorites and took refuge in the church of [[Hagia Sophia]]. He appealed to the populace, and a tumult arose which spread rapidly over the whole city. 

When Andronikos arrived he found that his authority was overthrown: Isaac had been proclaimed Emperor. The deposed Emperor attempted to escape in a boat with his wife Agnes and his mistress, but was captured (note that by some, Andronikos not only survived, but also managed to escape to the then self-proclaimed Kingdom of [[Cyprus]]). Isaac handed him over to the city mob and for three days he was exposed to their fury and resentment, remaining for that period tied to a post and beaten. His right hand was cut off, his teeth and hair were pulled out, one of his eyes was gouged out, and, among many other sufferings, boiling water was thrown in his face, punishment probably associated with his handsomeness and life of licentiousness. At last, led to the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]], he was hung up by the feet between two pillars, and two Latin soldiers competed as to whose sword would penetrate his body more deeply, and finally his body, according to the representation of his death, was torn apart. He died on September 12, 1185.  At the news of the emperor's death, his son and co-emperor John was murdered by his own troops in [[Thrace]].

Andronikos I was the last of the [[Comnenus|Komnenoi]] to rule Constantinople, although his grandsons [[Alexios I of Trebizond|Alexios]] and [[David Komnenos|David]] founded the [[Empire of Trebizond]] in 1204.  Their branch of the dynasty was known as the &quot;Great Komnenoi&quot; (''Megaskomnenoi'').

==Family==
Andronikos I Komnenos was married twice and had numerous mistresses.  By his first wife, whose name is not known, he had three children:
* [[Manuel Komnenos (born 1145)]], who married [[Rusudan, daughter of Giorgi III of Georgia|Rusudan]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and was the father of Emperor [[Alexios I of Trebizond|Alexios I]] and [[David Komnenos]], the founders of the [[Empire of Trebizond]]
* John Komnenos (apparently born 1159 or 1160), who was co-emperor with his father from 1183 to 1185 and was killed in that year
* Maria Komnene
By his mistress [[Theodora Komnene]], Andronikos I had the following issue:
* [[Alexios Komnenos (son of Andronikos I)|Alexios Komnenos]] (c. 1170–1199), an alleged forefather of the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] noble family of [[Andronikashvili]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelsey Jackson Williams (2006), A Genealogy of the Grand Komnenoi of Trebizond. ''Foundations – the Journal of the Foundation for Medieval Genealogy'' – [http://fmg.ac/FMG/Journal/02-03.htm Vol. 2, No. 3].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eirene Komnene (born c. 1169), who was briefly married to Alexios Komnenos, a son of Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] by Theodora Batatzina.

== Portrayal in fiction ==
Andronikos is said to be a character in Michael Arnold's ''Against the Fall of Night'' (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1975). He is among the main characters of the historical novel ''Agnes of France'' (1980) by [[Greeks|Greek]] writer [[Kostas Kyriazis]] (b. 1920). The novel describes the events of the reigns of Manuel I, Alexios II and Andronikos I through the eyes of Agnes. The novel ends with the death of Andronikos.  He is also mentioned in the [[Louis L'Amour]] medieval historical novel, ''[[The Walking Drum]]''.

Andronikos was also portrayed in the novel ''[[Baudolino]]'' by [[Umberto Eco]], with much detail being given to his grisly end.

'''Andronicus of [[Cyrrhus]]''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]:Ανδρόνικος Κυρρήστου) or '''Andronicus Cyrrhestes''',son of Hermias, was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[astronomer]] who flourished about 100 BC.

He built a [[horologium]] at [[Athens]], the so-called [[Tower of the Winds]], a considerable portion of which still exists. It is octagonal, with figures carved on each side, representing the eight principal winds. In antiquity a bronze figure of [[Triton (god)|Triton]] on the summit, with a rod in his hand, turned round by the wind, pointed to the quarter from which it blew. From this model is derived the custom of placing weathercocks on steeples.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Andronicus of Rhodes''' ([[floruit|fl.]] c. 60 BC) was a [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] from [[Rhodes]] who was also the eleventh [[scholarch]] of the [[Peripatetic school]].&lt;ref&gt;Ammonius, ''In de Int.'' 5.24&lt;/ref&gt;

He was at the head of the Peripatetic school at [[Rome]], about [[58 BC]], and was the teacher of [[Boethus of Sidon]], with whom [[Strabo]] studied.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, xiv.; Ammonius, ''in Aristot. Categ.''.&lt;/ref&gt; We know little more of the life of Andronicus, but he is of special interest in the history of philosophy, from the statement of [[Plutarch]],&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Sulla'' c. 26&lt;/ref&gt; that he published a new edition of the works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Theophrastus]], which formerly belonged to the library of [[Apellicon]], and were brought to [[Rome]] by [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] with the rest of Apellicon's library in 84 BC. [[Tyrannion of Amisus|Tyrannion]] commenced this task, but apparently did not do much towards it.&lt;ref&gt;Comp. Porphyry, ''Vit. Plotin.'' c. 24; Boethius, ''ad Aristot. de Interpret.''&lt;/ref&gt; The arrangement which Andronicus made of Aristotle's writings seems to be the one which forms the basis of our present editions and we are probably indebted to him for the preservation of a large number of Aristotle's works.

Andronicus wrote a work upon Aristotle, the fifth book of which contained a complete list of the philosopher's writings, and he also wrote commentaries upon the ''Physics'', ''Ethics'', and ''Categories''. None of these works is extant. Two treatises are sometimes erroneously attributed to him, one ''On Emotions'', the other a commentary on Aristotle's ''Ethics'' (really by [[Constantine Palaeocapa]] in the 16th century, or by [[John Callistus]] of Thessalonica).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ammianus Marcellinus''' (325/330–after 391) was a fourth-century [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historian. He wrote the penultimate major historical account surviving from Antiquity (the last was written by [[Procopius]]). His work chronicled in Latin the history of Rome from 96 to 378, although only the sections covering the period 353–378 are extant.&lt;ref name = &quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9007199/Ammianus-Marcellinus Encyclopædia Britannica Online - Ammianus Marcellinus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Ramsay | first = William | authorlink = William Ramsay (classical scholar) | title = Ammmianus Marcellinus | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 142–144 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0151.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ammianus was born between 325 and 330 in the [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking East,&lt;ref name=&quot;Greek&quot;&gt;''Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Classical World,'' Israel Shatzman, Michael Avi-Yonah, 1975 Harper and Row, p.37, ISBN 0060101784 &lt;br&gt;''East and West Through Fifteen Centuries: Being a General History from B.C. 44 to A.D. 1453,'' George Frederick Young, 1916 Longmans, Green and Co, p. 336 &lt;br&gt;University of California Publications in Linguistics, University of California, Berkeley, 1943 University of California Press, p. 3 &lt;br&gt;Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes, Cambridge University Press, p. lxvii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; possibly at [[Antioch]].&lt;ref&gt;The possibility hinges on whether he was the recipient of a surviving letter to a Marcellinus from a contemporary, Libanius - Matthews 1989: 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving books of his history, the 'Res Gestae', cover the years 353 to 378.&lt;ref&gt;The Eye of Command, Kimberly Kagan, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Ammianus served as a soldier in the army of [[Constantius II]] in Gaul and [[Persia]].

He was &quot;a former soldier and a [[Greek people|Greek]]&quot; (''miles quondam et graecus''),&lt;ref&gt;Amm. 31.16.9&lt;/ref&gt; he tells us, and his enrollment among the elite ''protectores domestici'' (household guards) shows that he was of noble birth. He entered the army at an early age, when [[Constantius II]] was emperor of the East, and was sent to serve under [[Ursicinus (Roman general)|Ursicinus]], governor of [[Nisibis]] in [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]], and ''magister militum''.

He returned to Italy with Ursicinus, when he was recalled by Constantius, and accompanied him on the expedition against [[Claudius Silvanus]], who had been forced by the allegedly unjust accusations of his enemies into proclaiming himself emperor in [[Gaul]]. With Ursicinus he went twice to the East. On one occasion he was separated from Ursicinus and took refuge in [[Amida (Roman city)|Amida]], which was then besieged by the Sassanid king [[Shapur II]]; he barely escaped with his life.&lt;ref&gt;The Eye of Command, Kimberly Kagan pp29-30&lt;/ref&gt;  When Ursicinus lost his office and the favour of Constantius, Ammianus seems to have shared his downfall; but under [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], Constantius's successor, he regained his position. He accompanied this emperor, for whom he expresses enthusiastic admiration, in his campaigns against the [[Alamanni]] and the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]]. After the death of Julian, he took part in the retreat of [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] as far as Antioch. He was residing in Antioch in 372 when one Theodorus was thought to have been identified by divination as a new Emperor, successor to [[Valens]], and with many others implicated by the use of torture, cruelly punished. Though [[pagan]], he was mostly tolerant of Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Treadgold1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Warren T. Treadgold|title=A history of the Byzantine state and society|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nYbnr5XVbzUC&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=22 August 2010|year=1997|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804726306|pages=133–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
[[File:Diyarbakirwalls2.jpg|thumb|The walls of Amida, built by [[Constantius II]] before the [[Siege of Amida]] of 359]]

At Rome, he wrote in Latin a history of the Roman empire from the accession of [[Nerva]] (96) to the death of Valens at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] (378),&lt;ref&gt;The Eye of Command, Kimberly Kagan, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; in effect writing a continuation of the history of [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]]. He presumably completed the work before 391, since at 22.16.12 he praises the [[Serapeum]] in Egypt as the glory of the empire, and the temple was destroyed by Christians at the end of that year. ''Res Gestae'' (''Rerum gestarum Libri XXXI'') was originally in thirty-one books, but the first thirteen are lost (modern historian T.D. Barnes argues that the original was actually thirty-six books, which would mean that eighteen books had been lost). The surviving eighteen books cover the period from 353 to 378. As a whole it has been considered extremely valuable, being a clear, comprehensive and in general impartial account of events by a contemporary. Like many ancient historians, Ammianus had a strong political and religious agenda to pursue, however, and he contrasted [[Constantius II]] with [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] to the former's constant disadvantage; like all ancient writers he was skilled in rhetoric, and this shows in his work.

===Critique===
[[Edward Gibbon]] judged Ammianus &quot;an accurate and faithful guide, who composed the history of his own times without indulging the prejudices and passions which usually affect the mind of a contemporary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward, ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter 26.5&lt;/ref&gt; But he also condemned Ammianus for lack of literary flair: &quot;The coarse and undistinguishing pencil of Ammianus has delineated his bloody figures with tedious and disgusting accuracy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Chapter 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian historian [[:de:Ernst Stein (Historiker)|Ernst Stein]] praised Ammianus as &quot;the greatest literary genius that the world produced between Tacitus and Dante&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;E. Stein, ''Geschichte des spätrömischen Reiches,'' Vienna 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Kimberly Kagan]], his accounts of battles emphasize the experience of the soldiers but at the cost of ignoring the bigger picture.  As a result it is difficult for the reader to understand why the battles he describes had the outcome they did.&lt;ref&gt;The Eye of Command, Kimberly Kagan, pp. 27-29.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Scholars have often believed that Ammianus' work was intended for public recitation for two reasons: the overwhelming presence of accentual [[clausula]]e, which implies that it was intended to be read aloud; and epistle 1063 of Libanius to a Marcellinus of Rome which refers to public recitations. However, virtually all major works of Greek and Latin prose possessed such clausulae; and some scholars have rejected the identification of Libanius' Marcellinus with Ammianus, since Marcellinus was a very common name and the tone suggests Libanius was addressing a man much younger than himself (Ammianus was his contemporary). It is a striking fact that Ammianus, though a professional soldier, gives excellent pictures of social and economic problems, and in his attitude to the non-Roman peoples of the empire he is far more broad-minded than writers like [[Livy]] and [[Tacitus]]; his digressions on the various countries he had visited are particularly interesting.  

Ammianus' work contains a detailed description of the [[365 Crete earthquake|tsunami]] in Alexandria which devastated the metropolis and the shores of the eastern Mediterranean on 21 July 365. His report describes accurately the characteristic sequence of earthquake, retreat of the sea and sudden giant wave.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Gavin (2004): “Ammianus and the Great Tsunami”, in: ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', 94, 141-167 (141). Note that in the fifth century BC the Greek historian [[Thucydides]] had already connected these seismic events in his ''Peloponnesian War''(see Book I, 22).&lt;/ref&gt;

His work has suffered terribly from the manuscript transmission. Aside from the loss of the first thirteen books, the remaining eighteen are in many places corrupt and [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunose]]. The sole surviving manuscript from which almost every other is derived is a ninth-century [[Charlemagne|Carolingian]] text, ''V'', produced in [[Fulda]] from an insular exemplar. The only independent textual source for Ammianus lies in ''M'', another ninth-century [[Franks|Frankish]] [[codex]] which was, unfortunately, unbound and placed in other codices during the fifteenth century. Only six leaves of ''M'' survive; however, the printed edition of [[Gelenius]] (''G'') is considered to be based on ''M'', making it an important witness to the textual tradition of the ''Res Gestae.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;&gt;Clark, ''Text Tradition.''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apollo 13''' was the seventh manned mission in the [[United States|American]] [[Apollo program|Apollo space program]] and the third intended to [[moon landing|land on the Moon]]. The craft was successfully launched toward the Moon, but the landing had to be aborted after an oxygen tank exploded, severely damaging the spacecraft's electrical system. The flight was commanded by [[Jim Lovell|James A. Lovell]] with [[Jack Swigert|John L. &quot;Jack&quot; Swigert]] as Command Module pilot and [[Fred W. Haise]] as Lunar Module pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for the original CM pilot [[Ken Mattingly]], who was grounded by the flight surgeon after exposure to [[German measles]].

The mission was launched on April 11, 1970 at 13:13 [[Central Time Zone (Americas)|CST]]. Two days later an oxygen tank ruptured which crippled the service module upon which the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module]] depended. To conserve its batteries and the oxygen needed for the last hours of flight, the crew instead used the [[Lunar Module]]'s resources as a &quot;lifeboat&quot; during the return trip to Earth. Despite great hardship caused by limited power, loss of cabin heat, shortage of potable water and the critical need to jury-rig the carbon dioxide removal system, the crew returned safely to Earth on April 17. 

==Crew==
===Prime and back up crew===
By the standard crew rotation in place during the Apollo program, the prime crew for Apollo 13 would have been the backup crew for [[Apollo 10]] with Mercury and Gemini veteran [[L. Gordon Cooper]] in command. That crew was composed of
*[[Gordon Cooper|L. Gordon Cooper, Jr]] (Commander)
*[[Donn F. Eisele]] (Command Module Pilot)
*[[Edgar Mitchell|Edgar D. Mitchell]] (Lunar Module Pilot)

However, [[Deke Slayton]] never intended to rotate Cooper and Eisele to another mission, as both were out of favor with NASA management for various reasons (Cooper for his lax attitude towards training, and Eisele for incidents aboard [[Apollo 7]] and an [[affair|extra-marital affair]]). He assigned them to the backup crew simply because of a lack of flight-qualified manpower in the Astronaut Office at the time the assignment needed to be made.&lt;ref name=slayton&gt;Donald K. Slayton, &quot;Deke!&quot; (New York: Forge, 1994), 236&lt;/ref&gt; Slayton felt Cooper had a very small chance of receiving the Apollo 13 command if he did an outstanding job with the assignment, which he didn't. Despite Eisle's issues with management, Slayton always intended to assign him to a future [[Apollo Applications Program]] mission rather than a lunar mission, but this program was eventually cut down to only the [[Skylab]] component.

Thus, the original assignment Slayton submitted to his superiors for this flight was:

*[[Alan Shepard|Alan B. Shepard, Jr]] (Commander)

However, for the first time ever, Slayton's recommendation was rejected by management, who felt that Shepard needed more time to properly train for a lunar flight, since he had only recently benefited from experimental surgery to correct an [[Meniere's disease|inner ear disorder]] which kept him grounded since [[Mercury-Redstone 3|his first Mercury flight]] in 1961. Thus, Lovell's crew, backup for the historic [[Apollo 11]] mission and therefore slated for [[Apollo 14]], was swapped with Shepard's crew&lt;ref name=slayton/&gt; and the original crew selection for the mission became:

Prime crew:
{{Spaceflight crew
|terminology      = Astronaut
|position1        = Commander
|crew1_up         = [[Jim Lovell|James A. Lovell, Jr.]]
|position2        = Command Module Pilot
|crew2_up         = [[Ken Mattingly]]
|position3        = Lunar Module Pilot
|crew3_up         = [[Fred Haise|Fred W. Haise, Jr.]]
}}

Backup crew:
{{Spaceflight crew
|terminology      = Astronaut
|position1        = Commander
|crew1_up         = [[John Young (astronaut)|John W. Young]]
|position2        = Command Module Pilot
|crew2_up         = [[Jack Swigert|John L. Swigert]]
|position3        = Lunar Module Pilot
|crew3_up         = [[Charles Duke|Charles M. Duke, Jr]]
}}

Ken Mattingly was originally slated to be the Command Module pilot. Seven days before launch, Charles Duke contracted [[rubella|German measles]] from one of his children. This exposed both prime and backup crews, who trained together.  Mattingly was found to be the only one of the other five who had not had measles as a child and thus not immune. Three days before launch, based on demand of the Flight Surgeon, Swigert was moved to the prime crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/swigert-jl.html| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=Astronaut Bio: John L. Swigert| month=January| year=1983| publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the crew for the flight was Lovell, Haise and Swigert.

Crew at launch:

{{Spaceflight crew
|terminology      = Astronaut
|position1        = Commander
|crew1_up         = Jim Lovell
|flights1_up      = Fourth
|position2        = Command Module Pilot
|crew2_up         = Jack Swigert
|flights2_up      = First
|position3        = Lunar Module Pilot
|crew3_up         = Fred Haise
|flights3_up      = First
}}

Mattingly never contracted the measles, and was assigned after the flight as Command Module pilot to Young's crew, which later flew [[Apollo 16]], the fifth mission to land on the moon.

==Launch incident==
[[File:Apollo 13 liftoff-KSC-70PC-160HR.jpg|thumb|left|Apollo 13 launches from Kennedy Space Center, April 11, 1970.]]
The mission began with a little-known smaller incident: during the second-stage boost, the center (inboard) engine shut down two minutes early. The four outboard engines burned longer to compensate, and the vehicle continued to a successful orbit.  The shutdown was determined to be due to dangerous [[pogo oscillation]]s that might have torn the second stage apart. The engine experienced 68''g'' vibrations at 16 hertz, flexing the thrust frame by {{convert|3|in|mm}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4204/ch22-7.html Apollo 14 Launch Operations (comments on Apollo 13 pogo)], Moonport: A History of Apollo Launch Facilities and Operations, NASA&lt;/ref&gt; The engine shutdown was triggered by sensed thrust chamber pressure fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071213010936/http://www.engineeringatboeing.com/articles/pogo.htm Pogo], Jim Fenwick, ''Threshold'' - Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne’s engineering journal of power technology, Spring 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller pogo oscillations had been seen on previous Titan and Saturn flights (notably Apollo 6), but on Apollo 13 they were amplified by an unexpected interaction with turbopump [[cavitation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/winter2004/05.html Mitigating Pogo on Liquid-Fueled Rockets], Aerospace Corporation Crosslink magazine, Winter 2004 edition&lt;/ref&gt; Later missions implemented anti-pogo modifications that had been under development.  These included addition of a helium gas reservoir to the center engine [[liquid oxygen]] line to dampen pressure oscillations, an automatic cutoff as a backup, and simplification of the propellant valves of all five second-stage engines.

==Oxygen tank incident==
===Explosion===
{{Listen|filename=Apollo13-wehaveaproblem.ogg|title=&quot;Houston, we've had a problem.&quot;|description=Swigert and Lovell reporting the incident on April 14, 1970|format=[[Ogg]]}}
En route to the Moon, approximately {{convert|200000|mi|km}} from Earth, [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Mission Control]] asked the crew to turn on the hydrogen and oxygen tank stirring fans, which were designed to destratify the [[cryogenic]] contents and increase the accuracy of their quantity readings. Approximately 93 seconds later the astronauts heard a loud &quot;bang&quot;, accompanied by fluctuations in electrical power and firing of the attitude control thrusters.&lt;ref name = &quot;timeline&quot;/&gt;  The crew initially thought that a [[meteoroid]] might have struck the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM).

In fact, the number 2 oxygen tank, one of two in the [[Apollo service module|Service Module]] (SM), had exploded.&lt;ref&gt;Note that NASA's official report ([http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700076776_1970076776.pdf REPORT OF APOLLO 13 REVIEW BOARD]) does not itself use the word &quot;explosion&quot; in describing the tank rupture. Rupture disks and other safety measures were present to prevent a catastrophic explosion, and analysis of pressure readings and subsequent ground-testing determined that these safety measures worked as designed. [http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700076776_1970076776.pdf See findings 26 and 27 on page 195 (5-22) of the NASA report].&lt;/ref&gt;  Damaged [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] insulation on the wires to the stirring fan inside oxygen tank 2 allowed the wires to [[short circuit|short-circuit]] and ignite this insulation. The resulting fire rapidly increased pressure beyond its {{convert|1,000|psi|MPa}} limit and the tank dome failed, filling the fuel cell bay (Sector 4) with rapidly expanding gaseous oxygen and combustion products. It is also possible some combustion occurred of the [[Mylar]]/[[Kapton]] thermal insulation material used to line the oxygen shelf compartment in this bay.&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{Citation| last = Cortright| first = Edgar| title = Report of the Apollo 13 Review Board|  date = June 15, 1970| url = http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700076776_1970076776.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollo13 - SM after separation.jpg|thumb|Apollo 13's damaged Service Module, as photographed from the Command Module after being jettisoned]]
The resulting pressure inside the compartment popped the bolts attaching the Sector 4 outer aluminum skin panel, which as it blew off probably caused minor damage to the nearby high-gain [[Unified S-Band|S-band]] antenna used for translunar communications. Communications and telemetry to Earth were lost for 1.8 seconds, until the system automatically corrected by switching the antenna from narrow-band to wide-band mode.

Mechanical shock forced the oxygen valves closed on the number 1 and number 3 fuel cells, which left them operating for only about three minutes on the oxygen in the feed lines. The shock also either partially ruptured a line from the number 1 oxygen tank, or caused its check or relief valve to leak, causing its contents to leak out into space over the next 130 minutes, entirely depleting the SM's oxygen supply.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

Because the fuel cells combined hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity and water, the remaining fuel cell number 2 finally shut down and left the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module]] (CM) on limited-duration battery power. The crew was forced to shut down the CM completely and to use the LM as a &quot;lifeboat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1970-029A |title=Apollo 13 Command and Service Module CSM |publisher=NASA |accessdate=October 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had been suggested during an earlier training simulation but had not been considered a likely scenario.&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, Jim, and Jeffrey Kluger. Apollo 13. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2000. 83-87&lt;/ref&gt; Without the LM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1970-029C |title=Apollo 13 Lunar Module ALSEP |publisher=NASA |accessdate=October 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the accident would certainly have been fatal.

===Crew survival and return journey===
[[File:Apollo 13 timeline.svg|left|thumb|250px|Apollo 13's complete circumlunar flight trajectory drawn to scale, showing its distance to the Moon when the accident occurred.|The [[circumlunar trajectory]] followed by Apollo 13. At the time of the accident, the Moon's gravitational pull on Apollo 13 was greater than the Earth's.]]
[[File:Direct Abort Trajectory - Lunar Landing Symposium, MSC Jun66.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The Direct Abort return trajectory was not viable by this time.]]

The damage to the Service Module made safe return from a lunar landing impossible, so Lead Flight Director [[Gene Kranz]] immediately aborted the mission. The existing abort plans, first drawn up in 1966, were evaluated; the quickest was a Direct Abort trajectory, which required using the Service Module engine to achieve a large change in velocity to essentially reverse the direction of the craft. Though this would get the men home quickest with the least drain on consumables, it was highly impractical for the following reasons:
*It was practical only in an earlier stage of the mission, before the craft entered the Moon's gravitational [[Sphere of influence (astrodynamics)|sphere of influence]], which Apollo 13 had already done at the time of the accident.
*There was no practical way to get electrical power to fire the engine.
*It was feared the engine might have been damaged if the O2 tank had exploded, preventing the engine from being fired safely.
For these reasons, Kranz and Flight Director [[Chris Kraft]] chose the circumlunar &quot;free return&quot; option, using the Moon's gravity to return the ship to Earth, with an acceleration burn shortly after [[pericynthion]] (closest approach to the Moon, &quot;PC+2 burn&quot;) to help speed the return. However, Apollo 13 had left its initial [[free return trajectory]] earlier in the mission, as required for the planned lunar landing at Fra Mauro. Therefore, the first order of business was to re-establish the free return trajectory with a small burn of the LM descent propulsion system. The descent engine was used again for the '''PC+2''' burn. One more descent engine burn was later required for a minor course correction.

[[File:Apollo 13 LM with Mailbox retouched.jpg|thumb|The &quot;mailbox&quot; rig improvised to adapt the [[Command Module]]'s square [[carbon dioxide]] scrubber cartridges to fit the [[Lunar Module]], which took a round cartridge]]
Considerable ingenuity under extreme pressure was required from the crew, [[flight controller]]s, and support personnel for the safe return. The developing drama was shown on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=spaceprogram |title=Space Program and Television |publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communication |accessdate=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because electrical power was severely limited, no more live TV broadcasts were made; TV commentators used models and animated footage as illustrations. Low power levels made even voice communications difficult.

The LM &quot;lifeboat&quot; consumables were intended to sustain two people for only two days, not three people for four days. Oxygen was the least critical consumable because the LM carried enough to repressurize the LM after each surface [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]. Unlike the CSM, which was powered by fuel cells that produced water as a byproduct, the LM was powered by [[Silver-oxide battery|silver-zinc batteries]], so electrical power and water (used for equipment cooling as well as drinking) were critical consumables. To keep the LM life support and communication systems operational until re-entry, the LM was powered down to the lowest levels possible.

[[File:Apollo 13 Lunar Module.jpg|thumb|The Apollo 13 lunar module Aquarius is jettisoned above the Earth after serving as a lifeboat for four days. It reentered Earth's atmosphere over Fiji and burned up.]]
Limited available [[lithium hydroxide]] (LiOH) for [[carbon dioxide scrubber|removing carbon dioxide]] presented a serious problem. The LM's internal stock of LiOH canisters was not sufficient to support the crew until return, and the remainder was stored in the descent stage, out of reach. The CM had an adequate supply of canisters, but these were incompatible with the LM. Engineers on the ground improvised a way to join the cube-shaped CM canisters to the LM's cylindrical canister-sockets by drawing air through them with a suit return hose. The astronauts called the [[jury-rigged]] device &quot;the mailbox&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2002-000056.html|title=Interior View of the Apollo 13 Lunar Module and the &quot;Mailbox&quot;|date=January 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem to be solved for a safe return was accomplishing a complete power-up from scratch of the completely shut-down Command Module, something never intended to be done in-flight. Flight controller [[John Aaron]], with the support of grounded astronaut Mattingly and many engineers and designers, had to invent a new protocol to do this with the ship's limited power supply and time factor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitallard.com/moviereview/155/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/conf/esc/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=215900589&amp;kc=2444&amp;printable=true&amp;printable=true |title=Power engineer: Video interview with Apollo astronaut Ken Mattingly |publisher=Eetimes.com |date=2009-03-17 |accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was further complicated by the fact that the reduced power levels in the LM caused internal temperatures to drop considerably. The un-powered CM got so cold that water began to [[Condensation|condense]] on solid surfaces, causing concern that this might damage electrical systems when it was reactivated. This turned out not to be a problem, partly because of the extensive electrical insulation improvements instituted after the [[Apollo 1]] fire.&lt;ref&gt;ttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/main/A13_panel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-entry and splashdown===
[[File:Apollo 13 crew postmission onboard USS Iwo Jima.jpg|thumb|250px|The crew of Apollo 13 on board the [[USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2)|USS ''Iwo Jima'']] following splashdown]]
As Apollo 13 neared Earth, the crew first jettisoned the Service Module so pictures could be taken for later analysis. It was then that the crew were surprised to see for the first time that the Sector 4 panel had been blown off. According to the analysts, these pictures also showed the antenna damage and possibly an upward tilt to the fuel cell shelf above the oxygen tank compartment.

[[File:Apollo13-load on deck crop1.jpg|thumb|300px|Apollo 13 command module being lifted aboard USS Iwo Jima]]
Finally, the crew jettisoned the Lunar Module ''Aquarius'', leaving the Command Module ''Odyssey'' to begin its lone re-entry through the atmosphere. A normal lunar re-entry was accompanied by four minutes of communications blackout caused by ionization of the air around the Command Module. The possibility of heat shield damage from the O2 tank rupture heightened the tension of the blackout period, which took 33 seconds longer than normal.

However, ''Odyssey'' regained radio contact and splashed down safely in the Pacific, {{Coord|21|38|24|S|165|21|42|W|type:event|name=Apollo 13 splashdown}}, southeast of American Samoa and {{convert|6.5|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from the recovery ship, [[USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2)|USS ''Iwo Jima'']].
The crew was in good condition except for Haise, who was suffering from a serious [[urinary tract infection]] because of insufficient water intake. To avoid altering the trajectory of the spacecraft, the crew had been instructed to temporarily stop urine dumps. A misunderstanding prompted the crew to store all urine for the rest of the flight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.nasa.gov/SP-350/ch-13-5.html Account of Apollo 13 by James Lovell], NASA website&lt;/ref&gt;

Cortright sent the ''Report of the Apollo 13 Review Board'' to Thomas Paine on 15 June 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://drushel.cwru.edu/apollo13/ Report of Apollo 13 Review Board: PDF File (NASA) Restoration] by Dr. Rich Drushel, Case Western Reserve University. 2007-02-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Review board accident analysis==
The oxygen tank failure was caused by an unlikely chain of events, as found by the Apollo 13 Review Board investigation, based on detailed manufacturing records and logs. Tanks storing [[cryogen]]s, such as liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, require either venting, extremely good insulation, or both, in order to avoid excessive pressure buildup due to vaporization. The Service Module oxygen tanks were so well insulated that they could safely contain [[supercritical fluid|supercritical]] hydrogen and oxygen for years. Each oxygen tank held several hundred pounds of oxygen, which was used for breathable air and the production of electricity and water. However, the construction of the tank made internal inspection of the tank impossible.

The tank contained several components relevant to the accident:
* a quantity sensor;
* a fan to stir the tank contents for more accurate quantity measurements;
* a [[heater]] to vaporize liquid oxygen as needed;
* a [[thermostat]] to protect the heater;
* a [[temperature sensor]];
* fill and drain valves and piping.

The heater and protection thermostat were originally designed for the command module's 28-volt DC bus. The specifications for the heater and thermostat were later changed to allow a 65-volt ground supply, in order to pressurize the tanks more rapidly. [[Beechcraft]], the tank subcontractor, did not upgrade the thermostat to handle the higher voltage. The temperature sensor could not read above the highest operational temperature of the heater, which was approximately {{Convert|100|F|C}}. This was not normally a problem because the thermostat was designed to open at {{Convert|80|F|C}}.

The oxygen shelf carrying the oxygen tanks was originally installed in the [[Apollo 10]] service module, but was removed to fix a potential [[electromagnetic interference]] problem. During removal, the shelf was accidentally dropped about {{convert|2|in|cm|0|abbr=off|lk=off}} because a retaining bolt had not been removed. The tank appeared to be undamaged, but a loosely-fitting filling tube was apparently damaged, and photographs suggested that the close-out cap on the top of the tank may have hit the fuel cell shelf. The report of the Apollo 13 review board considers the probability of tank damage during this incident to be &quot;rather low&quot;.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;
After the tank was filled for ground testing, it could not be emptied through the normal drain line. To avoid delaying the mission by replacing the tank, the heater was connected to 65-volt ground power to boil off the oxygen. Lovell signed off on this procedure. It should have taken a few days at the thermostatic opening temperature of {{convert|80|F|C}}. However, when the thermostat opened, the 65-volt supply fused its contacts closed and the heater remained powered.

This raised the temperature of the heater to an estimated {{convert|1000|F|C|-1}}. A chart recorder on the heater current showed that the heater was not cycling on and off, as it should have been if the thermostat was functioning correctly, but no one noticed it at the time. Because the temperature sensor could not read higher than {{convert|100|F|C}}, the monitoring equipment did not register the true temperature inside the tank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/ap13acc.html The Apollo 13 Accident]&lt;/ref&gt;  The gas evaporated in hours rather than days.

The sustained high temperatures melted the [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] insulation on the fan power supply wires and left them exposed. When the tank was refilled with oxygen, it became a bomb waiting to go off. During the &quot;cryo stir&quot; procedure, fan power passed through the bare wires which apparently shorted, producing sparks and igniting the Teflon. This in turn boiled liquid oxygen faster than the tank vent could remove it.

The other oxygen tank or its piping, located near the failed tank, was damaged, allowing it to leak also. Design fixes included moving the tanks farther apart, and removing the stirring fans.  This required adding a third tank, so that no tank would go below half full. An emergency battery was also added to another sector in the service module.

[[File:CryoMalfunctionsProcedures - Apollo13 CortrightReport pg A-162.png|thumb|250px|Established procedure for alleviating high pressure in a cryogenic oxygen tank]]
In June 1970, the [http://history.nasa.gov/ap13rb/ap13index.htm Cortright Report] provided an in-depth analysis of the mission in an extremely detailed five-chapter report with eight appendices. It showed a copy of established NASA procedures for alleviating high pressure in a cryogenic oxygen tank, to include:
*Turning the four tank heaters and fans off,
*Pulling the two heater circuit breakers to open to remove the energy source,
*Performing a 2-minute purge, or directly opening the O2 valve.
[[File:TankRuptureParametersGraph - Apollo13 CortrightReport pg B-47 (pg A-209 inlay).png|thumb|250px|Telemetered parameters of the oxygen tank rupture incident, with inset image of pressure relief valve]]
This procedure was designed to prevent hardware failure so that the lunar landing mission could be continued. However, the [http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a13/A13_MissionOpReport.pdf EECOM Mission Report] (on pg E-10) recounts how the master caution and warning alarm had been turned off for a previous low pressure reading on hydrogen tank 2, and so it did not trigger to call attention to the high oxygen pressure reading.

Oxygen tank 2 was not the only pressure vessel that failed during this mission. Prior to the accident, the crew had moved their scheduled entry into the Lunar Module forward by three hours. This was done so that they could get an earlier look at the pressure reading of the supercritical helium (SHe) tank in the LM descent stage, which had been suspect since before launch. After the abort decision, the helium pressure continued to rise and Mission Control predicted the time that the burst disc would rupture. The helium tank [[burst disc]] ruptured at 108:54, after the lunar flyby. The expulsion reversed the direction of the passive thermal control (PTC) roll (nicknamed the &quot;barbecue roll&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a13/A13_MissionOpReport.pdf LM Control Officer (Control) Apollo 13 Post-Mission Report, page H-9]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the investigation board did recreate the oxygen tank failure, they did not report on any experiments that would show how effective the Cryogenic Malfunctions Procedures were to prevent the system failure by de-energizing the electrical heater and fan circuits.

[[File:Apollo 13 with president Nixon.jpg|thumb|250px|The crew of Apollo 13 with President [[Richard Nixon]] after being awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]]]

Because Apollo 13 followed the [[free return trajectory]], its altitude over the [[Far side (Moon)|lunar far side]] was approximately {{convert|100|km|-1|abbr=on}} greater than the orbital altitude on the remaining Apollo lunar missions. ''[[The Guinness Book of Records]]'' lists this flight as holding the absolute altitude record for a manned spacecraft.

The [[Apollo/Skylab A7L|A7L]] spacesuit intended to be worn on the lunar surface by Lovell would have been the first to feature red bands on the arms, legs, lunar EVA helmet assembly, and the life-support backpack. This came about because Mission Control personnel watching the video feeds of Apollos 11 and 12 had trouble distinguishing the astronauts while both had their helmet sunshades down. The red bands were a feature for the remaining Apollo flights and are used on the [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit]]s worn by the astronauts of the [[Space Shuttle program]] and on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).

The Apollo 13 mission has been called &quot;a successful failure&quot;, because the astronauts were brought home safely notwithstanding the failure of the mission.

The crew and the [[Apollo 13 Mission Operations Team]] were awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] for their actions during the mission.

The Cold Cathode Gauge Experiment (CCGE), which was part of the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package|ALSEP]] on Apollo 13 was never flown again. It was a version of the Cold Cathode Ion Gauge (CCIG) which featured on [[Apollo 12]], [[Apollo 14]], and [[Apollo 15]]. The CCGE was designed as a standalone version of the CCIG. On other missions, the CCIG was connected as part of the Suprathermal Ion Detector (SIDE). Because of the aborted landing, this experiment was never actually deployed. Other experiments included on Apollo 13's ALSEP included the Heat Flow Experiment (HFE), the Passive Seismic Experiment (PSE), and the Charged Particle Lunar Environment Experiment (CPLEE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myspacemuseum.com/alsepu1.htm Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package (ALSEP)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plaque and insignia===
[[File:APOLLO 13 LUNAR PLAQUE replica.jpg|thumb|200px|Replica of the plaque with Swigert's name that was to replace the one attached to ''Aquarius'' that had Mattingly's name]]
The original [[lunar plaque]] on ''Aquarius'' bore Mattingly’s name, so the crew was given a replacement with Swigert’s name on it. ''Aquarius'' never landed on the moon, however, so Lovell kept the plaque. In his book ''[[Lost Moon]]'' (later renamed ''Apollo 13''), Lovell states that apart from the Apollo 13 plaque and a couple of other pieces, the only other memento he possesses is a letter from [[Charles Lindbergh]].

The Apollo 13 crew patch featured three flying horses as Apollo's 'chariot' across space. Given Lovell's Navy background, the logo also included the mottoes “''Ex luna, scientia''” (&quot;From the moon, knowledge&quot;), borrowed from the [[U.S. Naval Academy]]'s motto, &quot;''Ex scientia tridens'',&quot; (&quot;From knowledge, sea power&quot;). The mission number appeared in [[Roman numerals]] as Apollo XIII. It is one of two Apollo insignia—the other being Apollo 11—not to include the names of the crew. (This was fortunate, considering that original crew member Ken Mattingly was replaced two days before the mission began.) It was designed by artist [http://genedorr.com/patches/Artists.html#winter Lumen Winter], who based it on a mural he had done for the St. Regis Hotel in New York. The mural was later purchased by actor [[Tom Hanks]], who portrayed Lovell in the movie ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', and now is on the wall of a restaurant in Chicago owned by Lovell's son.

===&quot;Towing fees&quot;===
[[Grumman]] Aerospace Corporation, the builder of the Lunar Module, issued a tongue-in-cheek invoice for $312,421.24 to [[Rockwell International|North American Rockwell]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071031080918/http://www.geocities.com/capecanaveral/4411/apollo13.htm Invoice from Grumman Aerospace for towing the North American built CM]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1338&amp;dat=19700418&amp;id=Owg0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=O_gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5822,839543 Spokane Daily Chronicle April 18 1970] &quot;Tongue-In-Cheek-Bill Asks Space Tow Fee&quot; from Google News&lt;/ref&gt; the builder of the Command Module (CM), for &quot;towing&quot; the crippled ship most of the way to the moon and back. The invoice included a 20% commercial discount, as well as a further 2% discount if North American were to pay in cash. North American declined payment, noting that they had ferried Grumman LMs to the moon on three previous occasions with no such reciprocal charges. The invoice was drawn up by Grumman pilot Sam Greenberg as a gag following Apollo 13's successful splashdown. He had earlier helped with the strategy for re-routing power from the LM to the crippled CM.

==Spacecraft location==
[[File:Apollo 13 control.jpg|thumb|A view of the controls in the command module on display at the Cosmosphere.]]

The command module shell was formerly at the [[Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace]], in Paris. The interior components were removed during the investigation of the accident and reassembled into BP-1102A, the water egress training module; and were subsequently on display at the [[Louisville Science Center|Museum of Natural History and Science]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], until 2000. The command module and the internal components were reassembled, and ''Odyssey'' is currently on display at the [[Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center]], [[Hutchinson, Kansas]].

The lunar module burned up in Earth's atmosphere on April 17, 1970, having been targeted to enter over the Pacific Ocean to reduce the possibility of contamination from a [[Systems Nuclear Auxiliary Power Program|SNAP 27]] [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] (RTG) on board. (Had the mission proceeded as planned, the RTG would have been used to power the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package]], and then remained on the Moon.) The RTG survived re-entry (as designed) and landed in the [[Tonga Trench]]. While it will remain radioactive for approximately 2,000 years, it does not appear to be releasing any of its 3.9&amp;nbsp;kg of radioactive plutonium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/neep602/SPRING00/lecture39.pdf | title = General Safety Considerations | format = pdf lecture notes | publisher = Fusion Technology Institute, [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] | date = Spring 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A part of the Lunar Module was returned by the astronauts and is on display at the [[Apollo/Saturn V Center]] of the [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]].

Lovell's lunar space suit helmet is located at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in Chicago, Illinois.

The Apollo 13 [[S-IVB]] with its Instrument Unit was guided to [[List of man-made objects on the Moon|crash onto the lunar surface]] on April 14, providing a signal for the [[Apollo 12]] Passive Seismic Experiment.

==Popular culture==
The 1974 movie ''[[Houston, We've Got a Problem]]'', while set around the Apollo 13 incident, is a fictional drama about the crises faced by ground personnel, when the emergency disrupts their work schedules and places additional stress on their lives; only a couple of news clips and a narrator's solemn voice deal with the actual problems.

''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', a film based on ''[[Lost Moon]]'', Jim Lovell's and [[Jeffrey Kluger|Jeffrey Kluger's]] book about the event, was released in 1995. It was directed by [[Ron Howard]] and starred [[Tom Hanks]] as Jim Lovell, [[Bill Paxton]] as Fred Haise, [[Kevin Bacon]] as Jack Swigert, [[Ed Harris]] as [[flight controller|flight director]] [[Gene Kranz]], [[Kathleen Quinlan]] as Marilyn Lovell and [[Gary Sinise]] as Ken Mattingly. Jim Lovell, Gene Kranz, and other principals have stated that this film depicted the events of the mission with reasonable accuracy, though some [[dramatic license]] was taken. Technical inaccuracies have also been noted. 

The film also depicts Lowell [[List of misquotations|misquoting]] Swigert's famous statement, &quot;Houston, we've had a problem&quot; as &quot;Houston, we have a problem&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;air2ground&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the filmmakers purposely changed the line--and the character speaking it--because the original quote made it seem that the problem had already passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112384/trivia |title=IMDb: Apollo 13 trivia |accessdate=May 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a critical and box office success, and was nominated for several Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Harris) and Best Supporting Actress (Quinlan). The film engendered new interest in the history of the Apollo program and American space flight in general.

Portions of the events surrounding the Apollo 13 mission are dramatized in episode &quot;We Interrupt This Program&quot; of the 1998 miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (TV miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'', co-produced by Ron Howard and Tom Hanks. Because their film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' covered the incident from the crew's perspective the story is instead presented from the perspective of earthbound television reporters competing for coverage of the mission.

In 2008, an interactive theatrical show titled ''[[APOLLO 13: Mission Control]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apollo13.co.nz Official page of the APOLLO 13 production]&lt;/ref&gt; premiered at [[BATS Theatre]] in Wellington, New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatreview.org.nz/reviews/production.php?id=916 Theatreview media release and subsequent reviews of the [[BATS Theatre]] production of APOLLO 13: Mission Control]&lt;/ref&gt;  The production faithfully recreated the mission control consoles and audience members became part of the storyline. The show also featured a 'guest' astronaut each night–a member of the public who suited up and amongst other duties, stirred the oxygen tanks and said the line &quot;Houston, we've had a problem&quot;. This 'replacement' astronaut was a nod to Jack Swigert, who replaced Ken Mattingly shortly before the actual launch in 1970. The production toured to other cities extensively in New Zealand and Australia in 2010-2011.  The production travels to the USA in 2012.

'''Apollo 7''' (October 11–22, 1968) was the first manned mission in the [[United States|American]] [[Apollo program|Apollo space program]], and the first manned [[United States|US]] space flight after a cabin fire killed the crew of what was to have been the first manned mission, AS-204 (later renamed [[Apollo 1]]), during a launch pad test in 1967. It was a [[List of Apollo mission types|C type mission]]—an 11-day Earth-orbital mission, the first manned launch of the [[Saturn IB]] launch vehicle, and the first three-person US space mission. The crew was commanded by [[Wally Schirra|Walter M. Schirra]], with Command Module Pilot [[Donn F. Eisele]], and Lunar Module Pilot [[Walter Cunningham|R. Walter Cunningham]].

The mission was the first manned test of the redesigned Block II [[Apollo Command/Service Module]]. It flew in Earth orbit so the crew could check life-support, propulsion, and control systems.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1968/N.-Korea-Seize-U.S.-Ship/12303153093431-9/#title 1968 in Space; 1968 Year in Review], UPI.com&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite tension between the crew and ground controllers, the mission was a technical success, which gave NASA the confidence to launch [[Apollo 8]] around the Moon  two months later. However, the flight would prove to be the last space flight for all of its three crew members. It was also the final manned launch from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], Florida.

==Mission highlights==
Apollo 7 was a test flight, and confidence-builder. After the January 1967 [[Apollo 1|Apollo launch pad fire]], the Apollo Command Module had been extensively redesigned. Schirra, who would be the only astronaut to fly [[Mercury program|Mercury]], [[Gemini program|Gemini]] and Apollo missions, commanded this Earth-orbital shakedown of the Command and Service Modules. Since it was not carrying a [[Lunar Module]] and only needed to reach a [[low earth orbit]], Apollo 7 could be launched with the [[Saturn IB]] booster rather than the much larger and more powerful [[Saturn V]]. Schirra wanted to name the Apollo 7 Command module &quot;Phoenix&quot; (the mythical bird rising from its own ashes) in memory of the late Apollo 1 crew, but NASA management rejected the idea.

[[Image:AS-205 crew.jpg|thumb|275px|A rare 1966 photo of Eisele, Schirra and Cunningham wearing the A1C spacesuits used in the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Development history|Block I]] Apollo spacecraft. (They were originally scheduled for a second Block I flight, then became the backup crew for the ill-fated [[Apollo 1]] mission.)]]

Throughout the Mercury and Gemini programs, [[McDonnell Aircraft]] engineer [[Guenter Wendt]] had been leader of the spacecraft launch pad teams, with ultimate responsibility for condition of the spacecraft at launch. He had come to be respected and admired by all the astronauts, including Schirra. But since the Apollo contractor had been changed from McDonnell to [[North American Rockwell]], Wendt had not been pad leader for Apollo 1.

So adamant was Schirra in his desire to have Wendt back as Pad Leader for his Apollo flight, that he got his boss [[Deke Slayton]] to persuade North American management to hire Wendt away from McDonnell, and Schirra personally lobbied North American's launch operations manager to change Wendt's shift from midnight to day so he could be pad leader for Apollo 7. So Wendt remained as Pad Leader for the entire Apollo program.&lt;ref&gt;

Wendt's face was the last they saw before the hatch was sealed, and immediately after liftoff Eisele said with a mock German accent into his radio, &quot;I vonder vere Guenter Vendt?&quot;

The Apollo hardware and all mission operations worked without any significant problems, and the Service Propulsion System (SPS), the all-important engine that would place Apollo into and out of lunar orbit, made eight nearly perfect firings.

Even though Apollo's larger cabin was more comfortable than Gemini's, 11 days in orbit took its toll on the astronauts. Tension with Schirra began with the launch decision, when flight managers decided to launch with a less than ideal abort option for the early part of the ascent. Once in orbit, the spacious cabin may have induced some crew [[motion sickness]], which had not been an issue in the earlier, smaller spacecraft. The crew was also unhappy with their food selections. But the worst problem occurred when Schirra developed a severe head cold. As a result, he became irritable with requests from Mission Control and all three astronauts began &quot;talking back&quot; to the [[capsule communicator|Capcom]]. An early example was this exchange after Mission Control requested that a TV camera be turned on in the spacecraft:
[[Image:Walter Schirra on Apollo 7.jpg|thumb|[[Walter Schirra]] looks out the rendezvous window in front of the commander's station on the ninth day of the mission.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
SCHIRRA: You've added two burns to this flight schedule, and you've added a urine water dump; and we have a new vehicle up here, and I can tell you at this point TV will be delayed without any further discussion until after the rendezvous.&lt;br /&gt;
CAPCOM ([[Jack Swigert]]): Roger. Copy.&lt;br /&gt;
SCHIRRA: Roger.&lt;br /&gt;
CAPCOM 1 ([[Deke Slayton]]): Apollo 7, this is CAPCOM number 1.&lt;br /&gt;
SCHIRRA: Roger.&lt;br /&gt;
CAPCOM 1: All we've agreed to do on this is flip it. &lt;br /&gt;
SCHIRRA: ... with two commanders, Apollo 7&lt;br /&gt;
CAPCOM 1: All we have agreed to on this particular pass is to flip the switch on. No other activity is associated with TV; I think we are still obligated to do that.&lt;br /&gt;
SCHIRRA: We do not have the equipment out; we have not had an opportunity to follow setting; we have not eaten at this point. At this point, I have a cold. I refuse to foul up our time lines this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/AS07_TEC.PDF|title=Apollo 7 Air-to-Ground Voice Transcriptions|pages=117–118|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|accessdate=2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further source of tension between Mission Control and the crew was that Schirra repeatedly expressed the view that the reentry should be conducted with their helmets off, contrary to previous [[Project Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] experience. They perceived a risk that their eardrums might burst due to the sinus pressure from their colds, and they wanted to be able to pinch their noses and blow to equalize the pressure as it increased during reentry. This would have been impossible wearing the helmets, as the new Apollo helmets were a continuous &quot;fishbowl&quot; type without a moveable visor, unlike previous helmets. However, on repeat occasions over the course of the mission, Schirra was instructed that the helmets should be worn for safety reasons. In the final exchange on the subject, Mission Control made it clear to Schirra that he would be expected to account for flouting instructions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
CAPCOM Number 1 ([[Deke Slayton]]): Okay. I think you ought to clearly understand there is absolutely no experience at all with landing without the helmet on. &lt;br /&gt;
SCHIRRA: And there no experience with the helmet either on that one. &lt;br /&gt;
CAPCOM: That one we've got a lot of experience with, yes. &lt;br /&gt;
SCHIRRA: If we had an open visor, I might go along with that. &lt;br /&gt;
CAPCOM: Okay. I guess you better be prepared to discuss in some detail when we land why we haven't got them on. I think you're too late now to do much about it. &lt;br /&gt;
SCHIRRA: That's affirmative. I don't think anybody down there has worn the helmets as much as we have. &lt;br /&gt;
CAPCOM: Yes. &lt;br /&gt;
SCHIRRA: We tried them on this morning. &lt;br /&gt;
CAPCOM: Understand that. The only thing we're concerned about is the landing. We couldn't care less
about the reentry. But it's your neck, and I hope you don't break it. &lt;br /&gt;
SCHIRRA: Thanks, babe. &lt;br /&gt;
CAPCOM: Over and out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/AS07_TEC.PDF|title=Apollo 7 Air-to-Ground Voice Transcriptions|pages=1170|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|accessdate=2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Exchanges such as this led to all three Apollo 7 crew members being rejected for future missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wade|first=Mark|url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/apollo7.htm|title=Apollo 7|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these difficulties, the mission successfully met its objective of verifying manned flight capability of the Apollo Command and Service Modules, allowing the flight of [[Apollo 8]] to the Moon just two months later.

Beyond a shakedown of the spacecraft, goals for the mission included the first [[Apollo TV camera|live television]] broadcast from an American spacecraft ([[Gordon Cooper]] had broadcast [[Slow-scan television|slow scan television]] pictures from [[Mercury 9|Faith 7]] in 1963) and testing the mock LM docking maneuver which involved [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with the launch vehicle's discarded upper stage (referred to by Schirra in the above conversation.)

The splashdown point was 27 deg 32 min N, 64 deg 04 min W, {{convert|200|nmi|km}} SSW of Bermuda and {{convert|7|nmi|km|abbr=on|lk=off}} north of the recovery ship [[USS Essex (CV-9)|USS Essex]].

Apollo 7 was the only manned Apollo launch to take place from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Launch Complex 34]], as all subsequent Apollo and Skylab missions (including Apollo-Soyuz) were launched from [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39]] at the nearby [[Kennedy Space Center]].

As of 2011, Cunningham is the only surviving member of the crew. Eisele died in 1987 and Schirra in 2007.

==Belated recognition==
In October 2008, NASA administrator [[Michael D. Griffin]] awarded the crew of Apollo 7 [[NASA Distinguished Service Medal|NASA's Distinguished Service Medal]], in recognition of their crucial contribution to the Apollo program. They had been the only Apollo and [[Skylab]] crew not granted this award. Cunningham was present to accept the medal, as were representatives of his deceased crew members, and other Apollo astronauts including [[Neil Armstrong]], [[Bill Anders]], and [[Alan Bean]]. Former Mission Control Flight Director [[Chris Kraft]], who was in conflict with the crew during the mission, also sent a conciliatory video message of congratulations, saying: &quot;We gave you a hard time once but you certainly survived that and have done extremely well since...I am frankly, very proud to call you a friend.&quot;

==Mission insignia==
The insignia for the flight showed a Command and Service module with its SPS engine firing, the trail from that fire encircling a globe and extending past the edges of the patch symbolizing the Earth-orbital nature of the mission. The Roman numeral VII appears in the South [[Pacific Ocean]] and the crew's names appear on a wide black arc at the bottom. The patch was designed by Allen Stevens of Rockwell International.&lt;ref&gt;Hengeveld, Ed. The Apollo Emblems of Artist Al Stevens. Spaceflight magazine, June 2008, pp. 220-225.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spacecraft location==
[[File:Appolo7-07a.jpg|thumb|200px|The Apollo 7 CM as exhibited at The Frontiers of Flight Museum]]
In January 1969, the Apollo 7 Command Module was displayed on a NASA float in the inauguration parade of President [[Richard M. Nixon]]. For nearly 30 years the Command Module was on loan (renewable every two years) to the [[Canada Science and Technology Museum|National Museum of Science and Technology]], in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], along with the space suit worn by [[Wally Schirra]]. In November 2003 the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. requested them back for display at their new annex at the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]]. Currently, the Apollo 7 CM is on loan to the [[Frontiers of Flight Museum]] located next to [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field]] in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]].

==Depiction in entertainment==
Portions of the Apollo 7 mission are dramatized in the miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' episode entitled [[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)#Episodes|&quot;We Have Cleared the Tower&quot;]].

'''Apollo 9''', the third manned mission in the [[United States|American]] [[Apollo program|Apollo space program]], was the first flight of the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] (CSM) with the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM). Its three-person crew, consisting of Commander [[Jim McDivitt]], Command Module Pilot [[David Scott]], and Lunar Module Pilot [[Rusty Schweickart]], tested several aspects critical to landing on the Moon, including the LM engines, backpack life support systems, navigation systems, and docking maneuvers. The mission was the second manned launch of a [[Saturn V]] [[rocket]].

After launching on March 3, 1969, the crewmen spent ten days in low Earth orbit. They performed the first manned flight of a LM, the first docking and extraction of a LM, two spacewalks, and the first docking of two manned spacecraft. The mission proved the LM worthy of manned spaceflight. Further tests on the [[Apollo 10]] mission would prepare the LM for its ultimate goal, landing on the Moon.

Originally [[Clifton Williams]] was the lunar module pilot for the backup crew. He died on October 5, 1967, in a [[T-38 Talon|T-38]] crash. His spot was given to Alan Bean. Later, when the backup crew flew [[Apollo 12]], a fourth star was added to their mission patch in remembrance of him.

==Original mission profile==
In April 1966, McDivitt, Scott, and Schweickart were selected as the backup crew to [[Gus Grissom]], [[Edward Higgins White|Ed White]], and [[Roger Chaffee]] for the planned first manned Earth orbital test flight of the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] (CSM), designated [[Apollo 1|'''AS-204''']] expected to fly in late 1966. This was to be followed by a second similar flight, '''AS-205''', to be crewed by [[Wally Schirra]], [[Walter Cunningham]], and [[Donn Eisele]].

However, delays in the CSM development pushed AS-204 into 1967. By December 1966, the original AS-205 mission was cancelled, Schirra's crew was named as Grissom's backup, and McDivitt's crew was promoted to prime crew for a new second mission, to fly the complete Apollo spacecraft, launching the CSM and [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) on two separate [[Saturn IB]] vehicles into a low Earth orbit. They immediately began training for this flight, designated '''AS-205/208''', expected to occur in late 1967.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web

  | work =
  | publisher = Project Apollo Archive
  | url = http://www.apolloarchive.com/apollo_gallery.html
  | accessdate = August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, 1967, Grissom's crew were conducting a launch-pad test for their planned February 21 mission, which they named [[Apollo 1]], when a fire broke out in the cabin, killing all three men and putting an 18-month hold on the manned program while the Command Module was redesigned for safety.

As it turned out, a 1967 launch of AS-205/208 would have been impossible even absent the Apollo 1 accident, as problems with the LM delayed its first unmanned test flight until January 1968. NASA was able to use the 18-month hiatus to catch up with development and unmanned testing of the LM and the [[Saturn V]] Moon launch vehicle.

By October 1967, planning for manned flights resumed, with [[Apollo 7]] being the first Earth orbit CSM flight (now known as the '''C mission''') in October 1968 given to Schirra's crew, and McDivitt's mission (now known as the '''D Mission''') following as Apollo 8 in December 1968, using a single Saturn V instead of the two Saturn IBs. This would be followed by a higher Earth orbit flight ('''E Mission'''), to be crewed by [[Frank Borman]], [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], and [[William Anders]] in early 1969.

However, continued LM production problems meant that the D Mission would not be able to fly until the spring of 1969, so NASA officials created another mission for [[Apollo 8]] using the Saturn V to launch only the CSM on the first manned flight to orbit the Moon, and the E Mission was cancelled as unnecessary. Since McDivitt's crew had trained for the first LM mission, and he expressed the personal desire to fly it, the Borman and McDivitt crews were swapped, and the D mission became Apollo 9.

The crew swap also affected who would be the first crew to land on the Moon; when the crews for Apollo 8 and 9 were swapped, their backup crews were also swapped. Since the rule of thumb was for backup crews to fly as prime crew three missions later, this put [[Neil Armstrong|Neil Armstrong's]] crew (Borman's backup) in position for the first landing mission [[Apollo 11]] instead of [[Pete Conrad|Pete Conrad's]] crew, who made the second landing on [[Apollo 12]].

==Mission highlights==
[[File:Apollo-9-Lancering.jpg|thumb|left|Apollo 9 launches from [[Kennedy Space Center]], March 3, 1969.]]

Apollo 9 was the first space test of the complete Apollo spacecraft, including the third critical piece of Apollo hardware besides the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] (CSM) and the Saturn V launch vehicle—the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM). It was also the first [[space rendezvous|space docking]] of two vehicles with an internal crew transfer between them. For ten days, the astronauts put both Apollo spacecraft through their paces in Earth orbit, including an undocking and redocking of the lunar lander with the command vehicle, just as the landing mission crew would perform in lunar orbit. Apollo 9 gave proof that the Apollo spacecraft were up to this critical task, on which the lives of lunar landing crews would depend.

For this and all subsequent Apollo flights, the crews were allowed to name their own spacecraft (the last spacecraft to have been named was [[Gemini 3]]). The gangly LM was named ''Spider'', and the CSM was labeled ''Gumdrop'' because of the Command Module's shape, and also the blue wrapping in which the craft arrived at Kennedy Space Center. These names were required as radio call signs when the vehicles flew independently.

Schweickart and Scott performed a spacewalk (EVA)—Schweickart checked out the new Apollo spacesuit, the first to have its own life support system rather than being dependent on an umbilical connection to the spacecraft, while Scott filmed him from the command module hatch. Schweickart was due to carry out a more extensive set of activities to test the suit, and demonstrate that it was possible for astronauts to perform an EVA from the lunar module to the command module in an emergency, but as he had been suffering from [[space sickness]] the extra tests were scratched.

[[File:Apollo 9 approaches splashdown.jpg|thumb|right|Apollo 9 approaches [[splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashdown]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], March 13, 1969.]]

McDivitt and Schweickart later test-flew the LM, and practiced separation and docking maneuvers in Earth orbit. They flew the LM up to {{convert|111|mi|km}} from ''Gumdrop'', using the engine on the descent stage to propel them originally, before jettisoning it and using the ascent stage to return. This test flight represented the first flight of a manned spacecraft that was not equipped to reenter the Earth's atmosphere.

The splashdown point was 23 deg 15 min N, 67 deg 56 min W, 180&amp;nbsp;miles (290&amp;nbsp;km) east of Bahamas and within sight of the recovery ship [[USS Guadalcanal (LPH-7)|USS ''Guadalcanal'']].

The command module was displayed at the Michigan Space and Science Center, [[Jackson, Michigan]] until April 2004 when the center closed. In May 2004, it was moved to the [[San Diego Aerospace Museum]]. The LM ascent stage orbit decayed on October 23, 1981, the LM descent stage (1969-018D) orbit decayed March 22, 1969. The [[S-IVB]] stage [[J-2 (rocket engine)|J-2]] engine was restarted after Lunar Module extraction and propelled the stage into solar orbit by burning to depletion.

The crew sang the song &quot;[[Happy Birthday to You]]&quot; on March 8, 1969.

==Mission insignia and spacecraft names==
[[Image:Apollo-9-patch.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Souvenir patch]]
The circular patch shows a drawing of a Saturn V rocket with the letters USA on it. To its right, an Apollo CSM is shown next to an LM, with the CSM's nose pointed at the &quot;front door&quot; of the LM rather than at its top docking port. The CSM is trailing rocket fire in a circle. The crew's names are along the top edge of the circle, with APOLLO [[Roman numerals|IX]] at the bottom. The &quot;D&quot; in McDivitt's name is filled with red to mark that this was the &quot;D mission&quot; in the alphabetic sequence of pre-lunar landing missions. The patch was designed by Allen Stevens of Rockwell International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ed |last=Hengeveld |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-052008a.html |title=The man behind the Moon mission patches |publisher=collectSPACE |date=May 20, 2008 |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time since the first manned Gemini mission, the astronauts were allowed to name their spacecraft. This came about to avoid confusion when dealing with two separate craft flying at the same time. The crew dubbed the lunar module ''Spider'' for its buglike appearance, and the command module ''Gumdrop'' because of its shape.

'''Arthritis''' (from Greek ''arthro-'', joint + ''-itis'', inflammation; plural: arthritides) is a form of [[arthropathy|joint disorder]] that involves [[inflammation]] of one or more joints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/arthritis thefreedictionary.com &gt; arthritis] in turn citing:
*The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright 2000
*Collins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged, HarperCollins Publishers 2003
*The American Heritage Science Dictionary Copyright 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

There are over 100 different forms of arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthline.com/adamcontent/arthritis Healthline]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/guide/arthritis-basics Web MD]&lt;/ref&gt; The most common form, [[osteoarthritis]] (degenerative joint disease) is a result of trauma to the joint, infection of the joint, or age. Other arthritis forms are [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], and related [[autoimmune disorder|autoimmune diseases]]. [[Septic arthritis]] is caused by joint [[infection]].

The major complaint by individuals who have arthritis is [[joint pain]]. Pain is often a constant and may be localized to the joint affected.
The pain from arthritis occurs due to [[inflammation]] that occurs around the joint, damage to the joint from disease, daily wear and tear of joint, muscle [[strain (injury)|strains]] caused by forceful movements against stiff, painful joints and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].

==Classification==

{{anchor|undifferentiated}}
An ''undifferentiated arthritis'' is an arthritis that does not fit into well-known clinical disease categories, possibly being an early stage of a definite rheumatic disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|9725091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differential diagnosis==
===Osteoarthritis===
[[Osteoarthritis]] is the most common form of arthritis.&lt;ref name=Van2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=VanItallie TB |title=Gout: epitome of painful arthritis |journal=Metab. Clin. Exp. |volume=59 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S32–6 |year=2010 |month=October |pmid=20837191 |doi=10.1016/j.metabol.2010.07.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can affect both the larger and the smaller joints of the body, including the hands, feet, back, hip or knee. The disease is essentially one acquired from daily wear and tear of the joint, however, osteoarthritis can also occur as a result of injury. Osteoarthritis begins in the cartilage and eventually leads to the two opposing bones eroding into each other. Initially, the condition starts with minor pain while walking but soon the pain can be continuous and even occur at night. The pain can be debilitating and prevent one from doing some activities. Osteoarthritis typically affects the weight bearing joints such as the back, spine, and pelvis. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis is most commonly a disease of the elderly. More than 30 percent of females have some degree of osteoarthritis by age 65. Risk factors for osteoarthritis include: prior joint trauma, obesity, sedentary lifestyle.

Osteoarthritis, like rheumatoid arthritis, cannot be cured but one can prevent the condition from worsening. Weight loss is the key to improving symptoms and preventing progression.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} Physical therapy to strengthen muscles and joints is very helpful. Pain medications are widely required by individuals with osteoarthritis. When the disease is far advanced and the pain is continuous, surgery may be an option. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, joint replacement does help many individuals with osteoarthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Witter J, Dionne RA |title=What can chronic arthritis pain teach about developing new analgesic drugs? |journal=Arthritis Res. Ther. |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=279–81 |year=2004 |pmid=15535840 |pmc=1064875 |doi=10.1186/ar1450 |url=http://arthritis-research.com/content/6/6/279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rheumatoid arthritis===
[[Rheumatoid arthritis]] is a disorder in which, for some unknown reason, the body's own immune system starts to attack body [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. The attack is not only directed at the joint but to many other parts of the body. In rheumatoid arthritis, most damage occurs to the joint lining and [[cartilage]] which eventually results in erosion of two opposing bones. Rheumatoid arthritis affects joints in the fingers, wrists, knees and elbows. The disease is [[Symmetry|symmetrical]] and can lead to severe [[deformity]] in a few years if not treated. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs mostly in people aged 20 and above. In children, the disorder can present with a skin rash, fever, pain, disability, and limitations in daily activities. No one knows why rheumatoid arthritis occurs and all treatments are focused on easing the symptoms. With earlier diagnosis and aggressive treatment, many individuals can lead a decent quality of life. The drugs to treat rheumatoid arthritis range from [[corticosteroid]]s to [[monoclonal antibodies]] given [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]]. The latest drugs like [[infliximab|Remicade]] can significantly improve quality of life in the short term. In rare cases, surgery may be required to replace joints but there is no cure for the illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aihw.gov.au/cdarf/diseases_pages/index.cfm Chronic Diseases] Australian Institute Of Health And Welfare. Retrieved on 2010-01-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lupus===
This is a common [[collagen]] [[vascular]] disorder that can be present with severe arthritis. Other features of [[lupus erythematosus|lupus]] include a skin rash, extreme [[photosensitivity]], [[baldness|hair loss]], [[kidney]] problems, emotional [[lability]], lung fibrosis and constant joint pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|331715|Rheumatoid Arthritis: Differential Diagnoses &amp; Workup|diagnosis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gout===
[[Gout]] is caused by deposition of [[uric acid]] crystals in the joint, causing inflammation. There is also an uncommon form of gouty arthritis caused by the formation of rhomboid crystals of calcium pyrophosphate known as [[Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease|pseudogout]]. In the early stages, the gouty arthritis usually occur in one joint, but with time, it can occur in many joints and be quite crippling. The joints in gout can often become swollen and lose function.&lt;ref&gt;[http://severearthritis.net/ Severe Arthritis Disease Facts] Retrieved on 2010-02-05&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
[[Infectious arthritis]] is another severe form of arthritis. It presents with sudden onset of chills, fever and joint pain. The condition is caused by bacteria elsewhere in the body. Infectious arthritis must be rapidly diagnosed and treated promptly to prevent irreversible and permanent joint damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthritis.org/ Severe Arthritis Disease Facts] Retrieved on 2010-02-05&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psoriasis]] is another type of arthritis. With psoriasis, most individuals develop the skin problem first and then the arthritis. The typical features are of continuous joint pains, stiffness and swelling. The disease does recur with periods of [[remission (medicine)|remission]] but there is no cure for the disorder. A small percentage develop a severe painful and destructive form of arthritis which destroys the small joints in the hands and can lead to permanent disability and loss of hand function. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/psoriatic-arthritis/DS00476/DSECTION=symptoms Psoriatic Arthritis] Mayo Clinic.

Regardless of the type of arthritis, the common symptoms for all arthritis disorders include varied levels of pain, [[swelling (medical)|swelling]], [[joint stiffness]] and sometimes a constant ache around the joint(s). Arthritic disorders like lupus and rheumatoid can also affect other organs in the body with a variety of symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/AAG/arthritis.htm Arthritis: The Nation’s Most Common Cause of Disability] Centers for disease prevention and health promotion.

It is common in advanced arthritis for significant secondary changes to occur. For example, in someone who has limited their physical activity:
* Muscle [[weakness]]
* Loss of [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]]
* Decreased [[aerobic exercise|aerobic fitness]]
These changes can also impact on life and social roles, such as community involvement.

===Disability===
Arthritis is the most common cause of [[disability]] in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;^ Arthritis: The Nation’s Most Common Cause of Disability Centers for disease prevention and health promotion. Retrieved on 2010-01-24 &lt;/ref&gt; More than 20 million individuals with arthritis have severe limitations in function on a daily basis. [[Absenteeism]] and frequent visits to the [[physician]] are common in individuals who have arthritis. Arthritis makes it very difficult for individuals to be physically active and soon become home bound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronicarthritis.net/ Chronic Arthritis treatment, symptoms and relief] Retrieved on 2010-01-24&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that the total cost of arthritis cases is close to $100 billion of which nearly 50% accounts from lost earnings. Each year, arthritis results in nearly 1 million hospitalizations and close to 45 million outpatient visits to [[health care]] centers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthritis.ca/types%20of%20arthritis/default.asp?s=1&amp;province=bc Types of Arthritis] The Arthritis Society. Retrieved on 2010-02-05&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthritis makes it very difficult for the individual to remain physically active. Many individuals who have arthritis also suffer from obesity, high [[cholesterol]] or have [[heart disease]]. Individuals with arthritis also become [[depression (mood)|depressed]] and have fear of worsening symptoms.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is made by clinical examination from an appropriate health professional, and may be supported by other tests such as radiology and blood tests, depending on the type of suspected arthritis. All arthritides potentially feature [[pain]]. Pain patterns may differ depending on the arthritides and the location. [[Rheumatoid arthritis]] is generally worse in the morning and associated with stiffness; in the early stages, patients often have no symptoms after a morning shower. [[Osteoarthritis]], on the other hand, tends to be worse after exercise. In the aged and children, pain might not be the main presenting feature; the aged patient simply moves less, the infantile patient refuses to use the affected limb.

Elements of the history of the disorder guide diagnosis. Important features are speed and time of onset, pattern of joint involvement, symmetry of symptoms, early morning stiffness, tenderness, gelling or locking with inactivity, aggravating and relieving factors, and other systemic symptoms. Physical examination may confirm the diagnosis, or may indicate systemic disease. Radiographs are often used to follow progression or help assess severity.

==Prevention==
{{Expand section|date=May 2011}}

==Treatment==
There is no cure for either rheumatoid or osteoarthritis. Treatment options vary depending on the type of arthritis and include [[physical therapy]], lifestyle changes (including exercise and weight control), [[Brace (orthopaedic)|orthopedic bracing]], medications. [[Joint replacement surgery]] may be required in eroding forms of arthritis. Medications can help reduce inflammation in the joint which decreases pain. Moreover, by decreasing inflammation, the joint damage may be slowed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treatarthritis.net/ How to treat arthritis] Retrieved on 2010-02-01&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical Therapy===
In general, studies have shown that physical exercise of the affected joint can have noticeable improvement in terms of long-term pain relief. Furthermore, exercise of the arthritic joint is encouraged to maintain the health of the particular joint and the overall body of the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|8980206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with arthritis can benefit from both physical and [[occupational therapy]]. In arthritis the joints become stiff and the range of movement can be limited. Physical therapy has been shown to significantly improve function, decrease pain, and delay need for surgical intervention in advanced cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fransen M, Crosbie J, Edmonds J |title=Physical therapy is effective for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee: a randomized controlled clinical trial |journal=J. Rheumatol. |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=156–64 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11196518 |url=http://www.jrheum.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11196518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise prescribed by a physical therapist has been shown to be more effective than medications in treating osteoarthritis of the knee. Exercise often focusses on improving muscle strength, endurance and flexibility. In some cases, exercises may be designed to train balance. Occupational therapy can teach you how to reduce stress on your joint from daily living activities. Occupation therapy can also teach you how to modify your home and work environment so that you do reduce movements that may worsen your arthritis. There are also assist devices available that can help you drive, getting a bath, dressing and also in housekeeping labors.

Occupational therapy can help you do everyday activities without worsening pain or causing joint damage. The techniques can help you distribute pressures to minimize stress on any one joint. Ways to accomplish daily living tasks are made easier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/ Arthritis Disability Information] Centers for disease control and prevention portal. Retrieved on 2010-02-01&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medications===
Treatment typically begins with medications that have the fewest side effects with further medications being added if insufficiently effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.arthritistoday.org/treatments/drug-guide/index.php|title=Arthritis Drugs|work=arthritistoday.org|accessdate=July 5, 2010|unused_data= Arthritis Prescription Medication|Arthritis Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment depends on the type of the arthritis. The first-line treatment for [[osteoarthritis]] is [[acetaminophen]] while for [[inflammatory arthritis]] it involves [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] like ibuprofen.

==Epidemiology==
Arthritis is predominantly a disease of the elderly, but children can also be affected by the disease. More than 70% of individuals in North America affected by arthritis are over the age of 65. Arthritis is more common in women than men at all ages and affects all races, [[ethnic group]]s and cultures. In the United States a CDC survey based on data from 2007-2009 showed 22.2% (49.9 million) of adults aged ≥18 years had self-reported doctor-diagnosed arthritis, and 9.4% (21.1 million or 42.4% of those with arthritis) had [[arthritis-attributable activity limitation]] (AAAL). With an aging population this number is expected to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Walsh  |title=One in Five Adults Has Arthritis |date=7 October 2010 |publisher=MedPage Today |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/Rheumatology/Arthritis/22612?}}&lt;br/&gt;based on {{cite journal |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) |title=Prevalence of doctor-diagnosed arthritis and arthritis-attributable activity limitation — United States, 2007–2009 |journal=MMWR Morb.

==History==
While evidence of primary ankle (kaki) osteoarthritis has been discovered in dinosaurs, the first known traces of human arthritis date back as far as [[4500 BC]]. In early reports, arthritis was frequently referred to as the most common ailment of prehistoric peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bridges &quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Bridges PS | title=Prehistoric Arthritis in the Americas | journal=Annual Review of Anthropology | year=1992| volume=21 |pages=67–91 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.an.21.100192.000435 | doi=10.1146/annurev.an.21.100192.000435}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted in skeletal remains of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] found in [[Tennessee]] and parts of what is now Olathe, [[Kansas]]. Evidence of arthritis has been found throughout history, from [[Ötzi the Iceman|Ötzi]], a [[mummy]] (circa 3000 BC) found along the border of modern [[Italy]] and [[Austria]], to the Egyptian mummies circa 2590 BC &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news-medical.net/health/Arthritis-History.aspx Arthritis History] Medical News&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1715 [[William Musgrave]] published the second edition of his most important medical work ''De arthritide symptomatica'' which concerned arthritis and its effects.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Alick Cameron, &quot;Musgrave, William (1655–1721)&quot;, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blood test]]s and [[X-ray]]s of the affected joints often are performed to make the diagnosis. Screening blood tests are indicated if certain arthritides are suspected. These might include: [[rheumatoid factor]], [[antinuclear factor]] (ANF), [[extractable nuclear antigen]], and specific antibodies.

'''Acetylene''' (systematic name: '''ethyne''') is the [[chemical compound]] with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is a [[hydrocarbon]] and the simplest [[alkyne]]. This colorless gas is widely used as a fuel and a chemical building block.  It is unstable in pure form and thus is usually handled as a solution.

As an alkyne, acetylene is [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] because its two carbon atoms are [[Chemical bond|bonded]] together in a [[triple bond]].  The carbon-carbon triple bond places all four atoms in the same straight line, with CCH bond angles of 180°. Since acetylene is a linear symmetrical molecule, it possesses the D&lt;sub&gt;∞h&lt;/sub&gt; [[point group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft3rd|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by [[Edmund Davy]] who identified it as a &quot;new carburet of hydrogen&quot;. It was rediscovered in 1860 by French chemist [[Marcellin Berthelot]], who coined the name &quot;acetylene&quot;. Berthelot was able to prepare this gas by passing vapours of organic compounds (methanol, ethanol, etc.) through a red-hot tube and collecting the [[effluent]].  He also found acetylene was formed by sparking electricity through mixed [[cyanogen]] and [[hydrogen]] gases. Berthelot later obtained acetylene directly by passing hydrogen between the poles of a [[arc lamp|carbon arc]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://chestofbooks.com/crafts/metal/Welding-Cutting/Acetylene.html Acetylene]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
Today acetylene is mainly manufactured by the partial [[combustion]] of [[methane]] or appears as a side product in the [[ethylene]] stream from [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] of [[hydrocarbon]]s.  Approximately 400,000 tonnes are produced this way annually.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Pässler, Werner Hefner, Klaus Buckl, Helmut Meinass, Andreas Meiswinkel, Hans-Jürgen Wernicke, Günter Ebersberg, Richard Müller, Jürgen Bässler, Hartmut Behringer, Dieter Mayer “Acetylene” in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2008, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a01_097.pub3}}. Article Online Posting Date: 15 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Its presence in ethylene is usually undesirable because of its explosive character and its ability to poison [[Ziegler-Natta catalyst]]s. It is selectively hydrogenated into [[ethylene]], usually using Pd-Ag catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/acetylene Acetylene: How Products are Made]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1950s, when oil supplanted coal as the chief source of carbon, acetylene (and the aromatic fraction from [[coal tar]]) was the main source of organic chemicals in the chemical industry. It was prepared by the [[hydrolysis]] of [[calcium carbide]], a reaction discovered by [[Friedrich Wöhler]] in 1862 and still familiar to students:
: CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Calcium carbide production requires extremely high temperatures, ~2000&amp;nbsp;°C, necessitating the use of an [[electric arc furnace]]. In the US, this process was an important part of the late-19th century revolution in chemistry enabled by the massive [[hydroelectric power]] project at [[Niagara Falls]].

==Bonding==
{{Main|Chemical bond}}
In terms of [[valence bond theory]], in each carbon atom the 2s [[Atomic orbital|orbital]] [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridizes]] with one 2p orbital thus forming an sp hybrid. The other two 2p orbitals remain unhybridized. The two ends of the two sp hybrid [[orbital overlap]] to form a strong [[Sigma bond|σ valence bond]] between the carbons, while on each of the other two ends hydrogen atoms attach also by σ bonds. The two unchanged 2p orbitals form a pair of weaker [[pi bond|π valence bonds]].&lt;ref&gt;Organic Chemistry 7th ed. by J. McMurry, Thomson 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
{{Main|Alkyne}}
One new application is the conversion of acetylene to ethylene for use in making a variety of [[polyethylene]] plastics.  An important reaction of acetylene is its combustion, the basis of the acetylene welding technologies.  Otherwise, its major applications involve its conversion to acrylic acid derivatives. 

Compared to most [[hydrocarbon]]s, acetylene is relatively acidic, though it is still much less acidic than water or [[ethanol]].  Thus it reacts with strong bases to form [[acetylide]] salts.  For example, acetylene reacts with [[sodium amide]] in liquid [[ammonia]] to form sodium acetylide, and with [[butyllithium]] in cold [[tetrahydrofuran|THF]] to give lithium acetylide.&lt;ref name=Midland1990&gt;{{OrgSynth

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:left;&quot;&gt;
[[Acetylide]]s of [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s are easily formed by reaction of acetylene with the metal ions.  Several, e.g., [[silver acetylide]] and [[copper acetylide]], are powerful and very dangerous explosives. Copper acetylide is also formed by reacting acetylene with metallic copper or its alloys; these materials are therefore unsuitable for installations for handling acetylene.

===Reppe chemistry===
[[Walter Reppe]] discovered that in the presence of metal [[catalyst]]s, acetylene can react to give a wide range of industrially significant chemicals.

* With [[alcohol]]s, [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[hydrogen chloride]], or [[carboxylic acid]]s to give [[vinyl]] compounds:

:[[Image:Reppe-chemistry-cyclooctatetraene.png|240px]]

===Welding===
Approximately 20 percent of acetylene is consumed for [[oxyacetylene]] [[gas welding]] and [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|cutting]] due to the high temperature of the flame; combustion of acetylene with oxygen produces a flame of over 3600&amp;nbsp;K (3300&amp;nbsp;°C, 6000&amp;nbsp;°F), releasing 11.8&amp;nbsp;[[Kilojoule|kJ]]/g. Oxyacetylene is the hottest burning common fuel gas.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOC&quot;&gt;[http://www.boc.com/products_and_services/by_product/acetylene/index.asp Acetylene], BOC&lt;/ref&gt;  Acetylene is the third hottest natural chemical flame after [[cyanogen]] at 4798&amp;nbsp;K (4525&amp;nbsp;°C, 8180&amp;nbsp;°F) and [[dicyanoacetylene]]'s 5260&amp;nbsp;K (4990&amp;nbsp;°C, 9010&amp;nbsp;°F). [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|Oxy-acetylene welding]] was a very popular welding process in previous decades; however, the development and advantages of [[arc welding|arc-based welding processes]] have made oxy-fuel welding nearly extinct for many applications. Acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly.  On the other hand, oxy-acetylene welding ''equipment'' is quite versatile – not only because the torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding (as in certain artistic applications), but also because it lends itself easily to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and other applications.  [[Bell Canada]] cable repair technicians still use portable acetylene fueled torch kits as a [[soldering]] tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in [[manholes]] and in some aerial locations.  Oxyacetylene welding may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible.  As well, oxy-fuel cutting is still very popular and oxy-acetylene cutting is utilized in nearly every metal fabrication shop. For use in welding and cutting, the working pressures must be controlled by a regulator, since above 15 psi&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c-f-c.com/specgas_products/acetylene.htm&lt;/ref&gt; acetylene will decompose explosively.

===Niche and historically interesting applications===
In 1881, the Russian chemist Mikhail Kucherov&lt;ref&gt;Kutscheroff, M. &quot;Ueber eine neue Methode direkter Addition von Wasser (Hydratation) an die Kohlenwasserstoffe der Acetylenreihe&quot; Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft '''1881''', Volume 14, 1540–1542. {{DOI|10.1002/cber.188101401320}}&lt;/ref&gt; described the [[Hydration reaction|hydration]] of acetylene to [[acetaldehyde]] using catalysts such as [[mercury(II) bromide]]. Before the advent of the [[Wacker process]], this reaction was conducted on an industrial scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Hydration of Acetylene: A 125th Anniversary | author = Dmitry A. Ponomarev and Sergey M. Shevchenko | journal = [[J. Chem. Ed.]] | volume = 84 | issue = 10 | year = 2007 | pages = 1725 | url = http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/HS/Journal/Issues/2007/OctACS/ACSSub/p1725.pdf | doi = 10.1021/ed084p1725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[polymerization]] of acetylene with [[Ziegler-Natta catalyst]]s produces [[polyacetylene]] films. Polyacetylene, a chain of CH centres with alternating single and double bonds, was the one of first discovered [[organic semiconductor]]s.  Its reaction with [[iodine]] produces a highly electrically conducting material.  Although such materials are not useful, these discoveries led to the developments of [[organic semiconductor]]s, as recognized by the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2000 to [[Alan J. Heeger]], [[Alan G MacDiarmid]], and [[Hideki Shirakawa]].

In the early 20th Century acetylene was widely used for illumination, including street lighting in some towns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=0AnJU-hralEC The 100 most important chemical compounds: a reference guide]&lt;/ref&gt; Most early automobiles used [[carbide lamp]]s before the adoption of electric headlights.

Acetylene is sometimes used for [[carburization]] (that is, hardening) of [[steel]] when the object is too large to fit into a furnace.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOC&quot; /&gt;

Acetylene is used to volatilize carbon in [[radiocarbon dating]]. The carbonaceous material in an archeological sample is reacted with [[lithium]] metal in a small specialized research furnace to form [[lithium carbide]] (also known as lithium acetylide). The carbide can then be reacted with water, as usual, to form acetylene gas to be fed into [[mass spectrometer]] to sort out the isotopic ratio of carbon 14 to carbon 12.

==Natural occurrence==
Acetylene is a moderately common chemical in the universe, often associated with the atmospheres of [[gas giant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher = [[W. M. Keck Observatory]] | title = Precursor to Proteins and DNA found in Stellar Disk | date = 20 December 2005 | url = http://www.keckobservatory.org/article.php?id=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; One curious discovery of acetylene is on [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of [[Saturn]]. Natural acetylene is believed to form from either [[catalytic]] decomposition of long chain hydrocarbons at temperatures of 1,770&amp;nbsp;K and above. Since such temperatures are highly unlikely on such a small distant body, this discovery is potentially suggestive of catalytic reactions within that moon, making it a promising site to search for prebiotic chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[The Planetary Society]] | author = Emily Lakdawalla | title = LPSC: Wednesday afternoon: Cassini at Enceladus | date = 17 March 2006 | url =

==Safety and handling==
Acetylene is not especially toxic but when generated from calcium carbide it can contain toxic impurities such as traces of [[phosphine]] and [[arsine]]. It is also highly flammable (hence its use in welding). Its singular hazard is associated with its intrinsic instability, especially when it is pressurized. Samples of concentrated or pure acetylene can easily react in an addition-type reaction to form a number of products, typically benzene and/or [[vinylacetylene]]. This reaction is exothermic. Consequently, acetylene can explode with extreme violence if the pressure of the gas exceeds about 200&amp;nbsp;kPa (29&amp;nbsp;psi) as a gas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when in liquid or solid form.  It is therefore shipped and stored dissolved in [[acetone]] or [[dimethylformamide]] (DMF), contained in a metal cylinder with a porous filling ([[Agamassan]]), which renders it safe to transport and use, given proper handling.

{{Democracy}}
'''Athenian democracy'''  developed in the  [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city-state]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]], comprising the central city-state of Athens and the surrounding territory of [[Attica]], around 508 BC. Athens was one of the first known democracies. Other Greek cities set up democracies, and even though most followed an Athenian model, none were as powerful, stable, or as well-documented as that of Athens. It remains a unique and intriguing experiment in [[direct democracy]] where the people do not elect representatives to vote on their behalf but vote on legislation and executive bills in their own right. Participation was by no means open, but the in-group of participants was constituted with no reference to economic class and they participated on a scale that was truly phenomenal. The [[public opinion]] of voters was remarkably influenced by the [[political satire]] performed by the [[Ancient Greek comedy|comic poets]] at the [[Ancient Greek theatre|theatres]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J. (1993) ''Comic Hero versus Political Elite'' pp.307-19 in {{cite book |editor=Sommerstein, A.H.; S. Halliwell, J. Henderson, B. Zimmerman |title=Tragedy, Comedy and the Polis |year=1993 |publisher=Levante Editori |location=Bari}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solon]] (594 BC), [[Cleisthenes]] (508/7 BC), and [[Ephialtes]] (462 BC) all contributed to the development of Athenian democracy. Historians differ on which of them was responsible for which institution, and which of them most represented a truly democratic movement. It is most usual to date Athenian democracy from Cleisthenes, since Solon's constitution fell and was replaced by the tyranny of [[Peisistratos|Peisistratus]], whereas Ephialtes revised Cleisthenes' constitution relatively peacefully. [[Hipparchus (son of Peisistratos)|Hipparchus]], brother of the tyrant [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]], was killed by [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton]], who were subsequently honored by the Athenians for their alleged restoration of Athenian freedom.

The greatest and longest lasting democratic leader was [[Pericles]]; after his death, Athenian democracy was twice briefly interrupted by oligarchic revolution towards the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]]. It was modified somewhat after it was restored under [[Eucleides]]; the most detailed accounts are of this fourth-century modification rather than the Periclean system. It was suppressed by the [[Macedon]]ians in 322 BC. The Athenian institutions were later revived, but the extent to which they were a real democracy is debatable.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;democracy&quot; (Greek: δημοκρατια) combines the elements ''dêmos'' (''δῆμος'', which means &quot;people&quot;) and ''krátos'' (''κράτος'', which means &quot;force&quot; or &quot;power&quot;). In the words &quot;monarchy&quot; and &quot;oligarchy&quot;, the second element ''arche'' (''ἀρχή'') means &quot;rule&quot;, &quot;leading&quot; or &quot;being first&quot;. It is unlikely that the term &quot;democracy&quot; was coined by its detractors who rejected the possibility of a valid &quot;demarchy&quot;, as the word &quot;demarchy&quot; already existed and had the meaning of [[mayor]] or [[municipal]]. One could assume the new term was coined and adopted by Athenian democrats. 

The word is attested in [[Herodotus]], who wrote some of the first surviving Greek prose, but this may not have been before 440 or 430 BC. We are not certain that the word &quot;democracy&quot; was extant when systems that came to be called democratic were first instituted, but around 460 BC &lt;ref&gt;Raaflaub, Kurt A. (2007): ''The Breakthrough of Demokratia in Mid-Fifth-Century Athens'', p. 112, in: {{cite book |editor=Raaflaub, Kurt A.; Ober, Josiah; Wallace, Robert |title=Origins of Democracy in Ancient Greece |year=2007 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; an individual is known whose parents had decided to name him 'Democrates', a name which may have been manufactured as a gesture of democratic loyalty; the name can also be found in [[Aeolis|Aeolian]] [[Temnus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''Anabasis'' 4.4.15&lt;/ref&gt; not a particularly democratic state.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==Participation and exclusion==
===Size and make-up of the Athenian population===
Estimates of the population of ancient Athens vary. During the 4th century BC, there may well have been some 250,000–300,000 people in Attica. Citizen families may have amounted to 100,000 people and out of these some 30,000 will have been the adult male citizens entitled to vote in the assembly. In the mid-5th century the number of adult male citizens was perhaps as high as 60,000, but this number fell precipitously during the Peloponnesian War. This slump was permanent due to the introduction of a stricter definition of citizen described below. From a modern perspective these figures may seem small, but in the world of Greek city-states Athens was huge: most of the thousand or so Greek cities could only muster 1000–1500 adult male citizens and Corinth, a major power, had at most 15,000 but in some very seldom cases more. 

The non-citizen component of the population was divided between resident foreigners ([[metic]]s) and slaves, with the latter perhaps somewhat more numerous. Around 338 BC the orator [[Hyperides]] (fragment 13) claimed that there were 150,000 slaves in Attica, but this figure is probably not more than an impression: slaves outnumbered those of citizen stock but did not swamp them.

===Citizenship in Athens===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[State]] --&gt;
Only adult male Athenian citizens who had completed their military training as [[Ephebos|ephebe]]s had the right to vote in Athens. This excluded a majority of the population, namely [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slaves]], freed slaves, children, women and [[metic]]s. Also disallowed were citizens whose rights were under suspension (typically for failure to pay a debt to the city: see [[Atimia (loss of citizen rights)|atimia]]); for some Athenians this amounted to permanent (and in fact inheritable) disqualification. Still, in contrast with oligarchical societies, there were no real property requirements limiting access. (The property classes of [[Solon]]'s constitution remained on the books, but they were obsolete). Given the exclusionary and ancestral conception of citizenship held by Greek [[city-states]], a relatively large portion of the population took part in the government of Athens and of other radical democracies like it. At Athens some citizens were far more active than others, but the vast numbers required just for the system to work testify to a breadth of participation among those eligible that greatly exceeded any present day democracy{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}.
Athenian citizens had to be descended from citizens&amp;mdash;after the reforms of Pericles and Cimon in 450 BC on both sides of the family, excluding the children of Athenian men and foreign women. Although the legislation was not retrospective, five years later the Athenians removed 5000 from the citizen registers when a free gift of grain arrived for all citizens from an Egyptian king. Citizenship could be granted by the assembly and was sometimes given to large groups (Plateans in 427 BC, Samians in 405 BC) but, by the 4th century, only to individuals and by a special vote with a quorum of 6000. This was generally done as a reward for some service to the state. In the course of a century, the numbers involved were in the hundreds rather than thousands.

==Main bodies of governance==
[[File:Constitution-of-the-Athenians-in-the-4th-century-BC.png|thumb|right|350px|Constitution of the Athenians, 4th century BC]]There were three political bodies where citizens gathered in numbers running into the hundreds or thousands. These are the assembly (in some cases with a quorum of 6000), the council of 500 (''[[Boule (ancient Greece)|boule]]'') and the courts (a minimum of 200 people, but running at least on some occasions up to 6000). Of these three bodies it is the assembly and the courts that were the true sites of power — although courts, unlike the assembly, were never simply called the ''demos'' (the People) as they were manned by a subset of the citizen body, those over thirty. But crucially citizens voting in both were not subject to review and prosecution as were council members and all other officeholders. In the 5th century BC we often hear of the assembly sitting as a court of judgment itself for trials of political importance and it is not a coincidence that 6000 is the number both for the full quorum for the assembly and for the annual pool from which jurors were picked for particular trials. By the mid-4th century however the assembly's judicial functions were largely curtailed, though it always kept a role in the initiation of various kinds of political trial.

===Assembly===
The central events of the Athenian democracy were the meetings of the [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|assembly]] ({{polytonic|ἐκκλησία}} ''ekklesia''). Unlike a [[parliament]], the assembly's members were not elected, but attended by right when they chose. Greek democracy created at Athens was a [[direct democracy|direct]], not a [[representative democracy]]: any adult male citizen [[Age of majority|of age]] could take part, and it was a duty to do so. The officials of the democracy were in part elected by the Assembly and in large part chosen by lot. 

The assembly had four main functions; it made executive pronouncements (decrees, such as deciding to go to war or granting citizenship to a foreigner); it elected some officials; it legislated; and it tried political crimes. As the system evolved these last two functions were shifted to the law courts. The standard format was that of speakers making speeches for and against a position followed by a general vote (usually by show of hands) of yes or no. Though there might be blocs of opinion, sometimes enduring, on crucial issues, there were no political parties and likewise no [[government]] or [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] (as in the [[Westminster system]]). Voting was by simple [[majority rule|majority]]. In the 5th century at least there were scarcely any limits on the power exercised by the assembly. If the assembly broke the law, the only thing that might happen is that it would punish those who had made the proposal that it had agreed to. If a mistake had been made, from the assembly's viewpoint it could only be because it had been misled.

As usual in ancient democracies, one had to physically attend a gathering in order to vote. Military service or simple distance prevented the exercise of citizenship. Voting was usually by show of hands (cheirŏtonĭa, &quot;arm stretching&quot;) with officials judging the outcome by sight. With thousands of people attending, counting was impossible. For a small category of votes a quorum of 6000 was required, principally grants of citizenship, and here small coloured stones were used, white for yes and black for no. At the end of the session, each voter tossed one of these into a large clay jar which was afterwards cracked open for the counting of the ballots. [[Ostracism]] required the voters to scratch names onto pieces of broken pottery [Ostraka], though this did not occur within the assembly as such.

In the 5th century BC, there were 10 fixed assembly meetings per year, one in each of the ten [[Attic calendar#State calendar|state months]], with other meetings called as needed. In the following century the meetings were set to forty a year, with four in each state month. One of these was now called the main meeting, ''kyria ekklesia''. Additional meetings might still be called, especially as up until 355 BC there were still political trials that were conducted in the assembly rather than in court. The assembly meetings did not occur at fixed intervals, as they had to avoid clashing with the annual festivals that followed the lunar calendar. There was also a tendency for the four meetings to be aggregated toward the end of each state month.
[[File:Pnyx-berg2.png|thumb|right|The [[Pnyx]] with the speaker's platform, the meeting place of the people of Athens]]
Attendance at the assembly was not always voluntary. In the 5th century public slaves forming a cordon with a red-stained rope herded citizens from the [[agora]] into the assembly meeting place (''[[pnyx]]''), with a fine for those who got the red on their clothes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristophanes]] ''Acharnians'' 17–22.&lt;/ref&gt; After the restoration of the democracy in 403 BC, pay for assembly attendance was introduced for the first time. This promoted a new enthusiasm for assembly meetings. Only the first 6000 to arrive were admitted and paid, with the red rope now used to keep latecomers at bay.&lt;ref&gt;Aristoph. ''Ekklesiazousai'' 378-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Council===

The presidency of the boule rotated monthly amongst the ten [[prytanies]], or delegations from the ten [[Cleisthenes|Cleisthenic]] tribes, of the Boule (there were ten months in the [[Hellenic calendar]]). The ''epitastes'', an official selected by lot for a single day from among the currently presiding prytany, chaired that day's meeting of the boule and, if there was one, that day's meeting of the assembly;&lt;ref name = &quot;wtijsx&quot;&gt;Hignett, ''History of the Athenian Constitution'', 237&lt;/ref&gt; he also held the keys to the treasury and the seal to the city, and welcomed foreign ambassadors. It has been calculated that one quarter of all citizens must at one time in their lives have held the post, which could be held only once in a lifetime.

The boule also served as an executive committee for the assembly, and oversaw the activities of certain other magistrates. The boule coordinated the activities of the various boards and magistrates that carried out the administrative functions of Athens and provided from its own membership randomly selected boards of ten responsible for areas ranging from naval affairs to religious observances.&lt;ref&gt;Hignett, ''History of the Athenian Constitution'', 238&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, the boule was responsible for a great portion of the administration of the state, but was granted relatively little latitude for initiative; the boule's control over policy was executed in its probouleutic, rather than its executive function; in the former, it prepared measures for deliberation by the assembly, in the latter, it merely executed the wishes of the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Hignett, ''History of the Athenian Constitution'', 241&lt;/ref&gt;

===Courts===
Athens had an elaborate legal system centered on full citizen rights (see [[atimia (loss of citizen rights)|atimia]]). The age limit, the same as that for office holders but ten years older than that required for participation in the assembly, gave the courts a certain standing in relation to the assembly; for the Athenians of the court were not only older, but were wiser, too. Jurors were required to be under oath, which was not required for attendance at the assembly. The authority exercised by the courts had the same basis as that of the assembly: both were regarded as expressing the direct will of the people. Unlike office holders (magistrates) who could be impeached and prosecuted for misconduct, the jurors could not be censured, for they, in effect, were the people and no authority could be higher than that. A corollary of this was that, at least in words spoken by the jurors, if a court had made an unjust decision, it must have been because it had been misled by a litigant.

Essentially there were two grades of suit, a smaller kind known as ''dike'' or private suit, and a larger kind known as ''graphe'' or public suit. For private suits the minimum jury size was 201 (increased to 401 if a sum of over 1000 drachmas was at issue), for public suits 501. The juries were selected by lot from a panel of 600 jurors, there being 600 jurors from each of the ten tribes of Athens, making a jury pool of 6000 in total. For particularly important public suits the jury could be increased by adding in extra allotments of 500. 1000 and 1500 are regularly encountered as jury sizes and on at least one occasion, the first time a new kind of case was brought to court (see [[graphe paranomon]]), all 6,000 members of the jury pool were put onto the one case.

The cases were put by the litigants themselves in the form of an exchange of single speeches timed by water clock, first prosecutor then defendant. In a public suit the litigants each had three hours to speak, much less in private suits (though here it was in proportion to the amount of money at stake). Decisions were made by voting without any time set aside for deliberation. Jurors did talk informally amongst themselves during the voting procedure and juries could be rowdy, shouting out their disapproval or disbelief of things said by the litigants. This may have had some role in building a consensus. The jury could only cast a 'yes' or 'no' vote as to the guilt and sentence of the defendant. For private suits only the victims or their families could prosecute, while for public suits anyone (''ho boulomenos'', 'whoever wants to' i.e. any citizen with full citizen rights) could bring a case since the issues in these major suits were regarded as affecting the community as a whole.

Justice was rapid: a case could last not longer than one day. Some convictions triggered an automatic penalty, but where this was not the case the two litigants each proposed a penalty for the convicted defendant and the jury chose between them in a further vote. No appeal was possible. There was however a mechanism for prosecuting the witnesses of a successful prosecutor, which it appears could lead to the undoing of the earlier verdict.

Payment for jurors was introduced around 462 BC and is ascribed to [[Pericles]], a feature described by Aristotle as fundamental to radical democracy (''Politics'' 1294a37). Pay was raised from 2 to 3 [[obol]]s by [[Cleon]] early in the Peloponnesian war and there it stayed; the original amount is not known. Notably, this was introduced more than fifty years before payment for attendance at assembly meetings. Running the courts was one of the major expenses of the Athenian state and there were moments of financial crisis in the 4th century when the courts, at least for private suits, had to be suspended.

The system showed a marked anti-professionalism. No judges presided over the courts nor did anyone give legal direction to the jurors; magistrates had only an administrative function and were laymen. Most of the annual magistracies at Athens could only be held once in a lifetime. There were no lawyers as such; litigants acted solely in their capacity as citizens. Whatever professionalism there was tended to disguise itself; it was possible to pay for the services of a speechwriter (''logographos'') but this was not advertised in court (except as something your opponent had to resort to), and even politically prominent litigants made some show of disowning special expertise.

These juries formed a second mode for the expression of popular sovereignty; as in the assembly, citizens acting as jurors acted as the people and were immune from review or punishment.

===Shifting balance between Assembly and Courts===
As the system evolved, the courts (that is, citizens under another guise) intruded upon the power of the assembly. From 355 BC political trials were no longer held in the assembly, but only in a court. In 416 BC the [[graphe paranomon]] (&quot;indictment against measures contrary to the laws&quot;) was introduced. Under this anything passed by the assembly or even proposed but not yet voted on, could be put on hold for review before a jury — which might annul it and perhaps punish the proposer as well. Remarkably, it seems that a measure blocked before the assembly voted on it did not need to go back to the assembly if it survived the court challenge: the court was enough to validate it. Once again it is important to bear in mind the lack of 'neutral' state intervention. To give a schematic scenario by way of illustration: two men have clashed in the assembly about a proposal put by one of them; it passed, and now the two of them go to court with the loser in the assembly prosecuting both the law and its proposer. The quantity of these suits was enormous: in effect the courts became a kind of upper house.

In the 5th century there was in effect no procedural difference between an executive decree and a law: they were both simply passed by the assembly. But from 403 BC they were set sharply apart. Henceforth laws were made not in the assembly, but by special panels of 1000 citizens drawn from the annual jury pool of 6000. They were known as the ''nomothetai'', the lawmakers.{{Dubious|date=February 2009}}Nomothetai are junior archons, not the jury. Here again it is not anything like a legislative commission sitting down to discuss the pros and cons and drafting proposals, but the format is that of a trial, voting yes or no after a clash of speeches and such.

===Citizen-initiator===
The institutions sketched above — assembly, officeholders, council, courts — are incomplete without the figure that drove the whole system, ''Ho boulomenos'', he who wishes, or anyone who wishes. This expression encapsulated the right of citizens to take the initiative: to stand to speak in the assembly, to initiate a public  law suit (that is, one held to affect the political community as a whole), to propose a law before the lawmakers or to approach the council with suggestions. Unlike officeholders, the citizen initiator was not vetted before taking up office or automatically reviewed after stepping down — it had after all no set tenure and might be an action lasting only a moment. But any stepping forward into the democratic limelight was risky and if someone chose (another citizen initiator) they could be called to account for their actions and punished.

The degree of participation among citizens varied greatly, along a spectrum from doing virtually nothing towards something like a fulltime committent. But for even the most active citizen the formal basis of his political activity was the invitation issued to everyone (every qualified free male Athenian citizen) by the phrase &quot;whoever wishes&quot;. There are then three functions: the officeholders organized and saw to the complex protocols; ''Ho boulomenos'' was the initiator and the proposer of content; and finally the people, massed in assembly or court or convened as lawmakers, made the decisions, either yes or no, or choosing between alternatives[citation needed].

===Officeholders===
The administration was in the hands of officeholders, for over a thousand years. They were mostly chosen by [[sortition|lot]], with a much smaller (and more prestigious) group [[election|elected]]. Neither was compulsory; individuals had to nominate themselves for both selection methods. By and large the power exercised by these officials was routine administration and quite limited. In particular, those chosen by lot were citizens acting without particular expertise. This was almost inevitable since, with the notable exception of the generals ([[strategoi]]), each office could be held by the same person only once. Part of the ethos of democracy, however, was the building of general competence by ongoing involvement. In the 5th century version of the democracy, the ten annually elected generals were often very prominent, but for those who had power, it lay primarily in their frequent speeches and in the respect accorded them in the assembly, rather than their vested powers. While citizens voting in the assembly ''were'' the people and so were free of review or punishment, those same citizens when holding an office ''served'' the people and could be punished very severely. All of them were subject to a review beforehand that might disqualify them for office and an examination after stepping down. Officeholders were the agents of the people, not their representatives.

Citizens active as office holders served in a quite different capacity from when they voted in the assembly or served as jurors. The assembly and the courts were regarded as the instantiation of the people of Athens: they were the people, no power was above them and they could not be reviewed, impeached or punished. However, when an Athenian took up an office, he was regarded as 'serving' the people. As such, he could be regarded as failing in his duty and be punished for it. There were two methods of selecting people as officeholders, lottery or election. Something like 1100 citizens (including the members of the council of 500) held office each year and about a 100 of these were elected.

===Selection by lot (Allotment)===
Selection by lottery was the standard means as it was regarded as the more democratic: elections would favour those who were rich, noble, eloquent and well-known, while [[sortition|allotment]] spread the work of administration throughout the whole citizen body, engaging them in the crucial democratic experience of, to use Aristotle's words, &quot;ruling and being ruled in turn&quot; (Politics 1317b28–30). The allotment of an individual was based on citizenship rather than merit or any form of personal popularity which could be bought. Allotment therefore was seen as a means to prevent the corrupt purchase of votes and it gave citizens a unique form of political equality as all had an equal chance of obtaining government office.

The random assignment of responsibility to individuals who may or may not be competent has obvious risks, but the system included features meant to obviate possible problems. Athenians selected for office served as teams (boards, panels). In a group someone will know the right way to do things and those that do not may learn from those that do. During the period of holding a particular office everyone on the team is observing everybody else. There were however officials such as the nine archons, who while seemingly a board carried out very different functions from each other.

There were in fact some limitations on who could hold office. Age restrictions were in place with thirty (and in some cases forty) years as a minimum, rendering something like a third of the adult citizen body ineligible at any one time. An unknown proportion of citizens were also subject to disenfranchisement ([[Atimia (loss of citizen rights)|atimia]]), excluding some of them permanently and others temporarily (depending on the type). Furthermore, all citizens selected were reviewed before taking up office (''dokimasia'') at which they might be disqualified. Competence does not seem to have been the main issue, but rather, at least in the 4th century BC, whether they were loyal democrats or had oligarchic tendencies. After leaving office they were subject to a scrutiny (''euthunai'', literally 'straightenings') to review their performance. Both of these processes were in most cases brief and formulaic, but they opened up in the possibility, if some citizen wanted to take some matter up, of a contest before a jury court. In the case of a scrutiny going to trial, there was the risk for the former officeholder of suffering severe penalties. Finally, even during his period of office, any officeholder could be impeached and removed from office by the assembly. In each of the ten &quot;main meetings&quot; (''kuriai ekklesiai'') a year, the question was explicitly raised in the assembly agenda: were the office holders carrying out their duties correctly?

No office appointed by lot could be held twice by the same individual. The only exception was the boule or council of 500. In this case, simply by demographic necessity, an individual could serve twice in a lifetime. This principle extended down to the secretaries and undersecretaries who served as assistants to magistrates such as the archons. To the Athenians it seems what had to be guarded against was not incompetence but any tendency to use office as a way of accumulating ongoing power.

The powers of officials were precisely defined and their capacity for initiative limited. They administered rather than governed. When it came to penal sanctions, no officeholder could impose a fine over fifty drachmas. Anything higher had to go before a court.

===Elected===
Approximately one hundred officials out of a thousand were elected rather than chosen by lot. There were two main categories in this group: those required to handle large sums of money, and the 10 generals, the ''[[strategoi]]''. One reason that financial officials were elected was that any money [[embezzled]] could be recovered from their estates; election in general strongly favoured the rich, but in this case wealth was virtually a prerequisite. 

Generals were elected not only because their role required expert knowledge but also because they needed to be people with experience and contacts in the wider Greek world where wars were fought. In the 5th century BC, principally as seen through the figure of [[Pericles]], the generals could be among the most powerful people in the polis. Yet in the case of Pericles, it is wrong to see his power as coming from his long series of annual generalships (each year along with nine others). His office holding was rather an expression and a result of the influence he wielded. That influence was based on his relation with the assembly, a relation that in the first instance lay simply in the right of any citizen to stand and speak before the people. Under the 4th century version of democracy the roles of general and of key political speaker in the assembly tended to be filled by different persons. In part this was a consequence of the increasingly specialised forms of warfare practiced in the later period.

Elected officials too were subject to review before holding office and scrutiny after office. And they too could be removed from office any time the assembly met. In one case from the 5th century BC the 10 treasurers of the [[Delian]] league (the ''[[Hellenotamiai]]'') were accused at their scrutinies of misappropriation of funds. Put on trial, they were condemned and executed one by one until before the trial of the tenth and last an error of accounting was discovered, allowing him to go free. ([[Antiphon]] 5.69–70) There was also a death penalty for &quot;inadequate performance&quot; while in office.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyandpolicy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-43.html|title=Ostracism: selection and de-selection in ancient Greece|last=Cartledge|first=Paul|date=July 2006|work=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|language=[[English language|English]]|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=[[United Kingdom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individualism in Athenian democracy==
Another interesting insight into Athenian democracy comes from the law that excluded from decisions of war those citizens who had property close to the city walls - on the basis that they had a personal interest in the outcome of such debates because the practice of an invading army was at the time to destroy the land outside the walls.

A good example of the contempt the first democrats felt for those who did not participate in politics can be found in the modern word 'idiot', which finds its origins in the ancient Greek word {{polytonic|ἰδιώτης}} (idiōtēs), meaning a private person, a person who is not actively interested in politics; such characters were talked about with contempt and the word eventually acquired its modern meaning. In his Funeral Oration, Pericles states:&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is only we who regard the one, not participating in these duties, not as unambitious but as useless.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism of the democracy==
Athenian democracy had many critics, both ancient and modern. Modern critics are more likely to find fault with the narrow definition of the citizen body, but in the ancient world the complaint if anything went in the opposite direction. Ancient authors were almost invariably from an elite background for whom giving poor and uneducated people power over their betters seemed a reversal of the proper, rational order of society. For them the ''demos'' in democracy meant not the whole people, but the people as opposed to the elite. Instead of seeing it as a fair system under which 'everyone' has equal rights, they saw it as the numerically preponderant poor tyrannizing over the rich. They viewed society like a modern stock company: democracy is like a company where all shareholders have an equal say regardless of the scale of their holding; one share or ten thousand, it makes no difference. They regarded this as manifestly unjust. In Aristotle this is categorized as the difference between 'arithmetic' and 'geometric' (i.e. proportional) equality. Democracy was far from being the normal style of governance and the beliefs on which it was based were in effect a minority opinion. Those writing in later centuries generally had no direct experience of democracy themselves.

To its ancient detractors the democracy was reckless and arbitrary. They had some signal instances to point to, especially from the long years of the [[Peloponnesian War]].
*The ten treasurers of the [[Delian league]] (''Hellenotamiai'') had been accused of embezzlement. They were tried and executed one after the other until, when only one was still alive, the accounting error was discovered and that last surviving treasurer was acquitted. This was perfectly legal in this case, but an example of the extreme severity with which the people could punish those who served them. ([[Antiphon]] 5.69–70)
*In 406 BC, after years of defeats in the wake of the annihilation of their vast invasion force in Sicily, the Athenians at last won a naval victory at [[Battle of Arginusae|Arginusae]] over the Spartans. After the battle a storm arose and the [[strategos|generals]] in command failed to collect survivors: the Athenians tried and sentenced six of the eight generals to death. Technically, it was illegal, as the generals were tried and sentenced together, rather than one by one as Athenian law required. [[Socrates]] happened to be the citizen presiding over the assembly that day and refused to cooperate (though to little effect) and stood against the idea that it was outrageous for the people to be unable to do whatever they wanted. Later they repented the executions, but made up for it by executing those who had accused the generals before them. (A long account in [[Xenophon]] ''Hellenica'' 1.7.1–35)
*In 399 BC [[Socrates]]  was put on trial and executed for 'corrupting the young and believing in strange gods'. His death gave Europe its first ever intellectual hero and martyr, but guaranteed the democracy an eternity of bad press at the hands of his disciple and enemy to democracy [[Plato]]. In the [[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]] written years later Plato has [[Socrates]] contemplating the possibility of himself on trial before the Athenians: he says he would be like a doctor prosecuted by a pastry chef before a jury of children.

Two coups briefly interrupted democratic rule during the Peloponnesian war, both named by the numbers in control: the [[The Four Hundred (oligarchy)|Four Hundred]] in 411 BC and the [[Thirty Tyrants|Thirty]] in 404 BC. The focus on number speaks to the drive behind each of them: to reduce the size of the electorate by linking the franchise with property qualifications. Though both ended up as rogue governments and did not follow through on their constitutional promises, they began as responses from the Athenian elite to what they saw as the inherent arbitrariness of government by the masses (Plato in the ''Seventh Epistle'' does remark that the Thirty made the preceding democratic regime look like a Golden Age).

Whether the democratic failures should be seen as systematic, or as a product of the extreme conditions of the Peloponnesian war, there does seem to have been a move toward correction. A new version of democracy was established from 403 BC, but it can be linked with both earlier and subsequent reforms ([[graphe paranomon]] 416 BC; end of assembly trials 355 BC). For the first time a conceptual and procedural distinction was made between laws and decrees. Increasingly, responsibility was shifted from the assembly to the courts, with laws being made by jurors and all assembly decisions becoming reviewable by courts. That is to say, the mass meeting of all citizens lost some ground to gatherings of a thousand or so which were under oath, and with more time to focus on just one matter (though never more than a day). One downside was that the new democracy was less capable of rapid response.

Another tack of criticism is to notice the disquieting links between democracy and a number of less than appealing features of Athenian life. Although democracy predated Athenian imperialism by over thirty years, they are sometimes associated with each other. For much of the 5th century at least democracy fed off an empire of subject states. [[Thucydides (politician)|Thucydides]] the son of Milesias (not the historian), an aristocrat, stood in opposition to these policies, for which he was ostracised in 443 BC. At times the imperialist democracy acted with extreme brutality, as in the decision to execute the entire male population of [[Melos]] and sell off its woman and children simply for refusing to became subjects of Athens. The common people were numerically dominant in the navy, which they used to pursue their own interests in the form of work as rowers and in the hundreds of overseas administrative positions. Further they used the income from empire to fund payment for officeholding. This is the position set out by the anti-democratic pamphlet known whose anonymous author is often called the [[Old Oligarch]]. On the other hand the empire was, more or less, defunct in the 4th century BC so it cannot be said that it was democracy was not viable without it. Only then in fact was payment for assembly attendance, the central event of democracy (Similarly for the period before the Persian wars, but for the very early democracy the sources are very meagre and it can be thought of as being in an embryonic state).

A case can be made that discriminatory lines came to be drawn more sharply under Athenian democracy than before or elsewhere, in particular in relation to woman and slaves, as well as in the line between citizens and non-citizens. By so strongly validating one role, that of the male citizen, it has been argued that democracy compromised the status of those who did not share it.
*Male citizenship had become a newly valuable, indeed profitable, possession, to be jealously guarded. Under [[Pericles]], in 450 BC, restrictions were tightened so that a citizen had to be born from citizen parentage on both sides. ''Metroxenoi'', those with foreign mothers, were now to be excluded. Traditionally, for the poorer citizens, local marriage was the norm while the elite had been much more likely to marry abroad as a part of aristocratic alliance building. A habit of one group in society was thus codified as a law for the whole citizen body, which thus lost one axis of openness. Many Athenians prominent earlier in the century would have lost citizenship, had this law applied to them: [[Cleisthenes]], the founder of democracy, had a non-Athenian mother, and the mothers of [[Cimon]] and [[Themistocles]] were not Greek at all, but [[Thrace|Thracian]]. As Athens attracted an increasing number of resident aliens (''[[metic]]s''), this shift in the definition of citizen worked to keep the immigrant population more sharply distinguished politically.
*Likewise the status of women seems lower in Athens than in many Greek cities. At Sparta women competed in public exercise — so in [[Aristophanes]]' ''Lysistrata'' the Athenian women admire the tanned, muscular bodies of their Spartan counterparts — and women could own property in their own right, as they could not at Athens. [[Misogyny]] was by no means an Athenian invention, but it has been claimed that in regard to gender democracy generalised a harsher set of values derived, again, from the common people. Democracy may well have been impossible without the contribution of women's labour (Hansen 1987: 318).
*[[Slavery in antiquity|Slavery]] was more widespread at Athens than in other Greek cities. Indeed the extensive use of imported non-Greeks (&quot;[[barbarian]]s&quot;) as [[chattel slavery|chattel slaves]] seems to have been an Athenian development. This triggers the parodoxical question: Was democracy &quot;based on&quot; slavery? It does seem clear that possession of slaves allowed even poorer Athenians — owning a few slaves was by no means equated with wealth — to devote more of their time to political life. But whether democracy depended on this extra time is impossible to say. The breadth of slave ownership also meant that the leisure of the rich (the small minority who were actually free of the need to work) rested less than it would have on the exploitation of their less well-off fellow citizens. Working for wages was clearly regarded as subjection to the will of another, but at least debt servitude had been abolished at Athens (under the reforms of Solon at the start of the 6th century BC). By allowing a new kind of equality among citizens this opened the way to democracy, which in turn called for a new means, chattel slavery, to at least partially equalise the availability of leisure between rich and poor. In the absence of reliable statistics all these connections remain speculative. However, as [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] pointed out, other societies also kept slaves but did not develop democracy. Even with respect to slavery the new citizen law of 450 BC may have had effect: it is speculated that originally Athenian fathers had been able to register for citizenship offspring had with slave women (Hansen 1987:53). This will have rested on an older, less categorical sense of what it meant to be a slave.

Although metics had no direct political influence many were wealthy business owners who could, and sometimes did, influence policy by not allowing their citizen employees time off to attend the assembly, as well as having the simple expedient of wealth.

Contemporary opponents of [[majoritarianism]] (arguably the principle behind Athenian democracy) call it an illiberal regime (in contrast to [[liberal democracy]]) that allegedly leads to [[anomie]], [[balkanization]], and [[xenophobia]]. Proponents (especially of majoritarianism) deny these accusations, and argue that any faults in Athenian democracy were because the franchise was quite limited (only male citizens could vote - women, slaves and non-citizens were excluded). Despite this limited franchise, Athenian democracy was certainly the first - and perhaps the best - example of a working [[direct democracy]].

==Aftermath==
[[Alexander the Great]] had led a coalition of the Greek states to war with Persia in 336 BC, but his Greek soldiers were hostages for the behavior of their states as much as allies. His relations with Athens were already strained when he returned to [[Babylon]] in 324 BC; after his death, Athens and Sparta led several Greek states to war with Macedon and lost. 

This led to the first of a number of periods in which an outside power controlled Athens;&lt;ref&gt;322-318 BC; 317-307 BC; 266-229 BC (all Macedon); 58-55 BC (Rome).&lt;/ref&gt; Often the outside power set up a local agent as political boss in Athens; but when Athens was independent,&lt;ref&gt;It rarely controlled all of Attica, since Piraeus was an excellent naval base, and one of the Hellenistic kings usually controlled it.&lt;/ref&gt; it operated under its traditional form of government; even the bosses, like [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], kept the traditional institutions in formal existence. 

An independent Athens was a minor power in the Hellenistic age; it rarely had much in the way of foreign policy; it generally remained at peace, allied either with the Ptolemaic dynasty, or later, with Rome; when it went to war, the result (as in the [[Lamian War|Lamian]], [[Chremonidean War|Chremonidean]], and [[Mithridatic War]]) was usually disastrous. 

Under the Roman alliance, the more oligarchic parts of the Athenian constitution, the Areopagus and election of officials, became relatively more important, and the Assembly and selection by lot less so. After about 125 BC, the eponyous archon, and probably the others, were normally prominent men, and this oligarchic tendency appears to have been produced by a system of election.

In 88 BC, there was a revolution under the philosopher [[Athenion]], who persuaded the Assembly to agree to elect whoever he might ask to office. Athenion allied with [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates of Pontus]], and went to war with Rome; he was killed during the war, and was replaced by [[Aristion]]. The victorious Roman general, [[Publius Cornelius Sulla]], left the Athenians their lives and did not sell them into slavery; he also restored the previous government, in 86 BC.  

After Rome became an Empire under [[Augustus]], the nominal independence of Athens dissolved and its government converged to the normal type for a Roman municipality, with a Senate (''gerousia'') of ''[[decurion]]es''.&lt;ref&gt;Habicht, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arabic numerals''', known formally as '''Hindu-Arabic numerals''',  (also as '''[[Indian numerals]]''', '''[[Hindu numerals]]''', '''Western Arabic numerals''', '''[[European numerals]]''', or '''Western numerals''') are the most common [[symbol]]ic representation of [[number]]s around the world.  They are considered an important milestone in the development of [[mathematics]].

One may distinguish between the [[decimal]] system involved, also known as the [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]], and the precise [[glyph]]s used. The glyphs most commonly used in conjunction with the [[Latin alphabet]] since [[Early modern Europe|Early Modern]] times are &lt;big&gt;[[0 (number)|0]] [[1 (number)|1]] [[2 (number)|2]] [[3 (number)|3]] [[4 (number)|4]] [[5 (number)|5]] [[6 (number)|6]] [[7 (number)|7]] [[8 (number)|8]] [[9 (number)|9]]&lt;/big&gt;. 

The numerals arose in [[India]] between [[400 BC]] and [[400]] [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref name=ifrah&gt;Ifrah, Georges. 1999.

==History==
===Origins===
{{main|History of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system}}
The [[numerical digit|digits]] 1 to 9 in the [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]] evolved from the [[Brahmi numerals]]. [[Buddhist]] inscriptions from around 300 BCE use the symbols which became 1, 4 and 6. One century later, their use of the symbols which became 2, 7 and 9 was recorded.

The first universally accepted inscription containing the use of the 0 glyph is first recorded in the 9th century, in an inscription at [[Gwalior]] in [[Central India]] dated to 870.  By this time, the use of the glyph had already reached Persia, and was mentioned in [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Al-Khwarizmi]]'s descriptions of [[Indian numerals]].  Numerous Indian documents on [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper plates]] exist, with the same symbol for zero in them, dated back as far as the 6th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Robert. (2000). ''The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero'', Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:EgyptphoneKeypad.jpg|right|thumb|Modern-day Arab telephone keypad with two forms of Hindu-Arabic numerals: Western Arabic/European numerals on the left and [[Eastern Arabic numerals]] on the right]]

The [[numeral system]] came to be known to both the [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Al-Khwarizmi]], whose book ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'' written about 825 in [[Arabic]], and the [[Arab]] mathematician [[Al-Kindi]], who wrote four volumes, &quot;On the Use of the Indian Numerals&quot; (''Ketab fi Isti'mal al-'Adad al-Hindi'') about 830.  Their work was principally responsible for the diffusion of the Indian system of numeration in the [[Middle East]] and the West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 10th century, [[Middle-East]]ern mathematicians extended the decimal numeral system to include [[fractions]], as recorded in a treatise by [[Syrian]] mathematician [[Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi]] in 952–953. The [[decimal point]] notation was introduced by [[Sind ibn Ali]], he also wrote the earliest treatise on Arabic numerals.

A distinctive West Arabic variant of the symbols begins to emerge around the 10th century in the [[Maghreb]] and [[Al-Andalus]], called ''ghubar'' (&quot;sand-table&quot; or &quot;dust-table&quot;) numerals, which are the direct ancestor of the modern Western Arabic numerals used throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Origin of the Ghubār Numerals, or the Arabian Abacus and the Articuli|first=Solomon|last=Gandz|journal=[[Isis (Journal)|Isis]]|volume=16|issue=2|date=November 1931|pages=393–424|doi=10.1086/346615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mentions of the numerals in the West are found in the ''[[Codex Vigilanus]]'' of 976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathorigins.com/V.htm Mathorigins.com]&lt;/ref&gt; From the 980s, Gerbert of Aurillac (later, [[Pope Sylvester II]]) used his position to spread knowledge of the numerals in Europe.  Gerbert studied in [[Barcelona]] in his youth.  He was known to have requested mathematical treatises concerning the [[astrolabe]] from [[Lupitus of Barcelona]] after he had returned to France.

====Folk etymologies====
Some folk etymologies argue that the original forms of these symbols indicated their value through the number of angles they contained,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scribd.com/doc/13244252/Number-Story&lt;/ref&gt; however there is no proof of any such origin.

===Adoption in Europe===
[[Image:Talhoffer Thott 140r.jpg|thumb|A German manuscript page teaching use of Arabic numerals ([[Hans Talhoffer|Talhoffer]] Thott, 1459). At this time, knowledge of the numerals was still widely seen as esoteric, and Talhoffer presents them with the [[Hebrew alphabet]] and [[astrology]].]]

[[Image:Petrus Astronomus Astronomical clock in Uppsala Cathedral.jpg|thumb|300px|Woodcut showing the 16th century [[astronomical clock]] of [[Uppsala Cathedral]], with two clockfaces, one with Arabic and one with Roman numerals.]]
[[Image:Horloge-republicaine1.jpg|thumb|250px|Late 18th century French revolutionary &quot;decimal&quot; clockface.]]

In 825 [[Al-Khwarizmi|Al-Khwārizmī]] wrote a treatise in Arabic, ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'', which was translated into Latin from Arabic in the 12th century as ''Algoritmi de numero Indorum'', where ''Algoritmi'', the translator's rendition of the author's name, gave rise to the word ''[[algorithm]]'' (Latin ''algorithmus'', &quot;calculation method&quot;).

[[Leonardo of Pisa|Fibonacci]], a mathematician born in the [[Republic of Pisa]] who had studied in [[Bejaia]] ([[Bougie]]), [[Algeria]], promoted the Indian numeral system in [[Europe]] with his book ''[[Liber Abaci]]'', which was written in 1202:

:&quot;When my father, who had been appointed by his country as public notary in the customs at [[Bejaia|Bugia]] acting for the [[Pisa]]n merchants going there, was in charge, he summoned me to him while I was still a child, and having an eye to usefulness and future convenience, desired me to stay there and receive instruction in the school of accounting. There, when I had been introduced to the art of the Indians' nine symbols through remarkable teaching, knowledge of the art very soon pleased me above all else and I came to understand it..&quot;

The numerals are arranged with their lowest value digit to the right, with higher value positions added to the left. This arrangement was adopted identically into the numerals as used in Europe. Languages written in the Latin alphabet run from left to right, unlike languages written in the Arabic alphabet. Hence, from the point of view of the reader, numerals in Western texts are written with the highest power of the base first whereas numerals in Arabic texts are written with the lowest power of the base first.

The European acceptance of the numerals was accelerated by the invention of the [[printing press]], and they became widely known during the 15th century. Early evidence of their use in [[Great Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain]] includes, in England, a 1445 inscription on the tower of [[Heathfield and Waldron|Heathfield]] Church, [[Sussex]]; a 1448 inscription on a wooden lych-gate of [[Bray, Berkshire|Bray]] Church, [[Berkshire]]; and a 1487 inscription on the belfry door at [[Piddletrenthide]] church, [[Dorset]]; and in [[Scotland]] a 1470 inscription on the tomb of the first Earl of Huntly in [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] Cathedral. (See G.F. Hill, ''The Development of Arabic Numerals in Europe'' for more examples.) In central Europe, the [[King of Hungary]] [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]], started the use of Arabic numerals, which appear for the first time in a royal document of 1456.&lt;ref&gt;Erdélyi: Magyar művelődéstörténet 1-2. kötet. Kolozsvár, 1913, 1918&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-16th century, they were in common use in most of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52545.html Mathforum.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  Roman numerals remained in use mostly for the notation of [[Anno Domini]] years, and for numbers on clockfaces.  Sometimes, [[Roman numerals]] are still used for enumeration of lists (as an alternative to alphabetical enumeration), for sequential volumes, to differentiate monarchs or family members with the same first names, and (in lower case) to number pages in prefatory material in books.

===Adoption in Russia===
[[Cyrillic numerals]] were a numbering system derived from the [[Cyrillic alphabet]], used by [[South Slavs|South]] and [[East Slavs|East]] [[Slavic peoples]]. The system was used in Russia as late as the early 18th century when [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] replaced it with Arabic numerals.

===Adoption in China===
During [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (when Arabic numerals were first introduced into China), some Chinese mathematicians used [[Chinese numerals|Chinese numeral characters]] as positional system digits.  After the Qing dynasty, both the Chinese numeral characters and the [[Suzhou numerals]] were replaced by Arabic numerals in mathematical writings.

==Evolution of symbols==
{{main|Algorism|glyphs used with the Hindu-Arabic numeral system}}

The numeral system employed, known as [[algorism]], is [[positional notation|positional]] [[decimal]] notation.  Various symbol sets are used to represent numbers in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, all of which evolved from the [[Brahmi numerals]].  The symbols used to represent the system have split into various typographical variants since the [[Middle Ages]]:

*The widespread Western Arabic numerals used with the [[Latin alphabet]], in the table below labelled ''European'', descended from the West Arabic numerals developed in [[al-Andalus]] and the [[Maghreb]]. (There are two [[typographic]] styles for rendering European numerals, known as lining figures and [[text figures]]).
*The Arabic-Indic or [[Eastern Arabic numerals]] used with the [[Arabic alphabet]] developed primarily in what is now [[Iraq]]. A variant of the Eastern Arabic numerals used in the Persian and Urdu languages is shown as East Arabic-Indic. There is substantial variation in usage of glyphs for the Eastern Arabic-Indic digits, especially for the digits four, five, six, and seven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.0.0/ch08.pdf The Unicode Standard 5.0 – Electronic edition, Chapter 8 Middle Eastern Scripts]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Devanagari numerals]] used with [[Devanagari]] and related variants are grouped as [[Indian numerals]].

[[Image:Arabic numerals-en.svg|500px|Table of numerals]]

The evolution of the numerals in early Europe is shown on a table created by the French scholar J.E. Montucla in his ''Histoire de la Mathematique'', which was published in 1757:

[[Image:EuropeanFormOfArabianDigits.png|500px|Table of numerals]]

[[Image:Apices du moyen-âge.PNG|500px]]

The Arabic numerals are encoded in [[ASCII]] (and [[Unicode]]) at positions 48 to 57:

'''Apuleius''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|æ|p|jʉ|ˈ|l|iː|ə|s}}; sometimes called '''Lucius Apuleius'''; c. 125 – c. 180) was a [[Latin]] prose writer. He was a [[Berber people|Berber]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Berbers : ... The best known of them were the Roman author Apuleius, the Roman emperor Septimius Severus, and St. Augustine''&quot;, ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', Scholastic Library Publishing, 2005, v.3, p.569&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Madaurus]] (now [[M'Daourouch]], [[Algeria]]). He studied [[Platonism|Platonist philosophy]] in [[Athens]]; travelled to [[Italy]], [[Asia Minor]] and [[Egypt]]; and was an initiate in several cults or [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]]. The most famous incident in his life was when he was accused of using magic to gain the attentions (and fortune) of a wealthy widow. He declaimed and then distributed a witty ''tour de force'' in his own defense before the [[proconsul]] and a court of magistrates convened in [[Sabratha]], near [[Tripoli]]. This is known as the ''Apologia''.

His most famous work is his [[ribaldry|bawdy]] [[picaresque novel]], the ''Metamorphoses'', otherwise known as ''[[The Golden Ass]]''. It is the only [[Latin language|Latin]] novel that has survived in its entirety. It relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius, who experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into an [[donkey|ass]].

== Life ==
Apuleius was born in [[Madaurus]] (now [[M'Daourouch]], [[Algeria]]), a [[Roman colony]] in [[Numidia]] on the North African coast, bordering Gaetulia, and he described himself as &quot;half-[[Numidia]]n half-[[Gaetulia]]n.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Apuleius, Apology, 24&quot;&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 24&lt;/ref&gt; Madaurus was the same ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'' where [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] later received part of his early education, and, though located well away from the [[Romanized]] coast, is today the site of some pristine Roman ruins. As to his first name, no ''[[praenomen]]'' is given in any ancient source;&lt;ref&gt;P. G. Walsh, (1999) ''The Golden Ass'', page xi. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; late-medieval manuscripts began the tradition of calling him ''Lucius'' from the name of the hero of his novel.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Haig Gaisser, (2008), ''The fortunes of Apuleius and the Golden Ass: a study in transmission and Reception'', page 69. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Details regarding his life come mostly from his defense speech (''Apology'') and his work ''Florida'', which consists of snippets taken from some of his best speeches. 

His father was a provincial magistrate (''[[duumvir]]'')&lt;ref name=&quot;Apuleius, Apology, 24&quot;/&gt; who bequeathed at his death the sum of nearly two millions of [[sesterces]] to his two sons.&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 23&lt;/ref&gt; Apuleius studied with a master at [[Carthage]] (where he later settled) and later at [[Athens]], where he studied [[Platonism|Platonist philosophy]] among other subjects. He subsequently went to [[Rome]]&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Florida'', 17.4&lt;/ref&gt; to study [[Latin]] [[oratory]] and, most likely, to declaim in the law courts for a time before returning to his native North Africa. He also travelled extensively in [[Asia Minor]] and [[Egypt]], studying [[philosophy]] and [[religion]], burning up his inheritance while doing so.

Apuleius was an initiate in several cults or [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]], including the [[Dionysian mysteries]],&lt;ref&gt;As he proudly claims in his ''Apologia''. (Winter, Thomas Nelson (2006) [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=classicsfacpub ''Apology as Prosecution: The Trial of Apuleius''])&lt;/ref&gt; and the cult of [[Isis]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} He was a priest of [[Aesculapius]]&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Florida'' 16.38 and 18.38&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to Augustine,&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''Epistle'' 138,19.&lt;/ref&gt; ''sacerdos provinciae Africae'' (i.e. priest of the province of Carthage).

Not long after his return home he set out upon a new journey to [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Apuleius, Apology, 72&quot;&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 72.&lt;/ref&gt; On his way there he was taken ill at the town of [[Oea]] (modern-day [[Tripoli]]) and was hospitably received into the house of Sicinius Pontianus, with whom he had been friends when he had studied in Athens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apuleius, Apology, 72&quot;/&gt; The mother of Pontianus, Pudentilla, was a very rich widow. With her son's consent - indeed encouragement - Apuleius agreed to marry her.&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 73&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile Pontianus himself married the daughter of one Herennius Rufinus;  he, indignant that Pudentilla's wealth should pass out of the family, instigated his son-in-law, together with a younger brother, Sicinius Pudens, a mere boy, and their paternal uncle, Sicinius Aemilianus, to join him in impeaching Apuleius upon the charge that he had gained the affections of Pudentilla by charms and magic spells.&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 53, 66, 70, etc&lt;/ref&gt; The case was heard at [[Sabratha]], near Tripoli, c. 158 AD, before [[Claudius Maximus]], [[proconsul]] of [[Africa province|Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 1, 59, 65&lt;/ref&gt; The accusation itself seems to have been ridiculous, and the spirited and triumphant defence spoken by Apuleius is still extant. This is known as  the ''Apologia (A Discourse on Magic)''.

Of his subsequent career we know little. Judging from the many works of which he was author, he must have devoted himself assiduously to literature. He occasionally gave speeches in public with great applause; he had the charge of exhibiting gladiatorial shows and wild beast events in the province, and statues were erected in his honour by the senate of Carthage and of other senates.&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 55, 73; ''Florida'', iii. n. 16; Augustine, ''Ep.'' v.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physical Appearance====

There is a description of Lucius Apuleius in his own work [[The Golden Ass]], 2. 2. 8-9. When Lucius' aunt Byrrhena meets him in Hypata, she comments on his physical appearance describing his hair as yellow and his his eyes blue.&lt;ref&gt;Physiognomy in Apuleius Metamorphoses 2. 2, Hugh J. Mason, Classical Philology, Vol. 79, No. 4 (Oct., 1984) (pp. 307-309)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The golden ass, or, The metamorphoses By Apuleius, William Adlington, Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing, 2004, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Golden Ass===
{{Main|The Golden Ass}}
''The Golden Ass'' (''Asinus Aureus'') or ''Metamorphoses'' is the only [[Latin language|Latin]] novel that has survived in its entirety. It is an imaginative, irreverent, and amusing work that relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius, who experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into an [[donkey|ass]]. In this guise he hears and sees many unusual things, until escaping from his predicament in a rather unexpected way. Within this [[frame story]] are found multiple [[story within a story|digressions]], the longest among them being the well-known tale of [[Cupid and Psyche]].

The ''Metamorphoses'' ends with the (once again human) hero, Lucius, eager to be initiated into the [[mystery cult]] of [[Isis]]; he abstains from forbidden foods, bathes and purifies himself. He is introduced to the ''[[Navigium Isidis]]''. Then the secrets of the cult's books are explained to him, and further secrets revealed  before going through the process of initiation which involves a trial by the elements in a journey to the underworld. Lucius is then asked to seek initiation into the cult of [[Osiris]] in Rome, and eventually is initiated into the ''pastophoroi''—a group of priests that serves Isis and  Osiris.&lt;ref&gt;Iles Johnson, Sarah, ''Mysteries'', in ''Ancient Religions'' pp.104-5, The Belknap Press of Harvard University (2007), ISBN 978-0-674-02548-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
His other works are:
*''Apologia (A Discourse on Magic)''. Apuleius' courtroom defense. The work has very little to do with magic, and a lot to do with making mincemeat of his opponents, with hilarity and panache. It is among the funniest works that have come down to us from Antiquity, and one of the most entertaining examples of Latin courtroom oratory to survive.
*''Florida''. A compilation of twenty-three extracts from his various speeches and lectures.
*''On Plato and his Doctrine''. An outline in two books of [[Plato]]'s physics and ethics, preceded by a life of Plato
*''De Deo Socratis (On the God of Socrates)''. A work on the existence and nature of [[daemon (mythology)|daemons]], the intermediaries between gods and humans. This treatise was roughly attacked by Augustine.
*''On the Universe''. This Latin translation of the work ''[[On the Universe|De Mundo]]'' is probably by Apuleius.

Apuleius wrote many other works which have not survived. He wrote works of [[poetry]] and [[fiction]], as well as technical treatises on [[politics]], [[dendrology]], [[agriculture]], [[medicine]], [[natural history]], [[astronomy]], [[music]], and [[arithmetic]], and he translated Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;P. G. Walsh, (1999) ''The Golden Ass'', pages xiv-xv. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spurious works===
The extant works wrongly attributed to Apuleius are:&lt;ref&gt;Mark P. O. Morford, (2002), ''The Roman philosophers'', page 227. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''On interpretation'' (''Peri Hermeneias''). A brief Latin version of a guide to [[Aristotelian logic]].
*''Asclepius''. A Latin paraphrase of a lost Greek dialogue (''The perfect discourse'') featuring [[Asclepius]] and [[Hermes Trismegistus]].

[[Image:Alexander Selkirk Title Page.jpg|right|thumb|300px|An 1835 book inspired by Selkirk's life]]
'''Alexander Selkirk''' (1676 – 13 December 1721) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] sailor who spent four years as a [[castaway]] when he was [[marooning|marooned]] on an uninhabited [[island]]. It is probable that his travels provided the inspiration for [[Daniel Defoe]]'s novel ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]''.

== Early life ==
The son of a shoemaker and [[tanning|tanner]] in [[Lower Largo]], [[Fife]], [[Scotland]], Selkirk was born in 1676. In his youth he displayed a quarrelsome and unruly disposition.  Summoned on 27 August 1695 before the [[Kirk Session]] for his &quot;''undecent carriage''&quot; (indecent behaviour) in church, he &quot;''did not comper [appear], having gone away to þe [the] seas: this business is continued till his return''&quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[sic]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

At an early period he was engaged in [[buccaneer]] expeditions to the [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]] and in 1703 joined in with the expedition of famed [[privateer]] and [[exploration|explorer]] [[William Dampier]].   While Dampier was captain of the ''St. George,'' Selkirk served on the [[galley]] ''Cinque Ports'', the ''St. George''{{'}}s companion, as a [[sailing master]] serving under Thomas Stradling.

== Castaway ==
In October 1704, after the ships had parted ways because of a dispute between Stradling and Dampier, the ''[[Cinque Ports (1703 ship)|Cinque Ports]]'' was brought by Stradling to the uninhabited [[archipelago]] of [[Juan Fernández Islands|Juan Fernández]] off the coast of [[Chile]] for a mid-expedition restocking of supplies and fresh water. Selkirk had grave concerns by this time about the seaworthiness of this vessel (indeed, the ''Cinque Ports'' later foundered, losing most of its hands). He tried to convince some of his crewmates to desert with him, remaining on the island; he was counting on an impending visit by another ship.  No one else agreed to come along with him. Stradling declared that he would grant him his wish and leave him alone on Juan Fernández.  Selkirk promptly regretted his decision. He chased and called after the boat, to no avail.  Selkirk lived the next four years and four months without any human company.  All he had brought with him was a musket, gunpowder, carpenter's tools, a knife, a Bible, some clothing and rope. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

== Life on the island==
Hearing strange sounds from the inland, which he feared were dangerous beasts, Selkirk remained at first along the shoreline. During this time he ate [[shellfish]] and scanned the ocean daily for rescue, suffering all the while from loneliness, misery and remorse. Hordes of raucous [[Juan Fernandez fur seal|sea lion]]s, gathered on the beach for the mating season, eventually drove him to the island's interior.  Once there, his way of life took a turn for the better. More foods were now available: [[feral goat]]s &amp;ndash; introduced by earlier sailors &amp;ndash; provided him [[meat]] and [[milk]], wild [[turnips]], [[cabbage]], and [[black pepper]] berries offered him variety and spice.  Although [[rat]]s would attack him at night, he was able, by domesticating and living near feral [[cat]]s, to sleep soundly and in safety.

Selkirk proved resourceful in using equipment from the ship as well as materials that were native to the island. He built two [[Hut (dwelling)|hut]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7703375.stm | work=BBC News | title=Dig finds camp of 'real Crusoe' | date=1 November 2008 | first = Richard | last = Lloyd Parry}}&lt;/ref&gt; out of [[pimento tree]]s. He used his musket to hunt goats and his knife to clean their carcasses. As his gunpowder dwindled, he had to chase prey on foot. During one such chase he was badly injured when he tumbled from a cliff, lying unconscious for about a day. (His prey had cushioned his fall, sparing him a broken back.)&lt;ref name=fall&gt;Rodgers, Woodes, ''Providence display’d, or a very surprising account of one'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; He read from the [[Bible]] frequently, finding it a comfort to him in his condition and a mainstay for his English.

When Selkirk's clothes wore out, he made new garments from goatskin, using a [[nail (engineering)|nail]] for sewing. The lessons he had learned as a child from his father, a tanner, helped him greatly during his stay on the island. As his [[shoe]]s became unusable, he had no need to make new ones, since his toughened, callused feet made protection unnecessary. He forged a new knife out of barrel rings left on the beach.

Two vessels had arrived and departed before his escape, but both of them were [[Spain|Spanish]]: as a [[Scotland|Scotsman]] and [[privateer]], he risked a terrible fate if captured. He hid himself from these crews. At one point, his Spanish pursuers urinated at the bottom of a tree he was hiding in, but did not discover him.&lt;ref name=&quot;unsufferable&quot;&gt;Rodgers, Woodes, ''A Cruising Voyage round the World'' [http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_18c/defoe/selkirk.html#rogers Diary entry for Feb 2nd]&lt;/ref&gt;

His long-anticipated rescue occurred on 1 February 1709 by way of the ''Duke'', a privateering ship piloted by the above-mentioned [[William Dampier]]. Selkirk was discovered by the ''Duke''{{'}}s [[captain (nautical)|captain]], [[Woodes Rogers]], who referred to him as Governor of the island. Now rescued, he was almost incoherent in his joy. The agile Selkirk, catching two or three goats a day, helped restore the health of Rogers' men. Rogers eventually made Selkirk his mate, giving him independent command of one of his ships. Rogers' ''A cruising voyage round the world: first to the South-Sea, thence to the East-Indies, and homewards by the Cape of Good Hope'' was published in 1712 and included an account of Selkirk's ordeal. 

Journalist [[Richard Steele]] interviewed Selkirk about his adventures and wrote a much-read article about him in ''The Englishman''.&lt;ref name=&quot;the Englishman&quot;&gt;[http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_18c/defoe/selkirk.html#steele Article, dated 1 December 1713.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1717 Selkirk returned to Lower Largo but stayed only a few months. There he met Sophia Bruce, a sixteen-year-old dairymaid. They eloped to [[London]] but apparently did not marry. In March 1717 he  again went off to sea. While on a visit to [[Plymouth]], he married a widowed innkeeper. According to the ship's [[Logbook|log]], Selkirk died at 8 p.m. on 13 December 1721 while serving as a [[lieutenant]] on board the Royal ship ''Weymouth.'' He probably succumbed to the [[yellow fever]] which had devastated the voyage. He was buried at sea off the west coast of [[Africa]].

Several people who spoke to Selkirk after his rescue (such as Captain Rogers and the journalist Steele) were impressed by the tranquillity of mind and vigour of the body that Selkirk had attained while on the island. Rogers stated that &quot;one may see that Solitude and Retirement from the World is not such an unsufferable State of Life as most Men imagine, especially when People are fairly call'd or thrown into it unavoidably, as this Man was&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;unsufferable&quot;/&gt; Steele noted that &quot;This plain Man's Story is a memorable Example, that he is happiest who confines his Wants to natural Necessities; and he that goes further in his Desires, increases his Wants in Proportion to his Acquisitions&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;the Englishman&quot;/&gt;

== Commemoration ==
In 1863, the crew of [[HMS Topaze (1858)|HMS ''Topaze'']] placed a bronze tablet on a spot called Selkirk's Lookout on a hill of the island in memory of his stay.&lt;ref&gt;Kraske (2005), p.100&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 January 1966 Selkirk's island was officially renamed [[Robinson Crusoe Island]]. At the same time, the most western island of the [[Juan Fernández Islands]] was renamed [[Alejandro Selkirk Island]] although Selkirk probably never saw that island (97 miles west).

On 11 December 1885,  after a speech by [[Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Lord Aberdeen]], Lady Aberdeen unveiled a bronze statue and plaque of Alexander Selkirk outside a house on the site of Selkirk's original home on the Main Street of Lower Largo, Fife, Scotland.  David Gillies of Cardy House, Lower Largo, a descendant of the Selkirks, donated the statue and  T. Stuart Burnett ARAS designed it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsindependent.org/dates1-f.htm Notable Dates in History by Scots Independent]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological finding of the camp of Selkirk==
Around 2000, an expedition led by the Japanese Daisuke Takahashi, searching for Selkirk's camp on the island, found part of an early eighteenth (or late seventeenth) century nautical instrument that almost certainly belonged to Selkirk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1783811,00.html | accessdate = 2008-07-14 | location=London | work=The Times | title=In an ill hour I went on board a ship bound for London | date=17 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Dr. David Caldwell purports to have found his camp on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3286355/Mystery-of-Alexander-Selkirk-the-real-Robinson-Crusoe-solved.html | accessdate = 2008-10-30 | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Mystery of Alexander Selkirk, the real Robinson Crusoe, solved | first=Richard | last=Alleyne | date=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selkirk in other literary works ==
{{Wikisourcehas|1=the original text of William Cowper's|2=[[:wikisource:The Solitude of Alexander Selkirk|The Solitude of Alexander Selkirk]]}}
* [[William Cowper]]'s ''The Solitude Of Alexander Selkirk'' is about the feelings of Alexander Selkirk as he lived all alone on the island.  This poem gave rise to the common phrase ''monarch of all I survey'' via the verse:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''I am monarch of all I survey,
&lt;br /&gt;My right there is none to dispute;
&lt;br /&gt;From the centre all round to the sea,
&lt;br /&gt;I am lord of the fowl and the brute.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* In [[Allan Cole]] and [[Chris Bunch]]'s Sten science fiction series, Book Two, ''[[The Wolf Worlds]]'', the Scottish character Alex bemoans their predicament after crash landing; 'A slackit way f'r a mon,' Alex mourned to himself. 'Ah dinnae ken Ah'd ever be Alex Selkirk.'
* Selkirk is mentioned in ''Sailing Alone Around The World'' by [[Joshua Slocum]]. During his stay on the Juan Fernández Islands, Slocum runs across a marker commemorating Selkirk's stay.
* [[Charles Dickens]] used Selkirk as a simile in Chapter Two of ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'': &quot;Colonel Builder and Sir Thomas Clubber exchanged snuff–boxes, and looked very much like a pair of Alexander Selkirks — 'Monarchs of all they surveyed.'&quot;  This probably refers to [[Cowper|William Cowper]]'s poem.
* In his poem &quot;Inniskeen Road: July Evening&quot;, the poet [[Patrick Kavanagh]] likens his loneliness on the road to that of Selkirk:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Oh, Alexander Selkirk knew the plight&lt;br /&gt;
''Of being king and government and nation.&lt;br /&gt;
''A road, a mile of kingdom, I am king&lt;br /&gt;
''Of banks and stones and every blooming thing.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* In ''Etiquette'', one of [[W.S. Gilbert]]'s [[Bab Ballads]], Selkirk is used as a model for the English castaways:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''These passengers, by reason of their clinging to a mast,&lt;br /&gt;
''Upon a desert island were eventually cast.&lt;br /&gt;
''They hunted for their meals, as Alexander Selkirk used,&lt;br /&gt;
''But they couldn’t chat together – they had not been introduced.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:SM-3-launch-USS Shiloh-20060622.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System]]. A [[RIM-161 Standard Missile 3]] anti-ballistic missile is launched from [[USS Shiloh (CG-67)|USS ''Shiloh'']], a [[US Navy]] [[Ticonderoga class cruiser|''Ticonderoga''-class]] [[cruiser]].]]

An '''anti-ballistic missile''' ('''ABM''') is a [[missile]] designed to counter [[ballistic missile]]s (a missile for [[missile defense]]).
A ballistic missile is used to deliver [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]], [[Chemical warfare|chemical]], [[Biological warfare|biological]] or conventional [[warhead]]s in a [[ballistics|ballistic]] flight [[trajectory]]. The term &quot;anti-ballistic missile&quot; describes any antimissile system designed to counter ballistic missiles. However the term is used more commonly for systems designed to counter [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs).

==Current counter-ICBM systems==
There are only two systems in the world that can intercept ICBMs. Besides them, many smaller systems exist (tactical ABMs), that generally cannot intercept intercontinental strategic missiles, even if within range—an incoming ICBM simply moves too fast for these systems.

The Russian [[A-35 anti-ballistic missile system]] for defense of [[Moscow]] was established in 1971, has been improved since, and is still active. Presently it is called [[A-135 anti-ballistic missile system|A-135]] and it uses two missile types, [[Gorgon (missile)|Gorgon]] and [[Gazelle (missile)|Gazelle]]. They are, somewhat surprisingly, armed with [[nuclear warhead]]s themselves.

The U.S. [[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense]] (GMD; previously known as [[National Missile Defense]] - NMD) system has recently reached initial operational capability. Instead of using an explosive charge, it launches a {{ml|Projectile|Kinetic_projectiles|kinetic projectile}}. The George W. Bush administration accelerated development and deployment of a system proposed in 1998 by the Clinton administration. The system is a dual purpose test and interception facility in Alaska, and in 2006 was operational with a few interceptor missiles. The Alaska site provides more protection against North Korean missiles or accidental launches from Russia or China, but is likely less effective against missiles launched from the [[Middle East]]. President Bush referenced the [[9/11 attacks]] and the proliferation of ballistic missiles as reasons for missile defense. The current GMD system has the more limited goal of shielding against a limited attack by a [[rogue state]].

===US plans for Central European site===
{{see|National missile defense#Recent developments}}
During 1993, a symposium was held by western European nations to discuss potential future ballistic missile defence programs. In the end, the council recommended deployment of early warning and surveillance systems as well as regionally controlled defence systems.&lt;ref&gt;Assembly of the [[Western European Union]]. Technological and Aerospace Committee. Lenzer. via FAS.[http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/program/europe/weu_93/weu1363tasc.htm Anti-missile defence for Europe - guidelines drawn from the symposium]. 17 May 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 
During Spring 2006 reports about negotiations between the [[United States]] and [[Poland]] as well as the [[Czech Republic]] were published. The plans propose the installation of a latest generation ABM system with a radar site in the Czech Republic and the [[US missile defense complex in Poland|launch site in Poland]]. The system was announced to be aimed against ICBMs from [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]]. This caused harsh comments by then-[[Russia]]'s [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] at the [[OSCE]] security conference during spring 2007 in Munich. Other European ministers commented that any change of strategic weapons should be negotiated on [[NATO]] level and not 'unilaterally' between the US and other states (although most strategic arms reduction treaties were between the USSR and US, not NATO). [[germany|German]] foreign minister [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] expressed severe concerns about the way in which the USA had conveyed its plans to its European partners and criticised the US administration for not having consulted Russia prior to announcing its endeavours to deploy a new missile defence system in Central Europe – a criticism that was soon proven to be largely groundless, as the US had repeatedly informed Russia about its plans.&lt;ref&gt;Gaspers, J. (2007). [http://www.hsfk.de/fileadmin/content-ABM/Natolin_Analiza_7_2007.pdf A US Missile Defence Shield in Europe? Opinions and Arguments in the German Political Debate.

Pavel Felgenhauer. [http://www.cdi.org/russia/335-13.cfm New PR for an Old Missile]. December 14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current tactical systems==
{{anchor|Countries with ABM capability|reason=Old section name}}
Many short-range tactical ABM systems are currently operational, and three are most known: the U.S. Army [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot]], U.S. Navy [[Aegis combat system]], and the Israeli [[Arrow (missile)|Arrow missile]]. They are ''not'' capable of intercepting an ICBM, even if it is in range.

=== United States ===
[[Image:Standard Missile III SM-3 RIM-161 test launch 04017005.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[United States Navy]] [[RIM-161 Standard Missile 3]] anti-ballistic missile.]]
In several tests, the U.S. military have demonstrated the feasibility of destroying long and short range ballistic missiles. Combat effectiveness of newer systems against tactical ballistic missiles seems very high, as the [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot Advanced Capability 3]] (PAC-3) had a 100% success rate in Operation Iraqi Freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/ops/oif-patriot.htm  GlobalSecurity.org: ''Operation Iraqi Freedom - Patriot'']&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Navy [[Aegis combat system]] uses [[RIM-161 Standard missile SM-3]].

[[MIM-23 Hawk]] missile is not currently operational in the U.S. 

These systems, as opposed to US GMD system, are not capable of intercepting an ICBM, even if it is in range.&lt;!-- this section is not for counter-intercontinental defence!!! see counter-ICBM section above --&gt;

A new system, scheduled for deployment during 2009, is U.S. [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense]] (THAAD) system. It has a longer range, but it is not known if it will be able to intercept ICBMs.

=== Russia ===

The Moscow ABM defense system was, or is, based on:
*[[ABM-1 Galosh]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/abm1.htm GlobalSystems: ''ABM-1'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wonderland.org.nz/rusabgm.htm#ABM-1 Russian Anti-Ballistic Guided Missile Systems&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (decomissioned)

*[[ABM-4 Gorgon]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wonderland.org.nz/rusabgm.htm#ABM-4 Wonderland.org: ''ABM-4'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the main Moscow deployment, Russia has striven actively for intrinsic ABM capabilities of its late model SAM systems.

=== People's Republic of China ===
==== Historical Project 640 ====
Project 640 had been the PRC's indigenous effort to develop ABM capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;sinodefence.com&quot;&gt;http://www.sinodefence.com/special/airdefence/project640.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy of Anti-Ballistic Missile &amp; Anti-Satellite was established from 1969 for the purpose of developing Project 640.&lt;ref name=&quot;sinodefence.com&quot; /&gt; The project was to involve at least three elements, including the necessary sensors and guidance/command systems, the Fan Ji (FJ) missile interceptor, and the XianFeng missile-intercepting cannon.&lt;ref name=&quot;sinodefence.com&quot; /&gt; The FJ-1 had completed two successful flight tests during 1979, while the low-altitude interceptor FJ-2 completed some successful flight tests using scaled prototypes.&lt;ref name=&quot;sinodefence.com&quot; /&gt; A high altitude FJ-3 interceptor was also proposed. Despite the development of missiles, the programme was slowed down due to financial and political reasons. It was finally closed down during 1980 under a new leadership of Deng Xiao Peng as it was seemingly deemed unnecessary after the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States and the closure of the US Safeguard ABM system.&lt;ref name=&quot;sinodefence.com&quot; /&gt; 

However, the PRC's interest of continuing the ABM programme was seriously reconsidered after a series of events and a multitude of factors. The nuclear weapon tests in Asia, US intervention during the Taiwan Strait Crisis, ongoing developments of ballistic missile technology from multiple neighboring countries, and the United States' withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Treaty in 2002 may have otherwise convinced Beijing's renewed interests.

==== Operational Chinese system ====
In March 2006, China tested an interceptor system comparable to the U.S. Patriot missiles.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?bicode=060000&amp;biid=2006032829898&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.missilethreat.com/archives/id.537/detail.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecuritynewswire.org/gsn/nw_20100112_1311.php Pentagon Received No Warning of Chinese Missile Defense Test]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, China has acquired and is license-producing the [[SA-10A Grumble#S-300PMU-1/2 (SA-20)|S-300PMU-2/S-300PMU-1]] series of terminal ABM-capable SAMs. China produces the indigenous [[HQ-9]] SAM system &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sinodefence.com/army/surfacetoairmissile/hongqi9.asp&lt;/ref&gt; possessing possible terminal ABM capabilities respectively. PRC Navy's currently operating modern air-defense destroyers known as the [[Type 052C|Type 052C Destroyer]] and [[Type 051C destroyer|Type 051C Destroyer]] are armed with naval HHQ-9 missiles.

[[Surface-to-air missiles]] that have some terminal ABM capability (as opposed to midcourse capability):
* [[S-400_%28SAM%29|HQ-19]]
* [[HQ-9]]
* [[KS-1 Surface-to-air missile|KS-1]]
* [[S-300_(missile)#Operators_and_other_versions|HQ-18]]&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-Strategic-Weapon-Systems/HQ-18-S-300V-China.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[HQ-16]]
* [[HQ-15]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.missilethreat.com/missiledefensesystems/id.29/system_detail.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Development of midcourse ABM in China ====
The technology and experience from the successful [[2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test|anti-satellite test]] using a ground-launched interceptor during January 2007 was immediately applied to current ABM efforts and development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sinodefence.com/special/airdefence/fortress-china4.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=defense&amp;id=news/CHINA040809.xml&amp;headline=China%20adds%20precision%20strike%20to%20capabilities China Adds Precision Strike To Capabilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

China carried out a stunningly advanced [[2010 Chinese anti-ballistic missile test|land-based anti-ballistic missile test]] on 11 January 2010. The test was not only exoatmospheric, but done in midcourse&lt;ref name=wikileaks&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/wikileaks-files/china-wikileaks/8299323/DEMARCHE-FOLLOWING-CHINAS-JANUARY-2010-INTERCEPT-FLIGHT-TEST.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Passed | last=To | title=Demarche Following China's January 2010 Intercept Flight-Test | date=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; phase and with a [[kinetic kill vehicle]]. China is the second country after US that demonstrated intercepting ballistic missile with [[kinetic kill vehicle]], the interceptor missile was [[DF-21#KT ABM.2FASAT|SC-19]].&lt;ref name=wikileaks /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;anti-BM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mil.news.sina.com.cn/2010-01-12/0247580308.html |title=我国试验陆基反导 此前仅美国进行过相关试验 |publisher=SINA News |date=2010年01月12日 02:47  |accessdate= 11 January 2010| language={{zh icon}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sources suggest the system is not operationally deployed as of 2010,&lt;ref name=wikileaks /&gt; but the gap in ABM development between United States and China closes quicker than anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecuritynewswire.org/gsn/nw_20100114_5918.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional to ABM capability, China's missiles also possess [[anti-satellite]] (ASAT) capabilities. ABM/[[ASAT]] missiles (it is not known which have midcourse ABM capability):
* Other KT variants are under development
* [[DF-21#KT ABM.2FASAT|KT-III]]
* [[DF-21#KT ABM.2FASAT|KT-IIA]]
* [[DF-21#KT ABM.2FASAT|KT-II]]

The Arrow ABM system was designed and constructed in Israel with financial support by the [[United States]] by a multi-billion dollar development program called &quot;Minhelet Homa&quot; with the participation of companies like [[Israel Military Industries]], [[Tadiran Telecom|Tadiran]] and [[Israel Aerospace Industries]].

During 1998 the Israeli military conducted a successful test of their Arrow missile. Designed to intercept incoming missiles travelling at up to 2 mile/s (3&amp;nbsp;km/s), the Arrow is expected to perform much better than the Patriot did in the Gulf War. On July 29, 2004 Israel and the United States carried out joint experiment in the USA, in which the Arrow was launched against a real Scud missile. 
The experiment was a success, as the Arrow destroyed the Scud with a direct hit. During December 2005 the system was deployed successfully in a test against a replicated [[Shahab-3]] missile. This feat was repeated on February 11, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6352659.stm | work=BBC News | title=Israeli missile test 'successful' | date=February 11, 2007 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
