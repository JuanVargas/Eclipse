land]] did an enormous amount of research for his [[Academy Award]]-winning script. Among other things, he took out advertisements in London newspapers seeking memories of the 1924 Olympics, and interviewed everyone involved who was still alive. [[Aubrey Montague]]'s son sent him copies of the letters his father had sent home — which gave Welland something to use as a narrative bridge in the film. Except for changes in the greetings of the letters from &quot;Darling Mummy&quot; to &quot;Dear Mum&quot; and the change from Oxford to Cambridge, all of the readings from Montague's letters are from the originals.&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt;

[[Ian Charleson]] himself wrote Eric Liddell's speech to the post-race workingmen's crowd at the Scotland v. Ireland races. Charleson, who had been studying the Bible intensively in preparation for the role, told director Hugh Hudson that he didn't feel the portentous and sanctimonious scripted speech was either authentic or inspiring. Hudson and Welland allowed him to write words he personally found inspirational instead.&lt;ref&gt;Ian McKellen, Hugh Hudson, Alan Bates, et al. [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0094702500 ''For Ian Charleson: A Tribute'']. London: Constable and Company, 1990. pp. 37–39. ISBN 0-09-470250-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was slightly altered for the U.S. audience. A brief scene depicting a pre-Olympics [[cricket]] game between Abrahams, Liddell, Montague, and the rest of the British track team appears shortly after the beginning of the original film. For the American audience, this brief scene was deleted. In the U.S., to avoid the initial child's G rating, which might have hindered box office sales, a different scene was used — one depicting Abrahams and Montague arriving at a Cambridge railway station and encountering two [[World War I]] veterans who use an [[shit|obscenity]] — in order to be given a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG rating]].&lt;ref&gt;Puttnam interviewed in BBC Radio obituary of [[Jack Valenti]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
{{Main|Chariots of Fire (album)}}
[[File:Charleson on beach.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ian Charleson]] (foreground) and [[Ben Cross]] (left) running in the &quot;[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Chariots of Fire]]&quot; music scene which bookends the film.]]
Although the film is a period piece, set in the 1920s, the [[Academy Award]]-winning original soundtrack composed by [[Vangelis]] uses a modern 1980s electronic sound, with a strong use of [[synthesizers|synthesizer]] and piano among other instruments. This was a bold and significant departure from earlier period films, which employed sweeping orchestral instrumentals. The [[Chariots of Fire (single)|title theme of the film]] has become iconic, and has been used in subsequent films and television shows during slow-motion segments.

Director Hugh Hudson originally wanted Vangelis's 1977 tune &quot;L'Enfant&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kRS4pkrBqE &quot;L'Enfant&quot;, from ''Opera Sauvage'']&lt;/ref&gt; from his 1979 ''[[Opera Sauvage]]'' album, to be the title theme of the film, and the beach running sequence was actually filmed with &quot;L'Enfant&quot; playing on loudspeakers for the runners to pace to. Vangelis finally convinced Hudson he could create a new and better piece for the film's main theme — and when he played the now-iconic &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; theme for Hudson, it was agreed the new tune was unquestionably better.&lt;ref&gt;Vangelis in ''Chariots of Fire – The Reunion'' (2005 video; featurette on 2005 ''Chariots of Fire'' DVD)&lt;/ref&gt; But the &quot;L'Enfant&quot; melody still made it into the film: When the athletes reach Paris and enter the stadium, a brass band marches through the field, and first plays a modified, acoustic performance of &quot;L'Enfant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsew.com/data/trivia.htm Trivia about Vangelis]&lt;/ref&gt; Vangelis's electronic &quot;L'Enfant&quot; track eventually was used prominently in the 1982 film ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously]]''.

Some pieces of Vangelis's music in the film did not end up on the film's soundtrack album. One of them is the background music to the race Eric Liddell runs in the Scottish highlands. This piece is a version of &quot;Hymn&quot;, the original version of which appears on Vangelis's 1979 album, ''[[Opéra sauvage]]''. Various versions are also included on Vangelis's compilation albums ''[[Themes (Vangelis album)|Themes]]'', ''[[Portraits (So Long Ago, So Clear)|Portraits]]'', and ''[[Odyssey: The Definitive Collection]]'', though none of these include the version used in the film.

Five lively [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] tunes also appear in the soundtrack, and serve as jaunty period music which nicely counterpoints Vangelis's modern electronic score. These are: &quot;He is an Englishman&quot; from ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', &quot;Three Little Maids from School Are We&quot; from ''[[The Mikado]]'', &quot;With Catlike Tread&quot; from ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', &quot;The Soldiers of Our Queen&quot; from ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', and &quot;There Lived a King&quot; from ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.

The film also incorporates a major traditional work: &quot;[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]&quot;, sung by a British choir at the 1978 funeral of Harold Abrahams. The hymn, which was written during World War I as a celebration of England and which has become &quot;England's unofficial national anthem&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Blair.

===Casting===
Director [[Hugh Hudson]] was determined to cast young, unknown actors in all the major roles of the film, and to back them up by using veterans like [[John Gielgud]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], and [[Ian Holm]] as their supporting cast. Hudson and producer [[David Puttnam]] did months of fruitless searching for the perfect actor to play Eric Liddell. They then saw Scottish stage actor [[Ian Charleson]] performing the role of Pierre in the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s production of ''[[Piaf (play)|Piaf]]'', and knew immediately they had found their man. Unbeknownst to them, Charleson had heard about the film from his father, and desperately wanted to play the part, feeling it would &quot;fit like a kid glove&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ian McKellen, Hugh Hudson, Alan Bates, et al. ''For Ian Charleson: A Tribute''. London: Constable and Company, 1990. pp. xix, 9, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ben Cross]], who plays Harold Abrahams, was discovered while playing Billy Flynn in ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. In addition to having a natural pugnaciousness, he had the desired ability to sing and play the piano.&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bencross.net/biography.html Ben Cross – Bio on Official site]&lt;/ref&gt; Cross was thrilled to be cast, and said he was moved to tears by the film's script.&lt;ref name=wings&gt;''Wings on Their Heels: The Making of'' Chariots of Fire. (2005 video; featurette on 2005 DVD).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[20th Century Fox]], which raised half the money for the film,&lt;ref name=reunion /&gt; insisted on having a couple of notable American names in the cast, to ensure audience attendance in the U.S. Thus the small parts of the two American champion runners, Jackson Scholz and Charlie Paddock, were cast with recent headliners: [[Brad Davis (actor)|Brad Davis]] had recently starred in ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'', and [[Dennis Christopher]] had recently starred, as a young bicycle racer, in the popular indie film ''[[Breaking Away]]''.&lt;ref name=wings /&gt;

All of the actors portraying runners underwent a gruelling three-month training intensive, with renowned running coach Tom McNab. This training and isolation of the actors also created a strong bond and sense of camaraderie among them.&lt;ref name=wings /&gt;

===Filming locations===
[[File:Chariots of Fire beach.jpg|thumb|left|280px|The famous beach running scene.]]

The famous beach scenes associated with the theme tune were filmed at West Sands, [[St. Andrews]]. A plaque commemorating the filming can be found there today. The very last scene of the opening titles crosses the 1st and 18th holes of the [[Old Course at St Andrews|Old Course]] at [[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews|St. Andrews Golf Course]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotlandthemovie.com/movies/andrews.html ''Chariots of Fire'' – St Andrews] ''Scotland: The Movie Location Guide''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graylinescotland.com/tour.asp?tourid=46 Tours: St Andrews] ''Gray Line Tours''. Describes Grannie Clark’s Wynd, a public right-of-way over the 1st and the 18th of the Old Course, which was where the athletes were filmed running for the final titles shot.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the Cambridge scenes were actually filmed at Hugh Hudson's alma mater [[Eton College]], because Cambridge refused filming rights, fearing depictions of anti-Semitism. This was a decision the Cambridge administration greatly regretted after the film's enormous success.&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt; 

Liverpool Town Hall was the setting for the scenes depicting the British Embassy in Paris.&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt; The [[Colombes]] [[Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir|Olympic Stadium]] in Paris was represented by The Oval Sports Centre, [[Bebington]], [[Merseyside]].&lt;ref name=where&gt;{{Cite document|url=http://www.wheredidtheyfilmthat.co.uk/film.php?film_id=60|title=Chariots of Fire|publisher=Where Did They Film That?|accessdate=18 February 2007|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearby [[Woodside, Merseyside|Woodside]] ferry terminal was used to represent the embarcation scenes set in [[Dover]].&lt;ref name=where /&gt; The railway station scenes were filmed at the [[National Railway Museum]] in York.&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt; The scene depicting a performance of ''[[The Mikado]]'' was filmed in the [[Savoy Theatre]] with members of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ian, ed.[http://books.google.com/books?id=pPj0nly_1OQC&amp;pg=PA576&amp;dq=%22savoy+theatre%22+%22chariots+of+fire%22&amp;num=100#v=onepage&amp;q=%22savoy%20theatre%22%20%22chariots%20of%20fire%22&amp;f=false ''The Complete Annotated Gilbert and Sullivan.''] Oxford University Press, 2005. p. 576.&lt;/ref&gt; The dinner scene between Harold and Sybil was filmed at the Café Royal Oyster Bar in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082158/locations ''Chariots of Fire – Filming locations] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Consequentialism''' refers to those [[morality|moral]] theories which hold that the [[consequences]] of one's conduct are the true basis for any judgement about the morality of that conduct. Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right act (or omission) is one that will produce a good outcome, or consequence. This view is often expressed as the [[aphorism]] &quot;The ends justify the means&quot;.

Consequentialism is usually understood as distinct from [[deontological ethics|deontology]], in that deontology derives the rightness or wrongness of one's conduct from the character of the behaviour itself rather than the outcomes of the conduct. It is also distinguished from [[virtue ethics]], which focuses on the character of the agent rather than on the nature or consequences of the act (or omission) itself.

The difference between these three approaches to morality tends to lie more in the way moral dilemmas are approached than in the moral conclusions reached. For example, a consequentialist may argue that lying is wrong because of the negative consequences produced by lying—though a consequentialist may allow that certain foreseeable consequences might make lying acceptable. A deontologist might argue that lying is ''always'' wrong, regardless of any potential &quot;good&quot; that might come from lying. A virtue ethicist, however, would focus less on lying in any particular instance and instead consider what a decision to tell a lie or not tell a lie said about one's character and moral behavior.

==Definition==
The term &quot;consequentialism&quot; was coined by [[G. E. M. Anscombe]] in her essay &quot;[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]&quot; in 1958, to describe what she saw as the central error of certain moral theories, such as those propounded by [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] and [[Henry Sidgwick|Sidgwick]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Anscombe&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|authorlink=G. E. M. Anscombe |title=Modern Moral Philosophy |journal=Philosophy |volume=33 |pages=1–19 |url=http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/cmt/mmp.html |doi=10.1017/S0031819100037943 |year=1958 |author=Anscombe, G. E. M. |publisher=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the term has become common in English-language ethical theory.

===Kinds of consequences===
One way to divide various consequentialisms is by the types of consequences that are taken to matter most, that is, which consequences count as good states of affairs. According to hedonistic [[utilitarianism]], a good action is one that results in an increase in [[pleasure]], and the best action is one that results in the most pleasure for the greatest number. Closely related is [[eudaimonia|eudaimonic]] consequentialism, according to which a full, flourishing life, which may or may not be the same as enjoying a great deal of pleasure, is the ultimate aim. Similarly, one might adopt an aesthetic consequentialism, in which the ultimate aim is to produce beauty. However, one might fix on non-psychological goods as the relevant effect. Thus, one might pursue an increase in [[Equality of outcome|material equality]] or [[Freedom (political)|political liberty]] instead of something like the more ephemeral &quot;pleasure&quot;. Other theories adopt a package of several goods, all to be promoted equally.  Whether a particular consequentialist theory focuses on a single good or many, conflicts and tensions between different good states of affairs are to be expected and must be adjudicated.

===Consequences for whom===
Moral action always has an effect on certain people or things, the consequences. Various kinds of consequentialism can be differentiated by beneficiary of the good consequences. That is, one might ask &quot;Consequences for whom?&quot;

====Agent-focused or agent-neutral====
A fundamental distinction can be drawn between theories that demand that agents act for ends in which they have some personal interest or [[motivation]] and theories that demand that agents act for ends perhaps disconnected from their own interests and drives. These are called &quot;agent-focused&quot; and &quot;agent-neutral&quot; theories respectively. Agent-neutral consequentialism ignores the specific value a state of affairs has for any particular agent. Thus, in an agent-neutral theory, an actor's personal goals do not count any more than anyone else's goals in evaluating what action the actor should take. Agent-focused consequentialism, on the other hand, focuses on the particular needs of the moral agent. Thus, in an agent-focused account, such as one that [[Peter Railton]] outlines, the actor might be concerned with the general welfare, but the actor is ''more'' concerned with the immediate welfare of herself and her friends and family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheffler&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = Consequentialism and Its Critics | year = 1988 | last = Scheffler | first = Samuel (Ed.) | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-875073-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two approaches could be reconciled by acknowledging the tension between an agent's interests as an individual and as a member of various groups, and seeking to somehow optimize among all of these interests. For example, it may be meaningful to speak of an action as being good for someone as an individual but bad for them as a citizen of their town.

====Human-centered?====
Many consequentialist theories may seem primarily concerned with human beings and their relationships with other human beings. However, some philosophers argue that we should not limit our ethical consideration to the interests of human beings alone. [[Jeremy Bentham]], who is regarded as the founder of [[Utilitarianism]], argues that animals can experience pleasure and pain, thus demanding that 'non-human animals' should be a serious object of moral concern.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bentham&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = An Introduction to the Principles of Moral Legislation | year = 1996 | last = Bentham | first = Jeremy | authorlink = Jeremy Bentham |publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-820516-6 | url = http://www.la.utexas.edu/research/poltheory/bentham/ipml/ipml.toc.html}}{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Peter Singer]] has argued that it is unreasonable that we do not give equal consideration to the interests of animals as to those of human beings when we choose the way we are to treat them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = Unsanctifying Human Life | last = Singer | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Singer | editor = Helga Kuhse, ed. | year = 2002 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-631-22507-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such equal consideration does not necessarily imply identical treatment of humans and non-humans, any more than it necessarily implies identical treatment of all humans.

===Action guidance===
One important characteristic of many [[Normative ethics|normative]] moral theories such as consequentialism is the ability to produce practical moral judgements. At the very least, any moral theory needs to define the standpoint from which the goodness of the consequences are to be determined. What is primarily at stake here is the [[moral responsibility|''responsibility'']] of the agent.

====The ideal observer====
One common tactic among consequentialists, particularly those committed to an [[Altruism|altruistic]] (selfless) account of consequentialism, is to employ an ideal, neutral observer from which moral judgements can be made. [[John Rawls]], a critic of utilitarianism, argues that utilitarianism, in common with other forms of consequentialism, relies on the perspective of such an ideal observer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheffler&quot;/&gt; The particular characteristics of this ideal observer can vary from an omniscient observer, who would grasp all the consequences of any action, to an ideally informed observer, who knows as much as could reasonably be expected, but not necessarily all the circumstances or all the possible consequences. Consequentialist theories that adopt this paradigm hold that right action is the action that will bring about the best consequences from this ideal observer's perspective.

====The real observer====
In practice, it is very difficult, and at times arguably impossible, to adopt the point of view of an ideal observer. Individual moral agents do not know everything about their particular situations, and thus do not know all the possible consequences of their potential actions. For this reason, some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents to choose the best action in line with what they know about the situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackie&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mackie |first=J. L. |authorlink=J._L._Mackie |publishyear=1977 |title=Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong |publisher=Penguin |location=London |isbn=0-14-013558-8 |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if this approach is naïvely adopted, then moral agents who, for example, recklessly fail to reflect on their situation, and act in a way that brings about terrible results, could be said to be acting in a morally justifiable way. Acting in a situation without first informing oneself of the circumstances of the situation can lead to even the most well-intended actions yielding miserable consequences. As a result, it could be argued that there is a moral imperative for an agent to inform himself as much as possible about a situation before judging the appropriate course of action. This imperative, of course, is derived from consequential thinking: a better-informed agent is able to bring about better consequences.

==Varieties of consequentialism==
===Utilitarianism===

[[Image:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jeremy Bentham]], best known for his advocacy of utilitarianism]]

{{cquote2|
Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do. On the one hand the standard of right and wrong, on the other the chain of causes and effects, are fastened to their throne. They govern us in all we do, in all we say, in all we think...
| Jeremy Bentham
|''The Principles of Morals and Legislation'' (1789) Ch I, p 1
}}

Summarily, [[Jeremy Bentham]] states that people are driven by their interests and their fears, but their interests take precedence over their fears, and their interests are carried out in accordance with how people view the consequences that might be involved with their interests. &quot;Happiness&quot; on this account is defined as the maximization of pleasure and the minimization of pain.

Historically, hedonistic utilitarianism is the paradigmatic example of a consequentialist moral theory. This form of utilitarianism holds that what matters is the aggregate happiness; the happiness of everyone and not the happiness of any particular person. [[John Stuart Mill]], in his exposition of hedonistic utilitarianism, proposed a hierarchy of pleasures, meaning that the pursuit of certain kinds of pleasure is more highly valued than the pursuit of other pleasures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mill&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = Utilitarianism | year = 1998 | last = Mill | first = John Stuart | authorlink = John Stuart Mill | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-875163-2 | url = http://www.utilitarianism.com/mill1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some contemporary utilitarians, such as [[Peter Singer]] are concerned to maximize the satisfaction of preferences, hence &quot;[[preference utilitarianism]]&quot;. Other contemporary forms of utilitarianism mirror the forms of consequentialism outlined below.

===Ethical egoism and altruism===
{{Main|Ethical egoism|Altruism (ethics)}}

[[Ethical egoism]] can be understood as a consequentialist theory according to which the consequences for the individual agent are taken to matter more than any other result. Thus, egoism will prescribe actions that may be beneficial, detrimental, or neutral to the welfare of others.  Some, like [[Henry Sidgwick]], argue that a certain degree of egoism ''promotes'' the general welfare of society for two reasons: because individuals know how to please themselves best, and because if everyone were an austere altruist then general welfare would inevitably decrease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidgwick&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Method of Ethics | year = 1907 | last = Sidgwick | first = Henry | authorlink = Henry Sidgwick | publisher = Dover (1981) | location = NY | isbn = 0915145286  | url = http://www.la.utexas.edu/methsidg/me/}}{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Altruism (ethics)|Ethical altruism]] can be seen as a consequentialist ethic which prescribes that an individual take actions that have the best consequences for everyone except for himself.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ethics&quot; by James Fisher and Bradley Dowdwen, in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/]&lt;/ref&gt; This was advocated by [[Auguste Comte]], who coined the term &quot;altruism,&quot; and whose ethics can be summed up in the phrase: Live for others.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Gabriel Christian Religion and National Interests&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rule consequentialism===
In general, consequentialist theories focus on actions. However, this need not be the case. Rule consequentialism is a theory that is sometimes seen as an attempt to reconcile [[deontology]] and consequentialism—and in some cases, this is stated as a criticism of rule consequentialism.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Williams, &quot;Utilitarianism&quot; in his ''Morality'', Cambridge University Press 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  Like deontology, rule consequentialism holds that moral behavior involves following certain rules. However, rule consequentialism chooses rules based on the consequences that the selection of those rules have.

Various theorists are split as to whether the rules are the only determinant of moral behavior or not. For example, [[Robert Nozick]] holds that a certain set of minimal rules, which he calls &quot;side-constraints&quot;, are necessary to ensure appropriate actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheffler&quot;/&gt; There are also differences as to how absolute these moral rules are. Thus, while Nozick's side-constraints are absolute restrictions on behavior, [[Amartya Sen]] proposes a theory that recognizes the importance of certain rules, but these rules are not absolute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheffler&quot;/&gt; That is, they may be violated if strict adherence to the rule would lead to much more undesirable consequences.

One of the most common objections to rule-consequentialism is that it is incoherent, because it is based on the consequentialist principle that what we should be concerned with is maximizing the good, but then it tells us not to act to maximize the good, but to follow rules (even in cases where we know that breaking the rule could produce better results).

[[Brad Hooker]] avoided this objection by not basing his form of rule-consequentialism on the ideal of maximizing the good. He writes:

&quot;…the best argument for rule-consequentialism is not that it derives from an overarching commitment to maximise the good. The best argument for rule-consequentialism is that it does a better job than its rivals of matching and tying together our moral convictions, as well as offering us help with our moral disagreements and uncertainties&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Brad Hooker, ''Ideal Code, Real World'' Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Derek Parfit]] described [[Brad Hooker]]'s book on rule-consequentialism ''Ideal Code, Real World'' as the &quot;best statement and defence, so far, of one of the most important moral theories.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Brad Hooker, ''Ideal Code, Real World'' Oxford University Press, new edition 2002, back cover [http://www.amazon.co.uk/reader/0199256578/278-8451642-5085302?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ref_=sib_rdr_bc&amp;j=0&amp;page=234#reader-page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rule consequentialism exists in the forms of [[rule utilitarianism]] and [[rule egoism]].

===Motive consequentialism===
Another consequentialist version is motive consequentialism which looks if the state of affairs that results from the motive to choose an action is better or at least as good as each of the alternative state of affairs that would have resulted from alternative actions. This version gives relevance to the motive of an act and links it to its consequences. An act can therefore not be wrong if the decision to act was based on a right motive. A possible inference is, that one can not be blamed for mistaken judgements if the motivation was to do good.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, R.M. 1976. ''Motive Utilitarianism'', Journal of Philosophy, 73: 467-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative consequentialism===
Most consequentialist theories focus on ''promoting'' some sort of good consequences. However, one could equally well lay out a consequentialist theory that focuses solely on minimizing bad consequences. ([[Negative utilitarianism]] is an actual example.) Of course, the maximization of good consequences could in practice also involve the minimization of bad consequences, but the promotion of good consequences is usually of primary import.

One major difference between these two approaches is the agent's responsibility. Positive consequentialism demands that we bring about good states of affairs, whereas negative consequentialism may only require that we avoid bad ones. A more strenuous version of negative consequentialism may actually require active intervention, but only to prevent harm from being done. An alternative theory (using the example of negative utilitarianism) is that some consider the reduction of suffering (for the disadvantaged) to be more valuable than increased pleasure (for the affluent or luxurious).

===Teleological ethics===
'''Teleological ethics''' (Greek telos, “end”; logos, “science”) is an ethical theory that holds that the ends or consequences of an act determine whether an act is good or evil.  Teleological theories are often discussed in opposition to [[deontological]] ethical theories, which hold that acts themselves are ''inherently'' good or evil, regardless of the consequences of acts.

Teleological theories differ on the nature of the end that actions ought to promote. [[Eudaemonist]] theories (Greek eudaimonia, &quot;happiness&quot;) hold that the goal of ethics consists in some function or activity appropriate to man as a human being, and thus tend to emphasize the cultivation of virtue or excellence in the agent as the end of all action. These could be the classical virtues—[[courage]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], [[Justice (virtue)|justice]], and [[wisdom]]—that promoted the Greek ideal of man as the &quot;rational animal&quot;, or the theological virtues—[[Faith in Christianity|faith]], [[hope]], and [[love]]—that distinguished the Christian ideal of man as a being created in the image of God.

Utilitarian-type theories hold that the end consists in an experience or feeling produced by the action. [[Hedonism]], for example, teaches that this feeling is pleasure—either one's own, as in egoism (the 17th-century English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]]), or everyone's, as in [[universalistic hedonism]], or [[utilitarianism]] (the 19th-century English philosophers [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Henry Sidgwick]]), with its formula of the &quot;greatest pleasure of the greatest number.&quot;

Other utilitarian-type views include the claims that the end of action is survival and growth, as in [[evolutionary ethics]] (the 19th-century English philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]]); the experience of power, as in [[despotism]] (the 16th-century Italian political philosopher [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and the 19th-century German [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]); satisfaction and adjustment, as in [[pragmatism]] (20th-century American philosophers [[Ralph Barton Perry]] and [[John Dewey]]); and freedom, as in [[existentialism]] (the 20th-century French philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]).

The chief problem for [[eudaemonist]] theories is to show that leading a life of virtue will also be attended by happiness—by the winning of the goods regarded as the chief end of action. That [[Job (Bible)|Job]] should suffer and [[Socrates]] and [[Jesus]] die while the wicked prosper, then seems unjust. Eudaemonists generally reply that the universe is moral and that, in Socrates' words, “No evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death,” or, in Jesus' words, “But he who endures to the end will be saved.”

Utilitarian theories, on the other hand, must answer the charge that ends do not justify the means. The problem arises in these theories because they tend to separate the achieved ends from the action by which these ends were produced. One implication of utilitarianism is that one's intention in performing an act may include all of its foreseen consequences. The goodness of the intention then reflects the balance of the good and evil of these consequences, with no limits imposed upon it by the nature of the act itself—even if it be, say, the breaking of a promise or the execution of an innocent man. Utilitarianism, in answering this charge, must show either that what is apparently immoral is not really so or that, if it really is so, then closer examination of the consequences will bring this fact to light. Ideal utilitarianism ([[G.E. Moore]] and [[Hastings Rashdall]]) tries to meet the difficulty by advocating a plurality of ends and including among them the attainment of virtue itself, which, as [[John Stuart Mill]] affirmed, &quot;may be felt a good in itself, and desired as such with as great intensity as any other good.&quot;

==Consequentialism and other moral theories==
===Deontology===
Consequentialism is often contrasted with [[deontological ethics|deontological moral theories]]. Deontological theories hold that we have a duty to perform or refrain from certain types of actions and that this duty derives from the nature of the act itself, rather than from the consequences produced by the action. Consequently, a deontologist might argue that we should stick to our duty regardless of the consequences. For example, [[Kant]] famously argued that we have a moral duty to always tell the truth, even to a murderer who asks where the would-be victim is.

However, consequentialist and deontological theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, [[T.M. Scanlon]] advances the idea that human rights, which are commonly considered a &quot;deontological&quot; concept, can only be justified with reference to the consequences of having those rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheffler&quot;/&gt; Similarly, [[Robert Nozick]] argues for a theory that is mostly consequentialist, but incorporates inviolable &quot;side-constraints&quot; which restrict the sort of actions agents are permitted to do.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheffler&quot;/&gt;

===Virtue ethics===
Consequentialism can also be contrasted with [[arete|aretaic]] moral theories such as [[virtue ethics]]. Whereas consequentialist theories posit that consequences of action should be the primary focus of our thinking about ethics, virtue ethics insists that it is the character rather than the consequences of actions that should be the focal point. Some virtue ethicists hold that consequentialist theories totally disregard the development and importance of moral character. For example, [[Philippa Foot]] argues that consequences in themselves have no ethical content, unless it has been provided by a virtue such as benevolence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheffler&quot;/&gt;

However, consequentialism and virtue ethics need not be understood to be entirely antagonistic. Consequentialist theories can consider character in several ways. For example, the effects on the character of the agent or any other people involved in an action may be regarded as a relevant consequence. Similarly, a consequentialist theory may aim at the maximization of a particular virtue or set of virtues. Finally, following Foot's lead, one might adopt a sort of consequentialism that argues that virtuous activity ultimately produces the best consequences.

[[File:Max Weber 1894.jpg|thumb|Max Weber]]

===Ultimate End===
The Ultimate end is a concept in the moral philosophy of [[Max Weber]], in which individuals act in a faithful, rather than rational, manner.

{{quote|We must be clear about the fact that all ethically oriented conduct may be guided by one of two fundamentally differing and irreconcilably opposed maxims: conduct can be oriented to an &quot;ethic of ultimate ends&quot; or to an &quot;ethic of responsibility.&quot; This is not to say that an ethic of ultimate ends is identical with irresponsibility, or that an ethic of responsibility is identical with unprincipled opportunism. Naturally nobody says that. However, there is an abysmal contract between conduct that follows the maxim of an ethic of ultimate ends—that, is in religious terms, &quot;the Christian does rightly and leaves the results with the Lord&quot;—and conduct that follows the maxim of an ethic of responsibility, in which case one has to give an account of the foreseeable results of one's action.&quot;|||Max Weber|''Politics as a Vocation'',  1918}}

==Criticisms==
===General criticisms===
[[William Gass]] argues that moral theories such as consequentialism are unable to adequately explain why a morally wrong action is morally wrong. Gass uses the example of an &quot;obliging stranger&quot; who agrees to be baked in an oven. Gass claims that the rationale that any moral theory might attempt to give for this wrongness, e.g. it does not bring about good results, is simply absurd. According to Gass, it is wrong to bake a stranger, however obliging, and nothing more can or need be said about it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gass&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Gass, William H. | authorlink = William Gass | title = The Case of the Obliging Stranger | journal = The Philosophical Review | volume = 66 | pages = 193–204 | doi = 10.2307/2182374 | year = 1957 | url = http://jstor.org/stable/2182374 | issue = 2 | publisher = Duke University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. E. M. Anscombe]], whose previously mentioned paper coined the term &quot;consequentialism&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Anscombe&quot;/&gt; objects to consequentialism on the grounds that it does not provide guidance in what one ought to do, since the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined based on the consequences it produces. Furthermore, she argues that consequentialism since [[Henry Sidgwick]] denies that there is any distinction between consequences that are foreseen and those that are intended (see [[Principle of double effect]]). Finally, Anscombe objects to the very character of consequentialism itself insofar as it is concerned with determining the ''rightness'' and ''wrongness'' of actions. She argues that the distinction between ''right action'' and ''wrong action'' only makes sense within the framework of Judeo-Christian [[divine law]]—and, according to Anscombe, Judeo-Christian divine law is incompatible with consequentialism.

===Character-based criticisms===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:BernardWilliams.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bernard Williams]]]] --&gt;
[[Bernard Williams]] has argued that consequentialism is ''alienating'' because it requires moral agents to put too much distance between themselves and their own projects and commitments. Williams argues that consequentialism requires moral agents to take a strictly ''impersonal'' view of all actions, since it is only the consequences, and not who produces them, that is said to matter. Williams argues that this demands too much of moral agents—since (he claims) consequentialism demands that they be willing to sacrifice any and all personal projects and commitments in any given circumstance in order to pursue the most beneficent course of action possible. He argues further that consequentialism fails to make sense of intuitions that it ''can'' matter whether or not someone is ''personally'' the author of a particular consequence. For example, that having &quot;dirty hands&quot; by participating in a crime can matter, even if the crime would have been committed anyway, or would even have been worse, without the agent's participation. &lt;!-- This really needs a quick discussion of William's firing-squad example. Maybe I'll add this later; but I wouldn't mind if someone beat me to it, either. --&gt;

Some consequentialists—most notably [[Peter Railton]]—have attempted to develop a form of consequentialism that acknowledges and avoids the objections raised by Williams. Railton argues that Williams's criticisms can be avoided by adopting a form of consequentialism in which moral decisions are to be determined by the ''sort of life'' that they express. On his account, the agent should choose the sort of life that will, on the whole, produce the best overall effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheffler&quot;/&gt;

However, more recently, there have been attacks upon consequentialism in a similar vein. For example, [[Thomas Nagel]] holds that consequentialism fails to appropriately take into account the people affected by a particular action. He argues that a consequentialist cannot really criticize human rights abuses in a war, for example, if they ultimately result in a better state of affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheffler&quot;/&gt;

==Applications==
Consequentialist theory has a number of potential applications. For instance, Richard Mullender sees consequentialist theory as providing a rationale and foundation for a new understanding of [[social democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/1467-6478.00165 | author = Mullender, Richard | year = 2000 | title = Theorizing the Third Way: Qualified Consequentialism, the Proportionalty Principle and the New Social Democracy | url = | journal = Journal of Law and Society | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 493–516 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Page]] sees consequentialist theory as providing a rationale and foundation for [[peace education]].&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S.

{{conscription}}

'''Conscription''' is the compulsory enrollment of people to some sort of [[national service]], most often [[military service]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mw&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conscription |title=Conscription |publisher= Merriam-Webster Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names.  The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the [[French Revolution]] in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful [[military]]. Most [[Europe]]an nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1–3 years on [[active duty]], then transfer to the [[military reserve force|reserve force]]. 

Conscription can be controversial, because of [[conscientious objection]] to service, or political objection to service for a disliked government, or an unpopular war. Those conscripted may evade the draft, sometimes by leaving the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/war_conflict/vietnam_war/topics/348/ |title=Seeking Sanctuary: Draft Dodgers |newspaper= CBC Digital Archives }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some selection systems accommodate these situations by providing [[alternative service]] outside of typical [[combat]]-operations roles or even outside of the military, such as [[Zivildienst]] in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]].

As of the early 21st century, many nations no longer conscript soldiers, relying instead upon professional militaries with [[volunteer military|volunteers]] enlisted to meet the demand for troops.  The ability to rely on such an arrangement, however, presupposes some degree of predictability with regards to both war-fighting requirements and the scope of hostilities.  Many nations that have abolished conscription therefore still reserve the power to resume it during [[war]]time or times of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008717 |title=World War II |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], conscription, also called &quot;[[conscription in the United States|the draft]]&quot;, ended in 1973, but males between 18 and 25 are required to register with the [[Selective Service System]] to aid in resuming conscription.

==History==
===Ilkum===
Around the reign of [[Hammurabi]] (1792-1750 [[Before Common Era|BCE]]), the [[Babylonian Empire]] used a system of conscription called ''Ilkum''. Under the system those eligible were required to serve in the royal army in time of war.&lt;ref name=JN242 /&gt; During times of peace they were instead required to provide labour for other activities of the state.&lt;ref name=JN242 /&gt; In return for this service, those subject to it gained the right to hold land.&lt;ref name=JN242 /&gt; It is possible that this right was not to hold land per se but specific land supplied by the state.&lt;ref name=JN242&gt;{{Cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415110327 |page=242 |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various forms of avoiding military service are recorded. While it was outlawed by the [[Code of Hammurabi]], the hiring of substitutes appears to have been practiced both before and after the creation of the code.&lt;ref name=JN243 /&gt;  Later records show that Ilkum commitments could become regularly traded.&lt;ref name=JN243 /&gt;  In other places, people simply left their towns to avoid their Ilkum service.&lt;ref name=JN243 /&gt; Another option was to sell Ilkum lands and the commitments along with them. With the exception of a few exempted classes, this was forbidden by the Code of Hammurabi.&lt;ref name=JN243&gt;{{Cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415110327 |page=243 |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval levies===
{{Ref improve section|date=July 2010}}

Under the [[feudalism|feudal]] conditions for holding land in the medieval period, most [[peasants]] and [[Serfdom#Freemen|freemen]] were liable to provide one man of suitable age per family for military duty when required by either the king or the local lord.  The [[Conscription#Medieval levies|levies]] raised in this way fought as infantry under local superiors.  Although the exact laws varied greatly depending on the country and the period, generally these levies were only obliged to fight for one to three months.  Most were subsistence farmers, and it was in everyone's interest to send the men home for harvest-time.

In medieval [[Scandinavia]] the 'leiðangr' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]), 'leidang' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), 'leding', ([[Danish language|Danish]]), 'ledung' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), 'lichting' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), 'expeditio' ([[Latin]]) or sometimes 'lething' ([[English language|Old English]]), was a levy of free farmers conscripted into coastal fleets for seasonal excursions and in defence of the realm.

The bulk of the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon English]] army, called the [[Leidang#England|fyrd]], was composed of part-time English soldiers drawn from the landowning minor nobility. These [[thegn]]s were the land-holding aristocracy of the time and were required to serve with their own armour and weapons for a certain number of days each year. The historian David Sturdy has cautioned about regarding the ''fyrd'' as a precursor to a modern national army composed of all ranks of society, describing it as a &quot;ridiculous fantasy&quot;:&lt;blockquote&gt;The persistent old belief that peasants and small farmers gathered to form a national army or ''fyrd'' is a strange delusion dreamt up by antiquarians in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries to justify universal military conscription.&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, David ''Alfred the Great'' Constable (1995), p153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Military slavery===
The system of military [[slaves]] was widely used in the Middle East, beginning with the Egyptians training [[Mamluk]]s from the 9th century, to the Turks and [[Ottoman Empire]] through the 19th century.

In the middle of the 14th century, Ottoman Sultan [[Murad I]] developed personal troops to be loyal to him, with a slave army called the ''Kapıkulu''. The new force was built by taking Christian children from newly conquered lands, especially from the far areas of his empire, in a system known as the ''[[devşirme]]'' (translated &quot;gathering&quot; or &quot;converting&quot;).  The captive children were persuaded to convert to [[Islam]].  The Sultans had the young boys trained over several years.  Those who showed special promise in fighting skills were trained in advanced warrior skills, put into the sultan's personal service, and turned into the [[Janissary|Janissaries]], the elite branch of the ''Kapıkulu''. A number of distinguished military commanders of the Ottomans, and most of the imperial administrators and upper-level officials of the Empire, such as [[Pargalı İbrahim Pasha]] and [[Sokollu Mehmet Paşa]], were recruited in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Bernard Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher= Chapter readings for class at Fordham University }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1609 the Sultan's ''Kapıkulu'' forces increased to about 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html |title=In the Service of the State and Military Class }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In later years, Sultans turned to the [[Barbary Pirates]] to supply their Jannissaries corps.  Their attacks on ships off the coast of Africa or in the Mediterranean, and subsequent capture of able bodied men for ransom or sale provided some captives for the Sultan's system. Starting in the 17th century, Christian families living under the Ottoman rule began to submit their sons into the Kapikulu system willingly, as they saw this as a potentially invaluable career opportunity for their children. Eventually the Sultan turned to foreign volunteers from the warrior clans of [[Circassians]] in southern Russia to fill his Janissary armies.  As a whole the system began to break down, the loyalty of the Jannissaries became increasingly suspect. [[Mahmud II]] forcibly disbanded the Janissary corps in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-300350/Janissary |title= Janissary corps, or Janizary, or Yeniçeri (Turkish military) |publisher=[[Encyclopedia Britannica Online]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-cias.com/e.o/janissaries.htm Janissaries]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the Janissaries in origin and means of development were the Mamluks of Egypt in the [[Middle Ages]].  The [[Mamluks]] were usually captive non-Muslim Iranian and Turkish children who had been kidnapped or bought as slaves from the Barbary coasts.  The Egyptians assimilated and trained the boys and young men to become Islamic soldiers who served the Muslim [[caliph]]s and the [[Ayyubid]] sultans during the [[Middle Ages]].  The first mamluks served the [[Abbasid]] caliphs in 9th century [[Baghdad]]. Over time they became a powerful military [[caste]].  On more than one occasion, they seized power, for example, ruling [[Egypt]] from 1250–1517.

From 1250 [[Egypt]] had been ruled by the [[Bahri dynasty]] of [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] origin. Slaves from the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasus]] served in the army and formed an elite corp of troops.  They eventually revolted in Egypt to form the [[Burgi dynasty]].  The Mamluks' excellent fighting abilities, massed Islamic armies, and overwhelming numbers succeeded in overcoming the Christian [[Crusades|Crusader]] fortresses in the Holy Land.  The Mamluks were the most successful defense against the [[Ilkhanate|Mongol Ilkhanate]] of Persia and Iraq from entering Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/seerah/0075_popup11.htm |title=The Mamluk (Slave) Dynasty (Timeline) |newspaper=Sunnah Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the western coast of Africa, Berber Muslims captured non-Muslims to put to work as laborers.  They generally converted the younger people to Islam and many became quite assimilated.  In Morocco, the Berber looked south rather than north.  The Moroccan Sultan [[Moulay Ismail]], called  &quot;the Bloodthirsty&quot; (1672–1727), employed a corps of 150,000 black slaves, called his [[Black Guard]].  He used them to coerce the country into submission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher=Oxford University Press |year= 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invention of modern conscription===
Modern conscription, the massed military enlistment of national citizens (today recognized in the USA as &quot;the draft&quot;), was devised during the [[French Revolution]], to enable the [[French Republic|Republic]] to defend itself from the attacks of European monarchies.  Deputy [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]] gave its name to the September 5, 1798 Act, whose first article stated: &quot;Any Frenchman is a soldier and owes himself to the defense of the [[patriotism|nation]].&quot;  It enabled the creation of the ''[[Grande Armée]]'', what [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called &quot;the nation in arms,&quot; which overwhelmed European professional armies that often numbered only into the low tens of thousands.  More than 2.6 million men were inducted into the French military in this way between the years 1800 and 1813.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Conscription|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761561714/conscription.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwRJ8b4l|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the [[Prussian Army]] in particular shocked the Prussian establishment, which had believed it was invincible after the victories of [[Frederick the Great]].  The Prussians were used to relying on superior organization and tactical factors such as order of battle to focus superior troops against inferior ones.  Given approximately equivalent forces, as was generally the case with professional armies, these factors showed considerable importance.  However, they became considerably less important when the Prussian armies faced forces that outnumbered their own in some cases by more than ten to one.  [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] advocated adopting the ''[[levée en masse]]'', the military conscription used by France.  The ''Krümpersystem'' was the beginning of short-term compulsory service in Prussia, as opposed to the long-term conscription previously used.&lt;ref&gt;Dierk Walter. ''Preussische Heeresreformen 1807–1870: Militärische Innovation und der Mythos der &quot;Roonschen Reform&quot;''. 2003, in Citino, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Russian Empire]], the military service time &quot;owed&quot; by serfs was 25 years at the beginning of the 19th century.  In 1834 it was decreased to 20 years.  The recruits were to be not younger than 17 and not older than 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roots-saknes.lv/Army/military_service_.htm |title=Military service in Russia Empire |publisher=roots-saknes.lv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 Russia introduced universal conscription in the modern pattern, an innovation only made possible by the abolition of [[Serfdom in Russia|serfdom]] in 1861.  New military law decreed that all male Russian subjects, when they reached the age of 20, were eligible to serve in the military for six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/tcimo/tulp/Research/ARMING.htm  |title=Conscription and Resistance: The Historical Context archived from the original |date=2008-06-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080603141235/http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/tcimo/tulp/Research/ARMING.htm |archivedate = 2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Wars===
The range of eligible ages for conscripting was expanded to meet national demand during the World Wars.
In the United States, the [[Selective Service System]] drafted men for World War I initially in an age range from 21 to 30 but expanded its eligibility in 1918 to an age range of 18 to 45.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/163.html |title=Records of the Selective Service System (World War I) }}; see also [[Selective Service Act of 1917]] and [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of a widespread [[mobilization]] of forces where service includes homefront defense, ages of conscripts may range much higher, with the oldest conscripts serving in roles requiring lesser mobility.  Expanded-age conscription was common during the Second World War: in Britain, it was commonly known as &quot;call-up&quot; and extended to age 55. [[Nazi Germany]] termed it [[Volkssturm]] (&quot;People's Storm&quot;) and included men as young as 16 and as old as 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/volkssturm/index.html |title=The German Volkssturm from Intelligence Bulletin |date= February 1945 |publisher=lonesentry.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
{{main|Conscription in the United Kingdom}}
Britain introduced conscription for the first time in 1916-1920, and again 1939-1958.  In all, 8,000,000 men were drafted, as well as several hundred thousand women.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Broad, ''Conscription in Britain 1939-1964: The Militarization of a Generation'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  The introduction of conscription in April 1939, before the war began, was largely due to pressure from the French, who emphasized the need for a large British army to oppose the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Hucker, &quot;Franco-British Relations and the Question of Conscription in Britain, 1938-1939,&quot; ''Contemporary European History,'' Nov 2008, Vol. 17 Issue 4, pp 437-456&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in early 1942 unmarried women age 19-30 were conscripted.  Most were sent to the factories, but they could volunteer for the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) and other women's services.  None were assigned to combat roles unless they volunteered. By 1943 women were conscripted up to age 51. During the Second World War, 1.4 million British men volunteered  for service and 3.2 million were conscripted. Volunteers comprised 20% per cent of the Army, 40% of the Royal Navy, and 50% of the Royal Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy A. Crang, &quot;'Come into the Army, Maud': Women, Military Conscription, and the Markham Inquiry,&quot; ''Defence Studies,'' Nov 2008, Vol. 8 Issue 3, pp 381-395; statistics from pp 392-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Conscription in the United States}}

====Colonial and Early National====
In America before 1862, combat duty was always voluntary, but white men aged 18 to 45 were usually required to join local militia units. Colonial militia laws—and after 1776 those of the states—required able-bodied white men to enroll in the militia and to undergo a minimum of military training, all without pay.  Colonial Pennsylvania (controlled by [[Quakers]]) did not have such laws. Members of pacifist religious denominations were exempt.  When combat troops were needed some of the militiamen volunteered for short terms of service, for which they were paid. Following this system in its essentials, the Continental Congress in 1778 recommended that the states draft men from their militias for one year's service in the Continental army; this first national conscription was irregularly applied and failed to fill the Continental ranks. 

In 1814, President James Madison proposed conscription of 40,000 men for the army, but the War of 1812 ended before Congress took any action.
An 1840 proposal for a standing army of 200,000 men included conscription never passed and military service was voluntary before 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=United States. War Dept|author2=Joel Roberts Poinsett|title=Plan of the standing army of 200,000 men: submitted to Congress by the Secretary of War, and recommended by the President of the United States|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Kep-lXNM2uIC|year=1840|publisher=s.n.|pages=[http://books.google.com/books?id=Kep-lXNM2uIC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8 8]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil War====
Although both North and South resorted to conscription during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], in neither nation did the system work effectively. The Confederate congress on Apr. 16, 1862, passed an act requiring military service for three years from all males aged eighteen to thirty-five not legally exempt, and it later extended the obligation. The U.S. Congress followed on July 17, 1862, with an act authorizing a militia draft within a state when it could not meet its quota with volunteers. This state-administered system failed in practice and on Mar. 3, 1863, Congress passed the first genuine national conscription law, setting up under the Union army an elaborate machinery for enrolling and drafting men between twenty and forty-five years of age.

Quotas were assigned in each state, the deficiencies in volunteers to be met by conscription. But men drafted could provide substitutes or, until mid-1864, avoid service by paying commutation money. Many eligibles pooled their money to cover the cost of anyone drafted.  Families used the substitute provision to select which man should go into the army and which should stay home. There was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft, especially in Catholic areas. The great [[New York Draft Riots|draft riot in New York City in July 1863]] involved Irish immigrants who had been signed up as citizens to swell the machine vote, not realizing it made them liable for the draft. Of the 168,649 men procured for the Union through the draft, 117,986 were substitutes, leaving only 50,663 who had their personal services conscripted.

The problem of Confederate desertion was aggravated by the inequitable inclinations of conscription officers and local judges. The three conscription acts of the Confederacy exempted certain categories, most notably the planter class, and enrolling officers and local judges often practiced favoritism, sometimes accepting bribes. Attempts to effectively deal with the issue were frustrated by conflict between state and local governments on the one hand and the national government of the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;* Albert Burton Moore. ''Conscription and Conflict in the Confederacy'' 1924 [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=10517499 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

====World War I====
{{Main|Selective Service Act of 1917}}
[[Image:King, Stoddard WW1 draft card.jpg|right|thumb|A World War I era draft card.]]
In 1917 the administration of [[Woodrow Wilson]] decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for World War I.  The [[Selective Service Act of 1917]] was carefully drawn to remedy the defects in the Civil War system and—by allowing exemptions for dependency, essential occupations, and religious scruples—to place each man in his proper niche in a national war effort. The act established a &quot;liability for military service of all male citizens&quot;; authorized a selective draft of all those between twenty-one and thirty-one years of age (later from eighteen to forty-five); and prohibited all forms of bounties, substitutions, or purchase of exemptions. Administration was entrusted to local boards composed of leading civilians in each community. These boards issued draft calls in order of numbers drawn in a national lottery and determined exemptions. In 1917 and 1918 some 24 million men were registered and nearly 3 million inducted into the military services, with little of the resistance that characterized the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;John Whiteclay Chambers II, ''To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:U.S. draft lottery.jpg|180px|left|thumb| Secretary of War Newton Baker draws the first draft number on 20 July 1917.]]

====World War II====
In 1940  Congress passed the first peace-time [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] legislation, which was led by [[Grenville Clark]]. It was renewed (by one vote) in summer 1941. It involved questions as to who should control the draft, the size of the army, and the need for deferments. The system worked through local draft boards comprising community leaders who were given quotas and then decided how to fill them. There was very little draft resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

The nation went from a surplus manpower pool with high unemployment and relief in 1940 to a severe manpower shortage by 1943. Industry realized that the Army urgently desired production of essential war materials and foodstuffs more than soldiers. (Large numbers of soldiers were not used until the invasion of Europe in summer 1944.) In 1940-43 the Army often transferred soldiers to civilian status in the Enlisted Reserve Corps in order to increase production. Those transferred would return to work in essential industry, although they could be called back to active duty if the Army needed them. Others were discharged if their civilian work was deemed absolutely essential. There were instances of mass releases of men to increase production in various industries. Blacks and Asians were drafted under the same terms as whites. There was talk of a draft of women nurses in 1945, but nothing came of it.

One contentious issue involved the drafting of fathers, which was avoided as much as possible. The drafting of 18-year olds was desired by the military but vetoed by public opinion.  Farmers demanded and were generally given occupational deferments (many volunteered anyway, but those who stayed at home lost postwar veteran's benefits.)

Later in the war, in light of the tremendous amount of manpower that would be necessary for the invasion of France, many earlier deferment categories became draft eligible.&lt;ref&gt;George Q. Flynn, ''The Draft, 1940-1973'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recent====
On July 15, 2010, Congressman [[Charles B. Rangel]], a [[Korean War]] veteran, introduced [[Universal National Service Act#Universal National Service Act of 2010|H.R. 5741]] which if passed would &quot;require all persons in the United States between the ages of 18 and 42 to perform national service, either as a member of the uniformed services or in civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland security.&quot;

==Conscientious objection==
{{Main|Conscientious objection|Antimilitarism|Conscientious objection throughout the world}}
A [[conscientious objector]] is an individual whose personal beliefs are incompatible with [[Armed forces|military service]], or sometimes with any role in the armed forces. In some countries, conscientious objectors have special legal status, which augments their conscription duties. For example, Sweden used to allow conscientious objectors to choose a service in the &quot;weapons-free&quot; branch, such as an airport fireman, nurse or telecommunications technician.

Some may also refuse such service as they feel that they still are a part of the military complex. The reasons for refusing to serve are varied. Some conscientious objectors are so for religious reasons — notably, the members of the historic [[peace churches]] are [[pacifism|pacifist]] by doctrine, and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], while not strictly speaking pacifists, refuse to participate in the armed services on the grounds that they believe Christians should be neutral in worldly conflicts.

==Evading the draft==
{{Globalize/USA|date=August 2010}}
{{Main|Draft dodger}}
Historically, there has been resistance to conscription in almost every country and situation where it has been imposed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The [[New York Draft Riots]] (July 11 to July 16, 1863; known at the time as ''Draft Week''), were violent disturbances in New York City that were the culmination of discontent with new laws passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] to [[Conscription in the United States#Early drafts|draft]] men to fight in the ongoing [[American Civil War]]. The [[Central Asian Revolt]] started in the summer of 1916, when the [[Russian Empire]] government ended its exemption of Muslims from military service. The conscription also became unpopular in [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] during the reign of [[Nicholas II]] and was suspended; instead Finland paid a levy tax, &quot;military millions&quot; as compensation for abolition of conscription.

In the USA and some other countries, the [[Vietnam War]] saw new levels of opposition to conscription and the [[Selective Service System]]. Many people opposed to and facing conscription chose to either apply for classification and assignment to civilian alternative service or noncombatant service within the military as conscientious objectors, or to evade the draft by fleeing to a neutral country. A small proportion, like [[Muhammad Ali]], chose to resist the draft by publicly and politically fighting conscription. Some people resist at the point of registration for the draft. In the USA since 1980, for example, the draft resistance movement has focused on mandatory draft registration. Others resist at the point of induction, when they are ordered to put on a uniform, when they are ordered to carry or use a weapon, or when they are ordered into combat.

In the United States, especially during the Vietnam Era, some used political connections to ensure that they were placed well away from any potential harm, serving in what was termed a [[Champagne unit]]. Many would avoid military service altogether through college deferments, by becoming fathers, or serving in various exempt jobs (teaching was one possibility). Others used educational exemptions, became conscientious objectors or pretended to be conscientious objectors, although they might then be drafted for non-combat work, such as serving as a [[combat medic]]. It was also possible they could be asked to do similar civilian work, such as being a hospital orderly.

It was, in fact, quite easy for those with some knowledge of the system to avoid being drafted. A simple route, widely publicized, was to get a medical rejection. While a person could claim to have symptoms (or feign [[homosexuality]]) if enough physicians sent letters that a person had a problem, he might well be rejected. It often wasn't worth the Army's time to dispute this claim. Such an approach worked best in a larger city where there was no stigma to not serving, and the potential draftee was not known to those reviewing him.

For others, the most common method of avoiding the draft was to cross the border into another country. People who have been &quot;called up&quot; for military service and who attempted to avoid it in some way were known as &quot;draft-dodgers&quot;. Particularly during the Vietnam War, US draft-dodgers usually made their way to Canada, Mexico or Sweden.

Many people looked upon draft-dodgers with scorn as being &quot;cowards&quot;, but some supported them in their efforts. In the late years of the [[Vietnam War]], objections against it and support for draft-dodgers was much more outspoken, because of the casualties suffered by American troops, and the actual cause and purpose of the war being heavily questioned.

Toward the end of the US draft, an attempt was made to make the system somewhat fairer by turning it into a lottery, with each of the year's calendar dates randomly assigned a number. Men born on lower numbered dates were called up for review. For the reasons given above, this did not make the system any fairer, and the entire system ended in 1973. Today, American men 18-25 are required to register with the government, but there has not been a callup since the Vietnam Era.

There are those who are immune to the draft in certain countries;  these people include anyone{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} who works for the government (teachers, police officers, lawmakers, etc.), people who work for [[government contractor]]s, and those who work in jobs essential to the operation of the country (waste management, power plants, etc.). In the United Kingdom this is known as a [[reserved occupation]] which is deemed necessary to the survival of the nation.

In Israel, the Muslim and Christian Arab minority are exempt from mandatory service, as are permanent residents such as the [[Druze]] of the Golan Heights. Male Ultra-Orthodox Jews may apply for a deferment of draft to study in [[Yeshiva]], but once they are finished studying, they are required to do national or army service, while female ultra-orthodox and religious Jews are exempt after presenting &quot;religious Declaration&quot; to the IDF authorities, and many of them choose to volunteer for national service Instead. Male [[Druze]] and [[Circassians|Circassian]] Israeli citizens are liable, by agreement with their community leaders (Female Druze and Circassian are exempt from service).  Members of the exempted groups can still volunteer, but very few do, except for the Bedouin where a relatively large number have tended to volunteer (usually for financial reasons).

==Arguments against conscription==
===Slavery===
Some American [[libertarians]] oppose it because, as Rep. [[Ron Paul]] says, since &quot;Conscription is wrongly associated with patriotism, when it really represents Slavery and involuntary servitude.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Representative [[Ron Paul]] [http://antiwar.com/paul/?articleid=5651 Conscription Is Slavery], antiwar.com, January 14, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, a number of radicals and anarchists, including [[Emma Goldman]], challenged the new draft law in federal court arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude.  However the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the case of Arver v. United States on January 7, 1918.  The decision said the Constitution gave Congress the power to declare war and to raise and support armies.  The Court emphasized the principle of the reciprocal rights and duties of citizens:
:&quot;It may not be doubted that the very conception of a just government in its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need and the right to compel.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;John Whiteclay Chambers II, ''To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America'' (1987) p 219-20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
It can be argued that in a cost-to-benefit ratio, conscription during peace time is not worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, David R. &quot;[http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-2-issue-2-august-2005 The Role of Economists in Ending the Draft]&quot; (August 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Months or years of service amongst the most fit and capable subtracts from the productivity of the economy; add to this the cost of training them, and in some countries paying them. Compared to these extensive costs, some would argue there is very little benefit; if there ever was a war then conscription and basic training could be completed quickly, and in any case there is little threat of a war in most countries with conscription. In the United States, every male resident must register with the [[Selective Service System]]  on his 18th birthday, so he is available for a draft.

The cost of conscription can be related to the [[parable of the broken window]]. The cost of the work—in this case military service—does not disappear even if no salary is paid. The work effort of the conscripts is effectively wasted, as an unwilling workforce is extremely inefficient. The impact is especially severe in wartime, when civilian professionals are forced to fight as amateur soldiers. Not only is the work effort of the conscripts wasted and productivity lost, but professionally-skilled conscripts are also difficult to replace in the civilian workforce. Every soldier conscripted in the army is taken away from his civilian work, and away from contributing to the economy which funds the military. This is not a problem in an agrarian or pre-industrialized state where the level of education is universally low, and where a worker is easily replaced by another. However, this proves extremely problematic in a [[post-industrial society]] where educational levels are high and where the workforce is highly sophisticated and a replacement for a conscripted specialist is difficult to find. Even direr economic consequences result if the professional conscripted as an amateur soldier is killed or maimed for life; his work effort and productivity is irrevocably lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2136&amp;chapter=195469&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27#c_NIR_1360-016_footnote_nt1046 |title=Why Not a Volunteer Army? |accessdate=9 11 2008 |author=[[Milton Friedman]] |year=1967 |work=New Individualist Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for conscription==
===Political and moral motives===
{{See|Social contract|Social solidarity|Means of protection|Active citizenship}}
[[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] argued vehemently against professional armies, feeling it was the right and privilege of every citizen to participate to the defense of the whole society and a mark of moral decline to leave this business to professionals. He based this view on the development of the [[Roman republic]], which came to an end at the same time as the Roman army changed from a conscript to professional force.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Social Contract|Rousseau, J-J. Social Contract.]] Chapter &quot;The Roman Comitia&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Aristotle]] linked the division of armed service among the populace intimately with the political order of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Politics (Aristotle)/Book 6|Aristotle, Politics, Book 6]] Chapter VII and [[s:Politics (Aristotle)/Book 4|Book 4]] Chapter XIII.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] argued strongly for conscription, seeing the professional armies as the cause of the failure of societal unity in Italy.

Other proponents such as the late [[William James]] consider both mandatory military and [[national service]] as ways of instilling maturity in young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/wj/meow.htm |title=The Moral Equivalent of War |author= William James |year=1906 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some proponents such as [[Jonathan Alter]] and [[Mickey Kaus]] support a draft in order to reinforce social equality, create social consciousness, break down class divisions and for have young adults to immerse themselves in public enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/1995/07/30/cop-out-on-class.html |title=Cop Out on Class |first=Jonathan |last=Alter |newspaper=Newsweek }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/03/12/interview_with_mickey_kaus_104743.html |title=Interview with Mickey Kaus |publisher=realclearpolitics.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reason.com/archives/1995/10/01/overcoming-merit |title=Overcoming Merit |first=Virginia |last=Postrel |authorlink=Virginia Postrel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic &amp; resource efficiency===
{{See|Industrial warfare|Total war|War effort}}
It is estimated by the British military that in a professional military, one company deployed for active duty in peacekeeping corresponds to three inactive companies at home. Salaries for each are paid from the military budget. In contrast, volunteers from a trained reserve are in their civilian jobs when they are not deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''Catherine Grace &quot;Cady&quot; Coleman''' (born December 14, 1960) is an [[United States|American]] [[chemist]], a former [[United States Air Force]] officer, and a current [[NASA]] [[astronaut]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA bio&quot;&gt;[http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/coleman.html NASA biography]&lt;/ref&gt; She is a veteran of two [[Space Shuttle]] missions, and departed the [[International Space Station]] on May 23, 2011 as a crew member of [[Expedition 27]] after logging 159 days in space.

==Education==
Coleman graduated from [[W.T. Woodson High School]], [[Fairfax, Virginia]], in 1978;&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA bio&quot;/&gt; in 1978–1979 she was an exchange student at [[Røyken]] upper secondary school in Norway with the [[AFS Intercultural Programs]]. She received a bachelor of science degree in [[chemistry]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1983, and a doctorate in polymer science and engineering from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA bio&quot;/&gt; as a member of the US Air Force [[ROTC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;preflight&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Preflight Interview: Catherine Coleman|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition26/coleman_interview.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 December 2010|date=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a member of the intercollegiate [[Rowing (sport)|crew]] and was a resident of [[List_of_MIT_undergraduate_dormitories#Baker_House|Baker House]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Military career==
After completing her regular education, Coleman joined the Air Force as a second lieutenant while continuing her graduate work for a Ph.D. at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. In 1988 she entered active duty at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] as a research chemist. During her work she participated as a surface analysis consultant on the NASA [[Long Duration Exposure Facility]] experiment. In 1991 she received her [[doctorate]] in [[polymer science]] and engineering.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA bio&quot;/&gt; She retired from the Air Force in November 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA bio&quot;/&gt;

==NASA career==
[[File:Cady Coleman stamp.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Coleman on 1995 [[Azerbaijan|Azeri]] postage stamp.]]
Coleman was selected by NASA in 1992 to join the [[NASA Astronaut Corps]]. In 1995 she was a member of the [[STS-73]] crew on the scientific mission USML-1 with experiments including [[biotechnology]], combustion science and the [[physics]] of [[fluids]]. During the flight, she reported to [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Houston Mission Control]] that she had spotted an [[UFO|unidentified flying object]]. She also trained for the mission [[STS-83]] to be the backup for [[Donald A. Thomas]]; however, as he recovered on time, she did not fly that mission. [[STS-93]] was Coleman's second space flight in 1999. She was mission specialist in charge of deploying the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and its [[Inertial Upper Stage]] out of the shuttle's cargo bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA bio&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Valentina Tereshkova and Catherine Coleman.jpg|right|thumb| Catherine Coleman and [[Valentina Tereshkova]] at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in December 2010.]]

Coleman served as Chief of Robotics for the Astronaut Office, to include [[Mobile Servicing System|robotic arm]] operations and training for all Space Shuttle and [[International Space Station]] missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA bio&quot;/&gt;

Coleman was assigned as a backup U.S. crew member for Expeditions 19, 20 and 21 and served as a backup crewmember for Expeditions 24 and 25 as part of her training for Expedition 26.

Coleman launched on December 15, 2010 (Dec. 16 Baikonur time) aboard [[Soyuz TMA-20]] to join the [[Expedition 26]] mission aboard the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/nov/HQ_M10-164A_Soyuz_Update.html NASA Television Will Air Next Soyuz Landing And Launch] - Media Advisory : M10-164A - November 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spaceflight experience===
STS-73 on Columbia (October 20 to November 5, 1995) was the second United States Microgravity Laboratory mission. The mission focused on materials science, biotechnology, combustion science, the physics of fluids, and numerous scientific experiments housed in the pressurized Spacelab module. In completing her first space flight, Coleman orbited the Earth 256 times, traveled over 6 million miles, and logged a total of 15 days, 21 hours, 52 minutes and 21 seconds in space.

[[File:ISS27_Catherine_Coleman_plays_a_flute.jpg|right|thumb|Cady Coleman plays a flute inside the International Space Station.]]

STS-93 on Columbia (July 22 to 27, 1999) was a five-day mission during which Coleman was the lead mission specialist for the deployment of the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. Designed to conduct comprehensive studies of the universe, the telescope will enable scientists to study exotic phenomena such as exploding stars, quasars, and black holes. Mission duration was 118 hours and 50 minutes.

Soyuz TMA-20 / Expedition 26/27 (December 15, 2010 to May 23, 2011) was a extended duration mission to the International Space Station.

==Personal==
Coleman is married to [[glass art]]ist Josh Simpson&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA bio&quot;/&gt; who lives in Massachusetts. They have one son. She is also part of the band Bandella, which also includes fellow NASA astronaut [[Stephen Robinson|Steven Robinson]], Canadian astronaut [[Chris Hadfield]], and Micki Pettit (astronaut [[Don Pettit]]'s wife). Coleman is a [[flute]] player and has taken several flutes with her to the ISS, including a [[pennywhistle]] from [[Paddy Moloney]] of [[The Chieftains]], an old Irish flute from [[Matt Molloy]] of The Chieftains, and a flute from [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]] of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]. On February 15, 2011, she played one of the instruments live from orbit on [[National Public Radio]].&lt;ref name=NPR20110217&gt;{{cite web|title=Flutes In Space: Astronaut Plays Aboard Space Station|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/02/15/133780067/flutes-in-space-astronaut-plays-aboard-space-station|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 12, 2011 Catherine played live through video link for the audience of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]'s show in Russia in honour of the 50th anniversary of [[Gagarin]]'s flight. She played the duet from orbit while Anderson played on the ground in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space flutes salute Yuri Gagarin|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/12/space_flutes/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''cervix''' (or '''neck of the uterus''') is the lower, narrow portion of the [[uterus]] where it joins with the top end of the [[vagina]]. It is cylindrical or conical in shape and protrudes through the upper anterior vaginal wall. Approximately half its length is visible with appropriate medical equipment; the remainder lies above the vagina beyond view. It is occasionally called &quot;cervix uteri&quot;. Cervix means ''neck'' in Latin.

==Anatomy==
[[Image:Cervix2.jpg|thumb|The cervix]]

===Ectocervix===
The portion projecting into the vagina is referred to as the [[Vaginal portion of cervix|''portio vaginalis'']] or ectocervix. On average, the ectocervix is 3&amp;nbsp;cm long and 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm wide. It has a convex, elliptical surface and is divided into anterior and posterior lips.

====External os====

{{Main|External orifice of the uterus}}
The ectocervix's opening is called the [[External orifice of the uterus|external os]]. The size and shape of the external os and the ectocervix varies widely with age, hormonal state, and whether the woman has had a vaginal birth. In women who have not had a vaginal birth the external os appears as a small, circular opening. In women who have had a vaginal birth, the ectocervix appears bulkier and the external os appears wider, more slit-like and gaping.

===Endocervical canal===
The passageway between the external os and the uterine cavity is referred to as the [[Canal of the cervix|endocervical canal]]. It varies widely in length and width, along with the cervix overall. Flattened anterior to posterior, the endocervical canal measures 7 to 8&amp;nbsp;mm at its widest in reproductive-aged women.

===Internal os===
The endocervical canal terminates at the [[Internal orifice of the uterus|internal os]] which is the opening of the cervix inside the uterine cavity.

==Histology==
The [[epithelium]] of the cervix is varied.
The ectocervix (more distal, by the vagina) is composed of nonkeratinized [[stratified squamous epithelium]].
The endocervix (more proximal, within the uterus) is composed of [[simple columnar epithelium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{BUHistology|19404loa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area adjacent to the border of the endocervix and ectocervix is known as the [[transformation zone]]. The Transformation zone undergoes [[metaplasia]] numerous times during normal life. When the endocervix is exposed to the harsh acidic environment of the vagina it undergoes [[metaplasia]] to squamous epithelium which is better suited to the vaginal environment. Similarly when the ectocervix enters the less harsh uterine area it undergoes [[metaplasia]] to become columnar epithelium.

Times in life when this [[metaplasia]] of the transformation zone occurs:
* puberty; when the endocervix everts (moves out) of the uterus
* with the changes of the cervix associated with the normal menstrual cycle
* post-menopause; the uterus shrinks moving the transformation zone upwards

All these changes are normal and the occurrence is said to be [[physiological]].

However, all this metaplasia does increase the risk of cancer in this area - the transformation zone is the most common area for cervical cancer to occur.

At certain times of life, the columnar epithelium is replaced by metaplastic squamous epithelium, and is then known as the transformation zone.

[[Nabothian cyst]]s are often found in the cervix.&lt;ref&gt;Weschler, pp. 227–228.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cervical mucus==
[[Image:Gray34.png|thumb|Mucus plug]]

Cervical Mucus is 90% water.  Depending on the water content which varies during the menstrual cycle the mucus functions as a barrier or a transport medium to spermatoza. Cervical mucus also contains electrolytes (calcium, sodium and potassium), organic components such as glucose, amino acids and soluble proteins. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/reprint/60/1/17.pdf, Electrolytes in vaginal fluid during the menstrual cycle of coitally active and inactive women, G. Wagner and R. J. Levin &lt;/ref&gt;

Cervical mucus contains trace elements including zinc, copper, iron, mangenese and selenium, the levels of which vary dependant on cyclical hormone variation during different phases of the menstrual cycle &lt;ref&gt;Hagenfeldt et al., 1973;Pandey et al., 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Various enzymes have been identified in human cervical mucus. Glycerol is a natural ingredient of human cervical fluid. &lt;ref&gt;Volatile constituents of human vaginal secretions. Authors: George Huggins and George Preti (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine). Am J Obstet Gynecol, 1976 Sep 1;126(1):129-36.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Alterations in the organic compounds of vaginal secretions caused by sexual arousal. Authors: George Preti, George Huggins and Geoffrey Silverberg (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine). Fertil Steril 1979;32:47–54.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Vaginal odors and secretions. Authors: George Huggins and George Preti (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine). Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology, 1981; 24; 355-377.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;A vaginal fluid simulant. Authors: Derek Owen and David Katz (Duke University). Contraception, 1999 Feb;59(2):91-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that the amount of glycerol in cervical fluid increases during sexual excitement &lt;ref&gt;Alterations in the organic compounds of vaginal secretions caused by sexual arousal. Authors: George Preti, George Huggins and Geoffrey Silverberg (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine). Fertil Steril 1979;32:47–54.&lt;/ref&gt;. This increase in glycerol has been postulated to be responsible for the lubricating quality of this fertile cervical fluid and may be biologically relevant during the early phase of reproductive events.

After a [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual period]] ends, the external os is blocked by [[mucus]] that is thick and acidic.  This &quot;infertile&quot; mucus blocks spermatozoa from entering the [[uterus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ann Westinore; Evelyn, Dr Billings |title=The Billings Method: Controlling Fertility Without Drugs or Devices |publisher=Life Cycle Books |location=Toronto |year=1998 |pages=37 |isbn=0-919225-17-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For several days around the time of [[ovulation]], &quot;fertile&quot; types of mucus are produced: they have a higher water content, are less acidic, and have a ferning pattern that helps guide [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] through the cervix.&lt;ref name=&quot;w59&quot;&gt;Weschler, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; This ferning is a branching pattern seen in the mucus when observed with low magnification.

Some methods of [[fertility awareness]] involve estimating a woman's periods of fertility and infertility by observing changes in her body.  Among these changes are several involving the quality of her cervical mucus: the sensation it causes at the vulva, its elasticity ([[Spinnbarkeit]]), its transparency, and the presence of ''ferning''.&lt;ref name=&quot;w59&quot;&gt;Weschler, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most methods of [[hormonal contraception]] work primarily by preventing ovulation, but their effectiveness is increased because they prevent the fertile types of cervical mucus from being produced.  Conversely, methods of thinning the mucus may help to achieve pregnancy.  One suggested method is to take [[guaifenesin]] in the few days before ovulation.&lt;ref&gt;Weschler, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

During pregnancy the cervix is blocked by a special antibacterial [[Cervical mucus plug|mucosal plug]] which prevents infection, somewhat similar to its state during the infertile portion of the [[menstrual cycle]].&lt;!-- is it the same, or not? --&gt; The mucus plug comes out as the cervix dilates in labor or shortly before.

==Cervical position==
After menstruation and directly under the influence of [[estrogen]], the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, like the tip of the nose, and is positioned low and closed.  However, as a woman approaches ovulation, the cervix becomes softer, and rises and opens in response to the high levels of estrogen present at ovulation.&lt;ref name =&quot;Weschler&quot;&gt;Weschler, Toni, MPH, ''Taking Charge of Your Fertility'', Second Edition, 2002, pp. 59, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;  These changes, accompanied by the production of fertile types of cervical mucus, support the survival and movement of sperm.

==Function==
During [[menstruation]] the cervix stretches open slightly to allow the [[endometrium]] to be shed. This stretching is believed to be part of the [[cramp]]ing pain that many women experience. Evidence for this is given by the fact that some women's cramps subside or disappear after their first vaginal birth because the cervical opening has widened.  During [[childbirth]], contractions of the uterus will [[cervical dilation|dilate the cervix]] up to 10&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter to allow the child to pass through.

During [[orgasm]], the cervix convulses and the [[external os]] dilates. Robin Baker and Mark A. Bellis, both at the [[University of Manchester]], first proposed that this behavior would tend to draw [[semen]] in the [[vagina]] into the [[uterus]], increasing the likelihood of [[Conception (biology)|conception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Singh D, Meyer W, Zambarano RJ, Hurlbert DF |title=Frequency and timing of coital orgasm in women desirous of becoming pregnant |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=15–29 |year=1998 |month=February |pmid=9494687 |doi=10.1023/A:1018653724159}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This explanation has been called the &quot;upsuck theory of female orgasm.&quot; Komisaruk, Whipple, and Beyer-Flores, in their book, The Science of Orgasm, claimed there is evidence in support of the upsuck theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Whipple, Beverly; Komisaruk, Barry R.; Beyer, Carlos; Carlos Beyer-Flores |title=The science of orgasm |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-8018-8490-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science historian [[Elisabeth Lloyd]], author of ''The Case of the Female Orgasm'', questioned the logic of this theory and the quality of the experimental data used to back it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lloyd, Elisabeth Anne |title=The Case of the Female Orgasm: Bias in the Science of Evolution |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-674-02246-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; commenting in 2005: &quot;[The upsuck theory] has been widely accepted in the community of scientists for the past 12 years... But unfortunately the evidence for it is really badly flawed. In one of their tables 73% of the data came from one woman. It's really quite shocking that for 12 years this research has been taught as &quot;fact&quot; all across the US, Canada and the UK.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2005/sep/26/genderissues.technology | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The ideas interview: Elisabeth Lloyd | date=2005-09-26 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cervical cancer==

{{Main|Cervical cancer}}

[[Human papillomavirus]] (HPV) infection is a necessary factor in the development of nearly all cases of cervical cancer.  [[HPV vaccine]]s can reduce the chance of developing cervical cancer, if administered before initiation of sexual activity.  Potentially pre-cancerous changes in the cervix can be detected by a [[Pap smear]], in which [[epithelium|epithelial]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] are scraped from the surface of the cervix and [[cytopathology|examined under a microscope]].  With appropriate treatment of detected abnormalities, cervical cancer can be prevented.  Most women who develop cervical cancer have never had a Pap smear, or have not had one within the last five years.

Worldwide, cervical cancer is the fifth most deadly cancer in women.&lt;ref name=&quot;who fact sheet&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=[[World Health Organization]] |month=February |year=2006 |title=Fact sheet No. 297: Cancer |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/index.html |accessdate=2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It affects about 16 per 100,000 women per year and kills about 9 per 100,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= GLOBOCAN 2002 database: summary table by cancer | url=http://www-dep.iarc.fr/GLOBOCAN/Table1_sel1.htm|accessdate=2008-10-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080616085344/http://www-dep.iarc.fr/GLOBOCAN/Table1_sel1.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pap smear screening has greatly reduced cervical cancer incidence and mortality in nations with regular screening programs.

==Lymphatic drainage==
The [[Lymphatic system|lymphatic drainage]] of the cervix is along the [[uterine artery|uterine arteries]] and cardinal [[ligament]]s to the parametrial, [[external iliac vein]], [[internal iliac vein]], and [[obturator]] and presacral [[lymph node]]s. From these pelvic lymph nodes, drainage then proceeds to the [[paraaortic lymph node]]s. In some women, the lymphatics drain directly to the paraaortic nodes.

==Sexual response==
Some women report that stimulation of the cervix during [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] is very painful and results in a sensation similar to being kicked in the [[stomach]]. However, there are reports of women achieving intense [[orgasm]]s as a result of stimulation of certain parts of the cervix. One area in particular, a ring-like structure that encircles the cervix, which is said to have a texture similar to the back of a [[Frisbee]], has been reported to be highly [[erogenous zone|erogenous]]. This area, in a [[human sexuality|sexual]] context, is sometimes referred to as the '''Deep spot''' (in common with both the [[AFE zone]] and the [[Rectouterine pouch]]) or the '''Frisbee'''.

[[Image:Compiler.svg|right|thumb|350px|A diagram of the operation of a typical multi-language, multi-target compiler.]]

A '''compiler''' is a  [[computer program]] (or set of programs) that transforms [[source code]] written in a [[programming language]] (the ''source language'') into another computer language (the ''target language'', often having a binary form known as ''[[object code]]'').  The most common reason for wanting to transform source code is to create an [[executable]] program.

The name &quot;compiler&quot; is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a [[high-level programming language]] to a lower level language (e.g., [[assembly language]] or [[machine code]]). If the compiled program can run on a computer whose [[CPU]] or [[operating system]] is different from the one on which the compiler runs, the compiler is known as a [[cross-compiler]]. A program that translates from a low level language to a higher level one is a ''[[decompiler]]''.  A program that translates between high-level languages is usually called a ''[[translator (computing)|language translator]]'', ''source to source translator'', or ''language converter''. A ''language [[rewriting|rewriter]]'' is usually a program that translates the form of expressions without a change of language.

A compiler is likely to perform many or all of the following operations: [[lexical analysis]], [[preprocessing]], [[parsing]], semantic analysis ([[Syntax-directed translation]]), [[code generation (compiler)|code generation]], and [[code optimization]].

Program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very difficult to track down and work around; therefore, compiler implementors invest a lot of time ensuring the [[compiler correctness|correctness of their software]].

The term [[compiler-compiler]] is sometimes used to refer to a [[parser generator]], a tool often used to help create the [[lexical analysis|lexer]] and [[parser]].

==History==
{{Main|History of compiler construction}}
Software for early computers was primarily written in assembly language for many years. Higher level programming languages were not invented until the benefits of being able to reuse software on different kinds of [[CPU]]s started to become significantly greater than the cost of writing a compiler.  The very limited [[Computer storage|memory]] capacity of early computers also created many technical problems when implementing a compiler.

Towards the end of the 1950s, machine-independent programming languages were first proposed. Subsequently, several experimental compilers were developed. The first compiler was written by [[Grace Hopper]], in 1952, for the [[A-0 programming language]]. The [[FORTRAN]]&lt;!-- ###here (only), upper-case FORTRAN is correct, as it was the name used at the time, and on IBM's early compilers ###--&gt; team led by [[John Backus]] at [[IBM]] is generally credited as having introduced the first complete compiler in 1957. [[COBOL]] was an early language to be compiled on multiple architectures, in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/199706/msg00011.html |title=IP: The World's First COBOL Compilers |date=12 June 1997 |publisher=interesting-people.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many application domains the idea of using a higher level language quickly caught on.  Because of the expanding functionality supported by newer [[programming language]]s and the increasing complexity of computer architectures, compilers have become more and more complex.

Early compilers were written in assembly language. The first ''[[self-hosting]]'' compiler &amp;mdash; capable of compiling its own source code in a high-level language &amp;mdash; was created for [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] by Tim Hart and Mike Levin at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-039.pdf |author=T. Hart and M. Levin |title=The New Compiler, AIM-39 - CSAIL Digital Archive - Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Series |publisher=publications.ai.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s it has become common practice to implement a compiler in the language it compiles, although both [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and [[C (programming language)|C]] have been popular choices for implementation language. Building a self-hosting compiler is a [[bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]] problem—the first such compiler for a language must be compiled either by a compiler written in a different language, or (as in Hart and Levin's Lisp compiler) compiled by running the compiler in an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].

=== Compilers in education ===
Compiler construction and [[compiler optimization]] are taught at universities and schools as part of the [[computer science]] curriculum. Such courses are usually supplemented with the implementation of a compiler for an [[educational programming language]]. A well-documented example is [[Niklaus Wirth]]'s [[PL/0]] compiler, which Wirth used to teach compiler construction in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.246.dk/pl0.html |title=The PL/0 compiler/interpreter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of its simplicity, the PL/0 compiler introduced several influential concepts to the field:

# Program development by stepwise refinement (also the title of a 1971 paper by Wirth)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acm.org/classics/dec95/ |title=The ACM Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The use of a [[recursive descent parser]]
# The use of [[EBNF]] to specify the syntax of a language
# A [[code generation (compiler)|code generator]] producing portable [[P-code]]
# The use of [[T-diagram]]s&lt;ref&gt;T diagrams were first introduced for describing bootstrapping and cross-compiling compilers in McKeeman et al. ''A Compiler Generator'' (1971). Conway described the broader concept before that with his [[UNCOL]] in 1958, to which Bratman added in 1961: H. Bratman, “An alternate form of the ´UNCOL diagram´“, Comm. ACM 4 (March 1961) 3, p. 142. Later on, others, including P.D. Terry, gave an explanation and usage of T-diagrams in their textbooks on the topic of compiler construction. Cf. Terry, 1997, [http://scifac.ru.ac.za/compilers/cha03g.htm Chapter 3]. T-diagrams are also now used to describe client-server interconnectivity on the World Wide Web: cf. Patrick Closhen, et al. 1997: [http://pu.rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/docs/HJH-19990217-etal-T-diagrams.doc ''T-Diagrams as Visual Language to Illustrate WWW Technology''], Darmstadt University of Technology, Darmstadt, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; in the formal description of the [[bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]] problem

== Compilation ==

Compilers enabled the development of programs that are machine-independent. Before the development of FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslator), the first higher-level language, in the 1950s, machine-dependent [[assembly language]] was widely used. While assembly language produces more reusable and relocatable programs than machine code on the same architecture, it has to be modified or rewritten if the program is to be executed on different hardware architecture.

With the advance of high-level programming languages soon followed after FORTRAN, such as COBOL, C, BASIC, programmers can write machine-independent source programs. A compiler translates the high-level source programs into target programs in machine languages for the specific hardwares. Once the target program is generated, the user can execute the program.

=== The structure of a compiler ===

Compilers bridge source programs in high-level languages with the underlying hardware. A compiler requires 1) determining the correctness of the syntax of programs, 2) generating correct and efficient object code, 3) run-time organization, and 4) formatting output according to assembler and/or linker conventions. A compiler consists of three main parts: the frontend, the middle-end, and the backend.

The '''front end''' checks whether the program is correctly written in terms of the programming language syntax and semantics. Here legal and illegal programs are recognized. Errors are reported, if any, in a useful way. [[Programming language#Type_system|Type]] checking is also performed by collecting type information. The frontend then generates an ''intermediate representation'' or ''IR'' of the source code for processing by the middle-end.

The '''middle end''' is where optimization takes place. Typical transformations for optimization are removal of useless or unreachable code, discovery and propagation of constant values, relocation of computation to a less frequently executed place (e.g., out of a loop), or specialization of computation based on the context. The middle-end generates another IR for the following backend. Most optimization efforts are focused on this part.

The '''back end''' is responsible for translating the IR from the middle-end into assembly code. The target instruction(s) are chosen for each IR instruction. Variables are also selected for the registers. Backend utilizes the hardware by figuring out how to keep parallel FUs busy, filling delay slots, and so on. Although most algorithms for optimization are in [[NP_(complexity)|NP]], heuristic techniques are well-developed.

== Compiler output ==

One classification of compilers is by the [[platform (computing)|platform]] on which their generated code executes. This is known as the ''target platform.''
  
A ''native'' or ''hosted'' compiler is one which output is intended to directly run on the same type of computer and operating system that the compiler itself runs on. The output of a [[cross compiler]] is designed to run on a different platform.  Cross compilers are often used when developing software for [[embedded system]]s that are not intended to support a software development environment.

The output of a compiler that produces code for a [[virtual machine]] (VM) may or may not be executed on the same platform as the compiler that produced it.  For this reason such compilers are not usually classified as native or cross compilers.

=== Compiled versus interpreted languages ===

Higher-level programming languages are generally divided for convenience into [[compiled language]]s and [[interpreted language]]s. However, in practice there is rarely anything about a language that ''requires'' it to be exclusively compiled or exclusively interpreted, although it is possible to design languages that rely on re-interpretation at run time. The categorization usually reflects the most popular or widespread implementations of a language &amp;mdash; for instance, BASIC is sometimes called an interpreted language, and C a compiled one, despite the existence of BASIC compilers and C interpreters.

Modern trends toward [[just-in-time compilation]] and [[bytecode|bytecode interpretation]] at times blur the traditional categorizations of compilers and interpreters.

Some language specifications spell out that implementations ''must'' include a compilation facility; for example, [[Common Lisp]]. However, there is nothing inherent in the definition of Common Lisp that stops it from being interpreted. Other languages have features that are very easy to implement in an interpreter, but make writing a compiler much harder; for example, [[APL (programming language)|APL]], [[SNOBOL4]], and many scripting languages allow programs to construct arbitrary source code at runtime with regular string operations, and then execute that code by passing it to a special evaluation function. To implement these features in a compiled language, programs must usually be shipped with a [[runtime library]] that includes a version of the compiler itself.

=== Hardware compilation ===

The output of some compilers may target [[hardware]] at a very low level, for example a [[Field Programmable Gate Array]] (FPGA) or structured [[Application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC).  Such compilers are said to be ''[[hardware compiler]]s'' or synthesis tools because the source code they compile effectively control the final configuration of the hardware and how it operates; the output of the compilation are not instructions that are executed in sequence - only an interconnection of transistors or lookup tables.
For example, XST is the Xilinx Synthesis Tool used for configuring FPGAs. Similar tools are available from Altera, Synplicity, Synopsys and other vendors.

== Compiler construction ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}
{{main|Compiler construction}}
In the early days, the approach taken to compiler design used to be directly affected by the complexity of the processing, the experience of the person(s) designing it, and the resources available.

A compiler for a relatively simple language written by one person might be a single, monolithic piece of software.  When the source language is large and complex, and high quality output is required, the design may be split into a number of relatively independent phases.  Having separate phases means development can be parceled up into small parts and given to different people.  It also becomes much easier to replace a single phase by an improved one, or to insert new phases later (e.g., additional optimizations).

The division of the compilation processes into phases was championed by the [[Production Quality Compiler-Compiler Project]] (PQCC) at [[Carnegie Mellon]] University.  This project introduced the terms ''front end'', ''middle end'', and ''back end''.

All but the smallest of compilers have more than two phases.  However, these phases are usually regarded as being part of the front end or the back end.  The point at which these two ''ends'' meet is open to debate.  The front end is generally considered to be where syntactic and semantic processing takes place, along with translation to a lower level of representation (than source code).

The middle end is usually designed to perform optimizations on a form other than the source code or machine code.  This source code/machine code independence is intended to enable generic optimizations to be shared between versions of the compiler supporting different languages and target processors.

The back end takes the output from the middle.  It may perform more analysis, transformations and optimizations that are for a particular computer.  Then, it generates code for a particular processor and OS.

This front-end/middle/back-end approach makes it possible to combine front ends for different [[programming language|languages]] with back ends for different [[CPU]]s.  Practical examples of this approach are the [[GNU Compiler Collection]], [[LLVM]], and the [[Amsterdam Compiler Kit]], which have multiple front-ends, shared analysis and multiple back-ends.

===One-pass versus multi-pass compilers===
Classifying compilers by number of passes has its background in the hardware resource limitations of computers.  Compiling involves performing lots of work and early computers did not have enough memory to contain one program that did all of this work.  So compilers were split up into smaller programs which each made a pass over the source (or some representation of it) performing some of the required analysis and translations.

The ability to compile in a [[one-pass compiler|single pass]] has classically been seen as a benefit because it simplifies the job of writing a compiler and one pass compilers generally compile faster than [[multi-pass compiler]]s.  Thus, partly driven by the resource limitations of early systems, many early languages were specifically designed so that they could be compiled in a single pass (e.g., [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]).

In some cases the design of a language feature may require a compiler to perform more than one pass over the source.  For instance, consider a declaration appearing on line 20 of the source which affects the translation of a statement appearing on line 10.  In this case, the first pass needs to gather information about declarations appearing after statements that they affect, with the actual translation happening during a subsequent pass.

The disadvantage of compiling in a single pass is that it is not possible to perform many of the sophisticated [[compiler optimization|optimizations]] needed to generate high quality code.  It can be difficult to count exactly how many passes an optimizing compiler makes.  For instance, different phases of optimization may analyse one expression many times but only analyse another expression once.

Splitting a compiler up into small programs is a technique used by researchers interested in producing provably correct compilers.  Proving the correctness of a set of small programs often requires less effort than proving the correctness of a larger, single, equivalent program.

While the typical multi-pass compiler outputs machine code from its final pass, there are several other types:

*A &quot;[[source-to-source compiler]]&quot; is a type of compiler that takes a high level language as its input and outputs a high level language.  For example, an [[Automatic parallelization|automatic parallelizing]] compiler will frequently take in a high level language program as an input and then  transform the code and annotate it with parallel code annotations (e.g. [[OpenMP]]) or language constructs (e.g. Fortran's &lt;code&gt;DOALL&lt;/code&gt; statements).
*[[Stage compiler]] that compiles to assembly language of a theoretical machine, like some [[Prolog]] implementations
**This Prolog machine is also known as the [[Warren Abstract Machine]] (or WAM).
**Bytecode compilers for [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Python language|Python]], and many more are also a subtype of this.
*[[Just-in-time compilation|Just-in-time compiler]], used by Smalltalk and Java systems, and also by Microsoft .NET's [[Common Intermediate Language]] (CIL)
**Applications are delivered in bytecode, which is compiled to native machine code just prior to execution.

=== Front end ===

The front end analyzes the source code to build an internal representation of the program, called the [[intermediate representation]] or ''IR''.  It also manages the [[symbol table]], a data structure mapping each symbol in the source code to associated information such as location, type and scope.  This is done over several phases, which includes some of the following:

# '''Line reconstruction'''.  Languages which [[stropping (syntax)|strop]] their keywords or allow arbitrary spaces within identifiers require a phase before parsing, which converts the input character sequence to a canonical form ready for the parser.  The [[top-down parsing|top-down]], [[recursive descent parser|recursive-descent]], table-driven parsers used in the 1960s typically read the source one character at a time and did not require a separate tokenizing phase.  [[Atlas Autocode]], and [[Edinburgh IMP|Imp]] (and some implementations of [[ALGOL]] and [[Coral 66]]) are examples of stropped languages which compilers would have a ''Line Reconstruction'' phase.
# [[Lexical analysis]] breaks the source code text into small pieces called ''tokens''.  Each token is a single atomic unit of the language, for instance a [[keyword (computing)|keyword]], [[identifier]] or [[symbol|symbol name]].  The token syntax is typically a [[regular language]], so a [[finite state automaton]] constructed from a [[regular expression]] can be used to recognize it.  This phase is also called lexing or scanning, and the software doing lexical analysis is called a [[lexical analyzer]] or scanner.
# [[Preprocessor|Preprocessing]].  Some languages, e.g., [[C (programming language)|C]], require a preprocessing phase which supports [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] substitution and conditional compilation. Typically the preprocessing phase occurs before syntactic or semantic analysis; e.g. in the case of C, the preprocessor manipulates lexical tokens rather than syntactic forms. However, some languages such as [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] support macro substitutions based on syntactic forms.
# [[Syntax analysis]] involves [[parsing]] the token sequence to identify the syntactic structure of the program. This phase typically builds a [[parse tree]], which replaces the linear sequence of tokens with a tree structure built according to the rules of a [[formal grammar]] which define the language's syntax. The parse tree is often analyzed, augmented, and transformed by later phases in the compiler.
# Semantic analysis is the phase in which the compiler adds semantic information to the [[parse tree]] and builds the symbol table. This phase performs semantic checks such as [[type checking]] (checking for type errors), or [[object binding]] (associating variable and function references with their definitions), or [[definite assignment analysis|definite assignment]] (requiring all local variables to be initialized before use), rejecting incorrect programs or issuing warnings. Semantic analysis usually requires a complete parse tree, meaning that this phase logically follows the [[parsing]] phase, and logically precedes the [[code generation (compiler)|code generation]] phase, though it is often possible to fold multiple phases into one pass over the code in a compiler implementation.

===Back end===

The term ''back end'' is sometimes confused with ''[[code generation (compiler)|code generator]]'' because of the overlapped functionality of generating assembly code. Some literature uses ''middle end'' to distinguish the generic analysis and optimization phases in the back end from the machine-dependent code generators. 

The main phases of the back end include the following:

# [[Compiler analysis|Analysis]]: This is the gathering of program information from the intermediate representation derived from the input. Typical analyses are [[data flow analysis]] to build [[use-define chain]]s, [[dependence analysis]], [[alias analysis]], [[pointer analysis]], [[escape analysis]] etc. Accurate analysis is the basis for any compiler optimization. The [[call graph]] and [[control flow graph]] are usually also built during the analysis phase.
# [[Compiler optimization|Optimization]]: the intermediate language representation is transformed into functionally equivalent but faster (or smaller) forms. Popular optimizations are [[inline expansion]], [[dead code elimination]], [[constant propagation]], [[loop transformation]], [[register allocation]] and even [[automatic parallelization]].
# [[Code generation (compiler)|Code generation]]: the transformed intermediate language is translated into the output language, usually the native [[machine language]] of the system. This involves resource and storage decisions, such as deciding which variables to fit into registers and memory and the selection and scheduling of appropriate machine instructions along with their associated addressing modes (see also [[Sethi-Ullman algorithm]]).

Compiler analysis is the prerequisite for any compiler optimization, and they tightly work together. For example, [[dependence analysis]] is crucial for [[loop transformation]]. 

In addition, the scope of compiler analysis and optimizations vary greatly, from as small as a [[basic block]] to the procedure/function level, or even over the whole program ([[interprocedural optimization]]). Obviously, a compiler can potentially do a better job using a broader view. But that broad view is not free: large scope analysis and optimizations are very costly in terms of compilation time and memory space; this is especially true for interprocedural analysis and optimizations.

Interprocedural analysis and optimizations are common in modern commercial compilers from [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]], [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Sun Microsystems]]. The open source [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] was criticized for a long time for lacking powerful interprocedural optimizations, but it is changing in this respect. Another open source compiler with full analysis and optimization infrastructure is [[Open64]], which is used by many organizations for research and commercial purposes.

Due to the extra time and space needed for compiler analysis and optimizations, some compilers skip them by default. Users have to use compilation options to explicitly tell the compiler which optimizations should be enabled.

==Compiler correctness==
{{Main|Compiler correctness}}
[[Compiler correctness]] is the branch of software engineering that deals with trying to show that a compiler behaves according to its [[programming language|language specification]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Techniques include developing the compiler using [[formal methods]] and using rigorous testing (often called compiler validation) on an existing compiler.

== Related techniques ==

[[Assembly language]] is a type of low-level language and a program that compiles it is more commonly known as an ''assembler'', with the inverse program known as a ''[[disassembler]]''.

A program that translates from a low level language to a higher level one is a ''[[decompiler]]''.  

A program that translates between high-level languages is usually called a ''language translator'', ''source to source translator'', ''language converter'', or ''language [[rewriting|rewriter]]''. The last term is usually applied to translations that do not involve a change of language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Vocal range}}
A '''castrato''' (Italian, plural: ''castrati'') is a man with a [[human voice|singing voice]] equivalent to that of a [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], or [[contralto]] voice produced either by [[castration]] of the singer before [[puberty]] or one who, because of an [[endocrinology|endocrinological]] condition, never reaches sexual maturity.

Castration before puberty (or in its early stages) prevents a boy's [[larynx]] from being transformed by the [[Puberty#Voice_change|normal physiological events]] of puberty. As a result, the [[vocal range]] of prepubescence (shared by both sexes) is largely retained, and the voice develops into adulthood in a unique way. Prepubescent castration for this purpose diminished greatly in the late 18th century and was made illegal in Italy in 1870.

As the castrato's body grew, his lack of testosterone meant that his [[epiphyses]] (bone-joints) did not harden in the normal manner. Thus the [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s of the castrati often grew unusually long, as did the bones of their [[rib]]s. This, combined with intensive training, gave them unrivalled [[lung capacity|lung-power]] and breath capacity. Operating through small, child-sized [[vocal cords]], their voices were also extraordinarily flexible, and quite different from the equivalent adult female voice, as well as higher vocal ranges of the uncastrated adult male (see [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], [[alto (voice)|alto]], [[sopranist]], [[countertenor]] and [[contralto]]). Listening to the only surviving recordings of a castrato (see below), one can hear that the lower part of the voice sounds like a &quot;super-high&quot; tenor, with a more [[falsetto]]-like upper register above that.

Castrati were rarely referred to as such: in the 18th century, the [[euphemism]] ''[[musico]]'' (pl ''musici'') was much more generally used, although it usually carried derogatory implications;&lt;ref&gt;[[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]], vol 3, p.529, sv &quot;musico&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; another synonym was ''evirato'' (literally meaning &quot;emasculated&quot;). [[Eunuch]] is a more general term, since historically many eunuchs were castrated after puberty, castration thus having no effect on their voices.

==History of castration==
Castration as a means of subjugation, enslavement or other punishment has a very long pedigree, dating back to ancient [[Sumer]] (see also [[Eunuch]]). In a Western context, [[eunuch]] singers are known to have existed from the early [[Byzantine Empire]]. In [[Constantinople]] around 400 AD the empress [[Aelia Eudoxia]] had a eunuch choir-master, Brison, who may have established the use of castrati in Byzantine choirs, though whether Brison himself was a singer, and whether he had colleagues who were eunuch singers, is not certain. By the 9th century, eunuch singers were well-known (not least in the choir of [[Hagia Sophia]]), and remained so until the sack of Constantinople by the Western forces of the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204. Their fate from then until their reappearance in Italy more than three hundred years later is by no means clear, though it seems likely that the Spanish tradition of soprano falsettists may have &quot;hidden&quot; castrati (it should be remembered that much of Spain was under Arab sovereignty at various times during the Middle Ages, and that castration has a history going back to the ancient near east—stereotypically [[Eunuch (court official)|Eunuchs]] are supposed to have served as harem &quot;guards&quot;, but more importantly they served as governors and high-level political appointees—they could not start a dynasty which would threaten the ruler from a powerful position).

==Castrati in the European classical tradition==
Castrati first appeared in Italy in the mid-16th century, though at first the terms describing them were not always clear. The phrase ''Soprano maschio'' (male soprano), which could also mean falsettist, occurs in the ''Due Dialoghi della Musica'' of Luigi Dentini, an Oratorian priest, published in Rome in 1553. On 9 November 1555 Cardinal [[Ippolito II d'Este]] (famed as the builder of the Villa d'Este at Tivoli), wrote to [[Guglielmo I Gonzaga|Guglielmo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]] (1538–1587), that he has heard that His Grace is interested in his ''cantoretti'', and offering to send him two, so that he could choose one for his own service. This is a rare term, but probably does equate to ''castrato''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherr&quot;&gt;Sherr&lt;/ref&gt; The Cardinal's brother, [[Alfonso II, Duke of Ferrara|Alfonso II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara]], was another early enthusiast, enquiring about castrati in 1556. There were certainly castrati in the [[Sistine Chapel]] choir in 1558, although not described as such: on 27 April of that year, Hernando Bustamante, a Spaniard from [[Palencia]], was admitted (the first castrati so termed who joined the Sistine choir were Pietro Paolo Folignato and Girolamo Rossini, admitted in 1599).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherr&quot;/&gt; Surprisingly, considering the later French distaste for castrati they certainly existed in France at this time also, being known of in Paris, [[Orléans]], [[Picardy]] and [[Normandy]], though they were not abundant: the King of France himself had difficulty in obtaining them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherr&quot;/&gt; By 1574 there were castrati in the Ducal court chapel at [[Munich]], where the [[Kapellmeister]] (music director) was the famous [[Orlando di Lasso]]. In 1589, by the bull ''Cum pro nostri temporali munere'', [[Pope Sixtus V]] re-organised the choir of [[St Peter's, Rome]] specifically to include castrati. Thus the castrati came to supplant both boys (whose voices broke after only a few years) and falsettists (whose voices were weaker and less reliable) from the top line in such choirs. Women were banned by the Pauline dictum ''mulieres in ecclesiis taceant'' (&quot;let women keep silent in church&quot;; see I Corinthians, ch 14, v 34).

==Castrati in opera==
[[File:Farinelli female caricature edited.jpg|thumb|left|A caricature of Farinelli in a female role, by Pier Leone Ghezzi 1724.]]
Although the castrato (or musico) predates opera, there is some evidence that castrati had parts in the earliest operas. In the first performance of [[Monteverdi]]'s ''Orfeo'' (1607), for example, they played subsidiary roles, including Speranza and (possibly) that of Euridice. Although female roles were performed by castrati in some of the papal states, this was increasingly rare; by 1680, they had supplanted &quot;normal&quot; male voices in lead roles, and retained their position as ''primo uomo'' for about a hundred years;&lt;ref&gt;see Heriot, A: ''The Castrati in Opera'' (London, 1956), p. 31 ff&lt;/ref&gt; an Italian opera not featuring at least one renowned castrato in a lead part would be doomed to fail. Because of the popularity of Italian opera throughout 18th-century Europe (except France), singers such as Ferri, [[Farinelli]], [[Senesino]] and [[Gasparo Pacchierotti|Pacchierotti]] became the first operatic superstars, earning enormous fees and hysterical public adulation.&lt;ref&gt;Heriot chs. 1–3 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; The strictly hierarchical organisation of ''[[opera seria]]'' favoured their high voices as symbols of heroic virtue, though they were frequently mocked for their strange appearance and bad acting: &quot;Farinelli drew every Body to the Haymarket. What a Pipe ! What Modulation! What Extasy to the Ear ! But, Heavens ! What Clumsiness ! What Stupidity! What Offence to the Eye! Reader, if of the City, thou mayest probably have seen in the Fields of Islington or Mile-End or, If thou art in the environs of St James', thou must have observed in the Park with what Ease and Agility a cow, heavy with calf, has rose up at the command of the milkwoman's foot: thus from the mossy bank sprang the DIVINE FARINELLI&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, R: ''Reflections on Theatrical Expression in Tragedy'' (London, 1755), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

More modern objections to the existence of castrati in Europe might centre on the means by which the preparation of future singers could lead to premature death. To prevent the child from experiencing the intense pain of castration, many were inadvertently administered lethal doses of opium or some other narcotic, or were killed by overlong compression of the carotid artery in the neck (intended to render them unconscious during the castration procedure).&lt;ref&gt;such procedures are described in D'Ancillon, as translated in to English by Samber, R.: ''Eunuchism Display'd ...'' (London, 1718), pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18th century itself, the music historian [[Charles Burney]] was sent from pillar to post in search of places where ''the operation'' was carried out: &quot;I enquired throughout Italy at what place boys were chiefly qualified for singing by castration, but could get no certain intelligence. I was told at Milan that it was at Venice; at Venice that it was at Bologna; but at Bologna the fact was denied, and I was referred to Florence; from Florence to Rome, and from Rome I was sent to Naples&amp;nbsp;... it is said that there are shops in Naples with this inscription: 'QUI SI CASTRANO RAGAZZI' (&quot;Here boys are castrated&quot;); but I was utterly unable to see or hear of any such shops during my residence in that city.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Scholes, P (ed): ''Dr Burney's Musical Tours in Europe'' (London, 1959), vol 1, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

The training of the boys was rigorous. The regime of one singing school in Rome (c. 1700) consisted of one hour of singing difficult and awkward pieces, one hour practising trills, one hour practising ornamented passaggi, one hour of singing exercises in their teacher's presence and in front of a mirror so as to avoid unnecessary movement of the body or facial grimaces, and one hour of literary study; all this, moreover, before lunch. After, half-an-hour would be devoted to musical theory, another to writing counterpoint, an hour copying down the same from dictation, and another hour of literary study. During the remainder of the day, the young castrati had to find time to practice their harpsichord playing, and to compose vocal music, either sacred or secular depending on their inclination.&lt;ref&gt;see Bontempi, G: ''Historia Musica'' (Perugia, 1695), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; This demanding schedule meant that, if sufficiently talented, they were able to make a debut in their mid-teens with a perfect technique and a voice of a flexibility and power no woman or ordinary male singer could match.
[[File:Scalzi by Flipart.jpg|thumb|The castrato [[Carlo Scalzi]], by Joseph Flipart, c. 1737.]]

In the 1720s and 1730s, at the height of the craze for these voices, it has been estimated that upwards of 4,000 boys were castrated annually in the service of art.&lt;ref&gt;a claim first made in Pleasants, H., &quot;The Castrati&quot;, ''Stereo Review'', July 1966, p. 38)&lt;/ref&gt; Many came from poor homes and were castrated by their parents in the hope that their child might be successful and lift them from poverty (this was the case with [[Senesino]]). There are, though, records of some young boys asking to be operated on to preserve their voices (e.g. Caffarelli, who was from a wealthy family: his grandmother gave him the income from two vineyards to pay for his studies&lt;ref&gt;Faustini-Fassini, E.: ''Gli astri maggiori del bel canto napoletano'' in ''Note d'archivio'' 15, (1938), p 12&lt;/ref&gt;). Caffarelli was also typical of many castrati in being famous for tantrums on and off-stage, and for amorous adventures with noble ladies.&lt;ref&gt;see Heriot, p. 141–154&lt;/ref&gt; Some, as described by Casanova, preferred gentlemen (noble or otherwise).&lt;ref&gt;Casanova, G. ''Memoirs'' (tr. A. Machen, with additional tr. by A. Symons (London, 1894) vol. 4c, ch. 10; available online at www.gutenberg.net&lt;/ref&gt; Modern endocrinology would suggest that the castrati's much-vaunted sexual prowess was more the stuff of legend than reality – in addition to lacking a hormonal (but not a socio-psychological) sex drive, a castrato's remaining genitalia will not develop in size.&lt;ref&gt;but see Barbier, pp. 13–15&lt;/ref&gt; Only a small percentage of boys castrated to preserve their voices had successful careers on the operatic stage; the better &quot;also-rans&quot; sang in cathedral or church choirs, but because of their marked appearance and the ban on their marrying, there was little room for them in society outside a musical context.&lt;ref&gt;for a general discussion of castrati in society, see Barbier, ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The castrati came in for a great amount of scurrilous and unkind abuse, and as their fame increased, so did the hatred of them. They were often castigated as malign creatures who lured men into [[homosexuality]], and there were admittedly homosexual castrati, as [[Casanova]]'s accounts of 18th-century [[Italy]] bear witness. He mentions meeting an abbé whom he took for a girl in disguise, only later discovering that &quot;she&quot; was a famous castrato. In [[Rome]] in 1762 he attended a performance at which the [[prima donna]] was a castrato, &quot;the favourite pathic&quot; of Cardinal Borghese, who dined every evening with his protector. From his behaviour on stage &quot;it was obvious that he hoped to inspire the love of those who liked him as a man, and probably would not have done so as a woman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Angus Heriot, ''The Castrati in Opera'', London, 1956; Ed Wayne Dynes, ''Encyclopedia of Homosexuality'', New York, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
[[File:Moreschi giovane.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alessandro Moreschi]], the last of the Sistine castrati]]

By the late 18th century, changes in operatic taste and social attitudes spelled the end for castrati. They lingered on past the end of the ''[[ancien régime]]'' (which their style of opera parallels), and two of their number, [[Gaspare Pacchierotti|Pacchierotti]] and [[Crescentini]], even entranced the iconoclastic Napoleon. The last great operatic castrato was [[Giovanni Velluti (castrato)|Giovanni Battista Velluti]] (1781–1861), who performed the last operatic castrato role ever written: Armando in ''[[Il crociato in Egitto]]'' by [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]] (Venice, 1824). Soon after this they were replaced definitively as the first men of the operatic stage by a new breed of heroic tenor, as first incarnated by the Frenchman [[Gilbert-Louis Duprez]], the earliest so-called &quot;king of the high Cs&quot;. His successors have included such singers as [[Enrico Tamberlik]], [[Jean de Reszke]], [[Francesco Tamagno]], [[Enrico Caruso]], [[Giovanni Martinelli]], [[Beniamino Gigli]], [[Jussi Björling]], [[Franco Corelli]] and [[Luciano Pavarotti]], among others.{{Listen|filename=Alessandro_Moreschi.ogg|title=A castrato singing|description=[[Alessandro Moreschi]] performs part of Eugenio Terziani's ''Hostias et preces''}}

After the unification of Italy in 1861, castration for musical purposes was officially made illegal (the new Italian state had adopted a French legal code which expressly forbade the practice). In 1878, [[Pope Leo XIII]] prohibited the hiring of new castrati by the church: only in the Sistine Chapel and in other papal basilicas in Rome did a few castrati linger. A group photo of the Sistine Choir taken in 1898 shows that by then only six remained (plus the ''Direttore Perpetuo'', the fine soprano castrato Domenico Mustafà), and in 1902 a ruling was extracted from Pope Leo that no further castrati should be admitted. The official end to the castrati came on St. Cecilia's Day, 22 November 1903, when the new pope, Pius X, issued his ''motu proprio'', ''Tra le Sollecitudini'' ('Amongst the Cares'), which contained this instruction: &quot;Whenever&amp;nbsp;... it is desirable to employ the high voices of sopranos and contraltos, these parts must be taken by boys, according to the most ancient usage of the Church.&quot;

The last Sistine castrato to survive was [[Alessandro Moreschi]], the only castrato to have made solo recordings. While an interesting historical record, these discs of his give us only a glimpse of the castrato voice – although he had been renowned as &quot;The Angel of Rome&quot; at the beginning of his career, some would say he was past his prime when the recordings were made in 1902 and 1904 and he never attempted to sing opera.&lt;ref&gt;Clapton, N.: Alessandro Moreschi and the World of the Castrato (London, 2008), p. 197–216&lt;/ref&gt; He retired officially in March 1913, and died in 1922.

The Catholic Church's involvement in the castrato phenomenon has long been controversial, and there have recently been calls for it to issue an official apology for its role. As early as 1748, [[Pope Benedict XIV]] tried to ban castrati from churches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World of the Castrati: the history of an extraordinary operatic phenomenon |last=Barbier |first=P. (trans. M. Crosland) | others= |year=1998 |publisher=Souvenir Press |location=London |isbn=0285634607 |chapter=Chapter 6.

The rumours of another castrato sequestered in the Vatican for the personal delectation of the Pontiff until as recently as 1959 have been proven false. The singer in question was a pupil of Moreschi's, Domenico Mancini, such a successful imitator of his teacher's voice that even [[Lorenzo Perosi]], Direttore Perpetuo of the Sistine Choir from 1898 to 1956 and a lifelong opponent of castrati, thought he was a castrato. Mancini was in fact a moderately skilful falsettist and professional [[double-bass]] player.&lt;ref&gt;Clapton, N.: Alessandro Moreschi and the World of the Castrato (London, 2008), pp. 180–181, 200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern castrati and similar voices==

So-called &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;endocrinological castrati&quot; are born with [[hormone|hormonal]] anomalies such as [[Kallmann's syndrome]], or have undergone unusual physical or medical events during their early lives that reproduce the vocal effects of castration without being castrated. [[Javier Medina]], [[Jimmy Scott]], [[Jorge Cano]], [[Paulo Abel do Nascimento]] and [[Radu Marian]] are examples of this type of high male voice.&lt;ref&gt;see their entries at http://www.tp4.rub.de/~ak/disc/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Maniaci]] is somewhat different, in that he has no hormonal or other anomalies, but for some unknown reason, his voice did not &quot;break&quot; in the usual manner, leaving him still able to sing in the soprano register.&lt;ref&gt;for an interview with this singer, see http://www.operatoday.com/content/2005/04/an_interview_wi_4.php&lt;/ref&gt; Other uncastrated male adults sing soprano, generally using some form of [[falsetto]], but in a much higher range than most [[countertenor]]s. Examples are [[Aris Christofellis]],&lt;ref&gt;see http://malesopranos.com/cat/10/3-0/aris-christofellis&lt;/ref&gt; Jörg Waschinski,&lt;ref&gt;see http://www.joerg-waschinski.de/jndex_f.html&lt;/ref&gt; and Ghio Nannini.&lt;ref&gt;at http://www.ghionannini.com/Main.asp&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is believed the castrati possessed more of tenorial chest register (the low range, down to C3, of the aria &quot;Navigante che non spera&quot; in [[Leonardo Leo]]'s opera ''Il Medo'', written for [[Carlo Broschi|Farinelli]], is a case in point).&lt;ref&gt;F. Haböck, ''Die Gesangkunst der Kastraten'', (Vienna, 1923), pp. 10–15&lt;/ref&gt; Similar low-voiced singing can be heard from the [[jazz]] vocalist [[Jimmy Scott]] whose range matches approximately that used by female [[blues]] singers,&lt;ref&gt;hear him at http://www.jimmyscottofficialwebsite.org/&lt;/ref&gt; while the Turkish popular singer [[Cem Adrian]] has the ability to sing from bass to soprano, his vocal folds having been reported to be three times the average length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/haber.aspx?id=317475&amp;yazarid=100|title=Kaleydoskop içine hapsolmuş kanatsız bir melek (Angel without wings, captured in a kaleidoscope)|last=Capa|first=Ebru|date=7 May 2005|publisher=[[Hürriyet]]|language=török|accessdate=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Chris Colfer]] has a similar range. Colfer has stated in interviews that, when his voice began to change at puberty, he sang in a high voice &quot;constantly&quot; in an effort to retain his range.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glee's Chris Colfor on Owning Defying Gravity and Resembling a Hummel Figure&quot;&gt;[http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2009/11/chris_colfer_on_playing_kurt_i.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Some common rhymes */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''counting-out game''' is a simple [[game]] intended to [[Selection methods|select a person]] to be &quot;it&quot;, often for the purpose of playing another game. Some counting-out games are
* [[Rock, Paper, Scissors]]
* [[Odd or Even]]
* [[Coin flipping]]
* [[Drawing straws]] - player with the shortest straw loses.
* [[Bizz Buzz]]

Many such games involve one person pointing at each participant in a circle of players while reciting a [[rhyme]]. A new person is pointed at as each word is said. The player who is selected at the conclusion of the rhyme is &quot;it&quot; or &quot;out&quot;.  In an alternate version, the circle of players may each put two feet in and at the conclusion of the rhyme, that player removes one foot and the rhyme starts over with the next person. In this case, the first player that has both feet removed is &quot;it&quot; or &quot;out&quot;.  These are often accepted as [[random]] selections because the number of words has not been calculated beforehand, so the result is unknown right up until someone is selected.

A variant of counting-out game, known as [[Josephus problem]], represents a famous theoretical problem in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[cryptography]], '''key size''' or '''key length''' is the size measured in [[bit]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Password strength#Human-generated passwords|Calculating Bit Strength]]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[key (cryptography)|key]] used in a cryptographic algorithm (such as a [[cipher]]). An algorithm's key length is distinct from its cryptographic security, which is a logarithmic measure of the fastest known computational attack on the algorithm, also measured in bits. The security of an algorithm cannot exceed its key length (since any algorithm can be cracked by [[brute force attack|brute force]]), but it can be smaller. For example, [[Triple DES]] has a key size of 168 bits but provides at most 112 bits of security, since an attack of complexity 2&lt;sup&gt;112&lt;/sup&gt; is known. This property of Triple DES is not a weakness provided 112 bits of security is sufficient for an application. Most [[symmetric-key algorithm]]s in common use are designed to have security equal to their key length. No [[asymmetric-key algorithm]]s with this property are known; [[elliptic curve cryptography]] comes the closest with an effective security of roughly half its key length.

==Significance==
[[Key (cryptography)|Keys]] are used to control the operation of a cipher so that only the correct key can convert encrypted text ([[ciphertext]]) to [[plaintext]]. Many ciphers are based on publicly known [[algorithm]]s or are [[open source]], and so it is only the difficulty of obtaining the key that determines security of the system, provided that there is no analytic attack (i.e., a 'structural weakness' in the algorithms or protocols used), and assuming that the key is not otherwise available (such as via theft, extortion, or compromise of computer systems). The widely accepted notion that the security of the system should depend on the key alone has been explicitly formulated by [[Auguste Kerckhoffs]] (in the 1880s) and [[Claude Shannon]] (in the 1940s); the statements are known as [[Kerckhoffs' principle]] and Shannon's Maxim respectively. 

A key should therefore be large enough that a brute force attack (possible against any encryption algorithm) is infeasible &amp;ndash; i.e., would take too long to execute. [[Claude Shannon|Shannon's]] work on [[information theory]] showed that to achieve so called ''[[perfect secrecy]]'', it is necessary for the key length to be at least as large as the message to be transmitted and only used once (this algorithm is called the [[One-time pad]]). In light of this, and the practical difficulty of managing such long keys, modern cryptographic practice has discarded the notion of perfect secrecy as a requirement for encryption, and instead focuses on ''[[computational security]]'', under which the computational requirements of breaking an encrypted text must be infeasible for an attacker.

The [[preferred numbers]] commonly used as key sizes (in bits) are powers of two, potentially multiplied with a small odd integer.

==Key size and encryption system==
Encryption systems are often grouped into families. Common families include symmetric systems (e.g. [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]]) and asymmetric systems (e.g. [[RSA]]); they may alternatively be grouped according to the central [[algorithm]] used (e.g. [[elliptic curve cryptography]]).

As each of these is of a different level of cryptographic complexity, it is usual to have different key sizes for the same level of security, depending upon the algorithm used. For example, the security available with a 1024-bit key using asymmetric RSA is considered approximately equal in security to an 80-bit key in a symmetric algorithm (Source: [[RSA Security]]). 

The actual degree of security achieved over time varies, as more computational power and more powerful mathematical analytic methods become available. For this reason cryptologists tend to look at indicators that an algorithm or key length shows signs of potential vulnerability, to move to longer key sizes or more difficult algorithms. For example {{As of|2007|05|lc=on}}, a 1039 bit integer was factored with the [[special number field sieve]] using 400 computers over 11 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,132184-pg,1/article.html Researcher: RSA 1024-bit Encryption not Enough]&lt;/ref&gt; The factored number was of a special form; the special number field sieve cannot be used on RSA keys. The computation is roughly equivalent to breaking a 700 bit RSA key. However, this might be an advanced warning that 1024 bit RSA used in secure online commerce should be [[deprecation|deprecated]], since they may become breakable in the near future. Cryptography professor [[Arjen Lenstra]] observed that &quot;Last time, it took nine years for us to generalize from a special to a nonspecial, hard-to-factor number&quot; and when asked whether 1024-bit RSA keys are dead, said: &quot;The answer to that question is an unqualified yes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070523-researchers-307-digit-key-crack-endangers-1024-bit-rsa.html Researchers: 307-digit key crack endangers 1024-bit RSA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brute force attack==
{{Main|Brute force attack}}
Even if a symmetric cipher is currently unbreakable by exploiting structural weaknesses in its algorithm, it is possible to run through the entire space of keys in what is known as a ''brute force attack''. Since longer symmetric keys require exponentially more work to brute force search, a sufficiently long symmetric key makes this line of attack impractical.

With a key of length ''n'' bits, there are 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; possible keys. This number grows very rapidly as ''n'' increases. [[Moore's law]] suggests that computing power doubles roughly every 18 to 24 months, but even this doubling effect leaves the larger symmetric key lengths currently considered acceptably well out of reach. The large number of operations (2&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;) required to try all possible 128-bit keys is widely considered to be [[Large numbers#Computers and computational complexity|out of reach]] for conventional digital computing techniques for the foreseeable future.  However, alternative forms of computing technology are anticipated which may have superior processing power than classical computers. If a suitably sized [[quantum computer]] capable of running [[Grover's algorithm]] reliably becomes available, it would reduce a 128-bit key down to 64-bit security, roughly a DES equivalent. This is one of the reasons why AES supports a 256-bit key length.  See the discussion on the relationship between key lengths and quantum computing attacks at the bottom of this page for more information.

==Symmetric algorithm key lengths==
US Government export policy has long [[Export of cryptography|restricted the 'strength' of cryptography]] which can be sent out of the country. For many years the limit was [[40-bit encryption|40 bits]]. Today, a key length of 40 bits offers little protection against even a casual attacker with a single PC. The restrictions have not been removed (in 2007, it is still illegal to export cryptographic software using key lengths greater than 64-bits without authorization from the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security),{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} but it became easier to gain authorization to export to certain countries in 1999/2000.

When the [[Data Encryption Standard]] cipher was released in 1977, a key length of 56 bits was thought to be sufficient. There was speculation at the time, however, that the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] has deliberately reduced the key size from the original value of 112 bits (in IBM's [[Lucifer (cipher)|Lucifer cipher]]) or 64 bits (in one of the versions of what was adopted as DES) so as to limit the strength of encryption available to non-US users. The NSA has major computing resources and a large budget; some thought that 56 bits was NSA-breakable in the late '70s. However, by the late 90s, it became clear that DES could be cracked in a few days' time-frame with custom-built hardware such as could be purchased by a large corporation. The book ''Cracking DES'' (O'Reilly and Associates) tells of the successful attempt to break 56-bit DES by a brute force attack mounted by a cyber civil rights group with limited resources; see [[EFF DES cracker]].  56 bits is now considered insufficient length for [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric algorithm]] keys, and may have been for some time. More technically and financially capable organizations were surely able to do the same long before the effort described in the book.  [[Distributed.net]] and its volunteers broke a 64-bit RC5 key in several years, using about seventy thousand (mostly home) computers.  

The [[NSA]]'s [[Skipjack (cipher)|Skipjack]] algorithm used in its [[Fortezza]] program employs 80 bit keys.

DES has been replaced in many applications by [[Triple DES]], which has 112 bits of security with 168-bit keys.

The [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] published in 2001 uses a key size of (at minimum) 128 bits. It also can use keys up to 256 bits (a specification requirement for submissions to the [[AES contest]]). 128 bits is currently thought, by many observers, to be sufficient for the foreseeable future for symmetric algorithms of AES's quality. The U.S. Government requires 192 or 256-bit AES keys for [[highly sensitive]] data.

In 2003 the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology, [[NIST]], proposed that 80-bit keys should be phased out by 2015. As of 2005, 80-bit keys were allowed to be used only until 2010.

==Asymmetric algorithm key lengths==
The effectiveness of [[public key cryptography|public key cryptosystems]] depends on the intractability (computational and theoretical) of certain mathematical problems such as [[integer factorization]]. These problems are time consuming to solve, but usually faster than trying all possible keys by brute force.  Thus, asymmetric algorithm keys must be longer for equivalent resistance to attack than symmetric algorithm keys. As of 2002, a key length of 1024 bits was generally considered the minimum necessary for the [[RSA]] encryption algorithm. 

{{As of|2003}} [[RSA Security]] claims that 1024-bit RSA keys are equivalent in strength to 80-bit symmetric keys, 2048-bit RSA keys to 112-bit symmetric keys and 3072-bit RSA keys to 128-bit symmetric keys. RSA claims that 1024-bit keys are likely to become crackable some time between 2006 and 2010 and that 2048-bit keys are sufficient until 2030. An RSA key length of 3072 bits should be used if security is required beyond 2030.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2004 TWIRL and RSA Key Size]&lt;/ref&gt;  NIST key management guidelines further suggest that 15360-bit RSA keys are equivalent in strength to 256-bit symmetric keys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-57/sp800-57-Part1-revised2_Mar08-2007.pdf Recommendation for Key Management – Part 1: General (Revised) page 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Finite Field [[Diffie-Hellman]] algorithm has roughly the same key strength as RSA for the same key sizes.  The work factor for breaking Diffie-Hellman is based on the [[discrete logarithm problem]], which is related to the integer factorization problem on which RSA's strength is based. Thus, a 3072-bit Diffie-Hellman key has about the same strength as a 3072-bit RSA key.

One of the asymmetric algorithm types, [[elliptic curve cryptography]], or ECC, appears to be secure with shorter keys than those needed by other asymmetric key algorithms. [[NIST]] guidelines state that ECC keys should be twice the length of equivalent strength symmetric key algorithms. So, for example, a 224-bit ECC key would have roughly the same strength as a 112-bit symmetric key. These estimates assume no major breakthroughs in solving the underlying mathematical problems that ECC is based on. A message encrypted with an elliptic key algorithm using a 109-bit long key has been broken by brute force.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.certicom.com/index.php/2004-press-releases/36-2004-press-releases/300-solution-required-team-of-mathematicians-2600-computers-and-17-months- Certicom Announces Elliptic Curve Cryptography Challenge Winner]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[NSA]] specifies that &quot;Elliptic Curve Public Key Cryptography using the 256-bit prime modulus elliptic curve as specified in FIPS-186-2 and SHA-256 are appropriate for protecting classified information up to the SECRET level. Use of the 384-bit prime modulus elliptic curve and SHA-384 are necessary for the protection of TOP SECRET information.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/index.shtml NSA Suite B Cryptography (nsa.gov)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of quantum computing attacks on key strength==
The two best known quantum computing attacks are based on [[Shor's algorithm]] and [[Grover's algorithm]]. Of the two Shor's offers the greater risk to current security systems.

Derivatives of Shor's algorithm are widely conjectured to be effective against all mainstream public-key algorithms including [[RSA]], [[Diffie-Hellman]] and [[elliptic curve cryptography]]. According to Professor Gilles Brassard, an expert in quantum computing: &quot;The time needed to factor an RSA integer is the same order as the time needed to use that same integer as modulus for a single RSA encryption.   In other words, it takes no more time to break RSA on a quantum computer (up to a multiplicative constant) than to use it legitimately on a classical computer.&quot; The general consensus is that these public key algorithms are insecure at any key size if sufficiently large quantum computers capable of running Shor's algorithm become available. The implication of this attack is that all data encrypted using current standards based security systems such as the ubiquitous [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] used to protect e-commerce and Internet banking and [[SSH]] used to protect access to sensitive computing systems is at risk. Encrypted data protected using public-key algorithms can be archived and may be broken at a later time. 

Mainstream symmetric ciphers (such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] or [[Twofish]]) and collision resistant hash functions (such as [[SHA]]) are widely conjectured to offer greater security against known quantum computing attacks. They are widely conjectured to be most vulnerable to [[Grover's algorithm]]. Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard, and Vazirani proved in 1996 that a brute-force key search on a quantum computer cannot be faster than roughly 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''/2&lt;/sup&gt; invocations of the underlying cryptographic algorithm, compared with roughly 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; in the classical case.&lt;ref name=bennett_1997&gt;Bennett C.H., Bernstein E., Brassard G., Vazirani U., ''[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/pubs/bbbv.ps The strengths and weaknesses of quantum computation]''. [[SIAM Journal on Computing]] 26(5): 1510-1523 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in the presence of large quantum computers an ''n''-bit key can provide at most ''n''/2 bits of security. Quantum brute force is easily defeated by doubling the key length, which has little extra computational cost in ordinary use. This implies that at least a 160-bit symmetric key is required to achieve 80-bit security rating against a quantum computer.

'''Cognitive behavioral therapy''' (or '''cognitive behavioral therapies''' or '''CBT''') is a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] approach, a [[talking therapies|talking therapy]], that aims to solve problems concerning dysfunctional emotions, behaviors and cognitions through a goal-oriented, systematic procedure. The title is used in diverse ways to designate [[behaviour therapy|behavior therapy]], [[cognitive therapy]], and to refer to therapy based upon a combination of basic [[behaviorism|behavioral]] and [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.babcp.com/silo/files/what-is-cbt.pdf [[British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies]]: What are Cognitive and/or Behavioural Psychotherapies?] Retrieved on 2008-11-1&lt;/ref&gt;

There is empirical evidence that CBT is effective for the treatment of a variety of problems, including mood, anxiety, personality, eating, substance abuse, and psychotic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Butler AC, Chapman JE, Forman EM, Beck AT |title=The empirical status of cognitive-behavioral therapy: a review of meta-analyses |journal=Clin Psychol Rev |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=17–31 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16199119 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2005.07.003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cooper_2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cooper |first=Mick |title=Essential Research Findings in Counselling and Psychotherapy: The Facts are Friendly |year=2008|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|isbn=9781847870421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment is often manualized, with specific technique-driven brief, direct, and time-limited treatments for specific psychological disorders. CBT is used in individual therapy as well as group settings, and the techniques are often adapted for [[self-help]] applications. Some clinicians and researchers are more cognitive oriented (e.g. [[cognitive restructuring]]), while others are more behaviorally oriented (in vivo [[exposure therapy]]). Other interventions combine both (e.g. imaginal exposure therapy).&lt;ref&gt;Foa, E., Rothbaum, B., &amp; Furr, J. (2111). Augmenting exposure therapy with other CBT procedures.

CBT was primarily developed through a merging of [[behavior therapy]] with [[cognitive therapy]]. While rooted in rather different theories, these two traditions found common ground in focusing on the &quot;here and now&quot;, and on alleviating symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachman_1997&quot; /&gt; Many CBT treatment programs for specific disorders have been evaluated for [[efficacy]] and effectiveness; the health-care trend of [[evidence-based treatment]], where specific treatments for symptom-based diagnoses are recommended, has favored CBT over other approaches such as [[psychodynamic]] treatments.&lt;ref name=&quot;baojournal.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bergin_garfield_ch1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lambert |first=M.

==History==
&lt;!-- [[BEHAVIOR THERAPY]] ROOTS --&gt;
Precursors of certain fundamental aspects of CBT have been identified in various ancient philosophical traditions, particularly [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Robertson_2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author=Robertson, D | title=The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy| year=2010| publisher=Karnac| location=London| isbn=978-1855757561|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XsOFyJaR5vEC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Beck's original treatment manual for depression states, &quot;The philosophical origins of cognitive therapy can be traced back to the Stoic philosophers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Rush, Shaw, &amp; Emery  (1979)  Cognitive Therapy of Depression, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  The modern roots of CBT can be traced to the development of behavior therapy in the early 20th century, the development of cognitive therapy in the 1960s, and the subsequent merging of the two. Behavior therapeutical approaches appeared as early as 1924,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachman_1997&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author=Rachman, S |editor =Clark, D, Fairburn, CG &amp; Gelder, MG  |title=Science and practice of cognitive behaviour therapy | chapter=The evolution of cognitive behaviour therapy |pages=1–26| year=1997 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford  | isbn=0-19-262726-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Mary Cover Jones]]' work on the unlearning of fears in children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones_1924&quot; &gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones |first=MC |authorlink=Mary Cover Jones |year=1924 |title=Elimination of children's fears |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Psychology]] |volume=7 |pages=382–397 |doi=10.1037/h0072283}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 [[Abraham Low]] developed cognitive training techniques for patient [[managed care|aftercare]] following psychiatric hospitalization.&lt;ref name=&quot;LEE1995&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee |first=Donald T |title=Professional underutilization of Recovery, Inc. |journal=Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal |volume=19 |issue=1 |year=1995 |pages=63–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MURRAY1996&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Recovery, Inc., as an adjunct to treatment in an era of managed care |last=Murray |first=Peter |journal=Psychiatric services |location=Washington, D.C. |volume=47 |issue=12 |month=December |year=1996 |pages=1378–1381 |pmid=9117478}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KURTZ1997&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kurtz |first=Linda, Farris |title=Self-help and support groups: a handbook for practitioners |year=1997 |chapter=Chapter 2: Help Characteristics and Change Mechanisms in Self-Help and Support Groups: Change Mechanisms in Self-Help Groups |pages=24–29 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=0803970994 |oclc=35558964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SACHS1997&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Recovery, Inc.: A Wellness Model for Self-Help Mental Health |last=Sachs |first=Shirley |journal=Continuum: Developments in Ambulatory Mental Health Care |volume=4 |year=1997 |url=http://lowselfhelpsystems.org/professionals/journal-articles-and-professional-interviews-detail.asp?id=7 |issn=1075–7082 |oclc=30118103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SOWERS1998&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sowers |first=Wesley |title=Recovery and Responsibility |journal=Community Psychiatrist |volume=12 |issue=2 |date = March 1998|url=http://www.wpic.pitt.edu/aacp/Vol-12-2/editor.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low designed his techniques for use in his organization, [[Recovery International]], which supports people recovering from mental illness.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOW1945&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Combined System of Group Psychotherapy and Self-Help as Practiced by Recovery, Inc. |journal=Sociometry |volume=8 |issue=3/4 |year=1945 |pages=94–99 |last=Low |first=Abraham |doi=10.2307/2785030 |url=http://jstor.org/stable/2785030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Recovery International was originally led by Low, he later adapted the techniques for use in lay-run self-help groups operating under the same name.&lt;ref name=&quot;WECHSLER1960&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The self-help organization in the mental health field: Recovery, Inc., a case study |journal=The Journal of nervous and mental disease |volume=130 |month=April |year=1960 |pages=297–314 |last=Wechsler |first=Henry |pmid=13843358 |oclc=13848734 |issn=0022-3018 |doi=10.1097/00005053-196004000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the period 1950 to 1970 that behavioral therapy became widely utilized, with researchers in the United States, the United Kingdom and South Africa who were inspired by the [[behaviorism|behaviorist]] learning theory of [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[John B. Watson]] and [[Clark L. Hull]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachman_1997&quot; /&gt; In Britain, this work was mostly focused on the neurotic disorders through the work of [[Joseph Wolpe]], who applied the findings of animal experiments to his method of [[systematic desensitization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = [[Stanford University Press]] |last = Wolpe | first = J |authorlink=Joseph Wolpe |title = Psychotherapy by reciprocal inhibition |year = 1958 |isbn = 0804705097}}&lt;/ref&gt; the precursor to today's fear reduction techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachman_1997&quot; /&gt; British psychologist [[Hans Eysenck]], inspired by the writings of [[Karl Popper]], criticized psychoanalysis in arguing that &quot;if you get rid of the symptoms, you get rid of the neurosis&quot;,&lt;!-- hmm, is that a direct quote? should check --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eysenck_1960&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author = Eysenck, H |authorlink=Hans Eysenck |year=1960 |title=Behavior therapy and the neuroses |publisher=Pergamon, Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presented behavior therapy as a constructive alternative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachman_1997&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eysenck_1952&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eysenck |first=H |authorlink=Hans Eysenck |year=1952 |title=The effects of psychotherapy: An evaluation |journal=Journal of Consulting Psychology |volume=16 | pages=971–982 |doi=10.1037/h0063633}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, psychologists were applying the [[radical behaviorism]] of [[B. F. Skinner]] to clinical use. Much of this work was concentrated towards severe, chronic psychiatric disorders, such as psychotic behavior&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayllon_Azrin_1968&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ayllon, T &amp; Azrin, N |title=The token economy |year=1968 |publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[autism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachman_1997&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lovaas_1951&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lovaas |first=OI |authorlink=Ole Ivar Lovaas|year=1951 |title=Interaction between verbal and non-verbal behaviour |journal=Child Development |volume=32 |pages=329–336 |pmid=13763751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- OTHER ROOTS --&gt;
Although the early behavioral approaches were successful in many of the neurotic disorders, they had little success in treating [[major depressive disorder|depression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachman_1997&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- Mention early attempts by Ferster and Lewinsohn? --&gt; Behaviorism was also losing in popularity due to the so-called &quot;[[cognitive revolution]]&quot;.&lt;!-- Kanter et al. 2007 may serve as reference --&gt; The therapeutic approaches of [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] and [[Aaron T. Beck]] gained popularity among behavior therapists, despite the earlier behaviorist rejection of &quot;[[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]]&quot; concepts like thoughts and cognitions.  Both these systems included behavioral elements and interventions and primarily concentrated on problems in the present. Albert Ellis's  system, originated in the early 1950s, was first called [[rational therapy]], and can arguably be called one of the first forms of cognitive behavioral therapy. It was partly founded as a reaction against popular psychotherapeutic theories at the time, mainly [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ellis&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ellis |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Ellis (psychologist) |title=A New Guide to Rational Living |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |year=1975 |isbn=0-13-370650-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron T. Beck, inspired by Albert Ellis, developed [[cognitive therapy]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck&quot;&gt;[[Aaron T. Beck|Beck, Aaron T.]] ''Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders''. International Universities Press Inc., 1975. ISBN 0-8236-0990-1&lt;/ref&gt;  Beck describes his therapeutic approach as originating in a realization he made while conducting [[Free association (psychology)|free association]] with patients in the context of classical psychoanalysis—he noted that patients had not been reporting certain thoughts at the fringe of consciousness, thoughts which often preceded intense emotional reactions; this realization led Beck to begin viewing emotional reactions as resulting from cognitions, rather than understanding emotion within the abstract psychoanalytic framework.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Aaron T., ''Prisoners of Hate: The Cognitive Basis of Anger, Hostility, and Violence'', Harper Collins, 1999, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive therapy rapidly became a favorite intervention technique to study in psychotherapy research in academic settings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  In initial studies, it was often contrasted with behavioral treatments to see which was most effective. During the 1980s and 1990s, cognitive and behavioral techniques were merged into cognitive behavioral therapy. Pivotal to this merging was the successful development of treatments for [[panic disorder]] by [[David M. Clark]] in the UK and [[David H. Barlow]] in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachman_1997&quot; /&gt;

Concurrently with the contributions of Ellis and Beck, starting in the late 1950s and continuing through the 1970s, [[Arnold A. Lazarus]] developed what was arguably the first form of broad-spectrum cognitive behavioral therapy.&lt;!--  introducing the terms &quot;behavior therapy&quot; and &quot;behavior therapist&quot; into the professional literature -- skagedal: my source says Eysenck introduced the term &quot;behavior therapy&quot;... --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, A. A. &quot;New methods in psychotherapy: a case study&quot;. South African Medical Journal, 1958, 32, 660–664&lt;/ref&gt; He later broadened the focus of behavioral treatment to incorporate cognitive aspects.&lt;ref name=lazarus1971&gt;{{Cite book|author=Lazarus, Arnold A. |authorlink=Arnold Lazarus|title=Behavior therapy &amp; beyond |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1971 |pages= |isbn=0-07-036800-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnold Lazarus, desiring to optimize therapy's effectiveness and effect durable treatment, cognitive and behavioral methods, developed a new form of therapy called [[multimodal therapy]], based on CBT, but also including physical sensations (as distinct from emotional states), visual images (as distinct from language-based thinking), [[interpersonal relationships]], and biological factors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Samuel Yochelson and Stanton Samenow pioneered the idea that cognitive behavioral approaches can be used successfully with a criminal population.  They are the authors of ''Criminal Personality Vol. I''.  This book has an extensive amount of information regarding the dynamics of criminal thinking and application of cognitive behavioral approaches.

==Approaches and systems==
{{See|List of cognitive–behavioral therapies}}
CBT includes a variety of approaches and therapeutic systems; some of the most well known include [[cognitive therapy]], [[rational emotive behavior therapy]] and [[multimodal therapy]]. Defining the scope of what constitutes a cognitive–behavioral therapy is a difficulty that has persisted throughout its development.&lt;ref name=&quot;dobson_ch1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author=Dobson, Keith S.; Dozois, David J. A. | editor=Dobson, Keith S. | title=Handbook of cognitive-behavioral therapies |edition=2nd| year=2001 | publisher=Guilford Press | location=New York  | isbn=1-57230-601-7 | chapter=Historical and Philosophical Bases of the Cognitive-Behavioral Therapies | pages=3–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The particular therapeutic techniques vary within the different approaches of CBT according to the particular kind of problem issues, but commonly may include keeping a diary of significant events and associated feelings, thoughts and behaviors; questioning and testing cognitions, assumptions, evaluations and beliefs that might be unhelpful and unrealistic; gradually facing activities which may have been avoided; and trying out new ways of behaving and reacting. Relaxation, [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] and distraction techniques are also commonly included. Cognitive behavioral therapy is often also used in conjunction with [[mood stabilizer|mood stabilizing]] medications to treat conditions like [[bipolar disorder]]. Its application in treating [[schizophrenia]] along with medication and family therapy is recognized by the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|NICE]] guidelines (see below) within the [[British NHS]].

Going through cognitive behavioral therapy generally is not an overnight process for clients; a typical course consists of 12-16 hour-long sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.economist.com/node/18276234 | title= Therapist-free therapy| date= March 3, 2011 | publisher= [[The Economist]] | accessdate=2011-03-08 | quote= A typical course of a modern talk therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, consists of 12-16 hour-long sessions and is a reasonably efficient way of treating conditions like depression and anxiety}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even after clients have learned to recognize when and where their mental processes go awry, it can in some cases take considerable time or effort to replace a dysfunctional cognitive-affective-behavioral process or habit with a more reasonable and adaptive one. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is problem focused and structured towards the client, it requires honesty and openness between the client and therapist, as a therapist develops strategies for managing problems and guiding the client to a better life.&lt;ref&gt;Westbrook ''et al.'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computerized ===
{{Merge from|Computerised CBT|date=November 2008|discuss=Talk:Cognitive behavioral therapy#merge_from_Computerised_CBT.3F}}
{{Main|Computerised CBT}}
There are cognitive behavioral therapy sessions in which the user interacts with computer software (either on a PC, or sometimes via a voice-activated phone service), instead of face to face with a therapist.  This can provide an option for patients, especially in light of the fact that there are not always therapists available, or the cost can be prohibitive. For people who are feeling depressed and withdrawn, the prospect of having to speak to someone about their innermost problems can be off-putting. In this respect, computerized CBT can be a good option.{{Or|date=March 2010}}

[[Randomized controlled trial]]s have proven its effectiveness, and in February 2006 the UK's [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] recommended that CCBT be made available for use within the [[National Health Service|NHS]] across England and Wales, for patients presenting with mild to moderate depression, rather than immediately opting for antidepressant medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA97 |title=Depression and anxiety - computerized cognitive behavioral therapy |accessdate=21 November 2008 |work=NICE guidance |publisher=[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] |date=22 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific applications==
CBT has been applied within many clinical and non-clinical environments and has been successfully used as a treatment for many clinical disorders, personality conditions and behavioral problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;cooper_2008&quot; /&gt; CBT is highly effective for a number of disorders and it is important to note that cognitive behavioral therapy is unlikely to be effective in treating psychiatric problems caused solely by drug or alcohol abuse. It has been argued that the treatment of such patients should be directed at tackling their substance abuse problems (ideally aiming for complete abstinence) prior to the commencement of CBT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Martinsen EW, Olsen T, Tønset E, Nyland KE, Aarre TF |title=Cognitive-behavioral group therapy for panic disorder in the general clinical setting: a naturalistic study with 1-year follow-up |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=59 |issue=8 |pages=437–442; quiz 443 |year=1998 |month=August |pmid=9721829 |doi= 10.4088/JCP.v59n0808|url= |accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Cohen SI |title=Alcohol and benzodiazepines generate anxiety, panic and phobias |journal=J R Soc Med |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=73–77 |year=1995 |month=February |pmid=7769598 |pmc=1295099 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anxiety disorders===
A basic concept in CBT treatment of anxiety disorders is ''in vivo'' [[exposure therapy|exposure]]&amp;mdash;a gradual exposure to the actual, feared [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. This treatment is based on the theory that the fear response has been [[classical conditioning|classically conditioned]] and that avoidance [[negative reinforcement|negatively reinforces]] and maintains that fear.  This &quot;two-factor&quot; model is often credited to [[Orval Hobart Mowrer|O. Hobart Mowrer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = Wiley, New York |last = Mowrer |first = OH |title = Learning theory and behavior |year = 1960 |isbn = 0882751271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through exposure to the stimulus, this conditioning can be unlearned; this is referred to as [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]] and [[habituation]]. CBT also looks at an individual's way of thinking and the way that they react to certain habits or behaviors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kozier2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Kozier|title=Fundamentals of nursing: concepts, process and practice|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_0_pRyy9McQC|accessdate=18 December 2010|year=2008|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9780131976535|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[specific phobia]], such as [[Arachnophobia|fear of spiders]], can often be treated with ''in vivo'' exposure and therapist modeling in one session.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/0005-7967(89)90113-7 | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–7 | last = Ost | first = L G | title = One-session treatment for specific phobias | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | accessdate = 2008-11-09 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2914000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Obsessive compulsive disorder]] is typically treated with [[exposure with response prevention]].

[[Social anxiety disorder|Social phobia]], also known as [[social anxiety]] has often been treated with exposure coupled with [[cognitive restructuring]], such as in Heimberg's group therapy protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Turk, CL; Heimberg, RG; Hope, DA | publisher = The Guilford Press, New York | editor = Barlow, DH | title = Clinical Handbook of Psychological Disorders: A step by step manual, 3rd ed. | year = 2001 | chapter = Social Anxiety Disorder | pages = 114–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that cognitive interventions improve the result of social phobia treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1037/0022-006X.74.3.568 | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 568–578 | last = Clark | first = David M | title = Cognitive therapy versus exposure and applied relaxation in social phobia: A randomized controlled trial | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | accessdate = 2008-11-09 | date = 2006-06 | pmid = 16822113  | last2 = Ehlers | first2 = A | last3 = Hackmann | first3 = A | last4 = McManus | first4 = F | last5 = Fennell | first5 = M | last6 = Grey | first6 = N | last7 = Waddington | first7 = L | last8 = Wild | first8 = J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBT has been shown to be effective in the treatment of [[generalized anxiety disorder]], and possibly more effective than pharmacological treatments in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S0005-7894(97)80048-2 | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 285–305 | last = Gould | first = RA | title = Cognitive behavioral and pharmacological treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: A preliminary meta-analysis | journal = Behavior Therapy | accessdate = 2008-11-08 | year = 1997 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B7XMW-4JCS59S-7/2/68c4515f717b005757a92ea0e0c7b488 | last2 = Otto | first2 = M | last3 = Pollack | first3 = M | last4 = Yap | first4 = L }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, one study of patients undergoing [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]] who had a diagnosis of [[generalized anxiety disorder]] showed that those who received CBT had a very high success rate of discontinuing benzodiazepines compared to those who did not receive CBT. This success rate was maintained at 12-month follow up. Furthermore in patients who had discontinued [[benzodiazepines]] it was found that they no longer met the diagnosis of [[general anxiety disorder]] and that patients no longer meeting the diagnosis of general anxiety disorder was higher in the group who received CBT. Thus CBT can be an effective tool to add to a gradual benzodiazepine dosage reduction program leading to improved and sustained [[mental health]] benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gosselin P, Ladouceur R, Morin CM, Dugas MJ, Baillargeon L |title=Benzodiazepine discontinuation among adults with GAD: A randomized trial of cognitive-behavioral therapy |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=74 |issue=5 |pages=908–919 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17032095 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.74.5.908 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mood disorders===
&lt;!-- ====Depression==== --&gt;
One [[etiological]] theory of depression is [[Aaron Beck]]'s cognitive theory of depression. His theory states that depressed people think the way they do because their thinking is biased towards negative interpretations. According to this theory, depressed people acquire a negative [[schema (psychology)|schema]] of the world in childhood and adolescence as an effect of stressful life events. &lt;!-- (Children and adolescents who suffer from depression acquire this negative schema earlier.)--&gt; When the person with such schemata encounters a situation that in some way resembles the conditions in which the original schema was learned, the negative schemata of the person are activated.&lt;ref name=&quot;neale_davison_p247&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Neale, John M.; Davison, Gerald C. |title=Abnormal psychology |edition=8th|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York |year=2001 |page=247 |isbn=0-471-31811-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beck also described a negative [[Beck's cognitive triad|cognitive triad]], made up of the negative schemata and cognitive biases of the person; Beck theorized that depressed individuals make negative evaluations of themselves, the world, and the future.  Depressed people, according to this theory, have views such as, &quot;I never do a good job&quot;, &quot;It is impossible to have a good day&quot;, and &quot;things will never get better.&quot; A negative schema helps give rise to the cognitive bias, and the cognitive bias helps fuel the negative schema. This is the negative triad. Also, Beck proposed that depressed people often have the following cognitive biases: arbitrary inference, selective abstraction, over-generalization, magnification and [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimization]]. These cognitive biases are quick to make negative, generalized, and personal inferences of the self, thus fueling the negative schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;neale_davison_p247&quot; /&gt;

Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown as an effective treatment for clinical depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Dobson KS |title=A meta-analysis of the efficacy of cognitive therapy for depression |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=414–9 |year=1989 |month=June |pmid=2738214 |doi= 10.1037/0022-006X.57.3.414|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large-scale study in 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Keller MB, McCullough JP, Klein DN |title=A comparison of nefazodone, the cognitive behavioral-analysis system of psychotherapy, and their combination for the treatment of chronic depression |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=342 |issue=20 |pages=1462–1470 |year=2000 |month=May |pmid=10816183 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200005183422001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed substantially higher results of response and remission (73% for combined therapy vs. 48% for either CBT or the antidepressant [[Nefazodone]] alone) when a form of cognitive behavior therapy and that particular discontinued anti-depressant drug were combined than when either modality was used alone.

For more general results confirming that CBT alone can provide lower but nonetheless valuable levels of relief from depression, and result in increased ability for the patient to remain in employment, see ''The Depression Report'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Depression Report: A New Deal for Depression and Anxiety Disorders |publisher=The Centre for Economic Performance's Mental Health Policy Group |url=http://cep.lse.ac.uk/research/mentalhealth/default.asp |date=2006-06-19 |accessdate=2006-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which states:
100 people attend up to sixteen weekly sessions one-on-one lasting one hour each, some will drop out but within four months 50 people will have lost their psychiatric symptoms.

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] Practice Guidelines (April 2000) indicated that among psychotherapeutic approaches, cognitive behavioral therapy and [[interpersonal psychotherapy]] had the best-documented efficacy for treatment of major depressive disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychiatryonline.com/pracGuide/pracGuideChapToc_7.aspx |title=Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Major Depressive Disorder, Second Edition |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |year=2000 |accessdate=2008-12-01 | doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890423363.48690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently some CBT practitioners have returned to more behavioral approaches to the treatment of depression such as [[behavioral activation]]. A large-scale treatment study found behavioral activation to be more effective than cognitive therapy and on a par with medication for treating depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Dimidjian, S., et al. |year=2006 |title=Randomized Trial of Behavioral Activation, Cognitive Therapy, and Antidepressant Medication in the Acute Treatment of Adults With Major Depression |journal=[[Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology]] |volume=74 |pages=658–670 |pmid=16881773 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.74.4.658 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insomnia===
[[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia]] (CBT-I) has been found to be effective in reducing [[benzodiazepine]] usage in the treatment of [[insomnia]]. A large-scale trial utilizing CBT-I for chronic users of sedative hypnotics including [[nitrazepam]], [[temazepam]] and [[zopiclone]] found the addition of CBT-I to improve outcome and reduce drug consumption in the treatment of chronic insomnia. Persisting improvements in sleep quality, [[sleep latency]], and increased total sleep, as well as improvements in sleep efficiency and significant improvements in vitality and physical and mental health at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups were found in those receiving cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia with hypnotics compared with those patients receiving hypnotics alone. A marked reduction in total sedative hypnotic drug use was found in those receiving CBT-I, with 33% reporting no hypnotic drug use. Authors of the study suggested that CBT-I is potentially a flexible, practical, and cost-effective treatment for the treatment of insomnia and that CBT-I administered coincident to hypnotic treatment leads to a reduction of benzodiazepine drug intake in a significant number of patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Morgan K |year=2004 |month=February |title=Psychological treatment for insomnia in the regulation of long-term hypnotic drug use |journal=Health Technol Assess |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=1–68 |publisher=National Institute for Health Research |pmid=14960254 |url=http://www.hta.ac.uk/fullmono/mon808.pdf |format=PDF |last2=Dixon |first2=S |last3=Mathers |first3=N |last4=Thompson |first4=J |last5=Tomeny |first5=M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic use of hypnotic medications is not recommended due to their adverse effects on health and the risk of [[drug dependence|dependence]]. A gradual taper is usual clinical course in getting people off benzodiazepines but even with gradual reduction a large proportion of people fail to stop taking benzodiazepines. The elderly are particularly sensitive to the adverse effects of [[hypnotic]] medications. A clinical trial in elderly people dependent on [[benzodiazepine]] hypnotics showed that the addition of CBT-I to a gradual benzodiazepine reduction program increased the success rate of discontinuing benzodiazepine [[hypnotic]] drugs from 38% to 77% and at 12-month follow-up from 24% to 70%. The paper concluded that CBT-I is an effective tool for reducing [[hypnotic]] use in the elderly and reducing the adverse health effects that are associated with hypnotics such as [[drug dependence]], cognitive impairments and increased road traffic accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Baillargeon L, Landreville P, Verreault R, Beauchemin JP, Grégoire JP, Morin CM |title=Discontinuation of benzodiazepines among older insomniac adults treated with cognitive-behavioural therapy combined with gradual tapering: a randomized trial |journal=CMAJ |volume=169 |issue=10 |pages=1015–20 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14609970 |pmc=236226 |doi= |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/169/10/1015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further study in older people with insomnia comparing the [[hypnotic]] drug [[zopiclone]] against [[CBT-I]] found that CBT-I actually improved [[EEG]] slow wave sleep as well as increased time spent asleep and found that the benefits were maintained at 6-month follow-up. [[Zopiclone]] however worsened sleep by suppressing [[slow wave sleep]]. A lack of slow wave sleep is linked to impaired functioning and sleepiness. [[Zopiclone]] reduced slow wave sleep and was similar to placebo in that it produced no lasting benefits after treatment had finished and at 6-month follow-up while CBT-I did have significant lasting benefits. The authors stated that CBT-I was superior to [[zopiclone]] both in the short term and in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sivertsen B, Omvik S, Pallesen S |title=Cognitive behavioral therapy vs [[zopiclone]] for treatment of chronic primary insomnia in older adults: a randomized controlled trial |journal=JAMA |volume=295 |issue=24 |pages=2851–8 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16804151 |doi=10.1001/jama.295.24.2851 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/295/24/2851}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison of CBT-I and the [[hypnotic]] drug zolpidem ([[Ambien]]) found similar results with CBT-I showing superiority and sustained benefits after long term follow up. Interestingly the addition of CBT-I and zolpidem offered no benefit over CBT-I alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=KARL E. MILLER, M.D. |title=Cognitive Behavior Therapy vs. Pharmacotherapy for Insomnia |journal=American Family Physician |year=2005 |month=July |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/0715/p330.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Severe mental disorders===
Several meta-analyses have shown CBT effective in [[schizophrenia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wykes T, Steel C, Everitt B, Tarrier N |title=Cognitive behavior therapy for schizophrenia: effect sizes, clinical models, and methodological rigor |journal=Schizophr Bull |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=523–537 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=17962231 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm114 |url= |pmc=2632426}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Psychiatric Association]] includes CBT in its schizophrenia guideline as an evidence-based treatment. There is also some limited evidence of effectiveness for CBT in [[bipolar disorder]] and severe [[Clinical depression|depression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kingdon&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kingdon D and Price J|title=Cognitive-behavioral Therapy in Severe Mental Illness |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=26 |issue=5 |date=April 17, 2009 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/paranoia/article/10168/1406055?pageNumber=2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a 2010 article in Psychological Medicine entitled, &quot;Cognitive behavioral therapy for the major psychiatric disorder: does it really work?&quot;,[http://journals.cambridge.org/cogtherapy] the authors found that no trial employing both blinding and psychological placebo has found CBT to be effective in schizophrenia. The authors also found few well-controlled studies of CBT in depression that found the therapy to be effective, and in those found, the effect was small. CBT is also ineffective in preventing relapses in bipolar disorder.

===Children and adolescents===
The use of CBT has been extended to children and adolescents with positive results. CBT is one of the few empirically-supported psychosocial treatments for young people {{Cite web|title=CBT for Children and Adolescents| url=http://www.abct.org/sccap/?m=sPublic&amp;fa=pub_WhatIsCBT}} It is often used to treat [[major depressive disorder]], anxiety disorders, and symptoms related to trauma and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. Significant work has been done in this area by Mark Reinecke and his colleagues at Northwestern University in the [[Clinical Psychology]] program in [[Chicago]]. [[Paula Barrett]] and her colleagues have also validated CBT as effective in a group setting for the treatment of youth and child anxiety using the [[Friends Program]] she authored. This CBT program has been recognized as best practice for the treatment of anxiety in children by the [[World Health Organization]]. CBT has been used with children and adolescents to treat a variety of conditions with good success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Child and Adolescent Therapy: Cognitive-Behavioral Procedures|editor=Kendall, Philip C. (ed).|publisher=Guilford Press| date=2005-12-05| edition=3rd| isbn=1-59385-113-8| author=Philip C.

Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies for children and adolescents usually are short-term treatments (i.e., often between 6-20 sessions) that focus on teaching young people and their parents specific skills. CBT is different from many other therapy approaches by focusing on the ways that a person's cognitions (i.e., thoughts), emotions, and behaviors are connected and how they affect one another. Because emotions, thoughts, and behaviors are all linked, CBT approaches allow for therapists to intervene at different points in the cycle. Though approaches can differ somewhat, they have the following in common &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title= What is CBT? |url=http://www.abct.org/sccap/?m=sPublic&amp;fa=pub_WhatIsCBT}}&lt;/ref&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
* The therapist and child or adolescent client develop goals for therapy together, often in close collaboration with parents, and track progress toward goals throughout the course of treatment.&lt;br&gt;
* The therapist and client work together with a mutual understanding that the therapist has theoretical and technical expertise, but the client is the expert on him- or herself.&lt;br&gt;
* The therapist seeks to help the client discover that he/she is powerful and capable of choosing positive thoughts and behaviors.&lt;br&gt;
* Treatment is often short-term. Clients actively participate in treatment in and out of session. Homework assignments often are included in therapy. The skills that are taught in these therapies require practice.&lt;br&gt;
* Treatment is goal-oriented to resolve present-day problems. Therapy involves working step-by-step to achieve goals.

==Applied to stuttering==
Cognitive behavioral therapy is increasingly being used to help people who stutter or stammer, to overcome anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stutteringhelp.org/default.aspx?tabindex=693&amp;tabid=706&lt;/ref&gt; CBT teaches people to analyze how unhelpful thoughts may be contributing to their anxieties, {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} which can cause avoidance behaviors, and further stuttering. People can then learn to challenge such thoughts. It can also be used to help people who stutter change negative beliefs about themselves into positive ones.

Such therapy can usually be obtained through speech and language therapists, trained in CBT. More recently, techniques offered by CBT are now available through computerized methods,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA97&lt;/ref&gt; including online approaches such as ''Speech Bloom'', which is a study program for stuttering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.speechbloom.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complex trauma==

==Research==
{{Expand section|date=December 2010}}
Cognitive behavioral therapy most closely allies with the [[scientist–practitioner model]], in which clinical practice and research is informed by a scientific perspective, clear [[operationalization]] of the problem, an emphasis on [[measurement]] (and measurable changes in cognition and behavior) and measurable goal-attainment.

Effective cognitive behavioral therapy is also dependent on a therapeutic alliance between the health care practitioner and the person seeking assistance. (See [[Therapeutic relationship]])

==Criticism==
CBT has come under fire from non-CBT therapists who claim that the data does not fully support the extent of attention and funding it receives nor its extension beyond psychotherapy into matters such as reducing unemployment, and that the limitations of the CBT model when used to blanket-address psychological suffering are unrecognized. Psychotherapist and professor [[Andrew Samuels]] stated that this constitutes &quot;a coup, a power play by a community that has suddenly found itself on the brink of corralling an enormous amount of money. Science isn't the appropriate perspective from which to look at emotional difficulties. Everyone has been seduced by CBT's apparent cheapness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/the-big-question-can-cognitive-behavioural-therapy-help-people-with-eating-disorders-1128229.html|date=2008-12-16|accessdate=2009-01-13|title=The Big Question: Can Cognitive Behavioural Therapy help people with eating disorders?|work=[[The Independent]]|author=Jeremy Laurance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presenters at a psychotherapy conference at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in July, 2008 criticized the increased spending on CBT and the widespread belief that CBT is more effective than other forms of psychotherapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;conf1&quot;&gt;[http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2008/july/CBT+superiority+questioned+at+conference CBT superiority questioned at conference] Retrieved on 2009-4-18&lt;/ref&gt;  In this conference professors Mick Cooper and Robert Elliott (both at University of Strathclyde), William B Stiles (Miami University) and Art Bohart (Saybrook University) issued a joint statement, which briefly stated:
*As more research focuses on CBT, more studies are published on CBT.  This reinforces the logical error that CBT is superior and this has a direct negative effect on other forms of therapy, which are well documented but have smaller bodies of research.
*People who get therapy improve substantially, regardless of the type of therapy they get. When therapies are compared to one another, they usually appear to be equally effective.
*Excessive spending on CBT and discouraging other forms of therapy hurts the public.

At the same conference,&lt;ref name=&quot;conf1&quot; /&gt; professors Robert Elliott and Beth Freire presented their unpublished meta-analysis of more than 80 studies where [[person-centered psychotherapy]] was shown to be as effective as other forms of psychotherapy, including CBT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Person-Centred Experiential Therapies Are Highly Effective: Summary of the 2008 Meta-analysis |author=Robert Elliott &amp; Beth Freire.|accessdate=2009-05-01|url=http://www.bapca.co.uk/uploads/files/Meta-Summary091708.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About one-fifth of the world’s population, or over one [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] people, speaks some variety of Chinese as their [[native language]]. [[Varieties of Chinese|Internal divisions of Chinese]] are usually perceived by their native speakers as [[dialects]] of a single Chinese language, rather than separate languages, although [[identification of the varieties of Chinese|this identification]] is considered inappropriate by some linguists and Sinologists.&lt;ref name=Mair&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp029_chinese_dialect.pdf|journal=Sino-Platonic Papers|last=Mair|first=Victor H.|authorlink=Victor H. Mair|title=What Is a Chinese &quot;Dialect/Topolect&quot;? Reflections on Some Key Sino-English Linguistic Terms|year=1991|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese is distinguished by its high level of internal diversity, although all [[varieties of Chinese]] are [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]] and [[Analytic language|analytic]]. There are between 7 and 13 main regional groups of Chinese (depending on classification scheme), of which the most spoken, by far, is [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] (about 850 million), followed by [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] (90 million), [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese (Yue)]] (70 million) and [[Min Chinese|Min]] (50 million). Most of these groups are mutually unintelligible, although some, like [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]] and the Southwest Mandarin dialects, may share common terms and some degree of intelligibility.

[[Standard Chinese]] ''(Putonghua / Guoyu / Huayu)'' is a standardized form of spoken Chinese  based on the [[Beijing dialect]] of [[Mandarin Chinese]], referred to as {{lang|zh|官话}}/{{lang|zh|官話}} ''Guānhuà'' or {{lang|zh|北方话}}/{{lang|zh|北方話}} ''Běifānghuà'' in Chinese. Standard Chinese is the official language of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the [[Republic of China]] (ROC, also known as [[Taiwan]]), as well as one of four official languages of [[Singapore]]. It is one of the six official languages of the [[United Nations]]. Of the other varieties of Chinese, [[Cantonese]] is influential in Guangdong Province and Cantonese-speaking overseas communities, and remains one of the official languages of [[Hong Kong]] (together with [[English language|English]]) and of [[Macau]] (together with [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]). [[Min Nan]], part of the Min language group, is widely spoken in southern [[Fujian]], in neighbouring Taiwan (where it is known as [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] or Hoklo) and in [[Southeast Asia]] (known as [[Hokkien]] in [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]).  There are also sizeable [[Hakka language|Hakka]] and [[Shanghainese]] [[diaspora]], for example in Taiwan, where most Hakka communities maintain [[diglossia]] by being conversant in Taiwanese and Standard Chinese.

There are groups that are not yet classified, such as: [[Danzhou dialect]] ({{lang|zh|儋州话}}/{{lang|zh|儋州話}}), spoken in [[Danzhou]], on [[Hainan]] Island; [[Xianghua]] ({{lang|zh|乡话}}/{{lang|zh|鄉話}}), not to be confused with Xiang ({{lang|zh|湘}}), spoken in western [[Hunan]]; and [[Shaozhou Tuhua]] ({{lang|zh|韶州土话}}/{{lang|zh|韶州土話}}), spoken in northern [[Guangdong]]. The [[Dungan language]], spoken in [[Central Asia]], is very closely related to Mandarin. However, it is politically not generally considered &quot;Chinese&quot; since it is written in [[Cyrillic]] and spoken by [[Dungan people]] outside [[China]] who are not considered ethnic [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]].

In general, the above language-dialect groups do not have sharp boundaries, though Mandarin is the predominant Sinitic language in the North and the Southwest, and the rest are mostly spoken in Central or Southeastern China. Frequently, as in the case of the [[Guangdong]] province, native speakers of major variants overlapped. As with many areas that were linguistically diverse for a long time, it is not always clear how the speeches of various parts of China should be classified. The [[Ethnologue]] lists a total of [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90151 14], but the number varies between seven and 17 depending on the classification scheme followed. For instance, the Min variety is often divided into Northern Min (Minbei, Fuchow) and Southern Min (Minnan, Amoy-Swatow); linguists have not determined whether their mutual intelligibility is small enough to sort them as separate languages.

Generally, mountainous South China displays more linguistic diversity than the flat North China. In parts of South China, a major city's dialect may only be marginally intelligible to close neighbours. For instance, [[Wuzhou]] is about 120 miles upstream from [[Guangzhou]], but its dialect is more like that of Guangzhou than is that of [[Taishan]], 60 miles southwest of Guangzhou and separated by several rivers from it (Ramsey, 1987).

===Standard Chinese and diglossia===
{{Main|Standard Chinese}}
&lt;!--This is a SUMMARY. Please add new information to [[Standard Mandarin]].--&gt;
[[Standard Chinese|Putonghua / Guoyu]], often called &quot;Mandarin&quot;, is the official [[standard language]] used by the [[People's Republic of China]], the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), and [[Singapore]] (where it is called &quot;Huayu&quot;). It is based on the [[Beijing dialect]], which is the dialect of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] as spoken in [[Beijing]]. The government intends for speakers of all Chinese speech varieties to use it as a common language of communication. Therefore it is used in government agencies, in the media, and as a language of instruction in schools.

In [[mainland China]] and Taiwan, [[diglossia]] has been a common feature: it is common for a Chinese to be able to speak two or even three varieties of the Sinitic languages (or “dialects”) together with Standard Chinese. For example, in addition to ''putonghua'' a resident of [[Shanghai]] might speak [[Shanghainese dialect|Shanghainese]] and, if they did not grow up there, his or her local dialect as well. A native of [[Guangzhou]] may speak Cantonese and ''putonghua'', a resident of Taiwan, both [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] and ''putonghua/guoyu''. A person living in [[Taiwan]] may commonly mix pronunciations, phrases, and words from Mandarin and [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]], and this mixture is considered normal under many circumstances. In Hong Kong, Mandarin is beginning to take its place beside English and Cantonese, the other official languages.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Linguistics===
&lt;!--This is a SUMMARY. Please do not change info here w/o discussion as it is deemed fairly objective--&gt;
Linguists often view Chinese as a [[language family]], though owing to China's socio-political and cultural situation, and the fact that all spoken varieties use one common written system, it is customary to refer to these generally mutually unintelligible variants as &quot;the Chinese language&quot;. The diversity of Sinitic variants is comparable to the [[Romance languages]].

From a purely [[Linguistic prescription|descriptive]] point of view, &quot;languages&quot; and &quot;dialects&quot; are simply arbitrary groups of similar idiolects, and the distinction is irrelevant to linguists who are only concerned with describing regional speeches technically. However, the idea of a single language has major overtones in politics and cultural self-identity, and explains the amount of emotion over this issue. Most Chinese and Chinese linguists refer to Chinese as a single language and its subdivisions dialects, while others call Chinese a language family.

Chinese itself has a term for its unified writing system, ''Zhongwen'' ({{lang|zh|中文}}), while the closest equivalent used to describe its spoken variants would be ''Hanyu'' ({{lang|zh|汉语}}/{{lang|zh|漢語}}, &quot;spoken language[s] of the [[Han Chinese]]&quot;)—this term could be translated to either &quot;language&quot; or &quot;languages&quot; since Chinese possesses no [[grammatical number]]s. For centuries in China, owing to the widespread use of a written standard in [[Classical Chinese]], there is much less necessity to maintain a uniform speech-and-writing continuum, as indicated by the employment of two separate character morphemes {{lang|zh|语}}/{{lang|zh|語}} ''yu'' and {{lang|zh|文}} ''wen''. The character morphemes used in [[written Chinese]] are [[logograph]]s that convey semantics graphically rather than [[phonology|phonologically]], although some logographs are compounds conveying both semantic meaning (the &quot;radical&quot;) and phonological information.

Ethnic Chinese often consider these spoken variations as one single language for reasons of [[nationality]] and as they inherit one common cultural and linguistic heritage in [[Classical Chinese]]. Han native speakers of Wu, Min, Hakka, and Cantonese, for instance, may consider their own linguistic varieties as separate spoken languages, but the [[Han Chinese]] as one—albeit internally very diverse—ethnicity. To Chinese nationalists, the idea of Chinese as a language family may suggest that the Chinese identity is much more fragmented and disunified than it actually is and as such is often looked upon as culturally and politically provocative. Additionally, in [[Taiwan]], it is closely associated with [[Taiwanese independence]], where some supporters of Taiwanese independence promote the local Taiwanese [[Minnan]]-based spoken language.

Within the People's Republic of China and Singapore, it is common for the government to refer to all divisions of the Sinitic language(s) beside Standard Chinese as ''fangyan'' (“regional tongues”, often translated as &quot;[[dialect]]s&quot;). Modern-day Chinese speakers of all kinds communicate using [[Vernacular Chinese|one formal standard written language]], although this modern written standard is modeled after Mandarin, generally the modern Beijing dialect.

===Language and nationality===
The term '''sinophone''', coined in analogy to [[English-speaking world|anglophone]] and [[francophone]], refers to those who speak the Chinese language natively, or prefer it as a medium of communication. The term is derived from [[Sinae]], the Latin word for ancient China.

==Writing==
{{Main|Written Chinese}}
&lt;!--This is a SUMMARY.--&gt;

The relationship between the Chinese spoken and written language is rather complex. Its spoken varieties evolved at different rates, while written Chinese itself has changed much less. [[Classical Chinese]] [[literature]] began in the [[Spring and Autumn period]], although written records have been discovered as far back as the 14th to 11th centuries BCE [[Shang dynasty]] [[oracle bone]]s using the [[oracle bone script]]s.

The Chinese [[orthography]] centers on Chinese characters, ''hanzi'', which are written within imaginary rectangular blocks, traditionally arranged in vertical columns, read from top to bottom down a column, and right to left across columns. Chinese characters are [[morpheme]]s independent of phonetic change. Thus the number &quot;one&quot;, ''yi'' in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], ''jat'' in [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] and ''chi̍t'' in [[Hokkien dialect|Hokkien]] (form of Min), all share an identical character (&quot;一&quot;). Vocabularies from different major Chinese variants have diverged, and colloquial non-standard written Chinese often makes use of unique &quot;dialectal characters&quot;, such as 冇 and 係 for [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], which are considered archaic or unused in standard written Chinese.

Written colloquial Cantonese has become quite popular in online [[chat room]]s and [[instant messaging]] amongst Hong-Kongers and Cantonese-speakers elsewhere. Use of it is considered highly informal, and does not extend to many formal occasions.

In [[Hunan]], women in certain areas write their local language in [[Nü Shu]], a [[syllabary]] derived from [[Chinese character]]s. The [[Dungan language]], considered by many a dialect of Mandarin, is nowadays written in [[Cyrillic]], and was previously written in the [[Arabic alphabet]]. The [[Dungan people]] live outside [[China]].

===Chinese characters===
{{Main|Chinese character}}
&lt;!--This is a SUMMARY. Please add new information to [[Chinese character]].--&gt;

Chinese characters evolved over time from earlier forms of [[hieroglyph]]s. The idea that all Chinese characters are either [[pictograph]]s or [[ideograph]]s is an erroneous one: most characters contain phonetic parts, and are composites of phonetic components and semantic [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]]. Only the simplest characters, such as ''ren'' 人 (human), ''ri'' 日 (sun), ''shan'' 山 (mountain; hill), ''shui'' 水 (water), may be wholly pictorial in origin. In 100 CE, the famed scholar [[Xu Shen|''Xǔ Shèn'']] in the [[Han Dynasty|Hàn Dynasty]] classified characters into six categories, namely pictographs, simple ideographs, compound ideographs, phonetic loans, phonetic compounds and derivative characters. Of these, only 4% were categorized as pictographs, and 80–90% as phonetic complexes consisting of a ''semantic'' element that indicates meaning, and a ''phonetic'' element that indicates the pronunciation. There are about 214 radicals recognized in the [[Kangxi Dictionary]].

Modern characters are styled after the [[kaishu|regular script]] (楷书／楷書 ''kǎishū'') (see styles, below). Various other written styles are also used in [[East Asian calligraphy]], including [[seal script]] (篆书／篆書 zhuànshū), [[cursive script (East Asia)|cursive script]] (草书／草書 cǎoshū) and [[clerical script]] (隶书／隸書 lìshū). Calligraphy artists can write in traditional and simplified characters, but tend to use traditional characters for traditional art.
[[File:XingshuLantingxv.jpg|thumb|250px|&quot;[[Lantingji Xu|Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion]]&quot; by [[Wang Xizhi]], written in [[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive style]]]]

There are currently two systems for Chinese characters. The [[Traditional Chinese character|traditional system]], still used in [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], [[Macau]] and Chinese speaking communities (except [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]) outside [[mainland China]], takes its form from standardized character forms dating back to the late [[Han dynasty]]. The [[Simplified Chinese character]] system, developed by the People's Republic of China in 1954 to promote mass [[literacy]], simplifies most complex traditional [[glyph]]s to fewer strokes, many to common ''[[caoshu]]'' [[shorthand]] variants.

[[Singapore]], which has a large Chinese community, is the first—and at present the only—foreign nation to officially adopt simplified characters, although it has also become the ''de facto'' standard for younger ethnic Chinese in [[Malaysia]]. The [[Internet]] provides the platform to practice reading the alternative system, be it traditional or simplified.

A well-educated Chinese reader today recognizes approximately 5,000–7,000 characters; approximately 3,000 characters are required to read a [[Newspapers of the People's Republic of China|Mainland newspaper]]. The PRC government defines literacy amongst workers as a knowledge of 2,000 characters, though this would be only functional literacy. A large unabridged [[dictionary]], like the [[Kangxi Dictionary]], contains over 40,000 characters, including obscure, variant, rare, and archaic characters; fewer than a quarter of these characters are now commonly used.

==History==
{{History of China}}

{{Main|History of the Chinese language}}
Most linguists classify all varieties of modern spoken Chinese as part of the Sino-Tibetan [[language family]] and believe that there was an original language, termed [[Proto-Sino-Tibetan]], from which the Sinitic and Tibeto-Burman languages descended. The relation between Chinese and other Sino-Tibetan languages is an area of active research, as is the attempt to reconstruct Proto-Sino-Tibetan. The main difficulty in this effort is that, while there is enough documentation to allow one to reconstruct the ancient Chinese sounds, there is no written documentation that records the division between Proto-Sino-Tibetan and ancient Chinese. In addition, many of the older languages that would allow us to reconstruct Proto-Sino-Tibetan are very poorly understood and many of the techniques developed for analysis of the descent of the ([[fusional language|fusional]]) Indo-European languages from [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] do not apply to Chinese, an [[isolating language]] because of &quot;[[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] paucity&quot; especially after Old Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://languageserver.uni-graz.at/ls/mat?id=1181&amp;type=m Analysis of the concept &quot;wave&quot; in PST.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Categorization of the development of Chinese is a subject of scholarly debate. One of the first systems was devised by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] linguist [[Bernhard Karlgren]] in the early 1900s; most present systems rely heavily on Karlgren's insights and methods.

[[Old Chinese]], sometimes known as &quot;Archaic Chinese&quot;, was the language common during the early and middle [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1122 BCE–256 BCE), texts of which include inscriptions on bronze artifacts, the poetry of the ''[[Shijing|Shījīng]],'' the history of the ''[[Shujing|Shūjīng]],'' and portions of the ''[[Yijing|Yìjīng]]'' (''I Ching''). The phonetic elements found in the majority of Chinese characters provide hints to their Old Chinese pronunciations. The pronunciation of the borrowed Chinese characters in Japanese, Vietnamese and Korean also provide valuable insights. Old Chinese was not wholly uninflected. It possessed a rich sound system in which [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] or rough breathing differentiated the consonants, but probably was still without tones. Work on reconstructing Old Chinese started with [[Qing dynasty|Qīng dynasty]] [[philologist]]s.
Some early [[Indo-European]] loan-words in Chinese have been proposed, notably [[:wikt:蜜|蜜]] ''mì'' &quot;honey&quot;, [[:wikt:獅|獅]] ''shī'' &quot;lion,&quot; and perhaps also [[:wikt:馬|馬]] ''mǎ'' &quot;horse&quot;, [[:wikt:犬|犬]] ''quǎn'' &quot;dog&quot;, and [[:wikt:鵝|鵝]] ''é'' &quot;goose&quot;. The source says the reconstructions of old Chinese are tentative, and not definitive so no conclusions should be drawn. The reconstruction of Old Chinese can not be perfect so this hypothesis may be called into question.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] s.v. &quot;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-75039/Chinese-languages Chinese languages]&quot;: &quot;Old Chinese vocabulary already contained many words not generally occurring in the other Sino-Tibetan languages. The words for ‘honey' and ‘lion,' and probably also ‘horse,' ‘dog,' and ‘goose,' are connected with Indo-European and were acquired through trade and early contacts. (The nearest known Indo-European languages were Tocharian and Sogdian, a middle Iranian language.) A number of words have Austroasiatic cognates and point to early contacts with the ancestral language of Muong-Vietnamese and Mon-Khmer&quot;; Jan Ulenbrook, ''Einige Übereinstimmungen zwischen dem Chinesischen und dem Indogermanischen'' (1967) proposes 57 items; see also Tsung-tung Chang, 1988 [http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp007_old_chinese.pdf Indo-European Vocabulary in Old Chinese];.&lt;/ref&gt; The source also notes that southern dialects of Chinese have more monosyllabic words than the Mandarin Chinese dialects.

[[Middle Chinese]] was the language used during [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] and the [[Sui dynasty|Suí]], [[Tang dynasty|Táng]], and [[Song dynasty|Sòng]] dynasties (6th through 10th centuries CE). It can be divided into an early period, reflected by the &quot;[[Qieyun|Qiēyùn]]&quot; [[rime book]] (601 CE), and a late period in the 10th century, reflected by the &quot;[[Guangyun|Guǎngyùn]]&quot; [[rime book]]. Linguists are more confident of having reconstructed how Middle Chinese sounded. The evidence for the pronunciation of Middle Chinese comes from several sources: modern dialect variations, rhyming dictionaries, foreign transliterations, &quot;rhyming tables&quot; constructed by ancient Chinese philologists to summarize the phonetic system, and Chinese phonetic translations of foreign words. However, all reconstructions are tentative; some scholars have argued that trying to reconstruct, say, modern Cantonese from modern [[Cantopop]] rhymes would give a fairly inaccurate picture of the present-day spoken language.

The development of the spoken Chinese languages from early historical times to the present has been complex. Most Chinese people, in [[Sichuan|Sìchuān]] and in a broad arc from the north-east ([[Manchuria]]) to the south-west ([[Yunnan]]), use various Mandarin dialects as their [[home language]]. The prevalence of Mandarin throughout northern China is largely due to north China's plains. By contrast, the mountains and rivers of middle and southern China promoted linguistic diversity.

Until the mid-20th century, most southern Chinese only spoke their native local variety of Chinese. As Nanjing was the [[Capital (political)|capital]] during the early [[Ming Dynasty]], Nanjing Mandarin became dominant at least until the later years of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. Since the 17th century, the Qing Dynasty had set up [[orthoepy]] academies (正音书院／正音書院; Zhèngyīn Shūyuàn) to make pronunciation conform to the standard of the capital Beijing. For the general population, however, this had limited effect. The non-Mandarin speakers in southern China also continued to use their various languages for every aspect of life. The Beijing Mandarin court standard was used solely by officials and civil servants and was thus fairly limited.

This situation did not change until the mid-20th century with the creation (in both the PRC and the ROC, but not in Hong Kong) of a compulsory educational system committed to teaching Mandarin. As a result, Mandarin is now spoken by virtually all young and middle-aged citizens of [[mainland China]] and on [[Taiwan]]. [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], not Mandarin, was used in [[Hong Kong]] during the time of its British colonial period (owing to its large Cantonese native and migrant populace) and remains today its official language of education, formal speech, and daily life, but Mandarin is becoming increasingly influential after the [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|1997 handover]].

Classical Chinese was once the [[lingua franca]] in neighbouring East Asian countries such as [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] for centuries, before the rise of European influences in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;*Sheng Ding and Robert A. Saunders, ''Talking Up China: An Analysis of China's Rising Cultural Power and Global Promotion of the Chinese Language'' EASTASIA, Summer 2006, Vol. 23, No. 2, pp. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Throughout history [[Chinese culture]] and politics has had a great influence on unrelated languages such as [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Korean and Japanese both have writing systems employing [[Chinese character]]s (''hanzi''), which are called [[Hanja]] and [[Kanji]], respectively.

The Vietnamese term for Chinese writing is [[Hán tự]]. It was the only available method for writing Vietnamese until the 14th century, used almost exclusively by Chinese-educated Vietnamese élites. From the 14th to the late 19th century, Vietnamese was written with [[Chữ nôm]], a modified Chinese script incorporating sounds and syllables for native Vietnamese speakers. Chữ nôm was completely replaced by a modified Latin script created by the [[Jesuit]] missionary priest [[Alexander de Rhodes]], which incorporates a system of [[diacritical mark]]s to indicate tones, as well as modified consonants. Approximately 60% of the modern Vietnamese lexicon is recognized as [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Hán-Việt (Sino-Vietnamese)]], the majority of which was borrowed from Middle Chinese.

In [[South Korea]], the [[Hangul]] alphabet is generally used, but [[Hanja]] is used as a sort of boldface. In [[North Korea]], [[Hanja]] has been discontinued. Since the modernization of Japan in the late 19th century, there has been debate about abandoning the use of Chinese characters, but the practical benefits of a radically new script have so far not been considered sufficient.

Derived Chinese characters or [[Zhuang logogram]]s are used to write [[Zhuang language|Zhuang]] songs, even though Zhuang is not a Chinese dialect. Since the 1950s, the Zhuang language has been written in a modified Latin alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou, Minglang: ''Multilingualism in China: The Politics of Writing Reforms for Minority Languages, 1949–2002'' (Walter de Gruyter 2003); ISBN 3-11-017896-6; pp.&amp;nbsp;251–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

Languages within the influence of Chinese culture also have a very large number of [[loanword]]s from Chinese.

Loan words from Chinese also exist in European languages such as English. Examples of such words are &quot;[[tea]]&quot; from the Minnan pronunciation of 茶 ([[POJ]]: tê), &quot;[[ketchup]]&quot; from the Cantonese pronunciation of 茄汁 (Jyutping: ke2 zap1) and &quot;[[kumquat]]&quot; from the Cantonese pronunciation of 金橘 (Jyutping: gam1 gwat1).

==Phonology==
{{IPA notice}}
{{Main|Chinese spoken language}}

The [[phonology|phonological]] structure of each syllable consists of a [[syllable nucleus|nucleus]] consisting of a [[vowel]] (which can be a [[monophthong]], [[diphthong]], or even a [[triphthong]] in certain varieties) with an optional [[syllable onset|onset]] or [[syllable coda|coda]] [[consonant]] as well as a [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. There are some instances where a vowel is not used as a nucleus. An example of this is in [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]], where the [[nasal consonant|nasal]] [[sonorant]] consonants {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}} can stand alone as their own syllable.

Across all the spoken varieties, most syllables tend to be open syllables, meaning they have no coda, but syllables that do have codas are restricted to {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/k/}}, or {{IPA|/ʔ/}}. Some varieties allow most of these codas, whereas others, such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], are limited to only two, namely {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}}. [[Consonant cluster]]s do not generally occur in either the onset or coda. The onset may be an [[affricate consonant|affricate]] or a consonant followed by a [[semivowel]], but these are not generally considered consonant clusters. 

The number of sounds in the different spoken dialects varies, but in general there has been a tendency to a reduction in sounds from [[Middle Chinese]]. The Mandarin dialects in particular have experienced a dramatic decrease in sounds and so have far more multisyllabic words than most other spoken varieties. The total number of syllables in some varieties is therefore only about a thousand, including tonal variation, which is only about an eighth as many as English.&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis (1984) p.42 counts Chinese as having 1,277 tonal syllables, and about 398 to 418 if tones are disregarded; he cites Jespersen, Otto (1928) Monosyllabism in English; London, p.15 for a count of over 8000 syllables for English.&lt;/ref&gt;

All varieties of spoken Chinese use [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]. A few dialects of north China may have as few as three tones, while some dialects in south China have up to 6 or 10 tones, depending on how one counts. One exception from this is [[Shanghainese dialect|Shanghainese]] which has reduced the set of tones to a two-toned [[pitch accent]] system much like modern Japanese.

A very common example used to illustrate the use of tones in Chinese are four tones of [[Standard Chinese]] applied to the syllable &quot;ma.&quot; The tones correspond to these five [[Chinese character|characters]]:
{{Ruby notice}}
* {{Ruby-zh-p|妈／媽|mā}} &quot;mother&quot;—'''high level'''
* {{Ruby-zh-p|麻|má}} &quot;linen&quot; or &quot;numb&quot;—'''high rising'''
* {{Ruby-zh-p|马／馬|mǎ}} &quot;horse&quot;—'''low falling-rising'''
* {{Ruby-zh-p|骂／罵|mà}} &quot;scold&quot;—'''high falling'''
* {{Ruby-zh-p|吗／嗎|ma}} &quot;question particle&quot;—'''neutral'''

{{Listen|filename=zh-pinyin_tones_with_ma.ogg|title=Listen to the tones|description=This is a recording of the four main tones. Fifth, or neutral, tone is not included.}}

==Phonetic transcriptions==
The Chinese had no uniform phonetic transcription system until the mid-20th century, although enunciation patterns were recorded in early [[rime book]]s and dictionaries. Early [[India]]n translators, working in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]], were the first to attempt to describe the sounds and enunciation patterns of Chinese in a foreign language. After the 15th century, the efforts of Jesuits and Western court missionaries resulted in some rudimentary Latin transcription systems, based on the [[Nanjing Mandarin]] dialect.

===Romanization===
{{See also|Chinese language romanisation in Singapore|Romanization of Mandarin Chinese}}

[[Romanization]] is the process of transcribing a language in the [[Latin alphabet]]. There are many systems of romanization for the Chinese languages due to the lack of a native phonetic transcription until modern times. Chinese is first known to have been written in Latin characters by Western [[Christianity in China|Christian missionaries]] in the 16th century.

Today the most common romanization standard for Standard Chinese is ''[[Hanyu Pinyin]]'', often known simply as pinyin, introduced in 1956 by the [[People's Republic of China]], and later adopted by [[Singapore]] and [[Taiwan]]. Pinyin is almost universally employed now for teaching standard spoken Chinese in schools and universities across [[Americas|America]], [[Australia]] and [[Europe]]. Chinese parents also use Pinyin to teach their children the sounds and tones of new words. In school books that teach Chinese, the Pinyin romanization is often shown below a picture of the thing the word represents, with the Chinese character alongside.

The second-most common romanization system, the [[Wade-Giles]], was invented by Thomas Wade in 1859 and modified by Herbert Giles in 1892. As this system approximates the phonology of Mandarin Chinese into English consonants and vowels, i.e. it is an [[Anglicization]], it may be particularly helpful for beginner Chinese speakers of an English-speaking background. Wade-Giles was found in academic use in the [[United States]], particularly before the 1980s, and until recently{{when|date=February 2011}} was widely used in Taiwan.

When used within European texts, the [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] transcriptions in both pinyin and Wade-Giles are often left out for simplicity; Wade-Giles' extensive use of apostrophes is also usually omitted. Thus, most Western readers will be much more familiar with ''Beijing'' than they will be with ''Běijīng'' (pinyin), and with ''Taipei'' than ''T'ai²-pei³'' (Wade-Giles).

Here are a few examples of ''Hanyu Pinyin'' and Wade-Giles, for comparison:&lt;!-- Please feel free to add Yale, Postal or whatever other examples you know, but I don't know those systems. [[User:Jiawen|Jiawen]] 07:27, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC) --&gt;

Other systems of romanization for Chinese include [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]], the French [[EFEO Chinese transcription|EFEO]], the [[Yale Romanization|Yale]] (invented during WWII for U.S. troops), as well as separate systems for [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]], [[Minnan]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and other Chinese languages or dialects.

===Other phonetic transcriptions===
Chinese languages have been phonetically transcribed into many other writing systems over the centuries. The [['Phags-pa script]], for example, has been very helpful in reconstructing the pronunciations of pre-modern forms of Chinese.

[[Zhuyin]] (also called ''bopomofo''), a [[semi-syllabary]] is still widely used in Taiwan's [[elementary school]]s to aid standard pronunciation. Although bopomofo characters are reminiscent of katakana script, there is no source to substantiate the claim that Katakana was the basis for the zhuyin system. A comparison table of zhuyin to pinyin exists in the [[Bopomofo#Comparison|zhuyin article]]. Syllables based on pinyin and zhuyin can also be compared by looking at the following articles:
* [[Pinyin table]]
* [[Zhuyin table]]

There are also at least two systems of [[cyrillization]] for Chinese. The most widespread is the [[Cyrillization of Chinese from Pinyin|Palladius system]].

==Grammar and morphology==
{{Main|Chinese grammar}}
{{See also|Chinese classifiers}}
Chinese is often described as a &quot;monosyllabic&quot; language. However, this is only partially correct. It is largely accurate when describing [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Middle Chinese]]; in Classical Chinese, for example, perhaps 90% of words correspond to a single syllable and a single character. In the modern varieties, it is still usually the case that a [[morpheme]] (unit of meaning) is a single syllable; contrast English, with plenty of multi-syllable morphemes, both bound and free, such as &quot;seven&quot;, &quot;elephant&quot;, &quot;para-&quot; and &quot;-able&quot;. Some of the conservative southern varieties of modern Chinese still have largely monosyllabic words, especially among the more basic vocabulary.

In modern Mandarin, however, most [[noun]]s, [[adjective]]s and [[verb]]s are largely disyllabic. A significant cause of this is phonological attrition. [[Sound change]] over time has steadily reduced the number of possible syllables. In modern Mandarin, there are now only about 1,200 possible syllables, including tonal distinctions, compared with about 5,000 in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (still largely monosyllabic) and over 8,000 in English.&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis (1984) p.42 counts Chinese as having 1,277 tonal syllables, and about 398 to 418 if tones are disregarded; he cites [[Otto Jespersen]] (''Monosyllabism in English'', London, 1928, p.15) for a count of over 8,000 syllables for English.&lt;/ref&gt;

This phonological collapse has led to a corresponding increase in the number of [[homophone]]s. As an example, the small Langenscheidt Pocket Chinese Dictionary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Langenscheidt Pocket Chinese Dictionary |editor-first= Peter |editor-last= Terrell |publisher= Langenscheidt KG |location= Berlin and Munich |year= 2005 |isbn= 1-58573-057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists 7 words pronounced ''shī'' , 6 pronounced ''shí'', 4 pronounced ''shǐ'', and 11 pronounced ''shì'' (each word pronounced {{IPA|/ʂɨ/}}, in tones 1 through 4, respectively). Each such word has a different meaning and is written with a different character, and thus in writing, all can be used without problem. In speaking, however, tremendous ambiguity would result if all of these words could be used, and in fact, the vast majority have been replaced with some other word. As an example, consider the six tone-2 words: 十 &quot;ten&quot;; 实 &quot;real, actual&quot;; 识 &quot;know (a person), recognize&quot;; 石 &quot;stone&quot;; 时 &quot;time&quot;; 食 &quot;food&quot;. Only the first one, 十 &quot;ten&quot;, normally appears as such when spoken; the rest are normally replaced with, respectively, 实际 ''shíjì'' (lit. &quot;actual-connection&quot;); 认识 ''rènshi'' (lit. &quot;recognize-know&quot;); 石头 ''shítou'' (lit. &quot;stone-head&quot;); 时间 ''shíjiān'' (lit. &quot;time-interval&quot;); 食物 ''shíwù'' (lit. &quot;food-thing&quot;). In each case, the homophone was disambiguated by adding another word, typically either a synonym or a generic word of some sort (for example, &quot;head&quot;, &quot;thing&quot;), whose purpose is simply to indicate which of the possible meanings of the other, homophonic syllable should be selected. Note also that 十 实 识 石 时 食 were pronounced {{IPA|/dʑip/, /ʑit/, /ɕik/, /dʑjek/, /dʑī/, /ʑik/}} respectively in [[Early Middle Chinese]], according to [[William Baxter]]'s transcription &amp;mdash; each one different from all the others. Furthermore, when one of the above words forms part of a compound, the disambiguating syllable is dropped and the resulting word is still disyllabic. For example, 石 ''shí'' alone, not 石头 ''shítou'', appears in compounds meaning &quot;stone-&quot;, for example, 石膏 ''shígāo'' &quot;plaster&quot; (lit. &quot;stone cream&quot;), 石灰 ''shíhuī'' &quot;lime&quot; (lit. &quot;stone dust&quot;), 石窟 ''shíkū'' &quot;grotto&quot; (lit. &quot;stone cave&quot;), 石英 ''shíyīng'' &quot;quartz&quot; (lit. &quot;stone flower&quot;), 石油 ''shíyóu'' &quot;petroleum&quot; (lit. &quot;stone oil&quot;). 

Most modern varieties of Chinese have the tendency to form new words through disyllabic, trisyllabic and tetra-character [[compound word|compounds]]. In some cases, monosyllabic words have become disyllabic without compounding, as in 窟窿 ''kulong'' from 孔 ''kong''; this is especially common in [[Jin Chinese|Jin]].

Chinese [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] is strictly bound to a set number of [[syllable]]s with a fairly rigid construction which are the [[morpheme]]s, the smallest blocks of the language. While many of these single-syllable morphemes (字, ''zì'') can stand alone as individual [[word (linguistics)|words]], they more often than not form multi-syllabic [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]], known as ''cí'' (词／詞), which more closely resembles the traditional Western notion of a word. A Chinese ''cí'' (“word”) can consist of more than one character-morpheme, usually two, but there can be three or more.

For example:

* ''Yun'' 雲—“cloud” (traditional)
* ''Yun'' 云—“cloud” (simplified)
* ''Han-bao-bao/Hanbao'' 漢堡包／漢堡—“hamburger” (traditional)
* ''Han-bao-bao/Hanbao'' 汉堡包／汉堡—&quot;hamburger&quot; (simplified)
* ''Wo'' 我—“I, me”
* ''Ren'' 人—“people”
* ''Di-qiu'' 地球—“earth (globosity)”
* ''Shan-dian'' 閃電—“lightning” (traditional)
* ''Shan-dian'' 闪电—&quot;lightning&quot; (simplifed)
* ''Meng'' 夢—“dream” (traditional)
* ''Meng'' 梦—&quot;dream&quot; (simplified)

All varieties of modern Chinese are [[analytic language]]s, in that they depend on [[syntax]] (word order and sentence structure) rather than [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]—i.e., changes in form of a word—to indicate the word's function in a sentence. In other words, Chinese has very few [[grammatical inflection]]s—it possesses no [[Grammatical tense|tenses]], no [[grammatical voice|voices]], no [[number]]s (singular, plural; though there are plural markers, for example for personal pronouns), and only a few [[Article (grammar)|articles]] (i.e., equivalents to &quot;the, a, an&quot; in English). There is, however, a [[Grammatical gender|gender]] difference in the written language (他 as &quot;he&quot; and 她 as &quot;she&quot;), but it should be noted that this is a relatively new introduction to the Chinese language in the twentieth century, and both characters are pronounced in exactly the same way.

They make heavy use of [[grammatical particle]]s to indicate [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]]. In Mandarin Chinese, this involves the use of particles like le 了 (perfective), hai 还／還 (''still''), yijing 已经／已經 (''already''), and so on.

Chinese features [[Subject Verb Object|Subject-Verb-Object]] [[word order]], and like many other languages in [[East Asia]], makes frequent use of the [[topic-comment]] construction to form sentences. Chinese also has an extensive system of [[classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] and [[measure word]]s, another trait shared with neighbouring languages like [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]].

Other notable grammatical features common to all the spoken varieties of Chinese include the use of [[serial verb construction]], [[pro-drop language|pronoun dropping]] and the related [[null subject language|subject dropping]].

Although the grammars of the spoken varieties share many traits, they do possess differences.

===Tones and homophones===
Official modern Mandarin has only 400 spoken monosyllables but over 10,000 written characters, so there are many [[homophone]]s only distinguishable by the four tones. Even this is often not enough unless the context and exact phrase or cí is identified.

The mono-syllable ''jī'', first tone in Mandarin, corresponds to the following characters: 鸡／雞 ''chicken'', 机／機 ''machine'', 基 ''basic'', 击／擊 ''(to) hit'', 饥／饑 ''hunger'', and 积／積 ''product''. In speech, the glyphing of a monosyllable to its meaning must be determined by context or by relation to other morphemes (for example, &quot;some&quot; as in the opposite of &quot;none&quot;). Native speakers may state which words or phrases their names are found in, for convenience of writing: 名字叫嘉英，嘉陵江的嘉，英國的英 Míngzi jiào Jiāyīng, Jiālíng Jiāng de jiā, Yīngguó de yīng &quot;My name is Jiāyīng, the ''Jia'' for ''[[Jialing River]]'' and the ''ying'' for ''the short form in Chinese of [[United Kingdom|UK]]''.&quot;

Southern Chinese varieties like Cantonese and Hakka preserved more of the [[syllable rime|rimes]] of Middle Chinese and have more tones. The previous examples of ''jī'', have more distinct pronunciations in Cantonese (romanized using [[jyutping]]): ''gai1'', ''gei1'', ''gei1'', ''gik1'', ''gei1'', and ''zik1'' respectively. For this reason, southern varieties tend to need to employ fewer multi-syllabic words.

==Vocabulary==
The entire Chinese character corpus since antiquity comprises well over 20,000 characters, of which only roughly 10,000 are now commonly in use. However Chinese characters should not be confused with Chinese words; since most Chinese words are made up of two or more different characters, there are many times more Chinese words than there are characters.

Estimates of the total number of Chinese words and phrases vary greatly. The ''[[Hanyu Da Zidian]]'', a compendium of Chinese characters, includes 54,678 head entries for characters, including [[bone oracle]] versions. The ''[[Zhonghua Zihai]]'' (1994) contains 85,568 head entries for character definitions, and is the largest reference work based purely on character and its literary variants. The [[CC-CEDICT]] project (2010) contains 97,404 contemporary entries including idioms, technology terms and names of political figures, businesses and products. The 2009 version of the Webster's Digital Chinese Dictionary (WDCD),&lt;ref&gt;*Dr. Timothy Uy and Jim Hsia, Editors, ''Webster's Digital Chinese Dictionary - Advanced Reference Edition, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[CC-CEDICT]], contains over 84,000 entries.

The most comprehensive pure linguistic Chinese-language dictionary, the 12-volumed ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'', records more than 23,000 head Chinese characters and gives over 370,000 definitions. The 1999 revised ''[[Cihai]]'', a multi-volume encyclopedic dictionary reference work, gives 122,836 vocabulary entry definitions under 19,485 Chinese characters, including proper names, phrases and common zoological, geographical, sociological, scientific and technical terms.

The latest 2007 5th edition of ''[[Xiandai Hanyu Cidian]]'' 现代汉语词典／現代漢語詞典, an authoritative one-volume dictionary on modern standard Chinese language as used in [[mainland China]], has 65,000 entries and defines 11,000 head characters.

==Loanwords==
{{See also|Translation of neologisms into Chinese|Transcription into Chinese characters}}
Like any other language, Chinese has absorbed a sizable number of loanwords from other cultures. Most Chinese words are formed out of native Chinese morphemes, including words describing imported objects and ideas. However, direct phonetic borrowing of foreign words has gone on since ancient times.

Words borrowed from along the [[Silk Road]] since [[Old Chinese]] include 葡萄 &quot;[[grape]]&quot;, 石榴 &quot;[[pomegranate]]&quot; and 狮子／獅子 &quot;[[lion]]&quot;. Some words were borrowed from Buddhist scriptures, including 佛 &quot;Buddha&quot; and 菩萨／菩薩 &quot;bodhisattva.&quot; Other words came from nomadic peoples to the north, such as 胡同 &quot;[[hutong]]&quot;. Words borrowed from the peoples along the Silk Road, such as 葡萄 &quot;grape&quot; (pútáo in Mandarin) generally have [[Persia]]n etymologies. Buddhist terminology is generally derived from [[Sanskrit]] or [[Pāli]], the [[liturgical language]]s of [[North India]]. Words borrowed from the nomadic tribes of the [[Gobi]], Mongolian or northeast regions generally have [[Altaic]] etymologies, such as 琵琶 &quot;pípa&quot;, the Chinese lute, or 酪 &quot;cheese&quot; or &quot;yoghurt&quot;, but from exactly which Altaic source is not always entirely clear.

===Modern borrowings and loanwords===
Modern neologisms are translated into Chinese primarily in three ways: free translation ([[calque]], by meaning), phonetic translation (by sound) and [[phono-semantic matching|a combination of the above two]] (partially transcriptive with a careful selection of meaning-encoding characters). Today, it is much more common to use existing Chinese morphemes to coin new words in order to represent imported concepts, such as technical expressions and [[international scientific vocabulary]], owing to the structural differences from Western languages. Any [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]] etymologies are dropped and converted into the corresponding meaning-carrying Chinese characters (for example, ''anti-'' typically becomes &quot;反&quot;, literally ''opposite''), making them more comprehensible for Chinese but introducing more difficulties in understanding foreign texts. For example, the word ''telephone'' was loaned phonetically as 德律风／德律風 ([[Shanghainese dialect|Shanghainese]]: ''télífon'' {{IPA|[təlɪfoŋ]}}, Mandarin: ''délǜfēng'') during the 1920s and widely used in Shanghai, but later 电话／電話 (''diànhuà'' &quot;electric speech&quot;), built out of native Chinese morphemes, became prevalent. Other examples include 电视／電視 (''diànshì'' &quot;electric vision&quot;) for television, 电脑／電腦 (''diànnǎo'' &quot;electric brain&quot;) for computer; 手机／手機 (''shǒujī'' &quot;hand machine&quot;) for cellphone, and 蓝牙／藍牙 (''lányá'' &quot;blue tooth&quot;) for [[Bluetooth]]. 網誌 (''wǎng zhì'' &quot;internet logbook&quot;) for blog in Cantonese or people in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. Occasionally half-transliteration, half-translation compromises are accepted, such as 汉堡包／漢堡包 (''hànbǎo bāo'', &quot;''Hamburg'' bun&quot;) for &quot;hamburger&quot;. Sometimes translations are designed so that they sound like the original while incorporating Chinese morphemes, such as 拖拉机／拖拉機 (''tuōlājī'', &quot;tractor,&quot; literally &quot;dragging-pulling machine&quot;), or 马利奥／馬利奧 for the video game character ''[[Mario]]''. This is often done for commercial purposes, for example 奔腾／奔騰 (''bēnténg'' &quot;running leaping&quot;) for [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] and 赛百味／賽百味 (''Sàibǎiwèi'' &quot;better-than hundred tastes&quot;) for [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway restaurants]].

Foreign words, mainly [[proper nouns]] (names of people, places), continue to enter the Chinese language by transcription according to their pronunciations. This is done by employing Chinese characters with similar pronunciations. For example, &quot;Israel&quot; becomes 以色列 (pinyin: ''yǐsèliè''), &quot;Paris&quot; becomes 巴黎 (pinyin: ''bālí''). A rather small number of direct transliterations have survived as common words, including 沙发／沙發 ''shāfā'' &quot;sofa&quot;, 马达／馬達 ''mǎdá'' &quot;motor&quot;, 幽默 ''yōumò'' &quot;humor&quot;, 逻辑／邏輯 ''luójí'' &quot;logic&quot;, 时髦／時髦 ''shímáo'' &quot;smart, fashionable&quot; and 歇斯底里 ''xiēsīdǐlǐ'' &quot;hysterics&quot;. The bulk of these words were originally coined in the [[Shanghainese dialect]] during the early 20th century and were later loaned into Mandarin, hence their pronunciations in Mandarin may be quite off from the English. For example, 沙发／沙發 and 马达／馬達 in Shanghainese actually sound more like the English &quot;sofa&quot; and &quot;motor&quot;.

Western foreign words have had great influence on Chinese language since the 20th century, through transcription. From [[French language|French]] came 芭蕾 (''bāléi'' &quot;ballet&quot;), 香槟 (''xiāngbīn'', &quot;champagne&quot;), via [[Italian language|Italian]] 咖啡 (''kāfēi'' &quot;caffè&quot;). The English influence is particularly pronounced. From early 20th century [[Shanghainese dialect|Shanghainese]], many English words are borrowed, such as the above-mentioned 沙发／沙發 (''shāfā'' &quot;sofa&quot;), 幽默 (''yōumò'' &quot;humour&quot;), and 高尔夫／高爾夫 (''gāoěrfū'' &quot;golf&quot;). Later [[United States]] [[soft influence]]s gave rise to 迪斯科 (''dísīkè'' &quot;disco&quot;), 可乐／可樂 (''kělè'' &quot;cola&quot;) and 迷你 (''mínǐ'' &quot;mini(skirt)&quot;). Contemporary colloquial [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] has distinct loanwords from English like cartoon 卡通 (cartoon), 基佬 (gay people), 的士 (taxi), 巴士 (bus). With the rising popularity of the Internet, there is a current vogue in China for coining English transliterations, for example, 粉丝／粉絲 (''fěnsī'' &quot;fans&quot;), 黑客 (''hēikè'' &quot;[[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]]&quot;, literally &quot;black guest&quot;), 部落格 (''bùluōgé'' &quot;blog&quot;, literally &quot;interconnected tribes&quot;) in [[Taiwanese Mandarin]].

Another result of the English influence on Chinese is the appearance in Modern Chinese texts of so-called 字母词 ''zìmǔcí'' (&quot;lettered words&quot;) spelled with letters from foreign alphabets. This has appeared in magazines, newspapers, on web sites and on TV: 三G手机 &quot;3rd generation cell phones&quot; (三 ''sān'' &quot;three&quot; + G &quot;generation&quot; + 手机 ''shǒujī'' &quot;mobile phones&quot;), IT界 &quot;IT industry&quot;, HSK (''hànyǔ shuǐpíng kǎoshì'', 汉语水平考试), GB (''guóbiāo'', 国标), CIF价 (Cost, Insurance, Freight + 价 ''jià'' &quot;price&quot;); e家庭 &quot;electronic home&quot; (家庭 ''jiātīng'' &quot;home&quot;); W时代 &quot;wireless generation&quot; (时代 ''shídài'' &quot;generation&quot;); 的士call, TV族, 后РС时代 &quot;post-PC era&quot; (后 ''hòu'' &quot;after/post&quot; + PC &quot;personal computer&quot; + 时代 ''shídài'' &quot;epoch&quot;), and so on.

Since the 20th century, another source has been [[Japan]]. Using existing [[kanji]], which are Chinese characters used in the [[Japanese language]], the Japanese re-moulded European concepts and inventions into ''[[wasei-kango]]'' (和製漢語, literally ''Japanese-made Chinese''), and re-loaned many of these into modern Chinese. Other terms were coined by the Japanese by giving new senses to existing Chinese terms or by referring to expressions used in classical Chinese literature. For example, ''jīngjì'' (经济／經濟, keizai), which in the original Chinese meant &quot;the workings of the state&quot;, was narrowed to &quot;economy&quot; in Japanese; this narrowed definition was then reimported into Chinese. As a result, these terms are virtually indistinguishable from native Chinese words: indeed, there is some dispute over some of these terms as to whether the Japanese or Chinese coined them first. As a result of this toing-and-froing process, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese share a corpus linguistic of terms describing modern terminology, in parallel to a similar corpus of terms built from Greco-Latin terms shared among European languages.

In 1991 there were 2,000 foreign learners taking China's official [[Chinese Proficiency Test]] (comparable to the English [[University of Cambridge ESOL examination|Cambridge Certificate]]), while in 2005, the number of candidates had risen sharply to 117,660.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} &quot;汉语水平考试中心：2005年外国考生总人数近12万&quot;,&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.gov.cn/jrzg/2006-01/16/content_160707.htm Gov.cn]&lt;/sup&gt; [[Xinhua News Agency]], January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Complex analysis''', traditionally known as the '''theory of functions of a complex variable''', is the branch of [[mathematics]] investigating [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] of [[complex numbers]]. It is useful in many branches of mathematics, including [[number theory]] and [[applied mathematics]]; as well as in [[physics]], including [[hydrodynamics]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[electrical engineering]].

Murray Spiegel described complex analysis as &quot;one of the most beautiful as well as useful branches of mathematics&quot;.

Complex analysis is particularly concerned with the [[analytic function]]s of complex variables (or, more generally, [[meromorphic function]]s). Because the separable [[real number|real]] and [[imaginary number|imaginary]] parts of any analytic function must satisfy [[Laplace's equation]], complex analysis is widely applicable to two-dimensional problems in [[physics]].

== History ==
[[Image:Mandel zoom 00 mandelbrot set.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The [[Mandelbrot set]], a '''[[fractal]]'''.]]
Complex analysis is one of the classical branches in mathematics with its roots in the 19th century and just prior. Important names are [[Euler]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], [[Riemann]], [[Cauchy]], [[Weierstrass]], and many more in the 20th century. Traditionally, complex analysis, in particular the theory of [[conformal mapping]]s, has many physical applications and is also used throughout [[analytic number theory]]. In modern times, it became very popular through a new boost of [[complex dynamics]] and the pictures of [[fractal]]s produced by iterating [[holomorphic functions]].  Another important application of complex analysis today is in [[string theory]] which is a conformally invariant [[quantum field theory]].

== Complex functions ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Complex plane]] --&gt;
A complex function is a function in which the [[independent variable]] and the [[dependent variable]] are both complex numbers. More precisely, a complex function is a function whose [[domain (mathematics)#Domain of a function|domain]] and [[range (mathematics)|range]] are [[subset]]s of the [[complex plane]].

For any complex function, both the independent variable and the dependent variable may be separated into [[Real number|real]] and [[Imaginary number|imaginary]] parts:

: &lt;math&gt;z = x + iy\,&lt;/math&gt; and
: &lt;math&gt;w = f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)\,&lt;/math&gt;
: where &lt;math&gt;x,y \in \mathbb{R}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u(x,y), v(x,y)\,&lt;/math&gt; are real-valued functions.

In other words, the components of the function ''f''(''z''),

: &lt;math&gt;u = u(x,y)\,&lt;/math&gt; and
: &lt;math&gt;v = v(x,y),\,&lt;/math&gt;

can be interpreted as real-valued functions of the two real variables, ''x'' and ''y''.

The basic concepts of complex analysis are often introduced by extending the elementary real functions (e.g., exponentials, logarithms, and trigonometric functions) into the complex domain.

== Holomorphic functions ==
{{main|Holomorphic function}}
Holomorphic functions are complex functions defined on an [[open set|open subset]] of the complex plane which are [[differentiable function|differentiable]]. Complex differentiability has much stronger consequences than usual (real) differentiability. For instance, holomorphic functions are infinitely differentiable, whereas some real differentiable functions are not. Most elementary functions, including the [[exponential function]], the [[trigonometric function]]s, and all [[polynomial|polynomial functions]], are holomorphic.

''See also'': [[analytic function]], [[holomorphic sheaf]] and [[vector bundle]]s.

== Major results ==
One central tool in complex analysis is the [[line integral]]. The integral around a closed path of a function which is holomorphic everywhere inside the area bounded by the closed path is always zero; this is the [[Cauchy integral theorem]]. The values of a holomorphic function inside a disk can be computed by a certain path integral on the disk's boundary ([[Cauchy's integral formula]]). Path integrals in the complex plane are often used to determine complicated real integrals, and here the theory of [[residue (complex analysis)|residue]]s among others is useful (see [[methods of contour integration]]). If a function has a ''pole'' or ''singularity'' at some point, that is, at that point its values &quot;blow up&quot; and have no finite boundary, then one can compute the function's residue at that pole, and these residues can be used to compute path integrals involving the function; this is the content of the powerful [[residue theorem]]. The remarkable behavior of holomorphic functions near essential singularities is described by [[Picard theorem#Big Picard|Picard's Theorem]]. Functions which have only poles but no essential singularities are called [[meromorphic]].
[[Laurent series]] are similar to [[Taylor series]] but can be used to study the behavior of functions near singularities.

A bounded function which is holomorphic in the entire complex plane must be constant; this is [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville's theorem]]. It can be used to provide a natural and short proof for the [[Fundamental Theorem of Algebra|fundamental theorem of algebra]] which states that the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of complex numbers is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]].

An important property of holomorphic functions is that if a function is holomorphic throughout a [[simply connected]] domain then its values are fully determined by its values on any smaller subdomain.  The function on the larger domain is said to be [[analytic continuation|analytically continued]] from its values on the smaller domain.  This allows the extension of the definition of functions such as the [[Riemann zeta function]] which are initially defined in terms of infinite sums that converge only on limited domains to almost the entire complex plane.  Sometimes, as in the case of the [[natural logarithm]], it is impossible to analytically continue a holomorphic function to a non-simply connected domain in the complex plane but it is possible to extend it to a holomorphic function on a closely related surface known as a [[Riemann surface]].

All this refers to complex analysis in one variable. There is also a very rich theory of [[several complex variables|complex analysis in more than one complex dimension]] where the analytic properties such as power series expansion still remain true whereas most of the geometric properties of holomorphic functions in one complex dimension (such as [[conformality]]) are no longer true. The [[Riemann mapping theorem]] about the conformal relationship of certain domains in the complex plane, which may be the most important result in the one-dimensional theory, fails dramatically in higher dimensions.

It is also applied in many subjects throughout engineering, particularly in [[power engineering]].

{{History of China|BC=1}}
[[China|Chinese]] civilization originated in various regional centers along both the [[Yellow River]] and the [[Yangtze River]] valleys in the [[Neolithic]] era, but the Yellow River is said to be the Cradle of Chinese Civilization. The written '''history of China''' can be found as early as the [[Shang Dynasty]] (c. 1700 – c. 1046 BC).,&lt;ref name=&quot;state1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exchanges.state.gov/culprop/cn04sum.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071215094418/http://exchanges.state.gov/culprop/cn04sum.html|archivedate=2007-12-15|title=Cultural History and Archaeology of China|publisher=Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, U.S. State Department|accessdate=2008-01-12}}{{Dead link|url=http://exchanges.state.gov/culprop/cn04sum.html|date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although ancient historical texts such as the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (ca. 100 BC) and ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'' assert the existence of an [[Xia Dynasty]] before the Shang.&lt;ref name=&quot;state1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Ancient Dynasties&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-chaos.umd.edu/history/ancient1.html|title=The Ancient Dynasties|publisher=University of Maryland|accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oracle bone]]s with ancient [[Chinese writing]] from the Shang Dynasty have been [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to as early as 1500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cleere. Archaeological Heritage Management in the Modern World. 2005. Routledge. p. 318. ISBN 0415214483.&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of present-day Chinese [[Culture of China|culture]], [[Chinese literature|literature]] and [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]] developed during the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1045-256 BC).

The Zhou Dynasty began to bow to external and internal pressures in the 8th century BC, and the kingdom eventually broke apart into smaller states, beginning in the [[Spring and Autumn Period]] and reaching full expression in the [[Warring States period]]. This is one of multiple periods of [[failed state]]hood in Chinese history (the most recent of which was the [[Chinese Civil War]]).

In between eras of multiple kingdoms and warlordism, Chinese dynasties (or, more recently, republics) have ruled all of China (minus [[Xinjiang]] and [[Tibet]]) (and, in some eras, including the present, they have controlled Xinjiang and/or Tibet as well). This practice began with the [[Qin Dynasty]]: in 221 BC, [[Qin Shi Huang]] united the various warring kingdoms and created the first Chinese empire. Successive [[dynasties in Chinese history]] developed [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] systems that enabled the [[Emperor of China]] to directly control vast territories.

The conventional view of Chinese history is that of alternating periods of political unity and disunity, with China occasionally being dominated by [[Inner Asia]]n peoples, most of whom were in turn assimilated into the [[Han Chinese]] population. Cultural and political influences from many parts of [[Asia]], carried by successive waves of [[immigration]], expansion, and [[cultural assimilation]], are part of the modern culture of China.

==Prehistory==

The excavations at [[Yuanmou Man|Yuanmou]] and later [[Lantian Man|Lantian]] show early habitation. Perhaps the most famous specimen of ''Homo erectus'' found in China is the so-called [[Peking Man]] discovered in 1923-27.

Three pottery pieces were unearthed at Liyuzui Cave in [[Liuzhou]], [[Guangxi]] Province dated 16,500 and 19,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arheologija.ff.uni-lj.si/documenta/pdf29/29chi.pdf &quot;The discovery of early pottery in China&quot;] by Zhang Chi, Department of Archaeology, Peking University, China&lt;/ref&gt;

The early history of China is made obscure by the lack of written documents from this period, coupled with the existence of accounts written during later time periods that attempted to describe events that had occurred several centuries previously. In a sense, the problem stems from centuries of introspection on the part of the Chinese people, which has blurred the distinction between fact and fiction in regards to this early history.

By 7000 BC, the Chinese were farming [[millet]], giving rise to the [[Jiahu]] culture. At [[Damaidi]] in [[Ningxia]], 3,172 [[Neolithic signs in China|cliff carvings]] dating to 6000-5000 BC have been discovered &quot;featuring 8,453 individual characters such as the sun, moon, stars, gods and scenes of hunting or grazing.&quot; These pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6669569.stm | work=BBC News | title=Chinese writing '8,000 years old' | date=2007-05-18 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-05/18/content_6121225.htm|title=Carvings may rewrite history of Chinese characters|publisher=[[Xinhua]] online|date=2007-05-18|accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Yangshao culture]] was superseded by the [[Longshan culture]] around 2500 BC.

===Xia Dynasty (c. 2100 - c. 1600 BC)===
{{Main|Xia Dynasty}}
''Major site(s): possibly [[Erlitou]]''

The Xia Dynasty of China (from c. 2100 to c. 1600 BC) is the first dynasty to be described in ancient historical records such as ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' and ''[[Bamboo Annals]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;state1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Ancient Dynasties&quot;/&gt;

Although there is disagreement as to whether the dynasty actually existed, there is some archaeological evidence pointing to its possible existence. The historian [[Sima Qian]] (145-90 BC), who wrote the ''Shiji'' or ''Records of the Grand Historian'', and the so-called ''Bamboo Annals'' date the founding of the [[Xia Dynasty]] to 4,200 years ago, but this date has not been corroborated. Most archaeologists now connect the Xia to excavations at [[Erlitou culture|Erlitou]] in central [[Henan]] province,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/chbro_bron.shtm Bronze Age China] at [http://www.nga.gov/ National Gallery of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; where a bronze smelter from around 2000 BC was unearthed. Early markings from this period found on pottery and shells are thought to be ancestral to modern Chinese characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20050213035644/http://www.gog.com.cn/gz/art0402/ca615230.htm Scripts found on Erlitou pottery] (written in [[Simplified Chinese]])&lt;/ref&gt; With few clear records matching the Shang [[oracle bones]] or the [[Zhou Dynasty (1122 BC - 256 BC)|Zhou]] bronze vessel writings, the Xia era remains poorly understood.

According to mythology, the dynasty ended around 1600 BC as a consequence of the [[Battle of Mingtiao]].

===Shang Dynasty (c. 1700-1046 BC)===
{{Main|Shang Dynasty}}
''Capital: [[Yinxu]], near [[Anyang]] ([[Yin Dynasty]] period)''

[[Image:China 1.jpg|left|thumb|Remnants of advanced, stratified societies dating back to the Shang found primarily in the Yellow River Valley]]
The earliest written record of Chinese past so far discovered dates from the Shang Dynasty in perhaps the 13th century BC and takes the form of inscriptions of divination records on the bones or shells of animals—the so-called ''[[oracle bones]]''. Archaeological findings providing evidence for the existence of the Shang Dynasty, c. 1600-1046 BC, are divided into two sets. The first set, from the earlier Shang period comes from sources at [[Erligang culture|Erligang]], [[Zhengzhou]] and Shangcheng. The second set, from the later Shang or Yin (殷) period, consists of a large body of oracle bone writings. [[Anyang]], in modern-day [[Henan]], has been confirmed as the last of the Shang's nine capitals (c. 1300-1046 BC). The Shang Dynasty featured 31 kings, from [[Tang of Shang]] to [[King Zhou of Shang]]. In this period, the Chinese worshipped many different gods - weather gods and sky gods - and also a supreme god, named [[Shangdi]], who ruled over the other gods. Those who lived during the Shang Dynasty also believed that their ancestors - their parents and grandparents - became like gods when they died, and that their ancestors wanted to be worshipped too, like gods. Each family worshipped its own ancestors.

Around 1500 BC, the Chinese began to use written oracle bones to predict the future. By the time of the Zhou Dynasty (about 1100 BC), the Chinese were also worshipping a natural force called ''tian'', which is usually translated as Heaven. Like Shangdi, Heaven ruled over all the other gods, and it decided who would rule China, under the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. The ruler could rule as long as he or she had the Mandate of Heaven. It was believed that the emperor or empress had lost the Mandate of Heaven when natural disasters occurred in great number, and when, more realistically, the sovereign had apparently lost his concern for the people. In response, the royal house would be overthrown, and a new house would rule, having been granted the Mandate of Heaven.

The ''Records of the Grand Historian'' states that the Shang Dynasty moved its capital six times. The final (and most important) move to [[Yinxu|Yin]] in 1350 BC led to the dynasty's golden age. The term Yin Dynasty has been synonymous with the Shang dynasty in history, although it has lately been used to specifically refer to the latter half of the Shang Dynasty.

Chinese historians living in later periods were accustomed to the notion of one dynasty succeeding another, but the actual political situation in early China is known to have been much more complicated. Hence, as some scholars of China suggest, the Xia and the Shang can possibly refer to political entities that existed concurrently, just as the early Zhou is known to have existed at the same time as the Shang.

Written records found at Anyang confirm the existence of the Shang dynasty. However, Western scholars are often hesitant to associate settlements that are contemporaneous with the Anyang settlement with the Shang dynasty. For example, archaeological findings at [[Sanxingdui]] suggest a technologically advanced civilization culturally unlike Anyang. The evidence is inconclusive in proving how far the Shang realm extended from Anyang. The leading hypothesis is that Anyang, ruled by the same Shang in the official history, coexisted and traded with numerous other culturally diverse settlements in the area that is now referred to as China proper.

===Zhou Dynasty (1046-256 BC)===
[[Image:You with zigzag thunder pattern.jpg|thumb|[[Chinese bronzes|Bronze]] ritual vessel ([[You (vessel)|You]]), Western Zhou Dynasty]]
{{Main|Zhou Dynasty}}
''Capitals: [[Xi'an]] and [[Luoyang]]''

The Zhou Dynasty was the longest-lasting dynasty in Chinese history, from 1066 BC to approximately 256 BC. By the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the [[Zhou Dynasty]] began to emerge in the [[Yellow River]] valley, overrunning the territory of the Shang. The Zhou appeared to have begun their rule under a [[Feudalism|semi-feudal]] system. The Zhou were a people who lived west of the [[Shang]], and the Zhou leader had been appointed &quot;Western Protector&quot; by the Shang. The ruler of the Zhou, [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]], with the assistance of his brother, the [[Duke of Zhou]], as regent, managed to defeat the Shang at the [[Battle of Muye]]. The king of Zhou at this time invoked the concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] to legitimize his rule, a concept that would be influential for almost every succeeding dynasty. The Zhou initially moved their capital west to an area near modern [[Xi'an]], on the [[Wei River]], a tributary of the Yellow River, but they would preside over a series of expansions into the [[Yangtze River]] valley. This would be the first of many population migrations from north to south in Chinese history.

===Spring and Autumn Period (722-476 BC)===
{{Main|Spring and Autumn Period}}

''Capitals: of the [[State of Yan]], [[Beijing]]; of the [[State of Qin]], [[Xi'an]]''

[[Image:Pu with openwork interlaced dragons design.jpg|thumb|Chinese pu vessel with interlaced [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] design, [[Spring and Autumn Period]]]]
In the 8th century BC, power became decentralized during the [[Spring and Autumn Period]], named after the influential [[Spring and Autumn Annals]]. In this period, local military leaders used by the Zhou began to assert their power and vie for [[hegemony]]. The situation was aggravated by the invasion of other peoples from the northwest, such as the [[Qin (state)|Qin]], forcing the Zhou to move their capital east to [[Luoyang]]. This marks the second major phase of the Zhou dynasty: the Eastern Zhou. In each of the hundreds of states that eventually arose, local strongmen held most of the political power and continued their subservience to the Zhou kings in name only. For instance, local leaders started using royal titles for themselves. The [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] of Chinese philosophy blossomed during this period, and such influential intellectual movements as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] and [[Mohism]] were founded, partly in response to the changing political world.
The Spring and Autumn Period is marked by a falling apart of the central Zhou power. China now consists of hundreds of states, some of them only as large as a village with a fort.

===Warring States Period (476-221 BC)===
{{Main|Warring States Period}}

''[[Historical capitals of China|Several capitals]], due to there being multiple states''

After further political consolidation, seven prominent states remained by the end of 5th century BC, and the years in which these few states battled each other are known as the [[Warring States Period]]. Though there remained a nominal [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] king until 256 BC, he was largely a figurehead and held little real power.
As neighboring territories of these warring states, including areas of modern [[Sichuan]] and [[Liaoning]], were annexed, they were governed under the new local administrative system of [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] and [[prefecture]] (郡縣/郡县). This system had been in use since the Spring and Autumn Period, and parts can still be seen in the modern system of [[Political divisions of China|Sheng &amp; Xian]] (province and county, 省縣/省县). The final expansion in this period began during the reign of [[Ying Zheng]], the king of Qin. His unification of the other six powers, and further annexations in the modern regions of [[Zhejiang]], [[Fujian]], [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] in 214 BC, enabled him to proclaim himself the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]] (Qin Shi Huang).

==Imperial era==
===Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC)===
[[File:QinshihuangBW.jpg|thumb|[[Qin Shi Huang]]]]
{{Main|Qin Dynasty}}
''Capital: [[Xianyang]]''

Historians often refer to the period from Qin Dynasty to the end of [[Qing Dynasty]] as Imperial China. Though the unified reign of the [[Qin Shi Huang Di|Qin]] Emperor lasted only 12 years, he managed to subdue great parts of what constitutes the core of the [[Han Chinese]] homeland and to unite them under a tightly centralized [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]] government seated at [[Xianyang]] (close to modern [[Xi'an]]). The doctrine of Legalism that guided the Qin emphasized strict adherence to a legal code and the absolute power of the emperor. This philosophy, while effective for expanding the empire in a military fashion, proved unworkable for governing it in peacetime. The Qin Emperor presided over the brutal silencing of political opposition, including the event known as the [[burning of books and burying of scholars]]. This would be the impetus behind the later Han synthesis incorporating the more moderate schools of political governance.

[[Image:Terracotta Army-China2.jpg|thumb|The [[Terracotta Army]] of [[Qin Shi Huang]].]]
The Qin Dynasty is well known for beginning the [[Great Wall of China]], which was later augmented and enhanced during the [[Ming Dynasty]]. The other major contributions of the Qin include the concept of a centralized government, the unification of the legal code, development of the written language, measurement, and currency of China after the tribulations of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States Periods. Even something as basic as the length of axles for carts
had to be made uniform to ensure a viable trading system throughout the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uobuy.com/upload/2005/9/19/200591911278032621125.jpg|title=Book &quot;QINSHIHUANG&quot;|accessdate=2007-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ChangXingongdeng.jpg|thumb|A [[Han Dynasty]] [[oil lamp]] with a sliding shutter, in the shape of a kneeling female servant, 2nd century BC]]
The [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – AD 220) emerged in 206 BC, with its founder [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]] proclaimed emperor in 202 BC. It was the first dynasty to embrace the philosophy of [[Confucianism]], which became the ideological underpinning of all regimes until the end of imperial China. Under the Han Dynasty, China made great advances in many areas of the arts and sciences. [[Emperor Wu of Han China|Emperor Wu]] consolidated and extended the Chinese empire by pushing back the [[Xiongnu]] (identified with the [[Huns]]) into the steppes of modern [[Inner Mongolia]], wresting from them the modern areas of [[Gansu]], [[Ningxia]] and [[Qinghai]]. This enabled the first opening of trading connections between China and the West, along the [[Silk Road]]. Han Dynasty general [[Ban Chao]] expanded his conquests across the [[Pamirs]] to the shores of the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/440601/Ban-Chao Ban Chao], Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; The first of several [[Romano-Chinese relations|Roman embassies to China]] is recorded in Chinese sources, coming from the sea route in AD 166, and a second one in AD 284.

Nevertheless, land acquisitions by elite families gradually drained the tax base. In AD 9, the usurper [[Wang Mang]] founded the short-lived [[Xin Dynasty|Xin (&quot;New&quot;) Dynasty]] and started an extensive program of land and other economic reforms. These programs, however, were never supported by the landholding families, because they favored the peasants. The instability brought about chaos and uprisings.

[[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Emperor Guangwu]] reinstated the Han Dynasty with the support of landholding and merchant families at [[Luoyang]], east of [[Xi'an]]. This new era would be termed the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]]. Han power declined again amidst land acquisitions, invasions, and feuding between [[consort clan]]s and [[Eunuch (court official)#China|eunuch]]s. The [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out in AD 184, ushering in an era of [[warlord]]s. In the ensuing turmoil, three states tried to gain predominance in the period of the [[Three Kingdoms]]. This time period has been greatly romanticized in works such as ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]''.

===Wei and Jin Period (AD 265–420)===
{{Main|Cao Wei|Jin Dynasty (265-420)}}
''Capitals: of [[Cao Wei]] and Western Jin, [[Luoyang]]; of [[Shu Han]], [[Chengdu]]; of [[Eastern Wu]] and Eastern Jin, [[Jiankang]]; of Western Jin, [[Chang'an]]''

After [[Cao Cao]] reunified the north in 208, his son proclaimed the [[Cao Wei|Wei]] dynasty in 220. Soon, Wei's rivals [[Shu Han|Shu]] and [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] proclaimed their independence, leading China into the [[Three Kingdoms]] Period. This period was characterized by a gradual decentralization of the state that had existed during the Qin and Han dynasties, and an increase in the power of great families. Although the Three Kingdoms were reunified by the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] in 280, this structure was essentially the same until the Wu Hu uprising.

===Wu Hu Period (AD 304–439)===
{{Main|Sixteen Kingdoms|Wu Hu uprising}}
''Several capitals, due to there being several states and warring''

Taking advantage of civil war in the Jin Dynasty, the contemporary non-Han Chinese ([[Wu Hu]]) ethnic groups controlled much of the country in the early 4th century and provoked large-scale Han Chinese migrations to south of the [[Yangtze River]]. In 303 the [[Di (ethnic group)|Di]] people rebelled and later captured [[Chengdu]], establishing the state of [[Cheng Han]]. Under [[Liu Yuan (Han Zhao)|Liu Yuan]], the [[Xiongnu]] rebelled near today's [[Linfen County]] and established the state of [[Han Zhao]]. Liu Yuan's successor [[Liu Cong (Han Zhao)|Liu Cong]] captured and executed the last two Western Jin emperors. [[Sixteen Kingdoms|Sixteen kingdoms]] were a plethora of short-lived non-Chinese dynasties that came to rule the whole or parts of northern China in the 4th and 5th centuries. Many ethnic groups were involved, including ancestors of the [[Turkic people|Turks]], [[Mongols]], and [[Tibetans]]. Most of these [[nomadic]] peoples had, to some extent, been &quot;[[Sinicization|sinicized]]&quot; long before their ascent to power. In fact, some of them, notably the [[Qiang people|Qiang]] and the Xiongnu, had already been allowed to live in the frontier regions within the Great Wall since late Han times.

{{Main|Southern and Northern Dynasties}}
''Capitals: of the [[Northern Dynasties]]: [[Ye, China|Ye]], [[Chang'an]], of the [[Southern Dynasties]]: [[Jiankang]]''

Signaled by the collapse of [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|East Jin Dynasty]] in 420, China entered the era of the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]]. The Han people managed to survive the military attacks from the nomadic tribes of the north, such as the [[Xianbei]], and their civilization continued to thrive.

In southern China, fierce debates about whether [[Buddhism]] should be allowed to exist were held frequently by the royal court and nobles. Finally, near the end of the Southern and Northern Dynasties era, both Buddhist and [[Taoist]] followers compromised and became more tolerant of each other.

In 589, [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] annexed the last Southern Dynasty, [[Chen Dynasty|Chen]], through military force, and put an end to the era of Southern and Northern Dynasties.

===Sui Dynasty (AD 589–618)===
{{Main|Sui Dynasty}}
''Main capital: [[Luoyang|Dongdu]]; secondary capital: [[Chang'an|Daxing]]''

The [[Sui Dynasty]], which managed to reunite the country in 589 after nearly four centuries of political fragmentation, played a role more important than its length of existence would suggest. The Sui brought China together again and set up many institutions that were to be adopted by their successors, the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]]. Like the Qin, however, the Sui overused their resources and collapsed. Also similar to the Qin, traditional history has judged the Sui somewhat unfairly, as it has stressed the harshness of the Sui regime and the arrogance of its second emperor, giving little credit for the Dynasty's many positive achievements.

===Tang Dynasty (AD 618–907)===
[[Image:Tang horse.jpg|thumb|A Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] tricolored [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] porcelain horse (ca. AD 700)]]
{{Main|Tang Dynasty}}
''Capitals: [[Chang'an]] and [[Luoyang]]''

On June 18, 618, [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang China|Gaozu]] took the throne, and the [[Tang Dynasty]] was established, opening a new age of prosperity and innovations in arts and technology. [[Buddhism]], which had gradually been established in China from the 1st century AD, became the predominant religion and was adopted by the imperial family and many of the common people.

[[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]), the national capital, is thought to have been the world's largest city at the time. The Tang and the Han dynasties are often referred to as the most prosperous periods of Chinese history.

The Tang, like the Han, kept the trade routes open to the west and south. There was extensive trade with distant foreign countries, and many foreign merchants settled in China.

The Tang introduced a new system into the Chinese government, called the &quot;[[equal-field system]]&quot;. This system gave families land grants from the emperor based on their needs, not their wealth.

From about 860, the Tang Dynasty began to decline due to a series of rebellions within China itself and in the previously subject [[Kingdom of Nanzhao]] to the south. One of the warlords, [[Huang Chao]], captured [[Guangzhou]] in 879, killing most of the 200,000 inhabitants, including most of the large colony of foreign merchant families there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/judaism/kaifung.html Kaifung Jews]. University of Cumbria.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 880, Luoyang surrendered to him, and on 5 January 881 he conquered [[Chang'an]]. The emperor [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Xizong]] fled to [[Chengdu]], and Huang established a new temporary regime, which was eventually destroyed by Tang forces, but another time of political chaos followed.

===Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (AD 907–960)===
{{Main|Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period}}
''Several capitals''

The period of political disunity between the Tang and the Song, known as the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period]], lasted little more than half a century, from 907 to 960. During this brief era, when China was in all respects a multi-state system, five regimes succeeded one another rapidly in control of the old Imperial heartland in northern China. During this same time, 10 more stable regimes occupied sections of southern and western China, so the period is also referred to as that of the Ten Kingdoms.

===Song, Liao, Jin, and Western Xia Dynasties (AD 960–1234)===
[[Image:Li Di, Homeward Oxherds in Wind and Rain.jpg|thumb|''Homeward Oxherds in Wind and Rain'', by Li Di, 12th century]]

In 960, the [[Song Dynasty]] gained power over most of China and established its capital in [[Kaifeng]] (later known as [[Bianjing]]), starting a period of economic prosperity, while the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao Dynasty]] ruled over [[Manchuria]], present-day [[Mongolia]], and parts of [[North China|Northern China]]. In 1115, the [[Jurchen]] [[Jin Dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin Dynasty]] emerged to prominence, annihilating the Liao Dynasty in 10 years. Meanwhile, in what are now the northwestern Chinese provinces of [[Gansu]], [[Shaanxi]], and [[Ningxia]], there emerged a [[Western Xia|Western Xia Dynasty]] from 1032 to 1227, established by [[Tangut]] tribes.

The Jin Dynasty took power over northern China and Kaifeng from the Song Dynasty, which moved its capital to [[Hangzhou]] (杭州). The Southern Song Dynasty also suffered the humiliation of having to acknowledge the Jin Dynasty as formal overlords. In the ensuing years, China was divided between the Song Dynasty, the Jin Dynasty and the [[Tangut]] [[Western Xia]]. Southern Song experienced a period of great technological development which can be explained in part by the military pressure that it felt from the north. This included the use of [[gunpowder]] weapons, which played a large role in the Song Dynasty naval victories against the Jin in the [[Battle of Tangdao]] and [[Battle of Caishi]] on the Yangtze River in 1161. Furthermore, China's first permanent standing [[navy]] was assembled and provided an [[admiral]]'s office at [[Dinghai]] in 1132, under the reign of [[Emperor Renzong of Song]].

The Song Dynasty is considered by many to be classical China's high point in science and technology, with innovative [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-officials]] such as [[Su Song]] (1020–1101) and [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095). There was court intrigue between the political rivals of the Reformers and Conservatives, led by the chancellors [[Wang Anshi]] and [[Sima Guang]], respectively. By the mid-to-late 13th century the Chinese had adopted the dogma of [[Neo-Confucian]] philosophy formulated by [[Zhu Xi]]. There were enormous literary works compiled during the Song Dynasty, such as the historical work of the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]''. Culture and the arts flourished, with grandiose artworks such as ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' and ''[[Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute]]'', while there were great Buddhist painters such as [[Lin Tinggui]].

===Yuan Dynasty (AD 1271–1368)===

''Capitals: [[Xanadu]] and [[Khanbaliq]]''

The [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-founded [[Jin Dynasty, 1115–1234|Jin Dynasty]] was defeated by the [[Mongols]], who then proceeded to defeat the Southern Song in a long and bloody war, the first war in which firearms played an important role. During the era after the war, later called the ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'', adventurous Westerners such as [[Marco Polo]] travelled all the way to China and brought the first reports of its wonders to Europe. In the Yuan Dynasty, the Mongols were divided between those who wanted to remain based in the steppes and those who wished to adopt the customs of the Chinese.

[[Kublai Khan]], grandson of [[Genghis Khan]], wanting to adopt the customs of China, established the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. This was the first dynasty to rule the whole of China from [[Beijing]] as the capital. Beijing had been ceded to Liao in AD 938 with the [[Sixteen Prefectures|Sixteen Prefectures of Yan Yun]]. Before that, it had been the capital of the [[Jin Dynasty, 1115–1234|Jin]], who did not rule all of China.

Before the [[Timeline of Mongol conquests|Mongol invasion]], Chinese dynasties reportedly had approximately 120 million inhabitants; after the conquest was completed in 1279, the 1300 census reported roughly 60 million people.&lt;ref&gt;Ping-ti Ho, &quot;An Estimate of the Total Population of Sung-Chin China&quot;, in ''Études Song'', Series 1, No 1, (1970) pp. 33-53.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is tempting to attribute this major decline solely to Mongol ferocity, scholars today have mixed sentiments regarding this subject. Scholars such as Frederick W. Mote argue that the wide drop in numbers reflects an administrative failure to record rather than a de facto decrease whilst others such as Timothy Brook argue that the Mongols created a system of enserfment among a huge portion of the Chinese populace causing many to disappear from the census altogether. Other historians like William McNeill and David Morgan argue that the Bubonic Plague was the main factor behind the demographic decline during this period. The 14th century epidemics of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] ([[Black Death]]) is estimated to have killed 30% of the population of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://chip.med.nyu.edu/course/view.php?id=13&amp;topic=1 |title = Course: Plague |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071118121009/http://chip.med.nyu.edu/course/view.php?id=13&amp;topic=1 |archivedate = 2007-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Black_Death_-_Consequences/id/617544|title = Black Death - Consequences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Yuan Dynasty, which lasted less than a century, there was relatively strong sentiment among the populace against the Mongol rule. The frequent natural disasters since the 1340s finally led to peasant revolts. The Yuan Dynasty was eventually overthrown by the [[Ming Dynasty]] in 1368.

Urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex. Large urban centers, such as [[Nanjing]] and [[Beijing]], also contributed to the growth of private industry. In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however, relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil.

Despite the [[xenophobia]] and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of [[neo-Confucianism]], China under the early Ming Dynasty was not isolated. Foreign trade and other contacts with the outside world, particularly [[Japan]], increased considerably. Chinese merchants explored all of the [[Indian Ocean]], reaching [[East Africa]] with the voyages of [[Zheng He]].

[[Zhu Yuanzhang]] or ([[Hongwu Emperor of China|Hong-wu]], the founder of the dynasty, laid the foundations for a state interested less in commerce and more in extracting revenues from the agricultural sector. Perhaps because of the Emperor's background as a peasant, the Ming economic system emphasized agriculture, unlike that of the Song and the Mongolian Dynasties, which relied on traders and merchants for revenue. Neo-feudal landholdings of the Song and Mongol periods were expropriated by the Ming rulers. Land estates were confiscated by the government, fragmented, and rented out. Private slavery was forbidden. Consequently, after the death of [[Yongle Emperor of China|Emperor Yong-le]], independent peasant landholders predominated in Chinese agriculture. These laws might have paved the way to removing the worst of the poverty during the previous regimes.

[[File:Ming-Empire2.jpg|left|thumb|Ming China under the reign of the [[Yongle Emperor]]]]
The dynasty had a strong and complex central government that unified and controlled the empire. The emperor's role became more autocratic, although Zhu Yuanzhang necessarily continued to use what he called the &quot;[[Grand Secretariat|Grand Secretaries]]&quot; (内阁) to assist with the immense paperwork of the bureaucracy, including memorials (petitions and recommendations to the throne), imperial edicts in reply, reports of various kinds, and tax records. It was this same bureaucracy that later prevented the Ming government from being able to adapt to changes in society, and eventually led to its decline.

Emperor Yong-le strenuously tried to extend China's influence beyond its borders by demanding other rulers send ambassadors to China to present tribute. A large navy was built, including four-masted ships displacing 1,500&amp;nbsp;tons. A standing army of 1 million troops (some estimate as many as 1.9 million {{Who|date=March 2009}}) was created. The Chinese armies [[Lê Lợi|conquered Vietnam]] for around 20 years, while the Chinese fleet sailed the China seas and the Indian Ocean, cruising as far as the east coast of Africa. The Chinese gained influence in eastern [[Moghulistan]]. Several maritime Asian nations sent envoys with tribute for the Chinese emperor. Domestically, the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] was expanded and proved to be a stimulus to domestic trade. Over 100,000&amp;nbsp;tons of iron per year were produced. Many books were printed using movable type. The imperial palace in Beijing's [[Forbidden City]] reached its current splendor. It was also during these centuries that the potential of south China came to be fully exploited. New crops were widely cultivated and industries such as those producing porcelain and textiles flourished.

In 1449 [[Esen Tayisi]] led an [[Oirats|Oirat]] Mongol invasion of northern China which culminated in the capture of the [[Zhengtong Emperor]] at [[Battle of Tumu Fortress|Tumu]]. In 1542 the Mongol leader [[Altan Khan]] began to harass China along the northern border. In 1550 he even reached the suburbs of Beijing. The empire also had to deal with [[Wokou|Japanese pirates]] attacking the southeastern coastline;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;China &gt; History &gt; The Ming dynasty &gt; Political history &gt; The dynastic succession&quot;, ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Qi Jiguang]] was instrumental in defeating these pirates. The deadliest earthquake of all times, the [[1556 Shaanxi earthquake|Shaanxi earthquake]] of 1556 that killed approximately 830,000 people, occurred during the [[Jiajing Emperor]]'s reign.

During the Ming dynasty the last construction on the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] was undertaken to protect China from foreign invasions. While the Great Wall had been built in earlier times, most of what is seen today was either built or repaired by the Ming. The brick and granite work was enlarged, the watch towers were redesigned, and cannons were placed along its length.

===Qing Dynasty (AD 1644–1911)===

''Capitals: [[Shenyang]] and [[Beijing]]''

The [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644–1911) was founded after the defeat of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]], the last [[Han Chinese]] [[dynasty]], by the [[Manchus]]. The Manchus were formerly known as the ''[[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]''. When Beijing was captured by [[Li Zicheng]]'s peasant rebels in 1644, the last Ming Emperor [[Chongzhen]] committed suicide. The Manchu then allied with Ming Dynasty general [[Wu Sangui]] and seized control of [[Beijing]], which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty. The Manchus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule of [[China proper]].

The Manchus enforced a 'queue order' forcing the Han Chinese to adopt the Manchu [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue hairstyle]] and Manchu-style clothing. The traditional Han clothing, or ''[[Hanfu]]'', was also replaced by Manchu-style clothing ''[[Qipao]]'' ([[Eight Banners|bannermen]] dress and ''[[Tangzhuang]]''). [[Kangxi Emperor of China|Emperor Kangxi]] ordered the creation of [[Kangxi Dictionary|the most complete dictionary]] of [[Chinese character]]s ever put together at the time. The Qing dynasty set up the &quot;[[Eight Banners]]&quot; system that provided the basic framework for the Qing military organization. The bannermen were prohibited from participating in trade and manual labour unless they petitioned to be removed from banner status. They were considered a form of nobility and were given preferential treatment in terms of annual pensions, land and allotments of cloth.

Over the next half-century, the Qing consolidated control of some areas originally under the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]], including [[Yunnan]]. They also stretched their sphere of influence over [[Xinjiang]], [[Tibet]] and [[Mongolia]]. But during the 19th century, Qing control weakened. Britain's desire to continue its [[opium]] trade with China collided with imperial edicts prohibiting the addictive drug, and the [[First Opium War]] erupted in 1840. [[Hong Kong]] was ceded to Britain in 1842 under the [[Treaty of Nanking]].

A large rebellion, the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1851–1864), involved around a third of China falling under control of the Taiping Tianguo, a quasi-Christian religious movement led by the &quot;Heavenly King&quot; [[Hong Xiuquan]]. Only after fourteen years were the Taipings finally crushed - the Taiping army was destroyed in the [[Third Battle of Nanking]] in 1864. The death toll during the 15 years of the rebellion was about 20 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Userserols&quot;&gt;Userserols. &quot;[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/wars19c.htm Userserols].&quot; ''Statistics of Wars, Oppressions and Atrocities of the Nineteenth Century.'' Retrieved on 2007-04-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, more costly rebellions in terms of human lives and economics followed with the [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]], [[Nien Rebellion]], [[Dungan revolt|Muslim Rebellion]], [[Panthay Rebellion]] and the [[Boxer Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;Damsan Harper, Steve Fallon, Katja Gaskell, Julie Grundvig, Carolyn Heller, Thomas Huhti, Bradley Maynew, Christopher Pitts. Lonely Planet China. 9. 2005. ISBN 1-74059-687-0&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, the rebellions and the [[unequal treaties]] the Qing were forced to sign with the imperialist powers are symptomatic of the Qing's inability to deal with the new challenges of the 19th century.

[[Image:The Portrait of the Qing Dynasty Cixi Imperial Dowager Empress of China in the 1900s.PNG|thumb|upright|The [[Empress Dowager Cixi]]]]
By the 1860s, the [[Qing]] Dynasty had put down the rebellions at enormous cost and loss of life. This undermined the credibility of the Qing regime and, spearheaded by local initiatives by provincial leaders and gentry, contributed to the rise of [[warlordism]] in China. The Qing Dynasty under the [[Emperor Guangxu]] proceeded to deal with the problem of modernization through the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]]. However, between 1898 and 1908 the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] had the reformist Guangxu imprisoned for being &quot;mentally disabled&quot;{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. The Empress Dowager, with the help of conservatives, initiated a military coup, effectively removed the young Emperor from power, and overturned most of the more radical reforms. Guangxu died one day before the death of the Empress Dowager (some believe he was poisoned by Cixi). Official corruption, cynicism, and imperial family quarrels made most of the military reforms useless. As a result, the Qing's &quot;[[New Armies]]&quot; were soundly defeated in the [[Sino-French War (1883-1885)]] and the [[Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895)]].

At the start of the 20th century, the [[Boxer Rebellion]] threatened northern China. This was a conservative anti-imperialist movement that sought to return China to old ways. The Empress Dowager, probably seeking to ensure her continued grip on power, sided with the Boxers when they advanced on Beijing. In response, a [[China Relief Expedition|relief expedition]] of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] invaded China to rescue the besieged foreign missions. Consisting of British, Japanese, Russian, Italian, German, French, US and Austrian troops, the alliance defeated the Boxers and demanded further concessions from the Qing government.

''Capitals: [[Nanjing]], [[Beijing]], [[Chongqing]], and several short-lived wartime capitals; [[Taipei]] after 1949''

Frustrated by the Qing court's resistance to reform and by China's weakness, young officials, military officers, and students began to advocate the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the creation of a republic. They were inspired by the revolutionary ideas of [[Sun Yat-sen]]. When Sun Yat-sen was asked by one of the leading revolutionary generals to what he ascribed the success, he said, &quot;To Christianity more than to any other single cause. Along with its ideals of religious freedom, and along with these it inculcates everywhere a doctrine of universal love and peace. These ideals appeal to the Chinese; they largely caused the Revolution, and they largely determined its peaceful character.&quot;

[[File:Sunyatsen1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sun Yat-sen]], founder and first president of the Republic of China.]]
[[Slavery]] in China was abolished in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.uclan.ac.uk/facs/class/cfe/ceth/abolition/history.htm |title = Commemoration of the Abolition of Slavery Project |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071114095017/http://www.uclan.ac.uk/facs/class/cfe/ceth/abolition/history.htm |archivedate = 2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A revolutionary military uprising, the [[Wuchang Uprising]], began on October 10, 1911 in [[Wuhan]]. The provisional government of the [[Republic of China]] was formed in [[Nanjing]] on March 12, 1912 with [[Sun Yat-sen]] as [[President of the Republic of China|President]], but Sun was forced to turn power over to [[Yuan Shikai]], who commanded the [[New Army]] and was [[Prime Minister]] under the Qing government, as part of the agreement to let the [[Ai-xin-jue-luo Pu-yi|last Qing monarch]] abdicate (a decision Sun would later regret). Over the next few years, Yuan proceeded to abolish the national and provincial assemblies, and declared himself emperor in late 1915. Yuan's imperial ambitions were fiercely opposed by his subordinates; faced with the prospect of rebellion, he abdicated in March 1916, and died in June of that year. His death left a power vacuum in China; the republican government was all but shattered. This ushered in the [[warlord era]], during which much of the country was ruled by shifting coalitions of competing provincial military leaders.

In 1919, the [[May Fourth Movement]] began as a response to the terms imposed on China by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] ending [[World War I]], but quickly became a protest movement about the domestic situation in China. The discrediting of liberal Western philosophy amongst Chinese intellectuals was followed by the adoption of more radical lines of thought. This in turn planted the seeds for the irreconcilable conflict between the left and right in China that would dominate Chinese history for the rest of the century.

In the 1920s, [[Sun Yat-Sen]] established a revolutionary base in south China, and set out to unite the fragmented nation. With Soviet assistance, he entered into an alliance with the fledgling [[Communist Party of China]]. After Sun's death from cancer in 1925, one of his protégés, [[Chiang Kai-shek]], seized control of the [[Kuomintang|''Kuomintang'' (Nationalist Party or KMT)]] and succeeded in bringing most of south and central China under its rule in a military campaign known as the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]]. Having defeated the warlords in south and central China by military force, Chiang was able to secure the nominal allegiance of the warlords in the North. In 1927, Chiang turned on the CPC and relentlessly chased the CPC armies and its leaders from their bases in southern and eastern China. In 1934, driven from their mountain bases such as the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]], the CPC forces embarked on the [[Long March]] across China's most desolate terrain to the northwest, where they established a guerrilla base at [[Yan'an]] in [[Shaanxi]] Province.

During the [[Long March]], the communists reorganized under a new leader, [[Mao Zedong]] (Mao Tse-tung). The bitter struggle between the KMT and the CPC continued, openly or clandestinely, through the 14-year long Japanese occupation (1931–1945) of various parts of the country. The two Chinese parties nominally formed a united front to oppose the Japanese in 1937, during the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)]], which became a part of [[World War II]]. Following the defeat of Japan in 1945, the war between the KMT and the CPC resumed, after failed attempts at reconciliation and a negotiated settlement. By 1949, the CPC had occupied most of the country. ''(see [[Chinese Civil War]])''

At the end of WWII in 1945 as part of the overall Japanese surrender, Japanese troops in Taiwan surrendered to Republic of China troops giving Chiang Kai-shek effective control of Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taiwandocuments.org/ghq.htm Surrender Order of the Imperial General Headquarters of Japan], 2 September 1945, &quot;(a) The senior Japanese commanders and all ground, sea, air, and auxiliary forces within China (excluding Manchuria), [[Formosa]], and [[French Indochina]] north of 16 degrees north latitude shall surrender to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; When Chiang was defeated by CPC forces in mainland China in 1949, he retreated to [[Taiwan]] with his government and his most disciplined troops, along with most of the KMT leadership and a large number of their supporters.

With the CPC's victory, and their proclamation of the [[People's Republic of China]] on October 1, 1949, Taiwan was again politically separated from mainland China, and continues to be governed by the [[Republic of China]] to the present day. No peace treaty has ever been signed between the two opposing parties.

==History of the civil engineering profession==
{{See also|History of structural engineering}}
[[Image:FalkirkWheelSide 2004 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Falkirk Wheel]] in [[Scotland]].]]

Engineering has been an aspect of life since the beginnings of human existence. The earliest practices of Civil engineering may have commenced between 4000 and 2000 BC in [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]] (Ancient Iraq) when humans started to abandon a [[nomad]]ic existence, thus causing a need for the construction of shelter. During this time, [[transport]]ation became increasingly important leading to the development of the [[wheel]] and [[Maritime history|sailing]].

Until modern times there was no clear distinction between civil engineering and [[architecture]], and the term engineer and [[architect]] were mainly geographical variations referring to the same person, often used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=VQYeHMGp2gwC&amp;q=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&amp;dq=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&amp;pgis=1 ''The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance''] Jacob Burckhardt ISBN 0-8052-1082-2&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of [[Egyptian pyramids|Pyramids]] in Egypt (circa 2700-2500 BC) might be considered the first instances of large structure constructions. Other ancient historic civil engineering constructions include the [[Parthenon]] by [[Iktinos]] in [[Ancient Greece]] (447-438 BC), the [[Appian Way]] by [[Roman engineering|Roman engineers]] (c. 312 BC), the [[Great Wall of China]] by General [[Meng Tian|Meng T'ien]] under orders from Ch'in Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang|Shih Huang Ti]] (c. 220 BC)&lt;ref name=&quot;Oakes&quot;/&gt; and the stupas constructed in ancient [[Sri Lanka]] like the [[Jetavanaramaya]] and the extensive irrigation works in [[Anuradhapura]]. The Romans developed civil structures throughout their empire, including especially [[aqueducts]], [[insulae]], [[harbours]], bridges, dams and roads.

[[Image:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|thumb|250px|The [[Archimedes screw]] was operated by hand and could raise water efficiently.]]

In the 18th century, the term civil engineering was coined to incorporate all things civilian as opposed to military engineering.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;
The first self-proclaimed civil engineer was [[John Smeaton]] who constructed the [[Eddystone Lighthouse]].&lt;ref name=CSCE/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oakes&quot;/&gt; In 1771 Smeaton and some of his colleagues formed the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers, a group of leaders of the profession who met informally over dinner. Though there was evidence of some technical meetings, it was little more than a social society.

In 1818 the Institution of Civil Engineers was founded in [[London]], and in 1820 the eminent engineer [[Thomas Telford]] became its first president. The institution received a Royal Charter in 1828, formally recognising civil engineering as a profession. Its charter defined civil engineering as:

{{quote|the art of directing the great sources of power in nature for the use and convenience of man, as the means of production and of traffic in states, both for external and internal trade, as applied in the construction of roads, bridges, aqueducts, canals, river navigation and docks for internal intercourse and exchange, and in the construction of ports, harbours, moles, breakwaters and lighthouses, and in the art of navigation by artificial power for the purposes of commerce, and in the construction and application of machinery, and in the drainage of cities and towns.&lt;ref name=ICE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ice.org|title=Institution of Civil Engineers' website|accessdate=2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first private college to teach Civil Engineering in the United States was [[Norwich University]] founded in 1819 by Captain Alden Partridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norwich.edu/about/legacy.html &quot;Norwich University Legacy Website&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The first degree in Civil Engineering in the United States was awarded by [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;Griggs, Francis E Jr. &quot;Amos Eaton was Right!&quot;. ''Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice'', Vol. 123, No. 1, January 1997, pp. 30–34. See also [http://www.lib.rpi.edu/Archives/timeline/all_time/index.html RPI Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; The first such degree to be awarded to a woman was granted by [[Cornell University]] to [[Nora Stanton Blatch]] in 1905.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9124919/Nora-Stanton-Blatch-Barney | accessdate=2010-10-08 | title=Nora Stanton Blatch Barney | work=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of civil engineering==

[[Image:Pont du gard.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Pont du Gard]], [[France]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] aqueduct built circa 19 BC.]]

Civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles, and its history is intricately linked to advances in understanding of [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] throughout history. Because civil engineering is a wide ranging profession, including several separate specialized sub-disciplines, its history is linked to knowledge of [[structures]], materials science, [[geography]], [[geology]], [[soil]]s, [[hydrology]], [[Environmental science|environment]], [[mechanics]] and other fields.

Throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction was carried out by [[artisan]]s, such as [[masonry|stone masons]] and [[carpenter]]s, rising to the role of [[Master Builder|master builder]]. Knowledge was retained in [[guilds]] and seldom supplanted by advances. Structures, roads and infrastructure that existed were repetitive, and increases in scale were incremental.&lt;ref name=Saouma&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceae.colorado.edu/~saouma/Lecture-Notes/se.pdf|title=Lecture notes in Structural Engineering|author=Victor E. Saouma|publisher=University of Colorado|accessdate=2007-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest examples of a scientific approach to physical and mathematical problems applicable to civil engineering is the work of [[Archimedes]] in the 3rd century BC, including Archimedes Principle, which underpins our understanding of [[buoyancy]], and practical solutions such as [[Archimedes' screw]].  [[Brahmagupta]], an Indian mathematician, used arithmetic in the 7th century AD, based on Hindu-Arabic numerals, for excavation (volume) computations.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Thomas Colebrook, [http://books.google.com/books?id=A3cAAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=brahmagupta ''Algebra: with Arithmetic and mensuration''] (London 1817) &lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and licensure===
{{Main|Civil engineer}}
[[Image:Instituion of Civil Engineers.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The Institution of Civil Engineers headquarters in London]]

Civil engineers typically possess an [[academic degree]] with a major in civil engineering. The length of study for such a degree is usually three to five years and the completed degree is usually designated as a [[Bachelor of Engineering]], though some universities designate the degree as a [[Bachelor of Science]]. The degree generally includes units covering physics, mathematics, [[project management]], [[design]] and specific topics in civil engineering. Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the sub-disciplines of civil engineering. Students then choose to specialize in one or more sub-disciplines towards the end of the degree.&lt;ref&gt;Various undergraduate degree requirements at [http://cee.mit.edu/index.pl?id=10951&amp;isa=Category&amp;op=show MIT], [http://ceenve.calpoly.edu/media/files/cecurriculum0709.pdf Cal Poly], [http://www.civil.queensu.ca/undergraduate/documents/newcivlengprogrm2007-08.doc Queen's] and [http://www.port.ac.uk/courses/coursetypes/undergraduate/BEngHonsCivilEngineering/whatwillistudy/ Portsmouth]&lt;/ref&gt; While an Undergraduate (BEng/BSc) Degree will normally provide successful students with industry accredited qualification, some universities offer postgraduate engineering awards (MEng/MSc) which allow students to further specialize in their particular area of interest within engineering.&lt;ref name=&quot;CITE Postgrad&quot;&gt;,{{cite web|url= http://www.uel.ac.uk/cite/programmes/postgraduate/index.htm|title= CITE Postgrad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries, a Bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards [[professional certification]] and the degree program itself is certified by a [[professional body]]. After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience and exam requirements) before being certified. Once certified, the engineer is designated the title of Professional Engineer (in the United States, Canada and [[South Africa]]), [[Chartered Engineer]] (in most [[Commonwealth]] countries), [[Chartered Professional Engineer]] (in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]), or [[European Engineer]] (in much of the [[European Union]]). There are international engineering agreements between relevant professional bodies which are designed to allow engineers to practice across international borders.

The advantages of certification vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada &quot;only a licensed engineer may prepare, sign and seal, and submit engineering plans and drawings to a public authority for approval, or seal engineering work for public and private clients.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Why Should You Get Licensed? | work = National Society of Professional Engineers | url = http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | accessdate = 2007-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as [[Quebec|Quebec's]] Engineers Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Engineers Act | work = Quebec Statutes and Regulations (CanLII) | url = http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/i-9/20050616/whole.html | accessdate = 2007-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, no such legislation exists. In Australia, state licensing of engineers is limited to the state of [[Queensland]]. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a [[code of ethics]] that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ethics Codes and Guidelines | work = Online Ethics Center | url = http://onlineethics.org/CMS/profpractice/ethcodes.aspx | accessdate = 2007-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to [[contract law]]. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the [[negligence|tort of negligence]] and, in extreme cases, the charge of [[criminal negligence]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations such as [[building codes]] and legislation pertaining to [[environmental law]].

===Careers===
There is no one typical career path for civil engineers. Most people who graduate with civil engineering degrees start with jobs that require a low level of responsibility, and as the new engineers prove their competence, they are trusted with tasks that have larger consequences and require a higher level of responsibility. However,  within each branch of civil engineering career path options vary. In some fields and firms, entry-level engineers are put to work primarily monitoring construction in the field, serving as the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; of senior design engineers; while in other areas, entry-level engineers perform the more routine tasks of analysis or design and interpretation. Experienced engineers generally do more complex analysis or design work, or management of more complex design projects, or management of other engineers, or into specialized consulting, including [[forensic engineering]].

==Sub-disciplines==

In general, civil engineering is concerned with the overall interface of human created fixed projects with the greater world. General civil engineers work closely with surveyors and specialized civil engineers to fit and serve fixed projects within their given site, community and terrain by designing grading, drainage, [[Pavement (material)|pavement]], water supply, sewer service, electric and communications supply, and land divisions. General engineers spend much of their time visiting project sites, developing community consensus, and preparing construction plans. General civil engineering is also referred to as [[site engineering]], a branch of civil engineering that primarily focuses on converting a tract of land from one usage to another. Civil engineers typically apply the principles of geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, environmental engineering, transportation engineering and construction engineering to residential, commercial, industrial and public works projects of all sizes and levels of construction.

===Coastal engineering===
{{Main|Coastal management}}

Coastal engineering is concerned with managing coastal areas.
In some jurisdictions the terms sea defense and coastal protection are used to mean, respectively, defence against flooding and erosion. The term coastal defence is the more traditional term, but coastal management has become more popular as the field has expanded to include techniques that allow erosion to claim land.

[[Image:BuildingSite.jpg|thumb|Building construction for several apartment blocks]]

===Construction engineering===
{{Main|Construction engineering}}

Construction engineering involves planning and execution of the designs from transportation, site development, hydraulic, environmental, structural and geotechnical engineers. As construction firms tend to have higher business risk than other types of civil engineering firms, many construction engineers tend to take on a role that is more business-like in nature: drafting and reviewing [[contract]]s, evaluating [[Logistics|logistical operations]], and closely-monitoring prices of necessary supplies.

===Earthquake engineering===
{{Main|Earthquake engineering}}

Earthquake engineering covers ability of various structures to withstand hazardous [[earthquake]] exposures at the sites of their particular location.[[File:Chichen Itza 3.jpg|thumb|left|Earthquake-proof and massive pyramid [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza]]]]

[[Earthquake engineering]] is a sub discipline of the broader category of Structural engineering. The main objectives of earthquake engineering are:&lt;ref&gt;Chen W-F, Scawthorn C. Earthquake Engineering Handbook, CRC Press, 2003, ISBN 0849300681, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Snapshot of base isolation effect.jpg|thumb|696 × 700 px|right|Snapshot from [[shake-table video]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzVvd4Dk6sw&amp;locale=en_US&amp;persist_locale=1] of testing base-isolated (right) and regular (left) building model]]

* Understand interaction of [[structure]]s with the shaky ground.

* Foresee the consequences of possible earthquakes.

* Design, construct and maintain structures to [[seismic performance|perform]] at earthquake exposure up to the expectations and in compliance with [[building code]]s.

===Environmental engineering===
{{Main|Environmental engineering}}
[[Image:Trickling filter bed 2 w.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A filter bed, a part of [[sewage treatment]]]]

Environmental engineering deals with the treatment of chemical, biological, and/or thermal waste, the purification of water and air, and the [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of contaminated sites, due to prior waste disposal or accidental contamination. Among the topics covered by environmental engineering are pollutant transport, [[water purification]], [[waste water treatment]], [[air pollution]], [[Waste management|solid waste treatment]] and [[hazardous waste|hazardous waste management]]. Environmental engineers can be involved with pollution reduction, green engineering, and [[industrial ecology]]. Environmental engineering also deals with the gathering of information on the environmental consequences of proposed actions and the assessment of effects of proposed actions for the purpose of assisting society and policy makers in the decision making process.

Environmental engineering is the contemporary term for [[sanitary engineering]], though sanitary engineering traditionally had not included much of the hazardous waste management and environmental remediation work covered by the term ''environmental engineering''. Some other terms in use are public health engineering and environmental health engineering.

===Geotechnical engineering===
[[File:Ingenieria civil 04.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Construction of an Embankment Dam in Navarra, Spain]]
{{Main|Geotechnical engineering}}

Geotechnical engineering is an area of civil engineering concerned with the [[Rock (geology)|rock]] and soil that civil engineering systems are supported by. Knowledge from the fields of geology, [[material science]] and testing, mechanics, and [[hydraulics]] are applied by geotechnical engineers to safely and economically design [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]], [[retaining wall]]s, and similar structures. Environmental concerns in relation to [[groundwater]] and [[landfill|waste disposal]] have spawned a new area of study called geoenvironmental engineering where [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] are important.&lt;ref name=&quot;mitchell&quot;&gt;Mitchell, James Kenneth (1993), Fundamentals of Soil Behavior (2nd ed.), John Wiley and Sons, pp 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shroff, Arvind V.; Shah, Dhananjay L. (2003), Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003, pp 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the unique difficulties of geotechnical engineering are the result of the variability and properties of soil. [[Boundary condition]]s are often well defined in other branches of civil engineering, but with soil, clearly defining these conditions can be impossible. The material properties and behavior of soil are also difficult to predict due to the variability of soil and limited [[geotechnical investigation|investigation]]. This contrasts with the relatively well defined material properties of [[steel]] and [[concrete]] used in other areas of civil engineering. [[Soil mechanics]], which describes the behavior of soil, is also complicated because soils exhibit nonlinear ([[stress (physics)|stress]]-dependent) [[shear strength (soil)|strength]], stiffness, and dilatancy (volume change associated with application of shear stress).&lt;ref name=&quot;mitchell&quot;/&gt;

===Water resources engineering===
{{See also|Hydraulic engineering|Hydrology}}

[[Image:Hoover dam from air.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Hoover dam]]]]

Water resources engineering is concerned with the collection and management of water (as a [[natural resource]]). As a discipline it therefore combines hydrology, environmental science, [[meteorology]], geology, [[water conservation|conservation]], and [[resource management]]. This area of civil engineering relates to the prediction and management of both the quality and the quantity of water in both underground ([[aquifers]]) and above ground (lakes, rivers, and streams) resources. Water resource engineers analyze and model very small to very large areas of the earth to predict the amount and content of water as it flows into, through, or out of a facility. Although the actual design of the facility may be left to other engineers. Hydraulic engineering is concerned with the flow and conveyance of fluids, principally water. This area of civil engineering is intimately related to the design of [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], [[water supply network]], drainage facilities (including bridges, dams, [[Channel (geography)|channel]]s, [[culvert]]s, [[levee]]s, [[storm sewer]]s), and canals. Hydraulic engineers design these facilities using the concepts of [[fluid pressure]], [[fluid statics]], [[fluid dynamics]], and hydraulics, among others.

===Materials engineering===
{{Main|Materials science}}

Another aspect of Civil engineering is materials science. Material engineering deals with ceramics such as concrete, mix asphalt concrete, metals Focus around increased strength, metals such as aluminum and steel, and polymers such as [[polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) and carbon fibers.

Materials engineering also consists of protection and prevention like paints and finishes. Alloying is another aspect of material engineering, combining two different types of metals to produce a stronger metal.

===Structural engineering===
{{Main|Structural engineering}}
[[Image:Burjdubaiaug92007.jpg|left|thumb|160px|[[Burj Khalifa]], the [[world's tallest building]], in [[Dubai]]]]
[[Image:Clifton.bridge.arp.750pix.jpg|alt=Suspension bridge between two brick built towers, over a wooded gorge, showing mud and water at the bottom. In the distance are hills.|thumb|200px|[[Clifton Suspension Bridge]], designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], in [[Bristol]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]]]

Structural engineering is concerned with the [[structural design]] and [[structural analysis]] of buildings, bridges, [[tower]]s, [[Overpass|flyover]]s, [[tunnel]]s, off shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea, and other structures. This involves identifying the loads which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads, and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those loads. The loads can be self weight of the structures, other dead load, live loads, moving (wheel) load, wind load, earthquake load, load from temperature change etc. The structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be ''serviceable''). Due to the nature of some loading conditions, sub-disciplines within structural engineering have emerged, including [[wind engineering]] and earthquake engineering.

Design considerations will include strength, stiffness, and stability of the structure when subjected to loads which may be static, such as furniture or self-weight, or dynamic, such as wind, seismic, crowd or vehicle loads, or transitory, such as temporary construction loads or impact. Other considerations include cost, constructability, [[safety]], aesthetics and [[sustainability]].

===Surveying===
{{Main|Surveying|Construction surveying}}
[[File:us land survey officer.jpg|thumb|300px|US Navy Surveyor at work with a [[leveling instrument]].]]   

Surveying is the process by which a surveyor measures certain dimensions that generally occur on the surface of the Earth. Surveying equipment, such as levels and theodolites, are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation, horizontal, vertical and slope distances. With computerisation, electronic distance measurement (EDM), total stations, GPS surveying and laser scanning have supplemented (and to a large extent supplanted) the traditional optical instruments. This information is crucial to convert the data into a graphical representation of the Earth's surface, in the form of a map. This information is then used by civil engineers, contractors and even realtors to design from, build on, and trade, respectively. Elements of a building or structure must be correctly sized and positioned in relation to each other and to site boundaries and adjacent structures. Although surveying is a distinct profession with separate qualifications and licensing arrangements, civil engineers are trained in the basics of surveying and [[map]]ping, as well as [[geographic information system]]s.
Surveyors may also lay out the routes of [[railways]], [[tramway track]]s, [[highway]]s, roads, pipelines and [[street]]s as well as position other [[infrastructure]]s, such as [[harbor]]s, before construction.

'''Land Surveying'''

In the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and most Commonwealth countries land surveying is considered to be a distinct profession.  [[Surveying#Land surveyor|Land surveyors]] are not considered to be engineers, and have their own professional associations and licencing requirements.  The services of a licenced land surveyor are generally required for boundary surveys (to establish the boundaries of a parcel using its legal description) and subdivision plans (a plot or map based on a survey of a parcel of land, with boundary lines drawn inside the larger parcel to indicated the creation of new boundary lines and roads), both of which are generally referred to as [[Cadastre#Cadastral surveys|cadastral surveying]].

'''Construction Surveying'''

Construction surveying is generally performed by specialised technicians.  Unlike land  surveyors, the resulting plan does not have legal status.  Construction surveyors perform the following tasks:

* Survey existing conditions of the future work site, including topography, existing buildings and infrastructure, and even including underground infrastructure whenever possible;
* Construction surveying (otherwise &quot;lay-out&quot; or &quot;setting-out&quot;): to stake out reference points and markers that will guide the construction of new structures such as roads or buildings for subsequent construction;
* Verify the location of structures during construction;
* As-Built surveying: a survey conducted at the end of the construction project to verify that the work authorized was completed to the specifications set on plans.

===Transportation engineering===
{{Main|Transport engineering}}

Transportation engineering is concerned with moving people and goods efficiently, safely, and in a manner conducive to a vibrant community. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining transportation infrastructure which includes [[streets]], [[canals]], [[highways]], [[rail transport|rail systems]], [[airport]]s, [[port]]s, and [[mass transit]]. It includes areas such as transportation design, [[transportation planning]], [[traffic engineering]], some aspects of [[municipal or urban engineering|urban engineering]], [[queueing theory]], [[pavement engineering]], [[Intelligent Transportation System]] (ITS), and infrastructure management.

===Municipal or urban engineering===
{{Main|Urban engineering}}

Municipal engineering is concerned with [[municipality|municipal]] infrastructure. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining streets, [[sidewalks]], [[municipal water supply|water supply networks]], sewers, [[street light]]ing, [[municipal solid waste]] management and disposal, storage depots for various bulk materials used for maintenance and public works (salt, sand, etc.), [[urban park|public parks]] and [[segregated cycle facilities|bicycle paths]].  In the case of underground [[public utility|utility]] networks, it may also include the civil portion (conduits and access chambers) of the local distribution networks of electrical and telecommunications services.  It can also include the optimizing of waste collection and [[public transport bus service|bus service]] networks. Some of these disciplines overlap with other civil engineering specialties, however municipal engineering focuses on the coordination of these infrastructure networks and services, as they are often built simultaneously, and managed by the same municipal authority.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Neolithic}}
'''Çatalhöyük''' ({{IPA-tr|tʃaˈtaɫhøjyc}}; also ''Çatal Höyük'' and ''Çatal Hüyük'', or any of the three without [[diacritic]]s; ''çatal'' is [[Turkish language|Turkish]] for &quot;fork&quot;, ''höyük'' for &quot;mound&quot;) was a very large [[Neolithic]] and [[Chalcolithic]] settlement in southern [[Anatolia]], which existed from approximately 7500&amp;nbsp;BC to 5700&amp;nbsp;BC. It is the largest and best preserved Neolithic site found to date.

Çatalhöyük is located overlooking wheat fields in the Konya Plain, southeast of the present-day city of [[Konya]] (ancient Iconium) in [[Turkey]], approximately 140&amp;nbsp;km (87&amp;nbsp;mi) from the twin-coned volcano of [[Mount Hasan]]. The eastern settlement forms a mound which would have risen about 20 m (66&amp;nbsp;ft) above the plain at the time of the latest Neolithic occupation. There is also a smaller settlement mound to the west and a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] settlement a few hundred meters to the east. The prehistoric mound settlements were abandoned before the [[Bronze Age]]. A channel of the [[Çarşamba]] river once flowed between the two mounds, and the settlement was built on alluvial clay which may have been favourable for early [[agriculture]].

==Archaeology==
The site was first excavated by [[James Mellaart]] in 1958. He later led a team which excavated there for four seasons between 1961 and 1965.&lt;ref&gt;J. Mellaart, Excavations at Çatal Hüyük, first preliminary report: 1961. Anatolian Studies, vol. 12, pp. 41-65, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Mellaart, Excavations at Çatal Hüyük, second preliminary report: 1962. Anatolian Studies, vol. 13, pp. 43-103, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Mellaart, Excavations at Çatal Hüyük, third preliminary report: 1963. Anatolian Studies, vol. 14, pp. 39-119, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Mellaart, Excavations at Çatal Hüyük, fourth preliminary report: 1965. Anatolian Studies, vol. 16, pp. 15-191, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; These excavations revealed this section of [[Anatolia]] as a centre of advanced culture in the [[Neolithic]] period.&lt;ref name=gard&gt;{{cite book | first = Fred S. | last = Kleiner | coauthors = Mamiya, Christin J. | year = 2006 | title = Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective: Volume 1 | edition = Twelfth | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | location = Belmont, California | isbn = 0-495-00479-0 | pages = 12–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mellaart was banned from Turkey for his involvement in the [[James Mellaart#Dorak Affair|Dorak affair]] in which he published drawings of supposedly important Bronze Age artifacts that later went missing.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Pearson and Patricia Connor, The Dorak affair, New York, Atheneum, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

After this scandal, the site lay idle until September 12, 1993, when investigations began under the leadership of [[Ian Hodder]] then at the [[University of Cambridge]]. These investigations are among the most ambitious excavation projects currently in progress according to, among others, [[Colin Renfrew]]. In addition to extensive use of [[archaeological science]], psychological and artistic interpretations of the [[symbol]]ism of the [[Wall painting in Turkey|wall paintings]] have also been employed. Hodder, a former student of Mellaart, chose the site as the first real world test of his then controversial academic theory of [[post-processual archaeology]].

Brigid Gallagher, of British Channel 4 Time Team fame, is currently joint project conservator, with Ian Hodder, for Catalhoyuk, a project on which she works every year.

[[Image:Catal Hüyük Restauration B.JPG|left|thumb|200px|On-site restoration of a typical interior]]
&lt;!--DO NOT try to correct the name of this picture to &quot;CatalHüyük Restauration B.JPG&quot;, it will just mess it up.  Thank you.--&gt;The entire settlement of Çatalhöyük was composed of domestic buildings; the site has no obvious public buildings. While some of the larger buildings contain rather ornate wall [[murals]], the purpose of such rooms remains unclear.&lt;ref name=gard/&gt;

The population of the eastern mound has been estimated at up to 10,000 people, but population totals likely varied over the community’s history. An average population of between 5,000 to 8,000 is a reasonable estimate. The inhabitants lived in mud-brick houses which were crammed together in an agglutinative manner. No footpaths or streets were used between the dwellings, which were clustered in a honeycomb-like maze. Most were accessed by holes in the ceiling, which were reached by interior and exterior ladders and stairs. Thus, the rooftops were used as streets. The ceiling openings also served as the only source of ventilation, letting in fresh air and allowing smoke from open hearths and ovens to escape. Also, the doors were on the ceilings of the houses, and there were stairs/ladders leading to the doors.

Houses had [[plaster]] interiors characterized by squared off timber ladders or steep stairs, usually placed on the south wall of the room, as were [[cooking hearth]]s and [[oven]]s. Each main room served as an area for cooking and daily activities. The main rooms contained raised platforms that may have been used for a range of domestic activities. All interior walls and platforms were plastered to a smooth finish.&lt;ref name=gard/&gt; Ancillary rooms were used as storage, and were accessed through low entry openings from main rooms. 

All rooms were kept scrupulously clean. Archaeologists identified very little trash or rubbish within the buildings, but found that trash heaps outside the ruins contain sewage and food waste as well as significant amounts of wood ash. In good weather, many daily activities may also have taken place on the rooftops, which conceivably formed an open air plaza. In later periods, large communal ovens appear to have been built on these rooftops. Over time, houses were renewed by partial demolition and rebuilding on a foundation of rubble&amp;mdash;which was how the mound became built up. Up to 18 levels of settlement have been uncovered.

The people of Çatalhöyük buried their dead within the village. Human remains have been found in pits beneath the floors, and especially beneath hearths, the platforms within the main rooms and under the beds. The bodies were tightly flexed before burial, and were often placed in [[baskets]] or wrapped in reed mats. Disarticulated bones in some graves suggest that bodies may have been exposed in the open air for a time before the bones were gathered and buried. In some cases, graves were disturbed and the individual’s head removed from the skeleton. These heads may have been used in ritual, as some were found in other areas of the community. Some skulls were plastered and painted with [[ochre]] to recreate human-like faces, a custom more characteristic of Neolithic sites in Syria and at Neolithic [[Jericho]] than at sites closer by.

Vivid [[murals]] and [[figurine]]s are found throughout the settlement, on interior and exterior walls. Distinctive [[clay]] figurines of women, notably the [[Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük]] (''illustration, right''), have been found in the upper levels of the site. Although no identifiable temples have been found, the graves, murals, and figurines suggest that the people of Çatalhöyük had a religion which was rich in symbols. Rooms with concentrations of these items may have been [[shrines]] or public meeting areas. Predominant images include men with erect phalluses, hunting scenes, red images of the now extinct [[aurochs]] (wild cattle) and [[stags]], and [[vultures]] swooping down on headless figures.&lt;ref name=gard/&gt; [[Relief]] figures are carved out of the walls, such as the depiction of [[lion|lioness]]es facing one another.  

Heads of animals, especially of cattle, were mounted on walls. A painting of the village with the twin mountain peaks of Hasan Dağ in the background is frequently cited as the [[History of cartography|world's oldest map]] and the first [[landscape]] painting.&lt;ref name=gard/&gt; Some archaeologists question this interpretation of the artefact. Stephanie Meece, for example, argues that it is more likely a painting of a leopard skin instead of a volcano, and a decorative geometric design instead of a map.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/195777 A bird’s eye view - of a leopard’s spots. The Çatalhöyük ‘map’ and the development of cartographic representation in prehistory.] ''Anatolian Studies'' 56, 2006, pp. 1-16. Published by The British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara&lt;/ref&gt;

The people appear to have lived relatively egalitarian lives with no apparent social classes, as no houses with distinctive features (belonging to [[Monarch|royalty]] or [[priest|religious hierarchy]], for example) have been found so far.  The most recent investigations also reveal little [[social stratification|social distinction]] based on gender, with both men and women receiving equivalent nutrition and apparently, having relatively equal social status as typically found in [[Paleolithic]] cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stavrianos&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Leften Stavros Stavrianos|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MKhe6qNva10C&amp;q=paleolithic+society&amp;dq=paleolithic+society | title=A Global History from Prehistory to the Present| location=New Jersey, USA | publisher=Prentice Hall| year=1991 | isbn=0-13-357005-3}} [http://books.google.com/books?id=MKhe6qNva10C&amp;q=paleolithic+society&amp;dq=paleolithic+society&amp;pgis=1 Pages 9-13]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gutrie&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=R Dale Gutrie|url=http://books.google.com/?id=3u6JNwMyMCEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA420,M1 | title=The Nature of Paleolithic art| location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=2005 | isbn=0-226-31126-0}} [http://books.google.com/books?id=3u6JNwMyMCEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA420,M1 Page 420-422]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MuseumofAntiquites&gt;[http://museums.ncl.ac.uk/flint/miscon.html Museum of Antiquites web site] (accessed February 13, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

In upper levels of the site, it becomes apparent that the people of Çatalhöyük were gaining skills in [[agriculture]] and the domestication of animals. Female figurines have been found within bins used for storage of [[cereal]]s such as [[wheat]] and [[barley]] that are presumed to be a deity protecting the grain. [[Peas]] were also grown, and [[almonds]], [[pistachio]]s, and fruit were harvested from trees in the surrounding hills. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] were domesticated and evidence suggests the beginning of [[cattle]] [[domestication]] as well.  However, [[hunting]] continued to be a major source of meat for the community.  The making of [[pottery]] and the construction of [[obsidian]] [[tools]] were major industries. [[Obsidian]] tools were probably both used and traded for items such as [[Mediterranean]] [[sea]] [[animal shell|shells]] and [[flint]] from [[Syria]].

A striking feature of Çatalhöyük are its female figurines.  Mellaart, the original excavator, argued that these well-formed, carefully made figurines, carved and molded from marble, blue and brown limestone, schist, calcite, basalt, alabaster, and clay, represented a [[female deity]]. Although a male deity existed as well, “…statues of a female [[deity]] far outnumber those of the male deity, who moreover, does not appear to be represented at all after Level&amp;nbsp;VI”.&lt;ref name=mellart181&gt; {{cite book | first = James | last = Mellaart |year = 1967 | title = Catal Huyuk: A Neolithic Town in Anatolia | publisher = McGraw-Hill | pages = 181}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, eighteen levels have been identified. These careful figurines were found primarily in areas Mellaart believed to be shrines. The stately goddess seated on a [[throne]] flanked by two female lions (''illustration'') was found in a grain bin, which Mellaart suggests might have been a means of ensuring the harvest or protecting the food supply.&lt;ref name=mellart180&gt;Mellaart (1967), 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas Mellaart excavated nearly two hundred buildings in four seasons, the current excavator, Ian Hodder, spent an entire season excavating one building alone.&lt;ref name=balter127&gt;{{cite book | first = Michael | last = Balter | title = The Goddess and the Bull | year = 2005 | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-7432-4360-9 | pages = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hodder and his team, in 2004 and 2005, began to believe that the patterns suggested by Mellaart were false.  They found one similar figurine, but the vast majority did not imitate the [[Mother Goddess]] style that Mellaart suggested. Instead of a Mother Goddess culture,  Hodder points out that the site gives little indication of a matriarchy or patriarchy.

{{quote|There are full breasts on which the hands rest, and the stomach is extended in the central part…. As one turns the figurine around one notices that the arms are very thin, and then on the back of the figurine one sees a depiction of either a skeleton or the bones of a very thin and depleted human. The ribs and vertebrae are clear, as are the scapulae and the main pelvic bones…. [T]his is a unique piece that may force us to change our views of the nature of Catalhoyuk society and imagery.&lt;ref name=hodder&gt;{{cite web | last = Hodder | first = Ian | title = New finds and new interpretations at Çatalhöyük | work = Çatalhöyük 2005 Archive Report | publisher = Catalhoyuk Research Project, Institute of Archaeology | date = 2005 | url = http://www.catalhoyuk.com/archive_reports/2005/ar05_01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an article in the ''Turkish Daily News'', Hodder is reported as denying that Çatalhöyük was a matriarchal society and quoted as saying &quot;When we look at what they eat and drink and at their social statues, we see that men and women had the same social status. There was a balance of power. Another example is the skulls found. If one's social status was of high importance in Çatalhöyük, the body and head were separated after death. The number of female and male skulls found during the excavations is almost equal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=93856 | title = A Journey to 9000 years ago | date = 2008-01-17 | accessdate = 2008-08-07 | last = Hodder | first = Ian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report in September 2009 on the discovery of around 2000 figurines Hodder is quoted as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Çatalhöyük was excavated in the 1960s in a methodical way, but not using the full range of natural science techniques that are available to us today. Sir James Mellaart who excavated the site in the 1960s came up with all sorts of ideas about the way the site was organised and how it was lived in and so on,” he said. “We’ve now started working there since the mid 1990s and come up with very different ideas about the site. One of the most obvious examples of that is that Çatalhöyük is perhaps best known for the idea of the mother [[goddess]]. But our work more recently has tended to show that in fact there is very little evidence of a mother goddess and very little evidence of some sort of female-based matriarchy. That’s just one of the many myths that the modern scientific work is undermining.”&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien&quot;&gt;O'Brien, Jeremy &quot;New techniques undermine 'mother goddess' role in the community&quot; ''Irish Times'' September 20, 2009 [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0910/1224254196976.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor Lynn Meskell explained that while the original excavations had found only 200 figures, the new excavations had uncovered 2000 figurines of which most were animals, with less than 5% of the figurines women.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien&quot; /&gt;

'''Clement Richard Attlee, 1st Earl Attlee''', [[Order of the Garter|KG]], [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[Order of the Companions of Honour|CH]], [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (3 January 1883 – 8 October 1967) was a [[British people|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour politician]] who served as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] of the [[United Kingdom]] from [[UK general election, 1945|1945]] to [[UK general election, 1951|1951]], and as the [[Labour_Party_(UK)#Leaders of the Labour Party since 1906|Leader]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1935|1935]] to [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1955|1955]]. He was also the first person to hold the office of [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]], under [[Winston Churchill]] in the [[Coalition Government 1940-1945|wartime coalition government]], before leading the Labour Party to a landslide election victory over Churchill's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945]]. He was the first Labour Prime Minister to serve a full Parliamentary term, and the first to command a Labour majority in Parliament.

The government he led put in place the post-war settlement, based upon the assumption that [[full employment]] would be maintained by [[Keynesian]] policies, and that a greatly enlarged system of social services would be created – aspirations that had been outlined in the wartime [[Beveridge Report]]. Within this context, his government undertook the [[nationalisation]] of major industries and [[Public utility|public utilities]] as well as the creation of the [[National Health Service]]. After initial Conservative opposition to Keynesian fiscal policy, this settlement was [[Post-war consensus|broadly accepted by all parties]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=party.history.page Conservative Party website – the postwar consensus].&lt;/ref&gt; until [[Margaret Thatcher]] became Prime Minister in 1979 and [[neoliberalism]] became mainstream.

His government also presided over the decolonisation of a large part of the [[British Empire]] when [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Burma]], [[Ceylon]] and [[Jordan]] obtained their independence. The [[British Mandate of Palestine]] also came to an end with the creation of [[Israel]] on the day of British withdrawal.

In 2004, [[Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|he was voted]] the greatest British prime minister of the 20th century in a poll of 139 academics organised by [[MORI]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=661 Ipsos MORI: Rating British Prime Ministers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==

Attlee was born in [[Putney]], [[London]], the seventh of eight children. His father was Henry Attlee (1841–1908), a solicitor, and his mother was Ellen Bravery Watson (1847–1920).

==Education==

Attlee was educated at Northaw School, a boys' preparatory school near [[Pluckley]] in [[Kent]] (which in 1952 was relocated and named Norman Court School), [[Haileybury College]], and [[University College, Oxford]], where he graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|Second Class Honours]] BA in [[Modern History]] in 1904. Attlee then trained as a lawyer, and was called to the Bar in 1906.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt;

==Life and career==

From [[1906 in the United Kingdom|1906]] to [[1909 in the United Kingdom|1909]], Attlee worked as manager of Haileybury House, a charitable club for [[working-class]] boys in [[Limehouse]] in the [[East End of London]] run by his old school. Prior to this, his political views had been [[conservative]]. However, he was shocked by the poverty and deprivation he saw while working with [[slum]] children. He came to the view that private [[Charitable organization|charity]] would never be sufficient to alleviate poverty, and only massive action and [[income redistribution]] by the [[Sovereign state|state]] would have any serious effect. This caused him to convert to [[socialism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt; He joined the [[Independent Labour Party]] in 1908, and became active in London local politics.

In 1909 he worked briefly as secretary for [[Beatrice Webb]], and from 1909 to 1910 he worked as secretary for [[Toynbee Hall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt; In 1911 he took up a government job as an 'official explainer', touring the country to explain [[David Lloyd George]]'s [[National Insurance Act]]. He spent the summer of that year touring [[Essex]] and [[Somerset]] on a bicycle, explaining the Act at public meetings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt;

Attlee became a lecturer at the [[London School of Economics]] in 1912, but promptly applied for a Commission in August 1914 for [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt;

==Military service during World War I==

During [[World War I]], Attlee was given the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] and served with the [[South Lancashire Regiment]] in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in [[Turkey]]. After a period of fighting in the heat, sand and flies he became ill with [[dysentery]] and was sent to hospital in [[Malta]] to recover. This may have saved his life, as while he was in hospital he missed the [[Battle of Sari Bair]] in which many of his comrades were killed.

Attlee had gained a reputation among his superiors as a competent leader. When he returned to the front, he was informed that his company had been chosen to hold the final lines when Gallipoli was evacuated. He was the last-but-one man to be evacuated from [[Suvla Bay]] (the last being General [[Frederick Stanley Maude|F.S. Maude]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt;

The Gallipoli Campaign had been masterminded by [[Winston Churchill]]. Attlee believed that it was a bold strategy, which could have been successful if it had been better implemented. This gave him an admiration for Churchill as a military strategist, which improved their working relationship in later years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt;

He later served in the [[Mesopotamian Campaign]] in [[Iraq]], where he was badly wounded at [[Battle of Hanna|El Hannah]] after being hit in the leg by [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] from an exploding shell while taking enemy trenches. He was sent back to England to recover, and spent most of 1917 training soldiers. He was sent to [[France]] in June 1918 to serve on [[Western Front (World War I)|the Western Front]] for the last months of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt;

In 1917 he had been promoted to the rank of [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]], and continued to be known as &quot;Major Attlee&quot; for much of the [[Interwar period|inter-war period]].

His decision to fight in the war caused a rift between him and his older brother Tom Attlee, who as a [[pacifist]] and a [[conscientious objector]] spent much of the war in prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;&gt;Beckett, Francis. (1997) ''Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett'', Richard Cohen Books, ISBN 1-86066-101-7&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, he returned to teaching at the [[London School of Economics]] until 1923.

==Marriage and children==

Attlee met [[Violet Attlee|Violet Millar]] on a trip to Italy in 1921. Within a few weeks of their return they became engaged and were married at Christ Church, [[Hampstead]] on 10 January 1922.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt; It would come to be a devoted marriage, until her death in 1964. They had four children: (Lady) Janet Helen (b. 1923), (Lady) Felicity Ann (1925–2007), [[Martin Attlee, 2nd Earl Attlee|Martin Richard]] (1927–91) and (Lady) Alison Elizabeth (b. 1930).

==Early political career==
===Local politics===

Attlee returned to [[Local government|local politics]] in the immediate post-war period, becoming mayor of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney]] in [[1919 in the United Kingdom|1919]], one of London's poorest inner-city boroughs.  During his time as mayor, the council undertook action to tackle [[slum]] [[landlord]]s who charged high rents but refused to spend money on keeping their property in habitable condition. The council served and enforced legal orders on house-owners to repair their property. It also appointed health visitors and sanitary inspectors, and reduced the infant mortality rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt;

In 1920, while mayor, he wrote his first book, &quot;''The Social Worker''&quot;, which set out many of the principles that informed his political philosophy and that were to underpin the actions of his government in later years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt; The book attacked the idea that looking after the poor could be left to voluntary action. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'Charity is a cold grey loveless thing. If a rich man wants to help the poor, he should pay his taxes gladly, not dole out money at a whim'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He went on to write: &lt;blockquote&gt;'In a civilised community, although it may be composed of self-reliant individuals, there will be some persons who will be unable at some period of their lives to look after themselves, and the question of what is to happen to them may be solved in three ways – they may be neglected, they may be cared for by the organised community as of right, or they may be left to the goodwill of individuals in the community. The first way is intolerable, and as for the third: Charity is only possible without loss of dignity between equals. A right established by law, such as that to an old age pension, is less galling than an allowance made by a rich man to a poor one, dependent on his view of the recipient’s character, and terminable at his caprice'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He strongly supported the [[Poplar Rates Rebellion]] led by [[George Lansbury]] in 1921. This put him into conflict with many of the leaders of the London Labour Party, including [[Herbert Morrison]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Attlee&quot;&gt;Howell, David.

{{Social democracy sidebar |expanded=People}}

===Member of Parliament===

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922 general election]], Attlee became the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[constituency]] of [[Limehouse (UK Parliament constituency)|Limehouse]] in [[Stepney]]. He helped [[Ramsay MacDonald]], whom at the time he admired, get elected as Labour Party leader at the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1922|1922 Labour leadership election]], a decision which he later regretted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt; He served as Ramsay MacDonald's [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|parliamentary private secretary]] for the brief 1922 parliament.

His first taste of ministerial office came in 1924, when he served as Under-Secretary of State for War in the short-lived [[First Labour Government (UK)|first Labour government]], led by MacDonald.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt;

Attlee opposed the [[UK General Strike 1926|1926 General Strike]], believing that strike action should not be used as a political weapon. However, when it happened he did not attempt to undermine it. At the time of the strike he was chairman of the Stepney Borough Electricity Committee. He negotiated a deal with the Electrical Trade Union that they would continue to supply power to hospitals, but would end supplies to factories. One firm, Scammell and Nephew Ltd, took a civil action against Attlee and the other Labour members of the committee (although not against the Conservative members who had also supported this). The court found against Attlee and his fellow councillors and they were ordered to pay £300 damages. The decision was later reversed on appeal, but the financial problems caused by the episode almost forced Attlee out of politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt;

In 1927 he was appointed a member of the multi-party [[Simon Commission]], a [[Royal Commission]] set up to examine the possibility of granting [[Self-governance|self-rule]] to [[British Raj|India]]. As a result of the time he needed to devote to the commission, and contrary to a promise made to Attlee by MacDonald to induce him to serve on the commission, he was not initially offered a ministerial post in the [[Second Labour Government]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt; However, his unsought service on the Commission was to equip Attlee (who was later to have to decide the future of India as Prime Minister) with a thorough exposure to India and many of its political leaders.

In 1930, Labour MP [[Oswald Mosley]] left the party after its rejection of his proposals for solving the unemployment problem. Attlee was given Mosley's post of [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]]. He was [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster-General]] at the time of the [[History of the British Labour Party#Great Depression and the split under MacDonald|1931 crisis]], during which most of the party's leaders lost their seats. During the course of the second Labour government, Attlee had become increasingly disillusioned by Ramsay MacDonald, whom he came to regard as [[vanity|vain]] and incompetent, and later wrote scathingly of him in his autobiography.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRmacdonald.htm Spartacus Schoolnet] – Contains excerpt from Attlee's biography towards the bottom of the page.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition during the 1930s==
===Deputy Leader of the Labour Party===

After the downfall of the second Labour government, the [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931 General Election]] was held. The election was a disaster for the Labour Party, which lost over 200 seats; most of the party's senior figures lost their seats, including [[Arthur Henderson]] the party leader. [[George Lansbury]] and Attlee were among the few surviving Labour MPs who had served in government. Accordingly, Lansbury became leader of the party and Attlee became deputy leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt;

Attlee served as acting leader for nine months from December 1933, after Lansbury fractured his thigh in an accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt; This raised his public profile. During this period, financial problems again almost forced Attlee to quit politics, as his wife was ill, and there was then no separate salary for the [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]]. He was persuaded to stay on, however, by [[Stafford Cripps]], a wealthy socialist who agreed to pay him an additional salary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt;

===Leader of the Opposition===

George Lansbury, a convinced pacifist, resigned as leader at the 1935 Labour Party conference, after the party voted in favour of sanctions against Italy for its aggression against [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], a policy which Lansbury strongly opposed. With a general election looming, the Parliamentary Labour Party then appointed Attlee as [[interim leader]], on the understanding that a leadership election would be held after the general election.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt;

Attlee led Labour through the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935 general election]], which saw the party stage a partial recovery from its disastrous performance in 1931, gaining over one hundred seats. In the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1935|post-election leadership contest]] held in November 1935, Attlee was opposed by [[Herbert Morrison]] and [[Arthur Greenwood]]. Morrison was seen as the favourite by many, but was distrusted by many sections of the party, especially the left. Arthur Greenwood's leadership bid was hampered by his [[alcoholism|alcohol problem]]. Attlee came first in both the first and second ballots, and subsequently retained the leadership, a post which he would retain until 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt;

Throughout the [[1920s]] and most of the [[1930s]], the Labour Party's official policy, supported by Attlee, was to oppose rearmament, and support [[collective security]] under the [[League of Nations]]. However, with the rising threat from [[Nazi Germany]], and the ineffectiveness of the League of Nations, this policy lost credibility. By 1937, Labour had jettisoned its pacifist position and came to support rearmament and oppose [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s policy of [[appeasement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt;

In 1937, Attlee visited [[Spain]] and visited the [[British Battalion]] of the [[International Brigades]] fighting in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt; One of the companies was named the 'Major Attlee Company' in his honour.

==Deputy Prime Minister==

[[File:Attlee 1941 P 75.jpg|thumb|250px|Attlee as Lord Privy Seal, visiting a munitions factory in 1941]]
Attlee remained opposition leader when war broke out in September 1939. The disastrous [[Norwegian campaign]] resulted in a [[Norway debate|motion of no confidence]] in the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/norway_campaign_06.shtml BBC – History – The Norway Campaign in World War Two&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Chamberlain survived this, the reputation of his administration was so badly damaged that it was clear that a [[coalition government]] was necessary. The crisis coincided with the [[Labour Party Conference]]. Even if Attlee had been prepared to serve under [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] (in a &quot;national emergency government&quot;), he would not have been able to carry the party with him. Consequently, Chamberlain tendered his resignation, and Labour and the Conservatives entered a coalition government led by [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Attlee&quot;/&gt;

In the World War II coalition government, three interconnected committees ran the war. Churchill chaired the [[War Cabinet]] and the [[Defence Committee]]. Attlee was his regular deputy in these committees, and answered for the government in parliament when Churchill was absent. Attlee chaired the third body, the [[Lord President's Committee]], which ran the civil side of the war. As Churchill was most concerned with executing the war, the arrangement suited both men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Attlee&quot;/&gt;

Only he and Churchill remained in the war cabinet from the formation of the Government of National Unity to the 1945 election. Attlee was [[Lord Privy Seal]] (1940–42), [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] (1942–45), [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs|Dominions Secretary]] (1942–43), and [[Lord President of the Council]] (1943–45). Attlee supported Churchill in his continuation of Britain's resistance after the French capitulation in 1940, and proved a loyal ally to Churchill throughout the conflict;&lt;ref name=&quot;Attlee&quot;/&gt; when the war cabinet had voted on whether to surrender, Attlee (along with fellow Labour minister [[Arthur Greenwood]]) voted in favour of fighting, giving Churchill the majority he needed to continue the war.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, Andrew: ''A History of Modern Britain'' (2009 paperback), p.&amp;nbsp;xv to xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

==1945 general election==

{{main|United Kingdom general election, 1945}}

Following the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, Attlee and Churchill wanted the coalition government to last until Japan had been defeated. However, [[Herbert Morrison]] argued that the party would not accept this, and the Labour National Executive Committee agreed with him. Churchill responded by resigning as coalition Prime Minister and decided to call an election at once.&lt;ref name=&quot;Attlee&quot;/&gt;

The war set in motion profound social changes within Britain, and led to a popular desire for [[Reform movement|social reform]]. This mood was epitomised in the [[Beveridge Report]]. The report assumed that the maintenance of full employment would be the aim of postwar governments, and that this would provide the basis for the [[welfare state]]. Immediately on its release, it sold hundreds of thousands of copies.  All major parties were committed to this aim, but perhaps Attlee and Labour were seen by the electorate as the best candidates to follow it through.

Labour campaigned on the theme of &quot;[http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/man/lab45.htm Let Us Face the Future]&quot; and positioned themselves as the party best placed to rebuild Britain after the war, while the Conservatives campaign centred around Churchill. With the hero status of Churchill, few expected a Labour victory. However Churchill made some errors during the campaign: His suggestion during a radio broadcast, that a Labour government would require &quot;some form of [[gestapo]]&quot; to implement their socialist policies, was widely seen as being in bad taste, and backfired.&lt;ref name=&quot;Attlee&quot;/&gt;

The results of the election when they were announced on 26 July, came as a surprise to almost everyone, including Attlee: Labour had been swept to power on a landslide, winning just under 50% of the vote, to the Conservatives' 36%. Labour won 393 seats, giving them a majority of 147.

The story goes that when Attlee visited [[King George VI]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] to [[Kissing Hands|kiss hands]], the notoriously laconic Attlee and the notoriously tongue-tied George VI stood for some minutes in silence, before Attlee finally volunteered the remark &quot;I've won the election.&quot;  The King replied &quot;I know. I heard it on the Six O'Clock News.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hennessy|2006|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prime Minister==

[[File:Attlee with GeorgeVI HU 59486.jpg|thumb|right|Attlee meeting King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] after Labour's election victory]]
Now Prime Minister, Attlee appointed [[Ernest Bevin]] as [[Foreign Secretary]]; [[Hugh Dalton]] was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (it had widely been expected to be the other way around). [[Stafford Cripps]] became [[President of the Board of Trade]], while [[Herbert Morrison]] was given the post of [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] and given overall control of Labour's nationalisation programme. [[Aneurin Bevan]] became [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]], whilst [[Ellen Wilkinson]], the only woman to serve in Attlee's government, became [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Minister of Education]].

===Domestic policy===
====Health and Welfare reforms====

In [[domestic policy]], the party had clear aims. Attlee's first Health Secretary, [[Aneurin Bevan]], fought against the general disapproval of the [[British Medical Association|medical establishment]] in creating the British [[National Health Service]]; the [[publicly funded health care|publicly funded]] healthcare system, which offers treatment free at the point of use. Reflecting pent-up demand that had long existed for medical services, the NHS treated some 8.5 million dental patients and dispensed more than 5 million pairs of spectacles during its first year of operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;The Attlee Governments 1945-1951 by Kevin Jefferys&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are often disputes about its organisation and funding, British parties to this day must still voice their general support for the NHS in order to remain electable.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/8/4/52.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A large house-building programme was carried out with the intention of providing millions of people with high-quality homes. Four out of five houses constructed under Labour were to be council properties, built to more generous specifications than before the Second World War, while subsidies kept down council rents. Altogether, these policies provided public-sector housing with its biggest ever boost up until that point, while low-wage earners particularly benefited from these developments. Although the Attlee Government failed to meet its targets owing to economic constraints, over a million new homes were built between 1945 and 1951 (a significant achievement under the circumstances) which ensured that decent, affordable housing was available to many low-income families for the first time ever.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Other changes included the creation of a [[National parks of the United Kingdom|National Parks]] system, the introduction of the [[Town and Country Planning]] system, and the repeal of the [[Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927|Trades Disputes Act 1927]].

The government set about implementing [[William Beveridge]]'s plans for the creation of a 'cradle to grave' [[welfare state]], and set in place an entirely new system of [[social security]]. Among the most important pieces of legislation was the [[National Insurance Act 1946]], in which people in work paid a flat rate of [[national insurance]]. In return, they (and the wives of male contributors) were eligible for flat-rate pensions, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, and funeral benefit. Various other pieces of legislation provided for [[child benefit]] and support for people with no other source of income.&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt; The Attlee government also significantly increased pensions and other benefits, with pensions raised to the point that they became more of a living income than they had been before. The success of the Attlee Government's welfare legislation in reducing poverty was such that, in the general election of 1950,

“Labour propaganda could make much of the claim that social security had eradicated the most abject destitution of the 1930’s”.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

====Nationalisation====

Attlee's government also carried out their manifesto commitment for [[nationalisation]] of basic industries and public utilities. The [[Bank of England]] and civil aviation were nationalised in 1946. [[National Coal Board|Coal mining]], the [[British Railways|railways]], road haulage, canals and cable and wireless were nationalised in 1947, electricity and gas followed in 1948. The [[Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain|steel industry]] was finally nationalised in 1951. By 1951 about 20% of the British economy had been taken into [[public ownership]].&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt; Although nationalisation failed to provide workers with a greater say in the running of the industries that they worked in (as many on the Left had hoped), it did bring about significant material gains for workers in the form of higher wages and reduced working hours.&lt;ref&gt;The Labour Governments, 1945-51 by Henry Pelling&lt;/ref&gt;

====The economy====

Nevertheless, the most significant problem remained the economy; the [[war effort]] had left Britain nearly bankrupt. The war had cost Britain about a quarter of its national wealth. Overseas investments had been wound up to pay for the war. The transition to a peacetime economy, and the maintaining of strategic military commitments abroad led to continuous and severe problems with the [[balance of trade]]. This meant that strict [[rationing]] of food and other essential goods were continued in the post war period, to force a reduction in consumption in an effort to limit [[imports]], boost [[export]]s and stabilise the Pound Sterling so that Britain could trade its way out of its crisis.

The abrupt ending of the American [[Lend-Lease]] program in August 1945 almost caused a crisis. This was mitigated by the [[Anglo-American loan]] negotiated in December 1945 by [[John Maynard Keynes]], which provided some respite. The conditions attached to the loan included making the [[pound sterling|pound]] fully [[convertibility|convertible]] to the [[American dollar|dollar]]. When this was introduced in July 1947, it led to a [[currency crisis]] and convertibility had to be suspended after just five weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt; Britain benefited from the American [[Marshall Aid]] program from 1948, and the economic situation improved significantly. However another balance of payments crisis in 1949 forced Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Stafford Cripps]] into devaluation of the pound.&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt;

Despite these problems, one of the main achievements of Attlee's government was the maintenance of near [[full employment]]. The government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation of materials and manpower, and [[unemployment]] rarely rose above 500,000, or 3% of the total workforce.&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt; In fact labour ''shortages'' proved to be more of a problem. One area where the government was not quite as successful was in housing, which was also the responsibility of Aneurin Bevan. The government had a target to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built. Neverheless, millions of people were rehoused as a result of the Attlee government's housing policies, and between August 1945 and December 1951, 1,016,349 new homes were completed in England, Scotland, and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Labour in power, 1945-1951 by Kenneth Morgan&lt;/ref&gt;

====1947 crisis====

[[1947]] proved to be a particularly difficult year for the government; an [[Winter of 1946-1947|exceptionally cold winter]] that year caused coal mines to freeze and cease production, creating widespread [[power cuts]] and food shortages. The crisis led to an unsuccessful plot by [[Hugh Dalton]] to replace Attlee as Prime Minister with [[Ernest Bevin]]. Later that year [[Stafford Cripps]] tried to persuade Attlee to stand aside for Bevin. However these plots petered out after Bevin refused to co-operate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt; Later that year, [[Hugh Dalton]] resigned as Chancellor after inadvertently leaking details of the budget to a journalist. He was replaced by Cripps.

====Relations with the press and Royal family====

Attlee's government faced constant hostility from [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] supporting sections of society, including the Conservative supporting press. The [[Sunday Times]] journalist James Margach, wrote of the Attlee years; &quot;I have never known the Press so consistently and irresponsibly political, slanted and prejudiced&quot;. As early as 1946 the [[Attorney-General]] Sir [[Hartley Shawcross]] attacked &quot;the campaign of calumny and misrepresentation which the Tory Party and the Tory stooge press has directed at the Labour government. Freedom of the press does not mean freedom to tell lies&quot;. In 1946 the government set up a [[Royal Commission]] on the press which eventually led to the setting up of the [[Press Complaints Commission|Press Council]] in 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt;

Relations with [[the Royal Family]] were also strained. A letter from [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth]] (later the [[Queen Mother]]), dated 17 May 1947, showed &quot;her decided lack of enthusiasm for the socialist government&quot; and describes the British electorate as &quot;poor people, so many half-educated and bemused&quot; for electing Attlee over Winston Churchill, whom she saw as a war hero. That said, according to Lord Wyatt, this was to be expected as the Queen Mother was &quot;the most right-wing member of the Royal Family.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2178089,00.html  Andrew Pierce, &quot;What Queen Mother really thought of Attlee's socialist 'heaven on earth'.&quot; The Times, 13 May 2006, p. 9])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===

[[File:Potsdam big three.jpg|thumb|300px|Clement Attlee (left) with President [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] at the [[Potsdam Conference]]]]

====Postwar Europe and the Cold War====
In foreign affairs, Attlee's cabinet was concerned with four issues: postwar Europe, the onset of the [[cold war]], the establishment of the [[United Nations]], and decolonisation. The first two were closely related, and Attlee was assisted in these matters by [[Ernest Bevin]]. Attlee attended the later stages of the [[Potsdam Conference]] in the company of [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[Joseph Stalin]].

In the immediate aftermath of the war, the Government faced the challenge of managing relations with Britain's former war-time ally, Stalin and the [[Soviet Union]].  Attlee's Foreign Secretary, the former [[trade union]] leader [[Ernest Bevin]], was passionately [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], based largely on his experience of fighting communist influence in the trades union movement.  Bevin's initial approach to the USSR as Foreign Secretary has been described by historian Kenneth O. Morgan as &quot;wary and suspicious, but not automatically hostile&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, ''Labour in Power''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an early &quot;good-will&quot; gesture that has been criticised more recently, the Attlee government allowed the Soviets access, under the terms of a 1946 UK-USSR [[Trade pact|Trade Agreement]], to several [[Rolls-Royce Nene]] [[jet engine]]s.  The Soviets, who at the time were well behind the West in jet technology, [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] the Nene, and installed their own version in the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] interceptor, used to good effect against US-UK forces in the subsequent Korean War, as well as in several later MiG models.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Yefim, ''Mikoyan-Gurevich MIG-15: The Soviet Union's Long-Lived Korean War Fighter,'' Midland Press (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

After Stalin took political control of most of [[Eastern Europe]] and began to subvert other governments in the Balkans, Attlee's and Bevin's worst fears of Soviet intentions were borne out.   The Attlee government then became instrumental in the creation of the successful [[NATO]] defence alliance to protect [[Western Europe]] against any Soviet aggression.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kenneth O. Morgan, Labour in Power (Oxford, 1984), especially Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In a crucial contribution to the economic stability of post-War Europe, Attlee's cabinet was instrumental in promoting the American [[Marshall Plan]] for the economic recovery of Europe.

A group of [[left wing]] Labour MPs organised under the banner of &quot;[[Keep Left (pamphlet)|Keep Left]]&quot;, urged the government to steer a middle way between the two emerging superpowers, and advocated the creation of 'third force' of European powers to stand between the USA and USSR. However, deteriorating relations between Britain and the USSR, and Britain's economic reliance on America, steered policy towards supporting America.&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt;

Fear of Soviet and American intentions led, in January 1947, to a secret meeting of senior cabinet ministers, where it was decided to press ahead with the development of Britain's independent [[nuclear deterrent]], an issue which later caused a split in the Labour Party, although the first successful test did not occur until 1952, after Attlee had left office.&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt;

In 1950 American president Harry S. Truman said that atomic weapons may be used in the Korean War. Attlee became concerned with the power America possessed and therefore called a meeting of some foreign affairs ministers in order to discuss the issue that had evolved.
[[File:Bevin Attlee H 42138.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Foreign Secretary [[Ernest Bevin]] (left) with Clement Attlee in 1945]]

====Decolonisation====

Attlee's government was responsible for the first significant [[decolonisation]] of part of the [[British Empire]] – [[History of India|India]]. Attlee appointed [[Lord Louis Mountbatten]] Viceroy of India, and agreed to Mountbatten's request for plenipotentiary powers for negotiating Indian independence. In view of implacable demands by the political leadership of both Hindu and Islamic communities in British India for a separate Hindu and a separate Muslim homeland, Mountbatten conceded the notion of two nations consisting of a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority [[Pakistan]] (which at the time incorporated [[East Pakistan]], now [[Bangladesh]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. The drawing of borders was accomplished at the cost of large-scale population movements and heavy communal bloodshed on both sides. The independence of [[Burma]] and [[Ceylon]] was also negotiated around this time. Some of the new countries became [[Dominion|British Dominions]], the genesis of the modern [[Commonwealth of Nations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt;

One of the most urgent problems concerned the future of the [[Palestine Mandate]]. British policies there were perceived by the [[Zionist]] movement and the Truman administration as pro-Arab and anti-Jewish, and in the face of armed revolt of Jewish militant groups and increasing violence of the local Arab population Britain had found itself unable to control events. This was a very unpopular commitment and the evacuation of [[British Army|British troops]] and subsequent handing over of the issue to the [[United Nations|UN]] was widely supported by the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt;

The government's policies with regard to the other colonies, however, particularly those in Africa, were very different. A major [[military base]] was built in [[Kenya]], and the African colonies came under an unprecedented degree of direct control from London, as development schemes were implemented with a view to helping solve Britain's desperate post-war [[balance of payments]] crisis, and raising African [[Standard of living|living standards]]. This 'new colonialism' was, however, generally a failure: in some cases, such as a then-infamous [[Tanganyika groundnut scheme]], spectacularly so.&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt;

===Demise of Attlee's government===

The Labour Party was returned to power in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|general election of 1950]] with a much reduced parliamentary majority under the [[first-past-the-post]] [[voting system]], despite an increase in the popular vote. It was at this time that a degree of Conservative opposition recovered at the expense of the declining [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Although Attlee's second government was less radical than the first, it oversaw the passage of a number of reforms, relating to issues such as industry in development areas, the restoration of land which had been devastated by ironstone pollution, and river pollution&lt;ref&gt;The 1945-1951 Labour Governments by Roger Eatwell&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1951, the Attlee government was looking increasingly exhausted, with several of its most important ministers having died or ailing.  The party split in 1951 over the austerity budget brought in by [[Hugh Gaitskell]] to pay for the cost of Britain's participation in the [[Korean War]]: [[Aneurin Bevan]], architect of the National Health Service (NHS), resigned to protest against the new charges for &quot;teeth and spectacles&quot; introduced by the budget, and was joined in this action by the later prime minister, [[Harold Wilson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt;

Labour lost the [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|general election of 1951]] to Churchill's renewed Conservatives, despite polling more votes than in the 1945 election and more votes nationwide than the Conservative party, and, indeed, the most votes Labour had ever won.

His short list of [[1951 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|Resignation Honours]] announced in November 1951 included an Earldom for [[William Jowitt]], Lord Chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 30 November 1951; p. 6; Issue 52172; col G: &quot;The Resignation Honours: Earldom For Lord Jowitt&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to opposition and retirement==

Following the defeat in 1951, Attlee continued to lead the party in opposition. His last four years as leader are widely seen as one of the Labour Party's weaker periods.&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;&gt;Thorpe, Andrew. (2001) ''A History Of The British Labour Party'', Palgrave, ISBN 0-333-92908-X&lt;/ref&gt; The party became split between its right wing led by [[Hugh Gaitskell]] and its left led by [[Aneurin Bevan]]. One of his main reasons for staying on as leader was to frustrate the leadership ambitions of [[Herbert Morrison]],&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt; whom Attlee disliked for political and personal reasons. (Ernest Bevin had died shortly before Labour lost office.) Attlee had reportedly at one time favoured Aneurin Bevan to succeed him as leader,&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt; but this became problematic after the latter split the party.

Attlee, now aged 72, contested the [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|1955 general election]] against [[Anthony Eden]], which saw the Conservative majority increase. He retired as leader of the party on 14 December 1955, having led Labour for over twenty years, and was succeeded by [[Hugh Gaitskell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Attlee&quot;/&gt;

He retired from the Commons and was elevated to the peerage to take his seat in the [[House of Lords]] as [[Earl Attlee]] and Viscount Prestwood on 16 December 1955. In 1958 he was, along with Bertrand Russell, one of a group of notables to establish the [[Homosexual Law Reform Society]], which campaigned for the decriminalisation of homosexual acts in private by consenting adults, a reform which was voted through parliament nine years later.

He attended Churchill's funeral in January 1965 – elderly and frail by then, he had to remain seated in the freezing cold as the coffin was carried, having tired himself out by standing at the rehearsal the previous day.

He lived to see Labour return to power under [[Harold Wilson]] in 1964, but also to see his old constituency of [[Walthamstow West (UK Parliament constituency)|Walthamstow West]] fall to the Conservatives in a by-election in September 1967. Clement Attlee died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 84 at [[Westminster Hospital]] on 8 October 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clem Attlee A Biography By Francis Beckett&quot;/&gt;

On his death, the title passed to his son [[Martin Richard Attlee, 2nd Earl Attlee]] (1927–91). It is now held by Clement Attlee's grandson [[John Richard Attlee, 3rd Earl Attlee]]. The third earl (a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]) retained his seat in the Lords as one of the [[hereditary peer]]s to remain under an amendment to Labour's 1999 [[House of Lords Act]].

When Attlee died, his estate was sworn for probate purposes at a value of £7,295, a relatively modest sum for so prominent a figure.

His ashes are buried in the nave of [[Westminster Abbey]], close to those of [[Sidney James Webb, 1st Baron Passfield|Lord Passfield]] and [[Ernest Bevin]].

==Legacy==

&quot;A modest man, but then he has so much to be modest about&quot;, is a quote about Attlee that is very commonly ascribed to Churchill (although Churchill in fact denied saying it, and respected Attlee's service in the War Cabinet).&lt;ref&gt;Walter L. Arnstein, ''Britain Yesterday and Today: 1830 to the Present'', Chapter 19, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; Attlee's modesty and quiet manner hid a great deal that has only come to light with historical reappraisal. In terms of the [[machinery of government]], he was one of the most businesslike and effective of all the [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|British prime ministers]]. Indeed he is widely praised by his successors, both Labour and Conservative.

His leadership style of consensual government, acting as a chairman rather than a president, won him much praise from historians and politicians alike. [[Christopher Soames]], Britain's Ambassador to France during the government of [[Edward Heath]] - and later a cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher - remarked that &quot;Mrs. Thatcher was not really running a team. Every time you have a Prime Minister who wants to make all the decisions, it mainly leads to bad results. Attlee didn't. That's why he was so damn good.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hennessy, ''The Prime Minister: The Office and its Holders since 1945'', Chapter 7, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Even Thatcher herself wrote in her 1995 memoirs, which charted her beginnings in [[Grantham]] to her victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 General Election]], that she admired Attlee: &quot;Of Clement Attlee, however, I was an admirer. He was a serious man and a patriot. Quite contrary to the general tendency of politicians in the 1990s, he was all substance and no show&quot;.

Attlee's administration presided over the successful transition from a [[war economy|wartime economy]] to peacetime, tackling problems of demobilisation, shortages of [[Currency|foreign currency]], and adverse deficits in trade balances and [[Government spending|government expenditure]]. Further domestic policies that he brought about included the establishment of the [[National Health Service]] and post-war [[Welfare State]], which became key to the reconstruction of post-war Britain.

[[File:Clement Attlee statue - Limehouse library.jpg|thumb|Statue of Attlee outside Limehouse Library]]
In foreign affairs, he did much to assist with the post-war economic recovery of Europe, though this did not lead to a realisation that this was where Britain's future might lie. He proved a loyal ally of America at the onset of the cold war. Because of his style of leadership it was not he but Ernest Bevin who masterminded foreign policy.

It was Attlee's government that decided Britain should have an independent atomic weapons programme, and work began on it in 1947. Bevin, Attlee's Foreign Secretary, famously stated that &quot;We've got to have it and it's got to have a bloody [[Union Flag|Union Jack]] on it.&quot; However, the first operational [[Operation Hurricane|British A Bomb]] was not detonated until October 1952, about one year after Attlee had left office.

Though a socialist, Attlee still believed in the British Empire of his youth, an institution that, on the whole, he thought was a power for good in the world. Nevertheless, he saw that a large part of it needed to be self-governing. Using the Dominions of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand as a model, he began the transformation of the Empire into the Commonwealth.

His greatest achievement, surpassing many of these, was, perhaps, the establishment of a political and economic consensus about the governance of Britain that all parties, whether [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] or [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] subscribed to for three decades, fixing the arena of political discourse until the later 1970s.

Although possessed of a genial personality, Clement Attlee was notably taciturn in his relations with the Press, sometimes offering only monosyllabic answers to reporters' questions. He was seldom referred to by his forenames; usually he was referred to as &quot;C. R. Attlee&quot; or &quot;Mr. Attlee.&quot;

==Religious views==

Although one of his brothers became a clergyman and one of his sisters a [[missionary]], Attlee himself is usually regarded as an [[agnostic]].  In an interview he described himself as &quot;incapable of religious feeling&quot;, saying that he believed in &quot;the ethics of Christianity&quot; but not &quot;the mumbo-jumbo&quot;.  When asked whether he was an agnostic, Attlee replied &quot;I don't know&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Appearance in popular culture==
===Literature===

* Attlee composed this limerick about himself to demonstrate how he was often underestimated:-
: Few thought he was even a starter.
: There were many who thought themselves smarter.
: But he finished PM,
: CH and OM,
: An earl and a Knight of the Garter.
::''Source: Jones, B., Barry Jones' Dictionary of World Biography, 1998''

* An alternative version also exists, which may reflect Attlee's use of English more closely:-
: There were few who thought him a starter,
: Many who thought themselves smarter.
: But he ended PM,
: CH and OM,
: an Earl and a Knight of the Garter.
::''Source: Kenneth Harris, &quot;Attlee&quot; (Weidenfeld and Nicholson, London, 1982)''

===Music===

* [[Lord Beginner]]'s song &quot;General Election&quot; was inspired by Attlee's victory in the 1950 British general election.

===Sport===

* In 1981, Attlee again entered British [[popular culture]] as one of the [[List of English people|famous English people]] taunted by name in [[Bjørge Lillelien|Bjørge Lillelien's]] legendary commentary immediately after [[Norway national football team|Norway]] defeated [[England national football team|England]] in a [[1982 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]] [[1982 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifier]].

===Drama===

* Played by [[Patrick Troughton]] in ''[[Edward &amp; Mrs. Simpson]].

:''Not to be confused with various Romans named &quot;Catulus&quot;, see [[Lutatius]].''
'''Gaius Valerius Catullus''' (ca. 84 BC &amp;ndash; ca. 54 BC) was a [[Latin literature|Latin poet]] of the [[Roman Republic|Republican period]]. His surviving works are still read widely, and continue to influence poetry and other forms of art.

==Biography==
Catullus came from a leading [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] family of [[Verona, Italy|Verona]] in [[Cisalpine Gaul]], and according to [[St. Jerome]], he was born in the town. The family was prominent enough for his father to entertain [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], then [[Promagistrate|proconsul]] of both [[Gaul|Gallic]] [[Roman province|provinces]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/gaius-valerius-catullus/ Gaius Valerius Catullus] from ''Encyclopedia of World Biography'' accessed February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his poems Catullus describes his happy return to the family villa at [[Sirmio]] on [[Lake Garda]] near Verona. The poet also owned a villa near the fashionable resort of Tibur (modern [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]]);&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; his complaints about his poverty must be taken with a grain of salt.

The poet appears to have spent most of his young adult years in [[Rome]]. His friends there included the poets [[Licinius Macer Calvus|Licinius Calvus]], and [[Helvius Cinna]], [[Quintus Hortensius]] (son of the orator and rival of [[Cicero]]) and the biographer [[Cornelius Nepos]], to whom Catullus dedicated the extant ''libellus'' which is the basis of his fame.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He appears to have been acquainted with the poet [[Marcus Furius Bibaculus]]. A number of prominent contemporaries appear in his poetry, including Cicero, Caesar and [[Pompey]]. According to an anecdote preserved by [[Suetonius]], Caesar did not deny that Catullus's lampoons left an indelible stain on his reputation, but when Catullus apologized, he invited the poet for dinner the very same day.&lt;ref&gt;Hope, Ken, &quot;[http://www.negenborn.net/catullus/about_cat.htm?l=l Introduction on Catullus]&quot; at ''Catullus Translations'', accessed February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

It was probably in Rome that Catullus fell deeply in love with the &quot;[[Lesbia]]&quot; of his poems, who is usually identified with [[Clodia|Clodia Metelli]], a sophisticated woman from the aristocratic house of patrician Claudii Pulchri and sister of the infamous [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]]. In his poems Catullus describes several stages of their relationship: initial euphoria, doubts, separation, and his wrenching feelings of loss. Many questions must remain unanswered - most importantly, it is not clear why the couple split up - but Catullus's poems about the relationship display striking depth and psychological insight. One such poem with insight to the reasons of his parting with &quot;[[Lesbia]]&quot; is poem 11, which is addressed to his companions Furius and Aurelius and requests them simply to pass a farewell insult to Lesbia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:abo:phi,0472,001:11 A Parting Insult To Lesbia]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:REmpire-29 Bithynia.png|thumb|Bithynia]]
He spent the provincial command year summer 57 to summer 56 BC in [[Bithynia]] on the staff of the commander [[Gaius Memmius (Poet)|C. Memmius]]. While in the East, he traveled to the [[Troad]] to perform rites at his brother's tomb, an event recorded in a moving poem.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

There survives no ancient biography of Catullus:  his life has to be pieced together from scattered references to him in other ancient authors and from his poems. Thus it is uncertain when he was born and when he died. St. Jerome says that he died in his 30th year, and was born in 87 BC. But the poems include references to events of 55 and 54 BC. Since the Roman consular fasti make it somewhat easy to confuse 87 – 57 BC with 84 – 54 BC, many scholars accept the dates 84 BC – 54 BC,&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; supposing that his latest poems and the publication of his ''libellus'' coincided with the year of his death, a most unlikely proposition.{{Why?|date=August 2010}}

Catullus's poems were widely appreciated by other poets, but Cicero despised them for their supposed amorality.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Catullus was never considered one of the canonical school authors, although his body of work is on the reading lists for Ph.D. programs in the classics. Nevertheless, he greatly influenced poets such as [[Ovid]], [[Horace]], and [[Virgil]]. After his rediscovery in the late [[Middle Ages]], Catullus again found admirers. His explicit writing style has shocked many readers, both ancient{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and modern.

==Poetry==
{{Main|Poetry of Catullus}}
{{wikibooks|The Poetry of Gaius Valerius Catullus}}

===Sources and organization===
Catullus's poems have been preserved in an [[anthology]] of 116 ''carmina'' (the actual number of poems may slightly vary in various editions), which can be divided into three formal parts: sixty short poems in varying metres, called ''[[polymetra]]'', eight longer poems, and forty-eight [[epigram]]s.  

There is no scholarly consensus on whether or not Catullus himself arranged the order of the poems. The longer poems differ from the ''polymetra'' and the epigrams not only in length but also in their subjects: There are seven [[hymn]]s and one mini-[[epic poetry|epic]], or epyllion, the most highly-prized form for the &quot;new poets&quot;.

The ''polymetra'' and the epigrams can be divided into four major [[Theme (literature)|thematic]] groups (ignoring a rather large number of poems eluding such categorization):

* poems to and about his friends (e.g., an invitation like poem 13).
* [[erotic]] poems: some of them indicate [[homosexuality|homosexual]] penchants ([[Catullus 50|50]] and [[Catullus 99|99]]), but most are about women, especially about one he calls &quot;[[Lesbia]]&quot; (in honour of the poetess [[Sappho]] of [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], source and inspiration of many of his poems).
* [[invective]]s: often rude and sometimes downright [[obscene]] poems targeted at friends-turned-traitors (e.g., poem [[Catullus 30|30]]), other lovers of [[Lesbia]],  well known poets, [[politician]]s (e.g., [[Julius Caesar]]) and [[rhetor]]s, including [[Cicero]].
* [[condolence]]s: some poems of Catullus are solemn in nature. [[Catullus 96|96]] comforts a friend in the death of a loved one; several others, most famously [[Catullus 101|101]], lament the death of his brother.

All these poems describe the lifestyle of Catullus and his friends, who, despite Catullus's temporary political post in Bithynia, lived their lives withdrawn from [[politics]]. They were interested mainly in [[poetry]] and [[love]]. Above all other qualities, Catullus seems to have sought ''venustas'', or charm, in his acquaintances, a theme which he explores in a number of his poems.  The ancient Roman concept of ''virtus'' (i.e. of [[virtue]] that had to be proved by a political or military career), which [[Cicero]] suggested as the solution to the societal problems of the late [[Roman Republic|Republic]], meant little to them.

But it is not the traditional notions Catullus rejects, merely their monopolized application to the ''[[vita activa]]'' of politics and [[war]]. Indeed, he tries to reinvent these notions from a personal point of view and to introduce them into human relationships. For example, he applies the word ''fides'', which traditionally meant faithfulness towards one's political allies, to his relationship with Lesbia and reinterprets it as unconditional faithfulness in love. So, despite seeming frivolity of his lifestyle, Catullus measured himself and his friends by quite ambitious standards.

===Intellectual influences===
Catullus's [[poetry]] was influenced by the innovative poetry of the [[Hellenistic Age]], and especially by [[Callimachus]] and the Alexandrian school, which had propagated a new style of poetry that deliberately turned away from the classical [[epic poetry]] in the tradition of [[Homer]]. Cicero called these local innovators  ''[[neoteroi]]'' (νεώτεροι) or 'moderns' (in Latin ''poetae novi'' or 'new poets'), in that they cast off the heroic model handed down from [[Ennius]] in order to strike new ground and ring a contemporary note.  Catullus and [[Callimachus]] did not describe the feats of ancient [[hero]]es and [[god]]s (except perhaps in re-evaluating and predominantly artistic circumstances, e.g. poems 63 and 64), focusing instead on small-scale personal themes. Although these poems sometimes seem quite superficial and their subjects often are mere everyday concerns, they are accomplished works of art. Catullus described his work as ''expolitum'', or polished, to show that the language he used was very carefully and artistically composed. 

Catullus was also an admirer of [[Sappho]], a female poet of the 7th century BC, and is the source for much of what we know or infer about her. [[Catullus 51]] follows [[Sappho 31]] so closely that some believe the later poem to be, in part, a direct translation of the earlier poem, and [[Catullus 61|61]] and [[Catullus 62|62]] are certainly inspired by and perhaps translated directly from lost works of Sappho.  Both of the latter are ''[[Epithalamium|epithalamia]]'', a form of [[laudatory]] or erotic wedding-poetry that Sappho had been famous for but that had gone out of fashion in the intervening centuries. Catullus sometimes used a meter that Sappho developed, called the Sapphic [[strophe]]. In fact, Catullus may have brought about a substantial revival of that form in Rome.

===Style===
Catullus wrote in many different meters including [[hendecasyllabic verse|hendecasyllabic]] and [[elegiac couplet]]s (common in love poetry). All of his poetry shows strong and occasionally wild emotions especially in regard to [[Lesbia]]. He also demonstrates a great sense of humour such as in [[Catullus 13]]. 

Many of the literary techniques he used are still common today, including [[hyperbaton]]: “plenus saculus est aranearum” (Catullus 13), which translates as “[my] purse is all full – of cobwebs.” He also uses [[litotes]] e.g. “Salve, nec minimo puella naso nec bello pede nec…” ([[Catullus 43]]) (“hello, girl with a not so small nose and a not so pretty foot and...”) as well as [[tricolon]] and [[alliteration]]. He is also very fond of diminutives such as in [[Catullus 50]]: “Hestero, Licini, die otiose/multum lusimus in meis tabellis” – “Yesterday, Licinius, was a day of leisure/ playing many games in my little notebooks”.

==Cultural references==
* The [[epistolary novel]] ''[[Ides of March (novel)|Ides of March]]'' by [[Thornton Wilder]] centers on [[Julius Caesar]], but prominently features Catullus, his poetry, his relationship (and correspondence) with [[Clodia]], correspondence from his family and a description of his death. Catullus's poems and the closing section by [[Suetonius]] are the only documents in the [[novel]] which are not imagined.
* ''[[Catulli Carmina]]'' is a cantata by Carl Orff to the texts of Catullus.
* The new musical ''TULLY (In No Particular Order)'', which appeared in the 2007 [[New York Musical Theatre Festival]], loosely adapts the poems of Catullus while retaining the non-linear structure of the published edition, exploring his relationships with both Clodia and Juventius, renamed Julie, and the timeless nature of memory and love.
* The 20th-century [[Irish people|Irish]] [[poet]] [[Louis MacNeice]] references Catullus in his [[poem]] &quot;[[Epitaph]] for Liberal Poets,&quot; where he mentions Catullus as amongst the first [[Liberalism|liberal]] poets - &quot;Catullus/ went down young,&quot; mentioning him in the context of the death of the individual and recognising his and the universal plight.
* [[Archibald MacLeish]] wrote a poem entitled &quot;You Also, Gaius Valerius Catullus,&quot; where he addresses the poet.
* Catullus is discussed in [[John Fowles]]'s novel ''The French Lieutenant's Woman'' (1969) as being one of the foremost poets of [[love]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[libido|desire]].
* The 16th-century Spanish poet [[Cristóbal de Castillejo]] plagiarized Catullus in his well-known work &quot;Dame amor, besos sin cuento&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.20minutos.es/poesia/post/2009/04/19/-dame-amor-besos-sin-cuento-cristaibal-castillejo Side-by-side comparison]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Yeats]] references Catullus in his poem [[The Scholars (poem)|The Scholars]].
* [[Ned Rorem]] has a song entitled, &quot;Catullus: On the burial of his brother.&quot;
* The poem &quot;Be Angry at the Sun&quot; by [[Robinson Jeffers]] includes the line &quot;You are not Catullus, you know, To lampoon these crude sketches of Caesar.&quot;
* The 2011 radio play ''[[A Thousand Kisses (radio play)|A Thousand Kisses]]'' was based on his life.
* Catullus features in [[Steven Saylor]]'s historical mystery ''The Venus Throw'' (1995).

'''Cecil Scott &quot;C.S.&quot; Forester''' was the pen name of '''Cecil Louis Troughton Smith''' (27 August 1899 — 2 April 1966), an English novelist who rose to fame with tales of naval warfare. His most notable works were the 11-book [[Horatio Hornblower]] series, depicting a Royal Navy officer during the [[Napoleon|Napoleonic era]], and ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' (1935; filmed in 1951 by [[John Huston]]). His novels ''[[A Ship of the Line]]'' and ''[[Flying Colours]]'' were jointly awarded the 1938 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction.

==Early years==
Forester was born in [[Cairo]] and educated at [[Alleyn's School]], [[Dulwich College]], and [[Guy's Hospital]], but did not complete his studies at the latter.

==Marriage==
He married Kathleen Belcher in 1926, had two sons, and divorced in 1945. His eldest son, [[John Forester (cyclist)|John]], is a noted [[cycling]] activist and wrote a biography of his father.

==WWII==
During World War II, Forester moved to the United States where he wrote propaganda to encourage that country to join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. He eventually settled in [[Berkeley, California]]. While living in Washington, D.C., he met a young British intelligence officer named [[Roald Dahl]], of whose experiences in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] he had heard word, and encouraged him to write about them. In 1947, he secretly married a woman named Dorothy Foster.

==Career==
Forester wrote many other novels, among them ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' (1935) and ''[[The General (novel)|The General]]'' (1936); [[Peninsular War]] novels in ''[[Death to the French]]'' (published in the United States as ''Rifleman Dodd'') and ''[[The Gun (novel)|The Gun]]'' (filmed as ''[[The Pride and the Passion]]'' in 1957); and seafaring stories that did not involve Hornblower, such as ''[[Brown on Resolution]]'' (1929); ''[[The Captain from Connecticut]]'' (1941); ''[[The Ship (novel)|The Ship]]'' (1943) and ''[[The Last Nine Days of the Bismarck|Hunting the Bismarck]]'' (1959), which was used as the basis of the screenplay for the 1960 film ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]]'' Several of his works were filmed, most notably the 1951 film ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'', directed by [[John Huston]]. Forester is also credited as story writer for several movies not based on his published fiction, including ''Commandos Strike at Dawn'' (1942). 

He wrote several volumes of short stories set during the Second World War. Those in ''The Nightmare'' (1954) were based on events in Nazi Germany, ending at the [[Nuremberg Trials]].  Stories in ''The Man in the Yellow Raft'' (1969) followed the career of the destroyer USS ''Boon'', while many of those in ''Gold from Crete'' (1971) followed the destroyer HMS ''Apache''. The last of the stories in the latter book - &quot;If Hitler had invaded England&quot; - offers an imagined sequence of events starting with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s attempt to implement [[Operation Sea Lion]], and culminating in the early military defeat of [[Nazi Germany]] in the summer of 1941. His non-fiction seafaring works include ''The Age of Fighting Sail'' (1956), an account of the sea battles between Great Britain and the United States in the [[War of 1812]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In addition to his novels of seafaring life, Forester also published two crime novels, ''[[Payment Deferred]]'' (1926), and ''[[Plain Murder]]'' (1930), and two children's books. One, ''Poo-Poo and the Dragons'' (1942), was created as a series of stories told to his younger son to encourage him to finish his meals. George had mild food allergies that kept him feeling unwell, and he needed encouragement to eat.&lt;ref&gt;''Poo-Poo and the Dragons'': Preface&lt;/ref&gt; The second, ''The [[Barbary Pirates]]'' (1953), is a children's history of those early 19th-century pirates.

British author [[Roald Dahl]]'s writing career began after he met Forester in early 1942. According to Dahl's autobiographical ''Lucky Break'', Forester asked Dahl about his experiences as a fighter pilot. This prompted Dahl to write his first story, &quot;A Piece of Cake&quot;. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a '''list of country calling codes''' defined by [[ITU-T]] recommendations [[E.123]] and [[E.164]], also called IDD ([[International Direct Dialling]]) or ISD ([[International Subscriber Dialling]]) codes.

The [[telephone numbering plan]] for a telephone system includes an [[international dialing prefix]], such as &quot;00&quot; or &quot;011&quot;, which is added before the country calling code and is specific to the country from which the caller is dialling. Generally, as in the list below, the need for this prefix is specified with a &quot;+&quot;.
[[File:CallingCodesWorld-Labeled.svg|thumb|500px|International calling codes]]

==At a glance==
Country calling codes form a [[prefix code]]; hence, they can be organized as a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]]. In each row of the table below, the country codes given in the leftmost column share the same first digit; then subsequent columns give the second digit in ascending order.

===Zones 3/4 &amp;ndash; [[Europe]]===
Originally larger countries, such as the United Kingdom or France, were assigned two-digit codes (to compensate for their usually longer domestic numbers) and small countries, such as Iceland, were assigned three-digit codes; however, since the 1980s, all new assignments have been three-digit regardless of countries’ populations.

From August 2007, Kazakhstan changed all area codes to start with 7; however, 6 is also reserved for Kazakhstan. Digits 3, 4, and 5 are reserved for Russia. Abkhazia was assigned +7&amp;nbsp;840 for landline and +7&amp;nbsp;940 for mobile operators on 28 September 2009. Abkhazia will also continue using +995&amp;nbsp;44. Other digits are reserved for Russia. Currently, there are no internationally accessible numbers starting with 0, 1, 2 or 5 – these are access codes and similar arrangements.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CCITT, the predecessor of the [[ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector]] (ITU-T), developed the first formal list of telephone country codes. This list was included in the ''1964 CCITT Blue Book'', among other international telecommunication recommendations, which would eventually become [[ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector|ITU-T]] recommendation [[E.164]].

An earlier system of country codes for European use was mentioned in the ''1960 CCITT Red Book''. Some of these country codes were retained in the CCITT country code assignments and remain in effect (for example, France +33, United Kingdom +44).

For further details on country code history and development, see [http://www.wtng.info/wtng-hst.html ''History of Country Codes''] ([http://www.wtng.info WTNG]).

'''Christopher Marlowe'''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Christopher Marlowe was baptised as 'Marlow,' but he spelled his name 'Marley' in his one known surviving signature.&quot; David Kathman. [http://shakespeareauthorship.com/name1.html#3 &quot;The Spelling and Pronunciation of Shakespeare's Name: Pronunciation.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Baptism|baptised]] 26 February 1564; died 30 May 1593) was an English [[dramatist]], poet and [[Translation|translator]] of the [[Elizabethan era]]. As the foremost [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan]] [[tragedy|tragedian]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Logan, ''Shakespeare's Marlowe'' (2007) p.4. &quot;During Marlowe's lifetime, the popularity of his plays, Robert Greene's...remarks...including the designation &quot;famous,&quot; and the many imitations of ''Tamburlaine'' suggest that he was for a brief time considered England's foremost dramatist.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; next to [[William Shakespeare]], he is known for his [[blank verse]], his overreaching [[protagonist]]s, and his mysterious death.

A warrant was issued for Marlowe's arrest on 18 May 1593. No reason for it was given, though it was thought to be connected to allegations of blasphemy—a manuscript believed to have been written by Marlowe was said to contain &quot;vile heretical conceipts&quot;. On 20 May he was brought to the court to attend upon the [[Privy Council]] for questioning. There is no record of their having met that day, however, and he was commanded to attend upon them each day thereafter until &quot;licensed to the contrary.&quot; Ten days later, he was stabbed to death by [[Ingram Frizer]]. Whether the stabbing was connected to his arrest has never been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholl, Charles (2006). &quot;By my onely meanes sett downe: The Texts of Marlow's Atheism&quot;, in Kozuka, Takashi and Mulryne, J.R. ''Shakespeare, Marlowe, Jonson: new directions in biography''. Ashgate Publishing, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Marlowe was born to a shoemaker in [[Canterbury]] named John Marlowe and his wife Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;This is commemorated by the name of the town's main theatre, the [[Marlowe Theatre]], and by the town museums. However, St. George's was gutted by fire in the [[Baedeker raids]] and was demolished in the post-war period - only the tower is left, at the south end of Canterbury's High Street http://www.digiserve.com/peter/cant-sgm1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His date of birth is not known, but he was baptised on 26 February 1564, and is likely to have been born a few days before. Thus he was just two months older than his contemporary [[Shakespeare]], who was baptised on 26 April 1564 in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].

Marlowe attended [[The King's School, Canterbury]] (where a house is now named after him) and [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] on a scholarship and received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1584.&lt;ref&gt;{{Venn|id=MRLW580C|name=Marlowe, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1587 the university hesitated to award him his master's degree because of a rumour that he had converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] and intended to go to the English college at [[Rheims]] to prepare for the priesthood. However, his degree was awarded on schedule when the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] intervened on his behalf, commending him for his &quot;faithful dealing&quot; and &quot;good service&quot; to [[Elizabeth I of England|the Queen]].&lt;ref&gt;For a full transcript, see [http://www.prst17z1.demon.co.uk/pc_cert.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page]&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of Marlowe's service was not specified by the Council, but its letter to the Cambridge authorities has provoked much speculation, notably the theory that Marlowe was operating as a secret agent working for Sir [[Francis Walsingham]]'s intelligence service.&lt;ref&gt;He died in a deadly brawl.{{cite book  | last = Hutchinson | first = Robert  | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = Elizabeth's Spy Master: Francis Walsingham and the secret war that saved England| publisher = Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson | year = 2006  | location = London| page = 111  | isbn =0 297 84613 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No direct evidence supports this theory, although the Council's letter is evidence that Marlowe had served the government in some secret capacity.

==Literary career==
[[Image:Canterbury - Turm der St. George's Church, in der Marlowe getauft wurde.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Marlowe was christened at St. George's Church, in [[Canterbury]].]]

Of the dramas attributed to Marlowe ''[[Dido, Queen of Carthage]]'' is believed to have been his first, and performed by the [[Children of the Chapel]], a company of boy actors, between 1587 and 1593.  The play was first published in 1594; the title page attributes the play to Marlowe and [[Thomas Nashe]].

Marlowe's first play performed on the regular stage in London, in 1587, was ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine the Great]]'', about the conqueror [[Timur]], who rises from shepherd to warrior. It is among the first English plays in blank verse,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/16century/topic_1/welcome.htm See especially the middle section in which the author shows how another Cambridge graduate, Thomas Preston makes his title character express his love in a popular play written around 1560 and compares that &quot;clumsy&quot; lines with ''Doctor Faustus'' addressing Helen of Troy.&lt;/ref&gt; and, with [[Thomas Kyd]]'s ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'', generally is considered the beginning of the mature phase of the [[Elizabethan theatre]]. ''Tamburlaine'' was a success, and was followed with ''Tamburlaine the Great, Part II''.

The two parts of ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine]]'' were published in 1590; all Marlowe's other works were published posthumously.  The sequence of the writing of his other four plays is unknown; all deal with controversial themes.

* ''[[The Jew of Malta]]'', about a Maltese Jew's barbarous revenge against the city authorities, has a prologue delivered by a character representing [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]. It was probably written in 1589 or 1590, and was first performed in 1592. It was a success, and remained popular for the next fifty years.  The play was entered in the [[Stationers' Register]] on May 17, 1594, but the earliest surviving printed edition is from 1633.

* ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward the Second]]'' is an English history play about the deposition of King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] by his barons and the Queen, who resent the undue influence the king's favourites have in court and state affairs. The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on July 6, 1593, five weeks after Marlowe's death.  The full title of the earliest extant edition, of 1594, is &quot;The Troublesome Reign and Lamentable Death of Edward the Second, King of England, with the Tragical Fall of Proud Mortimer.&quot; The play was first acted in 1592 or 1593.

* ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'' is a short and luridly written work, the only surviving text of which was probably a [[Memorial reconstruction|reconstruction from memory]] of the original performance text,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deats|first=Sarah Munson|editor=Cheney, Patrick|title=The Cambridge Companion to Christopher Marlowe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=2004|page=193|chapter='Dido Queen of Carthage' and 'The Massacre at Paris'|isbn=0-521-82034-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  portraying the events of the [[Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] in 1572, which English Protestants invoked as the blackest example of Catholic treachery. It features the silent &quot;English Agent&quot;, whom subsequent tradition has identified with Marlowe himself and his connections to the secret service.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Richard (2004). &quot;Tragedy, Patronage and Power&quot;. in Cheney, Patrick, 2007, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Massacre at Paris'' is considered his most dangerous play, as agitators in London seized on its theme to advocate the murders of refugees from the [[Spanish Netherlands|low countries]] and, indeed, it warns [[Elizabeth I]] of this possibility in its last scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicholl|first=Charles|title=The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London |year=1992|page=41|chapter=Libels and Heresies|isbn=0224031007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoenselaars|first=A. J.|title=Images of Englishmen and Foreigners in the Drama of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|location=Madison, New Jersey|year=1992|pages=78–79|chapter=Englishmen abroad 1558—1603|isbn=0838634311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]'', based on the German [[Faustbuch]], was the first dramatised version of the [[Faust]] legend of a scholar's dealing with the devil. While versions of &quot;The Devil's Pact&quot; can be traced back to the 4th century, Marlowe deviates significantly by having his hero unable to &quot;burn his books&quot; or repent to a merciful God in order to have his contract annulled at the end of the play. Marlowe's protagonist is instead torn apart by demons and dragged off screaming to hell. Dr Faustus is a textual problem for scholars as it was highly edited (and possibly censored) and rewritten after Marlowe's death. Two versions of the play exist: the 1604 [[quarto]], also known as the A text, and the 1616 quarto or B text. Many scholars believe that the A text is more representative of Marlowe's original because it contains irregular character names and idiosyncratic spelling: the hallmarks of a text that used the author's handwritten manuscript, or &quot;[[foul papers]]&quot;, as a major source.

Marlowe's plays were enormously successful, thanks in part, no doubt, to the imposing stage presence of [[Edward Alleyn]]. Alleyn was unusually tall for the time, and the haughty roles of Tamburlaine, Faustus, and Barabas were probably written especially for him. Marlowe's plays were the foundation of the repertoire of Alleyn's company, the [[Admiral's Men]], throughout the 1590s.

Marlowe also wrote the poem ''[[Hero and Leander (Marlowe's poem)|Hero and Leander]]'' (published with a continuation by [[George Chapman]] in 1598), the popular lyric ''[[The Passionate Shepherd to His Love]]'', and translations of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' and the first book of [[Lucan (poet)|Lucan]]'s ''[[Pharsalia]]''. In 1599, his translation of [[Ovid]] was banned and copies publicly burned as part of [[John Whitgift|Archbishop Whitgift]]'s crackdown on offensive material.

==The legend==
As with other writers of the period, little is known about Marlowe. What little evidence there is can be found in legal records and other official documents. This has not stopped writers of both fiction and non-fiction from speculating about his activities and character. Marlowe has often been described as a spy, a brawler, a heretic and a homosexual, as well as a &quot;magician&quot;, &quot;duellist&quot;, &quot;tobacco-user&quot;, &quot;counterfeiter&quot; and &quot;[[Rake (character)|rakehell]]&quot;. J. A. Downie and Constance Kuriyama have argued against the more lurid speculation,&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Downie in his and J. T. Parnell's ''Constructing Christopher Marlowe'' (2000) and Constance Kuriyama in her ''Christopher Marlowe: A Renaissance Life'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; but [[J.B. Steane]]&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Steane was a Scholar of Jesus College, Cambridge, where he read English. He is the author of ''Marlowe: A Critical Study'' and he edited and wrote an introduction to the Penguin English Library edition of ''Christopher Marlowe: The Complete Plays''.&lt;/ref&gt; remarked, &quot;it seems absurd to dismiss all of these Elizabethan rumours and accusations as 'the Marlowe myth'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;steane&quot; /&gt;

===Spying===
[[File:Edward2a.jpg|thumb|200px|Title page of the earliest published text of ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'' (1594)]]
Marlowe is often alleged to have been a government spy (Park Honan's 2005 biography even had &quot;Spy&quot; in its title &lt;ref&gt;Park Honan, ''Christopher Marlowe: Poet and Spy'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;) The author [[Charles Nicholl (author)|Charles Nicholl]] speculates this was the case and suggests that Marlowe's recruitment took place when he was at Cambridge. As noted above, in 1587 the [[Privy Council]] ordered Cambridge University to award Marlowe his MA, denying rumours that he intended to go to the English Catholic college in Rheims, saying instead that he had been engaged in unspecified &quot;affaires&quot; on &quot;matters touching the benefit of his country&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;This is from a document dated 29 June 1587, from the National Archives – ''Acts of Privy Council''.&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving college records from the period also indicate that Marlowe had had a series of unusually lengthy absences from the university – much longer than permitted by university regulations – that began in the academic year 1584-1585. Surviving college [[Buttery (shop)|buttery]] (dining room) accounts indicate he began spending lavishly on food and drink during the periods he was in attendance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicholl|first=Charles|title=The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London |year=1992|chapter=12|isbn=0224031007}}&lt;/ref&gt; – more than he could have afforded on his known scholarship income.

It has sometimes been theorised that Marlowe was the &quot;Morley&quot; who was tutor to [[Arbella Stuart]] in 1589.&lt;ref&gt;He was described by Arbella's guardian, the Countess of Shrewsbury, as having hoped for an annuity of some £40 from Arbella, his being &quot;so much damnified (i.e. having lost this much) by leaving the University.&quot;: BL Lansdowne MS 71,f.3.and Charles Nicholl, ''The Reckoning'' (1992), pp. 340-2.&lt;/ref&gt; This possibility was first raised in a ''TLS'' letter by E. St John Brooks in 1937; in a letter to ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', John Baker has added that only Marlowe could be Arbella's tutor due to the absence of any other known &quot;Morley&quot; from the period with an MA and not otherwise occupied.&lt;ref&gt;John Baker, letter to ''Notes and Queries'' 44.3 (1997), pp. 367-8&lt;/ref&gt;  If Marlowe was Arbella's tutor, (and some biographers think that the &quot;Morley&quot; in question may have been a brother of the musician [[Thomas Morley]]&lt;ref&gt;Constance Kuriyama, ''Christopher Marlowe: A Renaissance Life'' (2002), p. 89. Also in Handover's biography of Arbella, and Nicholl, ''The Reckoning'', p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;) it might indicate that he was a spy, since Arbella, niece of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and cousin of [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]], later James I of England, was at the time a strong candidate for the succession to Elizabeth's throne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/Elizabeth/index.html  Elizabeth I and James VI and I], [http://www.history.ac.uk/  History in Focus].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1592 Marlowe was arrested in the town of [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]] in the Netherlands for his alleged involvement in the [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiting]] of coins, presumably related to the activities of seditious Catholics. He was sent to be dealt with by the Lord Treasurer ([[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Burghley]]) but no charge or imprisonment resulted.&lt;ref&gt;For a full transcript, see [http://www.prst17z1.demon.co.uk/flushing.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page]&lt;/ref&gt; This arrest may have disrupted another of Marlowe's spying missions: perhaps by giving the resulting coinage to the Catholic cause he was to infiltrate the followers of the active Catholic plotter [[William Stanley (Elizabethan)|William Stanley]] and report back to Burghley.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholl (1992: 246-248)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest and death===
[[Image:marlowe.jpg|thumb|right|Marlowe was buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard of St Nicholas, Deptford.

In early May 1593 several bills were posted about London threatening Protestant refugees from France and the Netherlands who had settled in the city. One of these, the &quot;Dutch church libel,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prst17z1.demon.co.uk/libell.htm A Libell, fixte vpon the French Church Wall, in London]&lt;/ref&gt; written in [[blank verse]], contained allusions to several of Marlowe's plays and was signed, &quot;[[Tamburlaine]]&quot;. On 11 May the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] ordered the arrest of those responsible for the libels. The next day, Marlowe's colleague [[Thomas Kyd]] was arrested. Kyd's lodgings were searched and a fragment of a [[heresy|heretical]] tract was found. Kyd asserted that it had belonged to Marlowe, with whom he had been writing &quot;in one chamber&quot; some two years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;For a full transcript, see [http://www.prst17z1.demon.co.uk/kyd2.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page]&lt;/ref&gt; At that time they had both been working for an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] patron, probably [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby|Ferdinando Stanley]], Lord Strange.&lt;ref&gt;Mulryne, J. H. &quot;Thomas Kyd.&quot; ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; A warrant for Marlowe's arrest was issued on 18 May, when the Privy Council apparently knew that he might be found staying with [[Thomas Walsingham (literary patron)|Thomas Walsingham]], whose father was a first cousin of the late Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], Elizabeth's [[Secretary of State (England)|principal secretary]] in the 1580s and a man more deeply involved in state espionage than any other member of the Privy Council.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, Alan. ''The Elizabethan Secret Service''. London: Sutton, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Marlowe duly presented himself on 20 May but, there apparently being no Privy Council meeting on that day, was instructed to &quot;give his daily attendance on their Lordships, until he shall be licensed to the contrary&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives, ''Acts of the Privy Council''. Meetings of the Privy Council, including details of those attending, are recorded and minuted for 16, 23, 25, 29 and the morning of 31 May, all of them taking place in the Star Chamber at Westminster. There is no record of any meeting on either 18 or 20 May, however, just a note of the warrant being issued on 18 May and the fact that Marlowe &quot;entered his appearance for his indemnity therein&quot; on the 20th.&lt;/ref&gt; On Wednesday 30 May  Marlowe was killed.

Various accounts of Marlowe's death were current over the next few years. [[Francis Meres]] says Marlowe was &quot;stabbed to death by a bawdy serving-man, a rival of his in his lewd love&quot; as punishment for his &quot;epicurism and atheism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Palladis Tamia''. London, 1598: 286v-287r.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Sir [[Sidney Lee]] wrote that Marlowe was killed in a drunken fight, and this is still often stated as fact today.

The official account came to light only in 1925 when the scholar [[Leslie Hotson]] discovered the [[coroner]]'s report of the inquest on Marlowe's death, held two days later on Friday 1 June 1593.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prst17z1.demon.co.uk/inquis~2.htm The Coroner's Inquisition (Translation)]&lt;/ref&gt; Marlowe had spent all day in a house in [[Deptford, London|Deptford]], owned by the widow [[Eleanor Bull]], and together with three men: [[Ingram Frizer]], Nicholas Skeres and Robert Poley. All three had been employed by one or other of the Walsinghams. Skeres and Poley had helped snare the conspirators in the [[Babington plot]] and Frizer would later describe Thomas Walsingham as his &quot;master&quot; at that time&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Hotson, ''The Death of Christopher Marlowe'' (1925) p.65&lt;/ref&gt; although his role was probably more that of a financial or business agent as he was for Walsingham's wife Audrey a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;Park Honan, ''Christopher Marlowe: Poet and Spy'' (2005) p.325&lt;/ref&gt; These witnesses testified that Frizer and Marlowe had argued over the bill (now famously known as the 'Reckoning') exchanging &quot;divers malicious words&quot; while Frizer was sitting at a table between the other two and Marlowe was lying behind him on a couch. Marlowe snatched Frizer's dagger and wounded him on the head. In the ensuing struggle, according to the coroner's report, Marlowe was stabbed above the right eye, killing him instantly. The jury concluded that Frizer acted in self-defence, and within a month he was pardoned. Marlowe was buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard of [http://www.deptfordchurch.org St. Nicholas, Deptford] immediately after the inquest, on 1 June 1593.

Marlowe's death is alleged by some to be an assassination for the following reasons:
# The three men who were in the room with him when he died were all connected both to the state secret service and to the London underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Seaton, Ethel. &quot;Marlowe, Robert Poley, and the Tippings.&quot; ''Review of English Studies'' 5 (1929): 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Frizer and Skeres also had a long record as loan sharks and con-men, as shown by court records.  Bull's house also had &quot;links to the government's spy network&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Greenblatt|Greenblatt, Stephen]] ''Will in the World''. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 2004: 268.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Their story that they were on a day's pleasure outing to [[Deptford]] is alleged to be implausible. In fact, they spent the whole day together. Also, [[Robert Poley]] was carrying urgent and confidential despatches to the Queen, who was at her residence [[Nonsuch Palace]] in [[Surrey]], but instead of delivering them, he spent the day with Marlowe and the other two, and didn't in fact hand them in until well over a week later, on 8 June.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholl (1992: 32)&lt;/ref&gt;
# It seems too much of a coincidence that Marlowe's death occurred only a few days after his arrest, apparently for [[Christian heresy|heresy]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
# The manner of Marlowe's arrest is alleged to suggest causes more tangled than a simple charge of heresy would generally indicate. He was released in spite of ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence, and even though other accusations about him received within a few days, as described below, implicitly connected [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] and the [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] with the heresy. Thus, some contend it to be probable that the investigation was meant primarily as a warning to the politicians in the &quot;[[School of Night]]&quot;, or that it was connected with a power struggle within the Privy Council itself.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Austin. &quot;Some Observations on Christopher Marlowe, Government Agent.&quot; ''PMLA'' 43 (1928): 692-4.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The various incidents that hint at a relationship with the Privy Council (see above), and by the fact that his patron was Thomas Walsingham, Sir [[Francis Walsingham|Francis]]{{'s}} second cousin once removed, who had been actively involved in intelligence work.

For these reasons and others, Charles Nicholl (in his book ''The Reckoning'' on Marlowe's death) argues there was more to Marlowe's death than emerged at the inquest. There are [[Marlovian theory|different theories]] of some degree of probability. Since there are only written documents on which to base any conclusions, and since it is probable that the most crucial information about his death was never committed to writing at all, it is unlikely that the full circumstances of Marlowe's death will ever be known.

===Atheism===
[[File:Handwriting-Marlowe-Massacre-1.JPG|right|thumb| A [[Foul papers|foul sheet]] from Marlowe's writing of ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'' (1593). Reproduced from Folger Shakespeare Library Ms.J.b.8]]
Marlowe was reputed to be an [[atheist]] which, at that time, held the dangerous implication of being an enemy of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern historians, however, consider that his professed atheism, as with his supposed Catholicism, may have been no more than an elaborate and sustained pretence adopted to further his work as a government spy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Riggs|first=David|title=The Cambridge Companion to Christopher Marlowe|editor=Cheney, Patrick|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=2004|page=38|isbn=0521527341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary evidence comes from Marlowe's accuser in [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]], an informer called [[Richard Baines]].

Following Marlowe's arrest in 1593, Baines submitted to the authorities a &quot;note containing the opinion of one Christopher Marly concerning his damnable judgment of religion, and scorn of God's word.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prst17z1.demon.co.uk/baines1.htm The 'Baines Note' (1)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Baines attributes to Marlowe a total of eighteen items which &quot;scoff at the pretensions of the [[Old testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;steane&quot;&gt;{{cite book

He also implies that Marlowe had Catholic sympathies. Other passages are merely sceptical in tone: &quot;he persuades men to atheism, willing them not to be afraid of bugbears and hobgoblins&quot;. The final paragraph of Baines' document reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These thinges, with many other shall by good &amp; honest witnes be aproved to be his opinions and Comon Speeches, and that this Marlow doth not only hould them himself, but almost into every Company he Cometh he perswades men to Atheism willing them not to be afeard of bugbeares and hobgoblins, and vtterly scorning both god and his ministers as I Richard Baines will Justify &amp; approue both by mine oth and the testimony of many honest men, and almost al men with whome he hath Conversed any time will testify the same, and as I think all men in Cristianity ought to indevor that the mouth of so dangerous a member may be stopped, he saith likewise that he hath quoted a number of Contrarieties oute of the Scripture which he hath giuen to some great men who in Convenient time shalbe named.

Similar examples of Marlowe's statements were given by [[Thomas Kyd]] after his imprisonment and possible torture (see above);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prst17z1.demon.co.uk/kyd1.htm Kyd's Accusations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prst17z1.demon.co.uk/kyd2.htm Kyd's letter to Sir John Puckering]&lt;/ref&gt; both Kyd and Baines connect Marlowe with the [[mathematician]] [[Thomas Harriot]] and [[Walter Raleigh]]'s circle. Another document&lt;ref&gt;The so-called 'Remembrances' against Richard Cholmeley. For a full transcript, see [http://www.prst17z1.demon.co.uk/chumley1.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page]&lt;/ref&gt; claimed at around the same time that &quot;one Marlowe is able to show more sound reasons for Atheism than any divine in England is able to give to prove divinity, and that ... he hath read the Atheist lecture to Sir Walter Raleigh and others.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;steane&quot; /&gt;
[[File:WPA poster Christopher Marlowe Faustus.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Poster for [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] performance of Marlowe's ''Faustus'', New York, circa 1935]]
Some critics believe that Marlowe sought to disseminate these views in his work and that he identified with his rebellious and iconoclastic protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;Waith, Eugene. ''The Herculean Hero in Marlowe, Chapman, Shakespeare, and Dryden''. London: Chatto and Windus, 1962. The idea is commonplace, though by no means universally accepted.&lt;/ref&gt; However, plays had to be approved by the [[Master of the Revels]] before they could be performed, and the [[censorship]] of publications was under the control of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Presumably these authorities did not consider any of Marlowe's works to be unacceptable (apart from the ''Amores'').

===Sexuality===
Like his contemporary [[Sexuality of William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]], Marlowe is sometimes described today as homosexual. The question of whether an Elizabethan was gay or homosexual in a modern sense is anachronistic; for the Elizabethans, what is often today termed homosexual or bisexual was more likely to be recognised as a sexual act, rather than an exclusive sexual orientation and identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Bruce R.|title=Homosexual desire in Shakespeare's England|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=March 1995|page=74|isbn=0-226-76366-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue that the evidence is inconclusive and that the reports of Marlowe's homosexuality may simply be exaggerated rumours produced after his death. Richard Baines reported Marlowe as saying: &quot;All they that love not Tobacco and Boys are fools&quot;. [[David Bevington]] and Eric Rasmussen describe Baines's evidence as &quot;unreliable testimony&quot; and make the comment: &quot;These and other testimonials need to be discounted for their exaggeration and for their having been produced under legal circumstances we would regard as a witch-hunt&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Doctor Faustus and Other Plays'', pp. viii - ix&lt;/ref&gt; One critic, [[J.B. Steane]], remarked that he considers there to be &quot;no ''evidence'' for Marlowe's homosexuality at all.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;steane&quot; /&gt; Other scholars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Paul Whitfield, ed.|title=Marlowe, History and Sexuality: New Critical Essays on Christopher Marlowe|publisher=AMS Press|location=New York|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, point to homosexual themes in Marlowe's writing: in ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]'', Marlowe writes of the male youth Leander, &quot;in his looks were all that men desire&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Hero and Leander'', 88 (see [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21262/21262-h/21262-h.htm Project Gutenberg]).&lt;/ref&gt; and that when the youth swims to visit Hero at [[Sestos]], the sea god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] becomes sexually excited, &quot;imagining that Ganymede, displeas'd ... the lusty god embrac'd him, call'd him love ... and steal a kiss ... upon his breast, his thighs, and every limb ... [a]nd talk of love&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Hero and Leander'', 157-192.&lt;/ref&gt; while the boy, naive and unaware of Greek love practices, said that, &quot;You are deceiv'd, I am no woman, I ... Thereat smil'd Neptune.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Hero and Leander'', 192-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation among contemporary writers==
Whatever the particular focus of modern critics, biographers and novelists, for his contemporaries in the literary world, Marlowe was above all an admired and influential artist. Within weeks of his death, [[George Peele]] remembered him as &quot;Marley, the Muses' darling&quot;; [[Michael Drayton]] noted that he &quot;Had in him those brave translunary things / That the first poets had&quot;, and [[Ben Jonson]] wrote of &quot;Marlowe's mighty line&quot;. [[Thomas Nashe]] wrote warmly of his friend, &quot;poor deceased Kit Marlowe&quot;. So too did the publisher Edward Blount, in the dedication of ''Hero and Leander'' to Sir Thomas Walsingham.

Among the few contemporary dramatists to say anything negative about Marlowe was the anonymous author of the Cambridge University play ''[[Parnassus plays|The Return From Parnassus]]'' (1598) who wrote, ''&quot;Pity it is that wit so ill should dwell, / Wit lent from heaven, but vices sent from hell.&quot;''

The most famous tribute to Marlowe was paid by [[Shakespeare]] in ''[[As You Like It]]'', where he not only quotes a line from ''[[Hero and Leander]]'' (''Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might, &quot;Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?&quot;'') but also gives to the clown [[Touchstone (As You Like It)|Touchstone]] the words ''&quot;When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room.&quot;'' This appears to be a reference to Marlowe's murder which involved a fight over the ''&quot;reckoning&quot;'', the bill, as well as to a line in Marlowe's ''Jew of Malta'' - ''&quot;Infinite riches in a little room&quot;''.

Shakespeare was heavily influenced by Marlowe in his work, as can be seen in the re-using of Marlovian themes in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', and ''[[Macbeth]]'' (''Dido'', ''Jew of Malta'', ''Edward II'' and ''Dr Faustus'' respectively). In ''[[Hamlet]]'', after meeting with the travelling actors, Hamlet requests the Player perform a speech about the Trojan War, which at 2.2.429-32 has an echo of Marlowe's ''[[Dido, Queen of Carthage]]''. In ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' Shakespeare brings on a character &quot;Marcade&quot; (three syllables) in   conscious acknowledgement of Marlowe's character &quot;Mercury&quot;, also attending the King of Navarre, in ''Massacre at Paris''. The significance, to those of Shakespeare's audience who had read ''Hero and Leander'', was Marlowe's identification of himself with the god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jean-Christophe Mayer2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Wilson (scholar)|editor=Mayer, Jean-Christophe |title=Representing France and the French in early modern English drama|year=2008|publisher=University of Delaware Press|location=Newark, DE|isbn=0-87413-000-X|pages=95–97|chapter=Worthies away: the scene begins to cloud in Shakespeare's Navarre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As Shakespeare==
{{Main|Marlovian theory|Shakespeare authorship question}}
Given the murky inconsistencies concerning the account of Marlowe's death, a [[Marlovian theory|theory]] has arisen centered on the notion that Marlowe may have faked his death and then continued to write under the assumed name of William Shakespeare. However, academic consensus rejects alternative candidates for authorship, including Marlowe.&lt;ref&gt;Kathman, David (2003), &quot;The Question of Authorship&quot;, in Wells, Stanley; Orlin, Lena C., Shakespeare: an Oxford Guide, Oxford University Press, pp. 620–32, ISBN 978-0-19-924522-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
The dates of composition are approximate.

===Plays===
*''[[Dido, Queen of Carthage]]'' (''c''.1586) (possibly co-written with [[Thomas Nashe]])
*''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine]], part 1'' (''c''.1587)
*''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine]], part 2'' (''c''.1587-1588)
*''[[The Jew of Malta]]'' (''c''.1589)
*''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus|Doctor Faustus]]'' (''c''.1589, or, ''c''.1593)
*''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'' (''c''.1592)
*''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'' (''c''.1593)

The play ''[[Lust's Dominion]]'' was attributed to Marlowe upon its initial publication in 1657, though scholars and critics have almost unanimously rejected the attribution.

===Poetry===
* Translation of Book One of [[Lucan (poet)|Lucan]]'s ''[[Pharsalia]]'' (date unknown)
* Translation of [[Ovid]]'s ''Elegies'' (''c''. 1580s?)
* ''[[The Passionate Shepherd to His Love]]'' (pre-1593; because it is constantly referred to in his own plays we can presume an early date of mid-1580s)
* ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]'' (''c''. 1593, unfinished; completed by [[George Chapman]], 1598)

==Fictional works about Marlowe==
* [[Philip Lindsay]]'s ''One Dagger for Two'', fictionalised account of Marlowe's life . 1932 (Novel)
* Leo Rost's ''[[Marlowe (musical)|Marlowe]]'', stage musical based on Rost's book. 1981
* [[Louise Welsh]]'s ''[[Tamburlaine Must Die]]'', about the last two weeks of Marlowe's life. 2004 (Novel)
* [[Anthony Burgess]]'  ''[[A Dead Man in Deptford]]'' fictionalised account of Marlow's death. 1993 (Novel)
* [[Peter Whelan]]'s ''[[The School of Night]]''  about Marlowe's playwriting career after his faked death at Deptford. (Play)

[[Image:Caving2.jpg|thumb|325px|Caving in a muddy section of [[Black Chasm Cave]] in [[California]].|alt=A man caving in muddy passage with helictite formations on the walls and ceiling]]

'''Caving'''—also occasionally known as '''spelunking''' in the United States and '''potholing''' in the United Kingdom—is the recreational [[pastime]] of exploring wild (generally non-[[Show cave|commercial]]) [[cave]] systems. In contrast, [[speleology]] is the scientific study of caves and the cave environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAVE1&quot;&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/TheBush/BushAndMountainRecreation/Caving/3/en Caving in New Zealand] (from [[Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenges involved in the activity depend on the cave being visited, but often include the negotiation of [[Pitch (vertical space)|pitches]], squeezes, and [[water]] (although actual [[cave diving]] is a separate sub-specialty undertaken only by very few cavers). [[Climbing]] or [[gait (human)#Crawls|crawling]] is often necessary, and [[rope]]s are used extensively for safe negotiation of particularly steep or slippery passages.

Caves have been explored out of necessity (for shelter from the elements or from enemies), out of curiosity or for mystical reasons for thousands of years. However, only in the last century or two has the activity developed into a sophisticated, athletic pastime. In recent decades, caving has changed considerably due to the availability of modern protective wear and equipment. It has recently come to be known as an &quot;[[extreme sport]]&quot; by some (though not commonly considered as such by its practitioners, who may dislike the term for its perceived connotation of disregard for safety).

Many of the skills involved in caving can also be put to use in [[mine exploration]] and [[urban exploration]].

== Motivation ==
Caving is often undertaken for the enjoyment of the [[outdoor activity]] or for physical exercise, as well as original exploration, similar to [[mountaineering]] or [[diving]]. Physical or biological science is also an important goal for some cavers. Virgin cave systems comprise some of the last unexplored regions on [[Earth]] and much effort is put into trying to locate and enter them. In well-explored regions (such as most developed nations), the most accessible caves have already been explored, and gaining access to new caves often requires [[Cave digging|digging]] or [[cave diving|diving]].

== Naming issues ==
[[File:Caveman-ic.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Caving in the north of [[England]], an area that is also popular for [[pit cave|pothole exploring]]]]
[[Clay Perry]], an American caver of the 1940s, wrote about a group of men and boys who explored and studied caves throughout [[New England]]. This group referred to themselves as ''spelunkers''. This is regarded as the first use of the word in the [[Americas]]. Throughout the 1950s, ''spelunking'' was the general term used for exploring caves in [[American English|US English]]. It was used freely, without any positive or negative connotations, although only rarely outside the US.

In the 1960s, the terms &quot;spelunking&quot; and &quot;spelunker&quot; began to be considered [[wiktionary:déclassé|déclassé]] among experienced enthusiasts. They began to convey the idea of inexperienced cavers, using unreliable light sources and cotton clothing. In 1985, Steve Knutson (editor of the [[National Speleological Society|NSS]] publication ''American Caving Accidents'') made the following distinction:

{{quote|&quot;...Note that I use the term 'spelunker' to denote someone untrained and unknowledgeable in current exploration techniques, and 'caver' for those who are.&quot;}}

This sentiment is exemplified by [[bumper sticker]]s and t-shirts displayed by many cavers: &quot;Cavers rescue spelunkers&quot;.

''Potholing'' refers to the act of exploring ''[[pit cave|potholes]]'', a word originating in the north of [[England]] for predominantly [[vertical caving|vertical caves]]. The term is often used as a synonym for caving.

== History ==
Caving was pioneered by [[Édouard-Alfred Martel]] (1859–1938) who first achieved the descent and exploration of the [[Gouffre de Padirac]], France as early as 1889 and the first complete descent of a 110 metre wet vertical shaft at [[Gaping Gill]], in [[Yorkshire]], England in 1895. He developed his own techniques based on ropes and metallic ladders. Martel visited [[Kentucky]] and notably [[Mammoth Cave National Park]] in October 1912. Famous US caver [[Floyd Collins]] made in the 1920s important explorations in that area. In the 1930s, as caving became increasingly popular, small exploration teams both in the [[Alps]] and in the karstic high plateaus of southwest France ([[Causses]] and [[Pyrenees]]) transformed cave exploration in both a scientific and recreational activity. [[Robert de Joly]],  [[Guy de Lavaur]]  and [[Norbert Casteret]] were prominent figures of that time. They surveyed  mostly caves in Southwest France.  During WWII, an alpine team  composed of [[Pierre Chevalier]], [[Fernand Petzl]], Charles Petit-Didier and others explored the [[Dent de Crolles]] cave system near [[Grenoble]], France which became the deepest explored cave in the world (-658m) at that time. The lack of available equipment during the war forced [[Pierre Chevalier]] and the rest of the team to develop their own equipment, leading to technical innovation. The scaling-pole (1940), nylon ropes (1942), use of explosives in caves (1947) and mechanical rope-ascenders (Henri Brenot's &quot;monkeys&quot;, first used by Chevalier and Brenot in a cave in 1934) can be directly associated to the exploration of the Dent de Crolles cave system.

In 1941, American cavers organized themselves into the [[National Speleological Society]] (NSS) to advance the exploration, conservation, study, and understanding of caves in the United States. American caver [[Bill Cuddington]], known as &quot;Vertical Bill&quot;, developed the [[single rope technique]] (SRT) in the late 1950s. In 1958, two Swiss alpinists, Juesi and Marti teamed together, creating the first rope ascender known as the [[Jumar]]. In 1968 Bruno Dressler asked Petzl, who worked as a metals machinist, to build a rope-ascending tool, today known as the [[Petzl Croll]], that he had developed by adapting the [[Jumar]] to the specificity of Pit caving. Pursuing these developments, [[Fernand Petzl]] started in the 1970s a small caving equipment manufacturing company [[Petzl]], which is today a world leader in equipment for both caving, mountaineering and at-height safety in civil engineering.  The development of the [[rappel rack]] and the evolution of mechanical ascension systems, notably helped extend the practice and safety of pit exploration to a larger venue of established cavers.

== Practice and equipment ==
[[Image:caving1.jpg|thumb|275px|Caver in an Alabama cave showing common caving wear: coveralls and helmet-mounted lights.]]

[[Hard hat]]s are worn to protect the head from bumps and falling rocks. The caver's primary light source is usually mounted on the helmet in order to keep the hands free. Electric lights are most common, with [[halogen lamp]]s being standard and white [[LED]]s as the new competing technology. Many cavers carry two or more sources of light - one as primary and the others as backup in case the first fails.  More often than not, a second light will be mounted to the helmet for quick transition if the primary fails. [[Carbide lamp]]s systems are an older form of illumination, inspired by miner's equipment, and are still used by some cavers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/TheBush/BushAndMountainRecreation/Caving/4/en Caving equipment and culture] (from [[Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The type of [[clothes]] worn underground varies according to the environment of the cave being explored, and the local culture. In cold caves, the caver may wear a warm base layer that retains its insulating properties when wet, such as a [[Wool|fleece]] (&quot;furry&quot;) suit and/or polypropylene underwear, and an oversuit of hard-wearing (e.g., [[cordura]]) and/or waterproof (e.g., [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]) material. Lighter clothing may be worn in warm caves, particularly if the cave is dry, and in tropical caves thin polypropylene clothing is used, to provide some abrasion protection whilst remaining as cool as possible. [[Wetsuit]]s may be worn if the cave is particularly wet or involves stream passages.  On the feet [[boot]]s are worn - hiking-style boots in drier caves, or rubber boots (such as [[wellies]]) often with [[neoprene]] socks (&quot;wetsocks&quot;) in wetter caves. [[Knee]]-pads (and sometimes [[Elbow-joint|elbow]]-pads) are popular for protecting joints during crawls. Depending on the nature of the cave, gloves are sometimes worn to protect the hands against abrasion and/or cold.  In pristine areas and for restoration, clean oversuits and powder-free, non-latex [[Medical gloves|surgical gloves]] are used to protect the cave itself from contaminants.

Ropes are used for descending or ascending pitches (&quot;[[Single Rope Technique]]&quot;) or for protection. [[Knot]]s commonly used in caving are the [[figure-of-eight loop|figure-of-eight]]- (or [[figure-of-nine loop|figure-of-nine]]-) loop, [[bowline]], [[alpine butterfly knot|alpine butterfly]], and [[Italian hitch]]. Ropes are usually rigged using [[bolt (climbing)|bolts]], [[sling]]s, and [[carabiner]]s. In some cases cavers may choose to bring and use a flexible metal [[ladder]].

In addition to the equipment already described, cavers frequently carry packs containing [[First aid|first-aid]] kits, emergency equipment, and food. Containers for securely transporting [[urine]] are also commonly carried.  On longer trips, containers for securely transporting [[feces]] out of the cave are carried.

During very long trips, it may be necessary to camp in the cave. This necessitates the caver carrying sleeping and cooking equipment.

== Safety ==
[[Image:Caving3.jpg|thumb|225px|right|A caver begins rope descent of a vertical shaft using an abseil rack.]]
{{Main|Cave rescue}}
Caves can be dangerous places; hypothermia, [[falling]], [[flooding]], and physical [[exhaustion]] are the main risks. Rescuing people from underground is difficult and time-consuming, and requires special skills, training, and equipment. Full-scale cave rescues often involve the efforts of dozens of rescue workers (often other long-time cavers who have participated in specialised courses, as normal rescue staff are not sufficiently experienced in cave environments), who may themselves be put in jeopardy in effecting the rescue. This said, caving is not necessarily a high-risk sport (especially if it does not involve difficult climbs or diving). As in all physical sports, knowing one's limitations is key.

The risks are minimised by a number of techniques:

* Checking that there is no danger of flooding during the expedition. Rainwater funneled underground can flood a cave very quickly, trapping people in cut-off passages and [[drowning]] them. After falling, this is the most likely fatal accident in caving.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}
* Using teams of several, preferably at least of four cavers. If an injury occurs, one caver stays with the injured person while the other two go out for help, providing assistance to each other on their way out.
* Notifying people outside the cave as to the intended return time. After an appropriate delay without a return, these will then organise a search party (usually made up by other cavers trained in [[cave rescue]]s, as even professional emergency personnel are unlikely to have the skills to effect a rescue in difficult conditions).
* Use of helmet-mounted lights (hands-free) with extra batteries. American cavers recommend a minimum of three independent sources of light per person, but two lights is common practice amongst European cavers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}
* Sturdy clothing and footwear, as well as a [[helmet]], are necessary to reduce the impact of abrasions, falls, and falling objects. Synthetic fibers and woolens, which dry quickly, shed water, and are warm when wet, are vastly preferred to cotton materials, which retain water and increase the risk of hypothermia. It is also helpful to have several layers of clothing, which can be shed (and stored in the pack) or added as needed. In watery cave passages, [[polypropylene]] thermal underwear or [[wetsuit]]s may be required to avoid [[hypothermia]].
* Cave passages look different from different directions. In long or complex caves, even experienced cavers can become lost. To reduce the risk of becoming lost, it is necessary to memorise the appearance of key navigational points in the cave as they are passed by the exploring party. Each member of a cave party shares responsibility for being able to remember the route out of the cave. In some caves it may be acceptable to mark a small number of key junctions with small stacks or &quot;cairns&quot; of rocks, or to leave a non-permanent mark such as high-visibility [[flagging (tape)|flagging tape]] tied to a projection.
* [[Vertical Caving|Vertical caving]] using ladders or SRT ([[Single Rope Technique]]) to avoid the need for climbing passages that are too  difficult. SRT however is a complex skill and requires proper training before use underground and needs well-maintained equipment. Some drops that are [[abseiling|abseiled]] down may be as deep as several hundred meters (for example [[Harwood Hole]]).

==Cave conservation==
[[Image:Alabama cave 2005-04-24.km.jpg|thumb|250px|A vertical cave in Alabama, US]]
Many cave environments are very fragile.  Many [[speleothem]]s can be damaged by even the slightest touch and some by impacts as slight as a breath.

Pollution is also of concern.  Since water that flows through a cave eventually comes out in streams and rivers, any pollution may ultimately end up in someone's drinking water, and can even seriously affect the surface environment, as well.  Even minor pollution such as dropping [[organic material]] can have a dramatic effect on the cave biota.

Cave-dwelling species are also very fragile, and often, a particular species found in a cave may live within that cave alone, and be found nowhere else in the world, such as [[Alabama cave shrimp]].  Cave-dwelling species are accustomed to a near-constant climate of temperature and humidity, and any disturbance can be disruptive to the species' life cycles. Though cave wildlife may not always be immediately visible, it is typically nonetheless present in most caves.

[[Bat]]s are one such fragile species of cave-dwelling animal. Bats which [[hibernation|hibernate]] are most vulnerable during the winter season, when no food supply exists on the surface to replenish the bat's store of energy should it be awakened from hibernation. Bats which [[Bird migration|migrate]] are most sensitive during the summer months when they are raising their young.  For these reasons, visiting caves inhabited by hibernating bats is discouraged during cold months; and visiting caves inhabited by migratory bats is discouraged during the warmer months when they are most sensitive and vulnerable.  Due to an affliction affecting bats in the northeastern US known as [[white nose syndrome]] (WNS),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fws.gov/northeast/white_nose.html&lt;/ref&gt; the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service has called for a moratorium [http://www.caves.org/WNS/USFWS-WNS_cave_advisory_news_rls_2009-03-26_final-1.pdf] effective March 26, 2009 on caving activity in states known to have hibernacula (MD, NY, VT, NH, MA, CT, NJ, PA, VA, and WV) affected by WNS, as well as adjoining states.

Some cave passages may be marked with flagging tape or other indicators to show biologically, aesthetically, or archaeologically sensitive areas. Marked paths may show ways around notably fragile areas such as a pristine floor of [[sand]] or [[silt]] which may be thousands of years old, dating from the last time water flowed through the cave. Such deposits may easily be spoiled forever by a single misplaced step. Active formations such as [[flowstone]] can be similarly marred with a muddy footprint or handprint, and ancient human artifacts, such as fiber products, may even crumble to dust under all but the most gentle touch.

== Caving organizations ==
{{main|Caving organizations}}
Cavers in many countries have created organizations for the administration and oversight of caving activities within their nations. The oldest of these is the [[French Federation of Speleology]] (originally Société de spéléologie) founded by [[Édouard-Alfred Martel]] in 1895, which produced the first periodical journal in speleology, ''Spelunca''. The [[National Speleological Society]] of the USA was later founded in 1941 (originally formed as the Speleological Society of [[Washington, D.C.|the District of Columbia]] on May 6, 1939) and the [[Swiss Society of Speleology]] created in 1939 in Geneva, but the first speleological institute in the world was founded in 1920 in [[Cluj-Napoca]], Romania, by [[Emil Racovita]], a Romanian biologist, zoologist, speleologist and explorer of Antarctica. The [[Pakistan Cave Research &amp; Caving Federation]] was founded in Pakistan in 1997.

[[File:Lechuguilla Cave Pearlsian Gulf.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Lechuguilla Cave]], [[New Mexico]]]]
A '''cave''' or '''cavern''' is a natural underground space large enough for a human to enter. Some people{{Who|date=June 2010}} suggest that the term ''cave'' should only apply to natural cavities some part of which is in total darkness; however, in popular usage, the term includes smaller spaces like [[rock shelter]]s, [[sea cave]]s, and [[grotto]]s.

[[Speleology]] is the science of exploration and study of all aspects of caves and the environment which surrounds the caves. Exploring a cave for recreation or science may be called ''caving'', ''potholing'', or, in Canada and the United States, ''spelunking'' (see [[caving]]).

==Types and formation==
The formation and development of caves is known as ''[[speleogenesis]]''. Caves are formed by various geologic processes. These may involve a combination of chemical processes, erosion from water, tectonic forces, microorganisms, pressure, atmospheric influences, and even digging.

Most caves are formed in [[limestone]] by [[Solvation|dissolution]].
[[File:HallOfTheMountainKings.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[Speleothem]]s in Hall of the Mountain King, [[Ogof Craig a Ffynnon]], [[South Wales]].]]

===Solutional cave===
'''Solutional caves''' are the most frequently occurring caves and such caves form in rock that is soluble, such as [[limestone]], but can also form in other rocks, including [[chalk]], [[dolomite]], marble, salt, and [[gypsum]]. Rock is dissolved by natural acid in groundwater that seeps through [[Bed (geology)|bedding-planes]], [[Geological fault|faults]], joints and so on. Over geological epochs cracks expand to become caves or cave systems.

The largest and most abundant solutional caves are located in limestone. Limestone dissolves under the action of rainwater and groundwater charged with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[carbonic acid]]) and naturally occurring [[organic acid]]s. The dissolution process produces a distinctive landform known as ''[[karst]]'', characterized by [[sinkhole]]s, and underground drainage. Limestone caves are often adorned with [[calcium carbonate]] formations produced through slow precipitation. These include [[flowstone]]s, [[stalactite]]s, [[stalagmite]]s, [[helictite]]s, [[soda straw]]s and columns. These secondary mineral deposits in caves are called ''[[speleothem]]s''.

The portions of a solutional cave that are below the [[water table]] or the local level of the groundwater will be flooded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amazingcaves.com/learn_formed.html |title=Learning about caves; how caves are formed |accessdate=September 8, 2009 |author=John Burcham |work=Journey into amazing caves |publisher=Project Underground}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's most spectacularly decorated cave is generally regarded to be [[Lechuguilla Cave]] in [[New Mexico]]. Lechuguilla and nearby [[Carlsbad Cavern]] are now believed to be examples of another type of solutional cave. They were formed by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S ([[hydrogen sulfide]]) gas rising from below, where reservoirs of oil give off sulfurous fumes. This gas mixes with ground water and forms H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ([[sulfuric acid]]). The acid then dissolves the limestone from below, rather than from above, by acidic water percolating from the surface.

===Primary cave===
&lt;!--{{main|Primary cave}}--&gt;
[[File:hawaiian lava tube.jpg|thumb|300px|Exploring a [[lava tube]] in [[Hawaii]].]]
Some caves are formed at the same time as the surrounding rock. These are sometimes called '''primary caves'''.

[[Lava tube]]s are formed through [[volcanic]] activity and are the most common 'primary' caves. The [[lava]] flows downhill and the surface cools and solidifies. The hotter lava continues to flow under that crust, and if most of the liquid lava beneath the crust flows out, a hollow tube remains, thus forming a cavity. Examples of such caves can be found on the [[Canary Islands]], [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]], and many other places. [[Kazumura Cave]] near [[Hilo]] is a remarkably long and deep lava tube; it is {{convert|65.6|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}}.

Lava caves, include but are not limited to lava tubes. Other caves formed through volcanic activity include rift caves, lava mold caves, open vertical volcanic conduits, and inflationary caves.

===Sea cave or littoral cave===
{{Main|Sea cave}}
[[File:Painted cave.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Painted Cave, a large [[sea cave]], [[Santa Cruz Island]], [[California]]]]
Sea caves are found along coasts around the world. A special case is littoral caves, which are formed by wave action in zones of weakness in sea cliffs. Often these weaknesses are faults, but they may also be dykes or bedding-plane contacts. Some wave-cut caves are now above sea level because of later uplift. Elsewhere, in places such as Thailand's [[Phang Nga Bay]], solutional caves have been flooded by the sea and are now subject to littoral erosion. Sea caves are generally around {{convert|5|to|50|m|sp=en}} in length but may exceed {{convert|300|m|sp=en}}. 

===Corrasional cave or erosional cave===
Corrasional or erosional caves are those that form entirely by erosion by flowing streams carrying rocks and other sediments. These can form in any type of rock, including hard rocks such as granite. Generally there must be some zone of weakness to guide the water, such as a fault or joint. A subtype of the erosional cave is the wind or aeolian cave, carved by wind-born sediments. Many caves formed initially by solutional processes often undergo a subsequent phase of erosional or vadose enlargement where active streams or rivers pass through them.

===Glacier cave===
{{Main|Glacier cave}}
[[File:Big Four Glacier Ice cave.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[Glacier cave]] in Big Four Glacier, [[Big Four Mountain]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], ca. 1920.]]
Glacier caves occur in ice and under [[glacier]]s and are formed by melting. They are also influenced by the very slow flow of the ice, which tends to close the caves again. (These are sometimes called ''[[ice caves]]'', though this term is properly reserved for caves that contain year-round ice formations).

===Fracture cave===
Fracture caves are formed when layers of more soluble minerals, such as gypsum, dissolve out from between layers of less soluble rock. These rocks fracture and collapse in blocks of stone.

===Talus cave===
Talus caves are the openings between rocks that have fallen down into a pile, often at the bases of cliffs (called &quot;[[Scree|talus]]&quot;).

===Anchihaline cave===
{{Main|Anchihaline cave}}
Anchihaline caves are caves, usually coastal, containing a mixture of freshwater and saline water (usually sea water). They occur in many parts of the world, and often contain highly specialized and endemic faunas.

==Physical patterns==
*''Branchwork caves'' resemble surface dentritic stream patterns; they are made up of passages that join downstream as tributaries. Branchwork caves are the most common of cave patterns and are formed near [[sinkhole]]s where [[groundwater recharge]] occurs. Each passage or branch is fed by a separate recharge source and converges into other higher order branches downstream.&lt;ref name=Easterbrook&gt;Easterbrook, Don, 1999, ''Surface Processes and Landforms [2nd edition]'', New Jersey, Prentice Hall, pp. 207&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Angular Network caves'' form from intersecting fissures of carbonate rock that have had fractures widened by chemical erosion. These fractures form high, narrow, straight passages that persist in widespread closed loops.&lt;ref name=Easterbrook /&gt;
*''Anastomotic caves'' largely resemble surface braided streams with their passages separating and then meeting further down drainage. They usually form along one bed or structure, and only rarely cross into upper or lower beds.&lt;ref name=Easterbrook /&gt;
*''Spongework caves'' are formed as solution cavities are joined by mixing of chemically diverse water. The cavities form a pattern that is three-dimensional and random, resembling a sponge.&lt;ref name=Easterbrook /&gt;
*''Ramiform caves'' form as irregular large rooms, galleries, and passages. These randomized three-dimensional rooms form from a rising water table that erodes the carbonate rock with hydrogen-sulfide enriched water.&lt;ref name=Easterbrook /&gt;
*''[[Pit cave]]s'' (vertical caves, potholes, or simply &quot;pits&quot;) consist of a vertical shaft rather than a horizontal cave passage. They may or may not be associated with one of the above structural patterns.

==Geographic distribution==
Caves are found throughout the world, but only a portion of them have been explored and documented by cavers. The distribution of documented cave systems is widely skewed toward countries where caving has been popular for many years (such as [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[United States]], and so on.).  As a result, explored caves are found widely in Europe, Asia, North America, and [[Oceania]] but are sparse in South America, Africa, and Antarctica. This is a great generalization, as large expanses of North America and Asia contain no documented caves, whereas areas such as the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]] and parts of [[Brazil]] contain many documented caves. As the world’s expanses of soluble bedrock are researched by cavers, the distribution of documented caves is likely to shift. For example, [[China]], despite containing around half the world's exposed limestone - more than {{convert|1000000|km2|sp=en}} - has relatively few documented caves.

==Records and superlatives==
[[File:Mammoth cave canyon.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Canyon passage in [[Mammoth Cave National Park|Mammoth Cave]], the world's longest cave.]]
*The cave system with the '''greatest total length''' of surveyed passage is [[Mammoth Cave National Park|Mammoth Cave]] ([[Kentucky]], [[United States|USA]]) at {{convert|628|km|sp=en}} in length. This record is unlikely to be surpassed in the near future, as the next most extensive known cave is [[Jewel Cave]] near [[Custer, South Dakota]], at {{convert|242|km|sp=en}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;NSS-GEO2&quot;&gt;[http://www.caverbob.com/wlong.htm World’s Longest Caves List from The National Speleological Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

*The longest surveyed '''underwater cave''' is [[Sistema Sac Actun]] in [[Yucatán]], Mexico at {{convert|215|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;NSS-GEO2&quot; /&gt; The record has been exchanged several times with [[Sistema Ox Bel Ha]], currently at {{convert|182|km|sp=en}}.

*The '''deepest known cave''' (measured from its highest entrance to its lowest point) is [[Voronya Cave]] ([[Abkhazia]]), with a depth of {{convert|2,191|m|sp=en}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caverbob.com/wdeep.htm World's Deepest Caves List from The National Speleological Society]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first cave to be explored to a depth of more than {{convert|2|km|sp=en}}. (The first cave to be descended below {{convert|1|km|sp=fr}} was the famous [[Gouffre Berger]] in [[France]].) The [[Illyuzia-Mezhonnogo-Snezhnaya]] cave in [[Abkhazia]], ({{convert|1,753|m|sp=en|disp=or}}) and the [[Lamprechtsofen Vogelschacht]] Weg Schacht in [[Austria]] ({{convert|1,632|m|sp=en|disp=or}}) are the current second- and third-deepest caves. The deepest cave record has changed several times in recent years.

*The '''deepest vertical shaft''' in a cave is {{convert|603|m|sp=en}} in [[Vrtoglavica Cave]] in [[Slovenia]]. The second deepest is [[Velebit caves|Patkov Gušt]] at {{convert|553|m|sp=en}} in the [[Velebit]] mountain, [[Croatia]].

*The '''largest room''' ever discovered is the [[Sarawak Chamber]], in the [[Gunung Mulu National Park]] ([[Miri]], [[Sarawak]], [[Borneo]], [[Malaysia]]), a sloping, boulder strewn chamber with an area of approximately {{Gconvert|700|by|400|m|ft}} and a height of {{convert|80|m|sp=en}}. The nearby Clearwater Cave System is believed to be the world's largest cave by volume, with a calculated volume of 30,347,540 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Ecology==
[[File:townsends in music hall.jpg|300px|left|thumb|[[Townsend's big-eared bat|Townsend's Big-eared bats]] in a cave]]
Cave-inhabiting animals are often categorized as [[troglobite]]s (cave-limited species), [[troglophile]]s (species that can live their entire lives in caves, but also occur in other environments), [[trogloxene]]s (species that use caves, but cannot complete their life cycle wholly in caves) and accidentals (animals not in one of the previous categories).  Some authors use separate terminology for aquatic forms (for example,, [[stygobite]]s, [[stygophile]]s, and [[stygoxene]]s).

Of these animals, the troglobites are perhaps the most unusual organisms. Troglobitic species often show a number of characteristics, termed troglomorphies, associated with their adaptation to subterranean life. These characteristics may include a loss of pigment (often resulting in a pale or white coloration), a loss of eyes (or at least of optical functionality), an elongation of appendages, and an enhancement of other senses (such as the ability to sense vibrations in water). Aquatic troglobites (or stygobites), such as the endangered [[Alabama cave shrimp]], live in bodies of water found in caves and get nutrients from detritus washed into their caves and from the feces of bats and other cave inhabitants. Other aquatic troglobites include [[cave fish]], the [[Olm]], and cave salamanders such as the [[Texas Blind Salamander]].

[[Cave insects]] such as Oligaphorura (formerly Archaphorura) schoetti are troglophiles, reaching {{convert|1.7|mm|sp=en}} in length. They have extensive distribution and have been studied fairly widely. Most specimens are female but a male specimen was collected from [[St Cuthberts Swallet]] in 1969.

[[Bat]]s, such as the [[Gray bat]] and [[Mexican Free-tailed Bat]], are trogloxenes and are often found in caves; they forage outside of the caves. Some species of [[cave cricket]]s are classified as trogloxenes, because they roost in caves by day and forage above ground at night.

Because of the fragile nature of the cave ecosystem, and the fact that cave regions tend to be isolated from one another, caves harbor a number of endangered species, such as the [[Tooth cave spider]], [[Liphistiidae]] Liphistius trapdoor spider, and the [[Gray bat]].

Caves are visited by many surface-living animals, including humans. These are usually relatively short-lived incursions, due to the lack of light and sustenance.

Cave entrances often have typical florae. For instance, in the eastern temperate United States, cave entrances are most frequently (and often densely) populated by the bulblet fern, ''[[Cystopteris bulbifera]]''.

==Archaeological and cultural importance==
[[File:taino.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[Taino]] [[petroglyph]]s in a cave in Puerto Rico]]
Throughout history, primitive peoples have made use of caves for shelter, burial, or as religious sites. Since items placed in caves are protected from the climate and scavenging animals, this means caves are an archaeological treasure house for learning about these people. [[Cave painting]]s are of particular interest. One example is the [[Niah Caves|Great Cave of Niah]], in Malaysia, which contains evidence of human habitation dating back 40,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''. James Shreeve. &quot;The Greatest Journey&quot;. March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Another, the [[Diepkloof Rock Shelter]] in South Africa contains evidence of human habitation and use of symbols dating back 60,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Texier PJ, Porraz G, Parkington J, Rigaud JP, Poggenpoel C, Miller C, Tribolo C, Cartwright C, Coudenneau A, Klein R, Steele T, Verna C. (2010). &quot;A Howiesons Poort tradition of engraving ostrich eggshell containers dated to 60,000 years ago at Diepkloof Rock Shelter, South Africa&quot;. Proceedings of the National Acadademy of Science U S A. 107: 6180–6185. doi:10.1073/pnas.0913047107 PMID 20194764
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the animal kingdom, caves offer shelter, including uses such as [[maternity den]]s.

In [[Germany]] some experts found signs of [[cannibalism]] in the caves at the [[Hönne]].

Caves are also important for geological research because they can reveal details of past climatic conditions in speleothems and [[sedimentary rock]] layers.

Caves are frequently used today as sites for recreation. Caving, for example, is the popular sport of cave exploration. For the less adventurous, a number of the world's prettier and more accessible caves have been converted into [[show cave]]s, where artificial lighting, floors, and other aids allow the casual visitor to experience the cave with minimal inconvenience. Caves have also been used for [[BASE jumping]] and [[cave diving]]. The book ''[[Caverns of Magic]]'' by [[Hal Gibson Pateshall Colebatch|Hal G. P. Colebatch]] surveys some of the instances of cave stories in literature and mythology.

[[Wine cave|Caves are also used for the preservation or aging of wine]] and cheese. The constant, slightly chilly temperature and high humidity that most caves possess makes them ideal for such uses.

{{Numeral systems}}

'''Chinese numerals''' are characters for writing [[number]]s in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. Today, speakers of Chinese use three [[numeral system]]s:
the ubiquitous system of [[Arabic numerals]], along with two ancient Chinese numeral systems.

The older of the ancient systems is the [[Suzhou numerals]] or ''huama'' system. It has gradually been supplanted by the Arabic system in writing numbers. It is the only surviving variation of the [[rod numerals|rod numeral]] system; this system has been popular only in Chinese markets, such as those in [[Hong Kong]] before the 1990s.

The later ancient numeral system is the [[Number names|written numbers system]]. It is still in use when writing numbers in long form, such as on cheques to hinder forgery. This character system is roughly analogous to spelling out a number in English text. The Chinese character system can be classified as part of the language, but it still counts as a number system. Most people in China now use the Arabic system for convenience.

Individual [[Chinese characters]] in this article link to their dictionary entries.

==Written numbers==
[[File:Muyu-G209-1620km-5469.jpg|thumb|Chinese and Arabic numerals may coexist, as on this kilometer marker: 1620 km on [[China National Highway 209|Hwy G209]] (G二〇九)]]
The Chinese character numeral system consists of the [[Chinese characters]] used by the [[Chinese written language]] to write spoken numerals. Similarly to spelled-out numbers in English (e.g., &quot;one thousand nine hundred forty-five&quot;), it is not an independent system ''per se''. Since it reflects spoken language, it does not use the positional system as is done in [[Arabic numerals]], in the same way that spelling out numbers in English does not.

===Characters used to represent numbers===
==== Standard numbers ====
There are  characters representing the numbers zero through nine, and other characters representing larger numbers such as tens, hundreds, thousands and so on. There are two sets of characters for Chinese numerals: one for everyday writing and one for use in commercial or financial contexts known as '''''dàxiě''''' ({{zh|t=大寫|s=大写}}). The latter arose because the characters used for writing numerals are geometrically simple, so simply using those numerals cannot prevent forgeries in the same way spelling numbers out in English would. A forger could easily change everyday characters [[wikt:三十|三十]] (30) to [[wikt:五千|五千]] (5000) by adding just a few strokes. That would not be possible when writing using the financial characters [[wikt:叁拾|叁拾]] (30) and [[wikt:伍仟|伍仟]] (5000).

'''T''' denotes Traditional, '''S''' denotes Simplified.

See [[#Reading and transcribing numbers|Reading and transcribing numbers]] section below. As with 廿, 卅 must be used with another number to mean 卅幾 (&quot;thirty-something&quot;) in Cantonese.

The usage of the word 卌 is done in the following matter, &quot;sei(四) ah ##&quot;, or &quot;4 ah ##&quot;. Thus 41 would be pronounced &quot;sei ah yat&quot;, i.e. &quot;four ah one&quot;.

|Each numeral is the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the previous.
|}
In modern Chinese, only the second system is used in expressing numbers. Although there is some dispute on the value of 兆 zhào, the usage (representing 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) is still consistent through Chinese communities, as well as [[Japanese numerals|Japan]], [[Korean numerals|Korea]].

One example of ambiguity is 兆 (zhào), which traditionally means 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; but is also used for 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; in information technology in recent years (esp. in mainland China). To avoid problems arising from the ambiguity, the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] government never uses this character in official documents, but uses 万亿 (wànyì) instead. (the [[Republic of China|ROC]] government in [[Taiwan]] uses 兆 (zhào) to mean 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; in official documents.)

====SI prefixes====
The translations for the [[SI prefix]]es in earlier days were different from those used today. The larger (兆, 京, 垓, 秭, 穰), and  smaller Chinese numerals (微, 纖, 沙, 塵, 渺) were defined as translations for the SI prefixes. For instance, 京 jīng was defined as ''giga'', and 纖 xiān was defined as ''nano''. This resulted in the creation of more values for each numeral.

By the time of &quot;early translation&quot;, a dispute had arisen over the value of 兆 . The government of the PRC used ''a part'' of this translation, and defined [[wikt:兆|兆]] zhào as the translation for the SI prefix ''[[mega-]]'' (10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;). (Perhaps the government was not aware of the common usage of 兆, and thus did not consider an alternative single Chinese character, such as [[wikt:巨|巨]], to represent ''mega''.) Because of this, the translation has caused much confusion.

In addition, Taiwanese defined 百萬 as the translation for ''mega''. This translation is widely used in official documents, academic communities, informational industries, etc. However, the civil broadcasting industries sometimes use [[wikt:兆赫|兆赫]] to represent &quot;[[megahertz]]&quot;.

Today, both the governments of the [[People's Republic of China]] ([[Mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]) and [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) use phonetic transliterations for the SI prefixes. However, the governments have each chosen different Chinese characters for certain prefixes. The following table lists the two different standards together with the early translation.

=== Reading and transcribing numbers ===
==== Whole numbers ====
Multiple-digit numbers are constructed using a multiplicative principle; first the digit itself (from 1 to 9), then the place (such as 10 or 100); then the next digit.

In Mandarin, the multiplier [[wikt:兩|兩]] (liǎng) is often used rather than [[wikt:二|二]] (èr) for all numbers greater than 200 with the &quot;2&quot; numeral (although as noted earlier this varies from dialect to dialect and person to person). Use of both 兩 (liǎng) or 二 (èr) are acceptable for the number 200. When writing in the Cantonese dialect, 二 (yi&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) is used to represent the &quot;2&quot; numeral for all numbers.  In the southern Min dialect of Chaozhou (Teochew), 兩 (no&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) is used to represent the &quot;2&quot; numeral in all numbers from 200 onwards.  Thus:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! rowspan=2 | Number
! rowspan=2 | Structure
! colspan=4 | Characters

|}

For the numbers 11 through 19, the leading &quot;one&quot; (一) is usually omitted.  In some dialects, like Shanghainese, when there are only two significant digits in the number, the leading &quot;one&quot; and the trailing zeroes are omitted.  Sometimes, the one before &quot;ten&quot; in the middle of a number, such as 213, is omitted.  Thus:

|}

Notes:
# Nothing is ever omitted in large and more complicated numbers such as this.

In certain older texts like the [[Protestant]] [[Bible]] or in poetic usage, numbers such as 114 may be ''written'' as [100] [10] [4] (百十四).

For numbers larger than a [[myriad]], the same grouping system used in English applies, except in groups of four places (myriads) rather than in groups of three (thousands).  Hence it is more convenient to think of numbers here as in groups of four, thus 1,234,567,890 is regrouped here as 12,3456,7890.  Larger than a myriad, each number is therefore four zeroes longer than the one before it, thus 10000 × wàn (萬) = yì (億). If one of the numbers is between 10 and 19, the leading &quot;one&quot; is omitted as per the above point.  Hence (numbers in parentheses indicate that the number has been written as one number rather than expanded):
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Number
! Structure
! Characters
|-
| 12,345,678,902,345&lt;br&gt;(12,3456,7890,2345) || (12) [1,0000,0000,0000] (3456) [1,0000,0000] (7890) [1,0000] (2345) || 十二兆三千四百五十六億七千八百九十萬兩千三百四十五
|}

Interior zeroes before the unit position (as in 1002) must be spelt explicitly.  The reason for this is that trailing zeroes (as in 1200) are often omitted as shorthand, so ambiguity occurs.  One zero is sufficient to resolve the ambiguity.  Where the zero is before a digit other than the units digit, the explicit zero is not ambiguous and is therefore optional, but preferred.  Thus:

|}

====Fractional values====
To construct a fraction, the [[denominator]] is written first, followed by [[wikt:分之|分之]] (&quot;parts of&quot;) and then the [[numerator]]. This is the opposite of how fractions are read in English, which is numerator first. Each half of the fraction is written the same as a whole number. [[Mixed number]]s are written with the whole-number part first, followed by [[wikt:又|又]] (&quot;and&quot;), then the fractional part.

Percentages are constructed similarly, using 百 (100) as the denominator. The 一 (one) before 百 is omitted.

Decimal numbers are constructed by first writing the whole number part, then inserting a point ({{zh|t=[[wikt:點|點]] |s=[[wikt:点|点]] |p=diǎn}}), and finally the decimal expression. The decimal expression is written using only the digits for 0 to 9, without multiplicative words.

== Suzhou numerals ==
{{Main|Suzhou numerals}}

In the same way that [[Roman numerals]] were standard in ancient and medieval Europe for mathematics and commerce, the Chinese formerly used the [[counting rods|rod numerals]], which is a positional system. The Suzhou numerals ({{zh|t=蘇州花碼 |s=苏州花码 |p=Sūzhōu huāmǎ}}) system is a variation of the [[Song Dynasty|Southern Song]] rod numerals. Nowadays, the ''huāmǎ'' system is only used for displaying prices in Chinese markets or on traditional handwritten invoices.

{{Main|Counting rods}}
Ancient Chinese used positional decimal [[Counting rods|counting rod numerals]] for calculation since the [[Spring and Autumn]] period.

==Hand gestures==
{{Main|Chinese number gestures}}

There is a common method of using of one hand to signify the numbers one to ten. While the five digits on one hand can express the numbers one to five, six to ten have special signs that can be used in commerce or day-to-day communication.

== Cultural influences ==

During [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (when Arabic numerals were first introduced into China), some Chinese mathematicians used Chinese numeral characters as positional system digits.  After Qing dynasty, both the Chinese numeral characters and the Suzhou numerals were replaced by Arabic numerals in mathematical writings.

Traditional Chinese numeric characters are also used in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]]. In vertical text (that is, read top to bottom), using characters for numbers is the norm, while in horizontal text, Arabic numerals are most common. Chinese numeric characters are also used in much the same formal or decorative fashion that Roman numerals are in Western cultures. Chinese numerals may appear together with Arabic numbers on the same sign or document.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program has an [[execution (computing)|executable]] form that the computer can use directly to execute the instructions.  The same program in its human-readable [[source code]] form, from which [[executable]] programs are derived (e.g., [[compiler|compiled]]), enables a [[programmer]] to study and develop its [[algorithm#Formalization|algorithms]].

Computer source code is often written by [[computer programmer]]s. Source code is written in a [[programming language]] that usually follows one of two main [[programming paradigm|paradigms]]: [[imperative programming|imperative]] or [[declarative language|declarative]] programming. Source code may be converted into an [[executable file]] (sometimes called an executable program or a binary) by a [[compiler]] and later executed by a [[central processing unit]]. Alternatively, computer programs may be executed with the aid of an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]], or may be [[firmware|embedded]] directly into [[computer hardware|hardware]].

Computer programs may be categorized along functional lines: [[system software]] and [[application software]]. Two or more computer programs may run simultaneously on one computer, a process known as [[computer multitasking|multitasking]].

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
[[Computer programming]] is the iterative process of writing or editing [[source code]]. Editing source code involves testing, analyzing, and refining, and sometimes coordinating with other programmers on a jointly developed program.  A person who practices this skill is referred to as a computer [[programmer]],  software developer or coder. The sometimes lengthy process of computer programming is usually referred to as [[software development]]. The term [[software engineering]] is becoming popular as the process is seen as an [[engineering]] discipline.

===Paradigms===
Computer programs can be categorized by the [[programming language]] [[programming paradigm|paradigm]] used to produce them. Two of the main paradigms are [[imperative programming|imperative]] and [[declarative language|declarative]].

Programs written using an imperative language specify an [[algorithm]] using declarations, expressions, and statements.&lt;ref name=&quot;cpl-ch4-75&quot;&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Wilson
  | first = Leslie B.
  | title = Comparative Programming Languages, Second Edition
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley
  | year = 1993
  | pages = 75
  | isbn = 0-201-56885-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A declaration couples a [[variable (programming)|variable]] name to a [[datatype]]. For example: &lt;code&gt; var x: integer; &lt;/code&gt;. An expression yields a value. For example: &lt;code&gt; 2 + 2 &lt;/code&gt; yields 4. Finally, a statement might assign an expression to a variable or use the value of a variable to alter the program's [[control flow]]. For example: &lt;code&gt;x := 2 + 2; if x = 4 then do_something();&lt;/code&gt; One criticism of imperative languages is the side effect of an assignment statement on a class of variables called non-local variables.&lt;ref name = &quot;cpl-ch9-213&quot;/&gt;

Programs written using a declarative language specify the properties that have to be met by the output. They do not specify details expressed in terms of the control flow of the executing machine but of the mathematical relations between the declared objects and their properties. Two broad categories of declarative languages are [[functional language]]s and [[logical language]]s. The principle behind functional languages (like [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]) is to not allow [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]], which makes it easier to reason about programs like mathematical functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;cpl-ch9-213&quot;&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Wilson
  | first = Leslie B.
  | title = Comparative Programming Languages, Second Edition
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley
  | year = 1993
  | pages = 213
  | isbn = 0-201-56885-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle behind logical languages (like [[Prolog]]) is to define the problem to be solved&amp;nbsp;— the goal&amp;nbsp;— and leave the detailed solution to the Prolog system itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;cpl-ch10-244&quot;&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Wilson
  | first = Leslie B.
  | title = Comparative   Programming Languages, Second Edition
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley
  | year = 1993
  | pages = 244
  | isbn = 0-201-56885-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is defined by providing a list of subgoals. Then each subgoal is defined by further providing a list of its subgoals, etc. If a path of subgoals fails to find a solution, then that subgoal is [[backtracking|backtracked]] and another path is systematically attempted.

The form in which a program is created may be textual or visual. In a [[visual programming language|visual language]] program, elements are graphically manipulated rather than textually specified.

===Compiling or interpreting===
A ''computer program'' in the form of a [[human-readable]], computer programming language is called [[source code]]. Source code may be converted into an [[executable file|executable image]] by a [[compiler]] or executed immediately with the aid of an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].

Either compiled or interpreted programs might be [[execution (computing)|executed]] in a [[batch processing|batch process]] without human interaction, but interpreted programs allow a user to type [[command (computing)|commands]] in an [[session (computer science)|interactive session]]. In this case the programs are the separate commands, whose execution occurs sequentially, and thus together.  When a language is used to give commands to a software application (such as a [[shell (computing)|shell]]) it is called a [[scripting language]].

Compiled computer programs are commonly referred to as executables, binary images, or simply as [[binary file|binaries]]&amp;nbsp;— a reference to the [[binary numeral system|binary]] [[file format]] used to store the executable code. Compilers are used to translate source code from a programming language into either [[object file|object code]] or [[machine code]]. Object code needs further processing to become machine code, and machine code is the [[central processing unit]]'s native [[microcode|code]], ready for execution.

Interpreted computer programs -in a batch or interactive session- are either decoded and then immediately executed or are decoded into some efficient intermediate representation for future execution. [[BASIC]], [[Perl]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] are examples of immediately executed computer programs. Alternatively, [[Java (programming language)|Java]] computer programs are compiled ahead of time and stored as a machine independent code called [[bytecode]]. Bytecode is then executed on request by an interpreter called a [[virtual machine]].

The main disadvantage of interpreters is that computer programs run slower than when compiled. Interpreting code is slower than running the compiled version because the interpreter must [[decode]] each [[statement (programming)|statement]] each time it is loaded and then perform the desired action. However, software development may be faster using an interpreter because testing is immediate when the compiling step is omitted. Another disadvantage of interpreters is that at least one must be present on the computer during computer program execution. By contrast, compiled computer programs need no compiler present during execution.

No properties of a programming language require it to be exclusively compiled or exclusively interpreted. The categorization usually reflects the most popular method of language execution. For example, BASIC is thought of as an interpreted language and C a compiled language, despite the existence of BASIC compilers and C interpreters. Some systems use [[just-in-time compilation]] (JIT) whereby sections of the source are compiled 'on the fly' and stored for subsequent executions.

===Self-modifying programs===
A computer program in [[execution (computers)|execution]] is normally treated as being different from the [[data (computing)|data]] the program operates on. However, in some cases this distinction is blurred when a computer program modifies itself. The modified computer program is subsequently executed as part of the same program. [[Self-modifying code]] is possible for programs written in [[machine code]], [[assembly language]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[COBOL]], [[PL/1]], [[Prolog]] and [[JavaScript]] (the eval feature) among others.

==Execution and storage==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Elektronika BK]] --&gt;
Typically, computer programs are stored in [[non-volatile memory]] until requested either directly or indirectly to be [[execution (computers)|executed]] by the computer user. Upon such a request, the program is loaded into [[random access memory]], by a computer program called an [[operating system]], where it can be accessed directly by the central processor. The central processor then executes (&quot;runs&quot;) the program, instruction by instruction, until termination. A program in execution is called a [[process (computing)|process]].&lt;ref name=&quot;osc-ch4-97&quot;&gt;{{cite book

  | pages = 97
  | isbn = 0-201-50480-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Termination is either by normal self-termination or by error&amp;nbsp;— software or hardware error.

===Embedded programs===
[[Image:USB flash drive.JPG|thumb|230px|left|The [[microcontroller]] on the right of this [[USB flash drive]] is controlled with embedded [[firmware]].]]
Some computer programs are embedded into hardware. A [[stored-program computer]] requires an initial computer program stored in its [[read-only memory]] to [[booting|boot]]. The boot process is to identify and initialize all aspects of the system, from [[processor register]]s to [[device driver|device controllers]] to [[volatile memory|memory]] contents.&lt;ref name=&quot;osc-ch2-p30&quot;&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Silberschatz

  | title = Operating System Concepts, Fourth Edition
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley
  | year = 1994
  | pages = 30
  | isbn = 0-201-50480-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the initialization process, this initial computer program loads the [[operating system]] and sets the [[program counter]] to begin normal operations. Independent of the host computer, a [[Peripheral|hardware device]] might have embedded [[firmware]] to control its operation. Firmware is used when the computer program is rarely or never expected to change, or when the program must not be lost when the power is off.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco-ch1-p11&quot;&gt;{{cite book

  | publisher = Prentice Hall
  | year = 1990
  | pages = 11
  | isbn = 0-13-854662-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manual programming===
[[Image:Dg-nova3.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Switches for manual input on a [[Data General Nova]] 3]]
Computer programs historically were manually input to the central processor via switches. An instruction was represented by a configuration of on/off settings. After setting the configuration, an execute button was pressed. This process was then repeated. Computer programs also historically were manually input via [[paper tape]] or [[punched cards]]. After the medium was loaded, the starting address was set via switches and the execute button pressed.&lt;ref name=&quot;osc-ch1-p6&quot;&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Silberschatz
  | first = Abraham
  | title = Operating System Concepts, Fourth Edition
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley
  | year = 1994
  | pages = 6
  | isbn = 0-201-50480-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automatic program generation===
[[Generative programming]] is a style of [[computer programming]] that creates [[source code]] through [[generic programming|generic]] [[class (computer science)|classes]], [[prototype-based programming|prototypes]], [[template (programming)|templates]], [[aspect (computer science)|aspects]], and [[code generation (compiler)|code generators]] to improve [[programmer]] productivity. Source code is generated with [[programming tool]]s such as a [[template processor]] or an [[integrated development environment]]. The simplest form of source code generator is a [[macro (computer science)|macro]] processor, such as the [[C preprocessor]], which replaces patterns in source code according to relatively simple rules.

[[Software engine]]s output source code or [[markup language|markup code]] that simultaneously become the input to another [[process (computing)|computer process]]. The analogy is that of one process driving another process, with the computer code being burned as fuel. [[Application server]]s are software engines that deliver applications to [[client computer]]s. For example, a [[Wiki software|Wiki]] is an application server that lets users build [[dynamic web page|dynamic content]] assembled from [[article (publishing)|articles]]. Wikis generate [[HTML]], [[CSS]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and [[JavaScript]] which are then [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] by a [[web browser]].

===Simultaneous execution===
{{seealso|Process (computing)|Multiprocessing}}
Many operating systems support [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] which enables many computer programs to appear to run simultaneously on one computer.  Operating systems may run multiple programs through [[process scheduling]]&amp;nbsp;— a software mechanism to [[context switch|switch]] the CPU among processes often so users can [[time-sharing|interact]] with each program while it runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;osc-ch4-100&quot;&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Silberschatz
  | first = Abraham
  | title = Operating System Concepts, Fourth Edition
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley
  | year = 1994
  | pages = 100
  | isbn = 0-201-50480-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within hardware, modern day multiprocessor computers or computers with multicore processors may run multiple programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcore&quot;&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Akhter
  | first = Shameem
  | title = Multi-Core Programming
  | publisher = Richard Bowles (Intel Press)
  | year = 2006
  | pages = 11–13
  | isbn = 0-9764832-4-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One computer program can calculate simultaneously more than one operation using [[thread (computer science)|threads]] or separate [[process (computing)|processes]]. [[Multithreading (computer architecture)|Multithreading]] processors are optimized to execute multiple threads efficiently.

==Functional categories==
Computer programs may be categorized along functional lines. The main functional categories are [[system software]] and [[application software]]. System software includes the [[operating system]] which couples [[computer hardware]] with application software.&lt;ref name = &quot;osc-ch1-1&quot;/&gt; The purpose of the operating system is to provide an environment in which application software executes in a convenient and efficient manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;osc-ch1-1&quot;&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Silberschatz
  | first = Abraham
  | title = Operating System Concepts, Fourth Edition
  | publisher = Addison-Wesley
  | year = 1994
  | pages = 1
  | isbn = 0-201-50480-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the operating system, system software includes [[Utility software|utility programs]] that help manage and tune the computer. If a computer program is not system software then it is application software. Application software includes [[middleware]], which couples the system software with the [[user interface]]. Application software also includes utility programs that help users solve application problems, like the need for sorting.

Sometimes development environments for [[software development]] are seen as a functional category on its own, especially in the context of [[human-computer interaction]] and [[programming language design]]. Development environments gather system software (such as compilers and system's [[batch processing]] scripting languages) and application software (such as [[integrated development environment|IDEs]]) for the specific purpose of helping programmers create new programs.

{{Criminal law}}

'''Crime''' is the breach of rules or [[law]]s for which some [[government|governing authority]] (via mechanisms such as [[legal system]]s) can ultimately prescribe a [[conviction]]. Individual human societies may each define crime and crimes differently, in different localities (state, local, international), at different time stages of the so-called &quot;crime&quot; (planning, disclosure, supposedly intended, supposedly prepared, incompleted, completed or futuristically proclaimed after the &quot;crime&quot;. 

Most crimes are not reported, not recorded, not followed through, or not able to be proved.

While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime; for example: [[breach of contract|breaches of contract]] and of other [[Private law|civil law]] may rank as &quot;[[Offence (law)|offence]]s&quot; or as &quot;[[infraction]]s&quot;. Modern societies generally regard crimes as offences against the public or the state, as distinguished from ''[[tort]]s'' (wrongs against private parties that can give rise to a civil cause of action).

When informal relationships and sanctions prove insufficient to establish and maintain a desired [[social order]], a [[government]] or a [[state (polity)|state]] may impose more formalized or stricter systems of [[social control]]. With institutional and legal machinery at their disposal, agents of the [[State (polity)|State]] can compel [[populations]] to conform to codes, and can opt to punish or attempt to reform those who do not conform.

Authorities employ various mechanisms to regulate (encouraging or discouraging) certain behaviours in general. Governing or administering agencies may for example codify rules into laws, [[police]] citizens and visitors to ensure that they comply with those laws, and implement other policies and practices which legislators or administrators have prescribed with the aim of discouraging or [[crime prevention|preventing crime]]. In addition, authorities provide [[Legal remedy|remedies]] and [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]], and collectively these constitute a [[criminal justice]] system. Legal sanctions vary widely in their severity, they may include (for example) incarceration of temporary character aimed at reforming the convict. Some jurisdictions have penal codes written to inflict permanent harsh punishments: legal [[mutilation]], [[capital punishment]] or [[life without parole]].

The sociologist [[Richard Quinney]] has written about the relationship between society and crime. When Quinney states &quot;crime is a social phenomenon&quot; he envisages both how individuals conceive crime and how populations perceive it, based on societal norms.&lt;ref&gt;Quinney, Richard, &quot;Structural Characteristics, Population Areas, and Crime Rates in the United States,&quot; ''The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology and Police Science'', 57(1), p. 45-52&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually a [[natural person]] perpetrates a crime, but [[legal person]]s may also commit crimes. Conversely, nonpersons such as [[dog]]s cannot commit crimes.&lt;ref&gt;''People v. Frazier'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA4/173CA4t613.htm 173 Cal. App. 4th 613] (2009). In this case, the California Court of Appeal explained: &quot;Despite the physical ability to commit vicious and violent acts, dogs do not possess the legal ability to commit crimes.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''crime'', from the root of Latin ''cernō'' = &quot;I decide, I give judgment&quot;. Originally the Latin word ''crīmen'' meant &quot;[[criminal charge|charge]]&quot; or &quot;cry of distress.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Klein, [http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Etymological-Dictionary-English-Language/dp/0444409300 A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-13th-century English written language ''crime'' meant &quot;sinfulness&quot;, according to [[etymonline.com]]. The glossing was probably brought to England as Old French ''crimne'' (12th-century form of [[Modern French]] ''crime''), from Latin ''crimen'' (in the genitive case: ''criminis''). In Latin, ''crimen'' could have signified any one of the following: &quot;[[charge]], [[indictment]], [[accusation]]; crime, [[fault]], [[offense]]&quot;. 

The word may derive from the Latin ''cernere'' - &quot;to decide, to sift&quot; (see [[crisis]], mapped on [[Kairos]] and [[Kronos]]). But [[Ernest Klein]] (citing [[Karl Brugmann]]) rejects this and suggests *cri-men, which originally would have meant &quot;cry of distress&quot;. Thomas G. Tucker suggests a root in &quot;[[cry]]&quot; words and refers to English [[plaint]], [[plaintiff]], and so on. The meaning &quot;offense punishable by law&quot; dates from the late 14th century. The Latin word is [[gloss]]ed in Old English by ''facen'', also &quot;deceit, fraud, treachery, [cf. fake]. ''Crime wave'' first attested in [[1893]] in [[American English]].

==Definition==
===England and Wales===
Whether a given act or omission constitutes a crime does not depend on the nature of that act or omission. It depends on the nature of the legal consequences that may follow it.&lt;ref&gt;Seaman v Burley [1896] 2 QB, per Lord Esher MR at 346&lt;/ref&gt; An act or omission is a crime if it is capable of being followed by what are called [[criminal proceedings]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Glanville Williams]], Learning the Law, Eleventh Edition, Stevens, 1982, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology===
A [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] [[definition]] views crime as [[deviant behavior]] that violates prevailing [[norm (sociology)|norms]] {{ndash}} [[culture|cultural]] standards prescribing how humans ought to behave normally. This approach considers the complex realities surrounding the concept of crime and seeks to understand how changing [[society|social]], [[politics|political]], [[psychology|psychological]], and [[economics|economic]] conditions may affect changing definitions of crime and the form of the legal, [[Police|law-enforcement]], and penal responses made by society.

These [[structuralism|structural]] realities remain fluid and often contentious. For example: as cultures change and the political environment shifts, societies may [[criminalisation|criminalise]] or [[decriminalisation|decriminalise]] certain behaviours, which will directly affect the [[statistics|statistical]] [[crime rate]]s, influence the allocation of resources for the enforcement of [[laws]], and (re-)influence the general [[public opinion]].

Similarly, changes in the collection and/or calculation of data on crime may affect the public perceptions of the extent of any given &quot;crime problem&quot;. All such adjustments to [[crime statistics]], allied with the experience of people in their everyday lives, shape attitudes on the extent to which the State should use law or [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] to enforce or encourage any particular [[social norm]]. Behaviour can be controlled and influenced{{By whom|date=April 2010}} in many ways without having to resort to the criminal justice system.

Indeed, in those cases where no clear [[consensus]] exists on a given norm, the drafting of [[criminal law]] by the group in [[power (sociology)|power]] to prohibit the behaviour of another group may seem to some observers an improper limitation of the second group's [[Political freedom|freedom]], and the ordinary members of society have less respect for the law or laws in general — whether the authorities actually enforce the disputed law or not.

===Other===
[[Legislature]]s can pass laws (called ''[[mala prohibita]]'') that define crimes which violate social norms. These laws vary from time to time and from place to place: note variations in [[gambling]] laws, for example, and the prohibition or encouragement of [[duelling]] in history. Other crimes, called ''[[mala in se]]'', count as outlawed in almost all societies, ([[murder]], [[theft]] and [[rape]], for example).

[[English criminal law]] and the related criminal law of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries can define offences which the courts alone have developed over the years, without any actual legislation: [[common law offences]]. The courts used the concept of ''[[malum in se]]'' to develop various common law offences.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Law Dictionary, John A. Yogis, Q.C., Barrons: 2003
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criminalization ==
{{Main| Criminalization}}

One can view criminalization as a procedure deployed by society as a pre-emptive, harm-reduction device, using the threat of punishment as a [[Deterrence (legal)|deterrent]] to anyone proposing to engage in the behavior causing harm. The State becomes involved because governing entities can become convinced that the costs of not criminalizing (through allowing the harms to continue unabated) outweigh the costs of criminalizing it (restricting individual [[liberty]], for example, in order to minimize harm to others).

Criminalization may provide future harm-reduction at least to the outside population, assuming those shamed or incarcerated or otherwise restrained for committing crimes start out more prone to criminal behaviour. Likewise, one might assume{{Or|date=July 2009}} that criminalizing acts which in themselves do not harm other people (&quot;[[victimless crime]]s&quot;) may prevent subsequent harmful acts (assuming that people &quot;prone&quot; to commit these acts may tend to commit harmful actions in general). Some{{Who|date=July 2009}} see the criminalization of &quot;victimless crimes&quot; as a pretext for imposing personal, religious or moral convictions on otherwise productive citizens or taxpayers.

Some commentators{{Who|date=May 2009}} may{{Or|date=June 2009}} see criminalization as a way to make potential criminals [[payment|pay]] or suffer for their prospective crimes. In this case, criminalization becomes a way to set the price that one must pay to society for certain actions considered detrimental to society as a whole. An extreme view might see criminalization as State-sanctioned [[revenge]].

States control the process of criminalization because:

* Even if [[victimology|victim]]s recognize their own role as victims, they may not have the resources to investigate and seek legal redress for the injuries suffered: the enforcers formally appointed by the State often have better access to expertise and resources.
* The victims may only want compensation for the injuries suffered, while remaining indifferent to a possible desire for [[deterrence (psychological)|deterrence]].&lt;ref&gt;See Polinsky &amp; Shavell (1997) on the fundamental divergence between the private and the social motivation for using the legal system.
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fear]] of [[retaliate|retaliation]] may deter victims or witnesses of crimes from taking any action. Even in policed societies, fear may inhibit from reporting incidents or from co-operating in a [[Trial (law)|trial]].
* Victims, on their own, may lack the economies of scale which might allow them to administer a penal system, let alone to collect any fines levied by a court.&lt;ref&gt;See Polinsky (1980) on the enforcement of fines&lt;/ref&gt; Garoupa &amp; Klerman (2002) warn that a [[rent-seeking]] government has as its primary motivation to maximize revenue and so, if offenders have sufficient wealth, a rent-seeking government will act more aggressively than a [[social welfare function|social-welfare]]-maximizing government in enforcing laws against minor crimes (usually with a fixed penalty such as parking and routine traffic violations), but more laxly in enforcing laws against major crimes.
* As a result of the crime, victims may die or become incapacitated.

==Labelling theory==

See [[Labeling theory#The &quot;criminal&quot;]]

The [[Labeling theory|label]] of &quot;crime&quot; and the accompanying [[social stigma]] normally confine their scope to those activities seen as injurious to the general population or to the State, including some that cause serious loss or damage to individuals. Those who apply the labels of &quot;crime&quot; or &quot;criminal&quot; intend to assert the [[hegemony]] of a dominant population, or to reflect a consensus of condemnation for the identified behavior and to justify any punishments prescribed by the State (in the event that [[due process|standard processing]] [[trial (law)|tries]] and [[conviction (law)|convicts]] an accused person of a crime).

== Natural-law theory ==
Justifying the State's use of [[coercion|force]] to coerce compliance with its laws has proven a consistent theoretical problem. One of the earliest justifications involved the theory of [[natural law]]. This posits that the nature of the world or of human beings underlies the standards of [[morality]] or constructs them. [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote in the 13th century: &quot;the rule and measure of human acts is the [[reason]], which is the first principle of human acts&quot; (Aquinas, ST I-II, Q.90, A.I). He regarded people as by nature [[rationality|rational]] beings, concluding that it becomes morally appropriate that they should behave in a way that conforms to their rational nature. Thus, to be valid, any law must conform to natural law and coercing people to conform to that law is morally acceptable. In the 1760s [[William Blackstone]] (1979: 41) described the thesis:

:&quot;This law of nature, being co-eval with mankind and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original.&quot;

But [[John Austin (legal philosophy)|John Austin]] (1790–1859), an early [[Legal positivism|positivist]], applied [[utilitarianism]] in accepting the calculating nature of human beings and the existence of an objective morality. He denied that the legal validity of a norm depends on whether its content conforms to morality. Thus in Austinian terms a moral code can objectively determine what people ought to do, the law can embody whatever norms the legislature decrees to achieve social utility, but every individual remains free to choose what he or she will do. Similarly, [[H.L.A. Hart|Hart]] (1961) saw the law as an aspect of [[sovereignty]], with lawmakers able to adopt any law as a means to a moral end.

Thus the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of a proposition of law simply involved internal [[logic]] and [[consistency]], and that the state's agents used state power with [[Social responsibility|responsibility]]. [[Ronald Dworkin]] (2005) rejects Hart's theory and proposes that all individuals should expect the equal respect and concern of those who govern them as a fundamental political right. He offers a theory of compliance overlaid by a theory of [[deference]] (the citizen's duty to obey the law) and a theory of enforcement, which identifies the legitimate goals of enforcement and punishment. Legislation must conform to a theory of legitimacy, which describes the circumstances under which a particular person or group is entitled to make law, and a theory of legislative justice, which describes the law they are entitled or obliged to make.

Indeed, despite everything, the majority{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} of natural-law theorists have accepted the idea of enforcing the prevailing morality as a primary function of the law. This view entails the problem that it makes any moral criticism of the law impossible: if conformity with natural law forms a necessary condition for legal validity, all valid law must, by definition, count as morally just. Thus, on this line of reasoning, the legal validity of a norm necessarily entails its moral justice.{{Clarify|date=December 2009|reason=see talk page 'Natural-law theory P5'}}

One can solve this problem by granting some degree of [[moral relativism]] and accepting that norms may evolve over time and, therefore, one can criticize the continued enforcement of old laws in the light of the current norms. People may find such law acceptable, but the use of State power to coerce citizens to comply with that law lacks moral justification. More recent conceptions of the theory characterise crime as the violation of [[individual rights]].

Since society considers so many rights as natural (hence the term &quot;[[right]]&quot;) rather than man-made, what constitutes a crime also counts as natural, in contrast to laws (seen as man-made). [[Adam Smith]] illustrates this view, saying that a [[smuggling|smuggler]] would be an excellent citizen, &quot;...had not the laws of his country made that a crime which nature never meant to be so.&quot;

Natural-law theory therefore distinguishes between &quot;criminality&quot; (which derives from human nature) and &quot;illegality&quot; (which originates with the interests of those in [[power (sociology)|power]]). Lawyers sometimes express the two concepts with the phrases ''[[malum in se]]'' and ''[[malum prohibitum]]'' respectively. They regard a &quot;crime ''malum in se''&quot; as inherently criminal; whereas a &quot;crime ''malum prohibitum''&quot; (the argument goes) counts as criminal only because the law has decreed it so.

This view leads to a seeming [[paradox]]: one can perform an illegal act without committing a crime, while a criminal act could be perfectly legal. Many [[the Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers (such as Adam Smith and the American [[Founding Fathers]]) subscribed to this view to some extent, and it remains influential among so-called [[Liberalism#Classical_and_modern|classical liberals]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} and [[libertarian]]s{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.

== History ==
Some religious communities regard [[sin]] as a crime; some may even highlight the crime of sin very early in legendary or mythological accounts of origins — note the tale of [[Adam and Eve]] and the theory of [[original sin]]. What one group considers a crime may cause or ignite [[war]] or conflict. However, the earliest known [[civilization]]s had codes of [[law]], containing both [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and penal rules mixed together, though not always in recorded form.

The [[Sumer]]ians produced the earliest surviving written codes.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urukagina]] (reigned c .2380 BC–2360 BC, [[short chronology]]) had an early code that has not survived; a later king, [[Ur-Nammu]], left the earliest extant written law-system, the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] (c .2100-2050 BC), which prescribed a formal system of penalties for specific cases in 57 articles. The Sumerians later issued other codes, including the &quot;code of [[Lipit-Ishtar]]&quot;. This code, from the 20th century BCE, contains some fifty articles, and scholars have reconstructed it by comparing several sources. {{quote|The Sumerian was deeply conscious of his personal rights and resented any encroachment on them, whether by his King, his superior, or his equal. No wonder that the Sumerians were the first to compile laws and law codes.| Kramer&lt;ref&gt;
Kramer (1971: 4)
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Successive legal codes in [[Babylon]], including the [[code of Hammurabi]] (c. 1790 BC), reflected [[Mesopotamian]] society's belief that law derived from the will of the [[gods]] (see [[Babylonian law]]).&lt;ref&gt;
Driver and Mills (1952-55) and Skaist (1994)
&lt;/ref&gt;
Many states at this time functioned as [[theocracy|theocracies]], with codes of conduct largely religious in origin or reference.

[[Sir Henry Maine]] (1861) studied the ancient codes available in his day, and failed to find any criminal law in the &quot;modern&quot; sense of the word. While modern systems distinguish between offences against the &quot;State&quot; or &quot;Community&quot;, and offences against the &quot;Individual&quot;, the so-called penal law of ancient communities did not deal with &quot;crimes&quot; (Latin: ''crimina''), but with &quot;wrongs&quot; (Latin: ''delicta''). Thus the Hellenic laws&lt;ref&gt;Gagarin: 1986; and Garner: 1987&lt;/ref&gt; treated all forms of [[theft]], [[assault]], [[rape]], and murder as private wrongs, and left action for enforcement up to the victims or their survivors. The earliest systems seem to have lacked formal courts.

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] systematized law and applied their system across the [[Roman Empire]]. Again, the initial rules of [[Roman Law]] regarded assaults as a matter of private compensation. The most significant Roman Law concept involved ''dominion''.&lt;ref&gt;Daube: 1969&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[pater familias]]'' owned all the family and its property (including slaves); the ''pater'' enforced matters involving interference with any property. The ''Commentaries'' of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] (written between 130 and 180 AD) on the [[Twelve Tables]] treated ''furtum'' (in modern parlance: &quot;theft&quot;) as a [[tort]].

Similarly, assault and violent [[robbery]] involved [[trespass]] as to the ''pater's'' property (so, for example, the rape of a slave could become the subject of compensation to the ''pater'' as having trespassed on his &quot;property&quot;), and breach of such laws created a ''vinculum juris'' (an obligation of law) that only the payment of monetary compensation (modern &quot;[[damages]]&quot;) could discharge. Similarly, the consolidated [[Germanic law|Teutonic laws]] of the [[Germanic tribes]],&lt;ref&gt;Guterman: 1990&lt;/ref&gt; included a complex system of monetary compensations for what courts would {{As of| 2008 | alt = now}} consider the complete{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} range of criminal offences against the person, from murder down.

Even though Rome abandoned its [[Roman Britain|Britannic provinces]] around 400 AD, the Germanic mercenaries {{ndash}} who had largely become instrumental in enforcing Roman rule in Britannia {{ndash}} acquired ownership of land there and continued to use a mixture of Roman and Teutonic Law, with much written down under the early [[Anglo-Saxon Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;Attenborough: 1963&lt;/ref&gt; But only when a more centralized English monarchy emerged following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]], and when the kings of England attempted to assert power over the land and its peoples, did the modern concept emerge, namely of a crime not only as an offence against the &quot;individual&quot;, but also as a wrong against the &quot;State&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Kern: 1948; Blythe: 1992; and Pennington: 1993
&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea came from [[common law]], and the earliest conception of a criminal act involved events of such major significance that the &quot;State&quot; had to usurp the usual functions of the civil tribunals, and direct a special law or ''privilegium'' against the perpetrator. All the earliest English criminal trials involved wholly extraordinary and arbitrary courts without any settled law to apply, whereas the civil (delictual) law operated in a highly developed and consistent manner (except where a [[King]] wanted to raise money by selling a new form of [[writ]]). The development of the idea that the &quot;State&quot; dispenses [[justice]] in a court only emerges in parallel with or after the emergence of the concept of [[sovereignty]].

In continental Europe, Roman law persisted, but with a stronger influence from the Christian Church.&lt;ref&gt;Vinogradoff (1909); Tierney: 1964, 1979
&lt;/ref&gt;
Coupled with the more diffuse political structure based on smaller feudal units, various different legal traditions emerged, remaining more strongly rooted in Roman [[jurisprudence]], but modified to meet the prevailing [[political climate]].

In Scandinavia the effect of Roman law did not become apparent until the 17th century, and the courts grew out of the ''[[thing (assembly)|thing]]s'' — the assemblies of the people. The people decided the cases (usually with largest freeholders dominating). This system later gradually developed into a system with a royal judge nominating a number of the most esteemed men of the parish as his board, fulfilling the function of &quot;the people&quot; of yore.

From the [[Hellenic world|Hellenic]] system onwards, the policy rationale for requiring the payment of monetary compensation for wrongs committed has involved the avoidance of [[feud]]ing between [[clan]]s and [[family|families]].&lt;ref&gt;
The concept of the ''pater familias'' acted as a unifying factor in extended kin-groups, and the later practice of ''[[wergild]]'' functioned in this context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
If compensation could mollify families' feelings, this would help to keep the peace. On the other hand, the institution of oaths also played down the threat of [[endemic warfare|feudal warfare]]. Both in archaic Greece and in [[Middle Age|medieval]] [[Scandinavia]], an accused person walked free if he could get a sufficient number of male relatives to swear him unguilty. (Compare the [[United Nations Security Council]], in which the [[veto]] power of the permanent members ensures that the organization does not become involved in crises where it could not enforce its decisions.)

These means of restraining private [[feuds]] did not always work, and sometimes prevented the fulfillment of justice. But in the earliest times the &quot;state&quot; did not always provide an independent policing force. Thus criminal law grew out what 21st-century lawyers would call torts; and, in real terms, many acts and omissions classified as crimes actually overlap with civil-law concepts.

The development of [[sociology|sociological]] thought from the 19th century onwards prompted some fresh views on crime and criminality, and fostered the beginnings of [[criminology]] as a study of crime in society. [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] noted a link between crime and [[creativity]] {{ndash}} in ''[[Birth of Tragedy|The Birth of Tragedy]]'' he asserted&lt;!-- in what context? --&gt;: &quot;The best and brightest that man can acquire he must obtain by crime&quot;. In the 20th century [[Michel Foucault]] in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' made a study of [[criminalization]] as a coercive method of state control.

==Classification and categorisation==
{{Globalize|section|date=January 2010}}

===Categorisation by type===
The following classes of offences are used, or have been used, as legal terms of art:
*[[Offence against the person]]&lt;ref&gt;For example, by the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Violent offence]]&lt;ref&gt;For example, by section 31(1) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1991]], and by the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sexual offence]]&lt;ref&gt;For example, by section 31(1) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1991]], and by the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Offence against property]]&lt;ref&gt;For example, by the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers and commentators have classified crimes into the following categories, in addition to those above:

*Forgery, personation and cheating&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 22&lt;/ref&gt;
*Firearms and offensive weapons&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 24&lt;/ref&gt;
*Offences against the State/Offences against the Crown and Government&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt;/Political offences&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Card, Cross and Jones: Criminal Law, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
*Harmful or dangerous drugs&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 26&lt;/ref&gt;
*Offences against [[religion]] and public worship&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 27&lt;/ref&gt;
*Offences against public justice&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 28&lt;/ref&gt;/Offences against the administration of public justice&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Card, Cross and Jones: Criminal Law, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Public order offence]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 29&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Commerce]], [[financial market]]s and [[insolvency]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 30&lt;/ref&gt;
*Offences against [[public morals]] and [[public policy]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 31&lt;/ref&gt;
*Motor vehicle offences&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 32&lt;/ref&gt;
*Conspiracy, incitement and attempt to commit crime&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 33&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Inchoate offence]]
*[[Juvenile Delinquency]]

===Categorisation by penalty===
One can categorise crimes depending on the related punishment, with [[sentence (law)|sentencing]] [[tariff]]s prescribed in line with the perceived seriousness of the offence. Thus [[Fine (penalty)|fine]]s and noncustodial sentences may address the crimes seen as least serious, with lengthy imprisonment or (in some jurisdictions) [[capital punishment]] reserved for the most serious.

===Common law===
Under the common law of [[England]], crimes were classified as either [[treason]], [[felony]] or [[misdemeanour]], with treason sometimes being included with the felonies. This system was based on the perceived seriousness of the offence. It is still used in the [[United States]] but the distinction between felony and misdemeanour is abolished in [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

===Classification by mode of trial===
The following classes of offence are based on [[mode of trial]]:
* [[Indictable-only offence]]
* [[Indictable offence]]
* [[Hybrid offence]], aka either-way offence in England and Wales
* [[Summary offence]], aka [[infraction]] in the US

===Classification by origin===
In common law countries, crimes may be categorised into those which are [[common law offences]] and those which are [[statutory]]. In the US, Australia and Canada (in particular), they are divided into [[federal crime]]s and those under state law.

===Other===
*[[Arrestable offence]]

=== U.S. classification ===
In the [[United States]] since 1930, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has tabulated [[Uniform Crime Reports]] (UCR) annually from crime data submitted by [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] agencies across the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm FBI: Uniform Crime Reports]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Officials compile this data at the city, county, and [[U.S. state|state]] levels into the [[Uniform crime report]]s (UCR). They classify violations of laws which derive from [[common law]] as Part I (index) crimes in UCR data, further categorised as violent or property crimes. Part I violent crimes include murder and criminal homicide (voluntary manslaughter), forcible rape, aggravated assault, and robbery; while Part I property crimes include burglary, arson, larceny/theft, and motor-vehicle theft. All other crimes count come under Part II.

For convenience, such lists usually include [[infraction]]s although, in the U.S., they may come into the sphere not of the criminal law, but rather of the [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]]. Compare [[tort]]feasance.

Booking-[[arrest]]s require detention for a time-frame ranging 1 to 24 hours.

== Crimes in international law ==
{{Main|International criminal law}}
Crimes defined by [[treaty]] as crimes against international law include:
* [[crime against peace|crimes against peace]]
* [[Crime of apartheid|crimes of apartheid]]
* [[genocide]]
* [[piracy]]
* [[slavery]]
* waging a [[war of aggression]]
* [[war crime]]s

From the point of view of State-centric law, extraordinary procedures (usually [[international court]]s) may prosecute such crimes. Note the role of the [[International Criminal Court]] at [[The Hague]] in the [[Netherlands]].

Popular opinion in the [[Western world|Western]] World and [[Former Soviet Union]] often{{When|date=March 2009}} associates international law with the concept of opposing terrorism{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} — seen as a crime as distinct from warfare.

== Religion and crime ==
[[Image:Hep-hep riots.jpg|thumb|280px|Religion|[[Religious]] sentiment often becomes a contributory factor of crime. 1819 anti-Jewish riots in Frankfurt where rioters attacked Jewish businesses and destroyed property]]

Different religious traditions may promote distinct norms of behaviour, and these in turn may clash or harmonise with the perceived interests of a state. Socially accepted or imposed religious morality has influenced secular jurisdictions on issues that may otherwise concern only an individual's conscience. Activities sometimes criminalized on religious grounds include (for example) [[alcohol]]-consumption ([[prohibition]]), [[abortion]] and [[stem cell|stem-cell]] research. In various historical and present-day societies institutionalized religions have established systems of earthly justice which punish crimes against the divine will and against specific devotional, organizational and other rules under specific codes, such as Roman Catholic [[canon law]].

== Military jurisdictions and states of emergency ==
In the [[military]] sphere, authorities can prosecute both regular crimes and specific acts (such as [[mutiny]] or [[desertion]]) under [[martial law|martial-law]] codes that either supplant or extend civil codes in times of (for example) war.

Many constitutions contain provisions to curtail freedoms and criminalize otherwise tolerated behaviors under a [[state of emergency]] in the event of war, natural disaster or civil unrest. Undesired activities at such times may include [[Freedom of assembly|assembly]] in the streets, violation of [[curfew]], or [[Gun possession|possession of firearms]].

== Employee crime ==
{{Main| Occupational crime}}
Two common types of [[employee]] crime exist: [[embezzlement]] and [[sabotage]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The complexity and anonymity of computer systems may help criminal employees camouflage their operations. The victims of the most costly [[scam]]s include banks, brokerage houses, insurance companies, and other large financial institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Computing1&quot;&gt;
Sara Baase, &quot;A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing and The Internet. Third Ed. 'Employee Crime'&quot; (2008)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people guilty of embezzlement do not have [[criminal history|criminal histories]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Embezzlers tend to have a gripe against their [[employer]], have financial problems, or simply an inability to resist the temptation of a loophole they have found.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Screening and [[background checks]] on perspective employees can help in prevention; however, many laws make some types of screening difficult or even illegal. Fired or disgruntled employees sometimes sabotage their company's computer system as a form of &quot;[[revenge|pay back]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Computing1&quot;/&gt; This sabotage may take the form of a [[logic bomb]], a [[computer virus]], or creating general havoc.

Some [[employer|places of employment]] have developed measures in an attempt to combat and prevent employee crime. Places of employment sometimes implement security measures such as cameras, fingerprint records of employees, and background checks.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Although privacy-advocates have questioned such methods, they appear to serve the interests of the organisations using them. Not only do these methods help prevent employee crime, but they protect the company from punishment and/or lawsuits for negligent hiring.&lt;ref name=negligenthiring&gt;

The '''California Institute of Technology ''' (commonly referred to as '''Caltech''')&lt;ref name=&quot;caltech&quot;&gt;The university itself only spells its short form as &quot;Caltech&quot;; other spellings such as [http://styleguide.caltech.edu/wordmark &quot;Cal Tech&quot; and &quot;CalTech&quot; are incorrect]. The Institute is also occasionally referred to as &quot;CIT&quot;, most notably in its alma mater, but this is uncommon.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[private university|private]] research university located in [[Pasadena, California]], [[United States]]. Caltech has six academic divisions with strong emphases on science and engineering. Its 124 acre (50 ha) primary campus is located approximately 11&amp;nbsp;mi (18&amp;nbsp;km) northeast of [[Downtown Los Angeles|downtown]] [[Los Angeles]].

Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by [[Amos G. Throop]] in 1891, the eponymous college attracted influential scientists such as [[George Ellery Hale]], [[Arthur Amos Noyes]], and [[Robert Andrews Millikan]] in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910, and the college assumed its present name in 1921. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the [[Association of American Universities]], and the antecedents of [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under [[Theodore von Karman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aau&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aau.edu/about/article.aspx?id=5476 |title=Member Institutions |publisher=American Association of Universities |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/jplhistory/early/ |title=Early History |publisher=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caltech enrolls approximately 950 undergraduate and 1200 graduate students and employs about 300 professorial faculty.&lt;ref name=&quot;enrollment&quot;/&gt; Despite its small size, 31 Caltech alumni and faculty have won the [[Nobel Prize]] and 65&amp;nbsp;have won the [[National Medal of Science]] or [[National Medal of Technology|Technology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;at a glance&quot;/&gt; There are 112 faculty members who have been elected to the [[United States National Academies|National Academies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;at a glance&quot;/&gt; Caltech managed $332&amp;nbsp;million in sponsored research and $1.55&amp;nbsp;billion for its endowment in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;endowment&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marcomm.caltech.edu/pdf/Caltech_Overview_2010_2011.pdf |title=Caltech Overview 2010-2011 |publisher=Caltech Office of Marketing and Communications |accessdate=Mar 08, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First year students are required to live on campus and 95% of undergraduates remain in the on-campus [[House System at Caltech|house system]]. Although Caltech has a strong tradition of practical jokes and pranks,&lt;ref name=&quot;geek pranks&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1839579_1839578_1839524,00.html |title=The Biggest Pranks in Geek History |journal=Time |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Laura |date=September 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; student life is governed by an honor code which allows faculty to assign take-home examinations. The Caltech Beavers compete in 13 intercollegiate sports in the [[NCAA]] [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]]'s [[Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]].

== History ==
===Throop College===
[[Image:Throop Polytechnic Institute, Pasadena, Calif.jpg|thumb|290px|left|Throop Polytechnic Institute, Pasadena, Calif, 1908, on its original campus at downtown Pasadena.]]
Caltech began as a [[vocational school]] founded in Pasadena in 1891 by local businessman and politician [[Amos G. Throop]]. The school was known successively as '''Throop University''', '''Throop Polytechnic Institute''', and '''Throop College of Technology''', before acquiring its current name in 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;overview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;incorporation&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bot.caltech.edu/articles |title=Articles of Incorporation |publisher=Board of Trustees, California Institute of Technology |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vocational school was disbanded and the preparatory program was split off to form an independent [[Polytechnic School]] in 1907.

At a time when scientific research in the United States was still in its infancy, [[George Ellery Hale]], a solar astronomer from the [[University of Chicago]], founded the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] in 1904. He joined Throop's board of trustees in 1907, and soon began developing it and the whole of Pasadena into a major scientific and cultural destination. He engineered the appointment of [[James Augustin Brown Scherer|James A. B. Scherer]], a literary scholar untutored in science but a capable administrator and fund raiser, to Throop's presidency in 1908. Scherer persuaded retired businessman and trustee Charles W. Gates to donate $25,000 in seed money to build Gates Laboratory, the first science building on campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;gates lab&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodstein|first=Judith R.|title=Milikan's School: A History of the California Institute of Technology|publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]|location=New York|year=1991|pages=51–63|chapter=Preamble to a Technical School|isbn=0-393-03017-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Wars===
[[Image:CalTech-1912.jpg|thumb|right|Throop Hall, 1912.]]
In 1910, Throop moved to its current site. Arther Fleming donated the land for the permanent campus site. In 1911, a bill was introduced in the [[California Legislature]] calling for the establishment of a publicly funded &quot;California Institute of Technology,&quot; with an initial budget of a million dollars, ten times the budget of Throop at the time. The board of trustees offered to turn Throop over to the state, but the presidents of [[Stanford University]] and the [[University of California]] successfully lobbied to defeat the bill, which allowed Throop to develop as the only scientific research-oriented education institute in southern California, public or private, until the onset of the [[World War II]] necessitated the broader development of research-based science education.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Dream Endures&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Starr|first=Kevin|title=The Dream Endures: California Enters the 1940s|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|year=1997|pages=74–77|chapter=Unto the Stars Themselves, Astronomy and the Pasadena Perspective|isbn=0-19-515797-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promise of Throop attracted [[physical chemistry|physical chemist]] [[Arthur Amos Noyes]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] to develop the institution and assist in establishing it as a center for [[science]] and [[technology]].

With the onset of [[World War I]], Hale organized the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] to coordinate and support scientific work on military problems. While he supported the idea of federal appropriations for science, he took exception to a federal bill that would have funded engineering research at land-grant colleges, and instead sought to raise a $1 million national research fund entirely from private sources. To that end, as Hale wrote in the [[New York Times]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Throop College of Technology, in Pasadena California has recently afforded a striking illustration of one way in which the Research Council can secure co-operation and advance scientific investigation. This institution, with its able investigators and excellent research laboratories, could be of great service in any broad scheme of cooperation. President Scherer, hearing of the formation of the council, immediately offered to take part in its work, and with this object, he secured within three days an additional research endowment of one hundred thousand dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRC&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodstein|first=Judith R.|title=Milikan's School: A History of the California Institute of Technology|publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]|location=New York|year=1991|pages=64–75|chapter=The Birth of Caltech|isbn=0-393-03017-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Through the National Research Council, Hale simultaneously lobbied for science to play a larger role in national affairs, and for Throop to play a national role in science. The new funds were designated for physics research, and ultimately lead to the establishment of the Norman Bridge Laboratory, which attracted experimental [[physics|physicist]] [[Robert Andrews Millikan]] from the University of Chicago in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;bridge lab&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodstein|first=Judith R.|title=Milikan's School: A History of the California Institute of Technology|publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]|location=New York|year=1991|pages=71–75|chapter=The Birth of Caltech|isbn=0-393-03017-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the war, Hale, Noyes and Millikan worked together in Washington on the NRC. Subsequently, they continued their partnership in developing Caltech.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRC&quot;/&gt;

Under the leadership of Hale, Noyes and Millikan (aided by the booming economy of [[Southern California]]), Caltech grew to national prominence in the 1920s. In 1923, Millikan was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Physics]]. In 1925, the school established a department of [[geology]] and hired [[William Bennett Munro]], then chairman of the division of History, Government, and Economics at [[Harvard University]], to create a division of [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] at Caltech. In 1928, a division of [[biology]] was established under the leadership of [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], the most distinguished biologist in the United States at the time, and discoverer of the role of genes and the [[chromosome]] in heredity. In 1930, [[Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory]] was established in Corona del Mar under the care of Professor [[George MacGinitie]]. In 1926, a graduate school of [[aeronautics]] was created, which eventually attracted [[Theodore von Kármán]]. Kármán later helped create the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and played an integral part in establishing Caltech as one of the world's centers for [[rocket|rocket science]]. In 1928, construction of the [[Palomar Observatory]] began.

Millikan served as &quot;Chairman of the Executive Council&quot; (effectively Caltech's president) from 1921 to 1945, and his influence was such that the Institute was occasionally referred to as &quot;Millikan's School.&quot; Millikan initiated a visiting-scholars program soon after joining Caltech. Scientists who accepted his invitation include luminaries such as [[Paul Dirac]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Niels Bohr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/articles/goodstein/ |title=History of Caltech |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]] arrived on the Caltech campus for the first time in 1931 to polish up his [[Theory of General Relativity]], and he returned to Caltech subsequently as a visiting professor in 1932 and 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.caltech.edu/about/fastfacts.html |title=Fast Facts about Caltech History |publisher=The Caltech Archives |accessdate=Mar 08, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war growth===
In the 1950s-1970s, Caltech was the home of [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Richard Feynman]], whose work was central to the establishment of the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics. Feynman was also widely known outside the physics community as an exceptional teacher and colorful, unconventional character.

During [[Lee A. DuBridge]]'s tenure as Caltech's president (1946–1969), Caltech's faculty doubled and the campus tripled in size. DuBridge, unlike his predecessors, welcomed [[federal funding]] of science. New research fields flourished, including [[chemical biology]], [[planetary science]], [[nuclear astrophysics]], and [[geochemistry]]. A 200-inch telescope was dedicated on nearby Palomar Mountain in 1948 and remained the world's most powerful optical telescope for over forty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/hale.html |title=The 200-inch Hale Telescope |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caltech opened its doors to female undergraduates during the presidency of [[Harold Brown]] in 1970, and they made up 14% of the entering class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/06/local/me-caltech6 |title=Caltech chemistry improves |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=August 12, 2010 | first=Larry | last=Gordon | date=August 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fraction of female undergraduates has been increasing since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;at a glance&quot;/&gt;

Caltech undergraduates have historically been so apathetic to politics that there has been only one organized student protest in January 1968 outside the Burbank studios of [[NBC]], in response to rumors that NBC was to cancel [[Star Trek]]. In 1973, the students from [[Dabney House]] protested a presidential visit with a sign on the library bearing the simple phrase &quot;Impeach Nixon&quot;. The following week, Ross McCollum, president of the [[National Oil Company]], wrote an open letter to Dabney House stating that in light of their actions he had decided not to donate one million dollars to Caltech. The Dabney family, being Republicans, disowned Dabney House after hearing of the prank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pandora.caltech.edu/~antognini/tunnels.pdf |title=Caltech’s Underground History |publisher=Joe Antognini |accessdate=August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history===
Since 2000, the [[Einstein Papers Project]] has been located at Caltech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.einstein.caltech.edu/papers.html |title=Collected Papers of Albert Einstein |accessdate=Jan 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was established in 1986 to assemble, preserve, translate, and publish papers selected from the literary estate of Albert Einstein and from other collections.

In fall 2008, the freshman class was 42% female, a record for Caltech's undergraduate enrollment.&lt;ref name=&quot;at a glance&quot;/&gt; In the same year, the Institute concluded a six-year long fund-raising campaign. The campaign raised more than $1.4 billion from about 16,000 donors. Nearly half of the funds went into the support of Caltech programs and projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://one.caltech.edu/homepage/campaign_brochure.pdf |title=Campaign Summary |accessdate=Jan 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Caltech, in partnership with [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], established a [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] Energy Innovation Hub aimed at developing revolutionary methods to generate fuels directly from sunlight. This hub, the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, will receive up to $122 million in federal funding over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solarfuelshub.org/ |title=Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis |accessdate=Jan 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[TEDx]] was organized in 2011, called TEDxCaltech. The theme of the event was ''Feynman's Vision: The Next 50 Years''. The speakers included Caltech faculty and students, as well as external professors and entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tedxcaltech.com/about/ |title=About TEDxCaltech |accessdate=Jan 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campus ==
{{See also|List of California Institute of Technology buildings and facilities}}

[[Image:Millikan Library, Caltech.jpg|thumb|right|Millikan Library, the tallest building on campus]]
Caltech's {{convert|124|acre|ha|adj=on}} primary campus is located in [[Pasadena, California]], approximately {{convert|11|mi|km}} northeast of [[Downtown Los Angeles|downtown]] [[Los Angeles]]. It is within walking distance of [[Old Town Pasadena]] and the [[Playhouse District, Pasadena, California|Pasadena Playhouse District]] and therefore the two locations are frequent getaways for Caltech students.

In 1917 Hale hired architect [[Bertram Goodhue]] to produce a master plan for the {{convert|22|acre|ha|0}} campus. Goodhue conceived the overall layout of the campus and designed the physics building, Dabney Hall, and several other structures, in which he sought to be consistent with the local climate, the character of the school, and Hale's educational philosophy. Goodhue's designs for Caltech were also influenced by the traditional [[Architecture of the California Missions|Spanish mission architecture]] of Southern California.

In 1971 a [[1971 San Fernando earthquake|magnitude-6.6 earthquake]] in [[San Fernando, California|San Fernando]] caused some damage to the Caltech campus. Engineers who evaluated the damage found that two historic buildings dating from the early days of the Institute&amp;nbsp;— Throop Hall and the Goodhue-designed Culbertson Auditorium&amp;nbsp;— had cracked. These were some of the first [[reinforced concrete]] buildings, and their plans did not contain enough details (such as how much [[rebar|reinforcing bar]] had been embedded in the concrete) to be sure they were safe, so the engineers recommended demolition. However, demolishing these historic structures required considerably more effort than would have been necessary had they been in real danger of collapse. A large [[wrecking ball]] was used to demolish Throop Hall, and smashing the concrete revealed massive amounts of rebar, far in excess of safety requirements. The rebar had to be cut up before the pieces could be hauled away, and the process took much longer than expected.

New additions to the campus include the Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Walter and Leonore Annenberg Center for Information Science and Technology, which opened in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/education-training/students-student-life/12035174-1.html |title=Quantum leap: Caltech facility combines astronomy, astrophysics |publisher=AllBusiness |date=2009-01-26 |accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.caltech.edu/today/story-display.tcl?story_id=37963 |title=Walter and Leonore Annenberg Center for Information Science and Technology |publisher=Caltech |date=2009-08-10 |accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Warren and Katherine Schlinger Laboratory for Chemistry and Chemical Engineering followed in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.caltech.edu/today/story-display.tcl?story_id=42903 |title=Caltech Cuts the Ribbon on Schlinger Laboratory |publisher=Caltech |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute also concluded an upgrading of the [[House_System_at_the_California_Institute_of_Technology#The_South_Houses|south houses]] in 2006.

=== Undergraduate program ===
[[File:Laboratories of the Biological Sciences, Cal Tech.jpg|thumb|Kerckhoff Laboratory of the Biological Sciences]]The full time, four year undergraduate program emphasizes instruction in the arts and sciences and has high graduate coexistence.&lt;ref name=&quot;carnegie&quot;/&gt; Caltech offers 24 majors (called &quot;options&quot;) and six minors across all six academic divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://admissions.caltech.edu/learning/options |title=Caltech Undergraduate Admissions: Options of Study |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caltech also offers interdisciplinary programs in Applied Physics, Biochemistry, Bioengineering, Computation and Neural Systems, Control and Dynamical Systems, Environmental Science and Engineering, Geobiology and Astrobiology, Geochemistry, and Planetary Astronomy. The most popular options are Chemical Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Physics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Office of the Registrar Newsletter&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.registrar.caltech.edu/newsletter.htm |title=Office of the Registrar Newsletter |year=2010 |publisher=Caltech Office of the Registrar |accessdate=2010-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caltech requires students to take a core curriculum of 30 classes: five terms of mathematics, five terms of physics, two terms of chemistry, one term of biology, a freshman elective &quot;menu&quot; course, two terms of introductory lab courses, 2 terms of science writing, and 12 terms of humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissions.caltech.edu/learning/core |title=Caltech Undergraduate Admissions: Core Curriculum |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical class is worth 9 academic units and given the extensive core curriculum requirements in addition to individual options' degree requirements, students need to take an average of 40.5 units per term (more than four classes) in order to graduate in four years. 36 units is the minimum full-time load, 48 units is considered a heavy load, and registrations above 51 units require an overload petition.&lt;ref name=&quot;fah&quot;&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF |url=http://www.deans.caltech.edu/PDF/FAHOct09.pdf |title=Information for Freshman Advisors, 2009-2010 |date=October 2009 |last1=Hall |first1=John D. |last2=Green |first2=Barbara C. |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 20 percent of students double-major.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissions.caltech.edu/faqs |title=Caltech Undergraduate Admissions: FAQ |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is achievable since the humanities and social sciences majors have been designed to be done in conjunction with a science major. Although choosing two options in the same division is discouraged, it is still possible.

First year students are enrolled in first-term classes based upon results of placement exams in math, physics, chemistry, and writing and take all classes in their first two terms on a Pass/Fail basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;fah&quot;/&gt; There is little competition; collaboration on [[homework]] is encouraged and the Honor System encourages take-home tests and flexible homework schedules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissions.caltech.edu/techers/honorcode |title=Caltech Undergraduate Admissions: Honor Code |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caltech offers co-operative programs with other schools, such as the Pasadena [[Art Center College of Design]] and [[Occidental College]].

Undergraduate tuition for the 2010–2011 school year was $34,989 and total annual costs were estimated to be $52,389.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://admissions.caltech.edu/affording/costs |title=Caltech Undergraduate Admissions: Costs |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010–2011, Caltech awarded $14.2 million in need-based aid, $940k in non-need-based aid, and $2.35 million in self-help support to every enrolled undergraduate student. The average financial aid package of all students eligible for need-based aid was $34,928 and students graduated with an average debt of $9,561.&lt;ref name=&quot;cds&quot;/&gt;

Upon graduation, Caltech alumni have the highest median starting salary among graduates of other colleges or universities in 2010-2011, of $69,900, according to [[PayScale]]. The mid-career median pay is $120,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payscale.com/best-colleges/top-us-colleges-graduate-salary-statistics.asp |title=Top US Colleges — Graduate Salary Statistics |publisher=PayScale |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caltech was found to offer the highest return of investment of college education, at $1,713,000 over a 30-year period, according to the same study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payscale.com/education/average-cost-for-college-ROI |title=Colleges Worth Your Investment - Full List |publisher=PayScale |accessdate=Apr 09, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 80% of the class of 2010 did research through the annual [http://surf.caltech.edu/ Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF)] program at least once during their stay, and many continued during the school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surf.caltech.edu/history/SURFAR2010.pdf |title=SURF Annual Report 2010 |publisher=Caltech |accessdate=Mar 08, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students write and submit SURF proposals for research projects in collaboration with professors, and about 70 percent of applicants are awarded SURFs. The program is open to both Caltech and non-Caltech undergraduate students. It serves as preparation for graduate school and helps to explain why Caltech has the highest percentage of alumni who go on to receive a PhD of all the major universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf08311/?govDel=USNSF_178http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nsf.gov%2Fstatistics%2Finfbrief%2Fnsf08311%2F%3FgovDel%3DUSNSF_178#tab2 Baccalaureate Origins of S&amp;E Doctorate Recipients]&lt;/ref&gt;

The licensing and transferring of technology to the commercial sector is managed by the Office of Technology Transfer (OTT). OTT protects and manages the intellectual property developed by faculty members, students, other researchers, and JPL technologists. Caltech receives more invention disclosures per faculty member than any other university in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ott.caltech.edu/ Caltech Office of Technology Transfer]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, 1891 patents were granted to Caltech researchers since 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/univ/org_gr/all_univ_ag.htm |title=U.S. Colleges and Universities- Utility Patent Grants, Calendar Years 1969-2008 |publisher=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office |accessdate=Jan 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== House system ===
{{Main|House System at the California Institute of Technology}}

During the early 20th century, a Caltech committee visited several universities and decided to transform the undergraduate housing system from regular [[fraternities and sororities|fraternities]] to a [[residential college|house system]]. Four south houses (or ''hovses'') were built: [[House_System_at_the_California_Institute_of_Technology#Blacker_House|Blacker House]], [[House_System_at_the_California_Institute_of_Technology#Dabney_House|Dabney House]], [[House_System_at_the_California_Institute_of_Technology#Fleming_House|Fleming House]] and [[House_System_at_the_California_Institute_of_Technology#Ricketts_House|Ricketts House]]. In the 1960s, three north houses were built: [[House_System_at_the_California_Institute_of_Technology#Lloyd_House|Lloyd House]], [[House_System_at_the_California_Institute_of_Technology#Page_House|Page House]], and [[House_System_at_the_California_Institute_of_Technology#Ruddock_House|Ruddock House]], and during the 1990s, [[House_System_at_the_California_Institute_of_Technology#Avery_House|Avery House]]. The four south houses closed for renovation in 2005 and reopened in 2006. All first year students live in the house system and 95% of undergraduates remain in it.&lt;ref name=&quot;cds&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;houses&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://admissions.caltech.edu/living/houses |title=Caltech Undergraduate Admissions: The Houses |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Athletics ===
Caltech has athletic teams in baseball, men's and women's basketball, cross country, fencing, men's soccer, swimming and diving, men's and women's tennis, track and field, women's volleyball, and men's and women's water polo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athletics.caltech.edu/ Caltech Athletics].

=== Student life traditions ===
[[Image:Beckman auditorium, Caltech.jpg|thumb|Beckman Auditorium]]

==== Annual events ====
Every [[Halloween]], Dabney House conducts the infamous &quot;Millikan pumpkin-drop experiment&quot; from the top of Millikan Library, the highest point on campus. According to tradition, a claim was once made that the shattering of a pumpkin frozen in [[liquid nitrogen]] and dropped from a sufficient height would produce a [[triboluminescence|triboluminescent]] spark. This yearly event involves a crowd of observers, who try to spot the elusive spark. The title of the event is an oblique reference to the famous [[oil-drop experiment|Millikan oil-drop experiment]] which measured ''e'', the [[elementary charge|elemental unit of electrical charge]].

On [http://pr.caltech.edu:16080/events/ditchday/2010/ Ditch Day], the seniors ditch school, leaving behind elaborately designed tasks and traps at the doors of their rooms to prevent underclassmen from entering. Over the years this has evolved to the point where many seniors spend months designing mechanical, electrical, and software obstacles to confound the underclassmen. Each group of seniors designs a &quot;stack&quot; to be solved by a handful of underclassmen. The faculty have been drawn into the event as well, and cancel all classes on Ditch Day so the underclassmen can participate in what has become a highlight of the academic year. In 2010, Ditch Day fell on May 21.

Another long-standing tradition is the playing of Wagner's ominous ''[[Ride of the Valkyries]]'' at 7:00 each morning during finals week with the largest, loudest speakers available. The playing of that piece is not allowed at any other time (except if one happens to be listening to the entire 15 hours of ''[[The Ring Cycle]]''), and any offender is dragged into the showers to be drenched in cold water fully dressed. The playing of the ''Ride'' is such a strong tradition that the music was used during [[Apollo 17]] to awaken Astronaut [[Harrison Schmitt]], a Caltech alumnus. Unfortunately, the tradition arose at different times in different Houses, so Schmitt did not react as expected. Instead, he just became confused.

==== Pranks ====
[[Image:Caltech cannon.jpg|thumb|Fleming Cannon]]

Caltech students have been known for the many [[Student prank|prank]]s (also known as &quot;RFs&quot;).

The two most famous in recent history are the changing of the [[Hollywood Sign]] to read &quot;Caltech&quot;, by judiciously covering up certain parts of the letters, and the changing of the scoreboard to read Caltech 38, MIT 9 during the [[1984 Rose Bowl|1984 Rose Bowl Game]]. But the most famous of all occurred during the [[1961 Rose Bowl|1961 Rose Bowl Game]], where Caltech students altered the flip-cards that were raised by the stadium attendees to display &quot;Caltech&quot;, and several other &quot;unintended&quot; messages. This event is now referred to as the [[Great Rose Bowl Hoax]].

In 2005, a group of Caltech students pulled a string of pranks during MIT's Campus Preview Weekend for admitted students. These include covering up the word Massachusetts in the &quot;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&quot; engraving on the main building façade with a banner so that it read &quot;That Other Institute of Technology&quot;. A group of [[Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT hackers]] responded by altering the banner so that the inscription read &quot;The Only Institute of Technology.&quot; Caltech students also passed out T-shirts to MIT's incoming freshman class, with MIT on the front and &quot;... because not everyone can go to Caltech&quot; along with an image of a palm tree on the back.

MIT retaliated in April 2006, when students posing as the Howe &amp; Ser (Howitzer) Moving Company stole the 130-year-old, 1.7-ton Fleming House cannon and moved it to their campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts for their 2006 Campus Preview Weekend, repeating a similar prank performed by nearby [[Harvey Mudd College]] in 1986. Thirty members of Fleming House traveled to MIT and reclaimed their cannon on April 10, 2006.

On April 13, 2007 (Friday the 13th), a group of students from ''The California Tech'', Caltech's campus newspaper, arrived and distributed [http://tech.caltech.edu/TECH/mit/index.html fake copies] of ''The Tech'', MIT's campus newspaper, while prospective students were visiting for their Campus Preview Weekend. Articles included &quot;MIT Invents the Interweb,&quot; &quot;Architects Deem Campus 'Unfortunate',&quot; and &quot;Infinite Corridor Not Actually Infinite.&quot;

In recent years, pranking has been officially encouraged by Tom Mannion, Caltech's Assistant VP for Student Affairs and Campus Life. &quot;The grand old days of pranking have gone away at Caltech, and that's what we are trying to bring back,&quot; reported the ''Boston Globe'', which noted that &quot;security has orders not to intervene in a prank unless officers get Mannion's approval beforehand.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate = 2007-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caltech pranks have been documented in three [http://www.legendsofcaltech.com/ Legends of Caltech] books, the most recent of which was edited by alumni Autumn Looijen '99 and Mason A. Porter '98 and published in May 2007.

In December 2009, some Caltech students declared that MIT had been sold and had become the Caltech East campus. A &quot;sold&quot; banner was hung on front of the MIT dome building and a &quot;Welcome to Caltech East: School of the Humanities&quot; banner over the Massachusetts Avenue Entrance. Newspapers and t-shirts were distributed, and door labels and fliers in the infinite corridor were put up in accordance with the &quot;curriculum change.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://east.caltech.edu/ Caltech Opens Humanities School at MIT Campus], December 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_13939751 Citybeats: Future Tournament of Roses chief vows even better parades], ''Pasadena Star-News'', December 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, MIT students attempted to put a [[TARDIS]], time machine from the BBC's [[Doctor Who]], onto a roof. Caught in midact, the prank was aborted. In January 2011, Caltech students in conjunction with MIT students helped put the TARDIS on top of Baxter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://features.caltech.edu/features/97 What's (Literally) Up with the TARDIS?], Caltech Features, January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Caltech students then moved the TARDIS to [[UC Berkeley]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Alessondra Springmann, PCWorld&quot;&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/219292/dr_whos_tardis_lands_at_mit_caltech_and_berkeley.html Dr. Who’s TARDIS Lands at MIT, Caltech, and Berkeley], by Alessondra Springmann, [[PCWorld]], Feb 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stanford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hacks.mit.edu/by_year/2010/tardis/ TARDIS on building 7, great dome, and beyond], ''IHTFP Hack Gallery'', April 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Honor Code ====
[[Image:Caltech turtles.jpg|thumb|Throop Pond]]

Life in the Caltech community is governed by the [[Honor Code]], which simply states: &quot;No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community.&quot; This is enforced by a Board of Control, which consists of undergraduate students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://donut.caltech.edu/about/boc/ug_handbook.php |title=The Honor System Handbook from the Board of Control at Caltech.edu |publisher=Donut.caltech.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by a similar body at the graduate level, called the Graduate Review Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~grb/ |title=Graduate Review Board at Caltech.edu |publisher=Its.caltech.edu |date=2009-06-10 |accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Honor Code aims at promoting an atmosphere of respect and trust that allows Caltech students to enjoy privileges that make for a more relaxed atmosphere. For example, the Honor Code allows professors to make the majority of exams as take-home, allowing students to take them on their own schedule and in their preferred environment.

Through the late 1990s, the only exception to the Honor Code, implemented earlier in the decade in response to changes in federal regulations, concerned the sexual harassment policy. Today, there are myriad exceptions to the Honor Code in the form of new institute policies such as the Fire Policy, and Alcohol Policy. Though both policies are presented in the Honor Code Handbook given to new members of the Caltech Community, large portions of the undergraduate population regard them as a slight against the Honor Code and the implicit trust and respect it represents within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

As of 2010, Caltech has 31 [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureates]] to its name. This figure includes 17 alumni, 14 non-alumni professors, and 4 professors who are also alumni ([[Carl D. Anderson]], [[Linus Pauling]], [[William A. Fowler]], and [[Edward B. Lewis]]). The number of awards is 32, because Pauling received prizes in both [[Chemistry]] and [[Peace]]. With fewer than 25,000 alumni in total, more than one in 1,400 have received the Nobel Prize&amp;nbsp;— a ratio unmatched by any other university. Six faculty and alumni have received a [[Crafoord Prize]] from the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], while 55 have been awarded the U.S. [[National Medal of Science]], and 12 have received the [[National Medal of Technology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;at a glance&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://today.caltech.edu/today/story-display?story%5fid=47485 |title=Yariv Awarded National Medal of Science |date=October 2010 |publisher=Caltech Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; One alumnus, [[Stanislav Smirnov]], won the [[Fields Medal]] in 2010. Other distinguished researchers have been affiliated with Caltech as postdoctoral scholars (for example,, [[Barbara McClintock]], [[James D. Watson]] and [[Sheldon Glashow]]) or visiting professors (for example,, [[Albert Einstein]], [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Edward Witten]]).

Caltech enrolled 967 undergraduate students and 1208 graduate students for the 2010–2011 school year. Women made up 40% of the undergraduate and 29% of the graduate student body.&lt;ref name=&quot;at a glance&quot;/&gt; 66% of non-international freshmen are from out of state. Caltech received 4,859 applications for the Class of 2014: 610 were admitted (12.6%) and 222 of them enrolled. The [[interquartile range]] for first year students' [[SAT]] scores was 2200 to 2330. 98% of students were ranked in the top tenth of their high school graduating class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissions.caltech.edu/applying/profile |title=2010 Incoming Class Profile  |publisher=Caltech |accessdate=2010-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four-year graduation rate is 80.7% and the six-year rate is 90.3%,&lt;ref name=&quot;cds&quot;/&gt; which is low compared to most leading U.S. universities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/highest-grad-rate |title=Best Colleges: Highest graduation rates |journal=US News &amp; World Report |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but substantially higher than it was in the 1960s and 70s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842975-2,00.html |title=Universities: Caltech &amp; M.I.T.: Rivalry Between the Best |journal=Time  |accessdate=May 28, 2010 | date=November 4, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students majoring in [[STEM fields]] traditionally have graduation rates below 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heri.ucla.edu/nih/HERI_ResearchBrief_OL_2010_STEM.pdf |title=Degrees of Success: Bachelor's Degree Completion Rates among Initial STEM Majors |date=January 2010 |publisher=Higher Education Research Institute, University of California, Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faculty and staff===
[[Richard Feynman]] was perhaps the most well-known faculty to be associated with Caltech, having published the ''[[Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'', an undergraduate physics text, and a few other popular science texts such as ''[[Six_Easy_Pieces#Six_Easy_Pieces_.281994.29|Six Easy Pieces]]'' for the general audience. The promotion of physics made him a public figure of science, although his Nobel-winning work in [[quantum electrodynamics]] was already very established in the scientific community. [[Murray Gell-Mann]], a Nobel-winning physicist, introduced a classification of [[hadrons]] and went on to postulate the existence of [[quarks]], which is currently accepted as part of the [[Standard Model]]. [[Linus Pauling]] pioneered [[quantum chemistry]] and [[molecular biology]], and he went on to solve for the nature of the chemical bond in 1939. In engineering, [[Theodore von Kármán]] made many key advances in aerodynamics, notably his work on [[supersonic]] and [[hypersonic]] airflow characterization. A repeating pattern of swirling [[vortices]] is named after him, the [[von Kármán vortex street]]. More recently, [[Michael E. Brown|Michael Brown]], a professor of planetary astronomy, discovered many [[trans-Neptunian object]]s, most notably the [[dwarf planet]] [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], which prompted the [[International Astronomical Union]] to redefine the term &quot;[[planet]]&quot;.

[[David Baltimore]], the Robert A. Millikan Professor of Biology, and [[Alice S. Huang|Alice Huang]], Senior Faculty Associate in Biology, have served as the President of [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] from 2007–2008 and 2010-2011 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.aaas.org/people/plist.php?type=President |title=AAAS Presidents |publisher=AAAS |year=2011 |accessdate=Jan 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

33 percent of the faculty are members of the [[National Academy of Science]] or [[National Academy of Engineering|Engineering]] and/or fellows of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. This is the highest percentage of any faculty in the country with the exception of the graduate institution [[Rockefeller University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissions.caltech.edu/learning/faculty |title=Faculty |publisher=Caltech |year=2010 |accessdate=Jan 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average salary for assistant professors at Caltech is $105,800, associate professors $126,000, and full professors $171,900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/stats/aaup/index.php?action=detail&amp;id=226 |title=AAUP Faculty Salary Survey |publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education |year=2010 |accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caltech faculty are highly productive in the fields of applied physics, astronomy and astrophysics, biology, biochemistry, biological engineering, chemical engineering, computer science, geology, mechanical engineering and physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/stats/productivity/page.php?year=2007&amp;institution=226&amp;byinst=Go |title=Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index - California Institute of Technology |publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education |year=2007 |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alumni===
17 alumni and 14 non-alumni faculty have won the [[Nobel Prize]]. The [[Turing Award]], the &quot;Nobel Prize of Computer Science&quot;, has been awarded to six alumni, and one has won the [[Fields Medal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;science_now&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/08/fields-medals-other-top-math-pri.html|title=Fields Medals, Other Top Math Prizes, Awarded|last=Cipra|first=Barry|date=19 August 2010|work=Science Now|publisher=[[AAAS]]|accessdate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alumni have participated in scientific research. Some have concentrated their studies on the very small universe of atoms and molecules. [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Carl D. Anderson]] (BS 1927, PhD 1930) proved the existence of [[positron]]s and [[muon]]s, Nobel laureate [[Edwin McMillan]] (BS 1928, MS 1929) synthesized the first [[transuranium element]], Nobel laureate [[Leo James Rainwater]] (BS 1939) investigated the non-spherical shapes of atomic nuclei, and Nobel laureate [[Douglas D. Osheroff]] (BS 1967) studied the [[superfluid]] nature of [[helium-3]].

Other alumni have turned their gaze to the universe. [[C. Gordon Fullerton]] (BS 1957, MS 1958) piloted the third [[space shuttle]] mission and orbited the earth in [[Skylab]]. Astronaut (and later, [[United States Senator]]) [[Harrison Schmitt]] (BS 1957) was the only [[geologist]] to have ever walked on the surface of the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/About/AstroHistory/schmitt.html|title=USGS Astrogeology: Astronaut Harrison H. Schmitt|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] - Astrogeology Program|author=Deborah Lee Soltesz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomer [[Eugene Merle Shoemaker]] (BS 1947, MS 1948) co-discovered [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] (a comet which crashed into the planet [[Jupiter]]) and was the first person buried on the moon (by having his ashes crashed into the moon).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In 1998, Celestis, at the request of NASA, provided a Luna Flight Capsule to the family and friends of the late legendary astronomer and planetary geologist Eugene Shoemaker. The Celestis Flight Capsule, containing a symbolic portion of Shoemaker's cremated remains, was attached to NASA's Lunar Prospector spacecraft and launched on a one-year mission orbiting the moon. On July 31, 1999, at the completion of Lunar Prospector's mission, the spacecraft was intentionally crashed into the moon's south pole, making Shoemaker the first human to be laid to rest on another celestial body. NASA called the memorial &quot;a special honor for a special human being.&quot;&quot;{{cite web|publisher=[[Space.com]]|url=http://www.space.com/news/080328-moon-burial.html|title=Fly Me to the Moon...Forever|date=2008-03-28|author=Clara Moskowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arnold Orville Beckman|Arnold Beckman]] (PhD 1928) invented the [[pH meter]] and commecialized it with the founding of [[Beckman Instruments]].

Caltech has appeared in several works of popular culture, both as itself and in disguised form. [[MIT in popular culture|As with MIT]], a Caltech reference is often used to establish a character's high level of intelligence or a technical background. For example, on television, the four male lead characters of the sitcom ''[[The Big Bang Theory (TV series)|The Big Bang Theory]]'' are all employed at the Institute. Caltech is also the inspiration, and frequent film location, for the California Institute of Science of ''[[Numb3rs]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;realgenius&quot;&gt;[http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~erich/real_genius_refs.html Caltech References in &quot;Real Genius&quot;].

The '''Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event''', which occurred approximately 65.5 million years ago ([[Annum#SI_prefix_multipliers|Ma]]) at the end of the [[Maastrichtian (geological period)|Maastrichtian]], was a large-scale [[extinction event|mass extinction]] of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time. Widely known as the '''K–T extinction event''', it is associated with a geological signature known as the [[K–T boundary]], usually a thin band of sedimentation found in various parts of the world. ''K'' is the traditional abbreviation for the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] derived from the German name ''Kreidezeit'', and ''T'' is the abbreviation for the [[Tertiary]] Period (a historical term for the period of time now covered by the [[Paleogene]] and [[Neogene]] periods). The event marks the end of the [[Mesozoic]] Era and the beginning of the [[Cenozoic]] Era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortey&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Fortey|first= R |title=Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth |publisher=Vintage |year=1999 |pages=238–260 |isbn=978-0-375-70261-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; With &quot;Tertiary&quot; being discouraged as a formal time or rock unit by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]], the K–T event is now called the '''Cretaceous–Paleogene''' (or '''K–Pg''') '''extinction event''' by many researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Mammals|Mammalian]] [[clade]]s passed through the boundary with few extinctions, and [[evolutionary radiation]] from those Maastrichtian clades occurred well past the boundary.  Rates of extinction and radiation varied across different clades of organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=MacLeod N, Rawson PF, Forey PL, Banner FT, Boudagher-Fadel MK, Bown PR, Burnett JA, Chambers, P, Culver S, Evans SE, Jeffery C, Kaminski MA, Lord AR, Milner AC, Milner AR, Morris N, Owen E, Rosen BR, Smith AB, Taylor PD, Urquhart E, Young JR |title=The Cretaceous–Tertiary biotic transition |year=1997 |journal=Journal of the Geological Society |volume=154 |issue=2 |pages=265–292 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3721/is_199703/ai_n8738406/print |doi=10.1144/gsjgs.154.2.0265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists [[Scientific method|theorize]] that the K–T extinctions were caused by one or more catastrophic events, such as massive [[impact event|asteroid impact]](s) (like the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub impact]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Schulte10&quot; &gt;{{Cite doi|10.1126/science.1177265}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or increased [[volcano|volcanic activity]].  Several [[impact craters]] and massive volcanic activity, such as that in the [[Deccan traps]], have been dated to the approximate time of the extinction event. These geological events may have reduced sunlight and hindered [[photosynthesis]], leading to a massive disruption in Earth's [[ecology]].  Other researchers believe the extinction was more gradual, resulting from slower changes in sea level or climate.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;

==Extinction patterns==
{{annotated image/Extinction|float=left}}
Even though the boundary event was severe, there was significant variability in the rate of extinction between and within different [[clade]]s. Species that depended on [[photosynthesis]] declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked sunlight and reduced the [[solar energy]] reaching the Earth's surface. This plant extinction caused a major reshuffling of the dominant plant groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated347&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilf P, Johnson KR |title=Land plant extinction at the end of the Cretaceous: a quantitative analysis of the North Dakota megafloral record |journal=Paleobiology |year=2004 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=347–368 |doi = 10.1666/0094-8373(2004)030&lt;0347:LPEATE&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photosynthesizing organisms, including [[phytoplankton]] and land plants, formed the foundation of the [[food chain]] in the late Cretaceous as they do today.  Evidence suggests that [[herbivores|herbivorous]] animals died out when the plants on which they depended for food became scarce. Consequently, top [[predator]]s such as ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' also perished.

[[Coccolithophorids]] and [[mollusc]]s (including [[ammonite]]s, [[rudist]]s, freshwater [[snail]]s and [[mussel]]s, and those organisms whose [[food chain]] included these shell builders) became extinct or suffered heavy losses. For example, it is thought that ammonites were the principal food of [[mosasaur]]s, a group of giant marine [[reptiles]] that became extinct at the boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kauffman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author =Kauffman E| authorlink =| title =Mosasaur Predation on Upper Cretaceous Nautiloids and Ammonites from the United States Pacific Coast | journal =PALAIOS | volume =19 | issue =1 | pages =96–100 | publisher =Society for Sedimentary Geology |  url=http://palaios.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/reprint/19/1/96

[[Omnivores]], [[insectivores]] and [[carrion]]-eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. At the end of the Cretaceous there seem to have been no purely herbivorous or [[carnivore|carnivorous]] mammals. Mammals and birds that survived the extinction fed on [[insect]]s, [[worm]]s, and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists hypothesize that these organisms survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on [[detritus (biology)|detritus]] (non-living organic material).&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SheehanHansen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Sheehan Peter M, Hansen Thor A | title =Detritus feeding as a buffer to extinction at the end of the Cretaceous | journal =Geology | volume =14 |issue =10| pages =868–870| year =1986| url =http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/10/868| doi =10.1130/0091-7613(1986)14&lt;868:DFAABT&gt;2.0.CO;2|accessdate =2007-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Faunal evidence for reduced productivity and uncoordinated recovery in Southern Hemisphere Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary sections|author=Aberhan M, Weidemeyer S, Kieesling W, Scasso RA, Medina FA |year=2007 |journal=Geology |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=227–230 |doi=10.1130/G23197A.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[stream]] [[Biocoenosis|communities]] few animal groups became extinct because stream communities rely less directly on food from living plants and more on detritus that washes in from land, buffering them from extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Major extinctions of land-dwelling vertebrates at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary, eastern Montana |author=Sheehan Peter M, Fastovsky DE |year=1992 |journal=Geology |volume=20 |issue=6 | pages=556–560 |url=http://www.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/georef/1992034409 |accessdate=2007-06-22 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1992)020&lt;0556:MEOLDV&gt;2.3.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar, but more complex patterns have been found in the oceans. Extinction was more severe among animals living in the [[Pelagic zone|water column]] than among animals living on or in the sea floor. Animals in the water column are almost entirely dependent on [[primary production]] from living phytoplankton while animals living on or in the [[ocean floor]] feed on detritus or can switch to detritus feeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;

The largest air-breathing survivors of the event, [[crocodyliform]]s and [[Choristodera|champsosaurs]], were semi-aquatic and had access to detritus. Modern crocodilians can live as scavengers and can survive for months without food, and their young are small, grow slowly, and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms or fragments of organisms for their first few years. These characteristics have been linked to crocodilian survival at the end of the Cretaceous.&lt;ref name=&quot;SheehanHansen&quot;/&gt;

After the K–T event, biodiversity required substantial time to recover, despite the existence of abundant vacant [[ecological niche]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;

===Microbiota===
The K–T boundary represents one of the most dramatic turnovers in the [[fossil record]] for various [[calcareous]] [[nanoplankton]] that formed the [[calcium]] deposits that gave the Cretaceous its name.  The turnover in this group is clearly marked at the species level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pospichal JJ |title=Calcareous nannofossils and clastic sediments at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary, northeastern Mexico |year=1996 |journal=Geology |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=255–258 |url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/3/255 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;0255:CNACSA&gt;2.3.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bown P |year=2005 |title=Selective calcareous nannoplankton survivorship at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary |journal=Geology |volume=33 |issue=8 |pages=653–656 |url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/8/653 | doi =10.1130/G21566.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistical analysis of [[marine (ocean)|marine]] losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a sharp increase in extinctions than by a decrease in [[speciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Bambach RK, Knoll AH, Wang SC | title=Origination, extinction, and mass depletions of marine diversity | journal=Paleobiology | volume=30 | issue=4 | pages=522–542 | year=2004 |doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2004)030&lt;0522:OEAMDO&gt;2.0.CO;2 |url=http://paleobiol.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/30/4/522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The K–T boundary record of [[dinoflagellate]]s is not as well-understood, mainly because only [[microbial cyst]]s provide a fossil record, and not all dinoflagellate species have cyst-forming stages, thereby likely causing diversity to be underestimated.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;  Recent studies indicate that there were no major shifts in dinoflagellates through the boundary layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gedl P |title=Dinoflagellate cyst record of the deep-sea Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary at Uzgru, Carpathian Mountains, Czech Republic |journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications |year=2004 |volume=230 |pages=257–273 |doi=10.1144/GSL.SP.2004.230.01.13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radiolaria]] have left a geological record since at least the [[Ordovician]] times, and their mineral fossil skeletons can be tracked across the K–T boundary.  There is no evidence of mass extinction of these organisms, and there is support for high productivity of these species in [[Antarctic Circle|Southern high latitudes]] as a result of cooling temperatures in the early Paleocene.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;  Approximately 46% of [[diatom]] species survived the transition from the Cretaceous to the Upper [[Paleocene]].

Numerous species of [[benthic]] foraminifera became extinct during the K–T event, presumably because they depend on organic debris for nutrients, since the [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in the ocean is thought to have decreased.  However, as the marine microbiota recovered, it is thought that increased speciation of benthic foraminifera resulted from the increase in food sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;  Phytoplankton recovery in the early Paleocene provided the food source to support large benthic foraminiferal assemblages, which are mainly detritus-feeding.  Ultimate recovery of the benthic populations occurred over several stages lasting several hundred thousand years into the early Paleocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Deep-sea benthic foraminiferal recolonisation following a volcaniclastic event in the lower Campanian of the Scaglia Rossa Formation (Umbria-Marche Basin, central Italy)|url=http://www.es.ucl.ac.uk/people/m-kaminski/reprints-pdfs/Galeotti_etal2002.pdf |format=PDF|author=Galeotti S, Bellagamba M, Kaminski MA, and Montanari A |year=2002 |journal=Marine Micropaleontology |volume=44 |pages=57–76 |accessdate=2007-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=8.

===Marine invertebrates===

[[Image:Amonites.Domus da Coruña.jpg|thumb|An [[ammonite]] fossil]]

There is variability in the fossil record as to the extinction rate of [[marine invertebrates]] across the K–T boundary.  The apparent rate is influenced by the lack of fossil records rather than actual extinction.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;

[[Ostracodes]], a class of small [[crustaceans]] that were prevalent in the upper Maastrichtian, left fossil deposits in a variety of locations. A review of these fossils shows that ostracode diversity was lower in the Paleocene than any other time in the Tertiary. However, current research cannot ascertain whether the extinctions occurred prior to or during the boundary interval itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coles|first= GP|coauthors=Ayress MA, and Whatley RC |year=1990 |title=A comparison of North Atlantic and 20 Pacific deep-sea Ostracoda in Ostracoda and global events (RC Whatley and C Maybury, editors) |pages=287–305 |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |isbn=978-0-442-31167-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Late Maastrichtian and Danian Ostracode Faunas from Northern Alaska: Reconstructions of Environment and Paleogeography |author=Brouwers EM, De Deckker P |year=1993 |journal=PALAIOS |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=140–154 |doi=10.2307/3515168 |url=http://jstor.org/stable/3515168 |publisher=PALAIOS, Vol. 8, No. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 60% of late-Cretaceous [[Scleractinia]] [[coral]] genera failed to cross the K–T boundary into the Paleocene. Further analysis of the coral extinctions shows that approximately 98% of colonial species, ones that inhabit warm, shallow [[tropical]] waters, became extinct. The solitary corals, which generally do not form reefs and inhabit colder and deeper (below the [[photic zone]]) areas of the ocean were less impacted by the K–T boundary. Colonial coral species rely upon [[symbiosis]] with photosynthetic [[algae]], which collapsed due to the events surrounding the K–T boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vescsei A, Moussavian E |title=Paleocene reefs on the Maiella Platform Margin, Italy: An example of the effects of the cretaceous/tertiary boundary events on reefs and carbonate platforms |year=1997 |journal=Facies |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=123–139 |doi=10.1007/BF02536880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rosen BR, Turnsek D|year=1989 |title=Extinction patterns and biogeography of scleractinian corals across the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary.

The numbers of [[cephalopod]], [[echinoderm]], and [[bivalve]] genera exhibited significant diminution after the K–T boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt; Most species of [[brachiopods]], a small [[phylum]] of marine invertebrates, survived the K–T event and diversified during the early Paleocene.

Except for [[nautiloid]]s (represented by the modern order [[Nautilida]]) and [[coleoid]]s (which had already [[Genetic divergence|diverged]] into modern [[octopus|octopodes]], [[squid]]s, and [[cuttlefish]]) all other species of the [[mollusca]]n class [[Cephalopoda]] became extinct at the K–T boundary. These included the ecologically significant [[belemnoidea|belemnoids]], as well as the [[ammonoids]], a group of highly diverse, numerous, and widely distributed shelled cephalopods. Researchers have pointed out that the reproductive strategy of the surviving nautiloids, which rely upon few and larger eggs, played a role in outsurviving their ammonoid counterparts through the extinction event. The ammonoids utilized a planktonic strategy of reproduction (numerous eggs and planktonic larvae), which would have been devastated by the K–T boundary event. Additional research has shown that subsequent to this elimination of ammonoids from the global biota, nautiloids began an evolutionary radiation into shell shapes and complexities theretofore known only from ammonoids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ward PD, Kennedy WJ, MacLeod KG, Mount JF |year=1991 |title=Ammonite and inoceramid bivalve extinction patterns in Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary sections of the Biscay region (southwestern France, northern Spain) |journal=Geology |volume=19 |issue=12 |pages=1181–1184 |url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/12/1181 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1991)019&lt;1181:AAIBEP&gt;2.3.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harries PJ, Johnson KR, Cobban WA, Nichols DJ |year=2002 |title=Marine Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary section in southwestern South Dakota: Comment and Reply |journal=Geology |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=954–955 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(2002)030&lt;0955:MCTBSI&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 35% of [[echinoderm]] genera became extinct at the K–T boundary, although [[taxon|taxa]] that thrived in low-latitude, shallow-water environments during late Cretaceous had the highest extinction rate. Mid-latitude, deep-water echinoderms were much less affected at the K–T boundary.

===Fish===
There are substantial fossil records of [[Gnathostomata|jawed]] [[fish]]es across the K–T boundary, which provides good evidence of extinction patterns of these classes of marine vertebrates. Within [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]], approximately 80% of the [[shark]]s, [[Rajiformes|rays]], and [[skate]]s families survived the extinction event,&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt; and  more than 90% of [[teleostei|teleost fish]] (bony fish) families survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Patterson|first=C |year=1993 |title=Osteichthyes: Teleostei.

===Terrestrial invertebrates===
[[Insect]] damage to the fossilized leaves of [[flowering plant]]s from  fourteen sites in North America were used as a proxy for insect diversity across the K–T boundary and analyzed to determine the rate of extinction.  Researchers found that Cretaceous sites, prior to the extinction event, had rich plant and insect-feeding diversity.  However, during the early Paleocene, flora were relatively diverse with little predation from insects, even 1.7&amp;nbsp;million years after the extinction event.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labandieraetal&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author =Labandeira Conrad C, Johnson Kirk R, Wilf Peter | title =Impact of the terminal Cretaceous event on plant–insect associations| journal =Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America| volume =99| issue =4| pages =2061–2066| year =2002| url =http://www.geosc.psu.edu/~pwilf/LabandeiraJohnsonWilf%202002PNAS.pdf| format=PDF

Due to the wholesale destruction of plants at the K–T boundary there was a proliferation of [[saprotrophic]] organisms such as [[fungus|fungi]] that do not require [[photosynthesis]] and use nutrients from decaying vegetation. The dominance of fungal species lasted only a few years while the atmosphere cleared and there was plenty of organic matter to feed on. Once the atmosphere cleared, photosynthetic organisms like ferns and other plants returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vajda V, McLoughlin S |year=2004 |title=Fungal Proliferation at the Cretaceous–Tertiary Boundary |journal=Science |url=http://www.geol.lu.se/personal/VIV/Vajda%20&amp;McLoughlin%202004.pdf |format=PDF |volume=303 |pages=1489–1490 |doi=10.1126/science.1093807 |accessdate=2007-07-07 |pmid=15001770 |issue=5663}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Polyploidy]] appears to have enhanced the ability of flowering plants to survive the extinction, probably because the additional copies of the genome such plants possessed allowed them to more readily adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions which followed the impact.&lt;ref name='Fawcett2009'&gt;{{cite doi | 10.1073/pnas.0900906106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amphibians===

There is no evidence of K–T boundary mass extinctions of [[amphibian]]s, and there is strong evidence that most amphibians survived the event relatively unscathed.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;  Several in-depth studies of [[salamander]] genera in fossil beds in [[Montana]] show that six of seven genera were unchanged after the event.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archibald&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Archibald JD, Bryant LJ |year=1990 |title=Differential Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction of nonmarine vertebrates; evidence from northeastern Montana.

[[Frog]] species appear to have survived into the [[Paleocene]] with few species becoming extinct. However, the fossil record for frog families and genera is uneven.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;  An extensive survey of three genera of frogs in Montana show that they were unaffected by the K–T event and survived apparently unchanged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archibald&quot;/&gt;  The data show little or no evidence for extinction of amphibian families that bracket the K–T event.  Amphibian survival resulted from the clade's ability to seek shelter in water or to build burrows in sediments, soil, wood, or beneath rocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robertson&quot;/&gt;

===Non-archosaur reptiles===

The two living non-[[archosaur]]ian reptile taxa, [[testudines]] (turtles) and [[lepidosaur]]s ([[snake]]s, [[lizard]]s, and [[Amphisbaenia|worm lizards]]), along with [[choristodere]]s (semi-aquatic [[archosauromorph]]s which died out in the early [[Miocene]]), survived through the K–T boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;  Over 80% of Cretaceous turtle species passed through the K–T boundary.  Additionally, all six turtle families in existence at the end of the Cretaceous survived into the Tertiary and are represented by current species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Novacek&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=100&amp;nbsp;Million Years of Land Vertebrate Evolution: The Cretaceous-Early Tertiary Transition |author=Novacek MJ |journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden |volume=86 |issue=2 |year=1999 |pages=230–258 |doi=10.2307/2666178 |url=http://jstor.org/stable/2666178 |publisher=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden, Vol. 86, No. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Living lepidosaurs include [[Rhynchocephalia]] ([[tuatara]]s) and [[Squamata]]. The Rhynchocephalia were a widespread and relatively successful group of lepidosaurs in the early Mesozoic, but began to decline by the mid-Cretaceous. They are represented today by a single genus located exclusively in [[Biodiversity of New Zealand|New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lutz|first=D |year=2005 |title = Tuatara: A Living Fossil |publisher=DIMI Press |isbn=0-931625-43-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The order Squamata, which is represented today by lizards, snakes, and amphisbaenia, radiated into various ecological niches during the [[Jurassic]] and were successful throughout the Cretaceous. They survived through the K–T boundary and are currently the most successful and diverse group of living reptiles with more than 6,000 extant species. No known family of terrestrial squamates became extinct at the boundary, and fossil evidence indicates they did not suffer any significant decline in numbers. Their small size, adaptable metabolism, and ability to move to more favorable habitats were key factors in their survivability during the late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Novacek&quot;/&gt;

Non-archosaurian marine reptiles including [[mosasaur]]s and [[plesiosaur]]s, giant aquatic reptiles that were the top marine predators, became extinct by the end of the Cretaceous.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChatterjeeSmall&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Chatterjee S, Small BJ | title =New plesiosaurs from the Upper Cretaceous of Antarctica| journal =Geological Society, London, Special Publications| volume =47| issue =| pages =197–215| year =1989| url =http://sp.lyellcollection.org/cgi/content/abstract/47/1/197

The [[archosaur]] clade includes two living orders, [[crocodilia]]ns (of which [[Alligatoridae]], [[Cr
