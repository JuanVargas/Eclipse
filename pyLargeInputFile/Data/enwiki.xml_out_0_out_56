For instance, the archives hold decades of working scripts for university stage performances.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accreditation===
Bob Jones, Sr. was leery of academic accreditation almost from the founding of the college, and by the early 1930s, he had publicly stated his opposition to holding membership in a regional accrediting association. Not surprisingly, Jones and the college were criticized for this stance, and academic recognition, as well as student and faculty recruitment, were hindered.&lt;ref name=p68&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1944, Jones wrote to [[John Walvoord]] of [[Dallas Theological Seminary]] that while the university had &quot;no objection to educational work highly standardized….We, however, cannot conscientiously let some group of educational experts or some committee of experts who may have a behavioristic or atheistic slant on education control or even influence the administrative policies of our college.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Jones to Walwoord, May 8, 1944 in {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=354–355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, Jones reflected that “it cost us something to stay out of an association, but we stayed out. We have lived up to our convictions.”&lt;ref&gt;Jones to James O. Buswell, May 12, 1949, in {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, lack of accreditation seems to have made little difference during the post-war period, when the university more than doubled in size.&lt;ref name=p68/&gt;

Because graduates did not have the benefit of accredited degrees, the faculty felt an increased responsibility to prepare their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the history of the college, there had been some hesitancy on the part of other institutions to accept BJC credits at face value, but by the 1960s, BJU alumni were being accepted by most of the major graduate and professional schools in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;BJU's reputation in academic circles gradually became more respected for the intellectual preparation and strong character of its graduates. By the 1960s several graduate schools actively courted university alumni, and BJU graduates were accepted into most of the major graduate programs in the country despite the school's opposition to regional accreditation.&quot; {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=203, 353–355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undoubtedly helpful was that some of the university’s strongest programs were in the areas of music, speech, and art, disciplines in which ability could be measured by audition or portfolio rather than through paper qualifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Collins 2007&quot;&gt;Michael Collins, &quot;Accreditation at Bob Jones University&quot; (2007), unpublished paper, Bob Jones University Archives, Mack Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 2000s, however, the university quietly reexamined its position on accreditation as [[degree mills]] proliferated and various government bureaucracies, such as law enforcement agencies, began excluding BJU graduates on the grounds that the university did not appear on appropriate federal lists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Collins 2007&quot;/&gt; In 2004, the university began the process of joining the [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]]. Candidate status—effectively, accreditation—was obtained in April 2005, and full membership in the Association was conferred in November 2006. Because TRACS grants accreditation only to evangelical Christian institutions of higher learning, the administration believed that the university could obtain the benefits of accreditation without losing its academic independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/accreditation.html BJU press release announcing accreditation by TRACS]&lt;/ref&gt; BJU is also a founding member of the [[American Association of Christian Colleges and Seminaries]], a small group of institutions &quot;clearly identified with the historic Christian fundamentalist tradition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaccs.info/members.asp American Association of Christian Colleges and Seminaries]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unusual Films===
Both [[Bob Jones, Sr.]] and [[Bob Jones, Jr.]] believed that [[film]] could be an excellent medium for mass evangelism, and in 1950, the university established Unusual Films within the School of Fine Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=196–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The studio name derives from a former BJU promotional slogan, &quot;The World's Most Unusual University&quot;.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Jones, Jr.]] selected a speech teacher, Katherine Stenholm, as the first director. Although she had no experience in cinema, she took summer courses at the [[University of Southern California]] and received personal instruction from Hollywood specialists, such as [[Rudolph Sternad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=196–199}}; [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0827889/ biographical information on Sternad]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual Films has produced seven feature-length films: ''Wine of Morning'', ''Red Runs the River'', ''Flame in the Wind'', ''Sheffey'', ''Beyond the Night'', ''The Printing'', and ''Milltown Pride''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjupress.com/nav/category/Unusual%20Films%20Productions?parent_category_rn=281459 List of movies produced by Unusual Films]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wine of Morning'' (1955), based on a novel by Bob Jones, Jr., represented the United States at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Wine of Morning'' was selected by the University Film Producers Association to represent the United States at the International Congress of Motion Picture and Television Schools in Cannes, France, and following a showing at the Congress, garnered praise from the international film community. ''Wine of Morning'' was also awarded four 'Christian Oscars' from the National Evangelical Film Foundation for Best Film, Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Producer.&quot; {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=198}}. There may have been some [[Cold War]] posturing involved in the nomination of this film. The president of the UFPA wrote to Stenholm that the &quot;excellence of your production, ''Wine of Morning''...will provide the high quality which it is desirable to use in these international showings. We feel that the contrast between your film with its religious background and [the Russian entry] would be most revealing and that the contrast would reflect credit on our way of life.&quot; (&quot;Bob Jones Religious Film To Represent US Colleges,&quot; ''The (Columbia, SC) State'', May 2, 1958, 12C).&lt;/ref&gt; The first four films are historical dramas set, respectively, in the time of Christ, the U.S. Civil War, sixteenth-century Spain, and the late nineteenth-century South—the latter a fictionalized treatment of the life of Methodist evangelist, [[Robert Sheffey|Robert Sayers Sheffey]]. ''Beyond the Night'' closely follows an actual twentieth-century missionary saga in Central Africa, and ''The Printing'' uses composite characters to portray the persecution of believers in the former [[Soviet Union]]. All the films have an evangelistic emphasis, and curiously, [[Bob Jones, Jr.]] plays villains in four of them. For twenty years Unusual Films emphasized children's films and video production&lt;ref&gt;List of recent films on the [http://protect.bju.edu/cstore/index.php?p=product&amp;id=382&amp;parent=183 BJU website].&lt;/ref&gt; before, in 2011, it released [http://www.milltownpride.com ''Milltown Pride''], a [[feature film|feature-length film]] set in [[1920s]] [[Upstate South Carolina]]. 

Unusual Films also maintains a student film production program. Freshmen shoot and edit a project shot on [[16mm]] [[Transparency (photography)|reversal]] black-and-white film. Sophomores are also required to write and direct such a project. Before graduation, seniors produce a sizable project on 16&amp;nbsp;mm color negative film. Nevertheless, basic photography and video production are an integral part of the BJU cinema major.&lt;ref&gt;BJU Catalog, 2007–08, 156, 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

===BJU Press===
{{main|BJU Press}}
[[BJU Press]] originated in the need for textbooks for the burgeoning [[Christian school]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=236, 264}}&lt;/ref&gt; and today it is the largest book publisher in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=264–267}} Although it published its first trade book, a history of fundamentalism, in 1973, its first text was George Mulfinger and Emmet Williams, ''Physical Science for Christian Schools'' published in 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; The Press publishes a full range of K-12 textbooks. More than a million pre-college students around the world use BJU textbooks, and the Press has approximately 2,500 titles in print. 

BJU Press also offers [http://www.bjupresshomeschool.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/category_Distance-Learning____23702_23702_Y distance learning courses] via online, DVD, and hard drive.&lt;ref&gt;Until May 2009, [[BJU Press]] offered elementary and high school classes via satellite over the BJ HomeSat Network and BJ LINC (Live Interactive Network Classroom), an interactive satellite system that allowed a teacher in Greenville to communicate with [[Christian school]] students across the country. In 2006, about 45,000 students participated in BJU's distance-learning programs.{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=264–266}}; ''Greenville News'', 20 September 2006, 9A; ''BJU Catalog'', 2007-08, 329.&lt;/ref&gt; Another ancillary, the Academy of Home Education, is a &quot;service organization for homeschooling families,&quot; that maintains student records, administers achievement testing, and issues high school diplomas.

==Controversies==
===Religious===
====Billy Graham====
[[Image:Billy Graham bw photo, April 11, 1966.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]], 1966]]
One of the earliest controversies to center on BJU was the break that occurred in the late 1950s between separatist fundamentalists and [[neo-evangelical]]s represented by the newly prominent evangelist [[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]]. Graham had briefly attended Bob Jones College, and the university conferred an honorary degree on him in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s, however, Graham began distancing himself from the older fundamentalism, and in preparation for his 1957 New York Crusade, he sought broad ecumenical sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=171–181}} &quot;The Protestant Council leadership was made up largely of clergy who denied the virgin birth of Christ, His deity, His bodily resurrection from the dead...and virtually every other historic Christian doctrine for which Bob Jones, Sr., his university, and other Fundamentalist leaders had fought....To further increase the breadth of his appeal, Graham began to accept invitations to speak at liberal seminaries in the Northeast—Union, Colgate, and other centers of American Modernism.&quot; (174) William Martin, ''A Prophet with Honor: The Billy Graham Story'' (New York: William Morrow, 1991), 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bob Jones, Sr. argued that if members of Graham’s campaign executive committee had rejected major tenets of orthodox Christianity, such as the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] and the deity of Christ, then Graham had violated 2 John 9-11, which prohibits receiving in fellowship those who do “not abide in the teaching of Christ.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, Graham further irritated fundamentalists by gaining the endorsement of Cardinal [[Richard Cushing]] for his Boston campaign and accepting honorary degrees from two Roman Catholic colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham tried to remain above the fray,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;When Billy Graham arrived in Greenville for the March 1966 crusade, he issued a statement to the Greenville newspapers saying he really did not know what accounted for the split between him and Bob Jones University.&quot; {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; but members of his staff openly accused Jones of jealousy on the grounds that Jones’s evangelistic meetings had never been as large as Graham’s.&lt;ref&gt;Graham associate T. W. Wilson, who had attended BJC, wrote Bob Jones, Sr., &quot;What is the matter? Many times I have heard you say, 'I have preached to more people than any man in America.' Now that you can say this no longer, could it be that you have actually let the green-eyed old Monster of Jealousy creep into your heart?&quot; Wilson to Jones, May 21, 1957, quoted in {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham’s father-in-law, [[L. Nelson Bell]], mailed a fiery ten-page letter to most members of the BJU faculty and student body (as well as to thousands of pastors across the country) accusing Jones of “hatred, distortions, jealousies, envying, malice, false witnessing, and untruthfulness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In what seemed to the Joneses to be a deliberate affront, Graham held his only American campaign of 1966 in Greenville, South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=183}} Graham had only three campaigns scheduled that year: London, Berlin, and Greenville, South Carolina.&lt;/ref&gt; Under penalty of expulsion, the university forbade any BJU dormitory student from attending the Graham meetings.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;No Bob Jones University dormitory student will be permitted to go to a single meeting of the Greenville crusade. No Bob Jones University adult student, if he is married or lives in town, may attend the crusade and remain as a student.&quot; [[Bob Jones, Jr.]], Chapel talk, February 8, 1965, Mack Library Archives, quoted in {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=184}}. An exception was made for Bob Jones Academy students who lived in town with their parents.&lt;/ref&gt; In a four-page position paper delivered to students in 1965, Bob Jones, Jr., condemned Billy Graham's &quot;ecumenical evangelism&quot; as unscriptural and &quot;heretical,&quot; noting that Graham shared his platform with Catholic priests and that one could not &quot;be a good Catholic and a good, spiritual Christian.&quot; When Graham arrived in Greenville, Jones, Jr. emphasized that the basis of the university's position was scriptural and not personal. &quot;The Bible commands that false teachers and men who deny the fundamentals of the faith should be accursed; that is, they shall be criticized and condemned. Billy approves them, Billy condones them, Billy recommends them....I think that Dr. Graham is doing more harm in the cause of Jesus Christ than any living man; that he is leading foolish and untaught Christians, simple people that do not know the Word of God, into disobedience to the Word of God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, &quot;The Position of Bob Jones University in Regard to the Proposed Billy Graham Crusade in Greenville, A Chapel Talk by Dr. Bob Jones, Jr., on February 8, 1965&quot;; ''Greenville News'', March 4, 1966, quoted in {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative publicity caused by the rift with Graham, itself a reflection of a larger division between separatist fundamentalists and [[neo-evangelicalism|neo-evangelicals]], precipitated a decline in BJU enrollment of about 10% in the years 1956-59. Seven members of the university board (of about a hundred) also resigned in support of Graham, including Graham himself and two of his staff members. By 1966, when Graham appeared in Greenville, BJU enrollment had strongly rebounded and continued to grow thereafter until the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=179–188, 253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====King James Bible====
[[Image:Bible-KJV.JPG|thumb|right|King James Version of the Bible]]
The university requires use of the [[King James Version]] (KJV) of the Bible in its services and classrooms, but it does not hold that the KJV is the only acceptable English translation or that it has the same authority as the original Hebrew and Greek manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=244–245}} [http://www.bju.edu/about/translation.html &quot;BJU Position on Bible Translations,&quot; BJU website].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[King-James-Only Movement]]&amp;mdash;or more correctly, movements, since it has many variations&amp;mdash;became a divisive force in fundamentalism only as conservative modern Bible translations, such as the New American Standard Bible (NASB) and the [[New International Version]] (NIV) began to appear in the 1970s. BJU has taken the position that orthodox Christians of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (including fundamentalists) agreed that while the KJV was a substantially accurate translation, only the original manuscripts of the Bible written in Hebrew and Greek were infallible and inerrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=244–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Jones, Jr. called the KJV-only position a &quot;heresy&quot; and &quot;in a very definite sense, a blasphemy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Jones Jr., Bob | title = Cornbread and Caviar | pages= 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university's stand has been condemned by some other fundamentalists. In 1998, [[Pensacola Christian College]] produced a widely distributed videotape, arguing that this &quot;leaven of fundamentalism&quot; was passed from the nineteenth-century Princeton theologian [[Benjamin B. Warfield]] (1851–1921) to Charles Brokenshire (1885–1954), who served BJU as Dean of the School of Religion, and then to current BJU faculty members and graduates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.troyandjessica.com/node/20] Documents on the BJU-Pensacola controversy archived on a private website.&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, [[Peter Ruckman]], a BJU graduate, has argued the most extreme version of the KJV-only position, that all translations of the Bible since the KJV have been of satanic origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of Catholicism and Mormonism====
The three Bob Joneses, especially Bob Jones, Jr., sharply criticized the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. For instance, Jones, Jr. once said that Catholicism was &quot;not another Christian denomination. It is a satanic counterfeit, an ecclesiastic tyranny over the souls of men....It is the old harlot of the book of the Revelation&amp;mdash;'the Mother of Harlots.'&quot; All popes, Jones asserted, &quot;are demon possessed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Jenkins, [[The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice]] (Oxford University Press, 2004), 24. &quot;[[Pope Paul VI]], archpriest of [[Satan]], a deceiver and an anti-Christ, has, like [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], gone to his own place....[A] &quot;pope must be an opportunist, a tyrant, a hypocrite, and a deceiver or he cannot be a pope....A pope claims to be Christ's vice-regent on earth; that is, he blasphemously and arrogantly claims to have the divine prerogatives to forgive sins, to assign his enemies to hell...and to speak on matters of faith and morals with the same infallibility as the Holy Bible.&quot;(1978)''Faith for the Family'' (October 1978, 2, 4)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, then-president Bob Jones III referred, on the university's web page, to Mormons and Catholics as &quot;cults which call themselves Christian.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beliefnet.com/story/15/story_1544_1.html Beliefnet.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 1966, BJU awarded an honorary doctorate to the Rev. [[Ian Paisley]], future British MP, leader of the [[Democratic Unionist Party]], and Moderator of the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]], who has referred to the Pope as a &quot;Roman anti-Christ.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/ian-paisley-can-the-big-man-say-yes-441754.html ''The Independent'', March 25, 2007]. After the death of Pope John XXIII in 1963, Paisley held a rally objecting to the lowering of the Union flag at Belfast City Hall in conjunction with &quot;the lying eulogies now being paid to the Roman Antichrist&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bob Jones III has argued that the university is not so much anti-Catholic or [[anti-Mormon]] as it is opposed to the idea that all men, regardless of religious beliefs, will eventually get to heaven: &quot;Our shame would be in telling people a lie, and thereby letting them go to hell without Christ because we loved their goodwill more than we loved them and their souls…. All religion, including Catholicism, which teaches that salvation is by religious works or church dogma is false. Religion that makes the words of its leader, be he Pope or other, equal with the Word of God is false. [[Sola Scriptura]]. From the time of the [[Protestant Reformation]] onward, it has been understood that there is no commonality between the Bible way, which is justification by faith in the shed blood of Jesus Christ, and salvation by works, which the faithful, practicing Catholic embraces.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/u/BJU?q=cache:2jKGRpvY-xoJ:www.bju.edu/aboutbju/special_articles/response/index+catholic&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=9&amp;ie=UTF-8 BJU website cache]; [http://greenvilleonline.com/news/2002/02/18/2002021819515.htm Greenville News, February 18, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial===
====Segregation====
Although BJU admitted Asians and other minorities from its inception, it did not enroll [[Black (people)|black]] students until 1971, eight years after the [[University of South Carolina]] and [[Clemson University]] had been integrated by court order. From 1971 to 1975, BJU admitted only married blacks, although the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) had already determined in 1970 that &quot;private schools with racially discriminatory admissions policies&quot; were not entitled to federal tax exemption. Late in 1971, BJU filed suit to prevent the IRS from taking its tax exemption, but in 1974, in ''[[Bob Jones University v. Simon]]'', the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that the university did not have standing to sue until the IRS actually assessed taxes. Four months later, on May 29, 1975, the University Board of Trustees authorized a change in policy to admit &quot;students of any race,&quot; a move that occurred shortly before the announcement of the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Runyon v. McCrary]]'' (427 U.S. 160 [1976]), which prohibited racial exclusion in private schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=226–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1975, as it prepared to allow unmarried blacks to enroll, BJU adopted more detailed rules prohibiting interracial dating and marriage—threatening expulsion for any student who dated or married interracially, who advocated interracial marriage, who was &quot;affiliated with any group or organization which holds as one of its goals or advocates interracial marriage,&quot; or &quot;who espouse, promote, or encourage others to violate the university's dating rules and regulations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=461&amp;invol=574 ''Bob Jones University v. United States''] (461 U.S. 574, 581)&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2000 interview, the then-president, Bob Jones III, said that [[interracial dating]] had been prohibited since the 1950s and that the policy had originated in a complaint by parents of a male Asian student who believed that their son had &quot;nearly married&quot; a white girl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/110/53.0.html Christianity Today article];[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0003/03/lkl.00.html &quot;Larry King Live&quot; transcript]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Bob Jones University v. United States'' (1983)====
{{main|Bob Jones University v. United States}}
[[Image:Rodeheaver2009.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|Rodeheaver Auditorium]]
On January 19, 1976, the Internal Revenue Service notified the university that its tax exemption had been revoked retroactively to December 1, 1970. The school appealed the IRS decision all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the University met all other criteria for tax-exempt status and that the school's racial discrimination was based on sincerely held religious beliefs, that &quot;God intended segregation of the races and that the Scriptures forbid interracial marriage.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=461&amp;invol=574''Bob Jones University v. United States''] (461 U.S. 574 @725)&lt;/ref&gt; The university was not challenged about the origin of its interracial dating policy, and the District Court accepted &quot;on the basis of a full evidentiary record&quot; BJU's argument that the rule was a sincerely held religious conviction, a finding affirmed by all subsequent courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=461&amp;invol=574''Bob Jones University v. United States''] (461 U.S. 574, footnote 28)&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1978, the federal district court ruled in the university's favor; two years later, that decision was overturned by the [[Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals]].

On January 8, 1982, just before the case was to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, President [[Ronald Reagan]] authorized his Treasury and Justice Departments to ask that the BJU case be dropped and that the previous court decisions be vacated. Political pressure quickly brought the Reagan administration to reverse itself and to ask the Court to reinstate the case. Then, in a virtually unprecedented move, the Court invited [[William T. Coleman, Jr.]] to argue the government's position in an [[amicus curiae]] brief, thus ensuring that the prosecution's position would be the one the Court wished to hear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=230}} &quot;On April 19, the Court announced that it would not allow the NAACP to join the case, and in a step considered unprecedented by legal scholars and 'extraordinary' even to the NAACP's leadership, the Supreme Court Appointed a prosecutor of its own—black attorney and civil rights activist William T. Coleman. Bob Jones III commented that 'this puts the court in the position of creating an issue to be litigated and insisting that an issue be heard when one of the two litigants declares &quot;no contest.&quot;'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The case was heard on October 12, 1982, and on May 24, 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against Bob Jones University in ''[[Bob Jones University v. United States]]'' (461 U.S. 574). The university refused to reverse its interracial dating policy and (with difficulty) paid a million dollars in back taxes. Also, in the year following the Court decision, contributions to the university declined by 13 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dropping the no-interracial-dating rule (2000)====
In 2000, following a media uproar prompted by the visit of presidential candidate [[George W. Bush]] to the university, Bob Jones III abruptly dropped the interracial dating rule, announcing the change on [[CNN|CNN's]] &quot;[[Larry King Live]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;For negative commentary on this announcement by Bob Jones III, see Anonymous BJU Graduate, &quot;Dancing with Compromise&quot; (April 2000), [http://multiracial.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=285&amp;Itemid=27 The Multiracial Activist].&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later when asked for his view of the rule change, the current president, Stephen Jones, replied, &quot;I've never been more proud of my dad than the night he...lifted that policy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[Susannah Meadows, &quot;Passing the Torch at Bob Jones U.&quot; ''Newsweek'' Web Exclusive [MSNBC link expired], January 29, 2005, hard copy at [http://158.158.239.51:81/search?/YPassing+&amp;SORT=D/YPassing+&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=Passing%20/1%2C282%2C282%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=YPassing+&amp;SORT=D&amp;12%2C12%2C Fundamentalism File, Mack Library, BJU.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apology for &quot;racially hurtful&quot; policies (2008)====
In November 2008, the university declared itself &quot;profoundly sorry&quot; for having allowed &quot;institutional policies to remain in place that were racially hurtful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2008-11-24-bob-jones-university-race_N.htm USA Today, November 24, 2008]; [http://www.bju.edu/about/race.html Statement about Race at Bob Jones University]. In the statement, the university admitted to having &quot;conformed to the culture&quot; rather than providing &quot;a clear Christian counterpoint to it.&quot; Earlier that year some BJU alumni expressed concern that the university had never repudiated its racist past and petitioned the school to make a formal apology. [http://www.greenvilleonline.com/article/20081122/NEWS01/311220002&amp;referrer=FRONTPAGECAROUSEL Greenville News, November 22, 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; That year BJU enrolled students from fifty states and nearly fifty countries, representing diverse ethnicities and cultures, and the BJU administration declared itself &quot;committed to maintaining on the campus the racial and cultural diversity and harmony characteristic of the true Church of Jesus Christ throughout the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/about/race.html Statement about Race at Bob Jones University].&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2005, the university had established two [[501(c)(3)]] charitable organizations to provide scholarship assistance solely for minority students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/giving/students.html Statement about Student Assistance Funds at Bob Jones University]. The Minority Scholarship Fund provides scholarship assistance to African-American, African, Pacific Islander, Asian, and Native American students; and the Hispanic Assistance Fund provides funds for students of Hispanic heritage. &quot;Investing in Lives for Eternity,&quot; BJU Advancement brochure (2008), 11-12, Bob Jones University Archives, Mack Library.

The University's endowment is only $7.5 million, and donations account for only two to three percent of the budget.''Greenville Journal'', December 11, 2009, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===
As a twelve-year-old, Bob Jones, Sr. made a twenty-minute speech in defense of the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]]. Jones was a friend and admirer of [[William Jennings Bryan]] but also campaigned throughout the South for [[Herbert Hoover]] (and against [[Al Smith]]) during the 1928 presidential election. Even the authorized history of BJU notes that both Bob Jones, Sr. and Bob Jones, Jr. “played political hardball” when dealing with the three municipalities in which the school was successively located. For instance, in 1962, Bob Jones, Sr. warned the Greenville City Council that he had “four hundred votes in his pocket and in any election he would have control over who would be elected.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=3, 10, 78, 246, 428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Republican powerhouse====
[[Image:Ron Strom.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Both [[Ronald Reagan]] (left) and [[Strom Thurmond]] (right) played influential roles in the political life of BJU]]
From the inception of Bob Jones College, a majority of students and faculty were northerners, and therefore many were already Republicans living in the &quot;[[Solid South]].&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Turner, 246; Interviews of Mary Gaston Stollenwerck Jones by Margaret Beall Tice, (September–October 1973), University Archives, Mack Library, BJU. Bob Jones, Sr. had held many evangelistic campaigns in the North prior to founding the college, and he correctly guessed that a new college in Florida would be more attractive to northerners than a new college in his home state of Alabama.&lt;/ref&gt; After South Carolina Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] switched his allegiance to the Republican Party in 1964, BJU faculty members became increasingly influential in the new state Republican party, and BJU alumni were elected to local political and party offices. In 1976, candidates supported by BJU faculty and alumni captured the local Republican party. Although this takeover was a short-term disaster, by 1980 the religious right and the &quot;[[country club Republican|country club&quot; Republican]]s had joined forces.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Ehrenhalt, ''The United States of Ambition: Politicians, Power and the Pursuit of Office'' (New York: Random House, 1991), 98-99. &quot;With its factions bitterly opposed to each other, the Republican party lost virtually all its state legislative seats in Greenville County, even as Gerard Ford was carrying the county against Jimmy Carter by more than 3,000 votes.&quot; (98)&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, most Republican candidates for local and statewide offices sought the endorsement of Bob Jones III and greeted faculty/staff voters at the University Dining Common.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;As late as 1978 the state representative for most of the Bob Jones precincts was Sylvia Dreyfus, a liberal Jewish Democrat. That does not happen anymore. These days, when elections are held in the districts that surround the university, anybody who does not have a Bob Jones connection does not have a realistic chance.&quot; Ehrenhalt, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; 

National Republicans soon followed. [[Ronald Reagan]] spoke at the school in 1980, although the Joneses supported his opponent, [[John Connally]], in the South Carolina primary.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;GOP debaters politick in state,&quot; ''Greenville News'', February 29, 1980. Reagan said he was &quot;surprised&quot; by Jones's endorsement of Connally.&lt;/ref&gt; (Later, Bob Jones III denounced Reagan as &quot;a traitor to God's people&quot; for choosing [[George H.W. Bush]]—whom Jones called a &quot;devil&quot;—as his vice president. Even later, Jones III shook Bush's hand and thanked him for being a good president.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/04/AR2005050402413.html ''Washington Post'', May 4, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, other Republicans such as [[Dan Quayle]], [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Phil Gramm]], [[Bob Dole]], and [[Alan Keyes]]&lt;ref&gt;On February 14, 2000, Keyes spoke and pointedly disagreed with some of BJU's positions and then referred to them during a Republican primary debate. In response, Bob Jones III said, &quot;Alan Keyes betrayed his friends at Bob Jones University with an outburst of sanctimonious hypocrisy.&quot; [http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=17816 Bob Jones Answers Critics, ''WorldNet Daily'', March 1, 2000].&lt;/ref&gt; also spoke at BJU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democrats were rarely invited to speak at the university, in part because they took political and social positions (especially support for abortion) opposed by the [[Christian right|Religious Right]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=246–248}}. As Bob Jones Jr. wrote in his memoirs, &quot;While the lecture platform of Bob Jones University will never be open to dishonest Liberals like [[Ted Kennedy]], conservative politicians and honorable statesmen have been speaking from that platform for many years.&quot; {{cite book | author = Jones Jr., Bob | title = Cornbread and Caviar | publisher = BJU Press | year = 1985 | pages= 197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2000 election====
On February 2, 2000, George W. Bush, as candidate for President, spoke during school's chapel hour.&lt;ref name = &quot;nohtva&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/pop/articles/022800wh-gop-bush.html ''New York Times'' website]&lt;/ref&gt; Bush gave a standard stump speech making no specific reference to the university. His political opponents quickly noted his non-mention of the university's ban on interracial dating. During the Michigan primary, Bush was also criticized for not stating his opposition to the university's anti-Catholicism. (The [[John McCain]] campaign targeted Catholics with a &quot;Catholic Voter Alert,&quot; phone calls reminding voters of Bush's visit to BJU.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/conventions/republican/features/turning.points/ CNN website]&lt;/ref&gt; Bush denied that he either knew of or approved what he regarded as BJU's intolerant policies. On February 26, Bush issued a formal letter of apology to Cardinal [[John Joseph O'Connor]] of [[New York]] for failing to denounce Bob Jones University's history of anti-[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] statements. At a news conference following the letter's release, Bush said, &quot;I make no excuses. I had an opportunity and I missed it. I regret that....I wish I had gotten up then and seized the moment to set a tone, a tone that I had set in Texas, a positive and inclusive tone.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;nohtva&quot;/&gt; Also during the 2000 Republican primary campaign in South Carolina, Richard Hand, a BJU professor, spread a false e-mail rumor that [[John McCain]] had fathered an [[illegitimate]] child. (The McCains have an adopted daughter from [[Bangladesh]], and later [[push poll]]ing also implied that the child was biracial.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0002/14/ip.00.html CNN website]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Withdrawal from politics====
Although the March 2007 issue of ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' listed BJU as one of &quot;The World's Most Controversial Religious Sites&quot; because of its past influence on American politics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3754&amp;page=1 &quot;The World's Most Controversial Religious Sites&quot;]. The others mentioned were the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] in Tokyo; [[Potala Palace]] in Tibet; [[Ayodhya]], Uttar Pradesh state, India; and the [[Temple Mount]]/Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem.&lt;/ref&gt; BJU has seen little political controversy since Stephen Jones became president. When asked by a ''[[Newsweek]]'' reporter if he wished to play a political role, Stephen Jones replied, &quot;It would not be my choice.&quot; Further, when asked if he felt ideologically closer to his father's engagement with politics or to other evangelicals who have tried to avoid civic involvement, he answered, &quot;The gospel is for individuals. The main message we have is to individuals. We’re not here to save the culture.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Susannah Meadows, &quot;Passing the Torch at Bob Jones U.&quot; ''Newsweek'' &quot;Web Exclusive&quot; [MSNBC link expired], January 29, 2005, hard copy at [http://158.158.239.51:81/search?/YPassing+&amp;SORT=D/YPassing+&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=Passing%20/1%2C282%2C282%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=YPassing+&amp;SORT=D&amp;12%2C12%2C Fundamentalist File, Mack Library, BJU].&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 ''[[Washington Post]]'' interview, Jones dodged political questions and even admitted that he was embarrassed by &quot;some of the more vitriolic comments&quot; made by his predecessors. &quot;I don't want to get specific,&quot; he said, &quot;But there were things said back then that I wouldn't say today.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/04/AR2005050402413_5.html Washington Post, April 4, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007 when Bob Jones III, as &quot;a private citizen,&quot; endorsed [[Mitt Romney]] for the Republican nomination for president, Stephen Jones made it clear that he wished &quot;to stay out of politics&quot; and that neither he nor the university had endorsed anyone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenvilleonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071021/NEWS01/710210319 Greenville News, October 21, 2007].&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a hotly contested South Carolina primary, none of the candidates appeared on the platform of BJU's Founders' Memorial Amphitorium during the 2008 election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Candidate [[Ron Paul]] did speak in a large classroom to an overflow crowd. BJU's vice president for administration said, “We purposefully chose a room in the Alumni building because we do not want candidates to hold rallies on campus. We want interested students, faculty and staff to benefit from the educational experience of listening to a candidate, and hopefully, as a result, be able to make a more informed voting decision.” ''BJU Collegian'', January 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008 Stephen Jones told a reporter, &quot;I don't think I have a political bone in my body.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Greenville Journal'' (April 4, 2008), 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strict rules govern student life at BJU.&lt;ref&gt;Pages on rules from the BJU website: [http://www.bju.edu/become-a-student/accepted-students/expectations/general.php General rules]; [http://www.bju.edu/become-a-student/accepted-students/expectations/dress.php Dress Code];[http://www.bju.edu/become-a-student/accepted-students/expectations/residence.php Residence Hall regulations].&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of these are based directly on the university's interpretation of the Bible. For instance, the 2005-06 Day Student Handbook states, &quot;Loyalty to Christ results in separated living. [[Dishonesty]], [[Lascivious|lewdness]], sensual behavior, [[adultery]], [[homosexuality]], [[Paraphilia|sexual perversion of any kind]], [[pornography]], [[Recreational drug use|illegal use of drugs]], and [[Alcohol intoxication|drunkenness]]—all are clearly condemned by God's word and prohibited here.&quot; Grounds for immediate dismissal include stealing, immorality (including sexual relations between unmarried students), possession of hard-core pornography, use of alcohol or drugs, and participating in a public demonstration for a cause the university opposes.&lt;ref&gt;BJU Student Handbook, '05-'06, 29&lt;/ref&gt; Similar &quot;moral failures&quot; are grounds for terminating the employment of faculty and staff. In 1998, a homosexual alumnus was threatened with arrest if he visited the campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctlibrary.com/1504 ''Christianity Today'' website.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other rules are not based on a specific biblical passage. For instance, the Handbook notes that &quot;there is no specific Bible command that says, 'Thou shalt not be late to class,' but a student who wishes to display orderliness and concern for others will not come in late to the distraction of the teacher and other students.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''BJU Day Student Handbook'', 07-08, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 a campus spokesman also said that one goal of the dress code was &quot;to teach our young people to dress professionally&quot; on campus while giving them &quot;the ability to...choose within the biblically accepted options of dress&quot; when they were off campus.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;BJU Changes Dress Code,&quot; ''Greenville Journal'', May 2, 2008, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional rules include the requirement that freshman resident hall students sign out before leaving campus and that resident hall students abide by a campus curfew of 10:30 PM, with lights out at midnight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/become-a-student/accepted-students/expectations/residence.php &quot;Student Expectations,&quot; BJU website]&lt;/ref&gt; Students are forbidden to go to movie theaters or listen to contemporary popular music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/become-a-student/accepted-students/expectations/residence.php &quot;Student Expectations,&quot; BJU website]. &quot;While students are at the University, our goal is to teach them to appreciate music that is spiritually edifying and culturally valuable. For the BJU student, this precludes most of the music of our popular culture including rock, rap, jazz and country, as well as religious music that borrows from these styles.&quot; ''Bob Jones University Student Handbook'' (2010-11), 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Male students are required to have conservative hairstyles, and facial hair is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/become-a-student/accepted-students/expectations/dress.php Men’s dress code]&lt;/ref&gt; Women are expected to dress modestly and wear knee-length dresses or skirts to class and religious services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/become-a-student/accepted-students/expectations/dress.php Women's dress code.]&lt;/ref&gt; The university will not allow anything displaying the logos of [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] or its subsidiary [[Hollister Co.|Hollister]] to be &quot;worn, carried, or displayed&quot; on campus even if the logos are covered because these companies have &quot;shown an unusual degree of antagonism to the name of Christ and an unusual display of wickedness in their promotions.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;BJU Day Student Handbook, 2007-2008, 58; [http://www.bju.edu/become-a-student/accepted-students/expectations/dress.php Dress regulations.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Empire''' comprised the [[dominion]]s, [[Crown colony|colonies]], [[protectorate]]s, [[League of Nations mandate|mandates]], and other [[Dependent territory|territories]] ruled or administered by the [[United Kingdom]]. It originated with the overseas colonies and [[trading post]]s established by [[Kingdom of England|England]] in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. At its height it was the [[List of largest empires|largest]] [[empire]] in history and, for over a century, was the foremost [[Power_in_international_relations#Categories_of_power|global power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Niall |year=2004 |title=Empire, The rise and demise of the British world order and the lessons for global power |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-02328-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1922 the British Empire held sway over about 458 million people, one-quarter of the world's population at the time,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMaddison2001|Maddison 2001]], pp.&amp;nbsp;98, 242.&lt;/ref&gt; and covered more than {{convert|33700000|km2|sqmi|-3|abbr=on}}, almost a quarter of the Earth's total land area.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFerguson2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refElkins2005|Elkins2005]], p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, its [[Common law|political]], [[English language|linguistic]] and [[Culture of the United Kingdom|cultural]] legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, it was often said that &quot;[[The empire on which the sun never sets|the sun never sets on the British Empire]]&quot; because its span across the globe ensured that the sun was always shining on at least one of its numerous territories.

During the [[Age of Discovery]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] pioneered European exploration of the globe, and in the process established large overseas empires. Envious of the great wealth these empires bestowed, England, [[French colonial empire|France]] and the [[Dutch Empire|Netherlands]] began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England ([[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], following the [[Acts of Union 1707|1707 Act of Union]] with Scotland) the dominant [[Colonialism|colonial power]] in North America and India. The loss of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in North America in 1783 after a [[American Revolutionary War|war of independence]] deprived Britain of some of its oldest and most populous colonies. British attention soon turned towards Africa, Asia and the Pacific. Following the defeat of [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]] in 1815, Britain enjoyed a century of almost unchallenged dominance, and expanded its imperial holdings across the globe. Increasing degrees of autonomy were granted to its [[White people|white]] [[Settler colonialism|settler colonies]], some of which were reclassified as dominions.

The growth of Germany and the United States had eroded Britain's economic lead by the end of the 19th century. Subsequent military and economic tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of the First World War, during which Britain relied heavily upon its Empire. The conflict placed enormous financial strain on Britain, and although the Empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after the war, it was no longer a peerless industrial or military power. The Second World War saw Britain's colonies in [[Southeast Asia|South-East Asia]] occupied by Japan, which damaged British prestige and accelerated the decline of the Empire, despite the eventual victory of Britain and its allies. [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|India]], Britain's most valuable and populous possession, was granted independence within two years of the end of the war.

After the end of the Second World War, as part of a larger [[Decolonization|decolonisation]] movement by European powers, most of the territories of the British Empire were granted independence, ending with the handover of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China in 1997. 14 territories remain under British sovereignty, the [[British Overseas Territories]]. After independence, many former British colonies joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a free association of independent states. 16 Commonwealth nations share their [[head of state]], Queen [[Elizabeth II]], as [[Commonwealth realm]]s.

==Origins (1497–1583)==
[[File:Matthew-BristolHarbour-Aug2004.jpg|thumb|upright|A replica of ''The Matthew'', [[John Cabot]]'s ship used for his second voyage to the [[New World]]]]
The foundation of the British Empire was laid when [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] were separate kingdoms. In 1496 King [[Henry VII of England]], following the successes of [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]] in overseas exploration, commissioned [[John Cabot]] to lead a voyage to discover a route to Asia via the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ferguson3&quot;&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Cabot sailed in 1497, five years after the [[discovery of America]], and although he successfully made landfall on the coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] (mistakenly believing, like [[Christopher Columbus]], that he had reached Asia),&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAndrews1985|Andrews 1985]], p.&amp;nbsp;45.&lt;/ref&gt; there was no attempt to found a [[colony]]. Cabot led another voyage to the Americas the following year but nothing was heard of his ships again.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;

No further attempts to establish English colonies in the Americas were made until well into the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], during the last decades of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English Reformation|Protestant Reformation]] had made enemies of England and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferguson3&quot;/&gt; In 1562, the [[List of English monarchs|English Crown]] sanctioned the [[privateer]]s [[John Hawkins]] and [[Francis Drake]] to engage in slave-raiding attacks against Spanish and Portuguese ships off the coast of [[West Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#refThomas|Thomas]], pp.&amp;nbsp;155–158&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of breaking into the Atlantic trade system. This effort was rebuffed and later, as the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish Wars]] intensified, Elizabeth lent her blessing to further piratical raids against Spanish ports in the Americas and shipping that was returning across the Atlantic, laden with treasure from the [[New World]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, influential writers such as [[Richard Hakluyt]] and [[John Dee]] (who was the first to use the term &quot;British Empire&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt; were beginning to press for the establishment of England's own empire. By this time, Spain was entrenched in the Americas, Portugal had established trading posts and forts from the coasts of Africa and [[Brazil]] to China, and [[French colonial empire|France]] had begun to settle the [[Saint Lawrence River]], later to become [[New France]].&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;4–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plantations of Ireland===
Though a relative latecomer in comparison to Spain and Portugal, England had been engaged during the 16th century in the settlement of Ireland, drawing on precedents dating back to the [[Norman Ireland|Norman invasion]] in 1171.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKenny|Kenny]], p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; Several people who helped establish the [[Plantations of Ireland]] also played a part in the early colonisation of North America, particularly a group known as the &quot;West Country men&quot;, which included [[Humphrey Gilbert]], [[Walter Raleigh]], [[Francis Drake]], [[John Hawkins]], [[Richard Grenville]] and [[Ralph Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTaylor2001|Taylor]], pp.&amp;nbsp;119,123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;First British Empire&quot; (1583–1783)==
In 1578, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] granted a patent to [[Humphrey Gilbert]] for discovery and overseas exploration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAndrews1985|Andrews]], p.&amp;nbsp;187.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Gilbert sailed for the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] with the intention of engaging in piracy and establishing a colony in North America, but the expedition was aborted before it had crossed the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAndrews1985|Andrews]], p.&amp;nbsp;188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;63.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1583 he embarked on a second attempt, on this occasion to the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] whose harbour he formally claimed for England, although no settlers were left behind. Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England, and was succeeded by his half-brother, [[Walter Raleigh]], who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584. Later that year, Raleigh founded the colony of [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]] on the coast of present-day [[North Carolina]], but lack of supplies caused the colony to fail.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], pp.&amp;nbsp;63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1603, King [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]] ascended to the English throne and in 1604 negotiated the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London]], ending hostilities with [[Spanish Empire|Spain]]. Now at peace with its main rival, English attention shifted from preying on other nations' colonial infrastructure to the business of establishing its own overseas colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;70.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Empire began to take shape during the early 17th century, with the [[British colonization of the Americas|English settlement]] of North America and the smaller islands of the [[Caribbean]], and the establishment of [[Privately held company|private companies]], most notably the [[East India Company|English East India Company]], to administer colonies and overseas trade. This period, until the loss of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] after the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] towards the end of the 18th century, has subsequently been referred to as the &quot;First British Empire&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas, Africa and the slave trade===
{{main|British colonization of the Americas|British America|British North America|Thirteen Colonies}}
The [[Caribbean]] initially provided England's most important and lucrative colonies,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt; but not before several attempts at colonisation failed. An attempt to establish a colony in [[British Guiana|Guiana]] in 1604 lasted only two years, and failed in its main objective to find [[gold]] deposits.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;71.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonies in [[Saint Lucia|St Lucia]]&amp;nbsp;(1605) and [[Grenada]]&amp;nbsp;(1609) also rapidly folded, but settlements were successfully established in [[Saint Kitts|St. Kitts]]&amp;nbsp;(1624), [[Barbados]]&amp;nbsp;(1627) and [[Nevis]]&amp;nbsp;(1628).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;221.&lt;/ref&gt; The colonies soon adopted the system of [[Plantation|sugar plantations]] successfully used by the Portuguese in [[Brazil]], which depended on [[Slavery|slave labour]], and—at first—Dutch ships, to sell the [[Slavery|slaves]] and buy the sugar.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands, Parliament [[Navigation Acts|decreed]] in 1651 that only English ships would be able to ply their trade in English colonies. This led to hostilities with the [[Dutch Republic|United Dutch Provinces]]—a series of [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]—which would eventually strengthen England's position in the Americas at the expense of the Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;32.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1655, England annexed the island of [[Jamaica]] from the Spanish, and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;33, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:British colonies 1763-76 shepherd1923.PNG|thumb|left|Map of British colonies in North America, c. 1763–1776]]
England's first permanent settlement in the Americas was founded in 1607 in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], led by Captain [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] and managed by the [[London Company|Virginia Company]]. [[Bermuda]] was claimed by England after the 1609 shipwreck there of the Company's [[Sea Venture|flagship]] and in 1615 was turned over to the newly formed [[Somers Isles Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;15–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Virginia Company's charter was revoked in 1624 and direct control of Virginia was assumed by the [[Crown colony|crown]], thereby founding the [[Colony of Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAndrews1985|Andrews]], pp.&amp;nbsp;316, 324–326.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[London and Bristol Company|Newfoundland Company]] was created in 1610 with the aim of creating a permanent settlement on Newfoundland, but was largely unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAndrews1985|Andrews]], pp.&amp;nbsp;20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1620, [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]] was founded as a haven for [[puritan]] religious separatists, later known as the [[Pilgrim]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt; Fleeing from [[religious persecution]] would become the motive of many English would-be colonists to risk the arduous [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic voyage]]: [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]] was founded as a haven for [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]&amp;nbsp;(1634), [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]]&amp;nbsp;(1636) as a colony tolerant of all religions and Connecticut&amp;nbsp;(1639) for [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]]. The [[Province of Carolina]] was founded in 1663. With the surrender of [[Fort Amsterdam]] in 1664, England gained control of the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]], renaming it New York. This was formalised in negotiations following the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|Second Anglo-Dutch War]], in exchange for [[Suriname]].&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;40.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1681, the colony of [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] was founded by [[William Penn]]. The American colonies were less financially successful than those of the Caribbean, but had large areas of good agricultural land and attracted far larger numbers of English emigrants who preferred their temperate climates.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], pp.&amp;nbsp;72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Insert some discussion of interaction with Native Indians here --&gt;

In 1670, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] granted a charter to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], granting it a monopoly on the [[fur trade]] in what was then known as [[Rupert's Land]], a vast stretch of territory that would later make up a large proportion of [[Canada]]. Forts and trading posts established by the Company were frequently the subject of attacks by the French, who had established their own fur trading colony in adjacent [[New France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;buckner25&quot;&gt;[[British Empire#refBuckner2008|Buckner]], p.&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, the [[Royal African Company]] was inaugurated, receiving from King Charles a monopoly of the trade to supply slaves to the British colonies of the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt;
From the outset, [[slavery]] was the basis of the British Empire in the West Indies. Until the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, Britain was responsible for the transportation of 3.5 million African slaves to the Americas, a third of all [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves transported across the Atlantic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate this trade, forts were established on the coast of [[West Africa]], such as [[James Island (The Gambia)|James Island]], [[Jamestown, Ghana|Accra]] and [[Bunce Island]]. In the British [[Caribbean]], the percentage of the population of [[black people]] rose from 25 percent in 1650 to around 80 percent in 1780, and in the 13 Colonies from 10 percent to 40 percent over the same period (the majority in the southern colonies).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;228.&lt;/ref&gt; For the slave traders, the trade was extremely profitable, and became a major economic mainstay for such western [[City status in the United Kingdom|British cities]] as [[Bristol]] and [[Liverpool]], which formed the third corner of the so-called [[triangular trade]] with Africa and the Americas. For the transported, harsh and unhygienic conditions on the slaving ships and poor diets meant that the average [[mortality rate]] during the [[Middle Passage|middle passage]] was one in seven.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv2|Marshall]], pp.&amp;nbsp;440–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1695, the [[Scottish Parliament|Scottish parliament]] granted a charter to the [[Company of Scotland]], which established a settlement in 1698 on the [[isthmus of Panama]], with a view to building a [[canal]] there. Besieged by neighbouring Spanish colonists of [[New Kingdom of Granada|New Granada]], and afflicted by [[malaria]], the colony was abandoned two years later. The [[Darien scheme]] was a financial disaster for Scotland—a quarter of Scottish capital&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMagnusson2003|Magnusson]], p.&amp;nbsp;531.&lt;/ref&gt; was lost in the enterprise—and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire. The episode also had major political consequences, persuading the governments of both England and Scotland of the merits of a union of countries, rather than just crowns.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMacaulay1979|Macaulay]], p.&amp;nbsp;509.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred in 1707 with the [[Treaty of Union]], establishing the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].

===Rivalry with the Netherlands in Asia===
[[File:Fort St. George, Chennai.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Fort St. George (India)|Fort St. George]] was founded at [[Chennai|Madras]] in 1639]]
At the end of the 16th century, England and the Netherlands began to challenge Portugal's monopoly of trade with Asia, forming private [[Joint stock company|joint-stock]] companies to finance the voyages—the English, later British, [[East India Company]] and the [[Dutch East India Company]], chartered in 1600 and 1602 respectively. The primary aim of these companies was to tap into the lucrative [[spice trade]], an effort focused mainly on two regions; the [[East Indies]] [[archipelago]], and an important hub in the trade network, India. There, they competed for trade supremacy with Portugal and with each other.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt; Although England would ultimately eclipse the Netherlands as a colonial power, in the short term the Netherlands' more advanced financial system&lt;ref name=&quot;ferguson19&quot;&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt; and the three [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia. Hostilities ceased after the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 when the Dutch [[William III of England|William of Orange]] ascended the English throne, bringing peace between the Netherlands and England. A deal between the two nations left the spice trade of the East Indies archipelago to the Netherlands and the textiles industry of India to England, but textiles soon overtook spices in terms of profitability, and by 1720, in terms of sales, the British company had overtaken the Dutch.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferguson19&quot;/&gt;

===Global struggles with France===
Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the [[Nine Years' War]] as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their [[military budget]] on the costly land war in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;441.&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th century would see England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPagden2003|Pagden]], p.&amp;nbsp;90.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Defeat of the French Fireships attacking the British Fleet at Anchor before Quebec.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Defeat of French fireships at [[Quebec]] in 1759]]
The death of [[Charles II of Spain]] in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe of Anjou]], a grandson of the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]], raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;shennan11&quot;/&gt; In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] against Spain and France in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which lasted until 1714. At the concluding [[Treaty of Utrecht]], Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;shennan11&quot;&gt;[[#refShennan1995|Shennan]], pp.&amp;nbsp;11–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and [[Acadia]], and from Spain, [[Gibraltar]] and [[Minorca]]. [[Gibraltar]], which is still a [[British overseas territories|British territory]] to this day, became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Minorca was returned to Spain at the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in 1802, after changing hands twice. Spain also ceded the rights to the lucrative ''[[Assiento|asiento]]'' (permission to sell slaves in [[Ibero-America|Spanish America]]) to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seven Years' War]], which began in 1756, was the first war waged on a global scale, fought in Europe, India, North America, the [[Caribbean]], the [[Philippines]] and coastal Africa. The signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] had important consequences for the future of the British Empire. In North America, France's future as a colonial power there was effectively ended with the recognition of British claims to [[Rupert's Land]],&lt;ref name=&quot;buckner25&quot;/&gt; the ceding of [[New France]] to Britain (leaving a sizable [[Quebec|French-speaking population]] under British control) and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] to Spain. Spain ceded Florida to Britain. In India, the [[Carnatic Wars#Third Carnatic War .281757.E2.80.931763.29|Carnatic War]] had left France still in control of its [[French India|enclaves]] but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, ending French hopes of controlling India.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSekhara2004|Bandyopādhyāẏa]], pp.&amp;nbsp;49–52&lt;/ref&gt; The British victory over France in the Seven Years' War therefore left Britain as the world's most powerful maritime power.&lt;ref name=&quot;refpagden1&quot;&gt;[[#refPagden2003|Pagden]], p.&amp;nbsp;91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise of the &quot;Second British Empire&quot; (1783–1815)==
[[File:Clive.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive|Robert Clive]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] established the Company as a military as well as a commercial power.]]

===Company rule in India===
{{Main|Company rule in India}}
During its first century of operation, the [[East India Company|English East India Company]] focused on trade with the [[Indian subcontinent]], as it was not in a position to challenge the powerful [[Mughal Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;93.&lt;/ref&gt; which had granted it trading rights in 1617. This changed in the 18th century as the Mughals declined in power and the East India Company struggled with its French counterpart, the ''[[French East India Company|Compagnie française des Indes orientales]]'', during the [[Carnatic Wars]] in the 1740s and 1750s. The [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, which saw the British, led by [[Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive|Robert Clive]], defeat the [[Nawab of Bengal]] and his [[French East India Company|French]] allies, left the Company in control of [[Bengal]] and as the major military and [[political power]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following decades it gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the [[Indian Army (1895–1947)|British Indian Army]], the vast majority of which was composed of Indian [[sepoy]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[British India]] eventually grew into the Empire's most valuable possession, &quot;the Jewel in the Crown&quot;; covering a territory greater than that of the [[Roman Empire]], it was the most important source of Britain's strength, defining its status as the world's greatest power.&lt;ref name=Brown5&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of the Thirteen American Colonies===
{{Main|American Revolution}}
During the 1760s and 1770s, relations between the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of resentment of the British Parliament's attempts to govern and tax American colonists without their consent,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;84.&lt;/ref&gt; summarised at the time by the slogan &quot;[[No taxation without representation]]&quot;. Disagreement over the American colonists' [[Rights of Englishmen|guaranteed Rights as Englishmen]] resulted in the [[American Revolution]] and the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] in 1775. The following year, the colonists [[United States Declaration of Independence|declared the independence of the United States]]. With assistance from [[France in the American Revolutionary War|France]], [[Spain in the American Revolutionary War|Spain]], and the Netherlands the United States would go on to win the war in 1783.

[[File:Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|left|''Surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown''. The loss of the American colonies marked the end of the &quot;first British Empire&quot;.]]
The loss of such a large portion of [[British America]], at the time Britain's most populous overseas possession, is seen by historians as the event defining the transition between the &quot;first&quot; and &quot;second&quot; empires,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Britain shifted its attention away from the Americas to Asia, the Pacific and later Africa. [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, had argued that colonies were redundant, and that [[free trade]] should replace the old [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion, dating back to the [[protectionism]] of Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref name=&quot;refpagden1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;120.&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of trade between the newly independent United States and Britain after 1783 seemed to confirm Smith's view that political control was not necessary for economic success.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv2|Marshall]], p.&amp;nbsp;585.&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions between the two nations escalated during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], as Britain tried to cut off American trade with France, and boarded American ships to [[Impressment|impress]] into the Royal Navy men of British birth. The U.S. declared war, the [[War of 1812]], in which both sides tried to make major gains at the other's expense. Both failed and the [[Treaty of Ghent]], ratified in 1815, kept the pre-war boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLatimer|Latimer]], pp.&amp;nbsp;8, 30–34, 389–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Events in America influenced British policy in Canada, where between 40,000 and 100,000&lt;ref&gt;[[#refZolberg2006|Zolberg]], p.&amp;nbsp;496.&lt;/ref&gt; defeated [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] had migrated from America following independence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGames2002|Games]], pp.&amp;nbsp;46–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The 14,000 Loyalists who went to the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John]] and [[Saint Croix River (Maine – New Brunswick)|Saint Croix]] river valleys, then part of [[Nova Scotia]], felt too far removed from the provincial government in Halifax, so London split off [[New Brunswick]] as a separate colony in 1784.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKelley2010|Kelley &amp; Trebilcock]], p.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitutional Act of 1791]] created the provinces of [[Upper Canada]] (mainly English-speaking) and [[Lower Canada]] (mainly [[French language|French-speaking]]) to defuse tensions between the French and British communities, and implemented governmental systems similar to those employed in Britain, with the intention of asserting imperial authority and not allowing the sort of popular control of government that was perceived to have led to the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploration of the Pacific===
Since 1718, [[penal transportation|transportation]] to the American colonies had been a penalty for various criminal offences in Britain, with approximately one thousand convicts transported per year across the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;/ref&gt; Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the 13 Colonies in 1783, the British government turned to the newly discovered lands of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The western coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch explorer [[Willem Janszoon|Willem Jansz]] in 1606 and was later named by the [[Dutch East India Company]] [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]],&lt;ref name&gt;[[#refMulligan2001|Mulligan &amp; Hill]], pp.&amp;nbsp;20–23.&lt;/ref&gt; but there was no attempt to colonise it. In 1770 [[James Cook]] discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific [[First voyage of James Cook|voyage]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific Ocean]], claimed the continent for Britain, and named it [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPeters2006|Peters]], pp.&amp;nbsp;5–23.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1778, [[Joseph Banks]], Cook's [[Botany|botanist]] on the voyage, presented evidence to the government on the suitability of [[Botany Bay]] for the establishment of a [[Penal colony|penal settlement]], and in 1787 the first shipment of [[Convicts in Australia|convicts]] set sail, arriving in 1788.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;142.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBrittain|''Brittain and the Dominions'']], p.&amp;nbsp;159.&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian colonies became profitable exporters of wool and gold,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFieldhouse1999|Fieldhouse]], pp. 145–149&lt;/ref&gt; mainly due to gold rushes in the colony of Victoria, making its capital [[Melbourne]] the richest city in the world&lt;ref name=&quot;RobertCervero320&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cervero|first=Robert B.|title= The Transit Metropolis: A Global Inquiry|publisher=Island Press|year=1998|location=Chicago|page=320|isbn=1-55963-591-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the largest city after [[London]] in the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Statesmen's Year Book 1889&lt;/ref&gt;

During his voyage, Cook also visited New Zealand, first discovered by Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]] in 1642, and claimed the [[North Island|North]] and [[South Island|South]] islands for the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British crown]] in 1769 and 1770 respectively. Initially, interaction between the indigenous [[Māori people|Maori]] population and Europeans was limited to the trading of goods. European settlement increased through the early decades of the 19th century, with numerous trading stations established, especially in the North. In 1839, the [[New Zealand Company]] announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand. On 6 February 1840, Captain [[William Hobson]] and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; This treaty is considered by many to be New Zealand's founding document,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day|title=Waitangi Day|publisher=History Group, New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but differing interpretations of the Maori and English versions of the text&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&amp;nbsp;579.&lt;/ref&gt; have meant that it continues to be a source of dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMeinSmith|Mein Smith]], p.&amp;nbsp;49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War with Napoleonic France===
{{Main|Napoleonic Wars}}
Britain was challenged again by France under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], in a struggle that, unlike previous wars, represented a contest of ideologies between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;152.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not only Britain's position on the world stage that was threatened: Napoleon threatened to invade Britain itself, just as his armies had overrun many countries of [[continental Europe]]. 

[[File:Sadler, Battle of Waterloo.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Waterloo]] ended in the defeat of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]].]]
The Napoleonic Wars were therefore ones in which Britain invested large amounts of capital and resources to win. French ports were blockaded by the [[Royal Navy]], which won a decisive victory over a Franco-Spanish fleet at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] in 1805. Overseas colonies were attacked and occupied, including those of the Netherlands, which was annexed by Napoleon in 1810. France was finally defeated by a coalition of European armies in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;115–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain was again the beneficiary of peace treaties: France ceded the [[United States of the Ionian Islands|Ionian Islands]], [[Malta]] (which it had occupied in 1797 and 1798 respectively), [[Mauritius]], [[Saint Lucia|St Lucia]], and [[Tobago]]; Spain ceded [[Trinidad]]; the Netherlands [[British Guiana|Guyana]], and the [[Cape Colony]]. Britain returned [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[French Guiana]], and [[Réunion]] to France, and [[Java]] and [[Suriname]] to the Netherlands, while gaining control of [[Ceylon]] (1795–1815).&lt;ref name=&quot;refjames182&quot;&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Aruba and Curacao were returned as well I think--&gt;

===Abolition of slavery===
Under increasing pressure from the British [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement, the British government enacted the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act]] in 1807 which abolished the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] in the Empire. In 1808, [[Sierra Leone]] was designated an official British colony for freed slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act]] passed in 1833 abolished slavery in the British Empire on 1 August 1834 (with the exception of [[St. Helena]], Ceylon and the territories administered by the East India Company, though these exclusions were later repealed). Under the Act, slaves were granted full [[emancipation]] after a period of 4 to 6 years of &quot;apprenticeship&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHinks|Hinks]], p.&amp;nbsp;129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain's imperial century (1815–1914)==
[[File:Imperial Federation, Map of the World Showing the Extent of the British Empire in 1886 (levelled).jpg|thumb|250px|An elaborate map of the British Empire in 1886, marked in the traditional colour for imperial British dominions on maps]]
Between 1815 and 1914, a period referred to as Britain's &quot;imperial century&quot; by some historians,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHyam2002|Hyam]], p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&amp;nbsp;71.&lt;/ref&gt; around 10,000,000 square miles (26,000,000 km2) of territory and roughly 400 million people were added to the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refParsons|Parsons]], p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Victory over Napoleon left Britain without any serious international rival, other than [[The Great Game|Russia in central Asia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;#refOHBEv3|Porter, p. 401&quot;&gt;[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&amp;nbsp;401.&lt;/ref&gt; Unchallenged at sea, Britain adopted the role of global policeman, a state of affairs later known as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&amp;nbsp;332.&lt;/ref&gt; and a foreign policy of &quot;[[splendid isolation]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLee1994|Lee 1994]], pp.&amp;nbsp;254–257.&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, Britain's dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many countries, such as China, [[Argentina]] and [[Thailand|Siam]], which has been characterised by some historians as &quot;[[Informal Empire|informal empire]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], pp.&amp;nbsp;156–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

British imperial strength was underpinned by the [[Steamboat|steamship]] and the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century, allowing it to control and defend the Empire. By 1902, the British Empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables, the so-called [[All Red Line]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDalziel2006|Dalziel]], pp.&amp;nbsp;88–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

===East India Company in Asia===
{{See also|British Raj}}
[[File:Victoria Disraeli cartoon.jpg|left|thumb|upright|An 1876 political cartoon of [[Benjamin Disraeli]] (1804–1881) making [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] [[Emperor of India|Empress of India]]. The caption was &quot;New crowns for old ones!&quot;]]
The [[East India Company]] drove the expansion of the British Empire in Asia. The Company's army had first joined forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years' War, and the two continued to cooperate in arenas outside India: the eviction of Napoleon from [[Egypt]] (1799), the capture of [[Java]] from the Netherlands (1811), the acquisition of [[Singapore]] (1819) and [[Malacca]] (1824) and the defeat of [[Burma]] (1826).&lt;ref name=&quot;#refOHBEv3|Porter, p. 401&quot;/&gt;

From its base in India, the Company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable [[opium]] export trade to China since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing dynasty]] in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of [[tea]], which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMartin2007|Martin]], pp.&amp;nbsp;146–148.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the [[First Opium War]], and resulted in the seizure by Britain of Hong Kong, at that time a minor settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJanin1999|Janin]], p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1857 mutiny of [[sepoy]]s, Indian troops under British officers and discipline, grew into a wider conflict which ended with the dissolution of the company and the assumption of direct control by the British government.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refParsons|Parsons]], pp.&amp;nbsp;44–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Rebellion]] took six months to suppress, with heavy loss of life on both sides. Afterwards the British government assumed direct control over India, ushering in the period known as the [[British Raj]], where an appointed [[Governor-General of India|governor-general]] administered India and [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] was crowned the Empress of India. The East India Company was dissolved the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], pp. 50–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

India suffered a series of serious crop failures in the late 19th century, leading to [[Famine in India|widespread famines]] in which it is estimated that over 15 million people died. The East India Company had failed to implement any coordinated policy to deal with the famines during its period of rule. This changed during the Raj, in which commissions were set up after each famine to investigate the causes and implement new policies, which took until the early 1900s to have an effect.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], pp.&amp;nbsp;133–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivalry with Russia===
{{main|The Great Game}}
During the 19th century, Britain and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] vied to fill the power vacuums that had been left by the declining [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Qajar dynasty|Persian]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing Chinese]] empires. This rivalry in Eurasia came to be known as the &quot;[[The Great Game|Great Game]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHopkirk1992|Hopkirk]], pp.&amp;nbsp;1–12.&lt;/ref&gt; As far as Britain was concerned, the defeats inflicted by Russia on Persia and Turkey in the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)]] and [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)]] demonstrated its imperial ambitions and capabilities, and stoked fears in Britain of an overland invasion of India.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;181.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839, Britain moved to pre-empt this by invading [[Afghanistan]], but the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] was a disaster for Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;refjames182&quot;&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;182.&lt;/ref&gt; When Russia invaded the Turkish [[Balkans]] in 1853, fears of Russian dominance in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the [[Crimea|Crimean Peninsula]] in order to destroy Russian naval capabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;refjames182&quot;/&gt; The ensuing [[Crimean War|Crimean War (1854–56)]], which involved new techniques of [[modern warfare]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRoyle2000|Royle]], preface.&lt;/ref&gt; and was the only [[World war|global war]] fought between Britain and another [[Imperialism|imperial power]] during the ''Pax Britannica'', was a resounding defeat for Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;refjames182&quot;/&gt; The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan]] in 1876 and Russia [[Kyrgyzstan|Kirghizia]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Turkmenistan]]. For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]] in the region in 1878, and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with the signing of the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Beryl J.|title=The Strategic Background to the Anglo-Russian Entente of August 1907|journal=The Historical Journal|year=1966|volume=9|pages=360–373 |jstor=2637986|doi=10.1017/S0018246X00026698|issue=03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of the [[Russian Navy]] at the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904&amp;ndash;05 also limited its threat to the British.&lt;ref name=&quot;hodge47&quot;&gt;[[#refhodge47|Hodge]], p.&amp;nbsp;47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cape to Cairo===
[[File:Punch Rhodes Colossus.png|thumb|''[[The Rhodes Colossus]]''—[[Cecil Rhodes]] spanning &quot;Cape to Cairo&quot;]]
The Dutch East India Company had founded the [[Cape Colony]] on the southern tip of Africa in 1652 as a way station for its ships travelling to and from its colonies in the [[Indies|East Indies]]. Britain formally acquired the colony, and its large [[Afrikaner]] (or [[Boer]]) population in 1806, having occupied it in 1795 in order to prevent its falling into French hands, following the invasion of the Netherlands by France.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&amp;nbsp;85.&lt;/ref&gt; British immigration began to rise after 1820, and pushed thousands of Boers, resentful of British rule, northwards to found their own—mostly short-lived—independent republics, during the [[Great Trek]] of the late 1830s and early 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], pp.&amp;nbsp;85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; In the process the [[Voortrekkers]] clashed repeatedly with the British, who had their own agenda with regard to colonial expansion in South Africa and with several African polities, including those of the [[Basotho|Sotho]] and the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] nations. Eventually the Boers established two republics which had a longer lifespan: the [[South African Republic]] or Transvaal Republic (1852–77; 1881–1902) and the [[Orange Free State]] (1854–1902).&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;168, 186, 243.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902 Britain occupied both republics, concluding a treaty with the two [[Boer Republics]] following the [[Second Boer War]] 1899–1902.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869 the Suez Canal was opened under [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], linking the Mediterranean with the Indian Ocean. The Canal was at first opposed by the British,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTilby2009|Tilby]], p.&amp;nbsp;256.&lt;/ref&gt; but once open its strategic value was recognised quickly. In 1875, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Benjamin Disraeli]] bought the indebted [[Egypt]]ian ruler [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail Pasha]]'s 44 percent shareholding in the [[Suez Canal]] for £4 million (£{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|4000000|1875|r=-7}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}). Although this did not grant outright control of the strategic waterway, it did give Britain leverage. Joint Anglo-French financial control over Egypt ended in outright British occupation in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], pp.&amp;nbsp;230–33.&lt;/ref&gt; The French were still majority shareholders and attempted to weaken the British position,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;274.&lt;/ref&gt; but a compromise was reached with the 1888 [[Convention of Constantinople]], which made the Canal officially neutral territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treaties|url=http://www.mfa.gov.eg/MFA_Portal/en-GB/Foreign_Policy/Treaties/Convention+Respecting+the+Free+Navigation+of+the+Suez+Maritime+Canal.htm|publisher=Egypt Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As French, [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] activity in the lower [[Congo River]] region threatened to undermine orderly penetration of tropical Africa, the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Berlin Conference]] of 1884–85 sought to regulate the competition between the European powers in what was called the &quot;[[Scramble for Africa]]&quot; by defining &quot;effective occupation&quot; as the criterion for international recognition of territorial claims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHerbst2000|Herbst]], pp.&amp;nbsp;71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; The scramble continued into the 1890s, and caused Britain to reconsider its decision in 1885 to withdraw from [[Sudan]]. A joint force of British and Egyptian troops defeated the [[Mahdist War|Mahdist Army]] in 1896, and rebuffed a French attempted invasion at [[Fashoda Incident|Fashoda]] in 1898. Sudan was made an [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian Condominium]], a joint protectorate in name, but a British colony in reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vandervort1998|Vandervort]], pp.&amp;nbsp;169–183.&lt;/ref&gt;

British gains in southern and [[East Africa]] prompted [[Cecil Rhodes]], pioneer of British expansion in Africa, to urge a &quot;[[Cape to Cairo Railway|Cape to Cairo]]&quot; railway linking the strategically important [[Suez Canal]] to the mineral-rich South.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;298.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888 Rhodes with his privately owned [[British South Africa Company]] occupied and annexed territories subsequently named after him, [[Rhodesia (name)|Rhodesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;215.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing status of the white colonies===
From the 18th century, there had been a marked contrast between the status of the British Empire's [[white people|white]] colonies and that of colonies peopled by [[non-white|non-whites]]. While the Empire was characterised by [[autocracy|autocratic]] rule—[[enlightened absolutism|&quot;enlightened&quot; despotism]]—and military [[imperialism]] in the latter, it became a champion of free thought and evolving self-government in the white colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The path to independence for the white colonies of the British Empire began with the 1839 [[Report on the Affairs of British North America|Durham Report]], which proposed unification and self-government for the two [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]], as a solution to political unrest there.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], pp.&amp;nbsp;28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; This began with the passing of the [[Act of Union 1840|Act of Union]] in 1840, which created the [[Province of Canada]]. [[Responsible government]] was first granted to [[Nova Scotia]] in 1848, and was soon extended to the other British North American colonies. With the passage of the [[British North America Act, 1867]] by the [[British Parliament]], Upper and Lower Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were formed into the [[Dominion of Canada]], a confederation enjoying full self government with the exception of [[international relations]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&amp;nbsp;187&lt;/ref&gt; Australia and New Zealand achieved similar levels of self-government after 1900, with the Australian colonies [[federation of Australia|federating in 1901]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;dominion status&quot; was officially introduced at the [[Imperial Conference|Colonial Conference of 1907]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rhodes5&quot;/&gt;

The last decades of the 19th century saw concerted [[political campaign]]s for Irish [[home rule]]. Ireland had been united with Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with the [[Act of Union 1800]] after the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], and had suffered a severe [[Great Famine (Ireland)|famine]] between 1845 and 1852. Home rule was supported by the British [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]], [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]], who hoped that Ireland might follow in Canada's footsteps as a Dominion within the Empire, but his 1886 [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Home Rule bill]] was defeated in Parliament, as many MPs feared that a partially independent Ireland might pose a security threat to Great Britain or be the beginnings of the breakup of the Empire. A [[Irish Government Bill 1893|second Home Rule bill]] was also defeated for similar reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;315.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Home Rule Act 1914|third bill]] was passed by Parliament in 1914, but not implemented due to the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] leading to the 1916 [[Easter Rising]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World wars (1914–1945)==
By the turn of the 20th century, fears had begun to grow in Britain that it would no longer be able to defend the metropole and the entirety of the Empire while at the same time maintaining the policy of &quot;[[splendid isolation]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOBrien|O'Brien]], p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany was rising rapidly as a military and industrial power and was now seen as the most likely opponent in any future war. Recognising that it was overstretched in the Pacific&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;667.&lt;/ref&gt; and threatened at home by the [[Kaiserliche Marine|German navy]], Britain formed an alliance with [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|Japan]] in 1902, and its old enemies [[Entente cordiale|France]] and [[Anglo-Russian Entente|Russia]] in 1904 and 1907, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;275.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War===
{{Main|History of the United Kingdom during World War I}}
Britain's fears of war with Germany were realised in 1914 with the outbreak of the First World War. The British declaration of war on Germany and its allies also committed the colonies and Dominions, which provided invaluable military, financial and material support. Over 2.5 million men served in the armies of the Dominions, as well as many thousands of volunteers from the [[Crown colony|Crown colonies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], pp.&amp;nbsp;78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Germany's overseas colonies in Africa were quickly invaded and occupied, and in the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand occupied [[German New Guinea]] and [[Samoa]] respectively. The contributions of Australian, Newfoundland and New Zealand troops during the 1915 [[Gallipoli Campaign]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] had a great impact on the national consciousness at home, and marked a watershed in the transition of Australia and New Zealand from colonies to nations in their own right. The countries continue to commemorate this occasion on [[Anzac Day|ANZAC Day]]. Canadians viewed the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] in a similar light.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;277.&lt;/ref&gt; The important contribution of the Dominions to the [[war effort]] was recognised in 1917 by the British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] when he invited each of the Dominion Prime Ministers to join an [[Imperial War Cabinet]] to coordinate imperial policy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;278.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the terms of the concluding [[Treaty of Versailles]] signed in 1919, the Empire reached its greatest extent with the addition of {{mi2 to km2|1800000|precision=-3}} and 13 million new subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;315.&lt;/ref&gt; The colonies of Germany and the [[Ottoman Empire]] were distributed to the Allied powers as [[League of Nations mandate|League of Nations Mandates]]. Britain gained control of [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine, Transjordan]], [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|Iraq]], parts of [[Cameroons|Cameroon]] and [[Togo]], and [[Tanganyika]]. The Dominions themselves also acquired mandates of their own: [[South West Africa|South-West Africa]] (modern-day [[Namibia]]) was given to the [[Union of South Africa]], Australia gained [[German New Guinea]], and New Zealand [[Samoa|Western Samoa]]. [[Nauru]] was made a combined mandate of Britain and the two Pacific Dominions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFox2008|Fox]], pp.&amp;nbsp;23–29, 35, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-war period===
The changing world order that the war had brought about, in particular the growth of the United States and Japan as naval powers, and the rise of independence movements in India and Ireland, caused a major reassessment of British imperial policy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGoldstein|Goldstein]], p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt; Forced to choose between alignment with the United States or Japan, Britain opted not to renew its Japanese alliance and instead signed the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]], where Britain accepted naval parity with the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;reflouis302&quot;&gt;[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&amp;nbsp;302.&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was the source of much debate in Britain during the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&amp;nbsp;294.&lt;/ref&gt; as militaristic governments took hold in Japan and Germany helped in part by the [[Great Depression]], for it was feared that the Empire could not survive a simultaneous attack by both nations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&amp;nbsp;303.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the issue of the Empire's security was a serious concern in Britain, at the same time the Empire was vital to the British economy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLee1996|Lee 1996]], p.&amp;nbsp;305.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, the frustrations caused by delays to [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Irish home rule]] led members of [[Sinn Féin]], a pro-independence party that had won a majority of the Irish seats at Westminster in the [[Irish general election, 1918|1918 British general election]], to establish an [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Republic)|Irish assembly]] in [[Dublin]], at which Irish independence was declared. The [[Irish Republican Army]] simultaneously began a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] war against the British administration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Irish War of Independence|Anglo-Irish War]] ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], creating the [[Irish Free State]], a Dominion within the British Empire, with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the British Crown.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northern Ireland]], consisting of six of the 32 [[Counties of Ireland|Irish counties]] which had been established as a devolved region under the 1920 [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|Government of Ireland Act]], immediately exercised its option under the treaty to retain its existing status within the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMagee|Magee]], p.&amp;nbsp;108.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ImperialConference.jpg|thumb|left|King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] with the British and Dominion prime ministers at the [[1926 Imperial Conference]]]]
A similar struggle began in India when the [[Government of India Act 1919]] failed to satisfy demand for independence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;330.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the [[Ghadar Conspiracy]] ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the [[Rowlatt Act]]s, creating tension,&lt;ref name=&quot;refjames416&quot;&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;416.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the Punjab, where repressive measures culminated in the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre|Amritsar Massacre]]. In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the event, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion.&lt;ref name=&quot;refjames416&quot;/&gt; The subsequent [[non-cooperation movement]] was called off in March 1922 following the [[Chauri Chaura]] incident, and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Low|first=D.A.|title=The Government of India and the First Non-Cooperation Movement-—1920–1922|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|date=February 1966|volume=25|issue=2|pages=241–259|doi=10.2307/2051326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1922, Egypt, which had been declared a British [[protectorate]] at the outbreak of the First World War, was [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|granted formal independence]], though it continued to be a British [[client state]] until 1954. [[British Army|British troops]] remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]] in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the [[Suez Canal]] zone. In return, Egypt was assisted to join [[League of Nations|the League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;292.&lt;/ref&gt; [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|Iraq]], a British [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refrefSmith1998|Smith]], p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy, independent of Britain, was recognised at the [[Imperial Conference|1923 Imperial Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMcIntyre|McIntyre]], p.&amp;nbsp;187.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the [[Chanak Crisis|Chanak crisis]] the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMcIntyre|McIntyre]], p.&amp;nbsp;186.&lt;/ref&gt; After pressure from Ireland and South Africa, the [[1926 Imperial Conference]] issued the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]], declaring the Dominions to be &quot;autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another&quot; within a &quot;British [[Commonwealth of Nations]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;69.&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rhodes5&quot;&gt;[[#refRhodes2009|Rhodes, Wanna &amp; Weller]], pp.&amp;nbsp;5–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify [[Law of the United Kingdom|British laws]] and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTurpin2007|Turpin &amp; Tomkins]], p.&amp;nbsp;48.&lt;/ref&gt; Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933, suffering from financial difficulties during the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;300.&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland distanced itself further from Britain with the introduction of a new [[Constitution of Ireland|constitution]] in 1937, making it a republic in all but name.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKenny|Kenny]], p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===
{{Main|Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|l1=Military history of the United Kingdom during the Second World War}}
[[File:El Alamein 1942 - British infantry.jpg|thumb|The [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] was made up of units from across the Empire and fought in the [[Western Desert Campaign|Western Desert]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy.]]]]
Britain's declaration of war against [[Nazi Germany]] in September 1939 included the [[Crown colony|Crown colonies]] and India but did not automatically commit the Dominions. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa all soon declared war on Germany, but the [[Irish Free State]] chose to remain [[Irish neutrality|legally neutral]] throughout [[The Emergency (Ireland)|the war]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;313–14.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Battle of France|German occupation of France]] in 1940, Britain and the Empire were left standing alone against Germany, until the entry of the [[Soviet Union]] to the war in 1941. British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] successfully lobbied President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for [[military aid]] from the United States, but Roosevelt was not yet ready to ask [[United States Congress|Congress]] to commit the country to war.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refGilbert2005|Gilbert]], p.&amp;nbsp;234.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met and signed the [[Atlantic Charter]], which included the statement that &quot;the rights of all peoples to choose the [[form of government]] under which they live&quot; should be respected. This wording was ambiguous as to whether it referred to European countries invaded by Germany, or the peoples colonised by European nations, and would later be interpreted differently by the British, Americans, and nationalist movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;reflloyd316&quot;&gt;[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;513.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1941, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] launched, in quick succession, attacks on British [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]], the United States naval base at [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], and [[Battle of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. Japan had steadily been growing as an imperial power in the Far East since its defeat of China in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&amp;nbsp;295.&lt;/ref&gt; envisioning a [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] under its leadership. The Japanese attacks on the British and American possessions in the Pacific had an immediate and long-lasting impact on the British Empire. Churchill's reaction to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory and the future of the Empire was safe,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGilbert2005|Gilbert]], p.&amp;nbsp;244.&lt;/ref&gt; but the manner in which the British rapidly surrendered in some of its colonies irreversibly altered Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&amp;nbsp;337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;319.&lt;/ref&gt; Most damaging of all was the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;460.&lt;/ref&gt; The realisation that Britain could not defend the entire Empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States, which after the war eventually resulted in the 1951 [[ANZUS|ANZUS Pact]] between Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America.&lt;ref name=&quot;reflloyd316&quot;/&gt;

==Decolonisation and decline (1945–1997)==
Though Britain and the Empire emerged victorious from the [[World War II|Second World War]], the effects of the conflict were profound, both at home and abroad. Much of Europe, a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries, was in ruins, and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, to whom the balance of global power had now shifted.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAbernethy2000|Abernethy]], p.&amp;nbsp;146.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain was left virtually [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]], with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of a [[Anglo-American loan|$3.5&amp;nbsp;billion loan]] from the United States&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;331.&lt;/ref&gt; (${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|3500000000|1946|r=-9}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}), the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4757181.stm|title=What's a little debt between friends?|publisher=BBC News|date=10 May 2006|accessdate=20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations. The situation was complicated further by the increasing [[Cold War]] rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism. In practice, however, American [[Anti-communism|anti-Communism]] prevailed over [[anti-imperialism]], and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire where it kept Communist expansion in check.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLevine|Levine]], p.&amp;nbsp;193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;[[Wind of Change|wind of change]]&quot; ultimately meant that the British Empire's days were numbered, and on the whole, Britain adopted a policy of peaceful disengagement from its colonies once stable, non-Communist governments were available to transfer power to. This was in contrast to other European powers such as France and Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAbernethy2000|Abernethy]], p.&amp;nbsp;148.&lt;/ref&gt; which waged costly and ultimately unsuccessful wars to keep their empires intact. Between 1945 and 1965, the number of people under British rule outside the UK itself fell from 700 million to five million, three million of whom were in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;330.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial disengagement===
The pro-decolonisation [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government elected at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]] and led by [[Clement Attlee]], moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the Empire, that of [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;322.&lt;/ref&gt; India's two independence movements—the [[Indian National Congress]] and the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate [[Islamic state]] for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing [[Civil disorder|civil unrest]] and the [[Royal Indian Navy Mutiny|mutiny of]] the [[History of the Indian Navy|Royal Indian Navy]] during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]], hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&amp;nbsp;67.&lt;/ref&gt; The borders drawn by the British to broadly [[Partition of India|partition India]] into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;325.&lt;/ref&gt; Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus in the reverse direction, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the [[British Raj]], and [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Ceylon became members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], though Burma chose not to join.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMcIntyre|McIntyre]], pp.&amp;nbsp;355–356.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Mandate of Palestine]], where an Arab majority lived alongside a Jewish minority, presented the British with a similar problem to that of India.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;327.&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was complicated by large numbers of [[Jewish refugees]] seeking to be admitted to Palestine following [[Nazism|Nazi]] oppression and genocide in the Second World War. Rather than deal with the issue, Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to [[United Nations|the United Nations]] to solve,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;328.&lt;/ref&gt; which it did by voting for the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|partition of Palestine]] into a Jewish and Arab state.

Following the defeat of Japan in the Second World War, anti-Japanese [[resistance movement]]s in Malaya turned their attention towards the British, who had moved to quickly retake control of the colony, valuing it as a source of rubber and tin.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;335.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the guerrillas were primarily Malayan-Chinese Communists meant that the British attempt to quell the uprising was supported by the Muslim Malay majority, on the understanding that once the insurgency had been quelled, independence would be granted.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The [[Malayan Emergency]], as it was known, began in 1948 and lasted until 1960, but by 1957, Britain felt confident enough to grant independence to the [[Federation of Malaya]] within the Commonwealth. In 1963, the 11 states of the federation together with [[Singapore]], [[Sarawak]] and [[North Borneo|British North Borneo]] joined to form [[Malaysia]], but in 1965 Chinese-dominated [[Singapore]] was expelled from the union following tensions between the Malay and Chinese populations.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;364.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brunei]], which had been a British protectorate since 1888, declined to join the union&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;396.&lt;/ref&gt; and maintained its status until independence in 1984.

===Suez and its aftermath===
{{main|Suez Crisis}}
[[File:Eden, Anthony.jpg|thumb|upright|left|British Prime Minister [[Anthony Eden]]'s decision to invade [[Egypt]] during the [[Suez Crisis]] ended his political career and revealed Britain's weakness as an imperial power.]]
In 1951, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] was returned to power in Britain, under the leadership of [[Winston Churchill]]. Churchill and the Conservatives believed that Britain's position as a world power relied on the continued existence of the Empire, with the base at the [[Suez Canal]] allowing Britain to maintain its pre-eminent position in the Middle East in spite of the loss of India. However, Churchill could not ignore [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Gamal Abdul Nasser]]'s new revolutionary [[Politics of Egypt|government of Egypt]] that had [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|taken power in 1952]], and the following year it was agreed that British troops would withdraw from the Suez Canal zone and that [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] would become independent by 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], pp.&amp;nbsp;339–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Nasser unilaterally nationalised the Suez Canal. The response of the new British Prime Minister, [[Anthony Eden]], was to collude with France to engineer an [[Israel]]i attack on [[Egypt]] that would give Britain and France an excuse to intervene militarily and retake the canal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;581.&lt;/ref&gt; Eden infuriated his US counterpart, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], by his lack of consultation, and Eisenhower refused to back the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;355.&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Eisenhower's concerns was the possibility of a wider war with the [[Soviet Union]] after [[Nikita Khrushchev]] threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side. Eisenhower applied financial leverage by threatening to sell US reserves of the [[Pound sterling|British pound]] and thereby precipitate a collapse of the British currency.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;356.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the invasion force was militarily successful in its objective of recapturing the Suez Canal,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;583.&lt;/ref&gt; UN intervention and US pressure forced Britain into a humiliating withdrawal of its forces, and Eden resigned.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCombs2008|Combs]], pp.&amp;nbsp;161–163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suez Crisis: Key players |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5195582.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 October 2010|date=21 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Suez Crisis]] very publicly exposed Britain's limitations to the world and confirmed Britain's decline on the world stage, demonstrating that henceforth it could no longer act without at least the acquiescence, if not the full support, of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;342.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&amp;nbsp;105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBurke2008|Burke]], p.&amp;nbsp;602.&lt;/ref&gt; The events at Suez wounded British [[Patriotism|national pride]], leading one [[Member of Parliament|MP]] to describe it as &quot;Britain's [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;#refOHBEv4|Brown, p. 343&quot;&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;343.&lt;/ref&gt; and another to suggest that the country had become an &quot;American [[Satellite state|satellite]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;585.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Thatcher]] later described the mindset she believed had befallen the British political establishment as &quot;Suez syndrome&quot;, from which Britain did not recover until the successful recapture of the [[Falkland Islands]] from [[Argentina]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refThatcher|Thatcher]].&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Suez Crisis caused British power in the Middle East to weaken, it did not collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&amp;nbsp;106.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain again soon deployed its armed forces to the region, intervening in [[Oman]] (1957), [[Jordan]] (1958) and [[Kuwait]] (1961), though on these occasions with American approval,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;586.&lt;/ref&gt; as the new Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]]'s foreign policy was to remain firmly aligned with the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;#refOHBEv4|Brown, p. 343&quot;/&gt; Britain maintained a presence in the Middle East for another decade, withdrawing from [[Aden]] in 1967, and [[Bahrain]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;370–371.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind of change===
{{main|Decolonization of Africa}}
Macmillan gave a [[Wind of Change|speech]] in [[Cape Town]], South Africa in February 1960 where he spoke of &quot;the wind of change blowing through this continent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;616.&lt;/ref&gt; Macmillan wished to avoid the same kind of [[colonial war]] that France was fighting in [[Algerian War|Algeria]], and under his premiership decolonisation proceeded rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt; To the three colonies that had been granted independence in the 1950s—[[Sudan]], the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] and [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]]—were added nearly ten times that number during the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;427–433.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:British Decolonisation in Africa.png|right|thumb|British decolonisation in Africa. By the end of the 1960s, all but [[Rhodesia]] (the future Zimbabwe) and the South African mandate of [[South West Africa]] ([[Namibia]]) had achieved independence.]]
Britain's remaining colonies in Africa, except for [[Southern Rhodesia]], were all granted independence by 1968 (''see map''). British withdrawal from the southern and eastern parts of Africa was complicated by the region's white settler populations, particularly in [[Rhodesia]], where racial tensions had led [[Ian Smith]], the Prime Minister, to a [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] from the British Empire in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;618.&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodesia remained in a state of civil war between its black and white population until the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] of 1979. This agreement temporarily returned Rhodesia to British colonial rule until elections could be held under British supervision. The elections were held the following year and won by [[Robert Mugabe]], who became the Prime Minister of the newly independent state of [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], pp.&amp;nbsp;620–621.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Mediterranean, a guerrilla war waged by [[EOKA|Greek Cypriots]] ended (1960) in an independent [[Cyprus]], with the UK retaining the [[military base]]s of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]]. The [[List of islands in the Mediterranean|Mediterranean islands]] of [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]] were amicably granted independence from the UK in 1964, though the idea had been raised in 1955 of [[History of Malta#Attempted integration with the United Kingdom|integration with Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSpringhall2001|Springhall]], pp.&amp;nbsp;100–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the UK's [[Caribbean|West Indies]] territories achieved independence after the departure in 1961 and 1962 of [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad]] from the [[West Indies Federation]], established in 1958 in an attempt to unite the British Caribbean colonies under one government, but which collapsed following the loss of its two by far largest members.&lt;ref name=&quot;knight14&quot;&gt;[[#refKnight1989|Knight &amp; Palmer]], pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbados]] achieved independence in 1966 and the remainder of the eastern Caribbean islands in the 1970s and 1980s,&lt;ref name=&quot;knight14&quot;/&gt; but [[Anguilla]] and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] opted to revert to British rule after they had already started on the path to independence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refClegg2005|Clegg]], p.&amp;nbsp;128.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Virgin Islands]],&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;428.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Montserrat]] opted to retain ties with Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;622.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guyana]] achieved independence from the UK in 1966. Britain's last colony on the American mainland, [[British Honduras]], became a [[Self-governance|self-governing]] colony in 1964 and was renamed [[Belize]] in 1973, achieving full independence in 1981. A [[Guatemalan claim to Belizean territory|dispute with Guatemala]] over claims to Belize was left unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;401, 427–429.&lt;/ref&gt;

British territories in the Pacific acquired independence between 1970 ([[Fiji]]) and 1980 ([[Vanuatu]]), the latter's independence having been delayed due to political conflict between English and French-speaking communities, as the islands had been jointly administered as a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] with France.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMacdonald1994|Macdonald]], pp. 171–191.&lt;/ref&gt; Fiji, [[Tuvalu]], the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Papua New Guinea]] chose to become [[Commonwealth realm]]s.

===End of empire===
{{see also|Falklands War|Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong}}
&lt;!-- &quot;End of empire&quot; is a turn of phrase, please do not change to say &quot;the&quot; empire --&gt;
The granting of independence to Rhodesia (as Zimbabwe), the New Hebrides (as Vanuatu) in 1980, and Belize in 1981 meant that, aside from a scattering of islands and outposts (and the acquisition in 1955 of an uninhabited rock in the Atlantic Ocean, [[Rockall]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = 1955: Britain claims Rockall|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/21/newsid_4582000/4582327.stm|accessdate=13 December 2008 | date=21 September 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; the process of decolonisation that had begun after the Second World War was largely complete. In 1982, Britain's resolve to defend its remaining overseas territories was tested when [[Argentina]] [[Falklands War|invaded]] the [[Falkland Islands]], acting on a long-standing claim that dated back to the [[Spanish Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], pp.&amp;nbsp;624–625.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's ultimately successful military response to retake the islands during the ensuing [[Falklands War]] was viewed by many to have contributed to reversing the downward trend in the UK's status as a world power.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&amp;nbsp;629.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, the Canadian government severed its last legal link with Britain by [[Patriation|patriating]] the Canadian constitution from Britain. The [[Canada Act 1982|1982 Canada Act]] passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] ended the need for British involvement in changes to the Canadian constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;refohbev594&quot;&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;594.&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalent acts were passed for [[Australia Act 1986|Australia]] and [[Constitution Act 1986|New Zealand]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&amp;nbsp;689.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1982, [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] travelled to Beijing to negotiate with the Chinese government on the future of Britain's last major and most populous overseas territory, Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refBrendon|Brendon]], p.&amp;nbsp;654.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the 1842 [[Treaty of Nanking]], [[Hong Kong Island]] itself had been ceded to Britain &quot;in perpetuity&quot;, but the vast majority of the colony was constituted by the [[New Territories]], which had been acquired under a [[Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory|99 year lease in 1898]], due to expire in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJoseph2010|Joseph]], p.&amp;nbsp;355.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRothermund2006|Rothermund]], p.&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher, seeing parallels with the Falkland Islands, initially wished to hold Hong Kong and proposed British administration with Chinese sovereignty, though this was rejected by China.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refBrendon|Brendon]], pp.&amp;nbsp;654–55.&lt;/ref&gt; A deal was reached in 1984—under the terms of the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], Hong Kong would become a [[special administrative region of the People's Republic of China]], maintaining its way of life for at least 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refBrendon|Brendon]], p.&amp;nbsp;656.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hong Kong handover ceremony|handover ceremony]] in 1997 marked for many,&lt;ref&gt;[[British Empire#refBrendon|Brendon]], p.&amp;nbsp;660.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Charles, Prince of Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4740684.stm|title=Charles' diary lays thoughts bare|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 December 2008 | date=22 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was in attendance, &quot;the end of Empire&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;refohbev594&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/endofempire_overview_07.shtml|title=BBC - History - Britain, the Commonwealth and the End of Empire|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Britain retains sovereignty over 14 territories outside the British Isles, which were renamed the [[British Overseas Territories]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFAC|House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee Overseas Territories Report]], pp.&amp;nbsp;145–147&lt;/ref&gt; Some are uninhabited except for transient military or scientific personnel; the remainder are self-governing to varying degrees and are reliant on the UK for [[Diplomacy|foreign relations]] and defence. The British government has stated its willingness to assist any Overseas Territory that wishes to proceed to independence, where that is an option.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFAC|House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee Overseas Territories Report, pp.&amp;nbsp;146,153]]&lt;/ref&gt; British sovereignty of several of the overseas territories is disputed by their geographical neighbours: [[Gibraltar]] is claimed by Spain, the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] are claimed by [[Argentina]], and the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] is claimed by [[Mauritius]] and [[Seychelles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/io.html|title=British Indian Ocean Territory|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=CIA|accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Antarctic Territory]] is subject to overlapping claims by Argentina and [[Chile]], while many countries do not recognise any territorial claims to Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFAC|House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee Overseas Territories Report]], p.&amp;nbsp;136&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Location of the BOTs.svg|left|thumb|The fourteen [[British Overseas Territories]]]]
Most former British colonies are members of [[the Commonwealth]], a non-political, [[voluntary association]] of equal members. 15 members of the Commonwealth continue to share their [[head of state]] with the UK, the [[Commonwealth realm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/150757/head_of_the_commonwealth/|title=Head of the Commonwealth|publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat|accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decades, and in some cases centuries, of British rule and emigration have left their mark on the independent nations that arose from the British Empire. The Empire established the use of English in regions around the world. Today it is the primary language of up to 400 million people and is spoken by about one and a half billion as a first, second or foreign language.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHogg|Hogg]], p.&amp;nbsp;424 chapter 9 ''English Worldwide'' by [[David Crystal]]: &quot;approximately on in four of the worlds population are capable of communicating to a useful level in English.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of English from the latter half of the 20th century has been helped in part by the cultural influence of the United States, itself originally formed from British colonies. The English [[parliamentary system]] served as the template for the governments for many former colonies, and [[English law|English common law]] for legal systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;307.&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] still serves as the highest court of appeal for several former colonies in the Caribbean and Pacific. British [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] who fanned out across the globe often in advance of soldiers and [[Civil service|civil servants]] spread the [[Anglican Communion]] to all continents. British colonial [[architecture]], such as in churches, railway stations and government buildings, continues to stand in many cities that were once part of the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], pp.&amp;nbsp;238–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Individual and team sports developed in Britain—particularly [[football]], [[cricket]], [[lawn tennis]] and [[golf]]—were exported.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTorkildsen2005|Torkildsen]], p.&amp;nbsp;347.&lt;/ref&gt; The British choice of system of measurement, the [[Imperial units|imperial system]], continues to be used in some countries in various ways. The convention of [[Right- and left-hand traffic|driving on the left hand side of the road]] has been retained in much of the former Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refParsons|Parsons]], p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political boundaries drawn by the British did not always reflect homogeneous ethnicities or religions, contributing to conflicts in formerly colonised areas. The British Empire was also responsible for large migrations of peoples. Millions left the British Isles, with the founding settler populations of the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand coming mainly from Britain and Ireland. Tensions remain between the white settler populations of these countries and their indigenous minorities, and between settler minorities and indigenous majorities in South Africa and Zimbabwe.  British settlement of Ireland has left its mark in the form of divided Catholic and Protestant communities in [[Northern Ireland]]. Millions of people moved to and from British colonies, with large numbers of [[Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|Indians]] emigrating to other parts of the Empire. These include present day [[Malaysia]], [[Mauritius]], [[Fiji]], [[Guyana]], [[Trinidad]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]] and [[South Africa]]. Chinese emigration, primarily from Southern China, led to the creation of Chinese-majority Singapore and small Chinese minorities in the Caribbean. The demographics of Britain itself was changed after the Second World War due to [[Immigration to the United Kingdom since 1922#Post-war immigration (1945-1983)|immigration to Britain]] from its former colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDalziel2006|Dalziel]], p.&amp;nbsp;135.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Batman''''' is a 1989 [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] [[Batman|character of the same name]], directed by [[Tim Burton]]. The film stars [[Michael Keaton]] in the title role, as well as [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Kim Basinger]], [[Robert Wuhl]] and [[Jack Palance]]. The film, in which Batman deals with the rise of a costumed criminal known as &quot;[[Joker (comics)|The Joker]]&quot;, is the first installment of [[Warner Bros.]]' [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film series]].

After Burton was hired as director, [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Julie Hickson]] wrote [[film treatment]]s before [[Sam Hamm]] wrote the first screenplay. ''Batman'' was not [[greenlight|greenlit]] until after the success of Burton's ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988). Numerous [[A-list]] actors were considered for the role of Batman. Nicholson accepted the role of the Joker under strict conditions that dictated a high salary, a portion of the [[box office]] profits, and his shooting schedule.

Filming took place at [[Pinewood Studios]] from October 1988 to January 1989. The budget escalated from [[United States dollar|$]]30 million to $48 million, while the [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike]] forced Hamm to drop out. Uncredited rewrites were performed by [[Warren Skaaren]], [[Charles McKeown]] and [[Jonathan Gems]]. ''Batman'' was a critical and financial success, earning over $400 million in box office totals. The film received several [[Saturn Award]] nominations and a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination, and won an [[Academy Award]]. It also inspired the [[Emmy Award]]-winning ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', paving the way for the [[DC animated universe|DC Animated Universe]], and has influenced [[Hollywood]]'s modern marketing and development techniques of the [[superhero film]] genre.

==Plot==
As a child, billionaire Bruce Wayne ([[Michael Keaton]]) saw his parents murdered by a mugger. He vows to avenge their deaths in a lifelong battle against crime as the costumed vigilante [[Batman]] while concealing his secret identity behind his playboy image. By the time he begins his career as [[Gotham City]]'s protector, the city is controlled by crime boss Carl Grissom ([[Jack Palance]]). Despite the best efforts of newly-elected district attorney [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] ([[Billy Dee Williams]]) and police commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] ([[Pat Hingle]]), the [[Gotham City Police Department|police department]] remains corrupt. Reporter Alexander Knox ([[Robert Wuhl]]) and photo-journalist [[Vicki Vale]] ([[Kim Basinger]]) begin investigating the rumors of a shadowy crimefighter dressed as a bat terrorizing Gotham's criminals by night.

Vicki and Knox attend a benefit at [[Wayne Manor]], where Bruce is taken by Vicki's charms. That same night, Grissom's second in command, Jack Napier ([[Jack Nicholson]]), is sent to raid the Axis Chemicals factory. After the police receive a tip-off and arrive to arrest him, Napier realizes he has been set up by his boss, angered by his affair with Grissom's mistress. In the midst of the shoot-out, Batman arrives and takes out Napier's henchmen. Napier fires at Batman, who deflects the bullet off his steel gauntlet and sends it ricocheting back into Napier's face. Reeling from the pain, Napier topples over a platform rail but manages to grab a lower rail with one hand. Batman tries to pull Napier to safety, but loses his grip, and the criminal falls into a large vat of chemicals. Shortly thereafter, he emerges from an adjacent reservoir, his skin bleached white, his hair dyed green and his lips dyed red. Following a botched attempt at [[plastic surgery]], Napier is left with a permanent rictus grin, giving him the appearance of a [[clown]]. Driven insane by his reflection, he fashions himself as &quot;the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]&quot;, kills Grissom and takes over his empire.

The Joker holds the city at his mercy by chemically altering everyday hygiene products, causing those using a certain combination of products to [[death from laughter|laugh to death]] &amp;mdash; leaving them with a post-mortem grin resembling his own. Batman attempts to track down the Joker, who has become obsessed with Vicki, and soon realizes that his foe is the very mugger who murdered his parents. Meanwhile, Bruce's butler and confidante [[Alfred Pennyworth]] ([[Michael Gough]]) lets Vicki into the [[Batcave]], and she and Bruce promise they will try to work out their feelings for each other once the Joker is defeated.

Batman destroys the factory the Joker used to make the poisoned products. The Joker retaliates by holding a parade through Gotham, luring its citizens on to its streets by dispensing money, intending to kill them with lethal gas. Batman foils his plan, but the Joker kidnaps Vicki and takes her to the top of a cathedral church. Batman fights the Joker to save Vicki, and both realize that they are indirectly responsible for each other's transformations. As the Joker is about to escape, Batman ties his leg to a gargoyle with a grappling hook; the Joker falls to his death when the statue breaks loose of its moorings. Commissioner Gordon unveils the [[Bat-Signal]] along with a note from Batman read by Harvey Dent, promising to defend Gotham whenever crime strikes again.

===Development===
{{see|Batman in film#Tim Burton / Joel Schumacher series}}
After the financial success of ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'' (1985), Warner Bros. hired Tim Burton to direct ''Batman''. Burton had then-girlfriend [[Julie Hickson]] write a new 30-page [[film treatment]], feeling the previous script by [[Tom Mankiewicz]] was [[camp (style)|camp]]y. The success of ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns|The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'' rekindled Warner Bros.' interest in a film adaptation. Burton was initially not a comic book fan, but he was impressed by the dark and serious tone found in both ''The Dark Knight Returns'' and ''The Killing Joke''.&lt;ref name=Elfman/&gt; Warner Bros. enlisted the aid of [[Steve Englehart]] to write a new treatment in March 1986.&lt;ref name=Steve&gt;{{cite web | title = Batman | work = [[Steve Englehart]].com | url = http://www.steveenglehart.com/Film/Batman%20movie.html | accessdate = 2007-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included the Joker and [[Rupert Thorne]] as the main villains, with a [[cameo appearance]] by the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]. [[Silver St. Cloud]] and [[Dick Grayson]] were key supporting roles. It followed the similar storyline from Englehart's own ''Strange Apparitions'' (ISBN 1-56389-500-5). Warner Bros. was impressed, but Englehart felt there were too many characters. He removed the Penguin and Dick Grayson in his second treatment, finishing in May 1986.&lt;ref name=Steve/&gt;

Burton approached Sam Hamm, a comic book fan, to write the screenplay.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite news | author = Alan Jones | title = Batman | work = [[Cinefantastique]] | pages=55–67 | date = November 1989 | accessdate = 2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamm decided not to use an [[origin story]], feeling that flashbacks would be more suitable and that &quot;unlocking the mystery&quot; would become part of the storyline.&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite news | author = Taylor L. White | title = Batman | work = [[Cinefantastique]] | pages=33–40 | date = July 1989 | accessdate = 2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reasoned, &quot;You totally destroy your credibility if you show the literal process by which Bruce Wayne becomes Batman.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hamm&gt;{{cite news | author = Stephen Rebello | title = Sam Hamm - Screenwriter | work = [[Cinefantastique]] | pages=34–41 | date = November 1989 | accessdate = 2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamm replaced Silver St. Cloud with Vicki Vale and Rupert Thorne with his own creation, Carl Grissom. He completed his script in October 1986, which demoted Dick Grayson to a cameo rather than a supporting character.&lt;ref name=storm/&gt; One scene in Hamm's script had a young James Gordon on duty the night of the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents. When Hamm's script was rewritten, the scene was deleted.&lt;ref name=heroes/&gt;

Warner Bros. was less willing to move forward on development, despite their enthusiasm for Hamm's script, which Batman co-creator [[Bob Kane]] greeted with positive feedback.&lt;ref name=Elfman/&gt; Hamm's script was then [[Bootleg (comics)|bootleg]]ged at various comic book stores in the United States.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; ''Batman'' was finally given the [[greenlight]] to commence [[pre-production]] in April 1988, after the success of Burton's ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988).&lt;ref name=Elfman/&gt; When comic book fans found out about Burton directing the film with Michael Keaton starring in the lead role, controversy arose over the tone and direction ''Batman'' was going in. Hamm explained, &quot;they hear Tim Burton's name and they think of ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]''. They hear Keaton's name and they think of any number of Michael Keaton comedies. You think of the 1960s version of Batman, and it was the complete opposite of our film. We tried to market it with a typical dark and serious tone, but the fans didn't believe us.&quot;&lt;ref name=White/&gt; To combat negative reports on the film's production, Batman co-creator [[Bob Kane]] was hired as [[creative consultant]].&lt;ref name=production&gt;{{cite news | author = Alan Jones | title = ''Batman'' in Production | work = [[Cinefantastique]] | pages=75–88 | date = November 1989 | accessdate = 2008-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peters approached Nicholson as far back as 1986, during filming of ''[[The Witches of Eastwick (film)|The Witches of Eastwick]]''.&lt;ref name=empire/&gt; Nicholson had what was known as an &quot;off-the-clock&quot; agreement. His contract specified the number of hours he was entitled to have off each day, from the time he left the set to the time he reported back for filming.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; Nicholson demanded to have all of his scenes shot in a three-week block, but the schedule lapsed into 106 days.&lt;ref name=empire/&gt; He received a $6 million salary, as well as a large percentage of the [[box office]] gross. The fee is reported to be as high as $50 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamm&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guber&quot; /&gt;

[[Sean Young]] was originally cast as Vicki Vale, but was injured in a horse-riding accident prior to commencement of filming.&lt;ref name=&quot;shadows&quot;&gt;''Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight'', &quot;Part 2: The Gathering Storm&quot;, DVD documentary, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Burton suggested replacing Young with [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] but Keaton, who was in a relationship with Pfeiffer, believed it would be too awkward. She went on to portray [[Catwoman]] in ''[[Batman Returns]]''. Young's departure necessitated an urgent search for an actress who, besides being right for the part, could commit to the film at very short notice. Peters suggested [[Kim Basinger]]: she was able to join the production immediately and was cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guber&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shadows&quot;/&gt; As a fan of [[Michael Gough]]'s work in various [[Hammer Film Productions]], Burton cast Gough as Bruce Wayne's butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;audio&quot;&gt;[[Tim Burton]], DVD [[audio commentary]], 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Wuhl]] was cast as reporter Alexander Knox.

Max Eckhardt.

===Filming===
The filmmakers considered filming ''Batman'' entirely on the Warner Bros. [[backlot]] in [[Burbank, California]], but media interest in the film made them change the location. It was shot at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[England]] from October 1988 to January 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joe&quot; /&gt; 18 [[sound stage]]s were used, almost the entirety of Pinewood's 95-acre backlot.&lt;ref name=&quot;production&quot; /&gt; Locations included [[Knebworth House]] and [[Hatfield House]] doubling for [[Wayne Manor]], plus [[Acton Lane Power Station]] and [[Little Barford Power Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukonscreen.com/gkjhkbb-Batman-(1989).html |title=Batman (1989) Filming Locations |publisher=Ukonscreen.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Manor&quot;&gt;Hanke, p.87-96&lt;/ref&gt; The original production budget escalated from $30 million to $48 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guber&quot; /&gt; Filming was highly secretive. The unit [[publicist]] was offered and refused [[pound sterling|£]]10,000 for the first pictures of Jack Nicholson as the Joker. The police were later called in when two reels of footage (about 20 minutes' worth) were stolen.&lt;ref name=empire&gt;{{cite news | author = Iain Johnstone | title = Dark Knight in the City of Dreams | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | pages=46–54 | date =August 1989 | accessdate = 2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; With various problems during filming, Burton called it &quot;torture. The worst period of my life!&quot;&lt;ref name=Guber/&gt;

Hamm was not allowed to perform rewrites during the [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike]].&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; [[Jonathan Gems]], [[Warren Skaaren]] and [[Charles McKeown]] rewrote the script during filming.&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury, Burton, p.145&lt;/ref&gt; Hamm criticized the rewrites, but blamed the changes on Warner Bros.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; Burton explained, &quot;I don't understand why that became such a problem. We started out with a script that everyone liked, although we recognized it needed a little work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elfman&quot; /&gt; Dick Grayson appeared in the shooting script but was deleted, as the filmmakers felt he was irrelevant to the plot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot; /&gt; Bob Kane supported this decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;audio&quot; /&gt;

Originally in the climax, the Joker was to kill Vicki Vale, sending Batman into a vengeful fury. Jon Peters reworked the climax without telling Burton and commissioned production designer Anton Furst to create a {{convert|38|ft|m|sing=on}} model of the cathedral.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt; This cost $100,000 when the film was already well over budget. Burton disliked the idea, having no clue how the scene would end: &quot;Here were Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger walking up this cathedral, and halfway up Jack turns around and says, 'Why am I walking up all these stairs? Where am I going?' 'We'll talk about it when you get to the top!' I had to tell him that I didn't know.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Tom Stone | title = How Hollywood had the last laugh | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 2004-09-28 | accessdate = 2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===

Burton was impressed with [[Anton Furst]]'s designs in ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'', and previously failed to hire Furst as production designer for ''Beetlejuice''.&lt;ref name=Joe/&gt; Furst had been too committed on ''[[High Spirits (film)|High Spirits]]'', a choice he later regretted.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; Furst enjoyed working with Burton. &quot;I don't think I've ever felt so naturally in tune with a director,&quot; he felt. &quot;Conceptually, spiritually, visually, or artistically. There was never any problem because we never fought over anything. Texture, attitude and feelings are what [Burton] is a master at.&quot;&lt;ref name=production/&gt; 
[[File:Keaton as Batman.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The Batsuit, worn by Michael Keaton.]]
Furst and the [[art department]] deliberately mixed clashing architectural styles to &quot;make Gotham City the ugliest and bleakest [[metropolis]] imaginable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anton Furst]], [[Derek Meddings]], ''Visualizing Gotham: The Production Design of Batman'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; Furst continued, &quot;we imagined what New York City might have become without a planning commission.

In the end, we went into pure expressionism, taking the [[Bonneville Salt Flats|Salt Flat Racers]] of the 30s and the [[Chevrolet Corvette (second generation-C2)|Sting Ray macho machines]] of the 50s.&quot;&lt;ref name=empire/&gt; The car was built upon a [[Chevrolet Impala]] when previous development with a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] and [[Ford Mustang]] failed.&lt;ref name=empire/&gt;

[[Costume design]]er Bob Ringwood (''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'', ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'') turned down the chance to work on ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' in favor of ''Batman''. Ringwood found it difficult designing the [[Batsuit]] because &quot;the image of Batman in the comics is this huge, big six-foot-four hunk with a dimpled chin. Michael Keaton is a guy with average build,&quot; He stated. &quot;The problem was to make somebody who was average-sized and ordinary looking into this bigger-than-life creature.&quot;&lt;ref name=batto&gt;{{cite news | author = Jody Duncan Shannon | title = Building the Bat-suit | work = [[Cinefex]] | pages=16–24 | date = February 1990 | accessdate = 2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burton commented, &quot;Michael is a bit [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]], which made it worse for him. The costume put him in a dark, Batman-like mood though, so he was able to use it to his advantage.&quot;&lt;ref name=batto/&gt; Burton's idea was to use an all-black suit, and was met with positive feedback by Bob Kane. Jon Peters wanted to use a [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] [[product placement]] with the Batsuit.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Ringwood, [[Tim Burton]], ''Designing the Batsuit'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ringwood studied over 200 comic book issues for inspiration. 28 sculpted latex designs were created; 25 different cape looks and 6 different heads were made, accumulating a total cost of $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.amctv.com/future_of_classic/2007/06/reinventing-the.html | title = Reinventing the Batsuit for the Modern Era | work = [[AMC (TV network)|American Movies Classic]] | accessdate = 2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comic book fans initially expressed negative feedback against the Batsuit.&lt;ref name=Joe/&gt; Burton opted not to use tights, spandex or underpants as seen in the comic book, feeling it was not intimidating.&lt;ref name=Elfman/&gt; [[Prosthetic makeup]] designer Nick Dudman ([[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]], ''[[Legend (film)|Legend]]'') used [[acrylic paint]] for Nicholson's chalk-white face.

===Music===
{{See also|Batman (album)|Batman (score)}}
Burton hired [[Danny Elfman]], his collaborator on ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' and ''Beetlejuice'', to compose the music score. For inspiration Elfman was given ''The Dark Knight Returns''. Elfman was worried, as he never had worked on a production this large in budget and scale.&lt;ref name=overtures&gt;[[Danny Elfman]], [[Tim Burton]], ''Nocturnal Overtures: The Music of Batman'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, producer Jon Peters was skeptical of hiring Elfman, but was later convinced when he heard the opening number.&lt;ref name=reborn/&gt; Peters and Peter Guber wanted [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] to write music for the Joker and [[Michael Jackson]] to do the romance songs. Elfman would then combine the style of Prince and Jackson's songs together for the entire film score.&lt;ref name=Elfman/&gt;

Burton protested the ideas, citing &quot;my movies aren't commercial like ''[[Top Gun (film)|Top Gun]]''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Elfman/&gt; Elfman enlisted the help of [[Oingo Boingo]] lead guitarist [[Steve Bartek]] and [[Shirley Walker]] to arrange the compositions for the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The Elfman Cometh | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| date=1990-02-23| url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316794,00.html| accessdate=2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elfman later was displeased with the [[Audio mixing (film and television)|audio mixing]] of his film score. &quot;''Batman'' was done in England by technicians who didn't care, and the non-caring showed,&quot; he stated. &quot;I'm not putting down England because they've done gorgeous [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubs]] there, but this particular crew elected not to.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Judy Sloane | title = Elfman on scoring | work = Film Review | page=77 | date = August 1995 | accessdate = 2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Batman'' was one of the first films to spawn two soundtracks. One of them featured songs written by Prince while the other showcased Elfman's score. Both were successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Stephen Holden]] | title = The Pop Life | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1989-07-19 | accessdate = 2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compilations of Elfman's [[opening credits]] were used in the [[title sequence]] theme for ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', also composed by Shirley Walker.&lt;ref name=reboot/&gt;

==Themes==
[[Image:MikeandJack.jpg|thumb|210px|&quot;The duel of the freaks&quot;&lt;ref name=Elfman/&gt;]]
When discussing the central [[theme (arts)|theme]] of ''Batman'', director Tim Burton explained, &quot;the whole film and mythology of the character is a complete duel of the freaks. It's a fight between two disturbed people.&quot; He continued, &quot;The Joker is such a great character because there's a complete freedom to him. Any character who operates on the outside of society and is deemed a freak and an outcast then has the freedom to do what they want... They are the darker sides of freedom. Insanity is in some scary way the most freedom you can have, because you're not bound by the laws of society.&quot;&lt;ref name=Elfman&gt;{{cite book | author=Mark Salisbury | coauthors = [[Tim Burton]] | title =Burton on Burton | publisher =Faber and Faber | year =2006 | location = London | pages =70–83 | isbn = 0-571-22926-3 | chapter = Batman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton saw Bruce Wayne as two people at one time and a symbol of America. Bruce has pretense of appearing to be one image, while hiding the reality from the world.&lt;ref name=Elfman/&gt; Burton biographer Ken Hanke wrote that Bruce Wayne, struggling with his alter-ego as Batman, is depicted as an [[antihero]]. Hanke felt that Batman has to push the boundaries of civil justice to deal with certain criminals, such as the Joker.&lt;ref name=forever/&gt; [[Kim Newman]] theorized that &quot;Burton and the writers saw Batman and the Joker as a dramatic antithesis, and the film deals with their intertwined origins and fates to an even greater extent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Kim Newman]] | title = Batman | work = [[Monthly Film Bulletin]] | pages=61–64 | date = September 1989 | accessdate = 2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[motif (visual arts)|visual motif]] is present in the scene of Batman's first major act of vigilantism at [[Axis Chemicals]]. He is carefully framed so that the single word AXIS, in gigantic red neon letters, looms over him. This parallels his actions and those of the [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] governments of [[World War II]]. The dangers inherent in these actions include the transformation of Jack Napier into the Joker.&lt;ref name=forever&gt;{{cite book | author= Ken Hanke | title =Tim Burton: An Unauthorized Biography of the Filmmaker | publisher =[[Renaissance Books]] | year =1999 | location = | pages =75–85 | isbn = 1-58063-162-2 | chapter = Going Batty in Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Batman'' also conveys trademarks found in 1930s [[pulp magazine]]s, notably the design of Gotham City stylized with [[Art Deco]] design.&lt;ref name=Hal&gt;{{cite news | author = Hal Hinson | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 1989-06-23 | title = Batman | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/batmanpg13hinson_a07fb8.htm | accessdate = 2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Corliss]], writing for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', observed that Gotham's design was a reference to films such as ''[[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927) and ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920). &quot;Gotham City, despite being shot on a studio [[backlot]],&quot; he continued, &quot;is literally another character in the script. It has the demeaning presence of [[German Expressionism]] and [[fascist architecture]], staring down at the citizens.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Richard Corliss]] | title = Murk in The Myth | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957972,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 1989-06-19 | accessdate = 2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanke further addressed the notions of ''Batman'' being a [[period piece]]. &quot;The citizens, cops, people and the [[black-and-white]] television looks like it takes place in 1939.&quot; However, Hanke later said. &quot;Had the filmmakers made [[Vicki Vale]] a [[femme fatale]] rather than a [[damsel in distress]], this could have made ''Batman'' as a homage and tribute to classic [[film noir]].&lt;ref name=Manor&gt;Hanke, p.87-96&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] pay homage to ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.&lt;ref name=cartoon/&gt;

==Marketing==
Production designer Anton Furst designed the poster, which he called &quot;evocative but ubiquitous. Only featuring the Bat-Symbol. Not too much and not too little.&quot; Earlier designs &quot;had the word 'Batman' spelled in ''[[RoboCop]]'' or ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''-type font.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guber&quot;/&gt; Jon Peters unified all the film's [[tie-in]]s, even turning down $6 million from [[General Motors]] to build the [[Batmobile]] because the car company would not relinquish creative control.&lt;ref name=Guber/&gt;

During production, Peters read in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that comic book fans were unsatisfied with the casting of Michael Keaton. In response, Peters rushed the first [[film trailer]] that played in thousands of theaters during Christmas. It was simply an assemblage of scenes without music, but happened to create enormous anticipation for the film.&lt;ref name=Guber/&gt; [[DC Comics]] allowed screenwriter Sam Hamm to write his own [[limited series|comic book miniseries]]. Hamm's stories were collected in the [[graphic novel]] ''Batman: Blind Justice'' (ISBN 978-1563890475). [[Denys Cowan]] and [[Dick Giordano]] illustrated the artwork.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamm&quot;/&gt; ''Blind Justice'' tells the story of Bruce Wayne trying to solve a series of murders connected to [[Wayne Enterprises]]. It also marks the first appearance of [[Henri Ducard]], who was later used in the [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed ''[[Batman Begins]]'', albeit as an alias for the more notable [[Ra's al Ghul]].&lt;ref name=Hamm/&gt;

In the months pre-dating ''Batman''{{'}}s release in June 1989, a [[popular culture]] phenomenon rose known as &quot;Batmania&quot;.&lt;ref name=Joe&gt;{{cite news | author = Joe Morgenstern | title = Tim Burton, Batman and The Joker | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1989-04-09 | accessdate = 2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over $750 million worth of merchandise was sold.&lt;ref name=&quot;reboot&quot;/&gt; [[Cult film]]maker and comic book writer [[Kevin Smith]] remembered, &quot;That summer was huge. You couldn't turn around without seeing the Bat-Signal somewhere. People were cutting it into their fucking heads. It was just the summer of Batman and if you were a comic book fan it was pretty hot.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Smith]], ''[[An Evening with Kevin Smith]]'', 2002, [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hachette Book Group USA]] published a [[novelization]], written by [[Craig Shaw Gardner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.com/dp/0446363030 | title = Batman: The Novelization (Mass Market Paperback) | work = [[Amazon.com]] | accessdate = 2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] throughout June 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Paperback Best Sellers: June 18, 1989 | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1989-06-18 | accessdate = 2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burton admitted he was annoyed by the publicity. David Handelman of ''[[The New York Observer]]'' categorized ''Batman'' as a [[high concept]] film. He believed &quot;it is less movie than a corporate [[behemoth]].&quot;&lt;ref name=cartoon&gt;{{cite book | author = Alison McMahan | title =The Films of Tim Burton: Animating Live Action in Contemporary Hollywood | publisher = [[Gale (Cengage)|Gale]] | year =2005 | location = [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]] | pages = | isbn = 0-8264-1566-0 121-156 | chapter = Burton's Batman: Myth, Marketing, and Merchandising }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reaction===
''Batman'' was criticized in some quarters for being &quot;too dark&quot;.&lt;ref name=Elfman/&gt; Many observed that Burton was more interested in the Joker than Batman in terms of characterization and screentime.&lt;ref name=Elfman/&gt; Comic book fans reacted negatively over the Joker murdering [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne]]; in the comic book, [[Joe Chill]] is responsible. Writer Sam Hamm, who is a comic book fan, said it was Burton's idea to have the Joker murder Wayne's parents. &quot;The Writer's Strike was going on,&quot; Hamm said, &quot;and Tim had the other writers do that. I also hold innocent to Alfred letting Vicki Vale into the [[Batcave]]. Fans were ticked off with that, and I agree. That would have been Alfred's last day of employment at [[Wayne Manor]].&quot;&lt;ref name=reborn&gt;[[Tim Burton]], [[Sam Hamm]], [[Danny Elfman]], ''Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight&amp;mdash;The Legend Reborn'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The songs written by Prince were criticized for being &quot;too out of place&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot;/&gt; While Burton has stated he had no problem with the Prince songs, he was less enthusiastic with their use in the film.&lt;ref name=forever/&gt; On the film, Burton remarked, &quot;I liked parts of it, but the whole movie is mainly boring to me. It's OK, but it was more of a cultural phenomenon than a great movie.&quot;&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; Nonetheless, the film received generally favorable reviews from critics. Based on 52 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 71% of reviewers have enjoyed ''Batman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1001781-batman/ | title = Batman | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = 2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, [[Metacritic]] has collected an average score of 66, based on 17 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/movie/batman | title = Batman (1989): Reviews | work = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate = 2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton biographer Alison McMahan wrote, &quot;fans of the ''Batman'' franchise complained when they heard of Michael Keaton's casting. However, no one complained when they saw his performance.&quot;&lt;ref name=cartoon/&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] called the film entertaining, with the highlight being the production design. However, he concluded, &quot;the best thing that can be said about ''Batman'' is that it led to ''[[Batman Returns]]'', which was a far superior effort.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[James Berardinelli]] | url = http://www.reelviews.net/movies/b/batman.html | title = Batman (1989) | work = [http://www.reelviews.net/ ReelViews] | date = 2001-06-05 | accessdate = 2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' felt &quot;Jack Nicholson stole every scene&quot; but still greeted the film with positive feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117788899.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 | title = Batman | date = 1989-01-01 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] was highly impressed with the production design, but claimed &quot;''Batman'' is a triumph of design over story, style over substance, a great-looking movie with a plot you can't care much about.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19890623/REVIEWS/906230301/1023 | title = Batman | publisher = [[Roger Ebert]] | accessdate = 2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reviewing partner, [[Gene Siskel]], disagreed, however, describing the film as having a 'refreshingly adult' approach with performances, direction and set design that 'draws you into a psychological world'. [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' called it &quot;watchable enough&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] | url = http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/769_BATMAN_AAA_burton | title = Batman | work = [[Chicago Reader]] |date = 1989-06-23 | accessdate = 2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===

The film was nominated the [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html | title = Past Saturn Awards | work = [[Saturn Awards]].org | accessdate = 2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thehugoawards.org/index.php?s=Batman | title = 1990 Hugo Awards | work = The [[Hugo Award]]s | accessdate = 2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of ''Batman'' prompted [[Warner Bros. Animation]] to create the [[Emmy Award]]-winning ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', as a result beginning the long-running [[DC animated universe|DC Animated Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[Paul Dini]]; [[Chip Kidd]]| title =[[Batman Animated]] | publisher = [[Titan Books]] | year = 1998 | page = 2 | isbn = 1-84023-016-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series co-creator [[Bruce Timm]] stated the television show's [[Art Deco]] design was inspired from the film. Timm commented, &quot;our show would never have gotten made if it hadn't been for that first ''Batman'' movie.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[Bruce Timm]]; Erick Nolen-Weathington| title =Modern Masters Volume 3: Bruce Timm | publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]] | year = 2004 | pages = 38–49 | isbn = 1893905306}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Batman'' initiated the original [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film series]] and helped establish the modern day [[superhero film]] genre. Burton joked, &quot;ever since I did ''Batman'', it was like the first dark comic book movie. Now everyone wants to do a dark and serious superhero movie. I guess I'm the one responsible for that trend.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Geoff Boucher | title = Tim Burton talks about Johnny Depp, 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'The Dark Knight' | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 2008-10-15 | accessdate = 2008-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers [[Michael Uslan]] and [[Benjamin Melniker]] filed a [[breach of contract]] lawsuit in [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors|Los Angeles County Superior Court]] on March 26, 1992. Uslan and Melniker claimed to be &quot;the victims of a sinister campaign of fraud and coercion that has cheated them out of continuing involvement in the production of ''Batman'' and its sequels. We were denied proper credits, and deprived of any financial rewards for our indispensable creative contribution to the success of ''Batman''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Guber/&gt; A [[superior court]] judge rejected the lawsuit. Total revenues of ''Batman'' have topped $2 billion, with Uslan claiming to have &quot;not seen a penny more than that since our [[net profit]] participation has proved worthless.&quot;&lt;ref name=Guber/&gt; Warner Bros. offered the pair an out-of-court pay-off, a sum described by Uslan and Melniker's attorney as &quot;two popcorns and two [[Coca-Cola|Coke]]s&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Olly Richards (September 1992). &quot;Trouble in Gotham&quot;, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', pp. 21-23. Retrieved on 2008-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting on the twentieth anniversary of its release in a retrospective article on [[Salon.com]], film commentator Scott Mendelson noted that continuing impact that ''Batman'' has had on the motion film industry, including the increasing importance of opening weekend box office receipts; the narrowing window between a film's debut and its video release that caused the demise of second-run movie theaters; the accelerated acquisition of pre-existing, pre-sold properties for film adaptation that can be readily leveraged for merchandizing tie-ins; the primacy of the [[MPAA]] [[PG-13]] as the target rating for film producers; and more off-beat, non-traditional casting opportunities for genre films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Scott Mendelson | title=20 years later, how Batman changed the movie business... | url=http://open.salon.com/blog/scott_mendelson/2009/06/24/20_years_later_how_batman_changed_the_movie_business | work= | publisher=Salon.com | date=June 24, 2009@ 10:38 AM | accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film also received recognition from the [[American Film Institute]]. Batman was anointed the 46th greatest movie hero on AFI's ''[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246&lt;/ref&gt; The Joker was anointed the 45th greatest movie villain on the same list. In 2008, ''Batman'' was selected by [[Empire Magazine]] as number 458 of ''The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/500/8.asp |title=Empire Features |publisher=Empireonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home video===
Many versions of the film have been released. Included are [[VHS]], [[Laserdisc]], single disc [[DVD]], Special Edition DVD and an anthology set. The ''Batman: The Motion Picture Anthology'' released in 2005 included 2-Disc Special Edition DVDs of the Tim Burton/[[Joel Schumacher]] Batman films. This anthology set was re-released on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] on March 10, 2009.

On May 19, 2009 a 20th anniversary stand-alone edition was released. This stand-alone version contains exactly the same special features as its anthology set (both DVD and Blu-ray) counterparts. There are two differences: This version includes a 50-page booklet guide to the film, and a slight variation in packaging from normal Blu-ray cases (Warner Bros. *Digibook*) They both include a digital copy of the film.

'''''Batman''''', often promoted as '''''Batman: The Movie''''', is a 1966 film based on the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, and the first full-length theatrical adaptation of the [[DC Comics]] [[Batman|character of the same name]]. Released by [[20th Century Fox]], the film starred [[Adam West]] as Batman and [[Burt Ward]] as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. The film was directed by [[Leslie H. Martinson]], who also directed a pair of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' episodes; &quot;The Penguin Goes Straight&quot; and &quot;Not Yet, He Ain't&quot;, both from season one.

The cast includes members of the original TV cast, including [[Alan Napier]], [[Neil Hamilton (actor)|Neil Hamilton]], [[Stafford Repp]] and [[Madge Blake]]. Appearing as the criminal characters that they played on TV (and given the name the Rogues Gallery of Villains) are [[Frank Gorshin]] as the Riddler, [[Burgess Meredith]] as the Penguin, and [[Cesar Romero]] as the Joker. [[Julie Newmar]], who left the movie before production started to do other work, is replaced with [[Lee Meriwether]] as Catwoman.

==Plot==
When Batman ([[Adam West|West]]) and Robin ([[Burt Ward|Ward]]) get a tip that Commodore Schmidlapp (the final role of actor [[Reginald Denny (actor)|Reginald Denny]]) is in danger aboard his [[yacht]], they launch a rescue mission using the [[Batcopter]]. After a tangle with an exploding shark which seizes Batman's leg but is repelled by shark repellent after the Yacht disappears, Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office where, through deduction and wisdom, they figure out that the tip was a set-up by The United Underworld, a gathering of four of the most powerful villains in [[Gotham City]] (Joker, Penguin, Riddler and Catwoman), who plan to defeat The Dynamic Duo once and for all.

Armed with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust, a [[World War II]] &quot;Pre-Atomic&quot; Submarine made to resemble a [[penguin]], and their three [[pirate]] henchmen (Bluebeard, Morgan and Quetch), The United Underworld intends to take over the world, and Batman and Robin must stop them. It is revealed the ship was really a projection. When the Dynamic Duo go back to the buoy with the projector on it, they are trapped on it by a magnet and torpedos are launched at them, but they escape using a radio-detonator to destroy two of the missiles, and a porpoise is hit by the last one. Catwoman, disguised as the Soviet journalist &quot;Miss KITKA&quot; (short for Kitanya Irenia Tatanya Kerenska Alisoff), lures Bruce Wayne into a trap as part of a plot to destroy Batman, little suspecting that Wayne is Batman's alter-ego. And Penguin even schemes his way into the [[Batcave]] along with five dehydrated henchmen; this plan fails - the henchmen are unexpectedly killed when he mistakenly uses [[Heavy water|heavy water]] to re-hydrate them.

Ultimately the Duo are unable to prevent the [[kidnapping]] of the [[dehydrate]]d [[United Nations Security Council|United World Organization's Security Council]]. After giving chase in the [[Batboat]], the Caped Crusader and Boy Wonder use a [[sound|sonic]] [[charge (physics)|charge]] weapon called &quot;Bat-Charges&quot; to disable Penguin's submarine and bring it to the [[surface]], where a grand fist fight ensues. Although Commodore Schmidlapp sneezes on and scatters the powdered members of the dehydrated Council, mixing them together &amp;ndash; which would normally spell their doom &amp;ndash; Batman constructs an elaborate filter to separate the mingled dust.

Robin poses the question whether it might not be in the world's best interests for them to alter the dust samples so that humans can no longer harm one another. In response, Batman says that they cannot do so and can only hope for people, in general, to learn to live together peacefully on their own.

However, in the final scene, Robin's wishes are ironically fulfilled when the [[Security Council]] is improperly re-hydrated. All of the members are alive and well, continuing to squabble among themselves and totally oblivious of their surroundings. But each of them now speaks the language - and displays the stereotypical mannerisms - of a nation other than their own. As the world looks on in disbelief at this development, Batman and Robin quietly climb out of the [[United Nations Headquarters|United World Headquarters]] to an uncertain future. Batman's final words express his sincere hope that this &quot;mixing of minds&quot; does more good than it does harm.

==Production==
{{Ref improve section|date=March 2010}}
[[William Dozier]] wanted to make a big-screen film to generate interest in his proposed [[Batman]] TV series, to have the feature in theaters while the first season of the series was rolling before the cameras. The studio, [[20th Century Fox]], refused because while a network would have to cover the entire cost of a movie, they would only have to share the cost of a TV series (a much less risky proposition).&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Bob, &quot;Batman: Making the Original Movie&quot;, ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', Volume 24, #6/Vol. 25, #1 (double issue), February 1994, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; So it was not filmed until the end of the first season of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' the TV series (between April 25 and May 31, 1966 at an estimated $1,377,800). This movie featured four criminals from the show, including the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] ([[Cesar Romero]]), [[Riddler]] ([[Frank Gorshin]]), [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] ([[Burgess Meredith]]), and [[Catwoman]] ([[Lee Meriwether]]). It was written by series writer [[Lorenzo Semple, Jr.]] and directed by series director [[Leslie H. Martinson]], who won a [[Giffoni Film Festival|Golden Gryphon]].

===Tone===
Like the television series, the movie featured saturated colors, [[camp (style)|campy]] [[dialogue]] and special effects, and exaggeration in acting performances, as well as the occasional breaking of the [[fourth wall]], effectively being a [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[parody]].

Though it is often described (like many contemporary shows) as a parody of a popular comic-book character, some commentators believe that its comedy is not so tightly confined. Some commentators felt the film's depiction of the Caped Crusader &quot;captured the feel of the contemporary comics perfectly&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/batman-66.html Stomp Tokyo Video Reviews - Batman (1966)]. Retrieved 2011-01-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was, they remind us, made at a time when &quot;the Batman of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age comics]] was already essentially neutered&quot;.&lt;ref name=Groucho&gt;[http://www.grouchoreviews.com/index.php?module=Movie_Reviews&amp;func=display&amp;id=2125 GrouchoReviews.com Review of 'Batman'].{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain elements verge into direct parody of the history of Batman. The movie, like the TV series, is strongly influenced by the comparatively obscure 1940s serials of Batman, such as the escapes done almost out of luck.&lt;ref name=Groucho/&gt; The penchant for giving devices a &quot;Bat-&quot; prefix, and the dramatic use of stylized title cards during fight scenes, acknowledge some of the conventions that the character had accumulated in various media. However, the majority of ''Batman''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; campier moments can be read as a broader parody on contemporary mid-1960s culture in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/B/htmlB/batman/batman.htm |title=Museum of Broadcast Communication's entry on the parent TV show |publisher=Museum.TV |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vehicles===
[[Image:1960s Batmobile (FMC).jpg|thumb|right|The Batmobile as seen in the 1960s ''Batman'' TV series.]]
Besides the [[Batmobile]], other vehicles used by The Dynamic Duo:
*[[Batcycle]] with side car
*[[Batboat]], provided by [[Glastron]]
*[[Batcopter]]

Of the three new Batvehicles which first appeared in the ''Batman'' film, only the [[Batcycle]] properly crossed over into the [[Batman (TV series)|TV series]], as the budgetary limits of the TV series precluded the full use of the others. Whilst the [[Batcopter]] and [[Batboat]] from the movie did appear briefly in episodes (including a use of the Batboat in the conclusion of the first post-film two-parter: &quot;[[Walk the Straight and Narrow]]&quot;), they primarily appeared in the form of scenes from the film intercut into the series.

==Release==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
The 105-minute ''Batman'' opened at [[The Paramount Theatre (Austin, Texas)|The Paramount Theatre]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on Saturday, July 30, 1966 (between the first and second seasons of the [[Batman (TV series)|TV series]]); it was moderately successful at the box office.

The movie later had its nationwide television debut as ''[[The ABC Sunday Night Movie]]'', at 9:00 Eastern/8:00 Central, on July 4, 1971.

The film was in released on VHS in 1985 by [[CBS/Fox Video|Playhouse Video]], in 1989 by [[CBS/Fox Video]], and in 1994 by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|Fox Video]]. On August 21, 2001 this film was released on DVD; it was re-released July 1, 2008 on DVD and on Blu-ray for the 42nd anniversary of the film's release and to take advantage of ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight's]]'' release on July 18. The Blu-ray added several features in addition to those found on the original DVD. However, the 2008 DVD is identical to the 2001 release, except for the disk artwork, which had a darker feel than the 2001 release and did not include Robin, probably to tie in with ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''.

==Reception==
''Batman: The Movie'' has received positive reviews over the years, with an 82% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_the_movie/ | title=Batman: The Movie | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Gibron of Filmcritic.com gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and commented that &quot;unlike other attempts at bringing these characters to life...the TV cast really captures the inherent insanity of the roles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/Batman-%281966%29 |title=AMC Filmcritic – Batman (1966) Review |publisher=Filmcritic.com |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine stated on their review that &quot;the intense innocent enthusiasm of Cesar Romero, Burgess Meredith and Frank Gorshin as the three criminals is balanced against the innocent calm of Adam West and Burt Ward, Batman and Robin respectively.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117788898.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 |title=Variety Reviews - Batman - Film Reviews |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |date=1965-12-31 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Batman Returns''''' is a 1992 American [[superhero film]] directed by [[Tim Burton]]. Based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]], it is the sequel to Burton's ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989), and features [[Michael Keaton]] reprising the title role, with [[Danny DeVito]] as the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] and [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as [[Catwoman]].

Burton originally did not want to direct a sequel because of his mixed emotions toward the previous film. [[Daniel Waters (writer)|Daniel Waters]] delivered a script that satisfied Burton; [[Wesley Strick]] did an uncredited rewrite, deleting the character of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and rewriting the [[climax (narrative)|climax]]. Filming started at [[Burbank, California]] in June 1991. ''Batman Returns'' was released to financial and critical success, though it caused some controversy for being darker than its predecessor.

==Plot==
A deformed baby boy is thrown into [[Gotham City]]'s river by his horrified parents. Thirty-three years later, the child, Oswald Cobblepot, resurfaces as the hideous [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] ([[Danny DeVito]]), who blackmails Max Shreck ([[Christopher Walken]]) into helping him discover the identity of his parents. When the Penguin's plight becomes news, Shreck hatches a plan to recall Gotham City's current mayor and elect Cobblepot in his place, in order to cement his control over the city and complete the power plant project he has been working on. [[Batman]] ([[Michael Keaton]]) is unconvinced by the Penguin, believing that he and his gang are responsible for several child murders. Meanwhile, Shreck throws his secretary, Selina Kyle ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]), from the top of his company's building when she discovers the true nature of his plans: to build a super [[power station]] and drain Gotham of its electricity.

Resuscitated by a group of cats, Selina returns home and designs a new costume, becoming [[Catwoman]]. Selina, meanwhile, is being romanced by Batman's alter-ego [[Bruce Wayne]], a situation complicated by Catwoman's teaming with the Penguin in an effort to rid Gotham of Batman. When Batman exposes the Penguin's villainous ways, thereby ruining his political chances, the Penguin mounts an attack to kill all of Gotham's first-born infants. Batman foils his scheme and Catwoman, after killing Shreck, is presumed dead. The Penguin, having been wounded during his fight with Batman, dies from his injuries. Some time later, Bruce is driving around the city at night with butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]] ([[Michael Gough]]), thinking he sees Selina's shadow on a wall. Alfred stops the car and Bruce searches for Selina in vain. He does find Selina's cat, however, which he takes with him and leaves. The camera then pans up to the top of the city, amidst the sky scrapers. As the [[Bat-Signal]] lights up the night sky, Catwoman emerges from a rooftop, gazing at it.

==Cast==
* [[Michael Keaton]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]: Continuing his quest as [[Gotham City]]'s sole protector, in his wake he meets Selina Kyle, and clashes with new anti-heroine Catwoman. His situation becomes complicated due to the arrival of a mysterious &quot;Penguin-like Man&quot; spotted throughout Gotham.
* [[Danny DeVito]] as [[Penguin (comics)|Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin]]: Abandoned at birth due to his hideous appearance by his aristocratic parents, he spends his life living in the sewers of Gotham City. His real intentions are to dispose of every first born son in Gotham City out of vengeance against his parents for abandoning him as a child.
* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]]: Formerly a quiet and shy secretary for Max Shreck, Selina transforms into Catwoman after an attempt on her life. She becomes a romantic interest for Bruce Wayne and a deadly adversary for Batman. She has [[Cat#History and mythology|nine lives]], manifesting as a supernatural ability to live through mortal injuries eight times.
* [[Christopher Walken]] as Max Shreck: A powerful business mogul who serves as the boss of Selina Kyle and unusual ally to the Penguin.
* [[Michael Gough]] as [[Alfred Pennyworth]]: Bruce Wayne's faithful butler.
* [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as The Mayor: Gotham's unpopular Mayor whose position is challenged by the Penguin at the urging of Max Shreck.
* [[Cristi Conaway]] as The Ice Princess: A holiday themed beauty queen who is kidnapped and eventually killed by the Penguin.
* [[Andrew Bryniarski]] as &quot;Chip&quot; Shreck: Max Shreck's son and right-hand man.
* [[Pat Hingle]] as [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]]: Police Commissioner of Gotham City.

[[Vincent Schiavelli]] and [[Anna Katarina]] portray the Penguin's assistants. [[Paul Reubens]] and [[Diane Salinger]], who both appeared in Burton's ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'', have [[cameo appearance]]s as the Penguin's parents, while [[Elizabeth Sanders]], the wife of Batman co-creator [[Bob Kane]], cameos as a Gotham citizen.

==Production==
===Development===
After the success of ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', [[Warner Bros.]] was hoping for a sequel to start filming in May 1990 at [[Pinewood Studios]]. They spent $250,000 storing the sets from the first film. [[Tim Burton]] had mixed emotions from the previous film. &quot;I will return if the sequel offers something new and exciting&quot;, he said in 1989. &quot;Otherwise it's a most-dumbfounded idea.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Jones (November 1989). &quot;Batman in Production&quot;, ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', pp. 75—88. Retrieved on 2008-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Burton decided to direct ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' for [[20th Century Fox]]. Meanwhile, [[Sam Hamm]] from the previous film delivered the first two drafts of the script, while [[Bob Kane]] was brought back as a creative consultant.&lt;ref name=cinema&gt;[[Tim Burton]], [[Sam Hamm]], [[Denise Di Novi]], [[Daniel Waters (writer)|Daniel Waters]], ''Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight—The Dark Side of the Knight'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hamm's script had [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] and [[Catwoman]] going after hidden treasure.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt;

Burton was impressed with [[Daniel Waters (writer)|Daniel Waters]]' work on ''[[Heathers]]''; Burton originally brought Waters aboard on a sequel to ''[[Beetlejuice]]''. Warner Bros. then granted Burton a large amount of creative control, demoting producers [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]] to [[executive producer]]s. Dissatisfied with the Hamm script, Burton commissioned a rewrite from Waters.&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt;&lt;ref name=beetle&gt;Judy Sloane (August 1995). &quot;Daniel Waters on Writing&quot;, ''Film Review'', pp. 67—69. Retrieved on 2008-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forever/&gt; Waters &quot;came up with a social satire that had an evil mogul backing a bid for the Mayor's office by the Penguin&quot;, Waters reported. &quot;I wanted to show that the true villains of our world don't necessarily wear costumes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; The [[plot device]] of Penguin running for Mayor came from [[Batman (TV series)|the 1960s TV series]] episodes &quot;Hizzoner the Penguin&quot; and &quot;Dizzoner the Penguin&quot;.&lt;ref name=Mad&gt;Jeffrey Resner (August 1992). &quot;Three Go Mad in Gotham&quot;, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', pp. 39—46. Retrieved on 2008-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Waters wrote a total of five drafts.&lt;ref name=forever&gt;{{cite book | author= Ken Hanke | title = Tim Burton: An Unauthorized Biography of the Filmmaker | publisher =[[Renaissance Books]] | year =1999 | pages =117–122 | isbn = 1-58063-162-2 | chapter = Batman on Burton's Terms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the characterization of Catwoman, Waters explained &quot;Sam Hamm went back to the way comic books in general treat women, like fetishy sexual fantasy. I wanted to start off just at the lowest point in society, a very beaten down secretary.&quot;&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt; [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] appeared in early drafts of the script, but was deleted. Waters quoted, &quot;Sam Hamm definitely planned that. I flirted with it, having Harvey start to come back and have one scene of him where he flips a coin and it's the good side of the coin, deciding not to do anything, so you had to wait for the next movie.&quot;&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt; In early scripts Max Shreck was the &quot;[[elitism|golden boy]]&quot; of the Cobblepot family, whereas Penguin was the deformed outsider. It turned out that Shreck would be the Penguin's long-lost brother.&lt;ref name=villain&gt;[[Daniel Waters (writer)|Daniel Waters]], [[Alex Ross]], ''Batman Returns: Villains'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; Max Shreck was also a reference to actor [[Max Schreck]], known for his role as [[Count Orlok]] in ''[[Nosferatu]]''.&lt;ref name=forever/&gt;

Burton hired [[Wesley Strick]] to do an uncredited rewrite. Strick recalled, &quot;When I was hired to write ''Batman Returns'' (''Batman II'' at the time), the big problem of the script was Penguin's lack of a 'master plan'.&quot;&lt;ref name=stick&gt;{{cite book | author=David Hughes | title =Comic Book Movies | publisher =[[Virgin Books]] | year =2003 | pages =33–46 | isbn = 0753507676| chapter = Batman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros. presented Strick with warming or freezing [[Gotham City]] (later to be used in ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]''). Strick gained inspiration from a [[Moses]] parallel that had Penguin killing the firstborn sons of Gotham. A similar notion was used when the Penguin's parents threw him into a river as a baby.&lt;ref name=stick/&gt; [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] appeared in the script, but was deleted due to too many characters. Waters feels Robin is &quot;the most worthless character in the world, especially with [Batman as] the loner of loners.&quot; Robin started out as a [[punk ideologies|juvenile gang leader]], who becomes an ally to Batman. Robin was later changed to a black teenager who's also a garage mechanic.&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt; Waters explained, &quot;He's wearing this old-fashioned garage mechanic uniform and it has an 'R' on it. He drives the [[Batmobile]], which I notice they used in the [[Batman Forever|third film]]!&quot;&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt; [[Marlon Wayans]] was cast, and signed for a sequel. The actor had attended a wardrobe fitting, but it was decided to save the character for a third installment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Nathan Rabin | url = http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23240 | title = Wayans world | work = [[The A.V.

[[Michael Keaton]] returned after a significant increase in his salary at $10 million. [[Annette Bening]] was cast as [[Catwoman]] after Burton saw her performance in ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'', but dropped out due to pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308195,00.html | title = ''Batman 3'' | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1993-10-01 | accessdate = 2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raquel Welch]], [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], [[Lena Olin]], [[Ellen Barkin]], [[Cher]], [[Bridget Fonda]] and [[Susan Sarandon]] were then in competition for the role.&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,315097,00.html | title = Big-Game Hunting | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1991-08-09 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sean Young]], who was originally cast as [[Vicki Vale]] in the first film, believed the role should have gone to her. Young visited production offices dressed in a homemade Catwoman costume, demanding an audition.

On [[Danny DeVito]]'s casting, Waters explained, &quot;I kind of knew that DeVito was going to play The Penguin. We didn't really officially cast it, but for a short nasty little guy, it's a short list. I ended up writing the character for Danny DeVito.&quot;&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt;

===Filming===
In early-1991, two of Hollywood's largest [[sound stage]]s (Stage 16 at Warner Bros. and Stage 12 at [[Universal Studios]]) were being prepared for the filming of ''Batman Returns''.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; Filming started in June 1991.&lt;ref name=Sally/&gt; Stage 16 held Gotham Plaza, based on [[Rockefeller Center]]. Universal's Stage 12 housed Penguin's underground lair. A half-a-million gallon tank filled with water was used.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; Burton wanted to make sure that the penguins felt comfortable.&lt;ref name=Sally/&gt; Eight other locations on the Warner Bros. lot were used, over 50% of their property was occupied by [[Gotham City]] sets.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt;

[[Animal rights]] groups started protesting the film after finding out that penguins would have rockets strapped on their backs. Richard Hill, the [[curator]] of the penguins explained that Warner Bros. was very helpful in making sure the penguins were comfortable.&lt;ref name=Ow/&gt; &quot;On the flight over the plane was refrigerated down to 45 degrees&quot;, recalls Hill. &quot;In Hollywood, they were given a refrigerated trailer, their own swimming pool, half-a-ton of ice each day, and they had fresh fish delivered daily straight from the docks. Even though it was 100 degrees outside, the entire set was refrigerated down to 35 degrees.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ow&gt;Owain Yolland (August 1992). &quot;Two minutes, Mr Penguin&quot;, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', pp. 89—90. Retrieved on 2008-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warner Bros. devoted a large amount of secrecy for ''Batman Returns''. The [[art department]] was required to keep their office blinds pulled down. Cast and crew had to have photo ID badges with the movie's [[title ruse|fake working title]] ''Dictel'' to go anywhere near the sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Steve Daly | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,310819,00.html | title = Sets Appeal: Designing ''Batman Returns'' | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1992-06-19 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Costner]] was refused a chance to visit the set. An entertainment magazine leaked the first photos of Danny DeVito as the Penguin; in response Warner Bros. employed a [[private investigator]] to track down the accomplice.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; $65 million was spent during the production of ''Batman Returns'', while $15 million was used for marketing, coming to a total cost of $80 million.&lt;ref name=Mac/&gt; The final shot of Catwoman looking at the [[Bat-Signal]] was completed during [[post-production]] and was not part of the [[shooting script]]. After ''Batman Returns'' was completed Warner Bros. felt it was best for Catwoman to survive, saving more characterizations in a future installment. Pfeiffer was unavailable and a [[body double]] was chosen.&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt;

===Design and effects===
[[Bo Welch]], Burton's collaborator on ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' and ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', replaced [[Anton Furst]] as [[production designer]]. Welch blended &quot;[[Fascist architecture]] with [[Expo (exhibition)|World's Fair]] architecture&quot; for Gotham City.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Sloane (August 1995). &quot;Bo Welch Interview&quot;, ''Film Review'', pp. 66. Retrieved on 2008-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian architecture]] and [[German Expressionism]] were also studied. An [[iron maiden (torture device)|iron maiden]] was used for Bruce Wayne's entry into the [[batcave]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bo Welch]], [[Tim Burton]], ''Gotham City Revisited: The Production Design of Batman Returns'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stan Winston]], who worked with Burton on ''Edward Scissorhands'', designed [[Danny DeVito]]'s [[prosthetic makeup]], which took two hours to apply.&lt;ref name=Mac&gt;Brian D. Johnson (1992-06-22). &quot;Batman's Return&quot;, ''[[Maclean's]]''. Retrieved on 2008-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt; DeVito had to put a combination of [[mouthwash]] and red/green [[food coloring]] in his mouth &quot;to create a grotesque texture of some weird ooze.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Danny DeVito]], [[Stan Winston]], ''Making-Up the Penguin'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 60 [[Catsuit]]s were designed in the six-month shoot at $1,000 each.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Fennell (August 1992). &quot;The Catsuit&quot;, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', pp. 47—49. Retrieved on 2008-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Batsuit]] was updated, which was made out of a thinner, slightly more flexible foam rubber material than the suit from ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''. DeVito was uncomfortable with his costume, but this made it easy for him to get into character. [[J. P. Morgan]]'s wardrobe was used for inspiration on Max Shreck's [[costume design]].&lt;ref&gt;Bob Ringwood, [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], ''Sleek, Sexy and Sinister: The Costumes of Batman Returns'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bats were entirely composed of [[computer-generated imagery]] since it was decided directing real bats on set would be problematic.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; The Penguin's &quot;bird army&quot; was a combination of CGI, robotic creatures, men in suits and even real penguins.&lt;ref name=Sally/&gt; Robotic penguin puppets were commissioned by Stan Winston. In total 30 [[African Penguin]]s and 12 [[King Penguin]]s were used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stan Winston]], ''Assembling the Arctic Army'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[miniature effect]] was used for the exteriors of the Cobblepot Mansion in the opening scene and for [[Wayne Manor]]. The same method was used for [[Batboat|the Bat Ski-boat]] and the exterior shots of the Gotham Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stan Winston]], Mike Fink, ''Bats, Mattes and Dark Knights: The Visual Effects of Batman Returns'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{See also|Batman Returns (soundtrack)}}
[[Danny Elfman]] had great enthusiasm for returning because &quot;I didn't have to prove myself from the first film. I remember [[Jon Peters]] was very skeptical at first to hire me.&quot;&lt;ref name=inside&gt;[[Danny Elfman]], ''Inside the Elfman Studios: The Music of Batman Returns'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; Elfman's work schedule was 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. &quot;When completing this movie I realized it was something of a [[film score]] and an [[opera]]. It was 95 minutes long, twice the amount of the average of film score.&quot;&lt;ref name=inside/&gt; The musician co-orchestrated &quot;[[Face to Face (Siouxsie and the Banshees song)|Face to Face]]&quot;, which was written and performed by [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]. The song can be heard in one scene during the film and during the end credits.&lt;ref name=inside/&gt;

==Reception==
===Reaction===
''Batman Returns'' was released in America on June 19, 1992, earning $45.69 million in 2,644 theaters on its opening weekend.&lt;ref name=box&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=batmanreturns.htm | title = Batman Returns (1992) | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the highest opening weekend in 1992 and the highest opening weekend of any film up to that point.&lt;ref name=dom&gt;{{cite web | url =

A &quot;parental backlash&quot; criticized ''Batman Returns'' with violence and sexual references that were unsuitable for children. [[McDonald's]] shut down their [[Happy Meal]] [[tie-in]] for the film.&lt;ref&gt;Olly Richards (September 1992). &quot;Trouble in Gotham&quot;, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', pp. 21—23. Retrieved on 2008-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Burton responded, &quot;I like ''Batman Returns'' better than the first one. There was this big backlash that it was too dark, but I found this movie much less dark.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sally/&gt;

Based on 47 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 79% of reviewers enjoyed the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_returns/ | title = Batman Returns | publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Janet Maslin]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' thought that &quot;Mr. Burton creates a wicked world of misfits, all of them rendered with the mixture of horror, sympathy and playfulness that has become this director's hallmark.&quot; She described [[Michael Keaton]] as showing &quot;appropriate earnestness&quot;, [[Danny DeVito]] as &quot;conveying verve&quot;, [[Christopher Walken]] as &quot;wonderfully debonair&quot;, [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as &quot;captivating... fierce, seductive&quot;, [[Bo Welch]]'s production design as &quot;dazzling&quot;, Stefan Czapsky's cinematography as &quot;crisp&quot;, and [[Daniel Waters]]'s screenplay as &quot;sharp.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CEFDF1539F93AA25755C0A964958260 | title = Movie Review - Batman Returns | work = [[The New York Times]] | author = [[Janet Maslin]] | date = 1992-06-19 | accessdate = 2009-11-17|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080511225309/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CEFDF1539F93AA25755C0A964958260 |archivedate = May 11, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote: &quot;Burton uses the summer's most explosively entertaining movie to lead us back into the liberating darkness of dreams.&quot; He praised the performances: &quot;Pfeiffer gives this feminist avenger a tough core of intelligence and wit; she's a classic dazzler... Michael Keaton's manic-depressive hero remains a remarkably rich creation. And Danny DeVito's mutant Penguin - a balloon-bellied ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' with a kingdom of sewer freaks - is as hilariously warped as [[Jack Nicholson]]'s Joker and even quicker with the quips.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949279/review/5949280/batman_returns | title = Batman Returns | work = [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] | author = [[Peter Travers]] | date = 2001-02-07 | accessdate = 2008-08-14|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071104160020/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949279/review/5949280/batman_returns |archivedate = November 4, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Desson Thomson|Desson Howe]] in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' wrote: &quot;Director Burton not only re-creates his one-of-a-kind atmosphere, he one-ups it, even two-ups it. He's best at evoking the psycho-murky worlds in which his characters reside. The Penguin holds court in a penguin-crowded, ''[[The Phantom of the Opera|Phantom of the Opera]]''-like sewer home. Keaton hides in a castlelike mansion, which perfectly mirrors its owner's inner remoteness. Comic strip purists will probably never be happy with a Batman movie. But ''Returns'' comes closer than ever to [[Bob Kane]]'s dark, original strip, which began in 1939.&quot; He described Walken as &quot;engaging&quot;, DeVito as &quot;exquisite&quot; and Pfeiffer as &quot;deliciously purry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/batmanreturnspg13howe_a07fbb.htm | title = Batman Returns | work = [[The Washington Post]] | author = Desson Howe | date = 1992-06-19 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd McCarthy in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that &quot;the real accomplishment of the film lies in the amazing physical realization of an imaginative universe. Where Burton's ideas end and those of his collaborators begin is impossible to know, but the result is a seamless, utterly consistent universe full of nasty notions about societal deterioration, greed and other base impulses.&quot; He praised the contributions of [[Stan Winston]], [[Danny Elfman]], [[Bo Welch]] and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky, and in terms of performances, opined that &quot;the deck is stacked entirely in favor of the villains&quot;, calling DeVito &quot;fascinating&quot; and Pfeiffer &quot;very tasty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117901465.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 | title = Batman Returns | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | author = Todd McCarthy | date = 1992-06-15 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote: &quot;I give the movie a negative review, and yet I don't think it's a bad movie; it's more misguided, made with great creativity, but denying us what we more or less deserve from a Batman story. No matter how hard you try, superheroes and [[film noir]] don't go together; the very essence of noir is that there are no more heroes.&quot; He compared the Penguin negatively with the Joker of the first film, writing that &quot;the Penguin is a curiously meager and depressing creature; I pitied him, but did not fear him or find him funny. The genius of Danny DeVito is all but swallowed up in the paraphernalia of the role. ''Batman Returns'' is odd and sad, but not exhilarating.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = [[Roger Ebert]] | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920619/REVIEWS/206190301/1023 | title = Batman | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] called DeVito &quot;a pale substitute for [[Jack Nicholson]] from the first film&quot; and felt that &quot;there's no suspense in ''Batman Returns'' whatsoever&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] | title = Batman | work = [[Chicago Reader]] | url = http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/771_BATMAN_RETURNS | date = 1992-06-19 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batman comic book writer/artist [[Matt Wagner]] was quoted as saying: &quot;I hated how ''Batman Returns'' made Batman little more than just another costumed creep, little better than the villains he's pursuing. Additionally, Burton is so blatantly not an action director. That aspect of both his films just sucked.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Bill &quot;Jett Ramey | url = http://www.batman-on-film.com/interview_mattwagner_jett_2006.html | title = Interview: Matt Wagner | work = Batman-on-Film | date = 2006-09-30 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Batman Returns'' would be the last film in the [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film series]] that featured [[Tim Burton]] and [[Michael Keaton]] as director and leading actor, respectively. With ''[[Batman Forever]]'', Warner Bros. decided to go in a &quot;lighter&quot; direction to be more [[mainstream]] in the process of a [[family film]]. Burton had no interest in returning to direct a sequel, but he did serve as a producer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Burton]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Joel Schumacher]], ''Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight—Reinventing a Hero'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Warner Bros.]] moving on development for ''Batman Forever'' in June 1993, a ''Catwoman'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] was announced. [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] was to reprise her role, with the character not to appear in ''Forever'' because of &quot;her own little movie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR107881 | title = Dish | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1993-06-17 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton became attached as director, while producer [[Denise Di Novi]] and writer [[Daniel Waters (writer)|Daniel Waters]] also returned to the ''Catwoman'' spin-off with Burton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR109036 | title = Another life at WB for ''Catwoman'' and Burton? | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1993-07-22 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1994, Burton was unsure of his plans to direct ''Catwoman'' or an adaptation of ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR117395 | title = Seagal on the pulpit may be too much for WB | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1994-01-13 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 1995, Waters turned in his ''Catwoman'' script to Warner Bros., the same day ''Batman Forever'' was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked, &quot;turning it in the day ''Batman Forever'' opened may not have been my best logistical move, in that it's the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman. ''Catwoman'' is definitely not a fun-for-the-whole-family script.&quot;&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt; The film labored in [[development hell]] for years, with Pfeiffer getting replaced by [[Ashley Judd]]. The film ended up becoming the critically panned ''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]'' (2004) starring [[Halle Berry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117796285 | title = WB: Judd purr-fect as ''Cat'' | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2001-04-02 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/catwoman/ | title = Catwoman | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = 2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its mixed reception on initial release, ''Batman Returns'' has attracted a cult following among fans due to its production design and gloomy tone. For example, animation director [[Satoshi Kon]] has cited it as one of his 100 favorite movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = One last Satoshi Kon post: 100 Movies Chosen by the Dreaming Machine Team | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2010-09-15/paprika-director-satoshi-kon-listed-100-notable-films}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of Penguin taking over the Batmobile was later used in the episode &quot;The Mechanic&quot; of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.

'''''Batman &amp; Robin''''' is a 1997 American [[superhero film]] directed by [[Joel Schumacher]]. Based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]], the film is a sequel to ''[[Batman Forever]]'' (1995), with [[George Clooney]] replacing [[Val Kilmer]] as Batman.

''Batman &amp; Robin'' also stars [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Uma Thurman]], [[Chris O'Donnell]], [[Alicia Silverstone]], and [[Michael Gough]]. The film tells the story of Batman and Robin struggling to keep their partnership together while trying to stop [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] from covering [[Gotham City]] with ice and vegetation.

Development for ''Batman &amp; Robin'' started immediately after ''Batman Forever'', and [[Warner Bros.]] commissioned the film for an adamant June 1997 release. [[Principal photography]] began in September 1996 and finished in January 1997, two weeks ahead of the [[shooting schedule]].

''Batman &amp; Robin'' was released on June 20, 1997, and was critically panned. Observers criticized the film for its [[toyetic]] and [[camp (style)|camp]] approach, as well as possible [[homosexuality|homosexual]] [[innuendo]] added by Schumacher. ''Batman &amp; Robin'' received 11 nominations at the [[18th Golden Raspberry Awards|1997 ceremony]] of the [[Golden Raspberry Award|Razzie Award]]s, including one for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]], and frequently ranks among the worst [[superhero film]]s of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/features/special/2007/comic/?r=88&amp;mid=1077027 | title = Comix Worst to Best: Batman &amp; Robin (1997) | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = 2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = David Fear | url = http://movies.msn.com/movies/superhero | title = Men in Tights | work = [[MSN]] Movies | accessdate = 2008-11-14 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080130104943/http://movies.msn.com/movies/superhero | archivedate = 2008-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Warner Bros. canceled the unproduced ''[[Batman in film#Batman Triumphant|Batman Triumphant]]'', and the [[Batman in film|film series]] was eventually [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed with ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005) by director [[Christopher Nolan]].

==Plot==
In [[Gotham City]], [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] attempt to stop [[Mr. Freeze]] from stealing a cache of diamonds, but he escapes. The Dynamic Duo soon learn that Mr. Freeze was once a scientist named Victor Fries who became dependent on a diamond-powered subzero suit following an accident in a [[cryogenics]] lab he was using to find a cure for his wife, [[Nora Fries|Nora]], who was suffering from a [[terminal illness]] called MacGregor's Syndrome.

In [[South America]], Pamela Isley is working under [[Floronic Man|Dr. Jason Woodrue]], a [[mad scientist]] who is experimenting with the [[List of comic book drugs#Venom|Venom drug]]. She witnesses Woodrue use the formula to turn a diminutive convict into a hulking monstrosity dubbed &quot;[[Bane (comics)|Bane]]&quot;. Woodrue and Isley argue over the use of the drug and Woodrue overturns a shelf of various toxins onto her. She transforms into the beautiful and seductive [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] before killing Woodrue with a kiss from her now-poisonous lips. She finds that [[Wayne Enterprises]] funded Woodrue, so she takes Bane with her to Gotham.

Meanwhile, butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s niece, Barbara Wilson, makes a surprise visit and is invited by Bruce Wayne to stay at [[Wayne Manor]] until she goes back to school. Alfred is revealed to be suffering from MacGregor's Syndrome.

Poison Ivy interrupts a Wayne Enterprises press conference to propose a project that could help the environment. Bruce Wayne declines her offer, as it would kill millions of people. That night, a charity event is held by Wayne Enterprises with special guests Batman and Robin in attendance. Poison Ivy decides to seduce them. Freeze crashes the party and steals a diamond from the event. He is captured and sent to a chamber prison in [[Arkham Asylum]], but escapes with the help of Ivy and Bane.

Robin becomes smitten with Ivy and begins to rebel against Batman. Ivy imprisons Robin when he does not give in to her charms; she also subdues Batman when he arrives to save his partner. Just then, Barbara &amp;mdash; now a costumed crimefighter calling herself [[Batgirl]] &amp;mdash; shows up and fights Ivy, eventually defeating her.

Batman, Robin, and Batgirl decide to go after Freeze together. By the time they get to the observatory where Freeze and Bane are, Gotham is completely frozen. Robin and Batgirl confront Bane and defeat him, while Batman and Freeze begin to fight each other, with Batman winning. Batgirl and Robin unfreeze Gotham.

Batman then shows Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl, in which the former brags about killing Nora. Batman then tells Freeze that his wife is not dead; she has been restored in cryogenic slumber and moved to Arkham so he can finish his research. Batman asks Freeze for the cure he has created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome for Alfred; Freeze atones for his misdeeds by giving him the medicine he had developed.

Ivy is shown imprisoned in Arkham with a vengeful Freeze as her cellmate. Alfred is eventually healed. Everyone agrees to let Barbara stay at the mansion.

==Production==
With the [[box office]] success of ''[[Batman Forever]]'' in June 1995, [[Warner Bros.]] instantly commissioned a sequel.&lt;ref name=helm/&gt; They hired director [[Joel Schumacher]] and writer [[Akiva Goldsman]] to reprise their duties the following August,&lt;ref name=shadow/&gt; and decided it was best to fast track production for a June 1997 target release date.&lt;ref name=helm&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117435255 | title = Helmer's 3rd At Bat | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1997-02-21 | accessdate = 2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumacher wanted to [[homage]] both the broad [[camp (style)|camp style]] of the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s television series]] and the work of [[Dick Sprang]].&lt;ref name=mike&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Mallory; Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/vstory/VR1117343043 | title = Holy caped caper, IV | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1997-03-05 | accessdate = 2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline of ''Batman &amp; Robin'' was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during [[pre-production]] on ''[[A Time to Kill (film)|A Time to Kill]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Rick Setlowe | url = http://www.variety.com/vstory/VR1117343096 | title = The write kind of director | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1997-03-05 | accessdate = 2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of Mr. Freeze's [[back-story]] were based on the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode &quot;[[Heart of Ice (Batman: The Animated Series episode)|Heart of Ice]]&quot;, written by [[Paul Dini]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Dini]], ''Batman &amp; Robin: The Heroes'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[start date]] was August 1996,&lt;ref name=Val/&gt; but [[principal photography]] did not begin until September 12, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Degen Pener | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,294102,00.html | title = Holy Hearsay | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1996-09-13 | accessdate = 2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Batman &amp; Robin'' finished filming in late-January 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Anita M.

When comparing work on ''Batman Forever'', [[Chris O'Donnell]], who portrayed Robin, explained, &quot;It just felt like everything got a little soft the second time. On ''Batman Forever'', I felt like I was making a movie. The second time, I felt like I was making a kid's toy commercial.&quot;&lt;ref name=shadow/&gt; According to [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]], who played Dr. Jason Woodrue, &quot;Joel [Schumacher] would sit on a crane with a [[megaphone]] and yell before each [[take#Film|take]], 'Remember, everyone, this is a cartoon'. It was hard to act because that kind of set the tone for the film.&quot;&lt;ref name=shadow/&gt; [[Production designer]] Barbara Ling admitted her influences for the [[Gotham City]] design came from &quot;[[neon sign|neon-ridden]] [[Tokyo]] and the [[Machine Age]].

==Marketing==
The ''Batman &amp; Robin'' [[film trailer]] debuted on the February 19, 1997 episode of ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Jenny Hontz | url = http://www.variety.com/vstory/VR1117436590 | title = Inside Moves | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1997-02-20 | accessdate = 2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warner Bros.]] spent $15 million to market and promote the film, bringing the total budget from $125 million to $140 million.&lt;ref name=market&gt;{{cite news | author = Dave Karger | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,288644,00.html | title = Big Chill | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1997-07-11 | accessdate = 2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio also brought in toy companies to be involved with [[pre-production]], including the design of [[concept art]] and character illustrations. Director Joel Schumacher criticized Warner Bros.' strategy for ''Batman &amp; Robin'' as being overtly [[toyetic]]. Various [[Six Flags]] parks ([[Six Flags Great Adventure]], [[Six Flags Over Texas]], and [[Six Flags St. Louis]]) all debuted coasters themed to the film.&lt;ref name=shadow/&gt;

==Reception==
===Box office===
''Batman &amp; Robin'' was released on June 20, 1997 in North America, earning $42,872,605 in its opening weekend,&lt;ref name=box&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=batmanrobin.htm | title = Batman and Robin | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate = 2008-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the third-highest opening weekend of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1997&amp;p=.htm | title = 1997 Domestic Grosses | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate = 2008-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film rapidly declined with a 63% second week plunge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116677093 | title = 'Bat' beats up B.O. | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1997-07-08 | accessdate = 2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many observers based the second week drop on negative [[word of mouth]]. In addition, ''Batman &amp; Robin'' faced early competition with ''[[Face/Off]]'' and ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]''.&lt;ref name=market/&gt; Schumacher blamed it on [[yellow journalism]] started by [[Harry Knowles]] of [[Ain't It Cool News]] and other film websites such as [[Dark Horizons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Rex Weiner | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116675713 | title = WWW.H'W'D.TICKED | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1997-07-29 | accessdate = 2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film went on to gross $107.3 million in North America and $130.9 million internationally, coming to a worldwide total of $238.2 million.&lt;ref name=box/&gt; Warner Bros. declared ''Batman &amp; Robin'' a financial success, but not on the scale they were hoping for.&lt;ref name=market/&gt;

Despite being a box office success, ''Batman &amp; Robin'' was a critical failure and received mainly negative reviews. Based on 63 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 13% of the critics gave ''Batman &amp; Robin'' positive reviews, culminating in a &quot;rotten&quot; rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1077027-batman_and_robin/ | title = Batman &amp; Robin | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = 2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison [[Metacritic]] collected an average score of 28, based on 21 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/movie/batman-robin | title = Batman &amp; Robin (1997): Reviews | work = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate = 2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schumacher and producer Peter MacGregor-Scott blamed the negative reception of ''Batman &amp; Robin'' on Warner Bros.' decision to fast track production. &quot;There was a lot of pressure from Warner Bros. to make ''Batman &amp; Robin'' more [[family-friendliness|family-friendly]],&quot; Schumacher explained. &quot;We decided to do a less depressing ''Batman'' movie and less torture and more heroic.

She praised Uma Thurman's acting, as well as the production and costume design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Janet Maslin]] | title = Batman and Robin | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1997-06-20 | accessdate = 2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Batman &amp; Robin'' was nominated the [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film]], as well as categories for [[Saturn Award for Best Make-up|Best Make-up]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Costume|Best Costume]]. [[Alicia Silverstone]] won the [[Golden Raspberry Award|Razzie Award]] for Worst Supporting Actress. Other nominations at the Razzie Awards included Schumacher (Worst Director), George Clooney and Chris O'Donnell (Worst Screen Couple), Akiva Goldsman (Worst Screenplay), both Chris O'Donnell and Arnold Schwarzenegger (Worst Supporting Actor), Uma Thurman (Worst Supporting Actress), and [[Billy Corgan]] (Worst Song for &quot;[[The End Is the Beginning Is the End]]&quot;). ''Batman &amp; Robin'' also received nominations for [[Razzie Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]], Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property. Ultimately, out of 11 nominations, this movie garnered only one Razzie Award.

Many observers accused Schumacher of adding possible [[homosexuality|homosexual]] [[innuendo]] in the storyline.&lt;ref name=shadow/&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] questioned the &quot;random amount of rubber nipples and camera angle [[close-up]]s of the Dynamic Duo's butts and Bat-crotches.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = [[James Berardinelli]] | title = Batman and Robin | work = ReelViews.net | url = http://www.reelviews.net/movies/b/batman4.html | accessdate = 2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to ''Batman Forever'', this primarily included the decision to add nipples and enlarged [[codpiece]]s to Batman and Robin suits. Schumacher stated, &quot;I had no idea that putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines. The bodies of the suits come from [[Art in ancient Greece|ancient Greek statue]]s, which display perfect bodies. They are anatomically erotic.&quot;&lt;ref name=shadow/&gt; Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, felt &quot;it wasn't so much the nipples that bothered me. It was the codpiece. The press obviously played it up and made it a big deal, especially with Joel directing. I didn't think twice about the controversy, but going back and looking and seeing some of the pictures, it was very unusual.&quot;&lt;ref name=shadow/&gt; Batgirl was given a similarly designed suit. [[George Clooney]] joked, &quot;Joel Schumacher told me we never made another ''Batman'' film because Batman was gay&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Sharon Swart; Bill Higgins | url = http://www.variety.com/vstory/vr1117925178.html?categoryID=38&amp;cs=1 | title = 'Happy' to sign off| work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2005-06-27 | accessdate = 2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clooney himself has spoken critically of the film, saying, &quot;I think we might have killed the franchise&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Boston Globe&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Batman and Robin | work=[[The Boston Globe]] | url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2005/06/12/behind_the_masks/?page=1 | accessdate=May 17, 2006 | first=Mac | last=Daniel | date=2005-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called it &quot;a waste of money&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Lynn Hirschberg | title = Questions for George Clooney; True Confessions | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2002-11-03 | accessdate = 2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
{{See also|Batman in film#Proposals for fifth film}}
During the filming of ''Batman &amp; Robin'', Warner Bros. was impressed with the [[dailies]]. This prompted them to immediately hire Joel Schumacher to return as director for a sequel, but writer [[Akiva Goldsman]], who worked on ''Batman Forever'' and ''Batman &amp; Robin'' with Schumacher, turned down the chance to write the script.&lt;ref name=mike/&gt; In late 1996, Warner Bros. and Schumacher hired [[Mark Protosevich]] to write the script for a fifth ''Batman'' film. A projected mid-1999 release date was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117435255 | title = Helmer's 3rd At Bat | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1997-02-21 | accessdate = 2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titled ''Batman Triumphant'', Protosevich's script had the [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] as the main villain. Through the use of his fear [[toxin]], he resurrects the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] as a hallucination in Batman's mind. [[Harley Quinn]] appeared as a supporting character, written as the Joker's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Brian Linder | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034019p1.html | title = Rumblings From Gotham | work = [[IGN]] | date = 2000-07-27 | accessdate = 2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Clooney and Chris O'Donnell were set to reprise the roles of Batman and Robin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116680121 | title = Schumacher trims sails | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1997-11-11 | accessdate = 2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, when ''Batman &amp; Robin'' received negative reviews and failed to outgross any of its predecessors, Warner Bros. was unsure of their plans for ''Batman Triumphant''. The studio decided it was best to consider a live-action ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' film and an adaptation of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: Year One]]''. Warners would then [[greenlight]] whichever idea suited them the most.&lt;ref name=ass/&gt; Schumacher felt he &quot;owe[d] the Batman culture a real ''Batman'' movie. I would go back to the basics and make a dark portrayal of the Dark Knight.&quot;&lt;ref name=Jen/&gt; He approached Warner Bros. of doing ''Batman: Year One'' in mid-1998,&lt;ref name=Jen&gt;{{cite news | author = Jeff Jensen | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285969,00.html | title = Winging It | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1998-12-04 | accessdate = 2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they were more interested in hiring [[Darren Aronofsky]]. Aronofsky and Frank Miller developed a ''Year One'' script with Aronofsky to direct, but it was ultimately canceled. [[Christopher Nolan]] was eventually hired to helm the next ''Batman'' film in January 2003, resulting in the [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005).&lt;ref name=ass&gt;{{cite book | author = David Hughes | title = Tales From Development Hell | publisher = [[Titan Books]] | year = 2004 | month = March | location = [[London]] | pages = 192–211| chapter = The Dark Knight Strikes Out | isbn = 1-84023-691-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Batman Forever''''' is a 1995 American [[superhero film]] directed by [[Joel Schumacher]] and produced by [[Tim Burton]]. It is the third installment of the [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film series]] and stars [[Val Kilmer]] as [[Batman]]. The plot focuses on Batman trying to stop [[Two-Face]] ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]) and the [[Riddler]] ([[Jim Carrey]]) in their villainous scheme to drain information from all the brains in [[Gotham City]]. He gains allegiance from psychiatrist [[Chase Meridian]] ([[Nicole Kidman]]) and orphaned ward [[Dick Grayson]] ([[Chris O'Donnell]]).

The film had a change in tone compared to the previous installments, more [[family-friendly]], since [[Warner Bros.]] considered that the previous film, ''[[Batman Returns]]'', underperformed at the [[box office]] due to its violence and dark overtones. Production was troubled, with many actors considered for the main roles, and Kilmer entering in conflicts with the director and the rest of the crew. ''Batman Forever'' received mixed reviews upon release, but was a success with audiences, out-grossing ''Batman Returns'' with over $336 million worldwide and becoming the second-highest grossing film of 1995.

==Plot==
[[Batman]] stops a hostage situation in a bank caused by [[Two-Face]], the [[alter ego]] of the disfigured former [[district attorney]], Harvey Dent. Unfortunately, Two-Face escapes. Later on, Edward Nygma, a researcher at [[Wayne Enterprises]], develops a device to beam television directly to a person's brain; Bruce Wayne (with whom Nygma is obsessed) rejects the invention, noting that it &quot;raises too many questions&quot;. Nygma's boss attempts to terminate the project but Nygma tests the machine on him and murders him (making it look like a suicide) and resigns from his position at Wayne Enterprises, though he leaves a riddle there.

After meeting psychiatrist [[Dr. Chase Meridian]], Bruce invites her to a charity circus event. There, Two-Face and his henchmen storm the event in an attempt to discover Batman's secret identity, which Bruce tries to tell him, but cannot due to the crowd screaming, and in the process murder ''The Flying Graysons'', a family of acrobats, who fall when their trapeze is cut. The youngest member, [[Dick Grayson|Dick]], survives and throws Two-Face's bomb into the river. Bruce assumes responsibility for Dick and allows him to stay at [[Wayne Manor]]. Dick declares his intention to kill Two-Face and avenge his family's murder, and when he discovers Bruce's secret identity as Batman, he insists on becoming his sidekick, &quot;[[Robin (comics)|Robin]]&quot;.

Meanwhile, Nygma becomes a criminal known as the &quot;[[Riddler]]&quot; and become allies with Two-Face. Using his invention that Bruce had rejected earlier, Nygma can read and control people's minds, and steal their [[intelligence quotient]]. At a business party, Edward discovers Bruce's secret identity. Two-Face then attacks the party and nearly kills Batman with a trap which looks Batman buried, but Robin arrives just in time to save his life. However, Two-Face and the Riddler later converge into Wayne Manor on Halloween, just after Bruce has revealed his identity to Chase. The Riddler enters the [[Batcave]] and destroys most of the equipment, and he and Two-Face kidnap Chase after Bruce is shot in the head by Two-Face, though Riddler stops Two-Face from shooting him again and killing him. They also leave Bruce another riddle.

After solving the last riddle and using all the answers to determine who Riddler is, Batman and Robin locate the Riddler's lair, where both are separated upon reaching the island. Chase is handcuffed to a sofa, and when she says Batman will come, she is told by the Riddler he is counting on Batman coming here. After the duo defeat a gang of underwater thugs, Robin then encounters Two-Face and manages to beat him to the ground; realizing that he does not have it in him to commit murder, Robin helps the villain back up. Doing this allows Two-Face to get the upper hand, and he captures Robin by pulling a gun on him. Meanwhile, Batman manages to make his way into the Riddler's lair up a tube despite a metal cover moving towards him and meets the Riddler himself; he reveals Robin and Chase as hostages, both bound and gagged, in giant tubes over the pit of water and metal spikes, and gives Batman a choice of saving one hostage, but not the other, to determine whether Batman and Bruce Wayne can co-exist and which one he is. Batman finds a way to save both hostages, and manages to destroy the brainwave-collecting device and drive the Riddler into a [[mental breakdown]] in the process. During the battle, Two-Face falls to his death after Bruce throws multiple coins when Two-Face tries to toss his when about to shoot them. The Riddler is finally sent to [[Arkham Asylum]], and Chase is asked to consult on his case. Riddler offers to reveal the identity of Batman to her, but he thinks himself Batman. Chase then meets Bruce Wayne outside and tells him his secret is safe.

==Production==
===Development===
Even though ''Batman Returns'' was a financial success, Warner Bros. felt the film should have made more money and decided to make the film series more mainstream. [[Tim Burton]], who had directed the two previous installments, was asked to restrict himself to the role of producer and approved of [[Joel Schumacher]] as director.&lt;ref name=Russo&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308195,00.html | title = ''Batman 3'' | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1993-10-01 | accessdate = 2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumacher originally had in mind an adaptation of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: Year One]]''. The studio rejected the idea as they wanted a sequel, not a prequel, though Schumacher was able to include very brief events in Batman's past. Burton and Schumacher together hired Lee and Janet Scott-Batchler to write the script which introduced a psychotic Riddler with a pet rat accompanying him. The story elements and much of the dialogue still remained in the finished film, though Schumacher felt it could be &quot;lighted down.&quot; He hired [[Akiva Goldsman]], whom he previously had worked for on ''[[The Client (film)|The Client]]'', to write the second draft.&lt;ref name=shadowbat/&gt;

Production went on [[wikt:fast track|fast track]] with [[Rene Russo]] cast as [[Dr. Chase Meridian]]. [[Michael Keaton]] decided not to reprise Batman because he did not like the new direction the film series was heading in.&lt;ref name=Val/&gt; Keaton also wanted to pursue &quot;more interesting roles&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Army Archerd]] | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862593 | title = Culkin kids ink with WMA | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1994-12-01 | accessdate = 2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; turning down $15 million to appear in ''Batman Forever''.&lt;ref name=Russo/&gt; [[Val Kilmer]] was cast days later, and the filmmakers decided that Russo was too old for Kilmer, replacing her with a different actress.&lt;ref name=Val&gt;{{cite news | author = Jeff Gordinier | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,302969,00.html | title = Next at ''Batman'' | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1994-07-15 | accessdate = 2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumacher got interested in Kilmer for Batman after seeing him in ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'', and the actor accepted the role without even reading the script or knowing who the new director was.&lt;ref name=hold&gt;{{cite news | author=Nathan, Ian | title=Hold me, thrill me, kiss me, Kilmer | publisher=''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' | pages=108–117 | date=August 1995 | accessdate=2007-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Val Kilmer was cast, [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], [[Ralph Fiennes]], [[William Baldwin]] and [[Johnny Depp]] were all under consideration to replace Michael Keaton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jett|title=William Baldwin Talks Batman And &quot;JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS&quot;|work=Batman-on-Film|date=2009-12-16|url=http://www.batman-on-film.com/dccomics-on-film_JL-CRISIS-ON-TWO-EARTHS_William-Baldwin-talks-Batman_12-16-09.html|accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Johnny Depp Was Almost Batman In Batman Forever|work=ComicBookMovie|date=2009-12-10|url=http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/CookiepussProduction/news/?a=12646|accessdate=2009-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robin Wright (actress)|Robin Wright Penn]], [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]] and [[Linda Hamilton]] were in competition for Dr. Chase Meridian, with Penn appearing as the favorable choice. [[Nicole Kidman]] was eventually cast.&lt;ref name=Leo/&gt; Even though [[Billy Dee Williams]] took the role of Harvey Dent in ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' because he was looking forward to portray Two-Face in a sequel, the producers cast [[Tommy Lee Jones]] in the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | title = Batman Heroes Profile: Harvey Dent| location=''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' Special Edition| format = DVD | publisher = [[Warner Bros.]] Home Video |date = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was always Schumacher's first choice for the role after working with him on ''The Client''. Jones claims he was sent the script and was very cautious to accept,&lt;ref name=shadowbat&gt;{{cite video | title = Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight-Reinventing a Hero| format = DVD | publisher = [[Warner Bros.]] |date = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; but accepted the part because Two-Face was his son's favorite character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,303022,00.html|title=The Good Son| author = Cindy Pearlman|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robin Williams]] expressed interest in the Riddler,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Cindy Pearlman | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308987,00.html | title = Flashes: No Joker | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1993-12-17 | accessdate = 2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Michael Jackson]] was attached to the role, but was turned down. [[Jim Carrey]] was eventually cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Mike Thomas | title = Hey, what about that man in the glass booth? | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = 2003-03-31 | accessdate = 2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] appeared in the [[shooting script]] of ''Batman Returns'' but was deleted due to too many characters. [[Marlon Wayans]] was cast in the role, and signed for ''Batman Forever''. It was decided to replace Wayans with a different actor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Nathan Rabin | url = http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23240 | title = Wayans World | work = [[The A.V. Club]] | date = 1998-02-25 | accessdate = 2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Chris O'Donnell]] became the top two choices, with O'Donnell winning the part. [[Mitchell Gaylord]] served as O'Donnell's [[stunt double]].&lt;ref name=Leo&gt;{{cite news | author = Judy Brennan | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,302503,00.html | title = Batman Battles New Bat Villains | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1994-06-03 | accessdate = 2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Filming started in September 1994.&lt;ref name=Russo/&gt; Schumacher hired Barbara Ling for production design, claiming that the film needed a &quot;force&quot; and felt Ling could &quot;advance on it.&quot; Schumacher wanted a design that was not to be any way connected to the previous films, and instead was to be inspired by the images from the Batman comic books seen in the 1940s/early 1950s and taken from that of New York City architecture in the 1930s, with a combination of modern Tokyo. He also wanted a &quot;city with personality&quot;, with more statues, as well as various amounts of [[neon]]. The [[Batmobile]] was also given a makeover, with two cars being constructed, one for stunt purposes and one for close ups with both showcasing a [[V8 engine]].&lt;ref name=design&gt;{{cite video | title = Out of the Shadows: The Production Design of Batman Forever| location = Batman Forever: Special Edition| format = DVD | publisher = Warner Bros|date = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schumacher had problems filming with Kilmer, whom he described as &quot;childish and impossible&quot;, reporting that he fought with various crewmen, and refused to speak to Schumacher during two weeks after the director told him to stop behaving in a rude way.&lt;ref name=Val&gt;{{cite news | author = Rebecca Ascher-Walsh | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292752,00.html | title = Psycho Kilmer | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1995-05-31 | accessdate = 2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumacher also mentioned Tommy Lee Jones as source of trouble: &quot;Jim Carrey was a gentleman, and Tommy Lee was threatened by him. I'm tired of defending overpaid, overprivileged actors. I pray I don't work with them again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Benjamin Svetkey | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,293237,00.html | title = Holy Happy Set! | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1996-07-12 | accessdate = 2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design and effects===
[[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]] designed the [[prosthetic makeup]]. [[John Dykstra]], [[Andrew Adamson]] and [[Jim Rygiel]] served as [[visual effects supervisor]]s, with [[Pacific Data Images]] also contributing with visual effects work. PDI provided a computer-generated Batman for complicated stunts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9njZ482OYfwC|title=Understanding motion capture for computer animation and video games|first=Alberto|last=Menache|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|year=1999|page=49|ISBN=0124906303}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the costume design, producer Peter MacGregor-Scott claimed that 146 workers were at one point working together. Batman's costume was redesigned along the lines of a more &quot;[[MTV]] organic, and edgier feel&quot; to the suit.&lt;ref name=kilmer&gt;{{cite video | title = The Many Faces of Gotham City | format = DVD | publisher = [[Warner Bros.]] |date = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound editing and mixing was co-supervised by [[Bruce Stambler]] and John Levesque which included trips to caves to record bat sounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenny2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenny|first=Tom|title=Sound for picture: film sound through the 1990s|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oNSSw01RIw0C&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=28 February 2011|date=2000-10-01|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9780872887244|pages=85–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{See also|Batman Forever (score)|Batman Forever (soundtrack)}}
Schumacher hired [[Elliot Goldenthal]] to compose the film score even before the first draft of the script was written. Schumacher did not want Goldenthal to be inspired by [[Danny Elfman]]'s previous scores, and instead commissioned the composer to write a different orchestral piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | title = Scoring Forever: The Music of Batman Forever | format = DVD | publisher = [[Warner Bros.]] |date = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soundtrack was commercially successful, selling almost as many copies as Prince's soundtrack to the 1989 Batman film. Only five of the songs on the soundtrack are actually featured in the movie, the rest are strictly 'inspired by'. Hit singles from the soundtrack include &quot;[[Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me]]&quot; by [[U2]] and &quot;[[Kiss from a Rose]]&quot; by [[Seal (musician)|Seal]], both of which were nominated for MTV Movie Awards. &quot;Kiss from a Rose&quot; (whose video was also directed by Joel Schumacher) reached #1 in the U.S. charts as well. The soundtrack itself, featuring additional songs by [[The Flaming Lips]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]] (both songs also included in the film), [[Method Man]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Michael Hutchence]] (of INXS), [[PJ Harvey]], and [[Massive Attack]], was an attempt to (in producer Peter MacGregor-Scott's words) make the film more &quot;pop&quot;.

==Deleted scenes==
''Batman Forever'' went through a few major edits before its release. Originally darker than the final product, the movie's original length was closer to two hours and 40 minutes according to director Joel Schumacher. There was talk of an extended cut being released to DVD for the film's 10th anniversary in 2005. While all four previous Batman films were given Special Edition DVD releases on the same day as the ''[[Batman Begins]]''' DVD release, the version of ''Batman Forever'' released was the original, although some of the following scenes were in a deleted scenes section in the special features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.batman-on-film.com/opinion_scissorpuppy_forever.html | title = Batman Forever - What Could Be: A Guide to the Batman Forever Cutting Room Floor | work = Batman-On-Film.com | accessdate = 2008-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scenes were filmed but deleted from the film. These included:

* The escape of Two-Face from Arkham Asylum. [[René Auberjonois (actor)|René Auberjonois]] had more scenes filmed here, playing Doctor Burton but his role was reduced to a cameo in the final film. He encounters the escape with the psychologist hanged in Two-Face's cell with &quot;The Bat Must Die&quot; written in blood on the wall. This was supposed to be the film's opening scene, but producers decided this was far too dark for a family audience. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD. Segments of the scene also appears on the [[U2]] music video for &quot;[[Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me]]&quot;.
* The construction of NygmaTech was more in-depth. There were scenes shot that appear in publicity stills of Edward Nygma with a hard hat helping with the construction of his headquarters on Claw Island. This scene does not appear on the new Special Edition release but is shown in the sticker album published by Merlin Collections.
* Sugar and Spice, played by [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[Debi Mazar]], try out the Riddler's device during the montage when it goes on sale. They are seated with the Riddler and Two-Face on the couch where Chase is handcuffed later in the film. This scene appears in the comic adaptation but not in the final film.
* The most known deleted scene involved further backstory to the film. It involved Bruce waking up after being shot in the head by Two-Face, temporarily wiping a part of his memory; he has forgotten his origin and life as the Dark Knight. Alfred takes him to the Batcave, which has been destroyed by the Riddler. They stand on the platform where the [[Batmobile]] was, and Alfred says, &quot;Funny they did not know about the cave beneath the cave.&quot; The platform then rotates downward to another level where the sonar-modification equipment is kept, from the special [[Batsuit]] to the hi-tech weaponry. Bruce then discovers the cavern where he first saw the image that inspired him to become Batman &amp;mdash; a giant bat. The bat appears and Bruce raises his arms and the shot shows that they are one. Bruce now remembers who he is and goes with Alfred to solve the riddles left throughout the film. Screenwriter [[Akiva Goldsman]] admitted the scene was very theatrical on the Special Edition DVD and felt it would have made a difference to the final cut. The bat was designed and created by [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]], who was in charge of the make-up of Two-Face. This scene appears in a rough form on the Special Edition DVD and is briefly mentioned in the comic adaptation.
* The original ending was an homage to the [[Batman (1989 film)|first film]]. When Alfred drives Doctor Chase Meridian back to Gotham she asks him &quot;Does it ever end?&quot; Alfred replies, &quot;No, Doctor Meridian, not in this lifetime...&quot; The [[Bat-Signal]] shines on the night sky and Batman is standing on a pillar looking ahead. Robin then comes into shot and joins his new partner. They both leap off the pillar, towards the camera. A rough edit of the first half of the scene appears on the Special Edition DVD, but not in its entirety. The sequence with Batman and Robin at the end of this scene appears in a teaser trailer for the video game, which is on the [[VHS]] release of this film, released in the UK on December 3, 1995.

[[Peter Travers]] criticized the movie's blatant commercialism, but commented that &quot;''Batman Forever'' still gets in its licks. There's no fun machine this summer that packs more surprises. The script misses the pain [[Tim Burton]] caught in a man tormented by the long-ago murder of his parents.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Peter Travers]] | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5948895/review/5948896/batman_forever | title = Batman Forever | work = [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] | date = 2000-12-08 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' believed &quot;One does have to question the logic behind adding nipples to the hard-rubber [[batsuit]]. Whose idea was that supposed to be anyway, [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]]'s? Some of the [[computer-generated]] [[Gotham City|Gotham]] cityscapes appear too obviously fake. [[Elliot Goldenthal]]'s score, while serviceable, also isn't as stirring as [[Danny Elfman]]'s work in the first two films.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Brian Lowry | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117904172.html | title = Batman Forever | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1995-06-14 | accessdate = 2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Berardinelli]] enjoyed the film. &quot;It's lighter, brighter, funnier, faster-paced, and a whole lot more colorful than before.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[James Berardinelli]] | url = http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=287 | title = ''Batman Forever'' | work = ReelViews | date = 1995-06-16 | accessdate = 2008-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scott Beatty]] felt &quot;Tommy Lee Jones played [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] as a [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] knock-off rather than a multi-layered rogue.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Bill &quot;Jett&quot; Ramey | url = http://batman-on-film.com/sbeattyinterview.html | title = BOF Interview: Scott Beatty | work = Batman-on-Film | date = 2005-11-28 | accessdate = 2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lee Bermejo]] called ''Batman Forever'' &quot;unbearable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Bill &quot;Jett&quot; Ramey | url = http://batman-on-film.com/leebermejointerview.html | title = Interview: Lee Bermejo | work = Batman-on-Film | date = 2005-10-13 | accessdate = 2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film mixed reviews, but with the former giving it a [[thumbs up]] and the latter a [[Thumbs up|thumbs down]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/atm/reviews.html?sec=1&amp;subsec=1357 At the Movies].&lt;/ref&gt; In his written review, Ebert wrote: &quot;Is the movie better entertainment?

&quot;'''Year One'''&quot;, later referred to as &quot;'''Batman: Year One'''&quot;, is an [[American comic book|American]] [[comic book]] [[story arc]] written by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], illustrated by [[David Mazzucchelli]], colored by [[Richmond Lewis]], and lettered by [[Todd Klein]]. It originally appeared in issues #404 to #407 of [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Batman]]'' [[Batman (comic book)|comic]] title in 1987.

There have been several reprints of the story: a [[hardcover]], multiple [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] editions (one in standard comics paper with simpler coloring and one deluxe version with rich detailing in the colors &amp;mdash; both colored by Richmond Lewis) and it has been included in ''The Complete Frank Miller Batman'' hardcover.

== Synopsis ==
The story recounts the beginning of Bruce Wayne's career as [[Batman]] and [[James Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]]'s with the [[Gotham City Police Department]]. Bruce Wayne returns home to [[Gotham City]] from training abroad in martial arts, manhunting, and science for the past 12 years, and James Gordon moves to Gotham with his wife, Barbara, after a transfer from [[Chicago]]. Both are swiftly acquainted with the corruption and violence of Gotham City, with Gordon witnessing his partner [[Arnold John Flass|Detective Flass]] assaulting a teen for fun.

On a surveillance mission to the seedy East End, a disguised Bruce is propositioned by teenaged prostitute [[Holly Robinson (fictional character)|Holly Robinson]]. He is reluctantly drawn into a brawl with her violent pimp and is attacked by several prostitutes, including dominatrix [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]]. Two police officers shoot and take him in their squad car, but a dazed and bleeding Bruce breaks his handcuffs and causes a crash, dragging the police to a safe distance before fleeing. He reaches [[Wayne Manor]] barely alive and sits before his father’s bust, requesting guidance in his war on crime. A bat crashes through a window and settles on the bust, giving him the inspiration to become a bat.

Gordon soon works to rid corruption from the force, but, on orders from [[Gillian B. Loeb|Commissioner Gillian Loeb]], several officers attack him, including Flass, who personally threatens Gordon’s pregnant wife. In revenge, the recovering Gordon tracks Flass down, beats and humiliates him, leaving him naked and handcuffed in the snow.

As Gordon becomes a minor celebrity for several brave acts, Batman strikes for the first time, attacking a group of thieves. Batman soon works up the ladder, even attacking Flass while he was accepting a drug dealer’s bribe. After Batman interrupts a dinner party attended by many of Gotham’s corrupt politicians and crime bosses, including [[Carmine Falcone|Carmine &quot;The Roman&quot; Falcone]], Loeb orders Gordon to bring him in by any means necessary.

As Gordon tries in vain to catch him, Batman attacks Falcone, stripping him naked and tying him up in his bed after dumping his car in the river, further infuriating the mob boss. Assistant [[district attorney]] [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] becomes Batman’s first ally, while [[Sarah Essen Gordon|Detective Sarah Essen]] and Gordon, after Essen suggested Bruce Wayne as a Batman suspect, witness Batman save an old woman from a runaway truck. Essen holds Batman at gunpoint while Gordon is momentarily dazed, but Batman disarms her and flees to an abandoned building.

Claiming the building has been scheduled for demolition, Loeb orders a bomb dropped on it, forcing Batman into the fortified basement, abandoning his belt as the explosives inside catch fire. A trigger-happy [[SWAT]] team led by Branden is sent in, who Batman attempts to trap in the basement. They soon escape and, after tranquilizing Branden, Batman dodges as the rest open fire, barely managing to survive after two bullet wounds. Enraged as the team’s carelessly fired bullets injure several people outside, Batman beats the team into submission and, after using a device to attract the bats of his cave to him, he flees amid the chaos. Selina Kyle, after witnessing him in action, dons a costume of her own to begin a life of crime.

Gordon has a brief affair with Essen, while Batman intimidates a mob drug dealer for information. The dealer comes to Gordon to testify against Flass, who is brought up on charges. Upset with Gordon's exploits, Loeb blackmails Gordon against pressing charges with proof of his affair. After bringing Barbara with him to interview Bruce Wayne, investigating his connection to Batman, Gordon confesses the affair to her.

Batman sneaks into Falcone’s manor, overhearing a plan against Gordon, but is interrupted when Selina Kyle, hoping to build a reputation after her robberies were pinned on Batman, attacks Falcone and his bodyguards, aided from afar by Batman. Identifying Falcone’s plan as the morning comes, the uncostumed Bruce leaves to help.

While leaving home, Gordon spots a motorcyclist enter his garage. Suspicious, Gordon enters to see Johnny Vitti, Falcone’s nephew, and his thugs holding his family hostage. Gordon decisively shoots the thugs and chases Vitti, who has fled with the baby. Bruce Wayne, on a motorcycle, also rushes out to chase Vitti. Gordon blows out Vitti's car tire on a bridge and the two fight hand-to-hand, with Gordon losing his glasses, before Vitti and James Gordon Junior fall over the side. Bruce leaps over the railing and saves the baby. Gordon realizes that he is standing before an unmasked Batman, but says that he is &quot;practically blind without [his] glasses,&quot; and lets Bruce go.

In the final scenes of the comic, Flass turns on Loeb, supplying Dent with evidence and testimony, and Loeb resigns. Gordon is promoted to captain and stands on the rooftop waiting to meet Batman to discuss somebody called [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]], who is plotting to poison the reservoir.

==Critical reaction==
[[IGN]] Comics ranked ''Batman: Year One'' at the top of a list of the 25 greatest Batman graphic novels, saying that &quot;no other book before or since has quite captured the realism, the grit and the humanity of Gordon and Batman so perfectly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/articles/624/624619p1.html The 25 Greatest Batman Graphic Novels], Hilary Goldstein, IGN, June 13, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The website added, &quot;It's not only one of the most important comics ever written, it's also among the best.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/articles/626/626667p1.html Batman: Year One Review], IGN, June 17, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuity==
''Batman: Year One'' exists not only in the mainstream DC-continuity, but also in the same continuity as the other storylines in Miller's &quot;Dark Knight Universe&quot;, consisting of ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', its sequel ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', ''[[Spawn/Batman]]'', ''[[All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanderson |first=Peter |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/685/685820p1.html |title='&amp;#39;Comics in Context #119: All-Star Bats'&amp;#39; on IGN |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date=2006-02-06 |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', DC [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] many of its titles. ''Year One'' was followed by ''[[Batman: Year Two]]'', but the 1994 ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]]'' crossover erased ''Year Two'' from continuity. In another continuity re-arrangement, ''Catwoman: Year One'' (''Catwoman Annual'' #2, 1998) posited that Selina Kyle had not actually been a prostitute, but, rather, a thief posing as one in order to commit crimes.

Launched in 1989, following the success of the film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', the title ''[[Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight]]'' examines crime-fighting exploits primarily, not exclusively, from the first four to five years of Batman's career. This title rotated in creative teams and time placement, but several stories directly relate to the events of ''Year One'', especially the first arc &quot;Batman: Shaman&quot;. In 1998, [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Tim Sale (artist)|Tim Sale]] created ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'' and ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', two 13-issue maxiseries that recounted Batman's early years as a crime-fighter following the events of Miller's original story and retold the origins of [[Two-Face]] and [[Dick Grayson]]. The ''Year One'' story was continued in the 2005 graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Man Who Laughs]]'', following up on Gordon informing Batman about the Joker, and thus recounting their first official encounter. Two other stories, ''[[Batman and the Monster Men]]'' and ''[[Batman and the Mad Monk]]'' tie into the same time period of Batman's career, filling in the gaps that exist in Miller's original story. Following the 2007 cancellation of ''Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight'', ''[[Batman Confidential]]'' began publication, depicting Batman's early years, although some of these stories take place several years after Miller's ''Year One'' story because Batman is depicted wearing his &quot;yellow oval&quot; costume.

==Adaptations==
===Cancelled film===
{{see|Batman in film#Batman: Year One}}
In 2000, Warner Bros. hired [[Darren Aronofsky]] to write and direct a reboot of the Batman film franchise.&lt;ref name=Dana&gt;{{cite news | author = Dana Harris | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117786714 | title = WB sends ''Pi'' guy into the Bat Cave | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2000-09-21 | accessdate = 2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reboot was to be based on ''Batman: Year One''. Accordingly, Aronofsky collaborated with Frank Miller who finished an early draft of the script.&lt;ref name=Dana/&gt; The script, however, was a loose adaptation, as it kept most of the themes and elements from the graphic novel but shunned other conventions that were otherwise integral to the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Brian Linder | work = [[IGN]] | title = The Bat-Men Speak | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034023p1.html | date = 2000-10-16 | accessdate = 2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually shelved by the studio and both Aronofsky and Miller moved on to other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Dana Harris | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117869140 | title = WB: fewer pix, more punch | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2002-06-30 | accessdate = 2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce is seen eschewed from his wealth and lifestyle following his parent's murder; as a child he is found by &quot;Big Al&quot; (this world's version of Alfred Pennyworth, reinvented as an African-American junkyard owner). Bruce grows to maturity, haunted by his nightmares while working in the junkyard. Across the street lay the remnants of Crime Alley, now turned into a prostitute ring and cat-house where the dominatrix Selina Kyle works. Bruce's decision to fight criminals precipitates when he watches rookie cop James Gordon on TV apprehending a perpetrator at a hostage situation. Initially, Bruce dons a cape and hockey mask to fight crime. However, the costume evolves to a more stylized version as Bruce gathers a variety of gadgets and weapons. Bruce rebuilds a black Lincoln Continental into an improvised Batmobile. In his new disguise as &quot;The Batman,&quot; Bruce battles street level thugs and high-ranking officials, including Police Commissioner Loeb and Mayor Noone. Meanwhile, the executors of the Wayne family estate search for Bruce.&lt;ref name=ass&gt;{{cite book | author = David Hughes | title = Tales From Development Hell | publisher = [[Titan Books]] | year = 2004 | month = March | location = [[London]] | pages = 192–211| chapter = The Dark Knight Strikes Out | id = ISBN 1-84023-691-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon grows more determined to maintain law and order, befriending Assistant District Attorney Harvey Dent. Notable translations from the book involve Gordon being beaten up by Detective Flass and his goons at the precinct parking lot, his silent battle against Commissioner Loeb, and Gordon's initial speculations about Harvey Dent being the vigilante. Gordon chronicles the corruption he sees in the Gotham PD in a 'Corruption Log'. He contacts Mayor Noone only to later realize that the Mayor too is under Loeb's influence. The log is eventually stolen and then retrieved by Selina Kyle, who hands it over to the Batman. Gordon is given his log back by the Batman, thus cementing their mutual trust and Batman's role as a force for good. In scenes adapted from the book, Batman is cornered by the GCPD in an abandoned tenement fire, Gordon and Flass brawl at night, and Gordon's family is attacked by Loeb's men. The Batman and Gordon are able to subdue Loeb and his men, with Flass and Loeb being convicted of criminal charges. Bruce eventually comes to accept his dual identity as heir to the Wayne family estate and the Batman. In the epilogue, when Selina dons her costume and becomes 'Catwoman', she recognizes Bruce's face when he has reintegrated into society.&lt;ref name=ass/&gt;

===Animated film===
As confirmed by Comics Continuum, a future film in the [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]] series will be an adaptation of Frank Miller's story &quot;Batman: Year One&quot; from 1987 in the main Batman title, featured in issues #404–407. It will be co-directed by Sam Liu and Lauren Montgomery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://comicscontinuum.com/stories/1006/13/index.htm|title=Batman: Year One Animated Update|publisher=comicscontinuum.com|date=June 13, 2010|accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Benjamin McKenzie]] has been cast as Bruce Wayne/Batman, [[Bryan Cranston]] was cast as [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], [[Eliza Dushku]] as Catwoman and [[Katee Sackhoff]] as Sarah Essen. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/batman-year-one-lines-up-179942&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence in other adaptations==
===''Batman: Mask of the Phantasm''===
In the critically acclaimed ''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm]]'' animated movie, creators [[Bruce Timm]], [[Paul Dini]] and [[Alan Burnett]] draw aspects from ''Batman: Year One'' during the flashback scenes, these include:

*A young and inexperienced Bruce Wayne fighting street thugs and realizing his shortcomings.
*The scene where Batman/Bruce is cornered by Bullock's SWAT Team adheres to a similar setting from the graphic novel as mentioned above (the abandoned tenement fire from issue #3).

===''Batman Begins'' and ''The Dark Knight''===
Christopher Nolan's ''[[Batman Begins]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' are set during the same timespan and has indeed adapted several elements directly from the graphic novel. While the thematic elements cannot be stressed here (corruption at GCPD, Bruce's personal vocation, Jim Gordon etc.), some of the more direct interpretations include:

*Major characters like [[Gillian B. Loeb|Commissioner Loeb]], [[Arnold John Flass|Detective Flass]] and [[Carmine Falcone|Carmine 'The Roman' Falcone]] who are featured prominently in ''Batman Begins''.
*The scene with Bruce Wayne returning from years of training abroad on board a plane reminisces the first page of the graphic novel.
*[[Christian Bale]]'s 'street attire' in ''Batman Begins'' mimics the clothes in the first issue of ''Batman: Year One'' when Bruce is walking down the Lower East End.
*Tying Falcone up. In the graphic novel Batman ties The Roman in his own house; in the film, he ties The Roman to a searchlight.
*In the final act of ''Batman Begins'', while being cornered by the GCPD at Arkham Asylum Batman uses a high-frequency device to attract his bats from the cave. This is taken from the final act of the graphic novel when Batman does the same thing at the abandoned tenement fire.
*The concluding scene where Batman and Gordon are on top of the police headquarters continues, to an extent, the final page of the graphic novel where newly promoted Jim Gordon waits for Batman to arrive. In both the book and the film, Gordon announces the coming of a new threat: The Joker.
*During the famous [[The Dark Knight (film)#Marketing|viral-marketing for ''The Dark Knight'']], an audio clip was available that depicted Harvey Dent walking up to a hostage situation and subduing the threat. While this may not be a direct adaptation, it does resemble the scene with the hostage situation in ''Batman: Year One'', only replacing James Gordon with Harvey Dent ([[Aaron Eckhart]]). Although the entire incident and Dent's role occurs out of earshot and thus did not require Aaron Eckhart to play out the clip.
*The concluding scene where Two-Face holds Gordon's family at gunpoint, is reminiscent of the ''Year One'' scene where Gordon's family is at danger from The Roman and Loeb's men. Batman saves Gordon's son from a fall in the film just as he does in the book.

'''Bi-directional text''' is text containing text in both [[Writing_system#Directionality|text directionalities]], both right-to-left (RTL) and left-to-right (LTR). It generally involves text containing different types of [[alphabet]]s, but may also refer to [[boustrophedon]], which is changing text directionality in each row.

Some [[writing system]]s of the world, notably the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] scripts, are written in a form known as right-to-left (RTL), in which writing begins at the right-hand side of a page and concludes at the left-hand side. This is different from the left-to-right (LTR) direction used by most languages in the world. When LTR text is mixed with RTL in the same paragraph, each type of text is written in its own direction, which is known as ''bi-directional text''. This can get rather complex when multiple levels of quotation are used.

Many computer programs fail to display bi-directional text correctly.
For example, the Hebrew name Sarah (שרה) is spelled shin (ש) resh (ר) heh (ה) from right to left.
Some [[Web browser]]s may display the Hebrew text in this article in the opposite direction.

== Languages using bi-directional text ==
There are very few [[Writing system|scripts]] that can be written in either direction.

Such was the case with [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphics]], where the signs had a distinct &quot;head&quot; that faced the beginning of a line and &quot;tail&quot; that faced the end.

[[Chinese characters]] can also be written in either direction as well as vertically (top to bottom then right to left), especially in signs (such as plaques), but the orientation of the individual characters is never changed. This can often be seen on tour buses in China, where the company name customarily runs from the front of the vehicle to its rear - that is, from right to left on the right side of the bus, and from left to right on the left side of the bus.
&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Hainan Airlines - Boeing 737-86N.jpg| On the right side of this [[Hainan Airlines]] aircraft, the text runs from right to left (&amp;nbsp;空&amp;nbsp;航&amp;nbsp;南&amp;nbsp;海&amp;nbsp;).
Image:Hainan Airlines.JPG|The left side, however, shows the text running from left to right (&amp;nbsp;海&amp;nbsp;南&amp;nbsp;航&amp;nbsp;空&amp;nbsp;).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Another variety of writing style, called ''[[boustrophedon]],'' was used in some ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] inscriptions, [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], and [[Hungarian runes]]. This method of writing alternates direction, and usually reverses the individual characters,  on each successive line.

== Unicode support ==
'''Bidirectional script support''' is the capability of a [[computer]] system to correctly display bi-directional text. The term is often shortened to the [[jargon]] term '''BiDi''' or '''bidi'''.

Early computer installations were designed only to support a single [[writing system]], typically for left-to-right scripts based on the [[Latin alphabet]] only.  Adding new [[character set]]s and [[character encoding]]s enabled a number of other left-to-right scripts to be supported, but did not easily support right-to-left scripts such as [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] or [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and mixing the two was not practical. It is possible to simply flip the left-to-right display order to a right-to-left display order, but doing this sacrifices the ability to correctly display left-to-right scripts. With bidirectional script support, it is possible to mix scripts from different scripts on the same page, regardless of writing direction.

In particular, the [[Unicode]] standard provides foundations for complete BiDi support, with detailed rules as to how mixtures of left-to-right and right-to-left scripts are to be encoded and displayed.

In Unicode encoding, all non-punctuation [[Character (computing)|characters]] are stored in writing order. This means that the writing direction of characters is stored within the characters. If this is the case, the character is called &quot;strong&quot;. Punctuation characters however, can appear in both LTR and RTL scripts. They are called &quot;weak&quot; characters because they do not contain any directional information. So it is up to the software to decide in which direction these &quot;weak&quot; characters will be placed. Sometimes (in mixed-directions text) this leads to display errors, caused by the BiDi-algorithm that runs through the text and identifies LTR and RTL strong characters and assigns a direction to weak characters, according to the algorithm's rules.

In the algorithm, each sequence of concatenated strong characters is called a &quot;run&quot;. A weak character that is located between two strong characters with the same orientation will inherit their orientation. A weak character that is located between two strong characters with a different writing direction, will inherit the main context's writing direction (in an LTR document the character will become LTR, in an RTL document, it will become RTL). If a &quot;weak&quot; character is followed by another &quot;weak&quot; character, the algorithm will look at the first neighbouring &quot;strong&quot; character. Sometimes this leads to unintentional display errors. These errors are corrected or prevented with &quot;pseudo-strong&quot; characters. Such [[Unicode control characters]] are called ''marks''. The mark ({{unichar|200E|Left-to-right mark|link=|html=|note=LRM}} or {{unichar|200F|Right-to-left mark|link=|html=|note=RLM}}) is to be inserted into a location to make an enclosed weak character inherit its writing direction.

For example, to correctly display the {{unichar|2122|trade mark sign}} for an English name brand (LTR) in an Arabic (RTL) passage, an LRM mark is inserted after the trademark symbol if the symbol is not followed by LTR text. If the LRM mark is not added, the weak character {{unicode|&amp;#x2122;}} will be neighbored by a strong LTR character and a strong RTL character. Hence, in an RTL context, it will be considered to be RTL, and displayed in an incorrect order.

Possible BiDi-types of a character, to be used by the BiDi algorithm, are:

In [[real analysis]], '''Bernoulli's inequality''' (named after [[Jacob Bernoulli]]) is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] that approximates [[exponentiation]]s of&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''.

The inequality states that

:&lt;math&gt;(1 + x)^r \geq 1 + rx\!&lt;/math&gt;

for every [[integer]] ''r''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 and every [[real number]] ''x''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1. If the exponent ''r'' is [[even number|even]], then the inequality is valid for ''all'' real numbers&amp;nbsp;''x''. The strict version of the inequality reads

:&lt;math&gt;(1 + x)^r &gt; 1 + rx\!&lt;/math&gt;

for every integer ''r''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2 and every real number ''x''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1 with ''x''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0.

Bernoulli's inequality is often used as the crucial step in the [[proof (math)|proof]] of other inequalities. It can itself be proved using [[mathematical induction]], as shown below.

==Proof of the inequality==

For ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,

:&lt;math&gt;(1+x)^0 \ge 1+0x \, &lt;/math&gt;

is equivalent to 1&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 which is true as required.

Now suppose the statement is true for ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k'':

:&lt;math&gt;(1+x)^k \ge 1+kx. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Then it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; {} \qquad (1+x)(1+x)^k \ge (1+x)(1+kx)\quad\text{(by hypothesis, since }(1+x)\ge 0) \\
&amp; \iff (1+x)^{k+1} \ge 1+kx+x+kx^2, \\
&amp; \iff (1+x)^{k+1} \ge 1+(k+1)x+kx^2.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

However, as 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''kx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''x''  (since ''kx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0), it follows that (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'')&lt;sup&gt;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''x'', which means the statement is true for ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 as required.

By induction we conclude the statement is true for all&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0.

==Generalization==

The exponent ''r'' can be generalized to an arbitrary real number as follows: if ''x''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1, then

:&lt;math&gt;(1 + x)^r \geq 1 + rx\!&lt;/math&gt;

for ''r''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;0 or ''r''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1, and

:&lt;math&gt;(1 + x)^r \leq 1 + rx\!&lt;/math&gt;

for 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1.

This generalization can be proved by comparing [[derivative]]s.
Again, the strict versions of these inequalities require ''x''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 and&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1.

== Related inequalities ==
The following inequality estimates the ''r''-th power of 1 + ''x'' from the other side. For any real numbers ''x'',&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, one has

:&lt;math&gt;(1 + x)^r \le e^{rx},\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''e'' = [[e (number)|2.718...]].  This may be proved using the inequality&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/''k'')&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''e''.

The '''''Benjamin Franklin'' class''' of [[submarine]] was an evolutionary development from the [[James Madison class submarine|''James Madison'' class]] of [[fleet ballistic missile submarine]].  Having quieter machinery and other improvements, they are considered a separate class. A subset of this class is the re-engineered 640 class starting with {{USS|George C. Marshall| SSBN-654}}.  Together with the [[George Washington class submarine|''George Washington'']], [[Ethan Allen class submarine|''Ethan Allen'']], [[Lafayette class submarine|''Lafayette'']], and ''James Madison'' classes, they comprised the &quot;[[41 for Freedom]]&quot; original 41 fleet ballistic missile submarines.

The ''Benjamin Franklin''-class submarines were built with the [[Polaris missile|Polaris A-3]] [[ballistic missile]], and later converted to carry the [[Poseidon missile|Poseidon C-3]].  During the late 1970s and early 1980s, selected units were further modified to carry [[Trident missile|Trident-I (C-4)]] ballistic missiles.

Two submarines of this class were converted for delivery of [[special warfare]] units ashore. In the early 1990s, to make room for the [[Ohio class submarine|''Ohio''-class ballistic missile submarines]] within the limits set by the [[SALT II]] strategic arms limitation treaty, the ballistic missile tubes of {{USS|Kamehameha|SSBN-642}} and {{USS|James K. Polk|SSBN-645}} were disabled. Those boats were redesignated [[special operations]] [[attack submarine]]s and given attack submarine (SSN) [[hull classification symbol|hull numbers]].

USS ''Kamehameha'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] on 2 April 2002, the last ship of the ''Benjamin Franklin'' class to be decommissioned.

The '''Bastard Operator From Hell''' ('''BOFH'''), a [[fictional character]] created by [[Simon Travaglia]], is a rogue [[system administrator]] who takes out his anger on [[user (computing)|user]]s (often referred to as [[luser]]s), colleagues, bosses, and anyone else who gets in his way.

The BOFH stories were originally posted in 1992 to [[Usenet]] by Travaglia, with some being reprinted in [[Datamation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
 | url = http://bofh.ntk.net/BOFH/index.php
 | title = The Bastard Operator from Hell Official Archive
 | first = Simon
 | last = Travaglia
 | publisher =  Datamation Magazine
}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were published weekly from 1995 to 1999 in [[Network Week]] and since 2000 they have been published most weeks in [[The Register]].  They were also published in [[PC Plus]] magazine for a short time, and several books of the stories have also been released.

By extension, the term is also used to refer to any [[system administrator]] who displays (or wishes he could get away with) the qualities of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Eric S.|last=Raymond |title=The new hacker's dictionary|isbn=978-0262680929|year=1996|publisher=The MIT Press|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has become common [[Internet slang]]. 

In the stories, the PFY (Pimply-Faced Youth) is the BOFH's assistant; this too has become a general term for a junior or trainee system administrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=PFY|title=Urban Dictionary: PFY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==

Early BOFH editions took place in a university, moving on to an office workplace over time (an exact transition is not given). BOFH 2k began with the BOFH and PFY moving to a new company.

Whilst the BOFH and PFY got irritated at the incompetence of users, they used this to their advantage to further their devious means, mainly using the following tricks:

* Deleting users' files
* Deleting users&lt;!-- this used to say &quot;User's Accounts, but this refers to the users themselves --&gt; (by arranging &quot;accidents&quot;)
* Lifting [[raised floor]] tiles so users (or engineers, or the Boss) fall down
* Quicklime pit
* Electrocuting users (from an over-voltage [[cattle prod]], using nails as fuses, or by other means)
* Locking the machine room and triggering the [[Halomethane|Halon]] release
* Trapping them in the [[elevator]]
* Slamming their [[testicles]] in desk drawers
* Pushing users off the comms riser
* [[Blackmail]], either with real or electronically fabricated evidence
* Putting users on the [[FBI]]'s [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list]]
* Destroying systems with etherkillers (power plugs spliced onto a piece of [[RG-58|coax cable]]), or talking users into destroying their own systems.
* Locking them in the airtight tape safe
* Putting [[laxatives]] in their food or coffee

Early BOFH editions focused mainly on the above tricks, although over time many other schemes and plots have been used, with many now aimed at management as well as the users. Early BOFH editions simply featured the BOFH, the systems manager and the [[luser]]s — as time developed, the Boss, PFY and other characters (see below) appeared.

An additional technique featured in recent stories is &quot;Wikisalting&quot;, which involves the creation of Wikipedia articles by the protagonists to support their theories, excuses, or cover ups. Two of the most prominent examples of this technique are the Mandelboozer Virus (also known as Mandelbrot virus, MandelBank virus and Mandelboat virus)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Travaglia |first=Simon |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/03/bofh_2008_episode_32/ |title=BOFH: The Mandelboat virus |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=2008-10-03 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Reggie Moore's Inverse Square Law of IT Satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Travaglia |first=Simon |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/11/07/bofh_2008_episode_36/ |title=BOFH: Taking out a contract |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=2008-11-07 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==

The following characters appear regularly :

'''Walter Brown (&quot;Brownie&quot;) McGhee''' (November 30, 1915 - February 16, 1996&lt;ref&gt;[http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1996.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com - accessed December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[blues]] singer and guitarist best known for his collaborations with the harmonica player [[Sonny Terry]].

==Life and career==
Brownie McGhee was born in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] and grew up in [[Kingsport, Tennessee]]. As a child he had polio, which incapacitated his leg. His brother Granville [[Stick McGhee|&quot;Sticks&quot; or &quot;Stick&quot; McGhee]] was nicknamed for pushing young Brownie around in a cart. His father, George McGhee, was a factory worker known around University Avenue for playing guitar and singing. Brownie's uncle made him a guitar from a tin marshmallow box and a piece of board.&lt;ref&gt;Neely, Jack. Knoxville's Secret History.  Scruffy City Publishing, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; McGhee spent much of his youth immersed in music, singing with local harmony group the Golden Voices Gospel Quartet and teaching himself to play guitar. A [[March of Dimes]]-funded leg operation enabled McGhee to walk. 

At age 22, Brownie McGhee became a traveling musician, working in the [[Rabbit Foot Minstrels]] and befriending [[Blind Boy Fuller]], whose guitar playing influenced him greatly. After Fuller's death in 1941, [[J. B. Long]] of [[Columbia Records]] had McGhee adopt his mentor's name, branding him &quot;Blind Boy Fuller No. 2.&quot; By that time, McGhee was recording for Columbia's subsidiary [[Okeh Records]] in Chicago, but his real success came after he moved to New York in 1942, when he teamed up with [[Sonny Terry]], whom he had known since 1939 when Sonny was Blind Boy Fuller's harmonica player. The pairing was an overnight success; as well as recording, they toured together until around 1980. As a duo, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee did most of their work from 1958 until 1980, spending 11 months of each year touring, and recording dozens of albums.

Despite their later fame as &quot;pure&quot; folk artists playing for white audiences, in the 1940s Terry and McGhee also attempted to be successful black recording performers, fronting a [[jump blues]] combo with honking saxophone and rolling piano, variously calling themselves &quot;Brownie McGhee and his Jook House Rockers&quot; or &quot;Sonny Terry and his Buckshot Five,&quot; often with [[Champion Jack Dupree]] and [[Big Chief Ellis]]. They also appeared in the original Broadway productions of ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' and ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]''.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Browniemcghee.jpg|left|200px]] --&gt;
During the [[Roots revival|blues revival]] of the 1960s, Terry and McGhee were very popular on the concert and music festival circuits, occasionally adding new material but usually remaining faithful to their roots and their audience. With Sonny Terry, he appeared in the 1979 [[Steve Martin]] comedy ''[[The Jerk]]''. In 1987, McGhee gave a small but memorable performance as ill-fated blues singer Toots Sweet in the supernatural thriller movie, ''[[Angel Heart]].'' He also appeared in a 1988 episode of &quot;Family Ties&quot; titled &quot;The Blues Brother&quot; in which he played fictional blues musician Eddie Dupre.

[[Happy Traum]], a former guitar student of Brownie's, edited a blues guitar instruction guide and songbook for him. Using a tape recorder, Traum had McGhee instruct and, between lessons, talk about his life and the blues. ''Guitar Styles of Brownie McGhee'' was published in New York in 1971. The autobiographical section features Brownie talking about growing up, his musical beginnings, and a history of the early blues period (1930s onward).

One of McGhee's final concert appearances was at the 1995 [[Chicago Blues Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot;/&gt;

McGhee died from [[stomach cancer]] in February 1996 in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]] at age 80; he missed his planned return trip to Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;dead rock&quot;&gt;[http://search.atomz.com/search/?sp_a=sp1000ee84&amp;sp_f=ISO-8859-1&amp;sp_q=%22BROWNIE+McGhee%2 Dead Rock Stars website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BIPM courtyard.jpg|thumb|260px|The bureau.]]
The '''International Bureau of Weights and Measures''' ({{lang-fr|'''Bureau international des poids et mesures'''}}), is an international [[standards organization|standards organisation]], one of three such organisations established to maintain the [[International System of Units]] (SI) under the terms of the [[Metre Convention]] (''Convention du Mètre''). The organisation is usually referred to by its French [[Acronym and initialism|initialism]], '''BIPM'''.

The other organisations that maintain the SI system, also known by their French initialisms are the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] ({{lang-fr|Conférence générale des poids et mesures}}) (CGPM) and the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] ({{lang-fr|Comité international des poids et mesures}}) (CIPM).

==History==

The BIPM was created on 20 May 1875, following the signing of the [[Metre Convention]], a [[treaty]] among 51 nations ({{as of|2008|8|lc=on}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;bipm-history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/history-si/|title=Brief history of the SI|publisher=BIPM|accessdate=2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based at the [[Pavillon de Breteuil]] in [[Sèvres]], [[France]], granted to the Bureau in 1876, where it enjoys [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorial]] status&lt;ref name=&quot;bipm-status&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/bipm/history/hist10.html|title=The BIPM from 1875 to the Present Day|publisher=BIPM|accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Analysis and Control Methods for Food and Agricultural Products, Quality Control for Food and Agricultural Products, Volume 1 | first=J. L. | last=Multon | publisher=Wiley-IEEE | year=1996 | isbn=0471186171 | page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page=146 | title=Taming the Atom | first=Hans Christian | last=Von Baeyer | publisher=Courier Dover Publications | year=2000 | isbn=0486414477 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==

Under the authority of the Metric Convention, the BIPM helps to ensure uniformity of SI weights and measures around the world.  It does so through a series of consultative committees, whose members are the national [[metrology]] laboratories of the Convention's member states, and through its own laboratory work.

The BIPM carries out measurement-related research. It takes part in and organises international comparisons of national measurement standards and performs calibrations for member states.

The BIPM has an important role in maintaining accurate worldwide time of day. It combines, analyzes, and averages the official atomic time standards of member nations around the world to create a single, official [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC).

'''Bayonne''' ({{IPA-fr|bajɔn}}; [[Gascon language|Gascon]] and {{lang-eu|Baiona}}) is a city and [[Communes of France|commune]] in south-western [[France]] at the confluence of the [[Nive]] and [[Adour]] rivers, in the [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]] [[Departments of France|department]], of which it is a [[Subprefectures in France|sub-prefecture]]. It belongs to both [[Cultural region|vernacular cultural regions]] of [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] and [[Gascony]].

Together with nearby [[Anglet]], [[Biarritz]], [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]], and several smaller communes, Bayonne forms an [[urban area]] with 178,965 inhabitants at the 1999 census, 40,078 of whom lived in the city of Bayonne proper (44,300 as of 2004 estimates).

The communes of Bayonne, Biarritz, and Anglet have joined into an [[Communes of France#Intercommunality|intercommunal]] entity called the ''Communauté d'agglomération de Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz (BAB).

==History==
In the 3rd century AD, the area was the site of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ''[[castrum]]'', named ''Lapurdum''. It was a military site, but not a [[port]].
In 840, the [[Vikings]] appeared before Lapurdum. In 842, with their chieftain [[Björn Ironside]] they launched a large-scale inland offensive and settled outside the city on the river bank. Lapurdum was an ''[[oppidum]]'' and they needed a port. Bayonne (from Basque ''ibai'', &quot;river&quot;) became a key place on the route between the Adour and Ebro Rivers, which served as a kind of link between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} This commercial route was the main goal of Danish invaders in France. By this route, they could easily reach Muslim-controlled [[Tortosa]], which was the main marketplace in Europe dealing with slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Joël Supéry, ''[[Le Secret des Vikings]]''&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

By the 13th century, the city was an important port, with a mixed [[Basque people|Basque]] and [[Gascony|Gascon]] population. As part of [[Aquitaine]], it was ruled by [[England]] between 1151 to 1452 and was a key commercial center at the southern end of the English kingdom. 

Its importance waned somewhat when the French king, [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]], took the city at the end of the [[Hundred Years' War]] and the Adour changed course shortly afterwards, leaving Bayonne without its access to the sea. The French, however, realised Bayonne's strategic site near the [[Spain|Spanish]] border and in 1578 dug a canal to again redirect the river through the city.

Bayonne endured numerous [[siege]]s from [[Plantagenet]] times until the end of the [[First French Empire]] in 1814. In the 17th century, [[Vauban]] built large fortifications and the [[Citadel]]le in and around the city. These proved crucial in 1813 and 1814, when [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]]'s army besieged the city in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], only taking it when they used a bridge of ships across the Adour to position artillery around the city.

Bayonne's location close to the border, but also within the Basque Country straddling both France and Spain, gave it an often privileged position in commerce. Basque sailors travelled the world, bringing back products such as [[cinnamon]] and riches from piracy and the [[whaling]] and [[cod]] trades. An armaments industry developed, giving the world the &quot;[[bayonet]]&quot;. [[Jewish]] refugees from the [[Spanish Inquisition]] from 1560 brought new trades, most notably chocolate-making, which is still important in Bayonne. Spanish Basques also sought refuge in Bayonne in the 20th century during [[Francisco Franco]]'s repression, with Petit Bayonne still a centre of [[Basque nationalism]].
[[File:Bayonne.JPG|right|thumb|Bayonne. View from the other side]]
By the mid-19th century, Bayonne had declined somewhat with the centralisation of power to [[Paris]] and to the new ''[[Départements of France|département]]'' capital, non-Basque [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], after the 1789 [[French Revolution]], and with Wellington's bombardment. However, rail links with [[Paris]] from 1854 and the growing importance of nearby Biarritz as a tourist centre brought industrialisation and development. Bayonne is now part of 'BAB' (Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz), a metropolitan area of almost 200,000 people.

==Main sights==
The Nive divides Bayonne into [[Grand Bayonne]] and [[Petit Bayonne]], with five bridges between the two, both quarters still backed by Vauban's walls. The houses lining the Nive are examples of Basque architecture, with half-timbering and shutters in the national colours of red and green. The much wider Adour is to the north. The Pont Saint-Esprit connects Petit Bayonne with the Quartier Saint-Esprit across the [[Adour]], where the massive Citadelle and the railway station are located.

Grand Bayonne is the commercial and civic hub, with small pedestrianised streets packed with shops, plus the cathedral and [[City and town halls|Hôtel de Ville]].

The [[Bayonne Cathedral|Cathédrale Sainte-Marie]] is an imposing, elegant [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building, rising over the houses, glimpsed along the narrow streets. It was constructed in the 12th and 13th centuries. The south tower was completed in the 16th century but the cathedral was only completed in the 19th century with the north tower.
The cathedral is noted for its charming [[cloister]]s. There are other details and sculptures of note, although much was destroyed in the [[French Revolution|Revolution]].

Nearby is the Château Vieux, some of which dates back to the 12th century, where the governors of the city were based, including the English [[Edward, the Black Prince|Black Prince]].

The Musée Basque is the finest ethnographic museum of the entire Basque Country. It opened in 1922 but has been closed for a decade recently for refurbishment. It now has special exhibitions on Basque agriculture, seafaring and ''[[Basque pelota|pelota]]'', handicrafts and Basque history and way of life.

The [[Musée Bonnat]] began with a large collection bequeathed by the local-born painter [[Léon Bonnat]]. The museum is one of the best galleries in south west France and has paintings by [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], [[El Greco]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Francisco Goya|Goya]] among others.

At the back of Petit Bayonne is the Château Neuf, among the ramparts. Now an exhibition space, it was started by the newly-arrived French in 1460 to control the city. The walls nearby have been opened to visitors. They are important for plant life now and Bayonne's [[Jardin botanique de Bayonne|botanic gardens]] adjoin the walls on both sides of the Nive.

The area across the Adour is largely residential and industrial, with much demolished to make way for the railway. The Saint-Esprit church was part of a bigger complex built by [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] to care for [[Way of St James|pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela]]. It is home to a wooden ''Flight into Egypt'' sculpture.

Overlooking the quarter is Vauban's 1680 Citadelle. The soldiers of Wellington's army who died besieging the citadelle in 1813 are buried in the nearby English Cemetery, visited by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and other British dignitaries when staying in [[Biarritz]].

The distillery of the famous local liqueur, ''[[Izarra (liqueur)|Izarra]]'', is on the northern bank of the Adour and is open to visitors.

==Culture and sport==
Bayonne has the longest tradition of [[bull-fighting]] in France and there is a ring beyond the walls of Grand Bayonne. The season runs between July and September.
Bull-fighting is part of the five-day [[Fêtes de Bayonne]] which starts on the first Wednesday of August and attracts people from across the Basque Country and beyond. Parades, music, dance, fireworks, food and drink all feature in the celebrations. Soon after the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] festival of 15 August heralds a few more days of bull-fights.

There are also important festivals of Jazz (July), [[Bayonne ham]] ([[Holy Week]]), theatre and ''pelota'' (the Basque sport).

[[Aviron Bayonnais]] is the city's [[rugby union]] club, founded in 1904 and French champions three times, in 1913, 1934 and 1943. The local [[association football|football]] team is [[Aviron Bayonnais FC]].

==Economy and products==
Bayonne is known for its fine chocolates, produced in the town for 500 years, and [[Bayonne ham]], a cured ham seasoned with peppers from nearby [[Espelette]]. [[Izarra (liqueur)|Izarra]], the liqueur made in bright green or yellow colours, is distilled locally. It is said by some that Bayonne is the birthplace of [[mayonnaise]], supposedly a corruption of ''Bayonnaise'', the French adjective describing the city's people and produce. Now bayonnaise can refer to a particular mayonnaise flavoured with the Espelette chillis.

Bayonne is now the centre of certain craft industries that were once widespread, including the manufacture of ''[[makila]]s'', traditional Basque walking-sticks. The Fabrique Alza just outside the city is known for its ''palas'', bats used in [[Basque pelota|''pelota'']], the traditional Basque sport.

As of 1935, its chief industries were [[shipbuilding]], [[tanning]], and [[pottery]].
In the late 20th century, the processing of by-products from the [[Lacq]] [[natural gas]] field near Pau became important, although Bayonne has had higher-than-average unemployment. [[Metallurgy]] also provides local jobs.

==Transport==
The [[Gare de Bayonne]] is on the high-speed [[TGV]] line between Paris and [[Hendaye]] for connections with Spain. In practice, the line slows considerably beyond [[Bordeaux]] although there are plans to improve the service. There are regional rail services along the Basque coast, to Pau and through the [[Landes (department)|Landes]] to [[Dax, Landes|Dax]] and Bordeaux. There is a line along the Nive valley through Labourd and [[Lower Navarre]] to [[Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port]], used principally by tourists and hikers.

There are extensive bus connections with Biarritz, Anglet and surrounding villages. The city is near the intersection between the [[A63 autoroute]] between Bordeaux and the Spanish border and the [[A64 autoroute|A64]] from Bayonne to [[Toulouse]].

Bayonne's airport is [[Aéroport de Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne]] {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from the city towards [[Anglet]] and is shared with [[Biarritz]] and Anglet.

The city bus system is [http://www.bus-stab.com/ STAB] (Transports Urbains de l'agglomération de Bayonne).

Bayonne harbour is a stop over for yachts and boats crossing the Gulf of Biscay on their way from the UK to the Iberian Peninsula, the Atlantic or the Mediterranean. [http://www.michaelbriant.com/sn1.htm The direct route from the UK across the bay of Biscay and down to Atlantic Spain and Portugal]

{{nihongo|'''''Bubblegum Crisis'''''|バブルガムクライシス|Baburugamu Kuraishisu}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[cyberpunk]] [[OVA|direct-to-video]] [[anime|animated series]]. It displays strong influences from ''[[Blade Runner]]'', also making occasional references to it.

== Setting ==
The series begins in the late 2032, seven years after the Second Great Kanto Earthquake has split [[Tokyo]] geographically and culturally in two. During the first episode, disparities in wealth are shown to be more pronounced than in previous periods in post-war Japan.

The main antagonist is Genom, a [[megacorporation]] with immense power and global influence. Its main product are [[Boomer (Bubblegum Crisis)|boomers]] - cyberdroids used for manual labor and military purposes. While Boomers are intended to serve mankind, they become deadly instruments in the hands of ruthless individuals. The [[AD Police]] are tasked to deal with Boomer-related crimes. One of the series' themes is the inability of the department to deal with threats due to political infighting, red tape, and an insufficient budget.

The [[List of Bubblegum Crisis characters#Knight Sabers and allies|Knight Sabers]] are an all-female [[mercenary]] team and have considerable combat abilities using highly advanced suits of powered armor. They battle against long odds to overcome grave threats throughout the OVA series and preserve the overall safety of Mega Tokyo.

{{Ref improve section|date=February 2011}}
The [[Original Video Animation|OVA]] series is eight episodes long. It was originally slated to run for 13 episodes, but due to legal problems between the two studios who jointly held the rights to the series, '''Artmic''' and '''Youmex''', the series was discontinued. The problems may have been brought on by the series' lackluster sales in [[Japan]]. In [[North America]], however, the series did comparatively well and has remained a fan favorite. 

In Japan, a number of comic books were produced that featured characters and storylines based in the BGC (a common abbreviation for the series name) universe. Some were very much thematically linked to the OVA series, others were &quot;one shots&quot; or comedy features. A number of artists participated in the creation of these comics, including [[Kenichi Sonoda]], who had produced the original Knight Saber character designs. A North American comic based in the Bubblegum Crisis Universe was published in [[English language|English]] by [[Dark Horse Comics]].

The series involves the adventures of the Knight Sabers, an all woman group of [[mercenaries]] who don [[powered armor]] and fight various problems, most frequently rogue [[Boomer (anime term)|boomer]]s. Boomers are humanoid robots designed to perform a variety of tasks, from construction and firefighting to combat; a particular model of Boomer, the BU-33S &quot;Sexaroid&quot;, is designed for sexual purpose, and also in need of human blood, as been revealed in episode 5

One of the central themes of the series, showing its ''[[Blade Runner]]'' influence strongly, is the exploration of what &quot;[[human]]&quot; really means. As in ''Blade Runner'', this is often done by using the android characters, especially focusing on BU-33S.

Bubblegum Crisis was notable also in that it was one of the few early anime series that were brought over from [[Japan]] unedited and subtitled with [[English language|English]] captions that still have a great deal of popularity today. While anime has become much more popular in the intervening years, in 1991 it was still mostly unknown as a storytelling medium in North America. 

In 1997, a new series was created, titled ''[[Bubblegum Crisis 2040]]'', but was not a sequel to the original OVA series. Headed by [[Chiaki J. Konaka]], it was a standalone television series, and while it used similar themes to the original, it employed new designs for the characters and the mechanical devices. This series ran for twenty six episodes. Some discussion has taken place between the production companies for a second season, tentatively titled ''Bubblegum Crisis 2041''.

Despite the age of the original series, a non-Japanese fandom still exists for it. The community of fans have produced large quantities of [[Fan fiction]] and [[Fan art]] based on both the OVA and television series with the current estimated count of fanfiction in English language alone well exceeding four hundred texts,&lt;ref name=&quot;fiction-guide&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ravensgarage.com/bgcfanfic_guide/bgc.html |title=Bubblegum Crisis Fan Fiction Guide |accessdate=2009-03-28 |year=2000}} Last version of the guide names 350 texts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fiction-archive&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.eyrie.org/anime/BGC/ |title=Bubblegum Crisis fanfiction archive |accessdate=2007-03-28}} The BGC fanfiction repository on eyrie.org archive has over 400 texts. These do not fully overlap with ones named in the Fanfiction guide.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fanfiction.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanfiction.net/anime/Bubblegum_Crisis/ |title=fanfiction.net Bubblegum Crisis category |accessdate=2007-07-19}}The Bubblegum Crisis category on fanfiction.net lists further 292 texts, although it is unknown how many of them overlap with previously mentioned sources.&lt;/ref&gt; though there is a preponderance of works and discussion based on the original series.

Bubblegum Crisis has many features that have proven attractive to many viewers of anime. The mecha designs, cyberpunk characters, and post-apocalyptic city of Megatokyo are well-realized and leave a lasting impression. The storylines are varied and complex, with some elements left deliberately unexplained and open to interpretation. 

The music throughout the original OVA series is one of the most recognizable in anime fandom and generates a strong feeling of 1980's nostalgia. The opening song and sequence for the first OVA, as well as many of the other songs throughout the series, clearly draw inspiration from the 1984 movie [[Streets of Fire]]. Nearly all of the music is available, as there are 8 soundtrack releases (one per OVA), as well as numerous &quot;vocal&quot; albums which feature songs &quot;inspired by&quot; the series as well as many drawn directly from it. As a consequence Bubblegum Crisis, with its better than 1:1 soundtrack album to episode ratio (when one considers the &quot;vocal&quot; albums), may arguably have among the highest number of [[album|album-length]] music collections (percentage-wise) which may be attributed to any single title in contemporary anime.

A [[roleplaying game]] based on the series was published by [[R. Talsorian]] in 1997 under the [[Fuzion]] system. It contains many original sketches of the characters, mecha and settings, as well as detailed background information about them. A supplement detailing the 1997 series was planned, but could not be completed before RTG's license expired in 2002.

A digitally-remastered compilation of the original series' episodes, featuring bi-lingual tracks and production extras, was released on DVD in 2004 by [[AnimEigo]] Inc.

{{race}}
The term '''black people''' is used in [[Race (classification of human beings)|systems of racial classification]] for humans of a [[Human skin color|dark skinned]] [[phenotype]], relative to other racial groups. Different societies apply different criteria regarding who is classified as &quot;black&quot;, and often social variables such as class, socio-economic status also plays a role so that relatively dark skinned people can be classified as white if they fulfill other social criteria of whiteness and relatively light skinned people can be classified as black if they fulfill the social criteria for blackness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = McPherson  |first =Lionel K |coauthor=   Shelby, Tommie |year = 2008|title = Blackness and Blood: Interpreting African American Identity|url =http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/content/BPL_Images/Journal_Samples/PAPA0048-3915~32~2~10%5C010.pdf |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc  |isbn= |page=179|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a biological phenotype being &quot;black&quot; is often associated with the very dark [[Human skin color|skin color]]s of some people who are classified as 'black'. But, particularly in the United States, the racial classification also refers to people with all possible kinds of skin pigmentation from the darkest through to the very lightest skin colors, including [[albinos]], if they are believed by others to have African ancestry and exhibit cultural traits associated with being &quot;[[African-American]]&quot;. Therefore, the term 'black people' is not an indicator of skin color but of racial classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last =Glenn |first =Evelyn Nakano  |coauthor= |year = 2009|title =Shades of difference: why skin color matters |url =http://books.google.ca/books?id=WewhspE2Q9UC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;dq=Shades%20of%20difference%3A%20why%20skin%20color%20matters&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|page=225 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=9780804759984|accessdate = |postscript =&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Some definitions of the term include only people of relatively recent [[Sub Saharan Africa]]n descent (see [[African diaspora]]). Among the members of this group, dark skin is most often accompanied by the expression of natural [[Afro-textured hair|afro-hair texture]] (recent scientific study notes that human skin color diversity is highest in sub-Saharan African populations).&lt;ref&gt;Human skin color diversity is highest or sub-Saharan African populations. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11126724 NIH.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions of the term &quot;black people&quot; extend to other populations characterized by dark skin, including some indigenous to [[Oceania]] and [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Various isolated populations in Southeast Asia sometimes classified as black include the [[Austronesian]]s and [[Papuan]]s, the [[Andamanese]] islanders, the [[Semang]] people of the [[Malay peninsula]], the [[Aeta]] people of [[Luzon]], and some other small populations of indigenous peoples.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;black.

The evolution of dark skin is linked intrinsically to the loss of body hair in humans.
By 1.2 million years ago, all people having descendants today had the same receptor protein of today's Africans; their skin was dark, and the intense sun lowered the chance of survival of those with lighter skin that resulted from mutational variation in the receptor protein.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogers&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Alan R.|title=Genetic variation at the MC1R locus and the time since loss of human body hair|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=45|issue=1|pages=105–8|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/381006|accessdate=2008-07-22|doi=10.1086/381006|month=February | year=2004|oclc=193553649|publisher=The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research|last2=Iltis|first2=David|last3=Wooding|first3=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is significantly earlier than the [[speciation]] of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' from ''[[Homo erectus]]'' some 250,000 years ago.

[[Skin cancer]] as a result of [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]] radiation causing mutations in the skin is less common among people with dark skin than it is among those with light skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Skin Cancer |first=Keyvan |last=Nouri |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |page=32 |year=2007 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=TlhFQYziim8C&amp;pg=PA32 |isbn=0-071-47256-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Health and Wellness|first1=Gordon |last1=Edlin |first2=Eric |last2=Golanty |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |year=312 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Ki_fbxDZsHcC&amp;pg=PA312 |isbn=0-763-76593-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, dark skin prevents an essential B vitamin, [[folate]], from being destroyed. Therefore, in the absence of modern medicine and diet, a person with dark skin in the tropics would live longer, be healthier and more likely to reproduce than a person with light skin. [[White people|White]] Australians have some of the highest rates of skin cancer as evidence of this expectation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Australia Struggles with Skin Cancer| url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_Australia_Struggles_with_Skin_Cancer.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, as dark skin prevents sunlight from penetrating the skin it hinders the production of [[vitamin D|vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Hence when humans migrated to less sun-intensive regions in the north, low [[vitamin D|vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] levels became a problem and lighter skin colors started appearing. White people of Europe, who have low levels of [[melanin]], naturally have an almost colorless skin pigmentation, especially when [[Sun tanning|untanned]]. This low level of pigmentation allows the blood vessels to become visible which gives the characteristic pale pink color of white people. The loss of melanin in white people is now thought to have been caused by a mutation in just one letter out of 3.1 billion letters of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/15/AR2005121501728_pf.html &quot;Scientists find DNA change accounting for white skin&quot;]. ''[[Washington Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hair===
{{Main|Natural afro-hair}}
The texture of [[hair]] in people of Sub-Saharan African ancestry is noticeably different from that of Eurasian populations, as was already noted by [[Herodotus]], who described the peoples of [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] (the &quot;western Ethiopians&quot;) as ''wooly-haired''.

Such &quot;[[natural afro-hair|afro-hair]]&quot; texture is denser than its straight counterparts. Due to this, it is often referred to as 'thick', 'bushy', or 'woolly'. For several reasons, possibly including its relatively flat cross section (among other factors&lt;ref&gt;Franbourg et al. &quot;Influence of Ethnic Origin of Hair on Water-Keratin Interaction&quot; In ''Ethnic Skin and Hair'' E. Berardesca, J. Leveque, and H. Maibach (Eds.). page 101. Informa Healthcare. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;), this hair type conveys a dry or matte appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrojo&quot;&gt;Nick Arrojo, Jenny Acheson, ''Great Hair: Secrets to Looking Fabulous and Feeling Beautiful Every Day'', (St. Martin's Press: 2008), p.184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;&gt;Dale H. Johnson, ''Hair and hair care'', (CRC Press: 1997), p.237&lt;/ref&gt; It is also very coarse,&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrojo&quot;/&gt; and its unique shape renders it very prone to breakage when combed or brushed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;/&gt;

The specific characteristics of the natural afro-hair form are unique among all mammals.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}}{{Dubious|date=July 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;''Ethnic Skin and Hair'' E. Berardesca, J. Leveque, and H. Maibach (Eds.). Informa Healthcare. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The texture likely predates the evolution of [[dark skin]]. It evolved when, as pre-human [[Australopithecines]] lost most of their fur to enable perspiration, the need to protect the newly exposed pale skin underneath this [[body hair]] was crucial (see&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, B. &quot;The hair follicle is a specialized UV receptor in human skin?&quot; ''Bio Signals Recep'', 7(3), pages 188–194. 1998{{Failed verification|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in light of Rogers and others., 2004 and Harding and others., 2000). The trait ceased to be essential to survival at the equator upon the evolution of hairless dark skin. Yet it has continued to be expressed vestigially among most Melanesians, Andaman Islanders, and sub-Saharan Africans.

[[Sub-Saharan Africa]] is a common, if imprecise term that encompasses African countries located south of the [[Sahara]] Desert. It is commonly used to differentiate the region culturally, ecologically, politically and, more controversially, [[Race (classification of human beings)|racially]], from [[North Africa]], which has historically been part of the Mediterranean sphere.
Because the indigenous people of this region are primarily dark-skinned, it is alternatively called &quot;Black Africa&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first = Lansana | last = Keita| title = Race, Identity and Africanity: A Reply to Eboussi Boulaga| journal = [[Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa|CODESRIA Bulletin]] | volume = 1 &amp; 2| pages = 16| year=  2004| publisher = [[Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some criticize the use of the term, because, having become in many quarters synonymous with ''Black Africa'', it can leave the mistaken impression that there are not indigenous Black populations in North Africa. Furthermore, the Sahara cuts across countries such as [[Mauritania]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Chad]], and [[Sudan]], leaving some parts of them in North Africa and some in sub-Saharan Africa.

[[Owen 'Alik Shahadah]] argues that the term sub-Saharan Africa has racist overtones:

{{quote|Sub-Saharan Africa is a racist byword for &quot;primitive&quot;, a place which has escaped advancement. Hence, we see statements like “no written languages exist in Sub-Saharan Africa.” “Ancient Egypt was not a Sub-Saharan African civilization.” Sub-Sahara serves as an exclusion, which moves, jumps and slides around to suit negative generalization of Africa.&lt;ref name=Shahadah/&gt;}}

However, some Black Africans prefer to be culturally distinguished from those who live in the north of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Keith B. | first = Richburg| title = Out of America: A Black Man Confronts Africa| publisher = Harvest/HBJ Book| date = Reprint edition (July 1, 1998)| isbn = 0156005832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural ideas of a black race==
===South Africa===
[[Image:San tribesman.jpg|thumb|right|130px|A [[Khoisan]] man, an ethnic group in South Africa.]]
In [[South Africa]] during the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid era]], the population was classified into four main racial groups: ''Black'', ''White'', ''[[Asia]]n'' (mostly [[India]]n), and ''[[Coloured]]''. &lt;!--These terms are capitalized to denote their legal definitions in South African law.--&gt; The Coloured group included people of mixed [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[Khoisan]], and [[European ethnic groups|European]] descent (with some [[Cape Malays|Malay]] ancestry, especially in the [[Western Cape]]). The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa.

The [[apartheid]] bureaucracy devised complex (and often arbitrary) criteria in the [[Population Registration Act]] to determine who belonged in which group. Minor officials administered tests to enforce the classifications. When it was unclear from a person's physical appearance whether a person was to be considered Colored or Black, the &quot;pencil test&quot; was employed. This involved inserting a pencil in a person's hair to determine if the hair was kinky enough for the pencil to get stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Nullis| first = Clare | title = Township tourism booming in South Africa| publisher = The Associated Press| year=  2007| url = http://www.canada.com/topics/travel/features/story.html?id=59ec6285-c9fb-41ab-93f9-419f62733f07&amp;k=67896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the apartheid era, those classed as 'Coloured' were oppressed and discriminated against. However, they did have limited rights and overall had slightly better socioeconomic conditions than those classed as 'Black'.

In the post-apartheid era, the ANC government's laws in support of their [[affirmative action]] policies define 'Black' people to include &quot;Africans&quot;, &quot;Coloureds&quot; and &quot;Asians&quot;. Their [[affirmative action]] policies have also favored 'Africans' over 'Coloureds'. Some South Africans categorized as 'African Black' openly state that 'Coloureds' did not suffer as much as they did during apartheid. The popular saying by 'Coloured' South Africans to illustrate their dilemma is:

{{quote|We were not white enough under apartheid, and we are not black enough under the ANC ([[African National Congress]])}}

In 2008, the High Court in South Africa ruled that [[Chinese South Africans]] who were residents during the apartheid era (and their descendents) are to be reclassified as &quot;Black people&quot; solely for the purposes of accessing affirmative action benefits, because they were also &quot;disadvantaged&quot; by racial discrimination. Chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article4168245.ece We agree that you are black, South African court tells Chinese], The Times&lt;/ref&gt; and neither do other black people who settled in South Africa from elsewhere after the end of the apartheid era.

Other than by appearance, 'Coloureds' can usually be distinguished from 'Blacks' by language. Most speak [[Afrikaans]] or English as a [[first language]], as opposed to [[Bantu languages]] such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]] or [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]. They also tend to have more European-sounding names than Bantu names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = du Preez| first = Max| title = Coloureds – the most authentic SA citizens| work= The Star|date=2006-04-13| url = http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3201857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]. July 27, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Afro-Asiatic languages]], which include [[Semitic languages]] such as [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew]], are believed by some scholars to have originated in [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0011-3204%28199802%2939%3A1%3C139%3ATALPAI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-J&amp;size=LARGE&amp;origin=JSTOR-enlargePage The Afroasiatic Language Phylum: African in Origin, or Asian?] Daniel F. Mc Call. (JSTOR)&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the region has very diverse language groups in close geographic proximity, often considered a telltale sign for a linguistic geographic origin.

In more recent times, about 1000 CE, interactions between black people and Arabs resulted in the incorporation of extensive Arabic vocabulary into [[Swahili language|Swahili]], which became a useful ''[[lingua franca]]'' for merchants. Some of this linguistic exchange occurred as part of the slave trade; the history of [[Islam and slavery]] shows that the [[Madh'hab|major juristic schools]] traditionally accepted the institution of [[slavery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;&gt;Lewis 1994, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html Ch.1]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Arab influence spread along the east coast of Africa and to some extent into the interior (see [[East Africa]]). [[Timbuktu]] was a trading outpost that linked [[west Africa]] with [[Berber people|Berber]], Arab, and Jewish traders throughout the [[Arab World]]. As a result of these interactions many Arab people in the [[Middle East]] have black ancestry and many black people on the east coast of Africa and along the Sahara have Arab ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1180338 Extensive Female-Mediated Gene Flow from Sub-Saharan Africa into Near Eastern Arab Populations]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Carlos Moore, resident scholar at Brazil's University of the state of Bahia, Afro-multiracials in the Arab world self-identify in ways that resemble [[Latin America]]. He claims that black-looking Arabs, much like black-looking [[Latin Americans]], consider themselves white because they have some distant white ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Musselman| first = Anson | title = The Subtle Racism of Latin America| publisher = UCLA International Institute| url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=4125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore also claims that a film about [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]] [[Anwar Sadat]] had to be canceled when Sadat discovered that an [[African-American]] had been cast to play him. In fact, the 1983 television movie ''Sadat'', starring [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]], was not canceled. The [[government of Egypt|Egyptian government]] refused to let the drama air in Egypt, partially on the grounds of the casting of Gossett.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Louis_Gossett_Jr/192411 Louis Gosset Jr.] Hollywood.com&lt;/ref&gt; The objections, however, did not come from Sadat, who had been assassinated two years earlier.

Sadat's mother was a black [[Sudan]]ese woman and his father was a lighter-skinned [[Egyptians|Egyptian]]. In response to an advertisement for an acting position he remarked, &quot;I am not white but I am not exactly black either. My blackness is tending to reddish&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=PoW4pO4q9VwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP1,M1 Anwar Sadat: Visionary Who Dared By Joseph Finklestone] pages 5–7,31 ISBN 0-7146-3487-5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fathia Nkrumah]] was another Egyptian with ties to Black Africa. She was the late wife of [[Ghana]]ian revolutionary [[Kwame Nkrumah]], whose marriage was seen as helping plant the seeds of cooperation between Egypt and other African countries as they struggled for independence from European colonization, which in turn helped advance the formation of the [[African Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ausummit-accra.org.gh/index1.php?linkid=289&amp;adate=04%2F07%2F2007&amp;archiveid=140&amp;page=1 African Union Summit]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the patriarchal nature of Arab society, Arab men had more use of black female slaves than black male slaves, more black women were enslaved than men, and, because the [[Qur'an]] was interpreted to permit [[Ma malakat aymanukum and sex|sexual relations between a male master and his female slave]] outside of marriage,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Tahfeem ul Qur'an]] by [[Maududi|Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]], Vol. 2 pp. 112–113 footnote 44; Also see commentary on verses {{Quran-usc-range|23|1|6}}: Vol. 3, notes 7–1, p. 241; 2000, Islamic Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tafsir ibn Kathir]] 4:24&lt;/ref&gt; many [[mixed race]] children resulted. When an enslaved woman became pregnant with her Arab captor's child, she became “umm walad” or “mother of a child”, a status that granted her privileged rights. The child would have prospered from the wealth of the father and been given rights of inheritance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arab Slave Trade&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabslavetrade.com|publisher=&quot;[[Owen 'Alik Shahadah]]&quot;|title=Slavery in Arabia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of [[patrilineality]], the children were born free and sometimes even became successors to their ruling fathers, as was the case with Sultan [[Ahmad al-Mansur]], (whose mother was a [[Fulani]] concubine), who ruled [[Morocco]] from 1578 to 1608. Such tolerance, however, was not extended to wholly black persons, even when technically &quot;free,&quot; and the notion that to be black meant to be a slave became a common belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Hunwick| first = John| title = Arab Views of Black Africans and Slavery| url=http://www.yale.edu/glc/events/race/Hunwick.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;[[Abd (Arabic)|abd]]&quot;, ({{lang-ar

Thousands of mixed-race individuals with non-black Jewish relatives also live in Israel.

===In the Americas===
{{See also|Afro-American peoples of the Americas}}
Approximately 12 million Africans were shipped to [[the Americas]] during the [[Atlantic slave trade]] from 1492 to 1888. Today their descendants number approximately 150 million,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/galci/Archive.htm &quot;Community Outreach&quot; Seminar on Planning Process for SANTIAGO +5 ], ''Global Afro-Latino and Caribbean Initiative'', February 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; most of whom live in the [[United States]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]], including [[Brazil]]. Many have a multiracial background of African, [[Amerindian]], European and Asian ancestry. The various regions developed complex social conventions with which their multi-ethnic populations were classified.

====United States====
{{Main|African American}}
{{See also|African immigration to the United States}}

In the first 200 years that black people had been in the [[United States]], they commonly referred to themselves as Africans. In Africa, people primarily identified themselves by ethnic group (closely allied to language) and not by skin color. Individuals would be [[Ashanti]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] or [[Wolof people|Wolof]]. But when Africans were brought to [[the Americas]] they were forced to give up their ethnic affiliations for fear of uprisings. The result was the Africans had to intermingle with other Africans from different ethnic groups. This is significant as Africans came from a vast geographic region, the [[West Africa]]n coastline stretching from [[Senegal]] to [[Angola]] and in some cases from the south east coast such as [[Mozambique]]. A new identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of European cultural heritage, resulting in fusions such as the [[Black church]] and [[AAVE|Black English]]. This new identity was now based on skin color and African ancestry rather than any one ethnic group.&lt;ref name=Shahadah&gt;{{cite web| last = Shahadah| first = Owen 'Alik| authorlink =Owen 'Alik Shahadah| title =Linguistics for a new African reality| url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/language%20new%20reality.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1807, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], which largely controlled the Atlantic, declared [[Abolition of the Slave Trade Act|the trans-atlantic slave trade illegal]], as did the United States. (The latter prohibition took effect January 1, 1808, the earliest date on which [[United States Congress|Congress]] had the power to do so under [[wikisource:Constitution of the United States of America#Section 9|Article I, Section 9]] of the [[United States Constitution]].)

By that time, the majority of black people were U.S.-born, so use of the term &quot;African&quot; became problematic. Though initially a source of pride, many blacks feared its continued use would be a hindrance to their fight for full citizenship in the US. They also felt that it would give ammunition to those who were advocating repatriating black people back to Africa. In 1835 black leaders called upon black Americans to remove the title of &quot;African&quot; from their institutions and replace it with &quot;[[Negro]]&quot; or &quot;Colored American&quot;. A few institutions however elected to keep their historical names such as [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]]. &quot;Negro&quot; and &quot;colored&quot; remained the popular terms until the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1594200831/ African American Journeys to Africa page63-64]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''black'' was used throughout but not frequently as it carried a certain stigma.
In his 1963 &quot;[[I Have a Dream]]&quot; speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1732754907698549493 | people = Martin Luther King, Jr.| title = I Have a Dream| medium = Google Video| location = Washington, D.C.|date=August 28, 1963 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] uses the terms ''Negro'' 15 times and ''black'' 4 times. Each time he uses ''black'' it is in parallel construction with ''white'' (for example,, black men and white men).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Smith|first= Tom W.|title = Changing Racial Labels: From &quot;Colored&quot; to &quot;Negro&quot; to &quot;Black&quot; to &quot;African American&quot;| journal = The Public Opinion Quarterly| volume = 56| issue=4|pages = 496–514|oclc=192150485| url=http://www.soc.iastate.edu/soc522a/PDF%20readings/Smith.pdf|date = Winter, 1992| publisher = Oxford University Press| doi = 10.1086/269339|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the successes of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights movement]] a new term was needed to break from the past and help shed the reminders of legalized discrimination. In place of ''Negro'', ''black'' was promoted as standing for racial pride, militancy and power. Some of the turning points included the use of the term &quot;[[Black Power]]&quot; by Kwame Toure ([[Stokely Carmichael]]) and the release of James Brown's song &quot;[[Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud]]&quot;.

In 1988 [[Jesse Jackson]] urged Americans to use the term [[African American]] because the term has a historical cultural base. Since then African American and black have essentially a coequal status. There is still much controversy over which term is more appropriate. Some such as [[Maulana Karenga]] and [[Owen Alik Shahadah]] argue African-American is more appropriate because it accurately articulates geography and historical origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahadah&quot;/&gt; Others have argued that &quot;Black&quot; is a better term because &quot;African&quot; suggests foreignness, despite the long presence of Black people in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = McWhorter| first = John H.| title = Why I'm Black, Not African American| work= Los Angeles Times|date=8 September 2004| url = http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/_latimes-why_im_black.htm| accessdate = 26 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others believe the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Surveys show that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for whether &quot;African American&quot; or &quot;Black&quot; is employed to describe them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/28816/black-african-american.aspx|title=Black or African American?|first=Frank|last=Newport|publisher=Gallup|date=28 September 2007|accessdate=26 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they also show that there is a slight preference for &quot;Black&quot; in personal settings and &quot;African American&quot; in more formal settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Miller| first1 = Pepper| last2 = Kemp|first2=Herb | title = What's Black About?

The [[Race (United States Census)|U.S. census race definitions]] says a black is a person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as &quot;Black, African Am., or Negro,&quot; or who provide written entries such as African American, Afro American, [[Kenyan]], [[Nigerian]], or [[Haiti]]an. However, the [[Census Bureau]] notes that these classifications are socio-political constructs and should not be interpreted as scientific or anthropological.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/mso/www/c2000basics/00Basics.pdf 2000 US Census basics]&lt;/ref&gt;

A considerable portion of the [[U.S. population]] identified as ''black'' actually have some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] or [[White people|White]] ancestry. For instance, genetic studies of African American people show an ancestry that is on average 17–18% European.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isteve.com/2002_How_White_Are_Blacks.htm How White Are Blacks?

=====One drop rule=====
Historically, the United States used a [[colloquial]] term, the ''[[one-drop rule]]'', to designate a black person as any person with any known African ancestry.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite web| last = James| first = F. Davis| title = Who is Black? One Nation's Definition| url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/mixed/onedrop.html| publisher = [[PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legally the definition varied from state to state. Thomas Jefferson had slaves who were legally white (less than 25% Black) and legally slaves (mother was a slave). Outside of the US, some other countries have adopted the practice, but the definition of who is black and the extent to which the one drop &quot;rule&quot; applies varies from country to country.

The one drop rule may have originated as a means of increasing the number of black slaves&lt;ref&gt;[[Clarence Page]], [http://www.pbs.org/newshour/essays/page_5-1.html A Credit to His Races], ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'', May 1, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and been maintained as an attempt to keep the white race pure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://backintyme.com/essays/?p=25|title=Presenting the Triumph of the One-Drop Rule|last=Sweet|first=Frank|date=2006-04-01|work=The One-Drop Rule|accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the results of the one drop rule was uniting the African American community and preserving an African identity.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; Some of the most prominent civil rights activists were multiracial, and advocated equality for all.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

To a certain extent, this concept is not so much about race but more about culture and behavior.
Blackness can be contrasted with &quot;[[acting white]]&quot; where black Americans are said to behave with assumed characteristics of stereotypical white Americans, with regard to [[fashion]], [[dialect]], taste in [[music]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kent.edu/Magazine/Spring2007/ActingWhite.cfm|title=Acting White|last=Edler|first=Melissa|date=Spring 2007|work=Kent State Magazine|accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly, from the perspective of a significant number of Black youth, academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Ogbu, J. &quot;Black American students in an affluent suburb: a study of academic disengagement&quot;  Erlbaum Associates Press.

The notion of blackness can also be extended to non-black people. [[Toni Morrison]] once described [[Bill Clinton]] as the first black president,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/books/int/2002/02/20/clinton/index.html|title=Blacks and Bill Clinton|last=Hansen|first=Suzy|date=2002-02-20|work=Salon|accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of his warm relations with African Americans, his poor upbringing and also because he is a jazz musician. [[Christopher Hitchens]] was offended by the notion of Clinton as the first black president noting &quot;we can still define blackness by the following symptoms: alcoholic mothers, under-the-bridge habits...the tendency to sexual predation and shameless perjury about the same&quot;&lt;ref&gt;No One Left to Lie to by Christopher Hitchens, 1999, pg 47&lt;/ref&gt; Some black activists were also offended, claiming Clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people like no other president before&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1637/is_200204/ai_n6880693 | title=Find Articles 404 File not found}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; for political gain, while not serving black interests.

The question of blackness also arose in Democrat [[Barack Obama]]'s [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]]. Commentators have questioned whether Obama, who was elected the first black [[President of the United States]], is black enough, as his mother was [[white American]], and his father was a black Kenyan immigrant.&lt;ref name=obama-speech/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama-time/&gt; Obama refers to himself interchangeably as black and [[African American]].&lt;ref name=Kroft&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/11/60minutes/main2458530.shtml|title=A Transcript Excerpt Of Steve Kroft’s Interview With Sen.

{{Main|Race in Brazil}}
[[File:Filhas-de-santo moradoras do terreiro.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|Afro-Brazilian women during a [[Candomblé]] ceremony.]]
The topic of race in Brazil is a complex and diverse one.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both parents, nor were there only two categories to choose from. Between a pure black and a very light mulatto over a dozen racial categories would be recognized in conformity with the combinations of hair color, hair texture, eye color, and skin color. These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum, and no one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. That is, race referred to appearance, not heredity.&lt;ref name=&quot;skidmore&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| first = Thomas E. | last = Skidmore | title = Fact and Myth: Discovering a Racial Problem in Brazil| journal = Working Paper| volume = 173|url=http://www.nd.edu/~kellogg/publications/workingpapers/WPS/173.pdf| month = April | year = 1992|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some disagreement among scholars over the effects of social status on racial classifications in Brazil. It is generally believed that upward mobility and education results in reclassification of individuals into lighter skinned categories. The popular claim is that in Brazil poor whites are considered black and wealthy blacks are considered white. Some scholars disagree arguing that whitening of one's social status may be open to people of mixed race, but a typically black person will consistently be identified as black regardless of wealth or social status.&lt;ref name=Telles&gt;{{cite book| last = Edward E. | first = Telles| title = Race in Another America: The Significance of Skin Color in Brazil| pages = 95–98| publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| year=  2004| isbn =0691118663 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first = Edward E. | last = Telles| title = Racial Ambiguity Among the Brazilian Population| journal = Ethnic and Racial Studies|url=http://www.ccpr.ucla.edu/ccprwpseries/ccpr_012_01.pdf| volume = 25| pages = 415–441| date=  3 May 2002| publisher = California Center for Population Research| doi = 10.1080/01419870252932133|format=PDF| issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the year 1500 to 1850 an estimated 3.5 million Africans were forcibly shipped to Brazil.&lt;ref name=Telles/&gt; An estimated 80 million Brazilians, almost half the population, are at least in part descendants of these Africans. Brazil has the largest population of Afro-descendants outside of Africa. In contrast to the US there were no segregation or anti-[[miscegenation]] laws in Brazil and as a result intermarriage has affected a large majority of the Brazilian population. Even much of the white population has either African or Amerindian blood. According to the last census 54% identified themselves as white, 6.2% identified themselves as black and 39.5% identified themselves as [[Pardo]] (brown)- a broad multiracial category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = CIA World Factbook: Brazil| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html}}{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A philosophy of [[Racial whitening|whitening]] emerged in Brazil in the 19th century. Until recently the government did not keep data on race. However, statisticians estimate that in 1835 half the population was black, one fifth was Pardo (brown) and one fourth white. By 2000 the black population had fallen to only 6.2% and the Pardo had increased to 40% and white to 55%. Essentially most of the black population was absorbed into the multiracial category by intermarriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;skidmore&quot;/&gt; A recent study found that at least 29% of the middle class white Brazilian population had some recent African ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funpecrp.com.br/gmr/year2007/vol2-6/gmr0330_full_text.htm Sex-biased gene flow in African Americans but not in American Caucasians]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Race relations in Brazil=====
Because of the ideology of [[miscegenation]], Brazil has avoided the polarization of society into black and white. The bitter and sometimes violent racial tensions that divide the US are notably absent in Brazil.
However the philosophy of the racial democracy in Brazil has drawn criticism from some quarters. Brazil has one of the largest gaps in income distribution in the world. The richest 10% of the population earn 28 times the average income of the bottom 40%. The richest 10 percent is almost exclusively white. One-third of the population lives under the poverty line, with blacks and other non-whites accounting for 70 percent of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Barrolle| first = Melvin Kadiri| title = African 'Americans' in Brazil| publisher =New America Media| url=http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=5b8d531de860940110af2433244782c6| accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, black people earn 75% of what white people earn.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In Brazil, non-whites earn less than 50% of what whites earn. Some have posited that Brazil does in fact practice the [[one drop rule]] when social economic factors are considered. This is because the gap in income between blacks and other non-whites is relatively small compared to the large gap between whites and non-whites. Other factors such as illiteracy and education level show the same patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Roland| first = Edna Maria Santos| title = The Economics of Racism: People of African Descent in Brazil| url=http://www.falapreta.org.br/durban/racism.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike in the US where African Americans were united in the civil rights struggle, in Brazil the philosophy of whitening has helped divide blacks from other non-whites and prevented a more active civil rights movement.

Though Afro-Brazilians make up half the population there are very few black politicians. The city of [[Salvador, Bahia]] for instance is 80% Afro-Brazilian but has never had a black mayor. Critics indicate that US cities that have a black majority, such as [[Detroit]] and [[New Orleans]], have never had white mayors since first electing black mayors in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Whitaker, &quot;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_n4_v46/ai_9329550/pg_3 Blacks in Brazil: The Myth and the Reality],&quot; ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'', February 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-white people also have limited media visibility. The Latin American media, in particular the Brazilian media, has been accused of hiding its black and indigenous population. For example the [[telenovelas]] or [[Soap Opera|soaps]] are said to be a hotbed of white, largely blonde and blue/green-eyed actors who resemble [[Scandinavia]]ns or other northern Europeans more than they resemble the typical whites of Brazil, who are mostly of [[Southern European]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3069253/site/newsweek/%5B/url%5D Soap operas on Latin TV are lily white]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A19009-2000Aug1&amp;notFound=true The Blond, Blue-Eyed Face of Spanish TV]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/08/19/pride_or_prejudice/ Skin tone consciousness in Asian and Latin American populations]&lt;/ref&gt;

These patterns of discrimination against non-whites have led some to advocate for the use of the Portuguese term 'negro' to encompass non-whites so as to renew a black consciousness and identity, in effect an African descent rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newamerica.net/publications/articles/2006/brazil_separates_into_a_world_of_black_and_white Brazil Separates Into a World of Black and White], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August, 2008, ''The Migration Information Source'' article noted that &quot;A Nigerian Embassy spokesman estimated that Nigerians possibly make up the largest group of Africans in China, with about 2,000 to 3,000 Nigerians in Guangdong in 2006.

====India and Southeast Asia====
{{See also|Indo-African (disambiguation)}}
The [[Great Andamanese]] are one of five [[Afro Asians (African Asians)|Afro Asian]] ethnic groups ([[Adivasi]] or tribal) native to the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]; they are among the first inhabitants of what is now India, arriving over 70,000 years ago. They are facing extinction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4314267.stm Extinction threat for Andaman natives]. ''BBC News.'' March 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The other four ethnic groups are the [[Jangil]], [[Jarawa (Andaman Islands)|Jarawa]], [[Onge people|Onge]] and [[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]]. By their external physical appearance ([[phenotype]]) such people resemble Black Africans with dark skin and sometimes tightly coiled hair. There have been suggestions of a Black African origin. However, in the case of the Andamanese people, a study conducted by the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] indicated that the Andamanese people possessed closer affinities with the Southeast Asian population than with the Black African population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first = Kumarasamy | last = Thangaraj| title = Genetic Affinities of the Andaman Islanders, a Vanishing Human Population|url=http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/CB_2002_p1-18.pdf| journal =Current Biology | volume = 13| issue=2| pages = 86–93| date= 2003-01-21| doi = 10.1080/00438240600564987|oclc=112009350|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-08-05| pmid = 12546781| last2 = Singh| first2 = L| last3 = Reddy| first3 = AG| last4 = Rao| first4 = VR| last5 = Sehgal| first5 = SC| last6 = Underhill| first6 = PA| last7 = Pierson| first7 = M| last8 = Frame| first8 = IG| last9 = Hagelberg| first9 = E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[South India]] there are also several communities of Black African descent, such as the [[Vedda people]] of [[Sri Lanka]], the [[Sheedi|Sheedis/Siddis]], specifically the [[Siddis of Karnataka]], who descend from [[East Africa]]n slaves. Other ethnic groups in India with dark skin and/or broad facial features are the [[Bonda people|Bonda]], [[Gondi people|Gondi]], [[Bhil]], [[Kondha|Dongria Kondha]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survivalinternational.org/tribes/dongria Dongria Kondha Survival International]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cochin Jews|Black Jews of Kerala]], whose origins in India date back two if not three thousand years, appear identical to the surrounding [[Tamil people|Tamil]] population. For centuries they faced racism from the neighboring community of White Jews, who excluded them from the [[Paradesi Synagogue]]. This [[apartheid]]-like situation improved only in the twentieth century with the rise of the &quot;Jewish [[Gandhi]]&quot;, a local lawyer named [[Abraham Barak Salem]]. Most of the Cochin Jews migrated to [[Israel]], where their race makes them stand out and in some cases draws racist comments.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last Jews of Kerala'', Edna Fernandes, Portobello Books 2008. Especially the chapters &quot;Son of Salem&quot; and &quot;Segregation in the Synagogue&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other black people of Southeast Asia, collectively known as [[Negritos]], include the  the [[Aeta]] people of [[Luzon]] and the [[Ati (tribe)|Ati]] of [[Panay]] in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name=andaman&gt;[http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/chapter6/text6.htm Chapter 6: The Negrito Race]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The Dravidian Debate=====
There is ongoing debate as to whether the [[Dravidian people]] of [[India]] are African descendants or not. Most Indian scholars do not consider the Dravidians African. The Dravidians though, are considered African by Indian Studies scholars like [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] and [[Runoko Rashidi]].Rajshekar further corroborates this theory by referencing that because India and Africa used to be a single land mass prior to continental drift ([[Pangea]]), subsequently, the original peoples of Africa and India are the same people.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

There are several groups of dark-skinned people who live in various parts of [[Asia]], [[Australia]] and [[Oceania]] who sometimes are referred to as black people. They include the [[Indigenous Australians]], the [[Melanesians]] (now divided into [[Austronesian]]-speaking populations and [[Papuan]]s, and including the great genetic diversity of [[New Guinea]]), the [[Semang]] people of the [[Malay peninsula]], and indigenous first nation [[Fijians]].

According to the [[Office for National Statistics]], as of the 2001 census, there are over a million black people in the [[United Kingdom]]; 1% of the total population describe themselves as &quot;Black Caribbean&quot;, 0.8% as &quot;Black African&quot;, and 0.2% as &quot;Black other&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=273 National Statistics Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Britain encouraged the immigration of workers from the [[Caribbean]] after [[World War II]]; the first symbolic movement was those who came on the ship the ''[[Empire Windrush]]''. The preferred official [[umbrella term]] is &quot;black and minority ethnic&quot; (BME), but sometimes the term &quot;black&quot; is used on its own, to express unified opposition to racism, as in the [[Southall Black Sisters]], which started with a mainly [[British Asian]] constituency.

A cultural classification of people as &quot;black&quot; exists in [[Russia]]. Certain groups of people who are ethnically different, and generally darker, than ethnic [[Russians]] are pejoratively referred to as &quot;blacks&quot; (''chernye''), and face specific sorts of [[social exclusion]] (see [[Racism in Russia]]). [[Romani people|Roma]], [[Georgians]], and [[Tatar]]s fall into this category.&lt;ref&gt;''The Unmaking of Soviet Life: Everyday Economies After Socialism'' By Caroline Humphrey [[Cornell University]] 2002 p36–37&lt;/ref&gt; Those referred to as &quot;black&quot; are from the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet republics]], predominantly [[peoples of the Caucasus]], for example, [[Chechens]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Taylor, [http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/63/333.html Emergency—Explosion of State and Popular Racism follows Moscow Blasts], International Solidarity with Workers in Russia (ISWoR), 13 September 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Although &quot;Caucasian&quot; is used in [[American English]] to mean &quot;[[white people]]&quot;, in [[Russian language|Russian]] – and [[List of dialects of the English language|most other varieties of English]] – it only refers to the [[Caucasus]], not European people in general.

==Debates on race==
===Hamitic race===
{{further|[[Hamitic]]|[[Habesha people|Habesha]]}}
According to some historians, the tale in [[Curse of Ham|Genesis 9]] in which Noah cursed the descendants of his son Ham with servitude was a seminal moment in defining black people, as the story was passed on through generations of Jewish, Christian and Islamic scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, Race and Slavery in the Middle East: An Historical Enquiry, (Oxford University Press, 1982), pp. 28–117&lt;/ref&gt; According to columnist Felicia R. Lee, &quot;Ham came to be widely portrayed as black; blackness, servitude and the idea of racial hierarchy became inextricably linked.&quot; Some people believe that the tradition of dividing humankind into three major races is partly rooted in tales of Noah's three sons repopulating the Earth after the [[Noah's Flood|Deluge]] and giving rise to three separate races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Descendants of Noah| url=http://www.bible-truth.org/GEN10.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biblical passage, [[Book of Genesis]] 9:20–27, which deals with the [[sons of Noah]], however, makes no reference to race. The reputed [[curse of Ham]] is not on [[Sons of Noah|Ham]], but on [[Canaan]], one of Ham's sons. This is not a racial but geographic referent. The Canaanites, typically associated with the region of the Levant (Palestine, Lebanon, and so on.) were later subjugated by the Hebrews when they left bondage in Egypt according to the Biblical narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Redford| first = Donald B. | title = Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times| pages = 23–87| publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| year= 1993| isbn = 0691000867 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldenberg&gt;{{cite book| last = Goldenberg| first = David M.| title = The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity, and Islam| publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| date = New Ed edition (July 18, 2005)| isbn = 0691123705 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged inferiority of Hamitic descendants also is not supported by the Biblical narrative, nor claims of three races in relation to Noah's sons. Shem for example seems a linguistic not racial referent. In short the Bible does not define black people, nor assign them to racial hierarchies.&lt;ref name=Goldenberg/&gt;

Historians believe that by the 19th century, the belief that black people were descended from Ham was used by southern United States whites to justify slavery.&lt;ref name=FRLee&gt;Felicia R. Lee, ''[http://www.racematters.org/noahscurseslaverysrationale.htm Noah's Curse Is Slavery's Rationale]'', Racematters.org, November 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; According to Benjamin Braude, a professor of history at Boston College:

{{quote|in 18th- and 19th century Euro-America, Genesis 9:18–27 became the curse of Ham, a foundation myth for collective degradation, conventionally trotted out as God's reason for condemning generations of dark-skinned peoples from Africa to slavery.&lt;ref name=FRLee/&gt;}}

Author David M. Goldenberg contends that the Bible is not a racist document. According to Goldenberg, such [[racist]] interpretations came from post-biblical writers of antiquity like [[Philo]] and [[Origen of Alexandria]], who equated blackness with darkness of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Goldenberg, D. M. (2005) ''The Curse of Ham: Race &amp; Slavery in Early Judaism, Christian'', Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversy over the skin color and ethnic origins of the [[ancient Egypt]]ians was sparked as part of the [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] debate.&lt;ref name = &quot;hrsvxs&quot;&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/afrocent_roth.html Building bridges to Afrocentrism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentrist]] scholars such as [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] contend that [[ancient Egypt]] was primarily a &quot;black civilization&quot;. One source cited in support of their argument is [[Herodotus]], who wrote around 450 B.C. that &quot;Colchians, Ethiopians and Egyptians have thick lips, broad nose, woolly hair and they are burnt of skin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Huge Ancient Egyptian Photo Gallery| url=http://www.freemaninstitute.com/RTGhistory.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Classical scholar [[Frank M. Snowden, Jr.|Frank Snowden, Jr.]] cautions against the reliance on accounts by ancient writers to describe the physical characteristics of other ancient peoples, as they held different connotations from those of modern-day terminology in the West. He also points out that other ancient writers clearly distinguished between Egyptians and Ethiopians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Snowden, Jr. | first=Frank M. | editor=Mary R. Lefkowitz and Guy MacLean Rogers (eds.) | title=Black Athena Revisited | location=Chapel Hill | publisher=University of North Carolina Press | year=1996 | pages=113–14 | quote=....the Afrocentrists are mistaken in assuming that the terms ''Afri'' (Africans) and various color adjectives for dark pigmentation as used by Greeks and Romans are always the classical equivalents of Negores or blacks in modern usage.... That the pigmentation of the Egyptians was seen as lighter than that of Ethiopians is also attested by the adjective ''subfusucli'' (&quot;somewhat dark&quot;) which Ammianus Marcellinus (22.16.23) chose to describe the Egyptians....}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keita and Boyce confront this issue in a 1996 article entitled, &quot;The Geographical Origins and Population Relationships of Early Ancient Egyptians&quot;. As anthropologists, they point out the danger in relying on ancient interpretation to reveal for us the biological make up of a population. In any case they contend, the relevant data indicates greater similarity between Egyptians and Ethiopians than the former group with the Ancient Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Keita, Boyce | first=Shomarka, A.J.| editor=Theodore Celenko(ed) | title=Egypt in Africa | location=Chapel Hill | publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art | year=1996 | pages=25–27 | quote=....''The descriptions and terms of ancient Greek writers have sometimes been used to comment on Egyptian origins. This is problematic since the ancient writers were not doing population biology. However, we can examine one issue. The Greeks called all groups south of Egypt &quot;Ethiopians.&quot; Were the Egyptians more related to any of these &quot;Ethiopians&quot; than to the Greeks? As noted, cranial and limb studies have indicated greater similarity to Somalis, Kushites and Nubians, all &quot;Ethiopians&quot; in ancient Greek terms.''....}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Egyptians are often portrayed in modern media as Caucasians, and many people, Afrocentrists in particular, have been critical of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Identity Of Ancient| url=http://www.calumet.purdue.edu/mcnair/cynthia_research.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Egyptology|Egyptologists]], ancient Egypt was a multicultural society of Middle Eastern, Northeast African, and Saharan influences.&lt;ref name = &quot;hrsvxs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://homelink.cps-k12.org/teachers/filiopa/files/AC383EB269C648AAAA659593B9FC358C.pdf Were the Ancient Egyptians black or white]&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropological and archaeological evidence shows that an [[Africoid]] element was evident in ancient Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| people = [[Basil Davidson]]| title=The Nile|url=http://www.lincoln.edu/history/his307/davidson/1/dif3.wmv}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was predominant in [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] in the [[First dynasty of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Studies and Comments on Ancient Egyptian Biological Relationships, by S.O.Y.

The general trend from Badari to Nakada times, and then from the Nakadan to the First Dynasty epochs demonstrate change toward the northern-Egyptian centroid value on Function I with similar values on Function 11. This might represent an average change from an Africoid (Keita, 1990) to a northern-Egyptian-Maghreb modal pattern.... This northern modal pattern, which can be called coastal northern African, is noted in general terms to be intermediate, by the centroid scores of Function I, to equatorial African and northern European phenotypes. | doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330870302 | pmid=1562056}}{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primarily carried by rodents (most notably [[rats]]) and spread to humans via fleas, the disease is notorious throughout history, due to the unrivaled scale of death and devastation it brought. Until June 2007, plague was one of only three diseases specifically reportable to the World Health Organization (the two other ones were cholera and yellow fever).&lt;ref&gt;[WHO IHR Brief No. 2. Notification and other reporting requirements under the IHR (2005). http://www.who.int/ihr/ihr_brief_no_2_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on lung infection, or sanitary conditions, plague also can be spread in the air, by direct contact, or by contaminated undercooked food or materials. The symptoms of plague depend on the concentrated areas of infection in each person: such as [[bubonic plague]] in lymph nodes, [[septicemic plague]] in blood vessels, [[pneumonic plague]] in lungs, and so on. Medicines can cure plague if detected early. Plague is still [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in some parts of the world.

==Name==
The epidemiological use of the term ''&quot;plague&quot;'' is currently applied to bacterial infections that cause ''[[bubo]]es'', although historically the medical use of the term &quot;plague&quot; has been applied to [[pandemic]] infections in general. Plague is often synonymous with &quot;[[bubonic plague]]&quot; but this only describes one of its manifestations. Other names have been used to describe this disease, such as &quot;The Black Plague&quot; and &quot;The Black Death&quot;; the latter is now used primarily to describe the second, and most devastating, pandemic of the disease.

The [[etymology]] of the word ''&quot;plague&quot;'' is believed to come from the Latin word ''plāga'' (&quot;blow, wound&quot;) and ''plangere'' (“to strike, or to strike down”).

==Epidemiology and Distribution of Plague==
===Infection and transmission===

Transmission of ''Y. pestis'' to an uninfected individual is possible by any of the following means.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM&quot;&gt;''Plague Manual: Epidemiology, Distribution, Surveillance and Control'', p. 9 &amp; 11. WHO/CDS/CSR/EDC/99.2&lt;/ref&gt;

* droplet contact - coughing or sneezing on another person
* direct physical contact - touching an infected person, including sexual contact
* indirect contact - usually by touching [[soil contamination]] or a contaminated surface
* airborne transmission - if the microorganism can remain in the air for long periods
* fecal-oral transmission - usually from contaminated food or water sources
* vector borne transmission - carried by insects or other animals.

''Yersinia pestis'' circulates in animal reservoirs, particularly in rodents, in the natural foci of infection found on all continents except Australia. The natural foci of plague are situated in a broad belt in the tropical and sub–tropical latitudes and the warmer parts of the temperate latitudes around the globe, between the parallels 55 degrees North and 40 degrees South.&lt;ref name=PM/&gt;
&lt;!--IMAGE--&gt;[[File:Scanning Electron Micrograph of a Flea.jpg|thumb|right|Flea ''[[Xenopsylla cheopis]]'', primary vector to spread [[Bubonic plague]].]]

Contrary to popular belief, rats did not directly start the spread of the Bubonic plague. It is mainly a disease in the [[flea]]s (''[[Xenopsylla cheopis]]'') that infested the rats, making the rats themselves the first victims of the plague. Infection in a human occurs when a person is bitten by a flea that has been infected by biting a rodent that itself has been infected by the bite of a flea carrying the disease. The bacteria multiply inside the flea, sticking together to form a plug that blocks its stomach and causes it to starve. The flea then bites a host and continues to feed, even though it cannot quell its hunger, and consequently the flea vomits blood tainted with the bacteria back into the bite wound. The bubonic plague bacterium then infects a new victim, and the flea eventually dies from starvation. Serious outbreaks of plague are usually started by other disease outbreaks in rodents, or a rise in the rodent population.

In 1894, two bacteriologists, [[Alexandre Emile John Yersin|Alexandre Yersin]] of [[France]] and [[Kitasato Shibasaburō]] of [[Japan]], independently isolated the bacterium in [[Hong Kong]] responsible for the [[Third Pandemic]]. Though both investigators reported their findings, a series of confusing and contradictory statements by Kitasato eventually led to the acceptance of Yersin as the primary discoverer of the organism. Yersin named it '''''Pasteurella pestis''''' in honor of the [[Pasteur Institute]], where he worked, but in 1967 it was moved to a new genus, renamed '''''[[Yersinia pestis]]''''' in honor of Yersin. Yersin also noted that rats were affected by plague not only during plague epidemics but also often preceding such epidemics in humans, and that plague was regarded by many locals as a disease of rats: villagers in [[China]] and [[India]] asserted that, when large numbers of rats were found dead, plague outbreaks soon followed.

In 1898, the French scientist [[Paul-Louis Simond]] (who had also come to [[China]] to battle the [[Third Pandemic]]) established the rat-flea [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] that drives the disease. He had noted that persons who became ill did not have to be in close contact with each other to acquire the disease. In [[Yunnan, China]], inhabitants would flee from their homes as soon as they saw dead rats, and on the island of [[Formosa]] ([[Taiwan]]), residents considered the handling of dead rats heightened the risks of developing plague. These observations led him to suspect that the flea might be an intermediary factor in the transmission of plague, since people acquired plague only if they were in contact with recently dead rats, who had died less than 24 hours before. In a now classic experiment, Simond demonstrated how a healthy rat died of plague, after infected fleas had jumped to it, from a rat which had recently died of the plague.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asnom.org/en/423_peste.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plague immunization==
Currently there is no vaccine against the Plague. This absence of a vaccine is not necessarily important because today there are very few cases of the plague and to go along with that there are very few deaths. Treatments for the plague are extremely successful and nearly all individuals who are treated do make a full recovery.

==Pathology==
===Bubonic plague===
{{Main|Bubonic plague}}

[[File:Plague -buboes.jpg|thumb|Buboes on the thigh of a person suffering from [[Bubonic plague]] ]]

When a flea bites a human and contaminates the wound with regurgitated blood, the plague carrying bacteria are passed into the tissue. ''Y. pestis'' can reproduce inside cells, so even if [[phagocytosis|phagocytosed]], they can still survive. Once in the body, the bacteria can enter the [[lymphatic system]], which drains [[interstitial fluid]]. Plague bacteria secrete several [[toxin]]s, one of which is known to cause dangerous [[beta blocker|beta-adrenergic blockade]].

''Y. pestis'' spreads through the lymphatics of the infected human until it reaches a [[lymph node]], where it stimulates severe [[bleeding|haemorrhagic]] [[inflammation]] that causes the lymph nodes to expand. The expansion of lymph nodes is the cause of the characteristic &quot;bubo&quot; associated with the disease.

===Septicemic plague===
{{Main|Septicemic plague}}
Lymphatics ultimately drain into the bloodstream, so the plague bacteria may enter the blood and travel to almost any part of the body. In [[septicemia|septicemic]] plague, bacterial endotoxins cause [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC), causing tiny clots throughout the body and possibly ischaemic necrosis (tissue death due to lack of circulation/perfusion to that tissue) from the clots. DIC results in depletion of the body's clotting resources, so that it can no longer control bleeding. Consequently, there is bleeding into the skin and other organs, which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and hemoptysis/hematemesis (coughing up/ vomiting of blood). There are bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites; these are usually red, and sometimes white in the center. Untreated, septicemic plague is usually fatal. Early treatment with [[antibiotics]] reduces the mortality rate to between 4 and 15 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wagle1948&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Wagle PM| title=Recent advances in the treatment of bubonic plague| journal=Indian J Med Sci| year=1948| volume=2| pages=489&amp;ndash;94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer1950&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Meyer KF| title=Modern therapy of plague| year=1950| journal=J Am Med Assoc| volume=144| pages=982&amp;ndash;985| pmid=14774219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DattGupta1948&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Datt Gupta AK| title=A short note on plague cases treated at Campbell Hospital| journal=Ind Med Gaz| year=1948| volume=83| pages=150&amp;ndash;151}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who die from this form of plague often die on the same day symptoms first appear.

===Pneumonic plague ===
{{Main|Pneumonic plague}}
The [[pneumonia|pneumonic]] plague infects the [[lung]]s, and with that infection comes the possibility of person-to-person transmission through respiratory droplets. The incubation period for pneumonic plague is usually between two and four days, but can be as little as a few hours. The initial symptoms of headache, weakness, and coughing with blood (hemoptysis), or vomiting blood (hematemesis), are indistinguishable from several other respiratory illnesses. Without diagnosis and treatment, the infection can be fatal in one to six days; mortality in untreated cases is approximately 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Ryan |editor-first=K.

===Pharyngeal plague ===
This is an uncommon form of plague that resembles [[tonsillitis]] found in cases of close contact of patients with other forms of plague.&lt;ref&gt;

===Meningeal plague ===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===Other clinical forms===

There are a few other rare manifestations of plague, including asymptomatic plague and abortive plague. ''Cellulocutaneous plague'' sometimes results in infection of the skin and soft tissue, often around the bite site of a flea.

==Treatments==
[[Waldemar Haffkine]], a doctor of Russian-Jewish origin who worked in Mumbai, India, was the first to invent and test a [[plague vaccine]] against [[bubonic plague]],&lt;ref&gt;Haffkine, W. M. 1897. Remarks on the plague prophylactic fluid. Br. Med. J. 1:1461&lt;/ref&gt; on January 10, 1897.

The traditional treatments are:
*[[Streptomycin]] 30&amp;nbsp;mg/kg [[intramuscular|IM]] twice daily for 7 days
*[[Chloramphenicol]] 25&amp;ndash;30&amp;nbsp;mg/kg single dose, followed by 12.5&amp;ndash;15&amp;nbsp;mg/kg four times daily
*[[Tetracycline]] 2 g single dose, followed by 500&amp;nbsp;mg four times daily for 7&amp;ndash;10 days (not suitable for children)

More recently,
*[[Gentamicin]] 2.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg [[intravenous|IV]] or [[intramuscular|IM]] twice daily for 7 days
*[[Doxycycline]] 100&amp;nbsp;mg (adults) or 2.2&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (children) orally twice daily have also been shown to be effective.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mwengee2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Mwengee W| title=Treatment of Plague with Genamicin or Doxycycline in a Randomized Clinical Trial in Tanzania| year=2006| journal=Clin Infect Dis| volume=42| pmid=16447105| issue=5| pages=614&amp;ndash;621| doi=10.1086/500137| last2=Butler| first2=Thomas| last3=Mgema| first3=Samuel| last4=Mhina| first4=George| last5=Almasi| first5=Yusuf| last6=Bradley| first6=Charles| last7=Formanik| first7=James B.| last8=Rochester| first8=C.

The beak is a primitive [[gas mask]] worn by physicians, stuffed with substances (such as [[spices]] and [[herbs]]) thought to ward off the plague.]]

The earliest account describing a possible plague [[epidemic]] is found in I Samuel 5:6 of the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]). In this account, the [[Philistines]] of [[Ashdod]] were stricken with a plague for the crime of stealing the [[Ark of the Covenant]] from the Children of Israel. These events have been dated to approximately the second half of the 11th century BC.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The word &quot;[[tumor]]s&quot; is used in most [[English translations of the Bible|English translations]] to describe the sores that came upon the Philistines. The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], however, can be interpreted as &quot;swelling in the secret parts&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The account indicates that the Philistine city and its political territory were stricken with a &quot;ravaging of mice&quot; and a plague, bringing death to a large segment of the population.

In the second year of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (430 BC), [[Thucydides]] described an epidemic disease which was said to have begun in [[Ethiopia]], passed through [[Egypt]] and [[Libya]], then come to the Greek world. In the [[Plague of Athens]], the city lost possibly one third of its population, including [[Pericles]]. Modern historians disagree on whether the plague was a critical factor in the loss of the war. Although this epidemic has long been considered an outbreak of plague, many modern scholars believe that [[typhus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umm.edu/news/releases/athens.html Plague of Athens&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[smallpox]], or [[measles]] may better fit the surviving descriptions. A recent study of DNA found in the dental pulp of plague victims suggests that [[typhoid]] was actually responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Papagrigorakis |first1=Manolis J. |last2=Yapijakis |first2=Christos |last3=Synodinos |first3=Philippos N. |last4=Baziotopoulou-Valavani |first4=Effie |year=2006 |title=DNA examination of ancient dental pulp incriminates typhoid fever as a probable cause of the Plague of Athens |journal=International Journal of Infectious Diseases |publisher= |volume=10 |issue= 3|pages=206–214 |url= |doi=10.1016/j.ijid.2005.09.001 |pmid=16412683 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first century AD, [[Rufus of Ephesus]], a Greek anatomist, refers to an outbreak of plague in [[Libya]], [[Egypt]], and [[Syria]]. He records that Alexandrian doctors named Dioscorides and Posidonius described symptoms including acute fever, pain, agitation, and delirium. Buboes&amp;mdash;large, hard, and non-suppurating&amp;mdash;developed behind the knees, around the elbows, and &quot;in the usual places.&quot; The death toll of those infected was very high. Rufus also wrote that similar buboes were reported by a Dionysius Curtus, who may have practiced medicine in [[Alexandria]] in the third century BC. If this is correct, the eastern [[Mediterranean]] world may have been familiar with bubonic plague at that early date.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, W.J.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, A.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Pandemic: Plague of Justinian===
{{main|Plague of Justinian}}

The [[Plague of Justinian]] in AD 541&amp;ndash;542 is the first known attack on record, and marks the first firmly recorded pattern of bubonic plague. This disease is thought to have originated in China.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; It then spread to Africa from where the huge city of [[Constantinople]] imported massive amounts of grain, mostly from Egypt, to feed its citizens. The grain ships were the source of contagion for the city, with massive public granaries nurturing the rat and flea population. At its peak the plague was killing 10,000 people in Constantinople every day and ultimately destroyed perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants. It went on to destroy up to a quarter of the human population of the eastern Mediterranean.

In AD 588 a second major wave of plague spread through the Mediterranean into what is now France. It is estimated that the [[Plague of Justinian]] killed as many as 100 million people across the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dpalm.med.uth.tmc.edu/courses/BT2003/BTstudents2003_files%5CPlague2003.htm The History of the Bubonic Plague]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/1996/plague.htm Scientists Identify Genes Critical to Transmission of Bubonic Plague]&lt;/ref&gt; It caused [[Medieval demography|Europe's population]] to drop by around 50% between 541 and 700.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/EPI/bioter/anempiresepidemic.html An Empire's Epidemic]&lt;/ref&gt; It also may have contributed to the success of the [[Arab conquests]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justiniansflea.com/events.htm Justinian's Flea]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/04/arts/idbriefs5H.php The Great Arab Conquests]&lt;/ref&gt; An outbreak of it in the AD 560s was described in AD 790 as causing &quot;swellings in the glands...in the manner of a nut or date&quot; in the groin &quot;and in other rather delicate places followed by an unbearable fever&quot;. While the swellings in this description have been identified by some as buboes, there is some contention as to whether the pandemic should be attributed to the bubonic plague, ''Yersinia pestis'', known in modern times.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;

===Second Pandemic: Black Death===
{{main|Black Death}}
[[File:Bubonic plague map.PNG|thumb|Map showing the spread of bubonic plague in [[Europe]]]]From 1347 to 1351, the [[Black Death]], a massive and deadly [[pandemic]] originating in China, spread along the [[Silk Road]] and swept through Asia, Europe and Africa.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/health/01plague.html?_r=1&amp;hp | title = Europe’s Plagues Came From China, Study Finds | last = Wade | first = Nicholas |date = October 31, 2010 | work = New York Times | accessdate = November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may have reduced the world's population from 450 million to between 350 and 375 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldhis.html Historical Estimates of World Population], U.S. Census Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]] lost around half of its population, from around 123 million to around 65 million; [[Europe]] around 1/3 of its population, from about 75 million to about 50 million; and [[Africa]] approximately 1/8 of its population, from around 80 million to 70 million (mortality rates tended to be correlated with population density so Africa, being less dense overall, had the lowest death rate). This makes the Black Death the largest death toll from any known non-viral epidemic. Although accurate statistical data does not exist, it is thought that 1.4 million died in England (1/3 of England's 4.2 million people), while an even higher percentage of Italy's population was likely wiped out. On the other hand, Northeastern Germany, Bohemia, Poland and Hungary are believed to have suffered less, and there are no estimates available for Russia or the Balkans. It is conceivable that Russia may not have been as affected due to its very cold climate and large size, hence often less close contact with the contagion.

The Black Death somewhat contributed to the destruction of the feudal system in the Middle Ages, and many of the upper classes were forced to give higher wages and more freedom to their workers willing to work on the nobles' lands because of the high death toll. The Black Death also killed many great kings and nobles, leaving issues with inheritance of land and money left to their families.
In its aftermath, the Black Death may also have favoured the use of more advanced farming tools as a smaller workforce was available and plots grew larger as a result of the population loss.

The plague continued to strike parts of [[Europe]] sporadically until the 17th century, each time with reduced intensity and fatality, suggesting an increased resistance due to [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; Some have also argued that changes in hygiene habits and efforts to improve public health and sanitation had a significant impact on the falling rates of infection.{{Who|date=December 2008}}

====Nature of the disease====
In the early 20th century, following the identification by Yersin and Kitasato of the plague bacterium that caused the late 19th and early 20th century Asian bubonic plague (the [[Third Pandemic]]), most scientists and historians came to believe that the Black Death was an incidence of this plague, with a strong presence of the more contagious pneumonic and septicemic varieties increasing the pace of infection, spreading the disease deep into inland areas of the continents. It was claimed that the disease was spread mainly by [[black rat]]s in Asia and that therefore there must have been black rats in north-west Europe at the time of the Black Death to spread it, although black rats are currently rare except near the [[Mediterranean]]. This led to the development of a theory that [[brown rat]]s had invaded Europe, largely wiping out black rats, bringing the plagues to an end, although there is no evidence for the theory in historical records. Some historians suggest that [[marmot]]s, rather than [[rat]]s, were the primary carriers of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/articles/10949.html The Shifting Explanations for the Black Death, the Most Devastating Plague in Human History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The view that the Black Death was caused by ''Yersinia pestis'' has been incorporated into medical textbooks throughout the 20th century and has become part of popular culture, as illustrated by recent books, such as John Kelly's ''The Great Mortality''. Many modern researchers have argued that the disease was more likely to have been viral (that is, not bubonic plague), pointing to the absence of rats from some parts of Europe that were badly affected and to the conviction of people at the time that the disease was spread by direct human contact. According to the accounts of the time the black death was extremely virulent, unlike the 19th and early 20th century bubonic plague. Samuel K. Cohn has made a comprehensive attempt to rebut the bubonic plague theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cohn | first = Samuel K. | title = The Black Death Transformed: Disease and Culture in Early Renaissance Europe | publisher = A Hodder Arnold |year=2003 | pages = 336 | isbn= 0-340-70646-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Encyclopedia of Population, he points to five major weaknesses in this theory:
*very different transmission speeds — the Black Death was reported to have spread 385&amp;nbsp;km in 91 days (4.23&amp;nbsp;km/day) in 664, compared to 12–15&amp;nbsp;km a year for the modern Bubonic Plague, with the assistance of trains and cars
*difficulties with the attempt to explain the rapid spread of the Black Death by arguing that it was spread by the rare pneumonic form of the disease — in fact this form killed less than 0.3% of the infected population in its worst outbreak ([[Manchuria]] in 1911)
*different seasonality — the modern plague can only be sustained at temperatures between 10 and 26°C and requires high humidity, while the Black Death occurred even in [[Norway]] in the middle of the winter and in the Mediterranean in the middle of hot dry summers
*very different death rates — in several places (including [[Florence]] in 1348) over 75% of the population appears to have died; in contrast the highest mortality for the modern Bubonic Plague was 3% in [[Mumbai]] in 1903
*the cycles and trends of infection were very different between the diseases — humans did not develop resistance to the modern disease, but resistance to the Black Death rose sharply, so that eventually it became mainly a childhood disease
Cohn also points out that while the identification of the disease as having buboes relies on accounts of [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] and others, they described buboes, [[abscess]]es, [[rash]]es and [[carbuncle]]s occurring all over the body, the neck or behind the ears. In contrast, the modern disease rarely has more than one bubo, most commonly in the groin, and is not characterised by abscesses, rashes and carbuncles.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Black Death | encyclopedia =Encyclopedia of Population | volume = 1 | pages = 98–101 | publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Reference]] |year=2003 | id = ISBN 0-02-865677-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have offered a mathematical model based on the changing demography of Europe from 1000 to 1800 AD demonstrating how plague epidemics, 1347 to 1670, could have provided the selection pressure that raised the frequency of a [[CCR5#CCR5-.CE.9432|mutation]] to the level seen today that prevent HIV from entering [[macrophages]] that carry the mutation (the average frequency of this [[allele]] is 10% in European populations).&lt;ref name=Duncan2005&gt;{{cite journal| author = Duncan Chris| title = Reappraisal of the historical selective pressures for the CCR5-Δ32 mutation| journal = Journal of Medical Genetics| year = 2005| volume = 42| pages = 205–208 | pmid = 15744032| doi = 10.1136/jmg.2004.025346| last2 = Scott| first2 = S| last3 = Duncan| first3 = CJ| issue = 3| pmc = 1736018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that the original single mutation appeared over 2,500 years ago and that persistent epidemics of a [[haemorrhagic fever]] struck at the early classical civilizations.

However recent research published in the open-access scientific journal ''[http://www.plospathogens.org PloS Pathogens]'' in October 2010 presented conclusive evidence that two previously unknown [[clade]]s (variant strains) of ''Y. pestis'' were responsible for the Black Death. A multinational team conducted new surveys that used both ancient DNA analyses and protein-specific detection to find DNA and protein signatures specific for ''Y. pestis'' in human skeletons from widely distributed mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences. The authors concluded that this research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany,

:&quot;...ends the debate about the etiology of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that Y. pestis was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages.&quot;

The study also identified two previously unknown but related strains of ''Y. pestis'' that were associated with distinct medieval mass graves. These were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the present-day ''Y. pestis'' strains 'Orientalis' and 'Medievalis', suggesting that these variant strains (which are now presumed to be extinct) may have entered Europe in two waves. Surveys of plague pit remains in France and England indicate that the first variant entered Europe through the port of [[Marseille]] around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three successive epidemics.

However, surveys of plague pit remains from the Netherlands town of [[Bergen op Zoom]] showed evidence of a second ''Y. pestis'' genotype which differed from that found in Britain and France and this second strain is now thought to have been responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350. This discovery implies that Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France c. AD 1349, and the researchers have suggested that a second wave of plague infection, distinct from that which occurred in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities, or another site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1001134 Stephanie Haensch et al, &quot;Distinct Clones of Yersinia pestis Caused the Black Death&quot;, ''PloS Pathogens'', 7 October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Pandemic===
{{main|Third Pandemic}}
The [[Third Pandemic]] began in [[China]] in 1855, spreading plague to all inhabited continents and ultimately killing more than 12 million people in [[India]] and [[China]] alone. Casualty patterns indicate that waves of this pandemic may have come from two different sources. The first was primarily [[bubo]]nic and was carried around the world through ocean-going trade, transporting infected persons, rats, and cargoes harboring fleas. The second, more virulent strain was primarily [[Pneumonic device|pneumonic]] in character, with a strong person-to-person contagion. This strain was largely confined to [[Manchuria]] and [[Mongolia]]. Researchers during the &quot;Third Pandemic&quot; identified plague vectors and the plague bacterium (see above), leading in time to modern treatment methods.

Plague occurred in [[Russia]] in 1877&amp;ndash;1889 in rural areas near the [[Ural Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea]]. Efforts in hygiene and patient isolation reduced the spread of the disease, with approximately 420 deaths in the region. Significantly, the region of [[Vetlianka]] in this area is near a population of the [[Bobak Marmot|bobak marmot]], a small rodent considered a very dangerous plague reservoir. The last significant Russian outbreak of Plague was in [[Siberia]] in 1910 after sudden demand for Marmot skins (a substitute for [[Sable]]) increased the price by 400 percent. The traditional hunters would not hunt a sick Marmot and it was taboo to eat the fat from under the arm (the axillary [[lymph node|lymphatic gland]] that often harboured the plague) so outbreaks tended to be confined to single individuals. The price increase, however, attracted thousands of [[China|Chinese]] hunters from [[Manchuria]] who not only caught the sick animals but also ate the fat, which was considered a delicacy. The plague spread from the hunting grounds to the terminus of the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] and then followed the track for 2,700&amp;nbsp;km. The plague lasted 7 months and killed 60,000 people.

The bubonic plague continued to circulate through different ports globally for the next fifty years; however, it was primarily found in Southeast Asia. An epidemic in [[Hong Kong]] in 1894 had particularly high death rates, 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pryor | first = E.G.| title = The Great Plague of Hong Kong | journal = Journal of the Hong Kong Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society | volume = 1975| pages = 69 | publisher = Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

[[Mumbai plague epidemic]] struck the city of [[Mumbai]] (Bombay) in 1896. The disease reached the [[Republic of Hawaii]] in December 1899, and the [[Board of Health of Hawaii|Board of Health’s]] decision to initiate controlled burns of select buildings in [[Honolulu]]’s [[Chinatown]] turned into an uncontrolled fire which led to the inadvertent burning of most of Chinatown on January 20, 1900 according to the [http://starbulletin.com/2000/01/24/features/story1.html Star Bulletin's Feature on the Great Chinatown Fire]. Plague finally reached the United States later that year in [[San Francisco]], and persisted in Hawaii on the outer islands of Maui and Hawaii (The Big Island) until it was finally eradicated in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1794/7694/Bailey_Kevin_thesis2007.pdf?sequence=1 Uoregon.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the outbreak that began in [[China]] in 1855 is conventionally known as the [[Third Pandemic]], (see above), it is unclear whether there have been fewer, or more, than three major outbreaks of bubonic plague. Most modern outbreaks of bubonic plague amongst humans have been preceded by a striking, high mortality amongst rats, yet this phenomenon is absent from descriptions of some earlier plagues, especially the Black Death. The buboes, or swellings in the groin, that are especially characteristic of bubonic plague, are a feature of other diseases as well.

Research done by a team of biologists from the Institute of Pasteur in Paris and Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in Germany by analyzing the DNA and proteins from plague pits was published in Oct., 2010, reported beyond doubt that all 'the three major plagues' were due to at least two previously unknown strains of ''Yersinia pestis'' and originated from China [http://www.uni-mainz.de/eng/13883.php  Yersinia pestis bacteria clearly identified as the cause of the big plague epidemic of the Middle Ages]. A team of medical geneticists led by Mark Achtman of University College Cork in Ireland reconstructed a family tree of the bacterium and concluded in an online issue of Nature Genetics published on 31 Oct., 2010 that all three of the great waves of plague originated from China.

==Plague as a biological weapon==
{{Refimprove|date=July 2007}}
Plague has a long history as a [[biological weapon]]. Historical accounts from [[ancient China]] and [[medieval Europe]] detail the use of infected animal carcasses, such as cows or horses, and human carcasses, by the [[Xiongnu]]/[[Huns]], [[Mongols]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], and other groups, to contaminate enemy water supplies. [[Han Dynasty]] General [[Huo Qubing]] is recorded to have died of such a contamination while engaging in warfare against the Xiongnu. Plague victims were also reported to have been tossed by [[catapult]] into cities under siege.

In 1347, the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] possession of [[Theodosia|Caffa]], a great trade emporium on the [[Crimea]]n peninsula, came under siege by an army of [[Mongol]] warriors of the [[Golden Horde]] under the command of [[Janibeg]]. After a protracted siege during which the Mongol army was reportedly withering from the disease, they decided to use the infected corpses as a biological weapon. The corpses were catapulted over the city walls, infecting the inhabitants. The Genoese traders fled, transferring the plague ([[Black Death]]) via their ships into the south of [[Europe]], whence it rapidly spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol8no9/01-0536.htm |author=Wheelis M. |title=Biological warfare at the 1346 siege of Caffa. |journal=Emerg Infect Dis |publisher=Center for Disease Control|year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] developed weaponised plague, based on the breeding and release of large numbers of fleas. During the Japanese occupation of [[Manchuria]], [[Unit 731]] deliberately infected [[Chinese people|Chinese]], Korean, and Manchurian [[civilian]]s and [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] with the plague bacterium. These subjects, termed &quot;maruta&quot;, or &quot;logs&quot;, were then studied by [[dissection]], others by [[Human Subject Research#Human vivisection|vivisection]] while still conscious. Members of the unit such as [[Shiro Ishii]] were exonerated from the [[Tokyo tribunal]] by [[Douglas MacArthur]] but 12 of them were prosecuted in the [[Khabarovsk War Crime Trials]] in 1949 during which some admitted having spread [[Bubonic plague]] within a 36-km radius around the city of [[Battle of Changde|Changde]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Barenblatt, ''A plague upon Humanity'', HarperCollns, 2004, pp.220-221&lt;/ref&gt;

Ishii innovated bombs containing live mice and fleas, with very small explosive loads, to deliver the weaponized microbes, overcoming the problem of the explosive killing the infected animal and insect by the use of a ceramic, rather than metal, casing for the warhead. While no records survive of the actual usage of the ceramic shells, prototypes exist and are believed to have been used in experiments during WWII.

After World War II, both the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] developed means of weaponising pneumonic plague. Experiments included various delivery methods, vacuum drying, sizing the bacterium, developing strains resistant to antibiotics, combining the bacterium with other diseases (such as [[diphtheria]]), and genetic engineering. Scientists who worked in [[Soviet Union|USSR]] bio-weapons programs have stated that the Soviet effort was formidable and that large stocks of weaponised plague bacteria were produced. Information on many of the Soviet projects is largely unavailable. Aerosolized pneumonic plague remains the most significant threat. The plague can be easily treated with antibiotics, thus a widespread [[epidemic]] is highly unlikely in developed countries.

==1994 epidemic in Surat, India==
{{main|1994 plague epidemic in Surat}}
In 1994, there was a pneumonic plague epidemic in [[Surat]], [[India]] that resulted in 52 deaths and in a large internal migration of about 300,000 residents, who fled fearing quarantine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pneumonic Plague Epidemic in Sural | publisher = [[Association of American Geographers]] | url = http://www.aag.org/hdgc/www/health/units/unit4/html/4bkground.html | accessdate = 2008-04-26}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A combination of heavy monsoon rain and clogged sewers led to massive flooding which resulted in unhygienic conditions and a number of uncleared animal carcasses. It is believed that this situation precipitated the epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Surat: A Victim of Its Open Sewers | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = September 25, 1994 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E0DB123AF936A1575AC0A962958260 | accessdate = 2008-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was widespread fear that the flood of refugees might spread the epidemic to other parts of India and the world, but that scenario was averted, probably as a result of effective public health response mounted by the Indian health authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =  With Old Skills and New, India Battles the Plague | publisher = New York Times | date = September 29, 1994 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE3D7113AF93AA1575AC0A962958260 | accessdate = 2008-04-26 | first=John F. | last=Burns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much like the [[Black Death]] that spread through medieval Europe, some questions still remain unanswered about the 1994 epidemic in Surat.&lt;ref name = &quot;nmdsll&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Plague's Origins A Mystery | publisher = New York Times | date = March 14, 1995 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE3DB173BF937A25750C0A963958260 | accessdate = 2008-04-26 | first=Sanjoy | last=Hazarika}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial questions about whether it was an epidemic of plague arose because the Indian health authorities were unable to culture ''Yersinia pestis'', but this could have been due to poor laboratory procedures.&lt;ref name = &quot;nmdsll&quot;/&gt; Yet, there are several lines of evidence strongly suggesting that it was a plague epidemic: blood tests for Yersinia were positive, a number of individuals showed antibodies against Yersinia and the clinical symptoms displayed by the affected were all consistent with the disease being plague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Surat Plague and its Aftermath | publisher = Godshen Robert Pallipparambil | url = http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/YersiniaEssays/Godshen.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other contemporary cases==

&lt;!-- Please put new additions at the bottom of this section --&gt;

* On August 31, 1984, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] reported a case of [[pneumonia|pneumonic]] plague in [[Claremont, California]]. The CDC believes that the patient, a [[veterinarian]], contracted plague from a stray cat. As the cat wasn't available for necropsy, this could not be ultimately confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Plague Pneumonia &amp;ndash; California | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]] | date = August 31, 1984 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000394.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From 1995 to 1998, annual outbreaks of plague were witnessed in [[Mahajanga]], Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boisier |first1=Pascal |last2=Rahalison |first2=Lila |last3=Rasolomaharo |first3=Monique |last4=Ratsitorahina |first4=Maherisoa |last5=Mahafaly |first5=Mahafaly |last6=Razafimahefa |first6=Maminirana |last7=Duplantier |first7=Jean-Marc |last8=Ratsifasoamanana |first8=Lala |last9=Chanteau |first9=Suzanne |year=2002 |title=Epidemiologic Features of Four Successive Annual Outbreaks of Bubonic Plague in Mahajanga, Madagascar |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |publisher= |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=311–316 |doi=10.3201/eid0803.010250 |pmid=11927030 |pmc=2732468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, York performed a necropsy on a [[mountain lion]] that had likely perished from the disease and three days afterward York complained of flu-like symptoms and called in sick from work. He was treated at a local clinic but was not diagnosed with any serious ailment. The discovery of his death sparked a minor health scare, with officials stating he likely died of either plague or [[hantavirus]], and 49 people who had come in to contact with York were given aggressive antibiotic treatments. None of them fell ill. Autopsy results released on November 9, confirmed the presence of ''Y. pestis'' in his body, confirming plague as a likely cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Baudot code''', invented by [[Émile Baudot]],&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Ralston and Edwin D. Reilly (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Computer Science'' Third Edition, IEEE Press/Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York 1993, ISBN 0-442-27679-6 ''Baudot Code''&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[character encoding|character set]] predating [[EBCDIC]] and [[ASCII]]. It was the predecessor to the International Telegraph Alphabet No 2 (ITA2), the [[teleprinter]] code in use until the advent of ASCII. Each character in the alphabet is represented by a [[Asynchronous communication|series of bits]], sent over a communication channel such as a telegraph wire or a radio signal. The [[symbol rate]] measurement is known as [[baud]], and is derived from the same name.

==History==
Baudot invented his original code during 1870 and patented it during 1874. It was a 5-bit code, with equal on and off intervals, which allowed telegraph transmission of the Roman alphabet and punctuation and control signals. It was based on an earlier code developed by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The code was entered on a keyboard which had just five piano type keys, operated with two fingers of the left hand and three fingers of the right hand. Once the keys had been pressed they were locked down until mechanical contacts in a distributor unit passed over the sector connected to that particular keyboard, when the keyboard was unlocked ready for the next character to be entered, with an audible click (known as the &quot;cadence signal&quot;) to warn the operator. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beauchamp | first = K.G. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = History of Telegraphy: Its Technology and Application | publisher = [[IET]] | year = 2001 | location = | pages = 394–395 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0852967926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudot's code became known as '''International Telegraph Alphabet No. 1''', and is no longer used.

===Murray code===
[[Image:Baudot Tape.JPG|thumb|240px|upright|Paper tape with holes representing the &quot;Baudot Code&quot;]]
During 1901 Baudot's code was modified by [[Donald Murray (Telegraphy pioneer)|Donald Murray]] (1865–1945), prompted by his development of a typewriter-like keyboard. The Murray system employed an intermediate step, a keyboard perforator, which allowed an operator to punch a paper tape, and a tape transmitter for sending the message from the punched tape. At the receiving end of the line, a printing mechanism would print on a paper tape, and/or a reperforator could be used to make a perforated copy of the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Foster |first=Maximilian |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1901 |month=August |title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=IF6tNZnhO7wC&amp;pg=PA1195 A Successful Printing Telegraph] |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=II |issue= |pages=1195–1199 |id= |url= |accessdate=2009-07-09 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As there was no longer a direct correlation between the operator's hand movement and the bits transmitted, there was no concern about arranging the code to minimize operator fatigue, and instead Murray designed the code to minimize wear on the machinery, assigning the code combinations with the fewest punched holes to the most [[letter frequencies|frequently used characters]].

The Murray code also introduced what became known as &quot;format effectors&quot; or &quot;[[control character]]s&quot; - the [[Carriage return|CR]] (Carriage Return) and [[Newline|LF]] (Line Feed) codes. A few of Baudot's codes moved to the positions where they have stayed ever since: the NULL or BLANK and the DEL code. NULL/BLANK was used as an idle code for when no messages were being sent.

Early [[Creed &amp; Company|British Creed]] machines used the Murray system.

===Western Union===
[[Image:Baudotkeyboard.png|right|frame|422px|Keyboard of a [[Teletype]] using the Baudot code, with FIGS and LTRS shift keys.]]
Murray's code was adopted by [[Western Union]] which used it until the 1950s, with a few changes that consisted of omitting some characters and adding more control codes. An explicit SPC (space) character was introduced, in place of the BLANK/NULL, and a new [[Bell character|BEL]] code rang a bell or otherwise produced an audible signal at the receiver. Additionally, the WRU or &quot;Who aRe yoU?&quot; code was introduced, which caused a receiving machine to send an identification stream back to the sender.

===ITA2===
Around 1930, the [[CCITT]] introduced the '''International Telegraphy Alphabet No. 2''' ('''ITA2''') code as an international standard, which was based on the Western Union code with some minor changes. The US standardized on a version of ITA2 called the American Teletypewriter code (USTTY) which was the basis for 5-bit teletype codes until the debut of 7-bit ASCII in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Smith | first = Gil | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Teletypewriter Communication Codes | work = | publisher = Baudot.net | year = 2001 | url = http://www.baudot.net/docs/smith--teletype-codes.pdf | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2008-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ITA2 is still used in [[Telecommunications devices for the deaf|TDDs]] and some [[amateur radio]] applications, such as [[radioteletype]] (&quot;RTTY&quot;).  Though it is significantly different from Baudot's original code, it is nonetheless often incorrectly referred to as &quot;Baudot code&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gillam | first = Richard | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Unicode Demystified: | publisher = Addison-Wesley | year = 2002 | location = | pages = 30 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0201700522}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Baudot's original code was adapted to be sent from a manual keyboard and no teleprinter equipment was ever constructed that used it in its original form.&lt;ref&gt;http://wps.com/projects/codes/index.html#BAUDOT History of character codes, retrieved 2008 June 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
Nearly all 20th century teleprinter equipment used Western Union's code, ITA2, or variants thereof. Radio amateurs casually call ITA2 and variants &quot;baudot&quot; incorrectly, and even the [[American Radio Relay League]]'s Amateur Radio Handbook does so, though in more recent editions the tables of codes correctly identifies it as ITA2.

==Details==
NOTE: This table presumes the space called &quot;1&quot; by Baudot and Murray is rightmost, and least significant.  The actual order of transmission varied by manufacturer.{{clarify|date=September 2010|what table and what space?}}

[[Image:Ita2.png|right|frame|Table of USTTY codes (expressed as [[hexadecimal]] numbers)]]
In ITA2, characters are expressed using five bits. ITA2 uses two code sub-sets, the &quot;letter shift&quot; (LTRS), and the &quot;figure shift&quot; (FIGS). The FIGS character (11011) signals that the following code is to be interpreted as being in the FIGS set, until this is reset by the LTRS (11111) character.  &quot;ENQuiry&quot; will trigger the other machine's answerback. It means &quot;Who are you?&quot;

CR is [[carriage return]], LF is [[line feed]], BEL is the [[bell character]] which rang a small [[bell (instrument)|bell]] (often used to alert operators to an incoming message), SP is space, and NUL is the [[null character]] (blank tape).

Note: the binary conversions of the codepoints are often shown in reverse order, depending on (presumably) from which side one views the paper tape. Note further that the [[control character|&quot;control&quot; characters]] were chosen so that they were either symmetric or in useful pairs so that inserting a tape &quot;upside down&quot; did not result in problems for the equipment and the resulting printout could be deciphered.  Thus FIGS (11011), LTRS (11111) and space (00100) are invariant, while CR (00010) and LF (01000), generally used as a pair, result in the same output when the tape is reversed. LTRS could also be used to overpunch characters to be deleted on a [[punched tape|paper tape]] (much like DEL in 7-bit [[ASCII]]).

The sequence ''RYRYRY...'' is often used in test messages, and at the start of every transmission. Since R is 01010 and Y is 10101, the sequence exercises much of a teleprinter's mechanical components at maximum stress.  Also, at one time, fine-tuning of the receiver was done using two coloured lights (one for each tone).  'RYRYRY...' produced 0101010101..., which made the lights glow with equal brightness when the tuning was correct. This tuning sequence is only useful when ITA2 is used with two-tone [[FSK]] modulation, such as is commonly seen in [[RTTY|Radio Teletype(RTTY)]] usage.

US implementations of Baudot code may differ in the addition of a few characters, such as #, &amp; on the FIGS layer. The above table represents the US TTY code.

The Russian version of Baudot code ([[MTK-2]]) used three shift modes; the [[Cyrillic letter]] mode was activated by the character (00000). Because of the larger number of characters in the Cyrillic alphabet, the characters [[!]], [[&amp;]], [[£]], and [[Bell character|BEL]] were omitted and replaced by Cyrillics.

'''Blu-Tack''' is a versatile, reusable [[putty]]-like [[Pressure sensitive adhesive|pressure-sensitive adhesive]] produced by [[Bostik]], commonly used to attach papers to walls or other surfaces. The original version of the product was blue, but many colours are now available. Blu-Tack can leave an oily stain on paper materials if attached for a long period of time. {{Whom?|date=April 2011}}

== History ==
In 1970, laboratory researcher Alan Holloway was working for sealant manufacturer [[Ralli Bondite]] of [[Waterlooville]], England. Holloway inadvertently produced a product that was useless as a sealant, but pliable and semi-elastic.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} This novelty product was demonstrated by Ralli Bondite management to visiting executives from another sealant and adhesive manufacturer, as a means of wall mounting notices. There was no need for secrecy about the formula, as it was of no use for a gun-grade [[Mastic (disambiguation)|mastic]], the main product of Ralli Bondite. In the beginning the potential of this material was not fully recognized, until later when Bostik commenced research into the development of what they were eventually to launch as Blu-Tack. In its conceptual stage the product was white, but was coloured blue in response to concerns received from [[marketing research]] regarding the possibility of children mistaking it for edible [[confectionery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] during March 2008, Blu-Tack changed colour for the first time since 1971 – to pink – to help raise money for Breast Cancer Campaign. 20,000 numbered packs were made available, 10% from each pack going to the charity. The formulation was slightly altered to retain complete consistency with its blue counterpart. Since then, many coloured variations have been made, including the green (Halloween pack), red and white.

Blu-Tack launched a competition in October 2009{{where?|date=February 2009}} to &quot;Create the next Blu-Tack advert&quot; that will be used for their 2010 campaign film maker competition.

Blu-Tack is also used for sculpture. Artist Elizabeth Thompson created a giant 200 kilogram sculpture of a spider using Blu-Tack over a wire frame. It took 4000 packs and was exhibited at London Zoo in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flickr.com/photos/elizabeth_thompson/2574564991/&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists have created works from the material, and there is a large international body of dedicated users of Blu-Tack who create minor art works and stop-motion animation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The British Blu-Tack web site takes a keen interest in these activities and has a section devoted to them. There was also a man who put a thumb-print into a piece of Blu-Tack and sold it at an art auction for over £100,000.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

'''''Bacillus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[Gram-positive]] rod-shaped [[bacteria]] and a member of the division [[Firmicutes]]. ''Bacillus'' species can be obligate [[aerobe]]s or [[facultative aerobes|facultative anaerobes]], and test positive for the [[enzyme]] [[catalase]].&lt;ref name=Baron&gt;{{cite book | author = Turnbull PCB | title = Bacillus. ''In:'' Barron's Medical Microbiology ''(Baron S ''et al.'', eds.)| edition = 4th | publisher = Univ of Texas Medical Branch | year = 1996 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.925 | isbn = 0-9631172-1-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubiquitous in nature, ''Bacillus'' includes both [[free-living]] and [[pathogenic species]]. Under stressful environmental conditions, the cells produce oval [[endospore]]s that can stay dormant for extended periods. These characteristics originally defined the genus, but not all such species are closely related, and many have been moved to other genera.&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite book | author = Madigan M; Martinko J (editors). | title = Brock Biology of Microorganisms | edition = 11th | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-13-144329-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial significance==
Many ''Bacillus'' species are able to [[secretion|secrete]] large quantities of enzymes.  ''[[Bacillus amyloliquefaciens]]'' is a species of ''Bacillus'' that is the source of a natural antibiotic protein [[barnase]] (a [[ribonuclease]]), [[alpha amylase]] used in starch hydrolysis,  the [[protease]] [[subtilisin]] used with detergents, and the [[BamH1]] [[restriction enzyme]] used in DNA research.

A portion of the ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' genome was incorporated into corn (and cotton) crops.  The resulting [[GMO]]s are therefore resistant to some insect pests.

==Use as model organism==
''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' is one of the best understood prokaryotes, in terms of molecular biology and cell biology. Its superb genetic amenability and relatively large size have provided the powerful tools required to investigate a bacterium from all possible aspects. Recent improvements in fluorescence microscopy techniques have provided novel and amazing insight into the dynamic structure of a single cell organism. Research on ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' has been at the forefront of bacterial molecular biology and cytology, and the organism is a model for differentiation, gene/protein regulation, and cell cycle events in bacteria.&lt;ref name=Graumann&gt;{{cite book | author = Graumann P (editor). | title = Bacillus: Cellular and Molecular Biology  | edition = 1st | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2007 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/bac | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/bac ISBN 978-1-904455-12-7 ]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical significance==
Two ''Bacillus'' species are considered medically significant: ''[[Bacillus anthracis|B. anthracis]]'', which causes [[anthrax]], and ''[[Bacillus cereus|B. cereus]]'', which causes a [[foodborne illness]] similar to that of ''[[Staphylococcus]]''.&lt;ref name=Sherris&gt;{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ; Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A third species, ''[[B. thuringiensis]]'', is an important [[insect]] pathogen, and is sometimes used to control insect pests. The [[type species]] is ''[[Bacillus subtilis|B. subtilis]]'', an important [[model organism]]. It is also a notable food spoiler, causing ropiness in bread and related food. ''[[Bacillus coagulans|B. coagulans]]'' is also important in food spoilage.

An easy way to isolate ''Bacillus'' is by placing non-sterile soil in a [[test tube]] with water, shaking, placing in melted [[mannitol salt agar]], and incubating at room temperature for at least a day.  Colonies are usually large, spreading and irregularly-shaped.  Under the microscope, the ''Bacillus'' appear as rods, and a substantial portion usually contain an oval [[endospore]] at one end, making it bulge.

==The cell wall==
The cell wall of ''Bacillus'' is a structure on the outside of the cell that forms the second barrier between the bacterium and the environment, and at the same time maintains rectangle  shape and withstands the pressure generated by the cell's turgor. The cell wall is composed of [[teichoic acid|teichoic]] and teichuronic acids. ''B. subtilis'' is the first bacterium for which the role of an [[actin]]-like [[cytoskeleton]] in cell shape determination and [[peptidoglycan]] synthesis was identified and for which the entire set of peptidoglycan synthesizing enzymes was localised. The role of the cytoskeleton in shape generation and maintenance is important.&lt;ref name=Scheffers&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/bac |author=Scheffers DJ|chapter=The Cell Nuculus of Bacillus subtilis | title = Bacillus: Cellular and Molecular Biology ''(Graumann P, ed.)|  publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2007 | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/bac ISBN 978-1-904455-12-7 ]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phylogeny==
The genus Bacillus was coined in 1872 to contain rod shaped bacteria, later amended to spore-forming gram-positive/variable rod-shaped bacteria,&lt;ref&gt;COHN (F.): Untersuchungen über Bakterien. Beitrage zur Biologie der Pflanzen Heft 2, 1872, 1, 127-224.&lt;/ref&gt; consequently like other genera associated with the early history of microbiology, such as [[Pseudomonas]] or [[Vibrio]], consequently members of the ''Bacillus'' genus (266 species&lt;ref&gt;{{lpsn|b/bacillus.html|Bacillus}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are found ubiquitously and is one of the genera with the largest 16S diversity and environmental diversity.

Several studies have embarked in trying to reconstruct the phylogeny of the genus. The Bacillus specific study with the most diversity covered is by Xu and Cote' using 16S and the ITS region, where they diving the genus into 10 groups, which includes the nested genera Paenibacillus, Brevibacillus, Geobacillus, Marinibacillus and Virgibacillus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1099/Ijs.0.02346-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the tree [http://www.arb-silva.de/fileadmin/silva_databases/living_tree/LTP_release_104/LTPs104_SSU_tree.pdf] constructed by the living tree project, a collaboration between ARB-Silva and LPSN where a 16S (and 23S if available) tree of all validated species was constructed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/J.Syapm.2008.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/j.syapm.2010.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; the genus Bacillus contains a very large amount of nested taxa and majorly in both 16S and 23S it is paraphyletic to Lactobacillales (Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Listeria etc), due to ''[[Bacillus coahuilensis]]'' and others. A gene concatenation study found similar results to Xu and Cote' but with a much more limited number of species in terms of groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1186/1471-2164-11-332}}&lt;/ref&gt; but used Listeria as an outgroup so in light of the ARB tree it may be &quot;inside-out&quot;.

One clade formed by ''Bacillus anthracis'', ''Bacillus cereus'', ''Bacillus mycoides'', ''Bacillus pseudomycoides'', ''Bacillus thuringiensis'' and ''Bacillus weihenstephanensis'' under current classification standards should be a single species (within 97% 16S identity), but due to medical reasons they are considered separate species,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bacterio.cict.fr/bacdico/bb/anthracis.html&lt;/ref&gt; an issue also present for four species of ''[[Shigella]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;BRENNER (D.J.): Family I. Enterobacteriaceae Rahn 1937, Nom. fam. cons. Opin. 15, Jud. Com. 1958, 73; Ewing, Farmer, and Brenner 1980, 674; Judicial Commission 1981, 104. In: N.R. KRIEG and J.G.

'''Brasília''' ({{IPA-pt|bɾaˈziliɐ}}) is the [[capital (political)|capital]] of [[Brazil]]. The name is commonly spelled ''Brasilia'' in English. The city and its [[Brazilian Federal District|District]] are located in the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West region]] of the country, along a plateau known as ''[[Planalto Central]]''. It has a population of about 2,557,000 (3,599,000 in the metropolitan area) as of the 2008 [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] estimate, making it the fourth largest city in Brazil. However, as a [[metropolitan area]], it ranks lower at sixth. It is listed as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]. Brasília hosts 123 foreign [[embassies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.mre.gov.br/cerimonial|title=Lista do Corpo Diplomático e Organismos Internacionais|publisher=Cerimonial, Ministério das Relações Exteriores|date= |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the national capital, Brasília is the seat of all three branches of the [[Politics of Brazil|Brazilian government]]. The city also hosts the headquarters of many Brazilian companies such as the [[Banco do Brasil]], [[Caixa Econômica Federal]], [[Correios]] and [[Brasil Telecom]]. The city is a world reference for [[urban planning]]. Planning policies such as the locating of residential buildings around expansive urban areas, as well as building the city around large avenues and dividing it into sectors, have sparked a debate and reflection on life in big cities in the 20th century. The city's planned design included specific areas for almost everything{{clarify|date=May 2011}}, including accommodation, Hotel Sectors North and South. New areas are now being developed for hotels, such as the Hotels and Tourism Sector North, on the shore of Lake Paranoá.

The city was planned and developed in 1956 with [[Lucio Costa|Lúcio Costa]] as the principal urban planner and [[Oscar Niemeyer]] as the principal architect. On April 22 of 1960, it formally became Brazil's national capital. Viewed from above, the main portion of the city resembles an airplane or a butterfly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infobrasilia.com.br/lucio.htm |title=Lucio Costa |publisher=Infobrasilia.com.br |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;z=12&amp;ll=-15.79787,-47.896271&amp;spn=0.143704,0.233459&amp;t=k |title=Google Maps |publisher=Maps.google.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is commonly referred to as ''Capital Federal'', or simply ''BSB''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutbrasilia.com/ |title=About Brasilia |publisher=About Brasilia |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents of Brasília are known as ''brasilienses'' or ''candangos'' (the latter referring to those not born in the city, but migrated there when the city was established).

Brasília has a unique status in Brazil, as it is not a municipality like nearly all [[List of cities in Brazil|cities in Brazil]]. Although there is no legal definition for Brasília, the term is almost always used synonymously with the [[Brazilian Federal District]], and thus constitutes an indivisible [[Federative Unit]], analogous to a state. In the region, however, the word Brasília often refers only to the First Administrative Region within the [[Brazilian Federal District|Distrito Federal]] (Federal District), where the most important government buildings are located. This is in contrast with the surrounding &quot;satellite cities,&quot; which nevertheless are also part of the Federal District, and as such, Brasília, in a broader sense.

[[Brasília International Airport]] is the main [[airport]] in Brasília, connecting the capital to all major Brazilian cities and many international destinations. It is the third most important airport of Brazil, in terms of passengers and aircraft movements.

==History==
{{Main|History of Brasília|History of Brazil}}
[[File:0741 NOV B 05 Esplanada dos Ministerios Brasilia DF 03 09 1959.jpg|thumb|right|Brasília under construction in 1959.]]
President [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] ordered the construction of Brasília, fulfilling an article of the country's constitution dating back to 1891 stating that the capital should be moved from [[Rio de Janeiro]] to a place close to the center of the country. The plan was originally conceived in 1827 by [[José Bonifácio]], an advisor to Emperor Dom Pedro I. He presented a plan to the General Assembly for a new city called Brasilia, with the idea of moving the capital westward from the heavily populated southeastern corridor. The bill was not enacted because Emperor Dom Pedro I dissolved the Assembly.

[[Lúcio Costa]] won a contest and was the main urban planner in 1957, with 5550 people competing. [[Oscar Niemeyer]], a close friend, was the chief architect of most public buildings and [[Roberto Burle Marx]] was the [[landscape architecture|landscape designer]]. Brasília was built in 41 months, from 1956 to April 21, 1960, when it was officially inaugurated. From 1763 to 1960, [[Rio de Janeiro]] was the capital of Brazil. At this time, resources tended to be centered in Brazil's southeast region near Rio de Janeiro. Brasília's geographically central location fostered a more regionally neutral federal capital. The idea of locating the capital in the center of Brazil was first suggested in 1891, but not defined until 1922.

From the beginning, the growth of Brasília exceeded expectations. Until the 1980s, the governor of the Distrito Federal was appointed by the Federal Government, and the laws of Brasília were issued by the Brazilian Federal Senate. With the Constitution of 1988 Brasília gained the right to elect its Governor, and a District Assembly (Câmara Legislativa) was elected to exercise legislative power.

According to legend, [[Italy|Italian]] saint [[John Bosco|Don Bosco]] in 1883 had a dream in which he described a futuristic city that roughly fitted Brasília's location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santuariodombosco.org.br/dom_bosco.php History of Don Bosco and Brasília]&lt;/ref&gt; In Brasília today, there are many references to this educator who founded the [[Salesian]] order, and one church in the city bears his name.

==Background==
[[File:BrasiliaBanNacional.jpg|thumb|right|Brasília in the morning.]]
[[File:North lake entrance (2).JPG|thumb|right|Entrance of the North Lake.]]
Brasília was built so that the federal capital of Brazil could be transferred from the coast to the Mideastern interior. The name &quot;Brasilia&quot; comes from [[Latin]] and means &quot;Brazil&quot;. Previously the capital of Brazil was in [[Rio de Janeiro]] (1763–1960) and before that in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] (1549–1763). Brazil was not the only federal nation to plan and purpose-build a new capital city: [[Washington D.C.|Washington]] was constructed in the late 18th century, becoming the capital of the [[United States]] in 1800, and [[Canberra]] was declared capital of [[Australia]] in 1927.

By relocating the capital city to the interior, the government intended to help populate that area of the country. People from all over the country were hired to build the city, especially those from the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast region]] of Brazil. Brasília is known internationally for having applied the principles in the [[Athens Charter]] of 1933.

Brasília was planned to have smooth transit flow. [[Lucio Costa|Lúcio Costa]] planned the streets so that traffic signals would be unnecessary. Cars and buses would take thoroughfares to travel long distances, then use one of several loops for access to local streets to reach specific destinations.

Much of the original planning had to be changed, mostly because of the growth of Brasília. Costa did not foresee such a quick growth of the city, much less the explosive growth in the [[satellite city|satellite cities]] around it. Brasília today has traffic signals, and there is a scarcity of parking places, and traffic jams are usual at peak hours, particularly in some busier loops. Although the present situation is not as planned by Costa, transit in Brasília is much better than in other major [[List of largest cities in Brazil|Brazilian cities]]. There is stricter law enforcement, which results in better educated drivers; for example, Brasília is one of the few cities in Brazil where a driver will yield to a pedestrian in a crosswalk.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The streets are usually in good condition, which minimizes accidents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The main reason for Brasília having better transit is Costa's plan: vehicles still make use of the system of thoroughfares, loops and local streets to reach their destinations. The main thoroughfare is the Eixão (big Axis, or Eixo Rodoviário, in Costa's Plan). It is a high speed highway which bisects Brasília from north to south, with three lanes each direction, and no traffic signals.

===Climate===
{{See also|Climate of Brazil}}
[[File:CeuBrasilia.jpg|thumb|right|Winter day in Brasília.]]
The national capital's climate is [[Tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') according to many of Köppen's classifications. Brasilia's climate closely borders a [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cwa/Cwb''), showing many of the &quot;eternal spring&quot; features of that climate. The individual seasons are defined according to the degree of humidity of the air: one season is dry, while the other one is comparatively humid. The average temperature is {{convert|20.5|°C|°F|abbr=on|lk=off}}.&lt;ref name = &quot;worldweather&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.worldweather.org/136/c00290.htm|title=World Weather Brasilia|publisher= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
September, at the end of the dry season, has the highest average maximum temperature, {{convert|28|°C|°F|abbr=on|lk=off}}, and July has the lowest average maximum temperature, {{convert|26|°C|°F|abbr=on|lk=off}}. The lowest average minimum temperature is in June and July {{convert|11|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Average temperatures from September through April are a consistent {{convert|22|°C|°F|abbr=on|lk=off}}. Those, however, are monthly averages; temperatures sometimes fall outside of this range.
The absolute minimum temperature recorded was {{convert|0|°C|°F|abbr=on|lk=off}}, and the absolute maximum was {{convert|37|°C|°F|abbr=on|lk=off}}.

The dry season lasts from late March or early April to late September or early October, though there is commonly some rain also in late May. [[Humidity]] averages about 50% during the dry season, but often falls below 30% around noon.

[[File:Complexo Cultural interior.jpg|thumb|Cultural Complex of Brasília.]]
According to the [[IBGE]] of 2010, there were 2,562,963 residents in the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/censo2010/tabelas_pdf/total_populacao_distrito_federal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The population density was {{convert|423.3|PD/sqkm|PD/sqmi}}. The racial makeup of the city was 1,008,199 [[White Brazilian|White]] people (49.15%), 918,305 [[Brown people#Pardos in Brazil|Brown]] ([[Multiracial#Brazil|Multiracial]]) people (44.77%), 98,462 [[Afro-Brazilian|Black]] people (4.80%), 7,996 [[Asian Brazilian|Asian]] (0.39%) and 7,154 [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]] people (0.35%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/listabl.asp?z=cd&amp;o=7&amp;i=P&amp;c=2094|title=Síntese de Indicadores Sociais 2000|publisher=[[IBGE]]|location=Brasília, Brazil|format=PDF|isbn=85-240-3919-1|accessdate=2009-01-31|year=2000|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960 census there were almost 140,000 residents in the new Federal District. By 1970 this figure had grown to more than 537,000. In 2000 the population of the [[Brazilian Federal District]] was over 2,000,000. Planned for only 500,000 inhabitants, Brasília has seen its population grow much more than expected. Several satellite cities have been created over the years to house the extra inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/~augusto_areal/bsb_aug1.htm |title=Population of Brasília |publisher=Geocities.com |date=2007-01-17 |accessdate=2010-04-17|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/~augusto_areal/bsb_aug1.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:42:12|archivedate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning, the growth of Brasília was greater than original estimates. According to the original plans, Brasília would be a city for government authorities and staff. However, during the construction period, Brazilians from all over the country migrated to Brasília, seeking public and private jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutbrasilia.com/facts/history.html |title=Immigration to Brasília |publisher=Aboutbrasilia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This makes it the largest city (by population) in the world at the close of the 20th century that did not exist at the beginning of the century (a distinction held by [[Chicago]] in the 19th century). Brasília has one of the highest growth rates in Brazil, with its population increasing by 2.82% each year, mostly because of internal migration.

Brasília's inhabitants include a foreign population of mostly embassy workers as well as large numbers of Brazilian migrants. Today, the city has important communities of immigrants and refugees. The [[Human Development Index]] in the city is at 0.936 in the year 2000, ([[developed country|developed nation]] level), and the illiteracy rate is around 4.35%.

At the northwestern end of the [[Monumental Axis]] are federal district and municipal buildings, while at the southeastern end, near the middle shore of Lake Paranoá, stand the executive, judicial, and legislative buildings around the Square of Three Powers, the conceptual heart of the city.

These and other major structures were designed by Brazilian architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]]. In the Square of Three Powers, he created as a focal point the dramatic Congressional Palace, which is a composed of five parts: twin administrative towers flanked by a large, white concrete dome (the meeting place of the Senate) and by an equally massive concrete bowl (the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]]), which is joined to the dome by an underlying, flat-roofed building.

A series of low-lying annexes (largely hidden) flank both ends. Also in the square are the glass-faced [[Planalto Palace]] housing the presidential offices, and the Palace of the Supreme Court. Farther east, on a triangle of land jutting into the lake, is the Palace of the Dawn (Palácio da Alvorada; the presidential residence). Between the federal and civic buildings on the Monumental Axis is the city's cathedral, considered by many to be Niemeyer's finest achievement (see photographs of the and interior). The parabolically shaped structure is characterized by its 16 gracefully curving supports, which join in a circle 115 feet (35 meters) above the floor of the nave; stretched between the supports are translucent walls of tinted glass. The nave is entered via a subterranean passage rather than conventional doorways. Other notable buildings are Buriti Palace, Itamaraty Palace (the Palace of Foreign Affairs), the National Theater, and several foreign embassies that creatively embody features of their national architecture. The Brazilian landscape architect [[Roberto Burle Marx]] designed landmark modernist gardens for some of the principal buildings.

Both low-cost and luxury housing were built by the government in the central city. The residential zones of the inner city are arranged into ''superquadras'' (&quot;superblocks&quot;): groups of apartment buildings along with a prescribed number and type of [[school]]s, retail stores, and open spaces. At the northern end of Lake Paranoá, separated from the inner city, is a peninsula with many fashionable homes, and a similar neighbourhood exists on the southern lakeshore. Originally the city planners envisioned extensive public areas along the shores of the [[Reservoir|artificial lake]], but during early development private clubs, hotels, and upscale residences and restaurants gained footholds around the water. Set well apart from the city are suburban [[Satellite town|satellite cities]], including [[Gama (Brazil)|Gama]], [[Ceilândia]], [[Taguatinga (Federal District)|Taguatinga]], Núcleo Bandeirante, [[Sobradinho, Brasília|Sobradinho]], and [[Planaltina]]. These towns, with the exception of Gama and Sobradinho were not planned.

===Monumental Civic Scale===
[[File:Brasília noite.jpg|thumb|right|the Ministries Esplanade at night.]]
The city has been acclaimed for its use of [[modern architecture|modernist architecture]] on a grand scale and for its somewhat [[utopia]]n city plan. It has been criticized for the same reasons.

After a visit to Brasília, the [[French people|French]] writer [[Simone de Beauvoir]] complained that all of its ''superquadras'' exuded &quot;the same air of elegant monotony,&quot; and other observers have equated the city's large open lawns, plazas and fields to wastelands. As the city has matured, some of these have gained adornments, and many have been improved by landscaping, giving some observers a sense of &quot;humanized&quot; spaciousness. Although not fully accomplished, the &quot;Brazilian utopia&quot; has produced a city of relatively high quality of life, in which the citizens live in forested areas with sporting and leisure structure (the ''superquadras'') flanked by small commercial areas, bookstores and cafes; the city is famous for its cuisine and efficiency of transit.

Even these positive features have sparked controversy, expressed in the nickname &quot;ilha da fantasia&quot; (&quot;fantasy island&quot;), indicating the sharp contrast between the city and surrounding regions, marked by poverty and disorganization in the cities of the state of [[Goiás]], around Brasília.

Critics of Brasília's grand scale have characterized it as a modernist platonic fantasy about the future:

 {{Quotation|Nothing dates faster than people's fantasies about the future. This is what you get when perfectly decent, intelligent, and talented men start thinking in terms of space rather than place; and single rather than multiple meanings. It's what you get when you design for political aspirations rather than real human needs. You get miles of jerry-built platonic nowhere infested with volkswagens. This, one may fervently hope, is the last experiment of its kind. The utopian buck stops here.|[[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]]|The Shock of the New, Episode 4: Trouble in Utopia}}

===World Heritage Site===
The Brazilian capital is the only city in the world built in the 20th century to be awarded (in 1987) the status of Historical and [[Cultural heritage|Cultural Heritage]] of Humanity by [[UNESCO]], an agency of the [[United Nations]]. It also holds the distinction of waiting the shortest amount of time to be designated a [[World Heritage Site]] of any UNESCO entry, which occurred just 27 years after its completion in 1960.

==Economy==

[[File:Brasilia Shopping 02.jpg|thumb|right|Shopping in Brasília.]]
The major roles of construction and of services (government, communications, banking and finance, food production, entertainment, and legal services) in Brasília's economy reflect the city's status as a governmental rather than an industrial centre. Industries connected with construction, food processing, and furnishings are important, as are those associated with publishing, printing, and computer software. GDP is divided in Public Administration 54.8%, Services 28.7%, Industry 10.2%, Commerce 6.1%, Agribusiness 0.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdf.df.gov.br/045/04501022.asp |title=GDP - Division - Federal District |publisher=Gdf.df.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being the political center, Brasília is an important economic center. The city is the 3rd richest of Brazil, showing a gross domestic product (GDP) from 99.5 billion reais, representing 3.76% of the total Brazilian GDP.
The main economic activity of the federal capital results from its administrative function. Its industrial planning is studied carefully by the Government of the Federal District. Being a town registered by UNESCO, the government in Brasilia has opted to encourage the development of non-polluting industries such as software, film, video, and gemology among others, with emphasis on environmental preservation and maintaining ecological balance, preserving the city property.

===Services===
[[File:Bancocentralbrasil.JPG|thumb|right|[[Central Bank of Brazil]].]]
(91% of local GDP, according to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]):
* Government - the public sector is by far the largest employer, accounting for around 40% of the city jobs. Government jobs include all levels, from the federal police to diplomacy, from the transportation bureau to the armed forces;
* Communications - the telephony used to be a state monopoly, and Brasilia held the HQ of [[Telebrás]], the central state company; one of the enterprises that resulted from the privatization of the system in the 90's, [[Brasil Telecom]], keeps it HQ in the city; the official Postal Service ([[Correios]]) HQ is located in the city as well; as it is the main place of Federal Government news, it is also notable the activities of [[Television channel|TV stations]], including the main offices of four public networks ([[TV Brasil]]/[[Agência Brasil]], [[TV Câmara]], [[TV Senado]] and [[TV Justiça]]), the regional offices of four major private television networks ([[Globo]], [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão|SBT]], [[Rede Bandeirantes]] and [[Rede Record]]) and a main affiliate of [[RedeTV!]];
* Banking and finance - headquarters of the [[Banco do Brasil]] and the [[Caixa Econômica Federal]], both controlled by the Federal Government, and the [[List of Brazilian companies|Banco de Brasília]], controlled by the city local government; it is also the site of the headquarters of the [[Central Bank of Brazil|Central Bank]], the main government regulatory agency of the fiancial sector;
* Entertainment;
* [[Information technology]] ([[Politec]], Poliedro, CTIS, among others), and legal services.

===Industries===
In the city include:
* Construction (Paulo Octavio, Via Construções, and Irmãos Gravia among others);
* Food processing (Perdigão, Sadia);
* Furniture Making;
* [[Recycling]] (Novo Rio, [[Rexam]], Latasa and others);
* [[Pharmaceuticals]] (União Química);
* Graphic industries.
The main agricultural products produced in the city are [[coffee]], [[guavas]], [[strawberries]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], [[lemon]]s, [[papaya]]s, [[soy bean]]s and [[mangoes]]. It has over 110,000 cows and it exports [[wood]] products worldwide.

The [[Brazilian Federal District|Federal District]], where Brasília is located, has a [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of R$ 89,630,109 (about US$ 69,844 billion), according to [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]. Its share of the total Brazilian [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] is about 3.8%.&lt;ref name=GDF&gt;.[http://www.distritofederal.df.gov.br/005/00502001.asp?ttCD_CHAVE=1273 Government's webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal District has the largest [[Gross domestic product|GDP per capita]] income of Brazil R$ 40.996,00 &lt;ref&gt;[[IBGE]] PIB 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (about US$ 27,610 per person, according to the IBGE, 2007 year). Brasília's ''per capita'' income is believed to be much higher.
{{wide image|Brasilia Panorama.jpg|1900px|''Eixo Monumental''.}}

===Accommodation===
The city's planned design included specific areas for almost everything, including [[Hotel|accommodation]], Hotels Sectors North and South. New hotel facilities are being developed elsewhere, such as the hotels and tourism Sector North, located on the shores of [[Lake Paranoá]]. Brasília has a range of tourist accommodation from inns, pensions and hostels to larger international chain hotels.

Brasília receives visitors from all of Brazil and the world, and offers a range of restaurants serving a variety of Brazilian regional and international food.

[[File:Brazilian Army Parade.jpeg|thumb|right|Independence Day parade along the Ministries Esplanade.]]
As a venue for political events, music performances and movie festivals, Brasília is a cosmopolitan city, with around 119 [[embassies]], a wide range of restaurants and complete infrastructure ready to host any kind of event. Not surprisingly, the city stands out as an important business tourism destination, which is an important part of the local economy, with dozens of hotels spread around the national capital. Traditional parties take place throughout the year. In June, there are large festivals celebrating Catholic saints, such as [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony]], Saint John, the Baptist, and [[Saint Peter]], that are called &quot;[[festa junina|festas juninas]],&quot; or June festival. On September 7, the traditional [[Brazilian Independence Day|Independence Day]] parade is held on the Ministries Esplanade. Throughout the year there are local, national and international events spread through the city. Christmas is widely celebrated, and [[New Years Eve]] usually hosts major events.

The city also hosts a varied assortment of art works from artists like [[Bruno Giorgi]], Alfredo Ceschiatti, [[Athos Bulcão]], Marianne Peretti, [[Alfredo Volpi]], [[Emiliano Di Cavalcanti|Di Cavalcanti]], Dyllan Taxman, [[Victor Brecheret]] and [[Burle Marx]], whose works have been integrated into the city's architecture, making it a unique landscape. The cuisine in the city is very diverse. Many of the best restaurants in the city can be found in the Asa Sul district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelbite.co.uk/destinations/city-guide/guides/what-do/what-do-in-brasilia-$447179.htm |title=Culture in Brasília |publisher=Travelbite.co.uk |date=2006-08-09 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brasília-21-04-2008.jpg|right|thumb|Ministries Esplanade on the [[Monumental Axis|Eixo Monumental]].]]

===Historic sites and museums===
====Eixo Monumental====
At the end of the [[Monumental Axis|Eixo Monumental]] lies the ''Esplanada dos Ministérios'' (&quot;Ministries Esplanade&quot;), an open area in downtown Brasília. The rectangular lawn is surrounded by two eight-lane avenues where many [[Government Buildings|government buildings]], monuments and memorials are located.

====National Congress====
[[File:National Congress of Brazil.jpg|right|thumb|[[National Congress of Brazil|The National Congress]] Building.]]
[[File:Palacio Alvorada commons.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palácio da Alvorada]].]]

Brazil's [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] consists of the [[Senate of Brazil|Senate]] (the upper house) and the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil]] (the lower house). Since the 1960s, the National Congress has its seat in Brasília. As with most of the official buildings in the city, it was designed by [[Oscar Niemeyer]] in the style of modern Brazilian architecture. The hemisphere to the left is the seat of the Senate and the hemisphere to the right is the seat of the Chamber of Deputies. Between them there are two towers of offices. The Congress also occupies other surrounding buildings, some connected by tunnels.

The building is located in the middle of the [[Monumental Axis|Eixo Monumental]], the main avenue of the capital. In front of it there is a large lawn and a reflecting pool. The building faces the [[Praça dos Três Poderes]], where the [[Palácio do Planalto]] and the [[Supremo Tribunal Federal]] are located.

====Palácio da Alvorada====
The [[Palácio da Alvorada]] is the official residence of the [[President of Brazil]]. The palace was designed, along with the rest of the city of Brasília, by [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and inaugurated in 1958.

One of the first structures built in the republic's new capital city, the &quot;Alvorada&quot; lies on a peninsula at the margins of [[Lake Paranoá]]. The principles of simplicity and modernity, that in the past characterized the great works of architecture, motivated Niemeyer. The viewer has an impression of looking at a glass box, softly landed on the ground with the support of thin external columns.

The building has an area of 7,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and three floors: basement, landing and second floor. The auditorium, kitchen, laundry, medical center, and the administration are at basement level. The rooms used by the presidency for official receptions are on the landing. There are four suites, two apartments and other private rooms on the second floor which is the residential part of the palace.

The building also has a library, a heated Olympic-sized swimming pool, a music room, two dining rooms and various meeting rooms. A chapel and heliport are in adjacent buildings.

====Palácio do Planalto====
[[File:Palacio do Planalto.jpeg|thumb|right|The [[Palácio do Planalto]].]]

The [[Palácio do Planalto]] is the official workplace of the [[President of Brazil]]. It is located at the [[Praça dos Três Poderes]] in Brasília. As the [[Politics of Brazil|seat of government]], the term &quot;O Planalto&quot; is often used as a [[metonym]] for the executive branch of government.

The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Palácio do Planalto. The President and his family do not live in it, rather in the official residence, the [[Palácio da Alvorada]]. Besides the President, senior advisors also have offices in the &quot;Planalto,&quot; including the [[Vice-President of Brazil]] and the [[Chief of Staff of Brazil|Chief of Staff]]. The other Ministries are along the [[Monumental Axis|Esplanada dos Ministérios]].

The architect of the Palácio do Planalto was [[Oscar Niemeyer]], creator of most of the important buildings in Brasília. The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures.

The Palace is four stories high, and has an area of 36,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex.

====Complexo Cultural da República====
[[File:Complexo Cultural da Republica 01.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Cultural Complex of the Republic]].]]
The [[Cultural Complex of the Republic|Complexo Cultural da República]] (Portuguese for Cultural Complex of the Republic) is formed by the [[National library|National Library]] of Brasília and the National Museum of the Republic. It is situated in the Eixo Monumental, next to the Cathedral of Brasília.

The National Library of Brasília (''Biblioteca Nacional de Brasília'' in Portuguese) occupies an area of 14,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, consisting of reading and study rooms, auditorium and a collection of over 300,000 items.

The National Museum of the Republic (''Museu Nacional da República'' in Portuguese) consists of a 14,500&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; exhibit area, two 780-seat auditoriums, and a laboratory. The space is mainly used to display temporary art exhibits.

====Paranoá Lake====
[[Lake Paranoá|Paranoá Lake]] is a large artificial lake built to increase the amount of water available to the region. It has the second largest marina in Brazil, and hosts wakeboarders and windsurfers.

====Juscelino Kubitschek bridge====
[[File:BSB Ponte JK Helicoptero 02 2006 79 8x6.JPG|right|thumb|The [[Juscelino Kubitschek bridge|Juscelino Kubitschek Bridge]].]]
The [[Juscelino Kubitschek bridge]], also known as the 'President JK Bridge' or the 'JK Bridge', crosses [[Lake Paranoá]] in Brasília. It is named after [[Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira]], former [[president of Brazil]]. It was designed by architect Alexandre Chan and [[structural engineer]] Mário Vila Verde. Chan won the [[Gustav Lindenthal]] Medal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eswp.com/bridge/awards.htm |title=Bridge Awards |publisher=Eswp.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; for this project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] due to &quot;...outstanding achievement demonstrating harmony with the environment, aesthetic merit and successful community participation&quot;.

It consists of three {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}} tall asymmetrical steel arches that crisscross diagonally. With a length of 1,200&amp;nbsp;m (0.75 miles), it was completed in 2002 at a cost of US$ 56.8 million. The bridge has a pedestrian walkway and is accessible to bicyclists and skaters.

====Praça dos Três Poderes====
[[File:Supremo Tribunal.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Supreme Federal Tribunal]] at the Praça dos Três Poderes.]]
''[[Praça dos Três Poderes]]'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''Square of the Three Powers'') is a plaza in Brasília. The name is derived from the encounter of the three federal branches around the plaza: the [[Executive (government)|Executive]], represented by the [[Palácio do Planalto]] (presidential office); the [[Legislature|Legislative]], represented by the [[National Congress of Brazil|Congresso Nacional]] (National Congress); and the Judicial branch, represented by the [[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Supremo Tribunal Federal]] (Supreme Federal Court).

It is a tourist attraction in Brasília, designed by [[Lucio Costa|Lúcio Costa]] and [[Oscar Niemeyer]] as a place where the three branches would meet harmoniously.

====Cathedral of Brasília====
The [[Cathedral of Brasília]] in the capital of the Federative Republic of Brazil, is an expression of the architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]]. This concrete-framed [[hyperboloid structure]], seems with its glass roof reaching up, open, to the heavens. On 31 May 1970, the Cathedral’s structure was finished, and only the {{convert|70|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} diameter of the circular area were visible. Niemeyer's project of Cathedral of Brasília is based in the [[hyperboloid]] of revolution which sections are asymmetric. The hyperboloid structure itself is a result of 16 identical assembled concrete columns. These columns, having hyperbolic section and weighing 90 t, represent two hands moving upwards to heaven. The Cathedral was dedicated on 31 May 1970.

===Popular culture===
[[File:Dom Bosco Brasilia.jpg|right|thumb|Don Bosco Sanctuary in Brasília.]]
Brasília has also been the focus of modern day literature. Published in 2008, ''The World In Grey: Dom Bosco's Prophecy'', by author Ryan J. Lucero, tells an apocalyptic story based on the famous prophecy from the late 19th century by the Italian saint [[John Bosco|Don Bosco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infobrasilia.com.br/bsb_h1p.htm |title=Dom Bosco - Brasília |publisher=Infobrasilia.com.br |date=1965-04-21 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Don Bosco's prophecy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/ginasant/3383018251/ |title=Dom Bosco - Brasília |publisher=Flickr.com |date=2009-03-24 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Between parallels [[15th parallel south|15]] and [[20th parallel south|20]], around a lake which shall be formed; A great civilization will thrive, and that will be the Promised Land.}}

Brasília lies between the parallels 15° S and 20° S, where an artificial lake ([[Lake Paranoá|Paranoá Lake]]) was formed. Don Bosco is Brasília's [[patron saint]].

''[[American Flagg!]]'', the [[First Comics]] comic book series created by [[Howard Chaykin]], portrays Brasilia as a cosmopolitan world capital of culture and exotic romance. In the series, it is a top vacation and party destination.

==Transportation==
===International Airport===
[[File:Aeroporto de Brasilia.JPG|thumb|[[Brasília International Airport|Brasília International Airport (BSB)]].]]
[[Brasília International Airport]] - President Juscelino Kubitschek serves the metropolitan area with major domestic and international flights. It is the third busiest [[Brazil]]ian airport based on passengers and aircraft movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;pax&quot;/&gt; Because of its strategic location it is a civil aviation hub for the rest of the country. This makes for a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in the holding pattern before landing. Following the airport's master plan, [[Infraero]] built a second runway, which was finished in 2006. In 2007, the airport handled 11,119,872 passengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;pax&quot;&gt;Airport Statistics for 2007 http://www.infraero.gov.br/upload/arquivos/movi/mov.operac.1207.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The main building's third floor, with 12 thousand [[square metre|square meters]], has a panoramic deck, a food court, shops, four movie theaters with total capacity of 500 people, and space for exhibitions. There are 136 shop spaces at Brasília Airport.

The airport is located about 11&amp;nbsp;km (6.8&amp;nbsp;mi) from the central area of Brasília, outside the metro system. There are many taxis outside the main gate, and some bus lines which connect the airport to the central area of Brasília. The parking lot accommodates 1,200 cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutbrasilia.com/travel/airport.html |title=Brasilia International Airport - facts |publisher=Aboutbrasilia.com |date=2007-01-04 |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to domestic and regional services (TAM, GOL, Azul, WebJET, Trip and Avianca).
Brasilia is improving its international connections; non-stop flights to [[Miami]], [[United States]] with AA started in Nov 2010 and with TAM in Dec 2010. There are already direct flights to [[Atlanta]], [[United States]] with Delta; [[Lima]], [[Peru]] with LAN and TACA ; and to [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] with TAP. On March 28, 2011 [[PLUNA]] will begin direct service to [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], and connections and on June 18 [[Copa Airlines]] will begin direct service to [[Panama City]], [[Panama]] increasing and improving connections to the rest of the American continent through the company's Hub of the Americas at [[Tocumen International Airport]].

===Metro===
{{Main|Brasília Metro}}
[[File:Metro DF Galeria.jpg|thumb|right|Galeria Metro Station.]]
[[Brasília Metro|Metrô de Brasília]] is Brasília's underground [[Rapid transit|metro system]]. The subway system has 24 stations on two lines, the Orange and Green lines, distributed along a total network of {{convert|42|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}}, covering most of the metropolitan area. Both lines begin at the Central Station and run parallel until the Águas Claras Station. The Brasília metro is not comprehensive, so buses may provide better access to the city center. The metro leaves the Rodoviária (bus station) and goes south, avoiding most of the political and tourist areas. The main purpose of the metro is to serve the largest satellite cities, such as Samambaia, [[Taguatinga (Federal District)|Taguatinga]] and [[Ceilândia]], as well as Guará and Águas Claras. The satellite cities are more populated than the Plano Piloto itself (the census of 2000 indicated that [[Ceilândia]] had 344,039 inhabitants, Taguatinga had 243,575, whereas the Plano Piloto had approximately 400,000 inhabitants), and most residents of the satellite cities depend on public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metro.df.gov.br/ Brasília Metro]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buses===
[[File:Onibus distrito federal.jpg|thumb|Buses in Brasília.]]
The main bus hub in Brasília is the Central Bus Station, located in the crossing of the [[Monumental Axis|Eixo Monumental]] and the Eixão, about {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from the Three Powers Plaza. The original plan was to have a bus station as near as possible to every corner of Brasília. Today, the bus station is the hub of urban buses only, some running within Brasília and others connecting Brasília to the satellite cities. In the original city plan, the interstate buses should also stop at the Central Station. Because of the growth of Brasília (and corresponding growth in the bus fleet), today the interstate buses leave from the older interstate station (called Rodoferroviária), located at the western end of the Eixo Monumental. The Central Bus Station also contains a main metro station.

A new inter-state station was opened in July 2010. It is on Saída Sul (South Exit) near Parkshopping and a metro station.

[[File:Blue Streak.JPG||thumb|right|300px|Blue Streak at the ''Deutsches Museum'', Schleissheim, [[Munich]]]]The '''Blue Streak missile''' was a British intermediate range [[ballistic missile]] (IRBM) designed in 1955.  The project was begun in 1955 to ensure that there was a credible replacement for the [[V Bomber]] planes which would become obsolete by 1965. The ballistic missile programme was cancelled in 1960, however, to avoid costly cancellation payments to the Australian government and contracted companies involved the rocket was used as the first-stage of the European satellite launcher [[Europa rocket|Europa]]. Tested at [[Woomera, South Australia|Woomera test range]], Australia, the Blue Streak project was finally cancelled in 1972.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Background==
Post-[[World War II|war]] Britain's [[nuclear weapon]]s armament was initially based on free-fall bombs delivered by the [[V bomber]] force. It soon became clear that if Britain wanted to have a credible threat, a ballistic missile was essential. There was a political need for an independent deterrent, so that Britain could remain a major world power. Britain was unable to purchase American weapons wholesale due to the restrictions of the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]].

In April 1954 the Americans proposed a joint development programme for ballistic missiles. The United States would develop an [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM) of 5,000 [[nautical mile]] (9,300&amp;nbsp;km) range, while the United Kingdom with United States support would develop a [[medium-range ballistic missile]] (MRBM) of 2,000 nautical mile (3,700&amp;nbsp;km) range. The proposal was accepted as part of the [[Wilson-Sandys Agreement]] of August 1954, which provided for collaboration, exchange of information, and mutual planning of development programmes. The decision to develop was influenced by what could be learnt about missile design and development in the US. Initial requirements for the booster were made by the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] at [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]] with input on the rocket engine design from the [[Rocket Propulsion Establishment]] at [[Westcott, Buckinghamshire|Westcott]]. British Operational Requirement 1139 demanded a rocket of at least 1500 n.m. and the initially proposed rocket would have just reached that threshold.

[[De Havilland]] won the contract to build the missile, which was to be powered by an uprated liquid-fuelled [[Rocketdyne]] S3D engine, developed by [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]], called [[RZ2]]. Two variants of this engine were developed: the first provided a static thrust of {{convert|137000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}} and the second (intended for the three stage satellite launch vehicle) {{convert|150000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}}. The engines were unique at that time in that they could be vectored by seven degrees in flight and could therefore be used to guide the vehicle. This configuration, however, put considerable pressure on the autopilot which had to cope with the problem of a vehicle whose weight was diminishing rapidly and that was steered by large engines whose thrust remained more or less constant. The vibration was also a problem, particularly at engine cut-off, and the later development of the autopilot for the satellite launcher was, in itself, a considerable achievement.

Subcontractors included the [[Sperry Gyroscope Company]] who produced the guidance system whilst the warhead itself was designed by the [[Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] at [[Aldermaston]].

Doubts arose as the cost escalated from the first tentative figure of £50m submitted to the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] in early 1955, to £300m in late 1959. Its detractors in the civil service claimed that the programme was crawling along when compared with the speed of development in the US and the [[Soviet Union]]. {{Citation needed|reason=However considering the low base which Britain had started from the speed of the programme and its cost effectiveness were far greater than in any other nuclear nation.|date=September 2009}} Estimates within the Civil Service for completion of the project ranged from a total spend of £550 Million to £1,300 Million, as different ministers were set on either abandoning or continuing the project.

==Cancellation==
Eventually the project was cancelled in 1960- although debates had been ongoing within government since 1958. Some{{Who|date=May 2010}} considered the cancellation of Blue Streak to be not only a blow to British military-industrial efforts, but also to [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] ally Australia, which had its own vested interest in the project.

The missiles used liquid oxygen and kerosene propellants. Whilst the vehicle could be left fully laden with 20+ tonnes of kerosene, the 60 tonnes of liquid oxygen had to be loaded immediately before launch or icing became a problem. Due to this, fuelling the rocket took 4.5 minutes, which would have made it useless as a rapid response to an attack. The missile was vulnerable to a pre-emptive attack, launched without warning or in the absence of any heightening of tension sufficient to warrant readying the missile, if such a circumstance were ever likely. To negate this problem DeHavilland created a stand-by feature. A missile could be held at 30 seconds for 10 hours. As the missiles were to be deployed in pairs and it took 10 hours for one missile to be prepared for stand-by one of the two missiles could always be ready for rapid launch.

To protect the missiles against a pre-emptive strike while being fuelled, the idea of siting the missiles in underground [[Missile silo|silos]] was developed. These would have been designed to withstand a one [[megaton]] blast at a distance of half a mile (800 m) and were a British innovation, subsequently exported to the US. However, finding sites for these silos proved extremely difficult and [[RAF Spadeadam]] in [[Cumbria]] was the only site where construction was undertaken. This was also the site where the RZ2 rocket engines and also the complete Blue Streak missile were tested. The best sites for silo construction were the more stable rock strata in parts of southern England, but the construction of many underground silos in the countryside carried enormous economic, social, and political cost.

As no site in Britain provided enough space for test flights, a test site was established at [[Woomera, South Australia]]. Whitehall opposition to the project grew, and it was eventually cancelled on the ostensible grounds that it would be too vulnerable to a first-strike attack. [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Admiral of the Fleet Lord Mountbatten of Burma]] had spent considerable effort arguing that the project should be cancelled at once in favour of his Navy being armed with nuclear weapons, capable of pre-emptive strike.

The British government transferred its hopes to the Anglo-American [[Skybolt missile]], before the project's cancellation by the USA as its ICBM program reached maturity. The British instead purchased the [[Polaris missile|Polaris]] system from the Americans, carried in British-built [[submarine]]s.

==Civilian programme==
After the cancellation as a military project, there was reluctance to cancel the project because of the huge cost incurred. Blue Streak would have become the first stage of a projected all British satellite launcher known as &quot;[[Black Prince (rocket)|Black Prince]]&quot;: the second stage was derived from the ''[[Black Knight (rocket)|Black Knight]]'' test vehicle, and the orbital injection stage was a small hydrogen peroxide/kerosene motor. This launcher never progressed beyond the design stage.

This also proved too expensive, and the [[European Launcher Development Organisation]] (ELDO) was set up. This used Blue Streak as the first stage, with French and German second and third stages. The Blue Streak first stage was successfully tested three times at the [[Woomera Prohibited Area|Woomera test range]] in Australia as part of the ELDO programme.

Although a total of eight launches were made of the multi-stage vehicle, the French and German components proved unreliable leading to the project's final cancellation, and the end of Blue Streak. The final launch was made at the French site of [[Kourou]] in [[French Guiana]].

The full launch history of Blue Streak is as follows,

A range of proposals was made between 1957 and 1972 for a [[launch vehicle|carrier rocket]] based on Blue Streak.,&lt;ref name=p117&gt;Hill, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; however, none of these were ever built in full and today only exist in design. The Blue Streak was eventually tested as the first stage of the [[Europa rocket]], designed by the [[European Launcher Development Organisation]],&lt;ref name=p153&gt;Hill, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; although this too ended in failure due to lack of funds, despite the fact that Blue Streak itself worked almost perfectly.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Most, although not all, designs were based on using Blue Streak as a first stage, and a usually modified [[Black Knight (rocket)|Black Knight]] as a second stage.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Royal Aircraft Establishment proposals===
==== 1957 proposal ====
In 1957 a carrier rocket based on a combination of Blue Streak and Black Knight was proposed by Desmond King Hele and Doreen Gilmour of the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]]. This was at a time before either rocket had even been tested.&lt;ref name=p117/&gt; Payloads were estimated to be around 1,034 [[kilogram|kg]] (2,280 [[pound (mass)|lb]]) to a 370&amp;nbsp;km (200 [[nautical mile|nmi]]) orbit and 960&amp;nbsp;kg (2,117&amp;nbsp;lb) to a 740&amp;nbsp;km (400 nmi) orbit. However, the design was considered to be inefficient and difficult because of the large differences in the diameters of the 3 metre (10 [[foot (length)|foot]]) wide Blue Streak and the metre-wide (3&amp;nbsp;feet) Black Knight. Fitting satellites into a three foot [[payload fairing]] could also have been a challenge.&lt;ref name=p118&gt;Hill, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, these difficulties were also encountered with successful American rockets including the [[Thor rocket|Thor]] and [[Atlas rocket|Atlas]].&lt;ref name=p119&gt;Hill, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

====1972 proposal====
In 1972, RAE suggested using Blue Streak as the first stage of a [[two-stage to orbit]] rocket, with an American [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] upper stage. The Centaur second stage would have either been built in the UK under licence or imported directly from the USA. Both the Centaur and Blue Streak had proved to be very reliable up to this point, and since they were both already designed development costs would have been low. Furthermore, it had a payload of 870–920&amp;nbsp;kg to a [[geosynchronous]] orbit with, and 650–700&amp;nbsp;kg without the use of additional booster rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Hill | first = Nicholas | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Blue Streak With Centaur Upper Stage | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.spaceuk.org/bstreak/bs/bs_centaur.html | format = | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===De Havilland/British Interplanetary Society proposal===
In 1959 de Havilland suggested solving the problem of the Blue Streak/Black Knight geometry by compressing the 10 by 1 metre (30 by 3 foot) Black Knight into a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-diameter}} sphere. Although this seemed logical, the development costs proved to be too high for the limited budget of the programme.&lt;ref name=p119/&gt;

===Saunders Roe proposals===
==== Black Prince ====
In 1959, a year before the cancellation of the Blue Streak as a missile, the government requested that the RAE and [[Saunders Roe]] design a carrier rocket based on Blue Streak and Black Knight. This design used Blue Streak as a first stage and a 54&amp;nbsp;inch (137 centimetre) second stage based on the Black Knight.&lt;ref name=p124&gt;Hill, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Several different third stages would be available, depending on the required payload and orbit. Examples of orbits suggested by Saunders Roe and the RAE were a 556&amp;nbsp;km (300 nmi) orbit for 'experiments in stellar UV spectroscopy', a 556-1,296&amp;nbsp;km (300-700 nmi) orbit for 'enabling investigations of the Earth's radiation belts,' and a 556-185,200&amp;nbsp;km (300-100,000 nmi) orbit for a 'Space probe.'&lt;ref name=p125&gt;Hill, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

There were some problems with the design, however. The relative power of the rocket reduced with altitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Hill, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; The solution requested by the government and provided by Saunders Roe was to use a high-energy cryogenic upper stage which would increase the payload to 408&amp;nbsp;kg (900&amp;nbsp;lb) to a 9,260&amp;nbsp;km (5,000 nmi) orbit, and 272&amp;nbsp;kg (600&amp;nbsp;lb) to a 16,670&amp;nbsp;km (9,000 nmi) orbit. The cost of developing the upper stage stage was estimated to be [[pound sterling|£]]5-7 million.&lt;ref name=p130&gt;Hill, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

It was planned that Black Prince would be a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] project. However, since the government of [[John Diefenbaker]] in Canada was already spending more money than publicly acknowledged on [[Alouette 1|Alouette]] and Australia was not interested in the project, these two countries were unwilling to contribute. South Africa was no longer a member of the Commonwealth. New Zealand was only likely to make &quot;modest&quot; contributions.&lt;ref name=p126&gt;Hill, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

France, however, showed an interest, although they were suspected of trying to gain technical information for their own missile programmes.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; Despite this, Saunders Roe continued to design new configurations even after the formal cancellation of the Black Prince programme.&lt;ref name=p130/&gt;

====SLAVE====
Saunders Roe later proposed a design where Blue Streak would form the first stage, the second stage would be a slightly stretched version of the second stage used on the [[Black Arrow]] rocket, and the third stage would be a [[Waxwing (Rocket motor)|Waxwing]] [[solid rocket|solid motor]], which was also used on [[Black Arrow]]. It would have been capable of putting around 1360&amp;nbsp;kg (3000&amp;nbsp;lb) into [[low Earth orbit]] and a few hundred kilograms into a [[geostationary orbit]]. It is thought that Saunders Roe were considering communications satellites as a possible payload for this rocket, since they designed a pair of solid motors under the payload that would be able to accurately place a satellite in the correct geostationary orbit. They believed such a rocket would be a success since access to both Russian and American rockets was restricted.&lt;ref name=p123&gt;Hill, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=p220&gt;Hill, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was known as '''S'''atellite '''LA'''unch '''VE'''hicle, or SLAVE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceuk.org/ba/siddeley.htm SpaceUK - The Alternative Black Arrow]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blue Streak today==
Following the cancellation of the Blue Streak project some of the remaining rockets were preserved at:

* The [[National Space Centre]] in [[Leicester]], England.
* The [[Deutsches Museum]] at [[Oberschleißheim]] near [[Munich]]
* The [[National Museum of Flight]] in [[East Fortune]], Scotland.
* The [[Euro Space Center]] in [[Redu]], Belgium.
* The [[Museum of Flight (Scotland)]], Scotland

A section of the propulsion bay, engines and equipment can be found at the [http://www.solway-aviation-museum.co.uk Solway Aviation Museum], Carlisle Airport. Only a few miles from the Spadeadam testing site, the museum carries many exhibits, photographs and models of the Blue Streak programme having inherited the original Spadeadam collection that used to be displayed on site.  

An [[RZ2]] engine is on display at [[Armagh Planetarium]], [[Northern Ireland]] and The [[Euro Space Center]] in [[Redu]], Belgium.

Footage from the Blue Streak launch was briefly incorporated into ''[[The Prisoner]]'s'' final episode, &quot;[[Fall Out (The Prisoner)|Fall Out]]&quot;. A part of the Blue Streak rocket launched on June 5, 1964 from [[Woomera, South Australia|Woomera]],  Australia, found 50&amp;nbsp;km SE of Giles in 1980 is on display at [[Giles Weather Station]]. Another piece was located in 2006 but its exact location has been kept secret by the finders. The titanium structure of a German third stage was, for some time, sited on the edge of a gravel pit in Gloucestershire.

[[File:Un-bakassi.png|thumb]]
'''Bakassi''' is the [[peninsula]]r extension of the [[Africa]]n territory of [[Calabar]] into the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is currently ruled by [[Cameroon]] following the transfer of sovereignty from neighbouring [[Nigeria]] as a result of a judgment by the [[International Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/94/7453.pdf The Land and Maritime Boundary Between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria: Equatorial Guinea intervening)], Judgment, ICJ Reports 2002, p.303&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 November 2007, the Nigerian Senate rejected the transfer, since the [[Green Tree Agreement]] ceding the area to Cameroon was contrary to Section 12(1) of the 1999 Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rosenne's the World Court: What it is and how it Works |author= Terry D.

==Geography and economy==
The peninsula lies roughly between latitudes 4°25' and 5°10'N and longitudes 8°20' and 9°08'E . It consists of a number of low-lying, largely mangrove covered islands covering an area of around 665&amp;nbsp;km²(257&amp;nbsp;sq;&amp;nbsp;mi). The population of Bakassi is the subject of some dispute, but is generally put at between 150,000 and 300,000 people. 

Bakassi is situated at the extreme eastern end of the [[Gulf of Guinea]], where the warm east-flowing [[Guinea Current]] (called Aya Efiat in [[Efik language|Efik]]) meets the cold north-flowing [[Benguela Current]] (called Aya Ubenekang in [[Efik language|Efik]]). These two great ocean currents interact creating huge foamy breakers which constantly advance towards the shore, and building submarine shoals rich in [[fish]], [[shrimp]]s, and an amazing variety of other marine life forms.  This makes the Bakassi area a very fertile fishing ground, comparable only to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in North America and [[Scandinavia]] in Western Europe. Most of the population make their living through fishing.

The peninsula is commonly described as &quot;oil-rich&quot;, though in fact no commercially viable deposits of oil have yet been discovered. However, the area has aroused considerable interest from oil companies in the light of the discovery of rich reserves of high grade [[crude oil]] elsewhere in Nigeria. At least eight multinational oil companies have participated in the exploration of the peninsula and its offshore waters.

==History==
During the European scramble for Africa, Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] signed a Treaty of Protection with the King and Chiefs of [[Akwa Akpa]], known to Europeans as &quot;Old Calabar&quot;, on 10 September 1884. This enabled the [[United Kingdom]] to exercise control over the entire territory around Calabar, including Bakassi. The territory subsequently became ''de facto'' part of the republic of Nigeria, although the border was never permanently delineated.  However, documents released by the Cameroonians, in parity with that of the British and Germans, clearly places Bakassi under Cameroonian Territory as a consequence of colonial era Anglo-German agreements. Interestingly, even after [[Southern Cameroons]] voted in 1961 to leave Nigeria and became a part of Cameroon, Bakassi remained under [[Calabar]] administration in Nigeria until ICJ judgement of 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omoigui.com/files/the_bakassi_story.pdf The Bakassi Story]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bakassi People==
'''Bakassi people''' are mainly the [[Calabar]] people, the people of [[Cross River State]] and [[Akwa Ibom State]] of Nigeria, including the Efut, [[Efik people|Efik]], [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]], [[Annang]], etc.

==Political status==
Bakassi is currently administered by [[Cameroon]] after the end of  Nigerian control.

===Territorial dispute===
Nigeria and Cameroon have disputed the possession of Bakassi for some years, leading to considerable tension between the two countries. In 1981 the two countries went to the brink of war over Bakassi and another area around [[Lake Chad]], at the other end of the two countries' common border. More armed clashes broke out in the early 1990s. In response, Cameroon took the matter to the [[International Court of Justice]] on 29 March 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nigerdeltacongress.com/earticles/equatorial_guinea_and_the_bakass.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was extremely complex, requiring the court to review diplomatic exchanges dating back over 100 years. Nigeria relied largely on Anglo-German correspondence dating from 1885 as well as treaties between the colonial powers and the indigenous rulers in the area, particularly the 1884 Treaty of Protection. Cameroon pointed to the Anglo-German treaty of 1913, which defined spheres of control in the region, as well as two agreements signed in the 1970s between Cameroon and Nigeria. These were the Yaoundé II Declaration of 4 April 1971 and the Maroua Declaration of 1 June 1975, which were devised to outline [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]] between the two countries following their independence. The line was drawn through the Cross River estuary to the west of the peninsula, thereby implying Cameroonian ownership over Bakassi. However, Nigeria never ratified the agreement, while Cameroon regarded it as being in force.

===ICJ verdict===
The ICJ delivered its judgment on 10 October 2002, finding (based principally on the Anglo-German agreements) that sovereignty over Bakassi did indeed rest with Cameroon. It instructed Nigeria to transfer possession of the peninsula, but did not require the inhabitants to move or to change their nationality. Cameroon was thus given a substantial Nigerian population and was required to protect their rights, infrastructure and welfare.&lt;ref&gt;http://nigeriaworld.com/articles/2002/dec/273.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The verdict caused consternation in Nigeria. It aroused vitriolic comments from Nigerian officials and the Nigerian media alike. Chief [[Richard Akinjide]], a former Nigerian Attorney-General and Minister of Justice who had been a leading member of Nigeria's legal team, described the decision as &quot;50% international law and 50% international politics&quot;, &quot;blatantly biased and unfair&quot;, &quot;a total disaster&quot;, and a &quot;complete fraud&quot;. The Nigerian newspaper ''[[The Guardian (Nigeria)|The Guardian]]'' went further, declaring that the judgment was &quot;a rape and unforeseen potential international conspiracy against Nigerian territorial integrity and sovereignty&quot; and &quot;part of a Western ploy to foment and perpetuate trouble in Africa&quot;. The outcome of the controversy was a ''de facto'' Nigerian refusal to withdraw its troops from Bakassi and transfer sovereignty. The Nigerian government did not, however, openly reject the judgment but instead called for an agreement that would provide &quot;peace with honour, with the interest and welfare of our people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisdayonline.com/archive/2002/10/30/20021030news03.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICJ judgment was backed up by the [[United Nations]], whose charter potentially allowed sanctions or even the use of force to enforce the court's ruling. [[Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] stepped in as a mediator and chaired a tripartite summit with the two countries' presidents on 15 November 2002, which established a commission to facilitate the peaceful implementation of the ICJ's judgement. A further summit was held on 31 January 2004. This has made significant progress, but the process has been complicated by the opposition of Bakassi's inhabitants to being transferred to Cameroon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wwenglish.com/en/voa/stan/2006/08/2006080813544.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakassian leaders threatened to seek independence if Nigeria renounced sovereignty. This [[secession]] was announced on 9 July 2006, as the &quot;[[Democratic Republic of Bakassi]]&quot;. The decision was reportedly made at a meeting on 2 July 2006 and ''The Vanguard'' [[newspaper]] of Nigeria reported the decision to secede. The decision was reportedly made by groups of militants including [[Southern Cameroons]] under the aegis of [[Southern Cameroons Peoples Organisation]] (SCAPO), [[Bakassi Movement for Self-Determination]] (BAMOSD), and the [[Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta]] (MEND).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.postnewsline.com/2008/07/rebels-declare.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resolution===
On 13 June 2006, President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] of Nigeria and President [[Paul Biya]] of Cameroon resolved the dispute in talks led by UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] in [[New York City]]. Obasanjo agreed to withdraw Nigerian troops within 60 days and to leave the territory completely in Cameroonian control within the next two years. Annan said, &quot;With today's agreement on the Bakassi peninsula, a comprehensive resolution of the dispute is within our grasp. The momentum achieved must be sustained.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200606130612.html allAfrica.com: Cameroon: Presidents Obasanjo And Biya Shake Hands On Disputed Bakassi Peninsula (Page 1 of 1)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Withdrawal===
Nigeria began to withdraw its forces, comprising some 3,000 troops, beginning 1 August 2006, and a ceremony on 14 August marked the formal handover of the northern part of the peninsula. The remainder stayed under Nigerian civil authority for two more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4789647.stm | work=BBC News | title=Nigeria hands Bakassi to Cameroon | date=14 August 2006 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 22, 2007, the [[Senate of Nigeria|Nigerian Senate]] passed a resolution declaring that the withdrawal from the Bakassi Peninsula was illegal. The government took no action, and handed the final parts of Bakassi over to Cameroon on 14 August 2008 as planned, but a Federal High Court had stated this should be delayed until all accommodations for resettled Bakassians had been settled; the government did not seem to plan to heed this court order,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7537020.stm | work=BBC News | title=Nigeria to appeal Bakassi delay | date=1 August 2008 | accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did set the necessary mechanisms into motion to override it. Fishermen displaced from Bakassi had been settled in a landlocked area called [[New Bakassi]], which they claimed is already inhabited and not suitable for fishermen like them but only for farmers.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90855/6464970.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bestiary''', or '''Bestiarum vocabulum''' is a [[compendium]] of beasts. Bestiaries were made popular in the [[Middle Ages]] in illustrated volumes that described various animals, birds and even rocks. The [[natural history]] and illustration of each beast was usually accompanied by a moral lesson. This reflected the belief that the world itself was the Word of God, and that every living thing had its own special meaning. For example, the [[pelican]], which was believed to tear open its breast to bring its young to life with its own blood, was a living representation of [[Jesus]]. The bestiary, then, is also a reference to the [[symbol]]ic language of [[animals in Christian art|animals in Western Christian art]] and literature.

Bestiaries were particularly popular in [[England]] and [[France]] around the 12th century and were mainly compilations of earlier texts. The earliest bestiary in the form in which it was later popularized was an anonymous 2nd century [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] volume called the ''[[Physiologus]]'', which itself summarized ancient knowledge and wisdom about animals in the writings of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] authors such as [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[History of Animals|Historia Animalium]]'' and various works by [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Solinus]], [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] and other naturalists.

Following the ''Physiologus'', Saint [[Isidore of Seville]] (Book XII of the ''[[Etymologiae]]'') and [[Saint Ambrose]] expanded the religious message with reference to passages from the [[Bible]] and the [[Septuagint]]. They and other authors freely expanded or modified pre-existing models, constantly refining the moral content without interest or access to much more detail regarding the factual content. Nevertheless, the often fanciful accounts of these beasts were widely read and generally believed to be true. A few observations found in bestiaries, such as the [[Bird migration|migration]] of birds, were discounted by the natural philosophers of later centuries, only to be rediscovered in the modern scientific era.

Two illuminated [[Psalter]]s, the [[Queen Mary Psalter]] ([[British Library]] Ms. Royal 2B, vii) and the [[Isabella Psalter]] (State Library, [[Munich]]), contain full Bestiary cycles. The bestiary in the Queen Mary Psalter is found in the &quot;marginal&quot; decorations that occupy about the bottom quarter of the page, and are unusually extensive and coherent in this work.  In fact the bestiary has been expanded beyond the source in the Norman bestiary of Guillaume le Clerc to ninety animals.  Some are placed in the text to make correspondences with the [[psalm]] they are illustrating. &lt;ref&gt; The Queen Mary psalter: a study of affect and audience By Anne Rudloff Stanton, p44ff, Diane Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;    

The Italian artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] also made his own bestiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Selections from the Bestiary of Leonardo Da Vinci | first1=Oliver |last1=Evans |journal=The Journal of American Folklore |volume=64 |number=254 |date=Oct. - Dec., 1951 |pages=393–396 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/537007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aberdeen Bestiary]] is one of the best known of over 50 manuscript bestiaries surviving today. 

Mediaeval bestiaries are remarkably similar in sequence of the animals of which they treat.

==Modern Bestiaries==
In modern times, artists such as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Saul Steinberg]] have produced their own bestiaries. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] wrote a contemporary bestiary of sorts, the [[Book of Imaginary Beings]], which collects imaginary beasts from bestiaries and fiction. Nicholas Christopher wrote a literary novel called &quot;The Bestiary&quot; (Dial, 2007) that describes a lonely young man's efforts to track down the world's most complete bestiary. [[John Henry Fleming]]'s ''Fearsome Creatures of Florida''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fearsomecreatures.com Fearsomecreatures.com]&lt;/ref&gt; (Pocol Press, 2009) borrows from the medieval bestiary tradition to impart moral lessons about the environment.  Writers of [[Fantasy]] fiction draw heavily from the fanciful beasts described in [[mythology]], [[fairy tales]], and bestiaries. The &quot;worlds&quot; created in Fantasy fiction can be said to have their own bestiaries. Similarly, authors of fantasy [[role-playing game]]s sometimes compile bestiaries as references, such as the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' for ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''. It is not uncommon for video games with a large variety of enemies (especially [[role-playing video game]]s) to include a bestiary of sorts. This usually takes the form of a list of enemies and a short description (e.g. the ''[[Metroid Prime]]'' and ''[[Castlevania]]'' games, as well as'' [[Dark Cloud]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy]]'').

'''&quot;The Ballad Of The Green Berets&quot;''' is a patriotic song in the [[ballad (music)|ballad]] style about the [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Berets]], an elite [[Special Operations Forces|special force]] in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. It is one of the very few songs of the 1960s to cast the military in a positive light, yet it became a major hit, reaching No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' charts for five weeks in 1966. It was also a crossover smash, reaching No. 1 on ''Billboard's'' Easy Listening chart and No. 2 on ''Billboard's'' Country survey.

The song was written by [[Robin Moore]] and [[Staff Sergeant|Staff Sgt.]] [[Barry Sadler]], while the latter was recuperating from a leg wound suffered as a medic in the [[Vietnam War]]. Moore also wrote a [[non-fiction]] book, ''[[The Green Berets (book)|The Green Berets]]'', about the force. Lyrics include:

&quot;Back at home a young wife waits/
Her Green Beret has met his fate/
He has died for those oppressed/
Leaving her this last request

Put silver wings on my son's chest/
Make him one of America's best/
He'll be a man they'll test one day/
Have him win the Green Beret&quot;

The lyrics were written in honor of Green Beret James Gabriel, Jr., the first [[Native Hawaiian]] who died in Vietnam, who was executed by the Viet Cong while on a training mission on April 8, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Mizutani | first=Ron | title=First Native Hawaiian Killed in Vietnam Conflict Honored | date=May 18, 2010 | work=KHON2.com | publisher=[[KHON-TV]] | url=http://www.khon2.com/content/news/developingstories/story/First-Native-Hawaiian-Killed-in-Vietnam-Conflict/iSrtWYe-DEmrkW4dYH_m2Q.cspx | accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One verse was written in honor of Gabriel, but it never made it into the final version.  See Sadler's book I'm a Lucky One (Macmillan 1967, pp. 80-81).

Sadler debuted the song on television on January 30, 1966 on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.

==Popularity==
The song was the No. 1 hit in the U.S. for five weeks in 1966, and was the No. 21 song of 1960s, despite [[United States Army Special Forces in popular culture|the later unpopularity of the Vietnam War]]. It has sold over nine million singles and albums. It was the top single of a year in which the [[British Invasion]], led by [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]], dominated the U.S. charts. The charts were &quot;dominated&quot; by soul and surfer music. The Beatles' top hit was We Can Work It Out (#16), the Stones' top hit was [[Paint It, Black]] (#21). See Billboard charts. 

It is currently used as one of the four primary [[marching band|marching tunes]] of the [[Fightin' Texas Aggie Band]].

==In film==
The song is heard in a choral rendition by [[Ken Darby]] in the 1968 [[John Wayne]] film, ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'', based on Moore's book. The score of the movie was never released as an album until ''[[Film Score Monthly]]'' released it in 2005.  A film [[tie-in]] featuring artwork from the film and a [[cover version]] by [[Ennio Morricone]] was released in Europe, though the other tracks on the album were soundtracks from ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' and ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]''.

The song appears in the films ''[[More American Graffiti]]'' and ''[[Canadian Bacon]]''. It can be heard in the gun show scene from the 2002 film ''[[Showtime (film)|Showtime]]'', and in the film ''[[Jesus' Son]]'', in a scene that features a hitch-hiking [[Jack Black]].

==Covers and derivatives==
Many American [[cover version]]s of the song appeared recorded by artists ranging from [[Kate Smith]] and [[Duane Eddy]] to unknown artists singing on various [[drugstore records]].

The punk band The F.U's performed a cover of the song, featured on the album This Is Boston, Not L.A.

Many cover versions are in different languages rewritten to reference local units; these include:
*A German version ('''Hundert Mann und ein Befehl'''), sung by [[Freddy Quinn]] and later again by [[Heidi Brühl]] had considerable success in [[Germany]]. The German version is a song '''against''' the war. It rejects any sacrifice, not only for the son, but for the father as well. [[Freddy Quinn]] sings the song from the point of view of the reluctant but forced soldier{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, Heidi Bruhl from the point of view of the crying girlfriend of the soldier.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Freddy Quinn's version was later cover by [[Welle: Erdball]] and also by [[Cryptic Wintermoon]].

*The Royal Netherlands Army's [[Korps Commandotroepen]] (KCT) use the original lyrics. The only difference is that in the chorus, instead of singing &quot;''These are men, America's best''&quot;, they sing &quot;''These are men, The Netherlands' best''&quot;. Also in the final chorus, referring to the son of a deceased Green Beret, they sing &quot;''Make him one of The Netherlands' best''&quot;. This version of the original ballad is sung to recruits who have successfully completed the harsh Basic Commando Training (ECO), and who receive their Green Beret.

*[[Rhodesian]] singer-songwriter [[John Edmond]] recorded the &quot;Ballad of the Green Berets&quot; with reference to the soldiers of the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]] (RLI), commando-style [[fireforce]] units of Rhodesian Security Forces who wore [[berets]] of [[green]] [[color]]. A &quot;Ballad of the Red Beret&quot; was sung by the Rhodesian Ministry of Internal Affairs at their battlecamp in [[Chikurubi]]. In [[South Africa]], the &quot;Ballad of the Green Berets&quot; was recorded as the &quot;Ballad of the Maroon Berets&quot;. The [[Maroon beret]] is a symbol of the [[South African Special Forces Brigade]] and the [[South African 44 Parachute Regiment]].

* The Swedish version &quot;Balladen om den blå baskern&quot; is a salute to the Swedish soldiers serving in the United Nations' peace-keeping forces (the Blue Berets). It was sung by [[Anita Lindblom]].

*The Croatian [[Special Operations Battalion (Croatia)|Bojna za specijalna djelovanja]] (BSD) use the lyrics, but instead of &quot;''These are men, America's best''&quot; they sing &quot;''These are men, Croatia's best''&quot; and in the final chorus, referring to the son of a killed Green Beret, they also sing &quot;''Make him one of Croatia's best''&quot;. It is unclear when exactly is the song first sung by new recruits, but it is assumed to be sometime after completing training.

*The Italian version is called '''La Ballata del Soldato''', sung by [[Quartetto Cetra]].

==Parodies==
*In 1966, '''The Beach Bums''', an ad hoc group featuring a young [[Bob Seger]], recorded &quot;The Ballad of the Yellow Beret&quot;. The song was a send-up of &quot;The Ballad of the Green Berets&quot;, chronicling the adventures of a [[draft dodger]].  The record was withdrawn after a [[cease and desist]] letter from Sadler.  
*[[The Residents]] parodied the song on their ''[[Third Reich &amp; Roll]]'' album.
*Another parody was used on the episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' [[William Shatner]] hosted in 1986, called &quot;Ollie North, The Mute Marine.&quot; Shatner participated in the sketch, outfitted in a USMC Class A uniform, which was a satire of [[Oliver North]] and his refusal at that point to speak up about his participation in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]], and in which he had no lines.
*The song is used to humorous effect in [[Michael Moore]]'s film ''[[Canadian Bacon (film)|Canadian Bacon]]'' as ill-informed Americans prepare for an invasion by [[Canada]].
* In the movie ''[[Wag the Dog]]'', the fictitious unit 303 Special Forces has a song created titled &quot;The Men of the 303&quot; that is played to a deliberately similar but original tune written by Huey Lewis for the film.
* In the film ''[[Caddyshack]],'' Carl Spackler, played by [[Bill Murray]], mumbles the song under his breath while he is connecting the wires to the plunger as he prepares for his final battle with his [[gopher (animal)|gopher]] nemesis.
* Comedian Paul Shanklin parodied the song with &quot;Ballad of the Black Beret&quot;, referring to the Clinton sex scandal, on his 1999 album ''[[Simply Reprehensible]]''.
* Though its usage here is not a parody, in an episode of ''[[Cheers]],'' Cliff aborts his plans to emigrate to Canada with his love interest when Sam, Woody, and Frasier appeal to his patriotic side by singing this song.

'''Baroque dance''' is [[dance]] of the [[Baroque]] era in Europe (roughly 1600–1750), closely linked with [[Baroque music]], theatre and opera.

== English country dance ==
{{See|English Country Dance}}
The majority of surviving choreographies from the period are [[English country dance]]s, such as those in the many editions of [[John Playford|Playford's]] ''[[The Dancing Master]]''.  Playford only gives the floor patterns of the dances, with no indication of the steps.  However other sources of the period, such as the writings of the French dancing-masters [[Raoul Auger Feuillet|Feuillet]] and Lorin, indicate that steps more complicated than simple walking were used at least some of the time.

English country dance survived well beyond the Baroque era and eventually spread in various forms across Europe and its colonies, and to all levels of society.  See the article on [[English country dance]] for more information.

== The French Noble style ==
[[Image:Ballet de la nuit 1653.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A costume design for Louis XIV as The Rising Sun, from the final entrée of ''Le Ballet de la Nuit'' (1653).]]
The great innovations in dance in the 17th century originated at the French court under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], and it is here that we see the first clear stylistic ancestor of [[classical ballet]].  The same basic technique was used both at social events, and as theatrical dance in court ballets and at public theaters.  The style of dance is commonly known to modern scholars as the ''French noble style'' or ''belle danse'' (French, literally &quot;beautiful dance&quot;), however it is often referred to casually as ''baroque dance'' in spite of the existence of other theatrical and social dance styles during the baroque era.

Primary sources include more than three hundred choreographies in [[Beauchamp-Feuillet notation]],&lt;ref&gt;Little, Meredith Ellis and Marsh, Carol G. ''La Danse Noble, An Inventory of Dances and Sources'', (Broude Brothers Ltd, 1992) ISBN 0-8450-0092-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lancelot, Francine, ''La Belle Dance: Catalogue Raisonné'', (Van Dieren Editeur, 1996) ISBN 2-911087-02-X&lt;/ref&gt; as well as manuals by [[Raoul Auger Feuillet]] and [[Pierre Rameau]] in France, [[Kellom Tomlinson]] and [[John Weaver]] in England, and [[Gottfried Taubert]] in Germany.  This wealth of evidence has allowed modern scholars and dancers to recreate the style, although areas of controversy still exist.  The standard modern introduction is Hilton.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, Wendy, ''Dance and Music of Court and Theater: Selected Writings of Wendy Hilton'' (Pendragon Press, 1997) ISBN 0-945193-98-X&lt;/ref&gt;

French dance types include:
* [[Bourrée]]
* [[Canarie (dance)|Canarie]] (canary)
* [[Chaconne]]
* [[Courante|(French) courante]]
* [[Entrée grave]]
* [[Forlane]] (forlana)
* [[Gavotte]]
* [[Gigue]]
* [[Loure]] (slow gigue)
* [[Minuet|Menuet]] (minuet)
* [[Musette]]
* [[Passacaglia|Passacaille]] (passacaglia)
* [[Passepied]]
* [[Rigaudon]]
* [[Sarabande]]
* [[Tambourin]]

The English, working in the French style, added their own [[hornpipe]] to this list.

Many of these dance types are familiar from [[European classical music|baroque music]], perhaps most spectacularly in the stylized [[suite]]s of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]].&lt;ref&gt;Little, Meredith and Jenne, Natalie. ''Dance and the Music of J.S. Bach'' (Indiana University Press, 1991, 2001) ISBN 0-253-21464-5&lt;/ref&gt;  Note however, that the [[allemande]]s, that occur in these suites do not correspond to a French dance from the same period.

== Theatrical dance ==
The French noble style was danced both at social events and by professional dancers in theatrical productions such as opera-ballets and court entertainments.  However, 18th century theatrical dance had at least two other styles: comic or grotesque, and semi-serious. h.j.&lt;ref&gt;Fairfax, Edmund. ''The Styles of Eighteenth-Century Ballet'' (Scarecrow Press, 2003) ISBN 0-8108-4698-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris-Warrick, Rebecca and Brown, Bruce Alan, editors. ''The Grotesque Dancer on the Eighteenth Century Stage'' (The University of Wisconsin Press, 2005) ISBN 0-299-20354-9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other social dance styles ==
Other dance styles, such as the Italian and Spanish dances of the period are much less well studied than either English country dance or the French style.  The general picture seems to be that during most of the 17th century, a style close to that of late [[Renaissance dance]] was widespread, but as time progressed, French ballroom dances such as the minuet were widely adopted at fashionable courts. Beyond this, the evolution and cross-fertilisation of dance styles is an area of ongoing research.

== Modern reconstructions ==
The revival of baroque music in the 1960s and '70s sparked renewed interest in 17th and 18th century dance styles. While some 300 of these dances had been preserved in [[Beauchamp-Feuillet notation]], it wasn't until the mid-20th century that serious scholarship commenced in deciphering the notation and reconstructing the dances.

Perhaps best known among these pioneers was Britain's Melusine Wood, who published several books on historical dancing in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Melusine, ''More Historical Dances'', (Imperial Soc. Dancing, 1956) ISBN 0-900484-12-8&lt;/ref&gt; Miss Wood passed her research on to her student Belinda Quirey, and also to Pavlova Company ballerina &amp; choreographer Mary Skeaping (1902–1984). The latter became well known for her reconstructions of baroque ballets for London's &quot;Ballet for All&quot; company in the 1960s.

The leading figures of the second generation of historical dance research include Shirley Wynne and her Baroque Dance Ensemble which was founded at Ohio State University in the early 1970s and Wendy Hilton (1931–2002), a student of Belinda Quirey  who supplemented the work of Melusine Wood with her own research into original sources. A native of Britain, Hilton arrived in the U.S. in 1969 joining the faculty of the [[Juilliard School]] in 1972 and establishing her own baroque dance workshop at [[Stanford University]] in 1974 which endured for more than 25 years.

Catherine Turocy began her studies in Baroque dance in 1971 as a student of dance historian Shirley Wynne. She founded The New York Baroque Dance Company (http://www.nybaroquedance.org/) in 1976 with Ann Jacoby, and the company has since toured internationally. In 1982/83 as part of the French national celebration of Jean Philippe Rameau's 300th birthday, Turocy choreographed the first production of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]'s ''Les Boréades'' - it was never performed during the composer's lifetime.  This French supported production with John Eliot Gardiner, conductor, and his Orchestra was directed by Jean Louis Martinoty. Ms. Turocy has been decorated as Chevalier in the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by the French government.  

In 1973, French dance historian [[Francine Lancelot]] (1929–2003) began her formal studies in ethnomusicology which later lead her to researching French traditional dance forms and eventually Renaissance and Baroque dances. In 1980, at the invitation of the French Minister of Culture, she founded the baroque dance company &quot;Ris et Danceries&quot;. Her work in choreographing the landmark 1986 production of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]]'s 1676 tragedie-lyrique ''[[Atys (Lully)|Atys]]'' was part of the national celebration of the 300th anniversary of Lully's death.  This production propelled the career of [[William Christie (musician)|William Christie]] and his ensemble [[Les Arts Florissants (ensemble)|Les Arts Florissants]]. Since the Ris et Danseries company was disbanded circa 1993, choreographers from the company have continued with their own work. Béatrice Massin with her &quot;Compagnie Fetes Galantes&quot;, along with Marie Genevieve Massé and her company &quot;L'Eventail&quot; are among the most prominent. In 1986 Francine Lancelot's [[catalogue raisonné]] of baroque dance, entitled &quot;La Belle Dance&quot; was published.

The '''borzoi''' ({{IPA-en|ˈbɔrzɔɪ|}}, literally &quot;fast&quot;) is a [[dog breed|breed]] of [[domestic dog]] (''Canis lupus familiaris'') also called the '''Russian wolfhound''' and descended from dogs brought to Russia from central Asian countries. It is similar in shape to a [[greyhound]], and is also a member of the [[sighthound]] family.

The system by which Russians over the ages named their sighthounds was a series of descriptive terms, not actual names. &quot;Borzói&quot; is the masculine singular form of an archaic Russian adjective that means &quot;fast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://ru.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%B9&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Borzáya sobáka&quot; (&quot;fast dog&quot;) is the basic term used by Russians, though the word &quot;sobáka&quot; is usually dropped. The name &quot;Psovaya&quot; derived from the word Psovina, meaning &quot;wavy, silky coat&quot;, just as &quot;Hortaya&quot; (as in [[Hortaya Borzaya]]) means shorthaired. In Russia today the breed we know as borzoi is therefore officially called &quot;Russkaya Psovaya Borzaya&quot;. Other Russian sighthound breeds are &quot;Stepnaya Borzaya&quot; (from the steppe), called &quot;Stepnoi&quot;; and &quot;Krimskaya Borzaya&quot; (from the Crimea), called &quot;Krimskoi&quot;. 

The plural &quot;borzois&quot; may be found in dictionaries.  However, the [[Borzoi Club of America]] asserts &quot;borzoi&quot; is the preferred form for both singular and plural (in Russian, the plural is actually &quot;borzýe&quot;).  At least one manual of grammatical style rules that the breed name should not be capitalized except at the beginning of a sentence; again, breed fanciers usually differ, and capitalize it wherever found.&lt;ref&gt;The Times (of London, UK) Online Style Guide, see ''dog''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
=== Appearance ===

Borzoi are large Russian [[sighthound]]s which look similar to a number of central Asian breeds such as the [[Afghan hound]], [[Saluki]] and the Kyrgyz Taigan.  As a general approximation, &quot;long-haired [[greyhound]]&quot; is a useful description. Borzoi can come in almost any color or color combination.The long top-coat is silky and quite flat, with varying degrees of waviness or curling. The soft undercoat thickens in winter or cold climates, but is shed in hot weather to prevent overheating. In its texture and distribution over the body, the borzoi coat is unique. [[File:Borzoi coat.jpg|thumb|left|The borzoi coat is silky and flat, often wavy or slightly curly.]]

Borzoi males frequently reach in excess of 100 pounds (45&amp;nbsp;kg), ~120 pounds. Males should stand at least 30&amp;nbsp;inches (about 80 centimeters) at the shoulder, while females should not be less than 26&amp;nbsp;inches (about 66 centimeters). Despite their size, the overall impression is of streamlining and grace, with a curvy shapeliness and compact strength.

=== Temperament ===

[[File:Borzoi at home.jpg|thumb|right|Borzoi are gracious couch potatoes at home.]] The borzoi is a quiet but athletic and independent dog. Most borzoi are almost silent, barking only very rarely. They do not have strong territorial drives and cannot be relied on to raise the alarm upon sighting a human intruder. They are gentle and highly sensitive dogs with a natural respect for humans, and as adults they are decorative couch potatoes with remarkably gracious house-manners. Borzois should never display dominance or aggression towards people. Typically however, they are rather reserved and sensitive to invasion of their personal space; this can make them nervous around children unless they are brought up with them from an early age. Despite their size they adapt very well to suburban living, provided they have a spacious yard and regular opportunities for free exercise. 

A common misunderstanding about the intelligence of breeds in the [[Hound]] group stems from their independent nature, which conflicts with the frequent confusion between the concepts of &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;obedience&quot; in discussions of canine brainpower.  [[Stanley Coren]]'s survey of canine obedience trainers, published in the book [[The Intelligence of Dogs]], reported that borzoi obeyed the first command less than 25% of the time. Coren's test however was by his own admission heavily weighted towards the &quot;obedience&quot; interpretation of intelligence and based on a better understanding of &quot;working&quot; breeds than hounds. Unfortunately the publicity given to this report has led to unfair denigration of breeds which are under-represented in obedience clubs and poorly understood by the average obedience trainer.&lt;ref&gt;At a Conformation Judges training session not long after Coren's book was released, I was greeted by the co-ordinator with the question, &quot;I read something that said Borzois aren't very smart, is that true?&quot; This to the owner of several Borzoi, one of which knows how to open the refrigerator, and all of which respond instantly to &quot;commands&quot; given in that special owner-dog private language that wouldn't even be noticed by an outsider.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Work&quot; for hound breeds is done out of hearing and often out of sight of the human companion; it is an activity for which the dogs are &quot;released&quot;, rather than an activity which is &quot;commanded&quot;. In obedience terms, borzoi are selective learners who quickly become bored with repetitive, apparently pointless, activity, and they can be very stubborn when they are not properly motivated. For example, food rewards, or &quot;baiting&quot;, may work well for some individuals, but not all. Nevertheless, borzoi are definitely capable of enjoying and performing well in [[obedience trial|competitive obedience]] and [[dog agility|agility trials]] with the right kind of [[obedience training|training]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott pp.113, http://www.nktelco.net/teine/lyric.htm, http://www.borzoiclubofamerica.org/ava.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Like other sighthounds they do not cope well with harsh treatment or training based on punishment, and will be extremely unhappy if raised voices and threats are a part of their daily life. However like any intelligent dog, borzoi respond extremely well to the guidance, support, and clear communication of a benevolent human leadership.

Borzoi were bred to pursue, or &quot;course&quot;, game and have a powerful instinct to chase things that run from them. Built for speed and endurance, they can cover long distances in a very short time. A fully-fenced yard is an absolute necessity for keeping any [[sighthound]]. They are highly independent and will range far and wide without containment, with little regard for road traffic. For off-lead exercise, a borzoi needs a very large field or park, either fully fenced or well away from any roads, to ensure its safety. &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Borzoi_in_flight.jpg|thumb|left|A young borzoi at a full run. This spectacular action comes in short bursts of activity; thirty minutes of off lead exercise a day is more than sufficient.]] --&gt;

Borzoi are born with specialized coursing skills, but these are quite different from the dog-fighting instincts seen in some breeds. It is quite common for borzoi at play to course (run down) another dog, seize it by the neck and hold it immobile. Young pups do this with their littermates, trading off as to who is the prey. It is a specific hunting behavior, not a fighting or territorial domination behavior.

Borzoi can be raised very successfully to live with [[cat]]s and other small animals provided they are introduced to them at a young age. Some, however, will possess the hunting instinct to such a degree that they find it impossible not to chase a cat that is moving quickly. The hunting instinct is triggered by movement and much depends on how the cat behaves.

== Health ==
[[File:Borzoi portrait Flickr2.jpg|thumb|left|Borzois vary widely in colour.]]
Life expectancy is 7 to 10 years. Exceptional individuals have lived to be more than 14 years of age. Dogs that are physically fit and vigorous in their youth through middle age are more vigorous and healthy as elderly dogs, all other factors being equal. In the UK various cancers, followed by cardiac problems, seem to be the most frequent causes of premature death [http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/cgi-bin/search.cgi?qt=mortality+borzoi&amp;ss=0&amp;search=Search]. 

Like its native relative the [[Hortaya Borzaya]], the borzoi is basically a very sound breed. [[Osteochondritis dissecans|OCD]], [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip]] and [[elbow dysplasia]] have remained almost unknown, as were congenital eye and heart diseases before the 1970s. However, in some countries modern breeding practices have  introduced a few problems.

As with other very deep-chested breeds, [[gastric torsion]] is the most common serious health problem in the borzoi. Also known as [[bloat]], this life-threatening condition is believed to be anatomical rather than strictly genetic in origin. Many borzoi owners recommend feeding the dog from a raised platform instead of placing the food-dish on the ground, and making sure that the dog rests quietly for several hours after eating, as the most reliable way to prevent bloat. 

Less common are cardiac problems including [[cardiomyopathy]] and [[cardiac arrhythmia]] disorders. A controversy exists as to the presence of [[progressive retinal atrophy]] in the breed. A condition identified as Borzoi Retinopathy is seen in some individuals, usually active dogs, which differs from progressive retinal atrophy in several ways. First, it is unilateral, and rarely seen in animals less than 3 years of age; second, a clear cut pattern of inheritance has not been demonstrated; and finally, most affected individuals do not go blind.  

[[File:Baby Borzoi.jpg|thumb|right|Borzoi puppies rapidly grow into strong and graceful sprinters.]]Correct nutrition during puppyhood is also debatable for borzoi. These dogs naturally experience enormous growth surges in the first year or two of their lives. It is now widely accepted that forcing even faster growth by feeding a highly concentrated, high-energy diet is dangerous for skeletal development, causing unsoundness and increased tendency to joint problems and injury. Being built primarily for speed, borzoi do not carry large amounts of body fat or muscle, and therefore have a rather different physiology to other dogs of similar size (such as the [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]], [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] or [[Alaskan Malamute]]). Laboratory-formulated diets designed for a generic &quot;large&quot; or &quot;giant&quot; breed are unlikely to take the needs of the big sighthounds into account. 

The issues involved in [[raw feeding]] may be particularly relevant to tall, streamlined breeds such as the borzoi. It is interesting to note that the [[Hortaya Borzaya]], undoubtedly a very close relative, is traditionally raised on a meager diet of oats and table scraps. The Hortaya is also said to be intolerant of highly concentrated kibble feeds. Basically, a lean body weight in itself is nothing to be concerned about, and force-feeding of healthy young borzoi is definitely not recommended.

== History ==
[[File:Охота на волка.jpg|thumb|300 px|left|A borzoi pack assisting in a Russian [[wolf hunting|wolf hunt]], as shown on ''Охота на волка'' 1873]]
It was long thought that Saluki type sighthounds were originally brought to [[Russia]] from Byzantium in the South about the 9th and 10th centuries and again later by the Mongol invaders from the East. However, now that the archeological archives and research results of the former USSR are open to scientists, it has become quite clear that the primal sighthound type evolved between the Kyrgyzstan, the lower Kazakhstan part of Altai and the Afghan plains, and that the earliest actual sighthound breeds were the plains Afghan hounds and the Kyrgyz Taigan.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

These ancient breeds then migrated South (founding the Tazi/Saluki branch) and West (founding the Stepnaya, Krimskaya and Hortaya branches) to develop into breeds adapted to those regions. This was a slow process which happened naturally through normal spreading of trade, with the silk and spice trade via the Silk Road being the prime vector.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The more modern Psovaya Borzaya was founded on Stepnaya, Hortaya and the Ukrainian-Polish version of the old Hort. There were also imports of Western sighthound breeds to add to the height and weight. It was crossed as well with the Russian Laika specifically and singularly to add resistance against Northern cold and a longer and thicker coat than the Southern sighthounds were equipped with.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

All of these foundation types - Tazi, Hortaya, Stepnaya, Krimskaya and Hort - already possessed the instincts and agility necessary for hunting and bringing down wolves. 

The Psovoi was popular with the [[Tsar]]s before the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|1917 revolution]]. For centuries, Psovoi could not be purchased but only given as gifts from the Tsar. [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856-1929)|Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaievich of Russia]] bred countless Psovoi at [[Perchino]], his private estate.&lt;ref&gt;Scott pp.10&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian concept of hunting trials was instituted during the era of the Tsars.  As well as providing exciting sport, the tests were used for selecting borzoi breeding stock; only the quickest and most intelligent hunting dogs went on to produce progeny. For the aristocracy these trials were a well-organized ceremony, sometimes going on for days, with the borzoi accompanied by mounted hunters and [[Foxhound]]s on the Russian [[steppe]]. Hares and other small game were by far the most numerous kills, but the hunters especially loved to test their dogs on wolf. If a wolf was sighted, the hunter would release a team of two or three borzoi. The dogs would pursue the wolf, attack its neck from both sides, and hold it until the hunter arrived. The classic kill was by the human hunter with a knife. Wolf trials are still a regular part of the hunting diploma for all Russian sightdog breeds of the relevant type, either singly or in pairs or trios, in their native country.  
[[File:Borzoi from 1915.JPG|thumb|Borzoi circa 1915]]
In the [[1917 Revolution]], large numbers of native Psovoi were destroyed by the revolutionaries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The Tsars had turned them into a symbol of affluence and tyranny{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, and they were not welcomed into the new world of the [[Soviet Union]]. Some noblemen took it upon themselves to shoot their own dogs rather than allow them to fall into the hands of militants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} However, the Psovoi survived along with the other borzaya variants in the Russian countryside. 

In the late 1940s a Soviet soldier named [[Constantin Esmont]] made detailed records of the various types of borzoi dogs he found in the Cossack villages. Esmont's amazing pictures were recently published  and can be viewed by clicking on the link below. 

Esmont was concerned that the distinct types of borzaya were in danger of degenerating without a controlled system of breeding. He convinced the Soviet government that borzoi were a valuable asset to the hunters who supported the fur industry and henceforth, their breeding was officially regulated. To this day short-haired [[Hortaya Borzaya]] are highly valued hunting dogs on the steppes, while the long-haired Psovaya Borzaya, still carrying some of the stigma of its association with the old White Russia, has become more common as a decorative companion.

Exports of borzoi to other countries were extremely rare during the Soviet era. However enough had been taken to England, Scandinavia, Western Europe and America in the late 19th century for the breed to establish itself outside its native country.

== Art ==

In 2004, the UK [[The Kennel Club|Kennel Club]] held its 4th temporary exhibition entitled 'The Borzoi in Art'. The exhibition offered a unique insight into the borzoi and how the breed has been depicted in art throughout the 19th and 20th Centuries. The exhibition included paintings, bronzes and porcelain which had previously never before been available for the public viewing. The exhibition ran from September 27 to December 3.  The borzoi may frequently be found in art deco period works.

}}&lt;!-- End Infobox --&gt;

The '''Basenji''' is a [[dog breed|breed]] of [[hunting dog]] that was bred from stock originating in central [[Africa]]. Most of the major [[kennel club]]s in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world place the breed in the [[Hound Group]]; more specifically, it may be classified as belonging to the [[sighthound]] [[dog type|type]]. The [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] places the breed in Group 5, [[Spitz]] and Primitive types, and the United Kennel Club (US) places the breed in the [[Sighthound &amp; Pariah Group]].

The Basenji produces an unusual [[yodeling|yodel]]-like sound commonly called a &quot;barroo&quot;, due to its unusually shaped larynx.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from the book &quot;Why Pandas Do Handstands,&quot; 2006, by Augustus Brown.&lt;/ref&gt; This trait also gives the Basenji the nickname &quot;Barkless Dog.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basenji.org/african/tudor885.htm BCOA African Stock Project - 1945 Letter from Africa&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Basenjis share many unique traits with [[Pariah dog]] types. Basenjis, like [[dingos]] and some other breeds of dog, come into [[estrous cycle#Estrus|estrus]] only once annually, as compared to other dog breeds which may have two or more breeding seasons every year. Both dingos and Basenjis lack a distinctive odor,&lt;ref name=&quot;AKC&quot;&gt;http://akc.org/breeds/basenji/ AKC Meet the Breeds: Basenji. AKC. Retrieved 2009-09-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rightpet.com/ratingofdog/dingo/300 Right Pet: Dingo]&lt;/ref&gt; and are prone to howls, yodels, and other undulated vocalizations over the characteristic bark of modern dog breeds. One theory holds that the latter trait is the result of the selective killing of barkier dogs in the traditional Central African context because barking could lead enemies to humans' forest encampments. While dogs that resemble the basenji in some respects are commonplace over much of Africa, the breed's original foundation stock came from the old growth forest regions of the [[Congo Basin]], where its structure and type were fixed by adaptation to its habitat, as well as use (primarily net hunting in extremely dense old-growth forest vegetation).

== Characteristics ==
=== Appearance ===
[[File:Basenji 600.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A red Basenji]]

Basenji are small, elegant-looking, short-haired dogs with erect ears, a tightly curled tail and a graceful neck. Some people{{Who|date=April 2011}} consider their appearance similar to that of a miniature deer. A basenji's forehead is wrinkled, especially when the animal is young or extremely old. Basenji eyes are typically almond shaped, which gives the dog the appearance of squinting seriously.

Dogs typically weigh 24 pounds (11&amp;nbsp;kg) and stand 16&amp;nbsp;inches (40.6&amp;nbsp;cm) at the [[withers]]. They are typically a square breed, which means that they are as long as they are tall. The basenji is an athletic dog and is deceptively powerful for its size. They have a graceful, confident gait like a trotting horse, and skim the ground in a [[double-suspension gallop]], with their characteristic curled tail straightened out for greater balance, when running flat-out at their top speed.

The basenji is recognized in the following standard colorations: red, black, tricolor (black with tan in the traditional pattern), and brindle (black stripes on a background of red), all with white, by the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale|FCI]], [[The Kennel Club|KC]], [[American Kennel Club|AKC]], and [[United Kennel Club|UKC]]. There are additional variations, such as the &quot;trindle&quot;, which is a tricolor with brindle points, and several other colorations exist in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] such as liver, shaded reds and sables, and &quot;capped&quot; tricolors (creeping tan).

=== Temperament ===
[[File:ramses väg mur.jpg|thumb|A basenji standing on its hind legs to look over a wall]]

The Basenji is alert, affectionate, energetic, curious and reserved with strangers. The Basenji is somewhat aloof, but can also form strong bonds with people and can become emotionally attached to a single human. Basenjis may not get along with non-canine pets. It is commonly patient, but does best with older considerate handlers. Basenjis dislike wet weather, like to climb, can easily get over chain wire fences, and are very clever at getting their own way. The Basenji has the unique properties of not barking (it makes a low, liquid ululation instead) and cleaning itself like a cat. Often, the Besenji is commonly referred to as the shreiking dog, or screaming child dog. It can be described as speedy, frisky, tireless at play, and teasing the owner into play. Most Basenji problems involve a mismatch between owner and pet. Basenjis often stand on their hind legs, somewhat like a [[meerkat]], by themselves or leaning on something; this behavior is often observed when the dog is curious about something. Basenjis reveal their animal-of-prey nature by chasing after fast moving objects that cross their paths.  According to [[The_Intelligence_of_Dogs]], they are the 2nd least trainable dog.

== Health ==

There is apparently only one completed health survey of basenjis,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassidy Data&quot;&gt;http://users.pullman.com/lostriver/breeddata.htm Dog Longevity Web Site, Breed Data page. Compiled by K. M. Cassidy. Retrieved July 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey.&lt;ref name=&quot;KC Survey&quot;&gt;http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/570 Kennel Club/British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee. 2004. Purebred Dog Health Survey. Retrieved July 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Many basenjis suffer from PRA (progressive retinal atrophy), which causes blindness, and Fanconi syndrome, which can cause kidney failure. Besides Fanconi Syndrome and PRA, Basenjis also suffer from Hypothyroidism, IPSID (immunoproliferative systemic intestinal disease), and HA (Hemolytic Anemia). Basenjis are also sensitive to environmental and household chemicals which can cause liver problems.

===Mortality===
[[File:Basenji puppies.jpg|thumb|Very young basenji puppies]]

Basenjis in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey had a median lifespan of 13.6 years (sample size of 46 deceased dogs),&lt;ref name=&quot;KC Survey&quot;/&gt; which is 1–2 years longer than the median lifespan of other breeds of similar size.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassidy Weight&quot;&gt;http://users.pullman.com/lostriver/weight_and_lifespan.htm Dog Longevity Web Site, Weight and Longevity page. Compiled by K. M. Cassidy. Retrieved July 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest dog in the survey was 17.5 years. Most common causes of death were old age (30%), urologic (incontinence, Fanconi syndrome, chronic kidney failure 13%), behavior (&quot;unspecified&quot; and aggression 9%), and cancer. (9%).&lt;ref name=&quot;KC Survey&quot;/&gt;

===Morbidity===

Among 78 live dogs in the 2004 UKC survey, the most common health issues noted by owners were with their skin and urologic&lt;ref name=&quot;KC Survey&quot;/&gt; (urologic issues in basenjis can be signs of Fanconi syndrome).

====Fanconi Syndrome====
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
[[Fanconi syndrome]], an inheritable disorder in which the kidneys fail to reabsorb [[electrolyte]]s and nutrients, is unusually common in basenjis. Symptoms include excessive drinking, excessive urination, and glucose in the urine, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of diabetes. Fanconi syndrome usually presents between 4 and 8 years of age, but sometimes as early as 3 years or as late as 10 years. Fanconi syndrome is treatable and organ damage is reduced if treatment begins early. Basenji owners are advised to test their dog's urine for glucose once a month beginning at the age of 3 years. Glucose testing strips designed for human diabetics are inexpensive and available at most pharmacies.

=====Fanconi DNA Linkage Test=====
In July 2007, Dr. Gary Johnson of the University of Missouri released the [[genetic linkage|linked marker]] DNA test for Fanconi Syndrome in basenjis. It is the first predictive test available for Fanconi Syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Basenji Health Endowment: Fanconi Linkage Test FAQ| url = http://www.basenjihealth.org/linkage-faq.html | accessdate = 2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this test, it is possible to more accurately determine the probability of a dog carrying the gene for Fanconi Syndrome.

Dogs tested using this &quot;Linkage Test&quot; will return one of the following statuses:
:*'''Probably Clear/Normal'''
::Indicates the individual has most likely inherited normal DNA from both parents.  It is unlikely that basenjis which test this way will produce affected puppies no matter which dog they are bred to.
:*'''Probably Carrier'''
::Indicates the individual has most likely inherited normal DNA from one parent and DNA with the Fanconi syndrome mutation from the other parent.  Although this basenji is unlikely to develop Fanconi syndrome, it could produce puppies that will develop Fanconi syndrome.  To minimize the chances of this happening it is recommended carriers be bred only to those that test as Probably Clear/Normal for Fanconi Syndrome.
:*'''Probably Equivocal/Indeterminate'''
::Indicates the individual's DNA contained features found in both &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;carrier&quot; basenjis. At present it cannot be predicted whether these basenjis are carriers or normal; however, it is unlikely that they will develop Fanconi syndrome.  The safest strategy would be to treat them as “carriers” and only bred to those basenjis that test as Probably Clear/Normal for Fanconi Syndrome.
:*'''Probably Affected'''
::Indicates the individual is likely to develop clinical Fanconi syndrome and is likely to produce puppies with Fanconi Syndrome if bred to basenjis other than those that test as Probably Clear/Normal for Fanconi Syndrome.

This linkage test is being provided as a tool to assist breeders whilst research continues towards the development of the direct fanconi test.

====Other basenji health issues====
Basenjis sometimes carry a simple recessive gene which, when homozygous for the defect, causes [[hemolysis|genetic Hemolytic Anemia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basenjiweb.com/basenji-health-issues.html Basenji Health Issues&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Most 21st-century basenjis are descended from ancestors that have tested clean. When lineage from a fully tested line (set of ancestors) cannot be completely verified, the dog should be tested before breeding. As this is a non-invasive DNA test, a basenji can be tested for HA at any time.

Basenjis sometimes suffer from [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], resulting in loss of mobility and arthritis-like symptoms. All dogs should be tested by either [[Orthopedic Foundation for Animals|OFA]] or [[PennHIP]] prior to breeding.

[[Malabsorption]], or immunoproliferative enteropathy, is an autoimmune intestinal disease that leads to [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], chronic [[diarrhea]], and even death. A special diet can improve the quality of life for afflicted dogs.

The breed can also fall victim to [[progressive retinal atrophy]] (a degeneration of the retina causing blindness) and several less serious hereditary eye problems such as [[coloboma]] (a hole in the eye structure), and [[persistent pupillary membrane]] (tiny threads across the pupil).

== History ==
[[File:Brindle Basenji.jpg|thumb|left|A brindle Basenji]]
The basenji is arguably one of the most [[ancient dog breeds]]. Originating on the continent of [[Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.basenji.org/BasenjiU/Owner/Handbook/HandPDF/IntroductionOG.pdf Basenji Club Of America Introduction to Basenjis]&lt;/ref&gt; basenji-like dogs have lived with humans for thousands of years. Dogs resembling modern Basenjis can be seen on [[stelae]] in the tombs of [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[pharaoh]]s, sitting at the feet of their masters, looking just as they do today, with pricked ears and tightly curled tails. Dogs of this type were originally kept for hunting small game by [[coursing]].

Europeans first described the type of dog from which the basenji breed was derived in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] in 1895. These local dogs, which Europeans identified as a unique breed and called &quot;basenji&quot; were prized by locals for their intelligence, courage, speed, and silence. However an article published called The Intelligence of Dogs by Stanley Coren, Ph.D. questions this. It ranks the breed at #78 out of 79 which is the second to lowest rank in intelligence. Although very intelligent, basenjis have an independent nature like a cat and do not do things simply to please their owners. One theory explains that this is why they would do poorly on a test that measured a dog's &quot;intelligence&quot; by how well they follow commands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.basenji.org/BasenjiU/Owner/Handbook/HandPDF/UnderstandingOG.pdf Basenji Club Of America Understanding Basenjis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Basenjis were assistants to the hunt, chasing wild game into nets for their masters. The [[Azande]] and [[Mangbetu people|Mangbetu]] people from the northeastern Congo region describe basenjis, in the local [[Lingala language]], as ''mbwá na basɛ́nzi''. Translated, this means &quot;dogs of the savages&quot;, or &quot;dogs of the villagers&quot;. In the Congo, the basenji is also known as &quot;dog of the bush.&quot; The dogs are also known to the Azande of southern Sudan as Ango Angari.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basenji.org/african/tudor59.htm BCOA African Stock Project - My Journey into the Home of the Basenji&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''basɛ́nzi'' itself is the plural form of ''mosɛ́nzi''. In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], another [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]], from East Africa, ''mbwa shenzi'' translates to “wild dog”. Another local name is ''m’bwa m’kube m’bwa wamwitu'', or “jumping up and down dog”,{{Dubious|date=September 2010}} a reference to their tendency to jump straight up to spot their quarry.

Several attempts were made to bring the breed to [[England]], but the earliest imports succumbed to disease. In 1923, for example, Lady Helen Nutting brought six basenjis with her from [[Sudan]], but all six died from [[canine distemper|distemper]] shots they received in [[quarantine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basenji.org/african/nutting.htm BCOA African Stock Project - Lady Helen Nutting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 1930s that foundation stock was successfully established in England, and then to the [[United States]] by animal importer [[Henry Trefflich]]. So it is that nearly all the basenjis in the Western world are descended from these few original imports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basenji.org/african/jone8908.htm BCOA African Stock Project - History of the Breed Presented to the AKC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The breed was officially accepted into the AKC in 1943. In 1990, the AKC stud book was reopened to 14 new imports at the request of the Basenji Club of America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basenji.org/NativeStock/Correspondence/FirstLetterToAKC.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The stud book was reopened again to selected imported dogs from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akc.org/pdfs/about/board_minutes/0808.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; An American led expedition collected breeding stock in villages in the [[Basankusu]] area of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dibubasenjis.com/congo10.htm Dibu Basenjis Expedition to [[Basankusu]].]&lt;/ref&gt; Basenjis are also registered with the [[United Kennel Club|UKC]].

Although in the past it was speculated that Basenjis were somehow descended from jackals, modern genetic testing shows that Basenjis are related to all other dogs and are descended from the wolf, ''Canis lupus''.  However, further study is needed to determine whether they belong to the subspecies ''[[Canis lupus familiaris]]'', as is the case with most dogs, or rather into the subspecies ''[[Canis lupus dingo]]'', which includes such the [[New Guinea Singing Dog]], the [[Telomian]], the [[Australian Dingo],] and [[Thai Ridgeback]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canids.org/species/Dingo.pdf p.223&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basenjis in popular culture ==
*The title character of the 1954 novel ''[[Good-bye, My Lady]]'', by [[James H. Street]], is a basenji. It's the story of a young boy in [[Mississippi]] who takes in a most unusual stray. The book was made into a [[Good-bye, My Lady#Other media|movie of the same name]] in 1956, with a cast that included [[Brandon De Wilde]], [[Walter Brennan]], and [[Sidney Poitier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049271/ Good-bye, My Lady (1956)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Veronica Anne Starbuck's 2000 novel ''Heart of the Savannah'' features a basenji named Savannah. Savannah narrates this story about her adventures as an African-bred dog brought to America. Starbuck also wrote a sequel titled ''August Magic''.

*Simon Cleveland wrote a novel titled ''The Basenji Revelation'', published by Lulu Press in 2004, in which a government agent suffers [[amnesia]] and undergoes a change in personality after inheriting a basenji from his late mother. The book delivers insightful facts about the ancient origins of the breed.

*The true story of a basenji was featured in the episode ''The Cat Came Back'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisamericanlife.org/pages/descriptions/06/316.html&lt;/ref&gt; on the radio program ''[[This American Life]]''. The segment tells the story of a family who chose a basenji because they do not shed or slobber, but became frustrated with his aloofness and destructiveness. They eventually bring him to live on a farm {{convert|30|mi|km}} away, but within a few days the tenacious dog found its way all the way back home.

*In Spike Milligan's War Diaries &quot;Mussolini: His Part in My Downfall&quot; (Sept 24, 1943) the following exchange takes place:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

...we are bloody lost. Lt. Budden is looking studiously at his map, the wrong way up.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;It's upside down, Sir.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;I know that, I turned it upside down for a reason.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Sorry, Sir, only trying to help.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;If you want to help, Milligan, act like a basenji.&quot;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*According to the [[webcomic]] ''[[Achewood]]'', if [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] were a dog, he'd be a basenji.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.assetbar.com/achewood/one_strip?b=M%5ea11f09b8576e606bcb5038dfdb92fb821&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fachewood.com%2Fcomic.php%3Fdate%3D03072008 An Afternoon With Molly Sanders]&lt;/ref&gt;

*A man and his Basenji were featured on an episode of ''LA Ink''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aV2hDBvClk YouTube excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt; The basenji has an unusual marking of a diamond in the middle of his back. The owner has a replica tattooed on his own back during the episode.

*Basenjis are featured in an episode of the animated television series [[The Wild Thornberrys]] In episode 3.04 &quot;Tyler Tucker, I Presume?&quot;. [[The Wild Thornberrys#Characters|Nigel Thornberry]] encounters a group of tribesmen along with their [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] hunting dogs. The series' director, [[Mark Risley]] owns several basenjis, and his dogs provided the recorded &quot;voices&quot; for their animated counterparts.

*The basenji was featured on CBS's early show during Dog Week: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3FAU2a0Roc

'''Brit milah''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|בְּרִית מִילָה}} [b'rī&lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt; mī'lā], [[Ashkenazi]] pronunciation, '''bris milôh''', &quot;covenant of circumcision&quot;; [[Yiddish]] pronunciation,  '''bris''') is a [[Jewish]] religious [[circumcision]] ceremony performed on 8-day old male infants by a [[mohel]]. The brit milah is followed by a celebratory meal (''[[seudat mitzvah]]'').

==Biblical references==
{{main|Circumcision in the Bible}}
[[File:Isaac's circumcision, Regensburg c1300.jpg|thumb|240px|&quot;Isaac's Circumcision&quot;, Regensburg Pentateuch, c1300]]
In the [[Hebrew Bible]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|17:1-14|HE}}) circumcision was enjoined by [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] to the Biblical patriarch [[Abraham]], an act to be followed by his descendants:


:''Abram was 99 years old. God appeared to him and said, 'I am God Almighty. Walk before Me and be perfect. I will make a covenant between Me and you, and I will increase your numbers very much.' [...] This is My covenant between Me, and between you and your offspring that you must keep: You must circumcise every male. You shall be circumcised through the flesh of your foreskin. This shall be the mark of the covenant between Me and you. 'Throughout all generations, every male shall be circumcised when he is eight days old. [This shall include] those born in your house, as well as [slaves] bought with cash from an outsider, who is not your descendant. [All slaves,] both houseborn and purchased with your money must be circumcised. This shall be My covenant in your flesh, an eternal covenant. The uncircumcised male whose foreskin has not been circumcised, shall have his soul cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.'' ({{bibleverse||Genesis|17:1-14|HE}})

As well as in {{bibleverse||Leviticus|12:3|HE}}:
:''On the eighth day, [the child's] foreskin shall be circumcised.''

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], it was &quot;a reproach&quot; for an [[Israelite]] to be uncircumcised ([[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 5:9.)  The name ''arelim'' (&quot;uncircumcised&quot; [plural]) is used opprobriously, denoting the [[Philistines]] and other non-Israelites ([[Books of Samuel|I Samuel]] 14:6, 31:4; II Samuel 1:20) and used in conjunction with ''tameh'' (unpure) for heathen ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 52:1). The word ''arel'' (&quot;uncircumcised&quot; [singular]) is also employed for &quot;impermeable&quot; ([[Leviticus]] 26:41, &quot;their uncircumcised hearts&quot;; compare [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 9:25; [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 44:7,9); it is also applied to the first three years' fruit of a tree, which is forbidden ([[Leviticus]] 19:23).

However, the Israelites born in the wilderness after the [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] from Egypt were not circumcised. [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 5:2-9, explains, &quot;all the people that came out&quot; of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] were circumcised, but those &quot;born in the wilderness&quot; were not. Therefore Joshua, before the celebration of the [[Passover]], had them circumcised at [[Gilgal]] specifically before they entered Canaan. Abraham, too, was circumcised when he moved into Canaan. 

The prophetic tradition emphasizes that God expects people to be good as well as pious, and that non-Jews will be judged based on their ethical behavior. Thus, Jeremiah 9:25-26 says that circumcised and uncircumcised will be punished alike by the Lord; for &quot;all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.&quot;

The penalty of non-observance is ''[[kareth]]'' (spiritual excision from the Jewish nation), as noted in {{bibleverse||Genesis|17:1-14|HE}}. Conversion to Judaism for non-Israelites in Biblical times necessitated circumcision otherwise one could not partake in the [[Passover]] offering ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|HE}}). Today, as in the time of Abraham, it is required of converts in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] [[Judaism]] . ({{bibleverse||Genesis|34:14-16|HE}}).

As found in Genesis 17:1-14, ''Brit milah'' is considered to be so important that should the eighth day fall on [[Shabbat|the Sabbath]], actions that would normally be forbidden because of the sanctity of the day are permitted in order to fulfill the requirement to circumcise. The [[Talmud]], when discussing the importance of Milah, compares it to being equal to all other mitzvot based on the gematria for ''brit'' of 612.&lt;ref&gt;Tractate [[Nedarim (tractate)|Nedarim]] 32a&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremony==
===Time and place===
It is customary for the brit to be held in a synagogue, but it can also be held at home or any other suitable location. The brit is performed on the eighth day from the baby's birth, taking into consideration that according to the Jewish calendar, the day begins at the sunset of the day before. If the baby is born on Sunday before sunset, the Brit will be held the following Sunday. However, if the baby is born on Sunday night after sunset, the Brit is on the following Monday. The brit takes place on the eighth day following birth even if that day is Shabbat or a holiday. A brit is traditionally performed in the morning, but it may be performed any time during daylight hours. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/144464/jewish/The-Proper-Time-and-Place.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Postponement for health reasons====
If the child is born [[premature baby|prematurely]] or has other serious medical problems, the brit milah will be postponed until the doctors and mohel deem the child strong enough.

===Kvatter===
[[File:Göttingen-Beschneidungswerkzeuge.02.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Set of brit milah implements,  [[Göttingen]] city museum]]
The name of ''Kvatter'' or ''Kvatterin'' (female) among [[Ashkenazi Jews]] is for the person who carries the baby from the mother to the father, who in turn carries him to the [[mohel]]. This honor is usually given to a couple without children, as a merit or charm that they should have children of their own. The origins of the term may simply be a corruption of &quot;Gevatter&quot;, an archaic [[German language|German]] word for [[godparent|godfather]],&lt;ref&gt;http://beritmila.org/Glossary.html&lt;/ref&gt; but it is also said to be a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] erroneous combination of the words &quot;Kavod&quot; (&quot;honor&quot; in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) and &quot;Tor&quot; (&quot;door&quot; in Yiddish), meaning &quot;The person honored by bringing the baby&quot;. Another source is a mix of [[Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]] meaning 'like the father'.

===Seudat mitzvah ===
After the ceremony, a [[Seudat mitzvah|celebratory meal]] takes place. At the ''[[birkat hamazon]]'' additional introductory lines, known as ''Nodeh Leshimcha'', are added. These lines praise God and request the permission of God, the [[Torah]], [[Kohen|Kohanim]] and distinguished people present to proceed with the grace. When the four main blessings are concluded, special ''ha-Rachaman'' prayers are recited which request that God bless the parents of the baby, and help them raise him wisely; the ''[[sandek]]''; the baby boy to have strength and grow up to trust in God and perceive Him [[Three pilgrim festivals|three times a year]]; the ''mohel'' for unhesitatingly performing the ritual; to send the [[Jewish Messiah]] speedily in the merit of this [[mitzvah]]; and to send [[Elijah (prophet)|Elijah]] the prophet, known as &quot;The Righteous Kohen&quot;, so that God's covenant can be fulfilled with the re-establishment of the throne of King [[David]].

==Priah==
At the neonatal stage, the inner preputial [[epithelium]] is still linked with the surface of the [[glans]].&lt;ref&gt;

However, on ritual circumcisions performed by a mohel, the epithelium is most commonly peeled off, only after the foreskin has been amputated. This procedure is called 'priah'(Hebrew: פריעה), which means: 'uncovering'.

According to the traditional Jewish sources, the 'priah' is performed, as part of the Jewish circumcision, since the [[Israelites]] first inhabited the [[Land of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud Bavli]] Tractate Yebamoth 71b: Rabbah b. Isaac stated in the name of Rab: The commandment of uncovering the corona at circumcision was not given to Abraham; for it is said, At that time the Lord said unto Joshua: 'Make thee knives of flint etc.' But is it not possible [that this applied to] those who were not previously circumcised; for it is written, For all the people that came out were circumcised, but all the people that were born etc.? — If so, why the expression. 'Again!' Consequently it must apply to the uncovering of the corona.&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, the ''Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion'', argues that many Hellenistic Jews had an operation performed to conceal the fact of their circumcision, and that similar action was taken during the Hadrianic persecution, in which period a prohibition against circumcision was issued. Thus, hypothesize the editors, it was probably in order to prevent the possibility of obliterating the traces of circumcision that the rabbis added to the requirement of cutting the foreskin that of priah.&lt;ref&gt;Werblowsky, R.J. Zwi &amp; Wigoder, Geoffrey (1997) The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The frenulum may also be cut away at the same time, in a procedure called [[frenectomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since the arterioles of the orlah, or the foreskin, branch off from the dorsal arteries (the arteries of the upper side of the organ), cutting away the foreskin can result in a temporary obstruction in these dorsal arteries. This temporary obstruction, caused by arterial muscle contraction, continues to develop into a more enduring blockage as the stationary blood begins to clot. The tragic result can be severe hypoxia ... How do we know when a temporary blockage has successfully been averted?

 |quote = Metzizah b’peh — loosely translated as oral suction — is the part of the circumcision ceremony where the mohel removes the blood from the baby’s member; these days the removal of the blood is usually done using a sterilized glass tube, instead of with the mouth, as the Talmud suggests.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the practice has become a controversy in both secular and [[Jewish medical ethics]]. The ritual of metzitzah is found in [[Mishnah]] Shabbat 19:2, which lists it as one of the four steps involved in the circumcision rite. The [[Chasam Sofer]] observed that the Talmud states that the rationale for this part of the ritual was hygienic — i.e., to protect the health of the child.  The Chasam Sofer contended that metzitzah with a sponge would accomplish the same purpose as oral suction. His letter was published in Kochvei Yitzchok.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejewishweek.com/top/editletcontent.php3?artid=4591&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Maharam Shik]], a student of the Chasam Sofer, states in his book of Responsa, She’eilos U’teshuvos Maharam Shik (Orach Chaim 152,) that the Chasam Sofer gave the ruling in that specific instance only and that it may not be applied elsewhere. He also states (Yoreh Deah 244) that the practice is possibly a Sinaitic tradition, i.e., [[Halacha l'Moshe m'Sinai]].  

The [[Sdei Chemed]] claimed the practice to be Halacha l'Moshe m'Sinai and  elaborates on what prompted the Chasam Sofer to give the above ruling:.&lt;ref&gt;Sdei Chemed vol.8 page 238&lt;/ref&gt; He tells the story that a student of the Chasam Sofer, [[Lazar Horowitz]], author of Yad Elazer and Chief Rabbi of Vienna at the time, needed the ruling because of a governmental attempt to ban circumcision completely if it included Metztitzah b'peh. He therefore asked the Chasam Sofer to give him permission to do Brit milah without metzitzah b’peh. When he presented the defense in court, they erroneously recorded his testimony to mean that the Chasam Sofer stated it as a general ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dhengah.org/metzitzah4dummies/metzitzah4dummies.htm Kuntres Hamiliuim]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the risk of infection, some rabbinical authorities have ruled that the traditional practice of direct contact should be replaced by using a glass tube between the wound and the [[mohel]]'s mouth, so there is no direct oral contact. The [[Rabbinical Council of America]], the largest group of [[Modern Orthodox]] rabbis, endorses this method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=100605 Metzitza Be'Peh - Halachic Clarification Regarding Metzitza Be'Peh, RCA Clarifies Halachic Background to Statement of March 1, 2005 ]&lt;/ref&gt;  The RCA paper states: ''&quot;Rabbi Schachter even reports that Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik reports that his father, Rav Moshe Soloveitchik, would not permit a mohel to perform metzitza be’peh with direct oral contact, and that his grandfather, Rav Chaim Soloveitchik, instructed mohelim in Brisk not to do metzitza be’peh with direct oral contact. However, although Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik also generally prohibited metzitza be’peh with direct oral contact, he did not ban it by those who insisted upon it,...&quot;.

==Hatafat dam brit==
Circumcision alone, in the absence of the brit milah ceremony, does not fulfill the requirements of the mitzvah. In the case of a Jew who was circumcised outside of a brit milah, or an already-circumcised convert, the mohel draws a symbolic drop of blood from the penis.

A brit milah is not considered complete unless blood is actually drawn. This is not the intentional spilling of blood. The standard medical methods of [[circumcision]] through constriction do not meet the requirements of the [[halakhah]] for brit milah, because they cause [[hemostasis]], ''i.e.'', they stop the flow of blood. A brit milah, to be conducted properly, requires the use of a specialized surgical knife, called an ''[[wiktionary:izmel|izmel]]'', which does allow for ''dam brit''.

Unlike the traditional Jewish method, when circumcision is performed by a [[urologist]] or other surgeon the foreskin is removed by constriction, either with the use of clamps or a synthetic ring.  This non-Jewish method works by crushing the skin until it is severed. The nerve endings and the blood vessels are severed in the same manner, causing pain and hemostasis.

The expressly ritual element of circumcision in Judaism, as distinguished from its non-ritual requirement in [[Islam]], is shown by the requirement that a child who either is born [[Aposthia|aposthetic]] (without a foreskin) or who has been circumcised without the ritual must nevertheless undergo a ''Brit milah'' in which a drop of blood (''hatafat-dam'', הטפת דם) is drawn from the penis at the point where the foreskin would have been or was attached.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulchan Aruch]], [[Yoreh De'ah]], 263:4&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Milah l'shem giur''==
{{Judaism}}
A ''Milah L'shem giur'' is a &quot;Circumcision for the purpose of conversion&quot;. In [[Orthodox Judaism]], this procedure is usually done by adoptive parents for adopted boys who are being converted as part of the adoption or by families with young children converting together. The conversion of a minor is valid in both [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] until a child reaches the age of majority (13 for a boy, 12 for a girl); at that time the child has the option of renouncing his conversion and Judaism, and the conversion will then be considered retroactively invalid. He must be informed of his right to renounce his conversion if he wishes. If he does not make such a statement it is accepted that the boy is halakhically Jewish. [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbis will generally not convert a non-Jewish child raised by a mother who has not converted to Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Paysach J. Krohn, ''Bris Milah'' [[Artscroll|Mesorah Publications Ltd]], 1985, pp.103-105&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws of conversion and conversion-related circumcision in [[Orthodox Judaism]] have numerous complications, and authorities recommend that a rabbi be consulted well in advance.

In [[Conservative Judaism]], the Milah l'Shem giur procedure is also performed for a boy whose mother has not converted, but with the intention that the child be raised Jewish.  This conversion of a child to Judaism without the conversion of the mother is allowed by [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] interpretations of [[halakha]]. Conservative Rabbis will authorize it only under the condition that the child be raised as a Jew in a single-faith household. Should the mother convert, and if the boy has not yet reached his third birthday, the child may be immersed in the [[mikveh]] with the mother, after the mother has already immersed, to become Jewish.  If the mother does not convert, the child may be immersed in a mikveh, or body of natural waters, to complete the child's conversion to Judaism. This can be done before the child is even one year old. If the child did not immerse in the [[mikveh]], or the boy was too old, then the child may choose of their own accord to become Jewish at age 13 as a [[Bar Mitzvah]], and complete the conversion then.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19861990/reisner_conversion.pdf Rabbi Avram Israel Reisner, On the conversion of adoptive and patrilineal children, [[Rabbinical Assembly]] [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]], 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

*The ceremony, when performed l'Shem giur, does not have to be performed on a particular day, and does not override [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish Holidays]].[http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/212,657813/Can-a-brit-take-place-on-Yom-Kippur.html] [http://www.ahavat-israel.com/torat/britmila.php]
*In Orthodox Judaism, there is a split of authorities on whether the child receives a [[Hebrew name]] at the Brit ceremony or upon immersion in the [[Mikvah]]. According to ''Zichron Brit LeRishonim'', naming occurs at the Brit with a different formula than the standard Brit Milah. The more common practice among [[Ashkenazic]] Jews follows Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], with naming occurring at immersion.

Where the procedure was performed but not followed by immersion or other requirements of the conversion procedure (e.g., in [[Conservative Judaism]], where the mother has not converted), if the boy chooses to complete the conversion at [[Bar Mitzvah]], a ''Milah l'shem giur'' performed when the boy was an infant removes the obligation to undergo either a full brit milah or ''hatafat dam brit''.

==Reasons for circumcision==

In ''Of the Special Laws, Book 1'', the Jewish philosopher [[Philo]] (20 BC - AD 50) gives six reasons for the practice of circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  He attributes four of the reasons to &quot;men of divine spirit and wisdom&quot;.  These include the idea that circumcision 1) protects against disease, 2) secures cleanliness &quot;in a way that is suited to the people consecrated to God&quot;, 3) causes the circumcised portion of the penis to resemble a heart, thereby representing a physical connection between the &quot;breath contained within the heart [that] is generative of thoughts, and the generative organ itself [that] is productive of living beings&quot;, and 4) promotes prolificness by removing impediments to the flow of semen.  To these, Philo added two of his own reasons, including the idea that circumcision 5) &quot;signified figuratively the excision of all superfluous and excessive pleasure&quot; and 6) &quot;that it is a symbol of a man's knowing himself&quot;.

[[Saadia Gaon|Rabbi Saadia Gaon]] considers something to be 'complete', if it lacks nothing, but also has nothing that is unneeded. He regards the foreskin an unneeded organ that God created in man, and so by amputating it, the man is completed.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Maimonides]] (Moses ben Maimon &quot;Rambam&quot;, CE 1135-1204), who apart from being a great Torah scholar was also a physician and philosopher, argued that circumcision acts to repress sexual pleasure and serves as a common bodily sign to members of the same faith.&lt;ref&gt;

The author of [[Sefer ha-Chinuch]]&lt;ref&gt;2nd commandment&lt;/ref&gt; provides three reasons for the practice of circumcision:
#To complete the form of man, by removing what he claims to be a redundant organ;
#To mark the chosen people, so their body will be different as their soul is; The organ chosen for the mark is the one responsible for the sustenance of the species.
#Said completion isn't congenital, but left to the man. This implies, that as he completes the form of his body, so can he complete the form of his soul.
 
Talmud professor [[Daniel Boyarin]] offered two explanations for circumcision.  One is that it is a literal inscription on the Jewish body of the name of God in the form of the letter &quot;yud&quot; (from &quot;yesod&quot;).  The second is that the act of bleeding represents a feminization of Jewish men, significant in the sense that the covenant represents a marriage between Jews and (a symbolically male) God.&lt;ref&gt;Boyarin, Daniel. &quot;`This We Know to Be the Carnal Israel': Circumcision and the Erotic Life of God and Israel,&quot; Critical Inquiry.

The leaders of Reform Judaism in early nineteenth century Germany at first rejected circumcision, claiming it to be 'barbaric'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/The_Origins_of_Reform_Judaism.html ''The Origins of Reform Judaism'', The American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise], 2010 (retrieved November 11, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1871, rabbinic leadership in the German Reform Movement reasserted &quot;the supreme importance of circumcision in Judaism&quot;, though those who had not been circumcised would continue to be considered as Jews. Although the issue of circumcision of converts continues to be debated, the necessity of Brit Milah for Jewish infant boys has been stressed in every subsequent Reform rabbis manual or guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, the connection of the Reform movement to an anti-circumcision, pro-symbolic stance is a historical one. From the early days of the movement in Germany, some classical Reformers hoped to replace ritual circumcision &quot;with a symbolic act, as has been done for other bloody practices, such as the sacrifices.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jacob (1998) Divine Law in Human Hands: Case Studies in Halakhic Flexibility. Jerusalem: Hebrew University ISBN 978-9652239808&lt;/ref&gt;   As a result, many European Jewish fathers during the nineteenth century chose not to circumcise their sons, including [[Theodore Herzl]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Desmond (1974) Theodore  Herzl. New York: Doubleday ISBN 978-0385088961&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, an official Reform resolution in 1893 abolished circumcision for converts,&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Michael &quot;''Berit Mila'' within the History  of the Reform Movement&quot; in Barth, Lewis (1990) ''Berit Mila'' in the Reform Context. New York: Berit Milah Board of reform Judaism&lt;/ref&gt; and this ambivalence towards the practice has carried over to classical-minded Reform Jews today. In Rabbi Elyse Wechterman's essay ''A Plea for Inclusion'', she argues that, even in the absence of circumcision, committed Jews should never be turned away, especially by a movement &quot;where no other ritual observance is mandated&quot;. She goes on to advocate for an alternate covenant ceremony, ''brit atifah'', for both boys and girls as a welcoming ritual into Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Mark, Elizabeth Wyner (2003) The Covenant of Circumcision. Lebanon, NH: Brandeis ISBN 1-58465-307-8&lt;/ref&gt; With a continuing negativity towards circumcision still present within a minority of modern-day Reform, Judaic scholar Jon Levenson has warned that if they &quot;continue to judge ''brit milah'' to be not only medically unnecessary but also brutalizing and mutilating...the abhorrence of it expressed by some early Reform leaders will return with a vengeance&quot;, proclaiming that circumcision will be &quot;the latest front in the battle over the Jewish future in America.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Levenson, Jon (March 2000) &quot;The New Enemies of Circumcision&quot;, ''Commentary''&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it has &quot;remained a central rite&quot; in Reform Judaism,&lt;ref name=&quot;origin-reform&quot;&gt;{{cite web

'''Business ethics''' (also known as '''corporate ethics''') is a form of [[applied ethics]] or [[professional ethics]] that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that arise in a business environment. It applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations.

Business ethics has both [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] and descriptive dimensions. As a corporate practice and a career specialization, the field is primarily normative. Academics attempting to understand business behavior employ descriptive methods. The range and quantity of business ethical issues reflects the interaction of profit-maximizing behavior with non-economic concerns.
Interest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s, both within major corporations and within academia. For example, today most major corporations promote their commitment to non-economic values under headings such as ethics codes and social responsibility charters.
Adam Smith said, &quot;People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A (1776/ 1952) An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Governments use laws and regulations to point business behavior in what they perceive to be beneficial directions. Ethics implicitly regulates areas and details of behavior that lie beyond governmental control.&lt;ref&gt;Berle, A. A., &amp; Means, G. C. (1932). The Modern Corporation and Private Property. New Jersey: Transaction Publishers. In this book, Berle and Means observe, &quot;Corporations have ceased to be merely legal devices through which the private business transactions of individuals may be carried on. Though still much used for this purpose, the corporate form has acquired a much larger significance. The corporation has, in fact, become both a method of property tenure and a means of organizing economic life. Grown to tremendous proportions, there may be said to have evolved a 'corporate system'&amp;mdash;as there once was a feudal system&amp;mdash;which has attracted to itself a combination of attributes and powers, and has attained a degree of prominence entitling it to be dealt with as a major social institution. […] We are examining this institution probably before it has attained its zenith. Spectacular as its rise has been, every indication seems to be that the system will move forward to proportions which stagger imagination today […] They [management] have placed the community in a position to demand that the modern corporation serve not only the owners […] but all society.&quot; p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of large corporations with limited relationships and sensitivity to the communities in which they operate accelerated the development of formal ethics regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|Parker|et al.|2005|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Business ethical norms reflect the norms of each historical period. As time passed, those norms evolved, and many behaviors that were once generally accepted became objectionable. Business ethics and the resulting behavior evolved as well. Business was involved in [[slavery]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4471479045063533294&amp;hl=en# Slavery and the Making of America&amp;mdash;Episode 1]. Video.google.com.

NBER Working Paper No. 15981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The article [http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/focusareas/business/conference/presentations/business-ethics-history.html A History of Business Ethics] by Richard T. De George of Santa Clara University (web page version of DeGeorge, Richard. 2005, &quot;History of Business Ethics&quot;, paper delivered at &quot;The Accountable Corporation&quot;, the third biennial global business conference sponsored by the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University) as availed on March 30, 2010– observes, on the origin of business ethics discourse, &quot; The Second World War was over, the Cold War was ever present, and the War in Viet Nam fostered a good deal of opposition to official public policy and to the so-called military-industrial complex, which came in for increasing scrutiny and criticism. The Civil Rights movement had caught the public imagination. The United States was becoming more and more of a dominant economic force. American-based multinational corporations were growing in size and importance. Big business was coming into its own, replacing small and medium-sized businesses in the societal image of business. The chemical industry was booming with innovation, and in its wake came environmental damage on a scale that had not previously been possible. The spirit of protest led to the environmental movement, to the rise of consumerism, and to criticism of multinational corporations....Corporations, finding themselves under public attack and criticism, responded by developing the notion of social responsibility. They started social responsibility programs and spent a good deal of money advertising their programs and how they were promoting the social good. Exactly what &quot;social responsibility&quot; meant varied according to the industry and company&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'business ethics' came into common use in the United States in the early 1970s. By the mid-1980s at least 500 courses in business ethics reached 40,000 students, using some twenty textbooks and at least ten casebooks along supported by professional societies, centers and journals of business ethics. The Society for Business Ethics was started in 1980. European business schools adopted business ethics after 1987 commencing with the European Business Ethics Network (EBEN).&lt;ref&gt;Richard T.

Well-known companies with four or more convictions included Braniff International, Gulf Oil, and Ashland Oil. Firms with at least two convictions included Allied, American Airlines, Bethlehem Steel, Diamond International, Firestone, Goodyear, International Paper, National Distillers, Northrop, Occidental Petroleum, Pepsico, Phillips Petroleum, R.J. Reynolds, Schlitz, Seagram, Tenneco, and United Brands. The recent Union Carbide disaster in Bhopal is well-known, as is the E.F. Hutton fiasco, the General Dynamics fraud, and of course, the Wall Street scandals involving Ivan Boesky, David Levine, and Michael Milken... Unethical behaviour in business more often than not is a systematic matter. To a large degree it is the behaviour of generally decent people who normally would not think of doing anything illegal or immoral. But they get backed into doing something unethical by the systems and practices of their own firms and industries. Unethical behaviour in business generally arises when business firms fail to pay explicitly attention to the ethical risks that are created by their own systems and practices.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 the first single-authored books in the field appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Richard De George, Business Ethics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manuel G. Velasquez, Business Ethics: Concepts and Cases.&lt;/ref&gt;

Firms started highlighting their ethical stature in the late 1980s and early 1990s, possibly trying to distance themselves from the business scandals of the day, such as the [[savings and loan crisis]].

==Overview==
Business ethics reflects the [[philosophy of business]], one of whose aims is to determine the fundamental purposes of a company. If a company's purpose is to maximize shareholder returns, then sacrificing profits to other concerns is a violation of its [[fiduciary responsibility]]. Corporate entities are legally considered as persons in USA and in most nations. The 'corporate persons' are legally entitled to the rights and liabilities due to citizens as persons.

Economist Milton Friedman writes that corporate executives' &quot;responsibility... generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to their basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom&quot;.&lt;ref name=mf1970&gt;{{Cite news

A business cannot have responsibilities. So the question is, do corporate executives, provided they stay within the law, have responsibilities in their business activities other than to make as much money for their stockholders as possible? And my answer to that is, no, they do not.&quot;&lt;ref name=mf1970/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, M.

Another view of business is that it must exhibit [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR): an umbrella term indicating that an ethical business must act as a responsible citizen of the communities in which it operates even at the cost of profits or other goals.&lt;ref&gt;Pinnington, A.

[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=204528 The End of History for Corporate Law]. Georgetown Law Journal(89), 439–468. The article says, &quot;All thoughtful people believe that corporate enterprise should be organized and operated to serve the interests of society as a whole, and that the interests of shareholders deserve no greater weight in this social calculus than do the interests of any other members of society.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, K.

Chicago: The University of Chicago Press ISBN 0-226-30693-3. Greenfield observes, &quot;what is good for shareholders is good for corporations, and what is good for corporations is good for society....If this connection existed, the shareholder bandwagon would be attractive indeed. The problem is that advocates for shareholder primacy do not purport to say how the connection occurs or test whether the connection is true. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|Parker|et al.|2005|p=5}} observe, &quot;when a company with shareholders gives some of the profits it has made to investors who have not been involved in producing the value, this is seen as a reward for risk. But why should the surplus generated by workers be given to someone else who almost certainly already has a lot of money in the first place?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In the US and most other nations corporate entities are legally treated as persons in some respects. For example, they can hold title to property, sue and be sued and are subject to taxation, although their [[free speech]] rights are limited. This can be interpreted to imply that they have independent ethical responsibilities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Duska argues that stakeholders have the right to expect a business to be ethical; if business has no ethical obligations, other institutions could make the same claim which would be counterproductive to the corporation.&lt;ref name=Duska/&gt;

Ethical issues include the rights and duties between a company and its [[stakeholder concept|employees, suppliers, customers and neighbors]], its [[fiduciary]] responsibility to its [[shareholder concept|shareholders]]. Issues concerning relations between different companies include [[takeover|hostile take-overs]] and [[industrial espionage]]. Related issues include [[corporate governance]];[[Corporate Social Entrepreneurship|corporate social entrepreneurship]]; [[Campaign finance reform|political contributions]]; legal issues such as the ethical debate over introducing a crime of [[corporate manslaughter]]; and the marketing of corporations' ethics policies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

====Finance paradigm====
&lt;!--&quot;finance paradigm&quot; needs a definition --&gt;
[[Aristotle]] said, &quot;the end and purpose of the polis is the good life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle 1948 Politics E. Barker, trans. Oxford: Clarendon, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Smith]] characterized the good life in terms of material goods and intellectual and moral excellences of character.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1759|p=VI.i.15}}{{Dead link|date=March 2011|There is no Book VI!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith in his ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' commented, &quot;All for ourselves, and nothing for other people, seems, in every age of the world, to have been the vile maxim of the masters of mankind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1759|p=III.iv.448}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Wikiquote|Adam Smith}} However, a section of economists influenced by the ideology of [[neoliberalism]], interpreted the objective of economics to be maximization of [[economic growth]] through accelerated [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] and [[Manufacturing|production]] of [[goods and services]].&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, W.S. 1970 The Theory of Political Economy. Harmondsworth: Penguin. Jevons observes, &quot;The theory…is entirely based on a calculus of pleasure and pain: the object of economics is to maximize happiness by purchasing pleasure, as it were, at the lowest cost of pain&quot; (Jevons, 1970:91). Jevons also noted, &quot;The strength of preferences for a good, measured by individuals' willingness to pay for their satisfaction at the margin, is an indirect measure of subjective states: it is from the quantitative effects of the feelings that we must estimate their comparative amounts&quot; (Jevons, 1970:83). O'Neil on the other hand points out that the ideologists of neoliberalism &quot;do not claim to prove that markets maximize well-being. Rather they claim to show that in certain 'ideal' conditions the market will issue in a state of equilibrium, defined as a state in which, so long as individuals' preferences and productive resources remain the same, any departure from that state will involve a welfare change for the worse for some party, in the sense that a previously satisfied preference will no longer be satisfied. {{harvnb|O'Neill|1998|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neoliberal ideology promoted finance from its position as a component of economics to its core.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Proponents of the ideology hold that unrestricted financial flows, if redeemed from the shackles of &quot;financial repressions&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Montiel, P.

By the phrase 'financial repression', Montiel refers to the monitoring and regulations on capital inﬂows and outﬂows, regulations on free entry and exit of national and international financial institutions, the presence of state run financial institutions, stipulations on cash reserve ratio or liquidity ratio, interest rate ceilings, guidelines regarding priority sector financing, and other measures of monitory regulations.&lt;/ref&gt; best help impoverished nations to grow.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The theory holds that open financial systems accelerate economic growth by encouraging foreign capital inﬂows, thereby enabling higher levels of savings, investment, employment, productivity and &quot;welfare&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The total amount of welfare understood as preference satisfaction over dissatisfaction appears to be remarkably static in modern market societies. There appears to be little evidence of any growth in the gap between preference satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Quoting from Lane, he points out, &quot;The assumed positive relationship between markets and wellbeing understood as preference satisfaction is not confirmed by empirical evidence… Indeed, the fact that there is no increase in preference satisfaction over dissatisfaction no longer entails immediately that there is no increase in welfare. Not all dissatisfaction is a sign of a life that has taken a turn for the worse. Indeed, it can indicate the opposite, that a person is exercising capacities that are part of what it is for a life to be improving. Consider a pianist, who starts being greatly satisfied with her initial developments, but who, as she continues to develop technically and artistically, becomes ever more critical of her performance. Her increasing dissatisfaction is a symptom of increasing accomplishment. Or again consider the contented slave, wage earner or housewife who become discontented with their lot: it is better for them that this is so and not just in virtue of other possible improvements this might bring. This is an old point.&quot; {{harvnb|O'Neill|1998|pp=56–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with containing corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Schaler, J. A. Corruption.{{harvnb|Hamowy|Kuznicki|Steelman|2008 |pp=105–107}} What the libertarians consider as corruption is interesting. The author concludes abruptly, &quot;if we reduce what the government does, we also will reduce corruption…. It also may offer a way to identify and understand the moral decline that follows (and fosters) the continual expansion of the welfare state.(p. 107). However, the author is reluctant to admit that private individual/ firm corruption. For instance, he writes, &quot;Paying money for goods or services provided by a public official constitutes bribery and often involves punishment for the parties to the transaction. Why bribery is invariably equated with corruption and condemned? It is not obviously inefficient. Indeed, in highly collectivized nations, paying public officials to allow what would otherwise be normal market exchanges may contribute much to human welfare. (p. 105). He continues, &quot;These standard accounts of corruption and bribery involve efficiency and democratic accountability, not liberty&quot;... &quot;In some cases, government actions that are particularly prone to bribery—like the licensing of economic activity—inherently restrict individual liberty&quot;… &quot;It is possible that bribery might liberalize some parts of society&quot;... However, he presents &quot;in the financing of election campaigns&quot; individuals and groups are simply &quot;contributing to the campaigns of chosen candidates&quot; and observes, &quot;Campaign finance regulations, like the corruption they seek to prevent, actually serve the narrow interests of parties and incumbents instead of the interest voters have in open competition for legislative seats. Thus, campaign finance restrictions may be deemed a kind of corruption&quot;. He further points out, &quot;However, as Nathaniel Persily discovered, campaign finance appears to have no real relationship one way or the other to trust in government. In any case, public trust in government tends to reduce, rather than protect, individual liberty (p. 106). In his statement on the primacy of liberty he argues, &quot;But libertarians might recognize that corruption may be more than an excuse to limit liberty&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Neoliberals recommended that governments open their financial systems to the global market with minimal regulation over capital flows.&lt;ref&gt;The neoclassical economists of the first generation in the early 70s, while the impoverished world was still struggling to recover from the adverse effects of the second world war and the consequent cold wars, recommended deregulation of financial systems of the impoverished nations which they termed liberating financial systems from the 'financial repression'. Chili, Uruguay and Argentina were chosen to be the labs of financial experiments. Contrary to the claims the countries experienced severe economic and financial setbacks of soaring interest rates, waves of bank failures and other bankruptcies, extreme asset price volatility and extensive loan defaults, the real sector entered deep and prolonged recessions contrary to what had been projected by the ideologues (Grabel, I., 2008).

Dobson observes, &quot;a rational agent is simply one who pursues personal material advantage ad infinitum. In essence, to be rational in finance is to be individualistic, materialistic, and competitive. Business is a game played by individuals, as with all games the object is to win, and winning is measured in terms solely of material wealth. Within the discipline this rationality concept is never questioned, and has indeed become the theory-of-the-firm's sine qua non&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobson|1997|p=ix}} &quot;Experts of finance tend to view business firm as, 'an abstract engine that uses money today to make money tomorrow'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1086/296380|author=Miller, M. H. |year=1986|title=Behavioral Rationality in Finance: The Case of Dividends|journal=Journal of Business|volume=59|pages=451–468|format=p. 452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial ethics is in this view a mathematical function of shareholder wealth. Such simplifying assumptions were once necessary for the construction of mathematically robust models.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobson|1997|p=xvi}} In this regard Dobson points out, &quot;An apologist for the finance paradigm might defend its conceptual rigidity as follows. Although there are undoubtedly motivations other than wealth maximization that influence, and should influence, behaviour, the assumptions of the finance paradigm provide a reasonable approximation of agents' behaviour over a broad spectrum of business environments. The firm is an economic mechanism and agents act within the firm for fundamentally economic reasons. In addition, the construction of mathematically robust models requires simplifying assumptions. Like perfect-and-frictionless capital markets, wealth maximization is one such simplifying assumption. All disciplines have their conceptual boundaries, and any value-based normative consideration of human behaviour simply lies beyond finance's conceptual boundary. Indeed, if finance were to stretch this boundary in an attempt to encompass such questions, mathematical rigor would be lost. Finance would be set adrift in the scientifically unnavigable sea of moral philosophy. Wealth maximization provides a secure anchorage from which a rigorous theory of financial-market behaviour can be built. Says Norman Bowie, &quot;Like perfect information and zero transaction costs, psychological egoism [i.e., wealth maximization] is one of the simplifying assumptions needed for the mathematics of equilibrium analysis&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However [[signalling (economics)|signalling theory]] and [[Principal-agent problem|agency theory]] extended the paradigm to greater realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobson|1997|pp=xvi, 142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such power is the ability to make what one wants actually happen. When a worker wants to keep a job but the owner does not want to employ him or her, the worker loses out, usually, although on a larger scale this doesn't hold true. Of course, if the worker wants to quit, he or she will win, but that is often the less visible situation. Just consider the worry about downsizing. It is also often true that employers are able to find replacements for workers more readily than workers can ﬁnd new jobs on their own terms. Even when this is not the case, the worker's situation is deemed to be more dire because of the often greater wealth of the employer. Whether this imbalance of bargaining power is justiﬁed or not is what ultimately must be addressed by those who believe that there is greater merit in a free market system than in one that is regimented by government&amp;mdash;say, via a workers' democracy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Machan|2007|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Marketing ethics}}

Marketing Ethics came of age only as late as 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy|2002|pp=165–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing ethics was approached from ethical perspectives of virtue or [[virtue ethics]], [[deontology]], [[consequentialism]], pragmatism and relativism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|Parker|et al.|2005|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy|2002|pp=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethics in marketing deals with the principles, values and/or ideals by which marketers (and marketing institutions) ought to act.&lt;ref&gt;Brenkert, G. K.

According to Borgerson, and Schroeder (2008), marketing can influence individuals' perceptions of and interactions with other people, implying an ethical responsibility to avoid distorting those perceptions and interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Borgerson, J.

Marketing ethics involves pricing practices, including illegal actions such as [[price fixing]] and legal actions including [[price discrimination]] and [[price skimming]]. Certain promotional activities have drawn fire, including  [[greenwash]]ing, [[bait and switch]], [[shill]]ing, [[viral marketing]], [[spam (electronic)]], [[pyramid scheme]]s and [[multi-level marketing]]. Advertising has raised objections about [[attack ad]]s, [[subliminal message]]s, [[sex in advertising]] and [[marketing in schools]].

===Production===
This area of business ethics usually deals with the duties of a company to ensure that products and production processes do not needlessly cause harm. Since few goods and services can be produced and consumed with zero risk, determining the ethical course can be problematic. In some case consumers demand products that harm them, such as [[tobacco]] products. Production may have environmental impacts, including [[pollution]], [[habitat destruction]] and [[urban sprawl]]. The downstream effects of technologies [[nuclear power]], [[genetically modified food]] and [[mobile phone]]s may not be well understood. While the [[precautionary principle]] may prohibit introducing new technology whose consequences are not fully understood, that principle would have prohibited most new technology introduced since the [[industrial revolution]]. Product testing protocols have been attacked for violating the rights of both [[clinical trials|humans]] and [[animal testing|animals]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Property===
{{Main|Private property||Property rights}}

The etymological root of property is  the [[Latin]] 'proprius'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=property Online Etymology Dictionary]. Etymonline.com. Retrieved on 2010-09-02.&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to 'nature', 'quality', 'one's own', 'special characteristic', 'proper', 'intrinsic', 'inherent', 'regular', 'normal', 'genuine', 'thorough, complete, perfect' etc. The word property is value loaded and associated with the personal qualities of propriety and respectability, also implies questions relating to ownership. A 'proper' person owns and is true to herself or himself, and is thus genuine, perfect and pure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2007 |p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern history of property rights====
Modern discourse on property emerged by the turn of 17th century within theological discussions of that time. For instance, [[John Locke]] justified [[property rights]] saying that God had made &quot;the earth, and all inferior creatures, [in] common to all men&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John (1690),[http://www.constitution.org/jl/2ndtr05.htm Sec. 25 Of Property (chapter 5)], in [[The Second Treatise on Government]]: &quot;God, who hath given the world to men in common, hath also given them reason to make use of it to the best advantage of life, and convenience. The earth, and all that is therein, is given to men for the support and comfort of their being. And tho' all the fruits it naturally produces, and beasts it feeds, belong to mankind in common, as they are produced by the spontaneous hand of nature; and no body has originally a private dominion, exclusive of the rest of mankind, in any of them, as they are thus in their natural state: yet being given for the use of men, there must of necessity be a means to appropriate them some way or other, before they can be of any use, or at all beneficial to any particular man. The fruit, or venison, which nourishes the wild Indian, who knows no enclosure, and is still a tenant in common, must be his, and so his, i.e. a part of him, that another can no longer have any right to it, before it can do him any good for the support of his life.&quot; He continues in sec.27, &quot;Though the earth, and all inferior creatures, be common to all men, yet every man has a property in his own person: this nobody has any right to but himself. The labour of his body, and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property. It being by him removed from the common state nature hath placed it in, it hath by this labour something annexed to it, that excludes the common right of other men: for this labour being the unquestionable property of the labourer, no man but he can have a right to what that is once joined to, at least where there is enough, and as good, left in common for others.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, J.W. (1996), &quot;Who owns My Body&quot;, Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, 16: 55–84. Harris finds this argument a 'spectacular non sequitur,' '[f]rom the fact that nobody owns me if I am not a slave, it simply does not follow that I must own myself'(p. 71)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Day Patrick, (2002) [http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/philn/philn019.pdf The Self-Ownership Thesis: A Critique]. Locke founded his notion of property rights on the premise of 'self-ownership' of course excluding the slaves from such ownership. Day critiques Locke's ontology saying, &quot;The answer to the question is to be found in Locke's ontology. There exist God, Divine Artifacts and Human Artifacts. God owns Himself. All makers own what they have made, so that God also owns Divine Artifacts. There are Direct Divine Artifacts and Indirect Divine Artifacts. The unique Direct Divine Artifact is Land, which God made out of nothing. He made Indirect Divine Artifacts by mingling His Labour with Land. Among these are wild plants, wild animals and Man (Adam and his descendants). God gave Land 'and all inferior creatures' 'to men in common'&quot; (Day, 2002:)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/2218464|author=Day, P.

(1931), Theory of Legislation, London: Kegan Paul, p. 113 ISBN 978-1-103-20150-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon in his essay on property asked, &quot;If property is a natural, absolute, imprescriptible, and inalienable right, why, in all ages, has there been so much preoccupation with its origin? For this is one of its distinguishing characteristics. The origin of a natural right: Good God, whoever inquired into the origin of the rights of liberty, security, or equality?&quot; Proudhon, P.-J.

One argument for property ownership is that it enhances individual liberty by extending the line of non-interference by the state or others around the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2007 |p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seen from this perspective, property right is absolute and property has a special and distinctive character that precedes its legal protection. Blackstone conceptualized property as the &quot;sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, W. (1766), [http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-201.htm Commentaries on the Laws of England, Volume II, Of the Rights of Things], Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Slaves as property=====
During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, slavery spread to European colonies including America, where colonial legislatures defined the legal status of slaves as a form of property.&lt;ref&gt;Ely, J. W. (2008). The Guardian of Every Other Right. Oxford: Oxford University Press ISBN 0-19-532332-7. Ely notes, 'In 1740 South Carolina declared slaves &quot;to be chattels personal, in the hands of their owners and possessors ' Because slaves were property, they could be purchased, sold, inherited, taxed, or seized to pay the master's debts… The slave codes also minutely governed the slaves' activities, prohibiting them from assembling, running away, owning goods or livestock, or using ﬁ rearms. Moreover, it was unlawful to sell liquor to slaves or to teach them to read and write. Finally, crimes committed by slaves received harsher punishment than did equivalent offenses by free persons (p. 15).&lt;/ref&gt; During this time settlers began the centuries-long process of dispossessing the natives of America of millions of acres of land.&lt;ref&gt;Wishart, D. J. (1994). [http://books.google.com/books?id=TgLHoEwA0fgC&amp;printsec=frontcover An Unspeakable Sadness The Dispossession of the Nebraska Indians]. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press ISBN 0-8032-9795-5&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, the natives lost about {{convert|200000|sqmi|km2}} of land in the [[Louisiana Territory]] under the leadership of [[Thomas Jefferson]], who championed property rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://westgatehouse.com/art263.html &quot;Jefferson's Instructions to Lewis, June 20, 1803&quot;] Letters of the Lewis and Clark Expedition with Related Documents, 17831854, ed. Donald Jackson (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1978) 1: 6166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robertson|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael, J. (2008). [http://books.google.com/books?id=rKVwqZIs2OkC&amp;pg=PA45 Identity and the Failure of America. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press]. Michael observes that Thomas Jefferson, in spite of all his freedom speeches, was himself a slave owner, owning slaves as his property, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined with theological justification, property was taken to be essentially natural ordained by God.&lt;ref&gt;In this regards Ross (1994:14) notes, &quot;within the liberal context the private nature of property is naturalized and universalized, as though other forms are somehow less ethically defensible&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Property, which later gained meaning as ownership and appeared natural to Locke, Jefferson and to many of the 18th and 19th century intellectuals&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1994|p=58}} Rose observes, &quot;What is the purpose of property under this . . . understanding? The purpose is to accord to each person or entity what is 'proper' or 'appropriate' to him or her. Indeed, this understanding of property historically made no strong distinction between 'property' and 'propriety', and one finds the terminology mixed up to a very considerable degree in historical texts. And what is 'proper' or appropriate, on this vision of property, is that which is needed to keep good order in the commonwealth or body politic&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; as land, labour or idea&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson wrote, &quot;[W]hile it is a moot question whether the origin of any kind of property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular to admit a natural and even an hereditary right to inventors. It is agreed by those who have seriously considered the subject, that no individual has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre of land, for instance. By an universal law, indeed, whatever, whether ﬁxed or movable, belongs to all men equally and in common, is the property for the moment of him who occupies it, but when he relinquishes the occupation, the property goes with it. Stable ownership is the gift of social law, and is given late in the progress of society. It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed in exclusive and stable property.&quot; [http://books.google.com/books?id=Imn6yQjcfZIC&amp;pg=PA19 Jeferrson's Letter to McPherson] in, Boyle, J.

The rendition of escaped slaves was also a priority for southerners. Accordingly, the fugitive slave clause declared that persons held to service or labor under state law &quot;shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due.&quot; (Ely, 2008:46)&lt;/ref&gt; Wiecek noted, &quot;slavery was more clearly and explicitly established under the Constitution as it had been under the Articles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wiecek, W.

Taney]] in his 1857 judgment stated, &quot;The right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution&quot;.

====Natural right vs social construct====

Digitalhistory.uh.edu. Retrieved on 2010-09-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Davies counters with &quot;property is no different from other legal categories in that it is simply a consequence of the significance attached by law to the relationships between legal persons.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies 2007 20&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2007 |p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Property is something we must collectively define and construct. It is not given to us whole; it does not emerge fully formed like Athena from Zeus's head. It is closer to a piece of music that unfolds over time. Like music, property gets its sense of stability from the ongoing creation and resolution of various forms of tension. The tensions that inform property are the tensions inherent in social relations. The solutions to the problems of property conflicts lie in understanding the connection between property and human relationships. Relationships sometimes form stable patterns, but they are also ongoing and constantly renegotiated. cultural norms. It is argued that there is no simple definition of property that can be posited without making controversial value judgments about how to choose between conflicting interests&quot;&amp;mdash;{{harvnb|Singer|2000|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer claims, &quot;Property is a form of power, and the distribution of power is a political problem of the highest order&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singer|2000|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, M.

In the neoliberal literature, property is part of the private side of a public/private dichotomy and acts a counterweight to state power.&lt;!-- need a cite from that literature--&gt; Davies counters that &quot;any space may be subject to plural meanings or appropriations which do not necessarily come into conflict&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Any space may be subject to plural meanings or appropriations which do not necessarily come into conflict: pastoralists and Indigenous people may have quite different understandings of rural landscapes reflected in different types of property interests, which can&amp;mdash;ideally&amp;mdash;coexist legally. A nominally open public space may have 'private' or limited meanings imposed upon it&amp;mdash;for instance religious meanings (Urban spaces such as privately owned but publicly accessible shopping malls are increasingly of a 'quasi'-public nature. At the same time, intrusions of public norms into personal proprietary spaces through, for instance, zoning, heritage, and environmental regulations, militate against seeing 'private' property as entirely private. Social transitions which transgress neat liberal distinctions put the theory under strain in key points: where the owners of a quasi-public space like a shopping mall try to enforce a dress code or standards of behaviour, private proprietorial power intrudes into the public sphere {{harvnb|Davies|2007|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private property has never been a universal doctrine, although since the end of the Cold War is it has become nearly so. Some societies, e.g., Native American bands, held land, if not all property, in common. When groups came into conflict, the victor often [[Indian Removal Act|appropriated]] the loser's property.&lt;ref&gt;AJ van der Walt notes, &quot;forced removals and the restrictions upon free movement and economic activity that accompanied state-enforced racial segregation, helped to secure [[white privilege]] while at the same time politically and economically marginalising millions of black South Africans.

M'Intosh]]. Johnson contained the &quot;[[discovery doctrine]], which answered the question: What rights did Europeans acquire, and indigenous peoples lose, upon the discovery of the New World? The answer, according to the Court, was ownership of all discovered lands. Discovery converted the indigenous owners of discovered lands into tenants on those lands. The underlying title belonged to the discovering sovereign. The indigenous occupants were free to sell their &quot;lease,&quot; but only to the landlord, and they were subject to eviction at any time. More than 180 years later, the discovery doctrine is still the law&quot;. {{harvnb|Robertson|2005|pp=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethics of property rights begins with recognizing the vacuous nature of the notion of property.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The [[legal realism|legal realists]] understood property rights as relationships only in the formal sense. They acknowledged that rights impose duties on others and that liberties impose vulnerabilities on those affected by the exercise of those liberties. In deciding whether those duties and those vulnerabilities were fair, they suggested that lawmakers balance the interests of those harmed by entitlements against those who benefit from them. This balancing solution did not take seriously the idea that legal rules both respond to and shape the contours of social relations. They did not, in other words, take the character and structure of social relations as an important independent factor in choosing the rules that govern market life. Economists may similarly fail to give sufficient attention to the moral and customary underpinnings of market societies. The idea of balancing interests is a useful one, but it does not quite get at what is at stake in constructing property law. What is at stake is a vision of social life&quot; {{harvnb|Singer|2000|p=11}} Singer further states, &quot;Problems emerge when abstract property concepts meet the disputes over property that arise between people in the real world. The ownership model fails to acknowledge the substantial limitations on property rights that are necessary to protect the interests of both owners and nonowners harmed by the exercise of those rights. Conflicts among owners are quite prevalent. In some cases one owner's exercise of her lawful property rights interferes with other owners' rights in their own property. We also need to restrict property rights in situations where they impinge on nonproperty rights we hold as dearly&quot;. (p. 31)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual property===
{{main|Intellectual property|Intellectual property rights}}
[[Intellectual property]] (IP) encompasses expressions of ideas, thoughts, codes and information. &quot;[[Intellectual property rights]]&quot; (IPR) treat IP as a kind of [[real property]], subject to analogous protections, rather than as a reproducible good or service. Boldrin and Levine argue that &quot;government does not ordinarily enforce monopolies for producers of other goods. This is because it is widely recognized that monopoly creates many social costs. Intellectual monopoly is no different in this respect. The question we address is whether it also creates social benefits commensurate with these social costs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boldrin|Levine|2008|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International standards relating to Intellectual Property Rights are enforced through [[Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS).&lt;ref&gt;Drahos and Braithwaite write, &quot;When in 1994 we interviewed a former [[US trade negotiator]], he remarked that 'less than 50 individuals' were responsible for TRIPS. Less than 50 individuals had managed to globalize a set of regulatory norms for the conduct of all those doing business or aspiring to do business in the information age&quot; {{harvnb|Drahos|Braithwaite|2002|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, IP other than [[copyright]]s is regulated by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].

The [[US Constitution]] included the power to protect intellectual property, empowering the Federal government &quot;''to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries''&quot;.&lt;ref name=steel&gt;Steelman, A. Intellectual Property.{{harvnb|Hamowy|Kuznicki|Steelman|2008 |pp=249–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boldrin and Levine see no value in such state-enforced monopolies stating, &quot;we ordinarily think of innovative monopoly as an [[oxymoron]].&lt;ref&gt;We shall see that when monopoly over ideas is absent, competition is fierce&amp;mdash;and that, as a result, innovation and creativity thrive. Whatever a world without patents and copyrights would be like, it would not be a world devoid of great new music and beneficial new drugs.&quot; They substantiate their argument by showing instances of key innovation in software industry prior to 1981, before the advent of patent protection … The best evidence that copyright and patents are not needed and that competition leads to thriving innovation in the software industry is the fact that there is a thriving and innovative portion of the industry that has voluntarily relinquished its intellectual monopoly&amp;mdash;both copyright and patent. {{harvnb|Boldrin|Levine|2008|pp=10, 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Välimäki, M. (2005). The Rise of Open Source Licensing: A Challenge to the Use of Intellectual Property in the Software Industry. Helsinki: Turre Publishing ISBN 952-91-8769-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Further they comment, 'intellectual property' &quot;is not like ordinary property at all, but constitutes a government grant of a costly and dangerous private monopoly over ideas. We show through theory and example that intellectual monopoly is not necessary for innovation and as a practical matter is damaging to growth, prosperity, and liberty&quot; .&lt;ref name=steel/&gt; Steelman defends patent monopolies, writing, &quot;Consider prescription drugs, for instance. Such drugs have benefited millions of people, improving or extending their lives. Patent protection enables drug companies to recoup their development costs because for a specific period of time they have the sole right to manufacture and distribute the products they have invented.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamowy|Kuznicki|Steelman|2008 |p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court cases by 39 pharmaceutical companies against [[South Africa]]'s 1997 Medicines and Related Substances Control Amendment Act, which intended to provide affordable HIV medicines has been cited as a harmful effect of patents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://academic.udayton.edu/Health/06world/africa01.htm The South African Medicines and Related Substances Control Amendment Bill and TRIPS].

AIDS, TRIPS and 'TRIPS plus': the case for developing and less developed countries. {{harvnb|Andersen|2006|pp=70–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The authors of the book &quot;Information Feudalism&quot; state: Generally speaking, when a large pharmaceutical company develops a therapeutic compound, it surrounds that compound with a wall of intellectual property protection. Patents are taken out on all aspects of the compound, including the compound itself, dosage methods and processes of making it. Some knowledge is held back and protected under trade-secret law, brand name identity is protected through trade mark law and a lot of written information is protected by copyright. The whole point of building this wall is to ensure that protection lasts well beyond the term of any single patent and keeps cheaper generic manufacturers out of the market for as long as possible. For people in developing countries living on one or two dollars a day, the price of anti-retroviral therapies represented a king's ransom. In some countries such as South Africa, some treatments were in fact more expensive. As an aside we might note that the phenomenon of patented medicines being more expensive in developing countries is not unusual. The logic of patent monopoly is to have a safe and secure distribution system aimed at selling smaller numbers of expensive medicines to a wealthy class, rather than trying to distribute large numbers of cheap medicines at a few cents a day to the many poor. When large pharmaceutical companies speak about 'growing the market' in developing countries, it is the wealthy segment of the market they have in mind&quot; {{harvnb|Drahos|Braithwaite|2002|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Isn't the ethical issue not the existence of patents, but the misuse of them in the above circumstance? --&gt;

One attack on IPR is moral rather than utilitarian, claiming that inventions are mostly a collective, cumulative, path dependent, social creation and therefore, no one person or ﬁrm should be able to monopolize them even for a limited period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersen|2006|pp109–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposing argument is that the benefits of innovation arrive sooner when patents encourage innovators and their investors to increase their commitments. Roderick Long, a [[libertarian]] philosopher, observes, &quot;Ethically, property rights of any kind have to be justified as extensions of the right of individuals to control their own lives.&lt;!-- why is increased autonomy the only basis? --&gt; Thus any alleged property rights that conflict with this moral basis—like the &quot;right&quot; to own slaves—are invalidated. In my judgment, intellectual property rights also fail to pass this test. To enforce copyright laws and the like is to prevent people from making peaceful use of the information they possess.&lt;!--this sounds like the forced appropriation critiqued above--&gt; If you have acquired the information legitimately (say, by buying a book), then on what grounds can you be prevented from using it, reproducing it, trading it?&lt;!--you pay for whatever the author wishes to sell you. As above, don't you have obligations?...--&gt; Is this not a violation of the freedom of speech and press? It may be objected that the person who originated the information deserves ownership rights over it. But information is not a concrete thing an individual can control; it is a universal, existing in other people's minds and other people's property, and over these the originator has no legitimate sovereignty. You cannot own information without owning other people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Long in {{harvnb|Hamowy|Kuznicki|Steelman|2008 |pp=249–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machlup concluded that patents do not have the intended effect of enhancing innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Machlup, F.

Expressing similar concern Fritz Machlup wrote, &quot;It would be irresponsible, on the basis of our present knowledge of its economic consequences, to recommend instituting [a patent system].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Self-declared [[anarchist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], in his 1847 seminal work noted, &quot;Monopoly is the natural opposite of competition,&quot; and continued, &quot;Competition is the vital force which animates the collective being: to destroy it, if such a supposition were possible, would be to kill society&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon (1847), [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/philosophy/ch06.htm Chapter VI] in The Philosophy of Poverty.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Sherman Antitrust Act|Sherman Act]] of 1890, was passed in America to stop rampant cartelization and monopolization in the American economy, followed by the [[Clayton Antitrust Act|Clayton Act]] of 1914, [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] of 1914,[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/usc_sup_01_15_10_2_20_I.html] and the [[Robinson-Patman Act|Anti-Price Discrimination Act]] of 1936.

==Industry-specific concerns==
Health care is one of many industries that have specific ethical concerns. High costs limit access, and unproven therapeutic regimes offer complex trade-offs between access and safety. Patent law is intended to encourage innovation but may further limit access to needed therapies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==International issues==
While business ethics emerged as a field in the 1970s, international business ethics did not emerge until the late 1990s, looking back on the international developments of that decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Georges|last=Enderle|year=1999|title=International Business Ethics|page=1| publisher=[[University of Notre Dame Press]]|isbn= 0-268-01214-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many new practical issues arose out of the international context of business. Theoretical issues such as cultural relativity of ethical values receive more emphasis in this field. Other, older issues can be grouped here as well. Issues and subfields include:
*The search for universal values as a basis for international commercial behaviour.
*Comparison of business ethical traditions in different countries. Also on the basis of their respective GDP and [Corruption rankings].
*Comparison of business ethical traditions from various religious perspectives.
*Ethical issues arising out of international business transactions; e.g., [[bioprospecting]] and [[biopiracy]] in the pharmaceutical industry; the [[fair trade]] movement; [[transfer pricing]].
*Issues such as [[globalization]] and [[cultural imperialism]].
*Varying global standards&amp;mdash;e.g., the use of [[child labor]].
*The way in which multinationals take advantage of international differences, such as outsourcing production (e.g. clothes) and services (e.g. call centres) to low-wage countries.
*The permissibility of international commerce with pariah states.

The success of any business depends on its financial performance. Financial accounting helps the management to report and also control the business performance.

The information regarding the financial performance of the company plays an important role in enabling people to take right decision about the company. Therefore, it becomes necessary to understand how to record based on accounting conventions and concepts ensure unambling and accurate records.

Foreign countries often use dumping as a competitive threat, selling products at prices lower than their normal value. This can lead to problems in domestic markets. It becomes difficult for these markets to compete with the pricing set by foreign markets. In 2009, the International Trade Commission has been researching anti-dumping laws. Dumping is often seen as an ethical issue, as larger companies are taking advantage of other less economically advanced companies.

==Economic systems==
[[Political economy]] and [[political philosophy]] have ethical implications, particularly regarding the distribution of economic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Richard de|last=George|year=1999|title=Business Ethics|isbn=0412460807 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rawls]] and [[Robert Nozick]] are both notable contributors.

==Law and regulation==
Very often it is held that business is not bound by any ethics other than abiding by the law. Milton Friedman is the pioneer of the view. He held that corporations have the obligation to make a profit within the framework of the legal system, nothing more.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Machan|2007}}.{{harvnb|Frederic|2002|pp=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman made it explicit that the duty of the business leaders is, &quot;to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society, both those embodied in the law and those embodied in ethical custom&quot;.&lt;ref name=f1970&gt;Friedman, M. (1970). [http://www.oppapers.com/essays/The-Social-Responsibility-Of-Business-Is/317417 &quot;The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase Profit&quot;], ''The New York Times Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics for Friedman is nothing more than abiding by 'customs' and 'laws'. The reduction of ethics to abidance to laws and customs however have drawn serious criticisms.

Counter to Friedman's logic it is observed that legal procedures are technocratic, bureaucratic, rigid and obligatory where as ethical act is conscientious, voluntary choice beyond normativity.&lt;ref name=ag43&gt;Agamben, G.

==Implementation==
===Corporate policies===
{{Ref improve section|date=March 2011}}
As part of more comprehensive [[compliance and ethics program]]s, many companies have formulated internal policies pertaining to the ethical conduct of employees. These policies can be simple exhortations in broad, highly generalized language (typically called a corporate ethics statement), or they can be more detailed policies, containing specific behavioural requirements (typically called corporate ethics codes). They are generally meant to identify the company's expectations of workers and to offer guidance on handling some of the more common ethical problems that might arise in the course of doing business. It is hoped that having such a policy will lead to greater ethical awareness, consistency in application, and the avoidance of ethical disasters.

An increasing number of companies also require employees to attend seminars regarding business conduct, which often include discussion of the company's policies, specific case studies, and legal requirements. Some companies even require their employees to sign agreements stating that they will abide by the company's rules of conduct.

Many companies are assessing the environmental factors that can lead employees to engage in unethical conduct. A competitive business environment may call for unethical behaviour. Lying has become expected in fields such as trading. An example of this are the issues surrounding the unethical actions of the Saloman Brothers.

Not everyone supports corporate policies that govern ethical conduct. Some claim that ethical problems are better dealt with by depending upon employees to use their own judgment.

Others believe that corporate ethics policies are primarily rooted in utilitarian concerns, and that they are mainly to limit the company's legal liability, or to curry public favour by giving the appearance of being a good corporate citizen. Ideally, the company will avoid a lawsuit because its employees will follow the rules. Should a lawsuit occur, the company can claim that the problem would not have arisen if the employee had only followed the code properly.

Sometimes there is disconnection between the company's code of ethics and the company's actual practices. Thus, whether or not such conduct is explicitly sanctioned by management, at worst, this makes the policy duplicitous, and, at best, it is merely a marketing tool.

Jones and Parker write, &quot;Most of what we read under the name business ethics is either sentimental common sense, or a set of excuses for being unpleasant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|Parker|et al.|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many manuals are procedural form filling exercises unconcerned about the real ethical dilemmas. For instance, US Department of Commerce ethics program treats business ethics as a set of instructions and procedures to be followed by 'ethics officers'.,&lt;ref name=program/&gt; some others claim being ethical is just for the sake of being ethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|Parker|et al.|2005|pp=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business ethicists may trivialize the subject, offering standard answers that do not reflect the situation's complexity.&lt;ref name=ag43/&gt;

===Ethics officers===
{{Ref improve section|date=March 2011}}
Ethics officers (sometimes called &quot;compliance&quot; or &quot;business conduct officers&quot;) have been appointed formally by organizations since the mid-1980s. One of the catalysts for the creation of this new role was a series of fraud, corruption, and abuse scandals that afflicted the U.S. defense industry at that time. This led to the creation of the Defense Industry Initiative (DII), a pan-industry initiative to promote and ensure ethical business practices. The DII set an early benchmark for ethics management in corporations. In 1991, the [http://www.theecoa.org Ethics &amp; Compliance Officer Association] (ECOA)&amp;mdash;originally the Ethics Officer Association (EOA)&amp;mdash;was founded at the [http://www.bentley.edu/cbe Center for Business Ethics] (at Bentley College, Waltham, MA) as a professional association for those responsible for managing organizations' efforts to achieve ethical best practices. The membership grew rapidly (the ECOA now has over 1,200 members) and was soon established as an independent organization.

Another critical factor in the decisions of companies to appoint ethics/compliance officers was the passing of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations in 1991, which set standards that organizations (large or small, commercial and non-commercial) had to follow to obtain a reduction in sentence if they should be convicted of a federal offense. Although intended to assist judges with sentencing, the influence in helping to establish best practices has been far-reaching.

In the wake of numerous corporate scandals between 2001–04 (affecting large corporations like [[Enron]], [[WorldCom]] and [[Tyco]]), even small and medium-sized companies have begun to appoint ethics officers. They often report to the Chief Executive Officer and are responsible for assessing the ethical implications of the company's activities, making recommendations regarding the company's ethical policies, and disseminating information to employees. They are particularly interested in uncovering or preventing unethical and illegal actions. This trend is partly due to the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] in the United States, which was enacted in reaction to the above scandals. A related trend is the introduction of risk assessment officers that monitor how shareholders' investments might be affected by the company's decisions.

The effectiveness of ethics officers is not clear. If the appointment is made primarily as a reaction to legislative requirements, one might expect little impact, at least over the short term. In part, this is because ethical business practices result from a corporate culture that consistently places value on ethical behaviour, a culture and climate that usually emanates from the top of the organization. The mere establishment of a position to oversee ethics will most likely be insufficient to inculcate ethical behaviour: a more systemic programme with consistent support from general management will be necessary.

The foundation for ethical behaviour goes well beyond corporate culture and the policies of any given company, for it also depends greatly upon an individual's early moral training, the other institutions that affect an individual, the competitive business environment the company is in and, indeed, society as a whole.

==Academic discipline==
As an academic discipline, business ethics emerged in the 1970s. Since no academic business ethics journals or conferences existed, researchers published in general management journals, and attended general conferences. Over time, specialized peer-reviewed journals appeared, and more researchers entered the field. Corporate scandals in the earlier 2000s increased the field's popularity. As of 2009, sixteen academic journals devoted to various business ethics issues existed, with [[Journal of Business Ethics]] and [[Business Ethics Quarterly]] considered the leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1504/IJBGE.2009.023790|accessdate=2009-10-21|url=http://foba.lakeheadu.ca/serenko/papers/IJBGE040405_PUBLISHED.pdf|author=Serenko, A. and Bontis, N. |year=2009|title=A citation-based ranking of the business ethics scholarly journals|journal= International Journal of Business Governance and Ethics |volume=4|issue=4|pages=390–399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The International Business Development Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdinstitute.org]&lt;/ref&gt; is a global non-profit organization that represents 217 nations and all 50 United States. It offers a Charter in Business Development (CBD) that focuses on ethical business practices and standards. The Charter is directed by [[Harvard]], [[MIT]], and [[Fulbright]] Scholars, and it includes graduate-level coursework in economics, politics, marketing, management, technology, and legal aspects of business development as it pertains to business ethics. IBDI also oversees the International Business Development Institute of Asia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdinstitute.asia]&lt;/ref&gt; which provides individuals living in 20 Asian nations the opportunity to earn the Charter.

==Religious views==
{{Main|Religious views on business ethics}}

The historical and global importance of religious views on business ethics is sometimes underestimated in standard introductions to business ethics according to [[Todd Albertson|Dr. Todd Albertson]] author of ''[[The Gods of Business]]''. Particularly in Asia and the Middle East, religious and cultural perspectives have a strong influence on the conduct of business and the creation of business values.

In [[Sharia]] law, followed by many [[Muslims]], [[Islamic banking|banking]] specifically prohibits charging interest on loans.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Traditional [[Confucian]] thought discourages profit-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Chan [http://web.archive.org/web/20060427023145/http://www.stthom.edu/academics/centers/cbes/jonachan.html Confucian Business Ethics and the Nature of Business Decisions]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]] offers the [[Golden Rule]] command, &quot;Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bible|Matthew 7: 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related disciplines==
[[Business]] ethics is part of the [[philosophy of business]], the branch of [[philosophy]] that deals with the philosophical, political, and [[ethics|ethical]] underpinnings of business and [[economics]]. Business ethics operates on the premise, for example, that the ethical operation of a private business is possible—those who dispute that premise, such as [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]], (who contend that &quot;business ethics&quot; is an [[oxymoron]]) do so by definition outside of the domain of business ethics proper.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The philosophy of business also deals with questions such as what, if any, are the [[social responsibility|social responsibilities]] of a business; [[business management]] [[theory]]; theories of [[individualism]] vs. [[collectivism]]; [[free will]] among participants in the [[marketplace]]; the role of [[selfishness|self interest]]; [[invisible hand]] theories; the requirements of [[social justice]]; and [[natural rights]], especially [[property rights]], in relation to the business enterprise.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Business ethics is also related to '''[[political economy]],''' which is [[economic analysis]] from political and [[economic history|historical]] perspectives. Political economy deals with the distributive consequences of economic actions. It asks who gains and who loses from [[economic activity]], and is the resultant [[distribution of wealth|distribution]] fair or just, which are central ethical issues.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

'''British Standards''' are the standards produced by '''[[BSI Group]]''' which is incorporated under a [[Royal Charter]] (and which is formally designated as the [[Standards organization#National standards bodies (NSBs)|National Standards Body]] (NSB) for the UK).&lt;ref name=GlassWeston1959 /&gt; The BSI Group produces British Standards under the authority of the Charter, which lays down as one of the BSI's objectives to:&lt;ref name=FallerGraham2003 /&gt;
{{Bquote|(2) Set up standards of quality for goods and services, and prepare and promote the general adoption of British Standards and schedules in connection therewith and from time to time to revise, alter and amend such standards and schedules as experience and circumstances require|||BSI Royal Charter|Faller and Graham&lt;ref name=FallerGraham2003 /&gt;}}

Formally, as per the 2002 Memorandum of Understanding between the BSI and the United Kingdom Government, British Standards are defined as:
{{Bquote|&quot;British Standards&quot; means formal consensus standards as set out in BS 0-1 paragraph 3.2 and based upon the principles of standardisation recognised ''inter alia'' in European standardisation policy.|||MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN THE UNITED KINGDOM GOVERNMENT AND THE BRITISH STANDARDS INSTITUTION IN RESPECT OF ITS ACTIVITIES AS
THE UNITED KINGDOM'S NATIONAL STANDARDS BODY|United Kingdom Department for Business, Innovation, and Skills&lt;ref name=BIS2002 /&gt;}}

Products and services which BSI certifies as having met the requirements of specific standards within designated schemes are awarded the [[Kitemark]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kitemark.com/about-kitemark/ Kitemark.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

British Standards are one of the formal exceptions made to the [[Restrictive Trade Practices Act]].  §18(5) of the Act specifies that agreements to comply with British Standards should be disregarded when deciding whether an agreement is a restriction upon trade.&lt;ref name=Korah1982 /&gt;

== How British Standards are made ==
The BSI Group as a whole does not produce British Standards, as standards work within the BSI is decentralized.  The governing Board of BSI establishes a Standards Board.  The Standards Board does little apart from setting up Sector Boards (a Sector in BSI parlance being a field of standardization such as ICT, Quality, Agriculture, Manufacturing, or Fire).  Each Sector Board in turn constitutes several Technical Committees.  It is the Technical Committees that, formally, approve a British Standard, which is then presented to the Secretary of the supervisory Sector Board for endorsement of the fact that the Technical Committee has indeed completed a task for which it was constituted.&lt;ref name=Schepel2005 /&gt;

== The standards ==
The standards produced are titled '''British Standard XXXX[-P]:YYYY''' where XXXX is the number of the standard, P is the number of the part of the standard (where the standard is split into multiple parts) and YYYY is the year in which the standard came into effect.  '''BSI Group''' currently has over 27,000 active standards. Products are commonly specified as meeting a particular British Standard, and in general this can be done without any certification or independent testing. The standard simply provides a shorthand way of claiming that certain specifications are met, while encouraging manufacturers to adhere to a common method for such a specification.

The [[Kitemark]] can be used to indicate certification by BSI, but only where a [[Kitemark]] scheme has been set up around a particular standard. It is mainly applicable to safety and quality management standards. There is a common misunderstanding that Kitemarks are necessary to prove compliance with any BS standard, but in general it is neither desirable nor possible that every standard be 'policed' in this way.

Following the move on [[harmonisation]] of the standard in Europe, some British Standards are gradually superseded or replaced by the relevant [[List of EN standards|European Standards]] (EN).

== History ==
BSI Group began in 1901 as the ''Engineering Standards Committee'', led by [[James Mansergh]], to standardise the number and type of [[steel]] sections, in order to make [[United Kingdom|British]] manufacturers more efficient and competitive.

Over time the standards developed to cover many aspects of tangible engineering, and then engineering methodologies including quality systems, safety and security.

==Publicly Available Specifications==
BSI also publishes a series of [[Publicly Available Specification|Publicly Available Specification (PAS)]] documents. 

Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) are a flexible and rapid standards development model that is open to all organizations. A PAS is a sponsored piece of work allowing organizations flexibility in the rapid creation of a standard while also allowing for a greater degree of control over the document's development. A typical development time frame for a PAS is around 6–9 months. Once published by BSI a PAS has all the functionality of a British Standard for the purposes of creating schemes such as management systems and product benchmarks as well as codes of practice. A PAS is a living document and after two years the document will be reviewed and a decision made with the client as to whether or not this should be taken forward to become a formal British standard.

A '''building society''' is a [[financial institution]], owned by its members as a [[mutual organization]]. Building societies offer [[Banking institution|banking]] and other [[financial services]], especially [[mortgage loan|mortgage lending]]. They are found in the [[United Kingdom]] and some other countries.

The term ''building society'' first arose in the 18th century, in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], from [[Cooperative banking|co-operative savings]] groups. In the UK today building societies actively compete with [[bank]]s for most personal banking services, especially mortgage lending and [[deposit account]]s. 

Every building society in the UK is a member of the [[Building Societies Association]]. At the start of 2008, there were 59 building societies in the UK, with total assets exceeding £360 billion.&lt;ref name=multiple&gt;[http://www.bsa.org.uk  Building Societies Association]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of societies in the UK fell by four during 2008 due to a series of mergers brought about, to a large extent, by the consequences of the [[financial crisis of 2007-2010]], three further mergers took place in each of 2009 and 2010, and a demutualisation in 2011 leaving the current number of societies at 48.

==History==
The origins of the building society as an institution lie in late-18th century [[Birmingham]] – a town which was undergoing rapid economic and physical expansion driven by a multiplicity of small metalworking firms, whose many highly skilled and prosperous owners readily invested in property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ashworth|first=Herbert|title=The Building Society Story|year=1980|publisher=Franey &amp; Co.|location=London|isbn=0900382384|page=4}}; {{Cite book|last=Berg|first=Maxine|editor=Berg, Maxine|title=Markets and Manufacture in Early Industrial Europe|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NfkNAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=2010-09-07|year=1991|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415037204|page=194|chapter=Commerce and Creativity in Eighteenth-Century Birmingham|chapterurl=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NfkNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the early building societies were based in [[tavern]]s or [[coffeehouse]]s, which had become the focus for a network of clubs and societies for co-operation and the exchange of ideas among Birmingham's highly active citizenry as part of the movement known as the [[Midlands Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=Peter M.|title=Industrial Enlightenment: Science, technology and culture in Birmingham and the West Midlands, 1760-1820|year=2009|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0719077702|page=65}}; {{Cite news|first=Carl|last=Chinn|title=Brum's building society origins|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Brum's+building+society+origins-a0188990857|work=Birmingham Mail|publisher=Birmingham Post and Mail Ltd.|date=2008-11-15|accessdate=2010-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first building society to be established was [[Ketley's Building Society]], founded by Richard Ketley, the landlord of the ''Golden Cross'' inn, in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsa.org.uk/consumer/factsheets/100009.htm|title=The History of Building Societies|accessdate=2010-09-06|last=Rex|first=Simon|date=2010-04-20|publisher=Building Societies Association}}; {{Cite book|last=Ashworth|first=Herbert|title=The Building Society Story|year=1980|publisher=Franey &amp; Co.|location=London|isbn=0900382384|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of Ketley's society paid a monthly subscription to a central pool of funds which was used to finance the building of houses for members, which in turn acted as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] to attract further funding to the society, enabling further construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Christopher L.|year=2003|publisher=|month=July|title=Truth, Understanding, and High-Cost Consumer Credit: The Historical Context of the Truth in Lending Act|journal=Florida Law Review|issue=55|pages=839–840|url=http://www.relieffrompaydayloans.com/learn_more/from_law_review/truth_understanding.php|accessdate=2010-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1781 three more societies had been established in Birmingham, with a fourth in the nearby town of [[Dudley]]; and 19 more formed in Birmingham between 1782 and 1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Clark|first=Peter|year=2002|title=British Clubs and Societies 1580-1800: The Origins of an Associational World|publication-place=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=129|isbn=0199248435|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h18rP1hrNLQC&amp;pg=PA129|accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first outside the [[English Midlands]] was established in [[Leeds]] in 1785.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cleary|first=E.

Most of the original societies were fully ''[[Terminating deposit|terminating]]'', where they would be dissolved when all members had a house: the last of them, First Salisbury, was wound up in March 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Rex|first=Simon|title=The History of Building Societies|url=http://www.bsa.org.uk/consumer/factsheets/100009.htm|publisher=[[Building Societies Association]]|accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1830s and 1840s a new development took place with the ''Permanent Building Society'', where the society continued on a rolling basis, continually taking in new members as earlier ones completed purchases, such as [[Leek United Building Society]]. The main legislative framework for the Building Society was the ''Building Society Act'' of 1874, with subsequent amending legislation in 1894, 1939 (see [[Coney Hall]]), and 1960.

In their heyday, there were hundreds of building societies: just about every town in the country had a building society named after that town. Over succeeding decades the number of societies has decreased, as various societies merged to form larger ones, often renaming in the process, and other societies opted for [[demutualisation]] followed by - in the great majority of cases - eventual takeover by a listed bank. Most of the existing larger building societies are the end result of the mergers of many smaller societies.

===1980s and 1990s===
In the 1980s, British banking laws were changed to allow building societies to offer banking services equivalent to normal [[bank]]s. The management of a number of societies still felt that they were unable to compete with the banks, and a new [[Building Societies Act 1986|Building Societies Act]] was passed in 1986 in response to their concerns. This permitted societies to '[[demutualise]]'. If more than 75% of members voted in favour, the building society would then become a [[limited company]] like any other. Members' mutual rights were exchanged for shares in this new company. A number of the larger societies made such proposals to their members and all were accepted. Some became independent companies quoted on the [[London Stock Exchange]], others were acquired by larger financial groups.

The process began with the demutualisation of the Abbey National building society in 1989. Then, from 1995 to late-1999, eight societies demutualised accounting for two thirds of building societies assets as at 1994. Five of these societies became joint stock banks (Plc), one merged with another and the other four were taken over by Plc’s (in two cases after the mutual had previously converted to a Plc).

Demutualisation moves succeeded immediately because neither Conservative nor Labour party UK Governments created a framework which put obstacles in the way of demutualisation. Political acquiescence in demutualisation was clearest in the case of the position on 'carpet baggers', that is those who joined societies by lodging minimum amounts of £100 or so in the hope of profiting from a distribution of surplus after demutualisation. The deregulating 1986 Building Societies Act contained an anti-carpet bagger provision in the form of a two year rule. This prescribed a qualifying period of two years before savers could participate in a residual claim. But, before the 1989 Abbey National Building Society demutualisation, the Courts found against the two year rule after legal action brought by Abbey National itself in order to circumvent the intent of the legislators. After this the legislation did prevent a cash distribution to members of less than two years standing, but the same result was obtained by permitting the issue of 'free' shares in the acquiring Plc, saleable for cash. The Thatcher Conservative government declined to introduce amending legislation to make good the defect in the 'two year rule'.

Building societies, like mutual life insurers, arose as people clubbed together to address a common need interest; in the case of the building societies, this was housing and members were originally both savers and borrowers. But it very quickly became clear that 'outsider' savers were needed whose motive was profit through interest on deposits. Thus permanent building societies quickly became mortgage banks and in such institutions there always existed a conflict of interest between borrowers and savers. It was the task of the movement to reconcile that conflict of interest so as to enable savers to conclude that their interests and those of borrowers were to some extent complementary rather than conflictive. Conflict of interest between savers and borrowers was never fully reconciled in the building societies but upon deregulation that reconciliation became something of a lost cause.

Once the opportunity to claim was presented by management the savers in particular could be relied upon to seize it. There were sufficient hard up borrowers to take the inducement offered them by management (in spite of few simple sums sufficing to demonstrate that they were probably going to end up effectively paying back the inducement).

Managements promoting demutualization also thereby met managerial objectives because the end of mutuality brought joint stock company (Plc) style remuneration committee pay standards and share options. Share options for management of converting societies appear to be a powerful factor in management calculation. Rasmusen (1988) refers to this in the following terms:
&quot; ... perks do not rise in proportion to [mutual] bank size. If a mutual is large, or is expected to grow if it can raise capital by a conversion, its managers derive more value from a conversion but do not suffer much loss of perks than if the bank were small. Their benefit is in the right to purchase the new stock, which are valuable because the new issues are consistently underpriced [referring to USA mutual bank conversions]. Moreover, by no means are all mutual managers incompetent, and conversions allows the bank to expand more easily and to grant executive stock options that are valuable to skilled managers&quot;.

The management of building societies apparently could expend considerable of what is actually the organization's time and resources planning their effective capture of as much of the assets as they could. If so, this is arguably insider dealing on a grand scale with the benefit of inside specialist knowledge of the business and resources of the firm not shared with outsiders like politicians and members (and, perhaps, regulators).

Instead of deploying their margin advantage as a defence of mutuality, from 1980 building societies, in behaving like profit maximising banks, set mortgage rates with reference to market clearing levels. Thus, according to the Bank of England's Boxall and Gallagher (1997), &quot;... there was virtually no difference between banks and building society 'listed' interest rates for home finance mortgage lending between 1984 and 1997. This behaviour resulted in a return on assets for building societies which was at least as high as Plc banks and, in the absence of distribution, led to rapid accumulation of reserves&quot;. As Boxall and Gallagher (1997) also observe; &quot;... accumulation of reserves in the early-1990's, beyond regulatory and future growth requirements, is difficult to reconcile with conventional theories of mutual behaviour&quot;.

Llewellyn (1996) draws a rather more direct and cynical conclusion;
&quot;By adopting a policy of building up reserves by maintaining an excess margin, building societies simultaneously allowed banks to compete and may have undermined the long run viability of mutuality. A more cynical approach is that some societies may have adopted an excess-margin strategy simply to enhance their value for conversion&quot;.

Some of these managements ended up in dispute with their own members. Of the first major conversion of the Abbey in 1989, Kay (1991) observed;
&quot; ... the paradox of the Abbey members who campaigned against flotation [conversion to a Plc bank] of their building society. They were fighting to preserve a degree of accountability to the membership which the management of the Society patently did not feel. For incumbent management, the contrary views of some of their members were not matters to be weighed in the balance and taken account of in formulation of policy. They were a nuisance to be dealt with by the costly use of public relations advisers and legal processes&quot;.

In the end, after a number of large demutualisations, and pressure from carpetbaggers moving from one building society to another to cream off the windfalls, most of the remaining societies modified their rules of membership in the late 1990s. The method usually adopted were membership rules to ensure that anyone newly joining a society would, for the first few years, be unable to get any profit out of a demutualisation. With the chance of a quick profit removed, the wave of demutualisations came to an end in 2000.

One academic study (Heffernan, 2003) found that demutualised societies' pricing behaviour on deposits and mortgages was more favourable to shareholders than to customers, with the remaining mutual building societies offering consistently better rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = The Effect of UK Building Society Conversion on Pricing Behaviour (March 2003) | author = Shelagh Heffernan | publisher = Faculty of Finance, CASS Business School, City of London | url = http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/facfin/papers/WP2003/Mutuals-WP.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 2007-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 31 December 2010, deposits with building societies of up to £50,000 per individual, per institution, were normally protected by the [[Financial Services Compensation Scheme]] (FSCS), but Nationwide and Yorkshire Building Societies negotiated a temporary change to the terms of the FSCS to protect members of the societies they acquired in late 2008/early 2009. The amended terms allowed former members of multiple societies which merge into one to maintain multiple entitlements to FSCS protection until 30 September 2009 (later extended to 30 December 2010), so (for example) a member with £50,000 in each of Nationwide, Cheshire and Derbyshire at the time of the respective mergers would retain £150,000 of FSCS protection for their funds in the merged Nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk/news/product/bs_merger_compensation.html&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 2010 the general FSCS limit for retail deposits was increased to £85,000 for banks and building societies and the transitional arrangements in respect of building society mergers came to an end.
