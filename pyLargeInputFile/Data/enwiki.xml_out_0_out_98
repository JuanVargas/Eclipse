In [[golf]], a '''caddy''' (or '''caddie''') is the person who carries a player's bag and clubs, and gives insightful advice and moral support. A good caddy is aware of the challenges and obstacles of the golf course being played, along with the best strategy in playing it. This includes knowing overall yardage, pin placements and club selection. A caddy is not usually an employee of a private club or resort. He is classified as an &quot;independent contractor,&quot; meaning that he is basically self employed and does not receive any benefits from his association with the club. Some clubs and resorts do have caddy programs, although benefits are rarely offered.

== Etymology ==
The word caddie comes from the [[gascon language|gascon]] [[Occitan]] ''capdèth'' or ''capdet'', meaning ''chief'' then ''younger boy'' (become ''[[cadet]]'' in French and refers to the [[Cadets de Gascogne]], the captains serving in the French army in the 15th century were the youngest sons of the aristocratic families of [[Gascony]]). The term ''caddie'' or ''cadie'' first appeared in the English language in the year 1634.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottishgolfhistory.net/fore_caddy_derivation.htm&quot;Derivation of Golf Words Fore and Caddie or Caddy&quot;]. Retrieved on 2008-12-19&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of caddying ==
'''Traditional caddying''' involves both the ''golfer'' and the ''caddie'' walking the course.  The caddy is in charge of carrying the player’s bag, with the caddie out in front of the player.  This is the most common method used in golf clubs and is the only method allowed in the [[Professional Golfers' Association|PGA (Professional Golf Association)]] and [[LPGA|LPGA (Ladies Professional Golf Association)]].

&quot;Fore-Caddying&quot; entails the caddie walking while the players ride in carts. The fore-caddy will give a hole description and then walk ahead to spot the players tee shots. The caddie then gets the players yardage (either with a laser, course knowledge, or sprinkler heads) while the players drive their carts from the tee to their shots. The caddy walks ahead again to spot the golfers next shots. This process is continued until the players reach the green. Once on the green the caddie will read greens (if asked per proper [[golf etiquette]]), clean golf balls (if asked), fix ball marks, and attend the flag if asked. The caddie is also responsible for raking traps on the course. Caddies will help with club selection, reading greens, weather variables, and marking balls on the green but should only do so if asked to by the player. More than anything else, the caddy is there to make the player's round enjoyable by taking care of menial tasks, speeding up play, and providing mental support if asked.

==Caddy Ranks==
[[Image:the caddy 233.jpg|300px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;A caddy plies his trade&lt;/center&gt;]]
Most clubs use a ranking system. Caddies will start as a trainee, and be promoted through the ranks of Intermediate, Captain, Honor, and finally Championship. Championship is reserved for only the best caddies. Many courses start their caddies off at the B level, and after a year move them to A, and on their fourth year (if they have earned it), they will receive the title of Honor caddy. The intermediate and captain ranks can usually be obtained within the first year of caddying, and the honor rank is usually obtained in the second or third year of caddying. Championship takes at least 6 years and often as many as 10 years to obtain. An alternative ranking system often used in the American Mid-West proceeds as B level, A level, AA level, Honor level, and Evans Scholar. Caddies often obtain a promotion in rank once a year, while often Honor takes two years to achieve and Evans Scholars are only produced by winning the venerable Evans Scholarship for university.

== Employment ==
Many professionals working in the golf industry started as a caddy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Weekly schedule ==
Caddies are most frequently employed at clubs on weekends, when the majority of country club golf takes place.  Some (but usually not as many) opportunities to caddy exist during the week, as well.  Additionally, caddies are often allowed to play the course at which they caddy for free, usually on a Monday (the day that most private clubs choose to close their course for maintenance).  On pro golf tours, professional caddies accompany their player to all events, which usually take place from Thursday through Sunday.  Additionally, the player may hire their caddy to carry their bag for them during training sessions and practice rounds.

== Pay scale ==
At most clubs, caddies are paid at the end of the round by cash, or receive a payment ticket for which they can redeem their wages in the clubhouse.  Generally, the player will tip the caddy based on their performance during the round, with extra money given for exemplary work.  Most American club caddies earn between $35 and $100 per bag, though newer caddies will often earn less and more experienced caddies or caddies working during a tournament, high-stakes match, or 4-Day member-guest will often earn significantly more, upwards of $100 per round, per bag, at times. It is considered acceptable to ask a professional at the course what the average pay for a caddie is, as courses differ. 

In a [[professional golf tour]] setting, a player often pays their caddy a percentage of their winnings, which can be as high as 10%.  A common pay scale is 5% for making the cut, 7% for a top 10, and 10% for a win. The caddy also usually receives a salary, as the player is not guaranteed to win money at every tournament.

== Typical attire and equipment ==
*Collared shirt
*Khaki shorts or pants
*Gym shoes or golf shoes (lots of walking and standing)
*[[Smock-frock|Smock]]
*Towel
*Hat
*Ballmark repair tool
*pencil, scorecard, and pin sheet

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''compound turbine''' is a [[steam turbine]] in which there are two casings, a high-[[pressure]] casing and a low-pressure casing, operating in concert to extract work from a single source of steam. The steam is partially expanded in the high-pressure casing, then exhausted to the low-pressure casing. The rotor arrangement can be either tandem-compound in which the two [[axle]]s are joined end to end, or cross-compound in which the two turbines have separate axles. In the cross-compound case two separate [[generator (device)|generators]] are usually supplied, although a gearbox can reduce this to one.

The principal advantages of compound turbines are the reduction in size of any one casing, the confinement of the highest pressure to the smaller casing (which may be made of stronger and more expensive materials) and the possibility of divided flow in the low-pressure casing for the purpose of equalizing end thrusts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|the astronomical term|other uses|Corona (disambiguation)}}

A '''corona''' is a type of  [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] &quot;[[celestial body's atmosphere|atmosphere]]&quot; of the [[Sun]] or other celestial body, extending millions of kilometers into space, most easily seen during a total [[solar eclipse]], but also observable in a [[coronagraph]]. The [[Greek language|Greek]] root of the word corona means '''crown'''. 

[[File:Solar eclips 1999 4 NR.jpg|thumb|right|During a total [[solar eclipse]], the solar corona can be seen with the naked eye.]]

The high temperature of the corona gives it unusual [[spectroscopy|spectral]] features, which led some to suggest, in the 19th century, that it contained a previously unknown element, &quot;[[coronium]]&quot;. These spectral features have since been traced to highly ionized Iron ('''Fe-XIV''') which indicates a plasma temperature in excess of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; [[kelvin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Aschwanden&quot;&gt;{{cite book
|last=Aschwanden
|first=M. J.
|year=2004
|title=Physics of the Solar Corona. An Introduction
|publisher=Praxis Publishing Ltd.
|isbn=3-540-22321-5}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Actually, the fact that the Sun has a million degree corona was first discovered by Gotrian in 1939 and [[Bengt Edlén]] in 1941 by identifying the coronal lines (observed since 1869) as transitions from low lying metastable levels of the ground configuration of highly ionized metals (the green FeXIV line at 5303 Å, but also the red line FeX at 6374 Å). 

Light from the corona comes from three primary sources, which are called by different names although all of them share the same volume of space. The K-corona (K for ''kontinuierlich'', &quot;continuous&quot; in German) is created by sunlight scattering off free [[electron]]s; [[Doppler broadening]] of the reflected photospheric absorption lines completely obscures them, giving the spectral appearance of a continuum with no absorption lines.  The F-corona (F for [[Fraunhofer]]) is created by sunlight bouncing off dust particles, and is observable because its light contains the Fraunhofer absorption lines that are seen in raw sunlight; the F-corona extends to very high [[elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] angles from the Sun, where it is called the [[Zodiacal light]].  The E-corona (E for emission) is due to spectral emission lines produced by ions that are present in the coronal plasma; it may be observed in broad or [[forbidden line|forbidden]] or hot [[spectral line|spectral emission lines]] and is the main source of information about the corona's composition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corfield&quot;&gt;{{cite book
|last=Corfield

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical features==

The sun's corona is much hotter (by a factor of nearly 200) than the visible surface of the Sun: the [[photosphere]]'s average [[temperature]] is 5800 [[kelvin]] compared to the corona's one to three million kelvin. The corona is 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;12&lt;/sup&gt; times as dense as the photosphere, and so produces about one-millionth as much visible light. The corona is separated from the photosphere by the relatively shallow [[chromosphere]]. The exact mechanism by which the corona is heated is still the subject of some debate, but likely possibilities include induction by the Sun's [[magnetic field]] and [[sound|sonic]] pressure waves from below (the latter being less probable now that coronae are known to be present in early-type, highly magnetic [[star]]s). The outer edges of the Sun's corona are constantly being transported away due to open magnetic flux generating the [[solar wind]]. 

[[File:Twistedflux.png|right|thumb|300px|A drawing demonstrating the configuration of solar magnetic flux during the solar cycle.]]The corona is not always evenly distributed across the surface of the sun. During periods of quiet, the corona is more or less confined to the [[equator]]ial regions, with [[coronal hole]]s covering the [[Geographical pole|polar]] regions. However during the Sun's active periods, the corona is evenly distributed over the equatorial and polar regions, though it is most prominent in areas with [[sunspot]] activity. The [[solar cycle]] spans approximately 11 years, from [[solar minimum]] to [[solar maximum]], where the solar magnetic field is continually wound up (due to a [[differential rotation]] at the solar [[equator]]; the equator rotates quicker than the poles). Sunspot activity will be more pronounced at solar maximum where the [[magnetic field]] is twisted to a maximum. Associated with sunspots are [[coronal loop]]s, loops of [[magnetic flux]], upwelling from the solar interior. The magnetic flux pushes the hotter [[photosphere]] aside, exposing the cooler plasma below, thus creating the dark (when compared to the solar disk) spots.

Since the corona has been photographated at high resolution in the X-rays by the satellite [[Skylab]] in 1973, and then later by [[Yohkoh]] and the other following space instruments, it has been seen that the structure of the corona is very various and complex: different zones have been immediately classified on the coronal disc

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as described below.

===Active regions===
{{main|Stellar active region}}

The '''active regions''' are ensembles of loop structures connecting points of opposite magnetic polarity in the photosphere, the so called [[coronal loops]]. 
They generally distribute in two zones of activity, which are parallel to the solar equator. 
The average temperature is between two and four million of Kelvins,
while the density goes from 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; particle per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[File:Prominence (PSF).png|thumb||right|180px|[[Solar Prominence solare|Prominence]] (PSF)]]
The active regions involve all the phenomena directly linked to the magnetic field, 
which occur at different heights on the Sun's surface&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;/&gt;: [[sunspots]] and [[facula]]e, happening in the photosphere, [[spicule (solar physics)|spicules]], [[Hα]] [[filaments]] and [[plage (astronomy)|plages]] in the chromosphere, [[solar prominences|prominences]] in the chromosphere and transition region, and [[Solar flare|flares]] and [[coronal mass ejection]]s happening in the corona and chromosphere, but if flares are very violent can perturb also the photosphere and generate a [[Moreton wave]], as described by Uchida.
On the contrary, quiescent prominences are large, cool dense structures which are observed as dark, &quot;snake-like&quot; Hα ribbons (filaments) on the solar disc. Their temperature is about 5000-8000 K, and so they are usually considerated as chromospheric features.

====Coronal loops====
{{main|Coronal loop}}
[[File:Traceimage.jpg|left|thumb|300px|TRACE 171Å coronal loops]]
[[Coronal loop]]s are the basic structures of the magnetic solar corona. These loops are the closed-magnetic flux cousins of the open-magnetic flux that can be found in [[coronal hole]] (polar) regions and the [[solar wind]]. Loops of magnetic flux well up from the solar body and fill with hot solar plasma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1086/427488|last1 = Katsukawa|first1 = Yukio|last2 = Tsuneta|first2 = Saku | title = Magnetic Properties at Footpoints of Hot and Cool Loops | journal = The Astrophycal Journal | volume = 621 | pages = 498–511 | year = 2005 | bibcode=2005ApJ...621..498K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the heightened magnetic activity in these coronal loop regions, coronal loops can often be the precursor to [[solar flares]] and [[coronal mass ejection]]s (CMEs). 

Solar plasma feeding these structures is heated from under 6000 K to well over 1×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; K from the photosphere, through the transition region, and into the corona. Often, the solar plasma will fill these loops from one foot point and drain from the other ([[siphon]] flow due to a pressure difference
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1023/A:1005182503751|last1 = Betta |first1 = Rita|last2 = Orlando|first2 = Salvatore|last3 = Peres|first3 = Giovanni|last4 = Serio|first4 = Salvatore | title = On the Stability of Siphon Flows in Coronal Loops 
  | journal = Space Science Reviews | volume = 87 | pages = 133–136| year = 1999|bibcode = 1999SSRv...87..133B }}&lt;/ref&gt; or asymmetric flow due to some other driver). 

When the plasma goes upward from the footpoints towards the loop top, as it always occurs during the initial phase of a compact flare, we define it as chromospheric [[evaporation]]. When the plasma rapidly cools falling down towards the photosphere, we have the chromospheric [[condensation]]. There may also be [[symmetric]] flow from both loop foot points, causing a buildup of mass in the loop structure. The plasma may cool rapidly in this region (for a thermal instability), creating dark [[Solar prominence|filaments]] in the solar disk or [[solar prominence|prominences]] off the [[limb darkening|limb]]. 

Coronal loops may have lifetimes in the order of seconds (in the case of flare events), minutes, hours or days. Usually coronal loops lasting for long periods of time are known as ''[[steady state]]'' or ''[[quiescent]]'' coronal loops, where there is a balance in loop energy sources and sinks ([[:File:Energyfig.png|example]]). 

Coronal loops have become very important when trying to understand the current ''coronal heating problem''. Coronal loops are highly radiating sources of plasma and therefore easy to observe by instruments such as ''[[TRACE]]''; they are highly observable ''laboratories'' to study phenomena such as solar oscillations, wave activity and [[nanoflares]]. However, it remains difficult to find a solution to the coronal heating problem as these structures are being observed remotely, where many ambiguities are present (i.e. radiation contributions along the [[Line-of-sight propagation|LOS]]). ''[[In-situ]]'' measurements are required before a definitive answer can be arrived at, but due to the high plasma temperatures in the corona, ''in-situ'' measurements are impossible (at least for the time being).
The next mission of the Nasa [[Solar Probe Plus]] will approach the Sun very closely allowing more direct observations.

[[File:Coronal Hole Magnetic Field Lines.svg|thumb|right|180px|Coronal Arches connecting regions of opposite magnetic polarity (A) and the unipolar magnetic field in the coronal hole (B)]]

==== Large-scale structures ====
'''Large-scale structures''' are very long arcs which can cover over a quarter of the solar disk but contain plasma less dense than in the coronal loops of the active regions.

They were first detected in the June 8, 1968 flare observation during a rocket flight.&lt;ref name = Giacconi&gt;{{cite book |last = Giacconi| first = Riccardo| title = G.S. Vaiana memorial lecture in ''Proceedinds of Physics of Solar and Stellar Coronae: G.S. Vaiana Memorial Symposium'', ed. by J. F. Linsky and S.Serio| pages = 3–19 | year = 1992 | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers-Printed in the Netherlands | isbn = 0-7923-2346-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large-scale structure of the corona changes over the 11-year [[solar cycle]] and becomes particularly simple during the minimum period, when the magnetic field of the Sun is almost similar to a dipolar configuration (plus a quadrupolar component).

==== Interconnections of active regions ====
The '''interconnections of active regions''' are arcs connecting zones of opposite magnetic field, in different active regions. 
Significant variations of these structures are often seen after a flare.

Some other features of this kind are [[helmet streamer]]s—large cap-like coronal structures with long pointed peaks that usually overlie sunspots and active regions.
Coronal streamers are considered as sources of the slow [[solar wind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi= 10.1029/2000GL000097| last= Ofman | first= Leon | title= Source regions of the slow solar wind in coronal streamers | journal= Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 27 | issue= 18 | pages= 2885–2888 |year=2000 | bibcode=2000GeoRL..27.2885O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Filament cavities ====
'''Filament cavities''' are zones which look dark in the X-rays and are above the regions where [[Hα]] filaments are observed in the chromosphere.
They were first observed in the two 1970 rocket flights which also detected ''coronal holes''.&lt;ref name=Giacconi /&gt;

[[File:Crackling with Solar Flares.jpg|thumb|left|360px|Image taken by the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] on Oct 16 2010. A very long filament cavity is visible across the Sun's southern hemisphere.]]

Filament cavities are cooler clouds of gases suspended above the Sun's surface by magnetic forces.
The regions of intense magnetic field look dark in the images, because they are empty of hot plasma. In fact, the sum of the [[magnetic pressure]] and plasma pressure must be constant everywhere on the heliosphere in order to have an equilibrium configuration: where the magnetic field is higher, the plasma must be cooler or less dense. The plasma pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; can be calcutated by the [[state equation]] of a perfect gas &lt;math&gt; p = n K_B T&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[particle number density]], &lt;math&gt;K_B&lt;/math&gt; the [[Boltzman constant]] and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; the plasma temperature. It is evident from the equation that the plasma pressure lowers when the plasma temperature decreases respect to the surrounding regions or when the zone of intense magnetic field empties. The same physical effect makes [[sunspots]] dark in the [[photosphere]].

==== Bright points ====
'''Bright points''' are small active regions spread over the whole solar disk. 
X-ray bright points were first detected in April, 8 1969 during a rocket flight.&lt;ref name=Giacconi /&gt;

The fraction of the solar surface covered by bright points varies with the [[solar cycle]].
They are associated with small bipolar regions of the magnetic field.
Their average temperature ranges from 1.1 MK to 3.4 MK. The variations in temperature are often correlated with changes in the X-ray emission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kariyappa, R.; Deluca, E. E.; Saar, S. H.; Golub, L.; Damé, L.; Pevtsov, A. A.; Varghese, B. A. |title= Temperature variability in X-ray bright points observed with Hinode/XRT | journal= Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics| year= 2011 | volume= 526 | bibcode = 2011A&amp;A...526A..78K | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201014878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coronal holes ===
{{main|Coronal hole}}

'''[[Coronal hole]]s''' are the polar regions which look dark in the X-rays since they do not emit much radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/719/1/131|last1 = Ito |first1 = Hiroaki|last2 = Tsuneta|first2 = Saku|last3 = Shiota|first3 = Daikou|last4 = Tokumaru|first4 = Munetoshi|last5 = Fujiki|first5 = Ken'Ichi | title = Is the Polar Region Different from the Quiet Region of the Sun?| journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 719 | pages = 131–142| year = 2010 | bibcode=2010ApJ...719..131I}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are wide zones of the Sun where the magnetic field is unipolar and opens towards the interplanetary space. The high speed [[solar wind]] arises mainly from 
these regions. 

In the UV images of the coronal holes, some small structures, similar to elongated bubbles, are often seen as they were suspended in the solar wind. These are the coronal '''plumes'''. More exactly, they are long thin streamers that project outward from the Sun's north and south poles.

=== The Quiet Sun ===

The solar regions which are not part of active regions and coronal holes are commonly identified as the '''quiet Sun'''. 

The equatorial region has a faster velocity rotation than the polar zones. The result of the Sun's differential rotation is that the active regions always arise in two bands parallel to the equator and their extension increases during the periods of maximum of the [[solar cycle]], while they almost disappear during each minimum.
Therefore the quiet Sun always coincides with the equatorial zone and its surface is lower during the maximum of the solar cycle. Approaching the minimum of the solar cycle (also named butterfly cycle), the extension of the quiet Sun increases until it covers the whole disk surface excluding some bright points on the hemisphere and the poles, where there are the coronal holes.

== Variability of the corona ==

A portrait as diversified as the one already pointed out for the coronal features is emphasized by the analysis of the dynamics of the main structures of the corona,  which evolve in times very different among them.
Studying the coronal variability in its complexity is not easy because the times of evolution of the different structures can vary considerably: from seconds to several months. 
The typical sizes of the regions where coronal events take place vary in the same way, as it is shown in the following table.

=== Flares ===
{{main|Solar flares}}

Flares take place in active regions and provoke a sudden increase of the radiative flux emitted from small regions of the corona.
They are very complex phenomena, visible at different wavelengths; they interest several zones of the solar atmosphere and involve many physical effects, thermal and not thermal, and sometimes wide reconnections of the magnetic field lines with material expulsion.

Flares are impulsive phenomena, of average duration of 15 minutes, even if the most energetic events can last several hours. Flares involve a high and rapid increase of the density and temperature.

An emission in white light is only seldom observed: usually, flares are only seen at EUV wavelengths and in the X-rays, typical of the chromospheric and coronal emission. 

In the corona the morphology of flares, which can be grasped from the observations in the soft and hard X-rays, at the UV wavelengths and in [[Hα]], is very complex. However, two kinds of basic structures can be distinguished
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1086/155452|last1 = Pallavicini |first1 = R.|last2 = Serio|first2 = S.|last3 = Vaiana|first3 = G. S.|title = A survey of soft X-ray limb flare images - The relation between their structure in the corona and other physical parameters 
  | journal = The Astrophysical Journal  | volume = 216| pages = 108| year = 1977 | bibcode=1977ApJ...216..108P}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

*'''compact flares''', when each of the two arches where the event is happening maintains its morphology: only an increase of the emission is observed without significant structural variations. The emitted energy is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; J.
* '''flares of long duration''', associated to eruptions of [[prominence]]s, transients in white light and ''two-ribbon flares'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1038/344842a0|last1 = Golub |first1 = L.|last2 = Herant|first2 = M.|last3 = Kalata|first3 = K.|last4 = Lovas|first4 = I.|last5 = Nystrom|first5 = G.|last6 = Pardo|first6 = F.|last7 = Spiller|first7 = E.|last8 = Wilczynski|first8 = J. | title = Sub-arcsecond observations of the solar X-ray corona | journal = Nature | volume = 344 | pages = 842–844| year = 1990|bibcode = 1990Natur.344..842G }}&lt;/ref&gt;: in this case the magnetic loops change their configuration during the event. The energies emitted during these flares of such large proportions can reach 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; J.

[[File:Solar-filament.gif|300px|thumb|right| Filament erupting during a solar flare, seen at EUV wavelengths ([[TRACE]])]]

As for temporal dynamics, three different phases are generally distinguished, whose duration are not comparable. These times, moreover, can depend on the range of wavelengths used to observe the event even considerably:
*'''an initial impulsive phase''', whose duration is of the order of minutes. Strong emissions of energy are often observed even in the microwaves, at EUV wavelengths and in the hard X-rays.
*'''a maximum phase'''
*'''a decay phase''', which can last several hours.
Sometimes also a phase preceding the flare can be observed, usually called as &quot;pre-flare&quot; phase.

===Transients===
{{main|Coronal mass ejection}}

Accompanying [[solar flare]]s or large [[solar prominence]]s, '''&quot;coronal transients&quot;''' (also called [[coronal mass ejection]]s) are sometimes released. These are enormous loops of coronal material traveling outward from the Sun at over a million kilometers per hour, containing roughly 10 times the energy of the solar flare or prominence that accompanies them. Some larger ejections can propel hundreds of millions of tons of material in to [[space]] at roughly 1.5 million kilometers an hour.

=== A solar storm ===
These movies have been taken by the satellite [[SOHO]] during two weeks in October and November 2003. The images have been taken at the same time by the different instruments on board SOHO: 
the MDI, producing [[magnetogram]]s, the [[Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope]] (EIT), which photographs the corona in the ultraviolets, and the [[LASCO]], the coronograph. 

The first video at the top on the left (in grey) shows the magnetograms as they vary in time. At the top on the right (in yellow) the photosphere can be seen in white light as taken by the MDI.

Furthermore the EIT filmed the event in its four filters which are sensitive to different wavelengths, selecting plasma at different temperatures. The images in orange (on the left) refers to chromospheric plasma, while that one in green (on the right) to the corona.

In the last movie at the centre the Sun's images taken in the ultraviolet filter by the EIT have been combined with those taken by the coronograph LASCO blue and white in this movie. 
 
All the instruments registred the storm which is considered as one of the largest solar activity events observed by SOHO and maybe since the advent of space-based solar observations.
The storm involved all the plasma of the solar atmosphere from the chromosphere to the corona,
as can be seen from the movies, which are ordered from left to right, from top to bottom, 
in the outward direction of the increasing temperature on the Sun: photosphere (yellow), chromosphere-transition region (orange), low corona (green) and extended corona (blue).

The corona is visible to the SOHO/LASCO coronagraph instruments, which block the bright disk of the Sun so the significantly fainter corona can be seen. In this movie, the inner coronagraph (designated C2) is combined with the outer coronagraph (C3).  

As the movie plays, we can observe a number of features of the active Sun. Long streamers radiate outward from the Sun and wave gently due to their interaction with the solar wind. 
The bright white regions are visible due to their high density of free electrons which scatter the light from the photosphere towards the observer. 
Protons and other ionized atoms are there as well, but are not as visible since they do not interact with photons as strongly as electrons. 
Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are occasionally observed launching from the Sun. Some of these launch particle events can saturate the cameras with snow-like artifacts.

Also visible in the coronagraphs are stars and planets. Stars are seen to drift slowly to the right, carried by the relative motion of the Sun and the Earth. The planet Mercury is visible as the bright point moving left of the Sun. 

The horizontal &quot;extension&quot; in the image is called blooming and is due to a charge leakage along the readout wires in the CCD imager in the camera.

==Stellar coronae==
{{main|Coronal star}}
Coronal stars are ubiquitous among the [[star]]s in the cool half of the [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]].&lt;ref name=Gudel&gt;{{cite journal |author=Güdel M |title=X-ray astronomy of stellar coronae |journal=Astron Astrophys Rev|year=2004 |volume=12 |pages=71–237 |doi=10.1007/s00159-004-0023-2 |url=http://astronomy.sci.ege.edu.tr/~rpekunlu/GBDG/papers/XRayfromStellarCoronae.pdf|arxiv = astro-ph/0406661 |bibcode = 2004A&amp;ARv..12...71G }}&lt;/ref&gt; These coronae can be detected using [[X-ray telescope]]s. Some stellar coronae, particularly in young stars, are much more luminous than the Sun's. For example, [[FK Comae Berenices]] is the prototype for the [[Variable star|FK Com]] class of [[variable star]]. These are giants of spectral types G and K with an unusually rapid rotation and signs of extreme activity. Their X-ray coronae are among the most luminous (''L''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; erg·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;W) and the hottest known with dominant temperatures up to 40 MK.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

The astronomical observations planned with the [[Einstein Observatory]] by Giuseppe Vaiana and his group&lt;ref name=Vaianaetal81&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1086/158797 |author= Vaiana, G.S., et al. |title= Results from an extensive Einstein stellar survey |journal= The Astrophysical Journal|year=1981 |volume=245 |pages=163 |bibcode=1981ApJ...245..163V}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that F-, G-, K- and M-stars have chromospheres and often coronae much like our Sun.
The ''O-B stars'', which do not have surface convection zones, have a strong X-ray emission. However these stars do not have a corona, but the outer stellar envelopes emit this radiation during shocks due to thermal instabilities in rapidly moving gas blobs.
Also A-stars do not have convection zones but they do not emit at the UV and X-ray wavelengths. Thus they appear to have neither chromospheres nor coronae.

== Physics of the corona ==

[[File:171879main LimbFlareJan12 lg.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Taken by Hinode on Jan 12 2007 this image reveals the filamentary nature of the corona.]]

The matter in the external part of the solar atmosphere is in the state of [[plasma]], at very high temperature (a few million Kelvins) and at very low density (of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; particle/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).
According to the definition of plasma, it is a quasi-neutral ensemble of particles which exhibits a collective behaviour. 

The composition is the same as the one in the Sun's interior, mainly hydrogen, but completely ionized, thence protons and electrons, and a small fraction of the other atoms in the same percentages as they are present in the photosphere. 
Even heavier metals, as the iron, are partially ionized and have lost most of the external electrons. The ionization state of a chemical element depends strictly on the temperature and is regulated by the [[Saha equation]]. Historically, the presence of the spectral lines emitted from highly ionized states of the iron allowed to determine the high temperature of the coronal plasma, discovering that the corona is much hotter than the internal layers of the chromosphere.

The corona behaves like a gas which is very hot but very light at the same time: the pressure in the photosphere is usually only 0,1-0,6 Pa in active regions, while on the Earth the atmospheric pressure  is about 100kPa, approximatively a  million higher than on the solar surface.
However it is not properly a gas, because it is made of charged particles, basically protons and electrons, moving at different velocities. 
Supposing that they have the same kinetic energy on average   
(for the [[equipartition theorem]]), electrons have a mass roughly 1800 smaller than protons, therefore they acquire more velocity. Metal ions are always those slower. This fact has relevant physical consequences either on radiative processes (that are very different from the photospheric radiative processes), or on the thermal conduction.
Furthermore the presence of electric charges induces the generation of electric currents and high magnetic fields. 
Magnetohydrodynamic waves (MHD waves) can also propagate in this plasma

}}&lt;/ref&gt; even if it is not still clear how they can be transmitted or generated in the corona.

=== Radiation  ===
{{Main|Coronal radiative losses}}

The corona emits radiation mainly in the X-rays, observable only from the space. 

The plasma is trasparent to its own radiation and to the one coming from below, therefore we say that it is  '''optically-thin'''. The gas, in fact, is very rarefied and the mean free-path of photons overcomes by far all the other length-scales, including the typical sizes of the coronal features. 

Different processes of radiation take place in the emission, due mainly to processes of binary collisions between plasma particles, while the interactions with the photons coming from below are very rare.  
Since the emission is due to collisions between ions and electrons, the energy emitted from a unit volume in the time unit is proportional to the squared number of particles in a unit volume, or more exactly, to the product of the electron density and proton density

=== Thermal Conduction ===

[[File:STEREO-A first images.jpg|thumb|left|360px|A mosaic of the extreme ultraviolet images taken from [[STEREO]] on Dec 4 2006. These false color images show the Sun's atmospheres at a range of different temperatures. Clockwise from top left: 1 million degrees C (171 Å - blue), 1.5 million °C (195 Å - green), 60,000 - 80,000 °C (304 Å - red), and 2.5 million °C (286 Å - yellow).
]]

In the corona the [[thermal conduction]] occurs from the external hotter atmosphere towards the inner cooler layers. Responsible for the diffusion process of the heat are the electrons, which are much lower than ions and move faster, as explained above.
  
When there is a magnetic field the [[thermal conductivity]] of the plasma becomes higher in the direction which is  parallel to the field lines rather than in the perpendicular direction
.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzer&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A charged particle moving in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field line is subject to the [[Lorentz force]] which is normal to the plane individuated by the velocity and the  magnetic field. 
This force bend the path of the particle. In general, since particles have also     
a velocity component along the magnetic field line, 
the [[Lorentz force]] constrain them to bend and move along spirals around the field lines at the [[cyclotron]] frequency.

If the collisions between the particles are very frequent, they are scattered in every direction. This happens in the photosphere, where it is the plasma to carry the magnetic   field in its motion. In the corona, on the contrary, the mean free-path of the electrons is of the order of kilometres and even larger, and so each electron can do an helicoidal motion long before being scattered after a collision. 
Therefore the heat transfer is enhanced along the magnetic field lines and inhibited in the  perpendicular  direction.

In the direction longitudinal to the magnetic field, the [[thermal conductivity]] of  the corona  is 
&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzer&quot; /&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;
k = 20 \left(\frac{2}{\pi}\right)^{3/2}\frac{\left(k_B T \right)^{5/2}k_B}{m_e^{1/2} e^4 \ln \Lambda} \approx 1.8~10^{-10}~\frac{T^{5/2}}{\ln \Lambda}~ W m^{-1}K^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], 
&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature in Kelvin,
&lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; the electron mass, 
&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; the electric charge of the electron, 

&lt;math&gt; \ln \Lambda = \ln \left(12\pi n \lambda_D^3 \right) &lt;/math&gt; 

the Coulomb logarithm, and

&lt;math&gt;\lambda_D = \sqrt{\frac{k_B T }{4 \pi n e^2 }}&lt;/math&gt; 

the [[Debye length]] of the plasma with particle density &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; . 
The Coulomb logarithm &lt;math&gt; \ln \Lambda &lt;/math&gt; is roughly 20 in the corona,  with a  mean temperature of 1 MK and a density of 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; particles/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,  and about 10 in the chromosphere, where the temperature is approximatively 10kK  and the particle density is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; particles/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and   in practice it can be assumed constant.

Thence, if we indicate with &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; the heat for a volume unit, expressed in J m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, the Fourier equation of heat transfer, to be computed only along  the direction &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the field line, becomes

&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial q}{\partial t}= 0.9~10^{-11}~ \frac{\partial^2  T^{7/2}}{\partial x ^2 }&lt;/math&gt;.

Numerical calculations have shown that the thermal conductivity of the corona is comparable to that one of the copper.

===Coronal seismology===
{{main|Coronal seismology}}
'''Coronal seismology''' is a new way of studying the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of the solar corona with the use of [[magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic]] (MHD) waves. Magnetohydrodynamics studies the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of [[electrical conduction|electrically conducting]] [[fluid]]s—in this case the fluid is the coronal plasma. Philosophically, coronal seismology is similar to the Earth's [[seismology]], the Sun's [[helioseismology]], and MHD spectroscopy of laboratory plasma devices. In all these approaches, waves of various kind are used to probe a medium. The potential of coronal seismology in the estimation of the coronal magnetic field, density [[scale height]], [[fine structure]] and heating has been demonstrated by different research groups.

== Coronal heating problem ==
The ''coronal heating problem'' in [[solar physics]] relates to the question of why the temperature of the Sun's corona is millions of kelvin higher than that of the surface. The high temperatures require energy to be carried from the solar interior to the corona by non-thermal processes, because the [[second law of thermodynamics]] prevents heat from flowing directly from the solar photosphere, or surface, at about 5800 K, to the much hotter corona at about 1 to 3 [[SI prefix|MK]] (parts of the corona can even reach 10 MK). The amount of power required to heat the solar corona can easily be calculated, that one required to balance [[coronal radiative losses]] and the thermal conduction toward the [[chromosphere]] through the steep [[transition region]]. It is about 1 kilowatt for every square meter of surface area on the Sun, or 1/40000 of the amount of light energy that escapes the Sun. {{unsolved|physics|Why is the Sun's Corona so much hotter than the Sun's surface?}} 

This thin region of temperature increase from the chromosphere to the corona is known as the [[transition region]] and can range from tens to hundreds of kilometers thick. An analogy of this would be a light bulb heating the air surrounding it hotter than its glass surface. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] would be broken.

Many coronal heating theories have been proposed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Ulmshneider |first= Peter |title = Heating of Chromospheres and Coronae in ''Space Solar Physics'', Proceedings, Orsay, France, edited by J.C. Vial, K. Bocchialini and P. Boumier| publisher = Springer | pages = 77–106| year = 1997| isbn= 3-540-64307-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but two theories have remained as the ''most likely'' candidates, ''wave heating'' and ''[[magnetic reconnection]]'' (or ''[[nanoflares]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Malara, F., Velli, M. |title = Observations and Models of Coronal Heating in ''Recent Insights into the Physics of the Sun and Heliosphere: Highlights from SOHO and Other Space Missions'', Proceedings of IAU Symposium 203, edited by Pål Brekke, Bernhard Fleck, and Joseph B.

Most [[Solar physics|solar physicists]] now believe that some combination of the two theories can probably explain coronal heating, although the details are not yet complete.

The [[NASA]] mission [[NASA Solar probe|Solar Probe +]] is intended to approach the sun to a distance of approximately 9.5 solar radii in order to investigate coronal heating and the origin of the solar wind.

===Wave heating theory===
The ''wave heating'' theory, proposed in 1949 by [[Evry Schatzman]], proposes that waves carry energy from the solar interior to the solar chromosphere and corona. The Sun is made of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] rather than ordinary gas, so it supports several types of waves analogous to [[sound waves]] in air. The most important types of wave are [[magneto-acoustic wave]]s and [[Alfvén wave]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Alfvén
  | first = Hannes
  | title = Magneto hydrodynamic waves, and the heating of the solar corona
  | journal = MNRAS
  | volume = 107
  | pages = 211–219
  | year = 1947
  |bibcode = 1947MNRAS.107..211A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Magneto-acoustic waves are sound waves that have been modified by the presence of a magnetic field, and Alfvén waves are similar to [[ULF]] [[radio waves]] that have been modified by interaction with [[matter]] in the plasma. Both types of waves can be launched by the turbulence of [[Granule (solar physics)|granulation]] and [[super granulation]] at the solar photosphere, and both types of waves can carry energy for some distance through the solar atmosphere before turning into [[shock waves]] that dissipate their energy as heat.

One problem with wave heating is delivery of the heat to the appropriate place. Magneto-acoustic waves cannot carry sufficient energy upward through the chromosphere to the corona, both because of the low pressure present in the chromosphere and because they tend to be [[reflected]] back to the photosphere. Alfvén waves can carry enough energy, but do not dissipate that energy rapidly enough once they enter the corona. Waves in plasmas are notoriously difficult to understand and describe analytically, but computer simulations, carried out by Thomas Bogdan and colleagues in 2003, seem to show that Alfvén waves can transmute into other wave modes at the base of the corona, providing a pathway that can carry large amounts of energy from the photosphere into the corona and then dissipate it as heat.

Another problem with wave heating has been the complete absence, until the late 1990s, of any direct evidence of waves propagating through the solar corona. The first direct observation of waves propagating into and through the solar corona was made in 1997 with the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] space-borne solar observatory, the first platform capable of observing the Sun in the [[extreme ultraviolet]] (EUV) for long periods of time with stable [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. Those were magneto-acoustic waves with a frequency of about 1 [[hertz|millihertz]] (mHz, corresponding to a 1,000 second wave period), that carry only about 10% of the energy required to heat the corona. Many observations exist of localized wave phenomena, such as Alfvén waves launched by solar flares, but those events are transient and cannot explain the uniform coronal heat.

It is not yet known exactly how much wave energy is available to heat the corona. Results published in 2004 using data from the [[TRACE]] spacecraft seem to indicate that there are waves in the solar atmosphere at frequencies as high as 100 mHz (10 second period). Measurements of the temperature of different [[ions]] in the solar wind with the UVCS instrument aboard [[SOHO]] give strong indirect evidence that there are waves at frequencies as high as 200&amp;nbsp;Hz, well into the range of human hearing. These waves are very difficult to detect under normal circumstances, but evidence collected during solar eclipses by teams from [[Williams College]] suggest the presences of such waves in the 1&amp;ndash;10&amp;nbsp;Hz range.

Recently, Alfvénic motions have been found in the lower solar atmosphere &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science20.com/news_releases/alfven_waves_our_sun_doing_magnetic_twist |title = Alfven Waves - Our Sun Is Doing The Magnetic Twist|publisher=read on Jan 6 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rev. Lett.|year=2008|month=December|volume=101|pmid=19113766|issue=26|pages=261103|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.261103|bibcode=2008PhRvL.101z1103K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic reconnection theory===
{{main|magnetic reconnection}}

[[File:Arcing Active Region.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Arcing Active Region by [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]]]]
The [[magnetic reconnection]] theory relies on the solar magnetic field to induce electric currents in the solar corona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The currents then collapse suddenly, releasing energy as heat and wave energy in the corona. This process is called &quot;reconnection&quot; because of the peculiar way that magnetic fields behave in a plasma (or any electrically conductive fluid such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[seawater]]). In a plasma, [[Magnetic field#Magnetic_field_lines|magnetic field lines]] are normally tied to individual pieces of matter, so that the [[topology]] of the magnetic field remains the same: if a particular north and south [[magnetic pole]] are connected by a single field line, then even if the plasma is stirred or if the magnets are moved around, that field line will continue to connect those particular poles. The connection is maintained by electric currents that are induced in the plasma. Under certain conditions, the electric currents can collapse, allowing the magnetic field to &quot;reconnect&quot; to other magnetic poles and release heat and wave energy in the process.

[[Magnetic reconnection]] is hypothesized to be the mechanism behind solar flares, the largest explosions in our solar system. Furthermore, the surface of Sun is covered with millions of small magnetized regions 50&amp;ndash;1,000&amp;nbsp;km across. These small magnetic poles are buffeted and churned by the constant granulation. The magnetic field in the solar corona must undergo nearly constant reconnection to match the motion of this &quot;magnetic carpet&quot;, so the energy released by the reconnection is a natural candidate for the coronal heat, perhaps as a series of &quot;microflares&quot; that individually provide very little energy but together account for the required energy.

The idea that [[nanoflares]] might heat the corona was put forward by [[Eugene Parker]] in the 1980s but is still controversial. In particular, [[ultraviolet]] telescopes such as [[TRACE]] and [[SOHO]]/EIT can observe individual micro-flares as small brightenings in extreme ultraviolet light

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there seem to be too few of these small events to account for the energy released into the corona. The additional energy not accounted for could be made up by wave energy, or by gradual magnetic reconnection that releases energy more smoothly than micro-flares and therefore doesn't appear well in the [[TRACE]] data. Variations on the micro-flare hypothesis use other mechanisms to stress the magnetic field or to release the energy, and are a subject of active research in 2005.

===Spicules (type II)===
For decades, researchers believed [[spicule (solar physics)|spicules]] could send heat into the corona. However, following observational research in the 1980s, it was found that spicule plasma did not reach coronal temperatures, and so the theory was discounted.

As per studies performed in 2010 at the ''National Centre for Atmospheric Research'' in [[Colorado]], in collaboration with the ''Lockheed Martin's Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory'' (LMSAL) and the ''Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics'' of the [[University of Oslo]], a new class of spicules (TYPE II) discovered in 2007, which travel faster (up to 100&amp;nbsp;km/sec) and have shorter lifespans can account for the problem.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-mystery-of-suns-hot-outer-atmosphere-solved/20110107.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These jets insert heated plasma into the Sun's outer atmosphere.
Thus, a much greater understanding of the Corona and improvement in the knowledge of the Sun's subtle influence on the Earth's upper atmosphere can be expected henceforth. The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on NASA's recently launched Solar Dynamics Observatory and NASA's Focal Plane Package for the Solar Optical Telescope on the Japanese Hinode satellite which were used to test this hypothesis. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the newer instruments reveal this coronal mass supply.

These observations reveal a one-to-one connection between plasma that is heated to millions of degrees and the spicules that insert this plasma into the corona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1197738 | last1 = De Pontieu | first1 = B | last2 = McIntosh | first2 = SW | last3 = Carlsson | first3 = M | last4 = Hansteen | first4 = VH | last5 = Tarbell | first5 = TD | last6 = Boerner | first6 = P | last7 = Martinez-Sykora | first7 = J | last8 = Schrijver | first8 = CJ | last9 = Title | first9 = AM | title = The Origins of Hot Plasma in the Solar Corona | journal = Science | volume = 331| issue =  6013  | pages = 55–58| year = 2011 | pmid = 21212351|bibcode = 2011Sci...331...55D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Chrono Cross'''''|クロノ・クロス|Kurono Kurosu}} is a [[role-playing video game]] [[video game developer|developed]] and [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Square Co.|Square]] (now [[Square Enix]]) for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] [[video game console]]. It is the sequel to ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'', which was released in 1995 for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. ''Chrono Cross'' was developed primarily by scenarist and director [[Masato Kato]] and other designers from ''Chrono Trigger'', including art director [[Yasuyuki Honne]] and composer [[Yasunori Mitsuda]]. [[Nobuteru Yūki]] designed the characters of the game.

The story of ''Chrono Cross'' focuses on a teenage boy named [[Serge (Chrono Cross)|Serge]] and a theme of [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel worlds]]. Faced with an alternate reality in which he died as a child, Serge endeavors to discover the truth of the two worlds' divergence. The flashy thief [[Kid (Chrono Cross)|Kid]] and many other characters assist him in his travels around the tropical archipelago El Nido. Struggling to uncover his past and find the mysterious Frozen Flame, Serge is chiefly challenged by [[Lynx (Chrono Cross)|Lynx]], a shadowy antagonist working to apprehend him.

Upon its release in Japan in 1999 and in North America in 2000, ''Chrono Cross'' received high ratings and critical acclaim, earning a rare perfect 10.0 score from [[GameSpot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gamerankings&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Chrono Cross|url= http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages4/196917.asp|publisher=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;perfect-10&quot; /&gt; The game shipped {{Nowrap|1.5 million}} copies worldwide, leading to a Greatest Hits re-release and continued life in Japan as part of the [[Square Enix budget ranges#Ultimate Hits|Ultimate Hits]] series.&lt;ref name=&quot;square-sales&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=2003-08-04|title=Square Enix IR Roadshow Document|url= http://www.square-enix.com/jp/ir/e/explanatory/download/0404-200308040000-01.pdf|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|accessdate=2006-07-06| format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimatehits&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=2006-04-28|first=Chris|last=Winkler|title=Square Enix Adds 16 to Ultimate Hits Series | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/news/2006/1219.html|publisher=RPGFan|accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chrono Cross'' is planned for release on the Japanese [[PlayStation Network]].&lt;ref name=&quot;psnnetwork&quot; /&gt; Square also released a &quot;Millennium Edition&quot; featuring a calendar, clock, and music sampler disc.

==Gameplay==
''Chrono Cross'' features standard [[Console role-playing game|RPG]] gameplay with some differences. Players advance the game by controlling the protagonist Serge through the game's world, primarily by foot and boat. Navigation between areas is conducted via an [[overworld]] map, much like ''Chrono Trigger's'', depicting the landscape from a scaled down overhead view. Around the island world are villages, outdoor areas, and dungeons, through which the player moves in three dimensions. Locations such as cities and forests are represented by more realistically scaled field maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. Like ''Chrono Trigger'', the game features no [[random encounter]]s; enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfect-10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=2000-01-06| first=Andrew|last=Vestal|title=GameSpot: Chrono Cross Review|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/chronocross/review.html|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2006-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Touching the monster switches perspectives to a battle screen, in which players can physically attack, use &quot;Elements&quot;, defend, or run away from the enemy. Battles are turn-based, allowing the player infinite time to select an action from the available menu. For both the playable characters and the computer-controlled enemies, each attack reduces their number of [[hit point]]s (a numerically based [[life bar]]), which can be restored through some Elements. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints. If all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved chapter—except for specific storyline-related battles that allow the player to lose. ''Chrono Cross''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s developers aimed to break new ground in the genre, and the game features several innovations.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameprointerview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=2000-10-17|title=Interview with Chrono Cross Developers|url= http://gamepro.org/sony/psx/games/features/7033.shtml|work=Chrono Compendium|publisher=[[GamePro]]|accessdate=2006-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, players can run away from all conflicts, including [[boss (video games)|boss]] fights and the final battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfect-10&quot; /&gt;

===Battle and Elements===
[[File:Chronocrossbattlescreenshot.png|left|thumb|In battle, players can attack, use Elements, defend, or run away|alt=Two characters in foreground in battle poise, menu with &quot;Attack&quot;, &quot;Element&quot;, &quot;Defend&quot;, &quot;Run Away&quot;, boxes with health statistics for characters &quot;Serge&quot;, &quot;Kid&quot;, and &quot;Mel&quot;, stone floor, gold robotic enemy facing the characters]]
The Element system of ''Chrono Cross'' handles all magic, consumable items, and character-specific abilities. Elements unleash magic effects upon the enemy or party and must be equipped for use, much like the materia of 1997's ''[[Final Fantasy&amp;nbsp;VII]]''. Elements can be purchased from shops or found in treasure chests littered throughout areas. Once acquired, they are allocated to a grid whose size and shape are unique to each character. They are ranked according to eight tiers; certain high level Elements can only be assigned on equivalent tiers in a character's grid. As the game progresses, the grid expands, allowing more Elements to be equipped and higher tiers to be accessed. Elements are divided into six paired oppositional types, or &quot;colors,&quot; each with a natural effect. Red (fire/magma) opposes Blue (water/ice), Green (wind/flora) opposes Yellow (earth/lightning), and White (light/cosmos) opposes Black (darkness/gravity).&lt;ref name=&quot;perfect-10&quot; /&gt; Each character and enemy has an innate color, enhancing the power of using same-color Elements while also making them weak against elements of the opposite color. ''Chrono Cross'' also features a &quot;field effect&quot;, which keeps track of Element color used in the upper corner of the battle screen. If the field is purely one color, the power of Elements of that color will be enhanced, while Elements of the opposite color will be weakened. Characters also innately learn some special techniques (&quot;Techs&quot;) that are unique to each character but otherwise act like Elements. Like ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'', characters can combine certain Techs to make more powerful Double or Triple Techs.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfect-10&quot; /&gt; Consumable Elements may be used to restore [[hit point]]s or heal [[status ailment]]s after battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfect-10&quot; /&gt;

Another innovative aspect of ''Chrono Cross'' is its stamina bar.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfect-10&quot; /&gt; At the beginning of a battle, each character has seven points of stamina. When a character attacks or uses an Element, stamina is decreased proportionally to the potency of the attack. Stamina slowly recovers when the character defends or when other characters perform actions in battle. Characters with stamina below one point must wait to take action. Use of an Element reduces the user's stamina bar by seven stamina points; this often means that the user's stamina gauge falls into the negative and the character must wait longer than usual to recover. With each battle, players can enhance [[Attribute (role-playing games)|statistic]]s such as strength and defense. However, no system of [[experience point]]s exists; after four or five upgrades, statistics remain static until players defeat a [[boss (video game)|boss]]. This adds a star to a running count shown on the status screen, which allows for another few rounds of statistical increases.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfect-10&quot; /&gt; Players can equip characters with weapons, armor, helmets, and accessories for use in battle; for example, the &quot;Power Seal&quot; upgrades attack power. Items and equipment may be purchased or found on field maps, often in [[Power-up|treasure chests]]. Unlike Elements, weapons and armor cannot merely be purchased with money; instead, the player must obtain base materials—such as copper, bronze, or bone—for a blacksmith to forge for a fee. The items can later be disassembled into their original components at no cost.
[[File:Navigatingelnido.png|right|thumb|Players navigate the game's tropical setting by boat|alt=&quot;Home World&quot;, an archipelago featuring fishing settlements, a city, and a volcanic mountain range surrounding a stone fort]]

===Parallel dimensions===
The existence of two major [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel dimensions]], like time periods in ''Chrono Trigger'', plays a significant role in the game. Players must go back and forth between the worlds to recruit party members, obtain items, and advance the plot. Much of the population of either world have counterparts in the other; some party members can even visit their other versions. The player must often search for items or places found exclusively in one world. Events in one dimension sometimes have an impact in another—for instance, cooling scorched ground on an island in one world allows vegetation to grow in the other world. This system assists the presentation of certain themes, including the questioning of the importance of one's past decisions and humanity's role in destroying the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;ignreview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=2000-08-15|first=David|last=Zdyrko|title= Chrono Cross Review|url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/162/162503p1.html|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2006-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rounding out the notable facets of ''Chrono Cross''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s gameplay are the [[New Game Plus|New Game+]] option and multiple endings. As in ''Chrono Trigger'', players who have completed the game may choose to start the game over using data from the previous session. Character levels, learned techniques, equipment, and items gathered copy over, while acquired money and some story-related items are discarded. On a New Game+, players can access twelve endings.&lt;ref name=&quot;endingcount&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|title=Chrono Cross Endings|url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Endings_(Chrono_Cross).html|work=Chrono Compendium|accessdate=2006-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes viewed depend on players' progress in the game before the final battle, which can be fought at any time in a New Game+ file.

==Plot==
===Characters===
{{main|List of characters in Chrono Cross}}
''Chrono Cross'' features a diverse cast of 45 party members. Each character is outfitted with an innate Element affinity and three unique special abilities that are learned over time. If taken to the world opposite their own, characters react to their counterparts (if available). Many characters tie in to crucial plot events. Since it is impossible to obtain all 45 characters in one playthrough, players must replay the game to witness everything. Through use of the [[New Game Plus|New Game+]] feature, players can ultimately obtain all characters on one save file. Several characters speak with unique accents, including French and Australian English.

[[Serge (Chrono Cross)|Serge]], the game's protagonist, is a 17-year-old boy with blue hair who lives in the fishing village of Arni. One day, he slips into an alternate world in which he drowned ten years before. Determined to find the truth behind the incident, he follows a predestined course that leads him to save the world. He is assisted by [[Kid (Chrono Cross)|Kid]], a feisty, skilled thief who seeks the mythical Frozen Flame. Portrayed as willful and [[tomboy]]ish due to her rough, thieving past, she helps Serge sneak into Viper Manor. Kid was raised by [[Lucca (Chrono Trigger)|Lucca]] as a child, and vows to find and defeat [[Lynx (Chrono Cross)|Lynx]], an anthropomorphic panther who burned down Lucca's orphanage. A sadistic and cruel agent of the supercomputer FATE, Lynx is bent on finding Serge, with and succeeds in taking his body. He travels with [[Harle (Chrono Cross)|Harle]], a mysterious, playful girl dressed like a [[harlequin]]. Sent by the Dragon God to shadow Lynx and one day steal the Frozen Flame from Chronopolis, she painfully fulfills her duty though smitten with Serge. To this end, she helps Lynx manipulate the Acacia Dragoons, the powerful militia governing the islands of El Nido. As the Dragoons maintain order, they contend with Fargo, a former Dragoon turned pirate captain who holds a grudge against their leader, General Viper. Their home base, Viper Manor, is also infiltrated by Serge, Kid, and one of three characters—Nikki, a musician, Pierre, a hero-in-training, or Guile, a mysterious magician. Though tussling with Serge initially, the Acacia Dragoons—whose ranks include the fierce warriors Karsh, Zoah, Marcy, and Glenn—later assist him when the militaristic nation of Porre invades the archipelago. The invasion brings Norris and Grobyc to the islands, a heartful commander of an elite force and a prototype cyborg soldier, respectively. As they too seek the Frozen Flame, the plot unfolds amidst several other characters.

===Story===
''Chrono Cross'' begins with Serge located in El Nido, a tropical archipelago inhabited by ancient natives, mainland colonists, and beings called Demi-humans. Serge slips into an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]] in which he drowned on the beach ten years prior, and meets the thief, &quot;Kid&quot;. He learns while infiltrating Viper Manor that ten years before the present, the universe split into two dimensions—one in which Serge lived, and one in which he perished.&lt;ref name=&quot;split-dimensions&quot;&gt;{{cite video game|title=Chrono Cross|developer=Square|publisher=Square|date=2000-08-15|platform=PlayStation|level=Viper Manor|quote= '''Prophet''': In your home world, you survived to live a happy and prosperous life. That is how you made it to the present point in time. However, here in this '&quot;alternate&quot;' world, you are, in fact, very dead and buried. You died 10 years ago, but this world's time line has flowed on regardless.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Kid's Astral Amulet charm, Serge travels between the dimensions. At Fort Dragonia the use of a Dragonian artifact called the Dragon Tear, Lynx switches bodies with Serge. Unaware of the switch, Kid confides in Lynx, who stabs her as the real Serge helplessly watches. Lynx boasts of his victory and banishes Serge to a strange realm called the Temporal Vortex. He takes Kid under his wing, brainwashing her to believe the real Serge (in Lynx's body) is her enemy. Serge escapes with help from [[Characters of Chrono Cross#Harle|Harle]]. Discovering that his new body prevents him from traveling across the dimensions, he sets out to regain his former body and learn more of the universal split that occurred ten years earlier. He travels to a forbidden lagoon known as the Dead Sea—a wasteland frozen in time, dotted with futuristic ruins.&lt;ref name=&quot;dead-sea&quot;&gt;{{cite video game|title=Chrono Cross|developer=Square|publisher=Square|date=2000-08-15|platform= PlayStation|level=Dead Sea|quote='''Member''': The waves are at a standstill&amp;nbsp;... And&amp;nbsp;... What is that dark shadow in the distance&amp;nbsp;...?}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the center, he locates a man named Miguel and presumably ''Home'' world's Frozen Flame. Charged with guarding the Dead Sea by an entity named FATE, Miguel and three visions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca from ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' explain that Serge's existence dooms ''Home'' world's future to destruction. To prevent Serge from obtaining the Frozen Flame, FATE destroys the Dead Sea.

Able to return to ''Another'' world, Serge allies with the Acacia Dragoons against Porre and locates that dimension's Dragon Tear, allowing him to return to his human form. He then enters the Sea of Eden, ''Another'' world's physical equivalent of the Dead Sea, finding a temporal research facility called Chronopolis. Lynx and Kid are inside; Serge defeats Lynx and the supercomputer FATE, allowing the six Dragons of El Nido to steal the Frozen Flame and retire to Terra Tower, a massive structure raised from the sea floor. Kid falls into a coma, and Harle bids the party goodbye to fly with the Dragons. Serge regroups his party and tends to Kid, who remains comatose. Continuing his adventure, he obtains and cleanses the Masamune sword from ''Chrono Trigger''. He then uses the Dragon relics and shards of the Dragon Tears to create the mythic Element Chrono Cross. The spiritual power of the Masamune later allows him to lift Kid from her coma. At Terra Tower, the prophet of time, revealed to be Belthasar from ''Chrono Trigger'', visits him with visions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca. Serge learns that the time research facility Chronopolis created El Nido thousands of years ago after a catastrophic experimental failure drew it to the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;remodeling&quot;&gt;{{cite video game |title=Chrono Cross|developer=Square|publisher=Square|date=2000-08-15|platform=PlayStation|level=Chronopolis|quote='''Ghost''': Originally, El Nido was nothing but ocean.

The institutions warred and Chronopolis subjugated the Dragonians. Humans captured their chief creation—the Dragon God, an entity capable of controlling nature.

Chronopolis divided this entity into six pieces and created an Elements system.

His father took him to find assistance at Marbule, but Serge's boat blew off course due to a raging magnetic storm caused by [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Schala|Schala]]. Schala, the princess of the [[Kingdom of Zeal]], had long ago accidentally fallen to a place known as the Darkness Beyond Time and began merging with Lavos, the chief villain of ''Chrono Trigger''.&lt;ref name=&quot;schala-banishment&quot;&gt;{{cite video game|title=Chrono Cross|developer=Square|publisher= Square|date=2000-08-15|platform=PlayStation|level=Opassa Beach|quote='''Lucca''': Princess Schala was sucked into a dimensional vortex with the Lavos Mammon Machine.

After Serge returned home, FATE sent Lynx to kill Serge, hoping that it would release the Arbiter lock. Ten years after Serge drowned, the thief Kid—presumably on Belthasar's orders—went back in time to save Serge and split the dimensions.

Thankful, Schala muses on evolution and the struggle of life and returns Serge to his home, noting that he will forget the entire adventure. She then seemingly records the experience in her diary, noting she will always be searching for Serge in this life and beyond, set upon a desk on which a wedding photo of Kid appears - with the man's face not revealed before fading out. Scenes then depict a real-life Kid searching for someone in a modern city, intending to make players entreat the possibility that their own Kid is searching for them.

===Relation to ''Radical Dreamers''===
''Chrono Cross'' employs story arcs, characters, and themes from ''[[Radical Dreamers]]'', a [[Satellaview]] side story to ''Chrono Trigger'' released in Japan. An illustrated [[Interactive fiction|text adventure]], ''Radical Dreamers'' was created to wrap up an unresolved plot line of ''Chrono Trigger''.&lt;ref name=&quot;weeklyfamitsu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=1999|title=Weekly Famitsu: Interview with Chrono Cross Developers|url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Weekly_Famitsu.html|publisher=[[Enterbrain, Inc.]] and [[Tokuma Shoten]]|accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it borrows from ''Radical Dreamers'' in its exposition, ''Chrono Cross'' is not a remake of ''Radical Dreamers'', but a larger effort to fulfill that game's purpose; the plots of the games are irreconcilable.&lt;ref name=&quot;weeklyfamitsu&quot; /&gt; To resolve continuity issues and acknowledge ''Radical Dreamers'', the developers of ''Chrono Cross'' suggested the game happened in a parallel [[dimension]].&lt;ref name=&quot;radical-continuity&quot;&gt;{{cite video game|title= Chrono Cross|developer=Square|publisher=Square|date=2000-08-15|platform=PlayStation|level=Chronopolis|quote='''Kid''': Kid: Radical Dreamers&amp;nbsp;...!?

This seems to be an archive from a different time than our own. / '''Kid''': Aside from the two worlds we already know about&amp;nbsp;... there may be other worlds and times which exist&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable difference between the two games is that Magus—present in ''Radical Dreamers'' as Gil—is absent from ''Chrono Cross''. Director Masato Kato originally planned for Magus to appear in disguise as Guile, but scrapped the idea due to plot difficulties.&lt;ref name=&quot;weeklyfamitsu&quot; /&gt; In the DS version of Chrono Trigger, Kato teases the possibility of an amnesiac Magus.&lt;ref name=&quot;magusdsending&quot;&gt;{{cite video game|title=Chrono Trigger|developer=Square Enix|publisher=Square Enix|date=2008-11-25|platform=Nintendo DS|level=Twilight Grotto|quote='''Magus''': Hmph.

==Development==
Square began planning ''Chrono Cross'' immediately after the release of ''[[Xenogears]]'' in 1998. ''Chrono Trigger''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s scenario director Masato Kato had brainstormed ideas for a sequel as early as 1996, following the release of ''[[Radical Dreamers]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;kato-acknowledgment&quot; /&gt; Square's managers selected a team, appointed [[Hiromichi Tanaka]] producer, and asked Kato to direct and develop a new ''[[Chrono (series)|Chrono]]'' game in the spirit of ''Radical Dreamers''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot;&gt;{{cite book|year=1999|title=Chrono Cross Ultimania|url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Supporting_Material_Translation.html#Developer_Interviews|pages=478–481|language=Japanese|publisher=Square Enix|isbn=4-925075-73-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kato and Tanaka decided to produce an indirect sequel. They acknowledged that Square would soon re-release ''Chrono Trigger'' as part of ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]'', which would give players a chance to catch up on the story of ''Trigger'' before playing ''Cross''. Kato felt that using a different setting and cast for ''Chrono Cross'' would allow players unfamiliar with ''Chrono Trigger'' to play ''Cross'' without becoming confused.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; The ''Chrono Cross'' team decided against integrating heavy use of [[time travel]] into the game, as they felt it would be &quot;rehashing and cranking up the volume of the last game&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; Masato Kato cited the belief, &quot;there's no use in making something similar to before [''sic'']&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;kato-acknowledgment&quot; /&gt; and with Tanaka, further explained:

[[File:Tanaka.jpg|right|thumb|Hiromichi Tanaka, producer|alt=A Japanese man with left-parted hair, a brown leather jacket, and a blue shirt]]
{{cquote2|We didn't want to directly extend Chrono Trigger into a sequel, but create a new Chrono with links to the original.&lt;ref name=&quot;weeklyfamitsu&quot; /&gt; Yes, the platform changed; and yes, there were many parts that changed dramatically from the previous work. But in my view, the whole point in making ''Chrono Cross'' was to make a new ''Chrono'' with the best available skills and technologies of today. I never had any intentions of just taking the system from ''Trigger'' and moving it onto the PlayStation console. That's why I believe that ''Cross'' is ''Cross'', and NOT ''Trigger'' 2.&lt;ref name=&quot;kato-acknowledgment&quot; /&gt;|Masato Kato}}

{{cquote2|When creating a series, one method is to carry over a basic system, improving upon it as the series progresses, but our stance has been to create a completely new and different world from the ground up, and to restructure the former style. Therefore, ''Chrono Cross'' is not a sequel to ''Chrono Trigger''. Had it been, it would have been called ''Chrono Trigger 2''. Our main objective for ''Chrono Cross'' was to share a little bit of the ''Chrono Trigger'' worldview, while creating a completely different game as a means of providing new entertainment to the player. This is mainly due to the transition in platform generation from the SNES to the PS. The method I mentioned above, about improving upon a basic system, has inefficiencies, in that it's impossible to maximize the console's performance as the console continues to make improvements in leaps and bounds. Although essentially an RPG, at its core, it is a computer game, and I believe that games should be expressed with a close connection to the console's performance. Therefore, in regards to game development, our goal has always been to &quot;express the game utilizing the maximum performance of the console at that time.&quot; I strongly believe that anything created in this way will continue to be innovative.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameprointerview&quot; /&gt;|Hiromichi Tanaka}}

Full production began on ''Chrono Cross'' in mid-1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameprointerview&quot; /&gt; The ''Chrono Cross'' team reached 80 members at its peak, with additional personnel of 10–20 cut-scene artists and 100 quality assurance testers.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameprointerview&quot; /&gt; The team felt pressure to live up to the work of ''Chrono Trigger''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s &quot;Dream Team&quot; development group, which included famous [[mangaka]] [[Akira Toriyama]].&lt;ref name=&quot;weeklyfamitsu&quot; /&gt; Kato and Tanaka hired [[Nobuteru Yūki]] for character design and [[Yasuyuki Honne]] for art direction and concept art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Chrono Cross |developer=[[Square Co., Ltd.]] |publisher=Square Co., Ltd. |date=1999-11-18 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event team originally envisioned a short game, and planned a system by which players would befriend any person in a town for alliance in battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; Developers brainstormed traits and archetypes during the character-creation process, originally planning 64 characters with unique endings that could vary in three different ways per character.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameprointerview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; Kato described the character creation process: &quot;Take Pierre, for example: we started off by saying we wanted a wacko fake hero like Tata from ''Trigger''. We also said things like 'we need at least one powerful mom,' 'no way we're gonna go without a twisted brat,' and so on so forth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gameprointerview&quot; /&gt; As production continued, the length of ''Cross'' increased, leading the event team to reduce the number of characters to 45 and scrap most of the alternate endings.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; Developers humorous named the character Pip &quot;Tsumaru&quot; in Japanese (which means &quot;packed&quot;) as a pun on their attempts to pack as much content into the game as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; To avoid the burden of writing unique, accented dialogue for several characters, team member Kiyoshi Yoshii coded a system that produces accents by modifying basic text for certain characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameprointerview&quot; /&gt;

The ''Chrono Cross'' team devised an original battle system using a stamina bar and Elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameprointerview&quot; /&gt; Kato planned the system around allowing players to avoid repetitive gameplay (also known as &quot;[[grinding (gaming)|grinding]]&quot;) to gain combat experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;weeklyfamitsu&quot; /&gt; Hiromichi Tanaka likened the Elements system to card games, hoping players would feel a sense of complete control in battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;weeklyfamitsu&quot; /&gt; The team programmed each battle motion manually instead of performing motion capture.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; Developers strove to include tongue-in-cheek humor in the battle system's techniques and animations to distance the game from the ''Final Fantasy'' franchise.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; Masato Kato planned for the game's setting to feature a small archipelago, for fear that players would become confused traveling in large areas with respect to parallel worlds.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameprointerview&quot; /&gt; He hoped El Nido would still impart a sense of grand scale, and the development team pushed hardware limitations in creating the game's world.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameprointerview&quot; /&gt; To create field maps, the team modeled locations in 3D, then chose the best angle for 2D rendering.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; The programmers of ''Chrono Cross'' did not use any existing Square programs or routines to code the game, instead writing new, proprietary systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameprointerview&quot; /&gt; Other innovations included variable-[[frame rate]] code for fast-forward and slow-motion gameplay (awarded as a bonus for completing the game) and a &quot;CD-read swap&quot; system to allow quick data retrieval.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameprointerview&quot; /&gt;

Masato Kato directed and wrote the main story, leaving sub-plots and minor character events to other staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameprointerview&quot; /&gt; The event team sometimes struggled to mesh their work on the plot due to the complexity of the parallel worlds concept.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; Masato Kato confirmed that ''Cross'' featured a central theme of parallel worlds, as well as the fate of Schala, which he was previously unable to expound upon in ''Chrono Trigger''. Concerning the ending sequences showing Kid searching for someone in a modern city, he hoped to make players realize that alternate futures and possibilities may exist in their own lives, and that this realization would &quot;not&amp;nbsp;... stop with the game&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; He later added, &quot;Paraphrasing one novelist's favorite words, what's important is not the message or theme, but how it is portrayed as a game. Even in Cross, it was intentionally made so that the most important question was left unanswered.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gameprointerview&quot; /&gt; Kato described the finished story as &quot;ole' boy-meets-girl type of story&quot; with sometimes-shocking twists.&lt;ref name=&quot;kato-acknowledgment&quot; /&gt; Square advertised the game by releasing a short demo of the first chapter with purchases of ''[[Legend of Mana]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;crossdemo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Chrono Cross Demo|url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Chrono_Cross_Demo.html|accessdate= 2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North American version of ''Cross'' required three months of translation and two months of debugging before release.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameprointerview&quot; /&gt; Richard Honeywood translated, working with Kato to rewrite certain dialogue for ease of comprehension in English.&lt;ref name=&quot;edgemagazine&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|month=February|title=Edge Online: Q&amp;A – Square Enix's Richard Honeywood|url=http://www.edge-online.co.uk/archives/2006/02/qa_square_enixs_1.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060517012317/http://www.edge-online.co.uk/archives/2006/02/qa_square_enixs_1.php|archivedate=2006-05-17|work=Edge Online| accessdate=2006-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also added instances of wordplay and alliteration to compensate for difficult Japanese jokes.&lt;ref name=&quot;edgemagazine&quot; /&gt; Although the trademark ''Chrono Cross'' was registered in the European Union, the game was not released in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OAMI-ONLINE – CTM-ONLINE – Trade mark consultation service|url=http://oami.europa.eu/CTMOnline/RequestManager/en_Result_NoReg|accessdate=2010-05-12}} To find the Chrono Cross trademarks, search &quot;Trade mark name&quot; for &quot;chrono cross&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chrono Cross'' was scored by freelance video game music composer [[Yasunori Mitsuda]], who previously worked on ''Chrono Trigger''. Director Masato Kato personally commissioned Mitsuda's involvement, citing a need for the &quot;Chrono sound&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;kato-acknowledgment&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; Kato envisioned a &quot;Southeast Asian feel, mixed with the foreign tastes and the tones of countries such as Greece&quot;; Mitsuda centered his work around [[old world]] cultural influences, including [[Mediterranean]], [[Fado]], [[Celtic music|Celtic]], and percussive [[Music of Africa|African]] music.&lt;ref name=&quot;kato-acknowledgment&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;crossost&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=2000-12-18|first=Yasunori|last=Mitsuda|title=Chrono Cross OST Liner Notes| url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Music_(Chrono_Cross)|work=Chrono Compendium|accessdate=2006-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitsuda cited visual inspiration for songs: &quot;All of my subjects are taken from scenery. I love artwork.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gameprointerview&quot; /&gt; To complement the theme of parallel worlds, he gave ''Another'' and ''Home'' respectively dark and bright moods, and hoped players would feel the emotions of &quot;'burning soul,' 'lonely world,' and 'unforgettable memories'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; Mitsuda and Kato planned music samples and sound effects with the philosophy of &quot;a few sounds with a lot of content&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;weeklyfamitsu&quot; /&gt;

''[[Xenogears]]'' contributor [[Tomohiko Kira]] played guitar on the beginning and ending themes. [[Noriko Mitose]], as selected by Masato Kato, sang the ending song—&quot;Radical Dreamers – The Unstolen Jewel&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; [[Ryo Yamazaki]], a [[synthesizer programmer]] for [[Square Enix]], helped Mitsuda transfer his ideas to the PlayStation's sound capabilities; Mitsuda was happy to accomplish even half of what he envisioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;crossost&quot; /&gt; Certain songs were ported from the score of ''[[Radical Dreamers]]'', such as ''Gale'', ''Frozen Flame'', and ''Viper Mansion''. Other entries in the soundtrack contain [[leitmotif]]s from ''Chrono Trigger'' and ''Radical Dreamers''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; The melody of ''Far Promise ~ Dream Shore'' features prominently in ''The Dream That Time Dreams'' and ''Voyage ~ Another World.''&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; Masato Kato faced internal opposition in hiring Noriko Mitose:

{{cquote2|Personally, for me, the biggest pressure was coming from the ending theme song. From the start of the project, I had already planned to make the ending into a Japanese song, but the problem was now &quot;who was going to sing the song?&quot; There was a lot of pressure from the people in the PR division to get someone big and famous to sing it, but I was totally against the idea. And as usual, I didn't heed to the surrounding complaints, but this time, there was a pretty tough struggle.&lt;ref name=&quot;kato-acknowledgment&quot; /&gt;|Masato Kato}}

[[File:Yasunori Mitsuda.jpg‎|thumb|left|150px|alt=A photograph of a thin, dark-haired Japanese man|Yasunori Mitsuda, composer]]
Production required six months of work.

Reviewers felt the game's flaws were its vague ending, confusing plot elements, and narrative pacing problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;ignreview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rpgfanreview&quot; /&gt; Fan reaction was largely positive, though certain fans complained that the game was a far departure from its predecessor, ''Chrono Trigger''; ''Chrono Cross'' broke convention by featuring more characters, fewer double and triple techs, fewer instances of time travel, and few appearances of ''Trigger'' characters and locations.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfect-10&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kato-acknowledgment&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=1999|month=November|title=Procyon Studio: Interview with Masato Kato|url=http://www.cocoebiz.com/mitsuda/english/friends/kato.html|accessdate=2006-07-24|archiveurl= http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Procyon_Studio.html|archivedate=2004-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer Hiromichi Tanaka and director Masato Kato were aware of the changes in development, specifically intending to provide an experience different from ''Chrono Trigger''.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameprointerview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kato-acknowledgment&quot; /&gt; Kato anticipated and rebuffed this discontent before the game's release, wondering what the ''Chrono'' title meant to these fans and whether his messages ever &quot;really got through to them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;kato-acknowledgment&quot; /&gt; He continued, &quot;''Cross'' is undoubtedly the highest quality ''Chrono'' that we can create right now. (I won't say the 'best' ''Chrono'', but) If you can't accept that, then I'm sorry to say this but I guess your ''Chrono'' and my ''Chrono'' have taken totally different paths. But I would like to say, thank you for falling in love with ''Trigger'' so much.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kato-acknowledgment&quot; /&gt; Tanaka added, &quot;Of course, the fans of the original are very important, but what innovation can come about when you're bound to the past?

==Sequels==
There is no planned continuation of the [[Chrono (series)|''Chrono'' series]]. In 2001, [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] revealed the company's staff wanted to develop a new game and were discussing script ideas.

'''Planned economy''' is an [[economic system]] in which the [[State (polity)|state]] directs the [[economy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alec Nove]] (1987), &quot;planned economy,&quot; ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, pp. 879–80.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is an economic system in which the central government controls industry such that it makes major decisions regarding the production and distribution of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book

Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 11 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; '''centrally planned economy''', or '''command and control economy'''.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Barth and Gerard Caprio, Jr. China's Changing Financial System: Can It Catch Up With, or Even Drive Growth. Networks Financial Institute. March 2007; Thomas O Bouman and David George Brand. Sustainable Forests: Global Challenges and Local Solutions. Haworth Press 1997 page 91&lt;/ref&gt;

In such economies, central [[economic planning]] by the [[State (polity)|state]] or [[government]] controls all major sectors of the economy and formulates all decisions about the use of resources and the distribution of output.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Danny. ''Construction Economics'' (2004), Spon Press (UK), p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; Planners decide what should be produced and direct lower-level enterprises to produce those goods in accordance with national and social objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Ollman, Bertell. ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists'' (1997), Routledge (UK), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Planned economies are in contrast to [[unplanned economies]], i.e. the [[market economy]], where production, distribution, pricing, and investment decisions are made by the private owners of the factories of production based upon their individual interests rather than upon a [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] plan. Less extensive forms of planned economies include those that use [[indicative planning]], in which the state employs &quot;influence, subsidies, grants, and taxes, but does not compel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alec Nove]] (1987), &quot;Planned Economy,&quot; ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, p. 879.&lt;/ref&gt; This latter is sometimes referred to as a &quot;planned market economy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |author=John Barkley |title=''Comparative Economics in Transforming World Economy'' |publisher=MIT |page=10 |date=1991 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A planned economy may consist of state-owned enterprises, private enterprises directed by the state, or a combination of both. Though &quot;planned economy&quot; and &quot;command economy&quot; are often used as synonyms, some make the distinction that under a command economy, the means of production are publicly owned. That is, a planned economy is &quot;an economic system in which the government controls and regulates production, distribution, prices, etc.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/planned%20economy planned economy]. Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Random House, Inc. (accessed: May 11, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; but a command economy, while also having this type of regulation, necessarily has substantial public ownership of industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/command%20economy command economy]. In Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary (2008) (accessed May 11, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, command economies are planned economies, but not necessarily the reverse.

Beginning in the 1980s and 1990s, many governments presiding over planned economies began deregulating (or as in the Soviet Union, the system collapsed) and moving toward market-based economies by allowing the private sector to make the pricing, production, and distribution decisions. Although most economies today are [[market economy|market economies]] or [[mixed economy|mixed economies]] (which are partially planned), planned economies exist in very few countries such as [[Economy of Cuba|Cuba]], [[Economy of Libya|Libya]], [[Economy of North Korea|North Korea]], [[Economy of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], and [[Economy of Burma|Myanmar]].&lt;ref&gt;von Brabant, Jozef M. ''The Planned Economies and International Economic Organizations'', Cambridge University Press, 1991, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic planning versus the command economy==
{{Main|Economic planning}}
{{See also|Dirigisme}}

Economic planning is a mechanism for resource allocation of inputs and decision-making based on direct allocation, in contrast with the [[Market economy|market mechanism]], which is based on indirect allocation.&lt;ref&gt;''In Defense of Socialist Planning'', by Mandel, Ernest. 1986. From &quot;New Left Review&quot;: &quot;Planning is not equivalent to ‘perfect’ allocation of resources, nor ‘scientific’ allocation, nor even ‘more humane’ allocation. It simply means ‘direct’ allocation, ex ante. As such, it is the opposite of market allocation, which is ex post.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; An economy based on economic planning (either through the state, an association of [[worker cooperative]]s or another economic entity that has jurisdiction over the means of production) appropriates its resources as needed, so that allocation comes in the form of internal transfers rather than market transactions involving the purchasing of assets by one government agency or firm by another. Decision-making is carried out by workers and consumers on the enterprise-level.

This is contrasted with the concept of a centrally-planned, or command economy, where most of the economy is planned by a central government authority, and organized along a top-down administration where decisions regarding investment, production output requirements are decided upon by planners from the top, or near the top, of the chain of command. Advocates of economic planning have sometimes been staunch critics of command economies and centralized planning. For example, [[Leon Trotsky]] believed that central planners, regardless of their intellectual capacity, operated without the input and participation of the millions of people who participate in the economy and understand/respond to local conditions and changes in the economy would be unable to effectively coordinate all economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;''Writings 1932-33, P.96'', Leon Trotsky.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key difference is that command economies are strictly authoritarian in nature, whereas some forms of economic planning, such as [[indicative planning]], direct the economy through incentive-based methods. Economic planning can be practiced in a decentralized manner through different government authorities. For example, in some predominately market-oriented and mixed economies, the state utilizes economic planning in strategic industries such as the aerospace industry.

Another example of this is the utilization of [[dirigisme]], both of which were practiced in France and Great Britain after the Second World War. Swedish public housing models were planned by the government in a similar fashion as [[urban planning]]. Mixed economies usually employ macroeconomic planning, while micro-economic affairs are left to the market and price system.

The [[People's Republic of China]] currently has a [[socialist market economy]] in place. Within this system, macroeconomic plans are used as a general guidelines and as government goals for the national economy, but the majority of [[government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprises]] are subject to market forces. This is heavily contrasted to the command economy model of the former Soviet Union.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Decentrally Planned economy===
A decentrally planned economy is an economy where members of a society, acting with equal economic power, democratically plan economic activity.

The 1970 Chilean computer controlled planned economy [[cybersyn]] was pioneered by [[Salvador Allende]]'s socialist government, in an attempt to move towards decentralised planning with the experimental [http://www.cybersyn.cl/ingles/cybersyn/cyberfolk.html cyberfolk] component.

During the [[Spanish Revolution]] some Anarchist areas were run under decentralised planning following the principles laid out by [[Diego Abad de Santillan]] in the book After the Revolution [http://membres.multimania.fr/anarchives/site/syndic/aftertherevolution.htm#local]

De-centralised planning has been a feature in [[socialist]] and [[anarchist economics]]. Variations of decentralized planning include [[participatory economics]], [[economic democracy]] and [[industrial democracy]], and have been promoted by various political groups, most notably [[libertarian socialist]]s, [[Trotskyist]]s, [[Anarchist]]s and [[democratic socialist]]s.

==Planned economies and socialism==
{{Socialism sidebar}}
{{Main|Socialist economics}}
{{See also|State capitalism}}

In the 20th century, most planned economies were implemented by states that called themselves [[socialism|socialist]]. Also, the greatest support for planned production comes from socialist authors. For these reasons, the notion of a planned economy is often directly associated with socialism. However, they do not entirely overlap. There are branches of socialism such as [[Mutualism (economic theory)|libertarian socialism]] and [[market socialism]], that reject economic planning as a substitute for market allocation. All of these tendencies usually reject centralized ownership, referring to such as ''[[state socialism]]'' or ''[[state capitalism]]'', and instead advocate decentralized ownership based on worker cooperatives and [[workers' self-management|worker self-management]].

While many socialist currents advocated economic planning as an eventual substitute for the market for factors of production, socialists define economic planning as being based on worker-self management, with production being carried out to [[Production for use|directly satisfy human needs]], and contrast this with the concept of a ''command economy'' of the Soviet Union, which they characterize as being based on a top-down bureaucratic administration of the economy in a similar fashion to a capitalist firm.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Command Economy&quot;, Marxists.org Glossary of Terms: http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/o.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Command economy is distinguished from economic planning, and different theories for classifying the socioeconomic system of the Soviet Union exist; most notably a command economy is associated with [[Bureaucratic collectivism]], [[State capitalism]], [[State socialism]] or [[Coordinatorism]].

Furthermore, planned economies are not unique to [[Communist state]]s. There is a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] theory of [[permanent arms economy]], put forward by [[Michael Kidron]], which leads on from the contention that war and accompanying [[industrialisation]] is a continuing feature of capitalist states and that central planning and other features of the [[war economy]] are ever present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/perm/perm.htm &quot;A Permanent Arms Economy&quot;] by Michael Kidron, first printed in ''International Socialism'' 1:28 (Spring 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

The shift from a command economy to a market economy has proven to be difficult; in particular, there were no theoretical guides for doing so before the 1990s. One transition from a command economy to a market economy that many consider successful is that of the [[People's Republic of China]], in which there was a period of some years lasting roughly until the early 1990s during which both the command economy and the market economy coexisted, so that nobody would be much worse off under a mixed economy than a command economy, while some people would be much better off. This 'success' was coupled with a massive disparity between rich and poor and a disturbing new level of corruption, and 90% of Chinese billionaires are related to members of the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Klien, The Shock Doctrine.&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually, the parts of the economy under the command economy decreased until the mid-1990s when resource allocation was almost completely determined by market mechanisms{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

By contrast, the [[Soviet Union]]'s transition was much more problematic and its [[succession of states|successor republic]]s faced a sharp decline in [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] during the early 1990s. One of the suggested causes is that under Soviet planning, price ceilings created major problems (shortages, queuing for bread, households hoarding money) which made the transition to an unplanned economy less easy. While the transition to a market economy proved difficult, many of the post-Soviet states have been experiencing strong, resource-based economic growth in recent years, though the levels vary substantially. However, a majority of the former Soviet Republics have not yet reached pre-collapse levels of economic development.

Still, most of the economic hardship that struck many of the former [[East Bloc]] countries and the post-Soviet states comes from the program of [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]. The idea behind this program is to convert from a centrally planned economy to a market economy in a short space of time. This means mass-scale [[privatization]], budget cuts and liberalization of economy and finance regulations. This shock therapy program was implemented in several former communist states like [[Poland]] and [[Russia]].

[[Iraq]], after the fall of [[Saddam Hussein]] following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], is currently experiencing the transition from a command economy under Hussein to a free market economy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.twq.com/04autumn/docs/04autumn_crocker.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran]] is currently [[Privatization in Iran|privatizing companies]].

==Advantages of economic planning==
{{Refimprove|section|date=August 2010}}

===Stability===
Long-term infrastructure investment can be made without fear of a market downturn (or loss of confidence) leading to abandonment of a project. This is especially important where returns are risky (''e.g.'' [[fusion reactor]] technology) or where the return is diffuse (''e.g.'' [[immunization]] programs or [[public education]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Meeting collective objectives===
Planned economies may be intended to serve [[collective]] rather than [[individual]] needs: under such a system, rewards, whether wages or perquisites, are to be distributed according to the value that the state ascribes to the service performed. A planned economy eliminates the individual [[profit motive]]s as the driving force of production and places it in the hands of the state planners to determine what is the appropriate production of different sets of goods.

The government can harness land, labor, and capital to serve the economic objectives of the state. Consumer demand can be restrained in favor of greater capital investment for economic development in a desired pattern. The state can begin building a heavy industry at once in an underdeveloped economy without waiting years for capital to accumulate through the expansion of light industry, and without reliance on external financing. This is what happened in the Soviet Union during the 1930s when the government forced the share of GNP dedicated to private consumption from 80 percent to 50.0 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy. The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, pp. 322–3&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Soviet Union experienced massive growth in heavy industry.

===Comparison with capitalist corporations===
Taken as a whole, a centrally planned economy would attempt to substitute a number of firms with a single firm for an entire economy. As such, the stability of a planned economy has implications with the [[Theory of the firm]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} After all, most corporations are essentially 'centrally planned economies'{{dubious|date=October 2010}}, aside from some token intra-corporate pricing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} As pointed out by [[Kenneth Arrow]] and others, the existence of firms in free markets shows that there is a need for firms in free markets; opponents of planned economies would simply argue that there is no need for a sole firm for the entire economy. [[Anarchist]] theorists like [[Kevin Carson]] however point to the numerous ways in which government intervention in the market magnify economies of scale, offsetting the natural inefficiencies of centrally planned economies by means of privileges and historical subsidies granted by force, and argues that in a truly free market corporations wouldn't exist.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Advantages over market economies===
An advantage of a planned economy, one which was among the most important for socialist economists of the early 20th century, is that it is not subject to major pitfalls of [[market economies]] and marked-oriented [[mixed economies]]. A planned economy, in theory, does not suffer from [[business cycle]]s; it does not experience crises of [[overproduction]] such as the one that was believed to have contributed to the [[Great Depression]]. From the modern perspective, it does not result in asset bubbles – massive [[austrian business cycle theory|misallocations]] of resources such as the [[dot-com bubble]] of the late 1990s or the [[housing bubble]] of mid-2000s.

The other aspect is that a centrally planned economy can provide [[public goods]] which would not have been available at all, or might require explicit government provision, in a market economy, resulting in a mixed economy. In a mixed economy, the government would have to achieve this goal through taxation or inflation. In a planned economy, state planners would allocate state resources toward public goods and state projects.

==Disadvantages of economic planning==
===Inefficient resource distribution: surplus and shortage===
Critics of planned economies argue that planners cannot detect consumer preferences, shortages, and surpluses with sufficient accuracy and therefore cannot efficiently co-ordinate production (in a market economy, a [[free price system]] is intended to serve this purpose). For example, even though the [[Soviet Union]] had its own passenger car manufacturing industry going back to 1940's, it was impossible for a Soviet citizen to simply walk into a store and buy a car—the entire output of all car manufacturing plants was allocated for years in advance. From the modern viewpoint, such a shortage indicates a mismatch between supply and demand—suggesting that planners have misjudged the demand for the product, the equilibrium price, or both. An imbalance, which would have been corrected naturally in a matter of years in a free-market economy, persisted for decades, while central planners turned a blind eye on it.

This difficulty was first noted by economist [[Ludwig von Mises]], who called it the &quot;[[economic calculation problem]]&quot;. Economist [[János Kornai]] developed this into a [[shortage economy]] theory (advocates could claim that shortages were not primarily caused by lack of supply).

A problem of surpluses exists. Surpluses indicate a waste of labour and materials that could have been applied to more pressing needs of society. Critics of central planning say that a market economy prevents long-term surpluses because the operation of supply and demand causes the price to sink when supply begins exceeding demand, indicating to producers to stop production or face losses. This frees resources to be applied to satisfy short-term shortages of other commodities, as determined by their rising prices as demand begins exceeding supply.

It is argued that this &quot;[[invisible hand]]&quot; prevents long-term shortages and surpluses and allows maximum efficiency in satisfying the wants of consumers. Critics argue that since in a planned economy prices are not allowed to float freely, there is no accurate mechanism to determine what is being produced in unnecessarily large amounts and what is being produced in insufficient amounts. They argue that efficiency is best achieved through a market economy where individual producers each make their own production decisions based on their own profit motive.

In particular, it is possible to create unprofitable but socially useful goods within the context of a market economy. For example, one could produce a new drug by having the government collect taxes and then spend the money for the social good.It is possible to see things of value being produced by the state taxing and using those funds to undertake projects which are believed to be social goods, but not to see what social goods have ''not'' been produced due to wealth taken out of the hands of those who would have invested and spent their money in other ways according to their own goals.

These opponents of central planning argue that the only way to determine what society actually wants is by allowing private enterprise to use their resources in competing to meet the needs of consumers, rather those taking resources away and allowing government to direct investment without responding to market signals. According to Tibor R. Machan, &quot;Without a market in which allocations can be made in obedience to the law of supply and demand, it is difficult or impossible to funnel resources with respect to actual human preferences and goals.&quot;&lt;ref name=tibor2001&gt;Machan, R. Tibor, [http://media.hoover.org/documents/0817929428_xi.pdf ''Some Skeptical Reflections on Research and Development''], Hoover Press&lt;/ref&gt;

If the government in question is democratic, democratically-determined social priorities may be considered legitimate social objectives in which the government is justified in intervening in the economy. It must be noted that to date, most if not all countries employing command economies have been [[dictatorships]] or [[oligarchies]]{{ndash}} few or none were [[democracies]]. Many democratic nations, however, have a [[mixed economy]], where the government intervenes to a certain extent and in certain aspects of the economy, although other aspects of the economy are left to the free market.

===Suppression of economic democracy and self-management===
Central planning is also criticized by elements of the radical left. Libertarian socialist economist [[Robin Hahnel]] notes that, even if central planning overcame its inherent inhibitions of incentives and innovation, it would nevertheless be unable to maximize economic democracy and self-management, which he believes are concepts that are more intellectually coherent, consistent and just than mainstream notions of economic freedom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hahnel, Robin 2002&quot;&gt;Hahnel, Robin. The ABC's of Political Economy, Pluto Press, 2002, 262&lt;/ref&gt;

As Hahnel explains, &quot;Combined with a more democratic political system, and redone to closer approximate a best case version, centrally planned economies no doubt would have performed better. But they could never have delivered economic self-management, they would always have been slow to innovate as apathy and frustration took their inevitable toll, and they would always have been susceptible to growing inequities and inefficiencies as the effects of differential economic power grew. Under central planning neither planners, managers, nor workers had incentives to promote the social economic interest. Nor did impeding markets for final goods to the planning system enfranchise consumers in meaningful ways. But central planning would have been incompatible with economic democracy even if it had overcome its information and incentive liabilities. And the truth is that it survived as long as it did only because it was propped up by unprecedented totalitarian political power.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hahnel, Robin 2002&quot;/&gt;

Without economic democracy there can be troubles with the flow of knowledge as is shown with the initiative for backyard furnaces and other efforts in the [[Great Leap Forward]].

The '''common chimpanzee''' (''Pan troglodytes''), also known as the '''robust chimpanzee''', is a [[Hominidae|great ape]]. The name ''troglodytes'', Greek for 'cave-dweller', was coined by [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] in his ''Handbuch der Naturgeschichte'' (Handbook of Natural History) published in 1779.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;!--Most sources give 1775; the article [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] argues for 1776; in both cases it is his thesis, not the ''Handbuch'' that is the publication.--&gt; Colloquially, the common chimpanzee is often called the [[chimpanzee]] (or simply 'chimp'), though technically this term refers to both [[species]] in the [[genus]] ''[[Chimpanzee|Pan]]'': the common chimpanzee and the closely-related [[bonobo]], formerly called the pygmy chimpanzee. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing show that both species of chimpanzees are the [[sister taxon|sister group]] to the modern [[Human evolution|human lineage]]. The common chimpanzee is an [[endangered]] species.

==Study {{Anchor|Taxonomy}}==
[[Jane Goodall]] undertook the first long-term field study of the common chimpanzee, begun in [[Tanzania]] at [[Gombe Stream National Park]] in 1960. Other long-term study sites begun in 1960 include A. Kortlandt in eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Junichiro Itani]] in [[Mahale Mountains National Park]] in Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen |first=Joel E. |url= |title=Going Bananas |publisher=American Scholar |date=Winter 1993 |accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current understanding of the species' typical behaviors and social organization are formed largely from Goodall's ongoing 50-year Gombe research study.&lt;ref name=&quot;Power.Anthropologist&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Margaret Power |title=Divergence population genetics of chimpanzees |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=95
 |year=1993 |month=December |pmid= |doi= |url= |pages=1010–11 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxonomy===
DNA evidence published in 2005 suggests the bonobo and common chimpanzee species separated from each other less than one million years ago (similar in relation between ''Homo sapiens'' and [[Neanderthal]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Won YJ, Hey J |title=Divergence population genetics of chimpanzees |journal=Mol. Biol. Evol. |page=297–307|year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15483319 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msi017 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/2/297.full.pdf+html |volume=22|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fischer A, Wiebe V, Pääbo S, Przeworski M |title=Evidence for a complex demographic history of chimpanzees |journal=Mol. Biol. Evol. |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=799–808 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=14963091 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msh083 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chimpanzee line [[human evolution|split]] from the last common ancestor of the [[human]] line approximately six million years ago. Because no species other than ''Homo sapiens'' has survived from the human line of that branching, both chimpanzee species are the closest living relatives of humans.  The chimpanzee's genus, ''Pan'', diverged from the [[gorilla]]'s genus about seven million years ago.

===Subspecies===
Several subspecies of the common chimpanzee have been recognized:
* [[Central chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes troglodytes'', in [[Cameroon]], the [[Central African Republic]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]];
* [[Western chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes verus'', in [[Guinea]], [[Mali]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Ghana]], and [[Nigeria]];
* [[Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes ellioti'', in [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]];
* [[Eastern chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii'', in the [[Central African Republic]], the [[Sudan]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Zambia]].

[[Human]] and common chimpanzee [[DNA]] are very similar. After the completion of the [[Human Genome Project]], a [[Chimpanzee Genome Project]] was initiated. In December 2003, a preliminary analysis of 7600 genes shared between the two genomes confirmed that certain genes, such as the [[FOXP2|forkhead-box P2]] [[transcription factor]] which is involved in speech development, have undergone rapid evolution in the human lineage. A draft version of the chimpanzee genome was published on September 1, 2005, in an article produced by the [[Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium  |title=Initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7055 |pages=69–87 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16136131 |doi=10.1038/nature04072 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7055/full/nature04072.html}}&lt;br/&gt; {{cite journal |author=Cheng Z, Ventura M, She X, ''et al.'' |title=A genome-wide comparison of recent chimpanzee and human segmental duplications |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7055 |pages=88–93 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16136132 |doi=10.1038/nature04000 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7055/full/nature04000.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA sequence differences between humans and chimpanzees is about thirty-five million [[Point mutation|single-nucleotide]] changes, five million [[Mutation#By effect on structure|insertion/deletion]] events, and various [[chromosome|chromosomal]] [[Chromosomal translocation|rearrangements]]. Typical human and chimp [[protein]] [[homology (biology)|homologs]] differ in only an average of two [[amino acid]]s. About 30% of all human proteins are identical in sequence to the corresponding chimp protein. Duplications of small parts of [[chromosome]]s have been the major source of differences between human and chimp genetic material; about 2.7% of the corresponding modern genomes represent differences, produced by gene duplications or deletions, during the approximately four to six million years since humans and chimps diverged from their common evolutionary ancestor. Results from human and chimp genome analyses, currently being conducted by [[geneticist]]s including [[David Reich (geneticist)|David Reich]], should help in understanding the genetic basis of some human diseases.

==Description==
Adults in the wild weigh between {{convert|40|and|65|kg|abbr=on}}, though males in captivity such as [[Travis the Chimp]] have reached 200 pounds; males can measure up to {{convert|1.6|m|abbr=on}} and females to {{convert|1.3|m|abbr=on}}. Their body is covered by a coarse black hair, except for the face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Both their thumbs and their big toes are opposable, allowing a precision grip. Their [[pregnancy|gestation]] period is eight months. Infants are weaned when they are about three years old, but usually maintain a close relationship with their mother for several more years; they reach [[puberty]] at the age of eight to ten, and their lifespan in captivity is about fifty years. Common chimpanzees are both [[Brachiation|arboreal]] and terrestrial, spending equal time in the trees and on the ground.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} Their habitual gait is [[quadruped]]al, using the soles of their feet and resting on their knuckles, but they can walk upright for short distances. Common chimpanzees are 'knuckle walkers', like [[gorilla]]s, in contrast to the quadrupedal locomotion of [[orangutan]]s and bonobos, 'palm walkers' who use the outside edge of their palms.

==Ecology==
[[File:Gombe Stream NP Beute.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Chimpanzee in a tree with a kill]] 
The common chimpanzee is a highly adaptable species. They live in a variety of habitats including, dry savanna, evergreen rainforest, montane forest, swamp forest, and dry woodland-savanna mosaic.&lt;ref name=Poulsen2004&gt;Poulsen JR, Clark CJ. (2004) &quot;Densities, distributions, and seasonal movements of gorillas and chimpanzees in swamp forest in northern Congo&quot;. ''Int J Prim'' 25(2): 285-306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodall1986/&gt; In [[Gombe Stream National Park|Gombe]] chimps live in subalpine moorland, open woodland, semideciduous forest, evergreen forest, grassland with scattered trees.&lt;ref name=Goodall1986/&gt; At [[Bossou]], chimpanzee inhabit multi-stage secondary deciduous forest arising in areas abandoned due to [[shifting agriculture]]. They also live in primary forest and grassland.&lt;ref&gt;Sugiyama Y, Koman J. (1987) &quot;A preliminary list of chimpanzees' alimentation at Bossou, Guinea&quot;. ''Primates'' 28(1): 133-47.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Taï National Park|Taï]], chimps can be found in the last remaining tropical rainforest in [[Côte d'Ivoire]].&lt;ref name=Boesch2000&gt;Boesch C, Boesch-Achermann H. (2000) ''The chimpanzees of the Taï Forest: behavioral ecology and evolution''. Oxford, England: Oxford Univ Pr.&lt;/ref&gt; Chimps have advanced [[cognitive map]]s of their home ranges which they use to repeatedly locate food resources. A noisy group of animals, like birds or other primate, may direct a chimp to a new food source. They also may be lead to a new fruit tree or termite mound by a foraging partner that been there previously.&lt;ref name=Goodall1986/&gt; The chimpanzee makes a night nest in a tree in a new location every night, with every chimpanzee in a separate nest other than infants or small chimpanzees, who sleep with their mothers.&lt;ref name=&quot;behaviour monographs&quot;/&gt; When confronted by a predator, chimpanzees will react with loud screams and use any object they can against the threat. [[Leopard]] attacks apparently can be a significant cause of mortality in chimpanzees at Taï and [[Lopé National Park]].&lt;ref name=Boesch2000/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henschel P, Abernethy KA, White LJT. (2005) &quot;Leopard food habits in the Lopé National Park, Gabon, Central Africa&quot;.

Most of the chimpanzee’s diet is made up of fruit. Chimps prefer fruit above all other food items and will even eat them when they are not abundant. They will also eat leaves and leaf buds. Seeds, blossoms, stems, pith, bark and resin make up the rest of their diet.&lt;ref name=Goodall1986/&gt; While chimps are mostly [[herbivorous]], they do eat honey, soil, insects, birds and their eggs and small to medium-sized mammals, including other primates.&lt;ref&gt;Isabirye-Basuta G.

Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded using tools. They will modify sticks, rocks, grass, and leaves and use them for acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts, and water. Despite the lack of complexity, there does seem to be forethought and skill in making theses tools and should be considered such.&lt;ref name=Boesch1993&gt;Boesch C, Boesch H.

Oxford, England: Oxford Univ Pr; p 158-87.&lt;/ref&gt; While it has been known since Jane Goodall's 1960s discovery that modern chimpanzees use tools, research published in 2007 indicates that chimpanzee stone tool use dates to at least 4,300 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mercader J, Barton H, Gillespie J, ''et al.'' |title=4,300-year-old chimpanzee sites and the origins of percussive stone technology |journal=Proc.

When hunting small monkeys like the red colobus, chimps hunt in areas where the forest canopy is interrupted or irregular.&lt;ref name=Leipzig2002&gt;G Leipzig. (2002) &quot;COOPERATIVE HUNTING ROLES AMONG TAI CHIMPANZEES&quot;. ''Human Nature'' 13(1):27-46&lt;/ref&gt; This allows them to easily corner the monkeys when chasing them in the appropriate direction. Chimps may also hunt as a coordinated team so that they can corner their prey even in a continuous canopy.&lt;ref name=Leipzig2002/&gt; During an arboreal hunt, each chimp in the hunting groups has a role. &quot;Drivers&quot; serve to keep the prey running an a certain direction and follow them without attempting to make a catch. &quot;Blockers&quot; are station at the bottom of the trees and will climb up to block prey that take off an a different direction. &quot;Chasers&quot; move quickly and try to make a catch. Finally, &quot;ambushers&quot; hide and position themselves where no prey had reached yet and rush out when a monkey nears.&lt;ref name=Leipzig2002/&gt; Both adult and infants are taken. However, adult male black-and-white colobus monkeys will attack the hunting chimps. In Gombe, chimps also fear adult colobus monkeys.&lt;ref name=Goodall1986/&gt; They prefer to snatch infants form their mother’s bellies without harming the mothers. Male chimps hunt more than females. When caught and killed, the meal is distributed to all hunting party members and even bystanders.&lt;ref name=Leipzig2002/&gt;

==Social behavior==
===Group structure===
[[File:Gombe Stream NP gegenseitiges Lausen.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Chimpanzees grooming one another]]
Common chimpanzees live in communities that typically range from 20 to more than 150 members, but spend most of their time travelling in small, temporary groups consisting of a few individuals, &quot;which may consist of any combination of age and sex classes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;behaviour monographs&quot;&gt;Van Lawick-Goodall, Jane (1968). &quot;The Behaviour of Free-Living Chimpanzees in the Gombe Stream Reserve&quot;. Animal Behaviour Monographs (Rutgers University) 1 (3): 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Both males and females will sometimes travel alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;behaviour monographs&quot;/&gt; The common chimpanzee lives in a [[fission-fusion society]], and chimps and may be found in groups of the following types: all-male, adult females and offspring, consisting of both sexes, or one female and her offspring.  Chimpanzees have complex social relationships and spend a large amount of time grooming each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;wild kingdom&quot;&gt;The Chimpanzees of Tanzania&quot;. [[Wild Kingdom]]. December 31, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; At the core of social structures are males, who roam around, protect group members, and search for food. Males remain in their natal communities while females generally emigrate at adolescence. As such, males in a community are more likely to be related to one another than females are to each other.  Among males, there is generally a dominance hierarchy and males are dominant over females.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg TL, Wrangham RW. (1997) &quot;Genetic correlates of social behavior in wild chimpanzees: evidence from mitochondrial DNA&quot;. ''Anim Beh'' 54: 559-70.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this unusual fission-fusion social structure, &quot;in which portions of the parent group may on a regular basis separate from and then rejoin the rest,&quot;&lt;ref name=Goodall1986&gt;{{cite book | last = Goodall | first = Jane | authorlink = Jane Goodall | year = 1986 | title = The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior | isbn = 0674116496}}&lt;/ref&gt; is highly variable in terms of which particular individual chimpanzees congregate at a given time. This is mainly due to chimpanzees having a high level of individual autonomy within their fission-fusion social groups. Also, communities have large ranges that overlap with those of other groups.

[[Image:Adult male chimps in mahale.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Male chimpanzees in Mahale National Park, Tanzania]]
As a result, individual chimpanzees often forage for food alone, or in smaller groups (as opposed to the much larger &quot;parent&quot; group, which encompasses all the chimpanzees who regularly come into contact and congregate into parties in a particular area.) As stated, these smaller groups also emerge in a variety of types, for a variety of purposes. For example, an all-male troop may be organized in order to [[hunting|hunt]] for meat, while a group consisting of lactating females serve to act as &quot;nursery groups&quot; for the young.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper JW, Mitani JC, Watts DP. (1999) &quot;General gregariousness and specific social preferences among wild chimpanzees&quot;. ''Int J Prim'' 20(5): 613-32.&lt;/ref&gt;  An individual may encounter certain individuals quite frequently, but have run-ins with others almost never or only in large-scale gatherings. Due to the varying frequency at which chimpanzees associate, the structure of their societies is highly complicated.

Male chimpanzees exist in a linear dominance hierarchy. Top ranking males tend to be aggressive even during dominance stability.&lt;ref name=Muller2002&gt;Muller, MN. (2002) &quot;Agonistic relations among Kanyawara chimpanzees&quot;. In: Boesch C, Hohmann G, Marchant LF, editors. ''Behavioural diversity in chimpanzees and bonobos''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p 112-124.&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely due to the chimp’s fission-fusion society, with male chimps leaving groups and returning after extended periods of time. With this, a dominant male is unsure is if there has been any &quot;political maneuvering&quot; and must reestablish his dominance. Thus a large amount of aggression occurs 5-15 after reunions.&lt;ref name=Muller2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bygott1979&gt;Bygott, JD. (1979) &quot;Agonistic behavior, dominance, and social structure in wild chimpanzees of  the Gombe National Park&quot;. In: Hamburg, DA, McCown, ER, editors. ''The great apes''. Menlo Park: Benjamin-Cummings. P 73-121.&lt;/ref&gt; During aggressive encounters, displays are preferred over attacks. &lt;ref name=Muller2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bygott1979/&gt; Males maintain and improve their social rank by forming coalitions. These coalitions have been characterized as &quot;exploitive&quot; and are based on  an individual’s willingness to positivity influence agonistic interactions.&lt;ref name=deWaal1987&gt;de Waal, FBM. (1987) &quot;Dynamic of social relationships&quot;. In: Smuts BB, Cheney DL, Seyfarth  RM, Wrangham RW, Struhsaker TT, editors. ''Primate societies''. Chicago: University of  Chicago Press. p. 421-429.&lt;/ref&gt; Being in a coalition allows males to dominate a third individual when they could not by themselves, as politically apt can exert power over aggressive interactions regardless of their rank. Coalitions can also give an individual male the confidence to challenge a dominant male. However most changes in hierarchical rank are caused by  [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] interactions.&lt;ref name=Muller2002/&gt; Chimpanzee alliances can be very fickle and one member may turn on other if it serves him.&lt;ref name=Nishida1986&gt;Nishida, T., M. Hiraiwa-Hasegawa. (1986) &quot;Chimpanzees and Bonobos: Cooperative Relationships among Males&quot;. Pp. 165-177 in B.B. Smuts, D.L. Cheyney, R.M. Seyfarth, R.W. Wrangham, T.T. Struhsaker, eds. ''Primate Societies''. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Low ranking males commonly switch sides in disputes between more dominant individuals. Low ranking males benefit from an unstable hierarchy and have increased sexual opportunities.&lt;ref name=deWaal1987/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nishida1986/&gt; In addition, conflicts between dominant males causes them to focus on each other rather than the lower ranking males. Social hierarchies among adult females tend to be weaker. Neverthless the status of an adult female may be important for her offspring.&lt;ref name=Pusey1997/&gt; Females in Tai have also been recorded to form alliances.&lt;ref&gt; Stumpf, R. (2007) &quot;Chimpanzees and bonobos: Diversity within and between species&quot;. In: Campbell CJ, Fuentes A, Mackinnon KC, Pancer M, Bearder SK, editors. ''Primates in perspective''.

(2001) &quot;Reciprocity and interchange in the social relationships of wild male chimpanzees&quot;. ''Behaviour'' 139:343-370.&lt;/ref&gt; It is more common among adult males than adult females.

Chimpanzees have been described as highly territorial and are known to kill other chimps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh |first=Bryan |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1880229,00.html |title=Why the Stamford Chimp Attacked |publisher=TIME |date=2009-02-18 |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Margaret Power wrote in her 1991 book ''The Egalitarians'' that the field studies from which the aggressive data came, Gombe and Mahale, use artificial feeding systems that increased aggression in the chimpanzee populations studied and therefore might not reflect innate characteristics of the species as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Power.Anthropologist&quot;/&gt; In the years following her artificial feeding conditions at Gombe, Jane Goodall described groups of male chimps patrolling the borders of their territory brutally attacking chimps who had split off from the Gombe group. A study published in 2010 found that chimpanzees conduct wars over land, not mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16422404 |title=Killer Instincts |publisher=The Economist |date=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrol parties from smaller groups are more likely to avoid contact with their neighbors. Patrol parties from large groups will even take over a smaller group's territory, gaining access to more resources, food, and females.&lt;ref name=Goodall1986/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nishida1986/&gt;

===Mating and parenting===
[[File:Gombe Stream NP Mutter und Kind.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Common chimpanzee infant and mother.]]
Chimpanzees mate year round and there is no evidence for a birth season. However, the number of females that are in estrous varies seasonality in a group.&lt;ref name=Boesch2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wallis2002&gt;Wallis J. (2002) &quot;Seasonal aspects of reproduction and sexual behavior in two chimpanzee populations: a comparison of Gombe (Tanzania) and Budongo (Uganda) &quot;. In: Boesch C, Hohmann G, Marchant LF, editors. ''Behavioural diversity in chimpanzees and bonobos''. Cambridge (England): Cambridge Univ Pr. p 181-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Female chimps are more likely into come into estrous when food is readily available. Estrous female exhibit sexual swellings. Chimp mating tends to be [[promiscuous]], with females mating with multiple males in her community during estrous, mostly during the 10-day period of maximal tumescence.&lt;ref name=Goodall1986/&gt; As such, males have large testicles for [[sperm competition]]. However, other forms of mating also exist. Dominant males sometimes restrict access to females in the community. There are also consortships, where a male and female live the community for several days to weeks to mate and extra-pair matings where females live their communities and mate with males from neighboring communities.&lt;ref name=Goodall1986/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gagneux1999&gt;Gagneux P, Boesch C, Woodruff DS. (1999) &quot;Female reproductive strategies, paternity and community structure in wild West African chimpanzees&quot;. ''Anim Beh'' 57: 19-32.&lt;/ref&gt; When committing to a specific community, females have limited choice in mates and the dominance hierarchy of males often dictates which males an estrous female will mate with. Thus alternative mating strategies give females more mating opportunities without losing the support of the males in their community.&lt;ref name=Gagneux1999/&gt; [[Infanticide (zoology)| Infanticide]] has been recording in chimp communities in Gombe, Mahale, and [[Kibale National Park|Kibale]] National Parks. Male chimps practice infanticide on unrelated young to shorten the interbirth intervals in the females. There are also accounts of infanticide by females. There are questions whether cases of female infanticide are related to the dominance hierarchy in females or are simply isolated pathological behaviors.&lt;ref name=Goodall1986/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pusey1997&gt;Pusey AE, Williams J, Goodall J. (1997) &quot;The influence of dominance rank on the reproductive success of female chimpanzees&quot;. ''Science'' 277(5327): 828-831.&lt;/ref&gt;

Care for the young is provided mostly by their mothers. The survival and emotional health of the young is dependent on maternal care.&lt;ref name=Goodall1986/&gt; Mothers provide their young with food, warmth, protection and teach then certain skills. In addition, a chimp’s future rank may be dependent on their mother’s status.&lt;ref name=Goodall1986/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boesch2000/&gt; For their first 30 days, infants are in constant physical contact with their mothers, clinging to their bellies. Newborn chimps are helpless and have a grasping reflex that is not strong enough to support them for more than a few second. Infants are unable to support their own weight for their first two month and need their mothers support.&lt;ref name=Bard1995&gt;Bard KA. (1995) &quot;Parenting in primates&quot;. In: Bornstein MH, editor. ''Handbook of parenting. Volume 2, Biology and ecology of parenting''. Mahwah (NJ): L Erlbaum Associates; p 27-58.&lt;/ref&gt; When by reach 5-6 months, infants ride on their mothers’ backs. They remind in continual contact for the rest of their first year. When they reach two years of age, they begin to move and sit independently within five meters of their mothers.&lt;ref name=Bard1995/&gt; By three years, infants will move more than five meters away from their mothers. By 4-6 years, chimps are weaned and infancy ends.&lt;ref name=Bard1995/&gt; The juvenile period for chimps lasts from their sixth to ninth year. Juveniles remain close to their mothers but they also have more interactions with other members of their community. Adolescent females move between groups and are supported by their mothers in agonistic encounters. Adolescent males spend time with adult males in social activities like hunting parties and boundary patrols.&lt;ref name=Bard1995/&gt;

===Communication===
Chimpanzees use a variety of facial expressions, postures and sounds to communicate with each other.&lt;ref name=Goodall1986/&gt; Chimps have expressive faces which are important in close-up communications. When in a frightening situation, a chimp will display a &quot;full closed grin&quot; which evokes an instant fear response in others. Other facial expression include the &quot;lip flip,&quot; &quot;pout,&quot; &quot;sneer,&quot; and &quot;compressed-lips face&quot;.&lt;ref name=Goodall1986/&gt; To show submission, a chimp will crunch, bob and extend a hand. To show aggression, a chimp will make itself appear larger by swaggering bipedally, hunching over and waving the arms.&lt;ref name=Goodall1986/&gt; In certain contexts, such as traveling, finding large food sources, displaying and encounter another community, chimps will beat their hands and feet against the trunks of large tree, an act known as &quot;drumming&quot;.&lt;ref name=Crockford2005&gt;Crockford C, Boesch C. (2005) &quot;Call combinations in wild chimpanzees&quot;. ''Behaviour'' 142(4): 397-421.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vocalizations are also important in chimp communication. The most common and important call in adult is the &quot;pant-hoot&quot;. These calls are meant to display excitement, sociability feelings and enjoyment of food.&lt;ref name=Goodall1986/&gt; Pant-hoots are made of four part, staring with soft &quot;hoos&quot; that increase in volume and build up to the climax of that call which is made up of of screams and sometimes barks and the scream die down to soft &quot;hoos&quot; again as the call ends.&lt;ref name=Crockford2005/&gt; Submissive individuals will direct &quot;pant-grunts&quot; towards their superiors.&lt;ref name=Goodall1986/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pusey1997/&gt; Chimps use distance calls to draw attention to danger, food sources or other community members.&lt;ref name=Goodall1986/&gt; &quot;Barks&quot; may be modified to &quot;short barks&quot; when hunting and &quot;tonal barks&quot; when sighting large snakes.&lt;ref name=Crockford2005/&gt;

===Link with Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1===
[[Image:South Djoum Chimp.jpg|thumb|right|250px|This Cameroonian chimpanzee was brought to a rescue centre after its mother was killed by poachers.]]
Two types of [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV) infect humans: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the more virulent and easily transmitted, and is the source of the majority of HIV infections throughout the world; HIV-2 is largely confined to west Africa.&lt;ref name=Reeves&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reeves JD, Doms RW |title=Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 |journal=J. Gen. Virol. |volume=83 |issue=Pt 6 |pages=1253–65 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12029140 |doi= 10.1099/vir.0.18253-0|url=http://vir.sgmjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12029140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both types originated in west and central Africa, jumping from primates to humans. HIV-1 has evolved from a [[Simian Immunodeficiency Virus]] (SIVcpz) found in the common chimpanzee subspecies, ''Pan troglodytes troglodytes'', native to southern [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref name=Keele&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keele BF, Van Heuverswyn F, Li Y, ''et al.'' |title=Chimpanzee reservoirs of pandemic and nonpandemic HIV-1 |journal=Science (journal) |volume=313 |issue=5786 |pages=523–6 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16728595 |doi=10.1126/science.1126531 |url= |pmc=2442710}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gao&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gao F, Bailes E, Robertson DL, ''et al.'' |title=Origin of HIV-1 in the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes troglodytes |journal=Nature |volume=397 |issue=6718 |pages=436–41 |year=1999 |month=February |pmid=9989410 |doi=10.1038/17130 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has the greatest genetic diversity of HIV-1 so far discovered, suggesting that the virus has been there longer than anywhere else. HIV-2 crossed species from a different strain of SIV, found in the [[Sooty Mangabey]], monkeys in [[Guinea-Bissau]].&lt;ref name=Reeves/&gt;

===Status and conservation===
Chimpanzees are protected by law in most countries and they are present in numerous national parks throughout their range, although many populations occur outside protected areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; 

The biggest threats to the common chimpanzee are habitat destruction, poaching and disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; Deforestation across West and Central Africa has severely reduced chimpanzee habitats. It is estimated that more than 80% of the region’s original forest cover has been lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; Increased accessibility to remote areas through road building poses a risk to chimpanzee populations through habitat degradation and fragmentation and potential increased poaching in areas previously not seriously impacted by such anthropogeniic pressures.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; In western Central Africa deforestation rates are low but selective logging is, or will be, carried out in the majority of forests outside national parks.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;

Chimpanzee are a common target for poachers. Chimpanzees currently constitute 1% to 3% of bushmeat sold in urban markets in [[Côte d’Ivoire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; They are also taken in pet trades.  Although the pet trade is illegal in all range countries that are signatories to CITES, it persists illegally across Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;     In some localities, chimpanzees are hunted traditionally for medicinal purposes&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;    Some range countries, such as Guinea, still officially permit the capture of chimpanzees for scientific research.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;    People will kill chimpanzees intentionally to protect their crops using snares.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;

Infectious diseases are a main cause of death for chimpanzees. Because chimpanzees and humans are so similar, chimpanzees succumb to many diseases that afflict humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;    The frequency of encounters between chimpanzees and humans and/or human waste is increasing as human populations expand, leading to higher risks of disease transmission between humans and chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;

'''Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease''' ('''CMT'''), known also as '''Morbus Charcot-Marie-Tooth''', '''Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy''', '''hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy''' ('''HMSN'''), '''hereditary sensorimotor neuropathy''' ('''HSMN'''), or '''peroneal muscular atrophy''', is an inherited disorder of [[nerve]]s ([[neuropathy]]) that takes different forms. It is characterized by loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation, predominantly in the feet and legs but also in the hands and arms in the advanced stages of disease. Currently incurable, this disease is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders, with 36 in 100,000 affected.&lt;ref name=Krajewski&gt;{{cite journal |author=Krajewski KM, Lewis RA, Fuerst DR, ''et al.'' |title=Neurological dysfunction and axonal degeneration in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A |journal=Brain |volume=123 ( Pt 7) |issue= |pages=1516–27 |year=2000 |pmid=10869062 |doi= 10.1093/brain/123.7.1516|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/123/7/1516#SEC4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular causes==

Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease is caused by mutations that cause defects in neuronal proteins. Nerve signals are conducted by an [[axon]] with a [[myelin]] sheath wrapped around it. Most mutations in CMT affect the myelin sheath. Some affect the axon. 

The most common cause of CMT (70-80% of the cases) is the duplication of a large region in chromosome 17p12 that includes the gene [[PMP22]]. Some mutations affect the gene [[MFN2]], which codes for a mitochondrial protein. Cells contain separate sets of genes in their [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and in their [[mitochondria]]. In nerve cells, the mitochondria travel down the long axons. In some forms of CMT, mutated [[MFN2]] causes the mitochondria to form large clusters, or clots, which are unable to travel down the axon towards the [[synapses]]. This prevents the synapses from functioning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baloh&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baloh RH, Schmidt RE, Pestronk A, Milbrandt J |title=Altered axonal mitochondrial transport in the pathogenesis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease from mitofusin 2 mutations |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=422–30 |year=2007 |pmid=17215403 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4798-06.2007 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/2/422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMT is divided into the primary demyelinating neuropathies (CMT1, CMT3, and CMT4) and the primary axonal neuropathies (CMT2), with frequent overlap. Another cell involved in CMT is the [[Schwann cell]], which creates the myelin sheath, by wrapping its plasma membrane around the axon in a structure that is sometimes compared to a [[Swiss roll]].&lt;ref name=Berger&gt;{{cite journal |author=Berger P, Young P, Suter U |title=Molecular cell biology of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease |journal=Neurogenetics |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |year=2002 |pmid=12030326 |doi= 10.1007/s10048-002-0130-z|url=http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10048/bibs/2004001/20040001.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurons, Schwann cells, and [[fibroblast]]s work together to create a working nerve. Schwann cells and neurons exchange molecular signals that regulate survival and differentiation. These signals are disrupted in CMT.&lt;ref name=Berger/&gt;

Demyelinating Schwann cells causes abnormal axon structure and function. They may cause axon degeneration. Or they may simply cause axons to malfunction.&lt;ref name=Krajewski/&gt;

The myelin sheath allows nerve cells to conduct signals faster. When the myelin sheath is damaged, nerve signals are slower, and this can be measured by a common neurological test, [[electromyography]]. 

When the axon is damaged, on the other hand, this results in a reduced compound muscle [[action potential]] (CMAP).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/jns/2008/00000013/00000003/art00008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
Symptoms  of CMT usually begin in late childhood or early adulthood. Some people don't experience symptoms until their early thirties or forties. Usually, the initial symptom is [[foot drop]] early in the course of the disease. This can also cause claw toe, where the toes are always curled. Wasting of muscle tissue of the lower parts of the legs may give rise to &quot;stork leg&quot; or &quot;inverted bottle&quot; appearance. Weakness in the hands and forearms occurs in many people later in life as the disease progresses. 

Symptoms and progression of the disease can vary. Breathing can be affected in some; so can hearing, vision, and the neck and shoulder muscles. [[Scoliosis]] is common. [[Acetabulum|Hip sockets]] can be malformed. Gastrointestinal problems can be part of CMT, as can chewing, swallowing, and speaking (as [[vocal cords]] atrophy). A [[tremor]] can develop as muscles waste. [[Pregnancy]] has been known to exacerbate CMT, as well as extreme emotional stress.

[[Neuropathic pain]] is often a symptom of CMT, though, like other symptoms of CMT, its presence and severity varies from case to case. For some people, pain can be significant to severe and interfere with daily life activities. However, pain is not experienced by all people with CMT. When pain is present as a symptom of CMT, it is comparable to that seen in other [[peripheral neuropathies]], as well as [[Postherpetic neuralgia]] and [[Complex regional pain syndrome]], among other diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carter GT, Jensen MP, Galer BS, Kraft GH, Crabtree LD, Beardsley RM, Abresch RT, Bird TD |title=Neuropathic pain in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. |journal=Arch Phys Med Rehabil |year=1998 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9862301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
CMT can be diagnosed through symptoms, through measurement of the speed of nerve impulses ([[electromyography]]), through [[biopsy]] of the nerve, and through DNA testing. DNA testing can give a definitive diagnosis, but not all the [[genetic marker]]s for CMT are known.CMT is first noticed when someone develops lower leg weakness and foot deformities such as foot drop, hammertoes and high arches. But signs alone do not lead to diagnosis.  Patients must be referred to a neurologist or a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician (physiatrist). To see signs of muscle weakness the neurologist will ask patients to walk on their heels or to move part of their leg against an opposing force.  In order to identify sensory loss the neurologist will test for deep tendon reflexes, such as the knee jerk, which are reduced or absent in CMT. The doctor will also ask about family history because CMT is hereditary.  The lack of family history does not rule out CMT, but it will allow the doctor to rule out other causes of neuropathy such as diabetes or exposure to certain chemicals or drugs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charcot-marie-tooth.org/about_cmt/diagnosis.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, CMT was one of the first diseases where the genetic cause of a particular patient's disease was precisely determined by sequencing the whole genome of an affected individual.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/11/health/research/11gene.html?hp |title =Disease Cause Is Pinpointed With Genome |author=NICHOLAS WADE |publisher=New York Times |date=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}Free full text&lt;/ref&gt; Two mutations were identified in a gene, SH3TC2, known to cause CMT.  Researchers then compared the affected patient's genome to the genomes of the patient's mother, father, and seven siblings with and without the disease. The mother and father each had one normal and one mutant copy of this gene, and had mild or no symptoms. The offspring that inherited two mutant genes presented fully with the disease. Sequencing the initial patient's whole genome cost $50,000, but researchers estimated that it would soon cost $5,000 and become common.

==Types==

As of early 2010, mutations in 39 genes have been identified as causes of CMT.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT2010&quot;/&gt; CMT can be categorized first into major clinical categories, and then into subtypes according to those mutations. Type 1 primarily affects the myelin sheath, and is either dominant, recessive or X-linked. Type 2 primarily affects the axon, and is either dominant or recessive. Other types are mixed.&lt;ref&gt;NEJM Lupski&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| CMT Type 1 (CMT1)
| [[Autosomal dominant]]
| Type 1 affects approximately one-third of CMT patients and is the most common type of CMT.  The subtypes share clinical symptoms.  
| Causes demyelination, which can be detected by measuring nerve conduction velocities. (anatomic changes directly affect the myelin sheath, with secondary axonal changes. In areas of focal demyelination, impulse conduction is slowed. The prolongation slows conduction velocity along the nerve segment.)
|-
| CMT Type 2 (CMT2)
| [[Autosomal dominant]]&lt;BR&gt;(except CMT2B1)
| Type 2 affects approximately 20-40% of CMT patients.  
| Main effect is on the axon.  The average [[nerve conduction velocity]] is slightly below normal, but generally above 38[[Metre per second|m/s]] The type-2 form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT2) tends to affect the lower extremities more than the upper extremities. CMT2 is often a clinically less severe disease than CMT1.
|-
| CMT Type 3 (CMT3)
| [[Autosomal recessive]] 
| Type 3 affects very few CMT patients.

| CMT X-Linked (CMTX)
| [[Dominant gene|X-linked dominant]]&lt;BR&gt;(only CMTX1)
| CMTX affects approximately 10-20% of CMT patients. 
| Approx 10% of X-linked CMT patients have some other form than CMTX.  However a study published in 1997 indicates that a connexin 32 gene mutation is associated with this form which may be more common than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Latour P, Fabreguette A, Ressot C, ''et al.'' |title=New mutations in the X-linked form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease |journal=Eur.

==Management and treatment==
Although there is no current standard treatment, the use of [[ascorbic acid]] has been proposed, and has shown some benefit in animal models.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15034573&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Passage E, Norreel JC, Noack-Fraissignes P, ''et al.'' |title=Ascorbic acid treatment corrects the phenotype of a mouse model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease |journal=Nat.

This discovery is expected to open the avenue to new treatments in the coming years. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Nerves Under Control: Potential Treatment for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease,&quot; Science Daily, May 18, 2010. [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100518112649.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most important activity for patients with CMT is to maintain what movement, muscle strength and flexibility they have. Therefore, physical therapy and moderate activity are recommended but overexertion should be avoided.  A physical therapist should be involved in designing a exercise program that fits a patient’s personal strengths and flexibility. Bracing can also be used to correct problems caused by CMT. Gait abnormalities can be corrected by the use of either articulated (hinged) or unarticulated, braces called AFOs (ankle-foot orthoses). These braces help control foot drop and ankle instability and often provide a better sense of balance for patients.  Appropriate footwear is also very important for people with CMT, but they often have difficulty finding well-fitting shoes because of their high arched feet and hammer toes. Due to the lack of good sensory reception in the feet, CMT patients may also need to see a podiatrist for help in trimming nails or removing calluses that develop on the pads of the feet. A final decision a patient can make is to have surgery. Using a podiatrist or an orthopedic surgeon, patients can choose to stabilize their feet or correct progressive problems. These procedures include straightening and pinning the toes, lowering the arch, and sometimes, fusing the ankle joint to provide stability.{ site website:http://www.charcot-marie-tooth.org/about_cmt/treatment.php } 

The Charcot-Marie-Tooth Association classifies the [[chemotherapy]] drug [[vincristine]] as a &quot;definite high risk&quot; and states that &quot;vincristine has been proven hazardous and should be avoided by all CMT patients, including those with no symptoms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charcot-marie-tooth.org/med_alert.php CMT Association: Medical Alert]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also several corrective surgical procedures that can be done to improve physical condition.

Genetic testing is available for many of the different types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth and may help guide treatment.

== History ==

The disease is named for those who classically described it: [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] (1825–1893), his pupil [[Pierre Marie]] (1853–1940)  (''&quot;Sur une forme particulière d'atrophie musculaire progressive, souvent familiale débutant par les pieds et les jambes et atteignant plus tard les mains&quot;'', Revue médicale, Paris, 1886; 6: 97-138.), and [[Howard Henry Tooth]] (1856–1925) (&quot;The peroneal type of progressive muscular atrophy&quot;, dissertation, London, 1886.)

[[File:CPM3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Central pontine myelinolysis, MRI FLAIR]]
'''Central pontine myelinolysis''' is a neurologic disease caused by severe damage of the [[myelin sheath]] of [[neuron|nerve cells]] in the [[brainstem]], more precisely in the area termed the ''[[pons]]''. It is characterized by acute paralysis,  [[dysphagia]] (difficilty swallowing), and [[dysarthria]] (difficulty speaking), and other neurological symptoms.

It can also occur outside the pons.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid3322623&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gocht A, Colmant HJ |title=Central pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis: a report of 58 cases |journal=Clin. Neuropathol. |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=262–70 |year=1987 |pmid=3322623 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;osmotic demyelinization syndrome&quot; is similar to &quot;central pontine myelinolysis&quot;, but also includes areas outside the pons.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11803185&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lampl C, Yazdi K |title=Central pontine myelinolysis |journal=Eur. Neurol. |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=3–10 |year=2002 |pmid=11803185 |doi= 10.1159/000047939|url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=ene47003|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKw9BaG1 |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central pontine myelinolysis is a complication of treatment of patients with profound, life-threatening [[hyponatremia]] (low sodium). It occurs as a consequence of a rapid rise in serum tonicity following treatment in individuals with chronic, severe hyponatraemia who have made intracellular adaptations to the prevailing hypotonicity. Hyponatremia should be corrected at a rate of no more than 8-10 mmol/L of sodium per day to prevent central pontine myelinosis.

==Pathology==
The currently accepted theory states that the brain cells adjust their osmolarities by changing levels of certain osmolytes like [[Inositol]], [[Betaine]], [[Glutamine]] etc. In hyponatremia the levels of these osmolytes fall, preventing entry of free-water into cells. The reverse is true for hypernatremia. So rapid correction of Sodium in hyponatremia would cause the extra cellular fluid to be relatively hypertonic. Free-water would then move out of the cells. This leads to a central pontine myelinolysis, manifesting as the paralysis.

The demyelination of the [[axon]]s (nerve fibers in the brain) damages them.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12566274&quot;&gt;{{cite journal
|author=Medana IM, Esiri MM
|title=Axonal damage: a key predictor of outcome in human CNS diseases
|journal=Brain
|volume=126
|issue=Pt 3
|pages=515–30
|year=2003
|month=March
|pmid=12566274
|doi=10.1093/brain/awg061
|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12566274
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] low plasma sodium, the brain's cells ([[neurons]] and [[glia]]) adapt by taking in a small amount of water; the net effect is to move water out of the [[interstitium]] and equilibrate (or nearly so) the intracellular and extracellular tonicities.  The chronic hyponatremia is thus compensated.

With correction of the hyponatremia with [[intravenous fluids]], the intra- and extra-cellular tonicities are again changed, this time in the opposite direction.  With the use of intravenous hypertonic saline, the correction can be too quick, not allowing enough time for the brain's cells to adjust to the new tonicity.  With a rise in extracellular tonicity, the cells compensate by losing a small amount of water.  This loss will continue until the intra- and extra-cellular tonicities are equal.  If hypertonic therapy continues or is too rapid, the extracellular tonicity will continue to drive water out of the brain's cells, leading to cellular dysfunction and the condition of central pontine myelinolysis.

Rapid correction of hypernatremia causes water to move into cells, leading to multiple cerebral hemorrhages, equally catastrophic as osmotic demyelination.

==Causes==
The most common cause is the rapid correction of low blood sodium levels ([[hyponatremia]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10544728&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bernsen HJ, Prick MJ |title=Improvement of central pontine myelinolysis as demonstrated by repeated magnetic resonance imaging in a patient without evidence of hyponatremia |journal=Acta Neurol Belg |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=189–93 |year=1999 |month=September |pmid=10544728 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed following [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18437020&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lim KH, Kim S, Lee YS, ''et al.'' |title=Central pontine myelinolysis in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a case report |journal=J.

It is frequently associated with [[alcoholism]]. When alcoholics are treated for [[hyponatremia]], an overly rapid rate of correction can lead to CPM.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10460448&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Menger H, Jörg J |title=Outcome of central pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis (n &amp;#61; 44) |journal=J. Neurol. |volume=246 |issue=8 |pages=700–5 |year=1999 |month=August |pmid=10460448 |doi= 10.1007/s004150050435|url=http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00415/bibs/9246008/92460700.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-alcoholic patients can be affected; these include:
* underlying severe liver disease
* liver transplant patients
* severe burns
* malnutrition
* anorexia
* severe electrolyte disorders
* AIDS

It can be associated with [[Hyperemesis gravidarum]].

==Diagnosis==
It can be difficult to identify using conventional imaging techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14970019&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ruzek KA, Campeau NG, Miller GM |title=Early diagnosis of central pontine myelinolysis with diffusion-weighted imaging |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=210–3 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14970019 |doi= |url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14970019|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKwClFyt |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imaging by [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] demonstrates an area of high signal return on T2 weighted images.

==Symptoms==
[[File:Extrapontine_myelinolysis_T2_01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|T2 weighted magnetic resonance scan image showing bilaterally symmetrical hyperintensities in Caudate nucleus (small, thin arrow), Putamen (long arrow), with sparing of Globus Pallidus (broad arrow), suggestive of Extrapontine myelinolysis.]]
Frequently observed symptoms in this disorder are acute para- or [[quadraparesis]], [[dysphagia]], [[dysarthria]], [[diplopia]], [[coma|loss of consciousness]], and other neurological symptoms associated with brainstem damage.  The patient may experience [[locked-in syndrome]] where cognitive function is intact, but all muscles are paralyzed with the exception of eye blinking. These result from a rapid myelinolysis of the [[corticobulbar]] and [[corticospinal]] tracts in the brainstem.

==Prevention and treatment==
To prevent CPM via the most common cause, overly rapid correction of hyponatremia, the hyponatremia should be corrected at a rate not in excess of 10mmol/L/24hr or 0.5 mEq/L/Hr; thus diligently avoiding hypernatremia. Details concerning the etiology and correction of electrolyte disorders are discussed extensively in general medicine texts.
Alcoholic patients should receive vitamin supplementation and a formal evaluation of their nutritional status. &lt;ref&gt;Kleinschmidt-DeMasters BK, Norenberg MD. Rapid correction of hyponatremia causes demyelination: relation to central pontine myelinolysis. ''Science.'' 1981;211(4486):1068-70. PMID 7466381&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laureno R. Experimental pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis. ''Trans Am Neurol Assoc.'' 1980;105:354-8. PMID 7348981&lt;/ref&gt;

Once demyelination has begun, there is no specific treatment.  Care is supportive, with the goal of preventing complications like [[aspiration pneumonia]] or [[deep vein thrombosis]].  Alcoholics are usually given vitamins to correct for other deficiencies.

Research has led to improved outcomes.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11148672&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

==Point defects==
Point defects are defects that occur only at or around a single lattice point. They are not extended in space in any dimension. Strict limits for how small a point defect is, are generally not defined explicitly,  but typically these defects involve at most a few extra or missing atoms. Larger defects in an ordered structure are usually considered [[dislocation]] loops. For historical reasons, many point defects, especially in ionic crystals, are called ''centers'': for example a vacancy in many ionic solids is called a luminescence center, a color center, or [[F-center]]. These dislocations permit ionic transport through crystals leading to electrochemical reactions. These are frequently specified using [[Kröger–Vink Notation]].

*[[Vacancy defect]]s are lattice sites which would be occupied in a perfect crystal, but are vacant. If a neighboring atom moves to occupy the vacant site, the vacancy moves in the opposite direction to the site which used to be occupied by the moving atom. The stability of the surrounding crystal structure guarantees that the neighboring atoms will not simply collapse around the vacancy. In some materials, neighboring atoms actually move away from a vacancy, because they experience attraction from atoms in the surroundings. A vacancy (or pair of vacancies in an ionic solid) is sometimes called a [[Schottky defect]].

*[[Interstitial defect]]s are atoms that occupy a site in the crystal structure at which there is usually not an atom. They are generally high energy configurations. Small atoms in some crystals can occupy interstices without high energy, such as [[hydrogen]] in [[palladium]].

[[Image:defecttypes.png|right|thumb|Schematic illustration of some simple point defect types in a monatomic solid]]

*A nearby pair of a vacancy and an interstitial is often called a [[Frenkel defect]] or Frenkel pair. This is caused when an ion moves into an interstitial site and creates a vacancy.

*Impurities occur because materials are never 100% pure. In the case of an impurity, the atom is often incorporated at a regular atomic site in the crystal structure.  This is neither a vacant site nor is the atom on an interstitial site and it is called a ''substitutional'' defect. The atom is not supposed to be anywhere in the crystal, and is thus an impurity. There are two different types of substitutional defects. Isovalent substitution and aliovalent substitution. Isovalent substitution is where the ion that is substituting the original ion is of the same oxidation state as the ion it is replacing. Aliovalent substitution is where the ion that is substituting the original ion is of a different oxidation state as the ion it is replacing. Aliovalent substitutions change the overall charge within the ionic compound, but the ionic compound must be neutral. Therefore a charge compensation mechanism is required. Hence either one of the metals is partially or fully oxidised or reduced, or ion vacancies are created.

*'''Antisite defects'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10058001|year=1995|last1=Mattila|first1=T|last2=Nieminen|first2=RM|title=Direct Antisite Formation in Electron Irradiation of GaAs.|volume=74|issue=14|pages=2721–2724|journal=Physical review letters|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.74.2721|bibcode=1995PhRvL..74.2721M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.54.8527|title=Point defects and their reactions in electron-irradiated GaAs investigated by optical absorption spectroscopy|year=1996|last1=Hausmann|first1=H.|last2=Pillukat|first2=A.|last3=Ehrhart|first3=P.|journal=Physical Review B|volume=54|pages=8527|bibcode = 1996PhRvB..54.8527H }}&lt;/ref&gt; occur in an ordered alloy or compound, and is when atoms interchange position. For example, some alloys have a regular structure in which every other atom is a different species; for illustration assume that type A atoms sit on the corners of a cubic lattice, and type B atoms sit in the center of the cubes. If one cube has an A atom at its center, the atom is on a site usually occupied by an atom, but it is not the correct type. This is neither a vacancy nor an interstitial, nor an impurity.

*Topological defects are regions in a crystal where the normal chemical bonding environment is topologically different from the surroundings. For instance, in a perfect sheet of graphite ([[graphene]]) all atoms are in rings containing six atoms. If the sheet contains regions where the number of atoms in a ring is different from six, while the total number of atoms remains the same, a topological defect has formed. An example is the [[Stone Wales defect]] in nanotubes, which consists of two adjacent 5-membered and two 7-membered atom rings.

[[Image:compounddefects.png|right|thumb|Schematic illustration of defects in a compound solid, using GaAs as an example.]]

*Also [[amorphous]] solids may contain defects. These are naturally somewhat hard to define, but sometimes their nature can be quite easily understood. For instance, in ideally bonded amorphous [[silica]] all Si atoms have 4 bonds to O atoms and all O atoms have 2 bonds to Si atom. Thus e.g. an O atom with only one Si bond (a [[dangling bond]]) can be considered a defect in silica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00107510601088156|title=Luminescence of ion-irradiated α-quartz|year=2006|last1=Lieb|first1=Klaus-Peter|last2=Keinonen|first2=Juhani|journal=Contemporary Physics|volume=47|pages=305|bibcode = 2006ConPh..47..305L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Complexes can form between different kinds of point defects. For example, if a vacancy encounters an impurity, the two may bind together if the impurity is too large for the lattice. Interstitials can form 'split interstitial' or 'dumbbell' structures where two atoms effectively share an atomic site, resulting in neither atom actually occupying the site.

==Line defects==
Line defects can be described by gauge theories.

*[[Dislocation]]s are linear defects around which some of the atoms of the crystal lattice are misaligned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirth-Lothe&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=J. P. Hirth and J. Lothe|title=Theory of dislocations|publisher=Krieger Pub Co|edition=2|year=1992|isbn=0894646176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are two basic types of dislocations, the ''edge'' dislocation and the ''screw'' dislocation. &quot;Mixed&quot; dislocations, combining aspects of both types, are also common.

[[Image:Dislocation edge d2.svg|thumb|An ''edge dislocation'' is shown. The dislocation line is presented in blue, the Burgers vector b in black.]]

Edge dislocations are caused by the termination of a plane of atoms in the middle of a crystal. In such a case, the adjacent planes are not straight, but instead bend around the edge of the terminating plane so that the crystal structure is perfectly ordered on either side. The analogy with a stack of paper is apt: if a half a piece of paper is inserted in a stack of paper, the defect in the stack is only noticeable at the edge of the half sheet.

The screw dislocation is more difficult to visualise, but basically comprises a structure in which a helical path is traced around the linear defect (dislocation line) by the atomic planes of atoms in the crystal lattice.

The presence of dislocation results in lattice strain (distortion). The direction and magnitude of such distortion is expressed in terms of a [[Burgers vector]] (b). For an edge type, b is perpendicular to the dislocation line, whereas in the cases of the screw type it is parallel. In metallic materials, b is aligned with close-packed crytallographic directions and its magnitude is equivalent to one interatomic spacing.

Dislocations can move if the atoms from one of the surrounding planes break their bonds and rebond with the atoms at the terminating edge.

It is the presence of dislocations and their ability to readily move (and interact) under the influence of stresses induced by external loads that leads to the characteristic [[malleability]] of metallic materials.

Dislocations can be observed using [[transmission electron microscopy]], [[field ion microscopy]] and [[atom probe]] techniques.
[[DLTS|Deep level transient spectroscopy]] has been used for studying the electrical activity of dislocations in semiconductors, mainly [[silicon]].

*[[Disclination]]s are line defects corresponding to &quot;adding&quot; or &quot;subtracting&quot; an angle around a line. Basically, this means that if you track the crystal orientation around the line defect, you get a rotation. Usually they play a role only in liquid crystals.

==Planar defects==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Semiconductor]] --&gt;
*Grain boundaries occur where the crystallographic direction of the lattice abruptly changes. This usually occurs when two crystals begin growing separately and then meet.

*Anti-phase boundaries occur in ordered alloys: in this case, the crystallographic direction remains the same, but each side of the boundary has an opposite phase: For example if the ordering is usually ABABABAB, an anti phase boundary takes the form of ABABBABA.

*Stacking faults&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirth-Lothe&quot; /&gt; occur in a number of crystal structures, but the common example is in [[Close-packing|close-packed]] structures. [[Face-centered cubic]] (fcc) structures differ from [[hexagonal close packed]] (hcp) structures only in stacking order: both structures have close packed atomic planes with sixfold symmetry—the atoms form equilateral triangles. When stacking one of these layers on top of another, the atoms are not directly on top of one another—the first two layers are identical for hcp and fcc, and labelled AB. If the third layer is placed so that its atoms are directly above those of the first layer, the stacking will be ABA—this is the hcp structure, and it continues ABABABAB. However there is another location for the third layer, such that its atoms are not above the first layer. Instead, the fourth layer is placed so that its atoms are directly above the first layer. This produces the stacking ABCABCABC, and is actually a cubic arrangement of the atoms. A stacking fault is a one or two layer interruption in the stacking sequence, for example if the sequence ABCABABCAB were found in an fcc structure.

==Bulk defects==
*Voids are small regions where there are no atoms, and can be thought of as clusters of vacancies.
*Impurities can cluster together to form small regions of a different phase. These are often called [[precipitate]]s.

==Mathematical classification methods==
A successful mathematical classification method for physical lattice defects, which works not only with the theory of dislocations and other defects in crystals but also, e.g., for [[disclination]]s in liquid crystals and for excitations in superfluid &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He, is the topological [[homotopy]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.51.591|title=The topological theory of defects in ordered media|year=1979|last1=Mermin|first1=N.|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=51|pages=591|bibcode=1979RvMP...51..591M}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer simulation methods==
Simulating jamming of hard spheres of different sizes
and/or in containers with non-commeasurable sizes
using the [[Lubachevsky-Stillinger algorithm]]
can be an effective techniques for demonstrating
some types of crystallographic defects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[computer science]], a [[context-free grammar]] is said to be in '''Chomsky normal form''' if all of its production rules are of the form:
: &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow BC&lt;/math&gt; or
: &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow \alpha&lt;/math&gt; or
: &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are nonterminal symbols, α is a [[terminal symbol]] (a symbol that represents a constant value), &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the start symbol, and ε is the [[empty string]].  Also, neither &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; may be the start symbol.

Every grammar in Chomsky normal form is [[context-free grammar|context-free]], and conversely, every context-free grammar can be transformed into an equivalent one which is in Chomsky normal form. Several algorithms for performing such a transformation are known. Transformations are described in most textbooks on automata theory, such as (Hopcroft and Ullman, 1979). 
As pointed out by Lange and Leiß, the drawback of these transformations is that they can lead to an undesirable bloat in grammar size. Using &lt;math&gt;|G|&lt;/math&gt; to denote the size of the original grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, the size blow-up in the worst case may range from &lt;math&gt;|G|^2&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;2^{2 |G|}&lt;/math&gt;, depending on the transformation algorithm used (Lange and Leiß, 2009).   

==Alternative definition==
Another way to define Chomsky normal form (e.g., Hopcroft and Ullman 1979, and Hopcroft et al. 2006) is:

A [[formal grammar]] is in '''Chomsky reduced form''' if all of its production rules are of the form:
: &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow\, BC&lt;/math&gt; or
: &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow\, \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are nonterminal symbols, and α is a [[terminal symbol]].  When using this definition, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; may be the start symbol.

==Converting a grammar to Chomsky Normal Form==
# Introduce &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
#: Introduce a new start variable, &lt;math&gt;S_0 &lt;/math&gt; and a new rule &lt;math&gt;S_0 \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S &lt;/math&gt; is the previous start variable.&lt;/dd&gt;
# Eliminate all ''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; rules''&lt;/dt&gt;
#: &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; rules are rules of the form &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;A \not= S_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A \in V&lt;/math&gt; where V is the [[Context-free_grammar|CFG]]'s variable alphabet.
#: Remove every rule with &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; on its right hand side (RHS).  For each rule with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in its RHS, add a set of new rules consisting of the different possible combinations of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; replaced or not replaced with &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  If a rule has &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as a singleton on its RHS, add a new rule &lt;math&gt;R = A \rightarrow \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; '''unless''' &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; has already been removed through this process.  For example, examine the following grammar G:
#:: &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow AbA | B&lt;/math&gt;
#:: &lt;math&gt;B \rightarrow b | c&lt;/math&gt;
#:: &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
#:G has one epsilon rule.  When the &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is removed, we get the following:
#:: &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow AbA | Ab | bA | b | B&lt;/math&gt;
#:: &lt;math&gt;B \rightarrow b | c&lt;/math&gt;
#:Notice that we have to account for all possibilities of &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and so we actually end up adding 3 rules.
# Eliminate all ''unit rules''
#:&lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B \ni A,B \in V&lt;/math&gt;
#:After all the &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; rules have been removed, you can begin removing unit rules, or rules whose RHS contains one variable and no terminals (which is inconsistent with CNF.)
#:: To remove &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;
#:: &lt;math&gt;\forall B \rightarrow U&lt;/math&gt; add rule &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow U&lt;/math&gt; unless this is a unit rule which has already been removed.&lt;/dd&gt;
# Clean up remaining rules that are not in Chomsky normal form.&lt;/dt&gt;
#: Replace &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow u_1,u_2, ... u_k, k \ge 3, u_1 \in V \cup \Sigma&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow u_1 A_1 , A_1 \rightarrow u_2 A_2 , ... , A_{k-2} \rightarrow u_{k-1} u_k&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; are new variables.
#: If &lt;math&gt;u_i \in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, replace &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; in above rules with some new variable &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; and add rule &lt;math&gt;v_i \rightarrow u_i&lt;/math&gt;.

On 3 May 2010, [[Indonesia]] stated it had initiated the CTBT ratification process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/press-releases/2010/media-advisory-support-for-comprehensivenuclear-test-ban-treaty-ctbt-continuesto-grow-with-recognition-by-two-more-countries/?Fsize=osxitxloijkqrzc&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obligations==
(Article I):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctbto.org/fileadmin/content/treaty/treaty_text.pdf COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR-TEST-BAN TREATY], CTBTO&lt;/ref&gt;
#Each State Party undertakes not to carry out any [[nuclear weapon]] test explosion or any other nuclear explosion, and to prohibit and prevent any such nuclear explosion at any place under its jurisdiction or control.
#Each State Party undertakes, furthermore, to refrain from causing, encouraging, or in any way participating in the carrying out of any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion.

==History==
Arms control advocates had campaigned for the adoption of a treaty banning all nuclear explosions since the early 1950s, when public concern was aroused as a result of radioactive fall-out from atmospheric nuclear tests and the escalating arms race. Over 50 nuclear explosions were registered between 16 July 1945, when the first nuclear explosive test was conducted by the United States at [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]], and 31 December 1953. [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] of India voiced the heightened international concern in 1954, when he proposed the elimination of all nuclear test explosions worldwide. However, within the context of the [[Cold War]], skepticism about the capability to verify compliance with a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty posed a major obstacle to any agreement.

===Partial Test Ban Treaty, 1963===
Limited success was achieved with the signing of the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] in 1963, which banned nuclear tests in the atmosphere, underwater and in space. Neither France nor China signed the PTBT. However, the treaty was still ratified by the United States after a 80 to 19 vote in the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1963/University-of-Alabama/12295509434394-4/#title &quot;1963 Year In Review&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, 1968===
A major step towards [[nuclear proliferation|non-proliferation]] of nuclear weapons came with the signing of the [[Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) in 1968. Under the NPT, non-nuclear weapon states were prohibited from, inter alia, possessing, manufacturing or acquiring nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. All signatories, including nuclear weapon states, were committed to the goal of total [[nuclear disarmament]]. However, India, Pakistan and Israel have declined to ratify the NPT on grounds that such a treaty is fundamentally discriminatory as it places limitations on states that do not have nuclear weapons while making no efforts to curb weapons development by declared nuclear weapons states.

===Negotiations for the CTBT===
Given the political situation prevailing in the subsequent decades, little progress was made in nuclear disarmament until 1991. Parties to the PTBT held an amendment conference that year to discuss a proposal to convert the Treaty into an instrument banning all nuclear-weapon tests; with strong support from the UN General Assembly, negotiations for a comprehensive test-ban treaty began in 1993.

===Adoption of the CTBT, 1996===
Intensive efforts were made over the next three years to draft the Treaty text and its two annexes. However, the [[Conference on Disarmament]], in which negotiations were being held, did not succeed in reaching consensus on the adoption of the text. Under the direction of Prime Minister [[John Howard]] and Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]], [[Australia]] then sent the text to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in [[New York]], where it was submitted as a draft resolution.&lt;ref&gt;http://unbisnet.un.org:8080/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=X204697124L65.19785&amp;profile=bibga&amp;uri=full=3100001~!396802~!33&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=power&amp;menu=search&amp;source=~!horizon#focus&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 September 1996, the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) was adopted by a large majority, exceeding two-thirds of the General Assembly's Membership.&lt;ref name=&quot;un.org&quot;/&gt;

===US ratification of the CTBT===
The US has signed the CTBT, but not ratified it. There is ongoing debate whether or not the US should ratify the CTBT. 

The United States has stated that its ratification of the CTBT is conditional upon:

{{cquote|
:A: The conduct of a [[Stockpile stewardship|Science Based Stockpile Stewardship Program]] to ensure a high level of confidence in the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons in the active stockpile, including the conduct of a broad range of effective and continuing experimental programs.

:B: The maintenance of modern nuclear laboratory facilities and programs in theoretical and exploratory nuclear technology which will attract, retain, and ensure the continued application of our human scientific resources to those programs on which continued progress in nuclear technology depends.

:C:The maintenance of the basic capability to resume nuclear test activities prohibited by the CTBT should the United States cease to be bound to adhere to this treaty.

:D: Continuation of a comprehensive research and development program to improve our treaty monitoring capabilities and operations.

:E: The continuing development of a broad range of intelligence gathering and analytical capabilities and operations to ensure accurate and comprehensive information on worldwide nuclear arsenals, nuclear weapons development programs, and related nuclear programs.

:F: The understanding that if the President of the United States is informed by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy (DOE) -- advised by the Nuclear Weapons Council, the Directors of DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories and the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command -- that a high level of confidence in the safety or reliability of a nuclear weapon type which the two Secretaries consider to be critical to the U.S. nuclear deterrent could no longer be certified, the President, in consultation with Congress, would be prepared to withdraw from the CTBT under the standard &quot;supreme national interests&quot; clause in order to conduct whatever testing might be required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/nucweps%20test%20ban.htm#stockpile Nuclear Weapons: Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Proponents of ratification claim that it would :

# Establish an international norm that would push other nuclear-capable countries like North Korea, Pakistan, and India to sign.
# Constrain worldwide nuclear proliferation by vastly limiting a country's ability to make nuclear advancements that only testing can ensure.
# Not compromise US national security because the [[Stockpile stewardship|Science Based Stockpile Stewardship Program]] serves as a means for maintaining current US nuclear capabilities without physical detonation.

Opponents of ratification claim that: 
# The treaty is unverifiable and that others nations could easily cheat.
# The ability to enforce the treaty was dubious
# The U.S. nuclear stockpile would not be as safe or reliable in the absence of testing.
# The benefit to nuclear nonproliferation was minimal.&lt;ref&gt;http://adamvn1.wordpress.com/tag/ctbt/ Kathleen Bailey and Robert Barker, “Why the United States Should Unsign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and Resume Nuclear Testing,” Comparative Strategy 22 (2003): 131&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 October 1999, the [[United States Senate]] rejected ratification of the CTBT. President [[Barack Obama]] stated during his 2008 election campaign that &quot;As president, I will reach out to the Senate to secure the ratification of the CTBT at the earliest practical date.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=nuclear-testing-is-an-acceptable-risk &quot;Nuclear Testing Is an Acceptable Risk for Arms Control&quot;], ''Scientific American'', March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monitoring of the CTBT===
[[geophysics|Geophysical]] and other technologies are used to monitor for compliance with the Treaty: [[seismology]], [[hydrophone|hydroacoustics]], [[infrasound]], and [[radionuclide]] monitoring. The technologies are used to monitor the underground, the waters and the atmosphere for any sign of a nuclear explosion. Statistical theories and methods are integral to CTBT monitoring
providing confidence in verification analysis. Once the Treaty enters into force, on site inspection will be provided for where concerns about compliance arise.

The [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission|Preparatory Commission]] for the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization]] (CTBTO), an international organization headquartered in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], was created to build the verification regime, including establishment and provisional operation of the network of monitoring stations, the creation of an international data centre, and development of the On Site Inspection capability.

The monitoring network consists of 337 facilities located all over the globe. As of September 2009, close to 250 facilities have been certified. The monitoring stations register data that is transmitted to the international data centre in Vienna for processing and analysis.. The data is sent to states that have signed the Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/press-releases/2009/us-nuclear-security-administrator-dagostinovisits-the-ctbto/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dance''' is an [[art form]] that generally refers to [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of the body, usually rhythmic and to music,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]], [[social]] [[Interpersonal relationship|interaction]] or presented in a [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting.

Dance may also be regarded as a form of [[nonverbal communication]] between humans, and is also performed by other [[animal]]s ([[bee dance]], [[Fixed action pattern|patterns of behaviour]] such as a mating dance). [[Gymnastics]], [[figure skating]] and [[synchronized swimming]] are [[sport]]s that incorporate dance, while [[martial arts]] [[Kata (martial arts)|kata]] are often compared to dances. [[Motion (physics)|Motion]] in ordinarily inanimate objects may also be described as dances (''the [[leaves]] danced in the [[wind]]'').

Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on [[Society|social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[aesthetic]], [[artistic]] and [[moral]] constraints and range from functional movement (such as [[folk dance]]) to [[virtuoso]] techniques such as [[ballet]]. Dance can be [[Participation dance|participatory]], [[social dance|social]] or [[Concert dance|performed]] for an [[audience]]. It can also be [[Ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], [[:Category:Competitive dance|competitive]] or [[Erotic dance|erotic]]. Dance movements may be without significance in themselves, such as in [[ballet]] or European [[folk dance]], or have a [[gesture|gestural]] [[vocabulary]]/[[symbol]]ic system as in many Asian dances. Dance can embody or express ideas, [[emotion]]s or tell a [[narrative|story]].

Dancing has evolved many styles. [[Breakdancing]] and [[Krumping]] are related to the [[hip hop culture]]. African dance is interpretative. Ballet, Ballroom, Waltz, and Tango are classical styles of dance while [[Square Dance|Square]] and the [[Electric Slide]] are forms of [[step dance]]s.

Every dance, no matter what style, has something in common.  It not only involves flexibility and body movement, but also physics.  If the proper physics is not taken into consideration, injuries may occur.

[[Choreography]] is the art of creating dances.  The person who creates (i.e., choreographs) a dance is known as the [[choreographer]].

==Origins and history of dance==
{{Main|History of dance}}
Dance does not leave behind clearly identifiable physical artifacts such as [[stone tool]]s, hunting implements or [[cave paintings]]. It is not possible to say when dance became part of human culture. Dance has certainly been an important part of [[ceremony]], [[ritual]]s, [[celebration (party)|celebration]]s and [[entertainment]] since before the birth of the earliest human [[civilization]]s. [[Archeology]] delivers traces of dance from [[prehistory|prehistoric times]] such as the 9,000 year old [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]] paintings in [[India]] and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tomb paintings depicting dancing figures from c. 3300 BC.

One of the earliest structured uses of dances may have been in the performance and in the telling of myths. It was also sometimes used to show feelings for one of the opposite gender. It is also linked to the origin of &quot;love making.&quot; Before the production of written languages, dance was one of the methods of passing these stories down from generation to generation.&lt;ref name=&quot;lecomte&quot;&gt;Nathalie Comte. &quot;Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World&quot;. Ed. Jonathan Dewald. Vol. 2. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2004. pp&amp;nbsp;94–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early use of dance may have been as a precursor to [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] [[altered state of consciousness|trance states]] in healing rituals. Dance is still used for this purpose by many cultures from the Brazilian [[rainforest]] to the [[Kalahari Desert]].&lt;ref name='guenther'&gt;Guenther, Mathias Georg. 'The San Trance Dance: Ritual and Revitalization Among the Farm Bushmen of the Ghanzi District, Republic of Botswana.' Journal, South West Africa Scientific Society, v30, 1975–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sri Lankan dances]] goes back to  the mythological times of [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] yingyang twins and &quot;[[yakkas]]&quot; (devils). According to a Sinhalese legend, [[Kandyan dance]]s originate, 250&amp;nbsp;years ago, from a magic ritual that broke the spell on a bewitched king. Many contemporary dance forms can be traced back to [[Historical dance|historical]], [[Traditional dance|traditional]], [[Ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], and [[List of dances sorted by ethnicity|ethnic]] dance.

==Dance classification and genres==
{{Main|List of basic dance topics|List of dances}}
Dance categories by number of interacting dancers are mainly [[solo dance]], [[partner dance]] and [[group dance]]. Dance is performed for various purposes like [[ceremonial dance]], [[erotic dance]], [[performance dance]], [[social dance]] etc.

===Dancing and music===
{{See also|Category:Music genres}}
Many early forms of music and dance were created and performed together. This paired development has continued through the ages with dance/music forms such as: [[jig]], [[waltz]], [[Tango music|tango]], [[disco]], [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]], [[electronica]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]]. Some [[musical genre]]s also have a parallel dance form such as [[baroque music]] and [[baroque dance]] whereas others developed separately: [[Classical music era|classical music]] and [[classical ballet]].

Although dance is often accompanied by [[music]], it can also be presented independently or provide its own accompaniment ([[tap dance]]). Dance presented with music may or may not be performed ''in time'' to the music depending on the style of dance. Dance performed without music is said to be ''danced to its own rhythm''{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}.

[[Ballroom dancing]] is an art although it may incorporates many fitness components using an artistic state of mind.

==Dance studies and techniques==
{{See also|Dance theory|Choreography|Dance moves}}

In the early 1920s, dance studies (dance [[practice (learning method)|practice]], [[critical theory]], [[Musical analysis]] and [[history]]) began to be considered an [[academic discipline]]. Today these studies are an integral part of many [[universities]]' [[The Arts|arts]] and [[humanities]] programs. By the late 20th century the recognition of practical [[knowledge]] as equal to academic knowledge lead to the emergence of ''[[practice research]]'' and ''practice as research''. A large range of dance courses are available including:
* Professional practice: performance and technical skills
* Practice research: choreography and performance
* [[Ethnochoreology]], encompassing the dance-related aspects of [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[gender studies]], [[area studies]], [[postcolonial theory]], [[ethnography]], etc.
* [[Dance therapy]] or dance-movement therapy.
* Dance and technology: [[new media]] and performance [[technologies]].
* [[Laban Movement Analysis]] and somatic studies

[[Academic degree]]s are available from [[Bachelor of Arts|BA (Hons)]] to [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] and other [[postdoctoral]] fellowships, with some dance [[scholar]]s taking up their studies as ''mature students'' after a [[professional]] dance career.

==Dance competitions==
A '''dance competition''' is an organized event in which contestants perform dances before a judge or judges for awards and, in some cases, monetary prizes. There are several major types of dance competitions, distinguished primarily by the style or styles of dances performed. Major types of dance competitions include:
*'''[[Competitive dance]]''', in which a variety of theater dance styles—such as [[acro dance|acro]], [[ballet]], [[jazz dance|jazz]], [[hip-hop]], [[lyrical dance|lyrical]], and [[tap dance|tap]]—are permitted.
*'''Open''' competitions, which permit a wide variety of dance styles. A popular example of this is the TV program [[So You Think You Can Dance (US)|So You Think You Can Dance]].
*'''[[Dancesport]]''', which is focused exclusively on [[ballroom dance|ballroom]] and [[latin dance]]. Popular examples of this are TV programs [[Dancing with the Stars]] and [[Strictly Come Dancing]].
*'''Single-style''' competitions, such as [[Scottish highland dance|highland dance]], [[dance squad|dance team]], and [[Irish dance]], which only permit a single dance style.

Today, there are various dances and dance show competitions on Television and the Internet.

==Dance occupations==
There are different careers connected with dancing: Dancer, dance teacher, dance sport coach, [[dance therapy|dance therapist]] and [[choreographer]].

;Dancer
Dance training differs depending on the dance form. There are university programs and schools associated with professional dance companies for specialised training in classical dance (e.g. Ballet) and modern dance. There are also smaller, privately owned [[dance studio]]s where students may train in a variety of dance forms including competitive dance forms (e.g. Latin dance, ballroom dance, etc.) as well as ethnic/traditional dance forms.

Professional dancers are usually employed on contract or for particular performances/productions. The professional life of a dancer is generally one of constantly changing work situations, strong competition pressure and low pay. Professional dancers often need to supplement their income, either in dance related roles (e.g., dance teaching, dance sport coaches, yoga) or [[Pilates]] instruction to achieve financial stability.

In the U.S. many professional dancers are members of unions such as the [[American Guild of Musical Artists]], the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and [[Actors' Equity Association]]. The unions help determine working conditions and minimum salaries for their members.

;Dance teachers
Dance teacher and operators of [[dance school]]s rely on reputation and marketing. For dance forms without an association structure such as Salsa or Tango Argentino they may not have formal training. Most dance teachers are self employed.

;Dancesport coaches
Dancesport coaches are tournament dancers or former dancesports people, and may be recognised by a dance sport federation.

;Choreographer
Choreographers are generally university trained and are typically employed for particular projects or, more rarely may work on contract as the resident choreographer for a specific dance company. A choreographic work is protected intellectual property. Dancers may undertake their own choreography.

==Dance by ethnicity or region==
{{Main|List of ethnic, regional, and folk dances sorted by origin}}

===India===
[[File:nonkudri.jpg|thumb|right|267px|[[South indian]] folk Dance like a  horse known as Poi Kal Kudirai]]
{{Main|Dance in India}}

During the first millennium [[common era|BCE]] in India, many texts were composed which attempted to codify aspects of daily life. In the matter of dance, [[Bharata Muni]]'s ''[[Natyashastra]]'' (literally ''&quot;the text of dramaturgy&quot;'') is the one of the earlier texts. Though the main theme of ''[[Natyashastra]]'' deals with drama, dance is also widely featured, and indeed the two concepts have ever since been linked in Indian culture. The text elaborates various hand-gestures or [[mudras]] and classifies movements of the various limbs of the body, gait, and so on.  The [[Natyashastra]] categorised dance into four groups and into four regional varieties, naming the groups: secular, ritual, abstract, and, interpretive. However, concepts of regional geography has altered and so have regional varieties of Indian dances. Dances like ''&quot;Odra Magadhi&quot;'', which after decades long debate, has been traced to present day Mithila-[[Orissa]] region's dance form of [[Odissi]], indicate influence of dances in cultural interactions between different regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exoticindiaart.com/article/dance Exoticindiaart.com], Dance: The Living Spirit of Indian Arts, by Prof. P. C. Jain and Dr. Daljeet.&lt;/ref&gt;

From these beginnings rose the various classical styles which are recognised today. Therefore, all [[Classical Indian dance|Indian classical dances]] are to varying degrees rooted in the [[Natyashastra]] and therefore share common features: for example, the mudras, some body positions, and the inclusion of dramatic or expressive acting or [[abhinaya]].  The Indian classical music tradition provides the accompaniment for the dance, and as percussion is such an integral part of the tradition, the dancers of nearly all the styles wear bells around their ankles to counterpoint and complement the percussion.

====Bhangra in the Punjab====
{{Main|Bhangra}}
The [[Punjab region|Punjab]] area overlapping India and [[Pakistan]] is the place of origin of [[Bhangra]]. It is widely known both as a style of music and a dance. It is mostly related to ancient harvest celebrations, love, patriotism or social issues. Its music is coordinated by a musical instrument called the 'Dhol'. Bhangra is not just music but a dance, a celebration of the harvest where people beat the dhol (drum), sing Boliyaan (lyrics) and dance.It developed further with the Vaisakhi festival of the [[Sikh]]s.

====Dances of Sri Lanka====
{{Main|Dances of Sri Lanka}}
The [[Dances of Sri Lanka#Devil Dances|devil dances of Sri Lanka]] or &quot;yakun natima&quot; are a carefully crafted ritual with a history reaching far back into Sri Lanka's pre-Buddhist past. It combines ancient &quot;[[Ayurvedic]]&quot; concepts of disease causation with psychological manipulation. The dance combines many aspects including Sinhalese cosmology, the dances also has an impact on the [[classical dances of Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lankalibrary.com/rit/yakun%20natuma.htm Lankalibrary.com], &quot;The yakun natima&amp;nbsp;— devil dance ritual of Sri Lanka&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Concert (or performance) dance====
{{Main|Concert dance}}

=====Ballet=====
{{Main|Ballet}}

[[Ballet]] developed first in Italy and then in France from lavish court spectacles that combined music, drama, poetry, song, costumes and dance. Members of the court nobility took part as performers. During the reign of [[Louis XIV]], himself a dancer, dance became more codified. Professional dancers began to take the place of court amateurs, and ballet masters were licensed by the French government. The first ballet dance academy was the Académie Royale de Danse (Royal Dance Academy), opened in Paris in 1661. Shortly thereafter, the first institutionalized ballet troupe, associated with the Academy, was formed; this troupe began as an all-male ensemble but by 1681 opened to include women as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;lecomte&quot;/&gt;

=====20th century concert dance=====
{{Main|20th century concert dance}}

At the beginning of the 20th century, there was an explosion of innovation in dance style characterized by an exploration of freer technique. Early pioneers of what became known as [[modern dance]] include [[Loie Fuller]], [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Mary Wigman]] and [[Ruth St. Denis]]. The relationship of music to dance serves as the basis for [[Eurhythmics]], devised by [[Emile Jaques-Dalcroze]], which was influential to the development of Modern dance and modern ballet through artists such as [[Marie Rambert]]. [[Eurythmy]], developed by [[Rudolf Steiner]] and [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]], combines formal elements reminiscent of traditional dance with the new freer style, and introduced a complex new vocabulary to dance. In the 1920s, important founders of the new style such as [[Martha Graham]] and [[Doris Humphrey]] began their work. Since this time, a wide variety of dance styles have been developed; see [[Modern dance]].

====The influence of African American dance====
{{Main|African American dance}}

[[African American dance]]s are those dances which have developed within African American communities in everyday spaces, rather than in dance studios, schools or companies and its derivatives, [[tap dance]], [[disco]], [[jazz dance]], [[swing dance]], [[hip hop dance]] and [[breakdance]]. Other dances, such as the [[lindy hop]] with its relationship to [[rock and roll|rock and roll music]] and [[rock and roll (dance)|rock and roll dance]] have also had a global influence.

==Early life==
Barrymore was born in [[Culver City, California]], the daughter of American actor [[John Drew Barrymore]] and [[Jaid Barrymore|Ildikó Jaid Barrymore]] ({{née}} Makó),&lt;ref name=&quot;Hello-Profile&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Actor John D.

Barrymore's mother was born in a [[Displaced Persons camp]] in [[Brannenburg]], West Germany to [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[World War II]] refugees. Barrymore's father was of mainly [[English American|English]] and [[Irish people|Irish]], ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://landing.ancestry.com/famoustree/tree.aspx?name=barrymore&amp;sourceCode=8359 |title=Click here to find your ancestors |publisher=landing.ancestry.com |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents [[divorce]]d after she was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hello-Profile&quot; /&gt; She has one half-brother, [[John Blyth Barrymore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Actor Barrymore attacked at home |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1970567.stm |accessdate=2008-09-07 |date=2002-05-06 |publisher=BBC | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; also an actor, and two half-sisters, Blyth Dolores Barrymore and (Brahma) Jessica Blyth Barrymore.

Barrymore was born into acting: her great-grandparents [[Maurice Barrymore]] and [[Georgiana Drew|Georgie Drew Barrymore]], [[Maurice Costello]] and [[Mae Costello]] ({{née}} Altschuk)&lt;ref name=&quot;family&quot;&gt;Stein Hoffman, Carol.

Her first name, ''Drew'', was the maiden name of her paternal great-grandmother, ''Georgie Drew Barrymore''; her middle name, ''Blyth'', was the original surname of the dynasty founded by her great-grandfather, ''Maurice Barrymore''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ActorsStudio&quot; /&gt;

==Career==
===Early career===
[[File:Barrymore.jpg|thumb|alt=Pinkish granite star on blue granite sidewalk|Drew Barrymore's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]

Barrymore's career began when she was auditioned for a dog food commercial at 11 months old.&lt;ref name=&quot;ActorsStudio&quot; /&gt; When she was bitten by her canine co-star, the producers were afraid she would cry, but she merely laughed, and was hired for the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;ActorsStudio&quot; /&gt; She made her film debut in ''[[Altered States]]'' (1980), in which she got a small part.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hello-Profile&quot; /&gt; A year later, she landed the role of Gertie, the younger sister of Elliott, in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', which made her famous.&lt;ref name=&quot;ActorsStudio&quot; /&gt; She received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for Best Supporting Actress in 1984 for her role in ''[[Irreconcilable Differences (film)|Irreconcilable Differences]]'', in which she starred as a young girl divorcing her parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;ActorsStudio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gg&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=HFPA&amp;nbsp;– Awards Search |url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/28761 |accessdate=2008-07-03 |publisher=Golden Globes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] states: &quot;Barrymore is the right actress for this role precisely because she approaches it with such grave calm.&quot; He concludes with saying that &quot;The Drew Barrymore character sees right through all of this. She doesn't care about careers, she wants to be given a happy home and her minimum daily requirement of love, and, in a way, the movie is about how Hollywood (and American success in general) tends to cut adults off from the natural functions of parents.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19840101/REVIEWS/401010349/1023 |title=Irreconciable Differences film review |accessdate=2008-07-15 |date=1984-01-01 |publisher=Roger Ebert.com |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebellious era===
In the wake of this sudden stardom, Barrymore endured a notoriously troubled childhood. She was already a regular at the famed [[Studio 54]] when she was a little girl, smoking [[cigarettes]] at age nine, drinking [[alcohol]] by the time she was 11, smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] at 12, and snorting [[cocaine]] at 13.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hello-Profile&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ActorsStudio&quot; /&gt; Her nightlife and constant partying became a popular subject with the media.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hello-Profile&quot; /&gt; She was in rehab at age 13.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hello-Profile&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ActorsStudio&quot; /&gt; A [[suicide]] attempt at age 14 put her back in rehab, followed by a three-month stay with singer [[David Crosby]] and his wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;People-Bio&quot; /&gt; The stay was precipitated, Crosby said, because she &quot;needed to be around some people that were committed to [[sobriety]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;People-Bio&quot; /&gt; Barrymore later described this period of her life in her [[autobiography]], ''Little Girl Lost.'' The next year, following a successful juvenile court petition for [[emancipation]], she moved into her own apartment.&lt;ref name=&quot;People-Bio&quot; /&gt;

In her late teens, her rebelliousness played itself out on screen and in print. Barrymore forged an image as a manipulative teenage seductress, beginning with the film ''[[Poison Ivy (film)|Poison Ivy]]'' (1992), which was a [[box office]] failure, but was popular on [[video]] and [[cable]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hello-Profile&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Owen |last=Gleiberman |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,310405,00.html|title=Poison Ivy Review |accessdate=2008-07-25 |date=1992-05-08 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, at the age of 17, she posed nude for the cover of the July issue of ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine with her then-fiancé, actor [[Jamie Walters]], as well as appearing nude in pictures inside the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Bronwen|last=Hruska|title=Summer Sneaks Drew, We Hardly Knew Ye The littlest Barrymore finally seems back on track in solid film roles.

{{quote|I really love my body and the way it is right now. There's something very awkward about women and their breasts because men look at them so much. When they're huge, you become very self-conscious. Your back hurts. You find that whatever you wear, you look heavy in. It's uncomfortable. I've learned something, though, about breasts through my years of pondering and pontificating, and that is: Men love them, and I love that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Nancy | last = Mills | title = Now, Drew Love!

'''David Llewelyn Wark Griffith''' (January 22, 1875 – July 23, 1948) was a premier pioneering American [[film director]].&lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', July 28, 1948, page 97.&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known as the director of the controversial and groundbreaking 1915 film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' and the subsequent film ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916).&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=David W. Griffith, Film Pioneer, Dies; Producer Of 'Birth Of Nation,' 'Intolerance' And 'America' Made Nearly 500 Pictures Set, Screen Standards Co-Founder Of United Artists Gave Mary Pickford And Fairbanks Their Starts. |url= |quote= |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=July 24, 1948, Saturday |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffith's film ''The Birth of a Nation'' made pioneering use of advanced camera and narrative techniques, and its immense popularity set the stage for the dominance of the [[feature length|feature-length film]]. It also proved extremely controversial at the time and ever since for its negative depiction of Black Americans and their supporters, and its positive portrayal of slavery and the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Griffith responded to his critics with his next film, ''Intolerance'', intended to show the dangers of prejudiced thought and behavior. The film was not the financial success that its predecessor had been, but was received warmly by critics. Several of his later films were also successful, but high production, promotional, and [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] costs often made his ventures commercial failures. Even so, he is generally considered one of the most important figures of early cinema.

==Early life==
Griffith, of Welsh ancestry, was born in [[La Grange, Kentucky|La Grange]], [[Kentucky]] to Jacob &quot;Roaring Jake&quot; Griffith and Mary Perkins Griffith. His father was a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] colonel in the [[American Civil War]] and a Kentucky legislator. He was raised as a [[Methodist]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adherents.com/largecom/fam_meth.html&lt;/ref&gt; D.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;was educated by his older sister, Mattie, in a one-room country school. His father died when he was seven, upon which the family experienced serious financial hardships. At age 14, Griffith's mother abandoned the farm and moved the family to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] where she opened a boarding house, which failed shortly after. Griffith left high school to help with the finances, taking a job first in a dry goods store, and later in a bookstore.

Griffith began his career as a hopeful playwright but met with little success; only one of his plays was accepted for a performance.&lt;ref name= &quot;DWPlay&quot;&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAgriffith.htm D. W. Griffith&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Griffith decided instead to become an actor, and appeared in many plays as an extra.&lt;ref name= &quot;DWG&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pickford/peopleevents/p_griffith.html American Experience | Mary Pickford | People &amp; Events | PBS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film career==
[[File:Walthall with DW Griiffith2.jpg|right|200px|thumb|D. W. Griffith on a movie set with actor [[Henry B. Walthall|Henry Walthall]] and others]]
In 1907, Griffith, still having goals for becoming a successful playwright, went to New York and attempted to sell a script to [[Edison Studios]] producer [[Edwin Porter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DWPlay&quot; /&gt; Porter rejected Griffith's script, but gave him an acting part in ''[[Rescued from an Eagle's Nest]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DWPlay&quot; /&gt; Finding his way into the motion picture business, he soon began to direct a huge body of work. In 1908, Griffith accepted an acting job for the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company]], commonly known as Biograph, in [[New York City]]. At Biograph, Griffith's career in the film industry would also change forever.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.starpulse.com/Actors/Griffith,_D.W./Biography/ D.W. Griffith Biography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Biograph's main director Wallace McCutcheon grew ill, and his son, Wallace McCutcheon, Jr., took his place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorian-cinema.net/mccutcheon.htm Who's Who of Victorian Cinema&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; McCutcheon, Jr., however, was not able to bring the studio success.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; As a result, Biograph head Henry Marvin decided to give Griffith the position;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; Griffith then made his first movie for the company, ''The Adventures of Dollie''.

Biograph was the first company to shoot a film in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], California, the film ''[[In Old California (1910)|In Old California]]'' (1910). Influenced by the Italian [[feature film]] ''[[Cabiria]]'' (1914), Griffith was convinced that feature films were commercially viable. He produced and directed the Biograph film ''[[Judith of Bethulia]]'' (1914), one of the earliest feature films to be produced in the United States. However, Biograph believed that longer features were not viable. According to actress [[Lillian Gish]], &quot;[Biograph] thought that a movie that long would hurt [the audience's] eyes&quot;.

Because of this, and the film's budget overrun (it cost US$30,000 dollars to produce), Griffith left Biograph and took his whole stock company of actors with him. He joined the Mutual Film Corporation and formed a studio, with Majestic Studio manager Harry Aitken&lt;ref name= Aitken&gt;[http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/dwgriffith.htm D. W. Griffith: Hollywood Independent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; known as Reliance-Majestic Studios (which was later renamed Fine Arts Studio).&lt;ref&gt;[http://employees.oxy.edu/jerry/finearts.htm Fine Arts Studio&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His new production company became an autonomous production unit partner in [[Triangle Film Corporation]] along with [[Thomas H. Ince|Thomas Ince]] and [[Keystone Studios|Keystone Studios']] [[Mack Sennett]]; the Triangle Film Corporation was headed by Griffith's partner Harry Aitken, who was released from the Mutual Film Corporation&lt;ref name=Aitken/&gt; and his brother Roy. Through [[Reliance-Majestic Studios]], he produced ''[[The Birth of a Nation|The Clansman]]'' (1915), which would later be known as ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''.
[[File:DW Griffith star HWF.JPG|thumb|right|Star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6535 Hollywood Blvd.]]
Historically, ''The Birth of a Nation'' was the first ''blockbuster''. It is considered important by film historians as one of the first [[feature length]] American films (most previous films had been less than one hour long), and arguably it changed the industry standard to one still recognized today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moviejustice.com/vault/index.php?p=getitem&amp;db_id=4&amp;item_id=27 MJ Movie Reviews - Birth of a Nation, The (1915) by Dan DeVore&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was enormously popular, breaking box office records, but aroused controversy due to its depiction of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] [[race relations]] in the Civil War and the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]]. Like its source material, [[Thomas Dixon, Jr.]]'s 1905 novel ''[[The Clansman]]'', it depicts Southern pre-Civil War slavery as benign, the enfranchisement [[freedman]] as a corrupt [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] plot, and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] as a band of heroes restoring the rightful order. This view of the era was popular at the time, and was endorsed by historians of the [[Dunning School]] for decades, although it met with strong criticism from the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] and other groups. However, attempts by the NAACP to stop showings of the film failed, and it went on to become the most successful box office attraction of its time. &quot;They lost track of the money it made,&quot; [[Lillian Gish]] once remarked in a [[Kevin Brownlow]] interview. Among the people who profited by the film was [[Louis B. Mayer]], who bought the rights to distribute ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' in [[New England]]. With the money he made, he was able to begin his career as a producer that culminated in the creation of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] studios. [[Margaret Mitchell]], who wrote ''[[Gone with the Wind]],'' was also inspired by Griffith's Civil War epic{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.
[[File:D W Griffith.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|Griffith at a rolltop desk, c.&amp;nbsp;1925]]
However, after seeing ''The Birth of a Nation'', audiences in some major northern cities also responded by rioting over the film's racial content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_birth.html The Rise and Fall of Jim Crow . Jim Crow Stories . The Birth of a Nation | PBS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After ''The Birth of a Nation'' had run its course in theaters, Griffith would also respond to the negative reception a vast amount of critics gave the film through his next film ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'', which dealt with the effects of intolerance in four different historical periods: the Fall of Babylon; the Crucifixion of Christ; the Massacre of the Huguenots; and a modern story. During its release, however, ''Intolerance'' was not a financial success; although it had good box office turn-outs, the film did not bring in enough profits to cover the lavish road show that accompanied it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/7_dwg_2.htm  &quot;Griffith's 20 Year Record&quot;, ''Variety'' (September 25, 1928), as edited by David Pierce for ''The Silent Film Bookshelf,'' on line.]&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''The Birth Of A Nation'', Griffith put a huge budget into the film's production, which was also a key factor in its failure at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contactmusic.com/new/film.nsf/reviews/intolerance Intolerance Movie Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The production partnership was dissolved in 1917, so Griffith went to [[Artcraft]] (part of [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]), then to [[First National]] (1919–1920). At the same time he founded [[United Artists]], together with [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Mary Pickford]], and [[Douglas Fairbanks]]. At United Artists, Griffith continued to make films, but never could achieve box office grosses as high as either ''The Birth of a Nation'' or ''Intolerance''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/griffith_d.html American Masters . D.W. Griffith | PBS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffith was also a producer on the 1915 movie ''[[Martyrs of the Alamo]]''.

==Later film career==
[[File:Gish and Barthelmess Broken Blossoms.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[Broken Blossoms]]'']]
Though [[United Artists]] survived as a company, Griffith's association with it was short-lived, and while some of his later films did well at the box office, commercial success often eluded him. Griffith features from this period include ''[[Broken Blossoms]]'' (1919), ''[[Way Down East]]'' (1920), ''[[Orphans of the Storm]]'' (1921), ''[[Dream Street (film)|Dream Street]]'' (1921), ''[[One Exciting Night]]'' (1922) and ''[[America (film)|America]]'' (1924). Of these, the first three were successes at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Last Dissolve|date=1948-08-02|work=[[Time Magazine]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,888442,00.html|accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffith was forced to leave United Artists after ''[[Isn't Life Wonderful]]'' (1924) failed at the box office, and returned to his job as a director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gildasattic.com/dwgriffith.html D. W. Griffith (1875-1948)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Griffith made a part-talkie ''[[Lady of the Pavements]]'' (1929) and only two full-sound films, ''[[Abraham Lincoln (film)|Abraham Lincoln]]'' (1930) and ''[[The Struggle (film)|The Struggle]]'' (1931). Neither was successful, and he never made another film.

In 1936, director [[Woody Van Dyke]] who had worked as Griffith's apprentice on ''[[Intolerance (1916 movie)|Intolerance]]'', asked Griffith to help him shoot the famous earthquake sequence for ''[[San Francisco (film)|San Francisco]]''. Though Griffith was uncredited, the [[Clark Gable]] - [[Jeanette MacDonald]] - [[Spencer Tracy]] blockbuster was the top-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[[1936 in film]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, producer [[Hal Roach]] hired Griffith to produce ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' (1939) and ''[[One Million B.C.]]'' (1940), writing to him, &quot;I need help from the production side to select the proper writers, cast, etc. and to help me generally in the supervision of these pictures.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lewis Ward, ''A History of the Hal Roach Studios'', p. 109-110. Southern Illinois University, 2005. ISBN 080932637X. In his [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph]] days, Griffith had directed two films with prehistoric settings: ''Man's Genesis'' (1912), and ''Brute Force'' (1913).&lt;/ref&gt; Although Griffith eventually disagreed with Roach over the production and parted, Roach later insisted that some of the scenes in the completed film were directed by Griffith. This would make the film the final production in which Griffith was actively involved. However, cast members recall Griffith directing only the [[screen test]]s and costume tests. When Roach advertised the film in late 1939 with Griffith listed as producer, Griffith asked that his name be removed.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Griffith died of [[cerebral hemorrhage]] in 1948 on the way to a Hollywood hospital, after being discovered unconscious in the lobby at the [[Knickerbocker Hotel (Los Angeles)|Knickerbocker Hotel]] in Los Angeles, where he had been living alone.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; There was a large public service in his honor at the Hollywood Masonic Temple, where few stars came to pay their last respects. He is buried at Mount Tabor Methodist Church Graveyard in [[Centerfield, Kentucky|Centerfield]], Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=1744 D.W. Griffith (1875 - 1948) - Find A Grave Memorial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, The [[Directors Guild of America]] provided a stone and bronze monument for his gravesite.

==Legacy==
[[File:Stamp US 1975 10c Griffith.jpg|thumb|right|Stamp issued by the [[United States Postal Service]] commemorating D.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Griffith]]
Motion picture legend [[Charles Chaplin]] called Griffith &quot;The Teacher of us All&quot;. This sentiment was widely shared. Filmmakers as diverse as [[John Ford]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Orson Welles]] have spoken of their respect for the director of ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]''. Orson Welles said of him &quot;I have never really hated Hollywood except for its treatment of D. W. Griffith. No town, no industry, no profession, no art form owes so much to a single man.&quot; Regardless of whether he actually invented new techniques in film grammar, he seems to have been the first to understand how these techniques could be used to create an expressive language, something that would gain popular recognition with the release of ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915). In early shorts such as Biograph's ''[[The Musketeers of Pig Alley]]'' (1912) which was the first &quot;Gangster film&quot;, we can see how Griffith's attention to camera placement and lighting heighten mood and tension. In making ''Intolerance'' the director opened up new possibilities for the medium, creating a form that seems to owe more to music than to traditional narrative. Griffith was honored on a 10-cent postage stamp by the United States issued May&amp;nbsp;5, 1975.

[[File:DWGriffith HistMarker.JPG|thumb|left|California Historical Marker marking the site of D.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Griffith's movie ranch in Sylmar, California]]
In 1953, the [[Directors Guild of America]] instituted the D.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Griffith Award, its highest honor. Its recipients included [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[David Lean]], [[John Huston]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[John Ford]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]], and Griffith's friend [[Cecil B. DeMille]]. However, on December&amp;nbsp;15, 1999, DGA President [[Jack Shea (director)|Jack Shea]] and the DGA National Board announced that the award would be renamed the DGA Lifetime Achievement Award because Griffith's film ''The Birth of a Nation'' &quot;helped foster intolerable racial stereotypes.&quot; [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[Sidney Lumet]], previous recipients of the award, agreed with the guild's decision.

Griffith was a leading character in ''[[The Biograph Girl]]'', a 1980 stage musical about the silent film era. On December&amp;nbsp;10, 2008 [[Hollywood Heritage Museum]] hosted a screening of Griffith's earliest films, to commemorate the centennial since his start in film.&lt;ref&gt;http://hollywoodheritage.org/events.html&lt;/ref&gt; On January&amp;nbsp;22, 2009 the Oldham History Center in [[La Grange, Kentucky|La Grange]], Kentucky opened a 15&amp;nbsp;seat theatre in Griffith's honor. The theatre features a library of Griffith films to choose from.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20090122/ZONE09/901220528&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film preservation==
D.W. Griffith has five films preserved in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. These films are ''[[Lady Helen's Escapade]]'' (1909), ''[[A Corner in Wheat]]'' (1909), ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance: Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages]]'' (1916), and ''[[Broken Blossoms]]'' (1919).

In [[physical geography]], a '''dune''' is a [[hill]] of [[sand]] built by [[aeolian processes]]. Dunes occur in different forms and sizes, formed by interaction with the wind. Most kinds of dunes are longer on the windward side where the sand is pushed up the dune and have a shorter &quot;slip face&quot; in the lee of the wind. The valley or trough between dunes is called a ''slack.'' A &quot;dune field&quot; is an area covered by extensive sand dunes. Large dune fields are known as [[erg (landform)|erg]]s.

Some coastal areas have one or more sets of dunes running parallel to the shoreline directly inland from the [[beach]]. In most cases the dunes are important in protecting the land against potential ravages by storm waves from the [[sea]]. Although the most widely distributed dunes are those associated with coastal regions, the largest complexes of dunes are found inland in dry regions and associated with ancient [[lake]] or [[sea]] beds.

Dunes also form under the action of water flow ([[alluvial]] processes), and on sand or [[gravel]] beds of [[river]]s, [[estuary|estuaries]] and the sea-bed.

The modern word &quot;dune&quot; came into English from French circa 1790. In ancient times, words cognate to &quot;dune&quot; probably had the meaning of a built-up hill or citadel fortification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=dune dune - Definitions from Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
Dune habitats provide niches for highly specialized plants and animals, including numerous [[rare species]] and some [[endangered species]]. Due to widespread human population expansion, dunes face destruction through land development and recreational usages, as well as alteration to prevent the encroachment of sand onto inhabited areas. Some countries, notably the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Netherlands]], have developed significant programs of dune protection through the use of [[sand dune stabilization]]. In the U.K., a [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] has been developed to assess dunes loss and to prevent future dunes destruction.

==Aeolian dune shapes==
[[File:Dune en.svg|thumb|280px]]

===Crescentic===
Crescent-shaped mounds are generally wider than they are long. The slipfaces are on the concave sides of the dunes. These dunes form under winds that blow consistently from one direction, and they also are known as [[barchan]]s, or transverse dunes. Some types of crescentic dunes move more quickly over [[desert]] surfaces than any other type of dune. A group of dunes moved more than 100 metres per year between 1954 and 1959 in the [[People's Republic of China|China]]'s [[Ningxia Province]], and similar speeds have been recorded in the Western Desert of [[Egypt]]. The largest crescentic dunes on Earth, with mean crest-to-crest widths of more than 3 kilometres, are in China's [[Taklamakan]] Desert.

===Linear===
Straight or slightly sinuous sand ridges typically much longer than they are wide are known as linear dunes. They may be more than {{convert|160|km|mi}} long. Some linear dunes merge to form Y-shaped compound dunes. Many form in bidirectional wind regimes. The long axes of these dunes extend in the resultant direction of sand movement.

Linear [[loess]] hills known as [[paha (landform)|pahas]] appear to be superficially similar. These hills appear to have been formed during the last [[ice age]] under [[permafrost]] conditions dominated by sparse [[tundra]] vegetation.

===Star===
Radially symmetrical, star dunes are pyramidal sand mounds with slipfaces on three or more arms that radiate from the high center of the mound. They tend to accumulate in areas with multidirectional wind regimes. Star dunes grow upward rather than laterally. They dominate the [[Grand Erg Oriental]] of the Sahara. In other deserts, they occur around the margins of the [[sand sea]]s, particularly near topographic barriers. In the southeast [[Badain Jaran Desert]] of China, the star dunes are up to 500 metres tall and may be the tallest dunes on Earth.

===Dome===
Oval or circular mounds that generally lack a slipface, dome dunes are rare, and these occur at the far upwind margins of sand seas.

===Parabolic===
U-shaped mounds of sand with convex noses trailed by elongated arms are parabolic dunes. These dunes are formed from blowout dunes where the erosion of vegetated sand leads to a U-shaped depression. The elongated arms are held in place by vegetation; the largest arm known on Earth reaches 12&amp;nbsp;km. Sometimes these dunes are called U-shaped, [[blowout (geology)|blowout]], or hairpin dunes, and they are well known in coastal deserts. Unlike crescent shaped dunes, their crests point upwind. The bulk of the sand in the dune migrates forward.

In plan view, these are U-shaped or V-shaped mounds of well-sorted, very fine to medium sand with elongated arms that extend upwind behind the central part of the dune. There are slip faces that often occur on the outer side of the nose and on the outer slopes of the arms.

These dunes often occur in semiarid areas where the precipitation is retained in the lower parts of the dune and underlying soils. Parabolic dunes are dependent on the vegetation that covers them—grasses,shrubs,and trees, which help anchor the trailing arms. In inland deserts, parabolic dunes commonly originate and extend downwind from blowouts in sand sheets only partly anchored by vegetation. They can also originate from beach sands and extend inland into vegetated areas in coastal zones and on shores of large lakes.

Most parabolic dunes do not reach heights higher than a few tens of metres except at their nose, where vegetation stops or slows the advance of accumulating sand.

Simple parabolic dunes have only one set of arms that trail upwind, behind the leading nose. Compound parabolic dunes are coalesced features with several sets of trailing arms. Complex parabolic dunes include subsidiary superposed or coalesced forms, usually of barchanoid or linear shapes.

Parabolic dunes, like crescent dunes, occur in areas where very strong winds are mostly unidirectional. Although these dunes are found in areas now characterized by variable wind speeds, the effective winds associated with the growth and migration of both the parabolic and crescent dunes probably are the most consistent in wind direction.

The grain size for these well-sorted, very fine to medium sands is about 0.06 to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm. Parabolic dunes have loose sand and steep slopes only on their outer flanks. The inner slopes are mostly well packed and anchored by vegetation, as are the corridors between individual dunes. Because all dune arms are oriented in the same direction, and, the inter-dune corridors are generally swept clear of loose sand, the corridors can usually be traversed in between the trailing arms of the dune. However to cross straight over the dune by going over the trailing arms, can be very difficult. Also, traversing the nose is very difficult as well because the nose is usually made up of loose sand without much if any vegetation.

===Longitudinal (Seif) dunes===
[[File:Seif.gif|thumb|left|Seif dunes.]]
[[File:Rub' al Khali (Arabian Empty Quarter) sand dunes imaged by Terra (EOS AM-1).jpg|thumb|200px|Rub' al Khali seen by the [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer|ASTER]] instrument on NASA's [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] satellite]]
Longitudinal dunes (also called Seif dunes, after the Arabic word for &quot;sword&quot;), elongate parallel to the prevailing wind, possibly caused by a larger dune having its smaller sides blown away. Seif dunes are sharp-crested and are common in the Sahara. They range up to {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}} in height and {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} in length. In the southern third of the Arabian Peninsula, a region called the Empty Quarter because of its total lack of population, a vast erg called Rub al Khali contains seif dunes that stretch for almost 200&amp;nbsp;km and reach heights of over 300&amp;nbsp;m.

Seif dunes are thought to develop from barchans if a change of the usual wind direction occurs. The new wind direction will lead to the development of a new wing and the over development of one of the original wings. If the prevailing wind then becomes dominant for a lengthy period of time the dune will revert to its barchan form, with one exaggerated wing. Should the strong wind then return the exaggerated wing will further extend so that eventually it will be supplied with sand when the prevailing wind returns. The wing will continue to grow under both wind conditions, thus producing a seif dune. On a seif dune the slip face develops on the side facing away from the strong wind, while the slip face of a barchan faces the direction of movement. In the sheltered troughs between highly developed seif dunes barchans may be formed because the wind is unidirectional.

A transverse dune is perpendicular to the prevailing wind, probably caused by a steady build-up of sand on an already existing minuscule mound.

===Reversing dunes===
[[File:Dune 7 in the Namib Desert.jpeg|thumb|right|Complex dune: Dune 7 in the [[Namib desert]], one of the tallest in the world.]]

Occurring wherever winds periodically reverse direction, reversing dunes are varieties of any of the above shapes. These dunes typically have major and minor slipfaces oriented in opposite directions.

All these dune shapes may occur in three forms: simple, compound, and complex. Simple dunes are basic forms with a minimum number of slipfaces that define the geometric type. Compound dunes are large dunes on which smaller dunes of similar type and slipface orientation are superimposed, and complex dunes are combinations of two or more dune types. A crescentic dune with a star dune superimposed on its crest is the most common complex dune. Simple dunes represent a wind regime that has not changed in intensity or direction since the formation of the dune, while compound and complex dunes suggest that the intensity and direction of the wind has changed.

==Dune types==
[[File:DunePyla2.jpg|thumb|[[The Great Dune of Pyla]] is the largest dune in [[Europe]].]]

===Sub-aqueous dunes===
[[Image:Megaripple.JPG|thumb|Sub-aqueous lithified dune (megaripple) from Utah.]]
Sub-aqueous ([[underwater]]) dunes (also known in geology as megaripples) form on a bed of sand or gravel under the actions of water flow. They are ubiquitous in natural [[Channel (geography)|channels]] such as rivers and estuaries, and also form in engineered [[canal]]s and pipelines. Dunes move downstream as the upstream slope is eroded and the sediment deposited on the downstream or lee slope in typical [[bedform]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;Prothero, D. R. and Schwab, F., 1996, Sedimentary Geology, pg. 45-49, ISBN 0-7167-2726-9&lt;/ref&gt;

These dunes most often form as a continuous 'train' of dunes, showing remarkable similarity in [[wavelength]] and height.

Dunes on the bed of a channel significantly increase flow resistance, their presence and growth playing a major part in river [[flooding]].

===Lithified dunes===
A [[lithified]] (consolidated) sand dune is a type of [[sandstone]] that is formed when a marine or aeolian sand dune becomes compacted and hardened. Once in this form, water passing through the rock can carry and deposit minerals, which can alter the color of the rock. Cross-bedded layers of stacks of lithified dunes can produce the cross-hatching patterns, such as those seen in the [[Zion National Park]] in the western [[United States]].

A slang term that is used in the Southwestern States (of the U.S.A.) for those consolidated and hardened sand dunes is &quot;slickrock&quot;, a name that was introduced by pioneers of the Old West because their steel-rimmed wagon wheels could not gain traction on the rock.

===Coastal dunes===
[[File:SandDunesSutherlandShire.jpg|thumb|Coastal dunes on the [[Cronulla sand dunes, Kurnell Peninsula|Kurnell Peninsula]] in [[Southern Sydney]]]]

Dunes form where '''constructive waves''' encourage the accumulation of sand, and where prevailing '''onshore winds''' blow this sand inland. There need to be obstacles for example, vegetation, pebbles and so on. to trap the moving sand grains. As the sand grains get trapped they start to accumulate, starting dune formation. The wind then starts to affect the mound of sand by eroding sand particles from the windward side and depositing them on the leeward side. Gradually this action causes the dune to “migrate” inland, as it does so it accumulates more and more sand.
Dunes provide [[privacy]] and shelter from the [[wind]].

====Ecological succession on coastal dunes====
[[File:Curonian spit.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Coastal dunes in [[Curonian spit]].]]
As a dune forms, plant [[Ecological succession|succession]] occurs. The conditions on an ''embryo dune'' are harsh, with [[salt spray]] from the sea carried on strong winds. The dune is well drained and often dry, and composed of calcium carbonate from seashells. Rotting [[seaweed]], brought in by storm waves adds nutrients to allow [[pioneer species]] to colonize the dune. These pioneer species are [[Ammophila (Poaceae)|marram grass]], [[sea wort grass]] and other sea grasses in the [[United Kingdom]]. These plants are well adapted to the harsh conditions of the fore-dune
typically having deep roots which reach the [[water table]], [[root nodules]] that produce [[nitrogen]] compounds, and protected [[stoma]], reducing [[transpiration]]. Also, the deep roots bind the sand together, and the dune grows into a [[fore dune]] as more sand is blown over the grasses. The grasses add [[nitrogen]] to the soil, meaning other, less hardy plants can then colonize the dunes. Typically these are [[Calluna|heather]], [[Heath (habitat)|heath]]s and [[gorse]]s. These too are adapted to the low soil water content and have small, prickly leaves which reduce transpiration. Heather adds [[humus]] to the soil and is usually replaced by [[conifer]]ous trees, which can tolerate low soil [[pH]], caused by the accumulation and decomposition of organic matter with nitrate leaching.&lt;ref name=Miles1985&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Miles | first =  J.| year = 1985| title = The pedogenic effects of different species and vegetation types and the implications of succession| journal = European Journal of Soil Science| volume = 36| issue = 4| pages = 571| doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2389.1985.tb00359.x| postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coniferous forests and [[heathland]] are common [[climax community|climax communities]] for sand dune systems.

Young dunes are called [[yellow dune]]s and dunes which have high humus content are called [[grey dune]]s. Leaching occurs on the dunes, washing humus into the slacks, and the slacks may be much more developed than the exposed tops of the dunes. It is usually in the slacks that more rare species are developed and there is a tendency for the dune slacks soil to be waterlogged and where only marsh plants can survive. These plants would include: creeping willow, cotton grass, yellow ins, reeds, and rushes. As for the species, there is a tendency for [[natterjack toad]]s to breed here.

==Desertification==
{{Main|Desertification}}
[[File:Highway sand dune.JPG|thumb|right|One way of preventing sand from accumulating in roadways is planting [[tree]]s and [[vegetation]] along the road.]]
Sand dunes can have a negative impact on humans when they encroach on human habitats. Sand dunes move via a few different means, all of them helped along by wind. One way that dunes can move is by [[saltation (geology)|saltation]], where sand particles skip along the ground like a bouncing ball. When these skipping particles land, they may knock into other particles and cause them to move as well, in a process known as [[creep]]. With slightly stronger winds, particles collide in mid-air, causing [[sheet flow]]s. In a major [[dust storm]], dunes may move tens of metres through such sheet flows. Also as in the case of snow, sand [[avalanche]]s, falling down the [[slipface]] of the dunes - that face away from the winds - also move the dunes forward.

Sand threatens buildings and crops in Africa, the Middle East, and China. Drenching sand dunes with oil stops their migration, but this approach is quite destructive to the dunes' animal habitats and uses a valuable resource. [[Sand fence]]s might also slow their movement to a crawl, but geologists are still analyzing results for the optimum fence designs.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Preventing sand dunes from overwhelming towns, villages, and agricultural areas has become a priority for the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]. Planting dunes with vegetation also helps to stabilise them.

Dunes can likely be found in any environment where there is a substantial atmosphere, winds, and dust to be blown. Dunes are common on [[Mars]], and they have also been observed in the equatorial regions of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] using the radar system of the [[Cassini space probe]].

Titan's dunes include large expanses with modal lengths of about 20–30&amp;nbsp;km. The regions are not topographically confined, resembling sand seas. These dunes are interpreted to be longitudinal dunes whose crests are oriented parallel to the dominant wind direction, which generally indicates west-to-east wind flow. The sand is likely composed of hydrocarbon particles, possibly with some water ice mixed in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000733/ Peeking Through the Haze: Titan's Surface, part II - The Planetary Society Blog | The Planetary Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Keith Lynch''' (born January 20, 1946) is an American [[filmmaker]], [[television director]], [[visual artist]], musician and occasional actor. Known for his [[surrealism|surrealist]] films, he has developed his own unique cinematic style, which has been dubbed &quot;Lynchian&quot;, and which is characterized by its dream imagery and meticulous [[sound design]]. Indeed, the surreal and in many cases violent elements to his films have earned them the reputation that they &quot;disturb, offend or mystify&quot; their audiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch245&quot;&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moving around various parts of the United States as a child within his middle class family, Lynch went on to study painting in [[Philadelphia]], where he first made the transition to producing short films. Deciding to devote himself more fully to this medium, he moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (1977). After ''Eraserhead'' became a [[cult classic]] on the [[midnight movie]] circuit, Lynch was employed to direct ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980), from which he gained mainstream success. Then being employed by the [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]], he proceeded to make two films. First, the science-fiction epic ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'' (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and then a [[neo-noir]] crime film, ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986), which was highly critically acclaimed.

Proceeding to create his own television series with [[Mark Frost]], the highly popular murder mystery ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' (1990–1992), he also created a cinematic prequel, ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me|Fire Walk With Me]]'' (1992), a road movie, ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'' (1990), and a family film, ''[[The Straight Story]]'' (1999) in the same period. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his following films worked on &quot;dream logic&quot; non-linear narrative structures, ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997), ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001) and ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' (2006).

Lynch has received three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], for his films ''The Elephant Man'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1202300031690| title= 1980 Academy Awards Nominations}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blue Velvet''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1202300217934| title= 1986 Academy Awards Nominations}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Mulholland Drive'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1202300255441| title= 2001 Academy Awards Nominations}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also received a screenplay Academy Award nomination for ''The Elephant Man''. Lynch has twice won France's [[César Award for Best Foreign Film]], as well as the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cannes-1990.com&quot; /&gt; and a [[Golden Lion]] award for lifetime achievement at the [[Venice Film Festival]]. The French government awarded him the [[Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honor]], the country's top civilian honor, as a ''Chevalier'' in 2002 and then an ''Officier'' in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/01/entertainment/main3315542.shtml|title=The Police Knighted In France: Filmmaker David Lynch Promoted to Officer in France's Legion of Honor |publisher=CBS News Online |date=1 October 2007 | accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while that same year, ''[[The Guardian]]'' described Lynch as &quot;the most important director of this era&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/page/0,11456,1082823,00.html|title=40 best directors |publisher=The Guardian Online |year=2007 | accessdate=29 November 2010| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5Qeh0Qrlu | archivedate = 2007-07-27| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allmovie]] called him &quot;the [[Polymath|Renaissance man]] of modern American filmmaking&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Ankeny | first = Jason | url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/david-lynch-100454 |title=David Lynch: Biography |publisher=Allmovie |accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the success of his films have led to him being labelled &quot;the first popular Surrealist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Pauline Kael, quoted in Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
===Early life: 1946–1965===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=right|quote=&quot;My childhood was elegant homes, tree-lined streets, the milkman, building backyard forts, droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees. [[Middle class#Middle America|Middle America]] as it’s supposed to be. But on the cherry tree there's this pitch oozing out – some black, some yellow, and millions of [[red ants]] crawling all over it. I discovered that if one looks a little closer at this beautiful world, there are ''always'' red ants underneath. Because I grew up in a perfect world, other things were a contrast.&quot;|source=David Lynch&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Lynch was born in [[Missoula, Montana|Missoula]], [[Montana]] on January 20, 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb&quot;&gt;{{IMDb name|0000186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Donald Walton Lynch, was a research scientist working for the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], and his mother, Edwina &quot;Sunny&quot; Lynch (née Sundholm), was an English language [[tutor]]&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb&quot; /&gt; whose grandfather's parents had immigrated to the United States from [[Finland]] in the 19th century. Lynch was raised a [[Presbyterian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Williams | first = Alex |url=http://www.rickross.com/reference/tm/tm150.html|title=David Lynch's Shockingly Peaceful Inner Life |publisher=New York Times |date=31 December 2007 | accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Sadighian | first = David |url=http://www.globalgoodnews.com/education-news-a.html?art=1128100751793764 |title=David Lynch thinks we're all lightbulbs. What? |publisher=Yale Daily News |date=1 October 2005 | accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Donald's job, the Lynch family often moved around according to where the Department of Agriculture assigned him. It was because of this that when he was two months old, David Lynch moved with his parents to [[Sandpoint, Idaho]], and only two years after that, following the birth of his brother John, the family again moved, this time to [[Spokane, Washington]]. It was here that his sister Martha was born, before they once more moved, this time to [[Durham, North Carolina]], then to [[Boise, Idaho]] and then to [[Alexandria, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Lynch found this transitory early life relatively easy to adjust to, noting that he found it fairly easy to meet new friends whenever he started attending a new school.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on much of his early life, Lynch has remarked that &quot;I found the world completely and totally fantastic as a child. Of course, I had the usual fears, like going to school… For me, back then, school was a crime against young people. It destroyed the seeds of liberty. The teachers didn't encourage knowledge or a positive attitude.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside this schooling, his father made him join the [[Boy scouts of america|Boy Scouts]], although he would later note that he only &quot;became one so I could quit, and put it behind me.&quot; He rose to the highest rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]. It was through being an Eagle Scout that he was present with other Boy Scouts outside of the [[White House]] at the [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]], which took place on Lynch's birthday in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch had become interested in painting and drawing from an early age, becoming intrigued by the idea of pursuing it as a career path when living in Virginia, where his friend's father was a professional painter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; At Francis C. Hammond High School in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], he did poorly academically, having little interest in school work, but was popular with other students, and after leaving decided that he wanted to study painting at college, thereby beginning his studies at [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] in 1964, where he was a roommate of [[Peter Wolf]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterwolf.com/bio/index2.html Peter Wolf – Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he left after only a year, stating that &quot;I was not inspired AT ALL in that place&quot;, and instead deciding that he wanted to travel around [[Europe]] for three years with his friend [[Jack Fisk]], who was similarly unhappy with his studies at [[Cooper Union]]. They had some hopes that in Europe they could train with the [[expressionism|expressionist]] painter [[Oskar Kokoschka]] at his school, however upon reaching [[Salzburg]] they found that he was not available, and disillusioned, they returned to the United States after spending only 15 days of their planned three years in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 31–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philadelphia and short films: 1966–1970===
[[File:Six Men Getting Sick.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Screenshot from ''Six Men Getting Sick''. The film was an animation based upon Lynch's paintings.]]
Back in the United States, Lynch returned to Virginia, but since his parents had moved to [[Walnut Creek, California]], he was forced to stay with his friend Tony Keeler for a while, before he decided to move to the city of [[Philadelphia]], where, at the advice of Jack Fisk, who was already attending it, he decided to enroll at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]], something he preferred far more than his previous art college in Boston, claiming that &quot;In Philadelphia there were great and serious painters, and everybody was inspiring one another and it was a beautiful time there.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that he began a relationship with a fellow student, Peggy Reavey, and they were married in 1967. The following year, Peggy gave birth to their child, a girl whom they named Jennifer. Later describing this situation, Peggy stated that &quot;[Lynch] definitely was a reluctant father, but a very loving one. Hey, I was pregnant when we got married. We were both reluctant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; As a family, they moved to the [[Fairmount, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Fairmount]] neighbourhood of Philadelphia, where they were able to purchase a large 12-room house for a relatively low $3,500 due to the high crime and poverty rates in the area. Later describing living there, Lynch stated that &quot;We lived cheap, but the city was full of fear. A kid was shot to death down the street… We were robbed twice, had windows shot out and a car stolen. The house was first broken into only three days after we moved in… The feeling was so close to extreme danger, and the fear was so intense. There was violence and hate and filth. But the biggest influence in my whole life was that city.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in order to help financially support his family alongside his art studies, he took up a job printing engravings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at the Philadelphia Academy that Lynch made his very first [[short film]], which was entitled ''[[Six Men Getting Sick]]'' (1966). He had first come up with the idea when he developed a wish to see his paintings move, and he subsequently began discussing the idea of creating an [[animation]] with an artist named Bruce Samuelson. When this project never came about, Lynch decided to work on a film alone, and so purchased the cheapest 16mm camera that he could find in order to do so. Taking one of the abandoned upper rooms of the Academy as a working space, he spent $200 – which at the time he felt to be a lot of money – to produce ''Six Men Getting Sick''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the work as &quot;57&amp;nbsp;seconds of growth and fire, and three seconds of vomit&quot;, Lynch played the film on a loop at the Academy's annual end-of-year exhibit, where it shared joint first prize with a painting by Noel Mahaffey.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a commission from one of his fellow students, the wealthy H. Barton Wasserman, who offered him $1000 to create a film installation in his home. Spending $450 of that on purchasing a second-hand [[Bolex]] camera, Lynch produced a new animated short, but upon getting the film developed, realized that the result was simply a blurred, frameless print. As he would later relate, &quot;So I called up Bart [Wasserman] and said, 'Bart, the film is a disaster. The camera was broken and what I've done hasn't turned out.' And he said, 'Don't worry, David, take the rest of the money and make something else for me. Just give me a print.' End of story.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lynch The Alphabet.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The opening title of ''The Alphabet'', Lynch's second short film, and the first to include live action elements.]] --&gt;

Using this leftover money, Lynch decided to experiment on making a work that was a mix of animation with [[live action]], producing a four minute short entitled ''[[The Short Films of David Lynch#The Alphabet|The Alphabet]]'' (1968). The film starred Lynch's wife Peggy as a character known as The Girl, who chants the [[alphabet]] to a series of images of horses before dying at the end by haemorrhaging blood all over her bed sheets. Adding a sound effect, Lynch used a broken [[Uher (brand)|Uher]] tape recorded to record the sound of his baby daughter Jennifer crying, creating a distorted sound that Lynch felt to be particularly effective. Later describing where he had got inspiration for this work from, Lynch stated that &quot;Peggy's niece was having a bad dream one night and was saying the alphabet in her sleep in a tormented way. So that's sort of what started ''The Alphabet'' going. The rest of it was just [[subconscious]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning about the newly founded [[American Film Institute]], which gave grants to film makers who could produce for them both a prior work and a script for a new project, Lynch decided to send them a copy of ''The Alphabet'' along with a script that he had written for a new short film, one that would be almost entirely live action, and which would be entitled ''[[The Short Films of David Lynch#The Grandmother|The Grandmother]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute agreed to help finance the work, initially offering him $5000, out of his requested budget of $7,200, but later granting him the further $2,200 which he needed. Starring people he knew from both work and college and filmed in his own house,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 44–47.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Grandmother'' revolved around the story of a neglected boy who &quot;grows&quot; a grandmother from a seed to care for him. The film critics Michelle Le Blanc and Colin Odell later remarked that &quot;this film is a true oddity but contains many of the themes and ideas that would filter into his later work, and shows a remarkable grasp of the medium&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Los Angeles and ''Eraserhead'': 1971–1979===
[[File:Eraserhead.jpg|thumb|right|The poster for ''Eraserhead'', featuring the film's protagonist, Henry ([[Jack Nance]]).]]
In 1971, Lynch moved with his wife and daughter to the city of [[Los Angeles]] in [[California]], where he began studying filmmaking at the [[AFI Conservatory]], a place that he would later describe as being &quot;completely chaotic and disorganized, which was great… you quickly learned that if you were going to get something done, you would have to do it yourself. They wanted to let people do their thing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; He began writing a script for a proposed work entitled ''Gardenback'', which had &quot;unfolded from this painting I'd done.&quot; In this venture he was supported by a number of figures at the Conservatory, who encouraged him to lengthen the script and add in more dialogue, something that he reluctantly agreed to do. Nonetheless, with all the interference on his ''Gardenback'' project, he became fed up with the Conservatory, and announced that he was quitting. Attempting to prevent this, many of the teachers at the centre asked him to reconsider, believing that he was one of their best students, and he finally agreed, albeit on the condition that he could create his own project that would not be interfered with. Feeling that ''Gardenback'' was &quot;wrecked&quot;, he instead set about on a new film, which he called ''[[Eraserhead]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that the film was planned to be about forty-two minutes long (it would end up being eighty-nine minutes long), the script for ''Eraserhead'' was only 21 pages long, and some of the teachers at the Conservatory were concerned that the film would not be a success with such little dialogue and action. Nonetheless, they agreed not to interfere as they had done with ''Gardenback'', and as such Lynch was able to create the film free from interference. Filming, which began in 1972, took place at night in some abandoned stables, allowing the production team, which was largely Lynch and some of his friends, including [[Sissy Spacek]], [[Jack Fisk]], cinematographer [[Frederick Elmes]] and sound designer [[Alan Splet]] to set up a camera room, green room, editing room, sets as well as a food room and a bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, funding for the project came from the [[American Film Institute|AFI]], who gave Lynch a $10,000 grant, but it was not enough to complete the work, and under pressure from studios after the success of the relatively cheap feature film ''[[Easy Rider]]'', they were unable to provide him with any more. Following this, Lynch was also supported by a loan given to him by his father, and by money that he was able to bring in from a [[paper round]] that he took up delivering the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 76 and 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long into the production of ''Eraserhead'', Lynch and his wife Peggy amicably separated and divorced, and so he began living full-time on set. In 1977, Lynch would remarry, this time to a woman named Mary Fisk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 60, 80, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Eraserhead Henry and baby.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Henry with his ill, deformed baby, from ''Eraserhead''.]] --&gt;

Filmed in [[black and white]], ''Eraserhead'' tells the story of a quiet young man named Henry ([[Jack Nance]]) living in a [[dystopia]]n industrial wasteland, whose girlfriend gives birth to a deformed baby whom she leaves in his care. The baby constantly cries, eventually leading to its accidental death, at which the world itself begins to fall apart. Lynch has consistently refused to either confirm or deny any interpretation of ''Eraserhead'', or to &quot;confess his own thinking behind the many abstractions in the film.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he admits that it was heavily influenced by the fearful mood of Philadelphia, and referred to the film as &quot;my ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|Philadelphia Story]]''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;cehwte&quot;&gt;[http://www.davidlynch.de/tiplynchtrans.html David Lynch interview 1985] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5msckwCb2|date =2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was due to the financial problems with the production of ''Eraserhead'' that filming was haphazard, regularly stopping and starting again. It was in one such break in 1974 that Lynch created a short film entitled ''The Amputee'', which revolved around a woman with two amputated legs (played by Jack Nance's wife, [[Catherine Coulson]]) reading aloud a letter and having her stumps washed by a doctor (played by Lynch himself).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Eraserhead'' was finally finished in 1976, after five years of production. Lynch subsequently tried to get the film entered into the [[Cannes Film Festival]], but whilst some reviewers liked it, others felt that it was awful, and so it was not selected for screening. Similarly, reviewers from the [[New York Film Festival]] also rejected it, but it was indeed screened at the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]], from where [[Ben Barenholtz]], the distributor of the [[Elgin Theater]], heard about it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; He was very supportive of the movie, helping to distribute it around the United States in 1977, and ''Eraserhead'' subsequently became popular on the [[midnight movie]] underground circuit,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; and was later described as one of the most important midnight movies of the seventies along with ''[[El Topo]]'', ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', ''[[The Harder They Come]]'' and ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=457414|title=Midnight Movies: From the Margin to the Mainstream}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acclaimed film maker [[Stanley Kubrick]] said that it was one of his all-time favorite films.&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch77&quot;&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Elephant Man'' and mainstream success: 1980–1982===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lynch Elephant Man.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scene from ''The Elephant Man'' in which sideshow owner Bytes ([[Freddie Jones]]), attempts to kidnap the deformed [[Joseph Merrick|John Merrick]] ([[John Hurt]]).]] --&gt;
The cult success of ''Eraserhead'' on the underground circuit led to it being seen by [[Stuart Cornfeld]], an executive producer to the producer [[Mel Brooks]], who later remarked that &quot;I was just 100 per cent blown away… I thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever seen. It was such a cleansing experience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Contacting Lynch, he agreed to help him with his next planned project, a film entitled ''Ronnie Rocket'' for which Lynch had already written a script. Nonetheless, Lynch soon realized that ''Ronnie Rocket'', a film that he described as being about &quot;electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair&quot;, was not going to be picked up by any financiers, and so he asked Cornfeld to find him a script written by someone else which he could direct. Cornfeld went away and found him four possible scripts, but upon hearing the title of the first, ''The Elephant Man'', Lynch was already sure that that was the script for him, going on nothing but the title.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Elephant Man'' script – written by Chris de Vore and Eric Bergren – was based upon a true story, that of [[Joseph Merrick]], a heavily deformed man living in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London, who was held in a sideshow but was later taken under the care of a London surgeon, [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]]. Lynch wanted to film it, but at the same time also had to make some alterations that would alter the story from true events, but in his view make a better plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in order to do so he would have to get the permission of [[Mel Brooks]], whose company, BrookFilms, would be responsible for production; subsequently Brooks viewed ''Eraserhead'', and after coming out of the screening theatre, embraced Lynch, declaring that &quot;You're a madman, I love you! You're in.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting film, ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'', starred [[John Hurt]] as John Merrick (his name was changed from Joseph), as well as [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Frederick Treves. Filming took place in London, and Lynch brought his own distinctively surrealist approach to the film, filming it in color stock black and white, but nonetheless it has been described as &quot;one of the most conventional&quot; of his films.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Elephant Man'' was a huge critical and commercial success, and earned eight [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Best Adapted Screenplay]] nods for Lynch.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The De Laurentiis films, ''Dune'' and ''Blue Velvet'': 1983–1986===
Following on from the success of ''The Elephant Man'', the film maker [[George Lucas]], himself a fan of ''Eraserhead'', offered Lynch the opportunity to direct the third film in his ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy, ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]''. Lynch however refused, arguing that Lucas should direct the film himself as the movie should reflect his own vision, not Lynch's take on it.&lt;ref name = &quot;cehwte&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch113&quot;&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after however, the opportunity to direct another big-budget [[science fiction]] epic arose when [[Dino de Laurentiis]] of the [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]] asked him to create a film adaptation of [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[science fiction]] [[novel]] ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (1965).&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch113&quot;/&gt; Lynch agreed, and in doing so was also contractually obliged to produce two other works for the company. He then set about writing a script based upon the original novel, initially with both Chris de Vore and Eric Bergren, and then just by himself when De Laurentiis wasn't happy with their ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch115&quot;&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch also helped build some of the sets, attempting to create &quot;a certain look&quot; for the film, and he particularly enjoyed building the set for the [[oil]] planet of [[Giedi Prime]], for which he &quot;used steel, bolts, and porcelain to construct&quot; it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Frank Booth and Dorothy.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The psychopath Frank Booth ([[Dennis Hopper]]) and his hostage, Dorothy Vallens ([[Isabella Rossellini]]) from ''Blue Velvet''.]] --&gt;

''Dune'' is set in the far future, when humans live in an interstellar empire run along a [[feudalism|feudal system]]. The main character, [[Paul Atreides]] (played by [[Kyle MacLachlan]]), is the son of a noble who takes control of the [[desert planet]] [[Arrakis]] which grows the rare spice [[melange (fictional drug)|melange]], the most highly prized commodity in the empire. Lynch however was unhappy with the work, later remarking that &quot;''Dune'' was a kind of studio film. I didn’t have [[final cut privilege|final cut]]. And, little by little, I was subconsciously making compromises&quot; to his own vision.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; He produced much footage for the film that was eventually removed out from the final theatrical cut, dramatically condensing the plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt; Although De Laurentiis hoped it would be as successful as ''Star Wars'', Lynch's ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'' (1984) was a critical and commercial dud; it had cost $45 million to make, and grossed a mere $27.4 million domestically. Later on, [[Universal Studios]] released an &quot;extended cut&quot; of the film for syndicated television, containing almost an hour of cutting-room-floor footage and new narration. Such was not representative of Lynch's intentions, but the studio considered it more comprehensible than the original two-hour version. Lynch objected to these changes and had his name struck from the extended cut, which has &quot;[[Alan Smithee]]&quot; credited as the director and &quot;Judas Booth&quot; (a pseudonym which Lynch himself invented, inspired by his own feelings of betrayal) as the screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=l5JwyKjpH2QC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41 |title=The cinema of David Lynch: American dreams, nightmare visions |author1=Erica Sheen |author2=Annette Davison |publisher=Wallflower Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-903364-85-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile in 1983 he had begun the writing and drawing of a comic strip, ''[[The Angriest Dog in the World]]'', which featured unchanging graphics of a tethered dog that was so angry that it could not move, alongside cryptic philosophical references. It ran from 1983 until 1992 in the ''[[Village Voice]]'', ''[[Creative Loafing]]'' and other tabloid and alternative publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; It was around this period that Lynch also got increasingly interested in [[photography]] as an art form, and travelled to northern England to take photos of the degrading industrial landscape, something that he was particularly interested in.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 109–111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:87lynch.jpg|thumb|right|260px|David Lynch on the set of ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' with the film's main actor [[Kyle MacLachlan]]. MacLachlan also appeared as the protagonist in Lynch's ''Dune'' and ''Twin Peaks''.]] --&gt;

Following on from ''Dune'', Lynch was contractually still obliged to produce two other projects for De Laurentiis: the first of these was a planned sequel, which due to the film's lack of success never went beyond the script stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch115&quot;/&gt; The other was a more personal work, based upon a script that Lynch had been working on for some time. Developing from ideas that Lynch had had since 1973, the resulting film, ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'', was set in the fictional town of Lumberton, USA, and revolves around a college student named Jeffrey Beaumont ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), who finds a severed ear in a field. Subsequently investigating further with the help of friend Sandy ([[Laura Dern]]), he uncovers that it is related to a criminal gang led by psychopath [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] ([[Dennis Hopper]]), who has kidnapped the husband and child of singer Dorothy Vallens ([[Isabella Rossellini]]) and repeatedly subjects her to [[rape]]. Lynch himself characterizes the story as &quot;a dream of strange desires wrapped inside a mystery story.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the film, Lynch decided to include pop songs from the 1950s, including &quot;[[In Dreams (song)|In Dreams]]&quot; by [[Roy Orbison]] and &quot;[[Blue Velvet (song)|Blue Velvet]]&quot; by [[Bobby Vinton]], the latter of which was largely inspirational for the film, with Lynch stating that &quot;It was the song that sparked the movie… There was something mysterious about it. It made me think about things. And the first things I thought about were [[lawn]]s – lawns and the neighbourhood.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Other music for the film was also produced, this time composed by [[Angelo Badalamenti]], who would go on to produce the music for most of Lynch’s subsequent cinematic works.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 130–132.&lt;/ref&gt; Dino de Laurentiis loved the film, and it achieved support from some of the early specialist screenings, but the preview screenings to a mainstream audience were instead highly negative, with most of the audience hating the film.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 148–149.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lynch had found success previously with ''The Elephant Man'', ''Blue Velvet'''s controversy with audiences and critics introduced him into the mainstream, and became a huge critical and moderate commercial success. The film earned Lynch his second [[Academy Award for Best Director|Academy Award nomination for Best Director]]. [[Woody Allen]], whose film ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' was nominated for [[Best Picture]], said that ''Blue Velvet'' was his favorite film of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peary&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Cult Movies 3 | first = Danny | last = Peary | year = 1988 | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. | location = New York | pages = 38–42 | isbn = 0–671–64810–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Twin Peaks'', ''Wild at Heart'' and ''Fire Walk With Me'': 1987–1996===
During the late 1980s, Lynch had begun to work in [[television]] as well as cinema, directing a short piece entitled ''The Cowboy and the Frenchman'' for French television in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, he met the television producer [[Mark Frost]], who had formerly worked on such projects as the television police series ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', and they decided to start working together on a biopic of singer and actress [[Marilyn Monroe]] based upon Anthony Summers's book, ''The Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe''. Whilst this project never got off the ground, the duo went on to work on a comedy script entitled ''One Saliva Bubble'', but that did not see completion either.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; It was whilst they were talking in a coffee shop that Lynch and Frost both had the idea of a corpse washing up on the shore of a lake, and using this image as a basis subsequently set about on their third project, which they initially named ''Northwest Passage'' but which would eventually come to fruition as the television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' (1990–1991).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;
A drama series set in a small [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] town where popular high school student [[Laura Palmer]] has been raped and murdered, ''Twin Peaks'' featured [[FBI]] [[Dale Cooper|Special Agent Dale Cooper]] ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]) as the investigator trying to unearth the killer, and discovering not only the [[supernatural]] elements to the murder but also the secrets of many of the local townsfolk – as Lynch himself summed it up, &quot;The project was to mix a police investigation with the ordinary lives of the characters.&quot; In plotting out the series, Lynch later related that &quot;[Mark Frost and I] worked together, especially in the initial stages. Later on we started working more apart.&quot; They subsequently pitched the series to the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Network]], who agreed to finance the [[Television pilot|pilot episode]], and once this was completed they also commissioned the first season, which comprised seven episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 157–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second season went into production soon after, which would last for a further 22 episodes. In all, Lynch himself only directed six episodes out of the whole series due to other responsibilities, namely his work on the film ''Wild at Heart'' (see below), but carefully chose those other directors whom he entrusted with the job.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Lynch also appeared in several episodes of the series, acting in the role of deaf FBI agent [[Gordon Cole]]. The series was a success, with high viewing figures both in the United States and in many nations abroad, and soon spawned a cult following. Nonetheless, the executives at the ABC Network, believing that public interest in the show was decreasing, insisted that Lynch and Frost reveal who the killer of Laura Palmer was prematurely, something that they only begrudgingly agreed to do,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lynch has always felt that agreeing to do so is one of his biggest professional regrets.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Slice of Lynch&quot;, a featurette included in the ''Twin Peaks Definitive Gold Box Edition&quot; DVD set, October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the revealing of the murderer and the series' move from Thursday to Saturday night on the ABC Network, ''Twin Peaks'' continued on for several more episodes, but following a ratings drop was cancelled. Lynch, who disliked the direction that the writers and directors had taken in the previous few episodes, chose to direct the final episode, which he ended on a [[cliffhanger]], later stating that &quot;that's not the ending. That's the ending that people were stuck with.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''Twin Peaks'' was in production, the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] asked Lynch and the composer [[Angelo Badalamenti]], who had been responsible for the music in ''Twin Peaks'', to create a theatrical piece which would only be performed twice at their academy in New York City in 1989 as a part of the [[New Music America Festival]]. The result was ''[[Industrial Symphony No. 1]]: The Dream of the Broken Hearted'', which starred such frequent Lynch collaborators as [[Laura Dern]], [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Michael J. Anderson]] as well as containing five songs sung by [[Julee Cruise]]. David Lynch produced a fifty-minute video of the performance in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Lynch was also involved in the creation of various [[commercials]] for different companies, including perfume companies like [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Calvin Klein]] and [[Giorgio Armani]] and for the Japanese coffee company [[Namoi]], the latter of which involved a Japanese man searching the town of Twin Peaks for his missing wife.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 211–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=right|quote=&quot;
1990 was Lynch's annus mirabilis: ''Wild at Heart'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] at [[Cannes]], and the television series ''Twin Peaks'' was proving a smash hit with audiences across the world. The musical/performance piece ''Industrial Symphony No. 1'', which Lynch had staged with Angelo Badalamenti at the Brooklyn Academy of music, had spawned the album ''Floating into the Night'' and launched singer [[Julee Cruise]]. Five one-man exhibitions between 1989 and 1991 emphasized Lynch’s roots in fine art and painting, and a rash of ads (including a teaser trailer for [[Michael Jackson]]'s 'Dangerous' tour) confirmed the demand for the Lynch touch… In an unlikely scenario for the maker of ''Eraserhead'', Lynch had become an influential and fashionable brand name.&quot;|source=Christopher Rodley&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Whilst still working on the first few episodes of ''Twin Peaks'', Lynch's friend, [[Monty Montgomery]] &quot;gave me a book that he wanted to direct as a movie. He asked if I would maybe be [[executive producer]] or something, and I said 'That's great, Monty, but what if I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?' And he said, 'In that case, you can do it yourself'.&quot; The book was [[Barry Gifford]]'s novel ''Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula'', which told the tale of two lovers on a road trip, and Lynch felt that it was &quot;just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; With Gifford's support, Lynch set about to adapt the novel into a film, with the result being ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'', a [[crime fiction|crime]] and [[road movie]] starring [[Nicolas Cage]] as Sailor and [[Laura Dern]] as Lula. Describing his plot as a &quot;strange blend&quot; of &quot;a road picture, a love story, a psychological drama and a violent comedy&quot;, he altered much from the original novel, changing the ending, and incorporating numerous references to the classic film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 193–194, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite receiving a muted response from American critics and viewers, it won the prestigious [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1990 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cannes-1990.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/164/year/1990.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Wild at Heart |accessdate=2009-08-07|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following on from the success of ''Wild at Heart'', Lynch decided to return to the world of the now-cancelled ''Twin Peaks'', this time without Mark Frost, to create a film that acted primarily as a prequel but also, in part, as a sequel, with Lynch stating that &quot;I liked the idea of the story going back and forth in time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The result, ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me]]'' (1992), primarily revolved around the last few days in the life of Laura Palmer, and was much &quot;darker&quot; in tone than the television series, having much of the humour removed, and dealing with such topics as [[incest]] and [[murder]]. Lynch himself stated that the film was about &quot;the loneliness, shame, guilt, confusion and devestation of the victim of incest.&quot; ''Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me'' was financed by the company CIBY-2000, and most of the cast of the series agreed to reprise their roles for the film, although some refused, and many were not enthusiastic about the project.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 184–187.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was, for the most part, a commercial and critical failure in the United States; however, it was a hit in Japan and British critic [[Mark Kermode]] (among others) has hailed it as Lynch's &quot;masterpiece&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kermode, Mark&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Kermode | first = Mark | coauthors = | title = David Lynch | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = February 8, 2007 | url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2011369,00.html | accessdate = October 27, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Lynch continued working on a series of television shows with Mark Frost. After ''Twin Peaks'', they produced a series of documentaries entitled ''[[American Chronicles]]'' (1990) which examined life across the United States, the comedy series ''[[On the Air (TV series)|On the Air]]'' (1992), which was cancelled after only three episodes had aired, and the three-episode [[HBO]] [[mini-series]] ''[[Hotel Room]]'' (1993) about events that happened in the same hotel room but at different dates in time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 82–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Lost Highway'', ''The Straight Story'' and ''Mulholland Drive'': 1997–2001===
Following his unsuccessful television ventures since ''Twin Peaks'', Lynch returned to making feature films. In 1997 he released the non-linear, [[film noir|noiresque]] ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'', co-written by Barry Gifford and starring [[Bill Pullman]] and [[Patricia Arquette]]. The film failed commercially and received a mixed response from critics. However, thanks in part to a soundtrack featuring [[David Bowie]], [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[Rammstein]], [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], it helped gain Lynch a new audience of [[Generation X]] viewers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Following ''Lost Highway'', Lynch went on to work on directing a film from a script written by [[Mary Sweeney]] and [[John E. Roach]]. The resulting motion picture, ''[[The Straight Story]]'', was, like ''The Elephant Man'' before it, based upon a true story, that of Alvin Straight (played in the film by [[Richard Farnsworth]]), an elderly man from [[Laurens, Iowa|Laurens]], [[Iowa]], who goes on three hundred mile journey to visit his sick brother (played by [[Harry Dean Stanton]]) in [[Mount Zion]], [[Wisconsin]], riding the whole way there upon an electric [[lawnmower]]. Commenting on why he chose this script, Lynch would simply relate that &quot;that's what I fell in love with next&quot;, and displayed his admiration for Straight, describing him as being &quot;like [[James Dean]], except he's old.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 247, 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Once more, [[Angelo Badalamenti]] produced the music for the film, although he created instrumentation that was &quot;very different from the kind of score he's done for [Lynch] in the past.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;PAGE 260&lt;/ref&gt; Having many differences with most of his work, particularly in that it did not contain any profanities, sexual content or violence, ''The Straight Story'' was rated G (general viewing) by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], and as such came as &quot;shocking news&quot; to many in the film industry, who were surprised that it &quot;did not disturb, offend or mystify.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch245&quot;/&gt; As Le Blanc and Odell stated, the plot made it &quot;seem as far removed from Lynch's earlier works as could be imagined, but in fact right from the very opening, this is entirely his film – a surreal road movie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Lynch approached [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] once again with ideas for a television [[drama]]. The network gave Lynch the go-ahead to shoot a two-hour pilot for the series ''Mulholland Drive'', but disputes over content and running time led to the project being shelved indefinitely. However, with seven million dollars from the French [[production company]] [[StudioCanal]], Lynch completed the pilot as a film, ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''. The film, a non-linear narrative surrealist tale of the dark side of [[Hollywood]], stars [[Naomi Watts]], [[Laura Harring]] and [[Justin Theroux]]. The film performed relatively well at the [[box office]] worldwide and was a critical success, earning Lynch a [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director]] prize at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]] (shared with [[Joel Coen]] for ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There]]'') and a Best Director award from the [[New York Film Critics Association]]. In addition, Lynch also received his third Academy Award nomination for Best Director.&lt;ref name=&quot;oscar-db&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Academy Award Database: Lynch, David|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=13035139382341|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet work and ''Inland Empire'': 2002–present ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Rabbits in Inland Empire.jpg|thumb|300px|A scene from ''Rabbits'', which Lynch later made use of in ''Inland Empire''.]] --&gt;
With the onset of popularity of the [[internet]], Lynch decided to utlilize this new medium, releasing several new series that he had created exclusively on his website, davidlynch.com. In 2002, he created a series of online shorts entitled ''[[Dumbland]]''. Intentionally crude both in content and execution, the eight-episode series was later released on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/view.php?id=11325 Film – DVDs – It's Just Lynch – philadelphia weekly online]&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Lynch released a surreal [[sitcom]] via his website – ''[[Rabbits (film)|Rabbits]]'', which revolved around a family of humanoid rabbits. Later, he showed his experiments with [[DV|Digital Video]] in the form of the Japanese-style horror short ''[[Darkened Room]]''.

In 2006, Lynch's latest feature film, ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' was released. At almost three hours, it was the longest of Lynch's films. Like ''Mulholland Drive'' and ''Lost Highway'' before it, the film did not follow a traditional narrative structure. It starred Lynch regulars [[Laura Dern]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]], and [[Justin Theroux]], with cameos by [[Naomi Watts]] and Laura Harring (voices of Suzie and Jane Rabbit), and a performance by [[Jeremy Irons]]. Lynch described the piece as &quot;a mystery about a woman in trouble&quot;. In an effort to promote the film, Lynch made appearances with a cow and a placard bearing the slogan &quot;Without cheese there would be no ''Inland Empire''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-02-07/entertainment/17233482_1_inland-empire-bird-feeders-squirrels |title=Lynch dives within |author=Neva Chonin |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 7, 2007 |accessdate=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Lynch produced a documentary web series directed by his son, Austin Lynch and friend Jason S. called Interview Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = | first = | url=http://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/05/david-lynchs-interview-project-probes-american-dreams/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:GustheBartender.png|thumb|left|200px|The character of Gus the bartender from ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' is both based on and voiced by Lynch.]] --&gt;

Lynch currently has two films in production, both of which differ in content from his previous work. One of these is an animation entitled ''Snootworld'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104816/ {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other is a documentary on [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] consisting of interviews with people who knew him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = | first = | url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report_david-lynch-to-shoot-film-about-tm-guru-maharishi-mahesh-yogi-in-india_1313317|title=David Lynch to shoot film about TM guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in India |publisher=Daily News &amp; Analysis |date=18 November 2009 | accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Lynch began making guest appearances on the ''[[Family Guy]]'' spin-off, ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' as Gus the Bartender. He had been convinced to appear in the show by its lead actor, [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]], who is a fan of Lynch's and who felt that his whole life had changed after seeing ''Wild at Heart''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Faye | first = Denis | url=http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=3802 |title=A Kinder, Gentler Family Guy |publisher=Writers Guild of America, West |accessdate= 29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Lady Blue Shanghai]]'', written, directed and edited by Lynch, is a 16-minute promotional film made for [[Dior]] and released on the Internet in May 2010.

Lynch directed a concert by English [[New Wave music|New Wave]] band [[Duran Duran]] on March 23, 2011. The concert was [[Streaming media|streamed live]] on YouTube from the [[Mayan Theater]] in Los Angeles as the kickoff to the second season of “Unstaged: An Original Series from American Express.&quot; The idea is to try and create on the fly, layers of images permeating Duran Duran on the stage,&quot; Lynch said. &quot;A world of experimentation and hopefully some happy accidents.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Lewis | first = Dave | url=http://www.hitfix.com/articles/duran-duran-david-lynch-team-for-unstaged-streaming-concert |title=Watch: David Lynch, Duran Duran team for 'Unstaged' streaming concert |publisher=www.HitFix.com |accessdate= 22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinematic influences and themes==
===Influences===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=right|quote=&quot;I look at the world and I see absurdity all around me. People do strange things constantly, to the point that, for the most part, we manage not to see it. That's why I love coffee shops and public places – I mean, they're all out there.&quot;|source=David Lynch&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Lynch admits that his work is more similar in many respects to those of European film makers than American ones, believing that most films that &quot;get down and thrill your soul&quot; were by European directors.&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch62&quot;&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch has commented on his admiration for such film makers as [[Stanley Kubrick]],&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch77&quot;/&gt; [[Federico Fellini]],&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch62&quot;/&gt; [[Werner Herzog]]&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch62&quot;/&gt; and [[Jacques Tati]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch62&quot;/&gt; He has also stated that [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950) is one of his favourite films,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; as is Kubrick's ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recurring motifs===
There are several recurring themes within Lynch's work, leading film critics Le Blanc and Odell to state that &quot;his films are so packed with motifs, recurrent characters, images, compositions and techniques that you could view his entire output as one large jigsaw puzzle of ideas&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 08.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key themes that they noted was the usage of dreams and dreamlike imagery within his works, something they related to the &quot;[[surrealist]] ethos&quot; of relying &quot;on the [[subconscious]] to provide visual drive&quot;. This can be seen in [[Joseph Merrick|John Merrick]]'s dream of his mother in ''The Elephant Man'', [[Dale Cooper|Agent Cooper]]'s dreams of the red room in ''Twin Peaks'' and the &quot;dreamlike logic&quot; of the narrative found in ''Eraserhead'', ''Mulholland Drive'' and ''Inland Empire''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing his attitude to dreams, Lynch has stated that &quot;Waking dreams are the ones that are important, the ones that come when I'm quietly sitting in a chair, letting my mind wander. When you sleep, you don't control your dream. I like to dive into a dream world that I've made or discovered; a world I choose… [You can't really get others to experience it, but] right there is the power of cinema.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Lynch's prominent themes include [[industry]], with repeated imagery of &quot;the clunk of machinery, the power of pistons, shadows of oil drills pumping, screaming woodmills and smoke billowing factories&quot;, as can be seen with the industrial wasteland in ''Eraserhead'', the factories in ''The Elephant Man'', the sawmill in ''Twin Peaks'' and the lawn mower in ''The Straight Story''.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated9&quot;&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing his interest in such things, Lynch stated that &quot;It makes me feel good to see giant machinery, you know, working: dealing with molten metal. And I like fire and smoke. And the sounds are so powerful. It's just big stuff. It means that things are being made, and I really like that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theme is the idea of a &quot;dark underbelly&quot; of violent criminal activity within a society, such as with Frank's gang in ''Blue Velvet'' and the cocaine smugglers in ''Twin Peaks''. The idea of [[deformity]] is also found in several of Lynch's films, from the protagonist in ''The Elephant Man'', to the deformed baby in ''Eraserhead'', as is the idea of death from a head wound, found in most of Lynch's films. Other imagery commonly used within Lynch's works are flickering electrictity or lights, as well as fire and the idea of a stage upon which a singer performs, often surrounded by drapery.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated9&quot;/&gt;

With the exception of ''The Elephant Man'' and ''Dune'', which are set in [[Victorian London]] and a fictitious galaxy respectively, all of Lynch's films have been set in the [[United States]], and he has stated that &quot;I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I go around and I see things, it sparks little stories, or little characters pop out, so it just feels right to me to, you know, make American films.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of his works, including ''Blue Velvet'', ''Twin Peaks'' and ''Lost Highway'' are intentionally reminiscent of the 1950s American culture even though they were set in the later decades of the 20th century. Lynch later commented on his feelings for this decade, which was that in which he grew up as a child, by stating that &quot;It was a fantastic decade in a lot of ways… there was something in the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything. The future was bright. Little did we know we were laying the groundwork then for a disastrous future.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch also tends to feature his leading female actors in multiple or &quot;split&quot; roles, so that many of his female characters have multiple, fractured identities. This practice began with his choice to cast [[Sheryl Lee]] as both [[Laura Palmer]] and her cousin [[Maddy Ferguson]] in ''Twin Peaks'' and continued in his later works. In ''Lost Highway'', [[Patricia Arquette]] plays the dual role of Renee Madison/Alice Wakefield, while in ''Mulholland Drive'', [[Naomi Watts]] plays Diane Selwyn/Betty Elms and Laura Harring plays Camilla Rhodes/Rita and in ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'', [[Laura Dern]] plays Nikki Grace/Susan Blue. By contrast, Lynch rarely creates multi-character roles for his male actors.

===Recurring collaborators===
{{Main|Frequent David Lynch collaborators}}
Lynch is also widely noted for his collaborations with various production artists and composers on his films and multiple different productions. He frequently works with [[Angelo Badalamenti]] to compose music for his productions, former wife [[Mary Sweeney]] as a film editor, casting director [[Johanna Ray]], and cast members [[Harry Dean Stanton]], [[Jack Nance]], [[Kyle MacLachlan]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Isabella Rossellini]], [[Grace Zabriskie]], and [[Laura Dern]].

==Other art==
===Painting===
[[File:Lynch's So This is Love painting.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Lynch's painting ''So This Is Love'', 1992.]]
Lynch first trained as a painter, and although he is now better known as a filmmaker, he has also produced much painting work. Lynch has stated that &quot;all my paintings are organic, violent comedies. They have to be violently done and primitive and crude, and to achieve that I try to let [[nature]] paint more than I paint.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch22&quot;&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his works are very dark in colour, and Lynch has described this as being because &quot;I wouldn't know what to do with [colour]. Colour to me is too real. It's limiting. It doesn't allow too much of a dream. The more you throw black into a colour, the more dreamy it gets… Black has depth. It's like a little egress; you can go into it, and because it keeps on continuing to be dark, the mind kicks in, and a lot of things that are going on in there become manifest. And you start seeing what you're afraid of. You start seeing what you love, and it becomes like a dream.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his works also contain letters and words added to the painting, something which he explains: &quot;The words in the paintings are sometimes important to make you start thinking about what else is going on in there. And a lot of times, the words excite me as shapes, and something'll grow out of that. I used to cut these little letters out and glue them on. They just look good all lined up like teeth... sometimes they become the title of the painting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch22&quot;/&gt;

Lynch considers the Anglo-Irish 20th century artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] to be his &quot;number one kinda hero painter&quot;, stating that &quot;Normally I only like a couple of years of a painter's work, but I like everything of Bacon's. The guy, you know, had the stuff.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch was the subject of a major art retrospective at the [[Fondation Cartier]], Paris from March May 3–27, 2007. The show was entitled ''The Air is on Fire'' and included numerous paintings, photographs, drawings, alternative films and sound work. New site-specific art [[Installation art|installations]] were created specially for the exhibition. A series of events accompanied the exhibition including live performances and concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6412525.stm | work=BBC News | title=David Lynch's dark arts laid bare | date=March 2, 2007 | accessdate=May 1, 2010 | first=Caroline | last=Wyatt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of Lynch's art include photographs of dissected chickens and other animals as a &quot;Build your own Chicken&quot; toy ad.

Between 1983 and 1992, Lynch wrote and drew a weekly [[comic strip]] called ''[[The Angriest Dog in the World]]'' for the ''L.A. Reader''. The drawings in the panels never change, just the captions.

===Music===
Lynch has also been involved in a number of music projects, many of them related to his films. Most notably he produced and wrote lyrics for [[Julee Cruise]]'s first two albums, ''[[Floating into the Night]]'' (1989) and ''[[The Voice of Love]]'' (1993), in collaboration with [[Angelo Badalamenti]] who composed the music and also produced. Lynch has also worked on the 1998 [[Jocelyn Montgomery]] album [[Lux Vivens]]. He has also composed bits of music for ''Wild at Heart'', ''Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me'', ''Mulholland Drive'', and ''Rabbits''. In 2001, he released ''[[BlueBob]]'', a rock album performed by Lynch and John Neff. The album is notable for Lynch's unusual guitar playing style: he plays &quot;upside down and backwards, like a lap guitar&quot;, and relies heavily on effects pedals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lynchnet.com/articles/bug.html&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently Lynch has composed several pieces for ''Inland Empire'', including two songs, &quot;Ghost of Love&quot; and &quot;Walkin' on the Sky&quot;, in which he makes his public debut as a singer. In 2009, his new book-CD set [[Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse Present: Dark Night of the Soul|Dark Night of the Soul]] was released. In 2008, he started his own record label called [[David Lynch MC]] on which its first release ''Fox Bat Strategy: A Tribute to Dave Jaurequi'' was released in early 2009. In August 2009, it was announced that he was releasing Afghani/American singer [[Ariana Delawari]]'s ''Lion of Panjshir'' album in conjunction with [[Manimal Vinyl]] Records in October 2009.

In November 2010, Lynch released two [[electro pop]] music singles, &quot;Good Day Today&quot; and &quot;I Know&quot;, through the independent British label Sunday Best Recordings. Describing why he created them, he stated that &quot;I was just sitting and these notes came and then I went down and started working with Dean [Hurley, his engineer] and then these few notes, 'I want to have a good day, today' came and the song was built around that&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Topping | first = Alexandra|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/nov/28/david-lynch-turns-pop-singer-songwriter?intcmp=239 |title=The latest offbeat experiment from filmmaker David Lynch: pop singles |publisher=The Guardian |date=28 November 2010 | accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Lynch has had several long-term relationships. In 1967, he married Peggy Lentz in Chicago, [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peggyreavey.com Peggy Reavey Portfolio - The Truth, Portraits, Domestic , Mysticartoons, Mixed media., Words]&lt;/ref&gt; They had one child, [[Jennifer Chambers Lynch]], born in 1968, who is a film director. They filed for divorce in 1974. On June 21, 1977, Lynch married Mary Fisk, and the couple had one child, Austin Jack Lynch, born in 1982. They divorced in 1987, and Lynch began dating [[Isabella Rossellini]] after filming ''Blue Velvet''. Lynch and Rossellini broke up in 1991, and Lynch developed a relationship with [[Mary Sweeney]], with whom he had one son, Riley Lynch, in 1992. Sweeney also worked as Lynch's longtime film editor/producer and co-wrote and produced ''[[The Straight Story]]''. The two married in May 2006, but divorced that July. Lynch married actress Emily Stofle, who appeared in his 2006 film ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'', in February, 2009.

Politically, Lynch has stated that he admired former president [[Ronald Reagan]]. He was drawn to Reagan for  his &quot;cowboy&quot; image and belief in personal freedom. However, Lynch endorsed the [[Natural Law Party (United States)|Natural Law Party]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]] and has said that he's &quot;not a political person&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9dTCkwmvEyIC |title=David Lynch: Interviews |first=Richard A. |last=Barney |year=2009 |publisher=''[[University Press of Mississippi]]'' |ISBN=9781604732368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcendental Meditation===

Lynch advocates the use of meditation techniques in bringing peace to the world. He was first initiated into [[Transcendental Meditation]] in July 1973, and has practiced the technique consistently since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='The pleasure of life grows'|first=David|last=Lynch|date=July 3, 2008|work=The Guardian|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/jul/03/healthandwellbeing.davidlynch | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WP-12-01-2005&quot;&gt;William Booth, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/01/AR2005120101798.html &quot;Yogi Bearer: Dark Films Aside, David Lynch Brims With the Light of Transcendental Meditation&quot;], ''Washington Post'', December 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch says he met [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]], the founder of the [[Transcendental Meditation movement|TM movement]], for the first time in 1975 at the [[Spiritual Regeneration Movement]] center in Los Angeles, [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;The Washington Post, [http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/undergod/2008/02/david_lynch_talks_about_the_de.html David Lynch’s Guru and His Art], Claire Hoffman, February 7, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last =Kress | first =Michael | url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Entertainment/Celebrities/David-Lynchs-Peace-Plan.aspx|title=David Lynch’s Peace Plan |publisher=BeliefNet |date= | accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly became close with Maharishi during a month-long &quot;Millionaire's Enlightenment Course&quot; held in 2003, the fee for which was {{US$}}1 million.&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite news|title=And now children, it's time for your yogic flying lesson|first1=Jacqueline|last1=Stevens|first2=Patrick|last2=Barkham|work=The Guardian|date=January 27, 2009|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/jan/27/david-lynch-meditation | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2005, he launched the [[David Lynch Foundation|David Lynch Foundation For Consciousness-Based Education and Peace]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-12-31-06&quot;&gt;Alex Williams, &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/fashion/31lynch.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/L/Lynch,%20David David Lynch's Shockingly Peaceful Inner Life]&quot;, ''New York Times'', December 31, 2006, section 9, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidlynchfoundation.com David Lynch Foundation For Consciousness-Based Education]&lt;/ref&gt; established to help finance scholarships for students in middle and high schools who are interested in learning the Transcendental Meditation technique and to fund research on the technique and its effects on learning.

Lynch is working for the building and establishment of seven buildings, in which 8,000 salaried people will practice advanced meditation techniques, &quot;pumping peace for the world&quot;. He estimates the cost at $7 billion. As of December 2005, he had spent $400,000 of personal money, and raised $1 million in donations.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP-12-01-2005&quot; /&gt; In December 2006, the ''New York Times'' reported that he continued to have that goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-12-31-06&quot; /&gt;

Lynch's book, ''[[Catching the Big Fish]]'' (Tarcher/Penguin 2006), discusses the impact of the Transcendental Meditation technique on his creative process. He is donating all author's royalties to the David Lynch Foundation.

Lynch attended the funeral of the Maharishi in India in 2008.&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt; He told a reporter, &quot;In life, he revolutionised the lives of millions of people. ... In 20, 50, 500 years there will be millions of people who will know and understand what the Maharishi has done.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=West meets East on guru Mahesh Yogi's funeral pyre|date=February 11, 2008|first=Krittivas|last=Mukherjee |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2008/02/11/idINIndia-31875220080211 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he went to India to film interviews with people who knew the Maharishi as part of a biographical documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=David Lynch to shoot film about TM guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in India|date=November 18, 2009|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/entertainment/david-lynch-to-shoot-film-about-tm-guru-maharishi-mahesh-yogi-in-india_100276506.html|work=Thaindian News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nme.com/news/the-beatles/48442 David Lynch to Make Film About the Beatles Guru] Nov 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Lynch organized a benefit concert at Radio City Music Hall for the David Lynch Foundation. On April 4, 2009, the &quot;Change Begins Within&quot; concert featured [[Paul McCartney]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Donovan]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Moby]], [[Bettye LaVette]], [[Ben Harper]], and [[Mike Love]] of the Beach Boys.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-04-04-09&quot;&gt;Jon Pareles, &quot;[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/paul-mccartney-ringo-starr-reunite-at-radio-city Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr Reunite at Radio City]&quot;, ''New York Times'', April 4, 2009, Arts Section&lt;/ref&gt;

''David Wants to Fly'', released in May 2010, is a documentary by German filmmaker [[David Sieveking]] &quot;that follows the path of his professional idol, David Lynch, into the world of Transcendental Meditation (TM).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://german-documentaries.de/media/pdf/german-documentaries_10.pdf ''German Documentaries'', AGDF, March 2010.“The young filmmaker David Sieveking follows the path of his professional idol, David Lynch, into the world of Transcendental Meditation (TM).”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Variety, David Wants to Fly Review, Alissa Simon Feb 14 2010 [http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117942181.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2562 Variety Reviews - David Wants to Fly - Film Reviews - Berlin - Review by Alissa Simon]&quot;&quot;David Wants to Fly&quot; follows German writer-helmer David Sieveking on his road to enlightenment, a journey that involves David Lynch, various headquarters of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) movement and the icy source of the Ganges.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent project starring Lynch is called ''Beyond The Noise: My Transcendental Meditation Journey.'' It is directed by young film student Dana Farley, who has severe Dyslexia and Attention deficit disorder. Farley started Transcendental Meditation when she was 16 and it enabled her to overcome the stresses of getting through her last years of high school and into college. Filmmaker [[Kevin Sean Michaels]] is one of the producers and the film will be at film festivals in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://dlf.tv/2010/beyond-the-noise/ | work=David Lynch Foundation | title=Beyond The Noise | date=August 24, 2010 | accessdate=August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Website===
Lynch designed his personal website, a site exclusive to paying members, where he posts short videos and his [[absurdism|absurdist]] series ''[[Dumbland]]'', plus interviews and other items. The site also featured a daily [[Weather forecasting|weather report]], where Lynch gives a brief description of the weather in Los Angeles, where he resides. Until June 2010, this weather report (usually no longer than 30&amp;nbsp;seconds) was also being broadcast, on his personal [[YouTube]]-channel ''David Lynch – Daily Weather Report''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/user/DLDWR David Lynch – Daily Weather Report]&lt;/ref&gt; An absurd [[ringtone]] (&quot;I like to kill deer&quot;) from the website was a common [[sound bite]] on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' in early 2006.

Lynch is an avid coffee drinker and even has his own line of special organic blends available for purchase on his website. Called &quot;David Lynch Signature Cup&quot;, the coffee has been advertised via flyers included with several recent Lynch-related DVD releases, including ''Inland Empire'' and the Gold Box edition of ''Twin Peaks''. The possibly self-mocking tag-line for the brand is &quot;It's all in the beans ... and I'm just full of beans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Lynch Signature Cup flyer, included with the ''Twin Peaks'' Definitive Gold Box Edition DVD set, October 2007, the digitally remastered ''[[Eraserhead]]'' DVD in 2006, and in other Lynch DVD releases in 2005–2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also a quote of a line said by [[Justin Theroux]]'s character in ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]''.

'''David Paul Cronenberg''', [[Order of Canada|OC]], [[Royal Society of Canada|FRSC]] (born March 15, 1943){{sfn|Cronenberg|1992|p=1}} is a Canadian filmmaker and screenwriter. He is one of the principal originators of what is commonly known as the ''[[body horror]]'' or ''venereal horror'' genre. This style of [[filmmaking]] explores people's fears of bodily transformation and infection. In his films, the psychological is typically intertwined with the physical. In the first half of his career, he explored these themes mostly through [[horror film|horror]] and [[science fiction film|science fiction]], although his work has since expanded beyond these genres. He has been called &quot;the most audacious and challenging narrative director in the English-speaking world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[J.

== Personal life ==
Cronenberg was born in Toronto, Ontario, where he currently lives.{{sfn|Cronenberg|1992|p=1}} He is the son of Esther ([[married and maiden names|née]] Sumberg), a musician, and Milton Cronenberg, a writer and editor.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/84/David-Cronenberg.html |title=David Cronenberg Biography (1943–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in a [[middle-class]] progressive Jewish family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisner|first=Ken|year=2003|title=David Cronenberg|journal=Georgia Straight|volume=37|issue=February 27–March 6|page=23|url=http://www.davidcronenberg.de/georgiastraight.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cronenberg attended [[Harbord Collegiate Institute]], later graduating from [[University College, University of Toronto|University College]], [[University of Toronto]] with a degree in literature, having switched from science. He has cited [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]] as influences. He is an [[atheism|atheist]] and does not believe in an afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Guttsman, Janet, ''Reuters.com'' (September 10, 2007). [http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN0824644320070910 Cronenberg gets down and dirty with Russian mob]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I'm simply a nonbeliever and have been forever. ... I'm interested in saying, 'Let us discuss the existential question. We are all going to die, that is the end of all consciousness. There is no afterlife. There is no God. Now what do we do.' That's the point where it starts getting interesting to me.&quot; — Interview, Esquire, February 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1992 book ''Cronenberg on Cronenberg'', he revealed that ''[[The Brood]]'' was inspired by events that occurred during the unraveling of his first marriage, which caused both Cronenberg and his daughter Cassandra a great deal of turmoil. The character Nola Carveth, mother of the brood, is based on Cassandra's mother. Cronenberg said that he found the shooting of the climactic scene, in which Nola was strangled by her husband, to be &quot;very satisfying&quot;.{{sfn|Cronenberg|1992|p=84}}

== Career ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=May 2011}}
After two short sketch films and two short art-house features (the black and white ''[[Stereo (film)|Stereo]]'' and the colour ''[[Crimes of the Future]]'') Cronenberg went into partnership with [[Ivan Reitman]]. The Canadian government provided financing for his films through the 1970s. He alternated his signature &quot;[[body horror]]&quot; films such as ''[[Shivers (film)|Shivers]]'' with projects reflecting his interest in car racing and bike gangs. ''[[Rabid]]'' exploited the unexpected acting talents of [[pornographic]] actress [[Marilyn Chambers]] (Cronenberg's first choice was a young, then-unknown [[Sissy Spacek]]). ''Rabid'' was a breakthrough with international distributors and his next two horror features gained stronger support.

Over the arc of his career, Cronenberg's films follow a definite progression, a movement from the social world to the inner life. In his early films, scientists modify human bodies, which results in the breakdown of social order (e.g. ''Shivers'', ''Rabid''). In his middle period, the chaos wrought by the scientist is more personal, (e.g. ''[[The Brood]]'', ''[[Scanners]]'', ''[[Videodrome]]''). In the later period, the scientist himself is altered by his experiment (e.g. his remake of ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]''). This trajectory culminates in ''[[Dead Ringers (film)|Dead Ringers]]'' in which a twin pair of [[gynecology|gynecologists]] spiral into [[codependency]] and [[drug addiction]]. His later films tend more to the psychological, often contrasting subjective and objective realities (''[[eXistenZ]]'', ''[[M. Butterfly (film)|M. Butterfly]]'', ''[[Spider (film)|Spider]]'').

Perhaps the best example of a film that straddles the line between his works of personal chaos and psychological confusion is Cronenberg's &quot;adaptation&quot; of his literary hero [[William S. Burroughs]]' most controversial book, ''[[Naked Lunch]]''. The book was considered &quot;unfilmable&quot; and Cronenberg acknowledged that a straight translation into film would &quot;cost 100 million dollars and be banned in every country in the world&quot;. Instead—much like in his earlier film, ''Videodrome''—he consistently blurred the lines between what appeared to be reality and what appeared to be [[hallucinations]] brought on by the main character's [[drug addiction]]. Some of the book's &quot;moments&quot; (as well as incidents loosely based upon Burroughs' life) are presented in this manner within the film. Cronenberg stated that while writing the screenplay for ''[[Naked Lunch (film)|Naked Lunch]]'', he felt a moment of [[synergy]] with the writing style of Burroughs. He felt the connection between his screenwriting style and Burroughs' prose style was so strong, that he jokingly remarked that should Burroughs pass on, &quot;I'll just write his next book.&quot;

Cronenberg has said that his films should be seen &quot;from the point of view of the disease&quot;, and that, for example, he identifies with the characters in ''Shivers'' ''after'' they become infected with the anarchic parasites. Disease and disaster, in Cronenberg's work, are less problems to be overcome than agents of [[Morphological freedom|personal transformation]]. Similarly, in ''[[Crash (1996 film)|Crash]]'' (1996), people who have been injured in car crashes attempt to view their ordeal as &quot;a fertilizing rather than a destructive event&quot;. In 2005, Cronenberg would say that he was upset that [[Paul Haggis]] had chosen the same name for his [[Academy Award]] winning film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'', feeling it was &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;very disrespectful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Double Trouble |publisher=Slate Magazine |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2118602/fr/nl/ |date=May 12, 2005 |accessdate=December 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]'' (1983) and ''The Fly'', Cronenberg has not generally worked within the world of big-budget, mainstream [[Hollywood]] filmmaking, although he has had occasional near misses. At one stage he was considered by [[George Lucas]] as a possible director for ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'' but was passed. Cronenberg also worked for nearly a year on a version of ''[[Total Recall (film)|Total Recall]]'' but experienced &quot;creative differences&quot; with producers [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and [[Ronald Shusett]]. A different version of the film was eventually made by [[Paul Verhoeven]]. A fan of [[Philip K. Dick]], author of &quot;We Can Remember it For You Wholesale,&quot; the short story upon which the film was based, Cronenberg related (in the biography/overview of his work, ''Cronenberg on Cronenberg'') that his dissatisfaction with what he envisioned the film to be and what it ended up being pained him so greatly that for a time, he suffered a [[migraine]] just thinking about it, akin to a needle piercing his eye.

In the late 1990s, Cronenberg was announced as director of a sequel to another Verhoeven film, ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', but this also fell through. His recent work, the thriller ''[[A History of Violence (film)|A History of Violence]]'' (2005), is one of his highest budgeted and most accessible to date. He has said that the decision to direct it was influenced by his having had to defer some of his salary on the low-budgeted ''[[Spider (film)|Spider]]'', but it is one of his most critically acclaimed films to date, along with ''[[Eastern Promises]]'' (2007) a film about the struggle of one man to gain power in the Russian Mafia.

Cronenberg has collaborated with composer [[Howard Shore]] on all of his films since ''[[The Brood]]'' (1979), (see [[List of noted film director and composer collaborations]]) with the exception of ''The Dead Zone'' (1983), which was scored by [[Michael Kamen]]. Other regular collaborators include actor Robert Silverman, [[art director]] Carol Spier, [[sound editor]] Bryan Day, [[film editor]] Ronald Sanders, his sister, [[costume designer]] [[Denise Cronenberg]], and, from 1979 until 1988, [[cinematographer]] Mark Irwin. In 2008, Cronenberg directed Howard Shore's first [[opera]], ''[[The Fly (opera)|The Fly]]''.

Since 1988's ''Dead Ringers'', Cronenberg has worked with cinematographer [[Peter Suschitzky]] on each of his films (see [[List of noted film director and cinematographer collaborations]]). Suschitzky was the director of photography for ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'', and Cronenberg remarked that Suschitzky's work in that film &quot;was the only one of those movies that actually looked good&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=David Cronenberg Re-Examines David Cronenberg |publisher=Film Freak Central |url=http://www.filmfreakcentral.net/notes/dcronenbergretrointerview.htm|date=March 9, 2003 |accessdate=March 9, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a motivating factor to work with him on ''Dead Ringers''.

Having worked with many Hollywood stars, Cronenberg says that he did not get to make a film with an actor he wanted to work with for a long time, [[Burt Reynolds]]. Cronenberg remains a staunchly Canadian filmmaker, with nearly all of his films (including major studio vehicles ''The Dead Zone'' and ''The Fly'') having been filmed in his home province Ontario. Notable exceptions include ''M. Butterfly'' and ''Spider'', most of which were shot in China and England, respectively. ''Rabid'' and ''Shivers'' were shot in and around [[Montreal]]. Most of his films have been at least partially financed by [[Telefilm Canada]], and Cronenberg is a vocal supporter of government-backed film projects, saying &quot;Every country needs [a system of government [[Grant (money)|grants]]] in order to have a national cinema in the face of Hollywood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phipps |first=Keith |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22500 |title=David Cronenberg |work=[[The A.V. Club]] |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cronenberg has also appeared as an actor in other directors' films. Most of his roles are [[cameo appearance]]s, as in ''Into The Night'', ''[[Jason X]]'', ''[[To Die For]]'', and ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', but on occasion he has played major roles, as in ''[[Nightbreed]]'' or ''[[Last Night (1998 film)|Last Night]]''. He has not played major roles in any of his own films, but he did put in a brief appearance as a gynecologist in ''The Fly''; he can also be glimpsed among the sex-crazed hordes in ''Shivers''; he can be heard as an unseen car-pound attendant in ''Crash''; his hands can be glimpsed in ''eXistenZ''; and he appeared as a stand-in for [[James Woods]] in ''Videodrome'' for shots in which Woods' character wore a helmet that covered his head.

In 2008 Cronenberg realized two extra-cinematographic projects: the exhibition Chromosomes at the [[Rome Film Fest]] and the opera ''The Fly'' at the LaOpera in Los Angeles and Theatre Châtelet in Paris.

== Future projects ==
In July 2010, Cronenberg completed production on ''[[A Dangerous Method]]'', an adaptation of [[Christopher Hampton]]'s play ''The Talking Cure'', starring [[Keira Knightley]], [[Michael Fassbender]], and frequent collaborator [[Viggo Mortensen]]. The film was produced by independent British producer [[Jeremy Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theplaylist.blogspot.com/2010/03/viggo-mortensen-replaces-christoph.html |title=Viggo Mortensen Replaces Christoph Waltz As Sigmund Freud In David Cronenberg's 'The Talking Cure' |publisher=The Playlist |date=March 9, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Kiera Knightley Takes The Talking Cure | url=http://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=26588|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|date=December 23, 2009 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also plans to write and direct an adaptation of [[Don Delillo]]'s ''[[Cosmopolis (film)|Cosmopolis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ben Child |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/jul/27/david-cronenberg-don-delillo-cosmopolis |title=Cronenberg to enter DeLillo's Cosmopolis |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=July 27, 2009 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cronenberg has appeared on various &quot;Greatest Director&quot; lists. In 2004, [[Science Fiction]] magazine [[Strange Horizons]] named him the 2nd greatest director in the history of the genre, ahead of better known directors such as [[Steven Spielberg]], [[James Cameron]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Ridley Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeremy Adam Smith |url=http://www.strangehorizons.com/2004/20040419/directors.shtml |title=The Ten Best Science Fiction Film Directors |publisher=strangehorizons.com |date=April 19, 2004 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, ''[[The Guardian]]'' listed him 9th on their list of &quot;The world's 40 best directors&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/page/0,11456,1082823,00.html |title=The world's 40 best directors

Earnhardt is notable for his success in the [[Winston Cup|Winston Cup Series]] (now the [[Sprint Cup Series]]), winning seventy-six races (including one [[Daytona 500]] victory in [[1998 Daytona 500|1998]]). Earnhardt's seven championships are tied for most all-time with [[Richard Petty]]. His aggressive driving style led to controversy and earned him the nickname &quot;The Intimidator&quot;.

Earnhardt died in a last-lap crash during the [[2001 Daytona 500]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.carsandracingstuff.com/library/e/earnhardtdale.php | title = Dale Earnhardt | work = The Crittenden Automotive Library | accessdate = 2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Lars|last=Anderson|title=Number 3 Still Roars Ten Years After: Dale Earnhardt died in the 2001 Daytona 500, but even as the green flag flies for this year's race and a new Sprint Cup season, his legacy is felt throughout the sport—and in the lives of three men in particular|date=February 21, 2011|publisher=Time Inc|work=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1182014/index.htm|accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been inducted in numerous halls of fame, including the inaugural class of the [[NASCAR Hall of Fame]].

==Early life and personal life==
Earnhardt was born in [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]], on April 29, 1951, to Martha Coleman and [[Ralph Earnhardt]], who was then one of the best short-track drivers in North Carolina. Ralph won his one and only NASCAR Sportsman Championship in 1956 at Greenville Pickens Speedway in Greenville, South Carolina. Although Ralph did not want his son to follow in his footsteps, Earnhardt would not be persuaded to give up his dream of racing, dropping out of school to race. Ralph was a hard teacher for Earnhardt, and after Ralph died of a heart attack at his home in 1973, it took many years before Earnhardt felt as though he had finally &quot;proven&quot; himself to his father. Earnhardt had four siblings, Danny, Randy,Cathy, and Kaye.

When Earnhardt was 17, he married his first wife, Latane Brown, in 1968. Brown gave birth to Earnhardt's first son, [[Kerry Earnhardt|Kerry Dale]], in 1969. They were subsequently divorced in 1970. In 1971, Earnhardt married his second wife, Brenda Gee (the daughter of NASCAR car builder Robert Gee), who gave birth to a daughter, Kelley King, in 1972, and a son, [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.|Ralph Dale Jr.]], in 1974. Not long after his second son was born Dale and Brenda divorced. Dale then married his last wife, Teresa Houston in 1982, who gave birth to their daughter Taylor Nicole in 1988.

==NASCAR career==
===Early Winston Cup career===
Earnhardt began his [[Winston Cup]] career in 1975, making his first start at the [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in North Carolina in the longest race on the Cup circuit, the [[Coca-Cola 600|World 600]]. Earnhardt drove an Ed Negre Dodge Charger(#8) and finished 22nd in the race, one place ahead of his future car owner, [[Richard Childress]]. Earnhardt competed in 8 more races until 1979, when he joined [[Rod Osterlund|Rod Osterlund Racing]], in a season that included a rookie class of future stars&amp;nbsp;– Earnhardt, [[Harry Gant]] and [[Terry Labonte]].

In his rookie season, Earnhardt won one race at [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]], captured four poles, had 11 Top 5 finishes, 17 Top 10 finishes, and finished 7th in the points standings, in spite of missing four races because of a broken collarbone, winning [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] honors.

In his sophomore season, Earnhardt, now with 20-year old Doug Richert as his crew chief, began the season winning the [[Budweiser Shootout|Busch Clash]]. With wins at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]], Bristol, [[Music City Motorplex|Nashville]], [[Martinsville Speedway|Martinsville]], and Charlotte, Earnhardt won his first [[Winston Cup]] championship. To this day, Earnhardt is the only driver in NASCAR Winston Cup history to follow a Rookie of the Year title with a NASCAR Winston Cup Championship the next season. He was the third driver in NASCAR history to win both the Rookie of the Year and Cup Series championship in his career, joining [[David Pearson (NASCAR driver)|David Pearson]] and [[Richard Petty]]. Only 5 drivers have joined this exclusive club since - [[Rusty Wallace]], [[Alan Kulwicki]], [[Jeff Gordon]], [[Tony Stewart]], and [[Matt Kenseth]].

[[File:DaleEarnhardt15racecar1983.jpg|left|thumb|1983 racecar]]
In 1981, after Osterlund sold his team to [[J.D. Stacy]], Earnhardt left for [[Richard Childress Racing]], and finished the season 7th in the points standings but winless. The following year, at [[Richard Childress|Childress']] suggestion, Earnhardt joined car owner [[Bud Moore]] for the 1982 and 1983 seasons driving the #15 [[Wrangler Jeans]] [[Ford Thunderbird]] (Earnhardt's only full-time Ford ride in his career). During the 1982 season, Earnhardt struggled. Although he won at [[Darlington Raceway|Darlington]], he failed to finish 15 races, and completed the season 12th in points, the worst of his career. He also suffered a broken knee cap at Pocono Raceway when he flipped after contact with [[Tim Richmond]]. In 1983, Earnhardt rebounded and won his first of 12 [[Daytona 500#Qualifying procedure|Twin 125]] Daytona 500 qualifying races. Earnhardt won at Nashville and at [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]], finishing eighth in the points standings.

===Return to Richard Childress Racing===
After the 1983 season, Earnhardt returned to [[Richard Childress Racing]], replacing Ricky Rudd in the #3. Rudd went to Bud Moore's #15, replacing Earnhardt. Wrangler sponsored both drivers at their respective teams. During the 1984 and 1985 seasons, Earnhardt visited victory lane six times, at Talladega, Atlanta, [[Richmond International Raceway|Richmond]], Bristol (twice), and Martinsville, where he finished fourth and eighth in the season standings, respectively.

The 1986 season saw Earnhardt win his second career Winston Cup Championship and the first owner's championship for RCR. He won five races and had ten Top 5 and sixteen Top 10 finishes. Earnhardt successfully defended his championship the following year, visiting victory lane eleven times and winning the championship by 489 points over [[Bill Elliott]]. In the process, Earnhardt set a NASCAR modern era record of four consecutive wins and won five of the first seven races. In the 1987 season, Earnhardt earned his nickname &quot;'''The Intimidator'''&quot; after spinning out Elliott in the final segment of &quot;The Winston&quot;, a non-points event now known as the [[NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race]]. During this race, Earnhardt was briefly forced into the infield grass, but kept control of his car and returned to the track without giving up his lead&amp;nbsp;— a maneuver now referred to as the &quot;Pass in the Grass&quot; even though Earnhardt actually didn't pass and couldn't have passed anyone for position as he was in the lead at the time.
[[File:Earnhardt.jpg|left|170px]]

The 1988 season saw Earnhardt racing with a new sponsor, [[GM Goodwrench]], which replaced [[Wrangler Jeans]]. During this season Earnhardt garnered a second nickname, &quot;'''The Man in Black'''&quot;, owing to the black paint scheme in which the #3 car was painted. He was also called &quot;[[Darth Vader]]&quot; more than once because of the black uniform and car, adding to his notoriety as a driver who would wreck anyone he could not pass. He won three times in 1988, finishing third in the points standings behind Bill Elliott and [[Rusty Wallace]]. The following year, Earnhardt won five times, but a late spin out at [[North Wilkesboro Speedway|North Wilkesboro]] arguably cost him the 1989 championship, as Rusty Wallace edged out Earnhardt for the championship.

===1990s===
[[File:Dale Earnhardt drives a Bomb Lift Truck.jpg|thumb|As part of a Winston No Bull 5 fan contest, Earnhardt drives a Bomb Lift Truck and attempts to load an [[AIM-120 AMRAAM|AIM-120 advanced medium-range air-to-air missile (AMRAAM)]] missile as he competes in a load crew competition at [[Langley Air Force Base]], Virginia, September 2000.  Coincidentally, this position on a load crew is known unofficially as a &quot;Jammer Driver&quot; or more officially as a Number '''''3''''' man.]]
The 1990 season started for Earnhardt with victories in the [[Budweiser Shootout|Busch Clash]] and his heat of the [[Gatorade Duel|Gatorade Twin 125s]]. Near the end of the Daytona 500, he had a four-second lead when the final caution flag came out with a handful of laps to go. When the green flag waved, Earnhardt was leading [[Derrike Cope]]. On the final lap, Earnhardt ran over a piece of metal in the final turn, cutting a tire. Cope, in an upset, won the race while Earnhardt finished fifth. The #3 Goodwrench Chevy team took the flat tire that cost them the win and hung it on the shop wall as a reminder of how close they'd come to winning the Daytona 500. Earnhardt went on to win nine races this season and won his fourth Winston Cup title, beating [[Mark Martin (NASCAR)|Mark Martin]] by 26 points. Earnhardt also became the first repeat winner of the annual all-star race, The Winston.

The 1991 season saw Earnhardt win his fifth Winston Cup championship. He scored just four wins, but won the championship by 195 points over [[Ricky Rudd]]. One of his wins that year came at [[North Wilkesboro Speedway|North Wilkesboro]], in a race where [[Harry Gant]] had a chance to set a single-season record by winning his fifth consecutive race, breaking a record held by Earnhardt. Late in the race Gant lost his brakes, which gave Earnhardt the chance he needed to make the pass for the win and maintain his record.

Earnhardt's only win in 1992 came at [[Charlotte]], in the [[Coca-Cola 600]], ending a 13-race win streak by Ford teams. Earnhardt finished a career-low 12th in the points for the second time in his career, and the only time he had finished that low since joining RCR. Earnhardt still made the trip to the annual Awards Banquet with [[Rusty Wallace]] but did not have the best seat in the house. Wallace states he and Earnhardt had to sit on the backs of their chairs to see and Earnhardt said &quot;This sucks, I could have gone hunting&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/columns/story?columnist=mcgee_ryan&amp;id=3736700 |title=Ryan McGee: Best and worst of NASCAR Sprint Cup banquet nights past&amp;nbsp;— ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2009-01-12 |accessdate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the year, longtime crew chief [[Kirk Shelmerdine]] left to become a driver. [[Andy Petree]] took over as crew chief.

Hiring Petree turned out to be beneficial, as the #3 GM Goodwrench Chevy returned to the front in 1993. Earnhardt once again came close to a win at the [[Daytona 500]], and dominated Speedweeks before finishing second to [[Dale Jarrett]] on a last-lap pass. Earnhardt scored six wins en route to his sixth Winston Cup title, including wins in the [[Coca-Cola 600]] and The Winston at Charlotte, and the [[Coke Zero 400|Pepsi 400]] at Daytona. Earnhardt beat [[Rusty Wallace]] for the championship by 80 points.

[[File:Dale Sr 1994.jpg|thumb|Dale's [[1994 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1994]] racecar]]

In 1994, Earnhardt achieved a feat that he himself had believed to be impossible&amp;nbsp;– he scored his seventh Winston Cup championship, tying the legendary [[Richard Petty]]. Earnhardt was very consistent, scoring four wins, and after [[Ernie Irvan]] was sidelined due to a near-deadly crash at Michigan (the two were neck-and-neck at the top of the points up until the crash), won title by over 400 points over [[Mark Martin (NASCAR)|Mark Martin]]. Earnhardt sealed the deal at Rockingham by winning the race over [[Rick Mast]]. Although Earnhardt continued to dominate in the seasons ahead, this would be his final NASCAR championship.

Earnhardt started off the 1995 season by finishing second in the Daytona 500 to [[Sterling Marlin]]. He won 5 races in 1995, including his first [[road course]] victory at [[Infineon Raceway|Sears Point]]. He also won the [[Allstate 400 at The Brickyard|Brickyard 400]] at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], a win he called the biggest of his career. But in the end, Earnhardt lost the championship to [[Jeff Gordon]] by just 34 points.

Earnhardt began 1996 with a repeat of 1993&amp;nbsp;– he dominated Speedweeks only to finish second in the Daytona 500 to [[Dale Jarrett]] for a second time. Earnhardt won early in the year, scoring consecutive victories at [[Rockingham Speedway|Rockingham]] and Atlanta. In late July in the [[AMP Energy 500|DieHard 500]] at Talladega, he was in the points lead and looking for his eighth title despite the departure of crew chief Andy Petree. Late in the race, [[Ernie Irvan]] lost control of his #28 Havoline Ford Thunderbird, igniting a frightening crash that saw Earnhardt's #3 Chevrolet hit the tri-oval wall nearly head-on at almost 200 miles per hour. After hitting the wall, Earnhardt's car flipped and slid across the track, in front of race-traffic. His car was hit in the roof and windshield, and the accident led NASCAR to mandate the &quot;Earnhardt Bar&quot;, a metal brace located in the center of the windshield that reinforces the roof in case of a similar crash.

Rain-delays had canceled the live telecast of the race and most fans first learned of the accident during the night's sports newscasts. Video of the crash showed what appeared to be a fatal incident, but once medical workers arrived at the car, Earnhardt climbed out and waved to the crowd, refusing to be loaded onto a stretcher despite a broken collarbone, sternum, and shoulder blade. Many thought the incident would end his season early, but Earnhardt refused to give up. The next week at Indianapolis, he started the race but exited the car on the first pit stop, allowing [[Mike Skinner (NASCAR)|Mike Skinner]] to take the wheel. When asked, Earnhardt said that vacating the #3 car was the hardest thing he'd ever done. The following weekend at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]], he drove the #3 Goodwrench Chevrolet to the fastest time in qualifying, earning the &quot;True Grit&quot; pole. T-shirts emblazoned with Earnhardt's face were quickly printed up, brandishing the caption, &quot;It Hurt So Good.&quot; Earnhardt led most of the race and looked to have victory in hand, but fatigue finally took its toll and Earnhardt ended up 6th, behind race winner [[Geoff Bodine]]. Earnhardt did not win again in 1996, but still finished 4th in the standings behind [[Terry Labonte]], [[Jeff Gordon]] and [[Dale Jarrett]]. David Smith departed as crew chief of the #3 team and RCR at the end of the year for personal reasons, and was replaced by [[Larry McReynolds]].

In 1997, Earnhardt went winless for only the second time in his career. The only (non-points) win came during Speedweeks at Daytona in the Twin 125-mile qualifying race, his record 8th straight win in the event. Once again in the hunt for the Daytona 500 with 10 laps to go, Earnhardt was taken out of contention by a late crash which sent his car upside down on the backstretch. Earnhardt hit the low point of his year when he blacked out early in the [[Mountain Dew Southern 500]] at [[Darlington Raceway|Darlington]] in September, causing him to hit the wall. Afterward, he was disoriented and it took several laps before he could find his pit stall. When asked, Earnhardt complained of double vision which made it difficult to pit. Mike Dillon (Richard Childress's son-in-law) was brought in to relieve Earnhardt for the remainder of the race. Earnhardt was evaluated at a local hospital and cleared to race the very next week, but the cause of the blackout and double vision was never determined. Despite no wins, the RCR team finished the season 5th in the final standings.

1998 saw Earnhardt win the [[Daytona 500]] after not winning in the previous 19 attempts. Earnhardt began the season by winning his Twin 125-mile qualifier race for the ninth straight year. On race day, Earnhardt showed himself to be a contender early. Halfway through the race, however, it seemed that [[Jeff Gordon]] had the upper hand. But by lap 138, Earnhardt had taken the lead, and thanks to a push by teammate [[Mike Skinner (NASCAR)|Mike Skinner]], he was able to maintain it. Earnhardt made it to the to the caution checkered flag before [[Bobby Labonte]]. Afterwards, there was a large show of respect for Earnhardt, in which every crew member of every team lined [[pit road]] to shake his hand as he made his way to [[List of motorsport terminology#V|victory lane]]. Earnhardt then drove his #3 into the infield grass, starting a trend of post-race celebrations. He spun the car twice, throwing grass and leaving tire tracks in the shape of a #3 in the grass. Earnhardt then spoke about the victory, saying &quot;I have had a lot of great fans and people behind me all through the years and I just can't thank them enough. The Daytona 500 is ours. We won it! We won it! We won it!&quot; Unfortunately, the rest of the season did not go as well, and The Great American Race was his only victory that year. He slipped to 12th in the standings halfway through the season, and [[Richard Childress]] decided to make a crew chief change, taking [[Mike Skinner (NASCAR)|Mike Skinner's]] crew chief [[Kevin Hamlin]] and putting him with Earnhardt while giving Skinner [[Larry McReynolds]]. Earnhardt was able to climb back to 8th in the final standings.

Before the 1999 season, fans began discussing Earnhardt's age and speculating that with his son, [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr|Dale Jr.]] getting into racing, Earnhardt might be contemplating retirement. Earnhardt swept both races for the year at Talladega, leading most observers to conclude that Earnhardt's talent had become limited to the restrictor plate tracks, which require a unique skill set and an exceptionally powerful car to win. But halfway through the year, Earnhardt began to show some of the old spark. In the August race at Michigan International Speedway, Earnhardt led laps late in the race and nearly pulled off his first win on a non-restrictor plate track since 1996.

One week later, he provided the sport with one of its most controversial moments.

At the August Bristol race, Earnhardt found himself in contention to win his first short track race since Martinsville in 1995. When a caution came out with 15 laps to go, leader [[Terry Labonte]] got hit from behind by the lapped car of [[Darrell Waltrip]]. His spin put Earnhardt in the lead with 5 cars between him and Labonte with 5 laps to go. Labonte had four fresh tires and Earnhardt was driving on old tires, which made Earnhardt's car considerably slower. Labonte caught Earnhardt and passed him coming to the [[white flag]], but Earnhardt drove hard into turn two, bumping Labonte and spinning him around. Dale went on to collect the win while spectators booed and made obscene gestures. &quot;I didn't mean to turn him around, I just wanted to rattle his cage&quot;, Earnhardt said of the incident. Earnhardt finished 7th in the standings that year, and looked like a contender again.

In the 2000 season, Earnhardt had a resurgence, which some attributed to neck surgery he underwent to correct a lingering injury from his 1996 Talladega crash. He scored what many considered the 2 most exciting wins of the year&amp;nbsp;– winning by .006 seconds over [[Bobby Labonte]] at Atlanta, then gaining seventeen positions in the final four laps to win at Talladega, claiming his only [[Winston Million|No Bull]] million dollar bonus. Earnhardt also enjoyed strong second-place runs at Richmond and Martinsville, tracks where he'd struggled through the late '90s. On the strength of these performances, Earnhardt took the No. 3 GM Goodwrench [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] to 2nd in the standings. However, poor performances at the road course of Watkins Glen, where he wrecked coming out of the [[chicane]], a wreck with [[Chad Little]] while leading the spring race at Bristol, and mid-pack runs at intermediate tracks like Charlotte and Dover in a season dominated by the Ford Taurus in those tracks of Roush, Yates, and Penske, coupled with the extremely consistent Joe Gibb's #18 team with Bobby Labonte, denied Earnhardt the coveted eighth championship title.

==Death==
{{Main|Death of Dale Earnhardt}}
{{One source|section|date=April 2009}}
In the weeks before the 2001 Daytona 500, Earnhardt elected not to attend the annual fan and media preview event, drawing vocal criticism from fellow driver [[Jimmy Spencer]]. On February 3 and 4, 2001, the first time in his career, Earnhardt participated in the [[Rolex 24]] endurance race at Daytona, the event which kicks off Speedweeks at the track. His team, which also featured drivers Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Andy Pilgrim, and Kelly Collins, finished 4th overall and 2nd in class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daleearnhardt.net/reports/2001/02_03.htm &quot;2001 Rolex 24 at Daytona&quot;];  Retrieved January 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, however, 2001 Speedweeks would be the first in many years that Earnhardt failed to win at least one race. In the first NASCAR-sanctioned event of Speedweeks, the Budweiser Shootout, Earnhardt finished second to [[Tony Stewart]]. Earnhardt was also denied victory in the Gatorade Twin 125 qualifying race in which he participated. Earnhardt had won every Twin 125 event he competed in during the 1990s, and was poised to win again in 2001 when [[Sterling Marlin]] pulled off a slingshot pass going down the backstretch, taking the victory away from Earnhardt.

On the morning of the 2001 Daytona 500, Earnhardt appeared confident and relaxed. When the race started, Earnhardt showed early promise, leading the race and maintaining a front-running position for most of the event.

A multi-car wreck late in the race eliminated several cars in spectacular fashion. [[Tony Stewart]], who had beaten Earnhardt in the [[Budweiser Shootout]], found his car tumbling wildly down the backstretch. The race was red flagged to facilitate cleanup of the track, and when the race resumed, it was Earnhardt and [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.|DEI]] drivers [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.|Earnhardt Jr.]] and [[Michael Waltrip]] who were running up front. As the laps wound down, Waltrip was leading Earnhardt Jr. and Earnhardt.

On the front stretch coming to 3 laps to go, Earnhardt made contact with Sterling Marlin's front right fender. Earnhardt's car wiggled but Earnhardt kept control and he remained in third position. Marlin was known for having a fast car throughout the race, and Earnhardt repeatedly blocked his attempts at passing during the last few laps. With less than two laps remaining, Darrell Waltrip commented that &quot;Sterling has beat the front end off of that old Dodge (Marlin's car) trying to get around Dale (Earnhardt)&quot;.

Heading into Turn 3 on the last lap, Earnhardt was racing three wide with Marlin to his left and Schrader to his right. For reasons unknown, Earnhardt's car veered down. The left rear quarter of Earnhardt's car made slight contact with Marlin's front bumper.

Earnhardt’s car slid off the track's steep banking, onto the flat apron, and then turned sharply up the track toward the outside retaining wall. Although it briefly looked as though Earnhardt was going to avoid hitting the wall, the #3 car  collided with the #36 Pontiac driven by [[Ken Schrader]]. Schrader's car hit Earnhardt's car just behind the passenger door, causing Earnhardt's car to snap. Both cars hit the wall nose-first. Earnhardt's car hit at a critical angle at nearly 160 miles per hour. The right-rear wheel assembly broke off the car on impact. The passenger window broke out of the car. The hood pins severed and the hood opened, slamming back against the windshield. 

Despite heavy damage to the car, to outside observers, the crash looked relatively minor compared to other NASCAR related crashes, especially the multi-car wreck that had occurred earlier in the race that resulted in [[Tony Stewart]]'s car being totalled.

While Michael Waltrip raced toward the checkered flag to claim his first victory, with Earnhardt Jr. close behind, the cars of Earnhardt and Schrader slid off the track's asphalt banking toward the infield grass just inside of turn four. After climbing from his car, Schrader peered into Earnhardt's car, only to jump back and signal for [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]s. As medical crews converged upon the crash scene, [[NASCAR on Fox]] reporter [[Jeanne Zelasko]] asked Schrader about Earnhardt's condition. &quot;I'm not a doctor, but I got the heck out of the way as soon as they got there,&quot; Schrader said solemnly. Earnhardt was taken to Halifax Medical Center by ambulance after being removed from his car. Hours later, at a press conference, [[NASCAR]] President [[Mike Helton]] announced, &quot;Undoubtedly this is one of the toughest announcements I've personally had to make. But[] after the accident in Turn 4 at the end of the Daytona 500, uh, we've lost Dale Earnhardt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/2001/NEWS/02/18/earnhardt_stewart/index.html &quot;Earnhardt dies following Daytona 500 accident&quot;]; Dave Rodman, Turner Sports Interactive, February 21, 2001; [[NASCAR.com]]. Retrieved September 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
Earnhardt's death was the catalyst for a number of changes in NASCAR. Following his death, there was a police investigation, as well as a NASCAR-sanctioned investigation. Nearly every detail of the event was made public, from the finding of a torn seatbelt inside Earnhardt's car to graphic descriptions of the injuries the driver suffered at the moment of impact. There were rumors that he did not have his seat belt on properly, as he liked to wear it loose so he could move around and not feel too constrained. The allegations of seatbelt failure led [[Bill Simpson]] to resign from the company bearing his name, which manufactured the seatbelts used in Earnhardt's car and nearly every other NASCAR competitor's machine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinton&quot;&gt;''Daytona: From the Birth of Speed to the Death of the Man in Black''. Hinton, Ed. Warner Books, 2001. ISBN 0-446-52677-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NASCAR]] also made the use of the [[HANS device]] mandatory in all cars following Earnhardt's death. Until that point, use of the HANS device was optional, at the discretion of the drivers or teams. Earnhardt had refused to wear the device, arguing it was uncomfortable and ineffective. He was not using a HANS device on the day he died of a [[Basilar skull fracture]]. The [[HANS device]] is designed to prevent such injuries.

Several press conferences were held in the days following Earnhardt's death. Some fans wrote threatening letters to [[Sterling Marlin]], blaming him for causing the wreck. Quickly thereafter, [[Michael Waltrip]] and Earnhardt's son, [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]], publicly and adamantly absolved Marlin of any responsibility.

Richard Childress made a public pledge that the number 3 would never again adorn the side of a black car sponsored by GM Goodwrench. Childress, who currently holds the rights from NASCAR to the #3, has placed a moratorium on using it. Earnhardt's team was re-christened as the #29 team, with the same sponsor but with a new look (a reversed color scheme with white with black numerals and a black stripe on the bottom) for the following races at Rockingham and Las Vegas. For Atlanta, a new GM Goodwrench scheme was introduced, with angled red stripes and a thin blue pinstripe, resembling the Childress AC Delco Chevrolets driven in the Busch Series.

Childress' second-year Busch Series driver [[Kevin Harvick]] was named as Earnhardt's replacement driver, beginning with the race following Earnhardt's death held at the North Carolina Speedway. Special hats bearing the #3 were distributed to everyone at the track to honor Earnhardt, and the Childress team wore blank uniforms out of respect, something which disappeared quickly and was replaced by the wearing of the GM Goodwrench Service Plus uniforms.

Fans took it upon themselves to begin honoring Earnhardt by holding three fingers aloft on the third lap of every NASCAR Cup race, and the television coverage of [[NASCAR on Fox]] and [[NASCAR on NBC]] went silent for each third lap from Rockingham through to the next Daytona 500 in honor of Earnhardt (and, after [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]], in remembrance of those who perished that day). For the first three weeks after Earnhardt's death, on-track incidents brought out the caution flag on lap three. Three weeks after Earnhardt's death, Harvick scored his first career Cup win at Atlanta driving a car that had been prepared for Earnhardt. In the final lap of the 2001 [[Kobalt Tools 500|Cracker Barrel Old Country Store 500]], Harvick beat [[Jeff Gordon]] by .006 seconds, the same margin that Earnhardt won over [[Bobby Labonte]] at the same race a year prior, and the images of Earnhardt's longtime gas man, [[Danny &quot;Chocolate&quot; Myers]], crying after the victory, Harvick's tire-smoking burnout on the frontstretch with three fingers held aloft outside the driver's window, and the Fox television call by [[Mike Joy]], [[Larry McReynolds]], and [[Darrell Waltrip]], concluding with &quot;Gordon got loose, it's Harvick! Harvick by inches!&quot; are memorable to many NASCAR fans. The win was also considered [[catharsis|cathartic]] for a sport whose epicenter had been ripped away.

He was buried in [[Mooresville, NC]]

Other notable events include: 
* [[Steve Park (NASCAR)|Steve Park]], driver of the #1 DEI [[Pennzoil]] Chevy Monte Carlo won the very next NASCAR Winston Cup race: The DuraLube 400 at North Carolina Speedway in Rockingham, NC held on February 26, 2001.
* [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] won in the next Cup race at Daytona: the Pepsi 400 on July 7, 2001. This led to an emotional celebration on the infield with driver Michael Waltrip, whose victory at the Daytona 500 was vastly overshadowed.
* Las Vegas, the '''3rd''' race of the 2001 season, was noted for the fact that Mike Skinner, Earnhardt's teammate at Richard Childress Racing, took over Earnhardt's slot in the No Bull 5 million dollar eligibility for this race since Earnhardt had qualified for the No Bull 5 prize after his final victory in the 2000 Winston 500 at Talladega. This is the only time that a switch of driver for the No Bull 5 has ever happened.
* Earnhardt was credited with finishing 57th in the final point standings in 2001, despite running one race. He also won the 2001 Most Popular Driver award at the end of the year in the awards' ceremony banquet. Bill Elliott bowed out of the running and encouraged the same fans that had put him up for the prestigious award 16 times to vote for [[Johnny Cash|the Man in Black]].
* Earnhardt Jr. later went on to win the 2004 Daytona 500, three years after his father's death and six years to the day after his father won the 1998 Daytona 500.  He also won the EA Sports 500 at Talladega that same year.
* As of 2010, Earnhardt is interred in a concrete memorial on his farm in Mooresville, North Carolina.
* In 2010, Dale Earnhardt was one of the five inductees in the inaugural class of the [[NASCAR Hall of Fame]].

==#3 Car==
[[File:DaleEarnhardtInCar.jpg|thumb|right|Earnhardt in the #3 car]]
Earnhardt drove the #3 car for most of his career, spanning the early 1980s until his death in 2001. Although he had other sponsors during his career, his #3 is associated in fans' minds with his last sponsor, GM Goodwrench, and his last color scheme&amp;nbsp;— a predominantly black car with bold red and silver trim. The black and red #3 continues to be one of the most famous logos in North American motor racing.

A common misconception is that Richard Childress Racing &quot;owns the rights&quot; to the #3 (fueled by the fact that Kevin Harvick's car has a little #3 as an homage to Earnhardt), but in fact no team owns the rights to this or any other number:  However, according to established NASCAR procedures, RCR would have priority over other teams if and when the time came to reuse the number. RCR and the Earnhardt estate do own the rights to various black and red #3 logos used during Earnhardt's lifetime; however these rights would not prevent a future racing team from using a different #3 design. (Also, a new #3 team would, in any case, need to create logos which fit with their sponsor's logos.)

In 2004, [[ESPN]] released a made-for-TV movie entitled ''[[3: The Dale Earnhardt Story]]'' which used a new (but similarly colored) #3 logo. The movie was a sympathetic portrayal of Earnhardt's life, but the producers were sued for using the #3 logo. In December 2006, the ESPN lawsuit was settled, but details were not released to the public.

It is generally believed that current NASCAR owners have agreed never to use the #3 in Sprint Cup competition again, although this is not official NASCAR policy. [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] made two special appearances in 2002 in a #3 [[Nationwide Series|Busch Series]] car: these appearances were at the track where his father died ([[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]]) and the track where his father made his first Winston Cup start ([[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]]). Earnhardt Jr. won the first of those two races, which was the season-opening event at Daytona. He also raced a #3 sponsored by Wrangler on July 2, 2010 for Richard Childress Racing at Daytona. In a green-white- checker finish he outran Joey Logano to win his second race in the 3.

Otherwise, the #3 was missing from the national touring series until September 5, 2009, when  [[Austin Dillon]], the 19-year-old grandson of Richard Childress debuted an RCR-owned #3 truck in the [[Camping World Truck Series]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Austin-Dillon-3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=David Caraviello |url=http://www.nascar.com/2009/news/headlines/truck/09/03/rcr.adillon.3/index.html |title=Childress grandson brings No. 3 back to national level&amp;nbsp;— Sep 3, 2009 |publisher=Nascar.Com |date=2009-09-03 |accessdate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin Dillon and his younger brother Ty Dillon have been driving #3's in various lower level competitions for several years, including the [[Camping World East Series]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/features/03/20/adillon.driving.3.car/index.html NASCAR.COM&amp;nbsp;– Childress' grandson driving No. 3 car back to NASCAR&amp;nbsp;– March 20, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Childress Racing entered the number 3 in the Daytona Truck race on 13 February 2010 painted identically to when Earnhardt drove it, but with Bass Pro Shops as a sponsor. It was driven by Austin Dillon. Oddly, the number 3 was involved in a wreck almost identical to that which took the life of Earnhardt: being spun out, colliding with another vehicle and being turned into the outside wall in turn number three.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT_EIWs5k-0|Watch 0:13&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the former [[International Race of Champions]] actually retired the #3, which they did in a rule change effective in 2004. Until the series folded in 2007, Anyone wishing to use the #3 again had to use #03 instead.

In 2009, [[Tim McGraw]] released the song &quot;[[Southern Voice (song)|Southern Voice]]&quot;, the song makes a reference to Earnhardt and the number 3 in the line &quot;Number Three Drove it.&quot;

In the movie ''[[Zombieland]]'', Woody Harrelson's character Tallahasee draws a 3 on his car doors. He does this to pay homage to Earnhardt.

The Christian metalcore band [[The Devil Wears Prada (band)|The Devil Wears Prada]] have a song titled &quot;Number Three, Never Forget&quot; in honor of Dale Earnhardt.&lt;ref name=&quot;canoe-review&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

==Legacy==
Earnhardt was a very polarizing figure in NASCAR. He was both loved and hated in the sport, yet despite his numerous detractors, Earnhardt remained one of the sport's most popular drivers. His death drew a considerable amount of reaction from the nation, NASCAR, and his fans.

Earnhardt kept his personal life relatively private. He enjoyed the company of his family, being outdoors, hunting and fishing, and actively working on his farm in Mooresville. In contrast with his image as a hardnosed competitor on the track, off the track he was known to his friends as someone who was charitable and generous, but usually kept that side of himself hidden from the rest of the world.

Earnhardt has a street in his hometown of Kannapolis named after him. Dale Earnhardt Boulevard (originally Earnhardt Road) is marked as Exit 60 off [[Interstate 85]], northeast of [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. Dale Earnhardt Drive is also the start of The Dale Journey Trail,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daletrail.com/ Welcome to &quot;The Dale Trail&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; a self-guided driving tour of landmarks in the lives of Dale and his family. A road between Kannapolis and [[Mooresville, North Carolina|Mooresville]], near the headquarters of DEI, formerly NC 136, was switched with [[North Carolina State Highway 3|State Highway 3]] which was in Currituck County by the North Carolina Department of Transportation. In addition, Exit 73 off [[Interstate 35W (Texas)|Interstate 35W]], one of the entrances to [[Texas Motor Speedway]], is named &quot;Dale Earnhardt Way&quot;.

In 2000, shortly before his death, Earnhardt became a part-owner of the minor league baseball team in Kannapolis, and the team was renamed the [[Kannapolis Intimidators]] shortly thereafter.  After his death, the team retired the jersey number 3 in Earnhardt's honor, and a &quot;3&quot; flag flies beyond the left field wall during every game.

Recording artist Jason Swain's song &quot;Victory Lane&quot; was among many songs released in tribute to Earnhardt posthumously.

[[Atlanta Braves]] assistant coach [[Ned Yost]] was a friend of Earnhardt, and Richard Childress.  When Yost was named [[Milwaukee Brewers]] manager, he changed jersey numbers, from #5 to #3 in Earnhardt's honor.  (#3 is retired by the Braves in honor of outfielder [[Dale Murphy]], so Yost could not make the change while in Atlanta.)  When Yost was named [[Kansas City Royals]] assistant coach, he wore #2 for the 2010 season, even when he was named manager in May 2010, but for the 2011 season, he switched back to #3.

Between the 2004 and 2005 JGTC (subsequently renamed [[Super GT]] from 2005) season, [[Masahiro Hasemi|Hasemi Sport]] competed in the series with a sole black G'Zox sponsored [[Nissan 350Z]] with the same number and letterset as Earnhardt on the roof.

A 2005 novel, ''[http://www.stdale.com St. Dale]'' by [[Sharyn McCrumb]] explores the world of NASCAR as it follows several racing fans on a tribute tour of tracks in memory of Earnhardt.

During the April 29, 2006&amp;nbsp;– May 1, 2006 NASCAR weekend races at [[Talladega Superspeedway]], the Dale Earnhardt Inc cars competed in identical special black paint schemes on Dale Earnhardt Day, held annually on his birthday, April 29. Martin Truex Jr won the Aaron's 312 in the black car, painted to reflect Earnhardt's Intimidating Black #3 NASCAR Busch Grand National series car. In the Nextel Cup race on May 1, #8 Dale Earnhardt Jr., #1 Martin Truex Jr., and #15 Paul Menard competed in cars with the same type of paint scheme.

On June 18, 2006 at Michigan for the 3M Performance 400 Dale Earnhardt Jr ran a special vintage [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] car to honor his father and his grandfather [[Ralph Earnhardt]]. He finished 3rd after rain caused the race to be cut short. The car was painted to resemble Ralph's 1956 dirt cars, and carried 1956-era Budweiser logos to complete the throwback look.

In the summer of 2007, [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.]] (DEI) with the Dale Earnhardt Foundation, announced it will fund an annual [[undergraduate]] scholarship at [[Clemson University]] in [[Clemson, South Carolina]] for students interested in [[motorsports]] and [[automotive]] engineering. Scholarship winners are also eligible to work at DEI in internships.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;DEI partners with Clemson motorsports. ''Clemson World''. Fall 2007. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The first winner was William Bostic, a senior at Clemson majoring in [[mechanical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Earnhardt Motorsports Scholar&quot;. ''Clemson World''. Fall 2007. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Earnhardt Tower&quot;, a seating section at Daytona International Speedway, the track where Earnhardt was killed, was named in his honor.

In 2008, on the 50th anniversary of the first Daytona 500 race, [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.|DEI]] and [[Richard Childress Racing|RCR]] teamed up to make a special [[Car of Tomorrow|COT]] sporting Earnhardt's 1998 Daytona 500 paint scheme to honor the tenth anniversary of his Daytona 500 victory. In a tribute to all previous Daytona 500 winners, the winning drivers appeared in a lineup on stage, in chronological order.  The redesigned #3 car stood in the infield, in the approximate position Earnhardt would have taken in the processional.  The throwback car featured the authentic 1998-era design on a current-era car, a concept similar to modern throwback jerseys in other sports.  The car was later sold in 1:64 and 1:24 scale models.

The [[Intimidator 305]] roller coaster has been up and running since April 2010 at [[Kings Dominion]] in [[Doswell, Virginia]].  Named after Earnhardt, the ride's trains will be modeled after Dale Earnhardt's black-and-red Chevrolet.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intimidator305.com/public/ride/ |title=The Ride :: Intimidator 305 :: Kings Dominion :: Doswell, Virginia |publisher=Intimidator 305 |date= |accessdate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Intimidator was built at Carowinds, in Charlotte, NC.

During the third lap of the 2011 Daytona 500, the commentators on FOX fell silent while fans each raised three fingers in a similar fashion to the tributes throughout 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-20/rookie-trevor-bayne-wins-nascar-s-daytona-500-from-carl-edwards.html |title=Bayne Becomes Youngest Daytona 500 Winner as Nascar's Past, Future Unite |publisher=Bloomberg |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is a collaboration between NASCAR Media and [[Country Music Television|CMT]], and was released on DVD in December 2007.

In 2011, Great American Country (GACTV.com) and NASCAR Media Group released a 1 hour special, The Definitive Earnhardt hosted by Country artist Trace Adkins. The special highlights the events that created one of the greatest racers of all-time, the man nicknamed &quot;The Intimidator,&quot; and illustrates how he became the most polarizing and unforgettable name in stock car racing history. This exclusive GAC special premiered during the 10th anniversary week of Earnhardt's death and features interviews with Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Jeff Gordon, Richard Childress and many others.

===''Dune II'' (1992)===
{{Main|Dune II}}
''Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty'', later retitled ''Dune II: The Battle for Arrakis'' for the [[Sega Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]] port, was released in December 1992 from [[Westwood Studios]]/Virgin Interactive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moby Dune II&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dune-ii-the-building-of-a-dynasty|title=Game Overview: ''Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty'' (1992)|publisher=Mobygames.com|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Abandonia Dune II&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abandonia.com/games/36/download/Dune2.htm|title=Review: ''Dune II - The Building of a Dynasty'' (1992) - Game download available|publisher=Abandonia.com|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often considered to be the first &quot;mainstream modern [[real-time strategy]] game,&quot; ''Dune II'' established many conventions of the genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moby Dune II&quot;/&gt; Only loosely connected to the plot of the novels or films, the game pits three interplanetary houses &amp;mdash; the [[House Atreides|Atreides]], the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]]s, and the [[House Ordos|Ordos]] &amp;mdash; against each other for control of the planet [[Arrakis]] and its valuable spice, all while fending off the destructive natural forces of the harsh [[desert planet]] itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moby Dune II&quot;/&gt;

===''Dune 2000'' (1998)===
{{Main|Dune 2000}}
''Dune 2000'', a 1998 remake of ''Dune II'' from [[Intelligent Games]]/Westwood Studios/Virgin Interactive, added improved graphics and [[live-action]] [[cutscene]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moby Dune 2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dune-2000|title=Game Overview: ''Dune 2000'' (1998)|publisher=Mobygames.com|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though gameplay is similar to its predecessor, ''Dune 2000'' features an enhanced storyline and functionality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moby Dune 2000&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Dune generations logo.png|right|175px|''DUNE Generations'' logo]]
In 2001, [[Cryonetworks]] disclosed information about ''Dune Generations'', an online, 3D real-time strategy game set in the ''Dune'' universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;DG 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dunegenerations.com/ |title=''DUNE Generations'': Main Page|publisher=DuneGenerations.com (Internet Archive)|accessdate=November 27, 2001 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20011127215041/http://www.dunegenerations.com/ |archivedate = November 27, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DG Q&amp;A&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/dunegenerations/news.html?sid=2766761 |title=''DUNE Generations'' Q&amp;A |date=May 30, 2001 |publisher=Gamespot.com |accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official website for the upcoming game that featured some concept images, a brief background story and description of the persistent gameworld, and a list of frequently asked questions.&lt;ref name=&quot;DG FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20011021081521/www.dunegenerations.com/uk/html/faq.htm|title=''DUNE Generations'':FAQ |publisher=DuneGenerations.com (Internet Archive)|accessdate=October 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game would be constructed using Cryo's own online multimedia development framework [[SCOL]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DG Dev&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dunegenerations.com/uk/html/develop01.htm# |title=''DUNE Generations'': Development|publisher=DuneGenerations.com (Internet Archive)|accessdate=January 5, 2002 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20020105205044/http://www.dunegenerations.com/uk/html/develop01.htm# |archivedate = January 5, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within &quot;the infrastructure of a permanent and massive multiplayer world that exists online,&quot; ''DUNE Generations'' would let players assume control of a dynasty in the ''Dune'' universe, with the goal of first mastering the natural resources of their own homeworlds and ultimately rising in power and influence through conflicts and alliances with other player dynasties.&lt;ref name=&quot;DG Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DG Concept&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dunegenerations.com/uk/html/lejeu.htm |title=''DUNE Generations'': Concept|publisher=DuneGenerations.com (Internet Archive)|accessdate=October 19, 2001 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20011019220154/http://www.dunegenerations.com/uk/html/lejeu.htm |archivedate = October 19, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the three available dynasty types &amp;mdash; traders, soldiers, or mercenaries &amp;mdash; would provide a different playing experience, all with the long-term goal of gaining control of Arrakis and its valuable spice.&lt;ref name=&quot;DG Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DG Concept&quot;/&gt; 

A preview video [[trailer (film)|trailer]] was released in November 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;DG trailer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedune.ru/cgi-bin/ccc/counter.pl?dunegen/video/dunegenerations.avi |title=Preview Video Trailer: ''DUNE Generations'' (6 MB) |publisher=Thedune.ru |accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was still in the [[alpha testing]] stage in February 2002,&lt;ref name=&quot;DG Test&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20021211010037/www.dune-generations.com/index_uk.htm|title=''DUNE Generations'': Information Previewing|publisher=Dune-Generations.com (Internet Archive)|accessdate=February 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the project was ultimately halted after Cryo filed for bankruptcy in July 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moby Cryo&quot;/&gt;

}}

The '''Baron Vladimir Harkonnen''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[Dune universe|''Dune'' universe]] created by [[Frank Herbert]]. He is primarily featured in the 1965 novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', in which he is the main antagonist, and is also a major character in the ''[[Prelude to Dune]]'' [[prequel]] [[trilogy]] (1999-2001) by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]]. The character is brought back as a [[ghola]] in the Herbert/Anderson [[sequel]]s which conclude the original series, ''[[Hunters of Dune]]'' (2006) and ''[[Sandworms of Dune]]'' (2007).

&quot;Appendix IV: The Almanak en-Ashraf (Selected Excerpts of the Noble Houses)&quot; in ''Dune'' says of him (in part):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
VLADIMIR HARKONNEN (10,110-10,193) Commonly referred to as Baron Harkonnen, his title is officially Siridar (planetary governor) Baron. Vladimir Harkonnen is the direct-line male descendant of the Bashar [[Abulurd Harkonnen]] who was banished for cowardice after the [[Battle of Corrin]]. The return of [[House Harkonnen]] to power generally is ascribed to adroit manipulation of the [[whale fur]] market and later consolidation with [[Melange (fictional drug)|melange]] wealth from [[Arrakis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Appendix&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Herbert |title=[[Dune (novel)|Dune]] |chapter=Appendix IV: The Almanak en-Ashraf (Selected Excerpts of the Noble Houses): VLADIMIR HARKONNEN |date=1965 |publisher= |isbn= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Characteristics==
In ''Dune'', Herbert notes that the Baron possesses a &quot;[[bass (vocal range)|basso]] voice&quot; and is so &quot;grossly and immensely fat&quot; that he requires [[anti-gravity]] devices known as [[suspensor (Dune)|suspensor]]s to support his weight. &lt;ref name=&quot;Suspensors&quot;&gt;From ''Dune'': &quot;As [Baron Vladimir Harkonnen] emerged from the shadows, his figure took on dimension &amp;mdash; grossly and immensely fat. And with subtle bulges beneath folds of his dark robes to reveal that all this fat was sustained partly by portable suspensors harnessed to his flesh. He might weigh two hundred Standard kilos in actuality, but his feet would carry no more than fifty of them.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is implied by [[Margot Fenring]] that the Baron has allowed himself to become [[obesity|obese]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;Margot&quot;&gt;From ''Dune'': &quot;Lady Fenring, noting [Feyd]'s poise and the sure flow of muscles beneath the tunic thought: ''Here's one who won't let himself go to fat.''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

As ruthless and cruel as he is intelligent and cunning, the Baron's greatest skill is his talent for the subtle and clever manipulation of others through their weaknesses or his understanding of human nature. His sexual preference for young men is implied in ''Dune'' and ''Children of Dune''.&lt;ref&gt;From ''Dune'': &quot;I'll be in my sleeping chambers,&quot; the Baron said. &quot;Bring me that young fellow we bought on [[Gamont]], the one with the lovely eyes. Drug him well. I don't feel like wrestling.&quot; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;From ''Dune'': &quot;Why haven't you ever bought a Bene Gesserit, Uncle?&quot; Feyd-Rautha asked. &quot;With a Truthsayer at your side &amp;mdash;&quot; &quot;You know my tastes!&quot; the Baron snapped.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Baron says to Feyd in ''Dune'': &quot;This old fool saw through the shielded needle you'd planted in that slave boy's thigh. Right where I'd put my hand on it, eh?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted, however, that he &quot;once permitted himself to be seduced&quot; in the liaison which produced his secret daughter. &lt;ref name=&quot;Jessica's father&quot;&gt;Paul says to Jessica in ''Dune'', &quot;And, mother mine, there's a thing you don't know and should &amp;mdash; we are Harkonnens ... take my word for it. I've walked the future, I've looked at a record, I've seen a place, I have all the data. We're Harkonnens ... You're the Baron's own daughter,&quot; he said, and watched the way she pressed her hands to her mouth. &quot;The Baron sampled many pleasures in his youth, and once permitted himself to be seduced. But it was for the genetic purposes of the Bene Gesserit, by one of you.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plotlines ==
=== ''Dune'' ===
As ''Dune'' begins, a longstanding feud exists between the Harkonnens of [[Giedi Prime]] and the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] of [[Caladan]]. The Baron's intent to exterminate the Atreides line seems close to fruition as [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]] is lured to the [[desert planet]] Arrakis on the pretense of taking over the valuable melange operation there. The Baron has an agent in the Atreides household: Leto's own physician, the trusted [[Suk School|Suk doctor]] [[Wellington Yueh]]. Though Suk Imperial Conditioning supposedly makes the subject incapable of inflicting harm, the Baron's [[Mentat|twisted Mentat]] [[Piter De Vries]] notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's assumed that ultimate conditioning cannot be removed without killing the subject. However, as someone once observed, given the right lever you can move a planet. We found the lever that moved the doctor.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Baron has taken Yueh's wife [[Wanna (Dune)|Wanna]] prisoner, threatening her torture and death unless Yueh complies with his demands. Harkonnen also distracts Leto's Mentat [[Thufir Hawat]] from discovering Yueh by guiding Hawat toward another suspect: Leto's [[Bene Gesserit]] [[concubinage|concubine]] [[Lady Jessica]]. The Atreides are soon attacked by Harkonnen forces (secretly supplemented by the seemingly unstoppable Imperial [[Sardaukar]]) as Yueh disables the protective shields around the Atreides palace on Arrakis. As instructed, Yueh takes Leto prisoner; however, suspecting that the Baron has already killed Wanna, Yueh provides the captive Leto with a fake tooth filled with poisonous gas as a means to kill the Baron (though Leto would die as well). De Vries kills Yueh but he also dies with Leto in the [[assassination]] attempt; however Harkonnen survives. The Baron then manipulates Hawat into his service, insuring his control over the Mentat by secretly administering to him a [[residual poison]] invented by De Vries; to avoid death, the [[antidote]] for this poison must be taken regularly and continuously.

Leto and Jessica's son [[Paul Atreides]] flees into the desert with Jessica, and both are presumed dead. Paul's [[prescience]] helps him determine the identity of Jessica's father, the &quot;maternal grandfather who cannot be named&quot; &amp;mdash; the Baron himself. &lt;ref name=&quot;Jessica's father&quot;/&gt; Over the next two years, Harkonnen learns that both of his nephews [[Glossu Rabban]] and [[Feyd-Rautha]] are conspiring against him to obtain his throne; he lets them continue to do so, reasoning that they have to somehow learn to organize a [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]]. As punishment for a failed assassination attempt against him, Harkonnen forces Feyd to single-handedly slaughter all the female slaves who serve as Feyd's lovers. He explains that Feyd has to learn the price of failure.

The Baron's plan to assure Feyd's power is to install him as ruler of Arrakis after a period of tyrannical misrule by Rabban, making Feyd appear to be the savior of the people. However, a crisis on Arrakis begins when the mysterious [[Muad'Dib]] emerges as a leader of the native [[Fremen]] tribes against the rule of the Harkonnens. Eventually, a series of Fremen victories against Beast Rabban threaten to disrupt the trade of the spice. The [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam Corrino IV]] decides to intervene himself and arrives on Arrakis along with five legions of Sardaukar forces.  Shaddam and the Baron are shocked to learn that Muad'Dib is, of course, a very-much-alive Paul Atreides. The Imperial forces fall prey to a surprise attack by the Fremen.  Part of the Fremen/Atreides strategy is to wait until a sandstorm shorts out the force field shields of the Harkonnen/Imperial transport ships, disable them with projectile weapons, and then attack with a vast assault force, using giant [[sandworm (Dune)|sandworm]]s under cover of the severe weather to break the enemy lines.  The Sardaukar and Harkonnen forces are trapped on the planet, astonished at the sandworm mounts and vast numbers of their attackers. Their past ruthlessness gives them little hope of quarter from the enraged Fremen. 

Rabban dies in the initial part of the battle; the Harkonnen army is massacred to the last man and almost all the Imperial Sardaukar are killed. Baron Harkonnen himself is poisoned with a [[gom jabbar]] by Paul's young sister [[Alia Atreides]], his own granddaughter, and dies at the age of 83. Paul then kills Feyd in ritual combat. House Harkonnen's virtual extermination removes it as a galactic power, but Paul's ascension to the Imperial throne in Shaddam's place guarantees that Vladimir's descendants will long reign as the Imperial House Atreides.

=== ''Children of Dune'' ===
Alia had been born with her ancestral memories in the womb, a circumstance the Bene Gesserit called [[abomination (Dune)|Abomination]], because in their experience it is inevitable that the individual will become possessed by the personality of one of their ancestors. In ''[[Children of Dune]]'', Alia falls victim to this prediction when she shares control of her body with the ego-memory of the Baron Harkonnen, and eventually falls under his power. Alia eventually commits [[suicide]], realizing that Harkonnen's [[consciousness]] has surpassed her abilities to contain him.

=== ''Prelude to Dune'' ===
[[Image:Siridar-Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.gif|thumb|right|'''Vladimir Harkonnen''' from ''[[The Dune Encyclopedia]]'']]
In the ''Prelude to Dune'' prequel series by Brian Herbert and Anderson, it is established that Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is the son and heir of [[Dmitri Harkonnen]] and his wife Victoria. Harkonnen's father had been the head of House Harkonnen and ruled the planet Giedi Prime. Trained since youth as a possible successor,  Vladimir had been eventually chosen over his half-brother [[Abulurd Harkonnen|Abulurd]] (namesake of the original). Unhappy with his brother's doings, Abulurd eventually marries Emmi Rabban and renounces the family name and his rights to the title. Under the name Abulurd Rabban, he reigns as governor of the secondary Harkonnen planet [[Lankiveil]]. Abulurd and his wife have two sons: Glossu Rabban (later nicknamed &quot;Beast Rabban&quot; after he murders his own father) and Feyd-Rautha; Vladimir later adopts the boys back into House Harkonnen, and Feyd becomes his designated heir.

The Baron's most prominent political rival is Duke Leto Atreides; the Harkonnens and the Atreides have been bitter enemies for millennia, since the Battle of Corrin that ended the [[Butlerian Jihad]]. When Emperor Shaddam IV orchestrates a plot to destroy the &quot;Red Duke&quot; Leto, the Baron eagerly lends his aid. 

The young Baron Vladimir is described as an exceedingly handsome man, possessing red hair and a near-perfect physique. The Bene Gesserit [[Reverend Mother (Dune)|Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]] is instructed by the Sisterhood to collect the genetic material of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (through conception) for their breeding program.  As the Baron's [[homosexuality]] is something of an open secret, Mohiam [[blackmail]]s him into having sexual relations with her and conceives his child.  When that daughter proves genetically undesirable, Mohiam kills her and returns to Harkonnen for a second try; at this point he drugs and viciously rapes her.  She exacts her retribution by infecting him with a rare disease that later causes his obesity.  Mohiam's second child with Harkonnen is Jessica. &lt;ref&gt;According to the authors, the revelation that Mohiam is Jessica's mother was pulled directly from Frank Herbert's working notes for the original ''Dune'' series. See: {{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/transcripts/2000/herbertandanderson.html  |title=Chat with Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson: ''Dune: House Harkonnen'' |date=2000 |publisher=SciFi.com |accessdate=November 5, 2007 from [[Internet Archive]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071105073412/http://www.scifi.com/transcripts/2000/herbertandanderson.html |archivedate = 2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Dune: House Harkonnen]]'', the deteriorating Baron at first walks with the assistance of a cane, then relies on belt-mounted suspensors to retain mobility. He consults numerous doctors in the expanse of time between the ''[[Dune: House Atreides]]'' and ''Dune: House Harkonnen'', up to and including his future instrument Dr. Yueh, all of whom are ultimately no help.  To conceal this debilitation, he pretends that his obesity is due to intentional overindulgence, lest the [[Landsraad]] remove him from power. When he determines that Mohiam inflicted him with the disease, he attempts to coerce her into revealing the cure, but soon discovers that there is none.

The Baron, Duke Leto, and Jessica herself are unaware that Jessica is secretly the Baron's daughter or that he has even fathered one; in the year 10,176, the Baron's grandson Paul is born to Leto and Jessica.

=== ''Hunters of Dune'' ===
In ''[[Hunters of Dune]]'' (2006), the continuation of the original series by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, the Baron is resurrected as a ghola (5,029 years after the death of Alia) by the [[Lost Tleilaxu]] [[Uxtal]], acting on orders from the [[Face Dancer]] [[Khrone]]. Khrone intends to use the Baron ghola to manipulate a ghola of Paul Atreides, named [[Paolo (Dune)|Paolo]]. Khrone tries various torture techniques for three years to awaken the 12-year-old Baron's genetic memories; these methods fail due to the Baron's [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] nature. Khrone finds with success when he imprisons the Baron in a sensory deprivation tank for a prolonged period; the Baron's memories for his former life return. Ironically, the reincarnated Baron is soon haunted by the voice of Alia in his mind.

==In adaptations ==
In [[David Lynch]]'s [[Dune (film)|1984 film]], Baron Harkonnen was portrayed by [[Kenneth McMillan (actor)|Kenneth McMillan]]. In this characterization, he is grotesquely overweight, dressed in filthy garments and covered in large, black [[pustule]]s which require constant draining and treatment. This version of the character is more overtly unstable than in the novel, screaming and laughing incoherently at any given moment and even drinking the blood of a servant after removing a &quot;heart plug.&quot; 

British actor [[Ian McNeice]]'s interpretation of the Baron in the 2000 [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Frank Herbert's Dune]]'' (and its [[sequel]], 2003's ''[[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune|Children of Dune]]'') is, though dramatic, somewhat lighter and more eloquent in comparison to Lynch's version, and therefore more consistent with the novel. Though the Baron still takes [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] enjoyment in the suffering of others, he is portrayed as somewhat flamboyant, pompous and self-indulgent, with a tendency to speak in iambic pentameter when the mood strikes him.

Though Herbert's novel ''Dune'' seems to describe Harkonnen's suspensor belt as simply enabling him to stand and walk upright rather than actually &quot;fly,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Suspensors&quot;/&gt; both the 1984 film and the 2000 miniseries feature the Baron utilizing the suspensors to levitate off the ground and float through the air in a flying-like manner.  The later ''Prelude to Dune'' prequels also employ this floating ability. Herbert does, however, note Harkonnen floating slightly off the floor after he is killed. &lt;ref name=&quot;Floating&quot;&gt;From ''Dune'': &quot;He rolled sideways in his suspensors, a sagging mass of flesh supported inches off the floor with head lolling and mouth hanging open.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
The video game ''[[Emperor: Battle for Dune]]'', whose in-game [[cut scene]]s are visually inspired by David Lynch's film, features a character named Baron Rakan Harkonnen, portrayed by [[Michael McShane]]. This Harkonnen is nearly identical to the film's version of Vladimir in both appearance (minus the belt-mounted suspensors) and personality, and also dies by poisoning.

'''Piter De Vries''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[Dune universe|''Dune'' universe]] created by [[Frank Herbert]]. He is featured in 1965's ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', the original novel in the [[science fiction]] series, as well as the ''[[Prelude to Dune]]'' [[prequel]] [[trilogy]] (1999–2001) by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]].

In [[David Lynch]]'s [[1984 in film|1984]] [[Dune (film)|adaptation of the first novel]], De Vries was played by [[Brad Dourif]]. He was portrayed by [[Jan Unger]] in the 2000 [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] [[Frank Herbert's Dune|''Dune'' miniseries]].

== Character ==
In the service of [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]], De Vries is a [[Mentat]] &amp;mdash; a human specially trained to perform mental functions rivaling computers (which are forbidden universe-wide). De Vries is particularly useful to the Baron because he has been &quot;twisted&quot;, or made into an amoral [[Sadomasochism|sadist]] by his [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] creators. This makes him an ideal candidate to be the Baron's [[torture]]r.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Herbert |title=[[Dune (novel)|Dune]] |year=1965 |publisher= |isbn= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Vries' loyalty to his master is unusual in that he continues to serve the Baron with great enthusiasm even though his Mentat abilities and great intelligence confirm his suspicions that his master plans to eventually kill him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune&quot;/&gt; As he says in ''Dune'':
{{quote|But you see, Baron, I know as a Mentat when you will send the executioner. You will hold back just so long as I am useful. To move sooner would be wasteful and I'm yet of much use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune&quot;/&gt;}}

==''Dune''==
[[File:Mentat Piter DeVries.gif|thumb|left|150px|&lt;center&gt;Piter De Vries from ''[[The Dune Encyclopedia]]'']]
In ''Dune'', it is established that De Vries had pioneered a type of toxin called &quot;[[residual poison]]&quot; which remains in the body for years and requires an [[antidote]] to be administered regularly. One such fatal poison is secretly administered by the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnens]] to [[Thufir Hawat]], the Mentat of [[House Atreides]], in order to keep Hawat's allegiance as the only provider of the antidote&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune&quot;/&gt; (in the 1984 movie version, it is shown that Hawat has to milk a gruesome captive cat for the antidote every day).

De Vries is generally regarded as architect of the plan to destroy House Atreides, long-time enemy of the Harkonnens, while restoring the Baron's stewardship over the planet [[Arrakis]]. [[Wellington Yueh]], the Atreides [[Suk School|Suk doctor]] who betrays [[Leto Atreides I|Duke Leto Atreides]], gives the captured Leto a false tooth containing a poisonous gas. When the tooth is crushed, intended victim Baron Harkonnen escapes, but Leto and De Vries die.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune&quot;/&gt;

==''Prelude to Dune''==
In ''[[Dune: House Corrino]]'' (published in 2001 and the third novel in the ''Prelude to Dune'' prequel series by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson), Piter De Vries discovers the Harkonnen heritage of [[Lady Jessica]] and her newborn son [[Paul Atreides|Paul]], and attempts to kidnap and ransom the infant.
The plot is thwarted and the secret preserved - the [[Reverend Mother (Dune)|Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]] kills the Mentat and arranges for his corpse to be shipped home to [[Giedi Prime]]. An enraged Baron is left with no choice but to order a duplicate from the Bene Tleilax: the Mentat De Vries featured in Herbert's original novel ''Dune''.&lt;ref name=&quot;House Corrino&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Brian |authorlink=Brian Herbert |coauthors=Kevin J.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman key exchange''' ('''D&amp;ndash;H''')&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Synonyms of Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman key exchange include:
*'''Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman key agreement'''
*'''Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman key establishment'''
*'''Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman key negotiation'''
*'''Exponential key exchange'''
*'''Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman protocol'''
*'''Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman handshake'''&lt;/ref&gt; is a specific method of exchanging keys.  It is one of the earliest practical examples of [[key exchange]] implemented within the field of [[cryptography]].  The Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman key exchange method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret [[key (cryptography)|key]] over an insecure [[communication]]s channel. This key can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a [[symmetric key]] [[cipher]].

The scheme was first published by [[Whitfield Diffie]] and [[Martin Hellman]] in 1976, although it later emerged that it had been separately invented a few years earlier within [[GCHQ]], the British signals intelligence agency, by [[Malcolm J. Williamson]] but was kept classified. In 2002, Hellman suggested the algorithm be called '''Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman&amp;ndash;Merkle key exchange''' in recognition of [[Ralph Merkle]]'s contribution to the invention of [[public-key cryptography]] (Hellman, 2002).

Although Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman key agreement itself is an ''anonymous'' (non-''authenticated'') [[key-agreement protocol]], it provides the basis for a variety of authenticated protocols, and is used to provide [[perfect forward secrecy]] in [[Transport Layer Security]]'s ephemeral modes (referred to as EDH or DHE depending on the cipher suite).

==History of the protocol==
The Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman key agreement was invented in 1976 during a collaboration between Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman and was the first practical method for establishing a [[shared secret]] over an unprotected communications channel. [[Ralph Merkle]]'s work on public key distribution was an influence.  [[John Gill (cryptographer)|John Gill]] suggested application of the [[discrete logarithm]] problem.  It had first been invented by [[Malcolm J. Williamson|Malcolm Williamson]] of [[GCHQ]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] some years previously, but GCHQ chose not to make it public until 1997, by which time it had no influence on research in [[academia]].

The method was followed shortly afterwards by [[RSA]], another implementation of public key cryptography using [[Public-key cryptography|asymmetric algorithms]].

In 2002, Martin Hellman wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The system...has since become known as Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman key exchange.  While that system was first described in a paper by Diffie and me, it is a public key distribution system, a concept developed by Merkle, and hence should be called 'Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman&amp;ndash;Merkle key exchange' if names are to be associated with it.  I hope this small pulpit might help in that endeavor to recognize Merkle's equal contribution to the invention of public key cryptography. [http://www.comsoc.org/livepubs/ci1/public/anniv/pdfs/hellman.pdf]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{US patent|4,200,770}}, now expired, describes the algorithm and credits Hellman, Diffie, and Merkle as inventors.

==Description==
Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman establishes a shared secret that can be used for secret communications by exchanging data over a public network.

Here is an explanation which includes the encryption's mathematics: 

[[Image:DiffieHellman.png|center|thumb|600px|Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman key exchange]]

The simplest, and original, implementation of the protocol uses the [[Multiplicative group of integers modulo n|multiplicative group of integers modulo]] ''p'', where ''p'' is [[prime number|prime]] and ''g'' is [[primitive root modulo n|primitive root]] mod ''p''. Here is an example of the protocol, with non-secret values in &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;, and secret values in '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;boldface red&lt;/span&gt;''':

This is because &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;*&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt; is the same as &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;*&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;.

#* '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;''' = &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;6*15&lt;/span&gt;'''&lt;/sup&gt; mod &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;

#* '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;''' = &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;807,793,566,946,316,088,741,610,050,849,573,099,185,363,389,551,639,556,884,765,625&lt;/span&gt; mod &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
#* '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;''' = '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;'''

Both Alice and Bob have arrived at the same value, because (''g&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'')''&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;'' and (''g&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;'')''&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'' are equal mod ''p''.  Note that only ''a'', ''b'' and ''g&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt; = g&lt;sup&gt;ba&lt;/sup&gt;'' mod ''p'' are kept secret.  All the other values &amp;ndash; ''p'', ''g'', ''g&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; mod p'', and ''g&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; mod p'' &amp;ndash; are sent in the clear.  Once Alice and Bob compute the shared secret they can use it as an encryption key, known only to them, for sending messages across the same open communications channel.
Of course, much larger values of ''a'', ''b'', and ''p'' would be needed to make this example secure, since it is easy to try all the possible values of ''g&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;'' mod 23. There are only 23 possible integers as the result of mod 23. If ''p'' were a prime of at least 300 digits, and ''a'' and ''b'' were at least 100 digits long, then even the best algorithms known today could not find ''a'' given only ''g'', ''p'', ''g&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;'' mod ''p'' and ''g&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'' mod ''p'', even using all of mankind's computing power. The problem is known as the [[discrete logarithm problem]].  Note that ''g'' need not be large at all, and in practice is usually either 2 or 5.

Here's a more general description of the protocol:

# Alice and Bob agree on a finite [[cyclic group]] ''G'' and a [[Generating set of a group|generating]] element ''g'' in ''G''.  (This is usually done long before the rest of the protocol; ''g'' is assumed to be known by all attackers.) We will write the group ''G'' multiplicatively.
# Alice picks a random [[natural number]] ''a'' and sends ''g&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'' to Bob.
# Bob picks a random natural number ''b'' and sends ''g&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;'' to Alice.
# Alice computes (''g&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;'')''&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;''.
# Bob computes (''g&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'')''&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;''.

Both Alice and Bob are now in possession of the group element ''g&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;'', which can serve as the shared secret key. The values of (''g&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;'')''&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'' and (''g&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'')''&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;'' are the same because groups are [[Power-associativity|power associative]].  (See also [[exponentiation]].)

In order to decrypt a message ''m'', sent as ''mg&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;'', Bob (or Alice) must first compute ''(g&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;'', as follows:

Bob knows ''|G|, b,'' and ''g&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;''.  A result from group theory establishes that from the construction of G, ''x&lt;sup&gt;|G|&lt;/sup&gt; = 1'' for all ''x'' in ''G''.

Bob then calculates ''(g&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;|G|-b&lt;/sup&gt; = g&lt;sup&gt;a(|G|-b)&lt;/sup&gt; = g&lt;sup&gt;a|G|-ab&lt;/sup&gt; = g&lt;sup&gt;a|G|&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sup&gt;-ab&lt;/sup&gt; = (g&lt;sup&gt;|G|&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sup&gt;-ab&lt;/sup&gt;=1&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sup&gt;-ab&lt;/sup&gt;=g&lt;sup&gt;-ab&lt;/sup&gt;=(g&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.''

When Alice sends Bob the encrypted message, ''mg&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;'', Bob applies ''(g&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;'' and recovers ''mg&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;(g&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = m(1) = m.''

Note: It should be difficult for Alice to solve for Bob's private key or for Bob to solve for Alice's private key. If it is not difficult for Alice to solve for Bob's private key (or vice versa), Eve may simply substitute her own private / public key pair, plug Bob's public key into her private key, produce a fake shared secret key, and solve for Bob's private key (and use that to solve for the shared secret key. Eve may attempt to choose a public / private key pair that will make it easy for her to solve for Bob's private key). A demonstration of Diffie-Hellman (using numbers too small for practical use) is given [http://buchananweb.co.uk/security02.aspx here]

==Security==
The protocol is considered secure against eavesdroppers if ''G'' and ''g'' are chosen properly.  The eavesdropper (&quot;[[Alice and Bob|Eve]]&quot;) would have to solve the [[Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman problem]] to obtain ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt;.  This is currently considered difficult.  An efficient algorithm to solve the [[discrete logarithm problem]] would make it easy to compute ''a'' or ''b'' and solve the Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman problem, making this and many other public key cryptosystems insecure.

The [[Glossary of group theory|order]] of ''G'' should be prime or have a large prime factor to prevent use of the [[Pohlig&amp;ndash;Hellman algorithm]] to obtain ''a'' or ''b''.  For this reason, a [[Sophie Germain prime]] ''q'' is sometimes used to calculate ''p=2q+1'', called a [[safe prime]], since the order of ''G'' is then only divisible by 2 and ''q''.  ''g'' is then sometimes chosen to generate the order ''q'' subgroup of ''G'', rather than ''G'', so that the [[Legendre symbol]] of ''g&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'' never reveals the low order bit of ''a''.

If Alice and Bob use [[random number generator]]s whose outputs are not completely random and can be predicted to some extent, then Eve's task is much easier.

The secret integers ''a'' and ''b'' are discarded at the end of the [[session (computer science)|session]].
Therefore, Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman key exchange by itself trivially achieves [[perfect forward secrecy]] because no long-term private keying material exists to be disclosed.  

In the original description, the Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman exchange by itself does not provide [[authentication]] of the communicating parties and is thus vulnerable to a [[man-in-the-middle attack]]. A person in the middle may establish two distinct Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman key exchanges, one with Alice and the other with Bob, effectively masquerading as Alice to Bob, and vice versa, allowing the attacker to decrypt (and read or store) then re-encrypt the messages passed between them. A method to authenticate the communicating parties to each other is generally needed to prevent this type of attack.  Variants of Diffie-Hellman, such as [[Station-to-Station protocol|STS]], may be used instead to avoid these types of attacks.

==Other uses==

===Password-authenticated key agreement===

When Alice and Bob share a password, they may use a [[password-authenticated key agreement]] (PAKE) form of Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.  One simple scheme is to make the generator ''g'' the password.  A feature of these schemes is that an attacker can only test one specific password on each iteration with the other party, and so the system provides good security with relatively weak passwords.  This approach is described in [[ITU-T]] Recommendation [[X.1035]], which is used by the [[G.hn]] home networking standard.

===Public Key===
It is also possible to use Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman as part of a [[public key infrastructure]].  Alice's public key is simply &lt;math&gt;(g^a, g, p)&lt;/math&gt;.  To send her a message Bob chooses a random ''b'', and then sends Alice &lt;math&gt;g^b&lt;/math&gt; (un-encrypted) together with the message encrypted with symmetric key &lt;math&gt;(g^a)^b&lt;/math&gt;.  Only Alice can decrypt the message because only she has ''a''.  A preshared public key also prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.

In practice, Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman is not used in this way, with RSA being the dominant public key algorithm.  This is largely for historical and commercial reasons, namely that RSA created a Certificate Authority that became [[Verisign]].  Diffie&amp;ndash;Hellman cannot be used to sign certificates, although the [[ElGamal]] and [[Digital Signature Algorithm|DSA]] signature algorithms are related to it.  However, it is related to [[MQV]], [[Station-to-Station protocol|STS]] and the [[Internet key exchange|IKE]] component of the [[IPsec]] protocol suite for securing [[Internet Protocol]] communications.

'''''Destry Rides Again''''' is a 1939 [[Western (genre)|western]] directed by George Marshall, starring [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[James Stewart]], [[Mischa Auer]], [[Charles Winninger]], [[Brian Donlevy]], [[Allen Jenkins]], [[Irene Hervey]], [[Billy Gilbert]], [[Bill Cody, Jr.]] and [[Una Merkel]]. The original Max Brand novel was translated into an &quot;oater&quot; with the town of Bottleneck set on a Hollywood sound stage.

In 1996, ''Destry Rides Again'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Saloon owner Kent ([[Brian Donlevy]]), the unscrupulous boss of the fictional [[Wild West|Western]] town of Bottleneck, has the town's Sheriff, Keogh, killed when the Sheriff asks one too many questions about a rigged poker game. Kent and &quot;Frenchy&quot; ([[Marlene Dietrich]]), his girlfriend and the dance hall queen, now have a stranglehold over the local cattle ranchers. The crooked town's mayor, Hiram J. Slade ([[Samuel S. Hinds]]), who is in collusion with Kent, appoints the town drunk, Washington Dimsdale ([[Charles Winninger]]), as the new sheriff, assuming that he'll be easy to control and manipulate. But what the mayor doesn't know is that Dimsdale was a deputy under the famous lawman, Tom Destry and is able to call upon the equally formidable Tom Destry, Jr. (James Stewart) to help him make Bottleneck a lawful, respectable town. 

Destry confounds the townsfolk by refusing to strap on a gun in spite of demonstrating that he is an expert marksman. He still carries out the &quot;letter of the law&quot;, as deputy Sheriff, and wins over their respect. A final confrontation between Destry and Kent's gang is inevitable, but &quot;Frenchy&quot; is won over by Destry and changes sides. A final gunfight ensues where Frenchy is killed in the [[crossfire]], and the rule of law wins the day.

==Songs==
Marlene Dietrich as Frenchy performs the songs ''[[See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have]]'' and ''You've Got That Look'', written by [[Frank Loesser]], set to music by [[Frederick Hollander]], which have become classics.

==Production==
Famed Western writer, [[Max Brand]] contributed the novel, ''[[Destry Rides Again (novel)|Destry Rides Again]]'', but the film also owes its origins to Brand's serial &quot;Twelve Peers&quot;, published in a pulp-magazine. In the original work, Harrison (or &quot;Harry&quot;) Destry was not a pacifist. As filmed in 1932, with [[Tom Mix]] in the starring role, the central role differed in that Destry did wear six-guns in that version.

==Reception==
''Destry Rides Again'' was generally well accepted by the public, as well as critics. It was reviewed by Frank S. Nugent in the ''[[New York Times]],'' who noted that the film did not follow the usual Hollywood type-casting. On Dietrich's role, he characterized, &quot;It's difficult to reconcile Miss Dietrich's Frenchy, the cabaret girl of the Bloody Gulch Saloon, with the posed and posturing Dietrich we last saw in Mr. Lubitsch's 'Angel'.&quot; Stewart's contribution was similarly treated, &quot;turning in an easy, likable, pleasantly humored performance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nugent, Frank S.

[[File:Tangent to a curve.svg|thumb|200px|width=150|length=150|The graph of a function, drawn in black, and a [[tangent line]] to that function, drawn in red.  The slope of the tangent line is equal to the derivative of the function at the marked point.]]
{{Calculus|cTopic=Differentiation}}
In [[calculus]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''derivative''' is a measure of how a [[function (mathematics)|function]] changes as its input changes. Loosely speaking, a derivative can be thought of as how much one quantity is changing in response to changes in some other quantity; for example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object's instantaneous [[velocity]] (conversely, integrating a car's velocity over time yields the distance traveled).

The derivative of a function at a chosen input value describes the best [[linear approximation]] of the function near that input value. For a [[real-valued function]] of a single real variable, the derivative at a point equals the [[slope]] of the [[tangent line]] to the [[graph of a function|graph of the function]] at that point.  In higher dimensions, the derivative of a function at a point is a [[linear transformation]] called the [[linearization]].&lt;ref&gt;Differential calculus, as discussed in this article, is a very well-established mathematical discipline for which there are many sources. Almost all of the material in this article can be found in Apostol 1967, Apostol 1969, and Spivak 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; A closely related notion is the [[differential of a function]].

The process of finding a derivative is called '''differentiation'''. The reverse process is called '''[[antiderivative|antidifferentiation]]'''.  The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] states that antidifferentiation is the same as [[integral|integration]]. Differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-variable calculus.

==Differentiation and the derivative==
[[File:Graph of sliding derivative line.gif|left|thumb|400px|(Click for larger image) At each point, the derivative of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f(x)=1 + x\sin x^2&lt;/math&gt; is the [[slope]] of a [[Line (geometry)|line]] that is [[tangent]] to the [[curve]]. The line is always tangent to the blue curve; its slope is the derivative. Note derivative is [[positive number|positive]] where green, [[negative number|negative]] where red, and [[zero (number)|zero]] where black.]]

'''Differentiation''' is a method to compute the rate at which a dependent output ''y'' changes with respect to the change in the independent input ''x''. This rate of change is called the '''derivative''' of ''y'' with respect to ''x''. In more precise language, the dependence of ''y'' upon ''x'' means that ''y'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of ''x''. This functional relationship is often denoted ''y'' = ''ƒ''(''x''), where ''ƒ'' denotes the function. If ''x'' and ''y'' are [[real number]]s, and if the [[graph of a function|graph]] of ''y'' is plotted against ''x'', the derivative measures the [[slope]] of this graph at each point.

The simplest case is when ''y'' is a [[linear function]] of ''x'', meaning that the graph of ''y'' against ''x'' is a straight line. In this case, ''y'' = ''ƒ''(''x'') = ''m'' ''x'' + ''b'', for real numbers ''m'' and ''b'', and the slope ''m'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;m={\mbox{change in } y \over \mbox{change in } x} = {\Delta y \over{\Delta x}}&lt;/math&gt;
where the symbol Δ (the uppercase form of the Greek letter [[Delta (letter)|Delta]]) is an abbreviation for &quot;change in.&quot; This formula is true because
:''y'' + &amp;Delta;''y'' = ''&amp;fnof;''(''x''+ &amp;Delta;''x'') = ''m'' (''x'' + &amp;Delta;''x'') + ''b'' = ''m'' ''x'' + ''b'' + ''m'' &amp;Delta;''x'' = ''y'' + ''m''&amp;Delta;''x''.
It follows that Δ''y'' = ''m'' Δ''x''.

This gives an exact value for the slope of a straight line.
If the function ''ƒ'' is not linear (i.e. its graph is not a straight line), however, then the change in ''y'' divided by the change in ''x'' varies: differentiation is a method to find an exact value for this rate of change at any given value of ''x''.

The idea, illustrated by Figures 1-3, is to compute the rate of change as the [[limit of a function|limiting value]] of the [[difference quotient|ratio of the differences]] Δ''y'' / Δ''x'' as Δ''x'' becomes infinitely small.

In [[Leibniz's notation]], such an [[infinitesimal]] change in ''x'' is denoted by ''dx'', and the derivative of ''y'' with respect to ''x'' is written
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
suggesting the ratio of two infinitesimal quantities.  (The above expression is read as &quot;the derivative of ''y'' with respect to ''x''&quot;, &quot;d y by d x&quot;, or &quot;d y over d x&quot;. The oral form &quot;d y d x&quot; is often used conversationally, although it may lead to confusion.)

The most common approach&lt;ref&gt;Spivak 1994, chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt; to turn this intuitive idea into a precise definition uses limits, but there are other methods, such as [[non-standard analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Differential (infinitesimal)]] for an overview. Further approaches include the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem]], and the universal derivation (see [[Kähler differential]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition via difference quotients===
Let ''ƒ'' be a real valued function.  In classical geometry, the tangent line to the graph of the function ''ƒ'' at a real number ''a'' was the unique line through the point (''a'', ''ƒ''(''a'')) that did ''not'' meet the graph of ''ƒ'' [[transversality (mathematics)|transversally]], meaning that the line did not pass straight through the graph.  The derivative of ''y'' with respect to ''x'' at ''a'' is, geometrically, the slope of the tangent line to the graph of ''ƒ'' at ''a''.  The slope of the tangent line is very close to the slope of the line through (''a'', ''ƒ''(''a'')) and a nearby point on the graph, for example {{nowrap|(''a'' + ''h'', ''ƒ''(''a'' + ''h''))}}.  These lines are called [[secant line]]s.  A value of ''h'' close to zero gives a good approximation to the slope of the tangent line, and smaller values (in [[absolute value]]) of ''h'' will, in general, give better [[approximation]]s.  The slope ''m'' of the secant line is the difference between the ''y'' values of these points divided by the difference between the ''x'' values, that is, 

:&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;

This expression is [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[difference quotient]]. The derivative is the value of the difference quotient as the secant lines approach the tangent line.  Formally, the '''derivative''' of the function ''ƒ'' at ''a'' is the [[limit of a function|limit]]

:&lt;math&gt;f'(a)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

of the difference quotient as ''h'' approaches zero, if this limit exists.  If the limit exists, then ''ƒ'' is '''[[differentiable function|differentiable]]''' at ''a''.  Here ''ƒ''&amp;prime; (''a'') is one of several common notations for the derivative ([[Derivative#Notations for differentiation|see below]]).

Equivalently, the derivative satisfies the property that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to 0}{f(a+h)-f(a) - f'(a)\cdot h\over h} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
which has the intuitive interpretation (see Figure 1) that the tangent line to ''ƒ'' at ''a'' gives the ''best [[linear]] approximation''
:&lt;math&gt;f(a+h) \approx f(a) + f'(a)h&lt;/math&gt;
to ''ƒ'' near ''a'' (i.e., for small ''h''). This interpretation is the easiest to generalize to other settings ([[Derivative#The total derivative, the total differential and the Jacobian|see below]]).

[[Substitution property of equality|Substituting]] 0 for ''h'' in the difference quotient causes [[division by zero]], so the slope of the tangent line cannot be found directly using this method.  Instead, define ''Q''(''h'') to be the difference quotient as a function of ''h'':

:&lt;math&gt;Q(h) = \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;

''Q''(''h'') is the slope of the secant line between (''a'', ''ƒ''(''a'')) and (''a'' + ''h'', ''ƒ''(''a'' + ''h'')).  If ''ƒ'' is a [[continuous function]], meaning that its graph is an unbroken curve with no gaps, then ''Q'' is a continuous function away from the point ''h''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  If the limit &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\lim_{h\to 0} Q(h)&lt;/math&gt; exists, meaning that there is a way of choosing a value for ''Q''(0) that makes the graph of ''Q'' a continuous function, then the function ''ƒ'' is differentiable at the point ''a'', and its derivative at ''a'' equals ''Q''(0).

In practice, the existence of a continuous extension of the difference quotient ''Q''(''h'') to ''h''&amp;nbsp;= 0 is shown by modifying the numerator to cancel ''h'' in the denominator. This process can be long and tedious for complicated functions, and many shortcuts are commonly used to simplify the process.

===Example===
The squaring function ''ƒ''(''x'') = ''x''² is differentiable at ''x'' = 3, and its derivative there is 6. This result is established by calculating the limit as ''h'' approaches zero of the difference quotient of ''ƒ''(3):

:&lt;math&gt;f'(3)= \lim_{h\to 0}{f(3+h)-f(3)\over h} = \lim_{h\to 0}{(3+h)^2 - 9\over{h}} = \lim_{h\to 0}{9 + 6h + h^2 - 9\over{h}} = \lim_{h\to 0}{6h + h^2\over{h}} = \lim_{h\to 0}{6 + h}. &lt;/math&gt;

Then we calculate the limit by letting ''h'' '''go to''' zero:

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{h\to 0}{6 + h} = 6 + 0 = 6. &lt;/math&gt;

The last expression shows that the difference quotient equals ''6'' + ''h'' when ''h'' ≠ 0 and is undefined when ''h'' = 0, because of the definition of the difference quotient.  However, the definition of the limit says the difference quotient does not need to be defined when ''h'' = 0.  Hence the slope of the graph of the squaring function at the point (3, 9) is 6, and so its derivative at ''x'' = 3 is ''ƒ'' '(3) = 6.

More generally, a similar computation shows that the derivative of the squaring function at ''x'' = ''a'' is ''ƒ'' '(''a'') = 2''a''.

===Continuity and differentiability===
[[File:Right-continuous.svg|thumb|right|This function does not have a derivative at the marked point, as the function is not continuous there.]]
If ''y'' = ''ƒ''(''x'') is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] at ''a'', then ''ƒ'' must also be [[continuous function|continuous]] at ''a''.  As an example, choose a point ''a'' and let ''ƒ'' be the [[step function]] that returns a value, say 1, for all ''x'' less than ''a'', and returns a different value, say 10, for all ''x'' greater than or equal to ''a''.  ''ƒ'' cannot have a derivative at ''a''.  If ''h'' is negative, then ''a'' + ''h'' is on the low part of the step, so the secant line from ''a'' to ''a'' + ''h'' is very steep, and as ''h'' tends to zero the slope tends to infinity.  If ''h'' is positive, then ''a'' + ''h'' is on the high part of the step, so the secant line from ''a'' to ''a'' + ''h'' has slope zero.  Consequently the secant lines do not approach any single slope, so the limit of the difference quotient does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Despite this, it is still possible to take the derivative in the sense of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]].  The result is nine times the [[Dirac measure]] centered at ''a''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Absolute value.svg|right|thumb|The absolute value function is continuous, but fails to be differentiable at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 since the tangent slopes do not approach the same value from the left as they do from the right.]]However, even if a function is continuous at a point, it may not be differentiable there.  For example, the [[absolute value]] function ''y'' = |''x''| is continuous at ''x'' = 0, but it is not differentiable there.  If ''h'' is positive, then the slope of the secant line from ''0'' to ''h'' is one, whereas if ''h'' is negative, then the slope of the secant line from ''0'' to ''h'' is negative one.  This can be seen graphically as a &quot;kink&quot; or a &quot;cusp&quot; in the graph at ''x'' = 0.  Even a function with a smooth graph is not differentiable at a point where its [[Vertical tangent|tangent is vertical]]: For instance, the function ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;√&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:overline&quot;&gt;''x''&lt;/span&gt; is not differentiable at ''x'' = 0.

In summary: for a function ''ƒ'' to have a derivative it is ''[[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary]]'' for the function ''ƒ'' to be continuous, but continuity alone is not ''[[Necessary and sufficient conditions|sufficient]]''.

Most functions that occur in practice have derivatives at all points or at [[Almost everywhere|almost every]] point.  Early in the history of calculus, many mathematicians assumed that a continuous function was differentiable at most points.  Under mild conditions, for example if the function is a [[monotone function]] or a [[Lipschitz function]], this is true.  However, in 1872 Weierstrass found the first example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere.  This example is now known as the [[Weierstrass function]].  In 1931, [[Stefan Banach]] proved that the set of functions that have a derivative at some point is a [[meager set]] in the space of all continuous functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Banach, S.|title=Uber die Baire'sche Kategorie gewisser Funktionenmengen|journal=Studia. Math.|issue=3|year=1931|pages=174–179|postscript=.}}.  Cited by {{Citation|author=Hewitt, E and Stromberg, K|title=Real and abstract analysis|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1963|pages=Theorem 17.8|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informally, this means that hardly any continuous functions have a derivative at even one point.

===The derivative as a function===

Let ''ƒ'' be a function that has a derivative at every point ''a'' in the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of ''ƒ''.  Because every point ''a'' has a derivative, there is a function that sends the point ''a'' to the derivative of ''ƒ'' at ''a''.  This function is written ''f&amp;prime;(x)'' and is called the ''derivative function'' or the ''derivative'' of ''ƒ''.  The derivative of ''ƒ'' collects all the derivatives of ''ƒ'' at all the points in the domain of ''ƒ''.

Sometimes ''ƒ'' has a derivative at most, but not all, points of its domain.  The function whose value at ''a'' equals ''f&amp;prime;(a)'' whenever ''f&amp;prime;(a)'' is defined and elsewhere is undefined is also called the derivative of ''ƒ''.  It is still a function, but its domain is strictly smaller than the domain of ''ƒ''.

Using this idea, differentiation becomes a function of functions: The derivative is an [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] whose domain is the set of all functions that have derivatives at every point of their domain and whose range is a set of functions.  If we denote this operator by ''D'', then ''D''(''ƒ'') is the function ''f&amp;prime;''(''x'').  Since ''D''(''ƒ'') is a function, it can be evaluated at a point ''a''.  By the definition of the derivative function, ''D''(''ƒ'')(''a'')&amp;nbsp;= ''f&amp;prime;''(''a'').

For comparison, consider the doubling function ''ƒ''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=2''x''; ''ƒ'' is a real-valued function of a real number, meaning that it takes numbers as inputs and has numbers as outputs:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 1 &amp;{}\mapsto 2,\\
 2 &amp;{}\mapsto 4,\\
 3 &amp;{}\mapsto 6.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The operator ''D'', however, is not defined on individual numbers.  It is only defined on functions:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 D(x \mapsto 1) &amp;= (x \mapsto 0),\\
 D(x \mapsto x) &amp;= (x \mapsto 1),\\
 D(x \mapsto x^2) &amp;= (x \mapsto 2\cdot x).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Because the output of ''D'' is a function, the output of ''D'' can be evaluated at a point.  For instance, when ''D'' is applied to the squaring function,
:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x^2,&lt;/math&gt;
''D'' outputs the doubling function,
:&lt;math&gt; x \mapsto 2x ,&lt;/math&gt;
which we named ''ƒ''(''x''). This output function can then be evaluated to get ''ƒ''(1)&amp;nbsp;= 2, ''ƒ''(2)&amp;nbsp;= 4, and so on.

===Higher derivatives===
Let ''ƒ'' be a differentiable function, and let ''f&amp;prime;(x)'' be its derivative. The derivative of {{nowrap|''f&amp;prime;(x)''}} (if it has one) is written {{nowrap|''f&amp;prime;&amp;prime;(x)''}} and is called the '''[[second derivative]] of ''ƒ'''''.  Similarly, the derivative of a second derivative, if it exists, is written {{nowrap|''f&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;(x)''}} and is called the '''third derivative of ''ƒ'''''.  These repeated derivatives are called ''higher-order derivatives''.

If ''x''(''t'') represents the position of an object at time ''t'', then the higher-order derivatives of ''x'' have physical interpretations.  The second derivative of ''x'' is the derivative of ''x''&amp;prime;(''t''), the velocity, and by definition this is the object's [[acceleration]]. The third derivative of ''x'' is defined to be the [[jerk (physics)|jerk]], and the fourth derivative is defined to be the [[jounce]].

A function ''ƒ'' need not have a derivative, for example, if it is not continuous.  Similarly, even if ''ƒ'' does have a derivative, it may not have a second derivative.  For example, let
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases} x^2, &amp; \mbox{if }x\ge 0 \\ -x^2, &amp; \mbox{if }x \le 0.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
Calculation shows that ''ƒ'' is a differentiable function whose derivative is
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \begin{cases} 2x, &amp; \mbox{if }x\ge 0 \\ -2x, &amp; \mbox{if }x \le 0.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
{{nowrap|''f&amp;prime;(x)''}} is twice the absolute value function, and it does not have a derivative at zero.  Similar examples show that a function can have ''k'' derivatives for any non-negative integer ''k'' but no ''(k + 1)''-order derivative.  A function that has ''k'' successive derivatives is called '''''k'' times differentiable'''.  If in addition the ''k''th derivative is continuous, then the function is said to be of [[differentiability class]] ''C&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''.  (This is a stronger condition than having ''k'' derivatives.  For an example, see [[differentiability class]].)  A function that has infinitely many derivatives is called '''infinitely differentiable''' or '''[[smooth function|smooth]]'''.

On the real line, every [[polynomial function]] is infinitely differentiable.  By standard [[differentiation rules]], if a polynomial of degree ''n'' is differentiated ''n'' times, then it becomes a [[constant function]].  All of its subsequent derivatives are identically zero.  In particular, they exist, so polynomials are smooth functions.

The derivatives of a function ''ƒ'' at a point ''x'' provide polynomial approximations to that function near ''x''. For example, if ''ƒ'' is twice differentiable, then
:&lt;math&gt; f(x+h) \approx f(x) + f'(x)h + \tfrac12 f''(x) h^2&lt;/math&gt;
in the sense that
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h) - f(x) - f'(x)h - \frac12 f''(x) h^2}{h^2}=0.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''ƒ'' is infinitely differentiable, then this is the beginning of the [[Taylor series]] for ''ƒ''.

A point where the second derivative of a function changes sign is called an '''inflection point'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apostol|1967|loc=§4.18}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an inflection point, the second derivative may be zero, as in the case of the inflection point ''x''=0 of the function ''y''=''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, or it may fail to exist, as in the case of the inflection point ''x''=0 of the function ''y''=''x''&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;. At an inflection point, a function switches from being a [[convex function]] to being a [[concave function]] or vice versa.

==Notations for differentiation==

{{Main|Notation for differentiation}}

===Leibniz's notation===

{{Main|Leibniz's notation}}

The notation for derivatives introduced by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] is one of the earliest. It is still commonly used when the equation ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ƒ(''x'') is viewed as a functional relationship between [[dependent and independent variables]]. Then the first derivative is denoted by

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx},\quad\frac{d f}{dx}(x),\;\;\mathrm{or}\;\; \frac{d}{dx}f(x),&lt;/math&gt;

and was once thought of as an [[infinitesimal]] quotient.  Higher derivatives are expressed using the notation

&lt;!-- In the following formula, the function is a lower-case f, not an upper case F.  Please do not change it.--&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^ny}{dx^n},
\quad\frac{d^n f}{dx^n}(x),
\;\;\mathrm{or}\;\;
\frac{d^n}{dx^n}f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for the ''n''th derivative of ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ƒ(''x'') (with respect to ''x''). These are abbreviations for multiple applications of the derivative operator. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

With Leibniz's notation, we can write the derivative of ''y'' at the point ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a'' in two different ways:

: &lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{dy}{dx}\right|_{x=a} = \frac{dy}{dx}(a).&lt;/math&gt;

Leibniz's notation allows one to specify the variable for differentiation (in the denominator). This is especially relevant for [[partial derivative|partial differentiation]].  It also makes the [[chain rule]] easy to remember:&lt;ref&gt;In the formulation of calculus in terms of limits, the ''du'' symbol has been assigned various meanings by various authors.  Some authors do not assign a meaning to ''du'' by itself, but only as part of the symbol ''du''/''dx''.  Others define &quot;dx&quot; as an independent variable, and define ''du'' by ''du''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''dx''•&amp;fnof;&amp;prime; (''x'').  In [[non-standard analysis]] ''du'' is defined as an infinitesimal. It is also interpreted as the [[exterior derivative]] d''u'' of a function ''u''. See [[differential (infinitesimal)]] for further information.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Lagrange's notation===
Sometimes referred to as '''prime notation''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/wwmath/calculus/differentiation/notation.html]&lt;/ref&gt; one of the most common modern notations for differentiation is due to [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] and uses the [[Prime (symbol)|prime mark]], so that the derivative of a function ƒ(''x'') is denoted ƒ&amp;prime;(''x'') or simply ƒ&amp;prime;. Similarly, the second and third derivatives are denoted
:&lt;math&gt;(f')'=f''\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; and &amp;emsp; &lt;math&gt;(f'')'=f'''.\,&lt;/math&gt;
To denote the number of derivatives beyond this point, some authors use Roman numerals in [[Subscript and superscript|superscript]], whereas others place the number in parentheses:
:&lt;math&gt;f^{\mathrm{iv}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; or &amp;emsp; &lt;math&gt;f^{(4)}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The latter notation generalizes to yield the notation ƒ&lt;sup&gt; (''n'')&lt;/sup&gt; for the ''n''th derivative of ƒ — this notation is most useful when we wish to talk about the derivative as being a function itself, as in this case the Leibniz notation can become cumbersome.

===Newton's notation===

{{Main|Newton's notation}}

[[Newton's notation]] for differentiation, also called the dot notation, places a dot over the function name to represent a time derivative.  If ''y'' = ''ƒ''(''t''), then
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{y}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; and &amp;emsp; &lt;math&gt;\ddot{y}&lt;/math&gt;
denote, respectively, the first and second derivatives of ''y'' with respect to ''t''.  This notation is used exclusively for [[time derivative]]s, meaning that the independent variable of the function represents [[time]].  It is very common in [[physics]] and in mathematical disciplines connected with physics such as [[differential equation]]s.  While the notation becomes unmanageable for high-order derivatives, in practice only very few derivatives are needed.

===Euler's notation===

[[Leonhard Euler|Euler]]'s notation uses a [[differential operator]] ''D'', which is applied to a function ''ƒ'' to give the first derivative ''Df''. The second derivative is denoted ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''ƒ'', and the ''n''th derivative is denoted ''D''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''ƒ''.

If ''y'' = ''ƒ''(''x'') is a dependent variable, then often the subscript ''x'' is attached to the ''D'' to clarify the independent variable ''x''.
Euler's notation is then written
:&lt;math&gt;D_x y\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; or &amp;emsp; &lt;math&gt;D_x f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;,
although this subscript is often omitted when the variable ''x'' is understood, for instance when this is the only variable present in the expression.

Euler's notation is useful for stating and solving [[linear differential equation]]s.

==Computing the derivative==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Derivative]] --&gt;

The derivative of a function can, in principle, be computed from the definition by considering the difference quotient, and computing its limit. In practice, once the derivatives of a few simple functions are known, the derivatives of other functions are more easily computed using ''rules'' for obtaining derivatives of more complicated functions from simpler ones.

===Derivatives of elementary functions===

{{Main|Table of derivatives}}

Most derivative computations eventually require taking the derivative of some common functions. The following incomplete list gives some of the most frequently used functions of a single real variable and their derivatives.

* ''[[Calculus with polynomials|Derivatives of powers]]'': if

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = x^r,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is any [[real number]], then

:&lt;math&gt; f'(x) = rx^{r-1},\,&lt;/math&gt;

wherever this function is defined. For example, if &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^{1/4}&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;f'(x) = (1/4)x^{-3/4},\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the derivative function is defined only for positive ''x'', not for {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.  When ''r'' = 0, this rule implies that ''f''&amp;prime;(''x'') is zero for {{nowrap|''x'' &amp;ne; 0}}, which is almost the constant rule (stated below).

&lt;!--DO NOT ADD TO THIS LIST--&gt;
* ''[[Exponential function|Exponential]] and [[logarithm]]ic functions'':
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}a^x = \ln(a)a^x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\ln(x) = \frac{1}{x},\qquad x &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\log_a(x) = \frac{1}{x\ln(a)}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--DO NOT ADD TO THIS LIST--&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\cos(x) = -\sin(x).&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\tan(x) = \sec^2(x) = \frac{1}{\cos^2(x)} = 1+\tan^2(x).&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\arctan(x)= \frac{1}{{1+x^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--DO NOT ADD TO THIS LIST--&gt;

===Rules for finding the derivative===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Difference operator]] --&gt;
{{Main|Differentiation rules}}

In many cases, complicated limit calculations by direct application of Newton's difference quotient can be avoided using differentiation rules. Some of the most basic rules are the following.

* ''Constant rule'': if ''ƒ''(''x'') is constant, then
:&lt;math&gt;f' = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
* ''[[Linearity of differentiation|Sum rule]]'':
:&lt;math&gt;(af + bg)' = af' + bg' \,&lt;/math&gt; for all functions ''&amp;fnof;'' and ''g'' and all real numbers ''a'' and ''b''.
* ''[[Product rule]]'':
:&lt;math&gt;(fg)' = f 'g + fg' \,&lt;/math&gt; for all functions ''&amp;fnof;'' and ''g''.
* ''[[Quotient rule]]'':
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{f}{g} \right)' = \frac{f'g - fg'}{g^2}&lt;/math&gt;  for all functions ''&amp;fnof;'' and ''g'' where ''g'' ≠ 0.
* ''[[Chain rule]]'': If &lt;math&gt;f(x) = h(g(x))&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x) = h'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x). \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Example computation===

The derivative of

: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^4 + \sin (x^2) - \ln(x) e^x + 7\,&lt;/math&gt;

is

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f'(x) &amp;= 4 x^{(4-1)}+ \frac{d\left(x^2\right)}{dx}\cos (x^2) - \frac{d\left(\ln {x}\right)}{dx} e^x - \ln{x} \frac{d\left(e^x\right)}{dx} + 0 \\
      &amp;= 4x^3 + 2x\cos (x^2) - \frac{1}{x} e^x - \ln(x) e^x.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here the second term was computed using the [[chain rule]] and third using the [[product rule]]. The known derivatives of the elementary functions ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, sin(''x''), ln(''x'') and exp(''x'') = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as the constant 7, were also used.

==Derivatives in higher dimensions==

{{See also|Vector calculus|Multivariable calculus}}

===Derivatives of vector valued functions===

A [[vector-valued function]] '''y'''(''t'') of a real variable sends real numbers to vectors in some [[vector space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  A vector-valued function can be split up into its coordinate functions ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), …, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), meaning that '''y'''(''t'') = (''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')).  This includes, for example, [[parametric curve]]s in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  The coordinate functions are real valued functions, so the above definition of derivative applies to them.  The derivative of '''y'''(''t'') is defined to be the [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], called the [[Differential geometry of curves|tangent vector]], whose coordinates are the derivatives of the coordinate functions.  That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}'(t) = (y'_1(t), \ldots, y'_n(t)).&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}'(t)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\mathbf{y}(t+h) - \mathbf{y}(t)}{h},&lt;/math&gt;

if the limit exists.  The subtraction in the numerator is subtraction of vectors, not scalars.  If the derivative of '''y''' exists for every value of ''t'', then '''y&amp;prime;''' is another vector valued function.

If '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the standard basis for '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, then '''y'''(''t'') can also be written as ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + … + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. If we assume that the derivative of a vector-valued function retains the [[linearity of differentiation|linearity]] property, then the derivative of '''y'''(''t'') must be
:&lt;math&gt;y'_1(t)\mathbf{e}_1 + \cdots + y'_n(t)\mathbf{e}_n&lt;/math&gt;
because each of the basis vectors is a constant.

This generalization is useful, for example, if '''y'''(''t'') is the position vector of a particle at time ''t''; then the derivative '''y'''&amp;prime;(''t'') is the [[velocity]] vector of the particle at time ''t''.

===Partial derivatives===

{{Main|Partial derivative}}

Suppose that ''ƒ'' is a function that depends on more than one variable.  For instance,
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.\,&lt;/math&gt;
''ƒ'' can be reinterpreted as a family of functions of one variable indexed by the other variables:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = f_x(y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.\,&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, every value of ''x'' chooses a function, denoted ''f&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', which is a function of one real number.&lt;ref&gt;This can also be expressed as the [[adjoint functors|adjointness]] between the [[product topology|product space]] and [[function space]] constructions.&lt;/ref&gt;  That is,
:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto f_x,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f_x(y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.\,&lt;/math&gt;
Once a value of ''x'' is chosen, say ''a'', then ''f(x,y)'' determines a function ''f&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' that sends ''y'' to ''a''² + ay + ''y''²:
:&lt;math&gt;f_a(y) = a^2 + ay + y^2.\,&lt;/math&gt;
In this expression, ''a'' is a ''constant'', not a ''variable'', so ''f&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a function of only one real variable.  Consequently the definition of the derivative for a function of one variable applies:
:&lt;math&gt;f_a'(y) = a + 2y.\,&lt;/math&gt;
The above procedure can be performed for any choice of ''a''.  Assembling the derivatives together into a function gives a function that describes the variation of ''ƒ'' in the ''y'' direction:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\part f}{\part y}(x,y) = x + 2y.&lt;/math&gt;
This is the partial derivative of ''ƒ'' with respect to ''y''.  Here ∂ is a rounded ''d'' called the '''partial derivative symbol'''.  To distinguish it from the letter ''d'', ∂ is sometimes pronounced &quot;der&quot;, &quot;del&quot;, or &quot;partial&quot; instead of &quot;dee&quot;.

In general, the '''partial derivative''' of a function ''ƒ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in the direction ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' at the point (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is defined to be:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\part f}{\part x_i}(a_1,\ldots,a_n) = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(a_1,\ldots,a_i+h,\ldots,a_n) - f(a_1,\ldots,a_n)}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;
In the above difference quotient, all the variables except ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are held fixed.  That choice of fixed values determines a function of one variable
:&lt;math&gt;f_{a_1,\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\ldots,a_n}(x_i) = f(a_1,\ldots,a_{i-1},x_i,a_{i+1},\ldots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt;
and, by definition,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{df_{a_1,\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\ldots,a_n}}{dx_i}(a_i) = \frac{\part f}{\part x_i}(a_1,\ldots,a_n).&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, the different choices of ''a'' index a family of one-variable functions just as in the example above.  This expression also shows that the computation of partial derivatives reduces to the computation of one-variable derivatives.

An important example of a function of several variables is the case of a [[scalar-valued function]] ''ƒ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) on a domain in Euclidean space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (e.g., on '''R'''² or '''R'''³). In this case ''ƒ'' has a partial derivative ∂''ƒ''/∂''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; with respect to each variable ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. At the point ''a'', these partial derivatives define the vector
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f(a) = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}(a), \ldots, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}(a)\right).&lt;/math&gt;
This vector is called the '''[[gradient]]''' of ''ƒ'' at ''a''.  If ''ƒ'' is differentiable at every point in some domain, then the gradient is a vector-valued function ∇''ƒ'' that takes the point ''a'' to the vector ∇''f(a)''.  Consequently the gradient determines a [[vector field]].

===Directional derivatives===

{{Main|Directional derivative}}

If ''ƒ'' is a real-valued function on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, then the partial derivatives of ''ƒ'' measure its variation in the direction of the coordinate axes.  For example, if ''ƒ'' is a function of ''x'' and ''y'', then its partial derivatives measure the variation in ''ƒ'' in the ''x'' direction and the ''y'' direction.  They do not, however, directly measure the variation of ''ƒ'' in any other direction, such as along the diagonal line ''y'' = ''x''.  These are measured using directional derivatives.  Choose a vector
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = (v_1,\ldots,v_n).&lt;/math&gt;
The '''directional derivative''' of ''ƒ'' in the direction of '''v''' at the point '''x''' is the limit
:&lt;math&gt;D_{\mathbf{v}}{f}(\mathbf{x}) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}{\frac{f(\mathbf{x} + h\mathbf{v}) - f(\mathbf{x})}{h}}.&lt;/math&gt;
In some cases it may be easier to compute or estimate the directional derivative after changing the length of the vector.  Often this is done to turn the problem into the computation of a directional derivative in the direction of a unit vector.  To see how this works, suppose that {{nowrap begin}}'''v''' = &amp;lambda;'''u'''{{nowrap end}}.  Substitute {{nowrap begin}}''h'' = ''k''/&amp;lambda;{{nowrap end}} into the difference quotient.  The difference quotient becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(\mathbf{x} + (k/\lambda)(\lambda\mathbf{u})) - f(\mathbf{x})}{k/\lambda}
= \lambda\cdot\frac{f(\mathbf{x} + k\mathbf{u}) - f(\mathbf{x})}{k}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is &amp;lambda; times the difference quotient for the directional derivative of ''f'' with respect to '''u'''. Furthermore, taking the limit as ''h'' tends to zero is the same as taking the limit as ''k'' tends to zero because ''h'' and ''k'' are multiples of each other.  Therefore {{nowrap begin}}''D''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;fnof;) = &amp;lambda;''D''&lt;sub&gt;'''u'''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;fnof;){{nowrap end}}.  Because of this rescaling property, directional derivatives are frequently considered only for unit vectors.

If all the partial derivatives of ''ƒ'' exist and are continuous at '''x''', then they determine the directional derivative of ''ƒ'' in the direction '''v''' by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;D_{\mathbf{v}}{f}(\boldsymbol{x}) = \sum_{j=1}^n v_j \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is a consequence of the definition of the [[total derivative]].  It follows that the directional derivative is [[linear map|linear]] in '''v''', meaning that {{nowrap begin}}''D''&lt;sub&gt;'''v''' + '''w'''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;fnof;) = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;fnof;) + ''D''&lt;sub&gt;'''w'''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;fnof;){{nowrap end}}.

The same definition also works when ''ƒ'' is a function with values in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;. The above definition is applied to each component of the vectors.  In this case, the directional derivative is a vector in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;.

===The total derivative, the total differential and the Jacobian===

{{Main|Total derivative}}

When ''ƒ'' is a function from an open subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, then the directional derivative of ''ƒ'' in a chosen direction is the best linear approximation to ''ƒ'' at that point and in that direction.  But when {{nowrap|''n'' &amp;gt; 1}}, no single directional derivative can give a complete picture of the behavior of ''ƒ''. The total derivative, also called the ('''total''') '''[[differential (calculus)|differential]]''', gives a complete picture by considering all directions at once.  That is, for any vector '''v''' starting at '''a''', the linear approximation formula holds:
:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{v}) \approx f(\mathbf{a}) + f'(\mathbf{a})\mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;
Just like the single-variable derivative, {{nowrap|''ƒ''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;('''a''')}} is chosen so that the error in this approximation is as small as possible.

If ''n'' and ''m'' are both one, then the derivative {{nowrap|''ƒ''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;(''a'')}} is a number and the expression {{nowrap|''ƒ''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;(''a'')''v''}} is the product of two numbers. But in higher dimensions, it is impossible for {{nowrap|''ƒ''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;('''a''')}} to be a number. If it were a number, then {{nowrap|''ƒ''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;('''a''')'''v'''}} would be a vector in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; while the other terms would be vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, and therefore the formula would not make sense. For the linear approximation formula to make sense, {{nowrap|''ƒ''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;('''a''')}} must be a function that sends vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, and {{nowrap|''ƒ''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;('''a''')'''v'''}} must denote this function evaluated at '''v'''.

To determine what kind of function it is, notice that the linear approximation formula can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{v}) - f(\mathbf{a}) \approx f'(\mathbf{a})\mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that if we choose another vector '''w''', then this approximate equation determines another approximate equation by substituting '''w''' for '''v'''. It determines a third approximate equation by substituting both '''w''' for '''v''' and {{nowrap|'''a''' + '''v'''}} for '''a'''. By subtracting these two new equations, we get
:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) - f(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{v}) - f(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{w}) + f(\mathbf{a})
\approx f'(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{v})\mathbf{w} - f'(\mathbf{a})\mathbf{w}.&lt;/math&gt;
If we assume that '''v''' is small and that the derivative varies continuously in '''a''', then {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;('''a''' + '''v''')}} is approximately equal to {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;('''a''')}}, and therefore the right-hand side is approximately zero. The left-hand side can be rewritten in a different way using the linear approximation formula with {{nowrap|'''v''' + '''w'''}} substituted for '''v'''. The linear approximation formula implies:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
0
&amp;\approx f(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) - f(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{v}) - f(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{w}) + f(\mathbf{a}) \\
&amp;= (f(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) - f(\mathbf{a})) - (f(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{v}) - f(\mathbf{a})) - (f(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{w}) - f(\mathbf{a})) \\
&amp;\approx f'(\mathbf{a})(\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) - f'(\mathbf{a})\mathbf{v} - f'(\mathbf{a})\mathbf{w}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This suggests that {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;('''a''')}} is a [[linear transformation]] from the vector space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to the vector space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;. In fact, it is possible to make this a precise derivation by measuring the error in the approximations.  Assume that the error in these linear approximation formula is bounded by a constant times ||'''v'''||, where the constant is independent of '''v''' but depends continuously on '''a'''. Then, after adding an appropriate error term, all of the above approximate equalities can be rephrased as inequalities.  In particular, {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;('''a''')}} is a linear transformation up to a small error term.  In the limit as '''v''' and '''w''' tend to zero, it must therefore be a linear transformation. Since we define the total derivative by taking a limit as '''v''' goes to zero, {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;('''a''')}} must be a linear transformation.

In one variable, the fact that the derivative is the best linear approximation is expressed by the fact that it is the limit of difference quotients.  However, the usual difference quotient does not make sense in higher dimensions because it is not usually possible to divide vectors. In particular, the numerator and denominator of the difference quotient are not even in the same vector space: The numerator lies in the codomain '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; while the denominator lies in the domain '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the derivative is a linear transformation, a different type of object from both the numerator and denominator.  To make precise the idea that {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;&amp;thinsp;('''a''')}} is the best linear approximation, it is necessary to adapt a different formula for the one-variable derivative in which these problems disappear. If {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;'' : '''R''' &amp;rarr; '''R'''}}, then the usual definition of the derivative may be manipulated to show that the derivative of ''&amp;fnof;'' at ''a'' is the unique number {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;(''a'')}} such that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a) - f'(a)h}{h} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
This is equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{|f(a + h) - f(a) - f'(a)h|}{|h|} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
because the limit of a function tends to zero if and only if the limit of the absolute value of the function tends to zero.  This last formula can be adapted to the many-variable situation by replacing the absolute values with [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s.

The definition of the '''total derivative''' of ''ƒ'' at '''a''', therefore, is that it is the unique linear transformation {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;('''a''') : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} such that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\lVert\mathbf{h}\rVert \to 0} \frac{\lVert f(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{h}) - f(\mathbf{a}) - f'(\mathbf{a})\mathbf{h}\rVert}{\lVert\mathbf{h}\rVert} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Here '''h''' is a vector in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, so the norm in the denominator is the standard length on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  However, ''ƒ''&amp;prime;('''a''')'''h''' is a vector in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, and the norm in the numerator is the standard length on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;.  If ''v'' is a vector starting at ''a'', then {{nowrap|''ƒ''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;('''a''')'''v'''}} is called the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] of '''v''' by ''ƒ'' and is sometimes written {{nowrap|''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;'''v'''}}.

If the total derivative exists at '''a''', then all the partial derivatives and directional derivatives of ''ƒ'' exist at '''a''', and for all '''v''', {{nowrap|''ƒ''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;('''a''')'''v'''}} is the directional derivative of ''ƒ'' in the direction '''v'''.  If we write ''ƒ'' using coordinate functions, so that ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;= (''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;), then the total derivative can be expressed using the partial derivatives as a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].  This matrix is called the '''[[Jacobian matrix]]''' of ''ƒ'' at&amp;nbsp;'''a''':

:&lt;math&gt;f'(\mathbf{a}) = \operatorname{Jac}_{\mathbf{a}} = \left(\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}\right)_{ij}.&lt;/math&gt;

The existence of the total derivative ''ƒ''&amp;prime;('''a''') is strictly stronger than the existence of all the partial derivatives, but if the partial derivatives exist and are continuous, then the total derivative exists, is given by the Jacobian, and depends continuously on '''a'''.

The definition of the total derivative subsumes the definition of the derivative in one variable.  That is, if ''ƒ'' is a real-valued function of a real variable, then the total derivative exists if and only if the usual derivative exists.  The Jacobian matrix reduces to a 1×1 matrix whose only entry is the derivative ''ƒ''&amp;prime;(''x'').  This 1×1 matrix satisfies the property that {{nowrap|''ƒ''(''a'' + ''h'') &amp;minus; ''ƒ''(''a'') &amp;minus; ''&amp;fnof;''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;(''a'')''h''}} is approximately zero, in other words that

:&lt;math&gt;f(a+h) \approx f(a) + f'(a)h.&lt;/math&gt;

Up to changing variables, this is the statement that the function &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)&lt;/math&gt; is the best linear approximation to ''ƒ'' at&amp;nbsp;''a''.

The total derivative of a function does not give another function in the same way as the one-variable case.  This is because the total derivative of a multivariable function has to record much more information than the derivative of a single-variable function.  Instead, the total derivative gives a function from the [[tangent bundle]] of the source to the tangent bundle of the target.

The natural analog of second, third, and higher-order total derivatives is not a linear transformation, is not a function on the tangent bundle, and is not built by repeatedly taking the total derivative. The analog of a higher-order derivative, called a [[jet (mathematics)|jet]], cannot be a linear transformation because higher-order derivatives reflect subtle geometric information, such as concavity, which cannot be described in terms of linear data such as vectors.  It cannot be a function on the tangent bundle because the tangent bundle only has room for the base space and the directional derivatives. Because jets capture higher-order information, they take as arguments additional coordinates representing higher-order changes in direction. The space determined by these additional coordinates is called the [[jet bundle]].  The relation between the total derivative and the partial derivatives of a function is paralleled in the relation between the ''k''th order jet of a function and its partial derivatives of order less than or equal to ''k''.

==Generalizations==
{{Main|Derivative (generalizations)}}

The concept of a derivative can be extended to many other settings. The common thread is that the derivative of a function at a point serves as a [[linear approximation]] of the function at that point.
* An important generalization of the derivative concerns [[complex function]]s of [[Complex number|complex variable]]s, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers '''C''' to '''C'''. The notion of the derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If '''C''' is identified with '''R'''² by writing a complex number ''z'' as ''x'' + ''i'' ''y'', then a differentiable function from '''C''' to '''C''' is certainly differentiable as a function from '''R'''² to '''R'''² (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is ''complex linear'' and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the [[Cauchy Riemann equations]] &amp;mdash; see [[holomorphic function]]s.
* Another generalization concerns functions between [[smooth manifold|differentiable or smooth manifolds]]. Intuitively speaking such a manifold ''M'' is a space that can be approximated near each point ''x'' by a vector space called its [[tangent space]]: the prototypical example is a [[smooth surface]] in '''R'''³. The derivative (or differential) of a (differentiable) map ''ƒ'': ''M'' → ''N'' between manifolds, at a point ''x'' in ''M'', is then a [[linear map]] from the tangent space of ''M'' at ''x'' to the tangent space of ''N'' at ''ƒ''(''x''). The derivative function becomes a map between the [[tangent bundle]]s of ''M'' and ''N''. This definition is fundamental in [[differential geometry]] and has many uses &amp;mdash; see [[pushforward (differential)]] and [[pullback (differential geometry)]].
* Differentiation can also be defined for maps between [[Dimension (vector space)|infinite dimensional]] [[vector space]]s such as [[Banach space]]s and [[Fréchet space]]s.   There is a generalization both of the directional derivative, called the [[Gâteaux derivative]], and of the differential, called the [[Fréchet derivative]].
* One deficiency of the classical derivative is that not very many functions are differentiable. Nevertheless, there is a way of extending the notion of the derivative so that all [[continuous function|continuous]] functions and many other functions can be differentiated using a concept known as the [[weak derivative]]. The idea is to embed the continuous functions in a larger space called the space of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] and only require that a function is differentiable &quot;on average&quot;.
* The properties of the derivative have inspired the introduction and study of many similar objects in algebra and topology &amp;mdash; see, for example, [[differential algebra]].
* The discrete equivalent of differentiation is [[finite difference]]s. The study of differential calculus is unified with the calculus of finite differences in [[time scale calculus]].
* Also see [[arithmetic derivative]].

The '''Dravidian''' [[Language families and languages|family of languages]] includes approximately 85 genetically related languages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=1282-16 Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt; spoken by about 217 million people. They are mainly spoken in [[South India|southern India]] and parts of eastern and central [[India]] as well as in northeastern [[Sri Lanka Tamils (native)|Sri Lanka]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]], and overseas in other countries such as [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. Among them  [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Malayalam]] are the members with the most speakers. There are also small groups of Dravidian-speaking [[List of Scheduled Tribes in India|scheduled tribes]], who live beyond the mainstream communities. It is often speculated that Dravidian languages are native to [[India]]. [[Early Indian epigraphy|Epigraphically]] the Dravidian languages have been attested since the 6th century [[BCE]]. Only one Dravidian language, the [[Brahui language]], is exclusively spoken outside [[India]].

==Origins of the word ''Dravidian''==
The English word Dravidian was first employed by [[Robert Caldwell]] in his book of comparative Dravidian grammar based on the usage of the [[Sanskrit]] word ''{{IAST|drāviḍa}}'' in the work ''Tantravārttika'' by {{IAST|Kumārila Bhaṭṭa}} (Zvelebil 1990:xx). As for the origin of the Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|drāviḍa}}'' itself there have been various theories proposed. Basically the theories are about the direction of derivation between ''{{IAST|tamiẓ}}'' and ''{{IAST|drāviḍa}}''.

There is no definite philological and linguistic basis for asserting unilaterally that the name ''[[Dravida]]'' also forms the origin of the word ''[[Tamil language|Tamil]]'' (Dravida -&gt; Dramila -&gt; Tamizha or Tamil).   Zvelebil cites the forms such as ''dramila'' (in {{IAST|Daṇḍin}}'s  Sanskrit work ''Avanisundarīkathā'') ''{{IAST|damiḷa}}'' (found in Ceylonese chronicle Mahavamsa) and then goes on to say (ibid. page xxi): &quot;The forms ''damiḷa''/''damila'' almost certainly provide a connection of ''{{IAST|dr(a/ā)viḍa}}'' &quot; and &quot;... ''{{IAST|tamiḷ}}'' &lt; ''{{IAST|tamiẓ}}'' ...whereby the further development might have been *''{{IAST|tamiẓ}}'' &gt; *''{{IAST|damiḷ}}'' &gt; ''{{IAST|damiḷa}}''- / ''damila''- and further, with the intrusive, 'hypercorrect' (or perhaps analogical) -''r''-, into ''{{IAST|dr(a/ā)viḍa}}''. The -''m''-/-''v''- alternation is a common enough phenomenon in Dravidian phonology&quot; (Zvelebil 1990:xxi)
Zvelebil in his earlier treatise (Zvelebil 1975: p53) states: &quot;It is obvious that the Sanskrit ''{{IAST|dr(a/ā)viḍa}}'', Pali ''damila'', ''{{IAST|damiḷo}}'' and Prakrit ''{{IAST|d(a/ā)viḍa}}'' are all etymologically connected with ''{{IAST|tamiẓ}}''&quot; and further remarks &quot;The ''r'' in ''{{IAST|tamiẓ}}'' &gt; ''{{IAST|dr(a/ā)viḍa}}'' is a hypercorrect insertion, cf. an analogical case of DED 1033 Ta. ''kamuku'', Tu.''kangu'' &quot;areca nut&quot;: Skt. ''kramu(ka)''.&quot;.

Further, another Dravidian linguist [[Bhadriraju Krishnamurti]] in his book ''Dravidian Languages'' (Krishnamurti 2003: p. 2, footnote 2) states:
&quot;Joseph (1989: IJDL 18.2:134-42) gives extensive references to the use of the term ''{{IAST|draviḍa}}'', ''dramila'' first as the name of a people, then of a country. Sinhala inscriptions of BCE cite ''{{IAST|dameḍa}}''-, ''damela''- denoting Tamil merchants. Early Buddhist and Jaina sources used ''{{IAST|damiḷa}}''- to refer to a people of south India (presumably Tamil); ''{{IAST|damilaraṭṭha}}''- was a southern non-Aryan country; ''{{IAST|dramiḷa}}''-, ''{{IAST|dramiḍa}}'', and ''{{IAST|draviḍa}}''- were used as variants to designate a country in the south (''{{IAST|Bṛhatsamhita-}}'', ''Kādambarī'', ''Daśakumāracarita-'', fourth to seventh centuries CE) (1989: 134–138). It appears that ''{{IAST|damiḷa}}''- was older than ''{{IAST|draviḍa}}''- which could be its Sanskritization.&quot;

Based on what Krishnamurti states referring to a scholarly paper published in the International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics, the Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|draviḍa}}'' itself is later than ''{{IAST|damiḷa}}'' since the dates for the forms with -r- are centuries later than the dates for the forms without -r- (''{{IAST|damiḷa}}'', ''{{IAST|dameḍa}}''-, ''damela''- etc.).

The Monier-Williams Sanskrit Dictionary&lt;ref&gt;[http://webapps.uni-koeln.de/tamil/ Sanskrit, Tamil and Pahlavi Dictionaries&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; lists for the Sanskrit word ''{{Unicode|draviḍa}}'' a meaning of &quot;collective Name for 5 peoples, viz. the {{Unicode|Āndhras, Karṇāṭakas, Gurjaras, Tailaṅgas,}} and {{Unicode|Mahārāṣṭras}}&quot;.

==History==
{{Dravidian languages genealogy}}
{{main|Proto-Dravidian language}}
The origins of the Dravidian languages, as well as their subsequent development and the period of their differentiation are unclear, partially due to the lack of [[comparative linguistics|comparative linguistic]] research into the Dravidian languages. The Dravidian languages have remained an isolated family to the present day and have defied all of the attempts to show a connection with the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] tongues, Mitanni, Basque, Sumerian, or Korean. Rasmus K. Rask (1787–1832) considered Dravidian as belonging to the &quot;[[Scythian]]&quot; languages referring to Scythians as non-Semitic and non-Indo-European peoples and languages of Eastern Europe and Western Asia sometimes also termed &quot;[[Hyperborean]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dravidian Linguistics |author=Kamil Zvelebil |publisher=Pondicherry Institute of Linguistics and Culture |year=1990 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One plausible hypothesis is that of a linguistic relationship with the Uralic (Hungarian, Finnish) and [[Altaic]] (Turkish, Mongol) language groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannicaOnline&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9109791 Dravidian languages.]&quot; [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 30 Jun. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The theory that the Dravidian languages display similarities with the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language group, suggesting a prolonged period of contact in the past,&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, Stephen (1968), &quot;Dravidian and Uralian: the [[lexical]] evidence&quot;. ''Language'' 44:4. 798–812&lt;/ref&gt; is popular amongst Dravidian linguists and has been supported by a number of scholars, including [[Robert Caldwell]],&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Edward (1860), &quot;Evidences of the Scythian Affinities of the Dravidian Languages, Condensed and Arranged from Rev. R. Caldwell's Comparative Dravidian Grammar&quot;, ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' Vol. 7. 271–298.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Burrow]],&lt;ref&gt;Burrow, T. (1944) &quot;Dravidian Studies IV: The Body in Dravidian and Uralian&quot;. ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'' 11:2. 328–356.&lt;/ref&gt; Kamil Zvelebil,&lt;ref name=&quot;britannicaDVD&quot;&gt;Zvelebil, Kamal (2006). Dravidian Languages. In ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (DVD edition).&lt;/ref&gt; and Mikhail Andronov.&lt;ref&gt;Andronov, Mikhail S. (1971), &quot;Comparative Studies on the Nature of Dravidian-Uralian Parallels: A Peep into the Prehistory of Language Families&quot;. ''Proceedings of the Second International Conference of Tamil Studies'' Madras. 267–277.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has, however, been rejected by some specialists in Uralic languages,&lt;ref&gt;Zvelebil, Kamal (1970), ''Comparative Dravidian Phonology'' Mouton, The Hauge. at p. 22 contains a bibliography of articles supporting and opposing the theory&lt;/ref&gt; and has in recent times also been criticised by other Dravidian linguists like [[Bhadriraju Krishnamurti]].&lt;ref&gt;Krishnamurti, Bhadriraju (2003) ''The Dravidian Languages'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. ISBN 0-521-77111-0 at p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in modern times speakers of the various Dravidian languages have mainly occupied the southern portion of India, nothing definite is known about the ancient domain of the Dravidian parent speech. It is, however, a well-established and well-supported hypothesis that Dravidian speakers must have been widespread throughout India, including the northwest region&lt;ref name=&quot;britannicaOnline&quot;/&gt; before the arrival of Indo-European speakers.

[[Proto-Dravidian]] is thought to have differentiated into Proto-North Dravidian, Proto-Central Dravidian, Proto South-Central Dravidian and Proto-South Dravidian around 500 BCE, although some linguists have argued that the degree of differentiation between the sub-families points to an earlier split.

The existence of the Dravidian language family was first suggested in 1816 by Alexander D. Campbell in his ''Grammar of the [[Telugu language|Teloogoo Language]]'', in which he and [[Francis Whyte Ellis|Francis W. Ellis]] argued that [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] were descended from a common, non-Indo-European ancestor. However, it was not until 1856 that [[Robert Caldwell]] published his ''Comparative grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian family of languages'', which considerably expanded the Dravidian umbrella and established it as one of the major language groups of the world. Caldwell coined the term &quot;Dravidian&quot; from the [[Sanskrit]] ''drāvida'', which was used in a 7th century text to refer to the [[Tamil language]] of the south of India. The publication of the ''[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/burrow/ Dravidian etymological dictionary]'' by [[T. Burrow]] and [[M. B. Emeneau]] was a landmark event in Dravidian linguistics.

==Classification==
The Dravidian languages form a close-knit family - much more closely related than, say, the [[Indo-European languages]]. There is a fair degree of agreement on how they are related to each other. The following classification divides Dravidian into three branches. Other classifications use four: either dividing Central Dravidian into Central (Kolami–Parji) and South-Central (Telugu–Kui), or dividing Northern Dravidian into Northeast (Kurukh–Malto) and Northwest (Brahui). There are in addition as-yet unclassified Dravidian languages such as [[Allar language|Allar]].

The languages recognized as [[List of official languages of India|official languages of India]] appear here in '''boldface'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannicaOnline&quot;/&gt;

Ratnasabapathy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other language families==
The Dravidian languages have not been shown to be related to any other language family. Comparisons have been made not just with the other language families of the Indian Subcontinent ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Austro-Asiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic]], [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]], and [[Nihali language|Nihali]]), but with all typologically similar language families of the Old World. Dravidian is one of the primary linguistic groups in the proposed [[Nostratic]] proposal, which would link most languages in North Africa, Europe and Western Asia into a family with its origins in the [[Fertile Crescent]] sometime between the last [[Ice Age]] and the emergence of [[Proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo-European]] 4–6 thousand years BCE. However, the general consensus is that such deep connections are not, or not yet, demonstrable.

On a less ambitious scale, McAlpin (1975) proposed linking Dravidian languages with the ancient [[Elamite language]] of what is now southwestern Iran. However, despite decades of research, this [[Elamo-Dravidian]] language family has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of other historical linguists. 

Nonetheless, while there are no readily detectable genealogical connections, there are strong [[Sprachbund|areal features]] linking Dravidian with the [[Indo-Aryan languages]]. Dravidian languages show extensive lexical (vocabulary) borrowing, but only a few traits of structural (either phonological or grammatical) borrowing, from Indo-Aryan, whereas the Indo-Aryan shows more structural features than lexical borrowings from the Dravidian languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannicaOnline&quot;/&gt; The Dravidian impact on the syntax of Indo-Aryan languages is considered far greater than the Indo-Aryan impact on Dravidian grammar. Some linguists explain this asymmetry by arguing that Middle Indo-Aryan languages were built on a Dravidian [[substratum]].&lt;ref&gt;Krishnamurti, Bhadriraju (2003) ''The Dravidian Languages'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. ISBN 0-521-77111-0 at p. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
{{Expand section|date=January 2007}}
The most characteristic features of Dravidian languages are:&lt;ref name=&quot;britannicaDVD&quot;/&gt;
* Dravidian languages are [[Agglutination|agglutinative]].
* Dravidian languages have a [[clusivity]] distinction.
* The major word classes are nouns (substantives, numerals, pronouns), adjectives, verbs, and indeclinables (particles, enclitics, adverbs, interjections, onomatopoetic words, echo words).
* Proto-Dravidian used only suffixes, never prefixes or infixes, in the construction of inflected forms. Hence, the roots of words always occurred at the beginning. Nouns, verbs, and indeclinable words constituted the original word classes.
* There are two numbers and four different gender systems, the “original” probably having “male: non-male” in the singular and “person:non-person” in the plural.
* In a sentence, however complex, only one finite verb occurs, normally at the end, preceded if necessary by a number of gerunds.
* Word order follows certain basic rules but is relatively free.
* The main (and probably original) dichotomy in tense is past:non-past. Present tense developed later and independently in each language or subgroup.
* Verbs are intransitive, transitive, and causative; there are also active and passive forms.
* All of the positive verb forms have their corresponding negative counterparts, [[negative verbs]].

==Phonology==
Dravidian languages are noted for the lack of distinction between aspirated and unaspirated stops. While some Dravidian languages (especially [[Malayalam]], [[Kannada]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]]) have accepted large numbers of loan words from [[Sanskrit]] and other [[Indo-European languages]] in addition to their already vast vocabulary, in which the [[orthography]] shows distinctions in voice and [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]], the words are pronounced in Dravidian according to different rules of [[phonology]] and [[phonotactics]]: aspiration of [[plosives]] is generally absent, regardless of the spelling of the word. This is not a universal phenomenon and is generally avoided in formal or careful speech, especially when reciting.

For instance, [[Tamil language|Tamil]], like [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Ainu language|Ainu]], and most [[indigenous Australian languages]], does not distinguish between voiced and voiceless stops. In fact, the [[Tamil alphabet]] lacks symbols for voiced and aspirated stops.

Dravidian languages are also characterized by a three-way distinction between [[Dental consonant|dental]], [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], and [[retroflex]] places of articulation as well as large numbers of [[Liquid consonant|liquids]].

===Historical Phonology===
{{main|Proto-Dravidian}}
'''Vowels''': [[Proto-Dravidian]] had ten vowels: ''a'', ''ā'', ''e'', ''ē'', ''u'', ''ū'', ''i'', ''ī'', ''o'', ''ō''. There was contrast between short and long vowels. There were no diphthongs. ''ai'' and ''au'' are treated as *''ay'' and *''av'' (or *''aw'') (Subrahmanyam 1983, Zvelebil 1990, Krishnamurti 2003).

'''Consonants''': Proto-Dravidian is reconstructible with the following consonantal phonemes (Subrahmanyam 1983:p40, Zvelebil 1990, Krishnamurti 2003) :

===Words starting with vowels===
A substantial number of words also begin and end with [[vowels]], which helps the languages' [[agglutinative]] property.

karanu (cry), elumbu (bone), athu (that), avide (there), ithu (this), illai (no, absent)

adu-idil-illai (adu = that, idu = this, il= suffix form of &quot;in&quot;, so =&gt; that-this-in-absent =&gt; that-in this-absent =&gt; that is absent in this)

===Numerals===
The numerals from 1 to 10 in various Dravidian languages.

#This is the same as the word for another form of the number one in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malayalam]]. This is used as an indefinite article meaning &quot;a&quot; and also when the number is an adjective followed by a noun (as in &quot;one person&quot;) as opposed to when it is a noun (as in &quot;How many are there?&quot; &quot;One&quot;).
#This is still found in compound words, and has taken on a meaning of &quot;double&quot; in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malayalam]]. For example, irupatu (20, literally meaning &quot;double-ten&quot;), iravai (20 in Telugu), or &quot;{{Unicode|iraṭṭi}}&quot; (&quot;double&quot;) or Iruvar (meaning two people).
*Words indicated '''(II)''' are borrowings from [[Indo-Iranian languages]].

===Stability and Continuity of Dravidian===
The Dravidian language family has been considered remarkably stable, especially with respect to preservation of its root vowels.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-74968 Dravidian languages – Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dravidian substratum influence on Sanskrit===
{{main|Substratum in Vedic Sanskrit}}
Dravidian and [[Sanskrit]] have influenced each other in various ways from very early times, hence it is an interesting field for linguistic research.

The [[Indologist]] and linguist Zvelebil has remarked that: &quot;... the period of the high water mark of [[Tamil classical literature]] was one in which the two great [[Sanskrit]] [[epics]] were already completed, but the [[Sanskrit classical poetry]] was barely emerging with {{IAST|Aśvaghoṣa}}.&quot; He continues: &quot;''No stylistic feature or convention could have been borrowed by the Tamils (though of course there are borrowings of {{IAST|purāṇic}} stories''&quot; (emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;Zvelebil, 1975, pp. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zvelebil remarks:

&quot;Though the dominance of Sanskrit was exaggerated in some Brahmanic circles of [[Tamilnadu]], and Tamil was given unduly underestimated by a few Sanskrit-oriented scholars, the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Sanskrit]] cultures were not generally in rivalry&quot;.

However more recent research has shown that [[Sanskrit]] has been influenced in certain more fundamental ways than Dravidian languages have been by it: It is by way of [[phonology]]&lt;ref name='substrate-influence'&gt;{{cite book |last=Trask |first=Robert Lawrence |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |location= |pages=97 |quote=It is widely suspected that the extinct and undeciphered Indus Valley language was a Dravidian language, but no confirmation is available. The existence of the isolated northern outlier ''Brahui'' is consistent with the hypothesis that Dravidian formerly occupied much of North India but was displaced by the invading Indo-Aryan languages, and the presence in the [[Indo-Aryan languages]] of certain linguistic features, such as retroflex consonants, is often attributed to Dravidian substrate influence.|url=http://books.google.com/?id=EHeGzQ8wuLQC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=retroflex+%22dravidian+substrate+influence%22+but |doi= |id= |isbn=1579582184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and even more significantly here via grammatical constructs. This has been the case from the earliest language available (ca. 1200 B.C.) of Sanskrit: the {{IAST|Ṛg}} Vedic speech.

Dravidian languages show extensive lexical ([[vocabulary]]) borrowing, but only a few traits of structural (either phonological or grammatical) borrowing, from the Indo-Aryan tongues. On the other hand, Indo-Aryan shows rather large-scale structural borrowing from Dravidian, but relatively few loanwords.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannicaOnline&quot;/&gt;

The {{IAST|Ṛg}} [[Vedic language]] has retroflex consonants even though it is well known that the [[Indo European]] family and the [[Indo-Iranian]] subfamily to which Sanskrit belongs lack retroflex consonants ({{IAST|ṭ}}/{{IAST|ḍ}}, {{IAST|ṇ}}) with about 88 words in the {{IAST|Ṛg}} Veda having unconditioned retroflexes (Kuiper 1991, Witzel 1999). Some sample words are: (''{{IAST|Iṭanta}}'', ''{{IAST|Kaṇva}}'',''{{IAST|śakaṭī}}'', ''{{IAST|kevaṭa}}'', ''{{IAST|puṇya}}'', ''{{IAST|maṇḍūka}}'') This is cited as a serious evidence of substrate influence from close contact of the Vedic speakers with speakers of a foreign language family rich in [[retroflex phonemes]] (Kuiper 1991, Witzel 1999). Obviously the Dravidian family would be a serious candidate here (ibid as well as Krishnamurti 2003: p36) since it is rich in retroflex phonemes reconstructible back to the Proto-Dravidian stage[See Subrahmanyam 1983:p40, Zvelebil 1990, Krishnamurti 2003].

A more serious influence on Vedic Sanskrit is the extensive grammatical influence attested by the usage of the quotative marker ''iti'' and the occurrence of gerunds of verbs, a grammatical feature not found even in the Avestan language, a sister language of the Vedic Sanskrit. As Krishnamurti states: &quot;Besides, the {{IAST|Ṛg}} Veda has used the gerund, not found in Avestan, with the same grammatical function as in Dravidian, as a non-finite verb for 'incomplete' action. {{IAST|Ṛg}} Vedic language also attests the use of iti as a quotative clause complementizer. All these features are not a consequence of simple borrowing but they indicate substratum influence (Kuiper 1991: ch 2)&quot;.

The [[Brahui people|Brahui]] population of [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] has been taken by some as the linguistic equivalent of a [[relict]] [[population]], perhaps indicating that Dravidian languages were formerly much more widespread and were supplanted by the incoming [[Indo-Aryan languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Mallory|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it has now been demonstrated that the Brahui could only have migrated to Balochistan from [[central India]] after 1000 CE. The absence of any older Iranian (Avestan) loanwords in Brahui supports this hypothesis. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, Balochi, is a western [[Iranian language]] like [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], and moved to the area from the west only around 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Elfenbein, A periplous of the ‘Brahui problem’, ''Studia Iranica'' vol. 16 (1987), pp. 215-233.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988}} state that there is strong evidence that Dravidian influenced [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]] through &quot;shift&quot;, that is, native Dravidian speakers learning and adopting Indic languages. {{Harvtxt|Elst|1999}} claims that the presence of the [[Brahui language]], similarities between Elamite and Harappan script as well as similarities between Indo-Aryan and Dravidian indicate that these languages may have interacted prior to the spread of Indo-Aryans southwards and the resultant intermixing of languages. {{Harvcoltxt|Erdosy|1995|p=18}} states that the most plausible explanation for the presence of Dravidian structural features in Old Indo-Aryan is that the majority of early Old Indo-Aryan speakers had a Dravidian mother tongue which they gradually abandoned. Even though the innovative traits in Indic could be explained by multiple internal explanations, early Dravidian influence is the only explanation that can account for all of the innovations at once – it becomes a question of [[Occam's razor|explanatory parsimony]]; moreover, early Dravidian influence accounts for the several of the innovative traits in Indic better than any internal explanation that has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|pp=141–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zvelebil remarks&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;: &quot;Several scholars have demonstrated that pre-Indo-Aryan and [[pre-Dravidian]] [[bilingualism]] in [[India]] provided conditions for the far-reaching influence of Dravidian on the Indo-Aryan tongues in the spheres of phonology (e.g., the retroflex consonants, made with the tongue curled upward toward the palate), syntax (e.g., the frequent use of gerunds, which are nonfinite verb forms of nominal character, as in 'by the falling of the rain'), and vocabulary (a number of Dravidian loanwords apparently appearing in the Rigveda itself).&quot;

'''''Dracula''''' is an [[1897 in literature|1897]] novel by Irish author [[Bram Stoker]], featuring as its primary [[antagonist]] the [[vampire]] [[Count Dracula]]. It was first published as a hardcover in 1897 by Archibald Constable and Co.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bramstoker.org/novels.html Bibliography of Stoker's novles at Bram Stoker Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dracula'' has been assigned to many [[literary genre]]s including [[vampire literature]], [[horror fiction]], the [[gothic fiction|gothic novel]] and [[invasion literature]]. Structurally it is an [[epistolary novel]], that is, told as a series of letters, [[diary]] entries, ships' logs, etc. [[Literary criticism|Literary critics]] have examined many themes in the novel, such as the role of women in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] culture, conventional and conservative sexuality, immigration, [[colonialism]], [[postcolonialism]] and [[folklore]]. Although Stoker did not invent the vampire, the novel's influence on the popularity of vampires has been singularly responsible for many [[Theatre|theatrical]], [[film]] and [[television]] interpretations since its publication.

==Plot summary==
[[File:Stoker Dracula Notes Personal.jpg|thumb|left|Stoker's handwritten notes on the personnel of the novel]]
The novel is mainly composed of journal entries and letters written by several narrators who also serve as the novel's main protagonists; Stoker supplemented the story with occasional newspaper clippings to relate events not directly witnessed by the story's characters. The tale begins with [[Jonathan Harker]], a newly qualified English [[solicitor]], journeying by train and [[carriage]] from England to [[Count Dracula]]'s crumbling, remote castle (situated in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] on the border of [[Transylvania]], [[Bukovina]] and [[Moldavia]]). The purpose of his mission is to provide legal support to Dracula for a [[real estate]] transaction overseen by Harker's employer, Peter Hawkins, of [[Exeter]] in England. At first enticed by Dracula's gracious manner, Harker soon discovers that he has become a prisoner in the castle. He also begins to see disquieting facets of Dracula's nocturnal life. One night while searching for a way out of the castle, and against Dracula's strict admonition not to venture outside his room at night, Harker falls under the spell of three [[Wiktionary:wanton|wanton]] female vampires, the [[Brides of Dracula]]. He is saved at the last second by the Count, because he wants to keep Harker alive just long enough to obtain needed legal advice and teachings about England and London (Dracula's planned travel destination was to be among the &quot;teeming millions&quot;). Harker barely escapes from the castle with his life. 

Not long afterward, a [[Russia]]n ship, the ''Demeter'', having weighed anchor at [[Varna]], runs aground on the shores of [[Whitby]], England, during a fierce tempest. All of the crew are missing and presumed dead, and only one body is found, that of the captain tied to the ship's helm. The captain's [[Logbook|log]] is recovered and tells of strange events that had taken place during the ship's journey. These events led to the gradual disappearance of the entire crew apparently owing to a malevolent presence on board the ill-fated ship. An animal described as a large dog is seen on the ship leaping ashore. The ship's cargo is described as silver sand and boxes of &quot;mould&quot;, or earth, from Transylvania.

Soon Dracula is tracking Harker's devoted fiancée, [[Mina Harker|Wilhelmina &quot;Mina&quot; Murray]], and her friend, [[Lucy Westenra]]. Lucy receives three [[marriage]] proposals in one day, from Dr. [[John Seward]]; [[Quincey Morris]]; and the Hon. [[Arthur Holmwood]] (later Lord Godalming). Lucy accepts Holmwood's proposal while turning down Seward and Morris, but all remain friends. There is a notable encounter between Dracula and Seward's patient [[Renfield]], an insane man who means to consume insects, spiders, birds, and other creatures &amp;mdash; in ascending order of size &amp;mdash; in order to absorb their &quot;life force&quot;. Renfield acts as a motion sensor, detecting Dracula's proximity and supplying clues accordingly.

Lucy begins to waste away suspiciously. All of her suitors fret, and Seward calls in his old teacher, Professor [[Abraham Van Helsing]] from [[Amsterdam]]. Van Helsing immediately determines the cause of Lucy's condition but refuses to disclose it, knowing that Seward's faith in him will be shaken if he starts to speak of vampires. Van Helsing tries multiple [[blood transfusion]]s, but they are clearly losing ground. On a night when Van Helsing must return to Amsterdam (and his message to Seward asking him to watch the Westenra household is accidentally sent to the wrong address), Lucy and her mother are attacked by a [[wolf]]. Mrs Westenra, who has a heart condition, dies of fright, and Lucy apparently dies soon after.
&lt;!-- The wolf is a real wolf, which Dracula breaks out of London Zoo for backup; the narrative includes a press clipping about the wolf's mysterious escape and subsequent return. Is this worth mentioning in the plot summary? - See Talk: page --&gt;

Lucy is buried, but soon afterward the newspapers report children being stalked in the night by a &quot;bloofer lady&quot; (as they describe it), i.e. &quot;beautiful lady&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Wolf]] (2004), ''The Essential Dracula'', Chapter 13, Note 31. &quot;Bloofer lady&quot; is explained as baby-talk for &quot;beautiful lady.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Van Helsing, knowing that this means Lucy has become a vampire, confides in Seward, Lord Godalming and Morris. The suitors and Van Helsing track her down, and after a disturbing confrontation between her vampiric self and Arthur, they stake her heart, [[decapitation|behead]] her, and fill her mouth with [[garlic]]. 

Around the same time, Jonathan Harker arrives home from recuperation in [[Budapest]] (where Mina joined and married him after his escape from the castle); he and Mina also join the coalition, who turn their attentions to dealing with Dracula.

After Dracula learns of Van Helsing and the others' plot against him, he takes revenge by visiting —- and feeding from —- Mina at least three times. Dracula also feeds Mina his blood, creating a spiritual bond between them to control her. The only way to forestall this is to kill Dracula first. Mina slowly succumbs to the blood of the vampire that flows through her veins, switching back and forth from a state of consciousness to a state of semi-trance during which she is telepathically connected with Dracula. This telepathic connection is established to be two-way, in that the Count can influence Mina, but in doing so betrays to her awareness of his surroundings.

After the group sterilizes all of his lairs in London, Dracula flees back to his castle in Transylvania, transported in a box with transfer and portage instructions forwarded ahead, pursued by Van Helsing's group, who themselves are aided by Van Helsing hypnotizing Mina and questioning her about the Count. The group splits in three directions. Van Helsing goes to the Count's castle and kills his trio of brides, and shortly afterwards all converge on the Count just at sundown under the shadow of the castle. Harker and Quincey rush to Dracula's box, which is being transported by [[Romani people|Gypsies]]. Harker shears Dracula through the throat with a [[Kukri]] while mortally wounded Quincey, slashed by one of the crew, stabs the Count in the heart with a [[Bowie knife]]. Dracula crumbles to dust, and Mina is freed from his curse.

The book closes with a note about Mina's and Jonathan's married life and the birth of their first-born son, whom they name after all four members of the party, but refer to only as Quincey in remembrance of their American friend.

==Background==
Between 1879 and 1898, Stoker was a business manager for the world-famous [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] in London, where he supplemented his income by writing a large number of sensational novels, his most famous being the vampire tale ''Dracula'' published on May 26, 1897.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belford2002&quot;/&gt;{{rp|269}} Parts of it are set around the town of [[Whitby]], where he spent summer vacations. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, authors such as [[Henry Rider Haggard|H. Rider Haggard]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], and [[H. G. Wells]] wrote many tales in which fantastic creatures threatened the British Empire. [[Invasion literature]] was at a peak, and Stoker's formula of an invasion of England by continental European influences was by 1897 very familiar to readers of fantastic adventure stories. Victorian readers enjoyed it as a good adventure story like many others, but it would not reach its iconic legendary status until later in the 20th century when film versions began to appear.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nina Auerbach]] and [[David Skal]], editors. ''Dracula''. Norton Critical Edition. 1997. ISBN 0393970124. Preface, first paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[File:Henry Irving portrait.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Shakespearean actor and friend of Stoker's, [[Henry Irving|Sir Henry Irving]] was a real-life inspiration for the character of Dracula, tailor-made to his dramatic presence, gentlemanly mannerisms and affinity for playing villain roles. Irving, however, never agreed to play the part on stage.]]

Before writing ''Dracula'', Stoker spent seven years researching European folklore and stories of vampires, being most influenced by [[Emily Gerard]]'s 1885 essay &quot;Transylvania Superstitions&quot;. 

Despite being the most well-known vampire novel, ''Dracula'' was not the first. It was preceded and partly inspired by [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]'s 1871 &quot;[[Carmilla]]&quot;, about a [[lesbian vampire]] who preys on a lonely young woman, and by ''[[Varney the Vampire]],'' a lengthy [[penny dreadful]] serial from the mid-Victorian period by [[James Malcolm Rymer]]. The image of a vampire portrayed as an aristocratic man, like the character of Dracula, was created by [[John Polidori]] in &quot;[[The Vampyre]]&quot; (1819), during the summer spent with [[Frankenstein]] creator [[Mary Shelley]], her husband, the poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and [[Lord Byron]] in 1816. The Lyceum Theatre, where Stoker worked between 1878 and 1898, was headed by the actor-manager [[Henry Irving]], who was Stoker's real-life inspiration for Dracula's mannerisms and who Stoker hoped would play Dracula in a stage version.&lt;ref name=&quot;warren&quot;&gt;Lewis S Warren, [http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/107.4/ah0402001124.html''Buffalo Bill Meets Dracula: William F. Cody, Bram Stoker, and the Frontiers of Racial Decay''], [[American Historical Review]], Vol. 107, No. 4, October 2002, paragraph 18&lt;/ref&gt; Although Irving never did agree to do a stage version, Dracula's dramatic sweeping gestures and gentlemanly mannerisms drew their living embodiment from Irving.&lt;ref name=&quot;warren&quot;/&gt;

''The Dead Un-Dead'' was one of Stoker's original titles for ''Dracula'', and up until a few weeks before publication, the manuscript was titled simply ''The Un-Dead''. Stoker's Notes for Dracula show that the name of the count was originally &quot;Count Wampyr&quot;, but while doing research, Stoker became intrigued by the name &quot;Dracula&quot;, after reading [[William Wilkinson (diplomat)|William Wilkinson]]'s book ''Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia with Political Observations Relative to Them'' (London 1820)&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=RogMAQAAMAAJ An account of the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia]  - William Wilkinson, Longman, 1820 (Google Free eBook)&lt;/ref&gt;, which he found in the Whitby Library, and consulted a number of times during visits to Whitby in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Radu R. Florescu]] and [[Raymond T. McNally]] ''Dracula, Prince of Many Faces''. Little Brown. 1989. ISBN 316286567. pp. 229-31.&lt;/ref&gt; The name Dracula was the family name of the descendants of [[Vlad II]] of [[Wallachia]], who took the name &quot;Dracul&quot; after being invested in the [[Order of the Dragon]] in 1431. In the Romanian language, the word ''dracul'' can mean either &quot;the dragon&quot; or, especially in the present day, &quot;the devil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond T. McNally]] and [[Radu R. Florescu]] ''In Search of Dracula, The History of Dracula and Vampires (Completely Revised)''. Houghton Mifflin. 1994. ISBN 395657830. pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel has been in the [[public domain]] in the United States since its original publication because Stoker failed to follow proper copyright procedure. In the United Kingdom and other countries following the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] on copyrights, however, the novel was under copyright until April 1962, fifty years after Stoker's death.&lt;ref&gt;''Lugosi v. Universal Pictures'',
70 Cal.App.3d 552 (1977), note 4.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[F. W. Murnau]]'s unauthorized film adaptation ''[[Nosferatu]]'' was released in 1922, the popularity of the novel increased considerably, owing to the controversy caused when Stoker's widow tried to have the film removed from public circulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/vampires/classicstory/dracula_p1.shtml —Article at the BBC Cult website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
When it was first published, in 1897, ''Dracula'' was not an immediate [[bestseller]], although reviewers were unstinting in their praise. The contemporary ''[[Daily Mail]]'' ranked Stoker's powers above those of [[Mary Shelley]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] as well as [[Emily Bronte]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Paul Murray's &quot;From the Shadow of Dracula: A Life of Bram Stoker&quot; 2004. pp. 363-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to literary historians [[Nina Auerbach]] and David Skal in the Norton Critical Edition, the novel has become more significant for modern readers than it was for contemporary Victorian readers, most of whom enjoyed it just as a good adventure story; it only reached its broad iconic legendary classic status later in the 20th century when the movie versions appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Nina Auerbach and David Skal, editors. ''Dracula''. Norton Critical Edition. 1997. ISBN 0393970124. Preface, first paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Victorian fans were ahead of the time, describing it as &quot;the sensation of the season&quot; and &quot;the most blood-curdling novel of the paralysed century&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dalby &quot;Bram Stoker&quot;, in Jack Sullivan (ed) ''The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural'', 1986, Viking, pp. 404-6, 405.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sherlock Holmes]] author [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] wrote to Stoker in a letter, &quot;I write to tell you how very much I have enjoyed reading ''Dracula''. I think it is the very best story of diablerie which I have read for many years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Klinger, page xxxii&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Daily Mail'' review of June 1, 1897 proclaimed it a classic of [[Gothic horror]], &quot;In seeking a parallel to this weird, powerful, and horrorful story our mind reverts to such tales as ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'', ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]'' ... but Dracula is even more appalling in its gloomy fascination than any one of these.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Nina Auerbach and David Skal, editors, ''Dracula'', Norton Critical Edition, 1997, pp. 363-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly good reviews appeared when the book was published in the U.S. in 1899.

==Historical and geographical references==
Although ''Dracula'' is a work of fiction, it does contain some historical references. The historical connections with the novel and how much Stoker knew about the history are a matter of conjecture and debate.

Following the publication of ''In Search of Dracula'' by [[Radu Florescu]] and Raymond McNally in 1972, the supposed connections between the historical [[Transylvanian]]-born [[Vlad III Dracula]] of [[Wallachia]] and Bram Stoker's fictional Dracula attracted popular attention. During his main reign (1456–1462), &quot;Vlad the Impaler&quot; is said to have killed from 40,000 to 100,000 European civilians (political rivals, criminals and anyone else he considered &quot;useless to humanity&quot;), mainly by using his favourite method of impaling them on a sharp pole. The main sources dealing with these events are records by [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] settlers in neighbouring Transylvania, who had frequent clashes with Vlad III. Vlad III is revered as a folk hero by [[Romanian people|Romanians]] for driving off the invading Turks. His impaled victims are said to have included as many as 100,000 [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Turks]].

[[Image:Vlad Tepes 002.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Vlad the Impaler]]; also known as Vlad Dracula.]]

Historically, the name &quot;Dracula&quot; is derived from a secret fraternal order of knights called the [[Order of the Dragon]], founded by [[Sigismund of Luxembourg]] (king of [[Hungary]], [[Croatia]] and [[Bohemia]], and [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) to uphold [[Christianity]] and defend the Empire against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]]. [[Vlad II Dracul]], father of Vlad III, was admitted to the order around 1431 because of his bravery in fighting the Turks. From 1431 onward, Vlad II wore the emblem of the order and later, as ruler of Wallachia, his [[coin]]age bore the dragon symbol. The name Dracula means &quot;Son of Dracul&quot;.

Stoker came across the name Dracula in his reading on [[History of Romania|Romanian history]], and chose this to replace the name (''Count Wampyr'') that he had originally intended to use for his villain. However, some Dracula scholars, led by [[Elizabeth Miller]], have questioned the depth of this connection. They argue that Stoker in fact knew little of the historic Vlad III except for the name &quot;Dracula&quot;. There are sections in the novel where Dracula refers to his own background, and these speeches show that Stoker had some knowledge of Romanian history. Stoker mentions the Dracula who fought against the Turks, and was later betrayed by his brother, historical facts which unequivocably point to Vlad III: 

{{quote|Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula, indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! (Chapter 3, pp 19)}}

The Count's intended identity is later explicitly confirmed by Professor Van Helsing: 

{{quote|He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey-land. (Chapter 18, pp 145)}}

The Dracula legend as he created it and as it has been portrayed in films and television shows may be a compound of various influences. Many of Stoker's biographers and literary critics have found strong similarities to the earlier Irish writer [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]'s classic of the vampire genre, ''[[Carmilla]]''. In writing ''Dracula'', Stoker may also have drawn on stories about the [[sídhe]], some of which feature blood-drinking women. The folkloric figure of [[Abhartach]] has also been suggested as a source.

It has been suggested that Stoker was influenced by the history of Countess [[Elizabeth Bathory]], who was born in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Bathory is suspected to have tortured and killed anywhere between 36 and 700 young women over a period of many years, and it was commonly believed that she committed these crimes in order to bathe in or drink their blood, believing that this preserved her youth. In Elizabeth Miller's opinion, no credible evidence of blood-drinking or other blood crimes in the Bathory case has ever been found, however the stories and influence may explain why Dracula appeared younger after feeding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bathory.org/miller02.html Báthory Erzsébet - Elizabeth Bathory: Bram Stoker, Elizabeth Bathory, and Dracula (Elizabeth Miller)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have claimed the castle of Count Dracula was inspired by [[Slains Castle]], at which Bram Stoker was a guest of the 19th [[Earl of Erroll]]. However, since as Stoker visited the castle in 1895&amp;mdash;five years after work on ''Dracula'' had begun&amp;mdash;there is unlikely to be much connection. Many of the scenes in [[Whitby]] and [[London]] are based on real places that Stoker frequently visited, although in some cases he distorts the geography for the sake of the story.

It has been suggested that Stoker received much historical information from [[Ármin Vámbéry]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] professor he met at least twice. Miller argues &quot;there is nothing to indicate that the conversation included Vlad, vampires, or even Transylvania&quot; and that, &quot;furthermore, there is no record of any other correspondence between Stoker and Vámbéry, nor is Vámbéry mentioned in Stoker's notes for Dracula.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Miller, [http://www.blooferland.com/drc/images/Divorce.rtf Filing for Divorce Count Dracula vs Vlad Tepes] Dracula: The Shade and the Shadow, ed. Elizabeth Miller (Westcliff-on-Sea: Desert Island Books, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

{{details|Dracula in popular culture}}
The story of ''Dracula'' has been the basis for countless films and plays. Stoker himself wrote the first theatrical adaptation, which was presented at the Lyceum Theatre under the title ''Dracula, or The Undead'' shortly after the novel's publication and performed only once. Popular films include ''[[Dracula (1931 film)|Dracula]]'' (1931), ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' (alternative title: ''The Horror of Dracula'') (1958), and ''[[Dracula (1992 film)|Dracula]]'' (also known as ''Bram Stoker's Dracula'') (1992). Dracula was also adapted as ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922), a film directed by the [[Germany|German]] director [[F.W. Murnau]], while Stoker's widow was alive, and the filmmakers were forced to change the setting and the characters' names for copyright reasons. The vampire in ''Nosferatu'' is called Count Orlok rather than Count Dracula.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.draculas.info/gallery/picture_of_nosferatu-83/ Nosferatu], Dracula Info - Dracula between Hero and Vampire&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of Count Dracula has remained popular over the years, and many [[film]]s have used the character as a villain, while others have named him in their titles, such as ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'', ''[[The Brides of Dracula (film)|The Brides of Dracula]]'', and ''[[Zoltan, Hound of Dracula (film)|Zoltan, Hound of Dracula]]''. As of 2009, an estimated 217 films feature Dracula in a major role,&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb character|0002561|Count Dracula}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number second only to [[Sherlock Holmes]] (223 films).&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb character|0026631|Sherlock Holmes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most adaptations do not include all the major characters from the novel. The Count is always present, and [[Jonathan Harker|Jonathan]] and [[Mina Harker]], [[John Seward|Dr. Seward]], [[Abraham Van Helsing|Dr. Van Helsing]], and [[Renfield]] usually appear as well. The characters of Mina and Lucy are often combined into a single female role. Jonathan Harker and Renfield are also sometimes reversed or combined. [[Quincey Morris]] and [[Arthur Holmwood]] are usually omitted entirely.

==&quot;Dracula's Guest&quot;==
In 1914, two years after Stoker's death, the short story &quot;[[Dracula's Guest]]&quot; was posthumously published. It was, according to most contemporary critics, the deleted first (or second) chapter from the original manuscript&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0313292159&amp;id=As8cClbbGqgC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=%22dracula%27s+guest%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;sig=VEOUTtGcVGxutPvCUgIzJM23-ao |author=James Craig Holte |page=27 |title=''Dracula Film Adaptations'' |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the one which gave the volume its name,&lt;ref name=&quot;Belford2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0306810980&amp;id=hfzy5UPjAr0C |author=Barbara Belford |title=Bram Stoker and the Man Who Was Dracula |isbn=0-306-81098-0 |year=2002|accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|325}} but which the original publishers deemed unnecessary to the overall story.

&quot;Dracula's Guest&quot; follows an unnamed Englishman traveller (whom most readers identify as Jonathan Harker, assuming it is the same character from the novel) as he wanders around [[Munich]] before leaving for Transylvania. It is [[Walpurgis Night]], and in spite of the coachman's warnings, the young Englishman foolishly leaves his hotel and wanders through a dense forest alone. Along the way he feels he is being watched by a tall and thin stranger (possibly Count Dracula).

The short story climaxes in an old graveyard, where in a marble tomb (with a large iron stake driven into it), the Englishman encounters a sleeping female vampire called Countess Dolingen. This malevolent and beautiful vampire awakens from her marble [[bier]] to conjure a snowstorm before being struck by lightning and returning to her eternal prison. However, the Englishman's troubles are not quite over, as he is dragged away by an unseen force and rendered unconscious. He awakes to find a &quot;gigantic&quot; wolf lying on his chest and licking at his throat. However, the wolf merely keeps him warm and protects him until help arrives.

When the Englishman is finally taken back to his hotel, a telegram awaits him from his expectant host Dracula, with a warning about &quot;dangers from snow and wolves and night&quot;.

==Notes for Dracula==
In 2008, Robert Eighteen-Bisang and [[Elizabeth Miller]] published ''Bram Stoker's Notes for Dracula: A Facsimile Edition'' (Jefferson NC &amp; London: McFarland. ISBN 978-0-7864-3410-7) based on the materials from the [[Rosenbach Museum &amp; Library]], containing a complete set of Stoker's handwritten and typed notes. Notes are fully transcribed and annotated.

'''David Hume''' (7 May 1711 [26 April [[Old Style|O.S.]]] – 25 August 1776) was a Scottish philosopher, historian, economist, and essayist, known especially for his philosophical [[empiricism]] and [[skepticism]]. He is regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of [[Western philosophy]] and the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. Hume is often grouped with [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and a handful of others as a [[British Empiricism|British Empiricist]].&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Atherton, ed. ''The Empiricists: Critical Essays on Locke, Berkeley, and Hume''. [[Lanham, MD]]: [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1739), Hume strove to create a total [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] &quot;[[science of man]]&quot; that examined the [[psychological]] basis of [[human nature]]. In stark opposition to the [[rationalists]] who preceded him, most notably [[René Descartes|Descartes]], he concluded that [[desire]] rather than [[reason]] governed human behaviour, saying famously: &quot;Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions.&quot; A prominent figure in the [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptical philosophical tradition]] and a strong [[empiricist]], he argued against the existence of [[innate ideas]], concluding instead that humans have knowledge only of things they directly experience. Thus he divides perceptions between strong and lively &quot;impressions&quot; or direct sensations and fainter &quot;ideas,&quot; which are copied from impressions. He developed the position that mental behaviour is governed by &quot;custom&quot;; [[problem of induction|our use of induction]], for example, is justified only by our idea of the &quot;constant conjunction&quot; of causes and effects. Without direct impressions of a metaphysical &quot;self,&quot; he concluded that humans have no actual conception of the self, only of a [[bundle theory|bundle of sensations]] associated with the self. Hume advocated a [[Compatibilism|compatibilist]] theory of [[free will]] that proved extremely influential on subsequent [[moral philosophy]]. He was also a [[Moral sense theory|sentimentalist]] who held that ethics are based on feelings rather than abstract moral principles. Hume also examined the normative [[is–ought problem]]. He held notoriously ambiguous views of [[Christianity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/hume-religion |title=Hume on Religion |author=Paul Russel |date=May 17, 2010 |work=First published October 4, 2005 |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition) |accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but famously challenged the [[Teleological argument|argument from design]] in his ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779).

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] credited Hume with waking him up from his &quot;dogmatic slumbers&quot; and Hume has proved extremely influential on subsequent philosophy, especially on [[utilitarianism]], [[logical positivism]], [[William James]], [[philosophy of science]], early [[analytic philosophy]], cognitive philosophy, and other movements and thinkers. The philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]] proclaimed Hume's ''Treatise'' &quot;the founding document of [[cognitive science]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, Jerry. ''Hume Variations''. New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 2003, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Also famous as a prose stylist,&lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury, George, ed. ''Specimens of English Prose Style: From Malory to Macaulay''. London: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1907, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume pioneered the [[essay]] as a literary genre and engaged with contemporary intellectual luminaries such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Adam Smith]] (who acknowledged Hume's influence on his [[economics]] and [[political philosophy]]), [[James Boswell]], [[Joseph Butler]], and [[Thomas Reid]].

==Life==
David Hume, originally David Home, son of Joseph Home of [[Chirnside]], advocate, and Katherine Falconer, was born on 26 April 1711 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]) in a [[tenement]] on the north side of the [[Lawnmarket]] in [[Edinburgh]]. He changed his name in 1734 because the [[English people|English]] had difficulty pronouncing 'Home' in the Scottish manner. Throughout his life Hume, who never married, spent time occasionally at his family home at Ninewells by [[Chirnside]], [[Berwickshire]].

===Education===
[[File:David Hume 1754.jpeg|thumb|left|An engraving of Hume from his ''[[The History of England (David Hume)|The History of England]]'' Vol. I (1754)]]

Hume attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] at the unusually early age of twelve (possibly as young as ten) at a time when fourteen was normal. At first he considered a career in [[Scots law|law]], but came to have, in his words, &quot;an insurmountable aversion to everything but the pursuits of [[Philosophy]] and general Learning; and while [my family] fanceyed I was poring over [[Johannes Voet|Voet]] and [[Arnold Vinnius|Vinnius]], [[Cicero]] and [[Virgil]] were the Authors which I was secretly devouring&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''My Own Life''. In Norton, D. F. (ed.) (1993). ''The Cambridge Companion to Hume'', [[Cambridge University Press]], p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; He had little respect for the professors of his time, telling a friend in 1735, &quot;there is nothing to be learnt from a [[Professor]], which is not to be met with in Books&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to 'Jemmy' Birch, quoted in Mossner, E. C. (2001). ''The life of David Hume''. Oxford University Press. p. 626&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume made a philosophical discovery that opened up to him &quot;...a new Scene of Thought,&quot; which inspired him &quot;...to throw up every other Pleasure or Business to apply entirely to it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''A Kind of History of My Life''. In Norton, D. F. (ed.) (1993). ''The Cambridge Companion to Hume'', Cambridge University Press, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; He did not recount what this &quot;Scene&quot; was, and commentators have offered a variety of speculations.&lt;ref&gt;See Oliver A. Johnson, ''The Mind of David Hume'', (University of Illinois Press, 1995), pp. 8–9, for a useful presentation of varying interpretations of Hume's &quot;scene of thought&quot; remark&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this inspiration, Hume set out to spend a minimum of ten years reading and writing. He came to the verge of [[nervous breakdown]], after which he decided to have a more active life to better continue his learning.&lt;ref name = &quot;ogcpkr&quot;&gt;Mossner, 193&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
As Hume's options lay between a traveling tutorship and a stool in a merchant's office, he chose the latter. In 1734, after a few months occupied with commerce in [[Bristol]], he went to [[La Flèche]] in [[Anjou]], France. There he had frequent discourse with the [[Jesuits]] of the [[College of La Flèche]]. As he had spent most of his savings during his four years there while writing ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'',&lt;ref name = &quot;ogcpkr&quot;/&gt; he resolved &quot;to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired my independency, and to regard every object as contemptible except the improvements of my talents in literature&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HumeHistoryp352&quot; /&gt; He completed the ''Treatise'' at the age of 26.

Although many scholars today consider the ''Treatise'' to be Hume's most important work and one of the most important books in Western philosophy, the critics in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] at the time did not agree, describing it as &quot;abstract and unintelligible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mossner, 195&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite the disappointment, Hume later wrote, &quot;Being naturally of a cheerful and [[Humorism|sanguine]] temper, I soon recovered from the blow and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HumeHistoryp352&quot; /&gt; There, he wrote the ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature (Abstract)|Abstract]]''&lt;ref&gt;''An Abstract of a Book lately Published; Entitled, A Treatise of Human Nature, &amp;c. Wherein the Chief Argument of that Book is farther Illustrated and Explained'', (London, 1740)&lt;/ref&gt; Without revealing his authorship, he aimed to make his larger work more intelligible.

After the publication of ''Essays Moral and Political'' in 1744, Hume applied for the Chair of Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. However, the position was given to [[William Cleghorn]], after Edinburgh ministers petitioned the town council not to appoint Hume because he was seen as an [[atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Nobbs, 'The Political Ideas of William Cleghorn, Hume's Academic Rival', in ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', (1965), Vol. 26, No. 4: 575–586&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1745 [[Jacobite Rebellion]], Hume tutored the [[George Vanden-Bempde, 3rd Marquess of Annandale|Marquis of Annandale]] (1720–92), who was officially described as a &quot;lunatic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Old and New Edinburgh in the 18th Century'', (Glasgow, 1883), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; This engagement ended in disarray after about a year. But it was then that Hume started his great historical work ''[[The History of England (David Hume)|The History of England]]'', which took fifteen years and ran over a million words, to be published in six volumes in the period between 1754 and 1762, while also involved with the Canongate Theatre. In this context, he associated with [[Lord Monboddo]] and other [[Scottish Enlightenment]] luminaries in Edinburgh. From 1746, Hume served for three years as Secretary to [[James St Clair|Lieutenant-General St Clair]], and wrote ''Philosophical Essays Concerning Human Understanding'', later published as ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''. The ''Enquiry'' proved little more successful than the ''Treatise''.

Hume was charged with [[Christian heresy|heresy]], but he was defended by his young clerical friends, who argued that—as an [[atheist]]—he was outside the [[Church of Scotland|Church's]] jurisdiction. Despite his acquittal, Hume failed to gain the [[Professor of Moral Philosophy, Glasgow|Chair of Philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]].

It was after returning to Edinburgh in 1752, as he wrote in ''My Own Life'', that &quot;the Faculty of Advocates chose me their Librarian, an office from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the command of a large library&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''The History of Great Britain'', (London, 1754–56) p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; This resource enabled him to continue historical research for ''The History of England''.

Hume achieved great literary fame as a historian. His enormous ''The History of England'', tracing events from the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Invasion of Julius Caesar]] to the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], was a best-seller in its day. In it, Hume presented political man as a creature of habit, with a disposition to submit quietly to established government unless confronted by uncertain circumstances. In his view, only religious difference could deflect men from their everyday lives to think about political matters.

However, Hume's volume of ''Political Discourses'' (published by Kincaid &amp; [[Alexander Donaldson (bookseller)|Donaldson]], 1752)&lt;ref name=&quot;Sher&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sher|first=Richard B. |title=The Enlightenment &amp; the book: Scottish authors &amp; their publishers in eighteenth-century Britain, Ireland, &amp; America|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2006 |series=Chicago Studies in Ethnomusicology Series|pages=313|isbn=0226752526|url=http://books.google.com/?id=gB9liJb5o7UC&amp;pg=PA312&amp;dq=%22alexander+donaldson%22+bookstore&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the only work he considered successful on first publication.&lt;ref&gt;David Hume (1776). ''My Own Life''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
[[File:Humetomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of David Hume in [[Edinburgh]]]]

Hume wrote a great deal on religion. However, the question of what were Hume's personal views on religion is a difficult one.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 2008, O'Connor, 2001, and Norton, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Church of Scotland]] seriously considered bringing charges of infidelity against him.&lt;ref&gt;Mossner, E. C. (2001). The life of David Hume. Oxford University Press. p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; He never declared himself to be an atheist, but had he been hostile to religion Hume would have been persecuted and his writings constrained, perhaps the reason behind his ambiguity. He did not acknowledge his authorship of many of his works in this area until close to his death, and some were not even published until afterwards.

In works such as ''On Superstition and Enthusiasm'', Hume specifically seems to support the standard religious views of his time and place. This still meant that he could be very critical of the [[Catholic Church]], referring to it with the standard Protestant epithets and descriptions of it as superstition and idolatry&lt;ref&gt;Hume. D. ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' &quot;... the gradual progress of the Catholic superstition ...&quot;; and ''On Superstition and Enthusiasm'': &quot;Modern Judaism and popery especially the latter being the most unphilosophical and absurd superstitions which have yet been known in the world ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as dismissing what his compatriots saw as uncivilised beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D, ''The Natural History of Religion'' &quot;... our present experience concerning the principles and opinions of barbarous nations. The savage tribes of America Africa and Asia are all idolaters.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He also considered extreme Protestant sects, which he called ''enthusiasts'', to be corrupters of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D, ''Of Superstition and Enthusiasm'': &quot;the corruption of the best things produces the worsts is grown into a max im and is commonly proved among other instances by the pernicious effects of superstition and enthusiasm the corruptions of true religion.&quot; and &quot;... all enthusiasts have been free from the yoke of ecclesiastics and have exprest great independence in their devotion with a contempt of forms ceremonies and traditions. The ''quakers'' are the most egregious tho at the same time the most innocent enthusiasts ... The ''independents'' of all the English sectaries approach nearest to the quakers in fanaticism and in their freedom from priestly bondage The ''presbytarians'' follow after at an equal distance in both these particulars ...&lt;/ref&gt; Yet he also put forward arguments that suggested that polytheism had much to commend it in preference to monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D, ''The Natural History of Religion'' &quot;... Where the deity is represented as infinitely superior to mankind this belief tho altogether just is apt ... to represent the monkish virtues of mortification penance humility and passive suffering as the only qualities which are acceptable to him. But where the gods are conceived to be only a little superior to mankind and to have been many of them advanced that inferior rank we are more at our ease in our addresses to them and may even without profaneness aspire sometimes to a rivalship and emulation of them.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In his works, he attacked many of the basic assumptions of religion and Christian belief, and his arguments have become the foundation of much of the succeeding secular thinking about religion. In his ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'', one of his protagonists challenged one of the intellectual arguments for belief in God or one god (especially in the [[Age of Enlightenment]]): the [[Argument from Design]]. Also, in his [[Of Miracles]], he challenged the idea that religion (specifically Christianity) is supported by [[revelation]].

Nevertheless, he was capable of writing in the introduction to his [[The Natural History of Religion]] &quot;The whole frame of nature bespeaks an intelligent author&quot;. In spite of that, he writes at the end of the essay: &quot;Examine the religious principles, which have, in fact, prevailed in the world. You will scarcely be persuaded, that they are anything but sick men's dreams&quot;, and &quot;Doubt, uncertainty, suspence of judgement appear the only result of our most accurate scrutiny, concerning this subject&quot;.

It is likely that Hume was skeptical both about religious belief (at least as demanded by the religious organisations of his time) and of the complete atheism promoted by such contemporaries as [[Baron d'Holbach]]. Russell (2008) suggests that perhaps Hume's position is best characterised by the term &quot;irreligion&quot;. O'Connor (2001, p19) writes that Hume &quot;did not believe in the God of standard theism. ... but he did not rule out all concepts of deity&quot;. Also, &quot;ambiguity suited his purposes, and this creates difficulty in definitively pinning down his final position on religion&quot;.

===Later life===
From 1763 to 1765, Hume was Secretary to Lord Hertford in Paris. He met and later fell out with [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. He wrote of his Paris life, &quot;I really wish often for the plain roughness of [[The Poker Club]] of Edinburgh ... to correct and qualify so much lusciousness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mossner, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; For a year from 1767, Hume held the appointment of Under Secretary of State for the Northern Department. In 1768, he settled in [[Edinburgh]]; he lived from 1771 until his death in 1776 at the southwest corner of St. Andrew's Square, in Edinburgh's [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]], at what is now 21 Saint David Street.  (A popular story, consistent with some historical evidence,&lt;ref&gt;Mossner, Appendix H&lt;/ref&gt; suggests the street was named after Hume.)

[[James Boswell]] saw Hume a few weeks before his death (most likely of either bowel or liver [[cancer]]). Hume told him he sincerely believed it a &quot;most unreasonable fancy&quot; that there might be life after death.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, J. ''Boswell in Extremes'', 1776–1778&lt;/ref&gt; This meeting was dramatized in semi-fictional form for the [[BBC]] by [[Michael Ignatieff]] as ''Dialogue in the Dark''. Hume asked that he be interred in a &quot;simple roman tomb&quot;; in his will he requests that it be inscribed only with his name and the year of his birth and death, &quot;leaving it to Posterity to add the Rest.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mossner, p. 591&lt;/ref&gt;  It stands, as he wished it, on the southeastern slope of [[Calton Hill]], in the [[Old Calton Cemetery]], not far from his New Town home.

==Science of man==
[[File:Statue of David Hume.jpg|thumb|left|200 px| A statue of Hume by [[Alexander Stoddart]] on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh]]

In the introduction to ''A Treatise of Human Nature'', Hume writes &quot;'Tis evident, that all the sciences have a relation, more or less, to human nature ... Even ''Mathematics'', ''Natural Philosophy'', and ''Natural Religion'', are in some measure dependent on the science of Man&quot;. Also, &quot;the science of man is the only solid foundation for the other sciences&quot;, and the method for this science assumes &quot;experience and observation&quot; as the foundations of a logical argument.&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''A Treatise of Human Nature'', (New York: Dover, 2003 edition), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Because &quot;Hume's plan is to extend to philosophy in general the methodological limitations of [[Newtonian physics]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Copplestone, F., ''A history of Philosophy'', v. 6, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Hume is characterised as an [[empiricism|empiricist]].

Until recently, Hume was seen as a forerunner of the [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] movement; a form of anti-metaphysical empiricism. According to the logical positivists, unless a statement could be verified by experience, or else was true or false by definition (i.e. either [[tautology (logic)|tautological]] or [[contradiction|contradictory]]), then it was meaningless (this is a summary statement of their [[verificationism|verification principle]]). Hume, on this view, was a proto-positivist, who, in his philosophical writings, attempted to demonstrate how ordinary propositions about objects, causal relations, the self, and so on, are [[logical equivalence|semantically equivalent]] to propositions about one's experiences.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Ayer, ''Language, Truth and Logic'', (Penguin, 2001 edition), pp. 40ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commentators have since rejected this understanding of Humean empiricism, stressing an [[epistemology|epistemological]], rather than a [[semantics|semantic]] reading of his project.&lt;ref name=&quot;CraigStrawsonWright&quot;&gt;See, e.g.,
*Edward Craig, The Mind of God and the Works of Man, Ch.2
*Galen Strawson, ''The Secret Connexion'', (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989)
*John Wright, ''The Sceptical Realism of David Hume'', (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, Hume's empiricism consisted in the idea that it is our knowledge, and not our ability to conceive, that is restricted to what can be experienced. To be sure, Hume thought that we can form beliefs about that which extends beyond any possible experience, through the operation of faculties such as custom and the imagination, but he was skeptical about claims to ''knowledge'' on this basis.

===Induction===
The cornerstone of Hume's epistemology is the so-called [[problem of induction|Problem of Induction]]. It has been argued that it is in this area of Hume's thought that his skepticism about human powers of reason is the most pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Kenyon, 'Doubts about the Concept of Reason', in ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume'', Vol. 59, (1985), 249–267&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the problem of induction, then, is central to grasping Hume's general philosophical system.

The problem concerns the explanation of how we are able to make [[inductive reasoning|inductive inferences]]. Inductive inference is reasoning from the observed behaviour of objects to their behaviour when unobserved; as Hume says, it is a question of how things behave when they go &quot;beyond the present testimony of the senses, and the records of our memory&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Hume notices that we tend to believe that things behave in a regular manner; i.e., that patterns in the behaviour of objects will persist into the future, and throughout the unobserved present. This persistence of regularities is sometimes called [[Uniformitarianism]] or the Principle of the Uniformity of Nature.

Hume's argument is that we cannot rationally justify the claim that nature will continue to be uniform, as justification comes in only two varieties, and both of these are inadequate. The two sorts are: (1) demonstrative reasoning, and (2) probable reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;These are Hume's terms. It has been argued that, in modern parlance, demonstration is deductive reasoning, and probability is inductive reasoning: see {{Cite web|url=http://www.davidhume.org/documents/1996PhD.pdf |title=Hume, Induction and Probability |author=Dr. Peter J. R. Millican's |date= |work=D.Phil thesis |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to (1), Hume argues that the uniformity principle cannot be demonstrated, as it is &quot;consistent and conceivable&quot; that nature might stop being regular.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Turning to (2), Hume argues that we cannot hold that nature will continue to be uniform because it has been in the past, as this is using the very sort of reasoning (induction) that is under question: it would be [[circular reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Thus no form of justification will rationally warrant our inductive inferences.

Hume's solution to this skeptical problem is to argue that, rather than reason, it is natural instinct that explains our ability to make inductive inferences. He asserts that &quot;Nature, by an absolute and uncontroulable {{sic}} necessity has determin'd us to judge as well as to breathe and feel&quot;. Although many modern commentators have demurred from Hume's solution,&lt;ref name=&quot;harris2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Errol E. |authorlink=Errol Harris |year=2004 |title=Hypothesis and Perception: The Roots of Scientific Method |series=Muirhead Library of Philosophy |volume=10 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=9780415296151 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uBbfizzKTDoC&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;pg=PA42 |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; some have concurred with it, seeing his analysis of our epistemic predicament as a major contribution to the theory of knowledge. For example, the Oxford Professor John D. Kenyon writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Reason might manage to raise a doubt about the truth of a conclusion of natural inductive inference just for a moment in the study, but the forces of nature will soon overcome that artificial skepticism, and the sheer agreeableness of animal faith will protect us from excessive caution and sterile suspension of belief.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Kenyon, 'Doubts about the Concept of Reason', in ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume'', Vol. 59, (1985), p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Causation===
The notion of [[Causality|causation]] is closely linked to the problem of induction. According to Hume, we reason inductively by associating constantly conjoined events, and it is the mental act of association that is the basis of our concept of causation. There are three main interpretations of Hume's theory of causation represented in the literature: (1) the logical positivist; (2) the skeptical realist; and (3) the quasi-realist.

The logical positivist interpretation is that Hume analyses causal propositions, such as &quot;A caused B&quot;, in terms of regularities in perception: &quot;A caused B&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Whenever A-type events happen, B-type ones follow&quot;, where &quot;whenever&quot; refers to all possible perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;For this account of Hume's views on causation,
* A. J. Ayer, ''Language, Truth and Logic'', (Penguin, 2001 edition), pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
power and necessity... are... qualities of perceptions, not of objects... felt by the soul and not perceived externally in bodies&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''A Treatise of Human Nature'', (New York: Dover, 2003 edition), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This view is rejected by [[skepticism|skeptical]] [[Philosophical realism|realists]], who argue that Hume thought that causation amounts to more than just the regular succession of events.&lt;ref name=&quot;CraigStrawsonWright&quot; /&gt; When two events are causally conjoined, a necessary connection underpins the conjunction:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Shall we rest contented with these two relations of contiguity and succession, as affording a complete idea of causation? By no means ... there is a ''necessary connexion'' to be taken into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''A Treatise of Human Nature'', (New York: Dover, 2003 edition), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hume held that we have no perceptual access to the necessary connection (hence ''skepticism''), but we are naturally compelled to believe in its objective existence (hence ''realism'').

It has been argued that, whilst Hume did not think causation is reducible to pure regularity, he was not a fully fledged realist either: Simon Blackburn calls this a [[quasi-realism|quasi-realist]] reading.&lt;ref&gt;See S. Blackburn, ‘Hume and Thick Connexions', in ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', Vol. 50, Supplement. (Autumn, 1990), pp. 237–250&lt;/ref&gt; On this view, talk about causal necessity is an expression of a functional change in the human mind, whereby certain events are predicted or anticipated on the basis of prior experience. The expression of causal necessity is a [[projectivism|&quot;projection&quot;]] of the functional change onto the objects involved in the causal connection: in Hume's words, &quot;nothing is more usual than to apply to external bodies every internal sensation which they occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', p. 147, fn.17&lt;/ref&gt;

===The self===
According to the standard interpretation of Hume on [[Personal identity (philosophy)|personal identity]], he was a [[bundle theory|Bundle Theorist]], who held that the self is nothing but a bundle of interconnected perceptions linked by the property of constancy and coherence; or, more accurately, that our idea of the self is just the idea of such a bundle. This view is forwarded by, for example, positivist interpreters, who saw Hume as suggesting that terms such as &quot;self&quot;, &quot;person&quot;, or &quot;mind&quot; referred to collections of &quot;sense-contents&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;For this account of Hume on the self,
* A. J. Ayer, ''Language, Truth and Logic'', (Penguin, 2001 edition), pp. 135–6&lt;/ref&gt; A modern-day version of the bundle theory of the mind has been advanced by [[Derek Parfit]] in his [[Reasons and Persons]] (1986).

However, some philosophers have criticised the bundle-theory interpretation of Hume on personal identity. They argue that distinct selves can have perceptions that stand in relations of similarity and causality with one another. Thus perceptions must already come parceled into distinct &quot;bundles&quot; before they can be associated according to the relations of similarity and causality: in other words, the mind must already possess a unity that cannot be generated, or constituted, by these relations alone. Since the bundle-theory interpretation attributes Hume with answering an ontological or conceptual question, philosophers who see Hume as not very concerned with such questions have queried whether the view is really Hume's, or &quot;only a decoy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Craig, The Mind of God and the Works of Man, Ch.2&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it is suggested, Hume might have been answering an epistemological question, about the causal origin of our concept of the self.

Another interpretation of Hume's view of the self has been argued for by James Giles.&lt;ref&gt;James Giles, ''No Self to be Found: the Search for Personal Identity'' University Press of America, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, Hume is not arguing for a bundle theory, which is a form of reductionism, but rather for an eliminative view of the self. That is, rather than reducing the self to a bundle of perceptions, Hume is rejecting the idea of the self altogether. On this interpretation Hume is proposing a 'No-Self Theory' and thus has much in common with Buddhist thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giles | first1 = James | year = 1993 | title = The No-Self Theory: Hume, Buddhism, and Personal Identity | url = | journal = Philosophy East and West | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 175–200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practical reason===
Hume's anti-rationalism informed much of his theory of belief and knowledge, in his treatment of the notions of induction, causation, and the external world. But it was not confined to this sphere, and permeated just as strongly his theories of motivation, action, and morality. In a famous sentence in the ''Treatise'', Hume circumscribes reason's role in the production of action:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.&lt;ref&gt;''Treatise'', p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been suggested that this position can be lucidly brought out through the metaphor of &quot;[[direction of fit]]&quot;: beliefs—the paradigmatic products of reason—are propositional attitudes that aim to have their content fit the world; conversely, desires—or what Hume calls passions, or sentiments—are states that aim to fit the world to their contents.&lt;ref&gt;The metaphor of direction of fit in this sense has been traced back to Elizabeth Anscombe's work on intention: ''Intention'' (2nd Edition), (1963, Oxford: Basil Blackwell)&lt;/ref&gt; Though a metaphor, it has been argued that this intuitive way of understanding Hume's theory that desires are necessary for motivation &quot;captures something quite deep in our thought about their nature&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SmithV96N381&quot;&gt;M. Smith, 'The Humean Theory of Motivation', ''Mind'', New Series, Vol. 96, No. 381 (Jan., 1987), pp. 36–61&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's anti-rationalism has been very influential, and defended in contemporary philosophy of action by neo-Humeans such as [[Michael A. Smith|Michael Smith]]&lt;ref name=&quot;SmithV96N381&quot; /&gt; and [[Simon Blackburn]]&lt;ref&gt;S. Blackburn, 'Practical Tortoise Raising', ''Mind'', New Series, Vol. 104, No. 416 (Oct., 1995), pp. 695–711&lt;/ref&gt; The major opponents of the Humean view are cognitivists about what it is to act for a reason, such as [[John McDowell]],&lt;ref&gt;J. McDowell, 'Non-Cognitivism and Rule-Following', in S. Holtzman and C. Leich, ''Wittgenstein: To Follow A Rule'', (1981, London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul)&lt;/ref&gt; and Kantians, such as [[Christine Korsgaard]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Korsgaard, 'Scepticism about Practical Reason', ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 83, No. 1 (Jan., 1986), pp. 5–25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
Hume's views on human motivation and action formed the cornerstone of his ethical theory: he conceived moral or ethical sentiments to be intrinsically motivating, or the providers of reasons for action. Given that one cannot be motivated by reason alone, requiring the input of the passions, Hume argued that reason cannot be behind morality
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Morals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.&lt;ref&gt;''Treatise'', [[op. cit.]], p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hume's [[Moral sense theory|sentimentalism]] about morality was shared by his close friend [[Adam Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759), ed. K. Haakonssen, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and Hume and Smith were mutually influenced by the moral reflections of [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]].&lt;ref&gt;For Hutcheson's influence on Hume, see footnote 7. For his influence on Smith, see William L. Taylor, ''Francis Hutcheson and David Hume as Predecessors of Adam Smith'', (Durham: Duke University Press, 1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's theory of ethics has been influential in modern day ethical theory, helping to inspire various forms of [[emotivism]],&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Ayer. ''Language, Truth and Logic'', ch.6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. L. Stevenson. ''Ethics and Language'' (1944), (Yale: Yale UP, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; [[error theory]]&lt;ref&gt;[[J. L. Mackie|John Mackie]]. ''Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong'' (1977), (Penguin, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; and ethical [[expressivism]] and [[non-cognitivism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Blackburn]]. ''Ruling Passions: A Theory of Practical Reasoning'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; and Alan Gibbard&lt;!-- non-sequitur? --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;''Wise Choices, Apt Feelings: A Theory of Normative Judgment'', (Harvard: Harvard UP, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free will, determinism, and responsibility===
Hume, along with [[Thomas Hobbes]], is cited as a classical [[Compatibilism|compatibilist]] about the notions of [[free will|freedom]] and [[determinism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/#3 |title=Compatibilism |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis of compatibilism seeks to reconcile human freedom with the mechanist belief that human beings are part of a deterministic universe, whose happenings are governed by the [[laws of physics]].

Hume argued that the dispute about the compatibility of freedom and determinism has been kept afloat by ambiguous terminology:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
From this circumstance alone, that a controversy has been long kept on foot... we may presume, that there is some ambiguity in the expression.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hume defines the concepts of &quot;necessity&quot; and &quot;liberty&quot; as follows:

Necessity: &quot;the uniformity, observable in the operations of nature; where similar objects are constantly conjoined together..&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberty: &quot;''a power of acting or not acting, according to the determinations of the will''..&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HumeEnquiryp159&quot; /&gt;

Hume then argues that, according to these definitions, not only are the two compatible, but Liberty ''requires'' Necessity. For if our actions were not necessitated in the above sense, they would &quot;...have so little in connexion with motives, inclinations and circumstances, that one does not follow with a certain degree of uniformity from the other.&quot; But if our actions are not thus hooked up to the will, then our actions can never be free: they would be matters of &quot;chance; which is universally allowed not to exist&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HumeEnquiryp159&quot;&gt;Hume, D. ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Hume goes on to argue that in order to be held morally responsible, it is required that our behaviour be caused, i.e. necessitated, for

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Actions are, by their very nature, temporary and perishing; and where they proceed not from some ''cause'' in the character and disposition of the person who performed them, they can neither redound to his honour, if good; nor infamy, if evil&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This argument has inspired modern day commentators.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., R. E. Hobart, ‘Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It', ''Mind'' 43 (1934), pp. 1–27&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been argued that the issue of whether or not we hold one another morally responsible does not ultimately depend on the truth or falsity of a metaphysical thesis such as determinism, for our so holding one another is a non-rational human sentiment that is not predicated on such theses. For this influential argument, which is still made in a Humean vein, see [[P. F. Strawson]]'s essay, ''Freedom and Resentment''.&lt;ref&gt;First published in 1962 and reprinted in Gary Watson, ed., Free Will
(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1982), pp. 59–80; second edition 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem of miracles===
In his discussion of [[miracle]]s in ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]'' (Section 10) Hume defines a miracle as &quot;a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent&quot;. Given that Hume argues that it is impossible to deduce the existence of a Deity from the existence of the world (for he says that causes cannot be determined from effects), miracles (including prophesy) are the only possible support he would conceivably allow for theistic religions.

Hume discusses everyday belief as often resulted from probability, where we believe an event that has occurred most often as being most likely, but that we also subtract the weighting of the less common event from that of the more common event. In the context of miracles, this means that a miraculous event should be labelled a miracle only where it would be even more unbelievable (by principles of probability) for it not to be. Hume mostly discusses miracles as testimony, of which he writes that when a person reports a miraculous event we [need to] balance our belief in their veracity against our belief that such events do not occur. Following this rule, only where it is considered, as a result of experience, less likely that the testimony is false than that a miracle occur should we believe in miracles.

Although Hume leaves open the possibility for miracles to occur and be reported, he offers various arguments against this ever having happened in history:&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D (1748), 'Of miracles‘, in ''An Enquiry concerning human understanding'', LA Selby-Bigge (ed.), 2nd edn, Oxford University Press, (1902), Section X, pp. 116–122&lt;/ref&gt;
* People often lie, and they have good reasons to lie about miracles occurring either because they believe they are doing so for the benefit of their religion or because of the fame that results.
* People by nature enjoy relating miracles they have heard without caring for their veracity and thus miracles are easily transmitted even where false.
* Hume notes that miracles seem to ''occur'' mostly in &quot;ignorant&quot; and &quot;barbarous&quot; nations and times, and the reason they don't occur in the &quot;civilized&quot; societies is such societies aren't awed by what they know to be natural events.
* The miracles of each religion argue against all other religions and their miracles, and so even if a proportion of all reported miracles across the world fit Hume's requirement for belief, the miracles of each religion make the other less likely.

Despite all this Hume observes that belief in miracles is popular, and that &quot;The gazing populace receive greedily, without examination, whatever soothes superstition and promotes wonder&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D (1748) &quot;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding.&quot; in Modern Philosophy: An Anthology of Primary Sources (R. Ariew, E. Watkins), Hackett 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have argued that Hume's position assumes the character of miracles and natural laws prior to any specific examination of miracle claims, and thus it amounts to a subtle form of begging the question. They have also noted that it requires an appeal to inductive inference, as none have observed every part of nature or examined every possible miracle claim (e.g., those yet future to the observer), which in Hume's philosophy was especially problematic.

Hume's main argument concerning miracles is the following. Miracles by definition are singular events that differ from the established Laws of Nature. The Laws of Nature are codified as a result of past experiences. Therefore a miracle is a violation of all prior experience. However the probability that something has occurred in contradiction of all past experience should always be judged to be less than the probability that either my senses have deceived me or the person recounting the miraculous occurrence is lying or mistaken, all of which I have past experience of. For Hume, this refusal to grant credence does not guarantee correctness – he offers the example of an Indian Prince, who having grown up in a hot country refuses to believe that water has frozen. By Hume's lights this refusal is not wrong and the Prince is thinking correctly; it is presumably only when he has had extensive experience of the freezing of water that he has warrant to believe that the event could occur. So for Hume, either the miraculous event will become a recurrent event or else it will never be rational to believe it occurred. The connection to religious belief is left inexplicit throughout, save for the close of his discussion wherein Hume notes the reliance of Christianity upon testimony of miraculous occurrences and makes an ironic &lt;ref&gt;[[J. L. Mackie|Mackie, J. L.]] ''The Miracle of Theism'' (Oxford: Oxford: University Press, 1982), 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buckle, Stephen, ''Hume's Enlightenment Tract: The Unity and Purpose of An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2001), 269–74&lt;/ref&gt; remark that anyone who &quot;is moved by faith to assent&quot; to revealed testimony &quot;is aware of a continued miracle in his own person, which subverts all principles of his understanding, and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and experience.&quot;

===Design argument===
One of the oldest and most popular [[existence of God|arguments for the existence of God]] is [[teleological argument|the design argument]]: that order and &quot;purpose&quot; in the world bespeaks a divine origin. Hume gave the classic criticism of the design argument in ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'' and ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]''. Hume argued that for the design argument to be feasible, it must be true that order and purpose are observed only when they result from design. But order is often observed to result from presumably mindless processes like the generation of snowflakes and crystals. Design can account for only a tiny part of our experience of order. Furthermore, the design argument is based on an incomplete analogy. Because of our experience with objects, we can recognise human-designed ones, as when we compare a pile of stones with a constructed wall, but to deduce that the Universe is designed, we would need to have an experience of a range of different universes. As we only experience one, the analogy cannot be applied. We must ask therefore if it is right to compare the world to a machine—as in [[William Paley|Paley]]'s [[watchmaker analogy]]—when perhaps it could be better described as a giant inert animal. Even if the design argument is completely successful, it could not (in and of itself) establish a robust theism. One could easily reach the conclusion that the universe's configuration is the result of some morally ambiguous, possibly unintelligent agent or agents whose method bears only a remote similarity to human design. In this way it could be asked, if the Universe is designed, is the designer God? It could also be asked, if there is a designer god, who designed the designer? If a well-ordered natural world requires a special designer, then God's mind (being so well-ordered) ''also'' requires a special designer. Then this designer would need a designer, and so on ''ad infinitum''. Furthermore, if we could be happy with an inexplicably self-ordered divine mind, why should we not rest content with an inexplicably self-ordered natural world? Often, what appears to be purpose, where it looks like object X has feature F in order to secure outcome O, is better explained by a filtering process: that is, object X wouldn't be around did it not possess feature F, and outcome O is only interesting to us as a human projection of goals onto nature. This mechanical explanation of [[teleology]] anticipated [[natural selection]].

===Political theory===
{{Utilitarianism}}

It is difficult to categorize Hume's political affiliations. His thought contains elements that are, in modern terms, both [[conservative]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]], as well as ones that are both [[contractarian]] and [[utilitarian]], though these terms are all anachronistic. [[Thomas Jefferson]] banned Hume's ''History'' from the [[University of Virginia]], fearing that it &quot;has spread universal toryism over the land&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=673&amp;chapter=159422&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |title=David Hume: Prophet of the Counter-revolution (1965) |author= Laurence L. Bongie |date= |work= |publisher=The Online Library of Liberty |accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, [[Samuel Johnson]] thought Hume &quot;a Tory by chance... for he has no principle. If he is anything, he is a [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbist]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=652&amp;chapter=62199&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27#lf1223_footnote_nt841 |title=LETTER LXXXIV.: The Bath Waters injurious: Complaints of Injustice: Hume's Autobiography: Dialogues on Natural Religion. – David Hume, Letters of David Hume to William Strahan (1756) |author=David Hume|date= |work=Note 13 |publisher=The Online Library of Liberty |accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His central concern is to show the importance of the rule of law, and stresses throughout his political ''Essays'' the importance of moderation in politics. This outlook needs to be seen within the historical context of eighteenth century Scotland, where the legacy of religious civil war, combined with the relatively recent memory of the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings, fostered in a historian such as Hume a distaste for enthusiasm and factionalism that appeared to threaten the fragile and nascent political and social stability of a country that was deeply politically and religiously divided. He thinks that society is best governed by a general and impartial system of laws, based principally on the &quot;artifice&quot; of contract; he is less concerned about the form of government that administers these laws, so long as it does so fairly (though he thought that republics were more likely to do so than monarchies).

Hume expressed suspicion of attempts to reform society in ways that departed from long-established custom, and he counselled peoples not to resist their governments except in cases of the most egregious [[tyranny]].&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1740). ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1817 edition, p. 286)&lt;/ref&gt; However, he resisted aligning himself with either of Britain's two political parties, the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and the [[Tories]]. Hume writes &lt;blockquote&gt;My views of ''things'' are more conformable to Whig principles; my representations of persons to Tory prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Mossner, EC., ''The life of David Hume'', 1954, reprinted 2001, OUP, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;McArthur says that Hume believed that we should try to balance our demands for liberty with the need for strong authority, without sacrificing either. McArthur characterizes Hume as a 'precautionary conservative': whose actions would have been &quot;determined by prudential concerns about the consequences of change, which often demand we ignore our own principles about what is ideal or even legitimate&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Neil McArthur, ''David Hume's political theory''. University of Toronto, 2007, pp.70 &amp; 124.&lt;/ref&gt; He supported [[liberty of the press]], and was sympathetic to [[democracy]], when suitably constrained. [[Douglass Adair]] has argued that Hume was a major inspiration for [[James Madison]]'s writings, and the ''[[Federalist No. 10]]'' in particular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/3816276 Adair, Douglass (1957) “‘That Politics Can be Reduced to a Science’: David Hume, James Madison, and the Tenth Federalist.” Huntington Library Quarterly 20: 343-360]&lt;/ref&gt; Hume was also, in general, an optimist about social progress, believing that, thanks to the economic development that comes with the expansion of trade, societies progress from a state of &quot;barbarism&quot; to one of &quot;civilisation&quot;. Civilised societies are open, peaceful and sociable, and their [[citizen]]s are as a result much happier. It is therefore not fair to characterise him, as [[Leslie Stephen]] did, as favouring &quot;...that stagnation which is the natural ideal of a [[skeptic]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Stephen, ''History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century'', 2 vols. (London: Smith, Elder and Co., 1876), vol. 2, 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it has been suggested Hume had no positive vision of the best society, he in fact produced an essay titled ''[[Idea of a Perfect Commonwealth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.econlib.org/LIBRARY/LFBooks/Hume/hmMPL39.html |title=Ida of a perfect Commonwealth |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty |accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which lays out what he thought was the best form of government. His pragmatism shone through, however, in his caveat that we should only seek to implement such a system should an opportunity present itself, which would not upset established structures. He defended a strict [[separation of powers]], [[decentralisation]], extending the [[Suffrage|franchise]] to anyone who held property of value and limiting the power of the [[clergy]]. The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[militia]] system was proposed as the best form of protection. Elections were to take place on an annual basis and representatives were to be unpaid. It is also important to note that the ideal commonwealth laid out by Hume was held to be ideal only for the British Isles in the 18th century. Hume was a relativist, and realized that such a form of government would not be ideal for all cultures, nor would it necessarily be permanent as historical conditions change.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Contributions to economic thought===
[[File:David Hume and Adam Smith statues.jpg|thumb|right|Statues of David Hume and Adam Smith by David Watson Stevenson on the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in [[Edinburgh]]]]
Through his discussions on politics, Hume developed many ideas that are prevalent in the field of [[economics]]. This includes ideas on private property, inflation, and foreign trade.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Lionel ''A History of Economic Thought: The LSE Lectures'' edited by Medema and Samuels. Ch 11 and 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume does not believe, as Locke does, that [[private property]] is a natural right, but he argues that it is justified since resources are limited. If all goods were unlimited and available freely, then private property would not be justified, but instead becomes an &quot;idle ceremonial&quot;. Hume also believed in unequal distribution of property, because perfect equality would destroy the ideas of thrift and industry. Perfect equality would thus lead to impoverishment.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David ''An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals'' (1751)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume did not believe that foreign trade produced specie, but considered trade a stimulus for a country's economic growth. He did not consider the volume of world trade as fixed because countries can feed off their neighbors' wealth, being part of a &quot;prosperous community&quot;. The fall in foreign demand is not that fatal, because in the long run, a country cannot preserve a leading trading position.

Hume was among the first to develop automatic [[Price specie flow mechanism|price-specie flow]], an idea that contrasts with the [[mercantile system]]. Simply put, when a country increases its in-flow of gold, this in-flow of gold will result in price inflation, and then price inflation will force out countries from trading that would have traded before the inflation. This results in a decrease of the in-flow of gold in the long run.

Hume also proposed a theory of beneficial inflation. He believed that increasing the money supply would raise production in the short run. This phenomenon would be caused by a gap between the increase in the money supply and that of the price level. The result is that prices will not rise at first and may not rise at all. This theory was later developed by [[John Maynard Keynes]]. &lt;!--Is Hume's theory really that similar to Keynesian economics?--&gt;

==As historian of England==
Between Hume's death and 1894, there were at least 50 editions of his 6-volume ''[[The History of England (David Hume)|History of England]]'', a work of immense sweep. The subtitle tells us as much, &quot;From the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688&quot;.

There was also an often-reprinted abridgement, ''The Student's Hume'' (1859).

Another remarkable feature of the series was that it widened the focus of history, away from merely Kings, Parliaments, and armies, including literature and science as well.

==Works==
* ''A Kind of History of My Life'' (1734) Mss 23159 [[National Library of Scotland]]. A letter to an unnamed physician, asking for advice about &quot;the Disease of the Learned&quot; that then afflicted him. Here he reports that at the age of eighteen &quot;there seem'd to be open'd up to me a new Scene of Thought...&quot; that made him &quot;throw up every other Pleasure or Business&quot; and turned him to scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
* ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects''. (1739–40) Hume intended to see whether the [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/hume/david/h92t/ ''Treatise of Human Nature''] met with success, and if so to complete it with books devoted to Politics and Criticism. However, it did not meet with success. As Hume himself said, &quot;It fell ''dead-born from the press'', without reaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HumeHistoryp352&quot;&gt;David Hume, ''A Kind of History of My Life''. In Norton, D. F. (ed.) (1993). ''The Cambridge Companion to Hume'', Cambridge University Press, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; and so was not completed.
* ''An Abstract of a Book lately Published: Entitled A Treatise of Human Nature etc''. (1740) Anonymously published, but almost certainly written by Hume&lt;ref&gt;For this see the introduction by J. M. Keynes and P. Sraffa in: Hume, David (1965). ''An abstract of A treatise of Human Nature 1740. Connecticut: Archon Books&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to popularise his ''Treatise''. Of considerable philosophical interest, because it spells out what he considered &quot;The Chief Argument&quot; of the ''Treatise'', in a way that seems to anticipate the structure of the ''Enquiry concerning Human Understanding''.
* ''Essays Moral and Political'' (first ed. 1741–2) A collection of pieces written and published over many years, though most were collected together in 1753–4. Many of the essays are focused on topics in politics and economics, though they also range over questions of aesthetic judgement, love, marriage and polygamy, and the demographics of ancient Greece and Rome, to name just a few of the topics considered. The Essays show some influence from [[Joseph Addison|Addison]]'s ''Tatler'' and ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', which Hume read avidly in his youth.
* ''A Letter from a Gentleman to His Friend in Edinburgh: Containing Some Observations on a Specimen of the Principles concerning Religion and Morality, said to be maintain'd in a Book lately publish'd, intituled A Treatise of Human Nature etc''. Edinburgh (1745). Contains a letter written by Hume to defend himself against charges of atheism and scepticism, while applying for a Chair at Edinburgh University.
* ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1748) Contains reworking of the main points of the ''Treatise'', Book 1, with the addition of material on free will (adapted from Book 2), miracles, the Design Argument, and mitigated scepticism. ''[[Of Miracles]]'', section X of the ''Enquiry'', was often published separately,
* ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'' (1751) A reworking of material from Book 3 of the ''Treatise'', on morality, but with a significantly different emphasis. Hume regarded this as the best of all his philosophical works{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, both in its philosophical ideas and in its literary style.
* ''Political Discourses'', (part II of ''[[Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary]]'' within vol. 1 of the larger ''Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects'') Edinburgh (1752). Included in ''Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects'' (1753–6) reprinted 1758–77.
* ''Political Discourses''/''Discours politiques'' (1752–1758), ''My ovn life'' (1776), ''Of Essay writing'', 1742. Bilingual English-French (translated by Fabien Grandjean). Mauvezin, France, Trans-Europ-Repress, 1993, 22&amp;nbsp;cm, V-260 p. Bibliographic notes, index.
* ''[[Four Dissertations]]'' London (1757). Included in reprints of ''Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects'' (above).
* ''[[The History of England (David Hume)|The History of England]]'' (Sometimes referred to as ''[[The History of Great Britain]]'') (1754–62) Freely available in six vols. from the On Line Library of Liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/ToC/0011.php |title=The History of England, 6 vols. (1778) |author=David Hume |date= |work= |publisher=Online Library of Liberty |accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; More a category of books than a single work, Hume's history spanned &quot;from the invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution of 1688&quot; and went through over 100 editions. Many considered it ''the'' standard history of England until [[Thomas Macaulay]]'s ''History of England''.
* ''[[The Natural History of Religion]]'' (1757)
* &quot;My Own Life&quot; (1776) Penned in April, shortly before his death, this autobiography was intended for inclusion in a new edition of &quot;Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects&quot;. It was first published by [[Adam Smith]] who claimed that by doing so he had incurred &quot;ten times more abuse than the very violent attack I had made upon the whole commercial system of Great Britain&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} ([[Ernest Campbell Mossner]], The Life of David Hume)
* ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) Published posthumously by his nephew, David Hume the Younger. Being a discussion among three fictional characters concerning the nature of God, and is an important portrayal of the argument from design. Despite some controversy, most scholars agree that the view of Philo, the most sceptical of the three, comes closest to Hume's own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.onphilosophy.co.uk/natural_religion.html |title=Which character is Hume in the &quot;Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion |author=William Crouch |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hume's influence==
Attention to Hume's philosophical works grew after the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] credited Hume with awakening him from &quot;dogmatic slumbers&quot; (''circa'' 1770).&lt;ref&gt;''Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics'', Kant, 'Preface'&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], &quot;there is more to be learned from each page of David Hume than from the collected philosophical works of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]] and [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]] taken together&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 2, Ch. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer]] (1936), introducing his classic exposition of logical positivism, claimed: &quot;The views which are put forward in this treatise derive from the logical outcome of the [[empiricism]] of Berkeley and Hume.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Ayer (1936). ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]''. London&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]] (1915) wrote that he was inspired by Hume's positivism when formulating his [[Special Theory of Relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;in a letter of December 14, 1915, to Moritz Schlick (Papers, A, Vol. 8A, Doc.165)&lt;/ref&gt;
Hume was called &quot;the prophet of the [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinian]] revolution&quot; by N. Phillipson, referring to his view that mathematics and logic are closed systems, disguised tautologies, and have no relation to the world of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Phillipson, N. (1989). Hume, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London&lt;/ref&gt; David Fate Norton (1993) asserted that Hume was &quot;the first post-sceptical philosopher of the early modern period&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, D. F. (ed.) (1993). ''The Cambridge Companion to Hume'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 90–116&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's [[Problem of Induction]] was also of fundamental importance to the philosophy of [[Karl Popper]]. In his autobiography, ''Unended Quest'',&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper: ''Unended Quest; An Intellectual Autobiography'', 1976, ISBN 0-415-28590-9&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote: &quot;'Knowledge' ... is ''objective''; and it is hypothetical or conjectural. This way of looking at the problem made it possible for me to reformulate Hume's ''problem of induction''&quot;. This insight resulted in Popper's major work [[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper: The Logic of Scientific Discovery, 1934 (as Logik der Forschung, English translation 1959), ISBN 0-415-27844-9&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Conjectures and Refutations]], p 55, he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I approached the problem of induction through Hume. Hume, I felt, was perfectly right in pointing out that induction cannot be logically justified&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Dalton Trumbo''' (December 9, 1905 &amp;ndash; September 10, 1976) was an [[United States|American]] [[screenwriter]] and [[novelist]], and one of the [[Hollywood Ten]], a group of film professionals who refused to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) in 1947 during the committee's investigation of [[Communist]] influences in the motion picture industry. Trumbo won two [[Academy Awards]] while blacklisted; one originally given to a [[front (identity)|front]] writer, and one awarded to Robert Rich, Trumbo's pseudonym.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071008054115/http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2005/05.07.18.html AMPAS Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/trivia.html AMPAS Oscar Trivia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0874308/bio IMDb.com: Dalton Trumbo.] Retrieved 04-12-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Trumbo was born in [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]], [[Colorado]], and graduated from [[Grand Junction High School]] in nearby Grand Junction, Colorado. While still in high school, he worked as a cub reporter for the ''[[Grand Junction Daily Sentinel]]'', covering courts, the high school, the mortuary and civic organizations. He attended the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] for two years, working as a reporter for the ''Boulder Daily Camera'' and contributing to the campus humor magazine, the yearbook and the campus newspaper.

He got his professional start working for [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'']] magazine.

His first published novel, [[Eclipse (Trumbo)|''Eclipse'']] (1935), about a town and its people, was written in the social realist style and drew on his years in Grand Junction. The book was controversial in Grand Junction and helped give him an infamous reputation in this city. Years after his death he would be honored with a statue in front of the Avalon Theater on Main Street, depicted writing a screenplay in a bathtub.

He started in movies in 1937; by the 1940s, he was one of Hollywood's highest paid writers{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} for work on such films as ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'' (1944), ''[[Our Vines Have Tender Grapes]]'' (1945), and ''[[Kitty Foyle (film)|Kitty Foyle]]'' (1940), for which he was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay]].

Trumbo's 1939 [[anti-war]] novel, ''[[Johnny Got His Gun]]'', won a [[National Book Award]] (then known as an American Book Sellers Award) that year. The novel was inspired by an article Trumbo had read about a Canadian soldier who had lost all his limbs in [[World War I]] and was visited in hospital by the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/johnnygun/context.html Sparknotes.com.] Retrieved 04-12-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Trumbo married Cleo Fincher who was born in Fresno on July 17, 1916, and later moved with her divorced mother and her brother and sister to Los Angeles. Cleo Trumbo died of natural causes at the age of 93 on October 9, 2009 in the Bay Area city of Los Altos. At the time she was living with her eldest daughter Mitzi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Trumbo aligned himself with the [[Communist Party USA]] before the 1940s, although he did not join the party until later.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} After the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, American communists argued that the United States should not get involved in the war on the side of [[the United Kingdom]], since the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of nonaggression meant that the [[Soviet Union]] was at peace with [[Germany]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} 

In 1941, Trumbo wrote a novel ''The Remarkable Andrew'', in which, in one scene, the ghost of [[Andrew Jackson]] appears in order to caution the United States not to get involved in the war. In a review of the book, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' sarcastically wrote, &quot;General Jackson's opinions need surprise no one who has observed [[George Washington]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]] zealously following the Communist Party Line in recent years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,765251,00.html?iid=chix-sphere Counsel from Hollywood], Time Magazine, February 3, 1941&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the [[Operation Barbarossa|1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union]], Trumbo and his publisher decided to suspend reprinting of ''Johnny Got His Gun'' until the end of the war. During the war, Trumbo received letters from individuals &quot;denouncing Jews&quot; and using ''Johnny'' to support their arguments for &quot;an immediate negotiated peace&quot; with Nazi Germany; Trumbo reported these correspondents to the [[FBI]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pg 5&quot;&gt;Dalton Trumbo. ''Johnny Got His Gun''. Citadel Press, 2000, [http://books.google.com/books?id=LnnMLLk2uU4C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;output=html&amp;sig=roPgN-QwCYEEj0YKC0GC5dnEfC8 pg 5], introduction&lt;/ref&gt; Trumbo regretted this decision, which he called &quot;foolish&quot;. After two FBI agents showed up at his home, he understood that &quot;their interest lay not in the letters but in me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pg 5&quot;/&gt;

Trumbo was a member of the Communist Party USA from 1943 until 1948.&lt;ref&gt;''Naming Names'', [[Victor Navasky]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt; He bragged in ''[[The Daily Worker]]'' that among the films that communist influence in Hollywood had quashed were adaptations of [[Arthur Koestler]]'s [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] works ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' and ''The Yogi and the Commissar''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/27732.html Hollywood's Missing Movies: Why American films have ignored life under communism. - Reason Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blacklisting===
{{Main|Hollywood blacklist}}
During the [[McCarthy Era]] in 1947, Trumbo, along with nine other writers and directors, was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee as an unfriendly witness to testify on the presence of communist influence in [[Hollywood]]. Trumbo and the other nine refused to give information. After conviction for [[contempt of Congress]], he was [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]], and in 1950, spent 11 months in prison in the [[federal penitentiary]] in [[Ashland, Kentucky]].

After Trumbo was blacklisted, some Hollywood actors and directors, such as [[Elia Kazan]] and [[Clifford Odets]], agreed to testify and to provide names of fellow communist party members to Congress. Many of those who testified were immediately ostracized and shunned by their former friends and associates.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Trumbo always maintained that those who testified under pressure from HUAC and the studios were equally victims of the [[Second Red Scare|Red Scare]], an opinion for which he was criticized.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==Later life==
After completing his sentence, Trumbo and his family moved to [[Mexico]] with [[Hugo Butler]] and his wife [[Jean Rouverol]], who had also been blacklisted. There, Trumbo wrote 30 scripts under [[pseudonym]]s, such as ''[[Gun Crazy]]'' (1950), based on a short story by [[MacKinlay Kantor]], who was the front for the screenplay. It was not until 1992 that Trumbo's role was revealed.&lt;ref name=Apostolou&gt;[http://www.mysteryfile.com/Kantor/Crime_Fiction.html John Apostolou, &quot;MacKinlay Kantor&quot;], ''The Armchair Detective'', Spring 1997, republished on ''Mystery File'', accessed 17 Oct 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gradually the blacklist began to be weakened. With the support of [[Otto Preminger]], Trumbo was credited for his screenplay for the 1960 film ''[[Exodus (film)|Exodus]]'', adapted from the novel by [[Leon Uris]]. Shortly thereafter, [[Kirk Douglas]] made public Trumbo's credit for the screenplay for ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960),&lt;ref name=&quot;Trumbo&quot;&gt;{{imdb title|0889671|Trumbo (2007)}} Retrieved April 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; an event which has been cited as the beginning of the end of the blacklist. Trumbo was reinstated in the [[Writers Guild of America, West]], and was credited on all subsequent scripts.

In 1971, Trumbo directed the [[Johnny Got His Gun (film)|film adaptation of his novel]] ''[[Johnny Got His Gun]]'', which starred [[Timothy Bottoms]], [[Diane Varsi]] and [[Jason Robards]].

One of Trumbo's last films, ''[[Executive Action (film)|Executive Action]]'' (1973), was based on various [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories]] about the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy assassination]].

His account and analysis of the [[Smith Act]] trials is entitled ''The Devil in the Book''.

==Academy Awards==
He won an [[Academy award|Oscar]] for ''[[The Brave One (1956 film)|The Brave One]]'' (1956), written under the name Robert Rich. In 1975, the Academy officially recognized Trumbo as the winner and presented him with a statuette.

In 1993, Trumbo was posthumously awarded the [[Academy Award]] for writing ''[[Roman Holiday (1953 film)|Roman Holiday]]'' (1953). The screen credit and award were previously given to [[Ian McLellan Hunter]], who had been a &quot;front&quot; for Trumbo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2005/05.07.18.html &quot;Great To Be Nominated&quot; Enjoys a &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;] AMPAS&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
He died in [[Los Angeles]] of a [[heart attack]] at the age of 70 on September 10, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dalton Trumbo, Film Writer, Dies; Oscar Winner Had Been Blacklisted |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F7091EFE395C137B93C3A81782D85F428785F9 |quote=Dalton Trumbo, the Hollywood screen writer who was perhaps the most famous member of the blacklisted film industry authors called &quot;the Hollywood Ten,&quot; died of a heart attack early today at his home here.

'''Delaware''' ({{IPAc-en|en-us-Delaware.ogg|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|ə|w|ɛər}} {{respell|DEL|ə-wair}})&lt;ref&gt;''Random House Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[U.S. state]] located on the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] in the [[Mid Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] region of the [[United States]].  It is bordered to the south and west by [[Maryland]], to the east by [[New Jersey]] and to the north by [[Pennsylvania]].  &lt;ref name=&quot;WhichRegion&quot;&gt;While the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] designates Delaware as one of the [[South Atlantic States]], it is sometimes grouped with the [[Mid-Atlantic States]] or the [[Northeastern United States]].&lt;/ref&gt; The state takes its name from [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]], an English nobleman and [[Virginia]]'s first colonial governor, after whom what is now called [[Cape Henlopen]] was originally named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Delaware |title=Delaware |accessdate=2007-02-24 |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delaware is located in the northeastern portion of the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] and is the second smallest state in area (after [[Rhode Island]]). Estimates in 2007 rank the population of Delaware as 45th in the nation, but 6th in population density, with more than 60% of the population in [[New Castle County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Census&quot;&gt;[http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/voting/011400.html]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delaware is divided into three counties. From north to south, these three counties are New Castle, [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent]], and [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex]]. While the southern two counties have historically been predominantly agricultural, New Castle County has been more industrialized.

The state ranks second in civilian scientists and engineers as a percentage of the workforce and number of patents issued to companies or individuals per 1,000 workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neweconomyindex.org/states/2002/delaware.html |title=The State New Economy Index |year=2002 |publisher=The Progressive Policy Institute (PPI)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the state's economic and industrial development is closely tied to the impact of the [[Du Pont family]], founders and scions of [[DuPont|E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]], one of the world’s largest chemical companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delawareliving.com/history.html |title=Delaware Living History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before its coastline was first explored by Europeans in the 16th century, Delaware was inhabited by several groups of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], including the [[Lenape]] in the north and [[Nanticoke Indian Tribe|Nanticoke]] in the south. It was initially colonized by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] traders at [[Zwaanendael Colony|Zwaanendael]], located near the present town of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]], in 1631.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.delaware.gov/facts/history/delhist.shtml |title=State of Delaware (A brief history)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delaware was one of the 13 colonies participating in the [[American Revolution]] and on December 7, 1787, became the first state to ratify the [[Constitution of the United States]], thereby becoming known as ''The First State''.

==Geography==
{{main|Twelve-Mile Circle|Wedge (border)|Mason-Dixon line|Transpeninsular Line}}
{{See also|#Counties|l1=&quot;Counties&quot; section below}}
[[File:National-atlas-delaware.png|thumb|300px|right|Map of Delaware]]
[[File:Twelve-mile-circle.gif|thumb|220px|right|The Twelve-Mile Circle.]]
[[File:Delaware-wedge.svg|thumb|220px|right|Diagram of the Twelve-Mile Circle, the Mason-Dixon Line and &quot;[[The Wedge (border)|The Wedge]]&quot;. All blue and white areas are inside Delaware.]]
Delaware is {{convert|96|mi|km}} long and ranges from {{convert|9|mi}} to {{convert|35|mi|km}} across, totaling {{convert|1954|sqmi|km2}}, making it the second-smallest state in the United States after [[Rhode Island]]. Delaware is bounded to the north by [[Pennsylvania]]; to the east by the [[Delaware River]], [[Delaware Bay]], [[New Jersey]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; and to the west and south by [[Maryland]]. Small portions of Delaware are also situated on the eastern side of the Delaware River sharing land boundaries with New Jersey. The state of Delaware, together with the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] counties of Maryland and two counties of [[Virginia]], form the Delmarva Peninsula, which stretches down the Mid-Atlantic Coast.

The definition of the northern boundary of the state is unusual. Most of the boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania was originally defined by an arc extending {{convert|12|mi|km|sigfig=3}} from the [[cupola]] of the courthouse in the city of [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]]. This boundary is often referred to as the [[Twelve-Mile Circle]].&lt;ref&gt;Because of surveying errors, the actual line is actually several compound arcs with centers located at different points in town New Castle&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only nominally circular state boundary in the United States.

This border extends all the way east to the low-tide mark on the New Jersey shore, then continues south along the shoreline until it again reaches the 12-mile (19&amp;nbsp;km) arc in the south; then the boundary continues in a more conventional way in the middle of the main channel ([[thalweg]]) of the Delaware River. To the west, a portion of the arc extends past the easternmost edge of Maryland. The remaining western border runs slightly east of due south from its intersection with the arc. [[The Wedge (border)|The Wedge]] of land between the northwest part of the arc and the Maryland border was claimed by both Delaware and Pennsylvania until 1921, when Delaware's claim was confirmed.

====Topography====
Delaware is on a level plain, with the lowest mean elevation of any state in the nation.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/04statab/geo.pdf|format= PDF|page= 216|title= Extreme and Mean Elevations by State and Other Area|work=Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2004-2005|publisher= Unites States Census Bureau|accessdate= March 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its highest elevation, located at [[Ebright Azimuth]], near [[Concord High School (Wilmington, Delaware)|Concord High School]], does not rise fully {{convert|450|ft}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt; The northernmost part of the state is part of the Appalachian Piedmont with hills and rolling surfaces. The [[fall line]] approximately follows the [[Delaware Route 2|Robert Kirkwood Highway]] between [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]]; south of this road is the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]] with flat, sandy, and, in some parts, swampy ground. A ridge about {{convert|75|to|80|ft}} in elevation extends along the western boundary of the state and separates between the [[drainage basin|watershed]]s that feed Delaware River and Bay to the east and the [[Chesapeake Bay]] to the west.

====Climate====
Since almost all of Delaware is a part of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, the effects of the ocean moderate its climate. The state is in a transitional zone between a [[humid subtropical climate]] and a [[continental climate]]. Despite its small size (roughly {{convert|100|mi|km}} from its northernmost to southernmost points), there is significant variation in mean temperature and amount of snowfall between [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]] and [[New Castle County]]. The southern portion of the state has a somewhat milder climate and a longer growing season than the northern portion of the state. Delaware's all time record high of {{convert|110|F|C}} was recorded at [[Millsboro, Delaware|Millsboro]] on July 21, 1930; the all time record low of {{convert|-17|F|C}} was also recorded at Millsboro on January 17, 1893.

===Environment===
{{see also|#Environmental management}}
The transitional climate of Delaware supports a wide variety of [[vegetation]]. 

In the northern third of the state are found [[Northeastern coastal forests]], mixed [[Quercus|oak]] forests typical of the northeastern United States.&lt;ref name = &quot;ecoregions&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author = Olson, D.

==History==
{{Main|History of Delaware}}

===Native Americans===
Before Delaware was settled by European colonists, the area was home to the Eastern [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes known as the [[Unami]] [[Lenape]] or Delaware throughout the Delaware valley, and the [[Nanticoke River|Nanticoke]] along the rivers leading into the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The Unami Lenape in the Delaware Valley were closely related to [[Munsee]] Lenape tribes along the [[Hudson River]]. They had a settled hunting and agricultural society, and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy, the Minqua or [[Susquehannock]]. With the loss of their lands on the Delaware River and the destruction of the Minqua by the [[Iroquois]] of the Five Nations in the 1670s, the remnants of the Lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the [[Alleghany Mountains]] by the mid-18th century. Generally, those who did not relocate out of the State of Delaware were baptized, became Christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their non-Native American neighbors.

===Colonial Delaware===
The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to settle in present-day Delaware in the Middle region by establishing a trading post at [[Zwaanendael, Delaware|Zwaanendael]], near the site of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]] in 1631. Within a year all the settlers were killed in a dispute with [[Native Americans in the United States|area Indian tribes]]. In 1638 [[New Sweden]], a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] trading post and colony, was established at [[Fort Christina]] (now in [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]]) by [[Peter Minuit]] at the head of a group of Swedes, [[Finnish people|Finns]] and Dutch. The colony of New Sweden lasted for 17 years. In 1651, the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leadership of [[Peter Stuyvesant]], established a fort at present-day [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]], and in 1655 they conquered the New Sweden colony, annexing it into the Dutch [[New Netherland]].&lt;ref name=hod&gt;{{Cite book

The Lower Counties On The Delaware]}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Only nine years later, in 1664, the Dutch were conquered by a fleet of [[English people|English]] ships by Sir Robert Carr under the direction of [[James II of England|James, the Duke of York]]. Fighting off a prior claim by [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]], Proprietor of [[Maryland]], the Duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to [[William Penn]] in 1682. Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his [[Pennsylvania]] province and leased what then came to be known as the &quot;Lower Counties on the Delaware&quot; &lt;ref name=hod/&gt; from the Duke.

Penn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one General Assembly in 1682. However, by 1704 the Province of Pennsylvania had grown so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the Lower Counties and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own, one at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], and the other at New Castle. Penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person Governor for their Province of Pennsylvania and their territory of the Lower Counties. The fact that Delaware and Pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique. From 1703-1738, New York and New Jersey shared a governor.&lt;ref&gt;Lurie MN, Mappen M. Encyclopedia of New Jersey. Rutgers University Press, 2004, ISBN 0813533252, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massachusetts]] and [[New Hampshire]] also shared a governor for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo LS. John Wentworth, Governor of New Hampshire: 1767-1775. Harvard University Press, 1921,  p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Dependent in early years on indentured labor, Delaware imported more slaves as the number of English immigrants decreased with better economic conditions in England. The colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop, although English immigrants continued to arrive.

===American Revolution===
Like the other middle colonies, the Lower Counties on the Delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]. The citizenry had a good relationship with the Proprietary government, and generally were allowed more independence of action in their Colonial Assembly than in other colonies. Merchants at the port of Wilmington had trading ties with the British.

So it was that New Castle lawyer [[Thomas McKean]] denounced the [[Stamp Act]] in the strongest terms, and Kent County native [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] became the &quot;Penman of the Revolution.&quot; Anticipating the Declaration of Independence, [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] leaders Thomas McKean and [[Caesar Rodney]] convinced the Colonial Assembly to declare itself separated from British and Pennsylvania rule on June 15, 1776. The person best representing Delaware's majority, [[George Read (signer)|George Read]], could not bring himself to vote for a Declaration of Independence. Only the dramatic overnight ride of Caesar Rodney gave the delegation the votes needed to cast Delaware's vote for independence.

Initially led by [[John Haslet]], Delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the [[Continental Army]], known as the &quot;Delaware Blues&quot; and nicknamed the &quot;[[Blue Hen Chicken]]s.&quot; In August 1777, [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|General Sir William Howe]] led a British army through Delaware on his way to a victory at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] and capture of the city of Philadelphia. The only real engagement on Delaware soil was the [[Battle of Cooch's Bridge]], fought on September 3, 1777, at [[Cooch's Bridge]] in New Castle County.

Following the Battle of Brandywine, Wilmington was occupied by the British, and [[Governor of Delaware|State President]] [[John McKinly]] was taken prisoner. The British remained in control of the Delaware River for much of the rest of the war, disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] portion of the population, particularly in Sussex County. Because the British promised slaves of rebels freedom for fighting with them, escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Schama, ''Rough Crossings: Britain, The Slaves, and the American Revolution'', New York, HarperCollins, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[American Revolution]], statesmen from Delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central United States with equal representation for each state.

===Slavery and race===
Many colonial settlers came to Delaware from Maryland and Virginia, which had been experiencing a population boom. The economies of these colonies were chiefly based on tobacco culture and were increasingly dependent on slave labor for its intensive cultivation. Most of the English colonists arrived as [[indentured servant]]s, hiring themselves out as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage. In the early years the line between indentured servants and African [[slave]]s or laborers was fluid. Most of the free African-American families in Delaware before the Revolution had migrated from Maryland to find more affordable land. They were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between servant women and enslaved, servant or free African or African-American men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ Paul Heinegg. Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware] Accessed 15 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in England, more slaves were imported for labor.

At the end of the colonial period, the number of enslaved people in Delaware began to decline. Shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming created less need for slaves' labor. Local [[Methodist]]s and [[Quaker]]s encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the American Revolution, and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons. By 1810 three-quarters of all blacks in Delaware were free. When John Dickinson freed his slaves in 1777, he was Delaware's largest slave owner with 37 slaves. By 1860 the largest slaveholder owned only 16 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, pp.78, 81-82&lt;/ref&gt;

Although attempts to abolish slavery failed by narrow margins in the legislature, in practical terms, the state had mostly ended the practice. By the [[United States Census, 1860|1860 census]] on the verge of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], 91.7 percent of the black population, or nearly 20,000 people, were free.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, pp.81-82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/ Historical Census Browser, 1860 Federal Census, University of Virginia Library]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}, accessed 15 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The independent black denomination was chartered by freed slave [[Peter Spencer]] in 1813 as the &quot;[[Spencer Churches|Union Church of Africans]]&quot;. This followed the 1793 establishment of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia, which had ties to the Methodist Episcopal Church until 1816. Spencer built a church in Wilmington for the new denomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.udel.edu/BlackHistory/antebellum.html| first = Peter T.| last = Dalleo| title = The Growth of Delaware's Antebellum Free African Community| publisher = University of Delaware| date = 1997-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was renamed the [[African Union First Colored Methodist Protestant Church and Connection]], more commonly known as the [[A.U.M.P. Church]]. Begun by Spencer in 1814, the annual gathering of the [[Big August Quarterly]] still draws people together in a religious and cultural festival, the oldest such cultural festival in the nation.

At the onset of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Delaware was only nominally a slave state, and it remained in the Union. Delaware voted against secession on January 3, 1861. As the governor said, Delaware had been the first state to embrace the Union by ratifying the Constitution and would be the last to leave it. While most Delaware citizens who fought in the war served in the regiments of the state, some served in companies on the Confederate side in Maryland and Virginia Regiments. Delaware is notable for being the only slave state from which no Confederate regiments or militia groups were assembled. It freed the remaining 1,000 or so Delaware slaves with the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment to the US Constitution]] in December 1865.

DE Rt. 9 is a north-south highway connecting Dover and Wilmington via a scenic route along the [[Delaware Bay]]. U.S. 40, is a primary east-west route, connecting Maryland with New Jersey.

The state also operates two toll highways, the [[Delaware Turnpike]], which is Interstate 95, between Maryland and New Castle and the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, which is DE Rt. 1, between Wilmington and Dover.

A bicycle route, [[Delaware Bicycle Route 1]], spans the north-south length of the state from the Maryland border in [[Fenwick Island, Delaware|Fenwick Island]] to the Pennsylvania border north of [[Montchanin, Delaware|Montchanin]]. It is the first of several signed bike routes planned in Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deldot.gov/information/projects/bike_and_ped/bike_facilities/pages/regional_routes.shtml |publisher=Delaware Department of Transportation|title= Projects: Delaware Bicycle Facility Master Plan |accessdate=2010-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delaware has around 1,450 bridges, ninety-five percent of which are under the supervision of DelDOT. About 30 percent of all Delaware bridges were built prior to 1950 and about 60 percent of the number are included in the [[National Bridge Inventory]]. Some bridges not under DelDOT supervision includes the four bridges on the [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]], which are under the jurisdiction of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], and the [[Delaware Memorial Bridge]], which is under the bi-state [[Delaware River and Bay Authority]].

It has been noted that the [[tar and chip]] composition of secondary roads in Sussex County make them more prone to [[Road surface#Surface deterioration|deterioration]] than [[Asphalt concrete|asphalt]] roadways found in the rest of the state.&lt;ref name=nj20110417&gt;{{cite news |location=Wilmington, Delaware

===Ferries===
There are three ferries that operate in the state of Delaware:
*[[Cape May-Lewes Ferry]] crosses the mouth of the Delaware Bay between Lewes, Delaware and [[Cape May, New Jersey]].
*[[Woodland Ferry]] is a cable ferry that crosses the [[Nanticoke River]] southwest of [[Seaford, Delaware|Seaford]].
*[[Three Forts Ferry Crossing]] connects [[Delaware City]] with [[Fort Delaware]] and [[Fort Mott (New Jersey)|Fort Mott]] in [[New Jersey]]

===Rail and bus===
[[File:NS5333 DoverDE.JPG|150px|thumb|left|A [[Norfolk Southern]] locomotive in [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]].]][[Amtrak]] has two stations in Delaware along the [[Northeast Corridor]]; the relatively quiet [[Newark Rail Station (Delaware)|Newark Rail Station]] in Newark, and the busier [[Wilmington Rail Station]] in Wilmington. The Northeast Corridor is also served by [[SEPTA]]'s [[Wilmington/Newark Line]] of [[SEPTA Regional Rail|Regional Rail]], which serves [[Claymont, Delaware|Claymont]], Wilmington, [[Churchmans Crossing, Delaware|Churchmans Crossing]], and Newark. The major freight railroad in Delaware is the Class 1 [[Norfolk Southern]], which provides service to most of Delaware. It connects with two shortline railroads, the [[Delaware Coast Line Railway]] and the [[Maryland &amp; Delaware Railroad]]. These two shortlines serve local customers in Sussex County. Another Class 1 railroad, [[CSX]], passes through northern New Castle County parallel to the Amtrak Northeast Corridor.

The public transportation system, [[DART First State]], was named &quot;Most Outstanding Public Transportation System&quot; in 2003 by the [[American Public Transportation Association]]. Coverage of the system is broad within northern New Castle County with close association to major highways in Kent and Sussex counties. The system includes bus, subsidized passenger rail operated by Philadelphia transit agency SEPTA, and subsidized taxi and paratransit modes, the latter consisting of a state-wide door-to-door bus service for the elderly and disabled.

===Air===
Delaware is the only state in the United States without commercial air service. [[New Castle Airport]] near Wilmington has been served by commercial airlines in the past, the last being [[Skybus Airlines]], which provided service to [[Columbus, Ohio]] and [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] from March 7, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; until its bankruptcy on April 5, 2008.

Delaware is centrally situated in the [[Northeast Corridor]] region of cities along [[Interstate 95|I-95]]. Therefore, Delaware [[commercial airline]] passengers most frequently use [[Philadelphia International Airport]] (PHL) and [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport]] (BWI) for domestic and international transit. Residents of Sussex County will also use [[Wicomico Regional Airport]], as it is located less than {{convert|10|mi|km}} from the Delaware border. [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] (EWR) and [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] (DCA) are also within a {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} radius of New Castle County.

The large [[Dover Air Force Base]] of the [[USAF]] [[Air Mobility Command]] is located in the central part of the state, and it is the home of the [[436th Airlift Wing]] and the [[512th Airlift Wing]].

Other general aviation airports in Delaware include [[Summit Airport (Delaware)|Summit Airport]] near [[Middletown, Delaware|Middletown]], [[Delaware Airpark]] near [[Cheswold, Delaware|Cheswold]], and [[Sussex County Airport]] near [[Georgetown, Delaware|Georgetown]].

==Law and government==
Delaware's fourth and current constitution, adopted in 1897, provides for executive, judicial and legislative branches.

===Legislative branch===
[[File:Delaware State Capitol.jpg|300px|right|thumb|The [[Delaware General Assembly]] meet in the [[Delaware State Capitol|Legislative Hall]] in [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]].]]
The [[Delaware General Assembly]] consists of a [[Delaware House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] with 41 members and a [[Delaware Senate|Senate]] with 21 members. It sits in Dover, the state capital. Representatives are elected to two-year terms, while senators are elected to four-year terms. The Senate confirms judicial and other nominees appointed by the governor.

Delaware's U.S. Senators are [[Thomas R. Carper]] (Democrat) and [[Chris Coons]] (Democrat). Delaware's single U.S. Representative is [[John C. Carney, Jr.|John Carney]] (Democrat).

===Judicial branch===
The Delaware Constitution establishes a number of courts:
*The [[Delaware Supreme Court]] is the state's highest court.
*The [[Delaware Superior Court]] is the state's trial court of general jurisdiction.
*The [[Delaware Court of Chancery]] deals primarily in corporate disputes.
*The Family Court handles domestic and custody matters.
*The [[Delaware Court of Common Pleas]] has jurisdiction over a limited class of civil and criminal matters.

Minor non-constitutional courts include the [[Justice of the Peace]] Courts and Aldermen's Courts.

Significantly, Delaware has one of the few remaining Courts of [[Court of equity|Chancery]] in the nation, which has jurisdiction over [[Equity (law)|equity]] cases, the vast majority of which are corporate disputes, many relating to [[mergers and acquisitions]]. The [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]] and the Supreme Court have developed a worldwide reputation for rendering concise opinions concerning [[corporate law]] which generally (but not always) grant broad discretion to corporate boards of directors and officers. In addition, the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]], which forms the basis of the Courts' opinions, is widely regarded as giving great flexibility to corporations to manage their affairs. For these reasons, Delaware is considered to have the most business-friendly legal system in the United States; therefore a great number of companies are [[incorporated in Delaware]], including 60% of the companies listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name=&quot;divcorpabout&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.state.de.us/corp/aboutagency.shtml |title=Division of Corporations - About Agency| accessdate = 2007-03-09 |publisher=Delaware Division of Corporations| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070228002805/http://www.state.de.us/corp/aboutagency.shtml |archivedate=2007-02-28

===Executive branch===
{{See also|List of Governors of Delaware}}
The executive branch is headed by the [[Governor of Delaware]]. The present governor is [[Jack A. Markell]] (Democrat), who took office January 20, 2009. The lieutenant governor is [[Matthew P. Denn]]. The governor presents a &quot;[[State of the State]]&quot; speech to a [[joint session]] of the Delaware legislature annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Counties===
Delaware is subdivided into [[List of counties in Delaware|three counties]]; from north to south they are [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]], [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]] and [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex]]. This is the fewest among all states, with [[Rhode Island]] having [[List of counties in Rhode Island|five counties]]. Each county elects its own legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as '''County Council''', and in Kent County as '''Levy Court'''), which deal primarily in zoning and development issues. Most functions which are handled on a county-by-county basis in other states — such as court and law enforcement — have been centralized in Delaware, leading to a significant concentration of power in the Delaware state government. The counties were historically divided into [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundreds]], which were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s, but now serve no administrative role, their only current official legal use being in real-estate title descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.delaware.gov/museums/vc/vc_hundreds.shtml |title=The Hundreds Of Delaware |work=Department of State:  Division of Historical and Cultural Affairs |publisher= Delaware State Archives|accessdate=2010-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democratic Party holds a [[pluralism (political theory)|plurality]] of registrations in Delaware. Until the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], the state tended to be a Presidential [[bellwether]], sending its three [[electoral votes]] to the winning candidate since 1952. Bucking that trend, however, in 2000 and again in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]], Delaware voted for the Democratic candidate. In the 2000 election Delaware voted with the winner of the popular vote, [[Al Gore]], who subsequently lost the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] to [[George W. Bush]]. [[John Kerry]] won Delaware by eight percentage points with 53.5% of the vote in 2004. In 2008, Democrat [[Barack Obama]] defeated Republican [[John McCain]] in Delaware 62.63% to 37.37%. Obama's running mate was [[Joe Biden]], who had represented Delaware in the [[United States Senate]] since 1973.

For a period of time the Republican Party was the dominant political party in the state due in part to the influence of the [[du Pont family]]. [[Ralph Nader]] assembled a [[working group]] to investigate ties between Delaware's politicians and industrialists and published its findings in the book ''The Company State''.

The nominees of the Democratic Party have won the past four gubernatorial elections. Democrats presently hold eight of the nine statewide elected offices, while the Republicans hold only one statewide office, [[State Auditor]].

===Freedom of information===
{{see also|Freedom of information in the United States#State legislation}}
Each of the 50 states of the United States has passed some form of freedom of information legislation, which provides a mechanism for the general public to request information of the government.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}  In 2011, Delaware passed legislation placing a 15 business day time limit on addressing freedom-of-information requests, to either produce information or an explanation of why such information would take longer then this time to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Government revenue===
Delaware has six different [[income tax]] brackets, ranging from 2.2% to 5.95%. The state does not assess [[sales tax]] on consumers. The state does, however, impose a tax on the gross receipts of most businesses. Business and occupational license tax rates range from 0.096% to 1.92%, depending on the category of business activity.

Delaware does not assess a state-level tax on real or personal property. [[Real estate]] is subject to county [[property tax]]es, school district property taxes, vocational school district taxes, and, if located within an incorporated area, municipal property taxes.

[[Gambling in the United States#Authorized types|Gambling]] provides significant revenue to the state.  For instance, the [[Delaware Park Racetrack#Casino|casino at Delaware Park Racetrack]] provided more than $100 million USD to the state in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Education==
Delaware was the origin of ''[[Belton v. Gebhart]]'', one of the four cases which was combined into ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decision that led to the end of [[racial segregation|segregated]] public schools. Significantly, ''Belton'' was the only case in which the state court found '''for''' the plaintiffs, thereby ruling that segregation was unconstitutional.

Unlike many states, Delaware's educational system is centralized in a state Superintendent of Education, with local school boards retaining control over taxation and some curriculum decisions.

====Discipline====
A study in 2010 indicated that while black students made up 32% of public school attendees, they accounted for 55% of the students who were suspended or expelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Nichole | last=Dobo | title=Black students punished more | url=| work= | publisher=Florida Today | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 13A | date=17 October 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--wouold best fit in an &quot;Education in Delaware&quot; article which did not exist when I put this here.

There are no network broadcast-television stations operating solely in Delaware. A local [[PBS]] station from Philadelphia (but licensed to Wilmington), [[WHYY-TV]], maintains a studio and broadcasting facility in Wilmington and Dover, while [[ION Television]] affiliate [[WPPX]] is licensed to Wilmington, but for all intents and purposes, maintains their offices in Philadelphia and their digital transmitter outside of that city and an analog tower in New Jersey. Philadelphia's [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate, [[WPVI-TV]], maintains a news bureau in downtown Wilmington. The northern part of the state is served by network stations in Philadelphia and the southern part by network stations in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] and [[Salisbury, Maryland]]. Salisbury's [[CBS]] affiliate, [[WBOC-TV]], maintains bureaus in Dover and Milton.

Rehoboth Beach often bills itself as &quot;The Nation's Summer Capital&quot; because it is a frequent summer vacation destination for Washington, D.C., residents as well as visitors from Maryland, Virginia, and in lesser numbers, Pennsylvania. Vacationers are drawn for many reasons, including the town's charm, artistic appeal, nightlife, and tax free shopping.

Delaware is home to several festivals, fairs, and events. Some of the more notable festivals are the Riverfest held in [[Seaford, Delaware|Seaford]], the World Championship Punkin Chunkin held at various locations throughout the county since 1986, the Rehoboth Beach Chocolate Festival, the Bethany Beach Jazz Funeral to mark the end of summer, the Apple Scrapple Festival held in [[Bridgeville, Delaware|Bridgeville]], the Rehoboth Beach Jazz Festival, the Sea Witch Halloween Festival and Parade in Rehoboth Beach, the Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival, the Nanticoke Indian Pow Wow in [[Oak Orchard, Delaware|Oak Orchard]], and the Return Day Parade held after every election in [[Georgetown, Delaware|Georgetown]].

In place of in-state professional sports teams, many Delawareans follow either Philadelphia or Baltimore teams, depending on their location within the state, with Philadelphia teams receiving the largest fan following, though before the [[Baltimore Ravens]] entered the NFL, the [[Washington Redskins]] had a significant fan base in Sussex County and the Baltimore Colts had a significant fan base in northern counties. The [[Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football|University of Delaware's football team]] has a large following throughout the state with the [[Delaware State Hornets football|Delaware State University]] and [[Wesley College (Delaware)Wesley College]] teams also enjoying a smaller degree of support.

Delaware is home to [[Dover International Speedway]] and [[Dover Downs]]. DIS, also known as the ''Monster Mile'', hosts two [[NASCAR]] races each year. Dover Downs is a popular [[harness racing]] facility. It is the only co-located horse and car-racing facility in the nation, with the Dover Downs track is located inside the DIS track.

Delaware has been home to [[professional wrestling]] outfit [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW). CZW has been affiliated with the annual Tournament of Death and [[East Coast Wrestling Association|ECWA]] with its annual [[ECWA Super 8 Tournament|Super 8 Tournament]].

Delaware is home to the Diamond State Games, an amateur Olympic-style sports festival. The event is open to athletes of all ages and is also open to residents beyond the borders of Delaware. The Diamond State Games were created in 2001 and participation levels average roughly 2500 per year in 12 contested sports.

===Delaware Native Americans===
'''Delaware''' is also the name of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] group (called in their own language [[Lenni Lenape]]) that was influential in the colonial period of the United States and is today headquartered in Cheswold, Kent County, Delaware. A band of the Nanticoke tribe of American Indians today resides in Sussex County and is headquartered in Millsboro, Sussex County, Delaware.

===Environmental management===
Delaware provides [[government subsidy]] support for the [[Environmental remediation|clean-up]] of property &quot;lightly contaminated&quot; by [[hazardous waste]], the proceeds for which come from a tax on wholesale petroleum sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cleaning up contamination |first=Jeff

[[File:Latin dictionary.jpg|thumb|250px|A multi-volume Latin dictionary by [[Egidio Forcellini]].]]
A '''dictionary''', also referred to as a '''lexicon''', '''wordbook''', or '''vocabulary''', is a collection of [[words]] in one or more specific languages, often listed [[Alphabetical order|alphabetically]], with usage information, [[definitions]], etymologies, phonetics, pronunciations, and other information;&lt;ref name = Web1&gt;Webster's New World College Dictionary, Fourth Edition, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; or a book of words in one language with their equivalents in another, also known as a [[lexicon]].&lt;ref name = Web1/&gt; According to [[Sandro Nielsen|Nielsen]] (2008) a dictionary may be regarded as a [[Lexicography|lexicographical]] product that is characterised by three significant features: (1) it has been prepared for one or more functions; (2) it contains data that have been selected for the purpose of fulfilling those functions; and (3) its lexicographic structures link and establish relationships between the data so that they can meet the needs of users and fulfill the functions of the dictionary.

A broad distinction is made between general and [[specialized dictionaries]]. Specialized dictionaries do not contain information about words that are used in language for general purposes&amp;mdash;words used by ordinary people in everyday situations. Lexical items that describe concepts in specific fields are usually called [[term]]s instead of [[word]]s, although there is no consensus whether [[lexicology]] and [[terminology]] are two different fields of study. In theory, general dictionaries are supposed to be [[semasiological]], mapping word to [[meaning]], while specialized dictionaries are supposed to be [[onomasiological]], first identifying [[concept]]s and then establishing the terms used to designate them. In practice, the two approaches are used for both types.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sterkenburg2003&quot;&gt;Sterkenburg 2003, pp. 155-157&lt;/ref&gt; There are other types of dictionaries that don't fit neatly in the above distinction, for instance [[bilingual dictionary|bilingual (translation) dictionaries]], dictionaries of [[synonyms]] ([[thesaurus|thesauri]]), or [[rhyming]] dictionaries. The word dictionary (unqualified) is usually understood to refer to a monolingual general-purpose dictionary.&lt;ref name=Sintro&gt;Sterkenburg 2003, pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

A different dimension on which dictionaries (usually just general-purpose ones) are sometimes distinguished is whether they are [[Prescription and description|''prescriptive'' or ''descriptive'']], the latter being in theory largely based on [[linguistic corpus]] studies&amp;mdash;this is the case of most modern dictionaries. However, this distinction cannot be upheld in the strictest sense. The choice of [[headword]]s is considered itself of prescriptive nature; for instance, dictionaries avoid having too many taboo words in that position. Stylistic indications (e.g. ‘informal’ or ‘vulgar’) present in many modern dictionaries is considered less than objectively descriptive as well.&lt;ref&gt;Sterkenburg 2003, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the first recorded dictionaries date back to Sumerian times (these were bilingual dictionaries), the systematic study of dictionaries as objects of scientific interest themselves is a 20th century enterprise, called [[lexicography]], and largely initiated by [[Ladislav Zgusta]].&lt;ref name=Sintro/&gt; The birth of the new discipline was not without controversy, the practical dictionary-makers being sometimes accused of &quot;astonishing&quot; lack of method and critical-self reflection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartmann2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=R. R. K. Hartmann|title=Lexicography: Dictionaries, compilers, critics, and users|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hLlhyvpg7KoC&amp;pg=PA21|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415253666|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The oldest known dictionaries were [[Akkadian empire]] cuneiform tablets with bilingual [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]&amp;ndash;[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] wordlists, discovered in [[Ebla]] (modern [[Syria]]) and dated roughly 2300 [[Common Era|BCE]].&lt;ref name = &quot;imlqdg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary - MSN Encarta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573731/Dictionary.html#p3|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwbLyr75|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early 2nd millennium BCE ''[[Urra=hubullu]]'' glossary is the canonical [[Babylonian]] version of such bilingual Sumerian wordlists. A [[Chinese dictionary]], the ca. 3rd century BCE ''[[Erya]]'', was the earliest surviving monolingual dictionary, although some sources cite the ca. 800 BCE [[Shizhoupian]] as a &quot;dictionary&quot;, modern scholarship considers it a calligraphic compendium of [[Chinese character]]s from [[Zhou dynasty]] bronzes. [[Philitas of Cos]] (fl. 4th century BCE) wrote a pioneering vocabulary ''Disorderly Words'' (Ἄτακτοι γλῶσσαι, ''{{transl|el|ISO|Átaktoi glôssai}}'') which explained the meanings of rare [[Homer]]ic and other literary words, words from local dialects, and technical terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Peter Bing |title= The unruly tongue: Philitas of Cos as scholar and poet |journal= Classical Philology |volume=98 |issue=4 |year=2003 |pages=330–48 |doi=10.1086/422370}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apollonius the Sophist]] (fl. 1st century CE) wrote the oldest surviving Homeric lexicon.&lt;ref name = &quot;imlqdg&quot;/&gt; The first [[Sanskrit]] dictionary, the Amarakośa, was written by [[Amara Sinha]] ca. 4th century CE. Written in verse, it listed around 10,000 words. According to the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', the first [[Japanese dictionaries#Early Japanese lexicography|Japanese dictionary]] was the long-lost 682 CE ''Niina'' glossary of Chinese characters. The oldest existing Japanese dictionary, the ca. 835 CE ''[[Tenrei Banshō Meigi]]'', was also a glossary of written Chinese. 

[[Arabic]] dictionaries were compiled between the 8th and 14th centuries CE, organizing words in rhyme order (by the last syllable), by alphabetical order of the [[root (linguistics)|radicals]], or according to the alphabetical order of the first letter (the system used in modern European language dictionaries). The modern system was mainly used in specialist dictionaries, such as those of terms from the [[Qur'an]] and [[hadith]], while most general use dictionaries, such as the ''Lisan al-`Arab'' (13th c., still the best-known large-scale dictionary of Arabic) and ''al-Qamus al-Muhit'' (14th c.) listed words in the alphabetical order of the radicals. The ''Qamus al-Muhit'' is the first handy dictionary in Arabic, which includes only words and their definitions, eliminating the supporting examples used in such dictionaries as the ''Lisan'' and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ḳāmūs&quot;, J. Eckmann, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', 2nd ed., Brill&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest modern European dictionaries were bilingual dictionaries. The earliest in the English language were glossaries of French, Italian or Latin words along with definitions of the foreign words in English. An early non-alphabetical list of 8000 English words was the ''Elementarie'' created by [[Richard Mulcaster]] in 1592.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/dic/mul/elementarie.html 1582 - Mulcaster's Elementarie], Learning Dictionaries and Meaning, [[The British Library]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://angli02.kgw.tu-berlin.de/lexicography/b_history.html A Brief History of English Lexicography], Peter Erdmann and See-Young Cho, [[Technical University of Berlin|Technische Universität Berlin]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The first purely English alphabetical dictionary was ''[[Table Alphabeticall|A Table Alphabeticall]]'', written by English schoolteacher [[Robert Cawdrey]] in 1604. The only surviving copy is found at the [[Bodleian Library]] in [[Oxford]]. Yet this early effort, as well as the many imitators which followed it, was seen as unreliable and nowhere near definitive. [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield]] was still lamenting in 1754, 150 years after Cawdrey's publication, that it is &quot;a sort of disgrace to our nation, that hitherto we have had no… standard of our language; our dictionaries at present being more properly what our neighbors the Dutch and the Germans call theirs, word-books, than dictionaries in the superior sense of that title.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Papers/firstdict.html Jack Lynch, “How Johnson's Dictionary Became the First Dictionary” (delivered 25 August 2005 at the Johnson and the English Language conference, Birmingham)] Retrieved July 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1755) that a truly noteworthy, reliable English Dictionary was deemed to have been produced, and the fact that today many people still mistakenly believe Johnson to have written the first English Dictionary is a testimony to this legacy.&lt;ref name = &quot;wblqfm&quot;&gt;[http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Papers/firstdict.html Lynch, &quot;How Johnson's Dictionary Became the First Dictionary&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; By this stage, dictionaries had evolved to contain textual references for most words, and were arranged alphabetically, rather than by topic (a previously popular form of arrangement, which meant all animals would be grouped together, etc.). Johnson's masterwork could be judged as the first to bring all these elements together, creating the first 'modern' dictionary.&lt;ref name = &quot;wblqfm&quot;/&gt;

Johnson's ''Dictionary'' remained the English-language standard for over 150 years, until the [[Oxford University Press]] began writing and releasing the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in short [[Fascicle (book)|fascicles]] from 1884 onwards. It took nearly 50 years to finally complete the huge work, and they finally released the complete ''OED'' in twelve volumes in 1928. It remains the most comprehensive and trusted English language dictionary to this day, with revisions and updates added by a dedicated team every three months. One of the main contributors to this modern day dictionary was an ex-army surgeon, [[William Chester Minor]], a convicted murderer who was confined to an asylum for the criminally insane.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Winchester]], ''[[The Surgeon of Crowthorne]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noah Webster===
In 1806, American [[Noah Webster]] published his first dictionary, [[s:A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language|''A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language'']]. In 1807 Webster began compiling an expanded and fully comprehensive dictionary, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language;'' it took twenty-seven years to complete. To evaluate the etymology of words, Webster learned twenty-six languages, including [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon), German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Arabic, and [[Sanskrit]]. Webster hoped to standardize American speech, since Americans in different parts of the country used different languages. They also spelled, pronounced, and used English words differently. 

Webster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in 1825 in Paris, France, and at the [[University of Cambridge]]. His book contained seventy thousand words, of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before.  As a [[spelling reform]]er, Webster believed that English spelling rules were unnecessarily complex, so his dictionary introduced [[American English]] spellings, replacing &quot;colour&quot; with &quot;color&quot;, substituting &quot;wagon&quot; for &quot;waggon&quot;, and printing &quot;center&quot; instead of &quot;centre&quot;.  He also added American words, like &quot;skunk&quot; and &quot;squash&quot;, that did not appear in British dictionaries.  At the age of seventy, Webster published his dictionary in 1828; it sold 2500 copies. In 1840, the second edition was published in two volumes. 

Austin (2005) explores the intersection of lexicographical and poetic practices in American literature, and attempts to map out a &quot;lexical poetics&quot; using Webster's definitions as his base. He explores how American poets used Webster's dictionaries, often drawing upon his lexicography in order to express their word play. Austin explicates key definitions from both the ''Compendious'' (1806) and ''American'' (1828) dictionaries, and brings into its discourse a range of concerns, including the politics of American English, the question of national identity and culture in the early moments of American independence, and the poetics of citation and of definition. Austin concludes that Webster's dictionaries helped redefine Americanism in an era of an emergent and unstable American political and cultural identity. Webster himself saw the dictionaries as a nationalizing device to separate America from  Britain, calling his his project a &quot;federal language&quot;, with competing forces towards regularity on the one hand and innovation on the other. Austin suggests that the contradictions of Webster's lexicography were part of a larger play between liberty and order within American intellectual discourse, with some pulled toward Europe and the past, and others pulled toward America and the new future.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan W. Austin, &quot;Lost in the Maze of Words: Reading and Re-reading Noah Webster's Dictionaries&quot;, ''Dissertation Abstracts International'', 2005, Vol. 65 Issue 12, p. 4561&lt;/ref&gt;

For an international appreciation of the importance of Webster's dictionaries in setting the norms of the English language, see Forque (1982).&lt;ref&gt;Guy Jean Forgue, &quot;The Norm in American English,&quot; ''Revue Francaise d'Etudes Americaines,'' Nov 1983, Vol. 8 Issue 18, pp 451-461&lt;/ref&gt;

== General dictionaries ==
In a general dictionary, each word may have multiple meanings.  Some dictionaries include each separate meaning in the order of most common usage while others list definitions in historical order, with the oldest usage first.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ld/pubs/corereference/internal/chd.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In many languages, words can appear in many different forms, but only the [[lemma (linguistics)|undeclined or unconjugated]] form appears as the [[headword]] in most dictionaries. Dictionaries are most commonly found in the form of a book, but some newer dictionaries, like [[StarDict]] and the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' are dictionary software running on [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDAs]] or  [[computer]]s. There are also many online dictionaries accessible via the [[Internet]]. 


==Specialized dictionaries==
According to the ''Manual of Specialized Lexicographies'' a [[specialized dictionary]] (also referred to as a technical dictionary) is a lexicon that focuses upon a specific subject field. Following the description in ''The Bilingual LSP Dictionary'' [[lexicographers]] categorize specialized dictionaries into three types. A [[multi-field dictionary]] broadly covers several subject fields (e.g., a [[business dictionary]]), a [[single-field dictionary]] narrowly covers one particular subject field (e.g., law), and a [[sub-field dictionary]] covers a singular field (e.g., constitutional law). For example, the 23-language [[Inter-Active Terminology for Europe]] is a multi-field dictionary, the [[American National Biography]] is a single-field, and the [[African American National Biography Project]] is a sub-field dictionary. In terms of the above coverage distinction between &quot;minimizing dictionaries&quot; and &quot;maximizing dictionaries&quot;, multi-field dictionaries tend to minimize coverage across subject fields (for instance, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of World Religions]]'') whereas single-field and sub-field dictionaries tend to maximize coverage within a limited subject field (''[[The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'
