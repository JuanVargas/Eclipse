 0-87980-447-5) and in 1937, ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' (ISBN 1-59330-200-2). The latter has not been out of print since it was first published and has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. In 1960, Hill published an abridged version of the book containing the Andrew Carnegie formula for wealth creation. For years it was the only version generally available. In 2004, Ross Cornwell published ''Think and Grow Rich!: The Original Version, Restored and Revised'' (Second Printing 2007), which restored the book to its original content, with slight revisions, and added comprehensive end notes, an index, and an appendix.

===Religion and world view===
Witnessing sectarianism and strife in 19th century Scotland regarding religion and philosophy, Carnegie kept his distance from organized religion and theism.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, David. Andrew Carnegie (New York: The Penguin Press, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie instead preferred to see things through naturalistic and scientific terms stating, &quot;Not only had I got rid of the theology and the supernatural, but I had found the truth of evolution.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Carnegie, Andrew. Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie (1920, 2006). ISBN 1-59986-967-5 (p. 339)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in life, Carnegie's firm opposition to religion softened. While he never professed belief in a particular religion, he did accompany his wife and daughter to worship at a Presbyterian church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0E13F6395C1B728DDDAA0A94DC405B898DF1D3 The New York Times], Nov. 29, 1918&lt;/ref&gt; He also prepared (but did not deliver) an address to St. Andrews in which he professed a belief in &quot;an Infinite and Eternal Energy from which all things proceed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Andrew Carnegie|last= Nasaw|first= David|year= 2006|publisher= The Penguinn Press|location= New York|page=625 |isbn= 1594201048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon Hill wrote that Carnegie asserted the importance of belief in &quot;Infinite Intelligence&quot;, a name Hill used to identify &quot;God&quot; or the &quot;Supreme Being&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Napoleon (1953, 1981, revised 2004) ''How To Raise Your Own Salary'', The Napoleon Hill Foundation,  pp. 77–78, ISBN 0-9743539-4-9 [also published as ''The Wisdom of Andrew Carnegie as Told to Napoleon Hill'', ISBN 0937539457&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Napoleon and Cornwell, Ross (2004; 3rd edition 2008) ''Think and Grow Rich!: The Original Version, Restored and Revised'', Aventine Press, p. 330, ISBN 1-59330-200-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===World peace===
Influenced by his &quot;favorite living hero in public life&quot;, the British liberal, [[John Bright]], Carnegie started his efforts in pursuit of world peace at a young age.&lt;ref&gt;Carnegie, Andrew. Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie (Boston, 1920), Ch. 21, pp. 282–283&lt;/ref&gt; His motto, &quot;All is well since all grows better&quot;, served not only as a good rationalisation of his successful business career but also in his view of international relations.

Despite his love and efforts towards international peace, Carnegie faced many dilemmas on his quest for world peace. These dilemmas are often regarded as conflicts between his view on international relations and his other loyalties. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, for example, Carnegie allowed his steel works to fill large orders of armour plate for the building of an enlarged and modernized United States Navy; while he opposed American oversea expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Carnegie, Andrew. An American Four-in-Hand in Britain (New York, 1883), pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote controversial criticisms of the British class structure which seemed to conflict with his promotion of [[United Kingdom&amp;nbsp;– United States relations|Anglo-American]] friendship.&lt;ref&gt;Carnegie, Andrew. Triumphant Democracy, passim&lt;/ref&gt;

On the matter of American annexation, Carnegie had always thought it is an unwise gesture for the United States. He did not oppose the annexation of the Hawaiian islands, Cuba and Puerto Rico, but Carnegie stood still on his opposition towards the annexation of the Philippines. Because unlike the Hawaiians, Cubans and Puerto Ricans, the Filipinos were willing to fight for their independence, Carnegie believed that the conquest of the islands is a denial of the fundamental democratic principle, and he also urged [[William McKinley]] to withdraw American troops and allow the Filipinos to live with their independence.&lt;ref&gt;Carnegie, Andrew. &quot;American Versus Imperialism,&quot; esp. pp.12–13&lt;/ref&gt; This act well impressed the other American anti-imperialists, who soon elected him vice-president of the [[Anti-Imperialist League]].

After he sold his steel company in 1901, Carnegie was able to get fully involved into the acts for the peace cause, both financially and personally. He gave away most of his fortunes to various peace-keeping agencies in order to keep them growing. When his friend, the British publicist [[William T. Stead]], asked him to create a new organisation for the goal of a peace and arbitration society, his reply was as such:

{{quote|I do not see that it is wise to devote our efforts to creating another organisation. Of course I may be wrong in believing that, but I am certainly not wrong that if it were dependent on any millionaire's money it would begin as an object of pity and end as one of derision. I wonder that you do not see this. There is nothing that robs a righteous cause of its strength more than a millionaire's money. Its life is tainted thereby.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Hendrick. Carnegie 2: p.337&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Carnegie believed that it is the effort and will of the people, that maintains the peace in international relations. Money is just a push for the act. If world peace depended solely on financial support, it would not seem a goal, but more like an act of pity.

The creation of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] in 1910 was regarded as a milestone on the road to the ultimate goal of abolition of war. Beyond a gift of $10 million for peace promotion, Carnegie also encouraged the &quot;scientific&quot; investigation of the various causes of war, and the adoption of judicial methods that should eventually eliminate them. He believed that the Endowment exists to promote information on the nations' rights and responsibilities under existing international law and to encourage other conferences to codify this law.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, David S. Andrew Carnegie's Quest for World Peace. Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 114, No. 5 (October 20, 1970), pp. 371–383&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, on the eve of the First World War, Carnegie founded the Church Peace Union (CPU), a group of leaders in religion, academia, and politics. Through the CPU, Carnegie hoped to mobilise the world's churches, religious organisations, and other spiritual and moral resources to join in promoting moral leadership to put an end to war forever. For its inaugural international event, the CPU sponsored a conference to be held on August 1, 1914, on the shores of Lake Constance in southern Germany. As the delegates made their way to the conference by train, Germany was invading Belgium.

Despite its inauspicious beginning, the CPU thrived. Today its focus is on ethics and it is known as the [[Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs]], an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit organisation, whose mission is to be the voice for ethics in international affairs.

The outbreak of the First World War was clearly a shock to Carnegie and his optimistic view on world peace. Although his promotion of [[anti-imperialism]] and world peace had all failed, and the Carnegie Endowment had not fulfilled his expectations, his beliefs and ideas on international relations had helped build the foundation of the [[League of Nations]] after his death, which took world peace to another level.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Manner of articulation}}

'''Approximants''' are [[phone (phonetics)|speech sounds]] that involve the [[manner of articulation|articulators]] approaching each other but not narrowly enough&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|1975|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; or with enough articulatory precision&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Martínez-Celdrán|2004|p=201}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create turbulent airflow. Therefore, approximants fall between [[fricative consonant|fricatives]], which do produce a turbulent airstream, and [[vowel]]s, which produce no turbulence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martínez-Celdrán 2004 201&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Martínez-Celdrán|2004|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; This class of sounds includes [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] approximants like {{IPA|[l]}} (as in ''less''), non-lateral approximants like {{IPA|[ɹ]}} (as in ''rest''), and [[semivowels]] like {{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} (as in ''yes'' and ''west'', respectively).&lt;ref name=&quot;Martínez-Celdrán 2004 201&quot;/&gt;

Before [[Peter Ladefoged]] coined the term &quot;approximant&quot; in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Martínez-Celdrán|2004|p=201}}, pointing to {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|1964|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term &quot;frictionless continuant&quot; referred to non-lateral approximants.

==Semivowels==
{{main|Semivowel}}
Some approximants resemble vowels in acoustic and articulatory properties and the terms ''[[semivowel]]'' and ''glide'' are often used for these non-syllabic vowel-like segments. The correlation between semivowels and vowels is strong enough that cross-language differences between semivowels correspond with the differences between their related vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=323}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Maddieson|Emmorey|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vowels and their corresponding semivowels alternate in many languages depending on the phonological environment, or for grammatical reasons, as is the case with [[Indo-European ablaut]]. Similarly, languages often avoid configurations where a semivowel precedes its corresponding vowel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|p=680}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Kawasaki|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of phoneticians distinguish between semivowels and approximants by their location in a syllable. Although he uses the terms interchangeably, {{Harvcoltxt|Montreuil|2004|p=104}} remarks that, for example, the final glides of English ''par'' and ''buy'' differ from French ''par'' ('through') and ''baille'' ('tub') in that, in the latter pair, the approximants appear in the [[syllable coda]], whereas, in the former, they appear in the [[syllable nucleus]]. This means that opaque (if not minimal) contrasts can occur in languages like [[Italian language|Italian]] (with the {{IPA|[j]}} of ''piede'', 'foot', appearing in the nucleus and that of ''piano'', 'slow', appearing in the syllable onset)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Montreuil|2004|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spanish (with a near minimal pair being ''abyecto'', 'abject', vs. ''abierto'' 'opened').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saporta|1956|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{note|Retroflex|*}} Because of the articulatory complexities of the American English rhotic, there is some variation in its phonetic description. A transcription with the IPA character for an [[alveolar approximant]] ({{IPA|[ɹ]}}) is common, though the sound is more [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]]. Actual retroflexion may occur as well and both occur as variations of the same sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hallé|Best|Levitt|1999|p=283}} citing {{Harvcoltxt|Delattre|Freeman|1968}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Zawadzki|Kuehn|1980}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Boyce|Espy-Wilson|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{Harvcoltxt|Catford|1988|p=161f}} makes a distinction between the vowels of American English (which he calls &quot;rhotacized&quot;) and vowels with &quot;retroflexion&quot; such as those that appear in [[Badaga language|Badaga]]; {{Harvcoltxt|Trask|1996|p=310}}, on the other hand, labels both as [[r-colored vowel|r-colored]] and notes that both have a lowered third [[formant]].&lt;ref&gt;Both cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Hamann|2003|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In articulation and often diachronically, [[palatal consonant|palatal]] approximants correspond to [[front vowel]]s, [[velar consonant|velar]] approximants to [[back vowel]]s, and labialized approximants to [[rounded vowel]]s. In American English, the [[rhotic consonant|rhotic]] approximant corresponds to the rhotic vowel. This can create alternations (as shown in the above table).

In addition to alternations, glides can be inserted to the left or the right of their corresponding vowels when occurring next to a hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|p=672}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], medial {{IPA|/i/}} triggers the formation of an inserted {{IPA|[j]}} that acts as a syllable onset so that when the affix {{IPA|/-ist/}} is added to футбол ('football') to make футболіст ('football player'), it's pronounced {{IPA|[futˈbo̞list]}} but маоїст ('maoist' from [[Mao Zedong]]), with the same affix, is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈmao'''j'''ist]}} with a glide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|pp=675–676}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dutch language|Dutch]] has a similar process that extends to mid vowels:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|pp=677–678}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''bioscoop'' → {{IPA|[bi'''j'''ɔskoːp]}} ('cinema')
* ''zee'' + ''en'' → {{IPA|[zeː'''j'''ə]}} ('seas')
* ''fluor'' → {{IPA|[fly'''ɥ'''ɔr]}} ('fluor')
* ''reu'' + ''en'' → {{IPA|[rø'''ɥ'''ə]}} ('male dogs')
* ''Rwanda'' → {{IPA|[ru'''ʋ'''andɐ]}} ('[[Rwanda]]')&lt;ref name=&quot;Dutch&quot;&gt;There is dialectal and allophonic variation in the realization of {{IPA|/ʋ/}}. For speakers who realize it as {{IPA|[ʋ]}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|p=683}} postulates an additional rule that changes any occurrence of {{IPA|[w]}} from glide insertion into {{IPA|[ʋ]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Boaz'' → {{IPA|[bo'''ʋ'''as]}} ('[[Boaz]]')&lt;ref name=&quot;Dutch&quot;/&gt;

Similarly, vowels can be inserted next to their corresponding glide in certain phonetic environments. [[Sievers' law]] describes this behaviour for [[Germanic languages|Germanic]].

Non-high semivowels also occur. In colloquial [[Nepali language|Nepali]] speech, a process of glide-formation occurs, wherein one of two adjacent vowels becomes non-syllabic; this process includes mid vowels so that {{IPA|[dʱo̯a]}} ('cause to wish') features a non-syllabic mid vowel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=323–324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish features a similar process and even nonsyllabic {{IPA|/a/}} can occur so that ''ahorita'' ('right away') is pronounced {{IPA|[a̯o̞ˈɾita]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Martínez-Celdrán|Fernández-Planas|Carrera-Sabaté|2003|pp=256–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many languages have [[central vowel]]s {{IPA|[ɨ, ʉ]}}, which lie between back/velar {{IPA|[ɯ, u]}} and front/palatal {{IPA|[i, y]}}, there are few cases of a corresponding approximant {{IPA|[ȷ̈]}}. One is in the Korean diphthong {{IPA|[ȷ̈i]}} or {{IPA|[ɨ̯i]}},&lt;ref&gt;[https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/iverson/www/kordiph.pdf Ahn &amp; Iverson (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mapudungun]] may be another: It has three high vowel sounds, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/ɨ/}} and three corresponding consonants, {{IPA|/j/}}, and {{IPA|/w/}}, and a third one is often described as a voiced unrounded velar fricative; some texts note a correspondence between this approximant and {{IPA|/ɨ/}} that is parallel to {{IPA|/j/}}-{{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}-{{IPA|/u/}}. An example is ''liq'' {{IPA|/ˈliɣ/}} ({{IPA|[ˈliɨ̯]}}?) ('white').&lt;ref&gt;Listen to a [http://www.logosdictionary.org/sound/mp/5119539_n.wav recording]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approximants versus fricatives==
In addition to less turbulence, approximants also differ from fricatives in the precision required to produce them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Boersma|1997|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
When emphasized, approximants may be slightly fricated (that is, the airstream may become slightly turbulent), which is reminiscent of fricatives. For example, the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''ayuda'' ('help') features a palatal approximant that is pronounced as a fricative in emphatic speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Martínez-Celdrán|2004|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such frication is generally slight and intermittent, unlike the strong turbulence of fricative consonants. 

Because voicelessness has comparatively reduced resistance to air flow from the lungs, the increased pulmonic pressure creates more turbulence, making acoustic distinctions between voiceless approximants (which are extremely rare cross-linguistically&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blevins|2006|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and voiceless fricatives difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ohala|1995|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is why, for example, the voiceless labialized velar approximant {{IPA|[ʍ]}} has traditionally been labeled a fricative, and no language is known to contrast it with a voiceless labialized velar fricative {{IPA|[xʷ]}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladefoged 1996 326&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]] has a voiceless [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] approximant, {{IPA|[l̥]}}, and [[Welsh phonology|Welsh]] has a voiceless lateral fricative {{IPA|[ɬ]}}, but the distinction is not always clear from descriptions of these languages. Again, no language is known to contrast the two.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladefoged 1996 326&quot;/&gt; 

For places of articulation further back in the mouth, languages do not contrast voiced fricatives and approximants. Therefore the IPA allows the symbols for the voiced fricatives to double for the approximants, with or without a lowering [[diacritic]]. 

Occasionally, the glottal &quot;fricatives&quot; are called approximants, since {{IPA|[h]}} typically has no more frication than voiceless approximants, but they are often [[phonation]]s of the glottis without any accompanying manner or place of articulation.

==Central approximants==

*[[bilabial approximant]] {{IPA|[β̞]}} (usually transcribed {{IPA|‹β›}})
*[[labiodental approximant]] {{IPA|[ʋ]}}
*[[dental approximant]] {{IPA|[ð̞]}} (usually transcribed {{IPA|‹ð›}})
*[[alveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɹ]}}
*[[retroflex approximant]] {{IPA|[ɻ]}} (a consonantal {{IPA|[ɚ]}})
*[[palatal approximant]] {{IPA|[j]}} (a consonantal {{IPA|[i]}})
*[[velar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɰ]}} (a consonantal {{IPA|[ɯ]}})
*[[uvular approximant]] {{IPA|[ʁ̞]}} (usually transcribed {{IPA|‹ʁ›}})
*[[pharyngeal approximant]] {{IPA|[ʕ̞]}} (a consonantal {{IPA|[ɑ]}}; usually transcribed {{IPA|‹ʕ›}})
*[[epiglottal approximant]] {{IPA|[ʢ̞]}} (usually transcribed {{IPA|‹ʢ›}})

==Lateral approximants==
In lateral approximants, the center of tongue makes solid contact with the roof of the mouth. However, the defining location is the side of the tongue, which only approaches the teeth. 

*[[alveolar lateral approximant|voiced alveolar lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[l]}}
*[[retroflex lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[ɭ]}}
*[[palatal lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[ʎ]}}
*[[velar lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[ʟ]}}
*[[velarized alveolar lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[ɫ]}}

==Coarticulated approximants with dedicated IPA symbols==

*[[voiced labio-velar approximant|voiced labialized velar approximant]] {{IPA|[w]}} (a consonantal {{IPA|[u]}})
*[[voiceless labio-velar approximant|voiceless labialized velar approximant]] {{IPA|[ʍ]}}(a consonantal {{IPA|[u̥]}})
*[[labial-palatal approximant|labialized palatal approximant]] {{IPA|[ɥ]}} (a consonantal {{IPA|[y]}})

'''Astronomer Royal''' is a senior post in the [[Royal Household]] of the [[Monarch|Sovereign]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. There are two officers, the senior being the Astronomer Royal dating from 22 June 1675; the second is the [[Astronomer Royal for Scotland]] dating from 1834.

[[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], who founded the [[Royal Observatory Greenwich]] in 1675 instructed the first Astronomer Royal [[John Flamsteed]], &quot;{{sic|hide=y|... forthwith to apply himself with |the most exact care and diligence to the rectifying the tables of the motions of the heavens, and the places of the fixed stars, so as to find out the so-much desired longitude of places for the perfecting the art of navigation}}.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;F Baily, &quot;An Account of the Rev. John Flamsteed&quot;, reprinted in [http://books.google.com/books?id=48L1w21XYI4C&amp;pg=PA293 vol.28,at p.293]. &quot;The Museum of foreign literature, science and art&quot;, R Walsh et al., publ. E Litell, 1836.&lt;/ref&gt;

From that time until 1972 the Astronomer Royal was Director of the Royal Observatory Greenwich. As Astronomer Royal he receives a [[stipend]] of 100 [[Pound Sterling|GBP]] per year and is a member of the [[Royal Household]], under the general authority of the [[Lord Chamberlain]]. After the separation of the two offices the position of Astronomer Royal has been largely honorary, though he remains available to advise the Sovereign on astronomical and related scientific matters, and the office is of great prestige.

There was also formerly a [[Royal Astronomer of Ireland]].

{{Refimprove|date=June 2009}}

The word '''''aeon''''', also spelled '''''eon''''' or '''''æon''''' ({{IPA-en|ˈiːɒn}}), originally means &quot;life&quot;, and/or &quot;being&quot;, though it then tended to mean &quot;age&quot;, &quot;forever&quot; or &quot;for [[eternity]]&quot;. It is a [[Latin]] transliteration from the [[koine Greek]] word {{polytonic|ὁ [[wikt:αἰών|αἰών]]}} (''ho aion''), from the archaic {{polytonic|αἰϝών}}  (''aiwon''). In [[Homer]] it typically refers to life or lifespan. Its latest meaning is more or less similar to the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]'' and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''[[olam]]''. A [[cognate]] [[Latin language|Latin]]  word ''aevum'' or ''aeuum'' (cf. {{polytonic|αἰϝών}}) for &quot;age&quot; is present in words such as ''longevity'' and ''mediæval''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pballew.net/arithm16.html Math words page 16&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term aeon may be used in reference to a period of a billion years (especially in [[geology]], [[cosmology]] or [[astronomy]]), its more common usage is for any long, indefinite, period of time.

==In Cosmology==

[[Roger Penrose]] uses the word '''''aeon''''' to describe the period between successive and cyclic [[big bang|big bangs]] within the context of [[conformal cyclic cosmology]]. In this theory, the remote future of the previous aeons becomes the Big Bang of subsequent aeons.

==Eternity or Age==
{{see|In saecula saeculorum}}
The [[Bible]] translation is a treatment of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''olam'' and the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''aion''.  These two words have similar meaning, and [[Young's Literal Translation]] renders them and their derivatives as “age” or “age-during”. Other [[English language|English]] versions most often translate them to indicate eternity, being translated as eternal, everlasting, forever, etc. However, there are notable exceptions to this in all major translations, such as {{bibleref2|Matthew|28:20}}: “…I am with you always, to the end of the age” (NRSV), the word “age” being a translation of ''aion''. Rendering ''aion'' to indicate eternality in this verse would result in the contradictory phrase “end of eternity”, so the question arises whether it should ever be so.&lt;ref&gt;Canon F. W. Farrar “Mercy and Judgment” 1904 pages 378-382 {{cite web |url=http://www.tentmaker.org/books/mercyandjudgment/mercy_and_judgment_ch1.html |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of [[Universal Reconciliation]] point out that this has significant implications for the [[problem of hell]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Talbott &quot;Three Pictures of God in Western Theology&quot; 1995 pages 13-15 {{cite web |url=http://www.willamette.edu/~ttalbott/PICTURES.pdf |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrast {{bibleref2|Matthew|25:46}} in well-known English translations with its rendering in Young's Literal Translation:

And these shall go away to punishment age-during, but the righteous to life age-during. (YLT)&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 25:46 Young's Literal Translation&lt;/ref&gt;

Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life. ([[New International Version|NIV]])&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 25:46 New International Version&lt;/ref&gt;

These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life. ([[New American Standard Bible|NASB]])&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 25:46 New American Standard Bible&lt;/ref&gt;

And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal. ([[King James Version|KJV]])&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 25:46 King James Version&lt;/ref&gt;

And these will depart into everlasting cutting-off, but the righteous ones into everlasting life. ([[New World Translation|NWT]])&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 25:46 New World Translation&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy and mysticism==
[[Plato]] used the word ''aeon'' to denote the eternal world of ideas, which he conceived was &quot;behind&quot; the perceived world, as demonstrated in his famous [[allegory of the cave]].

[[Christianity]]'s idea of &quot;[[eternal life]]&quot; comes from the word for life, ''zoe'', and a form of ''aeon'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G166&amp;Version=kjv Strong's link for the word Eternal (Aeon) in the Christian Concept of Eternal Life]&lt;/ref&gt; which could mean life in the next aeon, the [[Kingdom of God]], or [[Heaven]], just as much as immortality, as in {{bibleref2|John|3:16}}.

According to the heterodox Christian doctrine of [[Universal Reconciliation]], the [[Greek New Testament]] scriptures use the word &quot;eon&quot; to mean a long period of time (perhaps 1000 years) and the word &quot;eonian&quot; to mean &quot;during a long period of time&quot;; Thus there was a time before the eons, and the eonian period is finite. After each man's mortal life ends, he is judged worthy of eonian life or eonian punishment. That is, after the period of the eons, all punishment will cease and death is overcome and then God becomes the all in each one.  This contrasts with the traditional Christian belief in eternal life and eternal punishment.

[[Occult]]ists of the [[Thelema]] and [[O.T.O.]] traditions sometimes speak of a &quot;magical Aeon&quot; that may last for far less time, perhaps as little as 2,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Thelema]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Gnosticism===
{{main|Aeon (Gnosticism)}}

In many [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] systems, the various [[emanationism|emanations]] of [[God]], who is also known by such names as the One, the [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad]], ''Aion teleos'' (αἰών τέλεος &quot;The Broadest Aeon&quot;), [[Bythos]] (&quot;depth or profundity&quot;, Greek {{polytonic|βυθός}}), ''Proarkhe'' (&quot;before the beginning&quot;, Greek {{polytonic|προαρχή}}), the ''Arkhe'' (&quot;the beginning&quot;, Greek {{polytonic|ἀρχή}}), are called '''Aeons'''. In the different systems these emanations are differently named, classified, and described, but the emanation theory itself is common to all forms of Gnosticism. In the [[Basilidian]] Gnosis they are called sonships (υἱότητες ''huiotetes''; sing.: υἱότης ''huiotes''); according to [[Marcosians|Marcus]], they are numbers and sounds; in [[Valentinianism]] they form male/female pairs called &quot;syzygies&quot; (Greek {{polytonic|συζυγίαι}}, from σύζυγοι ''syzygoi'').

An '''airline''' provides [[civil aviation|air transport services]] for [[passenger]]s and/or [[freight]]. Airlines [[leasing|lease]] or own their [[aircraft]] with which to supply these services and may form [[partnership]]s or [[Airline alliance|alliances]] with other airlines for mutual benefit. Generally, airline companies are recognized with an [[Air operator's certificate|air operating certificate]] or license issued by a governmental aviation body.

Airlines vary from those with a single aircraft carrying [[mail]] or [[cargo]], through full-service international airlines operating hundreds of aircraft. Airline services can be categorized as being intercontinental, intra-continental, domestic, regional, or international, and may be operated as scheduled services or charters.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}

===The first airlines===
[[File:Porter 02.jpg|thumb|Failed attempt at an airline before DELAG]]

American aviation pioneers, such as [[Rufus Porter]] and [[Frederick Marriott]], attempted to start airlines using [[airship]]s in the mid-19th century, focusing on the New York–California route. Those attempts floundered due to such mishaps as the airships catching fire and the aircraft being ripped apart by spectators. [[DELAG]], ''Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-Aktiengesellschaft'' was the [[List of airlines by foundation|world's first airline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airships.net/delag-passenger-zeppelins |title=DELAG: The World's First Airline |publisher=Airships.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded on November 16, 1909 with government assistance, and operated airships manufactured by The [[Zeppelin|Zeppelin Corporation]]. Its headquarters were in [[Frankfurt]].  The four [[List of airlines by foundation|oldest non-dirigible airlines]] that still exist are Netherlands' [[KLM]],  Colombia's [[Avianca]], Australia's [[Qantas]], and the Czech Republic's [[Czech Airlines]]. KLM first flew in May 1920, while Qantas (which stands for ''Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Limited'') was founded in Queensland, Australia, in late 1920.

===U.S. airline industry===
====Early development====
[[File:TWA 1940.jpg|thumb|[[TWA]] [[Douglas DC-3]] in 1940. The DC-3, often regarded as one of the most influential aircraft in the history of commercial aviation, revolutionized the aviation industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dc3history.org/douglasdc3.html |title=The DC-3 Genesis of The Legend |publisher=Dc3history.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Tony Jannus]] conducted the United State's first scheduled commercial airline flight on 1 January 1914 for the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line.&lt;ref name=Society&gt;{{cite web | title=Tony Jannus, an enduring legacy of aviation | work=Tony Jannus Distinguished Aviation Society | publisher=tonyjannusaward.com | url=http://www.tonyjannusaward.com/history/ |date= |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 23-minute flight traveled between [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] and [[Tampa, Florida]], passing some {{convert|50|ft|m}} above Tampa Bay in Jannus' [[Benoist XIV]] biplane flying boat. [[Chalk's International Airlines]] began service between Miami and Bimini in the [[Bahamas]] in February 1919. Based in [[Ft. Lauderdale]], Chalk's claimed to be the oldest continuously operating airline in the United States until its closure in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airportbusiness.com/web/online/Top-News-Headlines/CHALKS-AIRLINES-LOSES-FLIGHT-LICENSE-ITS-AIRPORT-LEASE-COULD-BE-CANCELED/1$15115 |title=Chalks Airlines Loses Flight License | publisher=airportbusiness.com|date= |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[World War I]], the United States found itself swamped with aviators. Many decided to take their war-surplus aircraft on barnstorming campaigns, performing acrobatic maneuvers to woo crowds. In 1918, the [[United States Postal Service]] won the financial backing of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to begin experimenting with [[air mail]] service, initially using [[Curtiss Jenny]] aircraft that had been procured by the [[United States Army]] for reconnaissance missions on the Western Front. Private operators were the first to fly the mail but due to numerous accidents the US Army was tasked with mail delivery. During the course of the Army's involvement they proved to be too unreliable and lost their air mail duties. By the mid-1920s, the [[United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] had developed its own air mail network, based on a transcontinental backbone between [[New York, New York|New York]] and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. To supplant this service, they offered twelve contracts for spur routes to independent bidders. Some of the carriers that won these routes would, through time and mergers, evolve into [[Pan Am]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Braniff Airways]], [[American Airlines]], [[United Airlines]] (originally a division of [[Boeing]]), [[Trans World Airlines]], [[Northwest Airlines]], and [[Eastern Air Lines]].

Service during the early 1920s was sporadic: most airlines at the time were focused on [[airmail#History|carrying bags of mail]]. In 1925, however, the [[Ford Motor Company]] bought out the [[William Bushnell Stout|Stout Aircraft Company]] and began construction of the all-metal [[Ford Trimotor]], which became the first successful American airliner. With a 12-passenger capacity, the Trimotor made passenger service potentially profitable. Air service was seen as a supplement to [[rail transport|rail]] service in the American transportation network.

At the same time, [[Juan Trippe]] began a crusade to create an air network that would link America to the world, and he achieved this goal through his airline, [[Pan American World Airways]], with a fleet of flying boats that linked [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] to [[Shanghai]] and [[Boston]] to [[London]]. Pan Am and Northwest Airways (which began flights to Canada in the 1920s) were the only U.S. airlines to go international before the 1940s.

With the introduction of the [[Boeing 247]] and [[Douglas DC-3]] in the 1930s, the U.S. airline industry was generally profitable, even during the [[Great Depression]]. This trend continued until the beginning of [[World War II]].

====Development since 1945====
[[File:Boeing 377 Stratocruiser (B-29) American Overseas 1949-50.jpg|thumb|In October 1945, the [[American Export Airlines]] became the first airline to offer regular commercial flights between North America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Commercial_Aviation/atlantic_route/Tran4.htm |title=Air Transportation: The Beginnings of Commercial Transatlantic Service |publisher=Centennialofflight.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shown here is Am Ex [[Boeing 377]] ''Stratocruiser'' in 1949.]]

As governments met to set the standards and scope for an emergent civil air industry toward the end of the war, the U.S. took a position of maximum operating freedom; U.S. airline companies were not as hard-hit as European and the few Asian ones had been. This preference for &quot;open skies&quot; operating regimes continues, within limitations, to this day.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

World War II, like World War I, brought new life to the airline industry. Many airlines in the Allied countries were flush from lease contracts to the military, and foresaw a future explosive demand for civil air transport, for both passengers and cargo. They were eager to invest in the newly emerging flagships of air travel such as the [[Boeing Stratocruiser]], [[Lockheed Constellation]], and [[Douglas DC-6]]. Most of these new aircraft were based on American bombers such as the [[B-29]], which had spearheaded research into new technologies such as [[pressurization]]. Most offered increased efficiency from both added speed and greater payload.

In the 1950s, the [[De Havilland Comet]], [[Boeing 707]], [[Douglas DC-8]], and [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] became the first flagships of the Jet Age in the West, while the [[Soviet Union]] bloc had [[Tupolev Tu-104]] and [[Tupolev Tu-124]] in the fleets of state-owned carriers such as Czechoslovak [[Czech Airlines|ČSA]], Soviet [[Aeroflot]] and East-German [[Interflug]]. The [[Vickers Viscount]] and [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]] inaugurated turboprop transport.

The next big boost for the airlines would come in the 1970s, when the [[Boeing 747]], [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], and [[Lockheed L-1011]] inaugurated [[widebody]] (&quot;jumbo jet&quot;) service, which is still the standard in international travel. The [[Tupolev Tu-144]] and its Western counterpart, [[Concorde]], made supersonic travel a reality. Concorde first flew in 1969 and operated through 2003. In 1972, [[Airbus]] began producing Europe's most commercially successful line of airliners to date. The added efficiencies for these aircraft were often not in speed, but in passenger capacity, payload, and range. Airbus also features modern electronic cockpits that were common across their aircraft to enable pilots to fly multiple models with minimal cross-training.

[[File:Pan Am Boeing 747 at Zurich Airport in May 1985.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pan Am]] [[Boeing 747]] ''Clipper Neptune's Car'' in 1985. The deregulation of the American airline industry increased the financial troubles of the iconic airline which ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Commercial_Aviation/Bankruptcy/Tran9.htm |title=Air Transportation: The Airline Bankruptcies of the 1980s |publisher=Centennialofflight.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

1978's U.S. [[Airline deregulation act|airline industry deregulation]] lowered barriers for new airlines just as a downturn occurred. New start-ups entered during the downturn, during which time they found aircraft and funding, contracted hangar and maintenance services, trained new employees, and recruited laid off staff from other airlines.

As the business cycle returned to normalcy, major airlines dominated their routes through aggressive pricing and additional capacity offerings, often swamping new startups. Only [[America West Airlines]] (which has since merged with US Airways) remained a significant survivor from this new entrant era, as dozens, even hundreds, have gone under.

In many ways, the biggest winner in the deregulated environment was the air passenger. Indeed, the U.S. witnessed an explosive growth in demand for air travel, as many millions who had never or rarely flown before became regular fliers, even joining [[frequent flyer]] loyalty programs and receiving free flights and other benefits from their flying. New services and higher frequencies meant that business fliers could fly to another city, do business, and return the same day, for almost any point in the country. Air travel's advantages put intercity bus lines under pressure, and most have withered away.

By the 1980s, almost half of the total flying in the world took place in the U.S., and today the domestic industry operates over 10,000 daily departures nationwide.

Toward the end of the century, a new style of [[low-cost carrier|low cost airline]] emerged, offering a no-frills product at a lower price. [[Southwest Airlines]], [[JetBlue]], [[AirTran Airways]], [[Skybus Airlines]] and other low-cost carriers began to represent a serious challenge to the so-called &quot;legacy airlines&quot;, as did their low-cost counterparts in many other countries. Their commercial viability represented a serious competitive threat to the legacy carriers. However, of these, [[ATA Airlines|ATA]] and Skybus have since ceased operations.

Increasingly since 1978, US airlines have been reincorporated and [[off spin|spun off]] by newly created and interally led manangement companies, and thus becoming nothing more than operating units and subsidiaries with limited finanically decisive control. Among some of these [[holding company|holding companies]] and [[parent company|parent companies]] that are the relatively well known, are the [[UAL Corporation]], along with the [[AMR Corporation]], among a long [[list of airline holding companies]] sometime recognized world wide.  Less recognized are the [[private equity firm]]s which often seize managerial, financial, and [[board of directors]] control of distressed airline companies by temporarily investing large sums of [[Equity (finance)|capital]] in air carriers, so as to rescheme an airlines assets into a profitable organization or [[liquidate|liquidating]] an air carrier of their profitable and worthwhile routes and business operations.

Thus the last 50 years of the airline industry have varied from reasonably profitable, to devastatingly depressed. As the first major market to deregulate the industry in 1978, U.S. airlines have experienced more turbulence than almost any other country or region. Today, American Airlines is the only U.S. [[legacy carrier]] to survive bankruptcy-free.

====The Airline Industry Bailout====

Congress passed the [http://ostpxweb.ost.dot.gov/aviation/Data/stabilizationact.pdf Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act] (P.L. 107-42) in response to a severe liquidity crisis facing the already-troubled airline industry in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11th terrorist attacks]]. Congress sought to provide cash infusions to carriers for both the cost of the four-day federal shutdown of the airlines and the incremental losses incurred through December 31, 2001 as a result of the terrorist attacks. This resulted in the first government bailout of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;http://ostpxweb.ost.dot.gov/aviation/Data/stabilizationact.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000 and 2005 US airlines lost $30 billion with wage cuts of over $15 billion and 100,000 employees laid off.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. &amp; von Nordenflytch, A. (2009). &quot;Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees&quot;. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of the essential national economic role of a healthy aviation system, Congress authorized partial compensation of up to $5 billion in cash subject to review by the [[Department of Transportation]] and up to $10 billion in loan guarantees subject to review by a newly created [[Air Transportation Stabilization Board]] (ATSB). The applications to DOT for reimbursements were subjected to rigorous multi-year reviews not only by DOT program personnel but also by the [[Government Accountability Office]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04725r.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the DOT Inspector General.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oig.dot.gov/StreamFile?file=/data/pdfdocs/aa20011024.pdf ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oig.dot.gov/StreamFile?file=/data/pdfdocs/cr2003092.pdf ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the federal government provided $4.6 billion in one-time, subject-to-income-tax cash payments to 427 U.S. air carriers, with no provision for repayment, essentially a gift from the taxpayers. (Passenger carriers operating scheduled service received approximately $4 billion, subject to tax.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.gov/affairs/carrierpayments.htm |title=U |publisher=Dot.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ATSB approved loan guarantees to six airlines totaling approximately $1.6 billion. Data from the [[Treasury Department]] show that the government recouped the $1.6 billion and a profit of $339 million from the fees, interest and purchase of discounted airline stock associated with loan guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/atsb/ |title=U.S. Treasury - Air Transportation Stabilization Board |publisher=Treas.gov |date=2001-09-22 |accessdate=2010-08-22|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080709052637/http%3A//www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/atsb/ |archivedate = July 9, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European airline industry===
[[File:National Audit Office - Victoria - London - 020504.jpg|thumb|The Imperial Airways Empire Terminal, Victoria, [[London]]. Trains ran from here to [[flying boats]] in [[Southampton]], and to [[Croydon Airport]].]]

The first countries in Europe to embrace air transport were [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

Austria initiated the first regularly scheduled airmail service on March 31, 1918 in the midst of World War I. The route provided airmail service spanning Vienna to Krakow (now in Poland) to Lviv (now in Ukraine), as was often also extended to Kiev and Odessa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/airmails_20030210/refreshercourse.aspx Landmarks of airmail history: who's on first?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fPLm9omt_YIC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=lemberg+vienna+post+1918&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0NBTBZharm&amp;sig=puyZDmv7oZOViiUstnvY6CwB-4s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zW75TKeJEtWAhAfwkOWGCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=lemberg%20vienna%20post%201918&amp;f=false {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[KLM]], the oldest carrier still operating under its original name, was founded in 1919. The first flight (operated on behalf of KLM by [[Aircraft Transport and Travel]]) transported two English passengers to [[Schiphol]], [[Amsterdam]] from [[London]] in 1920. Like other major European airlines of the time (see France and the UK below), KLM's early growth depended heavily on the needs to service links with far-flung colonial possessions ([[Dutch Indies]]). It is only after the loss of the [[Dutch Empire]] that [[KLM]] found itself based at a small country with few potential passengers, depending heavily on transfer traffic, and was one of the first to introduce the hub-system to facilitate easy connections.

France began an air mail service to [[Morocco]] in 1919 that was bought out in 1927, renamed [[Aéropostale (aviation)|Aéropostale]], and injected with capital to become a major international carrier. In 1933, Aéropostale went [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]], was nationalized and merged with several other airlines into what became [[Air France]].

In Finland, the charter establishing Aero O/Y (now [[Finnair]]) was signed in the city of [[Helsinki]] on September 12, 1923. [[Junkers F 13]] D-335 became the first aircraft of the company, when Aero took delivery of it on March 14, 1924. The first flight was between Helsinki and [[Tallinn]], capital of [[Estonia]], and it took place on March 20, 1924, one week later.

Germany's [[Lufthansa]] began in 1926. Lufthansa, unlike most other airlines at the time, became a major investor in airlines outside of Europe, providing capital to [[Varig]] and Avianca. German airliners built by [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]], [[Dornier GmbH|Dornier]], and [[Fokker]] were the most advanced in the world at the time.  In 1931, the airship [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]] began offering regular scheduled passenger service between Germany and South America, usually every two weeks, which continued until 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airships.net/lz127-graf-zeppelin/history |title=LZ-127 Graf Zeppelin |publisher=Airships.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1936, the airship [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] entered passenger service and successfully crossed the Atlantic 36 times before crashing at Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airships.net/hindenburg |title=Hindenburg |publisher=Airships.net |date=2009-06-10 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom|British]] company Aircraft Transport and Travel commenced a London to Paris service on August 25, 1919, this was the world's first regular international flight. The United Kingdom's [[flag carrier]] during this period was [[Imperial Airways]], which became [[BOAC]] (British Overseas Airways Co.) in 1939. Imperial Airways used huge [[Handley-Page]] [[biplane]]s for routes between [[London]], the [[Middle East]], and India: images of Imperial aircraft in the middle of the [[Rub'al Khali]], being maintained by [[Bedouin]]s, are among the most famous pictures from the heyday of the [[British Empire]].

In [[Soviet Union]] the Chief Administration of the Civil Air Fleet was established in 1921. One of its first acts was to help found Deutsch-Russische Luftverkehrs A.G. (Deruluft), a German-Russian joint venture to provide air transport from Russia to the West. Domestic air service began around the same time, when Dobrolyot started operations on 15 July 1923 between Moscow and Nizhni Novgorod. Since 1932 all operations had been carried under the name Aeroflot. By the end of the 1930s Aeroflot had become the world's largest airline, employing more than 4,000 pilots and 60,000 other service personnel and operating around 3,000 aircraft (of which 75% were considered obsolete by its own standards). During the Soviet era Aeroflot was synonymous with Russian civil aviation, as it was the only air carrier. It became the first airline in the world to operate sustained regular jet services on 15 September 1956 with the [[Tupolev Tu-104]].

====Deregulation====

Deregulation of the [[European Union]] airspace in the early 1990s has had substantial effect on structure of the industry there. The shift towards 'budget' airlines on shorter routes has been significant. Airlines such as [[EasyJet]] and [[Ryanair]] have grown at the expense of the traditional national airlines.

There has also been a trend for these national airlines themselves to be privatised such as has occurred for [[Aer Lingus]] and [[British Airways]]. Other national airlines, including Italy's [[Alitalia]], have suffered - particularly with the rapid increase of oil prices in early 2008.

===Asian airline industry===

Although [[Philippine Airlines]] (PAL) was officially founded on February 26, 1941, its license to operate as an airliner was derived from merged Philippine Aerial Taxi Company (PATCO) established by mining magnate Emmanuel N. Bachrach on December 3, 1930, making it Asia's oldest scheduled carrier still in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/hawaiiaviation/hawaii-commercial-aviation/philippine-air-lines |title=Above the Pacific, by William Joseph Horvat, 1966, ISBN 978-0-8168-0000-1 |publisher=Hawaii.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial air service commenced three weeks later from [[Manila]] to [[Baguio]], making it Asia's first airline route. Bachrach's death in 1937 paved the way for its eventual merger with Philippine Airlines in March 1941 and made it Asia's oldest airline. It is also the oldest airline in Asia still operating under its current name.&lt;ref name=&quot;PAL&quot;&gt;Jane,  ''[http://www.janes.com Jane's airlines &amp; airliners By Jeremy Flack]'', First Edition, 2003, ISBN 978-0-00-715174-5&lt;/ref&gt; Bachrach's majority share in PATCO was bought by beer magnate Andres R. Soriano in 1939 upon the advice of General [[Douglas McArthur]] and later merged with newly formed Philippine Airlines with PAL as the surviving entity. Soriano has controlling interest in both airlines before the merger. PAL restarted service on March 15, 1941 with a single [[Beech Model 18]] NPC-54 aircraft, which started its daily services between [[Manila]] (from [[Nielson Field]]) and [[Baguio]], later to expand with larger aircraft such as the DC-3 and Vickers Viscount.

[[India]] was also one of the first countries to embrace civil aviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AcGn-Fmc43sC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=tata+airlines+first+airline&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a |title=An Introduction To Travel And Tourism By Pran Nath Seth, Sushma Seth Bhat |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first West Asian airline companies was [[Air India]], which had its beginning as [[Tata Airlines]] in 1932, a division of Tata Sons Ltd. (now [[Tata Group]]). The airline was founded by India's leading industrialist, [[JRD Tata]]. On October 15, 1932, J. R. D. Tata himself flew a single engined [[De Havilland Puss Moth]] carrying air mail (postal mail of [[Imperial Airways]]) from [[Karachi]] to [[Mumbai|Bombay]] via [[Ahmedabad]]. The aircraft continued to [[Madras]] via Bellary piloted by [[Royal Air Force]] pilot [[Nevill Vintcent]] . Tata Airlines was also one of the world's first major airlines which began its operations without any support from the Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=s0g7tCYYu-gC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=tata+airlines+first+airline&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA176,M1 |title=International Environmental Law By Bhatt |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of [[World War II]], the airline presence in Asia came to a relative halt, with many new flag carriers donating their aircraft for military aid and other uses. Following the end of the war in 1945, regular commercial service was restored in India and Tata Airlines became a public limited company on July 29, 1946 under the name Air India. After the [[independence of India]], 49% of the airline was acquired by the [[Government of India]]. In return, the airline was granted status to operate international services from India as the designated flag carrier under the name [[Air India International]].

On July 31, 1946, a chartered Philippine Airlines (PAL) [[DC-4]] ferried 40 American servicemen to [[Oakland]], [[California]] from Nielson Airport in [[Makati City]] with stops in [[Guam]], [[Wake Island]], [[Johnston Atoll]] and [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], making PAL the first Asian airline to cross the [[Pacific Ocean]]. A regular service between [[Manila]] and [[San Francisco]] was started in December. It was during this year that the airline was designated as the flag carrier of Philippines.

During the era of [[decolonization]], newly-born Asian countries started to embrace air transport. Among the first Asian carriers during the era were [[Cathay Pacific]] of [[Hong Kong]] (founded in September 1946), [[Orient Airways]] (later [[Pakistan International Airlines]]; founded in October 1946), Malayan Airlines (later [[Singapore Airlines|Singapore]] and [[Malaysia Airlines]]; founded in 1947), [[El Al]] in [[Israel]] in 1948, [[Garuda Indonesia]] in 1949, [[Japan Airlines]] in 1951,[[Thai Airways International]] in 1960, and [[Korean Air]] in 1962.

===Latin American airline industry===
[[File:Tam.a330-200.pt-mvl.arp.jpg|thumb|[[TAM Airlines]] is the largest airline in Latin America in terms of number of annual passengers flown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airtravel.about.com/od/basedincaribbeansa/tp/top10la.htm |title=Top 10 Airlines in Latin America By Arlene Fleming |publisher=Airtravel.about.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Among the first countries to have regular airlines in Latin America were Cuba with [[Cubana de Aviación]], Colombia with Avianca, Brazil with [[Varig]], [[Chile]] with [[LAN Chile]] (today [[LAN Airlines]]), [[Dominican Republic]] with [[Dominicana de Aviación]], Mexico with [[Mexicana de Aviación]], and [[Grupo TACA|TACA]] as a brand of several airlines of Central American countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Nicaragua). All the previous airlines started regular operations before World War II.

The air travel market has evolved rapidly over recent years in [[Latin America]]. Some industry estimations over 2000 new aircraft will begin service over the next five years in this region.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

These airlines serve domestic flights within their countries, as well as connections within Latin America and also overseas flights to North America, Europe, Australia, Africa and Asia.

Just three airlines: LAN (Latin American Networks), Oceanair and TAM Airlines have international subsidiaries with [[Chile]] as the central operation along with [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Argentina]] and some operations in the [[Dominican Republic]] and TAM with TAM Mercosur have a base in [[Asuncion]], [[Paraguay]]. Avianca have the control of Oceanair, VIP Airlines and also have an estrategic alliance with TACA.

[[File:Garuda Indonesia Air Lines at Narita 200507.jpg|thumb|left|[[Garuda Indonesia]] [[Boeing 747-400]] parked at [[Narita International Airport]]. This Indonesian [[Flag carrier]] is wholly owned by the [[Politics of Indonesia|Indonesian Government]]]]

Many countries have [[national airline]]s that the government owns and operates. Fully private airlines are subject to a great deal of government regulation for economic, political, and safety concerns. For instance, governments often intervene to halt airline labor actions in order to protect the free flow of people, communications, and goods between different regions without compromising safety.

The United States, Australia, and to a lesser extent Brazil, Mexico, India, the United Kingdom and Japan have &quot;deregulated&quot; their airlines. In the past, these governments dictated airfares, route networks, and other operational requirements for each airline. Since deregulation, airlines have been largely free to negotiate their own operating arrangements with different airports, enter and exit routes easily, and to levy airfares and supply flights according to market demand.
[[File:Cyprus airways a330.jpg|thumb|[[Cyprus Airways]] national airline of Cyprus]]
The entry barriers for new airlines are lower in a deregulated market, and so the U.S. has seen hundreds of airlines start up (sometimes for only a brief operating period). This has produced far greater competition than before deregulation in most markets, and average fares tend to drop 20% or more.{{fact|date=May 2011}} The added competition, together with pricing freedom, means that new entrants often take market share with highly reduced rates that, to a limited degree, full service airlines must match. This is a major constraint on profitability for established carriers, which tend to have a higher cost base.

As a result, profitability in a deregulated market is uneven for most airlines. These forces have caused some major airlines to go out of business, in addition to most of the poorly established new entrants.

===International===
[[File:SIA Airbus A380, 9V-SKA, SIN 8.jpg|thumb|[[Singapore Airlines]] [[Airbus A380]] lands at [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airport]]. Singapore Airlines was the first international airline to operate the A380, the world's largest passenger airliner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singaporeair.com/mediacentre/pacontent/news/NE_1608.jsp Singapore Airlines - News Releases]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Groups such as the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] establish worldwide standards for safety and other vital concerns. Most international air traffic is regulated by bilateral agreements between countries, which designate specific carriers to operate on specific routes. The model of such an agreement was the [[Bermuda Agreement]] between the US and UK following World War II, which designated airports to be used for transatlantic flights and gave each government the authority to nominate carriers to operate routes.

Bilateral agreements are based on the &quot;[[freedoms of the air]]&quot;, a group of generalized traffic rights ranging from the freedom to overfly a country to the freedom to provide domestic flights within a country (a very rarely granted right known as [[cabotage]]). Most agreements permit airlines to fly from their home country to designated airports in the other country: some also extend the freedom to provide continuing service to a third country, or to another destination in the other country while carrying passengers from overseas.

In the 1990s, &quot;[[open skies]]&quot; agreements became more common. These agreements take many of these regulatory powers from state governments and open up international routes to further competition. Open skies agreements have met some criticism, particularly within the [[European Union]], whose airlines would be at a comparative disadvantage with the United States' because of [[cabotage]] restrictions.

==Economic considerations==
[[File:Tran12G7.jpg|thumb|[[Juan Trippe]], the founder of [[Pan American World Airways]], surveying his globe. The collapse of Pan Am, an airline often credited for shaping the international airline industry, in December 1991 highlighted the financial complexities faced by major airline companies.]]

Historically, air travel has survived largely through state support, whether in the form of equity or subsidies. The airline industry as a whole has made a cumulative loss during its 100-year history, once the costs include subsidies for aircraft development and airport construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/airlines/story/0,,1715861,00.html Wings of Desire], Guardian, Thursday February 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnkay.com/2005/09/27/airlines-and-the-canine-features-of-unprofitable-industries/ Airlines and the canine features of unprofitable industries], Financial Times, September 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

One argument is that [[positive externalities]], such as higher growth due to global mobility, outweigh the microeconomic losses and justify continuing government intervention. A historically high level of government intervention in the airline industry can be seen as part of a wider political consensus on strategic forms of transport, such as [[highways]] and [[railways]], both of which receive public funding in most parts of the world. Profitability is likely to improve in the future as privatization continues and more competitive low-cost carriers proliferate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Although many countries continue to operate state-owned or parastatal airlines, many large airlines today are privately owned and are therefore governed by microeconomic principles in order to maximize shareholder profit.

===Ticket revenue===

Airlines assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize profitability. The pricing of airline tickets has become increasingly complicated over the years and is now largely determined by computerized [[yield management]] systems.

Because of the complications in scheduling flights and maintaining profitability, airlines have many loopholes that can be used by the knowledgeable traveler. Many of these airfare secrets are becoming more and more known to the general public, so airlines are forced to make constant adjustments.

Most airlines use differentiated pricing, a form of [[price discrimination]], in order to sell air services at varying prices simultaneously to different segments. Factors influencing the price include the days remaining until departure, the booked load factor, the forecast of total demand by price point, competitive pricing in force, and variations by day of week of departure and by time of day. Carriers often accomplish this by dividing each cabin of the aircraft (first, business and economy) into a number of [[travel class]]es for pricing purposes.

A complicating factor is that of origin-destination control (&quot;O&amp;D control&quot;). Someone purchasing a ticket from Melbourne to Sydney (as an example) for AU$200 is competing with someone else who wants to fly Melbourne to Los Angeles through Sydney on the same flight, and who is willing to pay AU$1400. Should the airline prefer the $1400 passenger, or the $200 passenger plus a possible Sydney-Los Angeles passenger willing to pay $1300? Airlines have to make hundreds of thousands of similar pricing decisions daily.
[[File:Flughafen Frankfurt am Main.JPG|thumb|[[Lufthansa]] Boeing 747-400.]]

The advent of advanced computerized reservations systems in the late 1970s, most notably [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], allowed airlines to easily perform [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefit analyses]] on different pricing structures, leading to almost perfect price discrimination in some cases (that is, filling each seat on an aircraft at the highest price that can be charged without driving the consumer elsewhere).

The intense nature of airfare pricing has led to the term &quot;[[fare war]]&quot; to describe efforts by airlines to undercut other airlines on competitive routes. Through computers, new airfares can be published quickly and efficiently to the airlines' sales channels. For this purpose the airlines use the [[Airline Tariff Publishing Company]] (ATPCO), who distribute latest fares for more than 500 airlines to [[Computer Reservation System]]s across the world.

The extent of these pricing phenomena is strongest in &quot;legacy&quot; carriers. In contrast, low fare carriers usually offer preannounced and simplified price structure, and sometimes quote prices for each leg of a trip separately.

Computers also allow airlines to predict, with some accuracy, how many passengers will actually fly after making a reservation to fly. This allows airlines to overbook their flights enough to fill the aircraft while accounting for &quot;no-shows,&quot; but not enough (in most cases) to force paying passengers off the aircraft for lack of seats. Since an average of ⅓ of all seats are flown empty{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, stimulative pricing for low demand flights coupled with [[overbooking]] on high demand flights can help reduce this figure. This is especially crucial during tough economic times as airlines undertake massive cuts to ticket prices in order to retain demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cheapflights.co.uk/flights/2009/05/recession-prompts-surge-in-cheap-flights.html |title=Recession ‘prompts surge in cheap flights’ - Cheapflights.co.uk |publisher=News.cheapflights.co.uk |date=2009-05-13 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operating costs===
[[File:virgin atlantic a340-600 g-vyou arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Airbus A340]]-600 of [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]]. In October 2008, Virgin Atlantic offered to combine its operations with [[BMI (airline)|BMI]] in an effort to reduce operating costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article5037731.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Virgin proposes tieup with BMI and Lufthansa | date=October 29, 2008 | accessdate=April 23, 2010 | first=David | last=Robertson}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Full-service airlines have a high level of fixed and operating costs in order to establish and maintain air services: labor, fuel, airplanes, engines, spares and parts, IT services and networks, airport equipment, airport handling services, sales distribution, catering, training, [[aviation insurance]] and other costs. Thus all but a small percentage of the income from ticket sales is paid out to a wide variety of external providers or internal cost centers.

Moreover, the industry is structured so that airlines often act as tax collectors. Airline fuel is untaxed because of a series of treaties existing between countries. Ticket prices include a number of fees, taxes and surcharges beyond the control of airlines. Airlines are also responsible for enforcing government regulations. If airlines carry passengers without proper documentation on an international flight, they are responsible for returning them back to the original country.

Analysis of the 1992–1996 period shows that every player in the air transport chain is far more profitable than the airlines, who collect and pass through fees and revenues to them from ticket sales. While airlines as a whole earned 6% return on capital employed (2-3.5% less than the cost of capital), airports earned 10%, catering companies 10-13%, handling companies 11-14%, aircraft lessors 15%, aircraft manufacturers 16%, and global distribution companies more than 30%. (Source: Spinetta, 2000, quoted in Doganis, 2002)

In contrast, [[Southwest Airlines]] has been the most [[Profit (accounting)|profitable]] of airline companies since 1973.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The widespread entrance of a new breed of low cost airlines beginning at the turn of the century has accelerated the demand that full service carriers control costs. Many of these low cost companies emulate [[Southwest Airlines]] in various respects, and like Southwest, they are able to eke out a consistent profit throughout all phases of the business cycle.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

As a result, a [[shakeout]] of airlines is occurring in the U.S. and elsewhere. [[United Airlines]], [[Continental Airlines]] (twice), [[US Airways]] (twice), [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[Northwest Airlines]] have all declared [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy. Some{{Who|date=July 2008}} argue that it would be far better for the industry as a whole if a wave of actual closures were to reduce the number of &quot;undead&quot; airlines competing with healthy airlines while being artificially protected from creditors via [[bankruptcy]] law. On the other hand, some{{Who|date=July 2008}} have pointed out that the reduction in capacity would be short lived given that there would be large quantities of relatively new aircraft that bankruptcies would want to get rid of and would re-enter the market either as increased fleets for the survivors or the basis of cheap planes for new startups.

Where an airline has established an engineering base at an airport then there may be considerable economic advantages in using that same airport as a preferred focus (or &quot;hub&quot;) for its scheduled flights.

===Assets and financing===
[[File:Maslounge.jpg|thumb|The 'Golden Lounge' of [[Malaysia Airlines]] at [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] (KLIA). The airline has ownership of special slots at KLIA giving it a competitive edge over other airlines operating at the airport.]]

Airline financing is quite complex, since airlines are highly leveraged operations. Not only must they purchase (or lease) new airliner bodies and engines regularly, they must make major long-term fleet decisions with the goal of meeting the demands of their markets while producing a fleet that is relatively economical to operate and maintain. Compare [[Southwest Airlines]] and their reliance on a single airplane type (the [[Boeing 737]] and derivatives), with the now defunct [[Eastern Air Lines]] which operated 17 different aircraft types, each with varying pilot, engine, maintenance, and support needs.

A second financial issue is that of [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[fuel]] purchases, which are usually second only to [[Labour (economics)|labor]] in its relative cost to the company. However, with the current high fuel prices it has become the largest cost to an airline. Legacy airlines, compared with new entrants, have been hit harder by rising fuel prices partly due to the running of older, less fuel efficient aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;  While hedging instruments can be expensive, they can easily pay for themselves many times over in periods of increasing fuel costs, such as in the 2000–2005 period.

In view of the congestion apparent at many international [[airport]]s, the ownership of slots at certain airports (the right to take-off or land an aircraft at a particular time of day or night) has become a significant tradable asset for many airlines. Clearly take-off slots at popular times of the day can be critical in attracting the more profitable business traveler to a given airline's flight and in establishing a competitive advantage against a competing airline. If a particular city has two or more airports, market forces will tend to attract the less profitable routes, or those on which competition is weakest, to the less congested airport, where slots are likely to be more available and therefore cheaper. Other factors, such as surface transport facilities and onward connections, will also affect the relative appeal of different airports and some long distance flights may need to operate from the one with the longest runway.

===Airline partnerships===
[[File:JA8941-oneworld-01.jpg|thumb|A [[Japan Airlines]] Boeing 777-300 with special [[Oneworld]] livery. Oneworld is the third largest airline alliance after [[Star Alliance]] and [[SkyTeam]].]]

[[Codeshare agreement|Codesharing]] is the most common type of airline partnership; it involves one airline selling tickets for another airline's flights under its own airline code. An early example of this was [[Japan Airlines]]' (JAL) codesharing partnership with Aeroflot in the 1960s on [[Tokyo]]–[[Moscow]] flights; Aeroflot operated the flights using Aeroflot aircraft, but JAL sold tickets for the flights as if they were JAL flights. This practice allows airlines to expand their operations, at least on paper, into parts of the world where they cannot afford to establish bases or purchase aircraft. Another example was the [[Austrian Airlines|Austrian]]– [[Sabena]] partnership on the [[Vienna]]–[[Brussels]]–[[New York City|New York]]/JFK route during the late '60s, using a Sabena [[Boeing 707]] with Austrian [[Aircraft livery|livery]].

Since airline reservation requests are often made by city-pair (such as &quot;show me flights from Chicago to Düsseldorf&quot;), an airline who is able to codeshare with another airline for a variety of routes might be able to be listed as indeed offering a Chicago–[[Düsseldorf]] flight. The passenger is advised however, that airline no. 1 operates the flight from say Chicago to Amsterdam, and airline no. 2 operates the continuing flight (on a different airplane, sometimes from another terminal) to Düsseldorf. Thus the primary rationale for code sharing is to expand one's service offerings in city-pair terms so as to increase sales.

A more recent development is the [[airline alliance]], which became prevalent in late 1990s. These alliances can act as virtual mergers to get around government restrictions. Groups of airlines such as the [[Star Alliance]], [[Oneworld]] and [[SkyTeam]] coordinate their passenger service programs (such as lounges and [[frequent-flyer program]]s), offer special interline tickets, and often engage in extensive codesharing (sometimes systemwide). These are increasingly integrated business combinations—sometimes including cross-equity arrangements—in which products, service standards, schedules, and airport facilities are standardized and combined for higher efficiency. One of the first airlines to start an alliance with another airline was [[KLM]], who partnered with [[Northwest Airlines]]. Both airlines later entered the [[SkyTeam]] alliance after the [[Air France-KLM|fusion of KLM and Air France]] in 2004.

Often the companies combine [[Information technology|IT]] operations, or purchase fuel and aircraft as a bloc in order to achieve higher bargaining power. However, the alliances have been most successful at purchasing invisible supplies and services, such as fuel. Airlines usually prefer to purchase items visible to their passengers to differentiate themselves from local competitors. If an airline's main domestic competitor flies Boeing airliners, then the airline may prefer to use Airbus aircraft regardless of what the rest of the alliance chooses.

===Fuel hedging===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
[[File:Jetfuel.jpg|thumb| Average jet fuel prices per gallon for major United States airlines.]]

Southwest is credited with maintaining strong business profits between 1999 and the early 2000s due to its fuel hedging policy.  Looking at the annual reports many other airlines are replicating Southwest's hedging policy to control their fuel costs.

Modern [[turbofan]] and [[turboprop]] engines are considerably more fuel-efficient and less polluting than earlier models. However, despite this, the rapid growth of [[air travel]] in recent years contributes to an increase in total pollution attributable to [[aviation]], offsetting some of the reductions achieved by automobiles. In the [[European Union|EU]] [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from aviation increased by 87% between 1990 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Climate change: Commission proposes bringing air transport into EU Emissions Trading Scheme | publisher = EU press release | date = 2006-12-20 | url = http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/1862 | accessdate = 2008-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CO2 emissions from the jet fuel burned per passenger on an average 3200&amp;nbsp;kilometers (1992&amp;nbsp;miles) airline flight is about 353 kilograms (776&amp;nbsp;pounds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=carbon-footprint-calculator|url=http://www.terrapass.com/carbon-footprint-calculator/methodology-popup.html|publisher= TerraPass.com|accessdate=Feb 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loss of natural habitat potential associated with the jet fuel burned per passenger on a 3200&amp;nbsp;kilometers (1992&amp;nbsp;miles) airline flight is estimated to be 250 square meters (2700 square feet).{{Verify source|date=May 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=environmental impact of airline flights|url=http://ecofx.org/wiki/index.php?title=Airline|publisher=ecofx.org|accessdate=Feb 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of purported climate change and [[peak oil]], there is a debate about possible [[taxation]] of air travel and the inclusion of aviation in an [[emissions trading]] scheme, with a view to ensuring that the total [[external costs]] of aviation are taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/trading/eu/pdf/including-aviation-icf.pdf Including Aviation into the EU ETS: Impact on EU allowance prices] ICF Consulting for DEFRA February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The airline industry is responsible for about 11 percent of [[greenhouse gas]]es emitted by the U.S. transportation sector. [[Boeing]] estimates that biofuels could reduce flight-related greenhouse-gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent. The solution would be blending algae fuels with existing jet fuel:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/03/AR2008010303907.html | work=The Washington Post | title=A Promising Oil Alternative: Algae Energy | date=January 6, 2008 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Boeing and [[Air New Zealand]] are collaborating with leading Brazilian biofuels maker [[Tecbio]] and [[Aquaflow Bionomic]] of New Zealand and other jet biofuel developers around the world.
* [[Virgin Atlantic]] and [[Virgin Green Fund]] are looking into the technology as part of a biofuels initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Ángel González |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/boeingaerospace/2003858756_boeingenergy30.html |title=Boeing/aerospace &amp;#124; To go green in jet fuel, Boeing looks at algae &amp;#124; Seattle Times Newspaper |publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=2007-08-30 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* KLM has made the first commercial flight with bio-fuel in 2009.

==Call signs==

Each operator of a scheduled or charter flight uses an [[List of airline call signs|airline call sign]] when communicating with airports or air traffic control centres. Most of these call-signs are derived from the airline's trade name, but for reasons of history, marketing, or the need to reduce ambiguity in spoken English (so that pilots do not mistakenly make navigational decisions based on instructions issued to a different aircraft), some airlines and air forces use call-signs less obviously connected with their trading name. For example, British Airways uses a ''Speedbird'' call-sign, named after the logo of its predecessor, [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]], while [[SkyEurope]] used ''Relax''.

==Airline personnel==

The various types of airline personnel include:
Flight operations personnel including flight safety personnel.
* [[Flight crew]], responsible for the operation of the aircraft. Flight crew members include:
** [[Aviator|Pilots]] ([[Captain (civil aviation)|Captain]] and [[First Officer (civil aviation)|First Officer]]: some older aircraft also required a [[Flight Engineer]] and or a [[Navigator]])
** [[Flight attendant]]s, (led by a [[purser]] on larger aircraft)
** [[Sky marshal|in-flight security personnel]] on some airlines (most notably [[El Al]])
* [[Groundcrew]], responsible for operations at airports. Ground crew members include:
** Aerospace and avionics engineers responsible for certifying the aircraft for flight and management of aircraft maintenance
*** [[Aerospace]] engineers, responsible for airframe, powerplant and electrical systems maintenance
*** [[Avionics]] engineers responsible for avionics and instruments maintenance
** [[Airframe]] and [[powerplant]] technicians
** Electric System technicians, responsible for maintenance of electrical systems
** [[Avionics]] technicians, responsible for maintenance of avionics
** [[Flight dispatcher]]s
** [[Baggage handler]]s
** Ramp Agents
** [[Gate agent]]s
** Ticket agents
** Passenger service agents (such as [[airline lounge]] employees)
** Reservation agents, usually (but not always) at facilities outside the airport.

Airlines follow a [[corporation|corporate]] structure where each broad area of operations (such as maintenance, flight operations(including flight safety),
and passenger service) is supervised by a vice president. Larger airlines often appoint vice presidents to oversee each of the
airline's hubs as well. Airlines employ [[lawyers]] to deal with regulatory procedures and other administrative tasks.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Industry trends==
[[File:World-airline-routemap-2009.png|thumb|256px|Map of scheduled airline traffic in 2009]]

The pattern of ownership has been privatized in the recent years, that is, the ownership has gradually changed from governments to private and individual sectors or organizations. This occurs as regulators permit greater freedom and non-government ownership, in steps that are usually decades apart. This pattern is not seen for all airlines in all regions. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The overall trend of demand has been consistently increasing. In the 1950s and 1960s, annual growth rates of 15% or more were common. Annual growth of 5-6% persisted through the 1980s and 1990s{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Growth rates are not consistent in all regions, but countries with a de-regulated airline industry have more competition and greater pricing freedom. This results in lower fares and sometimes dramatic spurts in traffic growth. The U.S., Australia, Canada, Japan, [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], India and other markets exhibit this trend.  The industry has been observed to be cyclical in its financial performance. Four or five years of poor earnings precede five or six years of improvement. But profitability even in the good years is generally low, in the range of 2-3% net profit after interest and tax. In times of profit, airlines lease new generations of airplanes and upgrade services in response to higher demand. Since 1980, the industry has not earned back the cost of capital during the best of times. Conversely, in bad times losses can be dramatically worse.  [[Warren Buffett]] once said that despite all the money that has been invested in all airlines, the net profit is less than zero. He believes it is one of the hardest businesses to manage.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

As in many mature industries, consolidation is a trend. Airline groupings may consist of limited bilateral partnerships, long-term, multi-faceted alliances between carriers, equity arrangements, [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]], or [[takeover]]s. Since governments often restrict ownership and merger between companies in different countries, most consolidation takes place within a country. In the U.S., over 200 airlines have merged, been taken over, or gone out of business since deregulation in 1978. Many international airline managers are lobbying their governments to permit greater consolidation to achieve higher economy and efficiency.

The '''Australian Democrats''' is an Australian [[political party]] espousing a [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] ideology. It was formed in 1977, by a merger of the [[Australia Party]] and the [[New LM]], after principals of those minor parties secured the commitment of former Liberal minister [[Don Chipp]], as a high profile leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianpolitics.com/parties/democrats/history.shtml |title=Democrats History at |publisher=Australianpolitics.com |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's 30-year representation in the [[Parliament of Australia]] ended on 30 June 2008, after the loss of its four remaining [[Senate of Australia|Senate]] seats; two of the senators had retired from politics and the other two were defeated at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 election]], in which the party polled only 1.29% of the national Senate vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;results.aec.gov.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm |title=2007 Senate election: (National tally of) First Preferences by Group |publisher=Results.aec.gov.au |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party is based on the principles of honesty, tolerance, compassion and [[direct democracy]] through postal ballots of all members, so that &quot;there should be no [[hierarchical]] structure ... by which a carefully engineered elite could make decisions for the members.&quot;&lt;ref name=thirdman&gt;Chipp D and Larkin J ''The Third Man'' Rigby, Melbourne (1978) ISBN 0-7270-0827-7&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p187}} From the outset, members' participation was fiercely protected in national and divisional constitutions prescribing internal elections, regular meeting protocols, annual conferences—and monthly journals for open discussion and balloting. Dispute resolution procedures were established, with final recourse to a party [[ombudsman]] and membership ballot.

Policies determined by the unique participatory method promoted environmental awareness and [[sustainability]], opposition to the primacy of [[economic rationalism]] (Australian [[neoliberalism]]), preventative approaches to human health and welfare, animal rights, rejection of nuclear technology and weapons.

The Australian Democrats were the first representatives of [[green politics]] at the federal level in Australia. They played a key role in the ''cause célèbre'' of the [[Franklin Dam#Inquiry, referendum and election|Franklin River Dam]].

The party's centrist role makes it subject to criticism from both the right and left of the political spectrum. In particular, Chipp's former [[Liberal Party of Australia|conservative]] affiliation was frequently recalled by opponents on the left.&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Such as the then [[Democratic Socialist Perspective|Socialist Workers' Party]] and early green-left parties such as the [[United Tasmania Group]].&lt;/ref&gt; This problem was to torment later leaders and strategists who, by 1991, were proclaiming &quot;the electoral objective&quot; as a higher priority than the rigorous participatory democracy espoused by the party's founders.&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;The first substantive reason given by rebellious senators for deposing leader [[Janet Powell]] in 1991 was her alleged failure to develop a media profile which would attract more electoral support. The first conclusive constitutional abandonment of founding principles was probably the July 1993, decision of the party's national executive to terminate monthly publication of the members' ''National Journal'' and to replace it with less frequent publication of glossy promotional material.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over three decades, the Australian Democrats achieved representation in the legislatures of the ACT, South Australia, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania as well as [[Australian Senate|Senate]] seats in all six states. However, at the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004]] and [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007]] elections, all seven of its Senate seats were lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;results.aec.gov.au&quot;/&gt;

In 2009, the party attempted to reconstruct by reducing membership fees.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.democrats.org.au/news/index.htm?press_id=6620&amp;display=1 Australian Democrats Begin Rebuilding with More Affordable Membership]
'' Party media release, 22 April 2009. Retrieved January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the March 2010 election held in South Australia (the party's registered home state&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registered_parties/ad.htm Registered parties] at Australian Electoral Commission, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;), the Australian Democrats attracted less than one percent of the Upper House vote.

==History==
===1977–79===
[[Image:DonChipp-1977.jpg|right|thumb|[[Don Chipp]], Democrats leader 1977–1986]]
On the evening of 29 April 1977, Don Chipp addressed an overflowing Perth Town Hall meeting which unanimously passed a resolution to form a [[Centre-Line Party]], which Chipp was invited to lead&lt;ref name=thirdman/&gt;{{rp|p185}}—but he firmly declined to reverse his avowed decision to quit politics, having resigned from the Liberal Party and been offered a lucrative position as a radio public affairs commentator. However, at a meeting in the Melbourne Town Hall on 9 May, Chipp received a standing ovation from over 3,000 people, including former Prime Minister [[John Gorton]], and decided to commit himself to leading the new party which was already being constructed by a national steering committee.&lt;ref name=thirdman/&gt;{{rp|p186}} The name &quot;Australian Democrats&quot;, already in informal currency,&lt;ref&gt;Hewat T &amp; Wilson D ''Don Chipp'' (1978) p. 84: &quot;[In mid-June 1977] the party ... was still without a formal name but operating as the Australian Democrats.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; was confirmed by the membership, being the most favoured of 56 alternative names on the postal ballot paper.&lt;ref name=thirdman/&gt;{{rp|p188}}

The first Australian Democrats (AD) federal parliamentarian was Senator [[Janine Haines]] who filled [[Steele Hall|Steele Hall's]] casual Senate vacancy for South Australia in 1977. Surprisingly, she was not a candidate when the party contested the [[Australian federal election, 1977|1977 federal elections]] after Don Chipp had agreed to be leader and figurehead. Members and candidates were not lacking in electoral experience, since the Australia Party had been contesting all federal elections since [[Australian federal election, 1969|1969]] and the [[Liberal Movement (Australia)|Liberal Movement]], in [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974]] and [[Australian federal election, 1975|1975]]. The party's broad aim was to achieve a [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in one or more parliaments and to exercise it responsibly in line with policies determined by membership.

The grassroot support attracted by Chipp's leadership was measurable at the party's first electoral test at the [[Australian federal election, 1977|1977 federal election]] on 10 December, when 9.38 per cent of the total Lower House vote was polled and 11.13 per cent of the Senate vote. At that time, with five Senate seats being contested in each state, the required [[Droop quota|quota]] was a daunting 16.66 per cent. However, the first 6-year-term seats were won by Don Chipp (Vic) and [[Colin Mason]] (NSW).

===1980–82===
At a Melbourne media conference in 1980, Chipp described his party's aim as to &quot;keep the bastards honest&quot;--the &quot;bastards&quot; being the major parties and/or politicians in general. This became a long-lived slogan for the Democrats.

The Australian Democrats' first national conference, on 16–17 February 1980, was opened by the distinguished nuclear physicist and former governor of South Australia, Sir [[Mark Oliphant]], who said: &lt;blockquote&gt;''I was privileged to be in the chair at the public meeting in Melbourne when [Don Chipp] announced formation of a new party, dedicated to preserve what freedoms we still retain, and to increase them. A party in which dictatorship from the top was replaced by consensus. A party not ordered about by big business and the rich, or by union bosses. A party where a man could retain freedom of conscience and not thereby be faced with expulsion. A party to which the intelligent individual could belong without having to subscribe to a dogmatic creed. In other words, a democratic party.&lt;ref&gt;1980 Conference Proceedings, ''Beyond our Expectations''&lt;/ref&gt;'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;
At the [[Australian federal election, 1980|October 1980 election]], the Democrats polled 9.25 per cent of the Senate vote, electing [[Janine Haines]] (SA) and two new senators [[Michael Macklin]] (Qld) and [[John Siddons]] (Vic), bringing the party's strength to five Senate seats from 1 July 1981 .

A South Australian by-election in the state seat of [[Electoral district of Mitcham (South Australia)|Mitcham]] (now [[Electoral district of Waite|Waite]]) in 1982 saw [[Heather Southcott]] retain the seat for the Democrats from [[Robin Millhouse]] since 1955 (Democrat since 1977), however it was lost later that year at the [[South Australian state election, 1982|1982 state election]]. Mitcham was the only single-member lower house seat anywhere in Australia to be won by the Democrats.

===1987–90===

It had been expected that the Democrats would find it difficult to win seats at the next Senate election due in 1987. However, their task was assisted by the calling of a [[double dissolution]] election by Prime Minister, [[Bob Hawke]]. This reduced the quota necessary to win a seat to 7.7%. In NSW (Paul McLean), Victoria (Janet Powell) and South Australia (Janine Haines), 6 year terms were won. In South Australia, a second senator (John Coulter) was elected to 3 year term, and short terms were also won Michael Macklin in Queensland and Jean Jenkins in Western Australia.

===1990–91===
&lt;!--Pic of Janine Haines lifted because it lacks orig creator's permission--&gt;
:''See [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ApT9ZZs5vM 'Give a Damn: Vote Democrat 1'] campaign commercial''
1990 saw the courageous voluntary departure from the Senate of [[Janine Haines]] (a step with which not all Democrats agreed) and the narrow failure of her strategic goal of winning the House of Representatives known as the seat of [[Division of Kingston|Kingston]].

Her casual vacancy was filled by [[Meg Lees]] several months before the arrival of [[Cheryl Kernot]], elected to replace the retiring deputy leader [[Michael Macklin]]. The ambitious Kernot immediately contested the Senate leadership. Being unemployed at the time, she requested and obtained party funds to pay for her travel to address members in all seven divisions.&lt;ref&gt;AD ''National Journal'' June 1990, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, Victorian [[Janet Powell]] was elected as leader and [[John Coulter (politician)|John Coulter]] was chosen as deputy leader.

Despite the loss of Haines and the WA Senate seat (through an inconsistent national preference agreement with the ALP), the 1990 federal election heralded something of a rebirth for the party, with a dramatic rise in primary vote. This was at the same time as an economic [[recession]] was building, and events such as the [[Gulf War]] in Kuwait were beginning to shepherd issues of globalisation and transnational trade on to national government agendas.

Virtually alone on the Australian political landscape, Janet Powell consistently attacked both the government and opposition which had closed ranks in support of the Gulf War. Whereas the House of Representatives was thus able to avoid any debate about the war and Australia's participation,&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;The sole independent member in the House, [[Ted Mack (politician)|Ted Mack]], was unable to launch his critical motion for lack of a seconder.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/view_document.aspx?ID=377294&amp;TABLE=HANSARDR |title=Ted Mack's speech on Gulf War |publisher=Parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Democrats took full advantage of the opportunity to move for a debate in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/view_document.aspx?ID=393706&amp;TABLE=HANSARDS |title=',Senate Hansard',, 21&amp;nbsp;Jan 1991 |publisher=Parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly because of the party's opposition to the Gulf War, there was mass-media antipathy and negative publicity which some construed as poor performance by Janet Powell. She was criticised for the party's standing appearing stalled at about 10%, which in light of future performance can now be seen as highly creditable.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Before 12 months of her leadership had passed, the South Australian and Queensland divisions were circulating the party's first-ever petition to criticise and oust the parliamentary leader. The explicit grounds related to Powell's alleged responsibility for poor AD ratings in Gallup and other media surveys of potential voting support. When this charge was deemed insufficient, interested party officers and senators reinforced it with negative [[News leak|media 'leaks']] concerning her openly established relationship with [[Sid Spindler]] and exposure of administrative failings resulting in excessive overtime to a staff member. With National Executive blessing, the party room pre-empted the ballot by replacing the leader with deputy [[John Coulter (politician)|John Coulter]]. In the process, severe internal divisions were generated. One major collateral casualty was the party whip [[Paul McLean (Australian politician)|Paul McLean]] who resigned and quit the Senate in disgust at what he perceived as in-fighting between close friends. The casual NSW vacancy created by his resignation was filled by [[Karin Sowada]]. Powell duly left the party, along with many leading figures of the Victorian branch of the party, and unsuccessfully stood as an Independent candidate when her term expired. In later years, she campaigned for the Australian Greens.

==Policy==
The party's original support base consisted of voters alienated by perceived unproductive adversarial conflict between the two mainstream parties and an emerging new constituency of people with a desire to participate more effectively in government and to promote concerns for [[environmental protection]] and [[social justice]]. The party aimed to combine liberal social policies with centrist, particularly neo-[[Keynesian economics]] and a progressive environmental platform.

The original agenda included [[economic interventionism|interventionist economic]] policies, commitment to [[environmentalism|environmental]] causes, support for [[wiktionary:reconciliation|reconciliation]] with Australia's [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous population]] through such mechanisms as formal treaties, [[pacifism|pacifist]] approaches to international relations, open government, constitutional reform, progressive approaches to social issues such as sexuality and drugs, and strong support for [[human rights]] and civil liberties. Its membership largely comprised [[tertiary education|tertiary-educated]] and [[middle class|middle-class]] constituents. The party also appealed to voters opposed to untrammelled government power and wishing to have alternative views aired in parliaments and media.

The party has a platform of [[participatory democracy]], with policies supporting [[proportional representation]] and [[citizen initiated referendum|citizen-initiated referenda]]. Many important internal issues (such as electoral preselection and leadership) are decided by direct postal ballot of the membership. Although policies are theoretically set in a similar fashion, Australian Democrats parliamentarians generally had extensive freedom in interpreting them.

However, by 1980, the Australian Democrats had employed the postal-ballot method at both national at state levels to develop an extensive body of written policy covering not only the political agendas of the day but also innovative and far-sighted policies for environmental and economic sustainability, water and energy conservation, e.g., through development of alternative energy sources, expanded public transport, etc. To the community's growing concerns about human rights, the Australian Democrats added finely detailed policies on animal welfare and species preservation. The material is available in election manifestos and copies of the party's journals, obtainable in major public libraries.

In 2009, as part of the Rebuild process, the party announced a comprehensive review of all policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democrats.org.au/policies/ |title=Australian Democrats : Policies Of The Australian Democrats |publisher=Democrats.org.au |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral fortunes==
{{Original research|section|date=November 2007}}
The Australian Democrats' electoral fortunes have fluctuated throughout their history.

During the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating|Keating]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Governments (1983–96), the Australian Democrats held a theoretical balance of power in the Senate: the numbers were such that they could team with Labor to pass legislation, or team with the Coalition to block legislation on occasions when the Coalition decided to oppose a government bill.

Their power was weakened in 1996 after the [[Howard Government]] was elected, and a Labor senator, [[Mal Colston]], resigned from the Labor party. This meant that the Australian Democrats now shared the parliamentary balance of power with two Independent senators. As a result, the Coalition government could often bypass the Australian Democrats, and pass legislation by negotiating with Colston and [[Brian Harradine]]. Following [[Australian federal election, 1998|the 1998 election]] the Australian Democrats again held the balance of power, until the Coalition gained a Senate majority at [[Australian federal election, 2004|the 2004 election]].

The Hawke and Keating governments pursued economic policies that drew on [[economic rationalism|economic rationalist]] and [[neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] thought, and the Australian Democrats positioned themselves to the left of the ALP government, and thus at the left end of mainstream Australian politics. Their appeal (and focus on issues beyond the usual &quot;economic&quot; ones that monopolised major party attention) was always greatest amongst tertiary-educated voters. However, the party's progressive politics also remained attractive to a sizeable section of mainly middle class (&quot;wet&quot;) [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] supporters – often female, and often disparagingly described on the right of the Liberal Party as &quot;Soccer Mums&quot;  or &quot;Doctor's Wives&quot; – who were turned off by the Liberal party's social conservatism and &quot;Reagonomic/Thatcherite&quot; economic policies. Many Liberals saw their support of the Australian Democrats in the Senate as having &quot;an each way bet&quot;, ameliorating the effect of their support for the Liberals in the House of Representatives – an attitude positively fostered, not unsurprisingly, by Democrat politicians and campaigners.

Cheryl Kernot became leader in 1993. She had strong media appeal, which increased media and public awareness of herself and the party. She was known to have interests in industrial relations and was able to cultivate solid relationships with Labor government frontbenchers, which also added to her credibility in the press gallery.

Lack of clear direction other than, possibly, senators' common ambition to play a more productive role in government manifested itself in tensions over Cheryl Kernot's policy on [[industrial relations]] (see the [[Workplace Relations Act 1996]]). Under Kernot, after negotiations and some compromises from the government, the Australian Democrats voted for the Howard Government's right-leaning industrial relations legislation which decreased union power and allowed a larger role for individual employer-employee contracts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

[[Image:Natasha-Stott-Despoja.jpg|thumb|right|[[Natasha Stott Despoja]]]]

Kernot, however, remained broadly opposed to the Liberal government. This, together with her personal ambition for a role in government,{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} led her to defect to the ALP in 1997. In the [[Australian federal election, 1998|1998 federal election]], the Democrats' candidate [[John Schumann]] came within 3 per cent of taking Liberal Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]]'s seat of [[Division of Mayo|Mayo]] in the Adelaide Hills under Australia's [[preferential voting]] system.

Internal conflict and leadership tensions from 2000 to 2002, blamed on the party's support for the Government's [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST), was damaging to the Democrats.

In 1998 the Australian Democrats campaigned on supporting taxation reform and a modified GST platform, opposing the GST on food and books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;adv=;db=;group=;holdingType=;id=;orderBy=alphaAss;page=;query=%28Dataset%3Apartypol,lcatalog,jrnart,jrnart88%20SearchCategory_Phrase%3A%22library%22%29%20Speech_Phrase%3A%22yes%22%20Dataset_Phrase%3A%22partypol%22;querytype=;rec=3;resCount= |title=Australian Democrats Campaign Launch Speech 1998 |publisher=Parlinfo.aph.gov.au |date=20 September 1998 |accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, after negotiations with Prime Minister [[John Howard|Howard]], [[Meg Lees]] and [[Andrew Murray]] agreed to support the A New Tax System (ANTS) legislation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov.au/contentitem.asp?ContentID=167&amp;NavID= |title=Australian Treasury: Tax Reform: Not a New Tax, A New Tax System |publisher=Treasury.gov.au |date=1 August 1998 |accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with exemptions from GST for most food and some medicines, as well as many environmental and social concessions.&lt;ref&gt;Senator Meg Lees’s address to the Australian Democrats’ National Conference, Brisbane, 20 January 2001 [http://australianpolitics.com/parties/democrats/01-01-20lees-speech.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Five Australian Democrats senators voted in favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|first=Alexandra|last= Kirk|title=Democrats make good on GST compromise deal|date=19 June 1999|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s31775.htm|work=ABC PM, Radio National}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, two dissident senators on the party's left [[Natasha Stott Despoja]] and [[Andrew Bartlett]] voted against the GST.&lt;ref&gt;ABC TV: 7.30 Report: 7/6/1999: [&quot;GST deal sparks Democrat crisis&quot; http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s28235.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe, John. &quot;Lees has no regrets Democrats gave their support&quot; ''[[Australian Financial Review]]'' 30 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a leadership spill saw [[Meg Lees]] replaced as leader&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Coorey &quot;Democrats in Denial&quot; in David Solomon (ed) &quot;Howard's Race – Winning the Unwinnable Election, Harper Collins, 2002, p42-44&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Natasha Stott Despoja]] after a very public and bitter leadership battle.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Rogers, &quot;The Natasha Factor,&quot; Lothian Books, 2004, pp29ff&lt;/ref&gt; Despite criticism of Stott Despoja's youth and lack of experience, the 2001 election saw the Democrats receive similar media coverage to the previous election.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Coorey &quot;Democrats Opt for Leadership&quot; in David Solomon (ed) &quot;Howard's Race – Winning the Unwinnable Election, Harper Collins, 2002, p180&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the internal divisions, the Australian Democrats' election result in 2001 was quite good. However, it was not enough to prevent the loss of [[Vicki Bourne]]'s Senate seat in NSW.

Ongoing tensions between Stott Despoja and Lees led to Stott Despoja standing down from the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2002/s655339.htm Stott Despoja resigns as Democrats leader], ABC 7.30 Report, 21 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt; It led to a protracted leadership battle in 2002, which eventually led to the election of Senator Andrew Bartlett as leader. However, the tension led to [[Meg Lees]] leaving the party in 2002, becoming an independent and forming the [[Australian Progressive Alliance]].

On 6 December 2003, Andrew Bartlett stepped aside temporarily as leader of the party, after an incident in which he assaulted [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] Senator [[Jeannie Ferris]] on the floor of [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] while intoxicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/06/1070625583872.html |title=Disgraced leader steps aside |work=The Age |location=Australia |date= 7 December 2003 |accessdate=3 April 2007 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party issued a statement stating that Deputy Leader [[Lyn Allison]] would serve as the Acting Leader of the party. Bartlett apologised to the Democrats, Jeannie Ferris and the Australian public for his behaviour and assured all concerned that it would never happen again. On 29 January 2004, after seeking medical treatment, Bartlett returned to the Australian Democrats leadership, vowing to abstain from alcohol.

===2004===
[[Image:LynAllison.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lyn Allison]]]]
Support for the Australian Democrats fell significantly at the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]] in which they achieved only 1.24 per cent of the national vote. Nowhere was this more noticeable than in their key support base of suburban [[Adelaide]] in South Australia, where they received between 7 and 31 per cent of the Lower House vote in 2001, and between 1 and 4 per cent in 2004. Three incumbent senators were defeated—[[Aden Ridgeway]] (NSW), [[Brian Greig]] (WA) and [[John Cherry (Australian politician)|John Cherry]] (Qld). Following the loss, the customary post-election leadership ballot installed Lyn Allison as leader and Andrew Bartlett as her deputy.

From 1 July 2005 the Australian Democrats lost official parliamentary party status, being represented by only four senators while the governing Liberal-National Coalition gained a majority and potential control of the Senate—the first time this advantage had been enjoyed by any government since 1980.

===2006===
On 5 January 2006, the ABC reported that the [[Tasmanian Electoral Commission]] had de-registered that division of the party for failing to provide a list containing the required number of members to be registered for Tasmanian state and local elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/items/200601/1542299.htm?tasmania |title=Australian Democrats Deregistered in Tasmania, ',ABC News',, 5&amp;nbsp;January 2006 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation  |date=5 January 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2006, at the [[South Australian legislative election, 2006|2006 South Australian state election]], the Australian Democrats were reduced to 1.7 per cent of the Legislative Council (upper house) vote. Their sole councillor up for re-election, [[Kate Reynolds]], was defeated.

After the election, South Australian senator [[Natasha Stott Despoja]] denied rumours that she was considering quitting the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2006/s1598147.htm |title=Stott-Despoja denies rumours she is quitting, ',ABC News',, 22&amp;nbsp;March 2006 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation  |date=22 March 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early July, Richard Pascoe, national and [[South Australian]] party president, resigned, citing slumping opinion polls and the poor result in the 2006 South Australian election as well as South Australian parliamentary leader [[Sandra Kanck]]'s comments regarding the drug [[MDMA]] which he saw as damaging to the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200607/s1683245.htm |title=Political analyst predicts Democrats' demise, ',ABC News', 11&amp;nbsp;July 2006 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation  |date=11 July 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200607/s1683993.htm |title=Former leader sees Democrats in 'tatters', ',ABC News', 11&amp;nbsp;July 2006 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation  |date=11 July 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theadvertiser.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5936,19698296%255E910,00.html Kanck says rave party safer than the front bar, ''The Advertiser'' 5 July 2006] Article no longer available online.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July 2006, Australian Democrats senator for Western Australia [[Andrew Murray (politician)|Andrew Murray]] announced his intention not to contest the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]], citing frustration arising from the Howard Government's control of both houses and his unwillingness to serve another six-year term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/no-life-in-dons-party/2006/07/07/1152240493865.html |title=',Sydney Morning Herald', 8&amp;nbsp;July 2006 |work=Sydney Morning Herald  |date= 8 July 2006|accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His term ended on 30 June 2008.

On 28 August 2006, the founder of the Australian Democrats, [[Don Chipp]], died. Former prime minister Bob Hawke said: &quot;... there is a coincidental timing almost between the passing of Don Chipp and what I think is the death throes of the Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200608/s1727334.htm |title=Hawke predicts end is near for Democrats, ',ABC News', 29&amp;nbsp;August 2006 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation  |date=29 August 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;

On 22 October 2006, Australian Democrats Senator [[Natasha Stott Despoja]] announced her intention not to seek re-election at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]] due to health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200610/s1770646.htm |title=Stott-Despoja to bow out of politics, ',ABC News', 22&amp;nbsp;October 2006 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation  |date=22 October 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her term ended on 30 June 2008.

In November 2006, the Australian Democrats fared very poorly in the Victorian state election, receiving a Legislative Council vote tally of only 0.83%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vec.vic.gov.au/state2006resultbypartyUH.html |title=Victorian Electoral Commission: Results for Upper House, 2006 |publisher=Vec.vic.gov.au |date=1 January 1999 |accessdate=25 April 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; less than half of the party's result in 2002 (1.79 per cent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vec.vic.gov.au/state2002resultbypartyprovince.html |title=Victorian Electoral Commission: Results for Upper House, 2006 |publisher=Vec.vic.gov.au |date=1 January 1999 |accessdate=25 April 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007===
In the New South Wales state election of March 2007, the Australian Democrats lost their last remaining NSW Upper House representative, [[Arthur Chesterfield-Evans]]. The party fared poorly, gaining only 1.8 per cent of the Legislative Council vote. A higher vote was achieved in some of the Legislative Assembly seats selectively contested as compared to 2003. However, the statewide vote share fell because the party was unable to field as many candidates as in 2003.

In the Victorian state by-election in Albert Park District&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vec.vic.gov.au/stateby2007resultAlbertParkDistrict.html |title=VEC: Albert Park District By-Election 2007 |publisher=Vec.vic.gov.au |date=1 January 1999 |accessdate=25 April 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Australian Democrats stood candidate Paul Kavanagh, who polled a respectable 5.75 per cent of the primary vote, despite a large number of candidates, and all media attention focusing on the battle between Labor and Greens candidates.

On 13 September 2007, the ACT Democrats (Australian Capital Territory Division of the party) was deregistered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/ni/2007-279/default.asp |title=ACT legislation register – Electoral (Cancellation of the Registration of the Australian Democrats) Notice 2007 – main page |publisher=Legislation.act.gov.au |date=13 September 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the ACT Electoral Commissioner, being unable to demonstrate a minimum membership of 100 electors.

As was widely expected, the Democrats had no success at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]]. Two incumbent senators, Lyn Allison (Victoria) and Andrew Bartlett (Queensland), were defeated, their seats both reverting to major parties. Their two remaining colleagues, Andrew Murray (WA) and Natasha Stott Despoja (SA), did not run for new terms. All four senators' terms expired on 30 June 2008—leaving the Australian Democrats with no federal representation for the first time since its founding in 1977. An ABC report noted that &quot;on the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) website the party is now referred to just as 'other'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell A ''[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/11/26/2101885.htm?site=elections/federal/2007 Democrats to lose parliamentary representation]'' 26 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===
The party achieved only 1.24% of the vote at the federal [[Mayo by-election, 2008|2008 Mayo by-election]] in South Australia. At the [[Australian Capital Territory general election, 2008]], the party's ungrouped candidates&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/07/25/2314905.htm Democrats candidates unveiled] ABC News, 25 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; obtained 0.3% of the vote for Ginninderra&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.act.gov.au/elections/2008/ginninderra_08.html Results for Ginninderra Electorate] at Elections ACT&lt;/ref&gt; (Darren Churchill) and 0.2% in Molonglo&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.act.gov.au/elections/2008/molonglo_08.html Results for Molonglo Electorate] at Elections ACT&lt;/ref&gt; (Greg Tannahill).

===2009===

In July 2009, the party's sole remaining parliamentarian, [[David Winderlich]], announced he would leave the party and sit as an independent unless the South Australian Democrats could recruit 1,000 new members by November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/07/20/2631292.htm Democrats MP divides party with 1,000-member ultimatum]''&lt;/ref&gt; When this clearly could not eventuate, he resigned from the party on 7 October 2009, continued to sit as an independent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,26177316-2682,00.html?from=public_rss |title=David Winderlich quits, Democrats are no more |publisher=News.com.au |date=7 October 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2010 | first1=Russell | last1=Emmerson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was defeated at the [[South Australian state election, 2010|2010 election]].

David Collyer contested the [[Higgins by-election, 2009|2009 Higgins by-election]] and received 2.3 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://results.aec.gov.au/14358/Website/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-14358-215.htm Virtual Tally Room, Higgins 2009 by election] at Australian Electoral Commission, 23 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010===
The South Australian Democrats contested the [[South Australian state election, 2010|state election]] on 20 March 2010. The lead Legislative Council candidate was animal rights activist and former independent, Jeanie Walker&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/sa/content/2005/s1473356.htm Stateline interview] ABC TV, 30 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; with supporting candidates Tom Salerno and Sandra Kanck&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/in-depth/former-democrats-mp-sandra-kanck-wants-to-return-to-sa-state-parliament/story-fn2sdwup-1225831769319 Former Democrats MP Sandra Kanck wants to return to SA State Parliament] Adelaide Sunday Mail (AdelaideNow) 18 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They attracted 0.9% of the total primary vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecsa.sa.gov.au/election2010/results/legislative.htm 2010 results for Legislative Coucil] at Electoral Commission SA&lt;/ref&gt; However, on preferences, Jeanie Walker survived until the 35th round of counting, losing to micro-party Dignity for Disability's Kelly Vincent who was elected in the 43rd round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2010/guide/lc-results.htm Legislative Council count] at ABC News 2010 South Australian Election coverage&lt;/ref&gt; Eight House of Assembly seats were also contested, averaging 2.24 per cent of the vote in those seats.

At the 2010 federal election, Democrat candidates again failed to secure any seats in the Senate. They polled very poorly, achieving only 0.5%–0.75% of vote in the states and 1.6% of the vote in the ACT.

==Support==
Support for the Democrats historically tended to fluctuate between about 5 and 10 per cent of the population and was geographically concentrated around the wealthy dense [[Central Business District|CBD and inner-suburban neighbourhoods]] of the [[Australian capital cities|capital cities]] (especially [[Adelaide, Australia|Adelaide]]). Therefore, they never managed to win a [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] seat. During the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s they typically held one or two [[Australian Senate|Senate]] seats in each state, as well as having some representatives in state parliaments and local councils.

Following the internal conflict over [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST]] (1998–2001) and resultant leadership changes, a dramatic decline occurred in the Democrats' membership and voting support in all states. Simultaneously, an increase was recorded in support for the [[Australian Greens]] who, by 2004, were supplanting the Democrats as a substantial [[third party (politics)|third party]]. The trend was noted that year by political scientists Dean Jaensch et al.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;the Australian Democrats appear to be in decline, having performed very poorly at the 2004 federal election and look to be replaced by the Greens as the major ‘minor’ party&quot;. --Jaensch D et al. ''[http://democratic.audit.anu.edu.au/papers/focussed_audits/200501_jaensch_parties.pdf Australian Political Parties in the Spotlight]'' pp 40–41. Australian National University, January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, Jaensch later suggested it was possible the Democrats could make a political comeback in the federal arena.&lt;ref&gt;Dean Jaensch radio interview, http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2008/s2631202.htm, accessed 28/7/09&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Tony Abbott]]'s displacement of [[Malcolm Turnbull]] as federal leader of the Liberal Party in 2009, the Democrats sought to attract the support of &quot;those Liberals who no longer feel they can support their party''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democrats.org.au/news/index.htm?press_id=6655&amp;display=1 Media release] dated 12 December 2009, on official party site&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
[[Image:HainesChipp.jpg|thumb|[[Janine Haines]] and Chipp in 1977]]
Of the party's nine elected federal parliamentary leaders, six were women. Aboriginal senator [[Aden Ridgeway]] was deputy leader under Natasha Stott Despoja.

The '''Australian Capital Territory''', often abbreviated '''ACT''', is the [[Capital districts and territories|capital territory]] of the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]] and is the smallest [[States and territories of Australia|self-governing internal territory]]. It is [[Enclave and exclave|enclaved]] within [[New South Wales]] and is regularly referred to as Australia's '[[The Bush|Bush Capital]]'.

The need for a National Territory was flagged by colonial delegates during the [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] conventions of the late 19th century. Section 125 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] provided that following Federation in 1901, land would be ceded freely to the new [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]]. The territory was transferred to the Commonwealth by the state of [[New South Wales]] in 1911, two years prior to the naming of [[Canberra]] as the National Capital in 1913. The [[List of Australian floral emblems|floral emblem]] of the ACT is the [[Wahlenbergia gloriosa|Royal Bluebell]] and the faunal emblem is the [[Gang-gang Cockatoo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bluebell&quot;&gt;

==Geography==
[[Image:ACT-Jervis Bay-Sydney-MJC.png|left|thumb|125px|Location of the ACT and Jervis Bay]]
The ACT is bounded by the [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]]-[[Cooma, New South Wales|Cooma]] railway line in the east, the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] of [[Naas (valley)|Naas Creek]] in the south, the watershed of the [[Cotter River]] in the west, and the watershed of the [[Molonglo River]] in the north-east. The ACT also has a small strip of territory around the southern end of the [[Beecroft Peninsula]], which is the northern headland of [[Jervis Bay Territory|Jervis Bay]].&lt;ref&gt; While the bulk of this land was established as a separate [[Jervis Bay Territory]] when the Australian Capital Territory was granted self-government, it is not widely known that the portion on the [[Beecroft Peninsula]] remains part of the ACT. This is probably because the area has no permanent residents, being reserved as a live firing range for the Royal Australian Navy. However, retention of this strip of coastline ensures ongoing compliance with the legal requirement, as set out in section 4 of the Seat of Government Act 1908, that the ACT &quot;shall ... have access to the sea&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The area of ACT land on the Beecroft Peninsula is clearly shown in the ''New South Wales Roads Directory'' (Map 177, grid ref. S 2), which is published by the National Roads and Motoring Association and is based on NSW Department of Lands maps. Several maps showing the boundaries of the ACT exclave on the Beecroft Peninsula are available online, for example: [http://www.exploroz.com/Places/24482/NSW/Longnose_Point.aspx exploroz.com]&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=March 2011}}

Apart from the city of Canberra, the Australian Capital Territory also contains agricultural land ([[domestic sheep|sheep]], [[dairy cattle]], [[vineyard]]s and small amounts of crops) and a large area of national park ([[Namadgi National Park]]), much of it mountainous and forested. Small townships and communities located within the ACT include [[Williamsdale, Australian Capital Territory|Williamsdale]], [[Naas (valley)|Naas]], [[Uriarra, Australian Capital Territory|Uriarra]], [[Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory|Tharwa]] and [[Hall, Australian Capital Territory|Hall]].

Tidbinbilla is a locality to the south-west of Canberra that features the [[Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve]] and the [[Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex]], operated by the United States' [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) as part of its [[Deep Space Network]].

There are a large range of mountains, rivers and creeks in the Namadgi National Park. These include the Naas and Murrumbidgee Rivers.

===Climate===
Because of its elevation  {{convert|650|m|ft}} and distance from the coast, the Australian Capital Territory experiences four distinct seasons, unlike many other Australian cities whose climates are moderated by the sea. Canberra is notorious for hot, dry summers, and cold winters with occasional [[fog]] and frequent [[frost]]s. Many of the higher mountains in the territory's south-west are snow-covered for at least part of the winter. [[Thunderstorm]]s can occur between October and March, and annual rainfall is 623&amp;nbsp;millimetres (24.5&amp;nbsp;in), with rainfall highest in spring and summer and lowest in winter.

The highest maximum temperature recorded in the ACT was 42.8&amp;nbsp;°C (109.0&amp;nbsp;°F) at [[Acton, Australian Capital Territory|Acton]] on 11 January 1939. The lowest minimum temperature was −14.6&amp;nbsp;°C (5.7&amp;nbsp;°F) at [[Gudgenby, Australian Capital Territory|Gudgenby]] on 11 July 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], [http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/b5186097bad6b76cca256b3400819cd1 2002 Yearbook of Australia], retrieved 22 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geology===
{{main|Geology of the Australian Capital Territory}}
Notable geological formations in the Australian Capital Territory include the ''Canberra Formation'', the ''Pittman Formation'', ''Black Mountain Sandstone'' and ''State Circle Shale''.

In the 1840s [[fossil]]s of [[brachiopod]]s and [[trilobite]]s from the [[Silurian]] period were discovered at Woolshed Creek near [[Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory|Duntroon]]. At the time, these were the oldest fossils discovered in Australia, though this record has now been far surpassed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.act.gov.au/Files/heritageregister20010.pdf ACT Heritage Register — Woolshed Creek Fossil Site]&lt;/ref&gt; Other specific geological places of interest include the State Circle cutting and the Deakin anticline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AHD|105733|State Circle Cutting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.act.nationaltrust.org.au/places/deak-anti.html National Trust of Australia — Deakin Anticline]&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest rocks in the ACT date from the [[Ordovician]] around 480 million years ago. During this period the region along with most of Eastern Australia was part of the ocean floor; formations from this period include the ''Black Mountain Sandstone'' formation and the ''Pittman Formation'' consisting largely of [[quartz]]-rich [[sandstone]], [[siltstone]] and [[shale]]. These formations became exposed when the ocean floor was raised by a major [[orogeny|volcanic activity]] in the [[Devonian]] forming much of the east coast of Australia.

==Governance==
{{see also|Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly}}
[[File:Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly.jpg|thumb|The ACT Legislative Assembly building]]
The ACT has internal self-government, but [[Constitution of Australia|Australia's Constitution]] does not afford the territory government the full legislative independence provided to Australian states. Laws are made in a 17-member [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] that has all state and local government functions. However, its decisions can be overruled by the Australian [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] (effectively by the national government) under section 35 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988. (See also [[Electoral systems of the Australian states and territories]]). Members of the Legislative Assembly are elected via the [[Single transferable vote|Hare Clarke]] system. The ACT Chief Minister (currently [[Katy Gallagher]], [[Australian Labor Party]]) is elected by members of the ACT Assembly. The ACT Government is a member of the [[Council of Australian Governments]].

Unlike other self-governing Australian territories (e.g. [[Norfolk Island]], [[Northern Territory]]), the ACT does not have an Administrator. The Crown is represented by the Governor-General in the government of the ACT. The Chief Minister performs many of the roles that a state governor normally holds in the context of a state, however the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly gazettes the laws and summons meetings of the Assembly. 

In Australia's [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]], the ACT is represented by four federal members: two members of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]; the [[Division of Fraser]] and the [[Division of Canberra]] and is one of only two territories to be represented in the Senate, with two [[Australian Senate|Senators]] (the other being the Northern Territory). The Member for Fraser and the ACT Senators also represent the constituents of the [[Jervis Bay Territory]].

In 1915 the ''[[Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915]]'' created the [[Jervis Bay Territory]] as an annexe to the Australian Capital Territory. In 1988, when the ACT gained self-government, Jervis Bay became a separate territory administered by the Australian Government Minister responsible for Territories, presently the [[Minister for Home Affairs (Australia)]].

The ACT retains a small area of territory on the coast on the [[Beecroft Peninsula]], consisting of a strip of coastline around the northern headland of Jervis Bay (not to be confused with the Jervis Bay Territory, which is on the southern headland of the Bay). The ACT's land on the Beecroft Peninsula is an [[Exclave|&quot;exclave&quot;]], that is, an area of territory not physically connected to the main part of the ACT. Interestingly, this ACT exclave surrounds a small exclave of NSW territory, namely the [[Point Perpendicular]] lighthouse which is at the southern tip of the Beecroft Peninsula. The lighthouse and its grounds are New South Wales territory, but cut off from the rest of the state by the strip of ACT land. This is a geographic curiosity: an exclave of NSW land enclosed by an exclave of ACT land.&lt;ref&gt;Although ACT lands on the Beecroft Peninsula are shown on official and other detailed maps of the area, it is not widely known that this area forms part of the ACT. This is probably because the area has no permanent residents, being reserved as a live firing range for the Royal Australian Navy. However, retention of this strip of coastline ensures ongoing compliance with the legal requirement, as set out in section 4 of the ''Seat of Government Act 1908'', that the ACT &quot;shall ... have access to the sea&quot;. The Point Perpendicular lighthouse, at the very tip of the Peninsula, is a small exclave of NSW territory cut off from the main part of NSW by the ACT land. A good online GIS map showing the Beecroft Peninsula, and those areas which are part of the ACT, can be found at the website of the Shire of Shoalhaven, the adjacent NSW municipality. This is the URL (NSW lands shown in yellow, ACT and JBT lands shown in pink): [http://gis.shoalhaven.nsw.gov.au/maps/ gis.shoalhaven.nsw.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
{{See also|Demographics of Australia}}

In the 2006 census the population of the ACT was 333,667, of which only 869 were outside Canberra. The ACT median weekly income for people aged over 15 was in the range $600–$699 while the population living outside Canberra was at the national average of $400–$499. The average level of degree qualification in the ACT is higher than the national average. Within the ACT 4.5% of the population have a postgraduate degree compared to 1.8% across the whole of Australia.

===Urban Structure===
{{Main|Suburbs of Canberra}}

[[File:ANU School of Art.jpg|right|thumb|[[Australian National University|ANU]] school of art, originally built as [[Canberra High School]]]]

Canberra is a [[New town|planned city]] that was originally designed by [[Walter Burley Griffin]], a major 20th century American architect.&lt;ref&gt;Wigmore, pp. 60–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Major roads follow a wheel-and-spoke pattern rather than a grid.&lt;ref name=&quot;w67&quot;&gt;Wigmore, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The city centre is laid out on two perpendicular axes: a water axis stretching along [[Lake Burley Griffin]], and a ceremonial land axis stretching from Parliament House on [[Capital Hill, Australian Capital Territory|Capital Hill]] north-eastward along [[ANZAC Parade, Canberra|ANZAC Parade]] to the [[Australian War Memorial]] at the foot of [[Mount Ainslie, Australian Capital Territory|Mount Ainslie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;w64&quot;&gt;Wigmore, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The area known as the [[Parliamentary Triangle, Canberra|Parliamentary Triangle]] is formed by three of Burley Griffin's axes, stretching from Capital Hill along [[Commonwealth Avenue, Canberra|Commonwealth Avenue]] to the Civic Centre around City Hill, along Constitution Avenue to the Defence precinct on Russell Hill, and along Kings Avenue back to Capital Hill.&lt;ref name=&quot;w64&quot;/&gt;

The larger scheme of Canberra's layout is based on the three peaks surrounding the city, [[Mount Ainslie (Australian Capital Territory)|Mount Ainslie]], [[Black Mountain (Australian Capital Territory)|Black Mountain]], and [[Red Hill, Australian Capital Territory|Red Hill]]. The main symmetrical axis of the city is along [[ANZAC Parade, Canberra|ANZAC Parade]] and roughly&lt;ref&gt;Google Earth&lt;/ref&gt; on the line&lt;ref&gt;Wigmore, pp. 64–67.&lt;/ref&gt; between Mount Ainslie and [[Bimberi Peak]]. Bimberi Peak being the highest mountain in the ACT approximately {{convert|52|km|0|abbr=on}} south west of Canberra . The precise alignment of ANZAC parade is between Mount Ainslie and [[Capital Hill, Australian Capital Territory|Capital Hill]] (formally Kurrajong Hill). 

The [[Walter Burley Griffin|Griffins]] assigned spiritual values to Mount Ainslie, Black Mountain, and Red Hill and originally planned to cover each of these in flowers. That way each hill would be covered with a single, primary color which represented its spiritual value. This part of their plan never came to fruition. In fact, WWI interrupted the construction and some conflicts after the war made it a difficult process for the Griffins. Nevertheless, Canberra stands as an exemplary city design and is located halfway between the ski slopes and the beach. It enjoys a natural cooling from geophysical factors. 

The urban areas of Canberra are organised into a hierarchy of districts, town centres, group centres, local suburbs as well as other industrial areas and villages. There are seven districts, each of which is divided into smaller suburbs, and most of which have a town centre which is the focus of commercial and social activities. The districts were settled in the following chronological order:
* [[North Canberra]], mostly settled in the 1920s and '30s, with expansion up to the 1960s, now 14 suburbs
* [[South Canberra]], settled from the 1920s to '60s, 13 suburbs
* [[Woden Valley]], first settled in 1963, 12 suburbs
* [[Belconnen]], first settled in 1967, 25 suburbs
* [[Weston Creek]], settled in 1969, 8 suburbs
* [[Tuggeranong]], settled in 1974, 19 suburbs
* [[Gungahlin]], settled in the early 1990s, 18 suburbs although only 12 are developed or under development

The North and South Canberra districts are substantially based on Walter Burley Griffin's designs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} In 1967 the then [[National Capital Development Commission]] adopted the &quot;Y Plan&quot; which laid out future urban development in Canberra around a series of central shopping and commercial area known as the 'town centres' linked by freeways, the layout of which roughly resembled the shape of the letter Y,&lt;ref name=&quot;s1545&quot;&gt;Sparke, pp. 154–155.&lt;/ref&gt; with Tuggeranong at the base of the Y and Belconnen and Gungahlin located at the ends of the arms of the Y.&lt;ref name=&quot;s1545&quot;/&gt; 

Development in Canberra has been closely regulated by government, both through the town planning process, but also through the use of crown lease terms that have tightly limited the use of parcels of land. All land in the ACT is held on 99 year leases from the national government, although most leases are now administered by the Territory government.

Most suburbs have their own local shops, and are located close to a larger shopping centre serving a group of suburbs. Community facilities and schools are often also located near local shops or group shopping centres. Many of Canberra's [[List of Canberra suburbs|suburbs]] are named after former Prime Ministers, famous Australians, early settlers, or use Aboriginal words for their title. 

[[Street name]]s typically follow a particular theme; for example, the streets of [[Duffy, Australian Capital Territory|Duffy]] are named after Australian dams and reservoirs, the streets of [[Dunlop, Australian Capital Territory|Dunlop]] are named after Australian inventions, inventors and artists and the streets of [[Page, Australian Capital Territory|Page]] are named after biologists and naturalists. Most [[diplomatic mission]]s are located in the suburbs of [[Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory|Yarralumla]], [[Deakin, Australian Capital Territory|Deakin]] and [[O'Malley, Australian Capital Territory|O'Malley]]. There are three light industrial areas: the suburbs of [[Fyshwick, Australian Capital Territory|Fyshwick]], [[Mitchell, Australian Capital Territory|Mitchell]] and [[Hume, Australian Capital Territory|Hume]].

==Education==
{{main|Education in the Australian Capital Territory}}
Almost all educational institutions in the Australian Capital Territory are located within [[Canberra]]. The ACT public education system schooling is normally split up into [[Pre-School]], [[Primary School]] (K-6), [[High School]] (7-10) and [[College#Australia|College]] (11-12) followed by studies at [[university]] or [[TAFE]]. Many private high schools include years 11 and 12 and are referred to as colleges. Children are required to attend school until they turn 15 years old, most finish year 10 (around 16 years old).

In February 2004 there were 140 [[List of schools in the Australian Capital Territory|public and non-governmental schools]] in Canberra; 96 were operated by the Government and 44 are non-Government.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics. 2005. [http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/94713ad445ff1425ca25682000192af2/849f25e83fc56ff2ca257079007b87c6!OpenDocument Schools in the ACT]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 there were 60,275 students in the ACT school system. 59.3% of the students were enrolled in government schools with the remaining 40.7% in non-government schools. There were 30,995 students in primary school, 19,211 in high school, 9,429 in college and a further 340 in special schools.&lt;ref&gt;ACT Department of Education and Training. 2005. [http://www.decs.act.gov.au/publicat/pdf/ACT_Gov_NonGov_Enrol_1995_2005.pdf Enrolments in ACT Schools 1995 to 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2004, 30% of people in the ACT aged 15–64 had a level of educational attainment equal to at least an [[bachelor's degree]], significantly higher that the national average of 19%.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics. 2005. [http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/94713ad445ff1425ca25682000192af2/71bcf1841bfa37f9ca256f84007c28f5!OpenDocument Education in the ACT]&lt;/ref&gt; The two main tertiary institutions are the [[Australian National University]] (ANU) in [[Acton, Australian Capital Territory|Acton]] and the [[University of Canberra]] (UC) in [[Bruce, Australian Capital Territory|Bruce]]. There are also two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou is a campus of the [[Australian Catholic University]] and St Mark's Theological College is a campus of [[Charles Sturt University]]. The [[Australian International Hotel School]] offers degree and diploma level courses and operates the [[Hotel Kurrajong]] in [[Barton, Australian Capital Territory|Barton]]. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus [[Canberra Institute of Technology]].

The [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] (ADFA) and the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] (RMC) are in the suburb of [[Campbell, Australian Capital Territory|Campbell]] in Canberra's inner northeast. ADFA teaches [[military]] [[undergraduate]]s and [[Quaternary education|postgraduates]] and is officially a [[campus]] of the [[University of New South Wales]] while Duntroon provides [[Australian Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|Officer]] [[training]].

The [[Academy of Interactive Entertainment]] (AIE) offers courses in computer game development and 3D animation.

      <comment>In chasing down a citation, I found the original claim to be less than precise, so here's a more precise claim with a citation.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Red Wine Glas.jpg|thumb|upright|A large glass of red wine has about three units of alcohol. A regular glass, such as the one shown, has about two units.]]

'''Units of alcohol''' are a measure of the volume of pure [[ethanol|alcohol]] in [[alcoholic beverages]], used as a guideline in some countries.

One unit of alcohol is defined as 10 [[litre|millilitres]] in the [[United Kingdom]], and as 10 [[gram]]s (12.7&amp;nbsp;ml) in Australia. In both countries a so-called [[standard drink]] contains one unit of alcohol (according to that country's own definitions of them), though the standard drink definition varies significantly in other countries. In the United Kingdom, the number of units contained in a typical serving of an alcoholic beverage is publicised and printed on bottles.

An average healthy adult can [[Metabolism|metabolize]] three quarters of an Australian unit of alcohol in about one hour. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Standard drinks| work =| publisher = Australian Drug Foundation| date =| url =http://www.adf.org.au/policy-advocacy/standard-drinks| format =| doi =| accessdate = 2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Formulae ==
The number of units of alcohol in a drink can be determined by multiplying the volume of the drink (in millilitres) by its percentage [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]], and dividing by 1000. Thus, one [[pint]] (568 ml) of beer at 4%&amp;nbsp;ABV contains:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{568 \times 4}{1000} = 2.3\mbox{ units}&lt;/math&gt;

The formula uses the quantity in millilitres divided by 1000; this has the result of there being exactly ''one unit per percentage point per litre'' of any alcoholic beverage.

When the volume of an alcoholic drinks is shown in [[centilitre]]s, determining the number of units in a drink is as simple as multiplying volume by percentage (converted into a fraction of 1). Thus 75 centilitres of wine (the contents of a standard wine bottle) at 13 % [[ABV]] contain:

&lt;math&gt;75 \times 0.13 = 9.75\mbox{ units}&lt;/math&gt;

== Quantities ==
It is often stated that a unit of alcohol is supplied by a small glass of wine, half a pint of beer, or a single measure of spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Beers ===
*A half pint (284 ml) of [[beer]] that has a strength of 3.5% abv contains almost exactly one unit. However, most beers are stronger. In pubs, beers generally range from 4% to 5.5% abv with continental lagers starting at around 5% abv. A pint of such lager (568 ml at 5.2% for example) is almost 3 units of alcohol, rather than the often-quoted value of 2 units per pint.
*A 500 ml can/bottle of standard [[lager]] (5%) &lt;!-- generally --&gt; contains &lt;!-- around --&gt; 2.5 units.
*'Super-strength' or strong [[pale lager]] may contain as much as two units per half pint.
*One litre of typical [[Oktoberfest]] beer (5.5% to 6%) contains 5.5 to 6 units of alcohol.

=== Wines ===
*A medium glass (175 ml) of 12% abv [[wine]] contains around two units of alcohol. However, British pubs and restaurants often supply larger quantities (large glass: 250 ml) which contain 3 units. Red wine might have a higher alcohol content (on average 12.5%, sometimes up to 16%).
*A 750 ml bottle of 12% abv wine contains 9 units. Some [[port wine]]s may contain 20% abv or more, which is 15 units of alcohol per bottle.
* A 750 ml bottle of 14.5% abv wine contains 10.88 units.

=== Fortified wines ===
*A small glass (50 ml) of [[sherry]], [[fortified wine]], or cream liqueur (approx. 20% abv) contains about one unit.

=== Spirits ===
*Most [[Distilled beverage|spirits]] sold in the UK have 40% abv or slightly less. A single pub measure (about 25 ml) of such a spirit contains one unit. However, a larger single measure of 35 ml is now often sold, resulting in the consumption of 1.4 units of alcohol.

=== Alcopops ===
*Most [[alcopops]] contain 1.4 to 1.5 units per bottle. For example, a regular 275ml bottle of [[WKD Original Vodka|WKD]] contains 1.4 units,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Alcohol| work =| publisher = | date =| url = http://www.wkd.co.uk/pages/about/| format =| doi =| accessdate = 2008-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[Bacardi Breezer]] and [[Smirnoff Ice]] both contain 1.5 units of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Alcohol| work =| publisher = | date =| url = http://www.ciao.co.uk/Smirnoff_Ice__Review_5302466| format =| doi =| accessdate = 2008-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limits ==
{{Main|Recommended maximum intake of alcoholic beverages}}

Since 1995 the UK government has advised that regular consumption of 3–4 units a day for men, or 2–3 units a day for women, would not pose significant health risks, but that consistently drinking four or more units a day (men), or three or more units a day (women), is not advisable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Healthimprovement/Alcoholmisuse/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously (from 1992 until 1995), the advice was that men should drink no more than 21 units per week, and women no more than 14.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drinkaware.co.uk/facts/factsheets/health-fact-sample-2&lt;/ref&gt; (The difference between the sexes was due to the typically lower weight and water-to-body-mass ratio of women.) This was changed because a government study showed that many people were in effect &quot;saving up&quot; their units and using them at the end of the week, a phenomenon referred to as [[binge drinking]].{{Citation needed|date= October 2007}} [[The Times]] reported in October 2007 that these limits had been &quot;plucked out of the air&quot; and had no scientific basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/article2697975.ece Drink limits ‘useless’], The Times, 20 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An international study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kanis JA, Johansson H, Johnell O, ''et al.'' |title=Alcohol intake as a risk factor for fracture |journal=Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=737–42 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=15455194 |doi=10.1007/s00198-004-1734-y |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of almost 6,000 men and 11,000 women found that persons who reported that they drank more than 2 units of alcohol a day had an increased risk of fractures compared to non-drinkers.  For example, those who drank over 3 units a day had nearly twice the risk of a hip fracture.

* [[Aotus (plant)|''Aotus'' (plant)]], one of the plant genera commonly known as golden peas in the family Fabaceae (bean family).
* [[Aotus (monkey)|''Aotus'' (monkey)]], the genus of night monkeys in the family Aotidae.

The name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words for &quot;earless&quot; in both cases: the monkey is missing external [[ear]]s, and the pea is missing earlike bracteoles.

'''''Ally McBeal''''' is&lt;!-- DO NOT change the tense please! Read WP:MOSTV#Lead_paragraphs--&gt; an American [[legal drama|legal]] [[comedy-drama]] series which aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network from 1997 to 2002. The series was created by [[David E. Kelley]], who also served as the executive producer, along with [[Bill D'Elia]]. The series stars [[Calista Flockhart]] in the [[Ally McBeal (character)|title role]] as a young lawyer working in the fictional [[Boston]] [[List of fictional law firms|law firm]], Cage and Fish, with other young lawyers whose lives and loves were eccentric, humorous and dramatic.

==Overview==
The show focused on the romantic and personal lives of the main characters, often using legal proceedings as [[plot device]]s to contrast or reinforce a character's drama. For example, bitter divorce litigation of a client might provide a backdrop for Ally's decision to break up with a boyfriend. Opposing legal arguments were also frequently used to explore multiple sides of various social issues.

Cage &amp; Fish (which becomes Cage/Fish &amp; McBeal or Cage, Fish, &amp; Associates towards the end of the series), the fictional law firm where most of the characters work, is depicted as a highly sexualized environment, symbolized by its unisex public restroom. Lawyers and secretaries in the firm routinely date, flirt with, or have a romantic history with each other, and frequently run into former or potential romantic interests in the courtroom or on the street outside.

The show had many offbeat and frequently surreal running gags and themes, such as Ally's tendency to immediately fall over whenever she met somebody she found attractive, or Richard Fish's [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattle]] fetish and humorous mottos (&quot;Fishisms&quot;), ran through the series. The show used vivid, dramatic [[fantasy]] sequences for Ally's and other characters' wishful thinking; particularly notable is the [[dancing baby]].

The show also featured regular visits to a local bar where singer [[Vonda Shepard]] regularly performed (though occasionally handing over the microphone to the characters). The series also took place in the same [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] as David E. Kelley's legal drama ''[[The Practice]]'' (which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), as the two shows crossed over with one another on occasion, a very rare occurrence for two shows which aired on different networks.

==Reception==
{{Inappropriate tone|date=November 2010}}
The show's ratings began to decline in the third season, but stabilized in the fourth season after [[Robert Downey Jr.]] joined the regular cast as Ally's boyfriend Larry Paul. However, Downey's character was written out after the end of the season due to the actor's troubles with drug addiction.

The show was canceled after a significant ratings drop during its fifth season, which saw many regular characters disappear from the series without explanation (also a problem with David E. Kelley's shows ''[[Boston Public]]'', ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', ''[[The Practice]]'' and ''[[Boston Legal]]'' [to an extent]), and the novelty of the show wore off.

==Criticism==
Despite its success, ''Ally McBeal'' did receive some negative criticism from TV critics and feminists who found the title character annoying and demeaning to women (specifically professional women&lt;ref&gt;Michelle L. Hammers, &quot;Cautionary Tales of Liberation and Female Professionalism: The Case ''Against Ally McBeal''&quot; ''Western Journal of Communication'' '''69''' 2, April (2005): 168. &quot;The ease with which ''McBeal''s depictions of women are reincorporated into dominant masculinist discourses ... is particularly problematic for professional women. The increased danger that co-optation poses for professional women is due to the complex ways in which the discursive sedimentation that surrounds the female body, particularly as it has been traditionally sexualized and linked to emotionality, operates as a barrier to women's full and effective participation in professional spheres. Thus, ''McBeal'' operates as a cautionary tale about the dangers presented by the co-optation of postfeminist and third-wave feminist discourses as they relate to current professional discourses surrounding the female body.&lt;/ref&gt;) because of her perceived flightiness, lack of demonstrated legal knowledge, short skirts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/community/transcripts/chattr062598.html|title=Is Feminism Dead? (Chat Transcript – Phyllis Chesler)|publisher=Time Magazine|date=June 25, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extreme emotional instability. Perhaps the most notorious example of the debate sparked by the show was the June 25, 1998 cover story of ''Time'' magazine, which juxtaposed McBeal with three pioneering feminists ([[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Betty Friedan]], [[Gloria Steinem]]) and asked &quot;Is Feminism Dead?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/community/transcripts/chattr062598.html|title=Is Feminism Dead? (Chat Transcript)|publisher=Time Magazine|date=June 25, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In episode 12 of the second season of the show, Ally talks to her co-worker John Cage about a dream she had, saying &quot;You know, I had a dream that they put my face on the cover of ''Time'' magazine as 'the face of feminism'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdHSOF6gVwo|title=Ally McBeal, episode 12, season 2|publisher=20th Century Fox|date=August 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
''Ally McBeal'' was a heavily music-oriented show. [[Vonda Shepard]], a virtually unknown artist at the time, was featured continually on the show. Her song &quot;Searchin' My Soul&quot; became the show's theme song. Many of the songs Shepard performed were established hits with lyrics that paralleled the events of the episode, including &quot;[[Both Sides Now (song)|Both Sides Now]]&quot;, &quot;[[Hooked on a Feeling]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Tell Him (Bert Berns song)|Tell Him]]&quot;. Besides recording background music for the show, Shepard frequently appeared at the ends of episodes as a musician performing at a local [[piano bar]] frequented by the main characters. On rare occasions, her character would have conventional dialogue.

Due to the popularity of the show and Shepard's music, a soundtrack titled ''[[Songs from Ally McBeal]]'' was released in 1998, as well as a successor soundtrack titled ''Heart and Soul: New Songs From Ally McBeal'' in 1999. Two compilation albums from the show featuring Shepard were also released in 2000 and 2001. Other artists featured on the show include [[Barry White]], [[Al Green]], [[Tina Turner]] and [[Elton John]]. [[Josh Groban]] played the role of Malcolm Wyatt in the May 2001 season finale, performing &quot;You're Still You.&quot; The series creator, David E. Kelley, was impressed with Groban's performance at The Family Celebration event, and based on the audience reaction to Groban's singing, Kelley created a character for Groban in this finale. The background score for the show was composed by [[Danny Lux]].

==''Ally'' the sitcom==
In 1999, at the height of the show's popularity, a half-hour version entitled ''Ally''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0210403/ &quot;Ally&quot; (1999) at IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt; began airing in parallel to the main program. This version, designed in a sitcom format, used re-edited scenes from the main program, as well as previously unseen footage. The intention was to further develop the plots in the comedy-drama in a sitcom style. It also focused only on Ally's personal life, cutting all the courtroom plots. The repackaged show did not catch on and was canceled partway through its initial run. While 13 episodes of ''Ally'' were created, only 10 of those 13 were actually broadcast.

      <comment>r2.7.1) (robot Removing: [[hu:Andreas Capellanus]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Andreas Capellanus''' (''Capellanus'' meaning &quot;chaplain&quot;) was the 12th-century author of a treatise commonly known as ''[[De amore (Andreas Capellanus)|De amore]]'' (&quot;About Love&quot;), and often known in English, somewhat misleadingly, as ''The Art of Courtly Love'', though its realistic, somewhat cynical tone suggests that it is in some measure an antidote to [[courtly love]]. Little is known of Andreas Capellanus's life, but he is presumed to have been a courtier of [[Marie de Champagne|Marie of Troyes]], and probably of French origin; he is sometimes known by a French translation of his name, '''André le Chapelain'''.

==His work==
''De Amore'' was written at the request of [[Marie de Champagne]], daughter of King [[Louis VII of France]] and of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]. A dismissive allusion in the text to the &quot;wealth of Hungary&quot; has suggested the hypothesis that it was written after 1184, at the time when [[Bela III of Hungary]] had sent to the French court a statement of his income and had proposed marriage to Marie's sister [[Margaret of France, Queen of England and Hungary|Marguerite of France]], but before 1186, when his proposal was accepted. 

[[John Jay Parry]], the editor of ''De Amore'', quotes critic Robert Bossuat as describing &quot;De Amore&quot; as &quot;one of those capital works which reflect the thought of a great epoch, which explains the secret of a civilization&quot;.  It may be viewed as didactic, mocking, or merely descriptive; in any event it preserves the attitudes and practices that were the foundation of a long and significant tradition in Western literature.

The social system of &quot;courtly love&quot;, as gradually elaborated by the [[Provençal literature|Provençal]] [[troubadour]]s from the mid twelfth century, soon spread. One of the circles in which this poetry and its ethic were cultivated was the court of Eleanor of Aquitaine (herself the granddaughter of an early troubadour poet, [[William IX of Aquitaine]]). It has been claimed that ''De Amore'' codifies the social and sexual life of Eleanor's court at Poitiers between 1170 and 1174, though it was evidently written at least ten years later and, apparently, at Troyes. It deals with several specific themes that were the subject of [[poetical debate (Occitan literature)|poetical debate]] among late twelfth century troubadours and [[trobairitz]].

The '''American Civil Liberties Union''' ('''ACLU''') consists of two separate [[non-profit organization]]s: the ACLU Foundation, a [[501(c)(3)]] organization which focuses on litigation and communication efforts, and the American Civil Liberties Union, a [[501(c)(4)]] organization which focuses on legislative lobbying.&lt;ref name=&quot;nonprofit&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=ACLU and ACLU Foundation: What Is the Difference?

Lawsuits brought by the ACLU have been influential in the evolution of Constitutional law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aclu.org/scotus/index.html|title=ACLU Supreme Court Cases | accessdate =2006-10-14  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU provides legal assistance in cases in which it considers [[civil liberties]] to be at risk. Even when the ACLU does not provide direct legal representation, it often submits ''[[amicus curiae]]'' [[brief (law)|briefs]]. The organization's present aims include getting the U.S. government to disclose the legal standard it uses to place U.S. citizens on government assassination lists.&lt;ref&gt;Strohm, Chris (7 December 2010). [http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/court-dismisses-suit-challenging-targeting-of-radical-cleric-20101207 &quot;Court Dismisses Suit Challenging Targeting of Radical Cleric&quot;.] NationalJournal.com. Retrieved 10 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of its legal work, the organization has also engaged in lobbying of elected officials and political activism.&lt;ref&gt;ACLU, [http://www.aclu.org/about/24030res20060201.html &quot;About Us&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLU has been critical of elected officials and policies of both [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].

==History==
[[Roger Nash Baldwin]] became head of the [[National Civil Liberties Bureau]] (NCLB) in 1917. An independent outgrowth of the [[American Union Against Militarism]], the Bureau opposed American intervention in [[World War I]]. The NCLB provided legal advice and aid for [[conscientious objector]]s and those being prosecuted under the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] or the [[Sedition Act of 1918]]. In 1920, the NCLB changed its name to the American [[Civil Liberties]] Union, with Baldwin continuing as its director and [[Walter Nelles]] as chief counsel. [[Jeannette Rankin]], [[Jane Addams]], [[Crystal Eastman]], [[Albert DeSilver]], [[Helen Keller]], along with other former members of the NCLB, assisted Baldwin with the founding of the ACLU.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot; /&gt; Among the founding members was [[Felix Frankfurter]], who later became an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natcom.org/pubs/ROC/one-one/haiman.htm The ACLU as Guardian of Liberty] Franklyn S. Haiman&lt;/ref&gt; DeSilver and Nelles were Baldwin's closest associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://myhero.com/myhero/hero.asp?hero=rogerbaldwin| title=Freedom Hero: Roger Nash Baldwin, [[Oxford University Press]] | accessdate=2008-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/1228985| title=The Free Speech League, The ACLU and Changing Conceptions of Free Speech in American History, Stanford Law Review | accessdate=2008-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU was formed to protect aliens threatened with deportation, along with U.S. nationals threatened with criminal charges by [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[Alexander Mitchell Palmer]] for their [[Communism|communist]] or [[Socialism|socialist]] activities and agendas&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;[http://www.aclu-cu.org/history.html &quot;A Brief History of the American Civil Liberties Union&quot;], Champaign County ACLU.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Palmer Raids]]). It also opposed attacks on the rights of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) and other [[trade union|labor union]]s to meet and organize.

In 1940, the ACLU formally barred communists from leadership or staff positions, and would take the position that it did not want communists as members either. The board declared that it was &quot;inappropriate for any person to serve on the governing committees of the Union or its staff, who is a member of any political organization which supports totalitarianism in any country, or who by his public declarations indicates his support of such a principle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://infoshare1.princeton.edu/libraries/firestone/rbsc/finding_aids/aclu1920/ | title=American Civil Liberties Union: The Roger Baldwin Years (1917–1950)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purge, which was led by Baldwin, himself a former supporter of communism, began with the ouster of [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], a member of both the [[Communist Party USA]] and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Cottrell, [http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/baldwin.html &quot;Roger Baldwin: Founder, American Civil Liberties Union, 1884–1981&quot;], ''Notable American Unitarians'', Harvard Square Library.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ACLU's chairman since its founding, [[Harry F. Ward]], resigned in protest of the decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;quits&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Dr. H.F. Ward Quits Liberties Organization|newspaper=New York Times|date=4 March 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, the resolution was rescinded in 1967, allowing Communist Party members to rejoin the ACLU and in 1976, the ACLU restored Elizabeth Gurley Flynn's membership posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/elizabethgurleyflynn/a/rebel_girl_2.htm | title=Women's History, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn: Biography of the Rebel Girl | author=Jone Johnson Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservatives and Republican have frequently criticized the ACLU. One well-known example occurred during the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]]: then-[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] noted that his opponent [[Michael Dukakis]] had described himself as a &quot;card-carrying member of the ACLU&quot; and used that as evidence that Dukakis was &quot;a strong, passionate liberal&quot; and &quot;out of the mainstream.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/debatingourdestiny/dod/1988-broadcast.html | title=Debating Our Destiny: The 1988 Debates}}{{cite web | url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showdebate.php?debateid=13 | title=First Bush-Dukakis Presidential Debate transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase subsequently was used by the organization in an advertising campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Randall Rothenburg | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEED61E30F93BA1575AC0A96E948260 | title = A.C.L.U. Goes Hollywood in Countering Bush's Campaign of Derision | work = [[New York Times]] | date = September 28, 1988 | accessdate = 2008-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the ensuing debate regarding the proper balance of civil liberties and security, including the passage of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], the membership of the ACLU increased by 20%, bringing the group's total enrollment to 330,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/localnews/20021202aclusidebarp8.asp | title = ACLU has new constituency after 9/11 | work = [[Associated Press]] via [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date = 2002-12-02 | accessdate = 2007-11-20 | author = Ron Kampeas }}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth continued, and by August 2008 ACLU membership was greater than 500,000.  It remained at that level in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;ACLU, [http://aclu.org/about/index.html &quot;About Us&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership, funding and organizational structure==
===Leadership===
[[File:Nadine_Strossen_by_David_Shankbone.jpg|thumb|[[Nadine Strossen]], Former President (1991–2008)]]

Currently, the leadership of the ACLU includes Executive Director [[Anthony Romero]]&lt;ref&gt;ACLU, [http://www.aclu.org/about/staff/13279res20030205.html &quot;Anthony D. Romero, Executive Director&quot;], ACLU profile (last visited January 6, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; and President [[Susan Herman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclu.org/about/staff/37172res20081018.html &quot;Susan Herman, President of the ACLU &quot;], ACLU profile (last visited October 22, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  The national board of directors consists of representatives elected by each state affiliate as well as at-large delegates elected by boards of each affiliate. Each state affiliate has an Executive Director and Board of Directors.

Notably, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], a current Justice of the Supreme Court, was the first director of the ACLU's Women's Rights Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2005, in response to increasing internal strife, the ACLU national board attempted to impose what many critics labeled a &quot;gag rule&quot; on its employees. The proposal included the rule that &quot;a board member may publicly disagree with an ACLU policy position, but may not criticize the ACLU Board or staff.&quot; The measures proved highly unpopular with free speech advocates within the ACLU, and were eventually shelved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070205/sherman Aclu V.

===Funding===
The ACLU receives funding from a large number of sources. For example, in 2004, the ACLU and its affiliate, the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation reported revenues totaling $85,559,887. Of that total, 87% was from donations and dues from the public, 1.8% from program services, including awards of legal fees, royalty income, and literature sales, and the remainder from investment income and income from sale of assets. The distribution and amount of funding for state affiliates varies from state to state. For example, the [[American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey|ACLU of New Jersey]] reported $1.2 million in income to both the ACLU-NJ and its affiliated tax-exempt foundation in the 2005 fiscal year. Of that income, 46% came from contributions, 19% came from membership dues, 18% came from court awarded attorney fees, 12% came from grants, 4% came from investment income and the remainder from other sources. Its expenses in the same period were $800,000, of which 12% went to administration and management. Smaller affiliates with fewer resources, such as that in Nebraska, receive subsidies from the national ACLU.&lt;ref&gt;ACLU Nebraska, [http://www.aclunebraska.org/faq.htm#10 &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot;] (last visited Jan. 6, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foundations====
In October 2004, the ACLU rejected $1.5 million from both the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations because the Foundations had adopted language from the USA PATRIOT Act in their donation agreements, including a clause stipulating that none of the money would go to &quot;underwriting terrorism or other unacceptable activities.&quot; The ACLU views this clause, both in Federal law and in the donors' agreements, as a threat to civil liberties, saying it is overly broad and ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Strom, &quot;A.C.L.U. Rejects Foundation Grants Over Terror Language&quot;, ''[[New York Times]]'', Oct. 19, 2004 (available at [http://www.aclusc.org/Page/Clipping/NYTimes/041019Strom.html ACLU South Carolina]).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Court-awarded damages and attorney's fees====
In 2004, court-awarded damages and attorney fees comprised 3% (net) of ACLU Foundation funding; state affiliates also receive money from such fees, although the national headquarters does not.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Recovery of attorney's' fees by non-profit legal advocacy organizations is common practice. The [[pro-life]] [[Thomas More Law Center]], for example, generally seeks, and is successful in, recovery of attorney's fees in the same manner as the ACLU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasmore.org/news.html?NewsID=227 ThomasMore.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasmore.org/news.html?NewsID=383 ThomasMore.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, the Thomas More law center derived 4.8% of its funding from court-awarded legal fees in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt from Tax, filed 11/14/06&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the nature of its legal work, the ACLU is often involved in litigation against governmental bodies, which are generally protected from adverse monetary judgments: a town, state or federal agency may be required to change its laws or behave differently, but not to pay monetary damages except by an explicit statutory waiver.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lane v. Pena]]'', 518 U.S. 187 (1996) ([http://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/case/959/ abstract of case at Oyez]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chain, Younger Cohn &amp; Stiles (law firm), [http://www.chainyounger.com/pa_cases_against_government.html#1 &quot;Cases Against Local, County, State and Federal Government&quot;] (law firm material; last visited, Jan. 6, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the law permits plaintiffs who successfully sue government agencies to collect money damages or other monetary relief. In particular, the [[Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976]] leaves the government liable in some civil rights cases. Fee awards under this civil rights statute are considered &quot;equitable relief&quot; rather than damages, and government entities are not immune from equitable relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00001988----000-.html | title=Title 42 , Chapter 21, Subchapter I, § 1988. Proceedings in vindication of civil rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under laws such as this, the ACLU and its state affiliates sometimes share in monetary judgments against government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/in08_hostettler/090706peramarkup.html | title=House Judiciary Committee Passes Hostettler's Public Expression of Religion Act}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU has received court awarded fees in numerous church-state cases. The Georgia affiliate was awarded $150,000 in fees after suing a county demanding the removal of a [[Ten Commandments]] display from its courthouse;&lt;ref&gt;ACLU Georgia Press Release, [http://www.acluga.org/press.releases/0507/barrow.county.html &quot;Barrow County to Remove 10 Commandments Display&quot;], July 19, 2007 (last visited Jan. 6, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; a second Ten Commandments case in the State, in a different county, led to a $74,462 judgment.&lt;ref&gt;ACLU Georgia, [http://www.acluga.org/docket.html &quot;2007 Litigation &amp; Advocacy Docket&quot;] (last visited Jan. 6, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the State of Tennessee was required to pay $50,000, the State of Alabama $175,000, and the State of Kentucky $121,500, in similar Ten Commandments cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/07/09/loc_kytencommandments09.html | title=State pays ACLU $121,500 in Ten Commandments fight}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, [http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_10cb.htm The Ten Commandments: Developments: Year 2002], ReligiousTolerance.org&lt;/ref&gt; The Public Expression of Religion Act of 2005, introduced by Representative [[John Hostettler]], sought to alter the rules put in place by the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976 to prevent monetary judgments in the particular case of violations of church-state separation.&lt;ref&gt;Report No. 109-657, H.R. 2679, available at [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h2679rh.txt.pdf GPO].&lt;/ref&gt; Also, groups such as the [[American Legion]] have taken stances opposing the ACLU's right to collect fees under such legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legion.org/documents/rtf/aclu.rtf American Legion]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational structure===
[[File:howard-simon-ed-aclu-fl.jpg|thumb|Howard Simon, executive director of the Florida chapter, joins in a protest of the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] detentions with [[Amnesty International]].]]
The national headquarters of the ACLU is located in New York City. The organization does most of its work through 54 locally based affiliates and associated chapters, each of which have staff and a board of directors. The affiliates generally correspond to state (or equivalent) lines; Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico each have an affiliate and California has three affiliates (Missouri has two, with Western Missouri combined with Kansas).&lt;ref name=&quot;affiliates&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Local ACLU Affiliates |work = American Civil Liberties Union web site  | publisher =ACLU |url = http://www.aclu.org/affiliates  | accessdate =2010-08-20  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These affiliates maintain a certain amount of governing autonomy from the national organization, and are able to work independently from each other, if they choose to do so. Many of the ACLU's cases originate or are handled from the local level and are also handled by local lawyers from the individual affiliates.

Affiliates (the state organizations) are the basic unit of the ACLU's organization and engage in litigation, lobbying, and public education. For example, in a twenty-month period beginning January 2004, the ACLU's New Jersey chapter was involved in fifty-one cases according to their annual report—thirty-five cases in state courts, and sixteen in [[United States federal courts|federal court]]. They provided legal representation in thirty-three of those cases, and served as amicus in the remaining eighteen. They listed forty-four volunteer attorneys who assisted them in those cases.

Each legal foundation and political affiliate is registered as a [[501(c)#501.28c.29.283.29|501(c)(3)]] and [[501(c)#501.28c.29.284.29|501(c)(4)]] entity, respectively.

==Positions==
While the bulk of the ACLU's cases involve the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]], [[due process]], and the [[Privacy|right to privacy]],&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', the [[Louisiana]] chapter's [http://www.laaclu.org/Complaints/complaints.html &quot;Complaint Guidelines&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; the organization has taken positions on a wide range of issues. According to the ACLU, it supports:

*Concerning the Second Amendment, specifically [[Gun politics|gun control]], &quot;the ACLU interprets the Second Amendment as a collective right. Therefore, we disagree with the Supreme Court’s decision in [[D.C. v. Heller]]. ''Heller'' takes a different approach than the ACLU has advocated. At the same time, it leaves many unresolved questions, including what firearms are protected by the Second Amendment, what regulations (short of an outright ban) may be upheld, and how that determination will be made.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot; Second Amendment&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.aclu.org/racial-justice_prisoners-rights_drug-law-reform_immigrants-rights/second-amendment| title=American Civil Liberties Union: Gun Control}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, state level ACLU affiliates are free to take positions differing from the national organization's; in 2008, the Nevada ACLU announced that they were changing their position to support &quot;the individual’s right to bear arms subject to constitutionally permissible regulations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/jul/11/only-nevada-aclu-opposes-gun-control/| title=Nevada ACLU supports an individual’s right to bear arms}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ACLU has opposed some [[campaign finance reform]] laws such as the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]], which it considers an inappropriate restriction upon freedom of expression.

==Controversial stances==
{{Wikinews|ACLU President Strossen on religion, drugs, guns and impeaching George Bush}}
The ACLU has for years been a controversial organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howstuffworks.com/aclu.htm Howstuffworks &quot;How the ACLU Works&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for opposition are varied, although [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] often view the ACLU stance of [[separation of church and state]] as anti-religious, &lt;ref&gt; {{cite  book

Furthermore, the nature of the ACLU is that they defend even the most unpopular forms of speech and expression, notably those with which most other organizations would not wish to associate themselves. Often, its clients are notoriously unpopular such as [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] organizations and the [[North American Man/Boy Love Association]] (NAMBLA), a group which supports lifting all [[age of consent reform|age restrictions]] on [[pederasty]]. In the case of NAMBLA, the ACLU's Massachusetts affiliate represented the organization, on first amendment grounds, in a [[Curley v. NAMBLA|wrongful death civil suit]] that was based solely on the fact that a man who raped and murdered a child had visited the NAMBLA website.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACLU-UnpopularSpeech&quot;&gt;ACLU, [http://www.aclu.org/freespeech/protest/11289prs20000831.html &quot;ACLU Statement on Defending Free Speech of Unpopular Organizations&quot;], Aug. 31, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the ACLU does not endorse NAMBLA's message, its defense of the group has been widely criticized. Additionally, the ACLU has joined several court cases against government funding of organizations that discriminate against homosexuals and atheists, prominently including the [[Boy Scouts of America]].&lt;ref&gt;ACLU, [http://www.aclu.org/scotus/1999/11988prs20000628.html &quot;U.S. Supreme Court Ruling that boy Scouts Can Discriminate Is 'Damaging but Limited,' ACLU Says&quot;], June 28, 2000 (last visited Oct. 26, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most notable controversial cases which involved the ACLU are the following:
*The ACLU currently opposes, under the [[Ex post facto law|ex post facto]] clause of the Constitution, the retroactive application of [[Megan's Law|Megan’s Law]] (which requires law enforcement authorities to identify convicted sex offenders to the public at large through various media outlets) to persons convicted before the law was passed.&lt;ref&gt;National Alert Registry, [http://www.registeredoffenderslist.org/megans-law.htm &quot;Megan's Law: What it is and who Megan's Law Offenders are&quot;] (last visited Jan. 7, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ACLU New Jersey, [http://www.aclu-nj.org/issues/privacy/meganslawstillunderattack.htm &quot;Megan's Law Still Under Attack&quot;] (last visited Jan. 8, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=January 2011}} The ACLU initially opposed the bill in its entirety, considering it &quot;misguided political posturing that [would] do nothing to reduce sex crimes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Van Slambrouck, [http://www.csmonitor.com/durable/1998/08/13/fp3s1-csm.htm &quot;Sex-Crime Laws Draw More Flak&quot;], ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', August 13, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=January 2011}}

*The ACLU has aided the [[Florida Justice Institute]] and [[WriteAPrisoner.com]] in supporting prisoner's rights, especially what the ACLU sees as the First Amendment right to post online profiles seeking pen pals during their incarceration and jobs upon their release.
*In 2006, the ACLU of Washington State and the [[Second Amendment Foundation]] jointly filed a lawsuit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/aclu-lawsuit-seeks-access-lawful-information-internet-library-patrons-eastern|title=ACLU Lawsuit Seeks Access to Lawful Information on Internet for Library Patrons in Eastern Washington|date=November 16, 2006|accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the North Central Regional Library District (NCRL) in Washington for its policy of refusing to disable restrictions upon an adult patron's request. Library patrons attempting to access pro-gun web sites were blocked, and the library refused to remove the blocks.

Much ACLU work is done in the political arena where it faces frequent controversy as well.

*The ACLU has been a vocal opponent of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] of 2001, the [[Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003|PATRIOT 2]] Act of 2003, and associated legislation made in response to the threat of domestic terrorism. The ACLU believes such legislation violates either the letter or the spirit of the [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]]. In response to a requirement of the USA PATRIOT Act, the ACLU withdrew from the [[Combined Federal Campaign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cfc&quot;&gt;ACLU, [http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/18526prs20040731.html &quot;Citing Government &quot;Blacklist&quot;; Policy, ACLU Rejects $500,000 from Funding Program &quot;], July 31, 2004 (last visited Jan. 7, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement was that ACLU employees must be checked against a federal anti-terrorism watch list.

In 2000, Marvin Johnson, a legislative counsel for the ACLU, stated that proposed anti-spam legislation infringed on free speech by denying anonymity and by forcing spam to be labeled as such: &quot;Standardized labeling is compelled speech.&quot; He also stated, &quot;It's relatively simple to click and delete.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Adam S.

As early as 1997 the ACLU had taken a strong position that nearly all spam legislation was improper,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anu.edu.au/mail-archives/link/link9709/0306.html ACLU Cyber-Liberties Update], Sept. 2, 1997 (on the Red Rock Eater News Service listserve) (last visited Jan. 7, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; although it has supported &quot;[[opt-out]]&quot; requirements in some cases. The ACLU opposed the 2003 [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003|CAN-SPAM]] act&lt;ref&gt;ACLU, [http://www.aclu.org/freespeech/commercial/10953leg20030730.html &quot;Letter to the Senate Urging Opposition to S.877, the &quot;Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003&quot;&quot;], July 30, 2003 (last visited Jan. 7, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that it could have a [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]] on speech in cyberspace.

==Notable historical cases==
{{Main|List of court cases involving the American Civil Liberties Union}}
Since its founding, the ACLU has been involved in many cases. A few of the most significant are discussed here.

===1920–1960===
In 1925, the ACLU persuaded [[John T. Scopes]] to defy Tennessee's anti-[[evolution]] law in a [[Scopes Trial|court test]]. [[Clarence Darrow]], a member of the ACLU National Committee, headed Scopes' legal team. The prosecution, led by [[William Jennings Bryan]], contended that the Bible should be interpreted literally in teaching [[creationism]] in school. The ACLU lost the case and Scopes was fined $100. The Tennessee Supreme Court later upheld the law but overturned the conviction on a technicality.&lt;ref&gt;University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law, [http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/scopes.htm &quot;''Tennessee v. John Scopes'': The 'Monkey Trial' (1925)&quot;], ''Famous Trials in American History'', last updated April 25, 2005 (last visited Jan. 7, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/scopeschrono.html | title=The Evolution-Creationism Controversy: A Chronology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--missing blurb on the 1947 case which brought the idea of the separation of church and state into American legal practice--&gt;
In 1954, the ACLU filed an [[amicus brief]] in the case of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', which led to the ban on racial segregation in U.S. [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;ACLU, ''ACLU Amicus Brief in Brown v. Board of Education'', Oct. 11, 1952 ([http://www.aclu.org/racialjustice/gen/15901lgl19521011.html PDF brief]).&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960–2000===
In 1967, the ACLU successfully argued against state bans on [[interracial marriage]], in the case of ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', 388 U.S. 1 (1967), available at [http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/loving.html UMKC Law School].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the ACLU was the first major national organization to call for the [[impeachment]] of President [[Richard Nixon]], giving as reasons the Nixon administration's violations of [[civil liberties]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; That same year, the ACLU was involved in the cases of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', in which the Supreme Court held that the constitutional right of privacy extended to women seeking abortions.

In 1977, the ACLU [[National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie|filed suit]] against the Village of [[Skokie, Illinois]], seeking an injunction against the enforcement of three town ordinances outlawing Neo-Nazi parades and demonstrations. Skokie, Illinois at the time had a majority population of Jews, totaling 40,000 of 70,000 citizens. A federal district court struck down the ordinances in a decision eventually affirmed by the Supreme Court. According to David Hamlin, executive director of the Illinois ACLU, &quot;...the Chicago office which chose to provide legal counsel to neo-Nazis who have been planning to march in Skokie, has lost about 25% of its membership and nearly one-third of its budget.&quot; 30,000 ACLU members resigned in protest.&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Strum, ''When the Nazis Came to Skokie: Freedom for Speech We Hate'' (University Press of Kansas) ([http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/strwhe.html University of Kansas Press publisher's catalog description]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cdm.digitalpast.org/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/skokiepo001&amp;CISOPTR=36 | title=Membership woes hurt ACLU while others gain}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cdm.digitalpast.org/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/skokiepo001&amp;CISOPTR=0 | title=2d suit to block Nazis from Skokie march fails}}&lt;/ref&gt; The financial strain from the controversy lead to layoffs at local chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = The High Cost of Free Speech:  A.C.L.U. dilemma: defending &quot;hateful and heinous&quot; ideas | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 1978-06-28 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916244-1,00.html | accessdate = 2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his February 23, 1978 decision overturning the town ordinances, US District Court Judge Bernard M. Decker described the principle involved in the case as follows: &quot;It is better to allow those who preach racial hatred to expend their venom in rhetoric rather than to be panicked into embarking on the dangerous course of permitting the government to decide what its citizens may say and hear ... The ability of American society to tolerate the advocacy of even hateful doctrines ... is perhaps the best protection we have against the establishment of any Nazi-type regime in this country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ed McManus, &quot;Nazi March: What's It All About?&quot;, ''Illinois Issues'', v.13, Nov. 1978 (available at [http://www.lib.niu.edu/ipo/1978/ii781111.html Illinois Periodicals Online]).&lt;/ref&gt; The neo-Nazis declined to march in Skokie. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| newspaper = NY Times

In the 1980s, the ACLU filed suit to challenge the [[Arkansas]] 1981 creationism statute, which required the teaching in public schools of the biblical account of creation as a scientific alternative to evolution. The law was declared unconstitutional by a Federal District Court.&lt;ref&gt;''[[McLean v. Arkansas|McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education]]'', 529 F. Supp. 1255 (E.D. Ark. 1982) ([http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html &quot;transcription&quot; by Clark Dorman], Jan. 30, 1996, at TalkOrigins).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the ACLU became involved in a case involving the distribution of [[child pornography]] (''[[New York v. Ferber]]'').&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York v. Ferber]]', 458 U.S. 747 (1982) ([http://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/case/279/ abstract at Oyez]).&lt;/ref&gt; In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that the law in question &quot;has criminalized the dissemination, sale or display of constitutionally protected non-obscene materials which portray juveniles in sexually related roles,&quot; while arguing that child pornography deemed [[Obscenity|obscene]] under the [[Miller test]] deserved no constitutional protection and could be banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.aclu.org/privacy/speech/14793leg20020508.html | title = Letter to Reps.

===2000–present===
In November 2000, 15 African American residents of [[Hearne, Texas]] were indicted on drug charges after being arrested in a series of &quot;drug sweeps&quot;.  The ACLU filed a class action lawsuit, ''[[Kelly v. Paschall]]'', on their behalf, alleging that the arrests were unlawful. The ACLU contended that 15 percent of Hearne's male African American population aged 18 to 34 were arrested based on the &quot;uncorroborated word of a single unreliable confidential informant coerced by police to make cases.&quot;  On May 11, 2005, the ACLU and [[Robertson County, Texas|Robertson County]] announced a confidential settlement of the lawsuit, an outcome which &quot;both sides stated that they were satisfied with.&quot;  The District Attorney dismissed the charges against the plaintiffs of the suit.&lt;ref&gt;ACLU, [http://www.aclu.org/drugpolicy/racialjustice/10795prs20050602.html &quot;In Wake of ACLU Civil Rights Lawsuit Settlement, African Americans Affected by Texas Drug Task Force Scandal Call for Reconciliation at Town Meeting &quot;], 6/2/2005 (last visited 4/10/09).&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2009 film [[American Violet]] depicts this case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclu.org/drugpolicy/racialjustice/39103res20090417.html ACLU: American Violet]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 letter, the ACLU stated that it &quot;opposes child pornography that uses real children in its depictions&quot;, but that material &quot;which is produced without using real children, and is not otherwise obscene, is protected under the First Amendment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;ACLU, [http://www.aclu.org/privacy/speech/14793leg20020508.html &quot;Letter to Reps. Smith and Scott on H.R. 4623, the 'Child Obscenity and Pornography Prevention Act of 2002{{'&quot;}}], May 8, 2002, retrieved July 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2004, the ACLU, along with [[Lambda Legal]] and the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]], sued the state of California on behalf of 6 same-sex couples who were denied marriage licenses. That case, ''Woo v. Lockyer'', was eventually consolidated into ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'', the [[California Supreme Court]] case which led to same-sex marriage being available in that state from June 16, 2008 until [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] was passed on November 4, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclu.org/lgbt/relationships/californiamarriage.html &quot;California Marriage Case&quot;], ACLU, retrieved June 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2004 trial regarding allegations of [[Rush Limbaugh]]'s drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy should not have been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records.&lt;ref name=FOXRush&gt;Donaldson-Evans, Catherine (January 12, 2004), [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,108140,00.html &quot;ACLU Comes to Rush Limbaugh's Defense&quot;], [[Fox News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004, the ACLU received numerous phone calls from angry parents after the [[Dover Area School District]] in [[Dover, Pennsylvania]] passed a curriculum change requiring that its high school biology students be read a one-minute statement saying that the theory of [[evolution]] is not fact and mentioning [[intelligent design]] as an alternative theory. Believing that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], several Dover parents called the ACLU to discuss a possible lawsuit against the school. The ACLU, along with [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] and Pepper Hamilton, LLP, went on to represent the parents, the plaintiffs, in ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]''. After a more than 40-day trial, Judge [[John E. Jones III]] ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/21/education/21evolution.html?pagewanted=all &quot;Judge Rejects Teaching Intelligent Design&quot;], ''The New York Times'', December 21, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, the ACLU filed a lawsuit, ''[[ACLU v. NSA]]'', in a federal district court in Michigan, challenging government spying in the [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (&quot;NSA Spying Complaint&quot;), ''ACLU v. NSA'' (E.D. Mich. Jan. 17, 2006) ([http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/23491lgl20060117.html#attach PDF of complaint available] at ACLU website, &quot;Safe and Free: NSA Spying&quot; section of website).&lt;/ref&gt; On August 17, 2006, that court ruled that the warrantless wiretapping program is unconstitutional and ordered it ended immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Singel, [http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,71610-0.html?tw=wn_index_3 &quot;Judge Halts NSA Snooping&quot;], ''Wired'', August 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the order was stayed pending an appeal. The Bush administration did suspend the program while the appeal was being heard.&lt;ref name=fisaappeal&gt;{{cite news |last=Marks |first=Alexandra | title =Privacy Advocates Fight for Ground Lost After 9/11 |work=The Christian Science Monitor |page=USA2 |date=2007-04-03 |accessdate=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court &quot;turned down an appeal from the [ACLU] to let it pursue a lawsuit against the program that began shortly after the Sept. 11 terror attacks&quot;.&lt;ref name=aclu_loses&gt;{{cite news |title =Court Rejects ACLU Challenge to Wiretaps |work=Breitbart.com |date=2008-02-19 |accessdate=2008-02-19 |agency=AP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU and other organizations also filed separate lawsuits around the country against telecommunications companies. The ACLU filed a lawsuit in Illinois (''Terkel v. AT&amp;T'') which was dismissed because of the [[State Secrets Privilege]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/26235prs20060725.html &quot;ACLU of Illinois Responds to Ruling in ''Terkel v.

After the town of [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania]] passed an ordinance to punish landlords who rented to illegal immigrants and businesses who hired illegal immigrants, the ACLU and the [[Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund]] sued Hazleton, saying the ordinance was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclupa.org/legal/legaldocket/challengetohazletonimmigra.htm &quot;''Lozano v.

In 2008, the ACLU stated that it would represent defendants arrested in [[Flint, Michigan]] for [[disorderly conduct]] when [[sagging (fashion)|sagging]] (wearing pants low enough to show underwear), partly on the basis of unconstitutional [[racial profiling]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclumich.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=583 &quot;Enforcement of Flint Saggy Pants Rule is Unconstitutional and Must be Stopped&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the City of [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], began cracking down on when, where and how homeless persons can solicit donations, the ACLU sued Indianapolis, claiming the city's police unconstitutionally forced homeless persons to produce identification without probable cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclu-in.org/subpage.asp?p=32#6 &quot;Legal Docket: Police Practices&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the American military released the names of 645 detainees held at the [[Bagram Theater Internment Facility]] in Afghanistan, modifying its long-held position against publicizing such information. This list was prompted by a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] lawsuit filed in September 2009 by the ACLU, whose lawyers had also requested detailed information about conditions, rules and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/world/asia/17afghan.html &quot;Bagram Detainees Named by U.S.&quot;], ''The New York Times'', January 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8462894.stm &quot;US releases names of prisoners at Bagram, Afghanistan&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU represents a Muslim-American who was detained but never accused of a crime in ''[[Al-Kidd v Ashcroft]]'', a civil suit against the former Attorney General.

Adobe was founded in December 1982&lt;ref name=&quot;fastfacts&quot;/&gt; by [[John Warnock]] and [[Charles Geschke]], who established the company after leaving [[Xerox PARC]] in order to develop and sell the [[PostScript]] [[page description language]]. In 1985, [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] licensed PostScript for use in its [[LaserWriter]] [[computer printer|printers]], which helped spark the [[desktop publishing]] revolution. The company name ''Adobe'' comes from [[Adobe Creek (near Los Altos)|Adobe Creek]] in [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]], [[California]], which ran behind the house of one of the company's founders.&lt;ref name=&quot;fastfacts&quot;/&gt; Adobe acquired its former competitor, [[Macromedia]], in December 2005, which added newer software products and platforms such as [[Adobe ColdFusion|Coldfusion]], [[Adobe Dreamweaver|Dreamweaver]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] and [[Adobe Flex|Flex]] to its product portfolio.

As of August 2009, Adobe Systems has 7,564 employees,&lt;ref name=&quot;fastfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pdfs/fastfacts.pdf | title = Adobe Fast Facts|date=2009-03-09|accessdate=2009-04-04|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 40% of whom work in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Seattle]], [[San Francisco]], [[Orem, Utah|Orem]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]], [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] in [[United States]]; [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]]; [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]; [[Noida]], [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]], [[India]]; [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]; [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]].

==History==
[[File:Adobe HQ.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Adobe Systems headquarters complex|Adobe Systems headquarters]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]], [[United States|U.S.]]]]
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Main_building_3.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Adobe R&amp;D Centre in Noida, India.]] --&gt;
Adobe's first products after [[PostScript]] were digital [[Typeface|fonts]], which they released in a proprietary format called [[Type 1 and Type 3 fonts|Type 1]]. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] subsequently developed a competing standard, [[TrueType]], which provided full scalability and precise control of the [[pixel]] pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to [[Microsoft]]. Adobe responded by publishing the [[Type 1 and Type 3 fonts|Type 1]] specification and releasing [[Adobe Type Manager]], software that allowed [[WYSIWYG]] scaling of [[Type 1 and Type 3 fonts|Type 1]] fonts on screen, like [[TrueType]], although without the precise pixel-level control. But these moves were too late to stop the rise of [[TrueType]]. Although [[Type 1 and Type 3 fonts|Type 1]] remained the standard in the graphics/publishing market, [[TrueType]] became the standard for business and the average Windows user. In 1996, Adobe and Microsoft announced the [[OpenType]] font format, and in 2003 Adobe completed converting its Type 1 font library to [[OpenType]].

In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer [[Computer software|software]] market with [[Adobe Illustrator]], a [[vector graphics|vector]]-based drawing program for the [[Apple Macintosh]]. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers. Unlike [[MacDraw]], then the standard Macintosh vector drawing program, Illustrator described shapes with more flexible [[Bézier curve]]s, providing unprecedented accuracy. Font rendering in Illustrator, however, was left to the Macintosh's [[QuickDraw]] libraries and would not be superseded by a PostScript-like approach until Adobe released Adobe Type Manager.

In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its [[flagship]] product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.&lt;ref name=&quot;siliconuser&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconuser.com/?q=node/10|title= How Adobe's Photoshop Was Born|accessdate=2007-06-12|last=Hormby|first=Thomas|publisher=[[SiliconUser]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Adobe introduced [[PDF]], the Portable Document Format, and its [[Adobe acrobat|Adobe Acrobat and Reader]] software. PDF is now an International Standard: [[PDF|ISO 32000-1:2008]]. The technology is adopted worldwide as a common medium for electronic documents.

Arguably, one of Adobe's few missteps on the Macintosh platform was their failure to develop their own [[desktop publishing]] (DTP) program. Instead, [[Aldus]] with [[Adobe PageMaker|PageMaker]] in 1985 and [[Quark, Inc.|Quark]] with [[QuarkXPress]] in 1987 gained early leads in the DTP market. Adobe was also slow to address the emerging [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] DTP market. However, Adobe made great strides in that market with the release of [[Adobe InDesign|InDesign]] and its bundled [[Adobe Creative Suite|Creative Suite]] offering. In a failure to predict the direction of computing, Adobe released a complete version of Illustrator for [[Steve Jobs]]' ill-fated [[NeXT]] system, but a poorly-produced version for Windows.

Despite these missteps, licensing fees from the PostScript interpreter allowed Adobe to outlast or acquire many of its rivals in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded to [[Adobe Premiere Pro]] in 2003.  In 1994, Adobe acquired Aldus and added [[Adobe PageMaker]] and [[Adobe After Effects]] to its production line later in the year; it also controls the [[TIFF]] file format. In 1995, Adobe added [[Adobe FrameMaker]], the long-document DTP application, to its production line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1999, Adobe introduced [[Adobe InCopy]] as a direct competitor to QuarkCopyDesk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/199910/19991011InCopy.html|title=About Adobe - Press Room - For Immediate Release|publisher= Adobe|accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Company events===
In 1992, Adobe acquired [[OCR Systems, Inc.]]; in 1994, the company acquired [[Aldus|Aldus Corporation]]. On May 30, 1997, Adobe reincorporated in Delaware by merging with and into Adobe Systems (Delaware), which was incorporated on May 9, 1997. Adobe Systems Incorporated (Delaware) was the surviving corporation and changed its name to Adobe Systems Incorporated concurrently with the merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/invrelations/faq.html|title=Adobe Investor Relations FAQ| publisher=Adobe|accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company acquired GoLive Systems, Inc. and released [[Adobe GoLive]] in 1999 and began shipping [[Adobe InDesign]] as a direct competitor to [[QuarkXPress]] and as an eventual replacement for [[PageMaker]]. In May 2003, Adobe acquired Syntrillium Software, adding [[Adobe Audition]] to its product line. In December 2004, French company OKYZ S.A., makers of 3D collaboration software, was acquired. This acquisition added 3D technology and expertise to the Adobe Intelligent Document Platform.

On December 12, 2005 Adobe acquired its main rival [[Macromedia]] in a [[stock swap]] valued at about $3.4 billion, adding [[Adobe ColdFusion]], [[Adobe Contribute]], [[Adobe Captivate]], [[Adobe Acrobat Connect]] (formerly Macromedia Breeze), [[Adobe Director]], [[Adobe Dreamweaver]], [[Adobe Fireworks]], [[Adobe Flash]], [[FlashPaper]], [[Adobe Flex]], [[Macromedia FreeHand]], [[Macromedia HomeSite]], [[Macromedia JRun]], [[Adobe Presenter]], and [[Macromedia Authorware]] to Adobe's production line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Adobe to acquire Macromedia|publisher=Adobe|date=2005-04-18|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/invrelations/adobeandmacromedia.html|accessdate=2007-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Adobe to Acquire Macromedia|publisher=Macromedia|date=2005-04-18|url= http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/proom/pr/2005/adobe_macromedia.html|accessdate=2007-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jefferson|last=Graham|title=Adobe buys Macromedia in $3.4B deal|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2005-04-18-adobe-macromedia_x.htm?csp=34|publisher=USA Today|date=2005-04-18|accessdate= 2007-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, [[Adobe Photoshop Lightroom]] was released to assist photographers in managing digital images and post production work. The product was intended as a competitor to [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[Aperture (photography software)|Aperture]] in the RAW image editing market. Adobe acquired [[Scene7]] in May of the same year. The company makes an image processing and display platform used in many retail sites on the web. In July, Adobe released [[Adobe Soundbooth|Soundbooth]]. This product was not intended to replace the existing [[Adobe Audition]] but merely to provide an environment for professionals not specializing in audio. On August 3, 2007, the company announced their plans to discontinue development of [[Authorware]], the “visual authoring tool for creating rich-media e-learning applications for delivery on corporate networks, CD/DVD, and the Web.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/authorware/productinfo/faq/eod|title=Authorware from Adobe : FAQ|publisher=Adobe|date= 2009-07-14|accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorware was one of the development tools acquired in the Macromedia/Adobe merger. It was replaced by Adobe Captivate. In October, the company acquired Virtual Ubiquity, along with its online word processor, [[Adobe Buzzword|Buzzword]]. On November 12, 2007, CEO, [[Bruce Chizen]] resigned. Effective December 1, he was replaced by [[Shantanu Narayen]], Adobe's current president and Chief Operating Officer. Bruce Chizen served out his term on Adobe's Board of Directors, and then continued in a strategic advisory role until the end of Adobe's 2008 [[fiscal year]].

Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008. On the 27 of April, Adobe discontinued development and sales of its older HTML/web development software, [[Adobe GoLive|GoLive]] in favor of [[Adobe Dreamweaver|Dreamweaver]]. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1, Adobe launched [[Acrobat.com]], a series of [[web application]]s geared for collaborative work.&lt;ref name=&quot;AcrobatDotCom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.adobe.com/acom/2008/06/welcome_to_acrobatcom_work_tog_1.html|title=Welcome to Acrobat.com — Work.

Adobe announced two acquisitions in 2009: on August 29, they purchased [[Business Catalyst]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/special/businesscatalyst/|title= Adobe acquires Business Catalyst|publisher=Adobe|accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on September 15, Adobe bought [[Omniture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20090915006569&amp;newsLang=en|title=Adobe to Acquire Omniture|publisher=Businesswire.com|date= 2009-09-15|accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 10, the company laid off 680 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrison|first=Scott|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704402404574528174100385780.html|title=Adobe Will Cut 680 Jobs to Reduce Costs|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=2009-11-10|accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Adobe announced it was investigating a &quot;[[Operation Aurora|coordinated attack]]&quot; against corporate network systems in China, managed by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Adobe%20Targeted%20by%20Cyber%20Attack%20from%20China/article17387.htm|title=Adobe Targeted by Cyber Attack from China| publisher=DailyTech|accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same attack was also brought against [[Google]] and over 20 other companies. Adobe announced the new Creative Suite series (CS5) launched globally Monday, April 12, 2010. New software such as [[Flash Catalyst]] and [[Business Catalyst]] were also announced.

[http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/060710-tech-argument-apple-adobe.html Adobe's 2010 was marked by continuing back-and-forth arguments with Apple] over the latter's non-support for Adobe Flash on its iPhone, iPad and other products. Apple CEO Steve Jobs has claimed that Flash is not reliable or secure enough, while Adobe executives have argued that Apple wish to maintain control over the iOS platform.

In January 2011, Adobe acquired Demdex, Inc with the intent of adding Demdex's audience-optimization software to its online marketing suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/201101/011811AdobeDemdex.html|title=Adobe Acquires Demdex – Brings Audience Optimization to $109 Billion Global Online Ad Market|publisher=Adobe|date=2011-01-18|accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alexander technique''' is an education/guidance system to &quot;improve posture and movement, and to use muscles efficiently&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =  Manipulative and Body-Based Practices: An Overview | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Institutes of Health | year = Updated March 2007 | url = http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=8929&amp;cn=15 | accessdate = 2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; as defined by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] (NCCAM). The &quot;Alexander technique&quot; denotes both the educational methods used by Alexander teachers and the individual bodily awareness methods taught. Students practice the technique to recognize and become free of habituated limitations in their manner of movement as well as for other benefits.
 
The technique takes its name from [[F. Matthias Alexander]], who, in the 1890s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rootberg | first = Ruth | title = Voice and Gender and other contemporary issues in professional voice and speech training | journal =  Voice and Speech Review, Voice and Speech Trainers Association, Inc,  Cincinnati, OH | pages = 164–170 | month = September | issue = 1 | year = 2007 | doi =  | volume = 35 | editor= Mandy Rees|quote= p. 164: A review of introductory articles on the Alexander Technique shows a variation in the length of time — either three or nine years — as the time it took Alexander to develop his technique. According to his biographer, Michael Bloch, the hoarseness — catalyst to his experiments — that Alexander refers to in ''The Use of the Self'', occurred in the second half of 1892, and by 1894, Alexander began teaching some of his early discoveries. Bloch goes on to suggest that although Alexander began publishing in 1900, &quot;almost a decade after he embarked on that process,&quot; his ideas were still not fully developed (p.34-36), and that using the term Primary Control, the underlying principle of the work, was not named in print until 1924). | pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed its principles as a personal tool to alleviate his breathing problems and [[hoarseness]]. He credited the technique with allowing him to pursue his passion for [[Shakespearean]] acting.

The technique is usually learned from an Alexander teacher in one-to-one sessions using specialized hand contact and verbal instructions. While the technique is often seen as and classified with &quot;[[bodywork]]&quot;, Alexander teachers consider it different from those practices. The technique involves teaching of what Alexander called &quot;The Use Of The Self&quot;: ''i.e.'' a re-education of the student's reactions to internal and external stimuli, rather than something &quot;done to&quot; the student.

==History==
Alexander was a Shakespearean [[orator]] who developed problems with losing his voice. After doctors informed him they could find no physical cause, he carefully observed himself in multiple mirrors. His self-observation revealed that he was needlessly stiffening his whole body in preparation to recite or speak.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Further, Alexander observed that many individuals experiencing breathing and voice problems commonly tightened the [[musculature]] of the upper torso, especially the neck, prior to [[phonation]] in anticipation of the act of vocalising. He suggested that this habitual pattern of pulling the head backwards and downwards in relationship to the neck needlessly disrupted the normal working of the postural, breathing and vocal mechanisms. After innovating new substitution strategies that included sharpening his ability to 'inhibit' the habitual undue tension in his neck, he found that his problem with recurrent hoarseness was resolved. Whilst on a recital tour in New Zealand (1895) he began to realise the wider significance of head carriage for overall functioning.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Alexander believed that his work could be applied to improve individuals' health and wellbeing, and would contribute to the increasing role of consciousness in human evolution. He refined his &quot;work&quot; (termed the Alexander technique after his death) so as to make his process of self-observation and re-training repeatable. He recorded his experiences in four books (1918, 1923, 1931 (1932 UK) and 1942). He also trained 'teachers' of his technique while living at 16 Ashley Place, London from 1931 until his death in 1955. Teacher training was interrupted during [[World War II]] between 1941 and 1943, when Alexander accompanied children and teachers of the Little School to Stowe, Massachusetts.

==The technique==
'''The Teaching Process'''

The Alexander technique is considered to be primarily an educational process to be practiced by the student, rather than a [[cure|curative]] treatment or therapy. Generally, it does not consist of routine exercises, but is meant to be applied in any moment when quality improvements are desired during action. For this reason, F.M. Alexander preferred not to recommend exercises for his students to perform, and most Alexander teachers follow this intent. Alexander's approach was to emphasize the use of freedom to choose beyond conditioning in every action.

Teachers use demonstration, explanation, and repeated re-examination of a student spontaneous reactions. Light hand contact by the teacher is most often used to detect and deal with the student's unnecessary stress. In the context of everyday motions such as using one's hands, sitting, standing, walking, and speaking, the teacher's suggestions are student-specific guidance and not a series of recommended exercises suitable for anyone. Assistance with any activity, such as a hobby, sports or an artistic performance may be requested as further topics of personal interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold 1997&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Arnold | first = Joan | coauthors = Hope Gillerman | title =  Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = American Society for the Alexander Technique | year = 1997 | url = http://www.alexandertech.org/misc/faq.html | accessdate = 2007-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exceptions are two prescriptive forms or exercises intended to be done in separate but brief practice times. A procedure recommended to all students is lying [[Supine position|semi-supine]] as a means for effective rest, releasing muscular tension and as an opportunity to use the [[conscious]] mental &quot;Directions&quot; Alexander devised. The other procedure is termed a &quot;Whispered Ah,&quot; used to subtract unnecessary effort from the use of the voice.

Freedom, efficiency and patience are the prescribed values. Proscribed are unnecessary effort, self-limiting habits as well as mistaken assumptions. Students are led to change their previous habitual and largely automatic routines that are interpreted by the teacher to currently or eventually be physically limiting and [[structurally]] inefficient. The Alexander teacher provides verbal coaching while monitoring, guiding and preventing unnecessary habits at their source with specialized hands-on assistance to show what is meant. This specialized assistance requires Alexander teachers to demonstrate on themselves the improved physical coordination they are [[communicating]] to the student.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptjournal.org/cgi/content/full/85/6/565 Improvement in Automatic Postural Coordination Following Alexander Technique Lessons in a Person With Low Back Pain - W Cacciatore et al. 85 (6): 565 - Physical Therapy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander developed his own [[terminology]] to talk about his methods, outlined in his four books. These terms were created to describe the sometimes [[paradoxical]] experience of learning and substituting new improvements.

'''Sensory appreciation'''

F. M. Alexander insisted on the need for strategic reasoning and &quot;Constructive Conscious Control&quot; because [[kinesthetic]] sensory awareness is a relative sense, not a truthful indicator of fact. The current postural attitude is sensed internally as a normal state of affairs, however inefficient. Alexander's term, &quot;debauched sensory appreciation&quot; describes how the [[wikt:repetition|repetition]] of a circumstance encourages habit design as a person adapts to circumstances or builds skills. Once trained and forgotten, completed habits may be activated without feedback sensations that these habits are in effect, just by thinking about them.&lt;ref&gt;''Body_Learning - An_Introduction to the Alexander Technique'', Macmillan, 1996 ISBN_0805042067, quote p. 74, an article in New Scientist by Professor John Basmajian entitled &quot;Conscious Control of Single Nerve Cells&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Short-sighted habits that have become harmful over time, such as restriction of breathing or other poor postural attitudes that limit freedom of movement &amp; shorten stature, will stop after learning to perceive and prevent them.

'''End-gaining'''

Another example is the term &quot;end-gaining&quot;, which means to focus on a goal so as to lose sight of the &quot;means-whereby&quot; the goal could be more appropriately achieved. According to Alexander teachers, &quot;end-gaining&quot; increases the likelihood of selecting older or multiple conflicting coping strategies with the potential for needless cumulative, ongoing self-injury. End-gaining actions are usually carried out because a more imperative priority justifies it, which is usually impatience or frustration.

'''Inhibition'''

In the Alexander technique lexicon, the principle of &quot;inhibition&quot; is considered by teachers to be the most prominent. F.M. Alexander's selection of this word pre-dates the modern meaning of the word originated by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Inhibition describes a moment of conscious awareness of a choice to interrupt, stop or entirely prevent an unnecessary habitual &quot;misuse.&quot; As unnecessary habits are prevented or interrupted, a freer capacity and range of motion resumes, experienced by the student as a state of &quot;non-doing.&quot;

'''Primary control'''

This innate coordination that emerges is also described more specifically as &quot;Primary Control&quot;. This is a key head, neck and spinal relationship. The body's responses are determined by the qualities of head and eye movement at the inception of head motion. What expands the qualities of further response is a very subtle nod forward to counteract backward startle pattern, coupled with an upward movement of the head away from the body that lengthens the spine. Students learn to include their whole body toward their intention of purposeful motion.

'''Directions'''

To continue to select and reinforce the often less dominant &quot;good use,&quot; it is recommended to repeatedly suggest, by thinking to oneself, a tailored series of &quot;orders&quot; (also termed Directions.) &quot;Giving Directions&quot; is the term for thinking and projecting an anatomically corrected map of how one's body is designed to be used effortlessly. &quot;Directing&quot; is suggestively thought, rather than willfully accomplished. This is because when freedom is the objective, the appropriate responses cannot be anticipated but can be observed and chosen in the moment.

'''Psycho-physical unity'''

Global concepts such as &quot;Psycho-physical Unity&quot; and &quot;Use&quot; describe how thinking strategies and attention work together during preparation for action. They connote the general sequence of how intention joins together with execution to directly affect the perception of events and the outcome of intended results.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Actor and the Alexander Technique|pages=14|isbn=0312295154|first=Kelly|last= McEvenue|location=New York|publisher= Macmillan|year= 2002|edition=1st Palgrave Macmillan|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ixvTPRlcSMoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
In the [[United Kingdom]], there is some coverage of the costs for Alexander lessons through the Complementary and Alternative Practitioners Directory.  Otherwise, individuals must pay for their Alexander technique education out of pocket. Those who are used to getting instant results may complain at a commitment of twenty to forty private lessons, which is the duration most Alexander teachers recommend that is required to gain proficiency. Private lessons usually cost in a similar range to private music lessons.

Inexpensive classes are rarely available. Workshops do exist, but usually do not last long enough to fulfill educational requirements for most students, who must then attend additional private lessons if they want to gain proficiency. Outside of the United Kingdom there is little or no insurance coverage, and the technique's effectiveness is also not yet recognized.

Practicing the Alexander technique cannot directly affect structural deformities once they occur (such as [[arthritis]] or other bone problems), or other diseases, (such as [[Parkinson's]], etc.) In these cases, the Alexander technique can only mitigate how the person copes with these difficulties and may help with other related problems.

The learning process often demands giving up &quot;favored&quot; ways of thinking and acting. This challenge can result in unanticipated defensiveness and resistance. If a student must halt lessons at an awkward stage, this can leave them without practical solutions for the &quot;bad&quot; habits they have just learned to sense.

===Benefits===
The Alexander technique is used remedially to regain freedom of movement. It is used to undo the establishment of nuisance habits by performers, and it's used as a self awareness discipline and a self-help tool to change specific habits.

These first application areas include alleviating pain and weakness as a result of poor posture or repetitive physical demands, improving pain management for chronic disabilities, and rehabilitation following surgery or injury where compensatory habits that were designed to avoid former pain need to be revised after healing. The Alexander technique has been shown to be an effective treatment for chronic or recurrent back pain in a randomized study published Aug. 19, 2008.&lt;ref name=BMJ2008;337:a884&gt;Paul Little et al.,[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/aug19_2/a884 Randomized controlled trial of Alexander technique (AT) lessons, exercise, and massage (ATEAM) for chronic and recurrent back pain], ''British Medical Journal'', August 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example among performance art applications, the technique is used and taught by classically trained singers and vocal coaches. Its advocates claim that it allows for the proper alignment of all aspects of the vocal cords and tract through consciously increased air flow. With this increase of breathing capacity, singers are said to be better able to exercise proper vocal technique and tone. Because the technique has allegedly been used to improve breathing and stamina in general, advocates of the technique claim that athletes, people with asthma, tuberculosis, and panic attacks have also found benefits.

Along the application of self-help, proponents of the technique suggest that it can help performers manage [[stage fright]], become more spontaneous, and to increase skill repertoire. It is suggested that A.T. can be an adjunct to psychotherapy for people with disabilities, [[Post-traumatic Stress Disorder]], panic attacks, stuttering, and chronic pain because using its principles can improve stress management abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aronson | first = AE | title = Clinical Voice Disorders: An Interdisciplinary Approach, | year = 1990 | publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers | isbn = 0865773378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Vigeland | first = C | title = The Answer to a Stress Test | journal =  Sports Illustrated Golf Plus |month=December | year=2000 | doi = | volume = 35 | pages = 57 | pmid= | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences of Alexander's work===
The English novelist [[Aldous Huxley]] was influenced by F. M. Alexander and the technique to the extent he included him as a character in the pacifist theme novel ''[[Eyeless in Gaza]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aldous Huxley, ''Eyeless in Gaza'', Harper and Brothers, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

The American philosopher and educator [[John Dewey]] became impressed with the Alexander technique after his headaches, neck pains, blurred vision, and stress symptoms largely improved during the time he used Alexander's exercises to correct neck posture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ryan, Alan |title=John Dewey and the high tide of American liberalism |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |year=1997 |pages=187–188 |isbn=0-393-31550-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2011 01 04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1923, Dewey wrote the introduction to Alexander's ''Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual''.&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Alexander, ''Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual'', E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1923, ISBN 0-913111-11-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Alexander's work in the field came at the turn of the century, his ideas influenced many originators in the field of mind-body improvement. [[Fritz Perls]], who originated [[Gestalt Therapy]], credited Alexander as an inspiration for his psychological work.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112411834/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 A note on the influence of F. M. Alexander on the development of gestalt therapy by Roger Tengwall, School of Social Sciences, University of California, Irvine&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Feldenkrais Method]] and the [[Mitzvah Technique]] were both influenced by the Alexander technique, in the form of study previous to the originators founding their own disciplines.

== Teaching ==
The technique is most commonly taught in a series of twenty to forty private lessons which may last from thirty minutes to an hour. Its principles have also been adapted to be taught in groups, often using short individual lessons demonstrated in turn which act as examples to the class.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold 1997&quot;/&gt;

==Scientific evidence==
A 2008 [[randomised controlled trial]] published in the [[British Medical Journal]] found marked improvement in addressing back pain with this technique. Those receiving 24 lessons had 3 days of back pain in a four week period, 18 days less than the control median of 21 days. The cohort receiving 6 lessons had a reduction of ten days in days-of-pain reported. Outcomes were also measured by Roland disability scores, a measure of the number of activities impaired by pain, with a control baseline of 8.1. 24 lessons reduced this by 4.14 points, while six lessons combined with exercise produced a reduction of 2.98.&lt;ref name=&quot;BMJ2008;337:a884&quot;/&gt; A subsequent analysis and comparative study of the economic implications concluded that &quot;a series of six lessons in Alexander technique combined with an exercise prescription seems the most effective and cost effective option for the treatment of back pain in primary care.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BMJ 2008;337:a2656&quot;&gt;Sandra Hollinghurst et al.,[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/dec11_2/a2656 Randomised controlled trial of Alexander technique lessons, exercise, and massage (ATEAM) for chronic and recurrent back pain: economic evaluation], [[British Medical Journal]], 11 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Dennis ran a controlled study of the effect of Alexander technique on the &quot;Functional Reach&quot; (associated with balance) of women older than 65. He observed a significant improvement in performance after 8 sessions, but this improvement was not maintained in a one-month follow-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dennis | first = RJ | title = Functional reach improvement in normal older women after Alexander Technique instruction | journal =  Journals of Gerontology Series a : Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = M8–11 | year = 1999 | url = http://biomed.gerontologyjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/54/1/M8 | pmid = 10026656 | doi = 10.1093/gerona/54.1.M8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in 2004 Maher concluded that &quot;Physical treatments, such as ... Alexander technique ... are either of unknown value or ineffective and so should not be considered&quot; when treating lower back pain with an evidence-based approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maher CG |title=Effective physical treatment for chronic low back pain |journal=Orthop. Clin. North Am. |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=57–64 |year=2004 |month=January |pmid=15062718 |doi=10.1016/S0030-5898(03)00088-9 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15062718}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Note that Alexander technique teachers recommend more than three times or more as many lessons than 8 to retain educational benefits.) In 2002, Stalibrass et al. published the results of a significant controlled study into the effectiveness of the technique in treating Parkinson's disease. Four different measures were used to assess the change in severity of the disease. By all four measures, Alexander technique was better than no treatment, to a statistically significant degree (both P-values &lt; 0.04). However, when compared to a control group given massage sessions, Alexander technique was only significantly better by two of the measures. The other two measures gave statistically insignificant improvements (P-values of approximately 0.1 and 0.6). This appears to lend some weight to the effectiveness of the technique, but more studies and data are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stallibrass | first = C | coauthors = P Sissons, C Chalmers | title = Randomised Controlled Trial of the Alexander Technique for Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease | journal = Clinical Rehabilitation | volume = 16 | issue = 7 | pages = 695–708 | month = July | year = 2002 | url = http://www.londonalexander.co.uk/CR544%5B1%5D.pdf | accessdate = 2007-05-01 | doi = 10.1191/0269215502cr544oa | pmid = 12428818 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the claims made for reducing the need for medication in patients with asthma, (in 1999,) Dennis concluded that additional &quot;robust, well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dennis | first = J | last2 = Cates | first2 = Christopher J | last3 = Dennis | first3 = Jane A | title = Alexander technique for chronic asthma | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 2 | pages = CD000995| year = 2000 | url=http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab000995.html | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000995 | pmid = 10796574 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] referenced scientific evaluations of the Alexander technique in his Nobel prize acceptance speech.&lt;ref&gt;http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/tinbergen-lecture.pdf, see p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrea Alciato''' (May 8, 1492 – January 12, 1550),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bregman|first=Alvan|title=Emblemata: The emblem books of Andrea Alciato|year=2007|publisher=Bird &amp; Bull Press|location=Newtown, Pa}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly known as '''Alciati''' ('''Andreas Alciatus'''), was an Italian [[jurist]] and writer.  He is regarded as the founder of the French school of [[legal humanists]].

==Biography==
Alciati was born in [[Alzate Brianza]], near [[Milan]], and settled in France in the early 16th century. He displayed great literary skill in his exposition of the laws, and was one of the first to interpret the [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] by the history, languages and literature of antiquity, and to substitute original research for the servile interpretations of the glossators. He published many legal works, and some annotations on [[Tacitus]]. Alciati is most famous for his ''[[Emblemata]],'' published in dozens of editions from 1531 onward. This collection of short Latin verse texts and accompanying woodcuts created an entire European genre, the [[emblem book]], which attained enormous popularity in continental [[Europe]] and [[Great Britain]].
[[Image:Emblema CLXXXIX.gif|right|180px|thumb|Emblem 189: ''Mentem, non formam, plus pollere'' (mind, not outward form, prevails)]]

Alciati died at [[Pavia]] in 1550.

The '''apparent magnitude''' ('''''m''''') of a celestial body is a [[measurement|measure]] of its [[brightness]] as seen by an observer on [[Earth]], normalized to the value it would have in the absence of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. The brighter the object appears, the lower the value of its '''magnitude'''.

The scale now used to indicate magnitude originates in the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] practice of dividing stars visible to the naked eye into six ''magnitudes''. The [[List of brightest stars|brightest stars]] were said to be of first magnitude (''m'' = 1), while the faintest were of sixth magnitude (''m'' = 6), the limit of [[human]] [[visual perception]] (without the aid of a [[telescope]]). Each grade of magnitude was considered twice the brightness of the following grade (a [[logarithmic scale]]). This somewhat crude method of indicating the brightness of stars was popularized by [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'', and is generally believed to originate with [[Hipparchus]]. This original system did not measure the magnitude of the [[Sun]].

In 1856, [[Norman Robert Pogson]] formalized the system by defining a typical first magnitude star as a star that is 100 times as bright as a typical sixth magnitude star; thus, a first magnitude star is about 2.512 times as bright as a second magnitude star. The fifth root of 100 is known as ''Pogson's Ratio''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0017//0000012.000.html Magnitudes of Thirty-six of the Minor Planets for the first day of each month of the year 1857], [[Norman Robert Pogson|N. Pogson]], [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|MNRAS]] Vol. 17, p. 12 (1856)&lt;/ref&gt; Pogson's scale was originally fixed by assigning [[Polaris]] a magnitude of 2. Astronomers later discovered that Polaris is slightly variable, so they first switched to [[Vega]] as the standard reference star, and then switched to using tabulated zero points{{Clarify|date=March 2009}} for the measured fluxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukads.nottingham.ac.uk/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1982lbor.book.....A&amp;amp;db_key=AST Landolt-Börnstein: Numerical Data and Functional Relationships in Science and Technology - New Series &quot; Gruppe/Group 6 Astronomy and Astrophysics &quot; Volume 2 Schaifers/Voigt: Astronomy and Astrophysics / Astronomie und Astrophysik &quot; Stars and Star Clusters / Sterne und Sternhaufen] [[Lawrence H. Aller|L. H. Aller]] ''et al.'', ISBN 3-540-10976-5 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The magnitude depends on the wavelength band (see below).

The modern system is no longer limited to 6 magnitudes or only to visible light. Very bright objects have ''negative'' magnitudes. For example, [[Sirius]], the brightest star of the [[celestial sphere]], has an apparent magnitude of –1.4. The modern scale includes the [[Moon]] and the [[Sun]]. The full Moon has a mean apparent magnitude of –12.74&lt;ref name=&quot;moon-fact&quot;/&gt; and the Sun has an apparent magnitude of –26.74.&lt;ref name=&quot;sun-fact&quot;/&gt; The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] has located stars with magnitudes of 30 at visible wavelengths and the [[Keck telescopes]] have located similarly faint stars in the infrared.

The above are only approximate values at visible wavelengths (in reality the values depend on the precise bandpass used) — see [[Airglow#How to calculate the effects of airglow|airglow]] for more details of telescope sensitivity.

== Calculations ==

As the amount of light received actually depends on the thickness of the Earth's atmosphere in the line of sight to the object, the apparent magnitudes are normalized to the value it would have in the absence of the atmosphere. The dimmer an object appears, the higher its apparent magnitude. Note that brightness varies with distance; an extremely bright object may appear quite dim, if it is far away. Brightness varies [[inverse-square law|inversely with the square]] of the distance. The [[absolute magnitude]], ''M'', of a celestial body (outside of the solar system) is the apparent magnitude it would have if it were 10 [[parsec]]s (~32.6 [[light years]]) away; that of a planet (or other solar system body) is the apparent magnitude it would have if it were 1 [[astronomical unit]] away from both the [[Sun]] and [[Earth]]. The absolute magnitude of the Sun is 4.83 in the V band (yellow) and 5.48 in the B band (blue).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bband&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 |title=Some Useful Astronomical Definitions
 |publisher=Stony Brook Astronomy Program

 |url=http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/aevans/PHY523/classnotes523/useful-definitions-pp.pdf
 |accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparent magnitude, ''m'', in the band, ''x'', can be defined as ''m&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' below (noting that &lt;math&gt;\log_{\sqrt[5]{100}} F = \frac{\log_{10} F }{\log_{10} 100^{1/5}} = 2.5\log_{10} F&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;m_{x}= -2.5 \log_{10} (F_x/F_x^0)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F_x\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the observed [[flux]] in the band x,
and &lt;math&gt;F_x^0&lt;/math&gt; is a reference flux in the same band x, such as the Vega star's for example. See [[Apparent magnitude#References|Aller et al. 1982]] for the most commonly used system.

Since an increase of 1 in the magnitude scale corresponds to a decrease in brightness by a certain factor, the factor would be &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[5]{100}&lt;/math&gt;, which is 2.512...

The variation in brightness between two luminous objects can be calculated another way by subtracting the magnitude number of the brighter object from the magnitude number of the fainter object, then using the difference as an exponent for the base number 2.512; that is to say (&lt;math&gt; m_f - m_b = x &lt;/math&gt;; and &lt;math&gt; 2.512^x = &lt;/math&gt;''variation in brightness'').

''What is the ratio in brightness between the Sun and the full moon?''

&lt;math&gt; m_f - m_b = x \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 2.512^x = &lt;/math&gt;''variation in brightness''

''The apparent magnitude of the Sun is -26.74, and the mean apparent magnitude of the full moon is -12.74. The full moon is the fainter of the two objects, while the Sun is the brighter''.

'''Difference in magnitude'''

&lt;math&gt; x = m_f - m_b \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x = (-12.74) - (-26.74) = 14 \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x = 14 \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

'''Variation in Brightness'''

&lt;math&gt; v_b = 2.512^x \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; v_b = 2.512^{14} \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; v_b = 398,359 \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

''variation in brightness'' = 398,359

''In terms of apparent magnitude, the Sun is about 398,359 times brighter than the full moon.''

=== Example 2 - Sirius &amp; Polaris ===

''What is the ratio in brightness between [[Sirius]] and [[Polaris]]?''

&lt;math&gt; m_f - m_b = x \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 2.512^x = \!\ &lt;/math&gt; ''variation in brightness''

''The apparent magnitude of Sirius is -1.44, and the apparent magnitude of Polaris is 1.97. Polaris is the fainter of the two stars, while Sirius is the brighter''.

'''Difference in magnitude'''

&lt;math&gt; x = m_f - m_b \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x = 1.97 - (-1.44) = 3.41 \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x = 3.41 \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

'''Variation in brightness'''

&lt;math&gt; v_b = 2.512^x \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; v_b = 2.512^{3.41} \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; v_b = 23.124 \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

''In terms of apparent magnitude, Sirius is 23.124 times brighter than Polaris the North Star''.

The second thing to notice is that the scale is [[logarithm]]ic: the relative brightness of two objects is determined by the difference of their magnitudes. For example, a difference of 3.2 means that one object is about 19 times as bright as the other, because Pogson's ratio raised to the power 3.2 is 19.054607...
A common misconception is that the logarithmic nature of the scale is because the [[human eye]] itself has a logarithmic response. In Pogson's time this was thought to be true (see [[Weber-Fechner law]]), but it is now believed that the response is a [[power law]] (see [[Stevens' power law]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Misconceptions About Astronomical Magnitudes|authorlink=Eric Schulman|author=E. Schulman and C. V. Cox|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=65|page=1003|year=1997|bibcode = 1997AmJPh..65.1003S |doi = 10.1119/1.18714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnitude is complicated by the fact that light is not [[monochromatic]]. The sensitivity of a light detector varies according to the wavelength of the light, and the way it varies depends on the type of light detector. For this reason, it is necessary to specify how the magnitude is measured for the value to be meaningful. For this purpose the [[UBV system]] is widely used, in which the magnitude is measured in three different wavelength bands: U (centred at about 350&amp;nbsp;nm, in the near [[ultraviolet]]), B (about 435&amp;nbsp;nm, in the blue region) and V (about 555&amp;nbsp;nm, in the middle of the human visual range in daylight). The V band was chosen for spectral purposes and gives magnitudes closely corresponding to those seen by the light-adapted human eye, and when an apparent magnitude is given without any further qualification, it is usually the V magnitude that is meant, more or less the same as '''visual magnitude'''.

Since cooler stars, such as [[red giant]]s and [[red dwarf]]s, emit little energy in the blue and UV regions of the spectrum their power is often under-represented by the UBV scale. Indeed, some [[stellar classification|L and T class]] stars have an estimated magnitude of well over 100, since they emit extremely little visible light, but are strongest in [[infrared]].

Measures of magnitude need cautious treatment and it is extremely important to measure like with like. On early 20th century and older orthochromatic (blue-sensitive) [[photographic film]], the relative brightnesses of the blue [[supergiant]] [[Rigel]] and the red supergiant [[Betelgeuse]] irregular variable star (at maximum) are reversed compared to what our eyes see since this archaic film is more sensitive to blue light than it is to red light. Magnitudes obtained from this method are known as [[photographic magnitude]]s, and are now considered obsolete.

For objects within our Galaxy with a given [[absolute magnitude]], 5 is added to the apparent magnitude for every tenfold increase in the distance to the object. This relationship does not apply for objects at very great distances (far beyond our galaxy), since a correction for [[General Relativity]] must then be taken into account due to the non-Euclidean nature of space.

For planets and other solar system bodies the apparent magnitude is derived from its [[Phase curve (astronomy)|phase curve]] and the distances to the Sun and observer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|the brightness of stars|the science fiction magazine|Absolute Magnitude (magazine)}}

'''Absolute magnitude''' (also known as '''absolute visual magnitude''' when measured in the standard V photometric band) is the measure of a celestial object's intrinsic brightness. In [[astronomy]], to derive absolute magnitude from the observed [[apparent magnitude]] of a celestial object its value is corrected from distance to its observer. The absolute magnitude then equals the [[apparent magnitude]] an object would have if it were at a standard [[luminosity distance]] (10&amp;nbsp;[[parsec]]) away from the [[Observation|observer]], in the absence of [[Extinction (astronomy)|astronomical extinction]].
It allows the true brightnesses of objects to be compared without regard to distance.
'''Bolometric magnitude''' is [[luminosity]] expressed in magnitude units; it takes into account energy radiated at all wavelengths, whether observed or not.

The absolute magnitude uses the same convention as the visual [[magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]: a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;0.4&lt;/sup&gt; (≈2.512) ratio of [[brightness]] corresponds to a difference of 1.0 in magnitude. The [[Milky Way]], for example, has an absolute magnitude of about −20.5. So a [[quasar]] at an absolute magnitude of −25.5 is 100 times brighter than our [[galaxy]] (because (10&lt;sup&gt;0.4&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;(-20.5-(-25.5))&lt;/sup&gt; = (10&lt;sup&gt;0.4&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = 100). If this particular quasar and our galaxy could be seen side by side at the same distance, the quasar would be 5 magnitudes (or 100 times) brighter than our galaxy.

== Stars and galaxies (''M'') ==
In stellar and galactic astronomy, the standard distance is 10 parsecs (about 32.616 light years, or 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; kilometres).
A star at 10 parsecs has a [[parallax]] of 0.1&quot; (100 milli arc seconds).
For galaxies (which are of course themselves much larger than 10 parsecs, and whose overall brightness cannot be directly observed from relatively short distances) the absolute magnitude is defined by reference to the apparent brightness of a point-like or star-like source of the same total luminosity as the galaxy, as it would appear if observed at the standard 10 parsecs distance.

In defining absolute magnitude one must specify the type of [[electromagnetic radiation]] being measured. When referring to total energy output, the proper term is [[bolometer|bolometric]] magnitude. The bolometric magnitude can be computed from the visual magnitude plus a [[bolometric correction]], &lt;math&gt;M_{bol}=M_V+BC&lt;/math&gt;. This correction is needed because very hot stars radiate mostly ultraviolet radiation, while very cool stars radiate mostly infrared radiation (see [[Planck's law]]). The dimmer an object (at a distance of 10 parsecs) would appear, the higher its absolute magnitude. The lower an object's absolute magnitude, the higher its [[luminosity]]. A [[mathematical equation]] relates apparent magnitude to absolute magnitude, via parallax.

Many stars visible to the naked eye have a such a low absolute magnitude that they would appear bright enough to cast shadows if they were only 10 parsecs from the Earth: [[Rigel]] (−7.0), [[Deneb]] (−7.2), [[Zeta Puppis|Naos]] (−6.0), and [[Betelgeuse]] (−5.6). For comparison, [[Sirius]] has an absolute magnitude of 1.4 which is greater than the [[Sun]]'s absolute visual magnitude of 4.83 (it actually serves as a reference point). The Sun's absolute bolometric magnitude is 4.75.{{Clarify|date=June 2009|reason=needs better rewrite to avoid confusing the layman; also avoid comparing &quot;absolute magnitude&quot; with &quot;absolute visual magnitude&quot; and then mentioning &quot;bolometric&quot; - this just confuses}}

Absolute magnitudes of stars generally range from −10 to +17. The absolute magnitudes of galaxies can be much lower (brighter). For example, the giant [[elliptical galaxy]] [[Elliptical Galaxy M87|M87]] has an absolute magnitude of −22 (i.e. as bright as about 60,000 stars of magnitude -10).

=== Computation ===
One can compute the absolute magnitude &lt;math&gt;M\!\,&lt;/math&gt; of an object given its apparent magnitude &lt;math&gt;m\!\,&lt;/math&gt; and luminosity distance &lt;math&gt;D_L\!\,&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; M = m - 5 ((\log_{10}{D_L}) - 1)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!-- See the distance modulus article for support for this formula. --&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;D_L\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the star's luminosity distance in parsecs, wherein 1 parsec is approximately 3.2616 light-years. For very large distances, [[cosmological redshift]] complicates the relation between absolute and apparent magnitude, and an additional [[k correction]] might be required.

For nearby astronomical objects (such as stars in our galaxy) luminosity distance ''D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is almost identical to the real distance to the object, because spacetime within our galaxy is almost Euclidean. For much more distant objects the Euclidean approximation is not valid, and [[General Relativity]] must be taken into account when calculating the luminosity distance of an object.

In the Euclidean approximation for nearby objects, the absolute magnitude &lt;math&gt;M\!\,&lt;/math&gt; of a star can be calculated from its apparent magnitude and parallax:
:&lt;math&gt; M = m + 5 (\log_{10}{p} + 1)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where p is the star's parallax in arcseconds.

You can also compute the absolute magnitude &lt;math&gt;M\!\,&lt;/math&gt; of an object given its apparent magnitude &lt;math&gt;m\!\,&lt;/math&gt; and [[distance modulus]] &lt;math&gt;\mu\!\,&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; M = m - {\mu}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

==== Examples ====
Rigel has a visual magnitude of &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;m_V = 0.18&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt; and distance about 773 light-years
:&lt;math&gt;M_V = 0.18 - 5 \cdot (\log_{10} \frac{773}{3.2616} - 1) = -6.7&lt;/math&gt;

[[Vega]] has a parallax of 0.129&quot;, and an apparent magnitude of +0.03
:&lt;math&gt;M_V = 0.03 + 5 \cdot (1 +\log_{10}{0.129}) = +0.6&lt;/math&gt;

[[Alpha Centauri A]] has a parallax of 0.742&quot; and an apparent magnitude of −0.01
:&lt;math&gt;M_V = -0.01 + 5 \cdot (1 +\log_{10}{0.742}) = +4.3&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Black Eye Galaxy]] has a visual magnitude of m&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;=+9.36 and a distance modulus of 31.06.
:&lt;math&gt;M_V = 9.36 - 31.06 = -21.7&lt;/math&gt;

=== Apparent magnitude ===
{{Main|Apparent magnitude}}

Given the absolute magnitude &lt;math&gt;M\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, for objects within our galaxy you can also calculate the apparent magnitude &lt;math&gt;m\!\,&lt;/math&gt; from any distance &lt;math&gt;d\!\,&lt;/math&gt; (in parsecs):

:&lt;math&gt; m = M + 5 (\log_{10}{d} - 1)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

For objects at very great distances (outside our galaxy) the luminosity distance ''D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' must be used instead of ''d'' (in parsecs).

Given the absolute magnitude &lt;math&gt;M\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, you can also compute apparent magnitude &lt;math&gt;m\!\,&lt;/math&gt; from its parallax &lt;math&gt;p\!\,&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; m = M - 5 (\log_{10}p + 1)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Also calculating absolute magnitude &lt;math&gt;M\!\,&lt;/math&gt; from distance modulus &lt;math&gt;\mu\!\,&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; m = M + {\mu}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

=== Bolometric magnitude ===
[[Bolometer|Bolometric]] magnitude corresponds to [[luminosity]], expressed in magnitude units; that is, after taking into account all [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] wavelengths, including those unobserved due to instrumental pass-band, the Earth's atmospheric absorption, or extinction by interstellar dust. For stars, in the absence of extensive observations at many wavelengths, it usually must be computed assuming an [[effective temperature]].

== Solar System bodies (''H'') ==
For [[planets]], [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s a different definition of absolute magnitude is used which is more meaningful for nonstellar objects.

In this case, the absolute magnitude is defined as the [[apparent magnitude]] that the object would have if it were one [[astronomical unit]] (au) from both the [[Sun]] and the observer. Because the object is illuminated by the Sun absolute magnitude is a function of [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]] and this relationship is referred to as the [[Phase curve (astronomy)|phase curve]].

To convert a stellar or galactic absolute magnitude into a planetary one, subtract 31.57.

=== Apparent magnitude ===
The absolute magnitude can be used to help calculate the apparent magnitude of a body under different conditions.

:&lt;math&gt;m = H + 2.5 \log_{10}{(\frac{d_{BS}^2 d_{BO}^2}{p(\chi) d_0^4})}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;d_0\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is 1 au, &lt;math&gt;\chi\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], the angle between the Sun-Body and Body-Observer lines; by the [[law of cosines]], we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos{\chi} = \frac{ d_{BO}^2 + d_{BS}^2 - d_{OS}^2 } {2 d_{BO} d_{BS}}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p(\chi)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[phase integral]] (integration of reflected light; a number in the 0 to 1 range)
:Example: (An [[Lambertian diffuse lighting model|ideal diffuse reflecting]] [[sphere]]) - A reasonable first approximation for planetary bodies

&lt;math&gt;p(\chi) = \frac{2}{3} ( (1 - \frac{\chi}{\pi}) \cos{\chi} + (1/\pi) \sin{\chi} )\!\,&lt;/math&gt;
: A full-phase diffuse sphere reflects ⅔ as much light as a diffuse disc of the same diameter
: Distances:
:: &lt;math&gt;d_{BO}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the observer and the body
:: &lt;math&gt;d_{BS}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the Sun and the body
:: &lt;math&gt;d_{OS}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the observer and the Sun

Note: because Solar System bodies are never perfect diffuse reflectors, astronomers use empirically derived relationships to predict apparent magnitudes when accuracy is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.shatters.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Example ====
Moon
: &lt;math&gt;H_{Moon}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; = +0.25
: &lt;math&gt;d_{OS}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;d_{BS}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; = 1 au
: &lt;math&gt;d_{BO}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; = 384.5&amp;nbsp;Mm = 2.57 mau

: How bright is the Moon from Earth?
:: Full Moon: &lt;math&gt;\chi\!\,&lt;/math&gt; = 0, (&lt;math&gt;p(\chi)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 2/3)
::: &lt;math&gt;m_{Moon} = 0.25 + 2.5 \log_{10}{(\frac{3}{2} 0.00257^2)} = -12.26\!\,&lt;/math&gt;
::: (Actual -12.7) A full Moon reflects 30% more light at full phase than a perfect diffuse reflector predicts.
:: Quarter Moon: &lt;math&gt;\chi\!\,&lt;/math&gt; = 90°, &lt;math&gt;p(\chi) \approx \frac{2}{3\pi}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; (if diffuse reflector)
::: &lt;math&gt;m_{Moon} = 0.25 + 2.5 \log_{10}{(\frac{3\pi}{2} 0.00257^2)} = -11.02\!\,&lt;/math&gt;
::: (Actual approximately -11.0) The diffuse reflector formula does better for smaller phases.

'''Apollo 1''' (also designated '''Apollo Saturn-204''' and '''AS-204''') was scheduled to be the first manned mission of the [[Apollo program|Apollo manned lunar landing program]], with a target launch date of February 21, 1967. A cabin fire during a launch pad test on January 27 at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Launch Pad 34]] at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] killed all three crew members: Command Pilot [[Gus Grissom|Virgil &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom]], Senior Pilot [[Edward Higgins White|Edward H. White]] and Pilot [[Roger Chaffee|Roger B. Chaffee]]; and destroyed the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MarAprChron&quot;/&gt;  The mission name ''Apollo 1'', chosen by the crew, was officially retired by [[NASA]] in commemoration of them on April 24, 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarAprChron&quot;/&gt;

Immediately after the fire, NASA convened the '''Apollo 204 Accident Review Board''' to determine the cause of the fire. Although the ignition source was never conclusively identified, the astronauts' deaths were attributed to a wide range of lethal design and construction flaws in the early Apollo Command Module. The manned phase of the project was delayed for twenty months while these problems were corrected. 

The [[Saturn IB]] launch vehicle, SA-204, scheduled for use on this mission, was later used for the first unmanned [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] test flight, [[Apollo 5]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasm.si.edu/research/arch/findaids/bellcomm/bci_sec_21.html&lt;/ref&gt; The first successful manned Apollo mission was flown by Apollo 1's backup crew on [[Apollo 7]] in October, 1968.

==Mission background==
[[File:Apollo One CM arrival KSC.jpg|thumb|right|Command Module 012, christened ''Apollo One'', arrives at Kennedy Space Center, August 26, 1966.]]

AS-204 was to be the first manned test flight of a Command and Service Module (CSM) to Earth orbit, launched on a [[Saturn IB]] rocket. The Command and Service Modules, CSM-012, were a [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Development history|Block I]] version designed before the [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] landing strategy was chosen, and therefore lacked docking equipment needed for mating to the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]]. Two manned Block I missions were planned (the second being cancelled later in 1966), to be followed by flights of the Block II version, which contained the LM docking equipment and would incorporate lessons learned in Block I.
AS-204 was to test launch operations, ground tracking and control facilities and the performance of the Apollo-Saturn launch assembly and would have lasted up to two weeks, depending on how the spacecraft performed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#moonport|Benson 1978]]: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch18-1.html Chapter 18-1 - The Fire That Seared The Spaceport, &quot;Introduction&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA announced on March 21, 1966 that Grissom, White and Chaffee had been selected to fly the first manned mission. At the time, NASA was studying the possibility of flying the mission as a joint [[space rendezvous]] with the final [[Project Gemini]] mission, [[Gemini 12]] in November 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HIwyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=krcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=apollo&amp;pg=4087%2C7171310 &quot;3 Crewmen Picked For 1st Apollo Flight&quot;], ''Palm Beach Post'', March 21, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; But by May, delays in making the basic Apollo design ready for flight, and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WjNbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jU8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=apollo&amp;pg=1914%2C190638 &quot;Apollo Shot May Come This Year&quot;], ''UPI story, Bonham Daily Favorite newspaper'', May 5, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; This became academic when slippage in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967. Grissom was resolved to keep his craft in orbit for a full 14 days if there was any way to do so.

[[File:Apollo1 Crew im Simulator.jpg|thumb|right|Chaffee, White, and Grissom training in a simulator of their Command Module cabin, January 19, 1967.]]
A newspaper article published on August 4, 1966 referred to the flight as &quot;Apollo 1&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Open End' Orbit Planned for Apollo |accessdate=Nov. 11, 2010 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Press| date=Aug. 4, 1966 |agency=UPI |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ReojAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UU8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=apollo-1&amp;pg=7152%2C998301 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; When CM-012 arrived at the Kennedy Space Center on August 26, it was christened ''Apollo One'' on its packaging.

In October 1966 NASA announced the flight would carry a small [[television]] camera to broadcast live from the Command Module. The camera would also be used to allow flight controllers to monitor the spacecraft's instrument panel in flight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lescAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=z2UEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=apollo%20television%20camera&amp;pg=3988%2C2557539 &quot;Apollo To Provide Live Space Shots&quot;], ''Sarasota Herald-Tribune newspaper'', Oct 13, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Television cameras were carried aboard all manned Apollo missions.

AS-204 was intended to be followed by two more Apollo missions in the summer and late autumn of 1967. The second manned mission would have launched a Block II CSM (AS-205) on a Saturn IB, which would rendezvous and dock in low Earth orbit with a LM launched on a second, unmanned Saturn IB (AS-208). [[James McDivitt]], [[David Scott]] and [[Rusty Schweikart]] were named to fly this mission, and had started their training in the first Block II CM-101, when the AS-204 accident occurred. The third manned mission would have launched the CSM and LM together on a [[Saturn V]] (AS-503) to an elliptical [[medium Earth orbit]], to be crewed by [[Frank Borman]], [[Michael Collins]] and [[William Anders]].

===Mission insignia===
Grissom's crew received approval in June 1966 to design a mission patch with the name ''Apollo 1''. The design's center depicts a Command/Service Module flying over the southeastern United States with [[Florida]] (the launch point) prominent. The Moon is seen in the distance, symbolic of the eventual program goal. A yellow border carries the mission and astronaut names with another border set with stars and stripes, trimmed in gold. The insignia was designed by the crew, with the artwork done by North American employee Allen Stevens.&lt;ref&gt;

===Spacecraft problems===
[[Image:A1prayer.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The ''Apollo 1'' crew expressed their concerns about fire hazards and other problems by presenting this photo to ASPO manager Joseph Shea on August 19, 1966.]]
The Apollo Command/Service Module spacecraft, built by [[North American Aviation]], was much bigger and far more complex than any previously implemented spacecraft design. In October 1963, [[Joseph Francis Shea|Dr. Joseph F. Shea]] was named Apollo Spacecraft Program Office (ASPO) manager, responsible for managing the design and construction of both the CSM and the LM.
When North American shipped spacecraft CM-012 to [[Kennedy Space Center]] on August 26, 1966, there were 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes, and an additional 623 engineering change orders were made after delivery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/Apollo204/find.html Report of Apollo 204 Review Board]&lt;/ref&gt; Grissom was so frustrated with the inability of the training simulator engineers to keep up with the actual spacecraft changes, that he took a lemon from a tree by his house,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/zorn/grissom.htm |work=Detailed Biographies of Apollo I Crew |title=Gus Grissom |publisher=NASA History |accessdate=2008-07-29 |first=White |last=Mary C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hung it on the simulator.&lt;ref name='chariots8-7'&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/contents.html|title=Chariots for Apollo: A History of Manned Lunar Spacecraft|author=Courtney G Brooks, James M.

In a spacecraft review meeting held with Shea on August 19, 1966 (a week before delivery), the crew expressed concern about the amount of flammable material (mainly [[nylon]] netting and [[Velcro]]) in the cabin, which the technicians found convenient for holding tools and equipment in place. Though Shea gave the spacecraft a passing grade, after the meeting they gave him a crew portrait they had posed with heads bowed and hands clasped in prayer, with the inscription:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It isn't that we don't trust you, Joe, but this time we've decided to go over your head.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Charles, &amp; Cox, Catherine. ''Apollo: The Race to the Moon'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1989), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Shea gave his staff orders to tell North American to remove the flammables from the cabin, but did not supervise the issue personally.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and Cox, ''Apollo'', p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|You sort of have to put that out of your mind. There's always a possibility that you can have a catastrophic failure, of course; this can happen on any flight; it can happen on the last one as well as the first one. So, you just plan as best you can to take care of all these eventualities, and you get a well-trained crew and you go fly.|Gus Grissom, in a December 1966 interview|&lt;ref&gt;

==Accident==
{{ref improve section|date=January 2011}}

===Plugs-out test===
The January 27, 1967, launch simulation, officially considered not hazardous because the Saturn IB was not loaded with fuel, was a &quot;plugs-out&quot; test to determine whether the spacecraft would operate nominally on internal power while detached from all cables and umbilicals. There was hope that if the spacecraft passed this and subsequent tests, it would be ready to fly on February 21, 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;SP4029&quot;&gt;{{cite web |work=NASA Special Publication-4029 |url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_01a_Summary.htm |title=Apollo 1: The Fire 27&amp;nbsp;January 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 1:00 PM (1800 GMT) on January 27 Grissom, White and Chaffee entered the command module fully suited, were strapped into their seats and hooked up to the spacecraft's systems in preparation for the plugs-out test. There were immediate problems. A sour &quot;buttermilk&quot; smell in the air circulating through Grissom's suit delayed the launch simulation until 2:42 PM. Three minutes later the hatch was sealed and high-pressure pure oxygen began replacing the air in the cabin.

Further problems included episodes of high oxygen flow apparently linked to movements by the astronauts in their flightsuits. There were also faulty communications between the crew, the control room, the [[Operations and Checkout Building|operations and checkout building]] and the complex 34 blockhouse. &quot;How are we going to get to the Moon if we can't talk between three buildings?&quot; Grissom complained in frustration over the communication loop. This put the launch simulation on hold again at 5:40. Most countdown functions had been successfully completed by 6:20 but the countdown was still holding at T minus 10 minutes at 6:30 with all cables and umbilicals still attached to the command module while attempts were made to fix the communication problem.

===Fire===
[[Image:Apollo 1 fire.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Charred remains of the Apollo 1 [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command module]]]]
The crew members were reclining in their horizontal couches, running through a checklist when a voltage transient was recorded at 6:30:54 (23:30:54 GMT). Ten seconds later (at 6:31:04) Chaffee said, &quot;Hey...&quot; Scuffling sounds followed for three seconds before Grissom shouted &quot;Fire!&quot; Chaffee then reported, &quot;We've got a fire in the cockpit,&quot; and White said &quot;Fire in the cockpit!&quot; After 12 seconds,&lt;ref name=&quot;shayler2000&quot;/&gt; Chaffee yelled, &quot;We've got a bad fire! Let's get out! We're burning up! We're on fire!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;shayler2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Disasters and accidents in manned spaceflight|year=2000|publisher=Springer|author=David Shayler|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rwo-dmh06&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Apollo: the definitive sourcebook|year=2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business|author=Richard W. Orloff|coauthors=David Michael Harland|page=114
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some witnesses said they saw Ed White on the television monitors, reaching for the hatch release handle as flames in the cabin spread from left to right and licked the window. Only 17 seconds after the first indication by crew of any fire, the transmission ended abruptly at 6:31:21 with a cry as the cabin ruptured after rapidly expanding gases from the fire overpressurized the CM to 29 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]] (200 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]) and burst the cabin interior.&lt;ref name=&quot;sea4&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of Apollo 204 Review Board |chapter=Memorandum |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/Apollo204/seamans.html |publisher=NASA History Office |date=1967-04-05 |first=Robert C., Jr. |last=Seamans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flames and gases then rushed outside the command module through open access panels to two levels of the pad service structure. Intense heat, dense smoke, and ineffective gas masks designed for toxic fumes rather than heavy smoke hampered the ground crew's attempts to rescue the men. There were fears the command module had exploded, or soon would, and that the fire might ignite the solid fuel rockets in the launch escape tower above the command module, likely killing nearby ground personnel. It took five minutes to open the inner and outer hatches, a set of three with many ratchets.&lt;ref name=&quot;SP4029&quot;/&gt;

By this time the fire in the command module, robbed of its high-pressure pure oxygen environment, had gone out. Although the cabin lights remained lit, the ground crew was at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared they found the bodies but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted the astronauts' nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom's body was found lying mostly on the deck. His and White's suits were fused together. The body of Ed White (whom mission protocol had tasked with opening the hatch) was lying back in his center couch. White would not have been able to open the inward-opening hatch against the internal pressure. Chaffee's job was to shut down the spacecraft systems and maintain communications with ground control. His body was still strapped into the right-hand seat.&lt;ref name=&quot;SP4029&quot;/&gt;

==Aftermath==
As a result of the in-flight failure of the [[Gemini 8]] mission on March 17, 1966, NASA Deputy Administrator [[Robert Seamans|Dr. Robert Seamans]] wrote and implemented '''Management Instruction 8621.1''' on April 14, 1966, defining '''Mission Failure Investigation Policy And Procedures'''. This modified NASA's existing accident procedures, based on military aircraft accident investigation, by giving the Deputy Administrator the option of performing independent investigations of &quot;major failures&quot;, beyond those failure investigations for which the various Program Office officials were normally responsible. It declared: &quot;It is NASA policy to investigate and document the causes of all major mission failures which occur in the conduct of its space and aeronautical activities and to take appropriate corrective actions as a result of the findings and recommendations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; 

Immediately after the ''Apollo 1'' fire, Seamans directed establishment of the '''Apollo 204 Review Board''' chaired by [[Langley Research Center]] director Dr. Floyd L. Thompson, which included astronaut [[Frank Borman]], spacecraft designer [[Maxime Faget]], and six others. To avoid the possible appearance of a conflict of interest, NASA Administrator [[James E. Webb]] got the approval of President [[Lyndon Johnson]] for an internal NASA investigation, and notified appropriate leaders of Congress. Seamans immediately ordered all ''Apollo 1'' hardware and software impounded, to be released only under control of the Board. On February 3, two members, a Cornell University professor and North American's Chief engineer for Apollo, left the Board, and a [[United States Bureau of Mines|U.S. Bureau of Mines]] professor joined. After thorough [[stereoscopy|stereo photographic]] documentation of the CM-012 interior, the board ordered its disassembly using procedures tested by disassembling the identical CM-014, and conducted a thorough investigation of every part. The board also reviewed the astronauts' autopsy results and interviewed witnesses. Seamans sent Webb weekly status reports of the investigation's progress, and the Board issued its final report on April 5, 1967.

According to the Board, Grissom suffered severe [[third degree burns]] on over a third of his body and his spacesuit was mostly destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on almost half of his body and a quarter of his spacesuit had melted away. Chaffee suffered third degree burns over almost a quarter of his body and a small portion of his spacesuit was damaged. It was later confirmed the crew had died of [[smoke inhalation]] with burns contributing.&lt;ref name=&quot;sea5&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert C., Jr. |last=Seamans |publisher=NASA History Office |title=Report of Apollo 204 Review Board |chapter=Findings, Determinations And Recommendations |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/Apollo204/find.html |date=1967-04-05 |accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later lawsuits brought by Gus Grissom's widow Betty Grissom there were claims the astronauts had lived longer than NASA claimed publicly.&lt;ref&gt;See Dennis E. Powell, &quot;Obviously, A Major Malfunction&quot; ''Miami [Fla.] Herald'' Sunday magazine, November 13, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The review board found the documentation for CM-012 so lacking that they were at times unable to determine what had been installed in the spacecraft or what was in it at the time of the accident.

===Cause===
====Pure oxygen atmosphere====
[[File:Apollo 1 crew prepare to enter their spacecraft in the altitude chamber at Kennedy Space Center.jpg|thumb|right|The Apollo 1 crew enters their spacecraft in the [[altitude chamber]] at Kennedy Space Center, October 18, 1966.]]
The plugs-out test had been run to simulate the launch procedure, with the cabin pressurized with pure oxygen at the nominal pre-launch level of {{convert|16.7|psi|kPa}}, 2 psi above standard sea level atmospheric pressure. This is more than five times the 3 psi partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere, and provides an environment in which materials not normally considered highly flammable will burst into flame.

The high-pressure oxygen atmosphere was consistent with that used in the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] programs. The pressure before launch was deliberately greater than ambient in order to drive out the nitrogen-containing air and replace it with pure oxygen. After liftoff, the pressure would have been reduced to the in-flight level of {{convert|5|psi|kPa}}, providing sufficient oxygen for the astronauts to breathe while greatly reducing the fire risk. The Apollo 1 crew had successfully tested this procedure with their spacecraft in a KSC altitude (vacuum) chamber in October 1966.

When designing Mercury, NASA had considered using a nitrogen/oxygen mixture to reduce the fire risk near launch, but rejected it based on two considerations. First, nitrogen used with the in-flight pressure reduction carried the clear risk of [[decompression sickness]] (known as &quot;the bends&quot;). But the decision to eliminate the use of any gas but oxygen was crystalized when a serious accident occurred on April 21, 1960, in which [[McDonnell Aircraft]] test pilot G.B. North passed out and nearly died when testing a Mercury cabin / spacesuit atmosphere system in a vacuum chamber. The problem was found to be nitrogen-rich (oxygen-poor) air leaking from the cabin into his spacesuit feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

North American Aviation had suggested using an oxygen/nitrogen mixture for Apollo, but NASA overruled this. The pure oxygen design also carried the benefit of saving weight, by eliminating the need for nitrogen tanks.

In a BBC documentary ''NASA: Triumph and Tragedy'', Jim McDivitt said that NASA had no idea how 100% oxygen atmosphere would influence burning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1466415/&lt;/ref&gt; Similar remarks by other astronauts were expressed in the documentary ''In the Shadow of the Moon''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0925248&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy Administrator Seamans has said that NASA's single worst mistake in engineering judgement was not to run a fire test on the Command Module.

====Electrical and plumbing problems====
The investigation also found much substandard wiring and plumbing in the craft. Hence, the fire was at first believed to have been caused by a spark somewhere in the over {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} of wiring threaded throughout the Command Module.

The review board noted a [[silver]]-plated [[copper]] wire running through an environmental control unit near the center couch had become stripped of its [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] insulation and abraded by repeated opening and closing of a small access door. This weak point in the wiring also ran near a junction in an [[ethylene glycol]]/water cooling line which was known to be prone to leaks. The [[electrolysis]] of ethylene glycol solution with the silver [[anode]] was a notable hazard which could cause a violent [[exothermic reaction]], igniting the ethylene glycol mixture in the CM's corrosive test atmosphere of pure, high-pressure oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA history SP-4009 |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/v4p2b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1967 a vice president of North American Aviation, John McCarthy, speculated that Grissom had accidentally &quot;scuffed the insulation of a wire&quot; whilst moving about the spacecraft but his remarks were ignored by the review board and strongly rejected by a congressional committee. [[Frank Borman]], who had been the first astronaut to go inside the burned spacecraft, testified, &quot;We found no evidence to support the thesis that Gus, or any of the crew members kicked the wire that ignited the flammables.&quot; A 1978 history of the accident written internally by NASA said at the time, &quot;the spark that led to the fire still has wide currency at Kennedy Space Center. Men differ, however, on the cause of the scuff.&quot; ([[#moonport|Benson 1978]]: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch18-6.html Chapter 18-6 - The Fire That Seared The Spaceport, &quot;The Review Board&quot;], retrieved May 12, 2008) Soon after making his comment McCarthy had said, &quot;I only brought it up as a hypothesis.&quot; ({{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843575-2,00.html  |work=Time Magazine |title=Blind Spot |date=1967-04-21 |accessdate=2008-05-21}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 a team of MIT physicists went to Cape Kennedy and performed a static discharge test in the CM-103 command module while it was being prepared for the launch of [[Apollo 8]]. With an [[electroscope]], they measured the approximate energy of static discharges caused by a test crew dressed in nylon flight pressure suits and reclining on the nylon flight seats. The MIT investigators found sufficient energy for ignition discharged repeatedly when crew-members shifted in their seats and then touched the spacecraft's aluminum panels.

However, the ignition source for the Apollo 1 fire was never officially determined.&lt;ref name=&quot;sea5&quot;/&gt;

====Flammable materials in the cabin====
The review board cited how the NASA crew systems department had installed {{convert|34|sqft|m2}} of Velcro throughout the spacecraft, almost like carpeting. This Velcro was found to be explosive in a high-pressure 100% oxygen environment. Up to 70 pounds of other non-metallic flammable materials had also crept into the design. [[Buzz Aldrin]] states in his book ''Men From Earth'' that the flammable material had been removed (per the crew's August 19 complaints and Joseph Shea's order), but was replaced prior to the August 26 delivery to Cape Kennedy.

====Hatch design====
The higher than ambient cabin pressure made it impossible for the crew to remove the inward-opening hatch to escape, until the excess cabin pressure had been vented. It was Grissom's job to open the cabin vent, but he was closest to the fire's point of origin and was obviously unable to do this.

North American had originally suggested the hatch open outward and carry [[explosive bolt]]s to blow the hatch in case of emergency, as had been done in Project Mercury. [[NASA]] didn't agree, arguing the hatch could accidentally open, as it had on Grissom's ''[[Liberty Bell 7]]'' flight. 

Before the fire, astronauts successfully lobbied for an outward-opening hatch, which ironically was planned to be included on the Block II Command Module, even in absence of the fire. NASA claimed this was based on ease of exit and entry for spacewalks, and getting out of the CM after splashdown.&lt;ref name=&quot;port182&quot;&gt;[[#moonport|Benson 1978]]: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch18-2.html Chapter 18-2 - The Fire That Seared The Spaceport, &quot;Predictions of Trouble&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political fallout===
[[Image:NASA Administration Before the Senate Regarding Apollo 1 - GPN-2002-000084.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Deputy Administrator Seamans, Administrator Webb, Manned Space Flight Administrator [[George E. Mueller]], and Apollo Program Director Phillips testify before a Senate hearing on the Apollo accident.]]
Committees in both houses of the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] with oversight of the space program soon launched their own investigations, including the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences|Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences]], chaired by Senator [[Clinton P. Anderson]]. Seamans, Webb, Manned Space Flight Administrator [[George Mueller (NASA)|Dr. George Mueller]], and Apollo Program Director [[Major General (United States)|Maj Gen]] [[Samuel C. Phillips]] were called to testify before Sen. Anderson's committee.

In the February 27 hearing, Senator [[Walter F. Mondale]] asked Webb if he knew of a &quot;report&quot; of extraordinary problems with the performance of [[North American Aviation]] on the Apollo contract. Webb replied he did not, and deferred to his subordinates on the witness panel. Mueller and Phillips responded they too were unaware of any such &quot;report&quot;.

However, in late 1965, just over one year before the accident, Phillips had headed a &quot;[[tiger team]]&quot; investigating the causes of inadequate quality, schedule delays, and cost overruns in both the Apollo CSM and the Saturn V second stage (for which North American was also prime contractor.) He gave an oral presentation (with transparencies) of his team's findings to Mueller and Seamans, and also presented them in a memo to North American president [[Lee Atwood]], to which Mueller appended his own strongly worded memo to Atwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Mondale said he had been told of the existence of the &quot;Phillips report&quot;, and Seamans was afraid that Mondale might be in possession of a hard copy of the presentation, so he said tentatively that contractors have occasionally been given negative reviews, but that he knew of no such extraordinary report. Mondale raised controversy over &quot;the Phillips Report&quot;, despite Phillips' refusal to characterize it as such before Congress, and was angered by what he perceived as Webb's deception and concealment of important program problems from Congress, and questioned NASA's selection of North American as prime contractor.&lt;ref&gt;On May 11, Webb issued a statement defending the selection. On June 9, Seamans filed a seven-page memorandum documenting the process that led to North American's selection in November 1961. {{cite web | url = http://www.astronautix.com/craft/csmction.htm | title = CSM Source Selection | publisher = Encyclopedia Astronautica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webb eventually provided a controlled copy of Phillips' memo to Congress.

Seamans later wrote that Webb roundly chastised him in the cab ride leaving the hearing, for volunteering information which led to the disclosure of Phillips' memo.

The committee concluded in its final report that &quot;the findings of the [Phillips] task force had no effect on the accident, did not lead to the accident, and were not related to the accident,&quot; but in its recommendations, stated &quot;the committee believes it should have been informed of the situation.&quot; Freshman Senators [[Edward Brooke]] and [[Charles H. Percy]] jointly wrote an &quot;Additional Views&quot; section appended to the committe report, expressing a bit more strongly that the Phillips review should have been disclosed to Congress. Mondale wrote his own Additional View, voicing his complaints in the most strongly worded terms. 

The potential political threat to Apollo blew over, due in large part to the support of President [[Lyndon Johnson]], who at the time still wielded a measure of influence with the Congress from his own Senatorial experience. He was a staunch supporter of NASA since its inception, had even recommended the Moon program to President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1961, and was skilled at portraying it as part of Kennedy's legacy. 

But internal acrimony developed between NASA and North American over assignment of blame. North American argued unsuccessfully that it was not responsible for the fatal error in spacecraft atmosphere design. Finally, Webb contacted Atwood, and demanded that either he or Chief Engineer [[Harrison Storms|Harrison &quot;Stormy&quot; Storms]] resign. Atwood elected to fire Storms.&lt;ref&gt;Storms interview with historian [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] for BBC television &quot;The Other Side of the Moon.&quot; May 18, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

On the NASA side, Joseph Shea became unfit for duty in the aftermath and was removed from his position, although not fired.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Charles, &amp; Cox, Catherine. ''Apollo: The Race to the Moon'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1989), pp. 213–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previous oxygen fires==
In March 1961 Soviet [[cosmonaut]] [[Valentin Bondarenko]] died after a fire in a high-oxygen isolation chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Sputnik and the Soviet Space Challenge, Asif Siddiqi, page 266, ISBN 0-8130-2627-X&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Union|USSR]] concealed the tragedy for over 20 years, which subsequently caused some speculation as to whether or not the ''Apollo 1'' disaster might have been averted had NASA been aware of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Charles |first=John |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/797/1 |title=Could the CIA have prevented the Apollo 1 fire? |work=The Space Review |date=2007-01-29 |accessdate=2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1962, [[United States Air Force|USAF]] [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] B. Dean Smith was conducting a test of the [[Gemini space suit]] with a colleague in a pure oxygen chamber at [[Brooks Air Force Base]] in San Antonio, Texas, when a fire broke out, destroying the chamber. Smith and his partner narrowly escaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| isbn=978-1424125746 | title = The Fire That NASA Never Had | author= Colonel B. Dean Smith  | year = 2006 |publisher = PublishAmerica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fire hazards of a 100%-oxygen sea-level pressure environment had been well described by 1967 and many deaths from flash fires had been publicly reported during the 1950s and 1960s. A 1966 editorial in the journal ''Space/Aeronautics'' asserted &quot;The odds are that the first spaceflight casualty due to environmental exposure will occur not in space, but on the ground&quot;, and further noted that safety protocols for the Apollo project were thoroughly lacking.&lt;ref name=&quot;port182&quot;/&gt;

Other warnings on this hazard predating the fatal incident include these US reports, including one directly from NASA in Houston:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/research/arch/findaids/bellcomm/bci_print.html

===Command Module redesign===
After the fire, the Apollo project was grounded for review and re-design. The Command Module was found to be extremely hazardous and in some instances, carelessly assembled (for example, a misplaced socket wrench was found in the cabin.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was decided that remaining Block I spacecraft would only be used for unmanned Saturn V test flights. All manned missions would use the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Major differences between Block I and Block II|Block II spacecraft]], to which many Command Module design changes were made:

* The cabin atmosphere at launch was changed to 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen at sea-level pressure (14.7 psi or 1013 millibars). During ascent the cabin rapidly vented down to 5 psi (345 millibars), releasing approximately 2/3 of the gas originally present at launch. The vent then closed and the environmental control system maintained a nominal cabin pressure of 5 psi as the spacecraft continued into vacuum. The cabin was then very slowly purged (vented to space and simultaneously replaced with 100% oxygen), so the nitrogen concentration fell asymptotically to zero over the next day. Although the new cabin launch atmosphere was significantly safer than 100% oxygen, it still contained almost three times the amount of oxygen present in ordinary sea level air (20.9% oxygen). This was necessary to ensure a sufficient partial pressure of oxygen when the astronauts removed their helmets shortly after launch. (60% of 5 psi is 3 psi, compared to 20.9% of 14.7 psi, or 3.07 psi in sea-level air.)

* The environment within the astronauts' pressure suits was not changed. Because of the rapid drop in cabin (and suit) pressures during ascent, [[decompression sickness]] was likely unless the nitrogen had been purged from the astronauts' tissues prior to launch. They would still breathe pure oxygen, starting several hours before launch and continuing until orbital insertion. Avoiding the &quot;bends&quot; was considered worth the residual risk of an oxygen-accelerated fire within a suit.

* [[Nylon]] used in the [[Gemini space suit|Block I suit]]s was replaced in the [[Apollo/Skylab A7L|Block II suit]]s with [[Beta cloth]], a non-flammable, highly melt-resistant fabric woven from [[Glass (fiber)|fiberglass]] and coated with [[Teflon]].

* Block II had already been planned to use a completely redesigned hatch which opened outward, and could be opened in less than ten seconds. Concerns of accidental opening were addressed by using a cartridge of pressurized nitrogen to drive the release mechanism in an emergency, instead of the [[Pyrotechnic fastener|pyrotechnic bolts]] used on [[Project Mercury]].
* [[Flammable]] materials in the cabin were replaced with self-extinguishing versions.
* [[Plumbing]] and wiring were covered with protective [[thermal insulation|insulation]].
* 1,407 wiring problems were corrected.

Thorough protocols were implemented for documenting spacecraft construction and maintenance.

In July 2009, the 40th anniversary of the [[Apollo 11]] first Moon landing, archived notes made by Apollo astronauts [[Charles Duke]] and [[Jack Swigert]] on the accident investigation and re-design were donated to the [[Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center]] in [[Hutchinson, Kansas|Hutchinson]], and were digitized and made accessible on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.cosmo.org/2009/07/apollo-1-archive-at-cosmosphere.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===New mission naming scheme===
The astronauts' widows asked that ''Apollo 1'' be reserved for the flight their husbands never made, and on April 24, 1967, Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, Dr. [[George E. Mueller]], announced this change officially: AS-204 would be recorded as Apollo 1, &quot;first manned Apollo Saturn flight - failed on ground test.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MarAprChron&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Since three unmanned Apollo missions ([[AS-201]], [[AS-202]], and [[AS-203]]) had previously occurred, the next mission, the first unmanned [[Saturn V]] test flight (AS-501) would be designated [[Apollo 4]], with all subsequent flights numbered sequentially in the order flown.

The manned flight hiatus allowed work to catch up on the Saturn V and [[Apollo Lunar Module]], which were encountering their own delays. Apollo 4 flew in November 1967. Apollo 1's (AS-204) Saturn IB rocket was taken down from Launch Complex 34, later reassembled at Launch Complex 37B and used to launch [[Apollo 5]], an unmanned Earth orbital test flight of the first Lunar Module LM-1, in January 1968. A second unmanned Saturn V AS-502 flew as [[Apollo 6]] in April 1968, and Grissom's backup crew of [[Wally Schirra]], [[Don Eisele]], and [[Walter Cunningham]], finally flew the first manned mission AS-205, [[Apollo 7]], in a Block II CSM in October 1968.

==Memorials==
Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee were buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. Ed White was buried at [[West Point Cemetery|the cemetery]] of the [[United States Military Academy]] in [[West Point, New York]]. Their names are also enshrined on the [[Space Mirror Memorial]] at the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center|Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]] in [[Merritt Island, Florida]].

An Apollo 1 mission patch was left on the Moon's surface during the first manned lunar landing by [[Apollo 11]].

===Launch Complex 34===
{{Main|Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34}}
After the Apollo 1 fire, [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Launch Complex 34]] was subsequently used only for the launch of [[Apollo 7]] and later dismantled but the launch platform remains at the site ({{Coord|28.52182|N|80.561258|W|type:landmark_region:US-FL_scale:10000}}) along with a few other concrete and steel-reinforced structures. The launch platform bears two plaques noting the tragedy.

One reads: ''LAUNCH COMPLEX 34, Friday, 27&amp;nbsp;January 1967, 1831 Hours. Dedicated to the living memory of the crew of the Apollo 1: USAF. Lt. Colonel Virgil I. Grissom, USAF. Lt. Colonel Edward H. White, II, U.S.N. Lt. Commander Roger B. Chaffee. They gave their lives in service to their country in the ongoing exploration of humankind's final frontier. Remember them not for how they died but for those ideals for which they lived.''

The other reads: ''In memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice so others could reach for the stars; [[Ad astra per aspera]] (a rough road leads to the stars); God speed to the crew of Apollo 1''

In January 2005 three granite benches built by a college classmate of one of the astronauts, one for each member of the crew, were installed at the site on the southern edge of the launch pad. The benches bear the names of the astronauts and the military insignias of the services they represented. Each year the families of the Apollo 1 crew are invited to the site for a memorial, and the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Center offers a visit to the site for those who choose to take a special tour of the historic launch sites on Cape Canaveral.

===Stars, landmarks on the Moon and Mars===
* Apollo astronauts frequently aligned their spacecraft [[inertial navigation]] platforms and determined their positions relative to the Earth and Moon by sighting sets of stars with optical instruments. As a practical joke, the Apollo 1 crew named three of the stars in the Apollo catalog after themselves and introduced them into NASA documentation.

==Remains of CM-012==
The ''Apollo 1'' command module has never been on public display. After the accident, the spacecraft was removed and taken to Kennedy Space Center to facilitate the review board's disassembly in order to investigate the cause of the fire. When this was complete, it was moved to the NASA [[Langley Research Center]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]] and placed in a secured storage warehouse. 

On February 17, 2007 the wreckage of CM-012 was moved approximately {{convert|100|ft|m}} to a newer, environmentally controlled warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Weil |title=Ill-Fated Apollo 1 Capsule Moved to New Site |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/17/AR2007021701760.html|work=The Washington Post |page=C5 |date=2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few weeks earlier, Gus Grissom's brother Lowell publicly suggested CM-012 be permanently entombed in the concrete remains of [[Launch Complex 34]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fshtyx&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=Palm Beach Post |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/state/content/state/epaper/2007/01/27/0127apollo.html |title=Apollo 1 astronauts honored at Cape |date=2007-01-27 |accessdate=2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apollo 10''' was the fourth manned mission in the [[United States|American]] [[Apollo program|Apollo space program]]. It was an [[List of Apollo mission types|F type mission]]—its purpose was to be a &quot;dry run&quot; for the [[Apollo 11]] mission, testing all of the procedures and components of a [[Moon landing]] without actually landing on the [[Moon]] itself. The mission included the second crew to orbit the Moon and an all-up test of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) in lunar orbit. The LM came to within 8.4 [[nautical mile]]s (15.6&amp;nbsp;km) of the [[lunar surface]] during practice maneuvers.

According to the 2002 ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', Apollo 10 set the record for the highest speed attained by a manned vehicle at 39,897&amp;nbsp;km/h (11.08&amp;nbsp;km/s or 24,791&amp;nbsp;mph) during the return from the Moon on May 26, 1969.

Due to the use of their names only as [[callsign]]s, the ''[[Peanuts]]'' characters [[Charlie Brown]] and [[Snoopy]] became semi-official mascots for the mission.&lt;ref&gt;http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/images/images/pao/AS10/10075138.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/images/images/pao/AS10/10075088.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Peanuts'' creator [[Charles Schulz]] also drew some special mission-related artwork for [[NASA]].

===Crew notes===
By the normal rotation in place during Apollo, the backup crew would have been scheduled to fly on [[Apollo 13]]. However, [[Alan Shepard]] was given the command slot instead. Cooper was enraged and resigned from NASA. Later, Shepard's crew was forced to switch places with Jim Lovell's tentative [[Apollo 14]] crew.&lt;ref&gt;Chaikin, pp. 347-48&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Deke Slayton recollected in his memoirs that Cooper and Eisele were never intended to rotate to another mission as both were out of favor with NASA management for various reasons (Cooper for his lax attitude towards training and Eisele for incidents aboard [[Apollo 7]] and an extra-marital affair) and were assigned to the backup crew simply because of a lack of qualified manpower in the Astronaut Office at the time the assignment needed to be made. Cooper, Slayton noted, had a very small chance of receiving the Apollo 13 command if he did an outstanding job with the assignment, which he didn't. Eisele, despite his issues with management, was always intended for future assignment to the [[Apollo Applications Program]] (which was eventually cut down to only the [[Skylab]] component) and not a lunar mission.&lt;ref&gt;Donald K. Slayton, &quot;Deke!&quot; (New York: Forge, 1994), 236&lt;/ref&gt;

*May 22, 1969, 21:29:43 UTC

On May 22, 1969 at 20:35:02 UTC, a 27.4 second LM descent propulsion system burn inserted the LM into a descent orbit of {{convert|60.9|nmi|km}} by {{convert|8.5|nmi|km}} so that the resulting lowest point in the orbit occurred about 15° from lunar landing site 2 (the [[Apollo 11]] landing site). The lowest measured point in the trajectory was {{convert|47400|ft|km}} above the lunar surface at 21:29:43 UTC.&lt;ref name='chariots11-2'&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/contents.html|title=Chariots for Apollo: A History of Manned Lunar Spacecraft|author=Courtney G Brooks, James M.

==Mission highlights==
This dress rehearsal for a [[Moon landing]] brought Stafford and Cernan's lunar module ''[[Snoopy]]'' to 8.4 nautical miles (15.6&amp;nbsp;km) from the lunar surface. The low approach orbit was to refine the lunar gravitational potential&lt;ref name=&quot;nasa_apollo10&quot;/&gt; needed to calibrate the powered descent guidance system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |last=Eyles |first=Don |title=Tales From the Lunar Module Guidance Computer |url=http://klabs.org/history/apollo_11_alarms/eyles_2004/eyles_2004.htm |publisher=''NASA Office of Logic Design'' |date=2004-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to within 1 nautical mile (LR altitude update lock) needed for a landing.  Earth-based observations, unmanned spacecraft, and Apollo 8 respectively had allowed calibration to 200, 20, and 5 nautical miles.  Except for that final stretch, the mission went exactly as a landing would have gone, both in space and on the ground, where Apollo's extensive tracking and control network was put through a [[Dry Run (testing)|dry run]].

Shortly after leaving [[low Earth orbit]], the command/service module separated from the [[S-IVB]] stage, turned around, and docked its nose to the top of the lunar module still nestled in the S-IVB.  The CSM/LM stack then separated from the S-IVB for the trip to the moon.

Apollo 10 carried the first [[color television]] camera inside the spacecraft, and made the first live color TV broadcasts from space.

Upon reaching lunar orbit, Young remained alone in the command module ''[[Charlie Brown]]'' while Stafford and Cernan flew separately in the LM. The LM crew checked out their craft's radar and ascent engine, rode out a momentary gyration in the lunar lander's motion (due to a faulty switch setting), and surveyed the Apollo 11 landing site in the [[Sea of Tranquility]]. The lunar module on this flight was not equipped to land, however. &quot;A lot of people thought about the kind of people we were: 'Don't give those guys an opportunity to land, 'cause they might!'&quot; said Cernan. &quot;So the ascent module, the part we lifted off the lunar surface with, was short-fueled. The fuel tanks weren't full. So had we literally tried to land on the moon, we couldn't have gotten off.&quot;

[[Splashdown (spacecraft landing)|Splashdown]] occurred in the [[Pacific Ocean]] on May 26, 1969 at 16:52:23 [[UTC]], approximately 400 nautical miles east of [[American Samoa]]. The astronauts were recovered by the [[USS Princeton (CV-37)|USS ''Princeton'']], and subsequently flown to [[Pago Pago International Airport]] in [[Tafuna, American Samoa|Tafuna]] for a greeting reception, before being flown on a [[C-141]] cargo plane to [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]].

==Hardware disposition==

The LM descent stages of Apollo 11, 12 and 14-17 remain at their respective landing sites. The Apollo 10 LM descent stage is expected to have crashed onto the lunar surface in an unknown location.

After being jettisoned, the Apollo 10 LM ascent stage flew on a trajectory past the moon and into [[heliocentric orbit]],&lt;ref name=&quot;nasa_apollo10&quot;&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo10.html&lt;/ref&gt; making it the sole intact lunar module ascent stage remaining out of the 10 true LMs sent into space. Both stages of the [[Apollo 5]], [[Apollo 9|9]] and [[Apollo 13|13]] LMs burned up in Earth's atmosphere.  The [[Apollo 11]] and [[Apollo 16|16]] LM ascent stages were left in lunar orbit and eventually crashed onto the moon in unknown locations as their orbits were perturbed. The [[Apollo 12]], [[Apollo 14|14]], [[Apollo 15|15]] and [[Apollo 17|17]] LM ascent stages were deliberately crashed onto the moon in order to obtain seismic readings from the seismometers placed on the lunar surface. (The [[Lunar Test Article]] [[LTA-B]] flown as ballast aboard [[Apollo 8]] remained attached to the Saturn S-IVB stage that went into solar orbit.)

The Apollo 10 Command Module ''Charlie Brown'' is currently on loan to the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in London, where it is on display.

==Mission insignia==
The shield-shaped emblem for the flight shows a large, three-dimensional [[Roman numeral]] X sitting on the moon's surface, in Stafford's words, &quot;to show that we had left our mark.&quot; Although it did not land on the moon, the prominence of the number represents the significant contributions the mission made to the Apollo program.  A CSM circles the moon as an LM ascent stage flies up from its low pass over the lunar surface. The earth is visible in the background. A wide, light blue border carries the word APOLLO at the top and the crew names around the bottom. The patch is trimmed in gold. The insignia was designed by Allen Stevens of Rockwell International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ed |last=Hengeveld |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-052008a.html |title=The man behind the Moon mission patches |publisher=collectSPACE |date=May 20, 2008 |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apollo 12''' was the sixth manned flight in the [[United States|American]] [[Apollo program]] and the second to land on the [[Moon]] ([[List of Apollo mission types|an H type mission]]). It was launched on November 14, 1969 from the [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida, four months after [[Apollo 11]]. Mission commander [[Pete Conrad|Charles &quot;Pete&quot; Conrad]] and Lunar Module Pilot [[Alan L. Bean]] performed just over one day and seven hours of lunar surface activity while [[Command Module]] Pilot [[Richard F. Gordon, Jr.|Richard F. Gordon]] remained in lunar orbit. The landing site for the mission was located in the southeastern portion of the [[Ocean of Storms]]. Key objectives were achievement of a more precise landing (which had not been achieved by Apollo 11), and to visit the [[Surveyor 3]] probe to remove parts for analysis. The mission ended on November 24 with a successful [[Splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashdown]], having completed the main mission parameters successfully.

===Launch and transfer===
[[File:Apollo 12 launches from Kennedy Space Center.jpg|thumb|left|Apollo 12 launches from Kennedy Space Center, November 14, 1969.]]
Apollo 12 launched on schedule from Kennedy Space Center, during a rainstorm. It was the first rocket launch attended by an incumbent US president, [[Richard Nixon]]. Thirty-six-and-a-half seconds after lift-off, the vehicle triggered a [[lightning]] discharge through itself and down to the earth through the Saturn's ionized plume. Protective circuits on the fuel cells in the service module falsely detected overloads and took all three [[fuel cell]]s offline, along with much of the CSM instrumentation. A second strike at 52 seconds after launch knocked out the &quot;8-ball&quot; [[attitude indicator]]. The telemetry stream at Mission Control was garbled. However, the Saturn V continued to fly correctly; the strikes had not affected the Saturn V's Instrument Unit.

The loss of all three fuel cells put the CSM entirely on batteries. They were unable to maintain normal 28V DC bus voltages into the heavy 75 amp launch loads. One of the [[Inverter (electrical)|AC inverter]]s dropped offline. These power supply problems lit nearly every warning light on the control panel and caused much of the instrumentation to malfunction.

Legendary [[EECOM]] [[John Aaron]] (the original NASA &quot;steely eyed missile man&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;''Lost Moon' by Jeffrey Kluger and James Lovell, Houghton Mifflin (T) (October 1994) ISBN 0-395-67029-2&lt;/ref&gt; remembered the telemetry failure pattern from an earlier test when a power supply malfunctioned in the CSM Signal Conditioning Equipment (SCE). The SCE converts raw signals from instrumentation to standard voltages for the spacecraft instrument displays and telemetry encoders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.nasa.gov/SP-287/ch5.htm source NASA History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaron made a call: &quot;Try SCE to aux&quot;. This switched the SCE to a backup power supply. The switch was fairly obscure and neither the [[Flight Director]], [[Capsule communicator|CAPCOM]], nor Commander Conrad immediately recognized it. Lunar module pilot Alan Bean, flying in the right seat as the CSM systems engineer, remembered the SCE switch from a training incident a year earlier when the same failure had been [[simulated]]. Aaron's quick thinking and Bean's memory saved what could have been an [[Apollo abort modes|aborted mission]]. Bean put the fuel cells back on line, and with telemetry restored, the launch continued successfully. Once in earth [[parking orbit]], the crew carefully checked out their spacecraft before re-igniting the [[S-IVB]] third stage for [[trans-lunar injection]]. The lightning strikes had caused no serious permanent damage.

Initially it was feared that the lightning strike could have caused the command module's parachute mechanism to prematurely fire, disabling the explosive bolts that open the parachute compartment to deploy them. If they were indeed disabled, the command module would have crashed uncontrollably into the Pacific Ocean at the end of the mission and killed the crew instantly. Since there was no way to figure out whether or not this was the case, ground controllers decided not to tell the astronauts about the possibility. Fortunately, the parachutes did deploy and function normally at the end of the mission.

After lunar module separation, the S-IVB was intended to fly into solar orbit. The S-IVB auxiliary propulsion system was fired and the remaining propellants vented to slow it down to fly past the Moon's trailing edge (the Apollo spacecraft always approached the Moon's leading edge). The Moon's gravity would then slingshot the stage into solar orbit. However, a small error in the state vector in the Saturn's guidance system caused the S-IVB to fly past the Moon at too high an altitude to achieve earth escape velocity. It remained in a semi-stable earth orbit after passing the Moon on November 18, 1969. It finally escaped earth orbit in 1971 but was briefly recaptured in Earth orbit 31 years later. It was discovered by amateur astronomer [[Bill Yeung]] who gave it the temporary designation [[J002E3]] before it was determined to be an artificial object.

===Landing===
The Apollo 12 mission landed on an area of the Ocean of Storms that had been visited earlier by several unmanned missions ([[Luna 5]], [[Surveyor 3]], and [[Ranger 7]]). The [[International Astronomical Union]], recognizing this, christened this region ''[[Mare Cognitum]] (Known Sea)''. The [[Selenographic coordinates|Lunar coordinates]] of the landing site were 3.01239° S latitude, 23.42157° W longitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/collections/imagery/apollo/landsites.htm|title=Landing Sites - The Apollo Program|publisher=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landing site would thereafter be listed as ''Statio Cognitum'' on lunar maps (Conrad and Bean did not formally name their landing site, interestingly enough, though the intended touchdown point was nicknamed ''Pete's Parking Lot'' by Conrad).

The second lunar landing was an exercise in precision targeting, using a [[Doppler effect]] radar technique developed to allow the pinpoint landings needed for future Apollo missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1969&quot;&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1969/Apollo-11/12303189849225-2/ &quot;Apollo 11: 1969 Year in Review, UPI.com&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the descent was automatic, with manual control assumed by Conrad during the final few hundred feet of descent. Unlike ''Apollo 11'' where Neil Armstrong took partial control of the lander and directed it further down range when he noticed that the intended landing site was strewn with boulders, Apollo 12 succeeded, on November 19, in landing within walking distance (less than 200 meters) of its intended target - the ''Surveyor 3 ''probe, which had landed on the Moon in April 1967.&lt;ref name=Chaikin/&gt; This was the first — and, to date, only — occasion in which humans have &quot;caught up&quot; to a probe sent to land on another world.

Conrad actually landed ''Intrepid'' {{convert|580|ft|m}} short of ''Pete's Parking Lot'' because the planned landing point looked rougher than anticipated during the final approach to touchdown, and was a little under {{convert|1180|ft|m}} from ''Surveyor 3'', a distance that was chosen to eliminate the possibility of lunar dust (being kicked up by ''Intrepid's'' descent engine during landing) from covering ''Surveyor 3''.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1969&quot; /&gt; But the actual touchdown point — {{convert|600|ft|m}} from ''Surveyor 3'' — did cause a thin film of dust to coat the probe, giving it a light tan hue.

===EVAs===
[[File:Apollo 12 LRO.jpg|left|thumb|Landing site photographed by [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] in 2009]]

When Conrad, who was somewhat shorter than [[Neil Armstrong]], stepped onto the lunar surface, his first words were &quot;Whoopie! Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me.&quot;&lt;ref name=Chaikin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEEIJYrXn9s Video footage of landing on YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; This was not an off-the-cuff remark: Conrad had made a $500 bet with reporter [[Oriana Fallaci]] he would say these words, after she had queried whether NASA had instructed Neil Armstrong what to say as he stepped onto the Moon. Conrad later said he was never able to collect the money.&lt;ref name=Chaikin&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Chaikin|title=A Man on the Moon|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1994|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/july9/conrad10.htm WaPo July 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

To improve the quality of television pictures from the Moon, a color camera was carried on Apollo 12 (unlike the monochrome camera that was used on ''Apollo 11''). Unfortunately, when Bean carried the camera to the place near the lunar module where it was to be set up, he inadvertently pointed it directly into the Sun, destroying the SEC tube. Television coverage of this mission was thus terminated almost immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.step.html hq.nasa.gov , ''One Small Step'' ]. See also: [[Apollo TV camera]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo 12 successfully landed within walking distance of the ''[[Surveyor 3]]'' probe. Conrad and Bean removed pieces of the probe to be taken back to Earth for analysis. It is claimed that the common [[bacterium]] ''[[Streptococcus mitis]]'' was found to have accidentally contaminated the spacecraft's camera prior to launch and survived dormant in this harsh environment for two and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.nasa.gov/NEWHOME/headlines/ast01sep98_1.htm NASA Headlines]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this finding has since been disputed: see [[Reports of Streptococcus mitis on the moon|Reports of Streptococcus mitis on the Moon]].

Astronauts Conrad and Bean also collected rocks and set up equipment that took measurements of the Moon's seismicity, solar wind flux and magnetic field, and relayed the measurements to Earth. The instruments were part of the first complete nuclear-powered [[ALSEP]] station set up by astronauts on the Moon to relay long-term data from the lunar surface. The instruments on Apollo 11 were not as extensive or designed to operate long term. The astronauts also took photographs, although by accident Bean left several rolls of exposed film on the lunar surface. Meanwhile Gordon, on board the ''Yankee Clipper'' in lunar orbit, took multi-spectral photographs of the surface.

The [[lunar plaque]] attached to the descent stage of ''Intrepid'' is unique in that unlike the other plaques, it (a) did not have a depiction of the Earth, and (b) it was textured differently (the other plaques had black lettering on polished stainless steel while the Apollo 12 plaque had the lettering in polished stainless steel while the background was brushed flat).

===Return===
[[Image:CVS-12 Apollo12 SH-3D NAN1-70.jpg|thumb|Apollo 12 recovery by the ''USS Hornet''.]]

''Intrepid's'' ascent stage was dropped (per normal procedures) after Conrad and Bean rejoined Gordon in orbit. It impacted the Moon on November 20, 1969 at {{Coord|3.94|S|21.20|W|type:event_globe:moon|title=Apollo 12 Intrepid Module impact}}. The seismometers the astronauts had left on the lunar surface registered the vibrations for more than an hour.

The crew stayed an extra day in lunar orbit taking photographs, for a total lunar surface stay of thirty-one and a half hours and a total time in lunar orbit of eighty-nine hours.

On the return flight to Earth after leaving lunar orbit, the crew of Apollo 12 witnessed (and photographed) a [[solar eclipse]], though this one was of the Earth eclipsing the sun.

===Splashdown===
''Yankee Clipper'' returned to Earth on November 24, 1969, at 20:58 [[UTC]] (3:58pm [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|EST]], 10:58am [[Hawaii-Aleutian time zone|HST]]) in the [[Pacific Ocean]], approximately 500 nautical miles (800&amp;nbsp;km) east of [[American Samoa]].  During splashdown, a 16&amp;nbsp;mm camera dislodged from storage and struck Bean in the forehead, rendering him briefly unconscious. He suffered a mild concussion and needed six stitches.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  After recovery by the [[USS Hornet (CV-12)|USS ''Hornet'']], they were flown to [[Pago Pago International Airport]] in [[Tafuna, American Samoa|Tafuna]] for a reception, before being flown on a [[C-141]] cargo plane to [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]].

==Stunts and mementos==
[[Image:apollo12 cf.jpg|right|100 px|thumb|Centerfold in lunar checklist]]

*Alan Bean smuggled a camera-shutter [[self-timer]] device on to the mission with the intent of taking a photograph with himself, Pete Conrad and the Surveyor 3 probe in the frame. As the timer was not part of their standard equipment, such an image would have thrown post-mission photo analysts into confusion over how the photo was taken. However, the self-timer was misplaced during the EVA and the plan was never executed.
*As one of the many pranks pulled during the friendly rivalry between the all-Navy prime crew and the all-Air Force backup crew, the Apollo 12 backup crew managed to insert into the astronaut's lunar checklist (attached to the wrists of Conrad's and Bean's spacesuits) reduced-sized pictures of [[Playboy]] centerfolds, surprising Conrad and Bean when they looked through the checklist flip-book during their first EVA. The [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/ Apollo Lunar Surface Journal website] contains a PDF file with the [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a12/a12_cdrcuff.pdf photocopies of their cuff checklists] showing these photos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a12/a12_cdrcuff.pdf NASA]&lt;/ref&gt; Appearing in Conrad's checklist were [[Victoria Vetri|Angela Dorian, Miss September 1967]] (with the caption &quot;SEEN ANY INTERESTING HILLS &amp; VALLEYS ?&quot;) and [[Reagan Wilson|Reagan Wilson, Miss October 1967]] (&quot;PREFERRED TETHER PARTNER&quot;, referring to a special procedure that would require the sharing of life support resources). The photos in Bean's cuff checklist were of [[Cynthia Myers|Cynthia Myers, Miss December 1968]] (&quot;DON'T FORGET - DESCRIBE THE PROTUBERANCES&quot;) and [[Leslie Bianchini|Leslie Bianchini, Miss January 1969]] (&quot;SURVEY - HER ACTIVITY&quot;, in [[pun]] of Surveyor).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boingboing.net/2007/01/13/playboy_playmates_pr.html Playboy Playmates pranked into Apollo 12 mission checklists - Boing Boing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playboy.com/go/blog/magazine/Letters/2007/01/10/On-Buckeyes-Nanotechnology-and-Playmates-in-Space.html The Playboy Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; The backup crew who did this later flew to the Moon themselves on [[Apollo 15]], with [[Jim Irwin]] dedicating his life to Christian ministry after his mission. Also at the back of Conrad's checklist were two pages of pre-prepared complex geological terminology, added as a joke to give him the option to sound to Mission Control like he was as skilled as a professional career geologist. The third crewmember orbiting the Moon was not left out of the Playboy prank, as a November 1969 calendar featuring [[DeDe Lind|DeDe Lind, Miss August 1967]] had been stowed in a locker that [[Dick Gordon]] found while his crewmates were on the lunar surface.

== Mission insignia ==
The Apollo 12 mission patch shows the crew's Navy background. It features a [[clipper ship]] arriving at the moon. The ship trails fire and flies the flag of the United States. The mission name APOLLO XII and the crew names are on a wide gold border, with a small blue trim. Blue and gold are traditionally Navy colors. The patch has four stars on it — one each for the three astronauts who flew the mission and one for [[Clifton Williams]], who was killed on October 5, 1967, after a mechanical failure caused the controls of his T-38 trainer to stop responding. He trained with Conrad and Gordon as part of the back-up crew for what would be the [[Apollo 9]] mission, and would have been assigned as Lunar Module pilot for Apollo 12.&lt;ref name=Chaikin/&gt;

Portions of the Apollo 12 mission are dramatized in the miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' episode entitled &quot;[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)#Episodes|That's All There Is]]&quot;. Conrad, Gordon, and Bean were portrayed by [[Paul McCrane]], [[Tom Verica]], and [[Dave Foley]], respectively. Conrad had been portrayed by a different actor, [[Peter Scolari]], in the first two episodes.

'''Apollo 14''' was the eighth manned mission in the [[United States|American]] [[Apollo program]], and the third to [[Moon landing|land]] on the [[Moon]]. It was the last of the &quot;[[List of Apollo mission types|H missions]]&quot;, targeted landings with two-day stays on the Moon with two lunar [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]s, or moonwalks.

Commander [[Alan Shepard]], [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module Pilot]] [[Stuart Roosa]], and [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module Pilot]] [[Edgar Mitchell]] launched on their nine-day mission on January 31, 1971 at 4:04:02 pm local time after a 40 minute, 2 second delay due to launch site weather restrictions, the first such delay in the Apollo program.&lt;ref&gt;http://history.nasa.gov/afj/launchwindow/lw1.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Shepard and Mitchell made their lunar landing on February 5 in the [[Fra Mauro formation]]; this had originally been the target of the aborted [[Apollo 13]] mission. During the two lunar EVAs, {{convert|42|kg|lb}} of [[Moon rock]]s were collected and several surface experiments, including seismic studies, were performed. Shepard famously hit two [[golf ball]]s on the lunar surface with a make-shift club he had brought from [[Earth]]. Shepard and Mitchell spent about 33 hours on the Moon, with about 9½ hours on EVA. 

While Shepard and Mitchell were on the surface, Roosa remained in [[lunar orbit]] aboard the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]], performing scientific experiments and photographing the Moon. He took several hundred seeds on the mission, many of which were [[Germination|germinated]] on return resulting in the so-called [[Moon tree]]s. Shepard, Roosa, and Mitchell landed in the [[Pacific Ocean]] on February 9.

Gordon Cooper]], had originally been scheduled to command the mission, but according to author Andrew Chaikin, his casual attitude toward training, along with problems with NASA hierarchy (reaching all the way back to the [[Mercury-Atlas 9]] flight) resulted in his removal.

The mission was a personal triumph for Shepard, who had battled back from [[Ménière’s disease]] which grounded him from 1964 to 1968.  He and his crew were originally scheduled to fly on Apollo 13, but in 1969 NASA Administrators switched the scheduled crews for Apollo 13 and 14.  This was done to place the more experienced [[Apollo 8]] veteran [[Jim Lovell]] in command of what would have been the first lunar landing mission if both [[Apollo 11]] and [[Apollo 12]] had failed to successfully land.

As of 2011, Mitchell is the only surviving member of the crew; Roosa died in 1994 from [[pancreatitis]] and Shepard in 1998 from [[leukemia]].

===Transfer and descent===

[[File:Apollo 14 Launch - GPN-2000-000633.jpg|thumb|Launch of Apollo 14]]

At the beginning of the mission, the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|CSM]] ''Kitty Hawk'' had difficulty achieving capture and docking with the [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]] ''Antares''. Repeated attempts to dock went on for 1 hour and 42 minutes, until it was suggested that pilot Roosa hold ''Kitty Hawk'' against ''Antares'' using its thrusters, then the docking probe would be retracted out of the way, hopefully triggering the docking latches. This attempt was successful, and no further docking problems were encountered during the mission.

After separating from the command module in lunar orbit, the LM ''Antares'' also had two serious problems.  First, the LM computer began getting an ABORT signal from a faulty switch.  NASA believed that the computer might be getting erroneous readings like this if a tiny ball of solder had shaken loose and was floating between the switch and the contact, closing the circuit.  The immediate solution—tapping on the panel next to the switch—did work briefly, but the circuit soon closed again. If the problem recurred after the descent engine fired, the computer would think the signal was real and would initiate an auto-abort, causing the Ascent Stage to separate from the Descent Stage and climb back into orbit.  NASA and the software teams at [[MIT]] scrambled to find a solution, and determined the fix would involve reprogramming the flight software to ignore the false signal.  The [[patch (computing)|software modifications]] were transmitted to the crew via voice communication, and Mitchell manually entered the changes (amounting to over 80 keystrokes on the LM computer pad) just in time.

A second problem occurred during the powered descent, when the LM radar altimeter failed to lock automatically onto the moon's surface, depriving the navigation computer of vital information on the vehicle altitude and groundspeed.  This was later determined to be an unintended consequence of the software patch.  After the astronauts cycled the landing radar breaker, the unit successfully acquired a signal near {{convert|18000|ft|m}}, again just in the nick of time.  Shepard then manually landed the LM closer to its intended target than any of the other six moon landing missions.  Mitchell believes that Shepard would have continued with the landing attempt without the radar, using the LM inertial guidance system and visual cues.   But a post-flight review of the descent data showed the inertial system alone would have been inadequate, and the astronauts probably would have been forced to abort the landing as they approached the surface.

===EVAs===

Shepard and Mitchell named their landing site ''Fra Mauro Base'', and this designation is recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (depicted in Latin on lunar maps as ''Statio Fra Mauro'').

Shepard's first words, after taking his first step onto the lunar surface, were &quot;And it's been a long way, but we're here.&quot; Unlike Apollo 11's [[Neil Armstrong]] and Apollo 12's [[Pete Conrad]], Shepard had already gotten off the ladder and was a few meters from the LM before he spoke.

[[Image:Apollo 14 golf.jpg|thumb|right|This TV image shows Alan Shepard golfing on the Moon]]

Shepard's moonwalking suit was the first to utilize red bands on the arms and legs and a red stripe on the top of the lunar EVA sunshade &quot;hood&quot;, so as to allow easy identification of the commander while on the surface;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=WZ6okH8FCs4C&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;ots=kfrdjMDnfc&amp;dq=space%20suits%20red%20bands&amp;pg=PA121#v=onepage&amp;q=space%20suits%20red%20bands&amp;f=false | title=Space Suits - From Pressurized Prison to Mini-Spacecraft | author=von Braun, Wernher | journal=Popular Science | year=1972 | month=July | pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Apollo 12]] pictures, it had been almost impossible to distinguish between the two crewmen, causing a great deal of confusion. This feature was included on [[Jim Lovell]]'s [[Apollo 13]] suit, but because of the accident on that mission, it was not used. It was used on the remaining three Apollo flights and is used on both the U.S. and Russian spacesuits on both the [[Space Shuttle]] and [[International Space Station]].

After landing in the [[Fra Mauro formation]]—the destination for [[Apollo 13]]—Shepard and Mitchell took two moon walks, adding new seismic studies to the by now familiar Apollo experiment package, and using the Modularized Equipment Transporter (MET), a pull cart for carrying equipment and samples, referred to as a &quot;lunar rickshaw&quot;. Roosa, meanwhile, took pictures from on board command module ''Kitty Hawk'' in lunar orbit.

[[Image:a14-plaque.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Lunar plaque|plaque]] left on the Moon by Apollo 14]]

The second moonwalk, or EVA, was intended to reach the rim of the 1,000 foot (300 m) wide Cone Crater.  However, the two astronauts were not able to find the rim amid the rolling terrain of the crater's slopes. Later analysis, using the pictures that they took, determined that they had come within an estimated {{convert|65|ft|m}} of the crater's rim. Images from the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] show the tracks of the astronauts and the MET come to within 30&amp;nbsp;m of the rim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Samuel Lawrence | title = Trail of Discovery at Fra Mauro | url = http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/91-Trail-of-Discovery-at-Fra-Mauro.html | work = Featured Images | publisher = LROC News System | location = Tempe, Arizona | date = August 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shepard and Mitchell deployed and activated various scientific instruments and experiments and collected almost 100 pounds (45&amp;nbsp;kg) of lunar samples for return to earth. Other Apollo 14 achievements included: the only use of MET; longest distance traversed by foot on the lunar surface; first use of shortened lunar orbit rendezvous techniques; first use of color TV with new [[Video camera tube#Vidicon|vidicon tube]] on lunar surface and the first extensive orbital science period conducted during CSM solo operations.

[[File:Apollo14 Kitty hawk.jpg|thumb|Command Module ''Kitty Hawk'' on display at the Saturn V Center at [[Kennedy Space Center]] ]]

The astronauts also engaged in less serious activities. Shepard brought a makeshift [[Golf club (equipment)#Irons|six iron golf club]] and two [[golf balls]] to the Moon, and took several swings (one-handed, due to the limited flexibility of the EVA suit). He exuberantly, and somewhat whimsically, exclaimed that the second ball went &quot;miles and miles and miles&quot; in the lunar [[gravity]], but later estimated it actually went {{convert|200|to|400|yd|sp=us}}.  Mitchell then used a lunar scoop handle as a javelin, creating the first 'Lunar Olympics'. Before the flight, backup crew members Cernan, Evans and Engle played a joke on the astronauts by stashing their own crew patches in every single locker and compartment in the spacecraft. Whenever one of the patches would float out of a locker during the mission, Shepard would say &quot;Tell Cernan, BEEP-BEEP my ass!&quot;

===Return===

On the way back to Earth, the crew conducted the first U.S. materials processing experiments in space. The Apollo 14 astronauts were the last lunar explorers to be quarantined on their return from the Moon. 

Roosa, who worked in forestry in his youth, took several hundred tree seeds on the flight.  These were germinated after the return to Earth, and widely distributed around the world as commemorative [[Moon Tree]]s.

The command module ''Kitty Hawk'' splashed down in the [[Pacific Ocean]] on February 9, 1971 at 21:05 [UTC], approximately {{convert|760|nmi|km}} south of [[American Samoa]]. After recovery by the ship [[USS New Orleans (LPH-11)|USS ''New Orleans'']], the crew was flown to [[Pago Pago International Airport]] in [[Tafuna, American Samoa|Tafuna]] for a reception before being flown on a [[C-141]] cargo plane to [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]].

== Mission insignia ==
[[Image:RobbinsMedallionApollo14ByPhilKonstantin.jpg|thumb|Robbins Medallion flown on Apollo 14]]
The oval insignia shows a gold NASA [[Astronaut Badge#NASA Astronaut Pins|Astronaut Pin]], given to U.S. astronauts upon completing their first space flight, traveling from the Earth to the Moon. A gold band around the edge includes the mission and astronaut names. The designer was Jean Beaulieu. 

The backup crew spoofed the patch with its own version, with revised artwork showing the [[Wile E.

== Spacecraft location ==

The Apollo 14 Command Module ''Kitty Hawk'' is on display at the Saturn V Center building at KSC after being on display at the [[Astronaut Hall of Fame]], [[Titusville, Florida]] for several years.

The ascent stage of Lunar Module ''Antares'' impacted the Moon 7 February 1971 at 00:45:25.7 UT (6 February, 7:45 PM EST) {{Coord|3.42|S|19.67|W|globe:Moon_type:landmark|name=Apollo 14 LM ascent stage}}.  Antares' descent stage and the mission's other equipment remain at Fra Mauro at {{Coord|3.65|S|17.47|W|globe:Moon_type:landmark|name=Apollo 14 LM descent stage}}; they are, by far, the most visible Apollo hardware in the photographs from the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] released on 17 July 2009, owing to particularly good lighting conditions when the images were captured.

'''Apollo 15''' was the ninth manned mission in the [[United States|American]] [[Apollo program|Apollo space program]], the fourth to [[Moon landing|land]] on the [[Moon]] and the eighth successful manned mission. It was the first of what were termed &quot;J missions&quot;, long duration stays on the Moon with a greater focus on science than had been possible on previous missions. It was also the first mission where the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] was used. 

The mission began on July 26, 1971, and concluded on August 7. [[NASA]] called it the most successful manned flight ever achieved.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1971&quot;&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/#title &quot;Apollo 15: 1971 Year in Review, UPI.com&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Commander [[David Scott]] and Lunar Module Pilot [[James Irwin]] spent three days on the Moon and a total of 18½ hours outside the spacecraft on lunar [[extra-vehicular activity]]. The mission was the first not to land in a [[Lunar mare]], instead landing near [[Mons Hadley|Hadley rille]] in an area of the [[Mare Imbrium]] called ''Palus Putredinus'' (Marsh of Decay). The crew explored the area using the first Lunar Rover, allowing them to travel much farther from the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] lander than had previously been possible. They collected a total of 77&amp;nbsp;kg (170 [[pound (mass)|lbs]]) of lunar surface material.

At the same time, Command Module Pilot [[Alfred Worden]] orbited the Moon, using a Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) in the Service Module to study the lunar surface and environment in great detail with a panoramic camera, [[gamma ray spectrometer]], mapping camera, laser [[altimeter]], [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]], and lunar sub-satellite deployed at the end of Apollo 15's stay in lunar orbit (an Apollo program first).

All three astronauts on the all-Air Force crew received either an honorary degree or Master's degree from the [[University of Michigan]], including Scott's honorary degree, awarded in the spring of 1971, just months before the launch. Scott did attend the University of Michigan, but left before graduating to accept an appointment to the US Military Academy. The crewmen did their undergraduate work at the US Military Academy or the US Naval Academy.

== Planning and training ==
[[Image:Apollo 15 commander Dave Scott geology training.jpg|thumb|250px|Commander Dave Scott during geology training in [[New Mexico]] on March 19, 1971.]]

The crew for ''Apollo 15'' had previously served as the backup crew for ''Apollo 12''. There had been a friendly rivalry between that prime and backup crew on that mission, with the prime being all [[United States Navy|Navy]], and the backup all [[United States Air Force|Air Force]].

Originally ''Apollo 15'' would have been an [[Apollo program#Mission types|H mission]], like Apollos ''[[Apollo 12|12]]'', ''[[Apollo 13|13]]'', ''[[Apollo 14|14]]''. But on September 2, 1970, [[NASA]] announced it was cancelling what were to be the current incarnations of the ''Apollo 15'' and ''[[Cancelled Apollo missions|Apollo 19]]'' missions. To maximize the return from the remaining missions, ''Apollo 15'' would now fly as a [[Apollo program#Mission types|J mission]] and have the honor of carrying the first Lunar Rover.

One of the major changes in the training for ''15'' was the geology training. Although on previous flights the crews had been trained in field geology, for the first time ''15'' would make it a high priority. Scott and Irwin would train with [[Leon Silver]], a Caltech geologist who on Earth was interested in the [[Precambrian]]. Silver had been suggested by [[Harrison Schmitt]] as an alternative to the classroom lecturers that NASA had previously used. Among other things, Silver had made important refinements to the methods for dating rocks using the decay of [[uranium]] into [[lead]] in the late 1950s.

At first Silver would take the prime and backup crews to various geological sites in Arizona and New Mexico as if for a normal field geology lesson, but as launch time approached, these trips became more realistic. Crews began to wear mock-ups of the backpacks they would carry, and communicate using [[walkie-talkie]]s to a CapCom in a tent. (During a mission the Capsule Communicators (CapComs), always fellow astronauts, were the only people who normally would speak to the crew). The CapCom was accompanied by a group of geologists unfamiliar with the area who would rely on the astronauts' descriptions to interpret the findings.

The decision to land at Hadley came in September 1970. The Site Selection Committees had narrowed the field down to two sites — Hadley Rille or the crater [[Marius (crater)|Marius]], near which were a group of low, possibly volcanic, domes. Although not ultimately his decision, the commander of a mission always held great sway. To Dave Scott the choice was clear, with Hadley, being &quot;exploration at its finest&quot;.

Command Module Pilot Al Worden undertook a different kind of geology training. Working with an Egyptian, [[Farouk El-Baz]], he flew over areas in an airplane simulating the speed at which terrain would pass below him while in the CSM in orbit. He became quite adept at making observations as the object traveled below.

===Launch and outbound trip===
[[File:Apollo 15 launch.jpg|thumb|right|''Apollo 15'' launches on July 26, 1971.]]
{{main|Apollo 15, Outward journey}}
''Apollo 15'' launched on July 26, 1971, at 9:34 AM [[Eastern time|EDT]] from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] at [[Cape Canaveral]], Florida. During the launch, the second stage of the [[Saturn V]] ignited when still close to the first stage, which could have caused a catastrophic event in which the exhaust of the first stage engine would have been forced back into the engine. Despite this, the rocket nominally reached an orbit around Earth a short time later. A couple of hours into the mission, the [[S-IVB]] third stage of the rocket reignited to propel the spacecraft out of Earth orbit and onto the Moon.

A few days after launching from Florida, the spacecraft passed behind the [[far side of the Moon]], where the [[Apollo_Command/Service_Module#Service_Propulsion_System|Service Propulsion System]] engine on the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] ignited for a six-minute burn to slow the craft down into an initial lunar orbit. Once the lowest point of altitude was reached in the orbit, the SPS engine was fired again to further stabilize the orbit of the Apollo CSM/[[Apollo Lunar Module]] stack and prepare for landing at Hadley.

===Landing===

The majority of the first part of the day after arriving in lunar orbit, July 30, was spent preparing the Lunar Module for the descent to the lunar surface later on that day. After preparations were complete, un-docking from the CSM was attempted, but did not occur because of the faulty seal in the hatch mechanism. Command Module Pilot Al Worden re-sealed the hatch and the LM then successfully separated from the CSM. Dave Scott and Jim Irwin continued preparations for the descent while Al Worden remained in the CSM, returning to a higher orbit to perform lunar observations and await their return a few days later.

Soon thereafter, Scott and Irwin began the descent to the Hadley landing site on the surface. Several minutes after descent was initiated, at pitch-over and the beginning of the approach phase of the landing, the LM was six kilometers east of the pre-selected landing target. Upon learning of this, Scott altered the flight path of the LM and touched down at 22:16:29 UTC on July 30 at Hadley, within a few hundred meters of the planned landing site. While previous crews had exited the Lunar Module shortly after landing, the crew of ''Apollo 15'' would be spending a substantially longer amount of time on the surface than previous crews. In order to preserve their sleep rhythm, the crew elected to spend the rest of the day inside the LM and wait until the next day to perform the first of three [[Extra-vehicular activity|Extra-vehicular activities]] (EVAs), or moonwalks. Before beginning their sleep period, Scott performed a stand-up EVA, during which the LM was depressurized and the top docking hatch opened to allow him to photograph their surroundings.

===Lunar surface===
[[File:Apollo 15 flag, rover, LM, Irwin.jpg|thumb|right|Jim Irwin salutes the United States flag on the Moon on 1 August 1971.]]
{{main|Apollo 15, Lunar surface}}
Throughout the sleep period, [[Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in Houston monitored a slow but steady oxygen leak. The data output of the onboard telemetry computers was limited during the night to conserve energy, so controllers could not determine the exact cause of the leak without awaking the crew. Scott and Irwin were eventually awakened an hour ahead of schedule, and the source of the leak was determined to be an open valve on the [[Urine]] Transfer Device. After the problem was resolved, the crew began preparations for the first moonwalk.

Four hours after ending their sleep period and the preparations for the moonwalk were complete, Scott and Irwin became the seventh and eighth humans to walk on the Moon, respectively. After unloading the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] (LRV), the two drove to the first moonwalk's primary destination, Elbow crater along the edge of [[Hadley Rille]]. Upon returning to the LM ''Falcon'', Scott and Irwin deployed the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP). The first EVA ended after about 6½ hours outside the LM.

The target of the second EVA the next day was the edge of Mount Hadley Delta. There, the pair sampled boulders and craters along the [[Montes Apenninus|Apennine Front]]. During this moonwalk, the astronauts recovered what came to be one of the most famous lunar samples collected on the Moon during [[Apollo program|Apollo]], sample #15415, more commonly known as the &quot;[[Genesis Rock]]&quot;. Once back at the landing site, Scott continued to attempt to drill holes for an experiment at the ALSEP site, which he had struggled with the previous day. After conducting soil mechanics experiments and erecting the [[flag of the United States]], Scott and Irwin returned to the shelter of the LM. They spent 7 hours and 12 minutes outside during EVA 2.

During EVA 3, the third and final moonwalk of the mission, the crew again ventured to the edge of Hadley Rille, this time to the northwest of the immediate landing site. After returning to LM site, Scott performed what an experiment with a feather and hammer to test [[Galileo]]'s theory of objects in gravity fields in vacuums. To test this, he dropped the hammer and feather at the same time. Because of the vacuum present at the lunar surface, they hit the ground at the same time, confirming Galileo's hypothesis. Scott then drove the rover to a point beyond the LM to its final resting point, so the television camera on the rover could be used to observe the lunar liftoff. Scott set up a memorial nearby to the cosmonauts and astronauts who were known to have died up to that time, with a plaque bearing their names and a &quot;[[Fallen Astronaut]]&quot; statuette. The EVA ended after 4 hours and 50 minutes.

In total, the two astronauts spent 18½ hours outside of the LM and collected approximately 77 kg (170 lbs) of lunar samples.

===Return to Earth===
[[File:Apollo 15 descends to splashdown.jpg|thumb|right|''Apollo 15'' descends with two good parachutes into the Pacific Ocean on August 7, 1971.]]
{{main|Apollo 15, Return to Earth}}
After lifting off from the lunar surface 2 days and 18 hours after landing, the LM ascent stage rendezvoused and re-docked with the CSM with Al Worden aboard in orbit. After transferring samples and other items from the LM to the CSM, the LM was sealed off, jettisoned, and intentionally crashed into the lunar surface. After completing more observations of the Moon from orbit and releasing the sub-satellite, the three-person crew departed lunar orbit with another burn of the SPS engine.

The next day, on the return trip to Earth, Al Worden performed a spacewalk in deep space, the first of its kind, to retrieve exposed film from the SIM bay. Later on in the day, the crew set an endurance record for Apollo program, becoming the longest Apollo spaceflight to that point.

On approach to Earth the next day, August 7,  the Service Module (SM) was jettisoned, and the Command Module (CM) [[Atmospheric reentry|reentered the Earth's atmosphere]]. Although one of the three parachutes on the CM failed to deploy properly, only two were required for a safe landing (one extra for redundancy). Upon landing, the crew were recovered and taken aboard the recovery ship, the [[USS Okinawa (LPH-3)|USS ''Okinawa'']] after a mission lasting 12 days, 7 hours, 11 minutes, and 33 seconds.

== Hardware ==

===Spacecraft===

''Apollo 15'' used [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] CSM-112, which was given the callsign ''Endeavour'', named after the [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Bark ''Endeavour'']] and [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] LM-10, callsign ''Falcon'', named after the [[United States Air Force Academy]] mascot. If ''Apollo 15'' had flown as an H mission it would have been with CSM-111 and LM-9. That CSM was used by the [[Apollo Soyuz Test Project]] but the Lunar Module went unused and is now on display at the [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]].[[Image:Apollo 15 SIM bay.jpg|thumb|Apollo 15 SM SIM bay]]

After re-entry, one of ''Endeavour'''s three main parachutes collapsed after opening. As it turned out, only two of the three parachutes were required for safe splashdown; the third was a contingency. ''Endeavour'' ultimately splashed down safely to end the mission.

Technicians at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] had many problems with the Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) bay in the Service Module. It was the first time it had flown and experienced problems from the start. Problems came from the fact the instruments were designed to operate in zero gravity, but had to be tested in the 1 [[g-force|g]] on the surface of the Earth. As such, things like the 7.5 m booms for the [[Mass spectrometry|mass]] and [[gamma ray spectrometer]]s could only be tested using railings that tried to mimic the space environment, and so they never worked particularly well. When the technicians tried to integrate the entire bay into the rest of the spacecraft, [[data stream]]s would not synchronize, and lead investigators of the instruments would want to make last minute checks and changes. When it came time to test the operation of the gamma-ray spectrometer, it was necessary to stop every engine within 10 miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) of the test site.

On the Lunar Module, the [[fuel]] and [[oxidizer]] tanks were enlarged on both the descent and ascent stages and the [[engine bell]] on the descent stage was extended. Batteries and [[solar cell]]s were added for increased electrical power. In all this increased the weight of the Lunar Module to 36,000 pounds (16,330 kilograms), 4000 pounds (1800&amp;nbsp;kg) heavier than previous models.

''Endeavour'' is currently on display at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].

===Lunar Rover===

The [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]], or Rover, had been in development since May 1969, with the contract awarded to [[Boeing]]. It could be folded into a space 5&amp;nbsp;ft by 20 in (1.5 m by 0.5 m). Unloaded it weighed 460&amp;nbsp;lb (209&amp;nbsp;kg) and when carrying two astronauts and their equipment, 1500&amp;nbsp;lb (700&amp;nbsp;kg). Each wheel was independently driven by ¼ [[horsepower]] (200 W) electric motor. Although it could be driven by either astronaut, the Commander always drove. Travelling at speeds up to 6 to 8&amp;nbsp;mph (10 to 12&amp;nbsp;km/h), it meant that for the first time the astronauts could travel far afield from their lander and still have enough time to do some scientific experiments.

===Lunar subsatellite===
[[Image:Apollo 15 Subsatellite.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Artist's conception of subsatellite deployment]]
The ''Apollo 15'' subsatellite (PFS-1) was a small satellite released into lunar orbit from the SIM bay.  Its main objectives were to study the plasma, particle, and magnetic field environment of the Moon and map the lunar gravity field.  Specifically, it measured plasma and energetic particle intensities and vector magnetic fields, and facilitated tracking of the satellite velocity to high precision.  A basic requirement was that the satellite acquire fields and particle data everywhere on the orbit around the Moon.  The Moon's roughly circular orbit about the Earth at ~380000 km (60 Earth radii) carried the subsatellite into both interplanetary space and various regions of the Earth's magnetosphere. The satellite orbited the Moon and returned data from August 4, 1971 until January 1973.

Releasing the subsatellite was the crew's final activity in lunar orbit, occurring an hour before the burn to take them back to Earth. A virtually identical subsatellite was deployed by ''[[Apollo 16]]''.

===Launch vehicle===
The Saturn V that launched ''Apollo 15'' was designated SA-510, the tenth flight-ready model of the rocket. As the payload of the rocket was greater, changes were made to its launch trajectory and Saturn V itself. The rocket was launched in a more southerly direction (80–100 degrees [[azimuth]]) and the Earth [[parking orbit]] lowered to 166&amp;nbsp;km (90 nautical miles) above the Earth's surface. These two changes meant 1100 pounds (500&amp;nbsp;kg) more could be launched. The [[propellant]] reserves were reduced and the number of retrorockets on the [[S-IC]] first stage reduced from eight to four. The four outboard engines of the S-IC would be burned longer and the center engine would also burn longer before being shut down (see [[Saturn V]] for more information on the launch sequence). Changes were also made to the [[S-II]] second stage to stop [[pogo oscillation]]s.

Once all the various components had been installed on the Saturn V, it was moved to the launch site, Launch Complex 39A. During late June and early July 1971, the rocket and Mobile Service Structure were struck by [[lightning]] at least four times. All was well however, with only minor damage suffered.

===Space suits===

The astronauts themselves wore new spacesuits. On all previous Apollo flights, including the non-lunar flights, the commander and lunar module pilot had worn suits with the life support, liquid cooling, and communications connections in two parallel rows of three. On Apollo 15, the new suits, dubbed the &quot;A7L-B,&quot; had the connectors situated in triangular pairs. This new arrangement, along with the relocation of the entry zipper (which went in an up-down motion on the old suits), from the right shoulder to the left hip, allowed the inclusion of a new waist joint, allowing the astronauts to bend completely over, and even to sit on the rover. Upgraded backpacks allowed for longer-duration moonwalks, and the command module pilot, who wore a suit with three connectors, would wear a five-connector version of the old moon suit — the liquid cooling water connector being removed, as the command module pilot would make a &quot;deep-space EVA&quot; to retrieve film cartridges on the flight home.

After a highly successful mission, the reputation of the crew and NASA was tarnished somewhat by a deal they made with [[H. Walter Eiermann]], an American citizen who had many professional and social contacts with NASA employees and the astronaut corps. Scott had carried 398 unauthorized [[First day of issue|first-day postal covers]] in his spacesuit. Eiermann had promised each astronaut US$7,000 in the form of savings accounts in return for 100 covers signed after having returned from the Moon. He told them that he would not advertise or sell the covers until the end of the Apollo program. Irwin wrote in his book ''To Rule the Night'' that the astronauts had agreed to the deal as a way to help finance their children's college tuition.

One final controversial event happened after the flight. The crew had contacted Belgian [[Sculpture|sculptor]] [[Paul Van Hoeydonck]] to create a small statuette to personally commemorate those astronauts and cosmonauts having lost their lives in the furtherance of space exploration. The small aluminium sculpture called &quot;[[Fallen Astronaut]]&quot; was left on the Moon next to the Rover at the end of EVA 3, along with a plaque bearing the names of 14 American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts. Unknown at the time, two of the original selection of 20 cosmonauts were also deceased before Apollo 15: [[Valentin Bondarenko]] (fire during training, March 1961) and [[Grigori Nelyubov]] (train accident/suicide, February 1966).&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollo Lunar Surface Journal&quot;&gt;Apollo Lunar Surface Journal&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, their names were not included on the plaque. The memorial was left while the TV camera was turned off. Only Irwin knew what Scott was doing at the time. Scott told mission control he was doing some clean up activities around the rover so they wouldn't know what he was doing. They had agreed with Van Hoeydonck that no replicas were to be made. After mentioning the statuette during their post-flight press conference, the [[National Air and Space Museum]] contacted the crew asking for a replica made for the museum, and Van Hoeydonck subsequently advertised replicas for sale to the public. Under pressure from NASA, Van Hoeydonck withdrew the sale offer. NASA ultimately showed the monument on their Apollo 15 mission documentary, with no mention that it was unauthorized.

== Mission insignia ==
[[Image:RobbinsMedallionApollo15ByPhilKonstantin.jpg|thumb|Robbins Medallion from Apollo 15]]
The circular patch features stylized red, white and blue birds flying over the Hadley Rille section of the moon. Immediately behind the birds, a line of craters form the Roman numeral XV. The artwork is circled in red, with a white band giving the mission and crew names and a blue border. Scott contacted fashion designer [[Emilio Pucci]] to design the patch, who came up with the basic idea of the three-bird motif. The crew changed the colors from blues and greens to more patriotic red, white and blue.

== Visibility from space ==
The halo area of the Apollo 15 Landing site, generated by the LM's exhaust plume, was observed by a camera aboard the Japanese lunar orbiter [[SELENE]] and confirmed by comparative analysis of photographs in May 2008. This corresponds well to photographs taken from the Apollo 15 Command Module showing a change in surface reflectivity due to the plume, and was the first visible trace of manned landings on the moon seen from space since the close of the Apollo program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2008/05/20080520_kaguya_e.html The &quot;halo&quot; area around Apollo 15 landing site observed by Terrain Camera on SELENE(KAGUYA)]&lt;/ref&gt; This evidence is important due to [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|accusations that the moon landings were staged]].

'''Apollo 16''', the tenth manned mission in [[United States|American]] [[Apollo program|Apollo space program]], was the fifth mission to land on the [[Moon]] and the first to land in a highlands area. Launched on April 16, 1972, it was a J-class mission, featuring a [[Lunar Rover]]; and brought back 94.7&amp;nbsp;kg of lunar samples. 

It included three lunar [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVAs]]: 7.2 hours, 7.4 hours, 5.7 hours and one trans-earth EVA of 1.4 hours. Despite a malfunction in the Command Module which almost aborted the lunar landing, Apollo 16's [[lunar module]] landed successfully in the [[Descartes Highlands]] on April 21. Commander [[John Young (astronaut)|John W. Young]] and Lunar Module Pilot [[Charles Duke]] spent nearly three days on the lunar surface while Command Module Pilot [[Ken Mattingly]] orbited the Moon.

A [[#Subsatellite|subsatellite]] was released from the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Service Module]] while in [[lunar orbit]] to carry out experiments on magnetic fields and solar particles (the first subsatellite had been released from [[Apollo 15]]).

The crew splashed down in the [[Pacific Ocean]] on April 27.

}}

Young and Duke served as the backup crew to [[Apollo 13]]; Mattingly was slated as the Apollo 13 command module pilot until being pulled from the mission due to his exposure to [[rubella]] by Duke.

===Backup crew===

}}

Although not officially announced, the original backup crew consisted of [[Fred Haise]] (CDR), [[William R. Pogue]] (CMP) and [[Gerald Carr]] (LMP) who were targeted for the prime crew assignment on [[Canceled Apollo missions|Apollo 19]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald K. Slayton, &quot;Deke!&quot; (New York: Forge, 1994), 262&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the widely-expected cancellations of Apollo 18 and Apollo 19 were finalized in September 1970 it meant that this crew would not rotate to a lunar mission as planned. Subsequently, Roosa and Mitchell were recycled to serve as members of the backup crew after returning from [[Apollo 14]] while Pogue and Carr were re-assigned to the Skylab program where they later flew on [[Skylab 4]].

==Mission highlights==
[[File:Apollo 16 Launch - GPN-2000-000638.jpg|right|thumb|The Saturn V launches Apollo 16 to the Moon.]]

The original launch date in March 1971 was scrubbed well in advance due to an issue with a fuel tank supplying the RCS on the command module. The location of the problem forced a rolback to the VAB on January 27, 1971.  The stack was returned after repairs well before the final countdown had initiated.&lt;ref&gt;http://history.nasa.gov/afj/launchwindow/scrub.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A malfunction in a backup yaw gimbal servo loop in the main propulsion system of the CSM ''Casper'' caused concerns about firing the engine to adjust the CSM's lunar orbit, and nearly caused the [[Moon landing]] to be aborted. After a delayed first landing attempt, it was determined that the malfunction presented relatively little risk, and Young and Duke (who were already undocked, and flying LM ''Orion'' when the problem occurred) were permitted to land on the Moon.

[[Image:John W. Young on the Moon.jpg|left|thumb|John Young jumps while saluting the American flag.]]

Young and Duke spent three days exploring the Descartes highland region, while Mattingly circled overhead in ''Casper''. This was the only one of the six Apollo landings to target the [[lunar highlands]]. On the first day of lunar surface operations, news was relayed to them that Congress approved the [[Space Shuttle]] program for use. Young stated that it was needed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Space Shuttle Columbua&quot;. ''[[Modern Marvels]]''. History Channel. Original Air Date: 26 August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The astronauts discovered that what was thought to have been a region of volcanism was actually a region full of impact-formed rocks (breccias). Their collection of returned specimens included a 25 pound (11&amp;nbsp;kg) chunk that was the largest single rock returned by the Apollo astronauts&lt;ref name=&quot;Lunar Sample Facility Tour - NASA&quot;&gt;[http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/tour/display.cfm Lunar Sample Facility Tour - Pristine Sample Laboratory Display Cabinet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (nicknamed &quot;Big Muley&quot; after [[William R. Muehlberger|Bill Muehlberger]], principal investigator for the mission's geology activities&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollo 16 Video Library NASA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/video16.html|title=Apollo 16 Video Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The scientific results of Apollo 16 caused planetary geologists to revise previous interpretations of the lunar highlands, concluding that meteorite impacts were the dominant agent in shaping the Moon's ancient surfaces.

The Apollo 16 astronauts also conducted performance tests with the lunar rover, at one time getting up to a top speed of 11 miles per hour (18 kilometers per hour), which still stands as the record speed for any wheeled vehicle on the Moon (listed as such in the [[Guinness Book of Records]]).

Apollo 16 was originally scheduled for splashdown at 3:30pm EST on April 28. The mission was shortened by a day (reducing the time in orbit around the Moon after the LM left the Moon and docked with the CSM) because of the problems with the command module prior to landing. As Charlie Duke described on the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal website: &quot;The more you waited up there - if you did have a problem - the less time you had to think of something brilliant to fix it. They got a little nervous and brought us home a day early, I think, just to make sure we could have some ample time to fix any problems.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.html |title=Apollo 16 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no problems encountered during the return flight.

==Subsatellite==
The lunar subsatellite (PFS-2), virtually identical to one released during Apollo 15, was a 78&amp;nbsp;cm x 36&amp;nbsp;cm hexagonal cylinder weighing 36.3&amp;nbsp;kg and three 1.5 m booms. Released from the Service Module's Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) bay on April 24, 1972 at 21:56:09 UTC, the subsatellite's mission was to measure [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], energetic particle intensities and the lunar [[magnetic field]]s. The craft was deployed by a spring action, which generated a relative velocity of around 1.2&amp;nbsp;m/s and a spin of 120 rpm. It returned data from 24 April to 29 May 1972 with an orbital period of around 120 minutes. It was deployed into a sub-optimal inclination and the orbit [[orbital decay|decayed]] earlier than anticipated, with impact occurring after 34 days and 425 revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1972-031D |title=Apollo 16 Subsatellite |publisher=NASA |work=NSSDC |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spacecraft locations==
[[Image:Casperrkt.JPG|right|thumb|Mock-up of ''Orion'' on display at the [[U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center]]]]The Apollo 16 command module ''Casper'' is on display at the [[U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. The lunar module ascent stage separated 24 April 1972 but a loss of attitude control rendered it out of control. It orbited the Moon for about a year. Its impact site on the Moon is unknown.

Charles Duke donated some flown items, including a lunar map, to [[Kennesaw State University]] in [[Kennesaw, Georgia]]. Duke left two items on the Moon, both of which he photographed. The most famous is a plastic-encased photo portrait of his family on the Moon (NASA Photo AS16-117-18841). The reverse of the photo is signed by Duke's family and bears this message: &quot;This is the family of Astronaut Duke from Planet Earth. Landed on the Moon, April 1972.&quot; The other item was a commemorative medal issued by the [[United States Air Force]], which was celebrating its 25th anniversary in 1972. He took two medals, leaving one on the Moon and donating the other to the [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] museum.&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, Glen E., ed. 1999. &quot;'Before This Decade is Out....': Personal Reflections on the Apollo Program [sp4223],&quot; Washington, D.C.: NASA,  chapter 11. http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4223/ch11.htm.

The circular patch featured an eagle with wings outstretched, perched atop a red, white, and blue shield, over a [[lunar surface]]. The vector symbol from the [[NASA]] logo was placed on top of the shield, and then across the shield were written the words APOLLO 16. The artwork was bordered in white, with a blue band carrying 16 stars and the crew names, outlined by a gold border. The patch was designed by NASA artist Barbara Matelski.

'''Apollo 17''' was the eleventh and final [[Human spaceflight|manned mission]] in the [[United States|American]] [[Apollo program|Apollo space program]]. Launched at 12:33 a.m. EST on December 7, 1972, with a crew of Commander [[Eugene Cernan]], [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module Pilot]] [[Ronald Evans]], and [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module Pilot]] [[Harrison Schmitt]], Apollo 17 remains the most recent manned [[Moon landing]] and the most recent manned flight beyond [[low Earth orbit]].

Apollo 17 was the sixth Apollo lunar landing, the first night launch of a [[United States|U.S.]] human spaceflight and the final manned launch of a [[Saturn V]] booster. It was a &quot;[[List of Apollo mission types|J-type mission]]&quot;, missions including three-day lunar surface stays, extended scientific capability, and the  [[Lunar rover (Apollo)|Lunar Roving Vehicle]]. While Evans remained in [[lunar orbit]] above in the Command/Service Module, Cernan and Schmitt spent just more than three days on the lunar surface in the [[Taurus-Littrow (lunar valley)|Taurus-Littrow valley]], performing three [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]s or moonwalks during which they collected lunar samples and deployed [[ALSEP|scientific instruments]]. Cernan, Evans, and Schmitt returned to Earth on December 19 after an approximately 12-day mission.

Apollo 17 also broke several records set by previous flights, including the longest manned lunar landing flight; the longest total lunar surface extravehicular activities; the largest lunar sample return, and the longest time in lunar orbit.

Former [[X-15]] pilot [[Joe Engle]] had trained extensively with Cernan and Evans for lunar exploration as the backup LMP on [[Apollo 14#Backup crew|Apollo 14]]. This came with the expectation that the entire crew would rotate up to prime crew for Apollo 17, but once it became clear that this would be the last lunar flight, the scientific community pressed [[NASA]] to select a scientist-astronaut to land on the Moon. Being directed by NASA officials to assign the scientist-astronaut, [[Deke Slayton]], Director of Flight Crew Operations responsible for crew assignments, presented Cernan with the choice of replacing Engle with [[geologist]] [[Harrison Schmitt]] on his crew, otherwise Slayton would assign Apollo 17 to [[Richard F. Gordon, Jr.|Dick Gordon]]'s entire crew to include Schmitt ([[Apollo 15#Backup crew|backup crew for Apollo 15]]) from the now-cancelled [[Canceled Apollo missions|Apollo 18]]. Cernan opted to fly with Schmitt.

The Apollo 15 prime crew received the backup assignment since this was to be the last lunar mission and the backup crew would not rotate to another mission. However, when the [[Apollo 15 postage stamp incident]] became public in early 1972 the crew was reprimanded by NASA and the Air Force (they were active duty officers). Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton removed them from flight status and replaced them with Young and Duke from the [[Apollo 16]] prime crew and Roosa from the [[Apollo 14]] prime and [[Apollo 16]] backup crews.&lt;ref&gt;Donald K. Slayton, &quot;Deke!&quot; (New York: Forge, 1994), 279&lt;/ref&gt; Young, Roosa and Duke were announced as backups on 23 May 1972 and began their formal training on 1 July.

{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
===Liftoff===
Apollo 17 liftoff was on December 7, 1972 at 05:33:00 UTC (12:33:00 a.m. EST) and was the only nighttime launch of the Saturn V launch vehicle.

===Transit===
[[Image:Apollo 17 Cernan on moon.jpg|thumb|left|Schmitt took this picture of Cernan flanked by an American flag and their [[lunar rover]]'s umbrella-shaped high-gain antenna near the beginning of their third and final excursion across the lunar surface. The prominent Sculptured Hills lie in the background while Schmitt's reflection can just be made out in Cernan's helmet.]]
[[Image:Apollo 17 orange soil.jpg|thumb|left|Close-up of the orange soil discovered at Shorty crater, the result of volcanic glass beads.]]
During the transit to the Moon, the astronauts took a famous photograph of the earth known as &quot;[[The Blue Marble]]&quot;, which shows almost the entire continent of Africa and the continent of Antarctica. The other lunar landing missions that photographed the earth shortly after lunar orbit insertion showed the western hemisphere.

=== Landing ===
The landing site for this mission was on the southeastern rim of the [[Mare Serenitatis]], in the southwestern [[Montes Taurus]]. This was a dark mantle between three high, steep [[massif]]s, in an area known as the [[Taurus-Littrow]] region. Pre-mission photographs showed boulders deposited along the bases of the mountains, which could provide bedrock samples. The area also contained a landslide, several impact craters, and some dark craters which could be volcanic.

===EVAs===
Apollo 17 was a J-class mission. The crew used a [[Lunar Rover]] and conducted three lunar surface excursions, lasting 7.2, 7.6 and 7.3 hours. The mission returned {{convert|110.5|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of samples from the Moon.

Schmitt and Cernan collected a record {{convert|109|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of rocks during three Moonwalks. The crew roamed for {{convert|34|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} through the Taurus-Littrow valley in their rover, discovered orange-colored soil, and left the most comprehensive set of instruments in the [[ALSEP]] on the lunar surface. Their mission was the last in the Apollo lunar landing missions. The last 4 Apollo craft were used for the three [[Skylab]] missions and the [[ASTP]] mission in 1975.

===Return===
[[Image:Apollo 17 astronaut Ronald E. Evans performs an EVA to retrieve film cassettes during the trans-Earth coast.jpg|thumb|Command Module pilot Ron Evans performs a trans-earth EVA to retrieve film from the Apollo 17 SIM Bay camera]]
Eugene Cernan is, to date, the last man to have walked on the Moon. Just before he returned to the Lunar Module for the last time, he said,

:{{quote|As I take man's last step from the surface, back home for some time to come — but we believe not too long into the future — I'd like to just [say] what I believe history will record — that America's challenge of today has forged man's destiny of tomorrow. And, as we leave the Moon at Taurus-Littrow, we leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind. Godspeed the crew of Apollo 17.}}

Although Cernan's last words before liftoff have been widely quoted as the colorful &quot;Let's get this mother out of here&quot;, this is not supported by the transcript and audio recordings of the LM crew voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=November 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[lunar plaques|plaque]] left on the ladder of the descent stage of ''Challenger'' reads:

:{{quote|Here man completed his first explorations of the Moon December 1972 A.D. May the spirit of peace in which we came be reflected in the lives of all mankind.}}

The plaque shows two hemispheres of Earth and the near side of the Moon, and bears the signatures of Cernan, Evans, Schmitt, and [[Richard Nixon|President Richard M. Nixon]].

===Splashdown===
[[Image:Ap17-S72-55974.jpg|thumb|Apollo 17 recovery operations]]
The command module ''America'' [[splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashed down]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] near [[American Samoa]] at 19:24:59 [[UTC]] on December 19, 1972. The recovery operation was performed by US Navy helicopter squadron HC-1, with Commander Edward E Dahill III as prime recovery pilot flying helicopter 001. Commander Dahill flew the astronauts to the nearby recovery ship [[USS Ticonderoga (CV-14)|USS ''Ticonderoga'']]. They were subsequently flown from the recovery ship to [[Pago Pago International Airport]] in [[Tafuna, American Samoa|Tafuna]] where they were greeted with a Samoan reception before being flown on to [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]], then on to Houston.

Commander Eugene Cernan had taken a Czechoslovak flag with him to the Moon because his ancestors came from [[Czechoslovakia]]. Later he gave it to the [[Astronomical Institute of Czech Academy of Sciences|Institute of Astronomy]] in [[Ondřejov Observatory|Ondřejov]] (now [[Czech Republic]]).

== Mission insignia ==
[[Image:RobbinsMedallionApollo17ByPhilKonstantin.jpg|thumb|Robbins Medallion from Apollo 17]]
The circular patch is one of the most detailed of the Apollo series. The official [[NASA]] press release said: &quot;The insignia is dominated by the image of [[Apollo]], the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] sun god. Suspended in space behind the head of Apollo is an [[Bald Eagle|American eagle]] of contemporary design, the red bars of the eagle's wing represent the bars in the [[U.S. flag]]; the three white stars symbolize the three astronaut crewmen. The background is deep blue space and within it are the [[Moon]], the planet [[Saturn]] and a spiral [[galaxy]] or [[nebula]]. The Moon is partially overlaid by the eagle's wing suggesting that this is a celestial body that man has visited and in that sense conquered. The thrust of the eagle and the gaze of Apollo to the right and toward Saturn and the galaxy is meant to imply that man's goals in space will someday include the planets and perhaps the stars. The colors of the emblem are red, white and blue, the colors of the U.S. flag; with the addition of gold, to symbolize the golden age of [[space flight]] that will begin with this Apollo 17 lunar landing. The Apollo image used in this emblem was the profile of the ''[[Apollo Belvedere]]'' sculpture now in the Vatican Gallery in [[Rome]]. This emblem was designed by artist Robert T. McCall in collaboration with the astronauts.&quot; The insignia is surrounded by a light gray band with names of the crew and the words APOLLO XVII.

== Depiction in fiction ==
Portions of the Apollo 17 mission are dramatized in the miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' episode entitled [[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)#Episodes|&quot;Le Voyage dans la Lune&quot;]].

The novel ''[[Tyrannosaur Canyon]]'' by [[Douglas Preston]] opens with a depiction of the Apollo 17 Moonwalks using quotes taken from the official mission transcript.

Additionally, there have been fictional astronauts in film, literature and television who have been described as &quot;the last man to walk on the Moon,&quot; implying they were crew members on Apollo 17. One such character was [[Steve Austin (fictional character)|Steve Austin]] in the television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''. In the 1972 novel ''[[Cyborg (novel)|Cyborg]]'', upon which the series was based, Austin remembers watching the Earth &quot;fall away during Apollo XVII.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Caidin, Martin: ''Cyborg'', page 15. Warner Paperback Library, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; In an episode of the series, Austin clearly states that he flew on &quot;Apollo 17&quot;. Another example is the character of Captain Tanner played by [[Robert Duvall]] in the science fiction film ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]''.

The mission patch for Apollo 17 was used for the mission patch for the NASA space ship ''Charybdis'' in an episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' entitled &quot;[[The Royale]]&quot;.

In &quot;Le Voyage dans La Lune&quot;, Co-Executive Producer Tom Hanks gave Commander Gene Cernan a moment that he desperately wished for in real life. The episode shows Cernan carving the initials of his then 9-year-old daughter, Tracey, in the lunar dust. It was something Cernan had actually intended to do during the moon walk. However, the relentless pressure of the EVA Timeline actually prevented him from doing. (Based on a Cernan interview with reporter Dan Fiorucci in a 1999 interview conducted via satellite for a story that aired on WPHL-TV, Philadelphia)

:''In this article, inhabitants of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] of [[British America]] that supported the American Revolution are primarily referred to as &quot;Americans,&quot; with occasional references to &quot;[[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]]&quot;, &quot;Whigs,&quot; &quot;Rebels&quot; or &quot;Revolutionaries&quot;. Colonists who supported the British in opposing the Revolution are usually referred to as &quot;[[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]&quot; or &quot;Tories&quot;. The geographical area of the thirteen colonies is often referred to simply as &quot;America&quot;.''

&lt;!--Actual article beginning--&gt;
[[File:Declaration independence.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=About 50 men, most of them seated, are in a large meeting room. Most are focused on the five men standing in the center of the room. The tallest of the five is laying a document on a table.|[[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Trumbull's Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]'', showing the [[Committee of Five|five-man committee]] in charge of drafting the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in 1776 as it presents its work to the [[Second Continental Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]]]]
The '''American Revolution''' was the political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century in which [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen colonies]] in [[North America]] joined together to break free from the [[British Empire]], combining to become the [[United States|United States of America]]. They first rejected the authority of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] to govern them from overseas without representation, and then expelled all royal officials. By 1774 each colony had established a [[Provincial Congress]], or an equivalent governmental institution, to form individual self-governing [[State (polity)|states]]. The British responded by sending combat troops to re-impose direct rule. Through representatives sent in 1775 to the [[Second Continental Congress]], the new states joined together at first to defend their respective [[self-governance]] and manage the armed conflict against the British known as the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–83, also ''American War of Independence''). Ultimately, the states collectively determined that the British monarchy, by acts of [[tyrant|tyranny]], could no longer [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimately]] claim their [[allegiance]]. They then severed ties with the British Empire in July 1776, when the Congress issued the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], rejecting the monarchy on behalf of the new [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] nation. The war ended with effective American victory in October 1781, followed by formal British abandonment of any claims to the United States with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783.

The American Revolution was the result of a series of social, political, and intellectual transformations in early American society and government, collectively referred to as the ''[[American Enlightenment]]''. Americans rejected the [[Oligarchy|oligarchies]] common in [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] Europe at the time, championing instead the development of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] based on the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] understanding of [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]]. Among the significant results of the revolution was the creation of a democratically-elected representative government [[Consent of the governed|responsible to the will of the people]]. However, sharp political debates erupted over the appropriate level of [[democracy]] desirable in the new government, with a number of [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]] fearing [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]].

Many fundamental issues of national governance were settled with the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]] in 1788, which replaced the relatively weaker first attempt at a national government adopted in 1781, the ''[[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]]''. In contrast to the loose [[confederation]], the Constitution established a strong [[Federation|federated]] government. The [[United States Bill of Rights]] (1791), comprising the first 10 constitutional amendments, quickly followed. It guaranteed many &quot;[[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]]&quot; that were influential in justifying the revolution, and attempted to balance a strong national government with relatively broad [[Liberty|personal liberties]]. The American shift to liberal republicanism, and the gradually increasing democracy, caused an upheaval of traditional social hierarchy and gave birth to the ethic that has formed a core of political values in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood, 1992&quot;&gt;Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:British colonies 1763-76 shepherd1923.jpg|thumb|alt=Before the revolution: the thirteen colonies are in pink|Before the Revolution: The [[Thirteen Colonies]] are in pink]]
The American Revolution was predicated by a number of ideas and events that, combined, led to a political and social separation of colonial possessions from the home nation and a coalescing of those former individual colonies into an independent nation.

===Summary===
The American revolutionary era began in 1763, after a series of victories by British forces at the conclusion of the [[French and Indian War]] ended the French military threat to British North American colonies. Adopting the policy that the colonies should pay an increased proportion of the costs associated with keeping them in the Empire, Britain imposed a [[Stamp Act 1765|series of direct taxes]] followed by [[Intolerable Acts|other laws]] intended to demonstrate British authority, all of which proved extremely unpopular in America. Because [[No taxation without representation|the colonies lacked elected representation]] in the governing British Parliament, [[Sons of Liberty|many colonists]] considered the laws to be illegitimate and a violation of their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]]. In 1772, groups of colonists began to create ''[[Committee of correspondence|Committees of Correspondence]]'', which would lead to their own Provincial Congresses in most of the colonies. In the course of two years, the Provincial Congresses or their equivalents rejected the Parliament and effectively replaced the British ruling apparatus in the former colonies, culminating in 1774 with the coordinating [[First Continental Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, ''The Sparck of Rebellion'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In response to protests in [[Boston]] over Parliament's attempts to assert authority, the British sent combat troops, [[Dissolution (law)|dissolved]] local governments, and imposed direct rule by Royal officials. Consequently, the Colonies mobilized their [[Militia (United States)|militias]], and fighting broke out in 1775. First ostensibly loyal to [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], the repeated [[Olive Branch Petition|pleas]] by the First Continental Congress for royal intervention on their behalf with Parliament resulted in the [[Proclamation of Rebellion|declaration by the King]] that the states were &quot;in rebellion&quot;, and the members of Congress were [[Treason|traitors]]. In 1776, representatives from each of the original 13 states voted unanimously in the Second Continental Congress to adopt a Declaration of Independence, which now rejected the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]] in addition to its Parliament. The Declaration established the United States, which was originally governed as a loose confederation through a [[representative democracy]] selected by state legislatures (see ''[[Second Continental Congress]]'' and ''[[Congress of the Confederation]]'').

====Ideology behind the Revolution====

He is standing behind a table, holding a rolled up document in one hand, and pointing with the other hand to a large document on the table.|In this {{circa|1772}} portrait by [[John Singleton Copley]], Adams points at the [[Explanatory charter|Massachusetts Charter]], which he viewed as a constitution that protected the peoples' rights.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Revolutionary Politician'', 103, 136; Maier, ''Old Revolutionaries'', 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The ideological movement known as the American Enlightenment was a critical precursor to the American Revolution. Chief among the ideas of the American Enlightenment were the concepts of liberalism, democracy, republicanism, and [[Freedom of religion in the United States|religious tolerance]]. Collectively, the belief in these concepts by a growing number of American colonists began to foster an intellectual environment which would lead to a new sense of political and social identity.

[[John Locke]]'s (1632–1704) ideas on liberty greatly influenced the political thinking behind the revolution. John Locke's [[Two Treatises of Government]], published in 1689, influenced the thinking of later philosophers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778), as reflected in Rousseau's 1762 treatise entitled ''[[The Social Contract|Du contrat social]]''. The theory of the &quot;[[social contract]]&quot; influenced the belief among many of the Founders that among the &quot;natural rights&quot; of man was the [[Right of revolution|right of the people to overthrow their leaders]], should those leaders betray the historic [[rights of Englishmen]].&lt;ref&gt;Wraight, ''Rousseau's The Social Contract'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Toth1989&gt;Charles W. Toth, ''Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite: The American Revolution and the European Response.'' (1989) p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cohen2008&gt;page 101, Philosophical Tales, by Martin Cohen, (Blackwell 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of writing state and national constitutions, the Americans used [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]]'s analysis of the &quot;balanced&quot; British Constitution.

A motivating force behind the revolution was the American embrace of a political ideology called &quot;republicanism&quot;, which was dominant in the colonies by 1775. The republicanism was inspired by the &quot;[[Whig (British political party)|country party]]&quot; in Britain, whose critique of British government emphasized that [[political corruption|corruption]] was a terrible reality in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;name= Weintraub2005&gt;Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775-1783'' (2005) chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Americans feared the corruption was crossing the Atlantic; the commitment of most Americans to republican values and to their rights, energized the revolution, as Britain was increasingly seen as hopelessly corrupt and hostile to American interests. Britain seemed to threaten the established liberties that Americans enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, '' The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 125-37&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest threat to liberty was depicted as corruption—not just in [[London]] but at home as well. The colonists associated it with luxury and, especially, inherited aristocracy, which they condemned.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 35, 174-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Founding Fathers were strong advocates of republican values, particularly [[Samuel Adams]], [[Patrick Henry]], [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[George Washington]], [[James Madison]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]],&lt;ref&gt;Shalhope, ''Toward a Republican Synthesis'' (1972) pp.49-80&lt;/ref&gt; which required men to put civic duty ahead of their personal desires. Men had a civic duty to be prepared and willing to fight for the rights and liberties of their countrymen and countrywomen. John Adams, writing to [[Mercy Otis Warren]] in 1776, agreed with some [[Classical antiquity|classical]] Greek and Roman thinkers in that &quot;Public Virtue cannot exist without private, and public Virtue is the only Foundation of Republics.&quot; He continued: &lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;There must be a positive Passion for the public good, the public Interest, Honour, Power, and Glory, established in the Minds of the People, or there can be no Republican Government, nor any real Liberty. And this public Passion must be Superior to all private Passions. Men must be ready, they must pride themselves, and be happy to sacrifice their private Pleasures, Passions, and Interests, nay their private Friendships and dearest connections, when they Stand in Competition with the Rights of society.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rahe1994&gt;Adams quoted in Paul A. Rahe, ''Republics Ancient and Modern: Classical Republicanism and the American Revolution. Volume: 2'' (1994) P. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; For women, &quot;[[republican motherhood]]&quot; became the ideal, exemplified by [[Abigail Adams]] and [[Mercy Otis Warren]]; the first duty of the republican woman was to instill republican values in her children and to avoid luxury and ostentation.

Thomas Paine's best-seller pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' appeared in January 1776, after the Revolution had started. It was widely distributed and loaned, and often read aloud in [[Tavern#North_America|taverns]], contributing significantly to spreading the ideas of republicanism and liberalism, bolstering enthusiasm for separation from Britain, and encouraging recruitment for the Continental Army. Paine provided a new and widely accepted argument for independence, by advocating a complete break with history. ''Common Sense'' is oriented to the future in a way that compels the reader to make an immediate choice. It offered a solution for Americans disgusted and alarmed at the threat of tyranny.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, ''The Commonalities of Common Sense'' (2000) pp. 465–504&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dissenter|Dissenting]] (i.e. Protestant, non-[[Church of England]]) churches of the day were the &quot;school of democracy”&lt;ref name=Bonomi&gt;Bonomi, p. 186, Chapter 7 “Religion and the American Revolution&lt;/ref&gt; President [[John Witherspoon]] of the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]) wrote widely circulated sermons linking the American Revolution to the teachings of the Hebrew Bible. Throughout the colonies dissenting Protestant congregations ([[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[Baptists|Baptist]], and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]) preached Revolutionary themes in their sermons, while most Church of England ministers preached loyalty to the King.&lt;ref name=Nelson1961&gt;William H. Nelson, ''The American Tory'' (1961) p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Religious motivation for fighting tyranny reached across socioeconomic lines to encompass rich and poor, men and women, frontiersmen and townsmen, farmers and merchants.&lt;ref name=Bonomi/&gt;

The classical authors read in the Enlightenment period taught an abstract ideal of republican government that included hierarchical social orders of king, aristocracy and commoners. It was widely believed that British liberties relied on the balance of power between these three social orders, maintaining the hierarchical deference to the privileged class.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn,''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 273-4, 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Bernard Bailyn]] wrote that: {{quote|&quot;Puritanism … and the epidemic evangelism of the mid-eighteenth century, had created challenges to the traditional notions of social stratification” by preaching that the Bible taught all men are equal, that the true value of a man lies in his moral behavior, not his class, and that all can be saved.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn,''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (1992) p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Controversial British legislation===
The Revolution was in some ways incited by a number of pieces of legislation originating from the British Parliament that, for Americans, were illegitimate acts of a government that had no right to pass laws on Englishmen in the Americas who did not have elected representation in that government. For the British, policy makers saw these laws as necessary to rein in colonial subjects who, in the name of economic development that was designed to benefit the home nation, had been allowed near-autonomy for too long.

The British Empire at the time operated under the [[Mercantilism|mercantile system]], where all trade was concentrated inside the Empire, and trade with other empires was forbidden. The goal was to enrich Britain--its merchants and its government. Whether the policy was good for the colonists was not an issue in London, but Americans became increasingly restive with mercantilist policies&lt;ref&gt;Max Savelle, [http://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=mercantilism+%22colonial+OR+america%22+OR+%22American+OR+colonies%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5iDMTdXbKOniiAL7oeGABQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mercantilism%20%22colonial%20OR%20america%22%20OR%20%22American%20OR%20colonies%22&amp;f=false ''Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind'' (2005) pp. 204-211]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Britain implemented mercantilism by trying to block American trade with the French, Spanish or Dutch empires using the [[Navigation Acts]], which Americans avoided as often as they could. The royal officials responded to smuggling with open-ended search warrants ([[Writ of assistance|Writs of Assistance]]). In 1761, Boston lawyer [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] argued that the writs violated the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutional rights]] of the colonists. He lost the case, but John Adams later wrote, &quot;Then and there the child Independence was born.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stephens2006&gt;Stephens, ''Unreasonable Searches and Seizures'' (2006) p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1762, Patrick Henry argued the [[Parson's Cause]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]], where the legislature had passed a law and it was vetoed by the king. Henry argued, &quot;that a King, by disallowing Acts of this salutary nature, from being the father of his people, degenerated into a Tyrant and forfeits all right to his subjects' obedience&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Miller1943&quot;&gt;Miller (1943)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following their victory in the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763, Great Britain took control of the French holdings in North America, outside the Caribbean. The British sought to maintain peaceful relations with those Indian tribes that had allied with the French, and keep them separated from the American frontiersmen. To this end, the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] restricted settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] as this was designated an [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin G. Calloway, ''The Scratch of a Pen: 1763 and the Transformation of North America'' (2006), pp 92-98&lt;/ref&gt; Disregarding the proclamation, some groups of settlers continued to move west and establish farms.&lt;ref&gt;W.

====1764–1766: More provocative legislation====
{{Main|Sugar Act|Currency Act|Quartering Acts|Stamp Act 1765|Declaratory Act}}
{{See|No taxation without representation|Virtual representation}}

Britain did not expect the colonies to contribute to the interest or the retirement of debt incurred during its wars, but they did expect a portion of the expenses for colonial defense to be paid by the Americans. Estimating the expenses of defending the continental colonies and the [[British West Indies]] to be approximately £200,000 annually, the British goal after the end of this war was that the colonies would be taxed for £78,000 of this amount. The colonists objected chiefly on the grounds not that the taxes were high (they were low)&lt;ref&gt;Englishmen paid on average twenty-five shillings annually in taxes whereas Americans paid only sixpence. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (1943) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; but that they had no representation in the Parliament. Parliament insisted it had the right to levy any tax without colonial approval, to demonstrate that it had authority over the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The colonists did not object to the principle of contributing to the cost of their defense (colonial legislatures spent large sums raising and outfitting militias during the French and Indian War), but they disputed the need for the Crown to station regular British troops in North America. In the absence of a French threat, colonists believed the colonial militias (which were funded by taxes raised by colonial legislatures) to be sufficient to deal with any trouble with natives on the frontier. Officer positions were in high demand among the British aristocracy—the rank of captain or major sold for thousands of pounds, and could be resold once an officer purchased an even higher rank.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shy, Toward Lexington 2008&quot;&gt;Shy, ''Toward Lexington'' (2008) pp 69-73&lt;/ref&gt; The British wanted all the commissions for themselves, and were unwilling to commission colonial officers (who would pay nothing for their commissions) and further asserted that officers with colonial commissions must submit to the authority of any regular British officer, regardless of rank. This effectively negated the will or the legal authority of the colonies to contribute to defense through their militias. With some 1,500 well-connected British officers who would have become redundant in the aftermath of the Seven Years War, London would have had to discharge them if they did not assign them to North America.&lt;ref&gt;Shy, ''Toward Lexington'' 73-78&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore the main reason for Parliament imposing taxes was to prove its supremacy, and the main use of the tax funds would be patronage for ambitious British officers.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Knollenberg, ''Origin of the American Revolution: 1759-1766'' (1960) pp 76-87&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan &quot;[[No taxation without representation]]&quot; summed up this American position. London responded that [[virtual representation|the colonists were &quot;virtually represented&quot;]]; but most Americans rejected this.&lt;ref&gt;William S. Carpenter, &quot;Taxation Without Representation&quot; in ''Dictionary of American History, Volume 7'' (1976); Miller (1943)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1764, Parliament enacted the [[Sugar Act]] and the [[Currency Act]], further vexing the colonists. Protests led to a powerful new weapon, the systematic [[boycott]] of British goods. The following year, the British enacted the [[Quartering Acts]], which required British soldiers to be quartered at the expense of residents in certain areas. Colonists objected to this, as well.

In 1765 the Stamp Act was the first [[direct tax]] levied on the colonies by British Prime Minister [[George Grenville]] and the Parliament. All official documents, newspapers, almanacs, and pamphlets— decks of playing cards—were required to have the stamps. The colonists still considered themselves loyal subjects of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Crown]], with the same historic rights and obligations as subjects in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, representatives of all 13 colonies protested vehemently, as popular leaders such as Patrick Henry in Virginia and James Otis in Massachusetts, rallied the people in opposition. A secret group, the &quot;[[Sons of Liberty]]&quot; formed in many towns and threatened violence if anyone sold the stamps, and no one did.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''From Resistance to Revolution'' (1991) pp. 77-112&lt;/ref&gt; In Boston, the Sons of Liberty burned the records of the vice-admiralty court and looted the home of the chief justice, [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. Several legislatures called for united action, and nine colonies sent delegates to the [[Stamp Act Congress]] in [[New York City]] in October 1765. Moderates led by [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] drew up a &quot;[[Declaration of Rights and Grievances]]&quot; stating that taxes passed without representation violated their [[Rights of Englishmen]]. Colonists emphasized their determination by boycotting imports of British merchandise. In London, the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Rockingham]] government came to power and Parliament debated whether to repeal the stamp tax or send an army to enforce it. Benjamin Franklin made the case for repeal, explaining the colonies had spent heavily in manpower, money, and blood in defense of the empire in a series of wars against the French and Indians, and that further taxes to pay for those wars were unjust and might bring about a rebellion. Parliament agreed and repealed the tax, but in the [[Declaratory Act]] of March 1766 insisted that parliament retained full power to make laws for the colonies &quot;in all cases whatsoever&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Miller1943&quot;/&gt;

====1767–1773: Townshend Acts and the Tea Act====
{{Main|Townshend Acts|Tea Act}}
{{See|Massachusetts Circular Letter|Boston Massacre|Boston Tea Party}}
[[File:Gaspee Affair.jpg|thumb|alt=Burning of the Gaspée|Burning of the ''[[Gaspée Affair|Gaspée]]'']]

In 1767, the Parliament passed the [[Townshend Acts]], which placed a tax on a number of essential goods including paper, glass, and tea. Angered at the tax increases, colonists organized a boycott of British goods. In Boston on March 5, 1770, a large mob gathered around a group of British soldiers. The mob grew more and more threatening, throwing snowballs, rocks and debris at the soldiers. One soldier was clubbed and fell. All but one of the soldiers fired into the crowd. 11 people were hit; three civilians were killed at the scene of the shooting, and two died after the incident. The event quickly came to be called the [[Boston Massacre]]. Although the soldiers were tried and acquitted (defended by John Adams), the widespread descriptions soon became propaganda to turn colonial sentiment against the British. This in turn began a downward spiral in the relationship between Britain and the Province of Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Hiller B. Zobel, ''The Boston Massacre'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|alt=Two ships in a harbor, one in the distance.

In June 1772, in what became known as the [[Gaspée Affair|''Gaspée'' Affair]], a British warship that had been vigorously enforcing unpopular trade regulations was burned by American [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]] including [[John Brown (Rhode Island)|John Brown]]. Soon afterward, Governor Thomas Hutchinson of Massachusetts reported that he and the royal judges would be paid directly from London, thus bypassing the colonial legislature.

On December 16, 1773, a group of men, led by Samuel Adams and dressed to evoke [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], boarded the ships of the government-favored [[East India Company|British East India Company]] and dumped an estimated £10,000 worth of tea from its holds (approximately £636,000 in 2008) into the harbor. This event became known as the [[Boston Tea Party]] and remains a significant part of American patriotic lore.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin L. Carp, ''Defiance of the Patriots: The Boston Tea Party and the Making of America'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Quebec Act|Intolerable Acts}}

The [[Quebec Act]] of 1774 extended [[Quebec]]'s boundaries to the [[Ohio River]], shutting out the claims of the 13 colonies. By then, however, the Americans had little regard for new laws from London; they were drilling militia and organizing for war.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The British government responded by passing several Acts which came to be known as the [[Intolerable Acts]], which further darkened colonial opinion towards the British. They consisted of four laws enacted by the British parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1943) pp. 353–76&lt;/ref&gt; The first was the [[Massachusetts Government Act]], which altered the Massachusetts charter and restricted town meetings. The second Act, the [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Administration of Justice Act]], ordered that all British soldiers to be tried were to be arraigned in Britain, not in the colonies. The third Act was the [[Boston Port Act]], which closed the port of Boston until the British had been compensated for the tea lost in the Boston Tea Party (the British never received such a payment). The fourth Act was the Quartering Acts of 1774, which allowed royal governors to house British troops in the homes of citizens without requiring permission of the owner.

[[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] argued in 1775 for the British position that Englishmen paid on average 25 shillings annually in taxes whereas Americans paid only sixpence.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p.89&lt;/ref&gt; The colonists countered that North's argument failed to take into consideration the taxes collected by colonial governments and allocated for local purposes. The colonists believed, especially considering the economic restraints the British were keen to enforce in the colonies, that any additional tax burden from London was excessive.

===American political opposition===
{{See|Suffolk Resolves|Declaration of Rights and Grievances|Continental Association|Petition to the King (1774)|Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress|Conciliatory Resolution|Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms|Olive Branch Petition|Hutchinson Letters Affair}}

American political opposition was initially through the colonial assemblies such as the Stamp Act Congress, which included representatives from across the colonies. In 1765, the [[Sons of Liberty]] were formed which used public demonstrations, violence and threats of violence to ensure that the British tax laws were unenforceable. While openly hostile to what they considered an oppressive Parliament acting illegally, colonists persisted in sending numerous petitions and pleas for intervention from a monarch to whom they still claimed loyalty. In late 1772 Samuel Adams in Boston set about creating new Committees of Correspondence, which linked Patriots in all 13 colonies and eventually provided the framework for a rebel government. In early 1773 Virginia, the largest colony, set up its Committee of Correspondence, on which Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson served.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 22–24&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of about 7000 to 8000 Patriots served on [[Committees of Correspondence]] at the colonial and local levels, comprising most of the leadership in their communities—the Loyalists were excluded. The committees became the leaders of the American resistance to British actions, and largely determined the war effort at the state and local level. When the First Continental Congress decided to boycott British products, the colonial and local Committees took charge, examining merchant records and publishing the names of merchants who attempted to defy the boycott by importing British goods. They promoted patriotism and home manufacturing, advising Americans to avoid luxuries and lead more simple lives. The committees gradually extended their power over many aspects of American public life. They set up espionage networks to identify disloyal elements, displaced the royal officials, and helped topple the entire imperial system in each colony. In late 1774 in early 1775, they supervised the elections of provincial conventions, which took over the operation of colonial governments.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation'' (6th ed. 2001) vol 1 pp 144-145&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the ''Massachusetts Government Act'', Massachusetts and other colonies formed local governments called [[Provincial Congress]]es. In 1774, the [[First Continental Congress]] convened, consisting of representatives from each of the Provincial Congresses or their equivalents, to serve as a vehicle for deliberation and collective action. Standing [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committees of Safety]] were created by each Provincial Congress or equivalent for the enforcement of the resolutions by the Committees of Correspondence, Provincial Congress, and the Continental Congress. Some British colonies in North America remained loyal to the Crown. These colonies included [[Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] in present-day Canada, the former Spanish colonies of [[West Florida]] and [[East Florida]], and [[Bermuda]].

==Factions==
The population of the 13 Colonies was far from homogeneous, particularly in their political views and attitudes. Loyalties and allegiances varied widely not only within regions and communities, but also within families and sometimes shifted during the course of the Revolution.

===King George III===
The war became a personal issue for [[George III of the United Kingdom|the king]], fueled by his growing belief that British leniency would be taken as weakness by the Americans. The king also sincerely believed he was defending Britain's constitution against usurpers, rather than opposing patriots fighting for their natural rights.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy, &quot;'If Others Will Not Be Active, I must Drive': George III and the American Revolution.&quot; ''Early American Studies'' 2004 2(1): pp 1-46. P. D. G. Thomas, &quot;George III and the American Revolution.&quot; ''History'' 1985 70(228): 16-31, says the king played a minor role before 1775.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patriots===
{{Main|Patriot (American Revolution)}}
{{See|Sons of Liberty}}
At the time, revolutionaries were called &quot;Patriots&quot;, &quot;Whigs&quot;, &quot;Congress-men&quot;, or &quot;Americans&quot;. They included a full range of social and economic classes, but were unanimous regarding the need to defend the rights of Americans and uphold the principles of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] in terms of rejecting monarchy and aristocracy, while emphasizing civic virtue on the part of the citizens.

====Role of women====
[[File:Abigail Adams.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Abigail Adams|[[Abigail Adams]]]]
{{Main|Women in the American Revolution}}

Women contributed to the American Revolution in many ways, and were involved on both sides. While formal Revolutionary politics did not include women, ordinary domestic behaviors became charged with political significance as Patriot women confronted a war that permeated all aspects of political, civil, and domestic life. They participated by boycotting British goods, spying on the British, following armies as they marched, washing, cooking, and tending for soldiers, delivering secret messages, and in a few cases like [[Deborah Samson]], fighting disguised as men. Above all, they continued the agricultural work at home to feed their families and the armies. They maintained their families during their husbands' absences and sometimes after their deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berkin, 2006 p. 59-60&quot;&gt;Berkin, ''Revolutionary Mothers'' (2006) p. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;

American women were integral to the success of the boycott of British goods,&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 41&lt;/ref&gt; as the boycotted items were largely household items such as tea and cloth. Women had to return to knitting goods, and to spinning and weaving their own cloth — skills that had fallen into disuse. In 1769, the women of Boston produced 40,000 skeins of yarn, and 180 women in [[Middletown, Massachusetts]] wove {{convert|20522|yd|m|0}} of cloth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berkin, 2006 p. 59-60&quot;/&gt;

A crisis of political loyalties could disrupt the fabric of colonial America women’s social worlds: whether a man did or did not renounce his allegiance to the King could dissolve ties of class, family, and friendship, isolating women from former connections. A woman’s loyalty to her husband, once a private commitment, could become a political act, especially for women in America committed to men who remained loyal to the King. Legal divorce, usually rare, was granted to Patriot women whose husbands supported the King.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber, ''Women of the Republic'' (1997) chapters 4 and 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton, ''Liberty's Daughters: The Revolutionary Experience of American Women'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Class and psychology ====
Looking back, John Adams concluded in 1818:
:&quot;The Revolution was effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people....This radical change in the principles, opinions, sentiments, and affections of the people was the real American Revolution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Ferling, ''Setting the World Ablaze: Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and the American Revolution'' (2002) p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of class, Loyalists tended to have longstanding social and economic connections to British merchants and government; for instance, prominent merchants in major port cities such as New York, Boston and Charleston tended to be Loyalists, as did men involved with the [[fur trade]] along the northern frontier. In addition, officials of colonial government and their staffs, those who had established positions and status to maintain, favored maintaining relations with Great Britain. They often were linked to British families in England by marriage as well.

By contrast, Patriots by number tended to be [[Yeoman#United_States|yeomen farmer]]s, especially in the frontier areas of New York and the backcountry of Pennsylvania, Virginia and down the Appalachian mountains. They were craftsmen and small merchants. Leaders of both the Patriots and the Loyalists were men of educated, propertied classes. The Patriots included many prominent men of the [[planter]] class from Virginia and South Carolina, for instance, who became leaders during the Revolution, and formed the new government at the national and state levels.  

To understand the opposing groups, historians have assessed evidence of their hearts and minds. In the mid-20th century, historian [[Leonard Woods Labaree]] identified eight characteristics of the Loyalists that made them essentially conservative; traits to those characteristic of the Patriots.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labaree, 1948 pp. 164-5&quot;&gt;Labaree, ''Conservatism in Early American History'' (1948) pp. 164-5&lt;/ref&gt; Older and better established men, Loyalists tended to resist innovation. They thought resistance to the Crown—which they insisted was the only legitimate government—was morally wrong, while the Patriots thought morality was on their side. Loyalists were alienated when the Patriots resorted to violence, such as burning houses and [[tarring and feathering]]. Loyalists wanted to take a centrist position and resisted the Patriots' demand to declare their opposition to the Crown. Many Loyalists, especially merchants in the port cities, had maintained strong and long-standing relations with Britain (often with business and family links to other parts of the British Empire). Many Loyalists realized that independence was bound to come eventually, but they were fearful that revolution might lead to anarchy, tyranny or mob rule. In contrast, the prevailing attitude among Patriots, who made systematic efforts to use mob violence in a controlled manner, was a desire to seize the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Hull et al, ''Choosing Sides'' (1978) pp. 344–66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burrows and Wallace, ''The American Revolution'' (1972) pp. 167–305&lt;/ref&gt; Labaree also wrote that Loyalists were pessimists who lacked the confidence in the future displayed by the Patriots.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labaree, 1948 pp. 164-5&quot;/&gt;

Historians in the early 20th century, such as [[J. Franklin Jameson]], examined the class composition of the Patriot cause, looking for evidence of a class war inside the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin Jameson, ''The American Revolution Considered as a Social Movement'' (1926); other historians pursuing the same line of thought included [[Charles Beard]], [[Carl Becker]] and [[Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the last 50&amp;nbsp;years, historians have largely abandoned that interpretation, emphasizing instead the high level of ideological unity.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''Rhetoric and Reality in the American Revolution'' (1966) pp. 3–32&lt;/ref&gt; Just as there were rich and poor Loyalists, the Patriots were a 'mixed lot', with the richer and better educated more likely to become officers in the Army. Ideological demands always came first: the Patriots viewed independence as a means to gain freedom from British oppression and taxation and, above all, to reassert what they considered to be their rights as English subjects. Most yeomen farmers, craftsmen, and small merchants joined the Patriot cause to demand more political equality. They were especially successful in the Pennsylvania but less so in New England, where John Adams attacked Thomas Paine's ''Common Sense'' for the &quot;absurd democratical notions&quot; it proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Resch (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loyalists===
{{Main|Loyalist (American Revolution)}}

While there is no way of knowing the actual numbers, historians have estimated that about 15–20% of the population remained loyal to the British Crown; these were known at the time as &quot;Loyalists&quot;, &quot;Tories&quot;, or &quot;King's men&quot;. The Loyalists never controlled territory unless the British Army occupied it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoon, 1992 p. 235&quot;&gt;Calhoon, ''Loyalism and Neutrality'' (1992) p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Loyalists were typically older, less willing to break with old loyalties, often connected to the [[Church of England]], and included many established merchants with business connections across the Empire, as well as royal officials such as Thomas Hutchinson of Boston. The revolution sometimes divided families; for example, the Franklins. [[William Franklin]], son of Benjamin Franklin and governor of the [[Province of New Jersey]] remained Loyal to the Crown throughout the war and never spoke to his father again. Recent immigrants who had not been fully Americanized were also inclined to support the King, such as recent Scottish settlers in the back country; among the more striking examples of this, see [[Flora MacDonald (Scottish Jacobite)|Flora MacDonald]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoon, 1992 p. 235&quot;/&gt;

After the war, the great majority of the 450,000–500,000 Loyalists remained in America and resumed normal lives. Some, such as [[Samuel Seabury (1729–1796)|Samuel Seabury]], became prominent American leaders. Estimates vary, but about 62,000 Loyalists relocated to Canada, and others to Britain (7,000) or to Florida or the [[West Indies]] (9,000). This made up approximately 2% of the total population of the colonies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pole 1994&quot;&gt;Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 20–22&lt;/ref&gt; When Loyalists left the [[Southern United States|South]] in 1783, they took thousands of blacks with them as slaves to the British West Indies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pole 1994&quot;/&gt;

===Neutrals===
A minority of uncertain size tried to stay neutral in the war. Most kept a low profile. However, the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], especially in Pennsylvania, were the most important group that was outspoken for neutrality. As Patriots declared independence, the Quakers, who continued to do business with the British, were attacked as supporters of British rule, &quot;contrivers and authors of seditious publications&quot; critical of the revolutionary cause.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlieb 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other participants==
===Spain===
Spain did not officially recognize the U.S. but became an informal ally when it declared war on Britain on June 21, 1779. [[Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid]], general of the Spanish forces in [[New Spain]], also served as governor of Louisiana. He led an expedition of colonial troops to force the British out of Florida and keep open a vital conduit for supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Buchanan Parker, ''Spain: Forgotten Ally of the American Revolution'' North Quincy, Mass.: Christopher Publishing House, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In early 1776, France set up a major program of aid to the Americans, and the Spanish secretly added funds. Each country spent one million &quot;livres tournaises&quot; to buy munitions. A [[dummy corporation]] run by [[Pierre Beaumarchais]] concealed their activities. Americans obtained some munitions through [[Holland]] as well as French and Spanish ports in the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution'' (1985) pp. 57–65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native Americans===
Most [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]] rejected pleas that they remain neutral and supported the British Crown. In its trying to prohibit colonial settlement west of the Applachian Mountains, Great Britain was supporting the tribes. The great majority of the 200,000 Native Americans east of the Mississippi distrusted the colonists and supported the British cause, hoping to forestall continued colonial encroachment on their territories.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (2004) chapters 19, 46 and 51; Colin G. Calloway, ''The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Those tribes that were more closely involved in colonial trade tended to side with the revolutionaries, although political factors were important as well. 

Although there was little major Native American participation during the war except for four of the [[Iroquois]] nations, the British provided Indians with funding and weapons to attack American outposts. Some Indians tried to remain neutral, seeing little value in joining a European conflict and fearing reprisals from whichever side they opposed. A few, such as the [[Oneida]] and [[Tuscarora]] peoples in New York, supported the American cause.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph T. Glatthaar and James Kirby Martin, ''Forgotten Allies: The Oneida Indians and the American Revolution'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The British provided arms for the Indians, under Loyalist leadership, to raid frontier settlements from the [[Province of Carolina|Carolinas]] to New York. They killed many scattered settlers, especially in Pennsylvania. In 1776 [[Cherokee]] war parties attacked American colonists all along the southern frontier of the uplands.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Hatley, ''The Dividing Paths: Cherokees and South Carolinians through the Era of Revolution'' (1993); James H. O'Donnell, III, ''Southern Indians in the American Revolution'' (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; While the Cherokee could launch raids numbering a couple hundred warriors, as seen in the [[Chickamauga Wars]], they could not mobilize enough forces to fight a major invasion without allies. 

The most prominent Native American leader siding with the King was [[Joseph Brant]] of the powerful [[Mohawk nation]], part of the Iroquois Confederacy based in New York. In 1778 and 1780, he led 300 Iroquois warriors and 100 white Loyalists in multiple attacks on small frontier settlements in New York and Pennsylvania, killing many settlers and destroying villages, crops and stores.&lt;ref&gt;see Barbara Graymont, &quot;Thayendanegea&quot;, [http://www.biographi.ca/EN/ShowBio.asp?BioId=36808&amp;query=joseph%20AND%20brant ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Seneca, Onondaga and Cayuga of the Iroquois Confederacy also allied with the British against the Americans. In 1779 the Continentals retaliated with an American army under [[John Sullivan]], which raided and destroyed 40 empty Iroquois villages in central and western New York.&lt;ref&gt;Colin G. Calloway, ''The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan's forces systematically burned the villages and destroyed about 160,000 bushels of corn that comprised the winter food supply. Facing starvation and homeless for the winter, the Iroquois fled to the Niagara Falls area and to Canada, mostly to what became Ontario. The British resettled them there after the war, providing land grants as compensation for some of their losses.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph R. Fischer, ''A Well-Executed Failure: The Sullivan Campaign against the Iroquois, July–September 1779'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the peace conference following the war, the British ceded lands which they did not really control, and did not consult about it with their Indian allies. They &quot;transferred&quot; control to the Americans of all the land east of the Mississippi and north of Florida. The historian Calloway concludes:
:Burned villages and crops, murdered chiefs, divided councils and civil wars, migrations, towns and forts choked with refugees, economic disruption, breaking of ancient traditions, losses in battle and to disease and hunger, betrayal to their enemies, all made the American Revolution one of the darkest periods in American Indian history.&lt;ref&gt;Calloway (1995) p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

The British did not give up their forts in the West (what is now the Ohio to Wisconsin) until 1796; they kept alive the dream of forming a satellite Indian nation there, which they called a Neutral Indian Zone. That goal was one of the causes of the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Dwight L. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1989 | title = A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea | url = | journal = Northwest Ohio Quarterly | volume = 61 | issue = 2–4| pages = 46–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis M.

===African Americans ===
{{See|Slavery in the United States}}
Free blacks in the North and South fought on both sides of the Revolution, but most fought for the colonial rebels. [[Crispus Attucks]], who died in a conflict in Boston in 1770, is considered the first martyr of the American Revolution. Both sides offered freedom and re-settlement to slaves who were willing to fight for them, especially targeting slaves whose owners supported the opposing cause.

Many African-American slaves became politically active during these years in support of the King, as they thought Great Britain might abolish slavery in the colonies. Tens of thousands used the turmoil of war to escape, and the southern plantation economies of South Carolina and Georgia especially were disrupted. During the Revolution, the British tried to turn slavery against the Americans,&lt;ref name=&quot;Revolutionary War: The Home Front&quot;&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/amrev/homefrnt/homefrnt.html Revolutionary War: The Home Front], The Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt; but historian David Brion Davis explains the difficulties with a policy of wholesale arming of the slaves: {{quote|But England greatly feared the effects of any such move on its own [[West Indies]], where Americans had already aroused alarm over a possible threat to incite slave [[insurrection]]s. The British elites also understood that an all-out attack on one form of property could easily lead to an assault on all boundaries of privilege and social order, as envisioned by radical religious sects in Britain’s seventeenth-century civil wars.&lt;ref&gt;Davis p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Davis underscored the British dilemma: &quot;Britain, when confronted by the rebellious American colonists, hoped to exploit their fear of [[Slave rebellion|slave revolts]] while also reassuring the large number of slave-holding Loyalists and wealthy Caribbean planters and merchants that their slave property would be secure&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Davis p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; The colonists accused the British of encouraging slave revolts.&lt;ref&gt;Schama pp. 28-30 p. 78-90&lt;/ref&gt;

American advocates of independence were commonly lampooned in Britain for what was termed their hypocritical calls for freedom, at the same time that many of their leaders were planters who held hundreds of slaves. [[Samuel Johnson]] snapped, &quot;how is it we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the [slave] drivers of the Negroes?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775-1783'' (2005) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin Franklin countered by criticizing the British self-congratulation about &quot;the freeing of one Negro&quot; ([[Somersett's Case|Somersett]]) while they continued to permit the [[Slave Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Schama, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phyllis Wheatley]], a black poet who popularized the image of [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] to represent America, came to public attention when her ''Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral'' appeared in 1773.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hochschild p.50-51&quot;&gt;Hochschild p.50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, slaves escaped from across New England and the mid-Atlantic area to British-occupied cities, such as New York. The effects of the war were more dramatic in the South. In Virginia the royal governor Lord [[Dunmore]] recruited black men into the British forces with the promise of freedom, protection for their families, and land grants. Tens of thousands of slaves escaped to British lines throughout the South, causing dramatic losses to slaveholders and disrupting cultivation and harvesting of crops. For instance, [[South Carolina]] was estimated to lose about 25,000 slaves, or one third of its slave population, to flight, migration or death. From 1770-1790, the black proportion of the population (mostly slaves) in South Carolina dropped from 60.5 percent to 43.8 percent; and in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] from 45.2 percent to 36.1 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619-1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

When the British evacuated its forces from [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], it also gave transportation to 10,000 slaves, carrying through on its commitment to them.&lt;ref&gt;Kolchin, ''American Slavery'', p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; They evacuated and resettled more than 3,000 &quot;[[Black Loyalist]]s&quot; to [[Nova Scotia]], [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]]. Others sailed with the British to England or were resettled in the [[West Indies]] of the Caribbean. More than 1200 of the Black Loyalists of Nova Scotia later resettled in the British colony of [[History of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone]], where they became leaders of the [[Krio]] ethnic group of Freetown and the later national government. Many of their descendants still live in Sierra Leone, as well as other African countries.&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2007), see also [http://www.blackloyalist.com/ blackloyalist.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some slaves understood Revolutionary rhetoric as promising freedom and equality. Both British and American governments made promises of freedom for service, and many slaves fought in one or the other armies. Starting in 1777, northern states started to abolish slavery, beginning with Vermont, which ended it under its new state constitution. By court cases, Massachusetts effectively ended slavery before the end of the century. Usually states instituted abolition on a gradual schedule with no government compensation of the owners, and many states, such as New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, required long apprenticeships of former slave children before they gained freedom and came of age as adults. 

In the first two decades after the war, the legislatures of Virginia, Maryland and Delaware made it easier for slaveholders to manumit their slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Kolchin, ''American Slavery'', p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous slaveholders in the Upper South took advantage of the changes: the proportion of free blacks went from less than one percent before the war to more than 10 percent overall by 1810.&lt;ref name=&quot;KolchinAmerican&quot;&gt;Kolchin, ''American Slavery'', p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; In Virginia alone, the number of free blacks climbed: from less than one percent in 1782, to 4.2 percent in 1790, and 13.5 percent in 1810.&lt;ref name=&quot;KolchinAmerican&quot; /&gt; In Delaware, three-quarters of blacks were free by 1810.&lt;ref&gt;Kolchin, ''American Slavery'', p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; After this time, few slaves were freed in the South, except those who were favorites or the master's children. The demand for slaves rose with the growth of cotton as a commodity crop, especially after the invention of the [[cotton gin]], which enabled the widespread cultivation of short-staple cotton in the upland regions. Although the international slave trade was prohibited, the slave population in the United States increased by the formation of families and survival of children throughout the South. As the demand for slave labor in the Upper South decreased due to changes in crops, planters began selling their slaves to traders and markets to the [[Deep South]] in an internal [[slave trade]]; it would cause the [[forced migration]] of an estimated one million slaves during the following decades, breaking up countless families, as young males were most in demand.

{{See|Shot heard round the world|Boston campaign|Invasion of Canada (1775)}}

The [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Battle of Lexington and Concord]] took place April 19, 1775, when the British sent a force of roughly 1000 troops to confiscate arms and arrest revolutionaries in Concord, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Morrisey p.35&lt;/ref&gt; They clashed with the local militia, marking the first fighting of the American Revolutionary War. The news aroused the 13 colonies to call out their militias and send troops to [[Siege of Boston|besiege Boston]]. The [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] followed on June 17, 1775. While a British victory, it was at a great cost; about 1,000 British casualties from a garrison of about 6,000, as compared to 500 American casualties from a much larger force.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey. ''&quot;A few bloody noses&quot;'' (2002) pp. 208-210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urban p.74&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second Continental Congress convened in 1775, after the war had started. The Congress created the [[Continental Army]] and extended the [[Olive Branch Petition]] to the crown as an attempt at reconciliation. King George III refused to receive it, issuing instead the [[Proclamation of Rebellion]], requiring action against the &quot;traitors&quot;.

In the winter of 1775, the Americans [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invaded Canada]]. General [[Richard Montgomery]] captured [[Montreal]] but a joint [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|attack on Quebec]] with the help of [[Benedict Arnold]] failed.

In March 1776, with George Washington as the commander of the new army, the Continental Army forced the British to [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|evacuate Boston]]. The revolutionaries were now in full control of all 13 colonies and were ready to declare independence. While there still were many Loyalists, they were no longer in control anywhere by July 1776, and all of the Royal officials had fled.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1948) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prisoners===
{{Main|Prisoners in the American Revolutionary War}}
In August 1775, George III declared Americans in arms against royal authority to be traitors to the Crown. The British government at first started treating captured rebel combatants as common criminals and preparations were made to bring them to trial for treason. American Secretary [[Lord Germain]] and First Lord of the Admiralty [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]] were especially eager to do so, with a particular emphasis on those who had previously served in British units (and thereby sworn an oath of allegiance to the crown).

Many of the prisoners taken by the British at Bunker Hill apparently expected to be hanged, but British authorities declined to take the next step: treason trials and executions. The dilemma was that tens of thousands of Loyalists were under American control and American retaliation would have been easy. The British built much of their strategy around using these Loyalists. After the surrender at Saratoga in October 1777, furthermore, there were thousands of British and Hessian soldiers in American hands. Therefore no Americans were put on trial for treason. The British maltreated the prisoners they held, resulting in more deaths to American sailors and soldiers than combat operations.&lt;ref&gt;Larry G. Bowman, ''Captive Americans: Prisoners During the American Revolution'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war, both sides released their surviving prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Miller, ''Triumph of Freedom, 1775–1783'' (1948) p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finance==
Britain's war against the Americans, French and Spanish cost about £100 million. The Treasury borrowed 40% of the money it needed.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'' (1987) pp. 81, 119&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy spending brought France to the [[Causes of the French Revolution#Economics and finances|verge of bankruptcy and revolution]], while the British had relatively little difficulty financing their war, keeping their suppliers and soldiers paid, and hiring tens of thousands of German soldiers. Britain had a sophisticated financial system based on the wealth of thousands of landowners, who supported the government, together with banks and financiers in London The efficient British tax system collected about 12 percent of the GDP in taxes during the 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;John Brewer, ''The sinews of power: war, money, and the English state, 1688-1783'' (1990) p 91&lt;/ref&gt;

In sharp contrast, Congress and the American states had no end of difficulty financing the war.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis P. Nettels, ''The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775-1815'' (1962) pp 23-44&lt;/ref&gt; In 1775 there was at most 12 million dollars in gold in the colonies, not nearly enough to cover current transactions, let alone on a major war. The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port, which cut off almost all imports and exports. One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from militiamen, and donations from patriotic citizens. Another was to delay actual payments, pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency, and promise it would be made good after the war. Indeed, in 1783 the soldiers and officers were given land grants to cover the wages they had earned but had not been paid during the war. Not until 1781, when [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] was named [[Superintendent of Finance of the United States]], did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters. Morris used a French loan in 1782 to set up the private Bank of North America to finance the war. Seeking greater efficiency, Morris reduced the civil list, saved money by using competitive bidding for contracts, tightened accounting procedures, and demanded the federal government's full share of money and supplies from the states.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Rappleye, ''Robert Morris: Financier of the American Revolution'' (2010) pp 225-52&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress used four main methods to cover the cost of the war, which cost about 66 million dollars in specie (gold and silver).&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Harry Chitwood, ''A History of Colonial America'' (1961) pp 586-589&lt;/ref&gt; Congress made two issues of paper money, in 1775-1780, and in 1780-81. The first issue amounted to 242 million dollars. This paper money would supposedly be redeemed for state taxes, but the holders were eventually paid off in 1791 at the rate of one cent on the dollar. By 1780, the paper money was &quot;not worth a Continental&quot;, as people said, and a second issue of new currency was attempted. The second issue quickly became nearly worthless—but it was redeemed by the new federal government in 1791 at 100 cents on the dollar. At the same time the states, especially Virginia and the Carolinas, issued over 200 million dollars of their own currency. In effect, the paper money was a hidden tax on the people, and indeed was the only method of taxation that was possible at the time. The skyrocketing inflation was a hardship on the few people who had fixed incomes—but 90 percent of the people were farmers, and were not directly affected by that inflation. Debtors benefited by paying off their debts with depreciated paper.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Volney Harlow, &quot;Aspects of Revolutionary Finance, 1775-1783,&quot; ''American Historical Review'' Vol. 35, No. 1 (Oct., 1929), pp. 46-68 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1838471 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest burden was borne by the soldiers of the Continental Army, whose wages—usually in arrears—declined in value every month, weakening their morale and adding to the hardships suffered by their families.

Beginning in 1777, Congress repeatedly asked the states to provide money. But the states had no system of taxation either, and were little help. By 1780 Congress was making requisitions for specific supplies of corn, beef, pork and other necessities—an inefficient system that kept the army barely alive.&lt;ref&gt;Erna Risch, ''Supplying Washington's Army'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Wayne Carp, ''To Starve the Army at Pleasure: Continental Army Administration and American Political Culture, 1775-1783'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1776, the Congress sought to raise money by loans from wealthy individuals, promising to redeem the bonds after the war. The bonds were in fact redeemed and 1791 at face value, but the scheme raised little money because Americans had little specie, and many of the rich merchants were supporters of the Crown. Starting in 1776, the French secretly supplied the Americans with money, gunpowder, and munitions in order to weaken its arch enemy, Great Britain. When France officially entered the war in 1778, the subsidies continued, and the French government, as well as bankers in Paris and Amsterdam loaned large sums to the American war effort. These loans were repaid in full in the 1790s.&lt;ref&gt;E. James Ferguson, ''The power of the purse: A history of American public finance, 1776-1790'' (1961)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creating new state constitutions==
Following the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775, the Patriots had control of most of Massachusetts; the Loyalists suddenly found themselves on the defensive. In all 13 colonies, Patriots had overthrown their existing governments, closing courts and driving British governors, agents and supporters from their homes. They had elected conventions and &quot;legislatures&quot; that existed outside of any legal framework; new constitutions were used in each state to supersede royal charters. They declared they were states now, not colonies.&lt;ref name = &quot;Pole-ch29&quot;&gt;Nevins (1927); Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 29&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 5, 1776, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] ratified the first state constitution, six months before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Then, in May 1776, Congress voted to suppress all forms of crown authority, to be replaced by locally created authority. Virginia, [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and New Jersey created their constitutions before July 4. [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] and [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] simply took their existing [[royal charter]]s and deleted all references to the crown.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;

The new states had to decide not only what form of government to create, they first had to decide how to select those who would craft the constitutions and how the resulting document would be ratified. In states where the wealthy exerted firm control over the process, such as [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], Virginia, [[Delaware Colony|Delaware]], New York and Massachusetts, the results were constitutions that featured:
* Substantial property qualifications for voting and even more substantial requirements for elected positions (though New York and Maryland lowered property qualifications);&lt;ref name = &quot;Pole-ch29&quot;/&gt;
* [[Bicameral legislature]]s, with the upper house as a check on the lower;
* Strong [[governor]]s, with veto power over the legislature and substantial appointment authority;
* Few or no restraints on individuals holding multiple positions in government;
* The continuation of [[Established church|state-established religion]].
 [[File:Benjamin Rush Painting by Peale 1783.jpg|thumb|alt=Benjamin Rush, 1783|[[Benjamin Rush]], 1783]]
In states where the less affluent had organized sufficiently to have significant power—especially Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New Hampshire—the resulting constitutions embodied
* universal white manhood suffrage, or minimal property requirements for voting or holding office (New Jersey enfranchised some property owning widows, a step that it retracted 25 years later);
* strong, [[Unicameralism|unicameral legislatures]];
* relatively weak governors, without veto powers, and little appointing authority;
* prohibition against individuals holding multiple government posts;

Whether conservatives or radicals held sway in a state did not mean that the side with less power accepted the result quietly. The radical provisions of Pennsylvania's constitution lasted only 14 years. In 1790, conservatives gained power in the state legislature, called a new constitutional convention, and rewrote the constitution. The new constitution substantially reduced universal white-male suffrage, gave the governor veto power and patronage appointment authority, and added an upper house with substantial wealth qualifications to the unicameral legislature. Thomas Paine called it a constitution unworthy of America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood, 1992&quot;/&gt;

==Independence and Union==

{{See|Lee Resolution|Articles of Confederation|Committee of Five|United States Declaration of Independence}}

In April the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress]] issued the [[Halifax Resolves]], explicitly authorized its delegates to vote for independence.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''The Founding of a Nation'' (1968) pp. 678-9&lt;/ref&gt;  In May Congress called on all the states to write constitutions, and eliminate the last remnants of royal rule. 

By June nine colonies were ready for independence; one by one the last four —Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and New York — fell into line. [[Richard Henry Lee]] was instructed by the Virginia legislature to propose independence, and he did so on June 7, 1776. On the 11th a committee was created to draft a document explaining the justifications for separation from Britain. After securing enough votes for passage, independence was voted for on July 2. The [[Declaration of Independence]], drafted largely by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and presented by the committee, was slightly revised and unanimously adopted by the entire Congress on July 4, marking the formation of a new nation, which called itself the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'' (1997) pp. 41-46&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second Continental Congress approved a new constitution, the &quot;Articles of Confederation,&quot; for ratification by the states on November 15, 1777, and immediately began operating under their terms. The Articles were formally ratified on March 1, 1781. At that point, the Continental Congress was dissolved and on the following day a new government of the [[Congress of the Confederation|United States in Congress Assembled]] took its place, with [[Samuel Huntington (statesman)|Samuel Huntington]] as presiding officer.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klos, ''President Who? Forgotten Founders'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

===British return: 1776–1777===
{{See|New York and New Jersey campaign|Staten Island Peace Conference|Saratoga campaign|Philadelphia campaign}}

After Washington forced the British out of Boston in spring 1776, neither the British nor the Loyalists controlled any significant areas. The British, however, were massing forces at their naval base at [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. They returned in force in July 1776, landing in New York and defeating Washington's Continental Army at the [[Battle of Brooklyn]] in August, one of the largest engagements of the war. After the Battle of Brooklyn, the British requested a meeting with representatives from Congress to negotiate an end to hostilities. A delegation including John Adams and Benjamin Franklin met Howe on [[Staten Island]] in New York Harbor on September 11, in what became known as the [[Staten Island Peace Conference]]. Howe demanded a retraction of the Declaration of Independence, which was refused, and negotiations ended until 1781. The British then [[Battle of Kip's Bay|quickly seized New York City]] and nearly captured General Washington. They made the city their main political and military base of operations in North America, [[Evacuation Day (New York)|holding it until November 1783]]. New York City consequently became the destination for Loyalist refugees, and a focal point of Washington's [[Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War|intelligence network]].&lt;ref&gt;Schecter, Barnet. ''The Battle for New York: The City at the Heart of the American Revolution''. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, ''1776'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The British also took New Jersey, pushing the Continental Army into Pennsylvania, but in a surprise attack in late December 1776 Washington [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware|crossed the Delaware River]] back into New Jersey and defeated Hessian and British armies at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]], thereby regaining New Jersey. The victories gave an important boost to pro-independence supporters at a time when morale was flagging, and have become iconic events of the war.[[File:Washington Praying 1928 Issue-2c.jpg|thumb|185px|Washington at Valley Forge, issue of 1928]]

In 1777, as part of a grand strategy to end the war, the British sent an invasion force from Canada to seal off New England, which the British perceived as the primary source of agitators. In a major case of mis-coordination, the British army in New York City went to Philadelphia which it captured from Washington. The invasion army under [[John Burgoyne|Burgoyne]] waited in vain for reinforcements from New York, and became trapped in northern New York state. It surrendered after the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in October 1777. From early October 1777 until November 15 a pivotal [[siege]] at [[Fort Mifflin]], Philadelphia, Pennsylvania distracted British troops and allowed Washington time to preserve the Continental Army by safely leading his troops to harsh winter quarters at [[Valley Forge]].

===American alliances after 1778===
{{See|France in the American Revolutionary War|Spain in the American Revolutionary War}}

The capture of a British army at Saratoga encouraged the French to formally enter the war in support of Congress, as Benjamin Franklin negotiated a permanent military alliance in early 1778, significantly becoming the first country to officially recognize the Declaration of Independence. On February 6, 1778, a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (USA–France)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] and a [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]] were signed between the United States and France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton, 1974 p. 28&quot;&gt;Hamilton, ''The Papers of Alexander Hamilton'' (1974) p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] spoke out in parliament urging Britain to make peace in America, and unite with America against France, while other British politicians who had previously sympathised with colonial grievances now turned against the American rebels for allying with British international rival and enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Weintraub, ''Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775-1783'' (2005) p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Spain (in 1779) and the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] (1780) became allies of the French, leaving the British Empire to fight a global war alone without major allies, and requiring it to slip through a combined blockade of the Atlantic. The American theater thus became only one front in Britain's war.&lt;ref&gt;Mackesy, ''The War for America'' (1993) p. 568&lt;/ref&gt; The British were forced to withdraw troops from continental America to reinforce the valuable sugar-producing Caribbean colonies, which were considered more important.

Because of the alliance with France and the deteriorating military situation, [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]], the British commander, evacuated Philadelphia to reinforce New York City. General Washington attempted to intercept the retreating column, resulting in the [[Battle of Monmouth|Battle of Monmouth Court House]], the last major battle fought in the north. After an inconclusive engagement, the British successfully retreated to New York City. The northern war subsequently became a stalemate, as the focus of attention shifted to the smaller southern theater.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higginbotham, 1983 p. 83&quot;&gt;Higginbotham, ''The War of American Independence'' (1983) p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

===The British move South, 1778–1783===
{{See|Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Naval operations in the American Revolutionary War}}

The British strategy in America now concentrated on a campaign in the southern colonies. With fewer regular troops at their disposal, the British commanders saw the &quot;southern strategy&quot; as a more viable plan, as the south was perceived as being more strongly Loyalist, with a large population of recent immigrants as well as large numbers of slaves who might be captured or run away to join the British.&lt;ref&gt;Crow and Tise, ''The Southern Experience in the American Revolution'' (1978) p. 157-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in late December 1778, the British captured [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and controlled the [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] coastline. In 1780 they launched a fresh invasion and [[Siege of Charleston|took Charleston]] as well. A significant victory at the [[Battle of Camden]] meant that royal forces soon controlled most of Georgia and South Carolina. The British set up a network of forts inland, hoping the Loyalists would rally to the flag. Not enough Loyalists turned out, however, and the British had to fight their way north into North Carolina and Virginia, with a severely weakened army. Behind them much of the territory they had already captured dissolved into a chaotic [[guerrilla war]], fought predominantly between bands of Loyalist and American militia, which negated many of the gains the British had previously made.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Lumpkin, ''From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yorktown 1781====

{{Main|Siege of Yorktown}}

The southern British army marched to [[Yorktown, Virginia]] where they expected to be rescued by a British fleet which would take them back to New York.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey p.493-95&lt;/ref&gt; When that fleet was defeated by a French fleet at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], the southern British army became trapped at Yorktown.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey p.502-06&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1781 under a combined siege by the French and Continental armies under Washington, the British, under the command of General Cornwallis, surrendered their second army of the war. Cornwallis refused to attend the surrender ceremonies and sent a subordinate.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey p.515&lt;/ref&gt;

===The war winds down===
Support for the conflict had never been strong in Britain, where many sympathized with the rebels, but now it reached a new low.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey p.528&lt;/ref&gt; Although King George III personally wanted to fight on, his supporters lost control of Parliament, and no further major land offensives were launched in the American Theater.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higginbotham, 1983 p. 83&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A final naval battle was fought on March 10, 1783 by Captain [[John Barry (naval officer)|John Barry]] and the crew of the [[USS Alliance (1778)|USS ''Alliance'']], who defeated three British warships led by HMS ''Sybille''. Martin I. J. Griffin, ''The Story of Commodore John Barry'' (2010) pp 218-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington could not know that after Yorktown the British would not reopen hostilities. They still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston and Savannah, together with a powerful fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782-83.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan R. Dull, ''The French Navy and American Independence'' (1975) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; The treasury was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive, almost to the point of mutiny or possible ''coup d'état''. The unrest among officers of the [[Newburgh Conspiracy]] was personally dispelled by Washington in 1783, and Congress subsequently created the promise of a five years bonus for all officers.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Kohn, ''Eagle and Sword: The Federalists and the Creation of the Military Establishment in America, 1783-1802'' (1975) pp 17-39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peace treaty==
{{Main|Treaty of Paris (1783)}}

The peace treaty with Britain, known as the Treaty of Paris, gave the U.S. all land east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes, though not including Florida (On September 3, 1783, Britain entered into a separate agreement with Spain under which Britain ceded Florida back to Spain.) The British abandoned the Indian allies living in this region; they were not a party to this treaty and did not recognize it until they were defeated militarily by the United States. Issues regarding boundaries and debts were not resolved until the [[Jay Treaty]] of 1795.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1948), pp. 616–48&lt;/ref&gt; Since the blockade was lifted and the old imperial restrictions were gone, American merchants were free to trade with any nation anywhere in the world, and their business flourished.

===Impact on Britain===
Losing the war and the 13 colonies was a shock to the British system. The war revealed the limitations of Britain's fiscal-military state when it discovered it suddenly faced powerful enemies, with no allies, and dependent on extended and vulnerable transatlantic lines of communication. The defeat heightened dissension and escalated political antagonism to the King's ministers. Inside parliament, the primary concern changed from fears of an over-mighty monarch to the issues of representation, parliamentary reform, and government retrenchment. Reformers sought to destroy what they saw as widespread institutional corruption. The result was a powerful crisis, 1776-1783. The peace in 1783 left France financially prostrate, while the British economy boomed thanks to the return of American business. The crisis ended after 1784 thanks to the King's shrewdness in outwitting [[Charles James Fox]] (the leader of the [[Fox-North Coalition]]), and renewed confidence in the system engendered by the leadership of the new Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]]. Historians conclude that loss of the American colonies enabled Britain to deal with the [[French Revolution]] with more unity and better organization than would otherwise have been the case.&lt;ref&gt;William Hague, ''William Pitt the Younger'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, ''George III: America’s Last King''(2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concluding the Revolution==
{{main|Philadelphia Convention|United States Bill of Rights}}
{{see also|Annapolis Convention|Federalist Papers}}

===Creating a &quot;more perfect union&quot; and guaranteeing rights===
After the war finally ended in 1783, there was a period of prosperity, with the entire world at peace. The national government, still operating under the Articles of Confederation, was able to settle the issue of the western territories, which were ceded by the states to Congress. American settlers moved rapidly into those areas, with Vermont, Kentucky and Tennessee becaming states in the 1790s.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole, eds. ''Companion to the American Revolution,'' pp. 557-624&lt;/ref&gt; However, the national government had no money to pay either the war debts owed to European nations, the private banks, or to Americans who had been given millions of dollars of promissory notes for supplies during the war. Nationalists, led by Washington, Alexander Hamilton and other veterans, feared that the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war, or even internal revolts such as the [[Shays' Rebellion]] of 1786 in Massachusetts. 

Calling themselves &quot;Federalists,&quot; the nationalists convinced Congress to call the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;Richard B. Morris, ''The Forging of the Union: 1781-1789'' (1987) pp 245-266&lt;/ref&gt; It adopted a new [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] that provided for a much stronger federal government, including an effective executive in a [[Separation of powers|check-and-balance]] system with the judiciary and legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, ''The Forging of the Union: 1781-1789'' pp 300-13&lt;/ref&gt; After a fierce debate in the states over the nature of the proposed new government, the Constitution was ratified in 1788. The new government under President George Washington took office in New York in March 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, ''The Forging of the Union, 1781-1789'' pp 300-22&lt;/ref&gt; As assurances to those who were cautious about federal power, amendments to the Constitution guaranteeing many of the [[inalienable rights]] that formed a foundation for the revolution were spearheaded in Congress by [[James Madison]], and later ratified by the states in 1791.

===National debt===
{{See|United States public debt|Alexander Hamilton}}

The national debt after the American Revolution fell into three categories. The first was the $12 million owed to foreigners—mostly money borrowed from France. There was general agreement to pay the foreign debts at full value. The national government owed $40 million and state governments owed $25 million to Americans who had sold food, horses, and supplies to the revolutionary forces. There were also other debts that consisted of [[promissory note]]s issued during the Revolutionary War to soldiers, merchants, and farmers who accepted these payments on the premise that the new Constitution would create a government that would pay these debts eventually.

The war expenses of the individual states added up to $114 million compared to $37 million by the central government.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''The New Nation'' (1950) p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790, at the recommendation of first Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, Congress combined the remaining state debts with the foreign and domestic debts into one national debt totaling $80 million. Everyone received face value for wartime certificates, so that the national honor would be sustained and the national credit established.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph J. Ellis, ''His Excellency: George Washington'' (2004) p 204&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impressions the Revolution made==
===Loyalist expatriation===
About 60,000 to 70,000 Loyalists left the newly founded republic; some left for Britain and the remainder, called [[United Empire Loyalists]] received British subsidies to resettle in British colonies in North America, especially [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Quebec]] (concentrating in the [[Eastern Townships]]), [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Stewart Wallace, '';The United Empire Loyalists: A Chronicle of the Great Migration'' (Toronto, 1914) [http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/1/1/9/7/11977/11977.htm online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; The new colonies of Upper Canada (now [[Ontario]]) and [[New Brunswick]] were created by Britain for their benefit. However, about 80% of the Loyalists stayed and became loyal citizens of the United States, and some of the exiles later returned to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Van Tine, ''American Loyalists'' (1902) p 307&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretations===
Interpretations about the effect of the Revolution vary. Though contemporary participants referred to the events as &quot;the revolution&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;David McCullough, ''John Adams'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; at one end of the spectrum is the view that the American Revolution was not &quot;revolutionary&quot; at all, contending that it did not radically transform colonial society but simply replaced a distant government with a local one.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, ''The American Revolution'' (2000) pp. 93-102&lt;/ref&gt; More recent scholarship pioneered by historians such as [[Bernard Bailyn]], [[Gordon S. Wood|Gordon Wood]], and [[Edmund Morgan]] accepts the contemporary view of the participants that the American Revolution was a unique and radical event that produced deep changes and had a profound impact on world affairs, based on an increasing belief in the principles of the Enlightenment as reflected in how liberalism was understood during the period, and republicanism. These were demonstrated by a leadership and government that espoused protection of natural rights, and a system of laws chosen by the people.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''The American Revolution: A History'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===As an example or inspiration===
{{See|Atlantic Revolutions}}

After the Revolution, genuinely democratic politics became possible.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992) pp. 278-9&lt;/ref&gt; The rights of the people were incorporated into state constitutions. Thus came the widespread assertion of liberty, individual rights, equality and hostility toward corruption which would prove core values of liberal republicanism to Americans. The greatest challenge to the old order in Europe was the challenge to inherited political power and the democratic idea that government rests on the [[consent of the governed]]. The example of the first successful revolution against a European empire, and the first successful establishment of a republican form of [[democracy|democratically]] elected government, provided a model for many other colonial peoples who realized that they too could break away and become self-governing nations with [[Direct election|directly elected]] representative government.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch Republic, also at war with Britain at that time, was the next country after France to sign a treaty with the United States, on October 8, 1782.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton, 1974 p. 28&quot;/&gt; On April 3, 1783, Ambassador Extraordinary [[Gustaf Philip Creutz]], representing King [[Gustav III of Sweden]], and Benjamin Franklin, [[United States Ambassador to France|Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America]], signed a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (USA–Sweden)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] with the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton, 1974 p. 28&quot;/&gt;

The American Revolution was the first wave of the [[Atlantic Revolutions]] that took hold in the French Revolution, the [[Haitian Revolution]], and the [[Latin American wars of independence]]. Aftershocks reached Ireland in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, (1959); Greene and Pole (1994) ch 53–55&lt;/ref&gt;

The Revolution had a strong, immediate impact in Great Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, and France. Many British and Irish [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] spoke in favor of the American cause. The Revolution, along with the [[Dutch Revolt]] (end of the 16th century) and the [[English Civil War]] (in the 17th century), was one of the first lessons in overthrowing an old regime for many Europeans who later were active during the era of the French Revolution, such as [[Marquis de Lafayette]]. The American Declaration of Independence had some impact on the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]] of 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, (1959); Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 49–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Center for History and New Media, ''Liberty, equality, fraternity'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
The spirit of the Declaration of Independence led to laws ending slavery in all the Northern states and the Northwest Territory, with New Jersey the last in 1804—long before the British Parliament acted in 1833 to abolish slavery in its colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole p. 409, 453-54&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen, 2001,&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayckbourn wrote his first play at Wisborough Lodge (a preparatory school in the village of [[Wisborough Green]]) when he was about 10.&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; While at prep school as a boarder his mother wrote to tell him she was marrying Cecil Pye, a bank manager, and when he was at home for the holidays his new family consisted of his mother, his stepfather and Christopher, his stepfather's son by an earlier marriage. This relationship too, reportedly ran into difficulties early on.&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 17&amp;ndash;19&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Paul Allen has compared characters and themes in Ayckbourn's mature plays with his childhood experience of several unconventional relationships and an unhappy marriage.&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=January 2009}}

Ayckbourn attended [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Haileybury]], in the village of [[Hertford Heath]], and while there toured Europe and America with the school's Shakespeare company.&lt;ref name=webbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 30&amp;ndash;33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adult life===

After leaving school at 17, Ayckbourn's career took several temporary jobs in various places before starting a temporary job at the [[Stephen Joseph Theatre|Scarborough Library Theatre]], where he was introduced to the artistic director, [[Stephen Joseph]].&lt;ref name=webbio/&gt;&lt;ref name=p41&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 43&amp;ndash;46&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that Joseph became both a mentor and father figure for Ayckbourn until his untimely death in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 118&amp;ndash;119&lt;/ref&gt; and he has consistently spoken highly of him.&lt;ref&gt;Ayckbourn, Alan (2003). ''The Crafty Art of Playmaking'', Faber, ISBN 0-571-21509-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayckbourn's career was briefly interrupted when he was called for [[National Service]]. He was swiftly discharged, officially on medical grounds, but it is suggested that a doctor who noticed his reluctance to join the Armed Forces deliberately failed the medical as a favour.&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 72&amp;ndash;75&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ayckbourn continued to move where his career took him, he settled in Scarborough, eventually buying Longwestgate House, the house formerly owned by [[Stephen Joseph]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 145&amp;ndash;146&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Ayckbourn married Christine Roland, another member of the Library Theatre company,&lt;ref name=20facts&gt;[http://biography.alanayckbourn.net/BiographyFacts.htm 20 Facts about Alan Ayckbourn] accessed 05 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 297&amp;ndash;299&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 65&amp;ndash;67&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed Ayckbourn's first two plays were written jointly with her under the pseudonym of &quot;Roland Allen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 67&amp;ndash;72&lt;/ref&gt; They had two sons, Steven and [[Philip Ayckbourn|Philip]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 69, 85&lt;/ref&gt; However, the marriage had difficulties which eventually led to their separation in 1971. Alan Ayckbourn said that his relationship with Christine became easy once they agreed their marriage was over. Around this time, he started to share a home with Heather Stoney,&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; an actress he had first met ten years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Like his mother, neither he nor Christine sought a divorce for the next thirty years and it was only in 1997 that they formally divorced; Ayckbourn married Heather Stoney.&lt;ref name=20facts/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 297&amp;ndash;298&lt;/ref&gt; One side-effect of the timing is that, as Alan was awarded a knighthood a few months before the divorce,&lt;ref name=knighted&gt;P. Allen, 2001, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; both his first and second wife are entitled to take the title of Lady Ayckbourn.

In February 2006, he suffered a [[stroke]] in Scarborough, and stated: &quot;I hope to be back on my feet, or should I say my left leg, as soon as possible, but I know it is going to take some time. In the meantime I am in excellent hands and so is the Stephen Joseph Theatre.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scarborougheveningnews.co.uk/news/Ayckbourn-has-stroke.1368917.jp ''Scarborough Evening News'', 28 February 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; He left hospital after eight weeks and returned to directing after six months,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2006/oct/04/theatre.health ''The Guardian'', 4 October 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; but the following year he announced he would step down as Artistic Director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News, 4 June 2007&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/6720029.stm BBC News, 4 June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Ayckbourn, however, continues to write and direct his own work at the theatre.

===Influence on plays===

Since Alan Ayckbourn's plays started becoming established in the West End, interviewers have raised the question of whether his work is autobiographical.&lt;ref name=auto&gt;P. Allen, 2001, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; There is no clear answer to this question. There has only been one biography, written by Paul Allen, and this primarily covers his career in the theatre.&lt;ref name=biography/&gt; Ayckbourn has frequently said he sees aspects of himself in all his characters. For example, in ''[[Bedroom Farce (play)|Bedroom Farce]]'' (1975), he admitted to being, in some respects, all four of the men in the play.&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that, after Ayckbourn himself, the person who is used the most in his plays is his mother, particularly as Susan in ''[[Woman in Mind]]''&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; (1985).

What is less clear is how much influence events in Ayckbourn's life have had on his writing. It is true that the theme of marriages in various difficulties was heavily present throughout his plays in the early seventies, around the time his own marriage was coming to an end. However, by this time, he had also witnessed the failures of his parents' relationships as well as those of some of his friends.&lt;ref name=auto/&gt; Which relationships, if any, he drew on for his plays, is unclear. In Paul Allen’s biography, Ayckbourn is briefly compared to Dafydd and Guy in ''[[A Chorus of Disapproval (play)|A Chorus of Disapproval]]'' (1984). Both characters feel themselves in trouble, and there was speculation that Alan Ayckbourn himself may have felt himself to be in trouble. At the time, he had reportedly become seriously involved with another actress, which threatened his relationship with Heather Stoney.&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 209&amp;ndash;210&lt;/ref&gt; But again, it is unclear whether this had any effect on the writing, and Paul Allen's view is that it is not current experience that Ayckbourn uses for his plays.

It could be that Ayckbourn had written plays with himself and his own issues in mind, but as Ayckbourn is portrayed as a guarded and private man,&lt;ref name=biography/&gt; it is hard to imagine him exposing his own life in his plays to any great degree. In the biography, Paul Allen wrote, regarding a suggestion in ''Cosmopolitan'' that his plays were becoming autobiographical: &quot;If we take that to mean that his plays tell his own life story, he still hasn't started.&quot;&lt;ref name=auto/&gt;

==Career==
===Early career and acting===

On leaving school his theatrical career started immediately, with an introduction to Sir [[Donald Wolfit]] by his French master.&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Ayckbourn joined Wolfit on tour to the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] as an acting assistant stage manager (meaning a role that involved both acting and stage management) for three weeks,&lt;ref name=webbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 36&amp;ndash;38&lt;/ref&gt; with his first role on the professional stage being various parts in ''The Strong are Lonely'' by [[Fritz Hochwälder]].&lt;ref name=acting&gt;[http://biography.alanayckbourn.net/BiographyActing.htm Acting career on official Ayckbourn site]&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, Ayckbourn appeared in six other plays at the Connaught Theatre, [[Worthing]],&lt;ref name=webbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 38&amp;ndash;40&lt;/ref&gt; and the Thorndyke theatre, [[Leatherhead]].&lt;ref name=webbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 41&amp;ndash;43&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Ayckbourn was employed by the director [[Stephen Joseph]] at the Library Theatre, [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], the predecessor to the modern [[Stephen Joseph Theatre]].&lt;ref name=webbio/&gt;&lt;ref name=p41/&gt; His role, again, was initially an acting stage manager.&lt;ref name=webbio/&gt;&lt;ref name=p41/&gt; This employment led to Ayckbourn's first professional script commission, in 1958. When he complained about the quality of a script he was performing, Joseph challenged him to write a better one. The result was ''The Square Cat'', written under the pseudonym Roland Allen and first performed in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; In this play, Ayckbourn himself played the character Jerry Watiss.&lt;ref name=acting/&gt;

After thirty-four appearances in plays at the Library Theatre, including four of his own, in 1962 Ayckbourn moved to [[Stoke-on-Trent]] to help set up the Victoria Theatre, (now the [[New Vic Theatre|New Vic]]),&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 87&amp;ndash;88&lt;/ref&gt; where he appeared in a further eighteen plays.&lt;ref name=acting/&gt; His final appearance in one of his own plays was as the Crimson Gollywog in the disastrous children's play ''Christmas v Mastermind''.&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; He left the Stoke company in 1964, officially to commit his time to the London production of ''Mr. Whatnot'', but reportedly because was having trouble working with the artistic director, [[Peter Cheeseman]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 98&amp;ndash;99&lt;/ref&gt; By now, his career as a writer was coming to fruition, and his acting career was sidelined.

His final role on stage was as Jerry in ''[[Two for the Seesaw]]'' by [[William Gibson (playwright)|William Gibson]], at the [[Rotherham Civic Theatre and Arts Centre|Civic Theatre]] in [[Rotherham]].&lt;ref name=acting/&gt; He was left stranded on stage because Heather Stoney was unable to re-appear because the props had been left unpacked, and this led him to decide acting was more trouble than it was worth.&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 99&amp;ndash;100&lt;/ref&gt; The assistant stage manager on the production, [[Bill Kenwright]], would become one of the UK's most successful producers.

===Writing===

Alan Ayckbourn's earliest plays were written and produced at a time when the Scarborough Library theatre, like most regional theatres, regularly commissioned work from their own actors to keep costs down{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} (the other notable actor whose work was being commissioned being [[David Campton]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samuelfrench-london.co.uk/sf/Pages/feature/campton.html David Campton Feature] on Samuel French website&lt;/ref&gt; His first play, ''The Square Cat'', was sufficiently popular locally to secure further commissions, but neither this nor the following three plays had any major impact outside of Scarborough.&lt;ref&gt;History of early plays on official Ayckbourn site [http://thesquarecat.alanayckbourn.net/SquareCatHistory.htm] [http://loveafterall.alanayckbourn.net/LoveAfterAllHistory.htm] [http://dadstale.alanayckbourn.net/DadsTaleHistory.htm] [http://standingroomonly.alanayckbourn.net/StandingRoomOnlyHistory.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; But, after his transfer to [[New Vic Theatre|Victoria Theatre]] in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], there came ''Christmas v Mastermind'', which flopped and is now universally regarded as Ayckbourn's greatest disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://christmasvmastermind.alanayckbourn.net/ChristmasVMastermindHistory.htm ''Christmas v Mastermind'' history] on official Ayckbourn site.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 89&amp;ndash;90&lt;/ref&gt;

His fortunes began to revive in 1963 with ''Mr. Whatnot'', again premièring at the Victoria Theatre. This was the first play that Ayckbourn was sufficiently happy with to allow performances today, and the first play to receive a [[West End theatre|West End]] performance. However, the West End production flopped, in part down to misguided casting.&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 96, 101&amp;ndash;102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mrwhatnot.alanayckbourn.net/MrWhatnotHistory.htm ''Mr. Whatnot'' history] on official Ayckbourn site.&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Ayckbourn experimented by collaborating with comedians, first writing a monologue for [[Tommy Cooper]], and later with [[Ronnie Barker]], who played Lord Slingsby-Craddock in the London production of ''Mr Whatnot'' in 1964, for the scripts of for [[London Weekend Television|LWT]]'s ''[[Hark at Barker]]''. Ayckbourn used the pseudonym 'Peter Caulfield' because he was under exclusive contract to the [[BBC]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, in 1965, back at the Scarborough Library Theatre, ''Meet my Father'' was produced, later retitled ''[[Relatively Speaking (play)|Relatively Speaking]]''. This time, the play was a massive success, both in Scarborough and the West End, making Alan Ayckbourn rich and earning him a congratulatory telegram from [[Noel Coward]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 109&amp;ndash;113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://relativelyspeaking.alanayckbourn.net/RelativelySpeakingHistory.htm ''Relatively Speaking'' history] on official Ayckbourn site&lt;/ref&gt; This was not quite the end of Ayckbourn's hit-and-miss record, because his following play, ''[[The Sparrow (play)|The Sparrow]]'' only ran for three weeks at Scarborough.&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesparrow.alanayckbourn.net/TheSparrowHistory.htm ''The Sparrow'' history] on official Ayckbourn site&lt;/ref&gt; However, the following play, ''How the Other Half Loves'', secured his runaway success as a playwright.&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 122&amp;ndash;123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://howtheotherhalfloves.alanayckbourn.net/HowTheOtherHalfLovesHistory.htm ''How the Other Half Loves'' history] on official Ayckbourn site&lt;/ref&gt;

The height of Ayckbourn's commercial success included ''[[Absurd Person Singular]]'' (1975), ''[[The Norman Conquests]]'' trilogy (1973), ''[[Bedroom Farce (play)|Bedroom Farce]]'' (1975) and ''Just Between Ourselves'' (1976), all plays that focused heavily on marriage in the British middle classes. The only failure during this period was 1975 musical with [[Andrew Lloyd Webber|Andrew Lloyd-Webber]], ''[[Jeeves (musical)|Jeeves]]'', and even this did little to dent Ayckbourn's popularity.&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 146&amp;ndash;148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeeves.alanayckbourn.net/JeevesHistory.htm ''Jeeves'' history] on official Ayckbourn site&lt;/ref&gt; Although his plays have received major West End productions almost from the beginning of his writing career, and hence have been reviewed in [[United Kingdom newspapers|British newspapers]], Ayckbourn's work was for years routinely dismissed as being too slight for serious study.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Recently, scholars have begun to view Ayckbourn as an important commentator on the lifestyles of the British [[suburb]]an [[middle class]], and as a stylistic innovator who experiments with theatrical styles within the boundaries set by popular tastes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

From the 1980s, Ayckbourn began to move away from the recurring themes of marriage and explore other contemporary themes, one example being ''[[Woman in Mind]]'', a play performed entirely from the perspective of a Woman going through a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 213&amp;ndash;217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://womaninmind.alanayckbourn.net/WomanInMindHistory.htm ''Woman in Mind'' history] on official Ayckbourn site&lt;/ref&gt; He also experimented with several more unconventional ways of writing plays, such as ''Intimate Exchanges'', which has one beginning and sixteen possible endings, and ''[[House &amp; Garden (plays)|House &amp; Garden]]'', where two plays take place simultaneously of two different stages, as well as diversifying into children's theatre (such as ''[[Mr A's Amazing Maze Plays]]'' and musical plays, such as ''[[By Jeeves]]'' (a more successful rewrite of the original ''Jeeves'').

With a résumé of over seventy plays, of which more than forty have played at the National Theatre or in the West End, Alan Ayckbourn is one of England’s most successful living playwrights. Despite his success, honours and awards (which include a prestigious [[Laurence Olivier Award]]), Alan Ayckbourn remains a relatively anonymous figure dedicated to regional theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gibson | first = Melissa | title = Alan Ayckbourn: Grinning at the Edge | journal = Theatre Journal | year = 2002 | url = http://links.jstor.org | accessdate = 2007-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his writing career, all but four of his plays were premièred at the [[Stephen Joseph Theatre]] in Scarborough in its three different locations.&lt;ref name=webbio/&gt;

Alan Ayckbourn received the CBE in 1987&lt;ref name=webbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Allen, 2001, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; and was knighted in 1997.&lt;ref name=webbio/&gt;&lt;ref name=knighted/&gt; It is frequently claimed&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/alan-ayckbourn-you-ask-the-questions-586304.html] [http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/jul/06/1] [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/4550763/Alan-Ayckbourn-Why-my-shows-must-go-on.html]&lt;/ref&gt; (but not proven)&lt;ref&gt;[http://biography.alanayckbourn.net/BiographyFAQPopularity.htm FAQ popularity on Ayckbourn site]&lt;/ref&gt; that Alan Ayckbourn is the most performed living English playwright, and the second most performed of all time after [[Shakespeare]].

Although Alan Ayckbourn's plays no longer dominate the theatrical scene on the scale of his earlier works, he continues to write, his most recent major success being ''[[Private Fears in Public Places]]'' that had a hugely successful [[Off-Broadway]] run, and in 2006 was made into a film ''[[Cœurs]]'', directed by [[Alain Resnais]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://privatefears.alanayckbourn.net/PrivateFearsInPublicPlacesHistory.htm ''Private Fears in Public Places'' history] on official Ayckbourn site&lt;/ref&gt; After suffering a stroke, there was uncertainly as to whether he could continue to write&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/inthepaper/2007/03/its-easier-to-return-to-directing-than-writing-say/ ''The Stage'', 22 March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; (the Ayckbourn play premièred immediately after the stroke, ''[[If I Were You (play)|If I Were You]]'', was written before his illness), but his first play written afterwards, ''[[Life and Beth]]'', was premièred in the summer of 2008. Ayckbourn continues to write for the Stephen Joseph Theatre on invitation of his successor as Artistic Director, Chris Monks, with the first new play under this arrangement, ''[[My Wonderful Day]]'', performed in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanayckbourn.net/NewsCalender.htm News calendar] on official Ayckbourn site.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directing / Artistic Director===

Although Alan Ayckbourn is best known as a writer, it is said that he only spends 10% of his time writing plays. Most of the rest of his time is spent directing.&lt;ref name=10pc&gt;P. Allen, 2001, pp. 84&amp;ndash;85&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Ayckbourn began directing at the [[Stephen Joseph Theatre|Scarborough Library Theatre]] in 1961, with a production of ''[[Gas Light]]'' by [[Patrick Hamilton (dramatist)|Patrick Hamilton]].&lt;ref name=10pc/&gt;&lt;ref name=direct-early&gt;[http://directing.alanayckbourn.net/Plays%20-%20Library.htm List of plays directed by Ayckbourn 1961-1976]&lt;/ref&gt; He directed five other plays this years and the following year in Scarborough, and after transferring to the [[New Vic Theatre|Victoria Theatre]], directed a further six plays in 1963. Between 1964 and 1967 (when much of his time was taken up by various productions of his early successes ''Mr. Whatnot'' and ''[[Relatively Speaking (play)|Relatively Speaking]]'') he only directed one play (''[[The Sparrow (play)|The Sparrow]]'', written by himself, later withdrawn), but in 1968 he resumed regularly directing plays, mostly at Scarborough.&lt;ref name=direct-early/&gt; At this time he also worked as a radio drama producer for the BBC, based in Leeds.

At first, his directing career was separate from his writing career. It was not until 1963 that Ayckbourn directed a play of his own (a revival of ''Standing Room Only''), 1967 that Ayckbourn directed a première of his own (''[[The Sparrow (play)|The Sparrow]]'').&lt;ref name=direct-early/&gt; The London premières remained in the hands of other directors for longer, with the first play of his both written and directed by him in London (''[[Bedroom Farce (play)|Bedroom Farce]]'') waiting until 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://directing.alanayckbourn.net/Plays%20-%20SJTITR.htm List of plays directed by Ayckbourn 1976-1995]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=playguide&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Allen|title=A Pocket Guide to Alan Ayckbourn's Plays|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|year=2004|isbn=0-571-21492-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Stephen Joseph]]'s death in 1967, the position of Director of Productions was appointed on an annual basis. Alan Ayckbourn was offered this position in 1969 and 1970, succeeding Rodney Wood, but he handed the position over to Caroline Smith in 1971 (having spent most of his time that year in the USA with ''How the Other Half Loves''). He became Director of Productions again in 1972, and this time, on 12 November 1972, he was made the permanent Artistic Director of the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biography.alanayckbourn.net/BiographyAD.htm Notes on Ayckbourn site on Artistic Director position]&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1986, Ayckbourn accepted an invitation to work as a visiting director for two years at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in London, form his own company, and perform a play in each of the three auditoria provided at least one was a new play of his own.&lt;ref name=p219&gt;P. Allen, 2001, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Using a stock company that included established performers like [[Michael Gambon]], [[Polly Adams]] and [[Simon Cadell]]. The three plays became four, and were: ''Tons of Money'' by Will Evans and Valentine, with adaptations by Ayckbourn (Lyttelton), [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''A View From the Bridge'' (Cottesloe), his own ''[[A Small Family Business]]'' (Olivier) and [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]]'s ''[['Tis Pity She's a Whore]]'' (Olivier again).&lt;ref&gt;Production details for [http://directing.alanayckbourn.net/Plays%20-%20Tons%20Of%20Money02.htm ''Tons of Money''], [http://aviewfromthebridge.alanayckbourn.net/AViewFromTheBridgeProductions.htm ''A View From the Bridge''], [http://asmallfamilybusiness.alanayckbourn.net/ASmallFamilyBusinessProductions.htm ''A Small Family Business''] and [http://directing.alanayckbourn.net/Plays%20-%20Tis%20Pity.htm ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'Tis a Pity She's a Whore&lt;/nowiki&gt;'']&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Alan Ayckbourn shared his role of Artistic Director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre with Robin Herford&lt;ref name=p219/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAQnat&gt;[http://biography.alanayckbourn.net/BiographyFAQNational.htm FAQ on Ayckbourn site on NAtional Theater]&lt;/ref&gt; and returned in 1987 to direct the première of ''[[Henceforward...]]''.&lt;ref name=playguide/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAQnat/&gt;

He announced in 1999 that he would step back from directing other playwrights' work to concentrate on his own plays,&lt;ref&gt;[http://biography.alanayckbourn.net/BiographyChronology.htm Chronological biography on Ayckbourn site]&lt;/ref&gt; the last one being [[Rob Shearman]]'s ''Knights in Plastic Armour'' in 1999; the exception being in 2002 when he directed the world première of [[Tim Firth]]'s ''The Safari Party''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://directing.alanayckbourn.net/Plays%20-%20SJT.htm List of plays directed by Ayckbourn 1996-present]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, following a dispute over the [[Duchess Theatre]]'s handling of ''[[Damsels in Distress (plays)|Damsels in Distress]]'', Ayckbourn sharply criticised both this and the [[West End theatre|West End]]'s treatment of theatre in general, in particular their casting of celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatsonstage.com/index.php?pg=207&amp;story=E8821035534506 whatsonstage.com, 25 October 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not explicitly say he would boycott the West End, he did not return to direct in the West End again until 2009 with a revival of ''[[Woman in Mind]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/22693/ayckbourns-woman-in-mind-to-transfer-to-west ''The Stage'', 8 December 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; (although he did allow other West End producers to revive ''[[Absurd Person Singular]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/11/25/sv_alanayckbourn.xml&amp;page=3 Interview with Ayckbourn, ''The Daily Telegraph'', 25 November 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Norman Conquests]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7636220.stm BBC News Online, 25 September 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 and 2008 respectively.)

===Full-length plays===
To date, Alan Ayckbourn has written 74 full-length plays.&lt;ref name=playguide/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plays.alanayckbourn.net/ Plays list on official Ayckbourn site]&lt;/ref&gt;

|-style=&quot;background:orange; color:black&quot;
|'''Play number'''&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This numbering is the system used by the official Ayckbourn site as to how many plays have been written. This includes the full-length plays performed but later withdrawn and full-length plays for family audiences, but excludes revues and musical entertainments, adaptations of other plays, plays for children, individual one-act plays, &quot;grey plays&quot; (those written for performance but not publication) and plays for television. It also treats each of the plays in ''[[The Norman Conquests]]'', ''[[House &amp; Garden (plays)|House and Garden]]'' and ''[[Damsels In Distress (plays)|Damsels in Distress]]'' as one play each, the one-acts from ''[[Confusions]]'' as a single full-length play, all variations of ''Intimate Exchanges'' as one play (likewise for ''Sisterly Feelings'' and ''It Could Be Any One Of Us''), both parts of ''[[The Revengers' Comedies]]'' as a single play, and the rewrites of ''Jeeves'' and ''Callisto 5'' as the same play as the original. Other sources may number plays differently.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alpha Centauri''' ([[Bayer designation|α Centauri]], α Cen; also known as '''Rigil Kentaurus''', '''Rigil Kent''', {{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|r|aɪ|dʒ|ə|l}}, or '''Toliman''') is the brightest [[star]] in the southern [[constellation]] of [[Centaurus]].  Although it appears to the unaided eye as a single object, Alpha Centauri is actually a [[binary star]] [[star system|system]] (designated '''Alpha Centauri AB''' or '''α Cen AB''') whose combined [[Apparent magnitude|visual magnitude]] of -0.27 would qualify it as the third single [[List of brightest stars|brightest star]] in the night sky after -0.72 magnitude [[Canopus]].  

Its individual component stars are named Alpha Centauri A (α Cen A), with 110% of the mass and 151.9% the luminosity of our [[Sun]], and Alpha Centauri B (α Cen B), at 90.7% of Sol's mass and 50.0% of its luminosity.  During the stars' 79.91 year orbit about a common center, the distance between them varies from about that between [[Pluto]] and the Sun to that between [[Saturn]] and the Sun.  They average 1.34 [[parsec]]s or 4.37 [[light years]] away from the Sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&quot;&gt;

A third star, known as  [[Proxima Centauri]], Proxima or Alpha Centauri C (α Cen C), is probably gravitationally associated with Alpha Centauri AB. Proxima is now placed at the slightly smaller distance of 1.29 [[parsec]]s or 4.24 [[light years]] from the Sun, making it the closest star to the Sun, even though it is not visible to the naked eye. The true separation of Proxima from Alpha Centauri AB is about 0.06  [[parsec]]s, 0.2 light years or 13,000 [[astronomical unit]]s (AU), equivalent to 400 times the size of [[Neptune]]'s orbit.

==Component designations==
&quot;Alpha Centauri&quot; is the name given to what appears as a single star to the naked eye and the brightest star in the southern constellation of [[Centaurus]]. With the aid of a [[telescope]], Alpha Centauri can be resolved into a [[binary star]] system in close orbit. This is known as the Alpha Centauri AB system, often abbreviated as α Centauri&amp;nbsp;AB or α&amp;nbsp;Cen&amp;nbsp;AB.

Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A (α&amp;nbsp;Cen&amp;nbsp;A) and Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;B (α&amp;nbsp;Cen&amp;nbsp;B) are the individual stars of the binary system, usually defined to identify them as the different component of the binary α&amp;nbsp;Cen&amp;nbsp;AB. As viewed from Earth, there is probably an additional companion located 2.2° away from the AB star system, whose distance is much greater than the observed separation between stars A and&amp;nbsp;B. This companion is [[Proxima Centauri]], Proxima, or α&amp;nbsp;Cen&amp;nbsp;C. If it were bright enough to be seen without a telescope, Proxima Centauri would appear to the naked eye as a star separate from α&amp;nbsp;Cen&amp;nbsp;AB. Alpha Centauri AB and Proxima Centauri form a [[double star|''visual double'']] star, and they are assumed to be gravitationally associated with each other. Direct evidence that Proxima Centauri has an elliptical orbit typical of [[binary star]]s has yet to be determined.&lt;ref name=&quot;wds2006&quot;&gt;

Together, the bright visible components of the [[binary star]] system are called Alpha Centauri AB (α&amp;nbsp;Cen&amp;nbsp;AB).

Some older references use the confusing and now discontinued designation of&amp;nbsp;A×B.

South of about −29° S latitude, Alpha Centauri is [[Circumpolar star|circumpolar]] and never sets below the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;This is calculated for a fixed latitude by knowing the star's [[declination]] (δ) using the formulae (90°+ δ). Alpha Centauri's declination is −60° 50′, so the latitude where the star is circumpolar will be south of −29° 10′S or 29°. Similarly, the place where Alpha Centauri never rises for northern observers is north of the latitude (90°+ δ) N or +29°N.&lt;/ref&gt; Both stars, including Crux, are too far south to be visible for mid-latitude northern observers. Below about +29° N latitude to the equator during the northern summer, Alpha Centauri lies close to the southern horizon.&lt;ref name=&quot;NortonSA&quot; /&gt; The star [[Culmination|culminates]] each year at midnight on 24 April or 9 p.m. on 8 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;NortonSA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Alpha Centauri AB over limb of Saturn PIA10406.jpg|thumb|left|Alpha Centauri A and B resolved over the limb of Saturn, as seen by [[Cassini–Huygens]]]]

Alpha Centauri is the closest star system to our [[Solar System]]. It lies about 4.37 [[light-year]]s in distance, or about 41.5 trillion kilometres, 25.8 trillion miles or 277,600 AU. Astronomer [[Thomas James Henderson]] made the original discovery from many exacting observations of the trigonometric [[parallax]]es of the AB system between April 1832 and May 1833. He withheld the results because he suspected they were too large to be true, but eventually published in 1839 after [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] released his own accurately determined parallax for [[61 Cygni]] in 1838.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated345&quot;&gt;Pannekoek, A., &quot;A Short History of Astronomy&quot;, Dover, 1989, pp. 345–6&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Alpha Centauri is considered as the second star to have its distance measured because it was not formally recognized first.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated345&quot;/&gt;

[[Robert T. A. Innes|R.T.A. Innes]] from South Africa discovered [[Proxima Centauri]] in 1915 by blinking photographic plates taken at different times during a dedicated [[proper motion]] survey. This showed the large proper motion and parallax of the star was similar in both size and direction to those of Alpha Centauri AB, suggesting immediately it was part of the system and slightly closer to us than Alpha Centauri AB. Lying 4.22 light-years away, Proxima Centauri is the [[List of nearest stars|nearest star]] to the Sun. All current derived distances for the three stars are presently from the [[parallax]]es obtained from the [[Hipparcos]] star catalog (HIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The much fainter [[red dwarf]] star named Proxima Centauri, or simply Proxima, is about 12,000 to 13,000 [[astronomical units|A.U.]] away from Alpha Centauri AB.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoubleStarsHeintz&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Matt93&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;adsabs.harvard.edu&quot;/&gt; This is equivalent to 0.21&amp;nbsp;[[light year]]s or 1.94&amp;nbsp;trillion kilometres—about 5% the distance between the Sun and Alpha Centauri AB. Proxima may be gravitationally bound to Alpha Centauri AB, orbiting it with a period between 100,000 and 500,000 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matt93&quot; /&gt; However, it is also possible that Proxima is not gravitationally bound and thus is moving along a [[hyperbolic trajectory]]&lt;ref&gt;

==High proper motion star==
All components of Alpha Centauri display significant proper motions against the background sky, similar to the first magnitude stars [[Sirius]] and [[Arcturus]]. Over the centuries, this causes the apparent stellar positions to slowly change. Such motions define the ''high [[proper motion]] stars''.&lt;ref&gt;

Based on these observed proper motions and radial velocities, Alpha Centauri will continue to slowly brighten, passing just north of the [[Southern Cross]] or [[Crux]], before moving northwest and up towards the [[celestial equator]] and away from the [[galactic plane]]. By about 29,700&amp;nbsp;[[AD]], in the present-day constellation of [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]], Alpha Centauri will be 1.00&amp;nbsp;[[parsec|pc]] or 3.26&amp;nbsp;[[light-year|ly]] away.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthews&quot;/&gt; Then it will reach the stationary radial velocity (RVel) of 0.0&amp;nbsp;km/s and the maximum apparent magnitude of −0.86V — similar to present day [[Canopus]]. Soon after this close approach, the system will begin to move away from us, showing a positive radial velocity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthews&quot;/&gt;

Due to visual [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]], about 100,000&amp;nbsp;years from now, these stars will reach a final [[vanishing point]] and slowly disappear among the countless stars of the Milky Way. Here this once bright yellow star will fall below naked-eye visibility somewhere in the faint present day southern constellation of [[Telescopium]]. This unusual location results from Alpha Centauri's orbit around the galactic centre being highly tilted with respect to the plane of our [[Milky Way]] galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthews&quot;/&gt;

==Possibility of planets==
The discovery of [[exoplanet|planets orbiting other star systems]], including similar binary systems ([[Gamma Cephei]]), raises the possibility that planets may exist in the Alpha Centauri system. Such planets could orbit Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A or Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;B individually, or be on large orbits around the binary Alpha Centauri AB. Since both the principal stars are fairly similar to the Sun (for example, in age and [[metallicity]]), astronomers have been especially interested in making detailed searches for planets in the Alpha Centauri system. Several established planet-hunting teams have used various [[radial velocity]] or star [[Astronomical transit|transit]] methods in their searches around these two bright stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;universetoday.com&quot;&gt;

However, computer simulations show that a planet might have been able to form within a distance of 1.1&amp;nbsp;AU (160&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;km) of Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;B and the orbit of that planet may remain stable for at least 250&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref&gt;

Some astronomers speculated that any possible terrestrial planets in the Alpha Centauri system may be bone dry or lack significant atmospheres. In our solar system both Jupiter and Saturn were probably crucial in perturbing [[comet]]s into the inner solar system. Here the comets provided the inner planets with their own source of water and various other ices&lt;ref name=&quot;Croswell&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be discounted, if for example, Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;B happened to have giant gas planets orbiting Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A (or conversely, Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A for Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;B), or if the stars B and A themselves were able to successfully perturb comets into each other's inner system like Jupiter and Saturn presumably have done here. As comets probably also reside in some huge [[Oort Cloud]] located to the outer regions of stellar systems, when they are influenced gravitationally by either the giant gas planets or disruptions by passing nearby stars, many of these comets then travel sun-wards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthews&quot; /&gt; As yet, there is no direct evidence of the existence of such an Oort Cloud around Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;AB, and theoretically this may have been totally destroyed during the system's formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthews&quot; /&gt;

Any suspected Earth-like planet around Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A would have to be placed about 1.25&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical unit|AU]] away—about halfway between the distances of Earth's orbit and [[Mars]]' orbit in our own [[Solar System]]—so as to have similar planetary temperatures and conditions for liquid water to exist. For the slightly less luminous and cooler Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;B, this distance would be closer to its star at about 0.7&amp;nbsp;AU (100&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;km), being about the distance that [[Venus]] is from the Sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Croswell&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

To find evidence of such planets, currently both Proxima Centauri and Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;AB are among the listed &quot;Tier&amp;nbsp;1&quot; target stars for [[NASA]]'s [[Space Interferometry Mission]] (SIM). Detecting planets as small as three Earth-masses or smaller within two [[Astronomical Units]] of a &quot;Tier&amp;nbsp;1&quot; target is possible with this new instrument.&lt;ref name=&quot;numbers&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features.cfm?feature=1209 Planet Hunting by Numbers]&quot;, ([[Press Release]]), NASA, Stars and Galaxies, ''[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]'', 18 October 2006. Retrieved 24 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==View from this system==
[[File:Sol View from AlpCenA.png|thumb|300px|Looking toward [[Sun|Sol]] from Alpha Centauri in [[Celestia]]]]
Viewed from near the Alpha Centauri system, the sky would appear very much as it does for earthbound observers, except that Centaurus would be missing its brightest star. Our Sun would be a yellow +0.5 visual magnitude star in eastern [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] at the [[antipodal point]] of Alpha Centauri's current [[right ascension|RA]] and [[declination|Dec.]] at 02h&amp;nbsp;39m&amp;nbsp;35s +60°&amp;nbsp;50' (2000). This place is close to the 3.4 magnitude star [[Epsilon Cassiopeiae|ε Cassiopeiae]]. An interstellar or alien observer would find the \/\/ of Cassiopeia had become a /\/\/ shape.&lt;ref&gt;The coordinates of the Sun would be diametrically opposite Alpha Centauri AB, at ''α''={{RA|02|39|36.4951}}, ''δ''={{DEC|+60|50|02.308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Proxima itself, Alpha Centauri AB would appear like two close brilliantly bright stars with the combined magnitude of −6.8. Depending on the binary's orbital position, the bright stars would appear noticeably divisible to the naked eye, or occasionally, but briefly, as single unresolved star. Based on the calculated [[absolute magnitude]]s, the [[visual magnitude]]s of Alpha Centauri A and B would be −6.5 and −5.2, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Computed; using in solar terms: 1.1 ''M''&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt; and 0.92''M''&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;, luminosities 1.57 and 0.51 ''L''*/''L''&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;, Sun magnitude −26.73v), 11.2 to 35.6 AU orbit; The minimum luminosity adds planet's orbital radius to A–B distance (max) (conjunction). Max. luminosity subtracts the planet's orbital radius to A–B distance (min) (opposition).&lt;/ref&gt;

===View from a hypothetical planet===
[[File:Planet-alphacen1.png|thumb|300px|Artist's rendition of the view from a hypothetical airless planet orbiting Alpha Centauri A]]
An observer on a hypothetical planet orbiting around either Alpha Centauri A or Alpha Centauri B would see an intensely bright star in the night sky showing a small but discernible disk.

For example, some theoretical Earth-like planet orbiting about 1.25 AU from Alpha Centauri A (so that the star appears roughly as bright as the Sun viewed from the Earth) would see Alpha Centauri B orbit the entire sky once roughly every one year and three months (or 1.3(4) [[year|a]]), the planet's own [[orbital period]]. Added to this would be the changing apparent position of Alpha Centauri B during its long eighty-year elliptical orbit with respect to Alpha Centauri A (comparable in speed to [[Uranus (planet)|Uranus]] here). Depending on the position on its orbit, Alpha Centauri B would vary in apparent magnitude between −18.2 (dimmest) and −21.0 (brightest). These visual magnitudes are much dimmer than the currently observed −26.7 [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] for the Sun as viewed from the Earth. The difference of 5.7 to 8.6 magnitudes means Alpha Centauri B would appear, on a linear scale, 2500 to 190 times dimmer than Alpha Centauri A (or the Sun viewed from the Earth), but also 190 to 2500 times brighter than the −12.5 magnitude full [[Moon]] as seen from the Earth.

Also, if another similar Earth-like planet orbited at 0.71 AU from Alpha Centauri B (so that in turn Alpha Centauri B appeared as bright as the Sun seen from the Earth), this hypothetical planet would receive slightly more light from the more luminous Alpha Centauri A, which would shine 4.7 to 7.3 magnitudes dimmer than Alpha Centauri B (or the Sun seen from the Earth), ranging in apparent magnitude between −19.4 (dimmest) and −22.1 (brightest). Thus Alpha Centauri A would appear between 830 and 70 times dimmer than the Sun but some 6900 to 580 times brighter than the full Moon. During such planet's orbital period of 0.6(3) [[year|a]], an observer on the planet would see this intensely bright companion star circle the sky just as we see with the [[Solar System|Solar System's]] planets. Furthermore, Alpha Centauri A [[orbital period|sidereal period]] of approximately eighty years means that this star would move through the local [[ecliptic]] as slowly as [[Uranus]] with its eighty-four year period, but as the orbit of Alpha Centauri A is more elliptical, its apparent magnitude will be far more variable. Although intensely bright to the eye, the overall illumination would not significantly affect climate nor influence normal plant [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Croswell&quot;/&gt;
&lt;!--
Base Calculation: Sun gives us about 1 kW·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; of energy at ground level, and about 60% of it is in visible light, so we can count 600 W·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. Street lamps placed on each tenth meter have to illuminate about 100&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; each. Power of lamps vary. Let's assume them to emit 50 W each (we count light emission, not energy consumption). Then we have 1 W·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 1200 times less than the Sun. This is somewhere between 70 and 2700 (ranges given above are 70–840 for one star and 190–2700 for another). There are various cities and various streets with various levels of illumination, but arguably most of them fits in the given ranges (70 to 2700 dimmer than the Sun). One can also argue that illumination from the other companion would depend on local weather and on its elevation above the horizon. It's true, and it expands the latter bound from 2700 to maybe even 27000, but it doesn't change much about the comparison usefulness here&amp;nbsp;— it was meant primarily to give an idea of how much is several hundred times dimmer than Sun, but several hundred times brighter than Moon.

The visual effeciency of the light of a K star (alpha Cen B) is not too different from that of a G star (alpha Cen A, the Sun). Furthermore, if V magnitudes are used, then the magnitudes are even better comparable since the astronomical V band filter is similar to the eyes night vision sensitivity curve in shape.
--&gt;

An observer on the hypothetical planet would notice a change in orientation to VLBI reference points commensurate with the binary orbit periodicity plus or minus any local effects such as precession or nutation.

Assuming this hypothetical planet had a low orbital inclination with respect to the mutual orbit of Alpha Centauri A and B, then the secondary star would start beside the primary at 'stellar' [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]]. Half the period later, at 'stellar' [[Opposition (astronomy and astrology)|opposition]], both stars would be opposite each other in the sky. Then, for about half the planetary year the appearance of the night sky would be a darker blue&amp;nbsp;— similar to the sky during totality at any total [[solar eclipse]]. Humans could easily walk around and clearly see the surrounding terrain. Also reading a book would be quite possible without any artificial light.&lt;ref name=&quot;Croswell&quot; /&gt; After another half period in the stellar orbit, the stars would complete their orbital cycle and return to the next stellar conjunction, and the familiar Earth-like day and night cycle would return.

Burritt called the star Bungula,&lt;ref&gt;Burritt, E. H., ''[[Star atlas|Atlas]], Designed to Illustrate the Geography of the Heavens'', (New Edition), New York, F. J. Huntington and Co., 1835, pl. VII.&lt;/ref&gt; possibly coined from &quot;β&quot; and the [[Latin]] ''ungula'' (&quot;hoof&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;K&amp;S&quot;/&gt; This latter name is rarely used today. 

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], {{lang|zh|南門}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|Nán Mén}}), meaning ''[[Horn (Chinese constellation)|Southern Gate]]'', refers to an asterism consisting of α Centauri and [[Epsilon Centauri|ε Centauri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} ''中國星座神話'', written by 陳久金. Published by 台灣書房出版有限公司, 2005, ISBN 9789867332257.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, α Centauri itself is known as {{lang|zh|南門二}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|Nán Mén èr}}, {{lang-en|the Second Star of Southern Gate}}.)&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/Space/Research/StarName/c_research_chinengstars_n_r.htm 香港太空館 - 研究資源 - 亮星中英對照表], Hong Kong Space Museum.

==Use in modern fiction==
{{Main|Alpha Centauri in fiction}}
Alpha Centauri's relative proximity makes it in some ways the logical choice as &quot;first port of call&quot;. [[Speculative fiction]] about [[interstellar travel]] often predicts eventual human [[space exploration|exploration]], and even the [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]] and [[space colonization|colonization]] of [[planetary system]]s. These themes are common to many works of [[science fiction]] and [[video game]]s.

The '''Amiga''' is a family of [[personal computer]]s that was sold by [[Commodore International|Commodore]] in the 1980s and 1990s. The first model was launched in 1985 as a high-end home computer and became popular for its impressive graphical, audio and multi-tasking abilities. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from 8-bit computers, such as the [[Commodore 64]], and the platform quickly grew in popularity among computer enthusiasts. The best selling model, the [[Amiga 500]], was introduced in 1987 and became the leading home computer of the late 1980s and early 1990s in much of Western Europe. In [[North America]] success was more modest. The Amiga went on to sell approximately six million units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/total-share.ars | title=Total share: 30 years of personal computer market share figures | author=Jeremy Reimer | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second generation Amiga systems ([[Amiga 1200|A1200]] and [[Amiga 4000|A4000]]) were released in 1992. However, poor marketing and failure to repeat the technological advances of the first systems meant that the Amiga quickly lost its market share to competing platforms, such as the [[fourth generation game console]]s and [[IBM PC compatible]]s{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

Based on the [[Motorola 68000 family|Motorola 68000 series]] of [[microprocessor]]s, the machine sports a [[original Amiga chipset|custom chipset]] with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a [[pre-emptive multitasking]] operating system called [[AmigaOS]].

The Amiga was particularly popular for gaming and [[demoscene]] activities. It also found a prominent role in the [[desktop video]], [[video production]], and [[show control]] business, leading to affordable video editing systems such as the [[Video Toaster]]. It was also a less expensive alternative to the [[Apple Macintosh]] and [[IBM-PC]] as a general-purpose business or home computer. The Amiga's native ability to play back several channels of digital samples made it a popular platform for early &quot;[[Tracker (music software)|tracker]]&quot; music software, and the machine's relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory led to the development of several 3D rendering packages, including [[LightWave 3D]] and [[Aladdin 4D]]. The Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer, with a wide range of games and creative software, although early Commodore advertisements attempted to cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://youtube.com/watch?v=PsJ0ZZMuEQs YouTube.com], Commodore advert 1987 - ''Celebrities''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://youtube.com/watch?v=ludrX2s1ZuM YouTube.com], Commodore advert 1987 - TV spot version of 20-minute presentation&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the demise of Commodore, various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line. [[Eyetech]] sold PowerPC based hardware under the [[AmigaOne]] brand from 2002 to 2005, and Acube sells the Amiga hardware clones [[Sam440]] and [[Sam460]] with PowerPC processor.

The name ''Amiga'' was chosen by the developers specifically from the Spanish word for a female friend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/ahistory.html | title=The Twists and Turns of the Amiga Saga | work=Amiga History Guide | author=Gareth Knight | accessdate=2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--NB yes there are several other languages that use the same word, but the Amiga developers only knew Spanish and so that's the derivation. Please don't add a list of other languages here --&gt; and because it occurred before [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Atari]] alphabetically. It also gave the message that the Amiga computer line was 'user friendly' as a sort of pun or play on words.&lt;ref&gt;DeMaria and Wilson (2003) ''High Score!: The Illustrated History of Electronic Games'' p. 109 ISBN 0-07-223172-6&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of the Amiga}}

{{Rquote|right|&quot;The Amiga was so far ahead of its time that almost nobody--including Commodore's marketing department--could fully articulate what it was all about. Today, it's obvious the Amiga was the first multimedia computer, but in those days it was derided as a game machine because few people grasped the importance of advanced graphics, sound, and video. Nine years later, vendors are still struggling to make systems that work like 1985 Amigas.&lt;br /&gt;--''[[Byte Magazine]],'' August 1994}}
[[Image:Amiga-90sLogo.gif|right|thumb|200px|Logo used by Commodore in the US during the late 1980s]]
[[Image:Recent Amiga.svg|thumb|right|265px|Amiga Technologies Logo. (1996)]]

Development of the Amiga began in 1982 with [[Jay Miner]] as the principal hardware designer of [[Amiga Corporation]]. It was initially intended to be a next generation [[video game]] machine, but was later redesigned as a general purpose computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amigau.com/aig/prototypes/lorraine.html | title=Amiga Lorraine | work=Amiga History Guide | author=Gareth Knight | accessdate=2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigaforever.com/games/ AmigaForever.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Amiga Forever - Amiga Games&lt;/ref&gt; In order to bring the design to market [[Commodore International]] bought Amiga Corporation and funded development. The first model was released in 1985 as simply &quot;The Amiga from Commodore&quot;, later to be retroactively dubbed the [[Amiga 1000]]. The following year the Amiga product line was expanded with the introduction of two new models; the [[Amiga 2000]] for high-end graphics and business use, and the [[Amiga 500]] for home use. Commodore later released other Amiga models, both for low-end gaming use and high-end productivity use.

In 1994, Commodore filed for bankruptcy and its assets were purchased by [[Escom (computer corp)|Escom]], a German PC manufacturer, who created the subsidiary company Amiga Technologies. They re-released the A1200 and A4000T, and introduced a new [[68060]] version of the A4000T. However, Escom in turn went bankrupt in 1997. The Amiga brand was then sold to another PC manufacturer, [[Gateway 2000]], which had announced grand plans for it. However, in 2000, Gateway sold the Amiga brand without having released any products. The current owner of the trademark, [[Amiga, Inc.]], licensed the rights to sell hardware using the [[AmigaOne]] brand to computer vendors Eyetech Group, Ltd. and A-Eon Technology CVBA. Unofficial Amiga clones were developed by Italian hardware company, [[Acube]].

== Hardware ==
At its core, the Amiga has a custom chipset consisting of several [[coprocessor]]s, which handle audio, video and [[direct memory access]] independently of the [[Central Processing Unit]] (CPU). This architecture freed up the Amiga's processor for other tasks and gave the Amiga a performance edge over its competitors, particularly in terms of video-intensive applications and games.

=== Central processing unit ===
&lt;!-- Removed image: [[Image:Motorola PowerPC 604e 233MHz.jpg|75px|thumb|right|&lt;small&gt;[[PowerPC]] processor.&lt;/small&gt;]] --&gt;

The [[Motorola]] [[Motorola 68000 family|68000]] series of microprocessors was used in all Amiga models from Commodore. While the 68000 family has a [[32-bit]] design, the 68000 used in several early models is generally referred to as 16-bit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/oneamiga1.html | title = The One for 16-bit Games | accessdate = 2007-07-17 | first = Gareth | last = Knight | work = Amiga History Guide }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amigareviews.classicgaming.gamespy.com/s_snippe.htm | title = Amiga Reviews: Zzap 16-Bit Gaming|accessdate =2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 68000 has a [[16-bit]] external [[data bus]] so must transfer 32 bits of data in two consecutive steps, a technique called [[multiplexing]]&amp;nbsp;— all this is transparent to the software, which was 32-bit from the beginning. The 68000 could address 16 MB of physical memory. Later Amiga models featured full 32-bit CPUs with a larger address space and [[instruction pipeline]] facilities. Commodore's design choice to remain with the 68000 architecture ensured that code was backward-compatible across the Amiga line.

CPU upgrades were offered by both Commodore and third-party manufacturers. Most Amiga models can be upgraded either by direct CPU replacement or through expansion boards. Such boards often featured faster and higher capacity memory interfaces and [[hard disk drive|hard disk]] controllers.

Towards the end of Commodore's time in charge of Amiga development there were suggestions that Commodore intended to move away from the 68000 series to higher performance [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] processors, such as the [[PA-RISC]].&lt;ref name=Haynie &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/haynie3drisc.html |title=CBM's Plans for the RISC-Chipset |author=Dave Haynie |date=1995.01.24 |quote=The initial schedule of 18 months was for the Hombre game machine hardware. There's no real OS here, just a library of routines, including a 3D package, which would probably be licensed. The Amiga OS was not to have run on this system in any form. |publisher=Gareth Knight |accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these ideas were never developed before Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Despite this, third-party manufacturers designed upgrades featuring a combination of 68000 series and PowerPC processors along with a PowerPC native [[Kernel (computing)|micro-kernel]] and software.&lt;ref&gt;The Big Book of Amiga Hardware [http://amigahardware.mariomisic.de/cgi-bin/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=154 AmigaHardware.MarioMisic.de], [http://amigahardware.mariomisic.de/cgi-bin/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=225 AmigaHardware.MarioMisic.de]&lt;/ref&gt; Later Amiga clones featured PowerPC processors only.

=== Custom chipset ===
The custom chipset at the core of the Amiga design appeared in three distinct generations, with a large degree of backward-compatibility. The [[Original Chip Set]] (OCS) appeared with the launch of the A1000. OCS was eventually followed by the modestly improved [[Enhanced Chip Set]] (ECS) in 1990 and finally by the 32-bit [[Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA) in 1992. Each chipset consists of several [[coprocessors]] which handle [[raster graphics]], digital audio, [[direct memory access]] and communication between various peripherals (e.g., CPU, memory and floppy disks). In addition, some models featured auxiliary [[Amiga custom chips|custom chip]]s which performed tasks, such as, [[SCSI]] control and display de-interlacing.

==== Graphics ====
[[Image:HAM6example.png|thumb|right|A 4096 color [[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM]] picture created with [[Photon Paint]] in 1989.]]

All Amiga systems can display full-screen animated graphics with 32, 64 ([[Amiga Halfbrite mode|EHB Mode]]) or 4096 colors ([[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM Mode]]). Models with the AGA chipset (A1200 and A4000) also have 128, 256 and 262144 ([[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM Mode]]) color modes and a palette expanded from 4096 to [[Truecolor|16.8 million colors]].
&lt;!-- Something about retargetable graphic hardware here --&gt;
The Amiga chipset can ''[[genlock]]''&amp;nbsp;— adjust its own screen refresh timing to match an NTSC or PAL video signal. When combined with setting transparency, this allows an Amiga to overlay an external video source with graphics. This ability made the Amiga popular for many applications, and provides the ability to do [[Character generator|character generation]] and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects far more cheaply than earlier systems. Some frequent users of this ability included wedding videographers, TV stations and their weather forecasting divisions (for weather graphics and radar), advertising channels, music video production, and 'desktop video'. The [[NewTek]] [[Video Toaster]] was made possible by the genlock ability of the Amiga.

In 1988 the release of the Amiga A2024&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amiga-hardware.com/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=863 Commodore: A2024]&lt;/ref&gt; fixed-frequency [[monochrome]] monitor with built-in framebuffer and flicker fixer hardware provided the Amiga with a choice of high-resolution graphic modes (1024×800 for NTSC and 1024×1024 for PAL).

==== Sound ====
The sound chip, named Paula, supports four sound channels (two for the left speaker and two for the right) with 8-bit resolution for each channel and a 6-bit volume control per channel. The analog output is connected to a low-pass filter, which filters out high-frequency aliases when the Amiga is using a lower sampling rate (see [[Nyquist limit]]). The brightness of the Amiga's power LED is used to indicate the status of the Amiga’s low-pass filter. The filter is active when the LED is at normal brightness, and deactivated when dimmed (or off on older A500 Amigas). On Amiga 1000 (and very first Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000 model), the power LED had no relation to the filter's status, a wire needed to be manually soldered between pins on the sound chip to disable the filter. Paula can read directly from the system's [[RAM]], using direct memory access (DMA), making sound playback without CPU intervention possible.

Although the hardware is limited to four separate sound channels, software such as ''[[OctaMED]]'' uses software mixing to allow eight or more virtual channels, and it was possible for software to mix two hardware channels to achieve a single 14-bit resolution channel by playing with the volumes of the channels in such a way that one of the source channels contributes the most significant bits and the other the least ones.

The quality of the Amiga's sound output, and the fact that the hardware is ubiquitous and easily addressed by software, were standout features of Amiga hardware unavailable on PC platforms for years. Third-party sound cards exist that provide DSP functions, multi-track direct-to-disk recording, multiple hardware sound channels and 16-bit and beyond resolutions. A retargetable sound API called [[AHI (Amiga)|AHI]] was developed allowing these cards to be used transparently by the OS and software.

=== Kickstart firmware ===
{{Main|Kickstart (Amiga)}}
Kickstart is the [[booting|bootstrap]] [[firmware]]. Its purpose is to initialize the Amiga hardware and core components of [[AmigaOS]] and then attempt to boot from a [[bootable]] [[volume (computing)|volume]], such as a floppy disk or hard disk drive.

The first production Amiga, the Amiga 1000, required Kickstart to be loaded first from floppy disk into 256 [[kilobyte|kB]] of RAM reserved for this purpose. Later models generally hold Kickstart on an embedded [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chip, improving start-up times. Models can be upgraded by replacing the ROM. Like the Amiga 1000, early Amiga 3000 systems loaded Kickstart from hard (or floppy) disk as the machine was launched while AmigaOS 2.0 was still in [[software release cycle#Beta|beta]] development.

Several third-party vendors produced switchable socket doublers to allow two ROM chips to plug into the single ROM socket on the motherboard. These became popular as later Kickstart versions caused some backwards compatibility problems with earlier Amiga software titles. The effect of these switchable doublers was a convenient [[dual boot]] system, with a choice of two distinct OS versions via a pre-determined key sequence at reboot, or via a two way switch installed in the case, depending on the specific version installed.

=== Peripherals ===
The Amiga was one of the first home computers for which inexpensive sound sampling and video digitization accessories were available. As a result of this and the Amiga's audio and video capabilities the Amiga became a popular system for editing and producing both music and video.

Many expansion boards were produced for Amiga computers to improve the performance and capability of the hardware, such as memory expansions, [[SCSI]] controllers, CPU boards, and graphics boards. Other upgrades include genlocks, Ethernet cards, modems, sound cards and samplers, video digitizers, USB cards, extra serial ports, and IDE controllers.

The most popular upgrades were memory, SCSI controllers and CPU accelerator cards. These were sometimes combined into the one device.

Early CPU accelerator cards feature full 32-bit CPUs of the 68000 family such as the [[Motorola 68020]] and [[Motorola 68030]], almost always with 32-bit memory and usually with [[floating point unit|FPUs]] and [[Memory management unit|MMUs]] or the facility to add them. Later designs feature the [[Motorola 68040]] and [[Motorola 68060]]. Both CPUs feature integrated FPUs and MMUs. Many CPU accelerator cards also had integrated SCSI controllers.

Phase5 designed the [[PowerUP (accelerator)|PowerUP]] boards ([[PowerUP (accelerator)#Blizzard PPC|Blizzard PPC]] and [[PowerUP (accelerator)#Cyberstorm PPC|CyberStorm PPC]]) featuring both a 68k (a 68040 or 68060) and a PowerPC (603 or 604) CPU, which are able to run the two CPUs at the same time (and share the system memory). The PowerPC CPU on PowerUP boards is usually used as a coprocessor for heavy computations (a powerful CPU is needed to run for example [[MAME]], but even decoding [[JPEG]] pictures and [[MP3]] audio was considered heavy computation at the time). It is also possible to ignore the 68k CPU and run [[Linux]] on the PPC (project Linux APUS), but a PowerPC native AmigaOS promised by Amiga Technologies GmbH was not available when the PowerUP boards first appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amiga goes POWER PC (TM)|url=http://www.cucug.org/amiga/aminews/1995/at951111.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

24-bit graphics cards and video cards were also available. Graphics cards are designed primarily for 2D artwork production, workstation use, and later, gaming. Video cards are designed for inputting and outputting video signals, and processing and manipulating video.

Perhaps the most famous video card in the North American market was the ''NewTek [[Video Toaster]]''. This was a powerful video effects board which turned the Amiga into an affordable video processing computer which found its way into many professional video environments. Due to its [[NTSC]]-only design it did not find a market in countries that used the [[PAL]] standard, such as in Europe. In PAL countries the ''OpalVision'' card was popular, although less featured and supported than the Video Toaster. Low-cost [[Timebase correction|time base correctors (TBCs)]] specifically designed to work with the Toaster quickly came to market, most of which were designed as standard Amiga bus cards.

Various manufacturers started producing PCI busboards for the A1200 and A4000, allowing standard Amiga computers to use PCI cards such as Voodoo graphic cards, [[Sound Blaster]] sound cards, 10/100 Ethernet cards, and TV tuner cards. Other manufacturers produced hybrid boards which contained an Intel x86 series chip, allowing the Amiga to emulate a PC.

PowerPC upgrades with Wide SCSI controllers, PCI busboards with Ethernet, sound and 3D graphics cards, and tower cases allowed the A1200 and A4000 to survive well into the late nineties.

Expansion boards were made by [[Richmond Sound Design]] that allow their [[show control]] and [[sound design]] software to communicate with their custom hardware frames either by ribbon cable or fiber optic cable for long distances, allowing the Amiga to control up to eight million digitally controlled external audio, lighting, automation, relay and voltage control channels spread around a large theme park, for example. See [[Amiga software]] for more information on these applications.

=== Networking ===
Amiga had three networking interface APIs:
* AS225 - Is the official Commodore TCP/IP stack [[Application programming interface|API]] with hardcoded drivers in revision 1 (AS225r1) for the [[AMD Lance Am7990|A2065 Ethernet]] and the A2060 Arcnet interfaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;amigahi_netfaq_AmiTCP&quot;/&gt; In revision 2 (AS225r2) the SANA-II interface was used.
* SANA-II&amp;nbsp;— Is a standardized API for hardware of network interfaces. It uses an inefficient buffer handling scheme, and lacks proper support for [[Promiscuous mode|promiscuous]] and [[multicast]] modes.
* Miami Network Interface (MNI) - Is an API that doesn't have the problems which SANA-II suffers from. It requires [[AmigaOS]] v2,04 or higher.

Different network media was used:

They are, in order of appearance: [[Amiga 1000|1000]], [[Amiga 2000|2000]], [[Amiga 500|500]], [[Amiga 1500|1500]], [[Amiga 2500|2500]], [[Amiga 3000|3000]], [[Amiga 3000UX|3000UX]], [[Amiga 3000T|3000T]], [[Amiga CDTV|CDTV]], [[Amiga 500+|500+]], [[Amiga 600|600]], [[Amiga 4000|4000]], [[Amiga 1200|1200]], [[Amiga CD32|CD32]], and [[Amiga 4000T|4000T]]. The PowerPC based [[AmigaOne]] was later produced from 2002 to 2005. Some companies have also released Amiga [[Clone (computer science)|clones]].

=== Commodore Amiga ===
[[Image:Amiga500 system.jpg|thumb|The [[Amiga 500]] (1987) was the best selling model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/sales.html AmigaHistory.co.uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Commodore-Amiga Sales Figures&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Image:Amiiga4000DP.jpg|thumb|The [[Amiga 4000]] (1992) was the last desktop computer made by Commodore.]]
The first Amiga model, the Amiga 1000, was launched in 1985 as a high-end home computer and became popular for its impressive graphics, video and audio capabilities. In 2006, [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] rated the Amiga 1000 as the seventh greatest PC of all time, stating &quot;''Years ahead of its time, the Amiga was the world's first multimedia, multitasking personal computer''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,126692-page,8-c,systems/article.html PC World, The 25 Greatest PCs of All Time]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the A1000, Commodore updated the desktop line of Amiga computers with the [[Amiga 2000]] in 1987, the [[Amiga 3000]] in 1990, and the [[Amiga 4000]] in 1992, each offering improved capabilities and expansion options. However, the best selling models were the budget models, particularly the highly successful [[Amiga 500]] (1987) and the [[Amiga 1200]] (1992). The [[Amiga 500+]] (1991) was the shortest lived model, replacing the Amiga 500 and lasting only six months until it was phased out and replaced with the [[Amiga 600]] (1992), which in turn was also quickly replaced by the Amiga 1200.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/a500plus.html Commodore Amiga 500+]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commodore CDTV|CDTV]], launched in 1991, was a [[CD-ROM]] based all-in-one multimedia system. It was an early attempt at a multi-purpose multimedia appliance in an era before multimedia consoles and CD-ROM drives were common. Unfortunately for Commodore, the system never achieved any real commercial success.

Commodore's last Amiga offering before filing for bankruptcy was an attempt to capture a portion of the highly competitive 1990s console market with the [[Amiga CD32]] (1993), a 32-bit CD-ROM games console. Though discontinued after Commodore's demise it met with moderate commercial success in Europe.

Following purchase of Commodore's assets by Escom in 1995, the A1200 and A4000T continued to be sold in small quantities until 1996, though the ground lost since the initial launch and the prohibitive expense of these units meant that the Amiga line never regained any real popularity.

Several Amiga models contained references to songs by the [[rock music|rock]] band [[The B-52's]]. Early A500 units, at least, had the words &quot;B52/ROCK LOBSTER&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollerfink.de/wp-content/rollerfink.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/img_1518.JPG RollerFink.de]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Printed circuit board#Manufacturing|silk-screen printed]] onto their [[printed circuit board]], a reference to the popular song &quot;[[Rock Lobster]]&quot;  The [[Amiga 600]] referenced  &quot;JUNE BUG&quot; (after the song &quot;Junebug&quot;) and the [[Amiga 1200]] had &quot;CHANNEL Z&quot; (after &quot;[[Channel Z (song)|Channel Z]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knight|first=Gareth|title=References to B52 songs on Amiga Motherboards|year=1997-2006|url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/b52board.html|accessdate =2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AmigaOS 4 systems ===
{{Main|AmigaOS 4}}
[[Image:AmigaOS 4.1 Update 2.png|right|thumb|[[AmigaOS 4.1]] Update 2]]

AmigaOS 4 (OS4) is designed for PowerPC Amiga systems and currently runs on both Amigas equipped with CyberstormPPC or BlizzardPPC accelerator boards, and on the PPC Teron series based [[AmigaOne]] computers built by [[Eyetech]] under license by Amiga Inc. AmigaOS 4.0 had been available only in developer pre-releases for numerous years until it was officially released in December 2006. Due to the nature of some provisions of the contract between Amiga Inc. and [[Hyperion Entertainment]] (the Belgian company which is developing the OS), the commercial AmigaOS 4 had been available only to licensed buyers of AmigaOne motherboards.

AmigaOS 4.0 for Amigas equipped with PowerUP accelerator boards was released in November 2007. The most recent release AmigaOS is 4.1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/amigaos41-ars.ars/5 It's alive!: Ars reviews AmigaOS 4.1], Ars Technica, September 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

No new Amiga hardware has been released since the AmigaOne; however [[Acube Systems]] has entered an agreement with Hyperion under which it has ported AmigaOS 4 to its [[Sam440ep]] and [[Sam460ex]] line of PowerPC-based motherboards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acube-systems.biz/eng/news.php?id=35 ''OEM Version of AmigaOS 4.1 for Sam440ep imminent''], Acube Systems, September 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 version for [[Pegasos|Pegasos II]] from [[Genesi]]/[[Bplan|bPlan GmbH]] was released in co-operation with Acube Systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amigaworld.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=4740 ''AmigaOS 4.1 for Pegasos II''], Hyperion Entertainment, January 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in 2009/2010, A-Eon Technology announced the [[AmigaOne X1000]].

=== Amiga hardware clones ===
Long-time Amiga developer MacroSystem entered the Amiga-clone market with their [http://www.amiga-hardware.com/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=43 DraCo] [[Non-linear editing system|nonlinear video edit]] system. It appears in two versions, initially a tower model and later a cube. DraCo expanded upon and combined a number of earlier expansion cards developed for Amiga (VLabMotion, Toccata, WarpEngine, RetinaIII) into a true Amiga-clone powered by Motorola's [[Motorola 68060|68060]] processor. The DraCo can run AmigaOS 3.1 up through AmigaOS 3.9. It is the only Amiga-based system to support [[FireWire]] for video I/O. DraCo also offers an Amiga-compatible [[Amiga Zorro II|ZORRO-II]] expansion bus and introduced a faster custom DraCoBus, capable of 30 MB/sec transfer rates (faster than Commodore's [[Amiga Zorro III|ZORRO-III]]). The technology was later used in the Casablanca system, a set-top-box also designed for non-linear video editing.

In 1998, [[Index Information]] released the Access, an Amiga-clone similar to the Amiga 1200, but on a motherboard which could fit into a standard [[Drive bay#5%&quot;|5 1/4&quot; drive bay]]. It features either a [[Motorola 68020|68020]] or [[Motorola 68030|68030]] CPU, with a redesigned [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset, and runs AmigaOS 3.1.

In 1998, former Amiga employees (John Smith, Peter Kittel, [[Dave Haynie]] and Andy Finkel to mention few) formed new company called PIOS. Their hardware platform, PIOS One, was aimed at Amiga, Atari and Macintosh users. The company was renamed to Met@box in 1999 until it folded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/pios/pios1.html|title=PIOS One}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, two new Amiga clones were announced, both using [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] based hardware synthesis to replace the Amiga [[Amiga Original chipset|OCS]] custom chipset. The first, the [[Minimig]], is a personal project of Dutch engineer Dennis van Weeren.  Referred to as &quot;new Amiga hardware&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;minimig&quot;&gt;[http://home.hetnet.nl/~weeren001/minimig.html HetNet.nl]&lt;/ref&gt; the original model was built on a [[Xilinx]] Spartan-3 development board, but soon a dedicated board was developed. The minimig uses the FPGA to reproduce the custom Denise, Agnus, Paula and [[Amiga custom chips#Gary|Gary]] chips as well as both 8520 [[MOS Technology CIA|CIAs]] and implements a simple version of [[Amiga custom chips#Amber|Amber]].  The rest of the chips are an actual 68000 CPU, ram chips, and a PIC microcontroller for [[BIOS]] control.&lt;ref name=&quot;minimig&quot;/&gt;  The design for Minimig was released as [[open source]] on July 25, 2007. In February, 2008, an Italian company [[Acube Systems]] began selling Minimig boards. A third party upgrade replaces the PIC microcontroller with a more powerful ARM processor, providing more functionality such as write access and support for harddrive images. The minimig core is being ported to the FPGArcade &quot;Replay&quot; board. The Replay uses a larger FPGA which will support the AGA chipset and a 63030 soft core. The Replay board is designed to emulate many older computers and classic arcade machines.

The second is the Clone-A system announced by [[Individual Computers]]. As of mid 2007 it has been shown in its development form, with FPGA-based boards replacing the Amiga chipset and mounted on an Amiga 500 motherboard.&lt;ref name=&quot;individual&quot;&gt;[http://siliconsonic.de/news/news118_e.htm SiliconSonic.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emulation ===
{{Main|Amiga emulation}}
Like many popular but discontinued platforms, the Amiga has been the target of various emulation projects so that software developed for the Amiga can be run on other computer platforms without the original hardware. Such emulators attempt to replicate the functionality of the Amiga architecture in software. As mentioned above, attempts have also been made to replicate the Amiga chipset in [[FPGA]] chips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acube-systems.biz/index.php?page=news&amp;id=23 &quot;Minimig available&quot; announcement by Acube Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most challenging aspects of emulation is the design of the Amiga chipset, which relies on cycle-critical timings. As a result, early emulators did not always achieve the intended results though later emulator versions can now accurately reproduce the behavior of Amiga systems.

== Operating systems ==
=== AmigaOS ===
{{Main|AmigaOS}}
{{Rquote|right|&quot;[AmigaOS] remains one of the great operating systems of the past 20 years, incorporating a small kernel and tremendous [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] capabilities the likes of which have only recently been developed in [[OS/2]] and [[Windows NT]]. The biggest difference is that the AmigaOS could operate fully and multitask in as little as {{nowrap|250 K}} of address space.&lt;br /&gt;--''[[John C. Dvorak]], PC Magazine,'' October 1996.&lt;ref&gt;From PC Magazine, October 22, 1996
Inside Track By John C. Dvorak&lt;/ref&gt;}}

AmigaOS is a single-user [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] [[operating system]]. It was developed first by Commodore International, and initially introduced in 1985 with the Amiga 1000. Original versions run on the Motorola 68000 series of microprocessors, while [[AmigaOS 4]] runs only on PowerPC microprocessors. At the time of release AmigaOS put an operating system that was well ahead of its time into the hands of the average consumer. It was one of the first commercially available consumer operating systems for personal computers to implement [[Preemption (computing)|preemptive]] multitasking.

Another notable feature was the combined use of both a [[command-line interface]] and [[graphical user interface]]. [[AmigaDOS]] was the disk operating system and command line portion of the OS and [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] the native graphical windowing, [[Icon (computer)|icon]]s, menu and pointer environment for file management and launching applications. Notably, AmigaDOS allowed long [[filename]]s (up to 107 characters) with [[Whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]] and did not require [[file extension]]s.

The multi-tasking kernel was called [[Exec (Amiga)|Exec]]. It acts as a scheduler for tasks running on the system, providing pre-emptive multitasking with prioritised round-robin scheduling. It enabled true pre-emptive multitasking in as little as 256 kB of free memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;cunningham_lee_amiga_exec&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cunningham-lee.com/misc/amiga_exec.html|title=Byte Magazine on the Amiga Exec|accessdate=2008-04-12|last= Holloway|first= Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other operating systems of the time, the OS lacks [[memory protection]]. This was because the [[Motorola 68000|68000]] [[CPU]] does not include a [[memory management unit]] and therefore there is no way to enforce protection of memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;google.groups.com (Memory Protection)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.amiga.advocacy/msg/7d0bf445a2c22d67?hl=en&amp;|title= Adding Memory Protection (MP) to the Amiga|work = groups.google.com|accessdate = December 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this speeds and eases [[interapplication communication]] (programs can communicate by simply passing a [[Pointer (computing)|pointer]] back and forth), the lack of memory protection made the AmigaOS more vulnerable to [[Crash (computing)|crashes]] from badly behaving [[Computer program|programs]], and fundamentally incapable of enforcing any form of security model since any program had full access to the system. A co-operational memory protection feature was implemented in [[AmigaOS 4]] and could be retrofitted to old AmigaOS systems using [[Enforcer]]{{dn}} or [[CyberGuard]] tools.

The problem was somewhat exacerbated by Commodore's initial decision to release documentation relating not only to the OS's underlying software routines, but also to the hardware itself, enabling intrepid programmers who cut their teeth on the Commodore 64 to [[Peek and Poke|POKE]] the hardware directly, as was done on the older platform. While the decision to release the documentation was a popular one and allowed the creation of fast, sophisticated sound and graphics routines in games and demos, it also contributed to system instability as some programmers lacked the expertise to program at this level. For this reason, when the new [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset was released, [[Commodore International|Commodore]] declined to release low-level documentation in an attempt to force developers into using the approved software routines.

==== Influences on other Operating Systems ====

AmigaOS directly or indirectly inspired the development of various operating systems. [[MorphOS]] and [[AROS]] clearly inherit heavily from the structure of AmigaOS as explained directly in articles regarding these two operating systems. AmigaOS also influenced [[BeOS]], which featured a centralized system of [[Amiga support and maintenance software#Datatypes|Datatypes]], similar to that present in AmigaOS. Likewise, [[DragonFlyBSD]] was also inspired by AmigaOS as stated by Dragonfly developer [[Matthew Dillon (computer scientist)|Matthew Dillon]] who is a former Amiga developer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/mailarchive/kernel/2006-02/msg00087.html Re: User-Space Device Drivers], [[Matthew Dillon (computer scientist)|Matthew Dillon]], Dragonfly Kernel mailing list, 28 February 2006. Retrieved 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/mailarchive/kernel/2003-07/msg00049.html Re: You could do worse than Mach ports], [[Matthew Dillon (computer scientist)|Matthew Dillon]], Dragonfly Kernel mailing list, 17 July 2003. Retrieved 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unix and Unix-like systems ===
Commodore-Amiga produced [[Amiga Unix]], informally known as Amix, based on AT&amp;T [[UNIX System V|SVR4]]. It supports the [[Amiga 2500]] and Amiga 3000 and was included with the [[Amiga 3000UX]]. Among other unusual features of Amix is a hardware-accelerated windowing system which can scroll windows without copying data. Amix is not supported on the later Amiga systems based on [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[Motorola 68060|68060]] processors.

Other, still maintained, operating systems are available for the classic Amiga platform, including Linux and [[NetBSD]]. Both require a CPU with MMU such as the [[Motorola 68020|68020]] with [[Motorola 68851|68851]] or full versions of the [[Motorola 68030|68030]], [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[Motorola 68060|68060]]. There is also a version of Linux for Amigas with PowerPC accelerator cards. [[Debian]] and [[Yellow Dog Linux]] can run on the AmigaOne.

There is an official, older version of [[OpenBSD]]. The last Amiga release is 3.2. [[Minix]] 1.5.10 also runs on Amiga.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compwisdom.com/topics/Minix Minix] ''Comp Wisdon''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emulating other systems ===
{{Main|Emulation on the Amiga}}
The Amiga is able to emulate other computer platforms ranging from many 8-bit systems such as the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], Commodore 64, Nintendo Game Boy, Nintendo Entertainment System, [[Apple II]] and the [[TRS-80]], up to platforms such as the IBM PC, Apple Macintosh and Atari ST. [[MAME]] (the arcade machine emulator) is also available for Amiga systems with PPC accelerator card upgrades.

== Amiga software ==
{{Main|Amiga software}}
The Amiga was a primary target for productivity and game development during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Software was often developed for the Amiga and the [[Atari ST]] simultaneously, since the ST had a similar CPU architecture.

&lt;!-- Technical trivialities, like how many bytes that is moved across the bus, is not all that interesting. And try to keep AmigaOS stuff to the AmigaOS article --&gt;
[[Aminet]] was created in 1992 and until around 1996, was the largest public archive of software, art and documents for any platform.

== Boing Ball ==
[[Image:boingball.png|thumb|The Boing Ball.]]
The Boing Ball has been synonymous with Amiga since its public release in 1985. The bouncing ball (or other graphical elements) has been a popular theme in computer [[demo effect]]s since the 1950s, when a bouncing ball demo was released for [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]] computers and became the primary theme for early Atari games [[Pong]] and [[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]. [[Commodore International|Commodore]] released a bouncing ball demo at the 1978 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], to illustrate the capabilities of the VIC chip. A similar theme was used by Amiga Corporation to demonstrate the capabilities of the Amiga computer at the 1984 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1984. It was a real-time [[animation]] showing a red-and-white spinning ball (about 1/4 screen size) bouncing up and down and casting a shadow on a wall behind it. The echoing deep Bong! sound and left-right motion was added soon after the show was over. Since then, the Boing Ball became one of the most well-known symbols for Amiga and compatible computers.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Within the context of this tradition of bouncing ball demos at the Consumer Electronics Show, CBS Electronics also showed a Bouncing Ball demo for the [[Atari]] VCS/2600, with a spinning and bouncing ball, at the same event.

The 1984 Boing Ball demo was one of the very first demos shown on the Amiga. It was specifically designed to take advantage of the Amiga's custom graphics, achieving a level of speed and smoothness not previously seen on an affordable computer. The 1984 demo ran standalone as there was no official DOS operating system and Intuition was just a glint in [[Robert J. Mical|RJ Mical]]'s eye at the time. A year later this demo was converted to operate in an [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition]] Screen, allowing the higher resolution Amiga Workbench screen to be dragged down to make the Boing Ball visible from behind, bouncing up above the Workbench while the Workbench remained fully active. Since the Boing Ball used almost no CPU time (only to calculate the bounce angles - animation was handled by playfield vertical and horizontal scrolling tricks, the rotation animation was done with [[color cycling]] in the graphics chip, and of course the sound chip handled the sound), this made a particularly impressive demonstration of multitasking at the time.

The Boing Ball itself was never adopted as a [[trademark]] by [[Commodore International|Commodore]]. The official Amiga trademark is a rainbow-colored double [[checkmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/originsboing.html|title=Dr. Ryan Czerwinski of Merlancia Industries explains the origin of the Amiga Boing ball and checkmark|author=Ryan Czerwinski|date=December 31, 2001|work=Amiga Network News| accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Amiga community ==
When Commodore went bankrupt in 1994, there remained a very active Amiga community, which continued to support the platform long after mainstream commercial vendors abandoned it. The most popular Amiga magazine, ''[[Amiga Format]]'', continued to publish editions until 2000, some six years after Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Another magazine, ''[[Amiga Active]]'', was launched in 1999 and was published until 2001. Several magazines are in publication today, notably ''[http://www.amigafuture.de Amiga Future],'' which is available in both English and German; ''[http://www.bitplane.it Bitplane],'' a bi-monthly magazine in Italian; and ''[http://amigapower.free.fr/ AmigaPower],'' a long-running French magazine.

In spite of declining interest in the platform there was a bi-weekly specialist column in the UK weekly magazine [[Micro Mart]]. There is also a web site, [http://www.amiga.org/index.php Amiga.org], that has served as a community discussion and support resource since the 1994 bankruptcy. Other popular English-language [[Internet forum|''fora'']] also exist, particularly [http://www.amigaworld.net AmigaWorld.net] and [http://eab.abime.net/ English Amiga Board].

== Notable historic uses ==

* Amigas were used in various [[NASA]] laboratories to keep track of multiple low orbiting satellites, and were still used up to 2003/04 (dismissed and sold in 2006). This is another example of long lifetime reliability of Amiga hardware, as well as professional use. Amigas were also used at Kennedy Space Center to run strip-chart recorders, to format and display data, and control stations of platforms for [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta rocket]] launches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obligement.free.fr/articles/amiganasa.php|title=Reportage: l'Amiga à la NASA|publisher=obligement.free.fr }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''actinophryids''' are small, familiar group of [[heliozoa]]n protists.  They are the most common heliozoa in fresh water, and are especially frequent in lakes and rivers, but a few are found in marine and soil habitats as well.  Each actinophryid are unicellular and roughly spherical in shape, without any shell or test, and with many pseudopodia supported by axopods radiating outward from the cell body, which adhere to passing prey and allows it to roll or float about.  The outer portion of the cell, or ectoplasm, is distinct and is filled with many tiny [[vacuole]]s, which assist in flotation. This is very similar to the process of osmosis. The movement of water from inside the cell to the outside is not because of water concentration in this case. It is the cell pushing the excess water out. A few contractile vacuoles around the periphery of the cell expel excess water, and are visible as clear bulges when full.

There are two genera included here.  ''Actinophrys'' have a single, central nucleus.  Most are around [[1 E-5 m|40-50]] μm in diameter, with axopods up to 100 μm in length, though this varies.  ''Actinosphaerium'' are several times larger, from [[1 E-4 m|200-1000]] μm in diameter, with many nuclei, and are found exclusively in fresh water.  Two other genera, ''Echinosphaerium'' and ''Camptonema'', have been described but appear to be synonyms.

Reproduction takes place by fission, with open [[mitosis]].  Under unfavourable conditions, the organism will form a cyst, which is multi-walled and covered in spikes.  While encysted it may undergo a peculiar process of [[autogamy]] or self-fertilization, where it goes through [[meiosis]] and divides to form two gametes, which then fuse together again.  This is the only form of [[sexual reproduction]]  that occurs within the group, though it is really more genetic reorganization than reproduction.

The axopods are supported by [[microtubule]]s arranged in a unique and characteristic double-coil pattern.  In ''Actinophrys'', these arise from the nuclear membrane, while in ''Actinosphaerium'' some do and others don't.  Other heliozoa where the microtubules arise from the nucleus have been considered possible relatives, and it now appears that the actinophryids developed from [[axodine]]s such as ''[[Pedinella]]''.  These are specialized [[heterokont]] algae, related to [[golden alga]]e, [[diatom]]s, [[brown alga]]e, and the like, which have microtubule-supported tentacles.

As far as the diet of the Actinophyrys goes, the protist feeds on small flagellates, diminutive cilates, microscopic algae, etc.

'''Abel Janszoon Tasman''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈaːbəl ˈjɑnsoʊn ˈtɑsmɐn}}; 1603 – 10 October 1659) was a Dutch [[sea explorer|seafarer]], [[exploration|explorer]], and [[merchant]], best known for his voyages of 1642 and 1644 in the service of the VOC ([[United East India Company]]). His was the first known European expedition to reach the islands of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now [[Tasmania]]) and [[New Zealand]] and to sight the [[Fiji]] islands. His navigator François Visscher, and his merchant Isaack Gilsemans mapped substantial portions of [[Australia]], New Zealand and some [[Pacific Islands]].

== First pacific voyage ==
Abel Tasman was born in 1603 in [[Lutjegast]], a village in the province of Groningen. He was first heard of at the end of 1631, as a widower living at Amsterdam, where he married Jannetje Tjaers at that time. In 1633 Tasman joined the Dutch East India Company and sailed to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]; four years later he was back in Amsterdam. Tasman signed for another ten years and took his wife along to Batavia. In 1639 Tasman was sent as second in command of an exploring expedition in the north Pacific under [[Matthijs Quast]]. His fleet included the ships ''Engel'' and ''Gracht'' and reached [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]] ([[Dutch Formosa]]) and [[Deshima]]. In 1642 he signed a friendly trading treaty with the [[Sultan]] of [[Palembang]], Sumatra &lt;ref&gt;http://gutenberg.net.au/dictbiog/0-dict-biogT-V.html &lt;/ref&gt; offering military protection for pepper.

In August 1642, the Council of the Indies, consisting of [[Antonie van Diemen]], [[Cornelis van der Lijn]], [[Joan Maetsuycker]], [[Justus Schouten]], [[Salomon Sweers]], Cornelis Witsen, and Pieter Boreel in Batavia despatched Abel Tasman and Franchoijs Visscher on a voyage of which one of the objects was to obtain knowledge of &quot;all the totally unknown provinces of Beach&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Heeres, &quot;Abel Janszoon Tasman, His Life and Labours&quot;, ''Abel Tasman's Journal,'' Los Angeles, 1965, pp.137, 141–2; cited in Andrew Sharp, ''The Voyages of Abel Janszoon Tasman,'' Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1968, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beach, and Terra Australis===
''Beach'' appeared on maps of the time, notably that of [[Abraham Ortelius]] of 1570 and that of [[Jan Huygen van Linschoten]] of 1596, as the northernmost part of the southern continent, the ''[[Terra Australis]]'', along with ''Locach''. According to [[Marco Polo]], ''Locach'' was a kingdom where gold was “so plentiful that no none who did not see it could believe it”. ''Beach'' was in fact a mistranscription of ''Locach''. Locach was Marco Polo’s name for the southern Thai kingdom of Lavo, or [[Lop Buri]], the “city of Lavo”, (ลพบร, after Lavo, the son of [[Rama]] in [[Hindu mythology]]).&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Gerini, ''Researches on Ptolemy's geography of Eastern Asia (further India and Indo-Malay archipelago),'' London, Royal Asiatic Society, Asiatic Society Monographs vol.1, 1909, p.180.&lt;/ref&gt; In Chinese ([[Cantonese]]), Lavo was pronounced “Lo-huk” (羅斛), from which Marco Polo took his rendition of the name.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Pelliot, ''Notes on Marco Polo,'' Paris, Imprimerie Nationale, 1963, Vol.II, pp.768–9, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Kurrent|German cursive script]], “Locach” and “Beach” look similar {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, and in the 1532 edition of [[The Travels of Marco Polo|Marco Polo’s ''Travels'']] his Locach was changed to ''Boëach'', later shortened to ''Beach''.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Grynaeus and Johann Huttich, ''Novus Orbis Regionum ac Insularum,'' Basel and Paris, 1532, Marco Polo cap.xi, “De provincia Boëach”; cited in Thomas Suarez, ''Early Mapping of Southeast Asia,'' Hong Kong, Periplus, 1999, p.160.&lt;/ref&gt; They seem to have drawn on the map of the world published in Florence in 1489 by [[Henricus Martellus]], in which ''provincia boëach'' appears as the southern neighbour of ''provincia ciamba''. Book III of Marco Polo’s ''[[Il Milione]]'' described his journey by sea from China to India by way of [[Champa]] (= Southern Vietnam), Java (which he called ''[[Jave la Grande|Java Major]]''), Locach and Sumatra (called ''Java Minor''). After a chapter describing the kingdom of Champa there follows a chapter describing [[Java]] (which he did not visit himself).&lt;ref&gt;''Milione: il Milione nelle redazioni toscana e franco–italiana, Le Divisament dou Monde,'' Gabriella Ponchi (ed.), Milano, Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, 1982, p.540: cap. clxiii, &quot;La grant isle de Java&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative then resumes, describing the route southward from Champa toward [[Sumatra]], but by a slip of the pen the name “Java” was substituted for “Champa” as the point of departure, locating Sumatra 1,300 miles to the south of Java instead of Champa. Locach, located between Champa and Sumatra, was likewise mis-placed far to the south of Java, by some geographers on or near an extension of the ''Terra Australis''.&lt;ref&gt;James R. McClymont, “The Theory of an Antipodal Southern Continent during the Sixteenth Century”, ''Report of the Fourth Meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science,'' Hobart, January 1892, Hobart, the Association, 1893, pp.442–462; Paul Pelliot, ''Notes on Marco Polo,'' Paris, Imprimerie Nationale, 1963, Vol.II, p.769.&lt;/ref&gt; As explained by Sir [[Henry Yule]], the editor of an English edition of Marco Polo’s ''Travels'': “Some geographers of the 16th century, following the old editions which carried the travellers south-east of Java to the land of “Boeach” (or Locac), introduced in their maps a continent in that situation”.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Henry Yule (ed.), ''The Book of Ser Marco Polo,'' London, Murray, 1921, Volume 2, pp.276–280.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerard Mercator]] did just that on his 1541 globe,  placing ''Beach provincia aurifera'' (“Beach the gold-bearing province”) in the northernmost part of the ''Terra Australis'' in accordance with the faulty text of Marco Polo’s ''Travels''. It remained  in this location on his world  map of 1569, with the amplified description, quoting Marco Polo, ''Beach provincia aurifera quam pauci ex alienis regionibus adeunt propter gentis inhumanitatem'' (“Beach the gold-bearing province, wither few go from other countries because of the inhumanity of its people”) with ''Lucach regnum'' shown somewhat to its south west.&lt;ref&gt;Peter van der Krogt, ''Globi Neerlandici: The Production of Globes in the Low Countries,'' Utrecht, HES Publishers, 1993, p.64, plate 2.14.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Mercator, [[Abraham Ortelius]] also showed ''BEACH'' and ''LVCACH'' in these locations on his world map of 1571. Likewise, Linschoten’s very popular 1596 map of the East Indies showed ''BEACH'' projecting from the map’s southern edge, leading (or mis-leading) Visscher and Tasman in their voyage of 1642 to seek Beach with its plentiful gold in a location to the south of the [[Solomon Islands]] somewhere between [[Staten Land]] near [[Cape Horn]] and the [[Cape of Good Hope]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Sharp, ''The Voyages of Abel Janszoon Tasman,'' Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1968, pp.25.&lt;/ref&gt; Confirmation that land existed where the maps showed ''Beach'' to be had come from [[Dirk Hartog]]’s landing in October 1616 on its west coast, which he called [[Eendrachtsland]] after the name of his ship.

===Mauritius===
In accordance with Visscher's directions, Tasman sailed first to [[Mauritius]] and arrived on 5 September 1642. The reason for this was the crew could be fed well on the island; there was plenty of fresh water and timber to repair the ships. Tasman got the assistance of the governor [[Adriaan van der Stel]]. Because of the prevailing winds Mauritius was chosen as a turning point. After a four week stay on the island both ships left on 8 October. After one month it started to snow and hail; Tasman changed course more north. Part of the western shore of the continent was already known to the Dutch, but but no one had gone as far as [[Pieter Nuyts]].

=== Tasmania ===
On the 24th November 1642 Abel Tasman sighted the west coast of Tasmania, north of Macquarie Harbour.&lt;ref&gt;Original map of Tasmania in December 1642 [http://nla.gov.au/nla.map-ra265-s97] &lt;/ref&gt; He named his discovery Van Diemen's Land after [[Anthony van Diemen]], [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]]. Proceeding south he skirted the southern end of Tasmania and turned north-east, Tasman then tried to work his two ships into [[Adventure Bay]] on the east coast of [[South Bruny Island]] where he was blown out to sea by a storm, this area he named [[Storm Bay]]. Two days later Tasman anchored to the North of Cape Frederick Hendrick just North of the [[Forestier Peninsula]].  Tasman then landed in Blackman Bay – in the larger [[Marion Bay, Tasmania|Marion Bay]]. The next day, an attempt was made to land in North Bay; however, because the sea was too rough the carpenter swam through the surf and planted the Dutch flag in North Bay. Tasman then claimed formal possession of the land on 3 December 1642.

=== New Zealand ===
After some exploration, Tasman had intended to proceed in a northerly direction but as the wind was unfavourable he steered east. On 13 December they sighted land on the north-west coast of the [[South Island]], New Zealand, becoming the first Europeans to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/european-discovery-of-new-zealand/2 | title=European discovery of New Zealand | publisher=Encyclopedia of New Zealand | date=4 March 2009 | accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tasman named it ''Staten Landt'' on the assumption that it was connected to an island ([[Staten Island, Argentina]]) at the south of the tip of [[South America]]. Proceeding north and then east, he stopped to gather water, but one of his boats was attacked by [[Māori people|Māori]] in [[waka (canoe)|waka]] (canoes) and four of his men and several Māori&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploration and settlement. The early voyages of discovery.| work=Anthony G. Flude | url=http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~tonyf/explore/explore.html | accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; were killed. Archeological research has shown the Dutch had tried to land at a major agricultural area, which the Māori may have been trying to protect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10675488 |title=First contact violence linked to food |newspaper=New Zealand Herald |date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tasman named the bay ''Murderers' Bay'' (now known as [[Golden Bay]]) and sailed north, but mistook [[Cook Strait]] for a [[bight (geography)|bight]] (naming it ''[[Zeehaen's Bight]]''). Two names he gave to New Zealand landmarks still endure, [[Cape Maria van Diemen]] and [[Three Kings Islands]], but  ''Cabo Pieter Boreels'' is now known as [[Cape Egmont]].

=== The return voyage ===
On route back to Batavia, Tasman came across the [[Tonga]]n archipelago on 20 January 1643. While passing the [[Fiji Islands]] Tasman's ships came close to being wrecked on the dangerous reefs of the north-eastern part of the Fiji group. He charted the eastern tip of [[Vanua Levu]] and [[Cikobia]] before making his way back into the open sea. He eventually turned north-west to [[New Guinea]], and arrived at Batavia on 15 June 1643.

== Second Pacific voyage ==

With three ships on his second voyage (''Limmen'', ''Zeemeeuw'' and the tender ''Braek'') in 1644, he followed the south coast of New Guinea eastwards. He missed the [[Torres Strait]] between New Guinea and Australia, and continued his voyage along the Australian coast. He mapped the north coast of Australia making observations on the land, called [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]], and its people.

From the point of view of the Dutch East India Company Tasman's explorations were a disappointment: he had neither found a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route. For over a century, until the era of [[James Cook]], Tasmania and New Zealand were not visited by Europeans – mainland Australia was visited, but usually only by accident.

== Later life ==

On 2 November 1644 Abel Tasman was appointed a member of the Council of Justice at Batavia. He went to Sumatra in 1646, and in August 1647 to Siam (now [[Thailand]]) with letters from the company to the King. In May 1648 he was in charge of an expedition sent to [[Manila]] to try to intercept and loot the Spanish silver ships coming from America, but he had no success and returned to Batavia in January 1649. In November 1649 he was charged and found guilty of having in the previous year hanged one of his men without trial, was suspended from his office of commander, fined, and made to pay compensation to the relatives of the sailor. On 5 January 1651 he was formally reinstated in his rank and spent his remaining years at Batavia. He was in good circumstances, being one of the larger landowners in the town. He died at Batavia in October 1659 and was survived by his second wife and a daughter by his first wife. The poor in [[Lutjegast]] received the small amount of only 25 guilders.&lt;ref&gt;

==Tasman's legacy==
As with many explorers, Tasman's name has been honoured in many ways. These include:
*the Australian island Tasmania, renamed after him, formerly Van Diemen's land. It includes features such as:
**the [[Tasman Peninsula]]
**the [[Tasman Bridge]]
**the [[Tasman Highway]]
**the passenger/vehicle ferry [[Abel Tasman (ship)|''Abel Tasman'']]
**and, indirectly, two [[marsupial]] species are named after Tasman:
*** the [[Tasmanian Devil]]
*** the [[Thylacine|Tasmanian Tiger]]
* a [[plant]] genus
** [[Tasmannia]]
*the [[Tasman Sea]]
*in New Zealand:
**the [[Tasman Glacier]]
**[[Tasman Lake]]
**the [[Tasman River]]
**[[Mount Tasman]]
**the [[Abel Tasman National Park]]
**[[Tasman Bay]]
**the [[Tasman, New Zealand|Tasman District]]
**[[Abel Tasman Drive]], in [[Takaka]].
**the [[Able Tasman Memorial]] in Takaka.
*The [[Able Tasmans]] – an [[indie band]] from Auckland, New Zealand.
*
In 1985 he was honoured on a [[postage stamp]] depicting his portrait issued by [[Australia Post]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0015370.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Algebraic geometry''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] which combines techniques of [[abstract algebra]], especially [[commutative algebra]], with the language and the problems of [[geometry]]. It occupies a central place in modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as [[complex analysis]], [[topology]] and [[number theory]]. Initially a study of [[systems of polynomial equations]] in several variables, the subject of algebraic geometry starts where [[equation solving]] leaves off, and it becomes even more important to understand the intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of a system of equations, than to find some solution; this leads into some of the deepest waters in the whole of mathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.

The fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are [[algebraic variety|'''algebraic varieties''']], geometric manifestations of [[solution set|solutions]] of [[systems of polynomial equations]]. [[Plane algebraic curve]]s, which include [[line (geometry)|lines]], [[circle]]s, [[parabola]]s, [[lemniscate]]s, and [[Cassini oval]]s, form one of the best studied classes of algebraic varieties. A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation. Basic questions involve relative position of different curves and relations between the curves given by different equations.

[[Descartes]]'s idea of [[coordinates]] is central to algebraic geometry, but it has undergone a series of remarkable transformations beginning in the early 19th century. Before then, the coordinates were assumed to be [[tuple]]s of [[real number]]s, but this changed when first [[complex number]]s, and then elements of an arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|field]] became acceptable. [[Homogeneous coordinates]] of [[projective geometry]] offered an extension of the notion of coordinate system in a different direction, and enriched the scope of algebraic geometry. Much of the development of algebraic geometry in the 20th century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework, with increasing emphasis being placed on 'intrinsic' properties of algebraic varieties not dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient coordinate space; this parallels developments in [[topology]] and [[complex geometry]].

One key distinction between classical projective geometry of 19th century and modern algebraic geometry, in the form given to it by [[Grothendieck]] and [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]], is that the former is concerned with the more geometric notion of a point, while the latter emphasizes the more analytic concepts of a [[regular function]] and a [[Regular map (algebraic geometry)|regular map]] and extensively draws on [[sheaf theory]]. Another important difference lies in the scope of the subject. Grothendieck's idea of [[scheme (mathematics)|'''scheme''']] provides the language and the tools for geometric treatment
of arbitrary [[commutative ring]]s and, in particular, bridges algebraic geometry with [[algebraic number theory]]. [[Andrew Wiles]]'s celebrated [[Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem|proof]] of [[Fermat's last theorem]] is a vivid testament to the power of this approach. [[André Weil]], Grothendieck, and [[Pierre Deligne|Deligne]] also [[Weil cohomology theory|demonstrated]] that the fundamental ideas of topology of [[smooth manifold|manifolds]] have deep analogues in algebraic geometry over [[finite field]]s.

== Zeros of simultaneous polynomials ==
[[Image:Slanted circle.png|thumb|200px|right|Sphere and slanted circle]]
In classical algebraic geometry, the main objects of interest are the vanishing sets of collections of [[polynomial]]s, meaning the set of all points that simultaneously satisfy one or more [[systems of polynomial equations|polynomial equations]].  For instance, the two-dimensional [[sphere]] in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; could be defined as the set of all points (''x'',''y'',''z'') with

:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2+z^2-1=0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

A &quot;slanted&quot; circle in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; can be defined as the set of all  points (''x'',''y'',''z'') which satisfy the two polynomial equations

:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2+z^2-1=0,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x+y+z=0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

== Affine varieties ==
First we start with a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k''.  In classical algebraic geometry, this field was always the complex numbers '''C''', but many of the same results are true if we assume only that ''k'' is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]].  We define '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(''k'') (or more simply '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, when ''k'' is clear from the context), called the '''affine n-space over k''', to be ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  The purpose of this apparently superfluous notation is to emphasize that one 'forgets' the vector space structure that ''k''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; carries.  Abstractly speaking, '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is, for the moment, just a collection of points.

A function ''f'' : '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is said to be '''regular''' if it can be written as a polynomial, that is, if there is a polynomial ''p'' in ''k''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] such that ''f''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''p''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) for every point (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) of '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

Regular functions on affine ''n''-space are thus exactly the same as polynomials over ''k'' in ''n'' variables.  We will refer to the set of all regular functions on '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; as ''k''['''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;].

We say that a polynomial ''vanishes'' at a point if evaluating it at that point gives zero.  Let ''S'' be a set of polynomials in ''k''['''A'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;].  The ''vanishing set of S'' (or ''vanishing locus'') is the set ''V''(''S'') of all points in '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; where every polynomial in ''S'' vanishes.  In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;V(S) = \{(t_1,\dots,t_n)|\forall p\in S, p(t_1,\dots,t_n) = 0\}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

A subset of '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; which is ''V''(''S''), for some ''S'', is called an '''algebraic set'''.  The ''V'' stands for ''variety'' (a specific type of algebraic set to be defined below).

Given a subset ''U'' of '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, can one recover the set of polynomials which generate it? If ''U'' is ''any'' subset of '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, define ''I''(''U'') to be the set of all polynomials whose vanishing set contains ''U''.  The ''I'' stands for [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]: if two polynomials ''f'' and ''g'' both vanish on ''U'', then ''f''+''g'' vanishes on ''U'', and if ''h'' is any polynomial, then ''hf'' vanishes on ''U'', so ''I''(''U'') is always an ideal of ''k''['''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;].

Two natural questions to ask are:
* Given a subset ''U'' of '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, when is ''U'' = ''V''(''I''(''U''))?
* Given a set ''S'' of polynomials, when is ''S'' = ''I''(''V''(''S''))?

The answer to the first question is provided by introducing the [[Zariski topology]], a topology on '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; which directly reflects the algebraic structure of ''k''['''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;]. Then ''U'' = ''V''(''I''(''U'')) if and only if ''U'' is a Zariski-closed set.  The answer to the second question is given by [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]].  In one of its forms, it says that ''I''(''V''(''S'')) is the [[prime radical]] of the ideal generated by ''S''. In more abstract language, there is a [[Galois connection]], giving rise to two [[closure operator]]s; they can be identified, and naturally play a basic role in the theory; the [[Galois connection#Examples|example]] is elaborated at Galois connection.

For various reasons we may not always want to work with the entire ideal corresponding to an algebraic set ''U''.  [[Hilbert's basis theorem]] implies that ideals in ''k''['''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;] are always finitely generated.

An algebraic set is called '''[[irreducible component|irreducible]]''' if it cannot be written as the union of two smaller algebraic sets. An irreducible algebraic set is also called a '''[[algebraic variety|variety]]'''.  It turns out that an algebraic set is a variety if and only if the polynomials defining it generate a [[prime ideal]] of the polynomial ring.

== Regular functions ==
Just as [[continuous function]]s are the natural maps on [[topological space]]s and [[smooth function]]s are the natural maps on [[differentiable manifold]]s, there is a natural class of functions on an algebraic set, called regular functions.  A '''regular function''' on an algebraic set ''V'' contained in '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; is defined to be the restriction of a regular function on '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, in the sense we defined above.

It may seem unnaturally restrictive to require that a regular function always extend to the ambient space, but it is very similar to the situation in a [[normal space|normal]] [[topological space]], where the [[Tietze extension theorem]] guarantees that a continuous function on a closed subset always extends to the ambient topological space.

Just as with the regular functions on [[affine space]], the regular functions on ''V'' form a ring, which we denote by ''k''[''V''].  This ring is called the '''coordinate ring of ''V'''''.

Since regular functions on V come from regular functions on '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, there should be a relationship between their coordinate rings. Specifically, to get a function in ''k''[''V''] we took a function in ''k''['''A'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;], and we said that it was the same as another function if they gave the same values when evaluated on ''V''.  This is the same as saying that their difference is zero on V.  From this we can see that ''k''[''V''] is the quotient ''k''['''A'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;]/I(''V'').

== The category of affine varieties ==
Using regular functions from an affine variety to '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, we can define regular functions from one affine variety to another.  First we will define a regular function from a variety into affine space: Let ''V'' be a variety contained in '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.  Choose ''m'' regular functions on ''V'', and call them ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;.  We define a '''regular function''' ''f'' from ''V'' to '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; by letting ''f''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;).  In other words, each ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; determines one coordinate of the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of ''f''.

If ''V''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; is a variety contained in '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;, we say that ''f'' is a '''regular function''' from ''V'' to ''V''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; if the range of ''f'' is contained in ''V''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

This makes the collection of all affine varieties into a [[category theory|category]], where the objects are affine varieties and the [[morphism]]s are regular maps.  The following theorem characterizes the category of affine varieties:

: The category of affine varieties is the [[dual (category theory)|opposite category]] to the category of finitely generated [[integral domain|integral]] ''k''-[[algebra over a field|algebras]] and their homomorphisms.

== Projective space ==
{{Main|Algebraic geometry of projective spaces}}

[[Image:Parabola &amp; cubic curve in projective space.png|thumb|300px|parabola (''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, red) and cubic (''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, blue) in projective space]]
Consider the variety ''V''(''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  If we draw it, we get a [[parabola]].  As ''x'' increases, the slope of the line from the origin to the point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) becomes larger and larger.  As ''x'' decreases, the slope of the same line becomes smaller and smaller.

Compare this to the variety ''V''(''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).  This is a [[cubic equation]].  As ''x'' increases, the slope of the line from the origin to the point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) becomes larger and larger just as before.  But unlike before, as ''x'' decreases, the slope of the same line again becomes larger and larger.  So the behavior &quot;at infinity&quot; of ''V''(''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) is different from the behavior &quot;at infinity&quot; of ''V''(''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  It is, however, difficult to make the concept of &quot;at infinity&quot; meaningful, if we restrict to working in affine space.

The remedy to this is to work in [[projective space]].  Projective space has properties analogous to those of a [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]]. Among other things, it lets us make precise the notion of &quot;at infinity&quot; by including extra points.  The behavior of a variety at those extra points then gives us more information about it.  As it turns out, ''V''(''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) has a [[mathematical singularity|singularity]] at one of those extra points, but ''V''(''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is smooth.

While [[projective geometry]] was originally established on a [[synthetic geometry|synthetic]] foundation, the use of [[homogeneous coordinates]] allowed the introduction of algebraic techniques.  Furthermore, the introduction of projective techniques made many theorems in algebraic geometry simpler and sharper: For example, [[Bézout's theorem]] on the number of intersection points between two varieties can be stated in its sharpest form only in projective space.  For this reason, projective space plays a fundamental role in algebraic geometry.

== The modern viewpoint ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
The modern approaches to algebraic geometry redefine and effectively extend the range of basic objects in various levels of generality to schemes, [[formal scheme]]s, [[ind-scheme]]s, [[algebraic space]]s, [[algebraic stack]]s and so on. The need for this arises already from the useful ideas within theory of varieties, e.g. the formal f
