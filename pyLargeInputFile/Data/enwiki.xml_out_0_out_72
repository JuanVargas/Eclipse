====Crocodyliforms====

Ten families of crocodilians or their close relatives are represented in the Maastrichtian fossil records, of which five died out prior to the K–T boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Calibration age and quartet divergence date estimation |author=Brochu CA |year=2004 |journal=Evolution |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=1375–1382 |doi=10.1554/03-509 |pmid=15266985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Five families have both Maastrichtian and Paleocene fossil representatives.  All of the surviving families of crocodyliforms inhabited freshwater and terrestrial environments, except for the [[Dyrosauridae]] which lived in freshwater and marine locations. Approximately 50% of crocodyliform representatives survived across the K–T boundary, the only apparent trend being that no large crocodiles survived.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;  Crocodyliform survivability across the boundary may have resulted from their aquatic niche and ability to burrow, which reduced susceptibility to negative environmental effects at the boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robertson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title= Survival in the first hours of the Cenozoic |author=Robertson DS, McKenna MC, Toon OB, Hope S, Lillegraven JA |journal=GSA Bulletin |year=2004 |volume=116 |issue=5–6 |pages=760–768 |doi=10.1130/B25402.1 |url=http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~presto/cenozoic.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2007-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jouve and colleagues suggested in 2008 that juvenile marine crocodyliforms lived in freshwater environments like modern marine crocodile juveniles, which would have helped them survive where other marine reptiles became extinct; freshwater environments were not as strongly affected by the K–T event as marine environments.&lt;ref name=SJetal08&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jouve S, Bardet, N, Jalil N-E, Suberbiola XP, Bouya B, Amaghzaz M|year=2008 |title=The oldest African crocodylian: phylogeny, paleobiogeography, and differential survivorship of marine reptiles through the Cretaceous-Tertiary Boundary |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=409–421 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2008)28[409:TOACPP]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pterosaurs====

Only one family of pterosaurs, [[Azhdarchidae]], was definitely present in the Maastrichtian, and it became extinct at the K–T boundary.  These large pterosaurs were the last representatives of a declining group that contained 10 families during the mid-Cretaceous. Smaller pterosaurs became extinct prior to the Maastrichtian during a period that saw a decline in smaller animal species while larger species became more prevalent. While this was occurring, [[modern birds]] were undergoing diversification and replacing archaic birds and pterosaur groups, possibly due to direct competition, or they simply filled empty niches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robertson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Slack KE, Jones CM, Ando T, Harrison GL, Fordyce RE, Arnason U, Penny D |year=2006 |title=Early Penguin Fossils, Plus Mitochondrial Genomes, Calibrate Avian Evolution |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=23 |pages=1144–1155 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/23/6/1144

====Avian dinosaurs (birds)====

Most paleontologists regard birds as the only surviving dinosaurs (see [[Origin of birds]]).  However, all non-[[neornithes|neornithean]] birds became extinct, including flourishing groups like [[enantiornithes|enantiornithines]] and [[hesperornithes|hesperornithiforms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hou L, Martin M, Zhou Z, Feduccia A |year=1996 |title=Early Adaptive Radiation of Birds: Evidence from Fossils from Northeastern China |journal=Science |volume=274 |issue=5290 |pages=1164–1167 |doi=10.1126/science.274.5290.1164 |pmid=8895459 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several analyses of bird fossils show divergence of species prior to the K–T boundary, and that duck, chicken and [[ratite]] bird relatives coexisted with non-avian dinosaurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Definitive fossil evidence for the extant avian radiation in the Cretaceous |author=Clarke JA, Tambussi CP, Noriega JI, Erickson GM, Ketcham RA |year=2005 |journal=Nature |volume=433 |issue=7023 |pages=305–308 |doi=10.1038/nature03150 |pmid=15662422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neornithine birds survived the K–T boundary as a result of their abilities to dive, swim, or seek shelter in water and marshlands.  Many species of birds can build burrows, or nest in tree holes or termite nests, all of which provided shelter from the environmental effects at the K–T boundary.  Long-term survival past the boundary was assured as a result of filling ecological niches left empty by extinction of non-avian dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robertson&quot;/&gt;

====Non-avian dinosaurs====
[[Image:Tyrannosaurus BW.jpg|thumb|''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' was one of the last dinosaurs to thrive on Earth before the extinction.&lt;ref name=AF04/&gt;]]
Excluding a few controversial claims, scientists agree that all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct at the K–T boundary. The dinosaur fossil record has been interpreted to show both a decline in diversity and no decline in diversity during the last few million years of the Cretaceous, and it may be that the quality of the dinosaur fossil record is simply not good enough to permit researchers to distinguish between the options.&lt;ref name=AF04&gt;{{cite book |first=Archibald|last=David|coauthors=David Fastovsky|editor=Weishampel David B, Dodson Peter, Osmólska Halszka (eds.) |title=The Dinosauria |edition=2nd |year=2004 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0-520-24209-2 |pages=672–684 |chapter=Dinosaur Extinction |chapterurl=http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/faculty/archibald/ArchFast.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since there is no evidence that late Maastrichtian nonavian dinosaurs could burrow, swim or dive, they were unable to shelter themselves from the worst parts of any environmental stress that occurred at the K–T boundary. It is possible that small dinosaurs (other than birds) did survive, but they would have been deprived of food as both herbivorous dinosaurs would have found plant material scarce, and carnivores would have quickly found prey to be in short supply.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robertson&quot;/&gt;
The growing consensus about the endothermy of dinosaurs (see [[physiology of dinosaurs|dinosaur physiology]]) helps to understand their full extinction in contrast with their close relatives, the [[crocodilians]]. Ectothermic (&quot;cold-blooded&quot;) crocodiles have very limited needs for food (they can survive several months without eating) while endothermic (&quot;warm-blooded&quot;) animals of similar size need much more food in order to sustain their faster metabolism. Thus, under the circumstances of food chain disruption previously mentioned, non-avian dinosaurs died&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated347&quot;/&gt;
while some crocodiles survived. In this context, the survival of other endothermic animals, such as some birds and mammals, could be due, among other reasons, to their smaller needs for food, related to their small size at the extinction epoch.&lt;ref name=&quot;springerlink.com&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Ocampo|first=A|coauthors=Vajda V, Buffetaut E |title=Unravelling the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–T) turnover, evidence from flora, fauna and geology in biological processes associated with impact events (Cockell C, Gilmour I, Koeberl C, editors) |publisher=SpringerLink |year=2006 |pages=197–219 |isbn=978-3-540-25735-6|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/vw75014157p2p278/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the extinction occurred gradually or very suddenly is debatable, as both views have support in the fossil record. A study of 29&amp;nbsp;fossil sites in Catalan [[Pyrenees]] of Europe in 2010 support that dinosaurs there had great diversity until the proposed asteroid impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Several researchers have argued for [[Paleocene dinosaurs]]. These arguments are based on the discovery of dinosaur remains in the [[Hell Creek]] Formation up to {{convert|1.3|m|ftin}} above and 40,000 years later than the K–T boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sloan&quot;/&gt; Pollen samples recovered near a fossilized [[hadrosaur]] [[femur]] recovered in the Ojo Alamo Sandstone at the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]] indicate that the animal lived during the Tertiary, approximately 64.5&amp;nbsp;Ma (about 1&amp;nbsp;million years after the K–T event). If their existence past the K–T boundary can be confirmed, these hadrosaurids would be considered a [[Dead Clade Walking]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fassett&quot;/&gt; Current research indicates that these fossils were eroded from their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments (reworked).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sullivan&quot;/&gt;

===Mammals===

All major Cretaceous [[mammal]]ian lineages, including [[monotreme]]s (egg-laying mammals), [[multituberculata|multituberculates]], [[marsupial]]s and [[Eutheria|placentals]], [[dryolestoidea]]ns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gelfo JN and Pascual R|year=2001|title=''Peligrotherium tropicalis'' (Mammalia, Dryolestida) from the early Paleocene of Patagonia, a survival from a Mesozoic Gondwanan radiation|journal=Geodiversitas|volume=23|pages=369–379}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gondwanatheria|gondwanatheres]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Goin FJ, Reguero MA, Pascual R, von Koenigswald W, Woodburne MO, Case JA, Marenssi SA, Vieytes C, Vizcaíno SF|year=2006|title=First gondwanatherian mammal from Antarctica|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|volume=258|pages=135–144|doi=10.1144/GSL.SP.2006.258.01.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; survived the K–T event, although they suffered losses.  In particular, marsupials largely disappeared from North America, and the Asian [[deltatheroida]]ns, primitive relatives of extant marsupials, became extinct.&lt;ref name=classofmamm&gt;{{cite book|last=McKenna|first= MC|coauthors=Bell SK|title=Classification of Mammals: Above the Species Level|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-231-11012-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Only peradectids and herpetotheriids remained (and ''Esteslestes'', affinities unclear); stagodontids, pediomyoids and some other stuff became extinct. There are 17 Late Cretaceous (more have since been described) and 3 Paleocene North American marsupials in McKenna and Bell--&gt; In the Hell Creek beds of North America, at least half of the ten known multituberculate species and all eleven marsupial species are not found above the boundary.&lt;ref name=AF04/&gt;

Mammalian species began diversifying approximately 30&amp;nbsp;million years prior to the K–T boundary.  Diversification of mammals stalled across the boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bininda-Emonds&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The delayed rise of present-day mammals|author=Bininda-Emonds ORP, Cardillo M, Jones KE, MacPhee RDE, Beck RMD, Grenyer R, Price SA, Vos RA, Gittleman JLY, Purvis A |journal=Nature |volume=446 |pages=507–512 |year=2007 |doi=10.1038/nature05634 |url=http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/molekularesystematik/download/Publications/mammalST.pdf|format=PDF |pmid=17392779 |issue=7135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Current research indicates that mammals did not explosively diversify across the K–T boundary, despite the environment niches made available by the extinction of dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Springer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Placental mammal diversification and the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/100/3/1056.pdf |format=PDF |year=2003 |author=Springer MS, Murphy WJ, Eizirik E, O'Brien SJ |journal=PNAS |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=1056–1061 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0334222100 |pmid=12552136 |pmc=298725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several mammalian orders have been interpreted as diversifying immediately after the K–T boundary, including [[Chiroptera]] (bats) and [[Cetartiodactyla]] (a diverse group that today includes [[cetaceans|whales and dolphins]] and [[even-toed ungulate]]s),&lt;ref name=&quot;Springer&quot;/&gt; although recent research concludes that only [[marsupial]] orders diversified after the K–T boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bininda-Emonds&quot;/&gt;

K–T boundary mammalian species were generally small, comparable in size to [[rat]]s; this small size would have helped them to find shelter in protected environments.  In addition, it is postulated that some early monotremes, marsupials, and placentals were semiaquatic or burrowing, as there are multiple mammalian lineages with such habits today. Any burrowing or semiaquatic mammal would have had additional protection from K–T boundary environmental stresses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robertson&quot;/&gt;

==Evidence==
===North American fossils===

In North American terrestrial sequences, the extinction event is best represented by the marked discrepancy between the rich and relatively abundant late-Maastrichtian [[palynomorph]] record and the post-boundary fern spike.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vajdaetal&quot;/&gt;

At present the most informative sequence of dinosaur-bearing rocks in the world from the K–T boundary is found in western North America, particularly the late [[Maastrichtian]]-age [[Hell Creek Formation]] of Montana, US. This formation, when compared with the older (approximately 75&amp;nbsp;Ma) [[Judith River Formation|Judith River]]/[[Dinosaur Park Formation]]s (from Montana and Alberta, Canada, respectively) provides information on the changes in dinosaur populations over the last 10&amp;nbsp;million years of the Cretaceous.  These fossil beds are geographically limited, covering only part of one continent.&lt;ref name=AF04/&gt;

The middle–late Campanian formations show a greater diversity of dinosaurs than any other single group of rocks. The late Maastrichtian rocks contain the largest members of several major clades: ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'', ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'', ''[[Triceratops]]'' and ''[[Torosaurus]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodson&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Dodson|first= Peter| authorlink =Peter Dodson | title = The Horned Dinosaurs: A Natural History| publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1996| location = Princeton | pages = 279–281| isbn = 0-691-05900-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which suggests food was plentiful immediately prior to the extinction.

In addition to rich dinosaur fossils, there are also plant fossils that illustrate the reduction in plant species across the K–T boundary.  In the sediments below the K–T boundary the dominant plant remains are [[angiosperm]] pollen grains, but the actual boundary layer contains little pollen and is dominated by fern spores.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =Online guide to the continental Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary in the Raton basin, Colorado and New Mexico | publisher =U.S. Geological Survey | year=2004| url=http://esp.cr.usgs.gov/info/kt/stop2b.html | doi = | accessdate =2007-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normal pollen levels gradually resume above the boundary layer. This is reminiscent of areas blighted by modern volcanic eruptions, where the recovery is led by ferns which are later replaced by larger angiosperm plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smathers|first=GA|coauthors=Mueller-Dombois D |year=1974 |title=Invasion and Recovery of Vegetation after a Volcanic Eruption in Hawaii, Scientific Monograph Number 5 |publisher=United States National Park Service |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/science/5/contents.htm |accessdate=2007-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine fossils===
The mass extinction of marine plankton appears to have been abrupt and right at the K–T boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pope&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pope KO, D'Hondt SL, Marshall CR |year=1998 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/95/19/11028 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.19.11028 |title=Meteorite impact and the mass extinction of species at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary |journal=PNAS |volume=95 |issue=19 |pages=11028–11029 |pmid=9736679 |pmc=33889}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ammonite]] genera became extinct at or near the K–T boundary; however, there was a smaller and slower extinction of ammonite genera prior to the boundary that was associated with a late Cretaceous marine regression. The gradual extinction of most inoceramid bivalves began well before the K–T boundary, and a small, gradual reduction in ammonite diversity occurred throughout the very late Cretaceous.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marshall CR, Ward PD |year=1996 |title=Sudden and Gradual Molluscan Extinctions in the Latest Cretaceous of Western European Tethys |journal=Science |volume=274 |issue=5291 |pages=1360–1363 |doi=10.1126/science.274.5291.1360 |pmid=8910273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis shows that several processes were in progress in the late Cretaceous seas and partially overlapped in time, then ended with the abrupt mass extinction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall&quot;/&gt;

==Duration==

The length of time taken for the extinction to occur is a controversial issue, because some theories about the extinction's causes require a rapid extinction over a relatively short period (from a few years to a few thousand years) while others require longer periods. The issue is difficult to resolve because of the [[Signor-Lipps effect]]; that is, the fossil record is so incomplete that most extinct species probably died out long after the most recent fossil that has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Signor III PW, Lipps JH|year=1982 |title=Sampling bias, gradual extinction patterns, and catastrophes in the fossil record.  In: Geological implications of impacts of large asteroids and comets on the Earth, Silver LT, Schultz PH (editors)|journal=Geological Society of America Special Publication |volume=190 |pages=291–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists have also found very few continuous beds of fossil-bearing rock which cover a time range from several million years before the K–T extinction to a few million years after it.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;

==Causes of extinctions==

There have been several theories on the cause of the K–T boundary which led to the massive extinction.  These theories have centered on either impact events or increased volcanism; some include elements of both.

===Impact event===

[[Image:Chicxulub radar topography.jpg|thumb|Radar topography reveals the {{convert|180|km|abbr=on}} wide ring of the [[Chicxulub Crater]].]]

In 1980, a team of researchers consisting of [[Nobel prize]]-winning physicist [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], his son geologist [[Walter Alvarez]], and chemists [[Frank Asaro]] and Helen Michel discovered that [[sedimentary]] layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary contain a [[concentration]] of [[iridium]] many times greater than normal (30 times and 130 times background in the two sections originally studied). Iridium is extremely rare in the [[crust (geology)|earth's crust]] because it is a [[Goldschmidt classification#Siderophile_elements|siderophile element]], and therefore most of it travelled with the [[iron]] as it sank into the [[Structure of the Earth#Core|earth's core]] during [[planetary differentiation]]. As iridium remains abundant in most asteroids and comets, the Alvarez team suggested that an [[asteroid]] struck the earth at the time of the K–T boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alvarez&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction |author=Alvarez LW, Alvarez W, Asaro F, Michel HV |year=1980 |journal=Science |volume=208 |issue=4448 |pages=1095–1108 |doi=10.1126/science.208.4448.1095 |pmid=17783054}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were other earlier speculations on the possibility of an [[impact event]], but this was the first evidence uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=De Laubenfels MW |title=Dinosaur extinction: One more hypothesis |journal=Journal of Paleontology |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=207–218 |year=1956 |url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/1300393 |publisher=Journal of Paleontology, Vol. 30, No. 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such an impact would have inhibited photosynthesis by generating a dust cloud, which would block sunlight for a year or less, and by injecting [[sulfuric acid]] [[aerosol]]s into the [[stratosphere]], which would reduce sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by 10–20%. It would take at least ten years for those aerosols to dissipate, which would account for the extinction of [[plant]]s and [[phytoplankton]], and of [[organisms]] dependent on them (including [[predator|predatory animals]] as well as [[herbivores]]). Small creatures whose food chains were based on [[detritus]] would have a reasonable chance of survival.&lt;ref name=&quot;springerlink.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pope&quot;/&gt; The consequences of reentry of ejecta into Earth's atmosphere would include a brief (hours long) but intense pulse of [[infrared|infrared radiation]], killing exposed organisms.&lt;ref name=Robertson/&gt; Global [[firestorm]]s may have resulted from the heat pulse and the fall back to Earth of incendiary fragments from the blast. High {{chem|O|2}} levels during the late Cretaceous would have supported intense combustion. The level of atmospheric {{chem|O|2}} plummeted in the early Tertiary Period. If widespread fires occurred, they would have increased the {{chem|CO|2}} content of the atmosphere and caused a temporary [[greenhouse effect]] once the dust cloud settled, and this would have exterminated the most vulnerable organisms that survived the period immediately after the impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Energy, volatile production, and climatic effects of the Chicxulub Cretaceous/Tertiary impact |author=Pope KO, Baines KH, Ocampo AC, Ivanov BA |year=1997 |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=102 |issue=E9 |pages=21645–21664 |url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1997/97JE01743.shtml |doi=10.1029/97JE01743|pmid=11541145 |bibcode=1997JGR...10221645P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact may also have produced [[acid rain]], depending on what type of rock the asteroid struck. However, recent research suggests this effect was relatively minor, lasting for approximately 12&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pope&quot;/&gt; The acidity was [[Buffer solution|neutralized]] by the environment, and the survival of animals vulnerable to acid rain effects (such as [[frog]]s) indicate this was not a major contributor to extinction. Impact theories can only explain very rapid extinctions, since the dust clouds and possible sulfuric aerosols would wash out of the atmosphere in a fairly short time—possibly under ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kring DA |year=2003 |title=Environmental consequences of impact cratering events as a function of ambient conditions on Earth |journal=Astrobiology |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=133–152 |pmid=12809133 |doi=10.1089/153110703321632471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent research identified the Chicxulub Crater buried under [[Chicxulub, Yucatán|Chicxulub]] on the coast of [[Yucatán]], Mexico as the impact crater which matched the Alvarez hypothesis dating. Identified in 1990 based on the work of Glen Penfield done in 1978, this crater is oval, with an average diameter of about {{convert|180|km}}, about the size calculated by the Alvarez team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Pope KO, Ocampo AC, Kinsland GL, Smith R | title=Surface expression of the Chicxulub crater | journal=[[Geology (journal)| ]] | volume=24 | issue=6 | year=1996 | pages=527–530 | pmid=11539331 | doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;0527:SEOTCC&gt;2.3.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape and location of the crater indicate further causes of devastation in addition to the dust cloud. The asteroid landed in the ocean and would have caused [[megatsunami]]s, for which evidence has been found in several locations in the Caribbean and eastern United States—marine sand in locations which were then inland, and vegetation debris and terrestrial rocks in marine sediments dated to the time of the impact. The asteroid landed in a bed of [[gypsum]] (calcium sulfate), which would have produced a vast sulfur dioxide [[aerosol]]. This would have further reduced the sunlight reaching the Earth's surface and then precipitated as acid rain, killing vegetation, plankton and organisms which build shells from calcium carbonate ([[coccolithophore]]s and [[mollusca|molluscs]]). In February 2008, a team of researchers used seismic images of the crater to determine that the impactor landed in deeper water than was previously assumed. They argued that this would have resulted in increased sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, which could have made the impact deadlier by altering climate and by generating acid rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Importance of pre-impact crustal structure for the asymmetry of the Chicxulub impact crater|author=Gulick|journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=1 |pages=131–135 |date=13 January 2008 | doi=10.1038/ngeo103|laysummary=http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/rels/011708.html|last2=Barton|first2=Penny J.|last3=Christeson|first3=Gail L.|last4=Morgan|first4=Joanna V.|last5=McDonald|first5=Matthew|last6=Mendoza-Cervantes|first6=Keren|last7=Pearson|first7=Zulmacristina F.|last8=Surendra|first8=Anusha|last9=Urrutia-Fucugauchi|first9=Jaime |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most paleontologists now agree that an asteroid did hit the Earth about 65&amp;nbsp;Ma ago, but there is an ongoing dispute whether the impact was the sole cause of the extinctions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keller&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Analyses of shocked quartz at the global K-P boundary indicate an origin from a single, high-angle, oblique impact at Chicxulub |author=Morgan J, Lana C, Kersley A, Coles B, Belcher C, Montanari S, Diaz-Martinez E, Barbosa A, Neumann V |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=251 |issue=3–4 |year=2006 |pages=264–279 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2006.09.009 |bibcode=2006E&amp;PSL.251..264M}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that there was an interval of about 300&amp;nbsp;[[kiloannum|ka]] from the impact to the mass extinction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keller_2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Keller G, Abramovich S, Berner Z, Adatte T| journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology| volume=271| issue=1–2| date=1 January 2009| pages=52–68| title=Biotic effects of the Chicxulub impact, K–T catastrophe and sea level change in Texas| doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, paleontologist [[Sankar Chatterjee]] drew attention to the proposed and much larger {{convert|600|km|abbr=on}} [[Shiva crater]] and the possibility of a multiple-impact scenario.

In 2007, a hypothesis was put forth that argued the impactor that killed the dinosaurs 65&amp;nbsp;Ma belonged to the [[Baptistina family]] of asteroids.&lt;ref name=bottke2007&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this finding may make the link between the Baptistina family and K–T impactor more difficult to substantiate, it does not preclude the possibility.&lt;ref name=reddy2008/&gt;

In March 2010 an international panel of scientists endorsed the asteroid hypothesis, specifically the Chicxulub impact, as being the cause of the extinction. A team of 41 scientists reviewed 20 years of scientific literature and in so doing also ruled out other theories such as massive volcanism. They had determined that a {{convert|10|–|15|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} space rock hurtled into earth at [[Chicxulub, Yucatán|Chicxulub]] on Mexico's [[Yucatan Peninsula]]. The collision would have released the same energy as {{convert|100|TtTNT|ZJ|abbr=off|disp=x| (|}} or over a billion times the energy of the bombs dropped on [[Nagasaki and Hiroshima]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Schulte10&quot;/&gt;

===Deccan Traps===

&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event]] --&gt;
{{Main|Deccan Traps}}

Before 2000, arguments that the [[Deccan Traps]] [[flood basalt]]s caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68&amp;nbsp;Ma and lasted for over 2&amp;nbsp;million years. The most recent evidence shows that the traps erupted over 800,000 years spanning the K–T boundary, and therefore may be responsible for the extinction and the delayed biotic recovery thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Keller G, Adatte T, Gardin S, Bartolini A, Bajpai S |title=Main Deccan volcanism phase ends near the K–T boundary: Evidence from the Krishna-Godavari Basin, SE India |year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2008.01.015  |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=268 |pages=293–311 |bibcode=2008E&amp;PSL.268..293K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deccan Traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulfuric aerosols into the air which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants.  In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions which would have increased the [[greenhouse effect]] when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rapid eruption of the Deccan flood basalts at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary |author=Duncan RA, Pyle DG |year=1988 |journal=Nature |volume=333 |pages=841–843 |doi=10.1038/333841a0 |issue=6176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years when the Deccan Traps hypothesis was linked to a slower extinction, Luis Alvarez (who died in 1988) replied that [[paleontologists]] were being misled by [[Signor-Lipps effect|sparse data]]. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in [[sea level]] and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alvarez|first= W |title=T. rex and the Crater of Doom |year=1997 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-01630-6 |pages=130–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple impact event===

Several other craters also appear to have been formed about the time of the K–T boundary. This suggests the possibility of near simultaneous multiple impacts, perhaps from a fragmented asteroidal object, similar to the [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9|Shoemaker-Levy 9]] cometary impact with [[Jupiter]]. In addition to the {{convert|180|km|abbr=on}} [[Chicxulub Crater]], there is the {{convert|24|km|mi}} [[Boltysh crater]] in [[Ukraine]] {{nowrap|(65.17 ± 0.64 Ma)}}, the {{convert|20|km|mi}} [[Silverpit crater]], a suspected impact crater in the [[North Sea]] {{nowrap|(60–65 Ma)}}, and the controversial and much larger {{convert|600|km|mi}} [[Shiva crater]]. Any other craters that might have formed in the [[Tethys Ocean]] would have been obscured by tectonic events like the relentless northward drift of Africa and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mullen L |date= October 13, 2004 |title= Debating the Dinosaur Extinction| url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1243.html |journal=Astrobiology Magazine |accessdate=2007-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mullen L| date= October 20, 2004 | title=Multiple impacts |url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1253.html |journal=Astrobiology Magazine |accessdate=2007-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mullen Shiva&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mullen L |date=November 3, 2004 |title=Shiva: Another K–T impact? |url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1281.html |journal=Astrobiology Magazine |accessdate=2007-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chatterjee 1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Chatterjee |first=Sankar |authorlink=Sankar Chatterjee |coauthors= |year=1997 |month=August |chapter=Multiple Impacts at the KT Boundary and the Death of the Dinosaurs |title= 30th International Geological Congress|volume= 26|issue= |pages=31–54 |id= |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/?id=3IORF1Ei3LIC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=Chatterjee+and+Rudra+1996+Shiva|accessdate= 2008-02-22 |quote= |isbn=978-90-6764-254-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maastrichtian sea-level regression===
There is clear evidence that sea levels fell in the final stage of the Cretaceous by more than at any other time in the [[Mesozoic]] era. In some [[Maastrichtian]] [[Faunal stage|stage]] rock layers from various parts of the world, the later ones are terrestrial; earlier ones represent shorelines and the earliest represent seabeds. These layers do not show the tilting and distortion associated with [[Orogeny|mountain building]], therefore, the likeliest explanation is a &quot;regression&quot;, that is, a drop in sea level. There is no direct evidence for the cause of the regression, but the explanation which is currently accepted as the most likely is that the [[plate tectonics|mid-ocean ridges]] became less active and therefore sank under their own weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Abrupt deep-sea warming at the end of the Cretaceous |journal=Geology |year=1998 |author=Liangquan L, Keller G |volume=26 |issue= |pages=995–998  |url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/11/995 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1998)026&lt;0995:ADSWAT&gt;2.3.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A severe regression would have greatly reduced the [[continental shelf]] area, which is the most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a ''marine'' mass extinction. However research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction.  The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's [[albedo]] and therefore increasing global temperatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall&quot;/&gt;

Marine regression also resulted in the loss of [[epeiric sea]]s, such as the [[Western Interior Seaway]] of North America.  The loss of these seas greatly altered habitats, removing [[coastal plain]]s that ten million years before had been host to diverse communities such as are found in rocks of the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]. Another consequence was an expansion of [[freshwater]] environments, since continental runoff now had longer distances to travel before reaching oceans. While this change was favorable to [[freshwater]] [[vertebrates]], those that prefer [[ocean|marine]] environments, such as [[shark]]s, suffered.&lt;ref name=AF04/&gt;

===Multiple causes===

In a review article, J. David Archibald and David E. Fastovsky discussed a scenario combining three major postulated causes: volcanism, [[marine regression]], and extraterrestrial impact. In this scenario, terrestrial and marine communities were stressed by the changes in and loss of habitats. Dinosaurs, as the largest vertebrates, were the first to be affected by environmental changes, and their diversity declined. At the same time, [[particulate]] materials from volcanism cooled and dried areas of the globe. Then, an impact event occurred, causing collapses in photosynthesis-based food chains, both in the already-stressed terrestrial food chains and in the marine food chains.  The major difference between this hypothesis and the single-cause hypotheses is that its proponents view the suggested single causes as either not sufficient in strength to cause the extinctions or not likely to produce the taxonomic pattern of the extinction.&lt;ref name=AF04/&gt;

'''Carlo Osvaldo Goldoni''' (25 February 1707 – 6 February 1793) was an [[Italians|Italian]] playwright and [[Libretto|librettist]] from the [[Republic of Venice]]. His works include some of Italy's most famous and best-loved plays. Audiences have admired the plays of Goldoni for their ingenious mix of wit and honesty. His plays offered his contemporaries images of themselves, often dramatizing the lives, values, and conflicts of the emerging [[middle class]]es. Though he wrote in French and Italian, his plays make rich use of the [[Venetian language]], regional vernacular, and colloquialisms. Goldoni also wrote under the [[pen name]] and title &quot;Polisseno Fegeio, Pastor Arcade,&quot; which he claimed in his memoirs the &quot;[[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadians]] of Rome&quot; bestowed on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Biography ==
=== Memoirs ===
There is an abundance of autobiographical information on Goldoni, most of which comes from the introductions to his plays and from his ''Memoirs''. However, these memoirs are known to contain many errors of fact, especially about his earlier years.

In these memoirs, he paints himself as a born comedian, careless, light-hearted and with a happy temperament, proof against all strokes of fate, yet thoroughly respectable and honorable. Such characters were common enough in Italy.

=== Early life and studies ===
Goldoni was born in [[Venice]] in 1707, the son of Margherita and Giulio Goldoni. In his memoirs, Goldoni describes his father as a [[physician]], and claims that he was introduced to theatre by his grandfather Carlo Alessandro Goldoni. In reality, it seems that Giulio was an [[apothecary]]; as for the grandfather, he had died four years before Carlo's birth. In any case, Goldoni was deeply interested in theatre from his earliest years, and all attempts to direct his activity into other channels were of no avail; his toys were puppets, and his books, plays.

His father placed him under the care of the philosopher Caldini at [[Rimini]] but the youth soon ran away with a company of strolling players and returned to Venice. In 1723 his father matriculated him into the stern [[Collegio Ghislieri]] in [[Pavia]], which imposed the [[tonsure]] and [[monk|monastic habits]] on its students. However, he relates in his ''Memoirs'' that a considerable part of his time was spent in reading Greek and [[Latin]] comedies. He had already begun writing at this time and, in his third year, he composed a [[libel]]lous poem (''Il colosso'') in which he ridiculed the daughters of certain Pavian families. As a result of that incident (and/or of a visit paid with some schoolmates to a local brothel) he was expelled from the school and had to leave the city (1725). He studied law at [[Udine]], and eventually took his degree at [[Modena]]. He was employed as a law clerk at [[Chioggia]] and [[Feltre]], after which he returned to his native city and began practicing.

Educated as a lawyer, and holding lucrative positions as secretary and counsellor, he seemed, indeed, at one time to have settled down to the practice of law, but following an unexpected summons to Venice, after an absence of several years, he changed his career, and thenceforth he devoted himself to writing plays and managing theatres. His father died in 1731. In 1732, to avoid an unwanted marriage, he left the town for [[Milan]] and then for [[Verona]] where the theatre manager Giuseppe Imer helped him on his way to becoming a comical poet as well as introducing him to his future wife, Nicoletta Conio. Goldoni returned with her to Venice, where he stayed until 1743.

=== Theatrical career ===
He entered the Italian theatre scene with a [[tragedy]], ''[[Amalasunta]]'', produced in Milan. The play was a critical and financial failure.

Submitting it to Count Prata, director of the opera, he was told that his piece &quot;was composed with due regard for the rules of [[Aristotle]] and [[Horace]], but not according to those laid down for the Italian drama.&quot; &quot;In France&quot;, continued the count, &quot;you can try to please the public, but here in Italy it is the actors and actresses whom you must consult, as well as the composer of the music and the stage decorators. Everything must be done according to a certain form which I will explain to you.&quot;

Goldoni thanked his critic, went back to his inn and ordered a fire, into which he threw the manuscript of his ''Amalasunta''.

His next play, ''Belisario'', written in 1734, was more successful, though of its success he afterward professed himself ashamed.

During this period he also wrote [[librettos]] for [[opera seria]] and served for a time as literary director of the [[Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo|San Giovanni Grisostomo]], Venice's most distinguished [[opera house]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cgt&quot;&gt;Banham (1998, 433).&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote other tragedies for a time, but he was not long in discovering that his bent was for [[comedy]]. He had come to realize that the Italian stage needed reforming; adopting [[Molière]] as his model, he went to work in earnest and in 1738 produced his first real comedy, ''L'uomo di mondo'' (&quot;The Man of the World&quot;). During his many wanderings and adventures in Italy, he was constantly at work and when, at [[Livorno]], he became acquainted with the manager Medebac, he determined to pursue the profession of playwriting in order to make a living. He was employed by Medebac to write plays for his theater in Venice. He worked for other managers and produced during his stay in that city some of his most characteristic works. He also wrote ''Momolo Cortesan'' in 1738. By 1743, he had perfected his hybrid style of playwriting (combining the model of [[Molière]] with the strengths of [[Commedia dell'arte]] and his own wit and sincerity). This style was typified in ''La Donna di garbo'', the first Italian comedy of its kind.

After 1748, Goldoni collaborated with the composer [[Baldassare Galuppi]], making significant contributions to the new form of '[[opera buffa]]'. Galuppi composed the score for more than twenty of Goldoni's librettos. As with his comedies, Goldoni's ''opera buffa'' integrate elements of the Commedia dell'arte with recognisable local and middle-class realities. His operatic works include two of the most successful musical comedies of the eighteenth century, ''Il filosofo di campagna'' (''The Country Philosopher''), set by Galuppi (1752) and ''[[La buona figliuola]]'' (''The Good Girl''), set by [[Niccolò Piccinni]] (1760).&lt;ref name=&quot;cgt&quot;/&gt;

In 1753, following his return from Bologna he defected to the [[Teatro San Luca]] of the [[Vendramin]] family where he performed most of his plays to 1762.

=== Move to France and death ===

In 1757, he engaged in a bitter dispute with playwright [[Carlo Gozzi]], which left him utterly disgusted with the tastes of his countrymen; so much so that in 1761 he moved to Paris, where he received a position at court and was put in charge of the [[Comédie-Italienne|Theatre Italien]]. He spent the rest of his life in France, composing most of his plays in French and writing his memoirs in that language.

Among the plays which he wrote in French, the most successful was ''[[Le bourru bienfaisant]]'', produced on the occasion of the marriage of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]] in 1771. He enjoyed considerable popularity in France; when he retired to [[Versailles]], the King gave him a pension. He lost this pension after the [[French Revolution]]. The Convention eventually voted to restore his pension the day after his death. It was restored to his widow, at the pleading of the poet [[André Chénier]]; &quot;She is old&quot;, he urged, &quot;she is seventy-six, and her husband has left her no heritage save his illustrious name, his virtues and his poverty.&quot;

== Goldoni's impact on Italian theatre ==
[[Image:Statua di Carlo Goldoni (Firenze).JPG|thumb|Monument to Goldoni in [[Florence]](sculpted by [[Ulisse Cambi]])]]
Goldoni relates in considerable length in his ''Memoirs'' the state of Italian comedy when he began writing. At that time, Italian comedy revolved around the conventionality of the [[Commedia dell'arte]], or improvised comedy. Goldoni took to himself the task of superseding the comedy of masks and the comedy of intrigue by representations of actual life and manners. He rightly maintained that Italian life and manners were susceptible of artistic treatment such as had not been given them before.

His works are a lasting monument to the changes that he initiated: a dramatic revolution that had been attempted but not achieved before. Goldoni's importance lay in providing good examples rather than precepts. Goldoni says that he took for his models the plays of [[Molière]] and that whenever a piece of his own succeeded he whispered to himself: &quot;Good, but not yet Molière.&quot; Goldoni's plays are gentler and more optimistic in tone than Molière's.

It was this very success that was the object of harsh critiques by [[Carlo Gozzi]], who accused Goldoni of having deprived the Italian theatre of the charms of poetry and imagination. The great success of Gozzi's fairy dramas so irritated Goldoni that it led to his self-exile to France.

Goldoni gave to his country a classical form, which, though it has since been cultivated, has yet to be cultivated by a master.

== Themes ==
Goldoni's plays that were written while he was still in Italy ignore [[religion|religious]] and [[ecclesiastical]] subjects. This may be surprising, considering his staunch [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] upbringing. No thoughts are expressed about death or repentance in his memoirs or in his comedies. After his move to France, his position became clearer, as his plays took on a clear [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] tone and often satirized the hypocrisy of monks and of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]].

Goldoni was inspired by his love of humanity and the admiration he had for his fellow men. He wrote, and was obsessed with, the relationships that humans establish with one another, their cities and homes, the [[Humanism|Humanist]] movement, and the study of [[philosophy]]. The moral and civil values that Goldoni promotes in his plays are those of rationality, civility, humanism, the importance of the rising middle-class, a progressive stance to state affairs, honor and honesty. Goldoni had a dislike for arrogance, intolerance and the abuse of power.

Goldoni's main characters are no abstract examples of human virtue, nor monstrous examples of human vice. They occupy the middle ground of human temperament. Goldoni maintains an acute sensibility for the differences in social classes between his characters as well as environmental and generational changes. Goldoni pokes fun at the arrogant nobility and the pauper who lacks dignity.

== Venetian and Tuscan ==
As in other theatrical works of the time and place, the characters in Goldoni's Italian comedies spoke originally either the literary Tuscan variety (which became modern Italian) or the [[Venetian language|Venetian dialect]], depending on their station in life. However, in some printed editions of his plays he often turned the Venetian texts into Tuscan, too.

[[File:Normal Distribution CDF.svg|thumb|300px|Cumulative distribution function for the normal distributions in the image below.]]
[[File:Normal Distribution PDF.svg|thumb|300px|Probability density function for several normal distributions. The red line denotes the standard normal distribution.]]

In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], the '''cumulative distribution function''' ('''CDF'''), or just '''distribution function''', describes the probability that a real-valued [[random variable]] ''X'' with a given [[probability distribution]] will be found at a value less than or equal to ''x''.  Intuitively, it is the &quot;''area so far''&quot; function of the probability distribution.  Cumulative distribution functions are also used to specify the distribution of [[multivariate]] [[random variables]].

==Definition==
For every [[real number]] ''x'', the CDF of a real-valued [[random variable]] ''X'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto F_X(x) = \operatorname{P}(X\leq x),&lt;/math&gt;

where the right-hand side represents the [[probability]] that the random variable ''X'' takes on a value less than or
equal to ''x''. The probability that ''X'' lies in the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;nowiki&gt;)&lt;/nowiki&gt; is therefore
&lt;math&gt;F_X(b)-F_X(a)&lt;/math&gt;
if ''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b''.

If treating several random variables ''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'',&amp;nbsp;... etc. the corresponding letters are used as subscripts while, if treating only one, the subscript is omitted. It is conventional to use a capital ''F'' for a cumulative distribution function, in contrast to the lower-case ''f'' used for [[probability density function]]s and [[probability mass function]]s. This applies when discussing general distributions: some specific distributions have their own conventional notation, for example the [[normal distribution]].

The CDF of ''X'' can be defined in terms of the [[probability density function]] ƒ as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f(t)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in the definition above, the &quot;less than or equal to&quot; sign, &quot;≤&quot;, is a convention, not a universally used one (e.g. Hungarian literature uses &quot;&lt;&quot;), but is important for discrete distributions. The proper use of tables of the [[Binomial distribution|binomial]] and [[Poisson distribution]]s depend upon this convention. Moreover, important formulas like [[Paul Pierre Lévy|Levy's]] inversion formula for the characteristic function also rely on the &quot;less or equal&quot; formulation.

== Properties ==
[[Image:Discrete probability distribution illustration.svg|right|thumb|From top to bottom, the cumulative distribution function of a discrete probability distribution, continuous probability distribution, and a distribution which has both a continuous part and a discrete part.]]

Every cumulative distribution function ''F'' is (not necessarily strictly) monotone non-decreasing (see [[monotone increasing]]) and [[right-continuous]]. Furthermore, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to -\infty}F(x)=0, \quad \lim_{x\to +\infty}F(x)=1.&lt;/math&gt;

Every function with these four properties is a CDF. The properties imply that all CDFs are [[càdlàg]] functions.

If ''X'' is a [[discrete random variable]], then it attains values ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... with probability ''p''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = P(''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;), and the CDF of ''X'' will be discontinuous at the points ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and constant in between:

:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \operatorname{P}(X\leq x) = \sum_{x_i \leq x} \operatorname{P}(X = x_i) = \sum_{x_i \leq x} p(x_i).&lt;/math&gt;

If the CDF ''F'' of ''X'' is [[continuous function|continuous]], then ''X'' is a [[continuous random variable]]; if furthermore ''F'' is [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]], then there exists a [[Lebesgue integral|Lebesgue-integrable]] function ''f''(''x'') such that 

:&lt;math&gt;F(b)-F(a) = \operatorname{P}(a&lt; X\leq b) = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

for all real numbers ''a'' and ''b''.  (The first of the two equalities displayed above would not be correct in general if we had not said that the distribution is continuous.  Continuity of the distribution implies that P (''X'' = ''a'') = P (''X'' = ''b'') = 0, so the difference between &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;≤&quot; ceases to be important in this context.)  The function ''f'' is equal to the [[derivative]] of ''F'' [[almost everywhere]], and it is called the [[probability density function]] of the distribution of ''X''.

===Point probability===
The &quot;point probability&quot; that ''X'' is exactly ''b'' can be found as

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(X=b) = F(b) - \lim_{x \to b^{-}} F(x).&lt;/math&gt;

==Kolmogorov&amp;ndash;Smirnov and Kuiper's tests==
The [[Kolmogorov&amp;ndash;Smirnov test]] is based on cumulative distribution functions and can be used to test to see whether two empirical distributions are different or whether an empirical distribution is different from an ideal distribution. The closely related [[Kuiper's test]] ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|aɪ|p|ər|z}}) is useful if the domain of the distribution is cyclic as in day of the week. For instance we might use Kuiper's test to see if the number of tornadoes varies during the year or if sales of a product vary by day of the week or day of the month.

==Complementary cumulative distribution function (tail distribution)==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Power law]] --&gt;
Sometimes, it is useful to study the opposite question and ask how often the random variable is ''above'' a particular level.  This is called the '''complementary cumulative distribution function''' ('''ccdf''') or simply the '''tail distribution''' or '''exceedance''', and is defined as

&lt;math&gt;\bar F(x) = \operatorname{P}(X &gt; x) = 1 - F(x).&lt;/math&gt;

This has applications in [[statistics|statistical]] [[hypothesis test]]ing, for example, because one-sided [[P-value]] is the probability of observing a test statistic ''at least'' as extreme as the one observed; hence, the one-sided [[P-value]] is simply given by the ccdf.

In [[survival analysis]], &lt;math&gt;\bar F(x)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''[[survival function]]''' and denoted &lt;math&gt; S(x) &lt;/math&gt;, while the term ''reliability function'' is common in [[engineering]].

=== Properties ===
* For a non-negative random variable having an expectation, [[Markov's inequality]] states that: &lt;math&gt;\bar F(x) \leq \frac{\mathbb E(X)}{x} &lt;/math&gt;
* As &lt;math&gt; x \to \infty, \bar F(x) \to 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;, and in fact &lt;math&gt; \bar F(x) = o(1/x) &lt;/math&gt;
Proof: Assuming X has density function f, we have for any &lt;math&gt; c&gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb E(X) = \int_0^\infty xf(x)dx \geq \int_0^c xf(x)dx + c\int_c^\infty f(x)dx
&lt;/math&gt;
Recognizing &lt;math&gt;\bar F(c) = \int_c^\infty f(x)dx &lt;/math&gt; and rearranging terms:
:&lt;math&gt;
0 \leq c\bar F(c) \leq \mathbb E(X) - \int_0^c x f(x)dx \to 0 \text{  as  } c \to \infty
&lt;/math&gt;
as claimed.

==Folded cumulative distribution==
[[Image:FoldedCumulative.PNG|thumb|right|Example of the folded cumulative distribution for a [[normal distribution]] function]]
While the plot of a cumulative distribution often has an S-like shape, an alternative illustration is the '''folded cumulative distribution''' or '''mountain plot''', which folds the top half of the graph over,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gentle&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Gentle, J.E.|page=|year=2009|title=Computational Statistics|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|url=http://books.google.de/books?id=m4r-KVxpLsAC&amp;lpg=PA348&amp;ots=8Wxj0G_GC6&amp;dq=folded%20cumulative%20distribution%20or%20mountain%20plot&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA348#v=onepage&amp;q=folded%20cumulative%20distribution%20or%20mountain%20plot&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;Monti&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Monti, K.L.|pages=342–345|year=1995|title=Folded Empirical Distribution Function Curves (Mountain Plots).  The American Statistician 49|publisher=[[American Statistical Association]]|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/2684570}}&lt;/ref&gt;
thus using two scales, one for the upslope and another for the downslope. This form of illustration emphasises the [[median (statistics)|median]] and [[dispersion (statistics)|dispersion]] of the distribution or of the empirical results.

== Examples ==
As an example, suppose ''X'' is uniformly distributed on the unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1].
Then the CDF of X is given by

:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \begin{cases}
0 &amp;:\ x &lt; 0\\
x &amp;:\ 0 \le x \le 1\\
1 &amp;:\ 1 &lt; x.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Take another example, suppose ''X'' takes only the discrete values 0 and 1, with equal probability.
Then the CDF of X is given by

:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \begin{cases}
0 &amp;:\ x &lt; 0\\
1/2 &amp;:\ 0 \le x &lt; 1\\
1 &amp;:\ 1 \le x.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- ByTe was here! --&gt;

==Inverse distribution function (quantile function)==
If the CDF ''F'' is strictly increasing and continuous then &lt;math&gt; F^{-1}( y ), y \in [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; is the unique real number &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; F(x) = y &lt;/math&gt;.

Unfortunately, the distribution does not, in general, have an inverse.  One may define, for &lt;math&gt; y \in [0,1] &lt;/math&gt;, the '''generalized inverse distribution function''':
:&lt;math&gt;
F^{-1}(y) = \inf_{x \in \mathbb{R}} \{ F(x) \geq y \}.
&lt;/math&gt;

*Example 1: The median is &lt;math&gt;F^{-1}( 0.5 )&lt;/math&gt;.
*Example 2: Put &lt;math&gt; \tau = F^{-1}( 0.95 ) &lt;/math&gt;.  Then we call &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; the 95th percentile.

The inverse of the cdf is called the [[quantile function]].

The inverse of the cdf can be used to translate results obtained for the uniform distribution to other distributions.  Some useful properties of the inverse cdf are:

# &lt;math&gt;F^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is nondecreasing
# &lt;math&gt;F^{-1}(F(x)) \leq x&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;F(F^{-1}(y)) \geq y&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;F^{-1}(y) \leq x&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;y \leq F(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# If &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has a &lt;math&gt;U[0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; distribution then &lt;math&gt;F^{-1}(Y)&lt;/math&gt; is distributed as &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. This is used in [[random number generation]] using the [[inverse transform sampling]]-method.
# If &lt;math&gt;\{X_\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of independent &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-distributed random variables defined on the same sample space, then there exist random variables &lt;math&gt;Y_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Y_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is distributed as &lt;math&gt;U[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F^{-1}(Y_\alpha) = X_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; with probability 1 for all &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

==Multivariate case ==
When dealing simultaneously with more than one random variable the ''joint'' cumulative distribution function can also be defined. For example, for a pair of random variables ''X,Y'', the joint CDF is given by

&lt;math&gt;(x, y) \to F(x,y) = \operatorname{P}(X\leq x,Y\leq y),&lt;/math&gt;

where the right-hand side represents the [[probability]] that the random variable ''X'' takes on a value less than or
equal to ''x'' and that ''Y'' takes on a value less than or
equal to ''y''.

Every multivariate CDF is:
# Monotonically non-decreasing for each of its variables 
# Right-continuous for each of its variables.
# &lt;math&gt;0\leq F(x_{1},...,x_{n})\leq 1&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x_{1},...,x_{n}\rightarrow+\infty}F(x_{1},...,x_{n})=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x_{i}\rightarrow-\infty}F(x_{1},...,x_{n})=0,\quad \mbox{for all i}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[statistics]], the term '''central tendency''' relates to the way in which [[quantitative data]] is clustered around some value.&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. ISBN 0-19-920613-9&lt;/ref&gt; A '''measure of central tendency''' is a way of specifying - central value. In practical statistical analysis, the terms are often used before one has chosen even a preliminary form of analysis: thus an initial objective might be to &quot;choose an appropriate measure of central tendency&quot;.

In the simplest cases, the measure of central tendency is an [[average]] of a set of [[measurement]]s, the word ''average'' being variously construed as mean, median, or other measure of location, depending on the context. However, the term is applied to multidimensional data as well as to [[univariate]] data and in situations where a [[Data transformation (statistics)|transformation]] of the data values for some or all dimensions would usually be considered necessary: in the latter cases, the notion of a &quot;central location&quot; is retained in converting an &quot;average&quot; computed for the transformed data back to the original units. In addition, there are several different kinds of calculations for central tendency, where the kind of calculation depends on the type of data ([[level of measurement]]).

Both &quot;central tendency&quot; and &quot;measure of central tendency&quot; apply to either [[statistical population]]s or to samples from a population.

==Basic measures of central tendency==

The following may be applied to individual dimensions of multidimensional data, after transformation, although some of these involve their own implicit transformation of the data.
*[[Arithmetic mean]] - the sum of all measurements divided by the number of observations in the data set
*[[Median]] - the middle value that separates the higher half from the lower half of the data set
*[[Mode (statistics)|Mode]] - the most frequent value in the data set
*[[Geometric mean]] - the [[Nth root|''n''th root]] of the product of the data values
*[[Harmonic mean]] - the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the data values
*[[Weighted mean]] - an arithmetic mean that incorporates weighting to certain data elements
*[[Truncated mean]] - the arithmetic mean of data values after a certain number or proportion of the highest and lowers data values have been discarded.
*[[Midrange]] - the arithmetic mean of the maximum and minimum values of a data set.

A celebrity, also referred to as a celeb in [[popular culture]], is a person who has a prominent profile in the media and is easily recognized.  Celebrity status might be associated with certain professions and frequent appearances in the media.  It can arise as a result of career planning but it can also arise by accident or as a result of [[infamy]].

==Instances in history&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1777554.stm
&lt;/ref&gt;==

Early recorded instances of celebrity include the winners at the Olympic games in ancient Greece.  Winners of the games promoted their fame by commissioning hymns praising their exploits.

In ancient Rome portraits of powerful men appeared stamped on coins.  Works of art bearing their likenesses further enhanced their fame.  The renown of certain actors, such as [[Quintus Roscius Gallus]], endured until the 19th century.  Gladiators could also gain considerable fame as news of their victories spread by [[word of mouth]].

In the 12th century news of the murder of [[Thomas Becket | Thomas à Becket]], archbishop of Canterbury, spread across Europe.  Relics and images of Becket became commonplace.  His portrait was found from Iceland to Palestine.  Manuscripts, wall paintings and stained glass were decorated with scenes of the saint's life.  His reputation has endured: [[T. S. Eliot]] wrote about his death in ''[[Murder in the Cathedral]]'' in 1935 and a popular film about him appeared  in 1964.

In the 16th and early 17th centuries repeated performances of [[William Shakespeare | Shakespeare]]'s plays contributed to his fame.  Writers gained recognition as literacy levels improved and reading became a form of entertainment. Many consider [[Lord Byron]] the archetype of &quot;rock star status;&quot; Having drawn extensively from his personal life in his poetry, and much of his works' early successes were based on the perceived similarity between author and poem, frequently touching on sex, alcohol, drugs, isolation and exoticism. On the success of his first long poem, [[ Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]] Byron stated &quot;I went to bed one night and simply woke up famous.&quot;

In the Victorian era authors such as [[Charles Dickens]] built up their popularity by publishing their work in newspapers and magazines.

Growth in the number of media channels in the late 20th century led to increased exposure for celebrities.  In the early 21st century there are more celebrities than previously{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

People may become celebrities in a wide range of ways: from their professions, following appearances in the [[mass media]], or even by complete accident or [[infamy]]. The term &quot;instant celebrity&quot; describes someone who becomes a celebrity in a very short period of time. In some places{{Which?|date=April 2011}}, someone who achieves a small amount of [[wikt:transience|transient]] fame  (through, say, [[hype]] or mass media) may become labeled a &quot;B-grade celebrity&quot;.  Often the generalization extends to someone who falls short of mainstream or persistent fame but who seeks to extend or exploit it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In the 20th century, public fascination with celebrities and demand for celebrity [[gossip]] gave rise to the [[gossip columnist]], [[tabloid]]s, [[paparazzi]] and celebrity [[blogging]].

The rise of international celebrities in acting and popular music originates in large part in the scope and scale of the [[media industry | media industries]], enabling celebrities to be viewed more often and in more places.

==Regional and cultural celebrities==
[[image:Michael Jackson with the Reagans.jpg|250px|right|thumb|President [[Ronald Reagan]] and first lady [[Nancy Reagan]] welcome pop singer [[Michael Jackson]] to the [[White House]] in the 1980s. Whereas Jackson was famous as an entertainer, the Reagans gained fame through their involvement in American politics.]]

Most cultures and regions have their own independent celebrity systems{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, with distinct hierarchies of popular film, television and sports stars.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;!-- Do, say, the Malvinas have their own independent celebrity system, with a hierarchy of popular film, television, and sports stars?--&gt; A person who garners a degree of fame in one culture may be considered less famous or obscure in another. Some nationwide celebrities might command some attention outside their own nation; for example, the singer [[Lara Fabian]] is widely known in the [[French-speaking]] world, but only had a couple of [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] hits in the U.S., whereas the francophone Canadian singer [[Celine Dion]] is well-known in both the French-speaking world and in the U.S.

Regions within a country, or cultural communities (linguistic, ethnic, religious) can also have their own celebrity systems, especially in linguistically or culturally distinct regions such as [[Quebec]] or [[Wales]]. Regional radio personalities, newscasters, politicians or community [[leader]]s may be local or regional celebrities.

A local celebrity is a person well known in one locality but are little known elsewhere.

A person might have celebrity status within a particular culture (such as [[Santa Claus]]) or might be unique to a particular diaspora.

English-speaking media commentators and journalists will sometimes refer to celebrities as belonging to the ''[[A-List]]'' or ''B-List'', or ''C-List'', ''D-List'' or ''Z-List'', often in a disparaging context. These informal rankings indicate a placing within a hierarchy. However, due to differing levels of celebrity in different regions, it is difficult to place people within one bracket. A Nicaraguan actor might be a B-list action film actor in the US, but an A-list star in the Czech Republic. An objective method of placing celebrities from any country into categories from ''A-List'' to ''H-List'' based on their number of [[Google]] hits has been proposed,&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Schulman|E. Schulman]], &quot;[http://members.verizon.net/~vze3fs8i/air/fame3.html Measuring Fame Quantitatively. III. What Does it Take to Make the 'A' List?],&quot;''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]'' '''[http://improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume12/v12i1/v12i1.html Vol. 12, No. 1]''' (2006), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
but this method only works for people with distinctive names, e.g., Jason Mewes, not Kevin Smith.

It's hard to measure someone's fame. Even worldwide celebrities might still be unknown to people in isolated countries like [[North Korea]], to villagers without access to international news media or to people who are simply uninterested in celebrities. Certain phenomena have however been called{{Who|date=October 2010}} definitive proof of fame, such as appearing on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', being spoofed in ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', having a wax statue in ''[[Madame Tussauds]]'', or receiving a star on the ''[[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].''{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Certain people are known even to people unfamiliar with the area in which they excelled. [[Pablo Picasso|Pablo Picasso's]] style and name are known even to people who are not interested in art; likewise many know that [[Harry Houdini]] was an illusionist, [[Bill Gates]] a businessman, [[Albert Einstein]] a scientist; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] classical composers; [[Luciano Pavarotti]] an opera singer. Many around the world know the name and face of the current American president.

==Careers that produce celebrity==
[[Image:Gisele.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gisele Bündchen]], model]]
Some professional activities, being highly paid, exposed and in which it is difficult to excel are likely to confer celebrity status in themselves. For example, [[movie star|movie stars]] and television [[actor|actors]] with lead roles in prominently scheduled shows are likely to become celebrities. High-ranking [[politician|politicians]], [[businessmen]], national [[List of television reporters|television reporters]], [[radio personalities]], daytime television show hosts, &quot;[[supermodel|supermodels]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://models.com/icons/icons.html?fnumber=5&amp;lnumber=1 MODELS.com's Icons - 5-1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
successful [[Sportsperson|athletes]], [[pornographic actor|porn stars]] and chart-topping [[musician|musicians]] are also likely to become celebrities. A few [[humanitarian]] leaders such as [[Mother Teresa]] have even achieved fame because of their charitable work. Some people have achieved fame online and thus are [[Internet celebrity|Internet celebrities]].

While some [[film director|film]] and [[Theatre direction|theatre director]]s, [[Theatre producer|producers]], [[fashion designers]], [[artist|artists]], [[author|authors]], [[trial lawyer|trial lawyers]], [[scientist|scientists]], [[journalist|journalists]] and [[dancer|dancers]] have achieved celebrity status, celebrity is not necessary to success in these fields and in general they are less noted than actors of equal professional importance to the business.

===Ensuing political career===
{{Category see also|American actor-politicians}}

==Celebrity families==

Another example of celebrity is a family that has notable ancestors or is known for its wealth. Examples are the [[Kennedy family|Kennedy]], [[House of Windsor|Windsor]], [[The Osbournes|Osbourne]], [[Chaplin family|Chaplin]], [[Barrymore family|Barrymore]], [[Hilton family|Hilton]], [[Bush family|Bush]] and [[Jackson family|Jackson]] families.

==Celebrity as a mass media phenomenon==
In the 1970s, academics began analyzing the phenomenon of celebrity and stardom. According to [[Sofia Johansson]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;!-- where did she write this? --&gt; the &quot;canonical texts on stardom&quot; include [[Daniel Boorstin]]'s ''The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America'' (1961) and articles by Boorstin (1971), Alberoni (1972), and [[Richard Dyer|Dyer]] (1979){{Vague|date=October 2010}}&lt;!-- with no bibliography, these are meaningless --&gt; which examined the &quot;representations of stars and on aspects of the Hollywood star system.&quot; Johansson notes &quot;more recent analyses within media and cultural studies (e.g. Gamson 1994; Marshall 1997; Giles 2000; Turner, Marshall and Bonner 2000; Rojek 2001; Turner 2004{{Vague|date=October 2010}}&lt;!-- with no bibliography, these are meaningless --&gt;) have instead dealt with the idea of a pervasive, contemporary, 'celebrity culture'.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

[[Bob Greene]] argues for &quot;most of man's history...people of talent would work to create something--something written, something painted, something sculpted, something acted out--and it would be passed on to audiences.&quot; With the rise of reality TV shows, Greene points out audiences have been turned into the creators. He argues the &quot;alleged stars of the reality shows ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', have become famous not for doing, but merely for being.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bob Greene|B. Greene]], &quot;[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/bob/greene091400.asp  The new stardom that doesn't require paying any dues],&quot;''Jewish World Review'', September 14, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|You have to go through many hoops just to talk to a major celebrity. You have to get past three different sets of [[publicist]]s: the publicist for the event, the publicist for the movie, and then the celebrity's personal publicist.

Greene says &quot;You simply have to be present, in the right place at the right time.&quot; Whereas publicly famous people &quot;were once defined as such based upon the fact their remarkable skills had brought them to the attention of the public.&quot; Greene states with reality TV, &quot;one can become a public person just by being a person, in public.&quot;

&quot;Celebrities often have fame comparable to [[royal family|royalty]],&quot; claimed{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;!-- where did she claim this? --&gt;  author [[Micha Frydman]]. As a result, there is a strong public curiosity about their private affairs. Celebrities may be resented for their accolades, and the public may have a love/hate relationship with celebrities. Due to the high visibility of celebrities' private lives, their successes and shortcomings are often made very public. Celebrities are alternately portrayed as glowing examples of perfection, when they garner awards, or as decadent or immoral if they become associated with a scandal. When seen in a positive light, celebrities are frequently portrayed as possessing skills and abilities beyond average people; for example, celebrity actors are routinely celebrated for acquiring new skills necessary for filming a role within a very brief time, and to a level that amazes the professionals who train them. Similarly, celebrities with very little formal education can be portrayed as experts on complicated issues.

Tabloid magazines and talk TV shows bestow a great deal of attention on celebrities. To stay in the public eye and make money, more celebrities are participating in business ventures such as celebrity-branded items including books, clothing lines, perfume, and household items.

Chapter 1 of [[Chris Hedges]]' ''Empire of Illusion: The End of Literacy and the Triumph of Spectacle'' (2009) is an extensive critique of what he calls &quot;celebrity culture.&quot;  Citing authors like [[Daniel Boorstin]], [[Neil Gabler]], James Bradley, and [[C. Wright Mills]], Hegdes argues that celebrity culture is a exemplified in media exaltations of superficiality, [[cosmetic surgery]], [[New Age]] spirituality mysticism, [[pop psychology]], motivational speakers, success gospel evangelism, and TV shows like ''[[American Idol]]'' and ''[[The Swan]]''.  Hedges criticizes the &quot;moral [[nihilism]]&quot; inherent in celebrity culture, in which human beings become [[commodity|commodities]] while those who possess true power &amp;mdash; [[corporation]]s and the oligarchic elite &amp;mdash; are veiled and rendered invisible.

==15 minutes of fame==
{{Main|15 minutes of fame}}
[[Andy Warhol]] coined the phrase &quot;[[15 minutes of fame]]&quot;. &quot;Celebrities&quot; in the 21st century can now be famous simply by being in the right place at the right time. These &quot;celebs&quot; are regular people who originally are not celebrities, becoming celebrities, and are often turned into celebrities based on the ridiculous things they do. An example of this is reality TV contestant [[Tiffany Pollard]] also known as &quot;New York&quot;, from [[VH1]]'s ''[[Flavor of Love]]''. &quot;In fact, many reality show contestants fall into this category: the only thing that qualifies them to be on TV is that they're real.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Maasik, Sonia, and Jack Solomon. Signs of Life in the USA. 5th ed. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Other &quot;15 minutes of fame&quot; celebrities can be average people seen with an A-list celebrity, who are sometimes noticed on entertainment news channels such as [[E! News]].

Warhol also hinted that these people would be famous for ''&quot;15 minutes&quot;'', or in other words ''&quot;a really short time until the fad or trend has died out.&quot;'' This also explains why certain people can be world famous in a certain century, decade, year,... but already obscure soon after. [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] was a famous [[Florentine]] statesman during the 15th century, but today only people who are familiar with history might know his name. Film actors like [[Harold Lloyd]] and [[Louise Brooks]], who were world famous in the 1920s are not as well known by the general public nowadays as they were back then. [[MC Hammer]] is famous to people who were young in 1990, but later generations are less familiar with his name or music.

The opposite can be true as well. Painter [[Rembrandt van Rijn]] and composer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} who were successful during their lifetimes, both died almost forgotten. Their reputation grew only a few decades later. [[Vincent van Gogh]] was obscure during his lifetime and only sold one painting in his life. Only several years after his death was he regarded as an innovator and artistic genius and did his fame grow to international proportions. Blues singer [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] only recorded a handful of songs in the 1930s and then died, only becoming well known in the vicinity of the state where he used to live. He is now much more famous and respected as an artist, due to the [[legend]]s surrounding his life.

Certain people are only remembered today because of a movie portrayal, certain story or [[urban legend]] surrounding their life and less for their accomplishments. [[Antonio Salieri]] was a famous and well known 18th century composer, who sank into obscurity the next two centuries. He was rediscovered thanks to the musical and film ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'', but his fictional portrayal as an [[antagonist]] has been more famous than his music since the end of the 20th century. [[Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle]] and [[O.J. Simpson]] are more notorious for the murder scandal in which they were involved than for their respective movie and sports careers. [[Ronald Reagan]] is more famous as a [[politician]] today than as a [[movie actor]].   Centuries after his death, [[Andrea Mantegna]] now better known as the mentor of [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] than for his own paintings.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Celebrity and social networking==
Celebrities have been flocking to [[social networking]] sites such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[MySpace]].&lt;ref&gt;Murad, Ahmed [http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article5641893.ece &quot;The 50 most popular celebs on Twitter&quot;], The Sunday Times, February 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Social networking sites allow celebrities to communicate directly with their fans, removing the middle-man known as traditional media. Social media humanizes celebrities in a way that arouses public fascination as evident by the success of magazines such as ''[[Us Weekly]]'' and ''[[People (magazine)|People Weekly]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Social media sites have even catapulted some to fame. [[Tila Tequila]] for example, shot to stardom on [[MySpace]].&lt;ref&gt;Trebay, Guy [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/fashion/28fame.html &quot;She's Famous (and So Can You)&quot;], The New York Times, October 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrities and the law==

Celebrities have many unique legal issues, of which the most important arise from [[personality rights]].

[[California]] has an extraordinary concentration of celebrities in and around [[Los Angeles]] (particularly [[Hollywood]]), an important center of American culture. The [[California Legislature]] has thus enacted a number of laws to deal with celebrities' legal problems, such as the [[California Celebrities Rights Act]].  Many U.S.-based celebrities choose to file for divorce in California courts (even when they were married elsewhere) as California judges are experienced in handling celebrity divorces.

    <title>Cluster sampling</title>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cluster sampling''' is a [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] technique used when &quot;natural&quot; groupings are evident in a [[statistical population]].  It is often used in marketing research. In this technique, the total population is divided into these groups (or clusters) and a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] of the groups is selected. Then the required information is collected from the elements within each selected group. This may be done for every element in these groups or a subsample of elements may be selected within each of these groups. A common motivation for cluster sampling is to reduce the average cost per interview. Given a fixed budget, this can allow an increased sample size. Assuming a fixed sample size, the technique gives more accurate results when most of the variation in the population is within the groups, not between them.

==Cluster elements==
Elements within a cluster should ideally be as heterogeneous as possible, but there should be homogeneity between cluster [[mean]]s. Each cluster should be a small scale representation of the total population. The clusters should be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. A random sampling technique is then used on any relevant clusters to choose which clusters to include in the study. In single-stage cluster sampling, all the elements from each of the selected clusters are used. In two-stage cluster sampling, a random sampling technique is applied to the elements from each of the selected clusters.

The main difference between cluster sampling and [[stratified sampling]] is that in cluster sampling the cluster is treated as the sampling unit so analysis is done on a population of clusters (at least in the first stage).  In stratified sampling, the analysis is done on elements within strata. In stratified sampling, a random sample is drawn from each of the strata, whereas in cluster sampling only the selected clusters are studied. The main objective of cluster sampling is to reduce costs by increasing sampling efficiency. This contrasts with stratified sampling where the main objective is to increase precision.

There also exists multistage sampling, where more than two steps are taken in selecting clusters from clusters.

==Aspects of cluster sampling==
One version of cluster sampling is '''area sampling''' or '''geographical cluster sampling'''. Clusters consist of geographical areas. Because a geographically dispersed population can be expensive to survey, greater economy than simple random sampling can be achieved by treating several respondents within a local area as a cluster. It is usually necessary to increase the total sample size to achieve equivalent precision in the [[estimator]]s, but cost savings may make that feasible.

In some situations, [[cluster analysis]] is only appropriate when the clusters are approximately the same size. This can be achieved by combining clusters. If this is not possible, '''probability proportionate to size sampling''' is used. In this method, the probability of selecting any cluster varies with the size of the cluster, giving larger clusters a greater probability of selection and smaller clusters a lower probability. However, if clusters are selected with probability proportionate to size, the same number of interviews should be carried out in each sampled cluster so that each unit sampled has the same probability of selection.

Cluster sampling is used to estimate high mortalities in cases such as [[war]]s, [[famine]]s and [[natural disaster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;David Brown, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/10/AR2006101001442.html Study Claims Iraq's 'Excess' Death Toll Has Reached 655,000], ''Washington Post'', Wednesday, October 11, 2006. Retrieved September 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

* Can be cheaper than other methods - e.g. fewer travel expenses, administration costs

==Disadvantages==

* Higher [[sampling error]], which can be expressed in the so-called &quot;design effect&quot;, the ratio between the number of subjects in the cluster study and the number of subjects in an equally reliable, randomly sampled unclustered study.&lt;ref&gt;Kerry and Bland (1998).

'''Charles Baudelaire''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃaʁl bodlɛʁ|lang}}; April 9, 1821 – August 31, 1867) was a [[French poetry|French poet]] who also produced notable work as an essayist, [[art critic]], and pioneering [[Translation|translator]] of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].

==Baudelaire the Poet==
Baudelaire is one of the major innovators in [[French literature]]. His poetry is influenced by the French romantic poets of the earlier 19th century, although its attention to the formal features of verse connect it more closely to the work of the contemporary 'Parnassians'. As for theme and tone, in his works we see the rejection of the belief in the supremacy of nature and the fundamental goodness of man as typically espoused by the romantics and expressed by them in rhetorical, effusive and public voice in favor of a new urban sensibility, an awareness of individual moral complexity, an interest in vice (linked with [[Decadent movement|decadence]]) and refined sensual and aesthetical pleasures, and the use of urban subject matter, such as the city, the crowd, individual passers-by, all expressed in highly ordered verse, sometimes through a cynical and ironic voice. Formally, the use of sound to create atmosphere, and of 'symbols', (images which take on an expanded function within the poem), betray a move towards considering the poem as a self-referential object, an idea further developed by the Symbolists Verlaine and Mallarmé, who acknowledge Baudelaire as a pioneer in this regard. 

Beyond his innovations in versification and the theories of symbolism and 'correspondences', an awareness of which is essential to any appreciation of the literary value of his work, aspects of his work which regularly receive (or have received) much critical discussion include the role of women, the theological direction of his work and his alleged advocacy of 'satanism', his experience of drug-induced states of mind, the figure of the dandy, his stance regarding democracy and its implications for the individual, his response to the spiritual uncertainties of the time, his criticisms of the bourgeois, and his advocacy of modern music and painting (e.g., Wagner, Delacroix) 

Anthologies of French verse often dedicate more space to his works than to that of any other 19th-century poet; and, above and beyond any considerations of influence/historic significance, the best of his work is among the finest French poetry{{POV-statement|date=March 2011}}.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Baudelaire was born in [[Paris, France]] on April 9, 1821 and baptized two months later at [[Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]] Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Baudelaire, Richard Howard, Les Fleurs Du Mal, David R. Godine Publisher, 1983, p.xxv, ISBN 0879234628, 9780879234621&lt;/ref&gt; His father, François Baudelaire, a senior [[civil service|civil servant]] and amateur [[artist]], was thirty-four years older than Baudelaire's mother. François died during Baudelaire's childhood, in 1827. The following year, Caroline married Lieutenant Colonel Jacques Aupick, who later became a French ambassador to various noble courts. Biographers have often seen this as a crucial moment, considering that finding himself no longer the sole focus of his mother's affection left him with a trauma which goes some way to explaining the excesses later apparent in his life. He stated in a letter to her that, &quot;There was in my childhood a period of passionate love for you&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;  Baudelaire regularly implored his mother for money throughout his career, often promising that a lucrative publishing contract or journalistic commission was just around the corner.

Baudelaire was educated in [[Lyon]], where he boarded. Baudelaire at fourteen was described by a classmate: &quot;He was much more refined and distinguished than any of our fellow pupils [...] we are bound to one another[...] by shared tastes and sympathies, the precocious love of fine works of literature&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; Baudelaire was erratic in his studies, at times diligent, at other times prone to &quot;idleness&quot;. Later, he attended the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] in Paris, studying law, a popular course for those not yet decided on any particular career. Baudelaire began to frequent [[prostitute]]s and may have contracted [[gonorrhea]] and [[syphilis]] during this period. Baudelaire began to run up debts, mostly for clothes. Upon gaining his [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1839, he told his brother &quot;I don't feel I have a vocation for anything.&quot; His stepfather had in mind a career in law or diplomacy, but instead Baudelaire decided to embark upon a literary career. His mother later recalled: &quot;Oh, what grief! If Charles had let himself be guided by his stepfather, his career would have been very different... He would not have left a name in literature, it is true, but we should have been happier, all three of us&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p.70&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Baudelaire 1844.jpg|thumb|Portrait by Emile Deroy (1820–1846)]]
His stepfather sent him on a voyage to [[Calcutta, India]] in 1841 in the hope of ending his dissolute habits. The trip provided strong impressions of the sea, sailing, and exotic ports, that he later employed in his poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt; (Baudelaire later exaggerated his aborted trip to create a legend about his youthful travels and experiences, including &quot;riding on elephants&quot;). Baudelaire returned to the taverns where he began to compose some of the poems of Les Fleurs du Mal. At twenty-one, he received a good-sized inheritance but squandered much of it within a few years. His family obtained a decree to place his property in trust&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; which he resented bitterly, at one point arguing that allowing him to fail alone financially would have been the one sure way of teaching him the value of maintaining well-ordered finances. 

Baudelaire became known in artistic circles as a [[dandy]] and free-spender. During this time [[Jeanne Duval]] became his mistress. His mother thought Duval a &quot;Black Venus&quot; who &quot;tortured him in every way&quot; and drained him of money at every opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; She was rejected by his family. He made a suicide attempt during this time.

Baudelaire took part in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|Revolutions of 1848]] and wrote for a revolutionary newspaper. However, his interest was passing, as he was later to note in his political writings in his journals.

In the early 1850s, Baudelaire struggled with poor health, pressing debts, and irregular literary output. He often moved from one lodging to another to escape creditors. He received many projects that he was unable to complete, though he did finish translations of stories by [[Edgar Allan Poe]].

Upon the death of his stepfather in 1857, Baudelaire received no mention in the will but he was heartened nonetheless that the division with his mother might now be mended. At thirty-six he wrote her: &quot;believe that I belong to you absolutely, and that I belong only to you&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p.219.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Published career===

His first published work was his [[art]] review &quot;Salon of 1845,&quot; which attracted immediate attention for its boldness. Many of his critical opinions were novel in their time, including his championing of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], and some of his views seem remarkably in tune with the future theories of the Impressionist painters. 

In 1846, Baudelaire wrote his second Salon review, gaining additional credibility as an advocate and critic of [[Romanticism]]. His support of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] as the foremost Romantic artist gained widespread notice.&lt;ref name = &quot;crapkq&quot;&gt;Richardson 1994, p.110.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Baudelaire's novella ''La Fanfarlo'' was published.

====''The Flowers of Evil''====
[[Image:Fleurs du mal.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The first edition of ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' with author's notes.]]
Baudelaire was a slow and fastidious worker, often sidetracked by [[indolence]], emotional distress and illness, and it was not until 1857 that he published his first and most famous volume of poems, ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' (''The Flowers of Evil''). Some of these poems had already appeared in the ''[[Revue des deux mondes]]'' (''Review of Two Worlds''), when they were published by Baudelaire's friend [[Auguste Poulet Malassis]].

The poems found a small, appreciative audience, but greater public attention was given to their subject matter. The effect on fellow artists was, as [[Théodore de Banville]] stated, &quot;immense, prodigious, unexpected, mingled with admiration and with some indefinable anxious fear&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p.236.&lt;/ref&gt; Flaubert, recently attacked in a similar fashion for ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' (and acquitted), was impressed and wrote to Baudelaire: &quot;You have found a way to rejuvenate Romanticism... You are as unyielding as marble, and as penetrating as an English mist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p.241.&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal themes of [[Human sexuality|sex]] and death were considered scandalous. He also touched on [[lesbianism]], sacred and profane love, metamorphosis, melancholy, the corruption of the city, lost innocence, the oppressiveness of living, and wine. Notable in some poems is Baudelaire's use of imagery of the sense of smell and of fragrances, which is used to evoke feelings of [[nostalgia]] and past intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p.231.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book, however, quickly became a byword for unwholesomeness among mainstream [[critic]]s of the day. Some critics called a few of the poems &quot;masterpieces of passion, art and poetry&quot; but other poems were deemed to merit no less than legal action to suppress them.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, pp. 232–237&lt;/ref&gt; J. Habas writing in ''[[Le Figaro]]'', led the charge against Baudelaire, writing: &quot;Everything in it which is not hideous is incomprehensible, everything one understands is putrid&quot;. Then Baudelaire responded to the outcry, in a prophetic letter to his mother: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;You know that I have always considered that literature and the arts pursue an aim independent of morality. Beauty of conception and style is enough for me. But this book, whose title (''Fleurs du mal'') says everything, is clad, as you will see, in a cold and sinister beauty. It was created with rage and patience. Besides, the proof of its positive worth is in all the ill that they speak of it. The book enrages people. Moreover, since I was terrified myself of the horror that I should inspire, I cut out a third from the proofs. They deny me everything, the spirit of invention and even the knowledge of the French language. I don't care a rap about all these imbeciles, and I know that this book, with its virtues and its faults, will make its way in the memory of the lettered public, beside the best poems of V. Hugo, Th. Gautier and even Byron.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p.238.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Rops Les Epaves 1866.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Illustration cover for ''[[Les Épaves]]'', by Baudelaire's friend [[Félicien Rops]].]]
Baudelaire, his [[publisher]] and the [[printer (publisher)|printer]] were successfully prosecuted for creating an offense against public [[morality|morals]]. They were fined but Baudelaire was not imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p.248&lt;/ref&gt; Six of the poems were suppressed, but printed later as ''[[Les Épaves]]'' (''The Wrecks'') ([[Brussels]], 1866). Another edition of ''Les Fleurs du mal'', without these poems, but with considerable additions, appeared in 1861. Many notables rallied behind Baudelaire and condemned the sentence. [[Victor Hugo]] wrote to him: &quot;Your ''fleurs du mal'' shine and dazzle like stars... I applaud your vigorous spirit with all my might&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;yvjown&quot;&gt;Richardson 1994, p.250.&lt;/ref&gt; Baudelaire did not appeal the judgment but his fine was reduced. Nearly 100 years later, on May 11, 1949, Baudelaire was vindicated, the judgment officially reversed, and the six banned poems reinstated in France.&lt;ref name = &quot;yvjown&quot;/&gt;

In the poem &quot;Au lecteur&quot; (&quot;To the Reader&quot;) that prefaces ''Les Fleurs du mal'', Baudelaire accuses his readers of [[hypocrisy]] and of being as guilty of [[sin]]s and lies as the poet:

:...If rape or arson, poison or the knife
:Has wove no pleasing patterns in the stuff
:Of this drab canvas we accept as life—
:It is because we are not bold enough!
::([[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]]'s translation)

===Final years===
Baudelaire next worked on a translation and adaptation of [[Thomas de Quincey]]'s ''[[Confessions of an English Opium Eater]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p.311.&lt;/ref&gt; Other works in the years that followed included ''[[Le Spleen de Paris|Petits Poèmes en prose]]'' (''Small [[prose poetry|Prose poems]]''); a series of art reviews published in the ''Pays, Exposition universelle'' (''Country, World Fair''); studies on [[Gustave Flaubert]] (in ''[[L'Artiste]]'', October 18, 1857); on [[Théophile Gautier]] (''Revue contemporaine'', September 1858); various articles contributed to Eugene Crepet's ''Poètes francais''; ''Les Paradis artificiels: opium et haschisch'' (''French poets; Artificial Paradises: opium and hashish'') (1860); and ''Un Dernier Chapitre de l'histoire des oeuvres de Balzac'' (''A Final Chapter of the history of works of Balzac'') (1880), originally an article &quot;Comment on paye ses dettes quand on a du génie&quot; (&quot;How one pays one's debts when one has genius&quot;), in which his criticism turns against his friends [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Théophile Gautier]], and [[Gérard de Nerval]].
[[Image:Jeanne Duval.JPG|thumb|left|[[Jeanne Duval]], in a painting by [[Édouard Manet]]]]
[[File:Apollonie Sabatier-Vincent Vidal.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Apollonie Sabatier]], muse and one time mistress, painted by [[Vincent Vidal]].]]

By 1859, his illnesses, his long-term use of [[laudanum]], his life of stress and poverty had taken a toll and Baudelaire had aged noticeably. But at last, his mother relented and agreed to let him live with her for a while at [[Honfleur]]. Baudelaire was productive and at peace in the seaside town, his poem ''Le Voyage'' being one example of his efforts during that time.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p.281.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, he became an ardent supporter of [[Richard Wagner]].

His financial difficulties increased again, however, particularly after his publisher Poulet Malassis went bankrupt in 1861. In 1864, he left Paris for Belgium, partly in the hope of selling the [[copyright|rights]] to his works and also to give lectures.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; His long-standing relationship with [[Jeanne Duval]] continued on-and-off, and he helped her to the end of his life. Baudelaire's relationships with actress Marie Daubrun and with courtesan [[Apollonie Sabatier]], though the source of much inspiration, never produced any lasting satisfaction. He smoked [[opium]], and in Brussels he began to [[alcoholism|drink to excess]]. Baudelaire suffered a massive [[stroke]] in 1866 and [[paralysis]] followed. After more than a year of [[aphasia]], he received the [[last rites]] of the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/baudelaire/englishintro.html Library.vanderbilt.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The last two years of his life were spent, in a semi-paralyzed state, in &quot;maisons de santé&quot; in Brussels and in Paris, where he died on August 31, 1867. Baudelaire is buried in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]], Paris.

Many of Baudelaire's works were published posthumously. After his death, his mother paid off his substantial debts, and at last she found some comfort in Baudelaire's emerging fame. &quot;I see that my son, for all his faults, has his place in literature&quot;.  She lived another four years.

==Critiques==
Baudelaire was an active participant in the artistic life of his times. As critic and essayist, he wrote extensively and perceptively about the luminaries and themes of French culture. He was frank with friends and enemies, rarely took the diplomatic approach and sometimes responded violently verbally, which often undermined his cause.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p.268.&lt;/ref&gt; His associations were numerous and included: [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Champfleury]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Balzac]] and the artists and writers that follow.

===Edgar Allan Poe===
In 1846 and 1847, Baudelaire became acquainted with the works of [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], in which he found tales and poems that had, he claimed, long existed in his own brain but never taken shape. Baudelaire had much in common with Poe (who died in 1849 at age forty). The two poets display a similar sensibility of the [[macabre]] and supernatural turn of mind; each struggled with illness, poverty, and melancholy. Like Poe, Baudelaire believed in the doctrine of [[original sin]], denounced democracy and the idea of progress and of man's natural goodness, and Poe held a disdainful aristocratic attitude similar to Baudelaire's [[dandy]].&lt;ref&gt;Baudelaire, Selected writings on art and artists, CUP Archive, 1981, Introduction, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; Baudelaire saw in Poe a precursor and tried to be his French contemporary counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1994, p.140.&lt;/ref&gt; From this time until 1865, he was largely occupied with translating Poe's works; his translations were widely praised. Baudelaire was not the first French translator of Poe, but his &quot;scrupulous translations&quot; were considered among the best. These were published as ''Histoires extraordinaires'' (''Extraordinary stories'') (1852), ''Nouvelles histoires extraordinaires'' (''New extraordinary stories'') (1857), ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket|Aventures d'Arthur Gordon Pym]]'', ''[[Eureka: A Prose Poem|Eureka]]'', and ''Histoires grotesques et sérieuses'' (''Grotesque and serious stories'') (1865). Two [[essay]]s on Poe are to be found in his ''Oeuvres complètes'' (''Complete works'') (vols. v. and vi.).

===Eugène Delacroix===
A strong supporter of the Romantic painter [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], Baudelaire called him &quot;a poet in painting.&quot; Baudelaire also absorbed much of Delacroix's aesthetic ideas as expressed in his journals. As Baudelaire elaborated in his &quot;Salon of 1846&quot;, &quot;As one contemplates his series of pictures, one seems to be attending the celebration of some grievous mystery... This grave and lofty melancholy shines with a dull light... plaintive and profound like a melody by Weber&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;crapkq&quot;/&gt; Delacroix, though appreciative, kept his distance from Baudelaire, particularly after the scandal of ''Les Fleurs du mal''. In private correspondence, Delacroix stated that Baudelaire &quot;really gets on my nerves&quot; and he expressed his unhappiness with Baudelaire's persistent comments about &quot;melancholy&quot; and &quot;feverishness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lois Boe Hyslop, ''Baudelaire, Man Of His Time'', Yale University Press, 1980, p.14, ISBN 0-300-02513-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard Wagner===
Baudelaire had no formal musical training, and knew little of composers beyond [[Beethoven]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber]]. Weber was in some ways [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s precursor, using the [[leitmotif]] and conceiving the idea of the &quot;total art work&quot; (&quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;), both of which found Baudelaire's admiration. Before even hearing Wagner's music, Baudelaire studied reviews and essays about him, and formulated his impressions. Later, Baudelaire put them into his non-technical analysis of Wagner, which was highly regarded, particularly his essay &quot;Richard Wagner et Tannhäuser à Paris&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;yhkyza&quot;&gt;Hyslop (1980), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Baudelaire's reaction to music was passionate and psychological. &quot;Music engulfs (possesses) me like the sea&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;yhkyza&quot;/&gt; After attending three Wagner concerts in Paris in 1860, Baudelaire wrote to the composer: &quot;I had a feeling of pride and joy in understanding, in being possessed, in being overwhelmed, a truly sensual pleasure like that of rising in the air&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop (1980), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Baudelaire's writings contributed to the elevation of Wagner and to the cult of [[Wagnerism]] that swept Europe in the following decades.

===Théophile Gautier===
[[Théophile Gautier|Gautier]], writer and poet, earned Baudelaire's respect for his perfection of form and his mastery of language, though Baudelaire thought he lacked deeper emotion and spirituality. Both strove to express the artist's inner vision, which [[Heinrich Heine]] had earlier stated: &quot;In artistic matters, I am a supernaturalist. I believe that the artist can not find all his forms in nature, but that the most remarkable are revealed to him in his soul&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop (1980), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Gautier's frequent meditations on death and the horror of life are themes which influenced Baudelaire writings. In gratitude for their friendship and commonality of vision, Baudelaire dedicated ''Les Fleurs du mal'' to Gautier.

===Édouard Manet===
[[Édouard Manet|Manet]] and Baudelaire became constant companions from around 1855. In the early 1860s, Baudelaire accompanied Manet on daily sketching trips and often met him socially. Manet also lent Baudelaire money and looked after his affairs, particularly when Baudelaire went to Belgium. Baudelaire encouraged Manet to strike his own path and not succumb to criticism. &quot;Manet has great talent, a talent which will stand the test of time. But he has a weak character. He seems to me crushed and stunned by shock&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop (1980), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In his painting ''[[Music in the Tuileries]]'', Manet includes portraits of his friends [[Théophile Gautier]], [[Jacques Offenbach]], and Baudelaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Music in the Tuileries Gardens | publisher = [[National Gallery (London)|The National Gallery]] | url = http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng3260 | accessdate = 2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it's difficult to differentiate who influenced whom, both Manet and Baudelaire discussed and expressed some common themes through their respective arts. Baudelaire praised the modernity of Manet's subject matter: &quot;almost all our originality comes from the stamp that 'time' imprints upon our feelings&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop (1980), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; When Manet's famous ''[[Olympia (painting)|Olympia]]'' (1865), a portrait of a nude prostitute, provoked a scandal for its blatant realism mixed with an imitation of [[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Renaissance motifs]], Baudelaire worked privately to support his friend, though he offered no public defense (he was, however, ill at the time). When Baudelaire returned from Belgium after his stroke, Manet and his wife were frequent visitors at the nursing home and she would play passages from Wagner for Baudelaire on the piano.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop (1980), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nadar===
[[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]] (Félix Tournachon) was a noted caricaturist, scientist and important early photographer. Baudelaire admired Nadar, one of his closest friends, and wrote: &quot;Nadar is the most amazing manifestation of vitality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop (1980), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; They moved in similar circles and Baudelaire made many social connections through him. Nadar's ex-mistress [[Jeanne Duval]] became Baudelaire's mistress around 1842. Baudelaire became interested in [[photography]] in the 1850s and denounced it as an art form and advocated for its return to &quot;its real purpose, which is that of being the servant to the sciences and arts&quot;. Photography should not, according to Baudelaire, encroach upon &quot;the domain of the impalpable and the imaginary&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hyslop (1980), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Nadar remained a stalwart friend right to Baudelaire's last days and wrote his obituary notice in ''[[Le Figaro]]''.

==Philosophy==
Many of Baudelaire's philosophical proclamations were considered scandalous and intentionally provocative in his time. He wrote on a wide range of subjects, drawing criticism and outrage from many quarters.

===Love===
&quot;There is an invincible taste for prostitution in the heart of man, from which comes his horror of solitude. He wants to be 'two'. The man of genius wants to be 'one'... It is this horror of solitude, the need to lose oneself in the external flesh, that man nobly calls 'the need to love'.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;sncxdz&quot;&gt;Richardson 1994, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
&quot;Unable to suppress love, the Church wanted at least to disinfect it, and it created marriage.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;sncxdz&quot;/&gt;

===The artist===
&quot;The more a man cultivates the arts, the less randy he becomes... Only the brute is good at coupling, and copulation is the lyricism of the masses. To copulate is to enter into another–and the artist never emerges from himself.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;sncxdz&quot;/&gt;

&quot;Style is character&quot;

===Pleasure===
&quot;Personally, I think that the unique and supreme delight lies in the certainty of doing 'evil'–and men and women know from birth that all pleasure lies in evil.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;sncxdz&quot;/&gt;

===Politics===
Along with Poe, Baudelaire named the arch-[[reactionary]] [[Joseph de Maistre]] as his [[maître à penser]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.cambridge.org/052183/094X/excerpt/052183094X_excerpt.htm Assets.cambridge.org]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted increasingly aristocratic views. In his journals, he wrote &quot;There is no form of rational and assured government save an aristocracy. A monarchy or a republic, based upon democracy, are equally absurd and feeble. The immense nausea of advertisements. There are but three beings worthy of respect: the priest, the warrior and the poet. To know, to kill and to create. The rest of mankind may be taxed and drudged, they are born for the stable, that is to say, to practise what they call professions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=2005_Q3_1/uvaBook/tei/z000000101.xml;chunk.id=d32;toc.depth=1;toc.id=d32;brand=default XTF.lib.virginia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[Image:Gustave Courbet 033.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait by [[Gustave Courbet]], 1848.]]
Baudelaire's influence on the direction of modern French (and English) language literature was considerable. The most significant French writers to come after him were generous with tributes; four years after his death, [[Arthur Rimbaud]] praised him in a letter as 'the king of poets, a true God'.&lt;ref&gt;Rimbaud, Arthur: ''Oeuvres complètes'', p. 253, NRF/Gallimard, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1895, [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] published a sonnet in Baudelaire's memory, 'Le Tombeau de Charles Baudelaire'. [[Marcel Proust]], in an essay published in 1922, stated that along with [[Alfred de Vigny]], Baudelaire was 'the greatest poet of the nineteenth century'.&lt;ref&gt;'Concerning Baudelaire' in Proust, Marcel: ''Against Sainte-Beuve and Other Essays'', p. 286, trans. John Sturrock, Penguin, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the English-speaking world, [[Edmund Wilson]] credited Baudelaire as providing an initial impetus for the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] movement, by virtue of his translations of Poe.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edmund: ''Axel's Castle'', p. 20, Fontana, 1962 (originally published 1931).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1930, [[T. S. Eliot]], while asserting that Baudelaire had not yet received a &quot;just appreciation&quot; even in France, claimed that the poet had &quot;great genius&quot; and asserted that his &quot;technical mastery which can hardly be overpraised... has made his verse an inexhaustible study for later poets, not only in his own language&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;'Baudelaire', in Eliot, T. S.: ''Selected Essays'', pp. 422 and 425, Faber &amp; Faber, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot also alluded to Baudelaire's poetry directly ın his own poetry. For example, he quoted the last line of Baudelaire's 'Au Lecteur' ın the last line of Sectıon I of The Waste Land.

At the same time that Eliot was affirming Baudelaire's importance from a broadly [[Conservatism|conservative]] and explicitly [[Christianity|Christian]] viewpoint,&lt;ref&gt;cf. Eliot, 'Religion in Literature', in Eliot, op. cit., p.388.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] critics such as Wilson and [[Walter Benjamin]] were able to do so from a dramatically different perspective. Benjamin translated Baudelaire's ''[[Tableaux Parisiens]]'' into German and published a major essay on translation&lt;ref&gt;'The Task of the Translator', in Benjamin, Walter: ''Selected Writings Vol. 1: 1913–1926'', pp. 253–263, Belknap/Harvard, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; as the foreword.

In the late 1930s, Benjamin used Baudelaire as a starting point and focus for his monumental attempt at a [[Historical materialism|materialist]] assessment of 19th century culture, ''[[Arcades Project|Das Passagenwerk]].''&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Walter: ''The Arcades Project'', trans. Howard Eiland and Kevin McLaughlin, Belknap/Harvard, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  For Benjamin, Baudelaire's importance lay in his anatomies of the [[crowd]], of the city and of [[modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;'The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire' in Benjamin, Walter: ''Selected Writings Vol. 4 1938–1940'', pp. 3–92, Belknap/Harvard, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, avant-garde performance artist and vocalist [[Diamanda Galás]] recorded an adaptation of his poem ''[[The Litanies of Satan]]'' (''Les Litanies de Satan'').

The [[Baudelaire family|Baudelaires]], protagonists of Lemony Snicket's ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'', were named after him.

Currently, [[Vanderbilt University]] has &quot;assembled one of the world’s most comprehensive research collections on...Baudelaire.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/bandy/pdf/Baudelaire.pdf Library.vanderbilt.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;'''Casey at the Bat: A Ballad of the Republic Sung in the Year 1888'''&quot; is a [[baseball]] [[poetry|poem]] written in 1888 by [[Ernest Thayer]]. First published in ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'' on June 3, 1888, it was later popularized by [[DeWolf Hopper]] in many [[vaudeville]] performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_case.shtml Baseball Almanac]&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem was originally published anonymously (under the [[pen name]] &quot;Phin&quot;, based on Thayer's college nickname, &quot;Phineas&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;gardner&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Casey at the bat |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1967/6/1967_6_64.shtml |author=Martin Gardner |authorlink=Martin Gardner |publisher=American Heritage dot com |date=October 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author's identity was not widely known at first. A number falsely claimed to have authored the poem, and Thayer's efforts to set the record straight were often ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thayer, Ernest Lawrence |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/16/16-03512.html |author=Ann T. Keene |publisher=American National Biography Online |date=September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
A baseball team from the fictional town of ''Mudville'' (implied to be the home team) is losing by two [[Run (baseball)|runs]] with two [[Out (baseball)|outs]] in their last inning.  Both the team and its fans (in the poem, about 5,000 attended the game) believe they can win &quot;if only&quot; they could somehow get &quot;Mighty Casey&quot; (Mudville's star player) up to bat.  However, Casey was scheduled to be the fifth batter of the inning &amp;ndash; the first two batters (Cooney and Barrows) did not reach base, while the next two batters (Flynn and Jimmy Blake) were perceived to be weak hitters with little chance of reaching base to allow Casey an at bat.

Surprisingly, Flynn hits a single, and Jimmy Blake follows with a double (Flynn reaching third on the play).  Both runners were now in scoring position and Casey represented the potential winning run. However, Casey is so confident in his abilities that he doesn't swing at the first two pitches, both strikes. On the last pitch, the overconfident Casey [[Strikeout|strikes out]], ending the game and sending the crowd home unhappy.

==Text==
The text is filled with references to baseball as it was in 1888, which in many ways is not far removed from today's version. As a work, the poem encapsulates much of the appeal of baseball, including the involvement of the crowd. It also has a fair amount of baseball jargon that can pose challenges for the uninitiated.

This is the complete poem as it originally appeared in ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'', with commentary. After publication, multiple versions with minor changes were produced.  The text without commentary is available at the Wikisource link elsewhere in this article.

:The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville Nine that day;
:The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,
:And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,
:A sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game.

:::''The &quot;Mudville Nine&quot; could stand (by the use of [[synecdoche]]) for any baseball team. It also reflects a time when substitutions were not allowed except in cases of injury.

:::''&quot;One inning more to play&quot; in standard baseball jargon means that the home team has one set of at-bats remaining: the poem is set just before the start of Mudville's final turn (of a regulation game), in the ninth inning.

:::''A player &quot;dying&quot; at a base means he was put out. There are only three outs per team in an inning in baseball, so one more out would end the game (with Mudville losing).''

:A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest
:Clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast;
:They thought, if only Casey could get but a whack at that -
:We'd put up even money, now, with Casey at the bat.

:::''The second line above is an allusion to Alexander  Pope's ''[[An Essay on Man]]'' (1734), which contains the line &quot;Hope springs eternal in the human breast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/1637.html Line 95] in &quot;[[An Essay on Man]]: Epistle I&quot; by [[Alexander Pope]] (1688-1744)&lt;/ref&gt;''

:But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,
:And the former was a lulu and the latter was a cake;
:So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,
:For there seemed but little chance of Casey's getting to the bat.

:::''Gardner asserts that &quot;lulu&quot; (as in &quot;humdinger&quot;) is being used ironically in this case. The original version of the poem used &quot;lulu&quot; and &quot;cake&quot; to describe Flynn and Blake.  &quot;Cake&quot; was taken to mean someone who was vain and not particularly &quot;manly,&quot; whereas a &quot;lulu&quot; in baseball slang of the period was &quot;an unskilled player&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Evan. [http://www.word-detective.com/2009/03/10/hoodoo-cake/&quot;Hoodoo &amp; Cake,&quot; The Word Detective (March 2009).] Accessed May 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In any case, Flynn and Blake were perceived to be poor hitters; thus, the crowd believed that Casey had little chance for a potential game-winning at bat.''

:But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,
:And Blake, the much despis-ed, tore the cover off the ball;
:And when the dust had lifted, and the men saw what had occurred,
:There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.

:::''Although the term &quot;men&quot; is often used generically in English, in those days baseball was largely attended by men. If women attended, they were often isolated to a section away from the men, supposedly to distance them from any vulgarities that the male spectators (or players) might speak. However, the phrase &quot;the men&quot; breaks the meter of the line, and later versions simply say &quot;they&quot;.

:::''In the original version, a printer's error said &quot;Johnnie&quot; was safe at second. Later versions corrected it to &quot;Jimmy&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

:Then from 5,000 throats and more there rose a lusty yell;
:It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;
:It knocked upon the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,
:For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.

:There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;
:There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile on Casey's face.
:And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,
:No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat.

:Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;
:Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt.
:Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,
:Defiance gleamed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.

:And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,
:And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.
:Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped-
:&quot;That ain't my style,&quot; said Casey. &quot;Strike one,&quot; the umpire said.

:::''Taking the first or even the second strike without swinging is not unusual.  The batter may wish to evaluate a new pitcher (though the text does not indicate a pitching change),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.checkswing.com/profiles/blogs/dont-swing-at-the-first-pitch Don't swing at the first pitch - CheckSwing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to take advantage of a pitcher who may be experiencing control problems (especially after giving up two hits to two weak hitters), or to see if the pitcher may be trying to &quot;pitch around&quot; him to reach the next batter (with first base open, a walk doesn't immediately result in a run scored, and also sets up a potential force out at any base including home plate; the risk being the next hitter may feel that the pitcher considers him to be &quot;weak&quot; compared to Casey and try harder to produce a run).  However, it appears Casey was ignoring the pitch, not as a sound baseball tactic, but out of pride for his abilities.

:From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,
:Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore.''
:&quot;Kill him! Kill the umpire!&quot; shouted someone on the stand;
:And it's likely they'd a-killed him had not Casey raised his hand.

:With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;
:He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;
:He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the spheroid flew;
:But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, &quot;Strike two.&quot;

:&quot;Fraud!&quot; cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered fraud;
:But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.
:They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,
:And they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again.

:The sneer is gone from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate;
:He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.
:And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,
:And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.

:Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;
:The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,
:And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;
:But there is no joy in Mudville &amp;mdash; mighty Casey has struck out.

==Mudville==
A rivalry of sorts has developed between two cities claiming to be the Mudville described in the poem.

[[Image:Holliston-mudville-casey-statue.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Holliston, MA - Mudville Village, Statue and Plaque Dedicated to &quot;Casey&quot; of &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot;]]
[[Image:Holliston-mudville-welcome-gate.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Holliston, MA - Mudville Village, Welcome Gate]]
[[Image:Holliston-mudville-welcome-sign.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Holliston, MA - Mudville Village, Welcome Sign]]
Residents of [[Holliston, Massachusetts]], where there is a neighborhood called Mudville, claim it as the Mudville described in the poem. Thayer grew up in nearby [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], where he wrote the poem in 1888; his family owned a woolen mill less than a mile from Mudville's baseball field.

However, residents of [[Stockton, California]] — which was known for a time as Mudville prior to incorporation in 1850 — also lay claim to being the inspiration for the poem. In 1887, Thayer covered baseball for ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'' — owned by his Harvard classmate [[William Randolph Hearst]] — and is said to have covered the local [[California League]] team, the [[Stockton Ports]]. For the [[1902 in baseball|1902]] season, after the poem became popular, Stockton's team was renamed the Mudville Nine. The team reverted to the Mudville Nine moniker for the 2000 and 2001 seasons. The [[Visalia Rawhide]], another California League team, currently keep Mudville alive by playing in Mudville jerseys on June&amp;nbsp;3 each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Stockton_Mudville_Nine baseball-reference.com, accessed June 7, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the towns' rival claims, Thayer himself told the ''[[Syracuse Post-Standard]]'' that &quot;the poem has no basis in fact.&quot;

Residents of [[Marshalltown, Iowa]] (home of Hall of Famer [[Cap Anson]]) often refer to their town as Mudville, though possibly for reasons of irreverence having little to do with Anson's former residency.

==Impact on popular culture==
For a relatively short poem apparently dashed off quickly (and denied by its author for years), &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; had a profound effect on American popular culture. It has been [[Casey at the Bat#Live performances|recited]], re-enacted, [[Casey at the Bat#Other versions|adapted]], dissected, parodied and subjected to just about every other treatment one could imagine.&lt;ref name=&quot;gardner&quot; /&gt;

===Plagiarism===
A month after the poem was published, it was reprinted as &quot;Kelly at the Bat&quot; in the ''[[New York Sporting Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Aside from leaving off the first five verses, the only changes from the original are substitutions of Kelly for Casey, and [[Boston]] for Mudville. [[King Kelly|Mike &quot;King&quot; Kelly]], then of the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Beaneaters]], was one of baseball's two biggest stars at the time (along with [[Cap Anson]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg, Howard W.|title= Cap Anson 2: The Theatrical and Kingly Mike Kelly: U.S. Team Sport's First Media Sensation and Baseball's Original Casey at the Bat|publisher=Tile Books|year=2004|pages=438|isbn=0972557415|url= http://www.amazon.com/Cap-Anson-Theatrical-Sensation-Baseballs/dp/0972557415}}, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, &quot;Current Literature&quot; noted the two versions and said, &quot;The locality, as originally given, is Mudville, not Boston; the latter was substituted to give the poem local color.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 9, citing Current Literature 21 (January 1897): 96, which, in part, referred to &quot;T. J. M.&quot; to Current Literature, undated, in Current Literature 20 (December 1896): 576; Current Literature 21 (February 1897): 129; and Jim Moore and Natalie Vermilyea, Ernest Thayer's 'Casey at the Bat': Background and Characters of Baseball's Most Famous Poem (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 1994), pp. 2, 234, 235 and 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live performances===
[[DeWolf Hopper]] gave the poem's first stage recitation on August 14, 1888, at [[New York City|New York's]] [[Wallack Theatre]] as part of the [[comic opera]] ''[[Prinz Methusalem]]'' in the presence of the Chicago and New York baseball teams, the [[Chicago Cubs|White Stockings]] and the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]]; August 14, 1888 was also Thayer's 25th birthday. Hopper became known as an orator of the poem, and recited it more than 10,000 times (by his count—some tabulations are as much as four times higher) before his death.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Gardner|title=Casey at the Bat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On stage in the early 1890s, baseball star Kelly recited the original &quot;Casey&quot; a few dozen times and not the parody. For example, in a review of a variety show he was in, in 1893, the Indianapolis News said, &quot;Many who attended the performance had heard of Kelly's singing and his reciting, and many had heard De Wolf Hopper recite 'Casey at the Bat' in his inimitable way.  Kelly recited this in a sing-song, school-boy fashion.&quot;  Upon Kelly's death, a writer would say he gained “considerable notoriety by his ludicrous rendition of 'Casey at the Bat,' with which he concluded his `turn’ [act] at each performance.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, the magic/comedy team [[Penn &amp; Teller]] performed a version of &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; with Teller (the &quot;silent&quot; partner) struggling to escape a [[straitjacket]] while suspended upside-down over a platform of sharp steel spikes. The set-up was that if [[Penn Jillette]] reached the end of the poem before [[Teller (entertainer)|Teller]]'s escape, he would leap off of his chair, releasing the rope which supported Teller, and send his partner to a gruesome death.  The drama of the performance was taken up a notch after the third or fourth stanza, when Penn Jillette would read out the rest of the poem much faster than the opening stanzas, greatly reducing the time that Teller had left to work free from his bonds.

On July 4, 2008 Jack Williams recited the poem accompanied by the [[Boston Pops]] during the annual Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular at Boston's 4 July Celebration.

===Thayer's speculative inspiration: Kelly===
In 1887, National League star Kelly became famous—arguably the first baseball player to become so overnight—when Boston paid Chicago a record $10,000 for him. He had a personality that fans liked to cheer or jeer. He also is associated with &quot;Casey at the Bat,&quot; and a once well-known song and expression for avoiding danger, such as being tagged out: &quot;Slide, Kelly, Slide!&quot; In 1927, an MGM silent movie with a baseball theme was called “Slide, Kelly, Slide.&quot;

As of 1887, Kelly was especially known as the &quot;$10,000 Beauty.&quot; In 1881, actress Louise Montague had been so dubbed after winning a $10,000 contest for handsomest woman in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, pp. 121-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1887 season, Kelly went on a playing tour to San Francisco. Thayer, who would write &quot;Casey&quot; in 1888, covered the San Francisco leg for the ''San Francisco Examiner''. Although Thayer said he literally chose the name &quot;Casey&quot; after a non-player of Irish ancestry he once knew, open to debate is who, if anyone, he modeled Casey's baseball situations after. The best big league candidate is Kelly, the most colorful, top player of the day of Irish ancestry.  Thayer, in a letter he wrote in 1905, singles out Kelly as showing &quot;impudence&quot; in claiming to have written the poem. If he still felt offended, Thayer may have steered later comments away from connecting Kelly to it. The author of the 2004 definitive bio of Kelly – which included a close tracking of his vaudeville career—did not find Kelly claiming to have been the author.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|title=Cap Anson 2}}, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the playing tour, Kelly's plans to go on it had drawn colorful comment in San Francisco.  In August, the San Francisco Call said, &quot;My, what a time the small boy will have following him around the streets, styling their nines the 'Only Kells,' and asking him how he liked [new National Leaguer George Van Haltren, who was living in the offseason in San Francisco].  But it is a great thing to be distinguished, you know.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg&quot;/&gt;

Also, while Kelly was in San Francisco on the tour, the $10,000 check arrived with which Boston had bought him. It will &quot;at once be placed on exhibition in a prominent show window,&quot; the San Francisco Chronicle said. &quot;The check bears the names of [Boston club President] A. H. Soden of Boston as payer and [Chicago club President] A. G. Spalding of Chicago as payee.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg&quot;/&gt;

===Recorded recitations===

 |description=Recited by DeWolf Hopper, c. 1920.
 |format=[[Ogg]] }}

The first recorded version of &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; was narrated by [[Russell Hunting]] in a broad Irish accent in 1893; an [http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/search.php?queryType=@attr+1=1020&amp;num=1&amp;start=1&amp;query=cylinder5348 1898 cylinder recording of the text made for the Columbia Graphophone label by Hunting] can be accessed from the [[Cylinder Preservation and Digitization Project]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] Library.

[[DeWolf Hopper]]'s more famous recorded recitation was released in October 1906.

In the late 1940s, [[Walt Disney]] released a recording of the narration of the poem by [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]], which accompanied the studio's [[animated cartoon]] adaptation of the poem (see below).

===Adaptations===
The first film adaptation of the poem was ''[[Casey at the Bat (1927 film)|Casey at the Bat]],'' a 1927 movie starring [[Wallace Beery]] as Casey.

There have been two [[animated film]] adaptations of the poem by [[Walt Disney]]: &quot;[[Make Mine Music|Casey at the Bat]]&quot; ([[1946 in film|1946]]), which uses the original text (but set in 1902 according to the opening song's lyrics, instead of 1888). This version is recited by [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]], as is a sequel (see below).

Art-song composer [[Sidney Homer]] turned the poem into a song. Sheet music was published by G. Schirmer in 1920 as part of ''Six Cheerful Songs to Poems of American Humor.''

&quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; was adapted into a 1953 [[opera]] by American composer [[William Schuman]]. [[Allen Feinstein]] composed an adaptation for orchestra with a narrator. An orchestral adaptation by composer [[Frank Proto]] has been recorded by the [[Cincinnati Pops]] orchestra conducted by [[Erich Kunzel]] with baseball star [[Johnny Bench]] narrating. The Dallas Symphony commissioned an arrangement of &quot;Casey&quot; by Randol Alan Bass in 2001 which he later arranged for concert band.  A version for wind band and narrator by Donald Shirer based on &quot;[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]&quot; had its world premiere in July 2008.

[[Jackie Gleason]] in his &quot;Reginald Van Gleason III&quot; persona (in full Mudville baseball uniform) performed a recitation of the poem on his television show during the 1950s.

[[Wallace Tripp]] illustrated a popular 1978 book of the poem.

In 1986, [[Elliott Gould]] starred as &quot;Casey&quot; in the ''[[Shelley Duvall]]'s Tall Tales and Legends'' adaptation of the story, which also starred [[Carol Kane]], [[Howard Cosell]], [[Bob Uecker]], [[Bill Macy]] and [[Rae Dawn Chong]]. The screenplay, adapted from the poem, was written by [[Andy Borowitz]] and the production was directed by [[David Steinberg]].

In 2000, Michael J. Farrand adapted the rhyming scheme, tone, and theme of the poem—while reversing the outcome—to create his poem &quot;The Man Who Gave All the Dreamers in Baseball Land Bigger Dreams to Dream&quot; about [[Kirk Gibson]]'s home run off [[Dennis Eckersley]] in Game 1 of the 1988 [[World Series]].  The poem appears at the [[Baseball Almanac]].

In 2008, the Central Mountain High School Wildcat Percussion performed a show based on the poem, with a twist ending that resulted in Casey being drug tested and the results showing him pregnant. Both events were satirized from the MLB steroid controversy and the Thomas Beatie pregnancy.

===Sequels===
&quot;Casey's Revenge&quot;, by [[Grantland Rice]] (1906), gives Casey another chance against the pitcher who had struck him out in the original story. (''The Official Encyclopedia of Baseball'' by Turkin and Thompson attributes this version to James Wilson, not Rice.) In this version, Rice cites the nickname &quot;Strike-Out Casey&quot;, hence the influence on [[Casey Stengel]]'s name. Casey's team is down ''three'' runs by the last of the ninth, and once again Casey is down to two strikes—with the bases full this time. However, he connects, hits the ball so far that it is never found, and the final stanza reads:

:Oh! somewhere in this favored land dark clouds may hide the sun;
:And somewhere bands no longer play and children have no fun;
:And somewhere over blighted loves there hangs a heavy pall;
:But Mudville hearts are happy now--for Casey hit the ball.

In response to the popularity of the 1946 [[Walt Disney]] adaptation starring [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]] (see above), Disney released a sequel, &quot;Casey Bats Again&quot; ([[1954 in film|1954]]), in which Casey's nine daughters redeem his reputation.

In 1988, on the 100th anniversary of the poem, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer [[Frank Deford]] constructed a fanciful story (later expanded to book form) which posited Katie Casey, the subject of the song &quot;[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]&quot;, as being the daughter of the famous slugger from the poem.

In 2010, Ken Eagle wrote “The Mudville Faithful,” covering a century of the Mudville nine's ups and downs since Casey struck out.  Faithful fans still root for the perpetually losing team, and are finally rewarded by a trip to the World Series, led by Casey's great-grandson who is also named Casey.

===Parodies===
''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' republished the original version of the poem in the 1950s with artwork by [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] and no alterations to the text. Later lampoons in ''Mad'' included &quot;'Cool' Casey at the Bat&quot; (1960), an interpretation of the poem in [[beatnik]] style, with artwork by [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]]; &quot;Casey at the Dice&quot; in 1969, about a professional gambler; &quot;Casey at the Talks&quot; in 1977, a &quot;modern&quot; version of the famed poem in which Mudville tries unsuccessfully to sign free agent Casey; &quot;Howard at the Mike,&quot; about [[Howard Cosell]]; &quot;Casey at the Byte&quot; (1985), a tale of a cocky young computer expert who accidentally erases the White House Budget Plan; &quot;Clooney as the Bat&quot;, a mockery of [[George Clooney]]'s role as [[Batman]] in ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman and Robin]]''; and in 2006 as &quot;Barry at the Bat&quot;, poking fun at [[Barry Bonds]]' alleged involvement in the [[BALCO]] scandal. Another parody takes place in [[Russia]], which ends with &quot;Kasey&quot; in a [[gulag]] prison. A &quot;Poetry Round Robin&quot; where famous poems are rewritten in the style of the next poet in line, featured Casey at the Bat as written by [[Edgar Allan Poe]].

[[Foster Brooks]] (&quot;the Lovable Lush&quot;) wrote &quot;Riley on the Mound&quot;, which recounts the story from the pitcher's perspective. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Radio performer [[Garrison Keillor]]'s parodic version of the poem&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_case7.shtml Casey at the Bat (Road Game) by Garrison Keillor on Baseball Almanac&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; reimagines the game as a road game, instead of a home game, for the Mudville team. The same events occur with Casey striking out in the ninth inning as in the original poem, but with everything told from the perspective of other team.

An episode of ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' featured a short titled &quot;Buster at the Bat&quot;, where [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]] provides narration as [[Babs and Buster Bunny|Buster]] goes up to bat. In this version, the first two strikes are due to Buster signing an autograph the first time and answering his cell phone the second time. However, in the end, Buster hits a home run, much to Sylvester's confusion; Buster replies, &quot;You were expecting me to strike out?! I'm the star of this show!&quot;

The poem was parodied again for an episode of ''[[Animaniacs]]'', this time with [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot|Wakko]] as the title character and Yakko narrating. Like Buster, Wakko also ends up unexpectedly hitting a home run.

In the ''[[Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'' episode &quot;The Return of the Nanobots&quot;, Cindy's poem is identical to the ending of &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; but replaces Mudville with Retroville and the last famed line with &quot;cause Jimmy is an idiot!&quot;

An episode of the show ''[[U.S. Acres]]'' titled &quot;Orson at the Bat&quot;  also parodied &quot;Casey&quot;.

[[The New York Times]] published a parody by Hart Seely and Frank Cammuso in which the poem was narrated by [[Phil Rizzuto]], a [[New York Yankees]] announcer who was known to veer off on tangents while calling the game. The poem was later published in Seely and Cammuso's book, ''2007 Eleven And Other American Comedies''.

A 1990 children's book called ''Mice at Bat'' by Kelly Oechsli is about a mouse named Casey, a rat, a cat, and two teams of baseball-playing mice that compete with each other, but after they clean up (and eat scraps of food from) a humans' baseball stadium.

In the ''[[Married... with Children]]'' episode &quot;Peggy Turns 300&quot;, As Al is about to break the bowling alley record of 256 held by his rival Puggy Weaver, he delivers the taunt: &quot;There is no joy in Pugville. Mighty Bundy shall strike out!&quot;

Issue #92 of the comic Fables employs a paraphrased version of &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; appropriating the character names to those of the Fable players. It is preceded by a mock apology to Ernest Thayer for the mangling of &quot;his beloved poem&quot;.

In 2010, the blog iowntheworld.com published a parody of Casey at the Bat titled &quot;Obama at the Bat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iowntheworld.com/blog/?p=18868 iOwnTheWorld.com » Blog Archive » Obama At The Bat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of this parody are unknown, except that the parody is hosted on The Department7's YouTube page &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/user/TheDepartment7 YouTube - Kanaal van TheDepartment7&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translations===
There are three known translations of the poem into a foreign language, one in French, written in 2007 by French Canadian linguist Paul Laurendeau, with the title ''Casey au bâton'', and two in Hebrew. One by the sports journalist Menachem Less titled &quot;התור של קייסי לחבוט&quot; [Hator Shel Casey Lachbot],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoops.co.il/index.asp?page=ViewEL&amp;id=98|בלאדת הספורט הגדולה מכולן!]&lt;/ref&gt; and the other more recent and more true to the original cadence and style by Jason H.

==''Casey'' in other media==
===Names===
On page 11 of his autobiography ''Casey at the Bat: The Story of My Life in Baseball'' (Random House, 1962), [[Casey Stengel]] describes how his nickname of &quot;K.C.&quot; (for his hometown, [[Kansas City, Missouri]]) evolved into &quot;Casey&quot;. It was influenced not just by name of the poem, which was widely popular in the 1910s, but also because he tended to strike out frequently in his early career so fans and writers started calling him &quot;strikeout Casey&quot;.

===Books===
*Ralph Andreano's 1965 book, ''No Joy in Mudville'' laments the dearth of heroes in modern baseball.
*In the book ''Faithful'' by Steward O'Nan and Stephen King, describing the 2004 season of the Boston Red Sox, there is a chapter contributed by King, named &quot;The Gloom is gone from Mudville&quot;.
*Kurtis Scaletta's 2009 children's novel, ''Mudville'' is about a town where it's been raining for 22 years, delaying a baseball game between two rival towns.

===Film===
* In 1922, [[Lee De Forest]] recorded DeWolf Hopper reciting the poem in DeForest's [[Phonofilm]] sound-on-film process.
* In 1927, a feature-length [[silent film]] ''[[Casey at the Bat (1927 film)|Casey at the Bat]]'' was released, starring [[Wallace Beery]], [[Ford Sterling]], and [[ZaSu Pitts]].
* A reference to the poem occurs in ''[[Short Cuts]]'' (1993).
*In the film ''[[What Women Want]]'' (2000), Mel Gibson's character tries to block out his daughter's thoughts by muttering the poem under his breath.

===Television===
The poem has been referenced in many television shows. One example is an episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[The Mighty Casey]]'', concerning a baseball player who is actually a robot. Another instance is from ''[[Greek (TV series)|Greek]]'', when Rusty Cartwright as the catcher in a softball game, quotes a line as his sister Casey steps up to the plate. In the ''[[Northern Exposure]]'' episode 'The Graduate' Chris Stevens gains his Masters degree in Comparative Literature by subjecting his assessors to a spirited re-enactment of the poem. Also, in the TV series One Tree Hill, an episode is focused around a baseball event that replicates the poem (with a voiceover of the poem), however with a twist.

===Music===
*[[William Schuman]] composed an opera, ''The Mighty Casey'' (1953), based on the poem.
*The song ''No Joy in Mudville'' from [[Death Cab for Cutie]]'s album ''[[We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes]]'' directly references the poem.
*The song &quot;[[Rocky Mountain Way]]&quot; by [[Joe Walsh]] includes the line, &quot;The bases are loaded and Casey's at bat.&quot;.
*The song &quot;Felicia&quot; on the [[Straight On Till Morning]] album by [[Blues Traveler]] includes the line &quot;I wouldn't feel so much like Casey who never got to bat.&quot;
*The song &quot;[[Centerfield]]&quot; by [[John Fogerty]] includes the line &quot;Well, I spent some time in the Mudville Nine, watchin' it from the bench. You know I took some lumps when the Mighty Case struck out.&quot;
*The song &quot;To the Dogs or Whoever&quot; by [[Josh Ritter]] includes the stanza &quot;Was it [[Casey Jones]] or Casey at the Bat who died out of pride and got famous for that? Killed by a swerve, laid low by the curve, do you ever think they ever thought they got what they deserved?&quot;

===Games===
The poem is referenced in the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] game ''[[EarthBound]]'', where a weapon is named the Casey Bat, which is powerful but inaccurate.

===Theme park===
Casey's Corner is a baseball-themed restaurant in [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]], which serves primarily hotdogs. Pictures of Casey and the pitcher from the Disney animated adaptation are hanging on the walls, and a life-size statue of a baseball player identified as &quot;Casey&quot; stands just outside the restaurant. Additionally, the scoreboard in the restaurant shows that Mudville lost to the visitors by two runs, reflecting the outcome of the game in the poem.

There is a game called Casey at the Bat in the Games of the Boardwalk at the [[Disneyland Resort]]'s [[Disney's California Adventure Park|Disney's California Adventure]].

===Postage stamp===
On July 11, 1996, the [[United States Postal Service]] issued a [[commemorative stamp]] depicting &quot;Mighty Casey.&quot;  The stamp was part of a set commemorating American [[folk hero]]es.  Other stamps in the set depicted [[Paul Bunyan]], [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]], and [[Pecos Bill]].

===Theatre===
The last verse of the poem is quoted in the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot; - the character Cliff Bradshaw recites it to Sally Bowles when they first meet.

The '''classical guitar''' — (also called the &quot;Spanish guitar&quot; or &quot;nylon string guitar&quot;) — is a 6-stringed [[plucked string instrument]] from the family of instruments called [[chordophone]]s. The classical guitar is well known for its comprehensive right hand technique, which allows the soloist to perform complex melodic and polyphonic material, in much the same manner as the [[piano]].

The phrase &quot;classical guitar&quot; is ambiguous in that it might refer at least three different concepts:
*the instrumental technique — the individual strings are usually plucked with the fingernails or rarely without nails.
*its historic repertoire — though this is of lesser importance, since any repertoire can be (and is) played on the classical guitar (additionally: classical guitarists are known to borrow from the repertoires of a wide variety of instruments)
*its shape, construction and material — ''modern classical guitar'' shape, or historic ''classical guitar'' shapes (e.g. early romantic guitars from France and Italy). A guitar family tree can be identified.&lt;ref name=&quot;guitar_family_tree&quot;&gt;{{ cite web

The name ''classical'' guitar does not mean that only [[classical music|classical repertoire]] is performed on it, although [[classical music]] is a part of the instrument's core repertoire (due to the guitar's long history); instead all kinds of music (folk, jazz, flamenco, etc.) are performed on it.

The term ''modern classical guitar'' is sometimes used to distinguish the classical guitar from older forms of guitar, which are in their broadest sense also called ''classical'', or more descriptively: ''early guitars''. Examples of early guitars include the 6-string early romantic guitar (ca. 1790 - 1880), and the earlier baroque guitars with 5 [[Course (music)|courses]].

Today's ''modern classical guitar'' is regarded as having been established from the late designs of the 19th century Spanish luthier [[Antonio Torres Jurado]]. Hence the modern classical guitar is sometimes called the &quot;Spanish guitar&quot;.

==Classical Guitar viewed from various contexts==
The classical guitar has a long history and one is able to distinguish various:
*instruments
*[[repertoire]] (composers and their compositions, [[arrangement]]s, improvisations)

Both instrument and repertoire can be viewed from a combination of various contexts:
*historical (chronological period of time)
**[[baroque guitar]] — 17th to mid 18th century
**[[romantic guitar|early romantic guitars]] — 19th century (for music from the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods)
**modern classical guitars
*geographical
**e.g. in the 19th century: Spanish guitars ([[Antonio Torres Jurado|Torres]]), and French guitars (René Lacôte, ...), etc.
*cultural/stylistic and social aspects
**e.g. baroque court music, 19th century opera and its influences, 19th century folk songs, Latin American music, etc.

Brief examples using the above classifications (historical, cultural/stylistic, social etc.), to show the colourful diversity of the classical guitar:
*[[Robert de Visée]] (ca. 1650–1725) with French Court music for baroque guitar and lute. He was the guitar player (''maître de guitare du Roy'') of [[Louis XIV of France]] at the court of [[Versailles]]. His works are influenced by hearing [[Jean-Baptiste de Lully]] (1632–1687) who was also engaged at the court of Louis XIV.
*[[Mauro Giuliani]] (1781–1829) with Italian/Viennese classical music for the 19th century so-called early romantic guitar. He was chamber-virtuoso of [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://books.google.de/books?id=_P4sAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA339&amp;dq=Mauro+Giuliani+Marie+Louise&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES | title= Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung: mit besonderer Rücksicht auf den österreichischen Kaiserstaat, 1823}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his works include strong influences from his visits to 19th century opera performances.
*[[Francisco Tárrega]] (1852–1909) of Spain. His intimate salon-style music is both romantic in character and includes charming character pieces such as polkas and waltzes. He even played for the [[Isabella II of Spain|Queen of Spain, Isabel II]]. From 1869, Tárrega used a guitar by [[Antonio de Torres]] (1817–1892).
*[[Agustín Barrios]] (1885–1944) from Paraguay, towards the end of his life using a modern classical guitar (his last instrument was a gift from [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|Queen Eugenia of Spain]] in 1935&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7118/is_200801/ai_n29836313/| title=Agustin Barrios's Jose Maria Dura Argente publisher= Acoustic Guitar; January 2008 by Federico Sheppard }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;). His music is romantic in style, with some works showing strong folkloric Paraguayan influences, shaped from his cultural background.
*[[Sergei Orekhov]] (Сергей Орехов) (1935–1998) with music for the Russian 7-string guitar. In his compositions and arrangements, he draws inspiration from his intimate knowledge of traditional Russian folk music and folk songs.

Interpreting works of a specific composer in a specific style requires an understanding of the historical cultural/stylistic and social aspects/influences, considering music an ''expressive'' art. This is often called the study of [[performance practice]], with attempts at historically informed performance (sometimes abbreviated HIP).

==Classical guitar from a historical perspective==
The classical guitar as an instrument today has access to repertoire that spans numerous chronological periods:
*renaissance
*baroque
*classical
*romantic
*modern (neo-classical, avant garde...)

===Instrument Aesthetics (Early guitars)===

While &quot;classical guitar&quot; is today mainly associated with the modern classical guitar design, there is an increasing interest in early guitars; and understanding the link between historical repertoire and the particular period guitar that was originally used to perform this repertoire.
*''Nowadays it is customary to play this repertoire on reproductions of instruments authentically modelled on concepts of musicological research with appropriate adjustments to techniques and overall interpretation. Thus over recent decades we have become accustomed to specialist artists with expertise in the art of vihuela (a 16th-century type of guitar popular in Spain), lute, Baroque guitar, 19th-century guitar, etc.''&lt;ref name=&quot;visee&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.111092&amp;catNum=8111092&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English|title= SEGOVIA, Andres: 1950s American Recordings, Vol. 4|publisher=Graham Wade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different types of guitars have different sound aesthetics, e.g. different colour-spectrum characteristics (the way the sound energy is spread in the fundamental frequency and the [[overtones]]), different response, etc. These differences are due to differences in construction, for example modern Spanish guitars usually use a different bracing (fan-bracing), than was used in earlier guitars (they had ladder-bracing); and a different voicing was used by the luthier. See [[Classical guitar making]] for more information.

It is interesting to note the historical parallel between musical styles (baroque, classical, romantic, Spanish nationalist, flamenco, jazz) and the style of &quot;sound aesthetic&quot; of the musical instruments used, for example: [[Robert de Visée]] played on a baroque guitar with a very different sound aesthetic than the guitars used by [[Mauro Giuliani]] and [[Luigi Legnani|Legnani]] - they used 19th century guitars. These guitars in turn sound different from the Spanish models used by Segovia, that are suited for interpretations of romantic-modern works such as [[Federico Moreno Torroba|Moreno Torroba]].

When considering the guitar from a historical perspective, the musical instrument used is just as important as the musical language and style of the particular period. As an example: It is impossible to play a historically informed [[Robert de Visée|de Visee]] or Corbetta (baroque guitarist-composers) on a modern classical guitar. The reason is that the baroque guitar used courses, which are two strings close together (in unision), that are plucked together. This gives baroque guitars an unmistakable sound characteristic and tonal texture that is an integral part of an interpretation. Additionally the sound aesthetic of the baroque guitar (with its strong overtone presence) is very different from modern Spanish-type guitars, as is shown below.

Today's overuse of Torres and post-Torres type Spanish guitars for repertoire of all periods is somewhat critically viewed: Torres and post-Torres style modern guitars (with their fan-bracing and design) have a thick and strong tone, very suitable for Spanish and modern-era repertoire. However they are considered too saturated in fundamental (opposed to overtone partials) for earlier repertoire (Classical/Romantic: Carulli, Sor, Giuliani, Mertz, ...; Baroque: de Visee, ...; etc.). ''&quot;Andres Segovia presented the Spanish guitar as a versatile model for all playing styles&quot;'',&lt;ref name=&quot;earlyromanticguitar.com&quot;/&gt; to the extent, that still today, ''&quot;many guitarists have tunnel-vision of the world of the guitar, coming from the modern Segovia tradition&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlyromanticguitar.com/erg/periodtechnique.htm Early Romantic Guitar Period Technique] by earlyromanticguitar.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Interestingly, while fan-braced Spanish (Torres, post-Torres style) instruments coexisted with traditional central European ladder-braced (19th century style) guitars at the beginning of the 20th century; the central European guitars eventually fell away. Some attribute this to the popularity of [[Andrés Segovia|Segovia]], considering him ''&quot;the catalyst for change toward the Spanish design and the so-called 'modern' school in the 1920's and beyond&quot;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlyromanticguitar.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.earlyromanticguitar.com/erg/timeperiod.htm Early Classical Guitar and Early Romantic Guitar Time Period] by earlyromanticguitar.com&lt;/ref&gt; The styles of music performed on ladder-braced guitars were becoming more and more unfashionable; and e.g. in Germany musicians were in part turning towards folkstyle music (Schrammel-music and the [[Contraguitar]]), but this only remained localized in Germany and Austria and was quickly unfashionable again, etc. On the other hand, Segovia was concertizing around the world, popularizing his Spanish guitar, as well as a new style of music in the 1920s: Spanish romantic-modern style, with guitar works by [[Federico Moreno Torroba|Moreno Torroba]], de Falla, etc. Some people consider it to have been this influence of Segovia, which eventually led to the domination of the Spanish instrument - factories all over the world began producing them in large numbers.

====Short overview of instrument characteristics====
*Vihuela, renaissance guitars and baroque guitars have a bright sound - rich in overtones - and their chords (double strings) give the sound a very particular texture.
*Early guitars of the classical and romantic period (early romantic guitars) have single strings but their design and voicing are still such that they have their tonal energy more in the overtones (but without starved fundamental), giving a bright intimate tone.
*Later in Spain a style of music emerged (Spanish) that favored a stronger fundamental:&lt;br /&gt;''With the change of music a stronger fundamental was demanded and the fan bracing system was approached. [...] the guitar tone has been changed from a transparent tone, rich in higher partials to a more &quot;broad&quot; tone with a strong fundamental.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speech.kth.se/music/publications/kma/papers/kma38-ocr.pdf Function, Construction and Quality of the Guitar]; 1983&lt;/ref&gt;
*Thus modern guitars with fan bracing (fan strutting) have a design and voicing that gives them a much more thick heavy sound, with far more tonal energy found in the fundamental.

==Classical Guitar history along style periods==
As was explained above, the classical guitar as an instrument today has access to repertoire that spans numerous style periods. This section attempts to provide an overview of some of these periods, their composers; and the guitars that were used in the particular period.

===Renaissance (Vihuela, Renaissance guitar)===
Composers of the Renaissance period include [[Luis de Milán]] and [[Alonso Mudarra]].
;Instruments
[[Vihuela]], Four course guitar

===Baroque===
Composers of French baroque include [[Robert de Visée]] and [[Francesco Corbetta]]. In Spain [[Gaspar Sanz]] was active.

===Classical and early romantic period===
[[Image:Guitaromanie.jpg|border|right|La Guitaromanie]]
During the period from approximately 1780 to 1850 the guitar was an extremely popular instrument with numerous composers and performers such as
*[[Filippo Gragnani]] (1767–1820)
*[[Antoine de Lhoyer]] (1768–1852)
*[[Ferdinando Carulli]] (1770–1841)
*[[Francesco Molino]] (1774–1847)
*[[Fernando Sor]] (1778–1839)
*Luigi Moretti (c. 1780-1850)
*[[Mauro Giuliani]] (1781–1829)
*[[Matteo Carcassi]] (1792–1853)
*[[Napoléon Coste]] (1805–1883)
*[[Johann Kaspar Mertz]] (1806–1856)
There is even an image from 1825 by Charles de Marescot entitled &quot;La Guitaromanie&quot;.

===Modern Period===
In the 20th century numerous different styles of music (using a classical guitar) emerged:

At the beginning of the 20th century (especially in the 1920s), [[Andrés Segovia]] popularized the modern Spanish classical guitar with a particular style of romantic-modern and neo-romantic music composed by [[Federico Moreno Torroba]], [[Manuel Ponce (composer)|Manuel Ponce]], [[Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco]], and [[Alexandre Tansman]]. These works were often dedicated to Segovia. This music can be called Segovia-repertoire, since it would not exist without Segovia. In the middle of the century, [[Luiz Bonfá]] popularized Brazilian musical styles such as the newly created Bossa Nova, which was successfully received by audiences in the USA.

The classical guitar repertoire also includes modern contemporary works – sometimes termed &quot;New Music&quot; – such as [[Brian Ferneyhough]]'s ''Kurze Schatten II'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edition-peters.com/search.php?keyword=Kurze%20Schatten%20II&amp;searchby=Kurze%20Schatten%20II ''Kurze Schatten II'' by Brian Ferneyhough] – Edition Peters ([http://soundandmusic.org/thecollection/files/scores/6634w.pdf score sample])&lt;/ref&gt; [[w:de:Rolf Riehm|Rolf Riehm]]'s ''Toccata Orpheus'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ricordishop.de/artikel/modus/2/volltext/Toccata+Orpheus ''Toccata Orpheus'' by Rolf Riehm] – Ricordi München (see [http://english.ricordi.de/riehm-rolf-werke.0.html also])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elliott Carter]]'s ''Changes'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Elliott-Carter-Changes/5117 ''Changes'' by Elliott Carter] – Boosey &amp; Hawkes&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cristóbal Halffter]]'s ''Codex I'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universaledition.com/HALFFTER-CODEX-1-S-Gtr-guitar-Cristobal-Halffter/sheet-music-and-more/detailview/UE13991/kid/310013 ''Codex I'' by Cristóbal Halffter] – Universal Edition ([http://www.spanisharts.com/musica/ampliaciones/chalfcg.htm score sample])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luciano Berio]]'s ''[[Sequenza XI]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universaledition.com/BERIO-SEQUENZA-X1-Gtr-for-Guitar-Luciano-Berio/sheet-music-and-more/detailview/UE19273/kid/310013 ''Sequenza XI'' by Luciano Berio] – Universal Edition&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurizio Pisati]]'s ''Sette Studi'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ricordi.it/pubblicazioni/pubblicazioni/import/archive/pisati-maurizio/7-studi-per-chit/?searchterm=Maurizio%20Pisati ''Sette Studi'' by Maurizio Pisati] – Ricordi ([http://contemporaryguitarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/interview-with-maurizio-pisati-second.html score sample])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurice Ohana]]'s ''Si Le Jour Paraît'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billaudot.com/en/catalog.php?cs=1&amp;dox=Maurice%20Ohana ''Si Le Jour Paraît'' by Maurice Ohana] – Billaudot&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sylvano Bussotti]]'s ''Rara (eco sierologico)'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ricordi.it/search?SearchableText=Rara+%28eco+sierologico%29 ''Rara (eco sierologico)'' by Sylvano Bussotti] – Ricordi&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Krenek]]'s ''Suite für Guitarre allein, Op. 164'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doblinger-musikverlag.at/Komp/cmp_detail.php?compID=88&amp;sp=2 ''Suite für Guitarre, Op. 164'' by Ernst Krenek] – Doblinger Musikverlag ([http://classicguitarmethod.com/blog/?page_id=474 score sample])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franco Donatoni]]'s ''Algo: Due pezzi per chitarra'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esz.mgsdcc.com/en/sc_edz.lasso?-Search&amp;-Database=edz_esz&amp;-Table=base&amp;id=42545 ''Algo: Due pezzi per chitarra'' by Franco Donatoni] – Edizioni Suvini Zerboni ([http://ethesis.siba.fi/showrecord.php?language=en_EN&amp;ID=396930&amp; Analysis])&lt;/ref&gt; etc. There are also a variety of databases documenting these modern works such as [http://www.sheerpluck.de/ Sheer Pluck]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sheerpluck.de/ Sheer Pluck] – Database of Contemporary Guitar Music&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soundandmusic.org/thecollection/resources/collection_advanced_search_results/%2B/E/%2B/0/0/all/0/0/all/0/0/all/0/0/0/0/alt/1/1_gui%252C/Exact/%2B/%2B/1 Sound and Music]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianmusiccentre.com.au/search?q=Solo+Guitar+Works&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 Australian Music Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background information==
The evolution of the classical guitar and its repertoire spans more than four centuries. It has a history that was shaped by contributions from earlier instruments, such as the Lute, the [[vihuela]], and the [[baroque guitar]]. The popularity of the classical guitar has been sustained over the years by many great players, arrangers, and composers. A very short list might include, [[Gaspar Sanz]] (1640–1710), [[Fernando Sor]] (1778–1839), [[Mauro Giuliani]] (1781–1829), [[Francisco Tárrega]] (1852–1909), [[Agustín Barrios|Agustín Barrios Mangoré]] (1888–1944), [[Andrés Segovia]] (1893–1987), [[Alirio Díaz]] (1923), Presti-Lagoya Duo (active from 1955-1967: [[Ida Presti]], [[Alexandre Lagoya]])&lt;!-- a world class guitar duo at that time! A rarety in a time when Segovia was pushing his solist-only status--&gt;, [[Julian Bream]] (1933), and [[John Williams (guitarist)|John Williams]] (1941).

{{quote|The last guitarist to follow in Segovia´s footsteps was Julian Bream and Julian Bream will be 73 years old on July 15th 2006. Miguel Llobet, Andres Segovia and Julian Bream are the three performer personalities of the 20th century. Do not understand me wrong, we have many guitarists today that are very excellent performers, but none with such a distinct personality in their tone and style as Llobet, Segovia and Bream. In all instrumental areas, not just the guitar, there is a lack of individualism with a strong tendency to conformity. This I find very unfortunate since art (music, theatre or the pictorial arts) is a very individual and personal matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.v4m.net/GuitarFestivalRust/Interviews/InterviewBernardHebb.htm|title= Interview with Bernard Hebb}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Bernard Hebb|Interview}}

==History==
{{Main|History of the classical guitar}}
Throughout the centuries, the classical guitar has evolved principally from three sources: the [[lute]], the [[vihuela]], and the Renaissance guitars.

===Origins===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Elam-tar.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Figurines playing the ancestor of the Guitar. Excavated in [[Susa]], [[Iran]]. Dated 2000-1500 BCE. Kept at the [[National Museum of Iran]].]] --&gt;
Instruments similar to what we know as the guitar have been popular for at least 5,000 years. The ancestry of the modern guitar appears to trace back through many instruments and thousands of years to [[Ancient India and Central Asia|ancient central Asia]]. Guitar like instruments appear in ancient carvings and statues recovered from the old [[Iran]]ian capital of [[Susa]]. This means that the contemporary Iranian instruments such as the [[tanbur]] and [[setar]] are distantly related to the European guitar, as they all derive ultimately from the same ancient origins, but by very different historical routes and influences.

===Overview of the classical guitar's history===
During the [[Middle Ages]], guitars with three, four, and five strings were already in use. The ''Guitarra Latina'' had curved sides and is thought to have come to Spain from elsewhere in Europe. The so-called ''Guitarra Morisca'', brought to Spain by the [[Moors]], had an oval soundbox and many sound holes on its soundboard. By the 15th century, a four course double-string guitar called the [[vihuela de mano]], half way between the lute and the guitar, appeared and became popular in Spain and spread to Italy; and by the 16th century, a fifth double-string had been added. During this time, composers wrote mostly in tablature notation. In the 17th century, influences from the vihuela and the [[renaissance five string guitar]] were combined in the [[baroque guitar]]. The baroque guitar quickly superseded the vihuela in popularity and Italy became the center of the guitar world. Leadership in guitar developments switched to Spain from the late 18th century, when the six string guitar quickly became popular at the expense of the five string guitars. During the 19th century, improved communication and transportation enabled performers to travel widely and the guitar gained greater popularity outside its old strongholds in Iberia, Italy and Latin America. During the 19th century the Spaniard, Antonio de Torres, gave the modern classical guitar its definitive form, with a broadened body, increased waist curve, thinned belly, improved internal bracing, single string courses replacing double courses, and a machined head replacing wooden tuning pegs. The modern classical guitar replaced older form for the accompaniment of song and dance called [[flamenco]], and a modified version, known as the [[flamenco guitar]], was created.

===The Renaissance guitar===

{{Main|Gittern}}

The gittern, often referred to as ''Renaissance guitar'', is a musical instrument resembling a small lute or guitar. It is related to but is not a [[citole]], another medieval instrument. The gittern was carved from a single piece of wood with a curved (&quot;sickle-shaped&quot;) pegbox. An example has survived from around 1450.

See also ''[[Renaissance music]]''.

===The Vihuela===

{{Main|Vihuela}}

The written history of the classical guitar can be traced back to the early 16th century with the development of the ''[[vihuela]]'' in Spain. While the lute was then becoming popular in other parts of Europe, the Spaniards did not take to it well because of its association with the Moors. They turned instead to the four string ''guitarra'', adding two more strings to give it more range and complexity. In its most developed form, the vihuela was a guitar-like instrument with six double strings made of gut, tuned like a modern classical guitar with the exception of the third string, which was tuned half a step lower. It has a high sound and is rather large to hold. There are few still.

===Baroque guitar===

===&quot;Early romantic guitar&quot; or &quot;Guitar during the Classical music era&quot;===

{{Main|Early romantic guitar}}

The earliest extant six string guitar was built in 1779 by Gaetano Vinaccia (1759 - after 1831) &lt;ref&gt;''The Classical Mandolin'' by Paul Sparks (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlyromanticguitar.com Early Romantic Guitar]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Naples, Italy|Naples]], [[Italy]]. The Vinaccia family of luthiers is known for developing the [[mandolin]]. This guitar has been examined and does not show tell-tale signs of modifications from  a double-course guitar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.uakron.edu/gfaa/stalking.html Stalking the Oldest Six String Guitar]&lt;/ref&gt;
The authenticity of guitars allegedly produced before the 1790s is often in question. This also corresponds to when Moretti's 6-string method appeared, in 1792.

See also ''[[Classical music era]]''.

===Contemporary classical guitar===
{{Main|Classical guitar making}}
Contemporary concert guitars occasionally follow the [[Greg Smallman|Smallman]] design, which replaces fan braces with a much lighter balsa brace attached to the back of the sound board with carbon fiber. The balsa brace has a honeycomb pattern and allows the (now much thinner) sound board to support more vibrational modes. This leads to greater volume and longer sustain but compromises the subtle tonalities of the Spanish sound.

==Performance==
{{Main|Classical guitar technique}}
The modern classical guitar is usually played in a seated position, with the instrument resting on the left lap - and the left foot placed on a footstool. Alternatively - if a footstool is not used - a ''guitar support'' can be placed between the guitar and the left lap (the support usually attaches to the instrument's side with [[suction cup]]s). (There are of course exceptions, with some performers choosing to hold the instrument another way.)

===Plucking of the string===
Right-handed players use the fingers of the right hand to pluck the strings, with the thumb plucking from the top of a string downwards and the other fingers plucking from the bottom of string upwards. The little finger in classical technique as it evolved in the 20th century is used only to ride along with the ring finger without striking the strings and to thus physiologically facilitate the ring finger's motion. Some modern guitarists, such as [[Štěpán Rak]], use the little finger independently, compensating for the little finger's shortness by maintaining an extremely long fingernail. In contrast, [[Flamenco]] technique, and classical compositions evoking Flamenco, employ the little finger semi-independently in the Flamenco four-finger [[rasgueado]], that rapid strumming of the string by the fingers in reverse order employing the back of the fingernail&amp;mdash;a familiar characteristic of Flamenco.

===Direct contact with strings===
As with other plucked instruments (such as the lute), the musician directly touches the strings (usually plucking) to produce the sound. This has important consequences: Different tone/[[timbre]] (of a single note) can be produced by plucking the string in different manners and in different positions.

===Tone production/variation and freedom of performance===
Guitarists have a lot of freedom within the mechanics of playing the instrument. Often these decisions with influence on tone/[[timbre]] - factors include:

Right Hand:
*At what position along the string the finger plucks the string (This is actively changed by guitarists since it is an effective way of changing the sound(timbre) from &quot;soft&quot;(dolce) plucking the string near its middle, to &quot;hard&quot;(ponticelo) plucking the string near its end).
*Use of nail or not: today almost all concert guitarists use their fingernails (which must be smoothly [[Nail file|filed]] and carefully shaped&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Pumping Nylon |last= Tennant |first= Scott |authorlink= http://www.scotttennant.net |year= 1996 |publisher= Alfred pub. co. |isbn= 978-0882847214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ) to pluck the string since it produces a sharper clearer sound, and also a better-controlled loud sound. The &quot;use of nail or not&quot; is usually a fixed consistent decision of the player and not varied; the thumb is an exception and might actively be varied between nail [sharper clearer sound] and flesh. Playing parameters include
*Which finger to use
*What angle of attack to hold the wrist and fingers at with respect to the strings
*Rest-stroke [[apoyando]]; the finger that plucks a string rests on the next string&amp;mdash;traditionally used in single melody lines&amp;mdash;versus free-stroke ([[tirando]] ( plucking the string without coming to a rest on the next string)

Left Hand:
*Use of [[hammer-on]] and [[pull-off]] ([[Legato]], [[Slur (music)|slurs]]): This is where only the left hand is used in producing the sound. Since the string is usually already vibrating prior to applying the hammer-on or pull-off, the change of pitch is very smooth: it is hence used for articulation purposes and fast note progressions (since only a single hand is involved). The technique is often used in [[Trill (music)|trills]].
*[[Vibrato]]: Whilst a finger of the left-hand is pressing the string towards a fret, it can rapidly move the string slightly to and from (along the string), resulting in a slight but fast-changing increase and decrease in the string's tension and thus a proportional change in pitch - giving the impression of a fuller tone.

Both Hands/Other:
*One and the same note (in terms of pitch), can be played on many different strings (depending on the appropriate fret being used). Since the different strings have distinctive tones, the guitarist may choose to play on certain strings for particular tonal effects: The difference is greatest between the 3rd string (G - pure nylon) and the 4th string (D - nylon wound with thin metal). This, however also poses a difficulty in producing a uniform sound in melodic lines.
*[[Guitar harmonics|Harmonics]]: The strings can be brought into different modes of vibration, where its [[overtones]] can be heard.

Since it is the hands and fingers that pluck the string and every person has different fingers, there are great differences in playing between guitarists; who often spend a lot of time finding their own way of playing that suits them best in terms of specific objectives: tone-production (&quot;beauty&quot;/quality of tone), minimum noise (e.g. clicking), large dynamic range (from soft to controlled loud), minimum (muscle) effort, fast &quot;motion-recovery&quot; (fast plucking when desired), healthy movement in fingers, wrist, hand and arm.

[[John Williams (guitarist)|John Williams]] has remarked&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarteacher.com.au/johnwilliams.htm|title=John Williams Interview with Austin Prichard-Levy|work= The Twang Box Dynasty}}&lt;/ref&gt; that since guitarists find it superficially very easy to play even things such as melody with accompaniment (e.g. Giuliani), [some guitarists'] &quot;approach to tone production is also superficial, with little or no consideration given to voice matching and tonal contrasts&quot;.

==Repertoire==
{{Main|Classical guitar repertoire}}

The classical guitar repertoire in practical terms includes not only music written specifically for the classical guitar, but also music written for the guitar's predecessors and related instruments. These include the [[vihuela]], popular in 16th-century Spain, and the [[lute]] used everywhere else in Europe in the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] eras. Music written specifically for the classical guitar dates from the addition of the sixth string (the [[baroque guitar]] normally had five pairs of strings) in the late 18th century.

A guitar recital may include a variety of works, e.g. works written originally for the lute or vihuela by composers such as [[John Dowland]] (b. England 1563) and [[Luis de Narváez]] (b. Spain c. 1500), and also music written for the harpsichord by [[Domenico Scarlatti]] (b. Italy 1685), for the baroque lute by [[Sylvius Leopold Weiss]] (b. Germany 1687), for the baroque guitar by [[Robert de Visée]] (b. France c. 1650) or even Spanish-flavored music written for the piano by [[Isaac Albéniz]] (b. Spain 1860) and [[Enrique Granados]] (b. Spain 1867). The most important composer who did not write for the guitar but whose music is often played on guitar is [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (b. Germany 1685), whose works for solo violin, solo cello, and baroque lute have proved highly adaptable for the guitar.

Of music written originally for guitar, the earliest important composers are from the classical period and include [[Fernando Sor]] (b. Spain 1778) and [[Mauro Giuliani]] (b. Italy 1781), both of whom wrote in a style strongly influenced by Viennese classicism. In the 19th century guitar composers such as [[Johann Kaspar Mertz]] (b. Slovakia, Austria 1806) were strongly influenced by the dominance of the piano. Not until the end of the nineteenth century did the guitar begin to establish its own unique atmosphere. [[Francisco Tárrega]] (b. Spain 1852) was central to this, sometimes incorporating some stylized aspects of flamenco, with its Moorish influences, into his romantic miniatures. &lt;!-- This previously read as if Francisco Tárrega and Flamenco (including rasguado) go hand in hand: this is wrong! Esp. Tárrega and rasguado is also almost non-existent! Angel Barrios (1882 - 1964) is important if we wish to draw the readers attention to a fusion of &quot;classical guitar&quot; (as a saloon instrument) and &quot;flamenco guitar&quot; (as an instrument to accompany flamenco song and dance) --&gt; This was part of the phenomenon of musical nationalism that was part of the wider European mainstream in the late 19th century. The aforementioned piano composers Albéniz and Granados were central to this movement and their evocation of the guitar was so successful that guitarists have largely appropriated their music for piano to the guitar. Guitarists who were active at that time, such as Angel Barrios (Spain, 1882–1964) contributed to the incorporation of flamenco style (e.g. the [[Phrygian mode]]) and flamenco guitar techniques such as [[rasgueado]].

With the 20th century and the wide-ranging performances of artists such as [[Andrés Segovia]] and [[Agustín Barrios|Agustín Barrios Mangoré]] the guitar began to regain some of the popularity it had lost to the harpsichord and piano in the 18th century. It again became a popular instrument, but not always in its classical version. The steel-string and electric guitars, integral to the rise of rock and roll in the post-WWII era, became more widely played in North America and the English speaking world. The classical guitar also became widely popular again. Barrios composed many excellent works and brought into the mainstream the characteristics of Latin American music, as did the Brazilian composer [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]]. Andrés Segovia commissioned many works from Spanish composers such as [[Federico Moreno Torroba]] and [[Joaquín Rodrigo]], Italians such as [[Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco]] and Latin American composers such as [[Manuel Ponce (composer)|Manuel Ponce]] of Mexico, Agustín Barrios Mangoré of Paraguay, [[Leo Brouwer]] of Cuba, [[Antonio Lauro]] of Venezuela, [[Enrique Solares]] of Guatemala. [[Julian Bream]] of Great Britain managed to get nearly every British composer from [[William Walton]] to [[Benjamin Britten]] to [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] to write significant works for guitar. Bream's collaborations with tenor [[Peter Pears]] also resulted in [[song cycle|song-cycles]] by Britten, [[Lennox]] Berkeley and others. There are also significant works by composers such as [[Hans Werner Henze]] of Germany.  The classical guitar also became widely used in popular music and rock &amp; roll in the 1960s after guitarist [[Mason Williams]] popularized the instrument in his instrumental hit [[Classical Gas]].  Guitarist [[Christopher Parkening]] is quoted in the book ''Classical Gas: The Music of Mason Williams'' as saying that it is the most requested guitar piece besides Malagueña and perhaps the best known instrumental guitar piece today.

In the field of [[New Flamenco]], the works and performances of Spanish composer and player [[Paco de Lucía]] are worldwide known.

==Physical characteristics==
The classical guitar is distinguished by a number of characteristics:
*It is an [[wiktionary:acoustic|acoustic]] instrument. The sound of the plucked string is amplified by the [[sounding board|soundboard]] and resonant cavity of the guitar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/music/guitar/ Guitar acoustics, University New South Wales]&lt;/ref&gt;
*It has six [[string (music)|strings]], though some classical guitars have seven or more strings.
*All six strings are made from [[nylon]], or nylon wrapped with metal, as opposed to the metal strings found on other acoustic guitars. Nylon strings also have a much lower [[Tension (mechanics)|tension]] than steel strings, as do the predecessors to nylon strings, gut strings (made from ox or sheep gut). The lower three strings ('bass strings') are wound with metal, commonly silver plated copper.
*Because of the low string tension
** The neck can be entirely of wood without a steel truss rod
** The interior bracing can be lighter
*Typical modern six-string classical guitars are 48–54&amp;nbsp;mm wide at the nut, compared to around 42&amp;nbsp;mm for electric guitars.
* Classical fingerboards are normally flat and without inlaid fret markers, or just have dot inlays on the side of the neck&amp;mdash;steel string fingerboards usually have a slight radius and inlays.
*Classical guitarists use their right hand to pluck the strings. Players shape their fingernails for ideal tone and feel against the strings.
*Strumming is a less common technique in classical guitar, and is often referred to by the Spanish term &quot;rasgueo,&quot; or for strumming patterns &quot;rasgueado,&quot; and uses the backs of the fingernails. Rasgueado is integral to [[Flamenco]] guitar.
*[[Machine head]]s at the [[headstock]] of a classical guitar point backwards&amp;mdash;in contrast to most steel-string guitars, which have machine heads that point outward.
*The overall design of a Classical Guitar  is very similar to the slightly lighter and smaller [[Flamenco guitar]].

====Fretboard====
The fretboard (also called the '''fingerboard''') is a piece of wood embedded with metal frets that constitutes the top of the neck. It is flat or slightly curved. The curvature of the fretboard is measured by the fretboard radius, which is the radius of a hypothetical circle of which the fretboard's surface constitutes a segment. The smaller the fretboard radius, the more noticeably curved the fretboard is. Fretboards are most commonly made of [[ebony]], but may also be made of [[Rosewood (timber)|rosewood]] or of phenolic composite (&quot;micarta&quot;).

====Frets====

{{Main|Fret}}

Frets are the metal strips (usually nickel alloy or stainless steel) embedded along the [[fingerboard]] and placed at points that divide the length of string mathematically. The strings' vibrating length is determined when the strings are pressed down behind the frets. Each fret produces a different pitch and each pitch spaced a half-step apart on the 12 tone scale. The [[ratio]] of the widths of two consecutive frets is the [[twelfth root of two]] (&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[12]{2}&lt;/math&gt;), whose numeric value is about 1.059463. The twelfth fret divides the string in two exact halves and the 24th fret (if present) divides the string in half yet again. Every twelve frets represents one octave. This arrangement of frets results in [[equal temperament|equal tempered]] tuning.

====Neck====

{{Main|Guitar neck}}

A classical guitar's frets, fretboard, tuners, headstock, all attached to a long wooden extension, collectively constitute its [[neck (music)|neck]]. The wood used to make the fretboard will usually differ from the wood in the rest of the neck. The bending stress on the neck is considerable, particularly when heavier gauge strings are used (see [[Guitar strings|Strings]]).

====Neck joint or 'heel'====
This is the point where the neck meets the body. In the traditional Spanish neck joint the neck and block are one piece with the sides inserted into slots cut in the block. Other necks are built separately and joined to the body either with a dovetail joint, mortise or flush joint. These joints are usually glued and can be reinforced with mechanical fasteners. Recently many manufacturers use bolt on fasteners. Bolt on neck joints were once associated only with less expensive instruments but now some top manufacturers and hand builders are using variations of this method. Some people believed that the Spanish style one piece neck/block and glued dovetail necks have better sustain, but testing has failed to confirm this.
While most traditional Spanish style builders use the one piece neck/heel block, Fleta a prominent Spanish builder used a dovetail joint due to the influence of his early training in violin making.
One reason for the introduction of the mechanical joints was to make it easier to repair necks. This is more of a problem with steel string guitars than with nylon strings, which have about half the string tension. This is why nylon string guitars often don't include a truss rod either.

====Body====
The body of the instrument is a major determinant of the overall sound variety for acoustic guitars. The guitar top, or soundboard, is a finely crafted and engineered element often made of [[spruce]], [[Thuja plicata|red cedar]] or [[mahogany]]. This thin (often 2 or 3&amp;nbsp;mm thick) piece of wood, strengthened by different types of internal bracing, is considered the most prominent factor in determining the sound quality of a guitar. The majority of the sound is caused by vibration of the guitar top as the energy of the vibrating strings is transferred to it. Different patterns of wood bracing have been used through the years by luthiers ([[Antonio Torres Jurado|Torres]], [[Hermann Hauser Sr.|Hauser]], [[José Ramírez|Ramírez]], Fleta, and [[C.F. Martin &amp; Company|C.F. Martin]] being among the most influential designers of their times); to not only strengthen the top against collapsing under the tremendous stress exerted by the tensioned strings, but also to affect the resonation of the top. The back and sides are made out of a variety of woods such as mahogany, Indian [[rosewood]] and highly regarded Brazilian rosewood (''Dalbergia nigra''). Each one is chosen for its aesthetic effect and structural strength, and such choice can also play a significant role in determining the instrument's [[timbre]]. These are also strengthened with internal bracing, and decorated with inlays and purfling.

The body of a classical guitar is a resonating chamber that projects the vibrations of the body through a ''sound hole'', allowing the acoustic guitar to be heard without amplification. The sound hole is normally a round hole in the top of the guitar (under the strings), though some have different placement, shapes, or multiple holes.

An instrument's maximum volume is determined by how much air it can move.

====Binding, purfling and kerfing====
The top, back and sides of a classical guitar body are very thin, so a flexible piece of wood called ''kerfing'' (because it is often scored, or ''kerfed'' so it bends with the shape of the rim) is glued into the corners where the rim meets the top and back. This interior reinforcement provides 5 to 20&amp;nbsp;mm of solid gluing area for these corner joints.

During final construction, a small section of the outside corners is carved or routed out and filled with binding material on the outside corners and decorative strips of material next to the binding, which are called ''[[purfling]]''. This binding serves to seal off the [[endgrain]] of the top and back. Binding and purfling materials are generally made of either wood or high quality plastic materials.

====Bridge====
The main purpose of the bridge on a classical guitar is to transfer the vibration from the strings to the soundboard, which vibrates the air inside of the guitar, thereby amplifying the sound produced by the strings. The bridge holds the strings in place on the body. Also, the position of the saddle, usually a strip of bone or plastic that supports the strings off the bridge, determines the distance to the nut (at the top of the fingerboard).

===Sizes===
The modern full size classical guitar has a [[Scale (string instruments)|scale length]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hago.org.uk/faqs/scale-length.php Guitar scale length ] Hampshire guitar orchestra&lt;/ref&gt; of around 650&amp;nbsp;mm (25.6&amp;nbsp;inches), with an overall instrument length of 965–1016&amp;nbsp;mm (38-40&amp;nbsp;inches). The scale length has remained quite consistent since it was chosen by the originator of the instrument, [[Antonio Torres Jurado|Antonio de Torres]]. This length may have been chosen because it's twice the length of a violin string. As the guitar is tuned to one octave below that of the violin, the same size gut could be used for the 1st strings of both instruments.

Smaller scale instruments are produced to assist children in learning the instrument as the smaller scale leads to the frets being closer together making it easier for smaller hands. The scale size for the smaller guitars is usually in the range 484–578&amp;nbsp;mm (19-22.5&amp;nbsp;inches) with an instrument length of 785–915&amp;nbsp;mm (31-36&amp;nbsp;inches). Full size instruments are sometimes referred to as 4/4, while the smaller sizes are 3/4, 1/2 or 1/4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reviews.ebay.com/How-to-Choose-correct-size-amp-type-of-Guitar-for-Child_W0QQugidZ10000000000907264 How to Choose the correct size &amp; type of Guitar for a Child]&lt;/ref&gt;

These sizes are not absolute, as [[luthier]]s may choose variations around these nominal scale lengths;

==Tuning==
{{Main|Guitar tuning}}
A variety of different tunings are used. The most common by far, which one could call the &quot;standard tuning&quot; is:
*e&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; - b - g - d - A - E

The above order, is the tuning from the ''1st string'' (highest-pitched string e'&amp;mdash;spatially the bottom string in playing position) to the ''6th string'' (lowest-pitched string E&amp;mdash;spatially the upper string in playing position, and hence comfortable to pluck with the thumb.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

This tuning is such that neighboring strings are at most 5 semitones apart.
There are also a variety of commonly used [[guitar tuning|alternate tunings]].

'''Clive Staples Lewis''' (29 November 1898{{ndash}} 22 November 1963), commonly referred to as '''C.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Lewis''' and known to his friends and family as &quot;Jack&quot;, was an [[Irish people|Irish]]-born [[United Kingdom|British]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/338121/C-S-Lewis |title=C. S. Lewis |publisher|britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; novelist, academic, [[medieval studies|medievalist]], literary critic, essayist, lay theologian and [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]]. He is well known for his fictional work, especially ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]'', ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and ''[[The Space Trilogy]]''.

Lewis was a close friend of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], and both authors were leading figures in the English faculty at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] and in the informal Oxford literary group known as the &quot;[[Inklings]]&quot;. According to his memoir ''[[Surprised by Joy]]'', Lewis had been baptised in the [[Church of Ireland]] at birth, but fell away from his faith during his adolescence. Owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends, at the age of 32 Lewis returned to Christianity, becoming &quot;a very ordinary layman of the [[Church of England]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1952) Mere Christianity; p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; His conversion had a profound effect on his work, and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim.

In 1956 he married the American writer [[Joy Gresham]], 17 years his junior, who died four years later of cancer at the age of 45.

Lewis died three years after his wife, as the result of [[renal failure]]. His death came one week before his 65th birthday. Media coverage of his death was minimal, as he died on 22 November 1963 – the same day that U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] was assassinated, and the same day another famous author, [[Aldous Huxley]], died.

Lewis's works have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies. The books that make up ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' have sold the most and have been popularised on stage, TV, radio and cinema.

==Biography==
===Childhood===
Clive Staples Lewis was born in [[Belfast, Ireland]]&lt;!-- not &quot;Northern Ireland, because Northern Ireland did not exist at the time --&gt;, on 29 November 1898.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. W. Bennett, &quot;Lewis, Clive Staples (1898–1963)&quot;, rev. Emma Plaskitt, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2004; online edn, May 2008. Retrieved 2 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Albert James Lewis (1863–1929), a solicitor whose father, Richard, had come to Ireland from Wales during the mid 19th century. His mother was Florence Augusta Lewis, née Hamilton (1862–1908), known as Flora, the daughter of a [[Church of Ireland]] (Anglican) priest. He had an elder brother, [[Warren Lewis|Warren Hamilton Lewis]]. At the age of four, shortly after his dog Jacksie was killed by a car, he announced that his name was now Jacksie. At first he would answer to no other name, but later accepted Jack, the name by which he was known to friends and family for the rest of his life. When he was seven, his family moved into &quot;Little Lea&quot;, the family home of his childhood, in the [[Strandtown]] area of [[East Belfast]]. 
[[Image:Little Lea.JPG|thumb|Little Lea]]

As a boy, Lewis had a fascination with [[anthropomorphic]] animals, falling in love with [[Beatrix Potter]]'s stories and often writing and illustrating his own animal stories. He and his brother Warnie together created the world of [[Boxen (C. S. Lewis)|Boxen]], inhabited and run by animals. Lewis loved to read, and as his father's house was filled with books, he felt that finding a book to read was as easy as walking into a field and &quot;finding a new blade of grass.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Surprised by Joy'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis was schooled by private tutors before being sent to the [[Wynyard School]] in [[Watford]], [[Hertfordshire]], in 1908, just after his mother's death from cancer. Lewis' brother had enrolled there three years previously. The school was closed not long afterwards due to a lack of pupils; the headmaster Robert &quot;Oldie&quot; Capron was soon after committed to a psychiatric hospital. Lewis then attended [[Campbell College]] in the east of Belfast about a mile from his home, but he left after a few months due to respiratory problems. He was then sent to the health-resort town of [[Malvern, Worcestershire]], where he attended the preparatory school Cherbourg House, which Lewis calls &quot;Chartres&quot; in his autobiography. It was during this time that Lewis abandoned his childhood Christian faith and became an atheist, becoming interested in mythology and the occult.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Surprised by Joy'', p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1913, Lewis enrolled at [[Malvern College]], where he remained until the following June. He found the school socially competitive.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1966) Studies in Medieval and Renaissance Literature; p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Malvern he studied privately with William T. Kirkpatrick, his father's old tutor and former headmaster of [[Lurgan College]].

As a teenager, he was wonderstruck by the songs and legends of what he called ''Northernness'', the ancient literature of Scandinavia preserved in the [[Icelandic sagas]]. These legends intensified an inner longing he later called &quot;joy&quot;. He also grew to love nature; its beauty reminded him of the stories of the North, and the stories of the North reminded him of the beauties of nature. His teenage writings moved away from the tales of Boxen, and he began using different art forms ([[epic poetry]] and opera) to try to capture his new-found interest in [[Norse mythology]] and the natural world. Studying with Kirkpatrick (&quot;The Great Knock&quot;, as Lewis afterwards called him) instilled in him a love of [[Greek literature]] and mythology and sharpened his skills in debate and sound reasoning. In 1916, Lewis was awarded a scholarship at [[University College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cslewis.com/about.aspx |title=C.S. Lewis Classics ::: About C.S.

===&quot;My Irish life&quot;&lt;!--Note to editors: Lewis described this as &quot;My Irish Life&quot; see the bottom of this section for the title's meaning--&gt;===
[[Image:CSLewisPlaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque on a park-bench in [[Bangor, County Down]]]]
Lewis experienced a certain cultural shock on first arriving in England: &quot;No Englishman will be able to understand my first impressions of England&quot;, Lewis wrote in ''[[Surprised by Joy]]'', continuing, &quot;The strange [[Regional accents of English speakers|English accents]] with which I was surrounded seemed like the voices of demons. But what was worst was the English landscape&amp;nbsp;... I have made up the quarrel since; but at that moment I conceived a hatred for England which took many years to heal.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis, p. 24&quot;&gt;Lewis, ''Surprised by Joy'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

From boyhood Lewis immersed&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, C.S. Surprised By Joy: The Shape of My Early Life. New York: Harcourt, 1984. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  himself firstly in [[Norse mythology|Norse]] and [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and then in [[Irish mythology]] and [[Irish literature|literature]] and expressed an interest in the [[Irish language]],&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Martindale, ''Beyond the Shadowlands: C. S. Lewis on Heaven and Hell'', Crossway, 2005.  p 52&lt;/ref&gt; though there is not much evidence that he laboured to learn it. He developed a particular fondness for [[W. B. Yeats|W.&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;Yeats]], in part because of Yeats's use of Ireland's Celtic heritage in poetry. In a letter to a friend Lewis wrote, &quot;I have here discovered an author exactly after my own heart, whom I am sure you would delight in, W. B. Yeats. He writes plays and poems of rare spirit and beauty about our old Irish mythology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis, C.S. Collected Letters 1931&quot;&gt;Lewis, C.S. Collected Letters, Volume 1: Family Letters, 1905–1931. London: HarperCollins Publishers, 2000. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, Lewis met Yeats twice, since Yeats had moved to Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Arthur Greeves, in Walter Hooper ed., ''The Collected Letters of C. S. Lewis, Vol. 1: Family Letters, 1905–1931'' (New York: HarperCollins, 2004), [http://books.google.com/books?id=3GBkjv2Y-9MC&amp;pg=PA564 pp. 564–65]. ISBN 0-06-072763-2&lt;/ref&gt; Surprised to find his English peers indifferent to Yeats and the [[Celtic Revival]] movement, Lewis wrote: &quot;I am often surprised to find how utterly ignored Yeats is among the men I have met: perhaps his appeal is purely Irish — if so, then thank the gods that I am Irish.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;On Yeats&quot;&gt;Yeats appeal wasn't exclusively Irish: he was also a major &quot;magical opponent&quot; of famed English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], as noted extensively throughout Lawrence Sutin's [http://books.google.com/books?id=JpR0FKRIissC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=aleister+crowley+yeats&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n_oxScdKNJ&amp;sig=I4oh26EII5asPOwxxE9flizlHLc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zITTSY3wLpaItAOTzLj8Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result ''Do what thou wilt : a life of Aleister Crowley'']. New York: MacMillan (St. Martins). cf. pp. 56–78. See also [[Yeats#Young poet|Yeats]] (main article); and King, Francis (1978). ''The Magical World of Aleister Crowley''. New York: Coward, McCann &amp; Geoghegan, ISBN 0698108841.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his career, Lewis considered sending his work to the major [[Dublin]] publishers, writing: &quot;If I do ever send my stuff to a publisher, I think I shall try Maunsel, those Dublin people, and so tack myself definitely onto the Irish school.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis, C.S. Collected Letters 1931&quot;/&gt; After his conversion to Christianity, his interests gravitated towards Christian spirituality and away from pagan Celtic mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas C. Peters, ''Simply C. S. Lewis: A Beginner's Guide to the Life and Works of C. S. Lewis'', 	Crossway, 1997. p 70&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis occasionally expressed a somewhat tongue-in-cheek chauvinism toward the English. Describing an encounter with a fellow Irishman he wrote: &quot;Like all Irish people who meet in England we ended by criticisms on the invincible flippancy and dulness of the Anglo-Saxon race. After all, there is no doubt, ami, that the Irish are the only people: with all their faults I would not gladly live or die among another folk.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Arthur Greeves, in Walter Hooper ed., ''The Collected Letters of C. S. Lewis, Vol. 1: Family Letters, 1905–1931'' (New York: HarperCollins, 2004), [http://books.google.com/books?id=eOxfuF6BQ0gC&amp;pg=PA310 p. 310]. ISBN 0-06-072763-2&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his life, he sought out the company of other Irish living in England&lt;ref&gt;Clare, David. &quot;C.S. Lewis: An Irish Writer&quot;. Irish Sudies review. Vol. 18, No. 1, February 2010, p. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; and visited [[Northern Ireland]] regularly, even spending his honeymoon there in 1958 at the Old Inn, [[Crawfordsburn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theoldinn.com/about-us/history-of-the-old-inn/ |title=History of the Old Inn at Crawfordsburn|accessdate=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called this &quot;my Irish life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, C.S. All My Road Before Me: The Diary of C.S. Lewis, 1922-1927. Ed. Walter Hooper. London: HarperCollins Publishers, 1993. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various critics have suggested that it was Lewis's dismay over sectarian conflict in his native Belfast that led him to eventually adopt such an ecumenical brand of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, A.N. C.S. Lewis: A Biography. London: Harper Perennial, 1991. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;  As one critic has said, Lewis &quot;repeatedly extolled the virtues of all branches of the Christian faith, emphasising a need for unity among Christians around what the Catholic writer [[G.K. Chesterton]] called ‘Mere Christianity’, the core doctrinal beliefs that all denominations share.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Clare, David. &quot;C.S. Lewis: An Irish Writer&quot;. Irish Sudies review. Vol. 18, No. 1, February 2010, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Paul Stevens of the University of Toronto has written that &quot;Lewis's ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' masked many of the political prejudices of an old-fashioned [[Ulster]] Protestant, a native of middle-class Belfast for whom British withdrawal from Northern Ireland even in the 1950s and 1960s was unthinkable&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Stevens, 'Reforming Empire: Protestant Colonialism and Conscience in British Literature', ''Modern Philology'', Vol. 103 Issue 1 (August 2005), pp. 137–8, citing Humphrey Carpenter, ''The Inklings'' (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1978), pp. 50–52, 206–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
In 1917, Lewis left his studies to volunteer in the British Army. During World War I he was commissioned an officer in the Third Battalion, [[Somerset Light Infantry]]. Lewis arrived at the front line in the [[Somme]] Valley in France on his nineteenth birthday, and experienced trench warfare.

On 15 April 1918, Lewis was wounded and two of his colleagues were killed by an English shell falling short of its target.&lt;ref name=&quot;secret&quot;&gt;Arnott, Anne. &quot;The Secret Country of CS Lewis&quot;, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis suffered from depression and homesickness during his convalescence. Upon his recovery in October, he was assigned to duty in [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]], England. He was discharged in December 1918, and soon returned to his studies. Lewis received a [[British undergraduate degree classification|First]] in [[Honour Moderations]] (Greek and [[Latin literature|Latin Literature]]) in 1920, a First in [[Greats]] (Philosophy and Ancient History) in 1922, and a First in English in 1923.

===Jane Moore===
While being trained for the army Lewis shared a room with another cadet, Edward Courtnay Francis &quot;Paddy&quot; Moore (1898–1918). Maureen Moore, Paddy's sister, said that the two made a mutual pact&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Edwards | first = Bruce L. | title = C.S. Lewis: Life, Works, and Legacy | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group, Inc. | year = 2007 | page = 133 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=uDvxsQhGgIkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=c.s.+lewis%2Bbruce+edwards | isbn = 9780275991173}}&lt;/ref&gt; that if either died during the war, the survivor would take care of both their families. Paddy was killed in action in 1918 and Lewis kept his promise. Paddy had earlier introduced Lewis to his mother, Jane King Moore, and a friendship quickly sprang up between Lewis, who was eighteen when they met, and Jane, who was forty-five. The friendship with Mrs. Moore was particularly important to Lewis while he was recovering from his wounds in hospital, as his father did not visit Lewis.

Lewis lived with and cared for Mrs. Moore until she was hospitalized in the late 1940s. He routinely introduced her as his &quot;mother&quot;, and referred to her as such in letters. Lewis, whose own mother had died when he was a child and whose father was distant, demanding and eccentric, developed a deeply affectionate friendship with Mrs. Moore.

Speculation regarding their relationship re-surfaced with the publication of A. N. Wilson's biography of Lewis. Wilson (who had never met Lewis) attempted to make a case for their having been lovers for a time. Wilson's biography was not the first to address the question of Lewis's relationship with Mrs. Moore. [[George Sayer]], who knew Lewis for 29 years, sought to shed light on the relationship during the period of 14 years prior to Lewis's conversion to Christianity, in his biography ''Jack: A Life of C. S. Lewis'', in which he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Were they lovers? Owen Barfield, who knew Jack well in the 1920s, once said that he thought the likelihood was &quot;fifty-fifty.&quot; Although she was twenty-six years older than Jack, she was still a handsome woman, and he was certainly infatuated with her. But it seems very odd, if they were lovers, that he would call her &quot;mother.&quot; We know, too, that they did not share the same bedroom. It seems most likely that he was bound to her by the promise he had given to Paddy and that his promise was reinforced by his love for her as his second mother.&lt;ref&gt;Sayer, George (1997). ''Jack: A Life of C. S. Lewis''. London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later Sayer changed his mind. In the introduction to the 1997 edition of his biography of Lewis he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have had to alter my opinion of Lewis's relationship with Mrs. Moore. In chapter eight of this book I wrote that I was uncertain about whether they were lovers. Now after conversations with Mrs. Moore's daughter, Maureen, and a consideration of the way in which their bedrooms were arranged at The Kilns, I am quite certain that they were.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lewis spoke well of Mrs. Moore throughout his life, saying to his friend George Sayer, &quot;She was generous and taught me to be generous, too.&quot;

In December 1917 Lewis wrote in a letter to his childhood friend Arthur Greeves that Jane and Greeves were &quot;the two people who matter most to me in the world.&quot;

In 1930, Lewis and his brother Warnie moved, with Mrs. Moore and her daughter Maureen, into &quot;[[The Kilns]]&quot;, a house in the district of [[Headington Quarry]] on the outskirts of Oxford (now part of the suburb of [[Risinghurst]]). They all contributed financially to the purchase of the house, which passed to Maureen, then [[Maureen Dunbar|Dame Maureen Dunbar, Btss.]], when Warren died in 1973.

Mrs. Moore suffered from dementia in her later years and was eventually moved into a nursing home, where she died in 1951. Lewis visited her every day in this home until her death.

===Conversion to Christianity===
Lewis was raised in a church-going family in the [[Church of Ireland]]. He became an atheist at 15, though he later described his young self as being paradoxically &quot;very angry with God for not existing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Surprised by Joy'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

His early separation from Christianity began when he started to view his religion as a chore and as a duty; around this time, he also gained an interest in the occult, as his studies expanded to include such topics.&lt;ref&gt;''The Critic'', Volume 32, Thomas More Association, 1973.Original from	the University of Michigan&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis quoted [[Lucretius]] (''De rerum natura'', 5.198–9) as having one of the strongest arguments for atheism:&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Surprised by Joy'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Nequaquam nobis divinitus esse paratam''
:''Naturam rerum; tanta stat praedita culpa''

:&quot;Had God designed the world, it would not be
:A world so frail and faulty as we see.&quot;

Lewis's interest in the works of [[George MacDonald]] was part of what turned him from atheism. This can be seen particularly well through this passage in Lewis's ''[[The Great Divorce]]'', chapter nine, when the semi-autobiographical [[Protagonist|main character]] meets MacDonald in [[Heaven]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...I tried, trembling, to tell this man all that his writings had done for me. I tried to tell how a certain frosty afternoon at [[Leatherhead]] Station when I had first bought a copy of ''Phantastes'' (being then about sixteen years old) had been to me what the first sight of Beatrice had been to [[Dante]]: ''Here begins the new life''. I started to confess how long that Life had delayed in the region of imagination merely: how slowly and reluctantly I had come to admit that his Christendom had more than an accidental connexion with it, how hard I had tried not to see the true name of the quality which first met me in his books is Holiness.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1946) The Great Divorce; pp. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He slowly re-embraced Christianity, influenced by arguments with his Oxford colleague and friend [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], whom he seems to have met for the first time on 11 May 1926, and by the book ''[[The Everlasting Man]]'' by [[G. K. Chesterton]]. He fought greatly up to the moment of his conversion, noting that he was brought into Christianity like a prodigal, &quot;kicking, struggling, resentful, and darting his eyes in every direction for a chance to escape.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Surprised by Joy'', p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; He described his last struggle in ''[[Surprised by Joy]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You must picture me alone in that room in [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen]], night after night, feeling, whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work, the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. That which I greatly feared had at last come upon me. In the Trinity Term of 1929 I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Surprised by Joy'', pp. 228, 229.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After his conversion to [[theism]] in 1929, Lewis converted to Christianity in 1931, following a long discussion and late-night walk with his close friends Tolkien and [[Hugo Dyson]]. He records making a specific commitment to Christian belief while on his way to the zoo with his brother. He became a member of the Church of England — somewhat to the disappointment of Tolkien, who had hoped that he would convert to Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSL&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Carpenter|first=Humphrey|year=1978|title=The Inklings|publisher=London: Allen &amp; Unwin}} Lewis was brought up in the [[Church of Ireland]], and after his conversion joined the Church of England.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis was a committed [[Church of England|Anglican]] who upheld a largely orthodox Anglican theology, though in his [[apologetics|apologetic]] writings, he made an effort to avoid espousing any one denomination. In his later writings, some believe that he proposed ideas such as purification of [[venial sin]]s after death in [[purgatory]] (''[[The Great Divorce]]'' and ''[[Letters to Malcolm]]'') and [[mortal sin]] (''[[The Screwtape Letters]]''), which are generally considered to be Roman Catholic teachings, although they are also widely held in Anglicanism (particularly in [[high church]] [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] circles).  Regardless, Lewis considered himself an entirely orthodox Anglican to the end of his life, reflecting that he had initially attended church only to receive communion and had been repelled by the hymns and the poor quality of the sermons. He later came to consider himself honoured by worshipping with men of faith who came in shabby clothes and work boots and who sang all the verses to all the hymns.&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Wilson, ''C.S. Lewis: a biography''' W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2002. p 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joy Gresham===
In Lewis's later life, he corresponded with and later met [[Joy Gresham|Joy Davidman Gresham]], an American writer of Jewish background, a former Communist, and a convert from atheism to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamblion.com/articles/other/gems/Gems-02.php C. S. Lewis — His Conversion].&lt;/ref&gt; She was separated from her alcoholic and abusive husband, the novelist [[William Lindsay Gresham|William L. Gresham]], and came to England with her two sons, David and [[Douglas Gresham|Douglas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/01/01/RVGQFGC5DO1.DTL |title=Lost in the shadow of C.S. Lewis' fame, by Cynthia Haven |publisher=SFGate.com |accessdate=8 April 2009 | date=31 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis at first regarded her as an agreeable intellectual companion and personal friend, and it was at least overtly on this level that he agreed to enter into a [[civil marriage]] contract with her so that she could continue to live in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Green and Hooper. ''C. S. Lewis: A Biography'' (New York:Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1974), 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis's brother Warnie wrote: &quot;For Jack the attraction was at first undoubtedly intellectual. Joy was the only woman whom he had met... who had a brain which matched his own in suppleness, in width of interest, and in analytical grasp, and above all in humour and a sense of fun&quot; {{Harvard citation|Haven|2006}}. However, after complaining of a painful hip, she was diagnosed with terminal [[bone cancer]], and the relationship developed to the point that they sought a Christian marriage. Since she was divorced, this was not straightforward in the Church of England at the time, but a friend, the Rev. Peter Bide, performed the ceremony at her hospital bed in March 1957.&lt;ref&gt;''The C.S. Lewis Reader's Encyclopedia'' edited by Schultz and West. (Zondervan, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 1988), 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gresham's cancer soon went into a brief remission, and the couple lived as a family (together with [[Warren Lewis]]) until her eventual relapse and death in 1960. The year she died, the couple took a brief holiday in Greece and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] in 1960; Lewis was fond of walking but not of travel, and this marked his only crossing of the English Channel after 1918. Lewis's book ''[[A Grief Observed]]'' describes his experience of bereavement in such a raw and personal fashion that Lewis originally released it under the pseudonym N.W. Clerk to keep readers from associating the book with him. However, so many friends recommended the book to Lewis as a method for dealing with his own grief that he made his authorship public.

Lewis continued to raise Gresham's two sons after her death. While Douglas Gresham is, like Lewis and his mother, a [[Christian]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/books/at-home-in-narnia/2005/12/03/1133422143366.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 At home in Narnia — Books — Entertainment].&lt;/ref&gt; David Gresham turned to the faith into which his mother had been born and became Orthodox Jewish in his beliefs. His mother's writings had featured the Jews, particularly one &quot;[[shohet]]&quot; (ritual slaughterer), in an unsympathetic manner. David informed Lewis that he was going to become a ritual slaughterer in order to present this type of Jewish religious functionary to the world in a more favourable light. In a 2005 interview, [[Douglas Gresham]] acknowledged he and his brother were not close, but he did say they are in email contact.&lt;ref name=&quot;theage.com.au&quot;&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/books/at-home-in-narnia/2005/12/03/1133422143366.html?page=4 At home in Narnia — Books — Entertainment].&lt;/ref&gt;
Douglas remains involved in the affairs of the Lewis estate.

===Illness and death===
In early June 1961, Lewis began experiencing medical problems and was diagnosed with [[nephritis|inflammation of the kidneys]] which resulted in blood poisoning. His illness caused him to miss the autumn term at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], though his health gradually began improving in 1962 and he returned that April. Lewis's health continued to improve, and according to his friend George Sayer, Lewis was fully himself by the spring of 1963. However, on 15 July 1963 he fell ill and was admitted to hospital. The next day at 5:00 pm, Lewis suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and lapsed into a coma, unexpectedly awaking the following day at 2:00 pm. After he was discharged from the hospital, Lewis returned to the Kilns, though he was too ill to return to work. As a result, he resigned from his post at Cambridge in August. Lewis's condition continued to decline, and in mid-November he was diagnosed with end stage [[Chronic renal failure|renal failure]]. On 22 November 1963 Lewis collapsed in his bedroom at 5:30 pm and died a few minutes later, exactly one week before his 65th birthday. He is buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity Church, [[Headington|Headington, Oxford]] {{Harvard citation|Friends of Holy Trinity Church}}. Almost 10 years later, his brother [[Warren Lewis|Warren Hamilton &quot;Warnie&quot; Lewis]], who died on 9 April 1973, was buried next to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cslewis.drzeus.net/multimedia/ |title=Into the Wardrobe — a C. S. Lewis web site - Multimedia — Picture Album |publisher= cslewis.drzeus.net |accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage of his death was almost completely overshadowed by news of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]], which occurred on the same day, as did the death of [[Aldous Huxley]], author of ''[[Brave New World]]''. This coincidence was the inspiration for [[Peter Kreeft]]'s book ''[[Between Heaven and Hell (novel)|Between Heaven and Hell: A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F. Kennedy, C. S. Lewis, &amp; Aldous Huxley]]'' {{Harvard citation|Kreeft|1982}}.

C. S. Lewis is commemorated on 22 November in the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|church calendar]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=USA Today|title=Parish to push sainthood for Thurgood Marshall|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2006-01-26-marshall-sainthood_x.htm | date=27 January 2006 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Scholar===
[[Image:MagdalenCollegeOxford20040613 CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg|thumb|right|Magdalen College, Oxford]] Lewis began his academic career as an undergraduate student at Oxford, where he won a triple first, the highest honours in three areas of study.&lt;ref&gt;The Question of God. Armand Nicholi. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis then taught as a fellow of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], for nearly thirty years, from 1925 to 1954, and later was the first [[Professor of Medieval and Renaissance English, Cambridge University|Professor of Medieval and Renaissance English]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] and a fellow of [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]]. Using this position, he argued that there was no such thing as an [[English Renaissance]]. Much of his scholarly work concentrated on the [[Late Middle Ages|later Middle Ages]], especially its use of allegory. His ''[[The Allegory of Love]]'' (1936) helped reinvigorate the serious study of late medieval narratives like the ''[[Roman de la Rose]]''. Lewis wrote several prefaces to old works of literature and poetry, like Layamon's ''Brut''. His book &quot;A Preface to ''Paradise Lost''&quot; is still one of the most valuable criticisms of that work. His last [[academia|academic work]], ''[[The Discarded Image]]: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature'' (1964), is a summary of the medieval world view, the &quot;discarded image&quot; of the cosmos in his title.

[[Image:Eagle and Child.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[The Eagle and Child]] pub in Oxford where the Inklings met on Tuesday mornings in 1939]]Lewis was a prolific writer, and his circle of literary friends became an informal discussion society known as the &quot;[[Inklings]]&quot;, including [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Nevill Coghill]], [[Lord David Cecil]], [[Charles Williams (British writer)|Charles Williams]], [[Owen Barfield]], and his brother Warren Lewis.  At least one scholar points to December 1929 as the Inklings' beginning date.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Glyer ''The Company They Keep: C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien as Writers in Community''. Kent State University Press. Kent Ohio. 2007. ISBN 978-0-87338-890-0&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis's friendship with Coghill and Tolkien grew during their time as members of the Kolbítar, an Old Norse reading group Tolkien founded and which ended around the time of the inception of the Inklings.&lt;ref&gt;Lazo, Andrew (2004). &quot;Gathered Round Northern Fires: The Imaginative Impact of the Kolbítar&quot;. ''Tolkien and the Invention of Myth: A Reader''. Ed. Jane Chance. Lexington: University of Kentucky Press. pp. 191–226. 0-8131-2301-1&lt;/ref&gt; At Oxford he was the tutor of, among many other undergraduates, poet [[John Betjeman]], critic [[Kenneth Tynan]], mystic [[Bede Griffiths]], and Sufi scholar [[Martin Lings]]. Curiously, the religious and conservative Betjeman detested Lewis, whereas the [[Anti-establishment|anti-Establishment]] Tynan retained a life-long admiration for him {{harvard citation|Tonkin|2005|pp=}}.

Of Tolkien, Lewis writes in ''[[Surprised by Joy]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When I began teaching for the English Faculty, I made two other friends, both Christians (these queer people seemed now to pop up on every side) who were later to give me much help in getting over the last stile. They were H.V.V. Dyson&amp;nbsp;... and J.R.R. Tolkien. Friendship with the latter marked the breakdown of two old prejudices. At my first coming into the world I had been (implicitly) warned never to trust a Papist, and at my first coming into the English Faculty (explicitly) never to trust a [[philology|philologist]]. Tolkien was both.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Surprised by Joy'', p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Novelist===
In addition to his scholarly work, Lewis wrote a number of popular novels, including his science fiction [[The Space Trilogy]] and his fantasy fiction [[Narnia]]n books, most dealing implicitly with Christian themes such as sin, humanity's [[Fall of Man|fall from grace]], and redemption.

====''The Pilgrim's Regress''====
{{Main|The Pilgrim's Regress}}
His first novel after becoming a Christian was ''The Pilgrim's Regress,'' which depicted his experience with Christianity in the style of [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''. The book was poorly received by critics at the time,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas C. Peters, ''Simply C. S. Lewis: A Beginner's Guide to the Life and Works of C. S. Lewis'', Crossway, 1997. p 70&lt;/ref&gt; although D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones, one of Lewis's contemporaries at Oxford, gave him much-valued encouragement. Asked by Lloyd-Jones when he would write another book, Lewis replied, &quot;When I understand the meaning of prayer.&quot; {{Harvard citation|Murray|1990}}

====&quot;Space Trilogy&quot; novels====
{{Main|Space Trilogy}}
His &quot;Space Trilogy&quot; or &quot;Ransom Trilogy&quot; novels (also called the &quot;Cosmic Trilogy&quot;) dealt with what Lewis saw as the de-humanising trends in contemporary [[science fiction]]. The first book, ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'', was apparently written following a conversation with his friend [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] about these trends; Lewis agreed to write a &quot;space travel&quot; story and Tolkien a &quot;time travel&quot; one. Tolkien's story, &quot;[[The Lost Road and Other Writings|The Lost Road]]&quot;, a tale connecting his [[Middle-earth]] mythology and the modern world, was never completed. Lewis's main character of [[Elwin Ransom|Ransom]] is based in part on Tolkien, a fact that Tolkien himself alludes to in his ''Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien''. The second novel, ''[[Perelandra]]'', depicts a new [[Garden of Eden]] on the planet Venus, a new [[Adam and Eve]], and a new &quot;serpent figure&quot; to tempt them. The story can be seen as a hypothesis of what could have happened if the terrestrial Eve had resisted the serpent's temptation and avoided the Fall of Man. The last novel in the Trilogy, ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'', further develops the theme of nihilistic science threatening traditional human values embodied in Arthurian legend (and making reference to Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth).

Many of the ideas in the Trilogy, particularly the opposition to de-humanization in the third volume, are presented more formally in Lewis’ ''[[The Abolition of Man]]'', based on his series of lectures at [[Durham University]] in 1943. Lewis stayed in Durham, where he was overwhelmed by [[Durham Cathedral|the cathedral]]. ''That Hideous Strength'' is in fact set in the environs of 'Edgestow' university, a small English university like Durham, though Lewis disclaims any other resemblance between the two.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis's 1943 Preface to &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; (1945) by C. S. Lewis.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Hooper]], Lewis's literary executor, discovered a fragment of another science-fiction novel by Lewis, ''[[The Dark Tower (1977 novel)|The Dark Tower]]'', but it is unfinished; it is not clear whether the book was intended as part of the same series of novels. The manuscript was eventually published in 1977, though Lewis scholar [[Kathryn Lindskoog]] doubts its authenticity.

====''The Chronicles of Narnia''====
[[Image:Mourne mountains.jpg|thumb|[[Mourne Mountains|The Mountains of Mourne]] inspired Lewis to write ''The Chronicles of Narnia''. About them, Lewis wrote &quot;I have seen landscapes ... which, under a particular light, make me feel that at any moment a giant might raise his head over the next ridge.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The great British weekend: The Mourne Mountains&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/holiday_type/breaks/article6828822.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=he great British weekend The Mourne Mountains | first=Jane | last=Knight | date=12 September 2009 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|The Chronicles of Narnia}}
''The Chronicles of Narnia'' is a series of seven fantasy novels for children and is considered a classic of [[children's literature]]. Written between 1949 and 1954 and illustrated by [[Pauline Baynes]], the series is Lewis's most popular work, having sold over 100 million copies in 41 languages {{Harvard citation|Kelly|2006|pp=}} {{Harvard citation|Guthmann|2005|pp=}}. It has been adapted several times, complete or in part, for radio, television, stage and [[The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)|cinema]].

The books contain Christian ideas intended to be easily accessible to young readers. In addition to Christian themes, Lewis also borrows characters from [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]] as well as traditional British and Irish fairy tales.

====Other works====
Lewis wrote a number of works on Heaven and Hell. One of these, ''[[The Great Divorce]]'', is a short novella in which a few residents of Hell take a bus ride to Heaven, where they are met by people who dwell there. The proposition is that they can stay (in which case they can call the place where they had come from &quot;[[Purgatory]]&quot;, instead of &quot;Hell&quot;); but many find it not to their taste. The title is a reference to [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', a concept that Lewis found a &quot;disastrous error&quot; {{Harvard citation|Lewis|1946|p=vii}}. This work deliberately echoes two other more famous works with a similar theme: the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' of [[Dante Alighieri]], and Bunyan's ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''. Another short work, ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]'', consists of suave letters of advice from a senior [[demon]], Screwtape, to his nephew Wormwood, on the best ways to tempt a particular human and secure his [[Damnation#Religious|damnation]]. Lewis's last novel was ''[[Till We Have Faces]]'', which he thought of as his most mature and masterly work of fiction but which was never a popular success. It is a retelling of the myth of [[Cupid and Psyche]] from the unusual perspective of Psyche's sister. It is deeply concerned with religious ideas, but the setting is entirely [[paganism|pagan]], and the connections with specific Christian beliefs are left implicit.

Before Lewis's conversion to Christianity, he published two books: ''[[Spirits in Bondage]]'', a collection of poems, and ''[[Dymer]]'', a single [[narrative poetry|narrative poem]]. Both were published under the pen name Clive Hamilton.

He also wrote [[The Four Loves]], which rhetorically explains four loves including friendship, eros, affection, and charity or caritas.

In 2009, a partial draft of [[Language and Human Nature]], which Lewis had begun co-writing with J.R.R. Tolkien, but which was never completed, was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.txstate.edu/news/news_releases/news_archive/2009/07/CSLewis070809.html |title=Beebe discovers unpublished C.S. Lewis manuscript : University News Service : Texas State University |publisher=Txstate.edu |date=8 July 2009 |accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian apologist===
In addition to his career as an English professor and an author of fiction, Lewis is regarded by many as one of the most influential [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologists]] of his time; ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' was voted best book of the twentieth century by ''[[Christianity Today]]'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/april24/5.92.html |title=Books of the Century | accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Lewis's approach to religious belief as a skeptic, and his following conversion, he has been called &quot;The Apostle to the Skeptics.&quot;

Lewis was very interested in presenting a reasonable case for the truth of Christianity. ''Mere Christianity'', ''[[The Problem of Pain]]'', and ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'' were all concerned, to one degree or another, with refuting popular objections to Christianity, such as &quot;How could a good God allow pain to exist in the world?&quot;. He also became known as a popular lecturer and broadcaster, and some of his writing (including much of ''Mere Christianity'') originated as scripts for radio talks or lectures.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1952) Mere Christianity; p. v&lt;/ref&gt;

According to George Sayer, a loss in a 1948 debate with [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Elizabeth Anscombe]], also a Christian, led Lewis to reevaluate his role as an apologist, and his future works concentrated on devotional literature and children's books.&lt;ref name=rilstone-refuted&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aslan.demon.co.uk/cslfaq.htm#_Toc5085891 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021202084439/http://www.aslan.demon.co.uk/cslfaq.htm#_Toc5085891 |archivedate=2 December 2002 |title=Were Lewis's proofs of the existence of God from 'Miracles' refuted by Elizabeth Anscombe? |work=Frequently Asked Questions Alt.books.cs-lewis |first=Andrew |last=Rilstone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anscombe, however, had a completely different recollection of the debate's outcome and its emotional effect on Lewis.&lt;ref name=rilstone-refuted/&gt; Victor Reppert also disputes Sayer, listing some of Lewis's post-1948 apologetic publications, including the second and revised edition of his ''Miracles'' in 1960, in which Lewis addressed Anscombe's criticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reppert 2005 http://books.google.com/books?id=hn1gaNlri1cC&amp;pg=PA266 266&quot;&gt;{{Citation |first=Victor |last=Reppert |authorlink=Victor Reppert |chapter=The Green Witch and the Great Debate: Freeing Narnia from the Spell of the Lewis-Anscombe Legend |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=hn1gaNlri1cC&amp;pg=PA260 |editor=Gregory Bassham and Jerry L.

Certainly Anscombe herself believed that Lewis' argument, though flawed, was getting at something very important; she thought that this came out more in the improved version of it that Lewis presented in a subsequent edition of ''Miracles'' – though that version also had 'much to criticize in it'.&quot;

Lewis also wrote an autobiography titled ''Surprised by Joy'', which places special emphasis on his own conversion. (It was written before he met his wife, Joy Gresham; the title of the book came from the first line of a poem by [[William Wordsworth]].) His essays and public speeches on Christian belief, many of which were collected in ''[[God in the Dock]]'' and ''[[The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses]]'', remain popular today.

His most famous works, the ''Chronicles of Narnia'', contain many strong Christian messages and are often considered [[allegory]]. Lewis, an expert on the subject of allegory, maintained that the books were not allegory, and preferred to call the Christian aspects of them &quot;[[supposition]]al&quot;. As Lewis wrote in a letter to a Mrs. Hook in December 1958:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If Aslan represented the immaterial Deity in the same way in which Giant Despair &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;a character in ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; represents despair, he would be an allegorical figure. In reality however he is an invention giving an imaginary answer to the question, 'What might Christ become like, if there really were a world like Narnia and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours?' This is not allegory at all. {{Harvard citation|Martindale|Root|1990|pp=}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====&quot;Trilemma&quot;====
{{Main|Lewis's trilemma}}
In a much-cited passage from ''Mere Christianity'', Lewis challenged the view that Jesus, although a great moral teacher, was not God. He argued that Jesus made several implicit claims to divinity, which would logically exclude this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: 'I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don’t accept his claim to be God.' That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a [[poached egg]] — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the [[Son of God]], or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. {{Harvard citation|Lewis|1952|p=43}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This argument, which Lewis did not invent but developed and popularised, is sometimes referred to as &quot;[[Lewis's trilemma]]&quot;. It has been used by the Christian apologist [[Josh McDowell]] in his book ''More Than a Carpenter'' {{Harvard citation|McDowell|2001}}. Although widely repeated in Christian apologetic literature, it has been largely ignored by professional theologians and biblical scholars and is regarded by some as logically unsound and an example of [[false dilemma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Stephen T. |last=Davis |chapter=Was Jesus Mad, Bad, or God? |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=xLtu0IwjK5oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA221,M1 |editor=Stephen T.

Lewis's Christian apologetics, and this argument in particular, have been criticized. Philosopher John Beversluis described Lewis's arguments as &quot;textually careless and theologically unreliable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=John |last=Beversluis |title=C.S.

T. Wright]], who, unlike Hicks, does believe in Jesus divinity, comments that Lewis' approach to Jesus' identity, by ignoring his Jewish background, &quot;doesn't work as history, and it backfires dangerously when historical critics question his reading of the gospels.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=N.

Lewis used a similar argument in ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', when [[Digory Kirke]] advises the young heroes that their sister's claims of a magical world must logically be taken as either lies, madness, or truth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reppert 2005 http://books.google.com/books?id=hn1gaNlri1cC&amp;pg=PA266 266&quot; /&gt;

====Universal morality====
One of the main theses in Lewis's apologia is that there is a common morality known throughout humanity. In the first five chapters of ''Mere Christianity'' Lewis discusses the idea that people have a standard of behaviour to which they expect other people to adhere. This standard has been called Universal Morality or [[Natural Law]]. Lewis claims that people all over the earth know what this law is and when they break it. He goes on to claim that there must be someone or something behind such a universal set of principles. {{harvard citation|Lindskoog|2001b|p=144}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
These then are the two points that I wanted to make. First, that human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of it. Secondly, that they do not in fact behave in that way. They know the Law of Nature; they break it. These two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in. {{harvard citation|Lewis|1952|p=21}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Lewis also portrays Universal Morality in his works of fiction. In ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' he describes Universal Morality as the &quot;Deep magic&quot; which everyone knew. {{harvard citation|Lindskoog|2001b|p=146}}

In the second chapter of ''Mere Christianity'' Lewis recognizes that &quot;many people find it difficult to understand what this Law of Human Nature [...] is&quot;. And he responds first to the idea &quot;that the Moral Law is simply our herd instinct&quot; and second to the idea &quot;that the Moral Law is simply a social convention&quot;. In responding to the second idea Lewis notes that people often complain that one set of moral ideas is better than another, but that this actually argues for there existing some &quot;Real Morality&quot; to which they are comparing other moralities. Finally he notes that sometimes differences in moral codes are exaggerated by people who confuse differences in beliefs about morality with differences in beliefs about facts:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have met people who exaggerate the differences, because they have not distinguished between differences of morality and differences of belief about facts. For example, one man said to me, &quot;Three hundred years ago people in England were putting witches to death. Was that what you call the Rule of Human Nature or Right Conduct?&quot; But surely the reason we do not execute witches is that we do not believe there are such things. If we did — if we really thought that there were people going about who had sold themselves to the devil and received supernatural powers from him in return and were using these powers to kill their neighbours or drive them mad or bring bad weather, surely we would all agree that if anyone deserved the death penalty, then these filthy [[quisling]]s did. There is no difference of moral principle here: the difference is simply about matter of fact. It may be a great advance in knowledge not to believe in witches: there is no moral advance in not executing them when you do not think they are there. You would not call a man humane for ceasing to set mousetraps if he did so because he believed there were no mice in the house. {{harvard citation|Lewis|1952|p=26}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lewis also had fairly progressive views on the topic of &quot;animal morality&quot;, in particular the suffering of animals, as is evidenced by several of his essays: most notably, ''On Vivisection''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Irish Anti-Vivisection Society | accessdate = 2 August 2009 | url = http://www.irishantivivisection.org/cslewis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;On the Pains of Animals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=C.S.

==Legacy==
[[Image:Statue of C.S. Lewis, Belfast.jpg|thumb|200px|A statue of [[Digory Kirke]] from ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'') in front of the wardrobe of his book ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' in East [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland]]

Lewis continues to attract a wide readership. In 2008, ''[[The Times]]'' ranked him eleventh on their list of &quot;the 50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3127837.ece &quot;The 50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;]. ''The Times''. 5 January 2008. Retrieved on 2010-02-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Readers of his fiction are often unaware of what Lewis considered the Christian themes of his works. His Christian apologetics are read and quoted by members of many [[Christian denomination]]s, from Catholics to Mormons {{Harvard citation|Pratt|1998}}.

Lewis has been the subject of several biographies, a few of which were written by some of his close friends, such as [[Roger Lancelyn Green]] and George Sayer. In 1985 the screenplay ''[[Shadowlands]]'' by [[William Nicholson (writer)|William Nicholson]], dramatizing Lewis's life and relationship with Joy Davidman Gresham, was aired on British TV (starring [[Joss Ackland]] as Lewis and [[Claire Bloom]] as Joy). In 1989 this was staged as a theatre play (starring [[Nigel Hawthorne]]) and in 1993 ''Shadowlands'' became a feature [[Shadowlands (film)|film]], starring [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Lewis and [[Debra Winger]] as Joy. In 2005, a one hour made for TV movie entitled ''C. S. Lewis: Beyond Narnia'' (starring [[Anton Rodgers]]) provided a general synopsis of Lewis's life.

Many books have been inspired by Lewis, including ''[[A Severe Mercy]]'' by his correspondent and friend [[Sheldon Vanauken]]. ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' have been particularly influential. Modern children's literature such as [[Daniel Handler]]'s ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'', [[Eoin Colfer]]'s ''[[Artemis Fowl (series)|Artemis Fowl]]'', [[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[His Dark Materials]]'', and [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' have been more or less influenced by Lewis's series {{harvard citation|Hilliard|2005|pp=}}. Pullman, an [[atheism|atheist]] and so fierce a critic of Lewis's work as to be dubbed &quot;the anti-Lewis&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/124392.html |title=A Secular Fantasy — The flawed but fascinating fiction of Philip Pullman, by Cathy Young |publisher=Reason.com |accessdate=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://home.wlv.ac.uk/~bu1895/hitchens.htm |title=Philip Pullman by Peter Hitchens|publisher=The Mail on Sunday, 27 January 2002, page 63 |accessdate=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; considers him a negative influence and has accused Lewis of featuring religious propaganda, misogyny, racism and emotional sadism {{harvard citation|BBC News|2005|p=}} in his books. Authors of adult fantasy literature such as [[Tim Powers]] have also testified to being influenced by Lewis's work.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce L. Edwards, ''C.S. Lewis: life, works, and legacy'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007. pp 305-307&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Lewis’ posthumous work has been edited by his literary executor, [[Walter Hooper]]. An independent Lewis scholar, the late [[Kathryn Lindskoog]], argued that Hooper's scholarship is not reliable and that he has made false statements and attributed forged works to Lewis {{Harvard citation|Lindskoog|2001}}. C. S. Lewis's stepson, [[Douglas Gresham]], denies the forgery claims, saying that &quot;The whole controversy thing was engineered for very personal reasons... Her fanciful theories have been pretty thoroughly discredited.&quot; {{Harvard citation|Gresham|2007}}.

A bronze statue of Lewis's character Digory, from ''The Magician's Nephew'', stands in Belfast's Holywood Arches in front of the Holywood Road Library {{Harvard citation|BBC News|2004}}.

Lewis was strongly opposed to the creation of live-action versions of his works. His major concern was that the anthropomorphic animal characters &quot;when taken out of narrative into actual visibility, always turn into buffoonery or nightmare&quot;. This was said in the context of the 1950s, when technology would not allow the special effects required to make a coherent, robust film version of Narnia.

Several C. S. Lewis Societies exist around the world, including one which was founded in Oxford in 1982 to discuss papers on the life and works of Lewis and the other Inklings, and generally appreciate all things Lewisian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lewisinoxford.googlepages.com |title=Oxford University C. S. Lewis Society |publisher=lewisinoxford.googlepages.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name is also used by a variety of Christian organizations, often with a concern for maintaining [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] values in education or literary studies.

The 2005 film adaptation of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe|The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]]'' was based on the first installment of the Narnia series. Film adaptations have been made of two other books he wrote: ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian|Prince Caspian]]'' (released on 16 May 2008) and ''[[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]'' (released on 2 December 2010). A film adaptation of ''[[The Great Divorce]]'' is slated for release in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1482458/ |title=The Great Divorce |year=2011 |publisher=IMDb |accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis is featured as a main character in the Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica series by John A. Owen

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:ChineseDominoes.jpg|thumb|right|A set of Chinese dominoes]]
'''Chinese [[domino]]es''' are used in several [[tile-based game]]s, namely, [[Tien Gow]], [[Pai Gow]], [[Che Deng]], [[Tiu U]] and [[Kap Tai Shap]].   In [[Cantonese]] they are called 骨牌 &quot;Gwat Pai&quot;, which literally means &quot;bone tiles&quot;, it is also the name of a northern Chinese game, where the rules are quite different from the southern Chinese game Tien Gow. References to Chinese domino tiles can be traced to writings from the [[Song Dynasty (960-1279)|Song Dynasty]] (AD 1120). Chinese dominoes should not be confused with [[mahjong]] tiles, which use a different tileset.

==Deck Composition and Ranking==
Each tile pattern in the Chinese domino set is made up of the outcome of a throw of two six-sided [[dice]].  There are therefore 21 unique patterns.  A tile set consists of 32 tiles in two &quot;suits&quot; or groups called &quot;military&quot; and &quot;civilian&quot;.  There are no markings on the tiles to distinguish these suits; a player must simply remember which tiles belong to which group.

The tile set contains two each of eleven civilian suit tiles (6-6, 1-1, 4-4, 1-3, 5-5, 3-3, 2-2, 5-6, 4-6, 1-6, 1-5) and one each of ten military suit tiles (3-6, 4-5; 2-6, 3-5; 2-5, 3-4; 2-4; 1-4, 2-3; 1-2).  Each civilian tile also has a Chinese name (and common rough translation to English): The 6-6 is ''tin'' (天 heaven), 1-1 is ''dei'' ([[地]] earth), 4-4 is ''yan'' (人 man), 1-3 is ''ngo'' (鵝 goose or 和 harmony), 5-5 is ''mui'' (梅 [[Prunus mume|plum]] flower), 3-3 is ''cheung'' (長 long), 2-2 is ''ban'' (板 board), 5-6 is ''fu'' ([[斧]] hatchet), 4-6 is ''ping'' (屏 partition), 1-6 is ''tsat'' (七) (long leg seven), and 1-5 is ''luk'' (六) (big head six).

The civilian tiles are ranked according to the Chinese cultural significance of the tile names, and must be memorized.  For example, heaven ranks higher than earth; earth ranks higher than man etc.  Remembering the suits and rankings of the tiles is easier if one understands the Chinese names of the tiles and the symbolism behind them.  
The military tiles are named and ranked according to the total points on the tiles.  For example, the &quot;nines&quot; (3-6 and 4-5) rank higher than the &quot;eights&quot; (2-6 and 3-5).

The military tiles (since there is only one each) are also considered to be five mixed &quot;pairs&quot; (for example, the 3-6 and 4-5 tiles &quot;match&quot; because they have same total points and both in the military suit).  Among the military tiles, individual tiles of the same pair (such as 1-4 and 2-3) rank equally.   The 2-4 and 1-2 are an odd pair.  They are the only tiles in the whole set that don't match other tiles in the normal sense.  This pair when played together is considered a suit on its own, called the Gee Joon (至尊 Supreme).  It is the highest ranking pair in the game of Pai Gow, though the tiles rank low individually (in their normal order).  When a tile of this pair is played individually in the game of Tien Gow, each takes its regular ranking among other military suit tiles according to the total points.  The rankings of the individual tiles are similar in most games.  However, the ranking of combination tiles is slightly different in Pai Gow and Tien Gow.

Using the same coloring scheme of the traditional [[Chinese dice]], every half-domino with 1 or 4 spots has those spots colored red (for example, the 4-5 domino has four red spots and five white spots).  The only exception is the pair of 6-6 tiles.  Half of the spots on the 6-6 domino are colored red to make them stand out as the top ranking tiles.

'''Che Deng''' (斜釘, Cantonese: che4 deng1) literally means ''diagonal nails'' in [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]. It is the name of a Chinese game that plays with the [[Chinese dominoes]] set.

''Che'' refers to the diagonal pattern of the &quot;three&quot; pip on the tile.
''Deng'' refers to the &quot;one&quot; pip on the tile.

It is marked by the [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event]] at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] that saw the demise of the last non-avian [[dinosaur]]s and the end of the [[Mesozoic]] Era. The Cenozoic era is ongoing.

==Subdivision==

[[Australia (continent)|Australia-New Guinea]], having split from [[Gondwana]] during the early Cretaceous, drifted north and, eventually, collided with [[South-east Asia]]; [[Antarctica]] moved into its current position over the [[South Pole]]; the [[Atlantic Ocean]] widened and, later in the era, [[South America]] became attached to [[North America]].

India collided with Asia between 55 and 45 mya; Arabia collided with Eurasia, closing the [[Tethys ocean]], around {{Ma|35}}.&lt;ref name=Allen2008&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.04.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
The Cenozoic Era has been a period of long-term cooling. After the tectonic creation of [[Drake Passage]], when South America fully detached from Antarctica during the [[Oligocene]], the climate cooled significantly due to the advent of the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] which brought cool deep Antarctic water to the surface. The cooling trend continued in the [[Miocene]], with relatively short warmer periods. When South America became attached to North America creating the [[Isthmus of Panama]], the Arctic region cooled due to the strengthening of the [[Humboldt Current|Humboldt]] and [[Gulf Stream]] currents,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/viewArticle.do?id=2508&lt;/ref&gt; eventually leading to the glaciations of the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]], the current [[interglacial]] of which is the [[Holocene]] epoch.

==Life==
During the Cenozoic, [[Mammal_evolution#Expansion_of_ecological_niches_in_the_Mesozoic|mammals diverged]] from a few small, simple, generalized forms into a diverse collection of [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], [[Marine mammal|marine]], and [[bat|flying]] animals, giving this period its other name, the Age of Mammals, despite the fact that [[bird]]s still outnumbered mammals two to one.  The Cenozoic is just as much the age of [[savanna]]s, the age of co-dependent [[flowering plant]]s and [[insect]]s, and the age of birds. [[Grass]] also played a very important role in this era, shaping the evolution of the birds and mammals that fed on it. One group that diversified significantly in the Cenozoic as well were the [[snake]]s. Evolving in the Cenozoic, the variety of snakes increased tremendously, resulting in many [[colubrids]], following the evolution of their current primary prey source, the [[rodent]]s.

In the earlier part of the Cenozoic, the world was dominated by the [[Gastornithiformes|gastornid]] birds, terrestrial [[Crocodilia|crocodile]]s like [[Pristichampsus]], and a handful of primitive large mammal groups like [[uintathere]]s, [[mesonychid]]s, and [[pantodont]]s. But as the forests began to recede and the climate began to cool, other mammals took over. The cenozoic is full of mammals both strange and familiar, including [[chalicothere]]s, [[creodont]]s, [[whale]]s, [[primates]], [[entelodont]]s, [[saber-toothed cats]], [[mastodon]]s and [[mammoth]]s, [[three-toed horse]]s, giant [[rhinoceros]] like ''[[Indricotherium]]'', and [[brontothere]]s.

'''Confucianism''' is a Chinese ethical and philosophical system developed from the teachings of the Chinese philosopher [[Confucius]] (Kǒng Fūzǐ, or K'ung-fu-tzu, lit. &quot;Master Kong&quot;, 551–478 BC). It is a complex system of moral, social, political, [[Chinese philosophy|philosophical]], and quasi-religious thought that influenced the culture and history of East Asia. It might be considered a [[state religion]] of some East Asian countries, because of state promotion of Confucian philosophies.

Cultures and countries strongly influenced by Confucianism include mainland [[Culture of China|China]], [[Culture of Taiwan|Taiwan]], [[Culture of Korea|Korea]], [[Culture of Japan|Japan]] and [[Culture of Vietnam|Vietnam]], as well as various territories settled predominantly by [[Han Chinese|Chinese people]], such as [[Culture of Singapore|Singapore]]. It might be that as many as 1.5 billion people follow Confucian ideals, according to Rick Cornish.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=oOYQbqxfIk4C&amp;pg=PT193&amp;dq=1.5+billion+confucianism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KqpiTcz6O8y28QOP-YXyCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1.5%20billion%20confucianism&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

In Confucianism, human beings are teachable, improvable and perfectible through personal and communal endeavour especially including self-cultivation and self-creation. A main idea of Confucianism is the cultivation of virtue and the development of moral perfection. Confucianism holds that one should give up one's life, if necessary, either passively or actively, for the sake of upholding the cardinal moral values of ''ren'' and ''yi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://arts.hkbu.edu.hk/~pclo/e5.pdf|author=Lo, Ping-cheung|title=Confucian Ethic of Death with Dignity and Its Contemporary Relevance|date=1999|publisher=Society of Christian Ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes in Confucian thought==
{{Ref improve section|date=September 2009}}

Humanity is core in Confucianism. A simple way to appreciate Confucian thought is to consider it as being based on varying levels of honesty, and a simple way to understand Confucian thought is to examine the world by using the logic of humanity. In practice, the elements of Confucianism accumulated over time. There is classical Wuchang (五常) consisting of five elements: [[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]] (仁, Humanity), [[Yi (Confucianism)|Yi]] (義, Righteousness), [[Li (Confucianism)|Li]] (禮, Ritual), Zhi (智, Knowledge), Xin (信, Integrity), and there is also classical Sizi (四字) with four elements: Zhong (忠, Loyalty), Xiao (孝, Filial piety), Jie (節, Continency), Yi (義, Righteousness). There are still many other elements, such as Cheng (誠, honesty), Shu (恕, kindness and forgiveness), Lian (廉, honesty and cleanness), Chi (恥, shame, judge and sense of right and wrong), Yong (勇, bravery), Wen (溫, kind and gentle), Liang (良, good, kindhearted), Gong (恭, respectful, reverent), Jian(儉, frugal), Rang (讓, modestly, self-effacing). Among all elements, Ren (Humanity) and Yi (Righteousness) are fundamental. Sometimes morality is interpreted as the phantom of Humanity and Righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Yuandao&quot; by [[Han Yu]]: Ren and Yi are specific names, Dao and De (Dao De means morality) are phantom position(韓愈《原道》：仁與義，為定名；道與德，為虛位。)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanity===
{{Main|Ren (Confucianism)}}

Ritual and filial piety are indeed the ways in which one should act towards others, but from an underlying attitude of humaneness. Confucius' concept of humaneness ({{zh|c=[[wikt:仁|仁]]|p=rén}}) is probably best expressed in the Confucian version of the [[Ethic of reciprocity]], or the ''Golden Rule'': &quot;do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto you.&quot;

Confucius never stated whether man was born good or evil,&lt;ref&gt;Homer H. Dubs: 'Nature in the Teaching of Confucius', p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; noting that 'By nature men are similar; by practice men are wide apart' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.confucius.org/lunyu/cd1702.htm Lun Yu (Yang Huo) 13 May 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;implying that whether good or bad, Confucius must have perceived all men to be born with intrinsic similarities, but that man is conditioned and inﬂuenced by study and practise. [[Xunzi]]'s opinion is that men originally just want what they instinctively want despite positive or negative results it may bring, so cultivation is needed. In Mencius' view, all men are born to share goodness such as compassion and good heart, although they may become wicked. The [[Three Character Classic]] begins with &quot;People at birth are naturally good (kind-hearted)&quot;, which stems from Mencius' idea. All the views eventually lead to recognize the importance of human education and cultivation.

''Rén'' also has a political dimension. If the ruler lacks ''rén'', Confucianism holds, it will be difficult if not impossible for his subjects to behave humanely. ''Rén'' is the basis of Confucian political theory: it presupposes an autocratic ruler, exhorted to refrain from acting inhumanely towards his subjects. An inhumane ruler runs the risk of losing the &quot;Mandate of Heaven&quot;, the right to rule. A ruler lacking such a mandate need not be obeyed. But a ruler who reigns humanely and takes care of the people is to be obeyed strictly, for the benevolence of his dominion shows that he has been mandated by heaven. Confucius himself had little to say on the will of the people, but his leading follower [[Mencius]] did state on one occasion that the people's opinion on certain weighty matters should be considered.

===Ritual===
{{Main|Li (Confucianism)}}
In Confucianism the term &quot;[[ritual]]&quot; ({{zh|c=[[wikt:禮|禮]]|p=lǐ}}) was soon extended to include [[secular]] ceremonial behavior, and eventually referred also to the [[propriety]] or politeness which colors everyday life. Rituals were codified and treated as a comprehensive system of norms. Confucius himself tried to revive the [[etiquette]] of earlier dynasties. After his death, people regarded him as a great authority on ritual behaviors.

It is important to note that &quot;ritual&quot; has developed a specialized meaning in Confucianism, as opposed to its usual religious meanings. In Confucianism, the acts of everyday life are considered ritual. Rituals are not necessarily regimented or arbitrary practices, but the routines that people often engage in, knowingly or unknowingly, during the normal course of their lives. Shaping the rituals in a way that leads to a content and healthy society, and to content and healthy people, is one purpose of Confucian philosophy.

;The Rites
{{Unreferenced|section|date=November 2009}}
Translations from the 17th century to the present have varied widely. Comparison of these many sources is needed for a true &quot;general consensus&quot; of what message Confucius meant to imply.

Confucius argued that under law, ''external'' authorities administer punishments ''after'' illegal actions, so people generally behave well without understanding reasons why they should; whereas with ritual, patterns of behavior are ''[[internalized]]'' and exert their influence ''before'' actions are taken, so people behave properly because they fear shame and want to avoid [[Face (social concept)|losing face]]. In this sense, &quot;rite&quot; ({{zh|c=[[wikt:禮|禮]]|p=[[Li (Confucian)|lǐ]]}}) is an ideal form of social norm.

The Chinese character for &quot;rites&quot;, or &quot;ritual&quot;, previously had the religious meaning of &quot;sacrifice&quot;. Its Confucian meaning ranges from politeness and propriety to the understanding of each person's correct place in society. Externally, ritual is used to distinguish between people; their usage allows people to know at all times who is the younger and who the elder, who is the guest and who the host and so forth. Internally, rites indicate to people their duty amongst others and what to expect from them.

Internalization is the main process in ritual. Formalized behavior becomes progressively internalized, desires are channeled and personal cultivation becomes the mark of social correctness. Though this idea conflicts with the common saying that &quot;the cowl does not make the monk,&quot; in Confucianism sincerity is what enables behavior to be absorbed by individuals. Obeying ritual with sincerity makes ritual the most powerful way to cultivate oneself:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Respectfulness, without the Rites, becomes laborious bustle; carefulness, without the Rites, become timidity; boldness, without the Rites, becomes insubordination; straightforwardness, without the Rites, becomes rudeness. (''Analects'' VIII, 2)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ritual can be seen as a means to find the balance between opposing qualities that might otherwise lead to conflict. It divides people into categories, and builds [[hierarchical]] relationships through protocols and ceremonies, assigning everyone a place in society and a proper form of behavior. Music, which seems to have played a significant role in Confucius' life, is given as an exception, as it transcends such boundaries and &quot;unifies the hearts&quot;.

Although the Analects heavily promote the rites, Confucius himself often behaved other than in accord with them.

===Loyalty===
Loyalty ({{zh|c=[[wikt:忠|忠]]|p=zhōng}}) is the equivalent of filial piety on a different plane. It is particularly relevant for the social class to which most of Confucius' students belonged, because the only way for an ambitious young scholar to make his way in the Confucian Chinese world was to enter a ruler's civil service. Like filial piety, however, loyalty was often subverted by the autocratic regimes of China. Confucius had advocated a sensitivity to the [[realpolitik]] of the class relations in his time; he did not propose that &quot;might makes right&quot;, but that a superior who had received the &quot;[[Mandate of Heaven]]&quot; (see below) should be obeyed because of his moral rectitude.

In later ages, however, emphasis was placed more on the obligations of the ruled to the ruler, and less on the ruler's obligations to the ruled.

Loyalty was also an extension of one's duties to friends, family, and spouse. Loyalty to one's family came first, then to one's spouse, then to one's ruler, and lastly to one's friends. Loyalty was considered one of the greater human virtues.

Confucius also realized that loyalty and filial piety can potentially conflict.

===Filial piety===
{{Main|Filial piety}}
&quot;Filial piety&quot; ({{zh|c=[[wikt:孝|孝]]|p=xiào}}) is considered among the greatest of virtues and must be shown towards both the living and the dead (including even remote ancestors). The term &quot;filial&quot; (meaning &quot;of a child&quot;) characterizes the respect that a child, originally a son, should show to his parents. This relationship was extended by analogy to a series of ''five relationships'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:五|五]][[wikt:倫|倫]]|p=wǔlún}}):&lt;ref&gt;[http://ias.berkeley.edu/orias/summer2004/summer2004Chinalegal.htm Chinese Legal Theories&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Bonds
* Ruler to Ruled
* Father to Son
* Husband to Wife
* Elder Brother to Younger Brother
* Friend to Friend

Specific duties were prescribed to each of the participants in these sets of relationships. Such duties were also extended to the dead, where the living stood as sons to their deceased family. This led to the veneration of ancestors. The only relationship where respect for elders wasn't stressed was the Friend to Friend relationship. In all other relationships, high reverence was held for elders.

The idea of Filial piety influenced the Chinese legal system: a criminal would be punished more harshly if the culprit had committed the crime against a parent, while fathers often exercised enormous power over their children. A similar differentiation was applied to other relationships. Now{{Clarify|pre-text=PROC?|date=May 2011}} filial piety is also built into law. People have the responsibility to provide for their elderly parents according to the law.

The main source of our knowledge of the importance of filial piety is [[Xiao Jing|''The Book of Filial Piety'']], a work attributed to Confucius and his son but almost certainly written in the 3rd century BCE. The Analects, the main source of the Confucianism of Confucius, actually has little to say on the matter of filial piety and some sources believe the concept was focused on by later thinkers as a response to [[Mohism]].

Filial piety has continued to play a central role in Confucian thinking to the present day.

===Relationships===
Relationships are central to Confucianism. Particular duties arise from one's particular situation in relation to others. The individual stands simultaneously in several different relationships with different people: as a junior in relation to parents and elders, and as a senior in relation to younger siblings, students, and others. While juniors are considered in Confucianism to owe their seniors reverence, seniors also have duties of [[benevolence]] and concern toward juniors. This theme of [[mutuality]] is prevalent in East Asian cultures even to this day.

Social harmony—the great goal of Confucianism—therefore results in part from every individual knowing his or her place in the social order, and playing his or her part well. When Duke Jing of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] asked about government, by which he meant proper administration so as to bring social harmony, Confucius replied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son. (''Analects'' XII, 11, trans. Legge)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mencius says: &quot;When being a child, yearn for and love your parents; when growing mature, yearn for and love your lassie; when having wife and child(ren), yearn for and love your wife and child(ren); when being an official (or a staffer), yearn for and love your sovereign (and/or boss).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;孟子：人少，則慕父母；知好色，則慕少艾；有妻子，則慕妻子；仕則慕君&lt;/ref&gt;{{Cite quote}}&lt;!--We need an English source: this looks like a very amateur translation--&gt;

===The gentleman===
{{Main|Junzi}}
The term ''jūnzǐ'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:君|君]][[wikt:子|子]]|l=lord's child}}) is crucial to classical Confucianism. Confucianism exhorts all people to strive for the ideal of a &quot;gentleman&quot; or &quot;perfect man&quot;. A succinct description of the &quot;perfect man&quot; is one who &quot;combines the qualities of saint, scholar, and gentleman.&quot; In modern times the masculine translation in English is also traditional and is still frequently used. [[Elitism]] was bound up with the concept, and gentlemen were expected to act as moral guides to the rest of society.

They were to:
* cultivate themselves morally;
* show filial piety and loyalty where these are due;
* cultivate humanity, or benevolence.

The great exemplar of the perfect gentleman is Confucius himself. Perhaps the tragedy of his life was that he was never awarded the high official position which he desired, from which he wished to demonstrate the general well-being that would ensue if humane persons ruled and administered the state.

The opposite of the ''Jūnzǐ'' was the ''Xiǎorén'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:小|小]][[wikt:人|人]]|p=xiǎorén|l=small person}}). The character 小 in this context means petty in mind and heart, narrowly self-interested, greedy, superficial, or materialistic.

===Rectification of names===
{{Main|Rectification of Names}}
Confucius believed that social disorder often stemmed from failure to perceive, understand, and deal with reality. Fundamentally, then, social disorder can stem from the failure to call things by their proper names, and his solution to this was ''Zhèngmíng'' ({{zh|c=[正名]|p=zhèngmíng|l=rectification of terms}}). He gave an explanation of ''zhengming'' to one of his disciples.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Zi-lu said, &quot;The ruler of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The Master replied, &quot;What is necessary to rectify names.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;So! indeed!&quot; said Zi-lu. &quot;You are wide off the mark! Why must there be such rectification?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The Master said, &quot;How uncultivated you are, Yu! A superior man, in regard to what he does not know, shows a cautious reserve.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
(''Analects'' XIII, 3, tr. Legge)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Xun Zi]] chapter (22) &quot;On the Rectification of Names&quot; claims the ancient sage-kings chose names ({{zh|c=[名]|p=míng}}) that directly corresponded with actualities ({{zh|c=[實]|p=shí}}), but later generations confused terminology, coined new nomenclature, and thus could no longer distinguish right from wrong.

==Governance==
[[Image:Lotusconfuciustemple2.jpg|thumb|250px|Confucian temple in [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taiwan]], [[Republic of China]]]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To govern by virtue, let us compare it to the North Star: it stays in its place, while the myriad stars wait upon it. (''Analects'' II, 1)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Another key Confucian concept is that in order to govern others one must first govern oneself. When developed sufficiently, the king's personal virtue spreads beneficent influence throughout the kingdom. This idea is developed further in the [[Great Learning]], and is tightly linked with the [[Taoism|Taoist]] concept of [[wu wei]] ({{zh|t=無為|s=无为|p=wú wéi}}): the less the king does, the more gets done. By being the &quot;calm center&quot; around which the kingdom turns, the king allows everything to function smoothly and avoids having to tamper with the individual parts of the whole.

This idea may be traced back to early Chinese shamanistic beliefs, such as the king being the axle between the sky, human beings, and the Earth. Another complementary view is that this idea may have been used by ministers and counselors to deter aristocratic whims that would otherwise be to the detriment of the state's people.

==Meritocracy==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In teaching, there should be no distinction of classes. (''Analects'' XV, 39)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The main basis of his teachings was to seek knowledge, study, and become a better person.

Although Confucius claimed that he never invented anything but was only transmitting ancient knowledge (see ''Analects'' VII, 1), he did produce a number of new ideas. Many European and American admirers such as [[Voltaire]] and [[H. G. Creel]] point to the revolutionary idea of replacing nobility of blood with nobility of virtue. Jūnzǐ (君子, lit. &quot;lord's child&quot;), which originally signified the younger, non-inheriting, offspring of a noble, became, in Confucius' work, an epithet having much the same meaning and evolution as the English &quot;gentleman&quot;. A virtuous plebeian who cultivates his qualities can be a &quot;gentleman&quot;, while a shameless son of the king is only a &quot;small man&quot;. That he admitted students of different classes as disciples is a clear demonstration that he fought against the feudal structures that defined pre-imperial Chinese society.

Another new idea, that of [[meritocracy]], led to the introduction of the [[Imperial examination]] system in China. This system allowed anyone who passed an examination to become a government officer, a position which would bring wealth and honour to the whole family. The Chinese Imperial examination system seems to have been started in 165 BC, when certain candidates for public office were called to the Chinese capital for examination of their moral excellence by the emperor. Over the following centuries the system grew until finally almost anyone who wished to become an official had to prove his worth by passing written government examinations.

His achievement was the setting up of a school that produced statesmen with a strong sense of patriotism and duty, known as Rujia ({{zh|c=[[wikt:儒|儒]][[wikt:家|家]]|p=Rújiā}}). During the [[Warring States Period]] and the early [[Han Dynasty]], China grew greatly and the need arose for a solid and centralized corporation of government officers able to read and write administrative papers. As a result, Confucianism was promoted by the emperor and the men its doctrines produced became an effective counter to the remaining feudal aristocrats who threatened the unity of the imperial state.

Since then Confucianism has been used as a kind of &quot;state religion&quot;, with authoritarianism, a kind of [[legitimism]], paternalism, and submission to authority used as political tools to rule China. Most Chinese emperors used a mix of Legalism and Confucianism as their ruling doctrine, often with the latter embellishing the former.

==Influence in 17th-century Europe==
[[Image:LifeAndWorksOfConfucius1687.jpg|thumb|&quot;Life and works of Confucius, by Prospero Intorcetta, 1687.]]
The works of Confucius were translated into European languages through the agency of [[Jesuit]] scholars stationed in China.&lt;ref&gt;The first was [[Michele Ruggieri]] who had returned from China to Italy in 1588, and carried on translating in Latin Chinese classics, while residing in Salerno&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matteo Ricci]] started to report on the thoughts of Confucius, and father Prospero Intorcetta published the life and works of Confucius into [[Latin]] in 1687.&lt;ref name=&quot;Windows into China&quot;&gt;&quot;Windows into China&quot;, John Parker, p.25, ISBN 0890730504&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that such works had considerable importance{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} on European thinkers{{Who|date=May 2009}} of the period, particularly among the [[Deists]] and other philosophical groups of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of Confucius into [[western world|Western civilization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Windows into China&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation]], John Hobson, pp 194–195, ISBN 0521547245&lt;/ref&gt;
==Influence in modern times==
Important military and political figures in modern Chinese history continued to be influenced by Confucianism, like the Muslim warlord [[Ma Fuxiang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MJzB6wrz6Q4C&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=ma+fuxiang+military+academy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_AadTPPfNIP78AaV-OVR&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20fuxiang%20confucianism%20%20northern&amp;f=false|title=Intellectuals in the modern Islamic world: transmission, transformation, communication|author=Stéphane A.

The [[Kuomintang]] party purged China's education system of western ideas, introducing Confucianism into the curriculum. Education came under the total control of state, which meant, in effect, the Kuomintang party, via the Ministry of Education. Military and political classes on the Kuomintang's Three principles of the people were added. Textbooks, exams, degrees and educational instructors were all controlled by the staet, as were all universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0Caknr1VAqMC&amp;dq=ma+bufang+communist+saw&amp;q=riding+it+of+western+texts+and+models#v=onepage&amp;q=it%20of%20western%20texts%20and%20models%20confucian&amp;f=false|title=China's communist revolutions: fifty years of the People's Republic of China|author=Werner Draguhn, David S.

==Criticism==
For many years since the era of Confucius, there have generated various critiques against Confucianism, including [[Laozi]]'s comment and [[Mozi]]'s critique. [[Lu Xun]] also criticised Confucianism heavily for shaping Chinese people into the state they became in the late [[Qing Dynasty]]: this is greatly portrayed through his works [[A Madman's Diary]] and [[The True Story of Ah Q]].

In modern times, waves of critique along with vilification against Confucianism arose. [[Taiping Rebellion]], [[May Fourth Movement]] and [[Cultural Revolution]] are some upsurges of those waves in China. Taiping rebels described many sages in Confucianism as well as gods in [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]] as bogie[?]. Marxists during Cultural Revolution described Confucius as the general representative of class of slave owners. Numerous opinions and interpretations of Confucianism of which many are actually opposed by Confucianism were invented.

&lt;!--{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} Confucius criticized tyranny, suppression of free speech, Xiangyuan (鄉願, hypocrisy or soft-flattery all no matter what the ideas, sayings or actions are), etc. Mencius's critiques include critiques against [[Yang Zhu]] and [[Mozi]]. There are also many critiques of Confucians against Confucians. --&gt;

Confucianism has a related principle idea called &quot;He Er Bu Tong&quot; (和而不同, peaceful but different or harmonious while diversified). Although people have differences in opinions, interests, preferences, profiles..., they should first keep peace, and people should live in harmony with each other and meanwhile keep their diversity. There are still other critique related Confucian ideas, e.g. ''If what others say is right and your fault is true, change it. If not, be careful of committing that kind of fault'' (有則改之,無則加勉), ''Learn others' virtues, and reflect on your own weak points when you see others''' (見賢思齊焉,見不賢而內自省).

===Women in Confucian thought===
Confucianism &quot;largely defined the mainstream discourse on gender in China from the [[Han dynasty]] onward,&quot;&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and its strict, obligatory gender roles as a cornerstone of family, and thus, societal stability, continue to shape social life throughout East Asia.  Confucians taught that a virtuous woman was supposed to uphold “three subordinations”: be subordinate to her father before marriage, to her husband after marriage, and to her son after her husband died. Men could remarry and have concubines, whereas women were supposed to uphold the virtue of chastity when they lost their husbands.&lt;ref name=Vohra&gt;{{Cite book | last = Vohra | first = Ranbir | title = China's Path to Modernization: A Historical Review from 1800 to the Present 3rd edition | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]]  | year = 1999 | isbn = 0130807478}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chaste widows were revered as heroes during the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] periods &lt;ref name=Adler&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Adler  | first = Joseph A.  | title = Daughter/Wife/Mother or Sage/Immortal/Bodhisattva?

The Biographies of Exemplary Women, or Lienü Zhuan, served as Confucianism's seminal textbook for Chinese women for two millennia, but cementing the &quot;cult of chastity&quot; as an exemplar of Chinese superiority also condemned many widows to lives of &quot;poverty and loneliness.&quot;&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, recent reexaminations of Chinese gender roles suggest that [[Daoism]] and the ying-yang dichotomy played an even greater part in stifling female roles, and that many women flourished within Confucianism&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  During the Han dynasty period, the important Confucian text [[Lessons for Women]] (Nüjie), was written by [[Ban Zhao]] (45-114 CE): by a woman, for women. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;She wrote the ''Nüjie'' ostensibly for her daughters, instructing them on how to live proper Confucian lives as wives and mothers. Although this is a relatively rare instance of a female Confucian voice, Ban Zhao almost entirely accepts the prevailing views concerning women's proper roles; they should be silent, hard-working, and compliant. She stresses the complementarity and equal importance of the male and female roles according to yin-yang theory, but she clearly accepts the dominance of the yang-male. Her only departure from the standard male versions of this orthodoxy is that she insists on the necessity to educate girls and women. We should not underestimate the significance of this point, as education was the bottom line qualification for being a junzi or &quot;noble person,&quot;...her example suggests that the Confucian prescription for a meaningful life as a woman was apparently not stifling for all women. Even some women of the literate elite, for whom Confucianism was quite explicitly the norm, were able to flourish by living their lives according to that model.&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Debate over classification==
There is debate about the classification of Confucianism as a religion or a philosophy. Many attributes common among religions—such as [[ancestor worship]], [[ritual]], and [[sacrifice]]—apply to the practice of Confucianism; however, the religious features found in Confucian texts can be traced to traditional non-Confucian Chinese beliefs ([[Chinese folk religion]]). The position adopted by some is that Confucianism is a moral science or philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~tkang/welcome_files/religion.htm Centre for Confucian Science (Korea)]; [http://urantiabook.org/archive/readers/601_confucianism.htm Introduction to Confucianism]&lt;/ref&gt; The problem clearly depends on how one defines religion. Since the 1970s scholars have attempted to assess the religious status of Confucianism without assuming a definition based on the Western model (for example, Frederick Streng's definition, &quot;a means of ultimate transformation&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Streng, Frederick, &quot;Understanding Religious Life,&quot; 3rd ed. (1985), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;). Under such a definition Confucianism can legitimately be considered a religious tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Rodney L., &quot;The Religious Dimensions of Confucianism&quot; (1990); Tu Weiming and Mary Evelyn Tucker, eds., &quot;Confucian Spirituality,&quot; 2 vols. (2003, 2004); [http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Writings/AAR-Still%20Hazy.pdf Adler, Joseph A., &quot;Confucianism as Religion / Religious Tradition / Neither: Still Hazy After All These Years&quot; (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ahmadiyya view===
[[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], the fourth [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]], in his book ''[[Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth]]'', has argued that Confucianism was a religion and elaborates further in attempting to explain through particular references that the religion in its original pristine form was a monotheistic religion divinely revealed to Confucius who he describes as a [[prophet]] of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_2_section_3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
Several names for Confucianism exist in [[Chinese language|Chinese]].
* &quot;School of the scholars&quot; ({{zh|c=[[wikt:儒|儒]][[wikt:家|家]]|p=Rújiā}})
* &quot;Teaching of the scholars&quot; ({{zh|c=[[wikt:儒|儒]][[wikt:教|教]]|p=Rújiào}})
* &quot;Study of the scholars&quot; ({{zh|t=[[wikt:儒|儒]][[wikt:學|學]]|s=[[wikt:儒|儒]][[wikt:学|学]]|p=Rúxué}})
* &quot;Teaching of Confucius&quot; ({{zh|c=[[wikt:孔|孔]][[wikt:教|教]]|p=Kǒngjiào}})
* &quot;Kong Family's Business&quot; ({{zh|c=[[wikt:孔|孔]][[wikt:家|家]][[wikt:店|店]]|p=Kǒngjiādiàn}})&lt;ref&gt;This phrase of a certain negative context became popular after its usage in many Anti-Confucianism movements in China, most notably the [[May Fourth Movement]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]]. See [http://guoxue.zynews.com/News/2009/11104.html ] and [http://bbs1.people.com.cn/postDetail.do?boardId=14&amp;treeView=1&amp;view=2&amp;id=91865332 ] for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of these use the Chinese character 儒 ''rú,'' meaning &quot;scholar&quot;. These names do not use the name &quot;Confucius&quot; at all, but instead center on the figure or ideal of the Confucian scholar; however, the suffixes of ''jiā, jiào,'' and ''xué'' carry different implications as to the nature of Confucianism itself.

''Rújiā'' contains the character ''jiā,'' which literally means &quot;house&quot; or &quot;family&quot;. In this context, it is more readily construed as meaning &quot;school of thought&quot;, since it is also used to construct the names of philosophical schools contemporary with Confucianism: for example, the Chinese names for [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] and [[Mohism]] end in ''jiā.''

''Rújiào'' and ''Kǒngjiào'' contain the Chinese character jiào, the noun &quot;teach&quot;, used in such as terms as &quot;education&quot;, or &quot;educator&quot;. The term, however, is notably used to construct the names of religions in Chinese: the terms for Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and other religions in Chinese all end with ''jiào.''

''Rúxué'' contains ''xué'' 'study'. The term is parallel to ''-ology'' in English, being used to construct the names of academic fields: the Chinese names of fields such as physics, chemistry, biology, political science, economics, and sociology all end in ''xué.''

==Intro==
'''Chinese philosophy''' is [[philosophy]] written in the [[China|Chinese]] [[Chinese culture|tradition]] of thought. Chinese philosophy has a history of several thousand years; its origins are often traced back to the [[I Ching|Yi Jing]] (the ''Book of Changes''), an ancient compendium of [[divination]], which uses a system of 64 [[hexagrams]] to guide action.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} This system is attributed to [[King Wen of Zhou]] (1099–1050 BCE) and the work reflects the characteristic concepts and approaches of Chinese philosophy. The ''Book of Changes'' evolved in stages over the next eight centuries, but  the first recorded reference is in 672 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;page 60, Great Thinkers of the Eastern World, edited Ian McGreal Harper Collins 1995,  ISBN 0062700855&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' (''Dào dé jīng'', in [[pinyin]] romanisation) of [[Laozi|Lao Tzu]] (''Lǎo zǐ'') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lao Tze (Laozi)|editor=Stephen Hodge (Translator)|title=Tao Te Ching|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|year=2002 | ISBN=0-7641-2168-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Analects]]'' of [[Confucius]] (''Kǒng fū zǐ''; sometimes called ''Master Kong'') &lt;ref name=&quot;Confucius&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Kung Fu Tze (Confucius)|editor=D. C. Lau (Translator)|title=The Analects|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=1998 | ISBN=0-14-044348-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both appeared around the 6th century BCE, slightly ahead of early [[Buddhist philosophy]] in Northern India and slightly after [[pre-Socratic philosophy]] in [[Ancient Greece]].

[[Confucianism]] represents the collected teachings of the Chinese sage [[Confucius]], who lived from 551 to 479 BCE. His philosophy concerns the fields of ethics and politics, emphasizing personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice, traditionalism, and sincerity. The Analects stress the importance of ritual, but also the importance of 'ren', which loosely translates as 'human-heartedness,&lt;ref&gt;Yuli Liu, 'Confucius', in Essentials of Philosophy and Ethics, Hodder Arnold 2006 ISBN 0340900288&lt;/ref&gt; Confucianism, along with [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], is responsible for creating the world’s first [[meritocracy]], which holds that one's status should be determined by ability instead of [[ancestry]], [[wealth]], or [[friendship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Confucius&quot; /&gt; Confucianism was and continues to be a major influence in Chinese culture, the state of [[History of China|China]] and the surrounding areas of [[Southeast Asia]].

Throughout history, Chinese philosophy has been molded to fit the prevailing schools of thought and circumstances in China. The Chinese schools of philosophy, except during the [[To burn the classics and to bury the scholars|Qin Dynasty]], can be both critical and yet relatively tolerant of one another. Even when one particular school of thought is officially adopted by the ruling bureaucracy, as in the [[Han Dynasty]], there may be no move to ban or censor other schools of thought. Despite and because of the debates and competition, they generally have cooperated and shared ideas, which they would usually incorporate with their own. For example, [[Neo-Confucianism]] was a revived version of old Confucian principles that appeared around the [[Song Dynasty]], with Buddhist, Taoist, and Legalist features in the religion.

During the Industrial and Modern Ages, Chinese philosophy had also began to integrate concepts of [[Western philosophy]], as steps toward modernization. By the time of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911, there were many calls, such as the [[May Fourth Movement]], to completely abolish the old imperial institutions and practices of China.  There have been attempts to incorporate [[democracy]], [[republicanism]], and [[industrialism]] into Chinese philosophy, notably by [[Sun Yat-Sen]] (''Sūn yì xiān'', in one Mandarin form of the name) at the beginning of the 20th century. [[Mao Zedong]] blended [[Marxism]] with [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] and other [[Communism|communist]] thought to create what is sometimes known today as &quot;[[Maoism]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;'Maoism', in Essentials of Philosophy and Ethics, Hodder Arnold 2006 ISBN 0340900288&lt;/ref&gt;  The government of the [[People's Republic of China]] encourage [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]]. Although, officially, it does not encourage some of the philosophical practices of [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial China]], the influences of past are still deeply ingrained in the [[Chinese culture]]. As in [[Japan]], philosophy in China has become a melting pot of ideas. It accepts new concepts, while attempting also to accord old beliefs their due.

''Chinese philosophy'' has spread around the world in forms such as the ''[[New Confucianism]]'' and New Age ideas (see for example [[Chinese traditional medicine]]).  Many in the academic community of the West remain skeptical, and only a few assimilate Chinese philosophy into their own research, whether scientific or philosophical. However, it still carries profound influence amongst the people of [[East Asia]], and even [[Southeast Asia]].

== Brief history ==
=== Early beliefs ===
Early [[Shang Dynasty]] thought was based upon cyclicity.  This notion stems from what the people of the [[Shang Dynasty]] could observe around them: day and night cycled, the seasons progressed again and again, and even the moon waxed and waned until it waxed again.  Thus, this notion, which remained relevant throughout [[Chinese history]], reflects the order of nature.  In juxtaposition, it also marks a fundamental distinction from [[western philosophy]], in which the dominant view of time is a linear progression. During the Shang, [[destiny|fate]] could be manipulated by great deities, commonly translated as Gods. [[Ancestor worship]] was present and universally recognized. There was also human and animal sacrifice.

When the Shang were overthrown by the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]], a new political, religious and philosophical concept was introduced called the &quot;[[Mandate of Heaven]]&quot;. This mandate was said to be taken when rulers became unworthy of their position and provided a shrewd justification for Zhou rule. During this period, archaeological evidence points to an increase in literacy and a partial shift away from the faith placed in [[Shangdi]] (the Supreme Being in [[traditional Chinese religion]]), with ancestor worship becoming commonplace and a more worldly orientation coming to the fore.

=== Hundred Schools of Thought ===
{{Main|Hundred Schools of Thought}}
In around 500 BCE, after the Zhou state weakened and China moved in to the [[Spring and Autumn Period]], the classic period of Chinese philosophy began (it is an interesting fact that this date nearly coincides with the emergence of the first [[Greek philosophers]]). This is known as  the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] (諸子百家; ''zhūzǐ bǎijiā''; &quot;various scholars , hundred schools&quot;). This period is considered the golden age of Chinese philosophy. Of the many schools founded at this time and during the subsequent [[Warring States Period]], the four most influential ones were [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism|Daoism]] (often spelled &quot;Taoism&quot;), [[Mohism]] and [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]].

=== Qin and Han Dynasty ===
The short founder [[Qin Dynasty]], where Legalism was the official philosophy, [[To burn the classics and to bury the scholars|quashed Mohist and Confucianist schools]]. Legalism remained influential until the emperors of the [[Han Dynasty]] adopted Daoism and later Confucianism as official doctrine. These latter two became the determining forces of Chinese thought until the introduction of Buddhism.

Confucianism was particularly strong during the Han Dynasty, whose greatest thinker was [[Dong Zhongshu]], who integrated Confucianism with the thoughts of the Zhongshu School and the theory of the Five Elements. He also was a promoter of the New Text school, which considered Confucius as a divine figure and a spiritual ruler of China, who foresaw and started the evolution of the world towards the Universal Peace. In contrast, there was an Old Text school that advocated the use of Confucian works written in ancient language (from this comes the denomination ''Old Text'') that were so much more reliable. In particular, they refuted the assumption of Confucius as a godlike figure and considered him as the greatest sage, but simply a human and mortal

=== Xuanxue and Buddhism ===
The 3rd and 4th centuries saw the rise of the ''[[Xuanxue]]'' (mysterious learning), also called ''Neo-Taoism''. The most important philosophers of this movement were [[Wang Bi]], [[Xiang Xiu]] and [[Guo Xiang]]. The main question of this school was whether Being came before Not-Being (in Chinese, ''ming'' and ''wuming''). A peculiar feature of these Taoist thinkers, like the [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]], was the concept of ''[[feng liu]]'' (lit. wind and flow), a sort of romantic spirit which encouraged following the natural and instinctive impulse.

[[Buddhism]] arrived in China around the 1st century AD, but it was not until the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties|Northern and Southern]], [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] Dynasties that it gained considerable influence and acknowledgement. At the beginning, it was considered a sort of Taoist sect, and there was even a theory about [[Laozi]], founder of Taoism, who went to India and taught his philosophy to [[Buddha]]. [[Mahayana Buddhism]] was far more successful in China than its rival [[Hinayana]], and both Indian schools and local Chinese sects arose from the 5th century. Two chiefly important monk philosophers were [[Sengzhao]] and [[Daosheng]]. But probably the most influential and original of these schools was the [[Chan]] sect, which had an even stronger impact in Japan as the [[Zen]] sect.

In the mid-Tang Buddhism reached its peak, and reportedly there were 4,600 monasteries, 40,000 hermitages and 260,500 monks and nuns. The power of the Buddhist clergy was so great and the wealth of the monasteries so impressive, that it instigated criticism from Confucian scholars, who considered Buddhism as a foreign religion. In [[845]] Emperor [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Wuzong]] ordered the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]], confiscating the riches and returning monks and nuns to lay life. From then on, Buddhism lost much of its influence.

=== From Neo-Confucianism to late Imperial Era ===
[[Neo-Confucianism]] was a revived version of old Confucian principles that appeared around the [[Song Dynasty]], with [[Buddhist]], [[Taoist]], and [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]] features. The first philosophers, such as [[Shao Yong]], [[Zhou Dunyi]] and [[Chang Zai]], were [[cosmologists]] and worked on the [[I Ching|Yi Jing]]. The Cheng brothers, [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] and [[Cheng Hao]], are considered the founders of the two main schools of thought of Neo-Confucianism: the [[School of Principle]] the first, the [[School of Mind]] the latter. The School of Principle gained supremacy during the Song Dynasty with the philosophical system elaborated by [[Zhu Xi]], which became mainstream and officially adopted by the government for the Imperial examinations under the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. [[The School of Mind]] was developed by [[Lu Jiuyuan]], Zhu Xi's main rival, but was soon forgotten. Only during the [[Ming Dynasty]] was the School of Mind revived by [[Wang Shouren]], whose influence is equal to that of Zhu Xi. This school was particularly important in Japan.

During the [[Qing Dynasty]] many philosophers objected against Neo-Confucianism and there was a return to the Han Dynasty Confucianism, and also the reprise of the controversy between Old Text and New Text. In this period also started the penetration of Western culture, but most Chinese thought that the Westerners were maybe more advanced in technology and warfare, but that China had primacy in moral and intellectual fields.

=== Modern era ===
During the Industrial and Modern Ages, Chinese philosophy had also begun to integrate concepts of Western philosophy, as steps toward modernization. By the time of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911, there were many calls, such as the [[May Fourth Movement]], to completely abolish the old imperial institutions and practices of China.  There have been attempts to incorporate [[democracy]], [[republicanism]], and [[industrialism]] into Chinese philosophy, notably by [[Sun Yat-Sen]] (''Sūn yì xiān'', in one Mandarin form of the name) at the beginning of the 20th century. [[Mao Zedong]] (''Máo zé dōng'') added [[Marxism]], [[Stalinism]], and other [[Communism|communist]] thought.

When the [[Communist Party of China]] [[Chinese Civil War|took over]] power, previous schools of thought, excepting notably [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], were denounced as backward, and later even purged during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Their influence on Chinese thought, however, remains. The current government of the [[People's Republic of China]] is trying to encourage a form of [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|market socialism]].

Since the radical movement of the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese government has become much more tolerant with the practice of traditional beliefs. The [[1978 Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] guarantees &quot;freedom of religion&quot; with a number of restrictions. Spiritual and philosophical institutions have been allowed to be established or re-established, as long they are not perceived to be a threat to the power of the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]]. (However, it should be noted that those organizations are heavily monitored by the state.) The influences of the past are still deeply ingrained in the Chinese culture. As in [[Japan]], philosophy in China has become a melting pot of ideas. It accepts new concepts, while attempting also to accord old beliefs their due.

== Main Schools of Thought ==
=== Confucianism ===
[[Image:Confucius Statue at the Confucius Temple.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kong Fuzi ([[Latin Language|Latin]]: [[Confucius]])]]
{{Main|Confucianism}}
Confucianism is a philosophical school developed from the teachings of the sage  collected in the ''[[Analects of Confucius]]''. It is a system of [[morality|moral]], [[social philosophy|social]], [[politics|political]], and [[religion|religious]] thought that has had tremendous influence on Chinese history, thought, and culture down to the 21st century. Some Westerners have considered it to have been the &quot;[[state religion]]&quot; of [[Imperial era of Chinese history|imperial China]]. Its influence also spread to Korea and Japan.

The major Confucian concepts include ''rén'' (humanity or humaneness), ''zhèngmíng'' (rectification of names; e.g. a ruler who rules unjustly is no longer a ruler and may be dethroned), ''zhōng'' (loyalty), ''xiào'' ([[filial piety]]), and ''lǐ'' (ritual). Confucius taught both positive and negative versions of the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]]. The concepts [[Yin and Yang]] represent two opposing forces that are permanently in conflict with each other, leading to perpetual contradiction and change. The Confucian idea of &quot;Rid of the two ends, take the middle&quot; is a Chinese equivalent of [[Hegel]]'s idea of &quot;thesis, antithesis, and synthesis&quot;, which is a way of reconciling opposites, arriving at some middle ground combining the best of both.

==== Neo-Confucianism ====
{{Main|Neo-Confucianism}}
Despite Confucianism losing popularity to Taoism and Buddhism, [[Neo-Confucianism]] combined those ideas into a more [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] framework. Its concepts include ''li'' (principle, akin to [[Plato]]'s [[Theory of forms|forms]]), ''qi'' (vital or material force), ''[[taiji]]'' (the Great Ultimate), and ''xin'' (mind).

==== New Confucianism ====
{{Main|New Confucianism}}
New Confucianism is an [[intellectual]] movement of [[Confucianism]] that began in the early 20th century in Republican [[China]], and revived in post-[[Mao Zedong|Mao]] era [[People's Republic of China|contemporary China]]. It is deeply influenced by, but not identical with, the  [[Neo-Confucianism]] of the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] and [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] dynasties.

=== Taoism ===
[[Image:SFEC BritMus Asia 021.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Chinese [[ceramic glaze|glaze]]d [[stoneware]] statue of a [[Taoist]] deity, from the [[Ming Dynasty]], 16th century.]]
{{Main|Taoism}}
{{See also|Xuanxue}}

Taoism (Daoism) is a philosophy and later also developed into a religion based on the texts the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' (Dào Dé Jīng; ascribed to [[Laozi]]) and the ''[[Zhuangzi]]'' (partly ascribed to [[Zhuangzi]]). The character ''[[Tao]]'' 道 (''Dao'') literally means &quot;path&quot; or &quot;way&quot;. However in Daoism it refers more often to a meta-physical term that describes a force that encompasses the entire universe but which cannot be described nor felt. All major Chinese philosophical schools have investigated the correct ''Way'' to go about a moral life, but in Taoism it takes on the most abstract meanings, leading this school to be named after it. It advocated nonaction (''wu wei''), the strength of softness, spontaneity, and relativism. Although it serves as a rival to Confucianism, a school of active morality, this rivalry is compromised and given perspective by the idiom &quot;practise Confucianism on the outside, Taoism on the inside.&quot;
But its main motto is: &quot;If one must rule, rule young&quot;
Most of Taoism's focus is on what is perceived to be the undeniable fact that human attempts to make the world better, actually make the world worse. Therefore it is better to strive for harmony.

=== Legalism ===
{{Main|Legalism (Chinese philosophy)}}
Legalism is a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] [[political philosophy]] synthesized by [[Shang Yang]] and [[Han Fei]]. With an essential principle like &quot;when the epoch changed, the ways changed&quot;, it upholds the [[rule of law]] and is thus a theory of [[jurisprudence]].

A ruler should govern his subjects by the following trinity:
#Fa (法 fa3): law or principle.
#Shu (術 shù): method, tactic, art, or statecraft.
#Shi (勢 shì): legitimacy, power, or charisma.

Legalism was the chosen philosophy of the [[Qin Dynasty]]. It was blamed for creating a [[totalitarian]] society and thereby experienced decline. Its main motto is: &quot;Set clear strict laws, or deliver harsh punishment&quot;. Both Shang Yang and Han Fei promoted the absolute adherence to the rule of law, regardless of the circumstances or the person. The ruler, alone, would possess the authority to dispense with rewards and punishments. Ministers were only to be rewarded if their words matched the results of their proposals, and punished if it did not; regardless if the results were worse or better than the claims. Legalism, in accordance with Han Fei's interpretation, could encouraged the state to be a [[militarism|militaristic]] [[autarky]]. The philosophy was highly progressive, and extremely critical of the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] and [[Mohism|Mohist]] schools. This would be used to justify [[Li Si]]'s large scale [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|persecution]]s of the other schools of thought during the Qin dynasty, and the invariable denunciation by Confucian scholars from the [[Han dynasty]] and onwards.

=== Buddhism ===
[[Image:Chang Sheng-wen 001.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''The [[Gautama Buddha|Sakyamuni Buddha]]'', by artist Zhang Shengwen, [[1173]]-[[1176]] CE, [[Song Dynasty]].]]
{{Main|Buddhism in China}}
[[Buddhism]] is a [[religion]], a [[practical philosophy]], and arguably a [[psychology]], focusing on the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha]], who lived on the [[Indian subcontinent]] most likely from the mid-6th to the early 5th century BCE. When used in a generic sense, a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] is generally considered to be someone who discovers the true [[Reality in Buddhism|nature of reality]].

Although Buddhism originated in [[Buddhism in India|India]], it has had the most lasting impact on China. Since Chinese traditional thought focuses more on ethics rather than [[metaphysics]], it has developed several schools distinct from the originating Indian schools. The most prominent examples with philosophical merit are [[Sanlun]], [[Tiantai]], [[Huayan school|Huayan]], and [[Chán]] (a.k.a. Zen). They investigate [[higher consciousness|consciousness]], levels of truth, whether reality is ultimately empty, and how [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]] is to be achieved. Buddhism has a spiritual aspect that compliments the action of [[Neo-Confucianism]], with prominent Neo-Confucians advocating certain forms of meditation. the Buddha showed people what was right or wrong. the teaching still lives on today. the brahmans were at the top of the caste system. people still medatate.

=== Mohism ===
{{Main|Mohism}}
Mohism (Moism), founded by [[Mozi]] (墨子), promotes [[universal love]] with the aim of mutual benefit. Everyone must love each other equally and impartially to avoid conflict and war. Mozi was strongly against Confucian ritual, instead emphasizing [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] survival through farming, [[fortification]], and [[Public administration|statecraft]]. Tradition is inconsistent, and human beings need an extra-traditional guide to identify which traditions are acceptable. The moral guide must then promote and encourage social behaviors that maximize general benefit. As motivation for his theory, Mozi brought in the ''[[Will of Heaven]]'', but rather than being religious his philosophy parallels [[utilitarianism]].

=== Logicians ===
{{Main|School of Names}}
The logicians (School of Names) were concerned with logic, paradoxes, names and actuality (similar to Confucian rectification of names). The logician [[Hui Shi]] was a friendly rival to [[Zhuangzi]], arguing against Taoism in a light-hearted and humorous manner. Another logician, [[Gongsun Long]], told the famous [[When a White Horse is Not a Horse]] dialogue. This school did not thrive because the Chinese regarded [[sophistry]] and [[dialectic]] as impractical.

==Tea and philosophy==
Philosophy have been a influence in the development of the [[tea ceremony]]. The elements of the [[Chinese tea ceremony]] is the harmony of nature and self cultivation, and enjoying tea in an formal and informal setting. When tea is more than a drink and the tea ceremony is understood and practiced to foster harmony in humanity, promote harmony with nature, discipline the mind, quiet the heart, and attain the purity of enlightenment, the art of tea becomes [[teaism]].

== Great philosophical figures ==
{{Main|List of Chinese philosophers}}
* [[Confucius]], seen as the Great Master but sometimes ridiculed by Taoists.
** [[Mencius]], Confucius' follower having idealist inspiration
** [[Xun Zi]], another Confucius' follower, closer to realism, teacher of Han Fei and Li Si
** [[Zhu Xi]], founder of [[Neo-Confucianism]]
** [[Wang Yangming]], most influential proponent of ''xinxue'' or &quot;state of mind.&quot;
* [[Lao Zi]], the chief of Taoist school.
** [[Zhuangzi]], said to be the author of the ''Zhuangzi''.
** [[Lie Yukou|Liezi]], said to be the author of the ''[[Liezi]]''.

== Concepts within Chinese philosophy ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
Although the individual philosophical schools differ considerably, they nevertheless share a common vocabulary and set of concerns.

Among the terms commonly found in Chinese philosophy are:
* [[Tao]] (the Way, or one's doctrine)
* [[De (Chinese)|De]] (virtue, power)
* [[Li (Confucian)|Li]] (principle)
* [[Qi]] (vital energy or material force)
* The ''[[Taiji]]'' (''Great Heavenly Axis'') forms a unity of the two complimentary polarities, ''[[Yin and Yang]]''. The word ''Yin'' originally referred to a hillside facing away from the sun. Philosophically, it stands the dark, passive, feminine principle; whereas ''Yang'' (the hillside facing the sun) stands for the bright, active, masculine principle. Yin and Yang are not antagonistic, they alternate in inverse proportion to one another—like the rise and fall of a [[wave]].

Among the commonalities of Chinese philosophies are:
* The tendency not to view man as separate from nature.
* Questions about the nature and existence of a [[Chinese terms for God|monotheistic deity]], which have profoundly influenced Western philosophy, have not been important in Chinese philosophies or a source of great conflict in [[Chinese traditional religion]].
* The belief that the purpose of philosophy is primarily to serve as an ethical and practical guide.
* The political focus: most scholars of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought|Hundred Schools]] were trying to convince the ruler to behave in the way they defended.

'''Confucius''' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:孔|孔]][[wikt:子|子]]|p={{unicode|Kǒng Zǐ}}|w=K'ung-tzu}}, or {{zh|c=孔夫子|p={{unicode|Kǒng Fūzǐ}}|w=K'ung-fu-tzu|links=no}}), literally &quot;''Master Kong''&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;More commonly abbreviated to {{zh|c=孔子|p={{unicode|Kǒngzǐ}}|links=no}}; see [[#Names|Names]] section&lt;/ref&gt; (traditionally 28 September [[551 BC]]&amp;nbsp;– 479 BC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/confucius/ |title=Confucius (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[China|Chinese]] thinker and social [[Eastern philosophy|philosopher]] of the [[Spring and Autumn Period]].

The philosophy of Confucius emphasized personal and [[government]]al [[morality]], correctness of [[social relation]]ships, [[justice]] and [[sincerity]]. These values gained prominence in [[China]] over other doctrines, such as [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] ({{lang|zh|法家}}) or [[Taoism]] ({{lang|zh|道家}}) during the [[Han Dynasty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ban|111|loc=[http://www.guoxue.com/shibu/24shi/hansu/hsu_067.htm vol.56] (Chinese language only)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gao|2003}} {{citation needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chen|2003}}{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (206 BC&amp;nbsp;– AD 220). Confucius' thoughts have been developed into a system of philosophy known as ''[[Confucianism]]'' ({{lang|zh|儒家}}). 

Because no texts survive that are demonstrably authored by Confucius, and the ideas most closely associated with him were elaborated in writings that accumulated over the period between his death and the foundation of the first Chinese empire in 221 BC, many scholars are very cautious about attributing specific assertions to Confucius himself. His teachings may be found in the ''[[Analects of Confucius]]'' ({{lang|zh|論語}}), a collection of [[aphorisms]], which was compiled many years after his death. For nearly 2,000 years he was thought to be the editor or author of all the [[Five Classics]] ({{lang|zh|五經}})&lt;ref name=analects7_1&gt;{{Harvnb|The Analects|479 BC - 221 BC|loc=[http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.html#div-7 VII.1]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kang|1958}}{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as  the ''[[Classic of Rites]]'' ({{lang|zh|禮記}}) (editor), and the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'' ({{lang|zh|春秋}}) (author).

Confucius' principles had a basis in common Chinese tradition and belief. He championed strong familial loyalty, [[ancestor worship]], respect of elders by their children (and, according to later interpreters, of husbands by their wives), and the family as a basis for an ideal government. He expressed the well-known principle, &quot;''Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself''&quot;, one of the earlier versions of the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]].

==Personal life and family==
According to tradition, Confucius was born in 551 B.C., in the [[Spring and Autumn Period]], at the beginning of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] philosophical movement. Confucius was born in or near the city of [[Qufu]] (曲阜), in the Chinese [[Lu (state)|State of Lu]] (魯) (now part of [[Shandong|Shandong Province]]). Early accounts say that he was born into a poor but noble family that had fallen on hard times.&lt;ref name=chien23_24&gt;{{Harvnb|Chien|1978|pgs=23-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucius was from a warrior family. His father Shulianghe ({{lang|zh|叔梁紇}}) had military exploits in two battles and owned a [[fief]]dom. The ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' [http://www.guoxue.com/shibu/24shi/shiji/sjml.htm (史記)], compiled some four centuries later, states that Confucius was born as a result of a ''yehe'' (野合), or &quot;illicit union&quot;.&lt;ref name=sima47&gt;{{Harvnb|Sima|109 B.C.E. - 91 B.C.E.|loc=[http://www.guoxue.com/shibu/24shi/shiji/sj_047.htm vol.47]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father died when Confucius was three years old,&lt;ref name=chien25&gt;{{Harvnb|Chien|1978|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was brought up in poverty by his mother. His social ascendancy linked him to the growing class of ''shì'' (士), a class whose status lay between that of the old [[nobility]] and the common people, that comprised men who sought social positions on the basis of talents and skills, rather than heredity. 
As a child, Confucius was said to have enjoyed putting [[List of Chinese names of bronze vessels|ritual vases]] on the sacrifice table.&lt;ref name=sima47 /&gt; He married a young girl named Qi Guan (亓官) at 19 and she gave birth to their first child, Kong Li, (孔鯉) when he was 20. Confucius is reported to have worked as a shepherd, cowherd, clerk, and a book-keeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Legge|1895|loc=[http://nothingistic.org/library/mencius/mencius20.html  Book 5, V]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother died when Confucius was 23, and he entered three years of mourning. 

Confucius is said to have risen to the position of Justice Minister (大司寇) in Lu at the age of 53.&lt;ref name=table&gt;[http://confucian.tccg.gov.tw/chinese/a7d.htm Temple Of Confucius], 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', the neighboring state of [[Qi (state)|Qi (齊)]] was worried that Lu was becoming too powerful. Qi decided to sabotage Lu's reforms by sending 100 good horses and 80 beautiful dancing girls to the Duke of Lu. The Duke indulged himself in pleasure and did not attend to official duties for three days. Confucius was deeply disappointed and resolved to leave Lu and seek better opportunities, yet to leave at once would expose the misbehavior of the Duke and therefore bring public humiliation to the ruler Confucius was serving, so Confucius waited for the Duke to make a lesser mistake. Soon after, the Duke neglected to send to Confucius a portion of the sacrificial meat that was his due according to custom, and Confucius seized this pretext to leave both his post and the state of Lu.&lt;ref name=sima47 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Analects|479 BC - 221 BC|loc=[http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.html#div-18 XVIII.4]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to tradition, after Confucius's resignation, he began a long journey (or set of journeys) around the small kingdoms of northeast and central China, including the states of [[Wei (Spring and Autumn Period)|Wei (衞)]], [[Song (state)|Song (宋)]], [[Chen (state)|Chen (陳)]] and [[Cai (state)|Cai (蔡)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chien|1978|pp=37–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the courts of these states, he expounded his political beliefs but did not see them implemented.

According to the ''Zuo Commentary to the Spring and Autumn Annals'', Confucius returned home when he was 68.&lt;ref name=table /&gt; The ''Analects'' depict him spending his last years teaching disciples and transmitting the old wisdom via a set of texts called the [[Five Classics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Analects|479 BC - 221 BC|loc=[http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.html#div-9 IX.14]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Burdened by the loss of both his son and his favourite disciples,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Analects|479 BC - 221 BC|loc=[http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.html#div-11 XI.8, 9, 10 and 11]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Classic of Rites|300 BC|loc=[http://www.yasue.cc/tan_gung.html Tangong Part 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt; he died  at the age of 72 or 73.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chien|1978|pp=50–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
[[File:Confuciustombqufu.jpg|thumb|upright|The tomb of Confucius in [[Qufu]].]]

Kong Qiu ({{lang|zh|孔丘}}), as Confucius is commonly known, is a combination of his surname ({{lang|zh|孔}}) and his given name ({{lang|zh|丘}}), and he was also known as Zhong Ni ({{lang|zh|仲尼}}), which is his [[Chinese style name|courtesy name]]. 

The name &quot;Confucius&quot; was first [[Latinization (literature)|Latinised]] and introduced to [[Europe]] by the [[Italians|Italian]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Matteo Ricci]]. Other forms of Romanisations are {{unicode|Kǒng Fūzǐ}} (or {{unicode|Kǒng fū zǐ}}) in [[pinyin]], and ''K'ung fu-tzu'' in [[Wade-Giles]] (or, less accurately, Kung fu-tze).

{{unicode|Fūzǐ}} means teacher. Since it was disrespectful to call the teacher by name according to Chinese culture, he is known as just &quot;Master Kong&quot;, or Confucius, even in modern days. The character 'fu' is optional; in modern Chinese he is more often called ''{{unicode|Kǒng Zi}}'' (孔子).

In 1 C.E. (first year of the [[Yuanshi Era]] of the [[Han Dynasty]]), he was given his first [[posthumous name]]: {{lang|zh|褒成宣尼公}}, Lord Bāochéngxūanni, which means &quot;Laudably Declarable Lord Ni.&quot; His most popular posthumous names are {{lang|zh|至聖先師}}, ''Zhìshèngxiānshī'',  lit. &quot;The Most Sage Venerated Late Teacher&quot; (comes from 1530, the ninth year of the [[Jianing]] period of the [[Ming Dynasty]]); {{lang|zh|至聖}}, ''Zhìshèng'', &quot;the Greatest Sage&quot;; {{lang|zh|先師}}, Xiānshī, literally meaning &quot;first teacher&quot;.  It has been suggested that '{{lang|zh|先師}}' can be used, however, to express something like, &quot;the Teacher who assists the wise to their attainment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zhang|1988|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also commonly known as {{lang|zh|萬世師表}}，''Wànshìshībiǎo'', &quot;Role Model for Teachers through the Ages&quot;.

[[File:Dacheng Hall.JPG|thumb|The Dacheng Hall, the main hall of the [[Temple of Confucius]] in [[Qufu]].]]
Although Confucianism is often followed in a religious manner by the Chinese, arguments continue over whether it is a religion. Confucianism discusses elements of the [[afterlife]] and views concerning Heaven, but it is relatively unconcerned with some spiritual matters often considered essential to religious thought, such as the nature of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].

In the ''[[Analects]]'' ({{lang|zh|論語}}), Confucius presents himself as a &quot;transmitter who invented nothing&quot;.&lt;ref name=analects7_1 /&gt; He puts the greatest emphasis on the importance of ''study'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chien|1978|pp=117–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Analects|479 BC - 221 BC|loc=[http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.html#div-1  I.1]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is the [[Chinese character]] for study (or ''learning'') that opens the text. In this respect, he is seen by Chinese people as the Greatest Master.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gu|1658|loc=vol. 51, sec. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Far from trying to build a systematic theory of [[life]] and [[society]] or establish a [[formalism]] of rites, he wanted his disciples to think deeply for themselves and relentlessly study the outside world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Analects|479 BC - 221 BC|loc=[http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.html#div-3 III.3]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}; [http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.html#div-6 VI.13]{{dead link|date=November 2010}} and [http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.html#div-17 XVII.11]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly through the old [[scriptures]] and by relating the moral problems of the present to past political events (like the ''Annals'') or past expressions of feelings by common people and reflective members of the elite, preserved in the poems of the ''[[Shi Jing|Book of Odes]]'' ({{lang|zh|詩經}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Analects|479 BC - 221 BC|loc=[http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.html#div-13 XIII.5]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}; [http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.html#div-17 XVII.9]{{dead link|date=November 2010}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Analects|479 BC - 221 BC|loc=[http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.html#div-6 VI.25]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===

One of the deepest teachings of Confucius may have been the superiority of personal exemplification over explicit rules of [[behavior]]. His moral teachings emphasized self-cultivation, emulation of moral exemplars, and the attainment of skilled judgment rather than knowledge of rules, Confucius's [[ethics]] may be considered a type of [[virtue ethics]]. His teachings rarely rely on reasoned argument, and ethical ideals and methods are conveyed more indirectly, through [[allusion]]s, [[innuendo]], and even [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]. This is why his teachings need to be examined and put into proper context in order to be understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Derrida|1983|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Du|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good example is found in this famous anecdote:

::{{lang|zh|廄焚。子退朝，曰：“傷人乎？” 不問馬。}}
::''When the stables were burnt down, on returning from court, Confucius said, 'Was anyone hurt?' He did not ask about the horses.''
:::::::''Analects'' X.11 ([[Arthur Waley]] translation) or 10-13 ([[James Legge]] translation)

The passage conveys the lesson that by not asking about the horses, Confucius demonstrated that a sage values human beings over property; readers of this lesson are led to reflect on whether their response would follow Confucius's, and to pursue ethical self-improvement if it would not. Confucius, an exemplar of human excellence, serves as the ultimate model, rather than a deity or a universally true set of abstract principles. For these reasons, according to many Eastern and Western commentators, Confucius's teaching may be considered a Chinese example of [[humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1995|pp=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his most famous teaching was the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]] (in the positive form) and [[Silver Rule]] (in the negative form):

::{{lang|zh|己所不欲，勿施於人。}}
::''&quot;What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others.&quot;''

::{{lang|zh|子貢問曰：“有一言而可以終身行之者乎”？子曰：“其恕乎！己所不欲、勿施於人。”}}
::''Zi gong (a disciple of Confucius) asked: &quot;Is there any one word that could guide a person throughout life?&quot; &lt;br /&gt;The Master replied: &quot;How about 'shu' [reciprocity]: never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself?&quot;''
:::::::''Analects'' XV.24, tr. David Hinton

====Lǐ, yì and rén====

The Confucian theory of ethics as exemplified in ''[[Li (Confucian)|Lǐ]]'' ({{lang|zh|禮}}) is based on three important conceptual aspects of life: ceremonies associated with sacrifice to ancestors and deities of various types, social and political institutions, and the etiquette of daily behavior. It was believed by some that ''lǐ'' originated from the heavens, but Confucius stressed the development of ''lǐ'' through the actions of sage leaders in human history. His discussions of ''lǐ'' seem to redefine the term to refer to all actions committed by a person to build the ideal society, rather than those simply conforming with canonical standards of ceremony.

In the early Confucian tradition, ''lǐ'' was doing the proper thing at the proper time, balancing between maintaining existing norms to perpetuate an ethical social fabric, and violating them in order to accomplish ethical good. Training in the ''lǐ'' of past sages cultivates in people virtues that include ethical judgment about when ''lǐ'' must be adapted in light of situational contexts.

In early Confucianism, the concept of ''li'' is closely related to ''yì'' ({{lang|zh|義}}), which is based upon the idea of [[reciprocity]]. ''Yì'' can be translated as [[righteousness]], though it may simply mean what is ethically best to do in a certain context. The term contrasts with action done out of [[self-interest]]. While pursuing one's own [[self-interest]] is not necessarily bad, one would be a better, more righteous person if one's life was based upon following a path designed to enhance the greater good. Thus an outcome of ''yì'' is doing the right thing for the right reason. 

Just as action according to ''[[Li (Confucian)|Lǐ]]'' should be adapted to conform to the aspiration of adhering to ''yì'', so ''yì'' is linked to the core value of ''rén'' ({{lang|zh|仁}}). ''Rén'' is the virtue of perfectly fulfilling one's responsibilities toward others, most often translated as &quot;benevolence&quot; or &quot;humaneness&quot;; translator [[Arthur Waley]] calls it &quot;Goodness&quot; (with a capital ''G''), and other translations that have been put forth include &quot;authoritativeness&quot; and &quot;selflessness.&quot; Confucius's moral system was based upon [[empathy]] and understanding others, rather than divinely ordained rules. To develop one's spontaneous responses of ''rén'' so that these could guide action intuitively was even better than living by the rules of ''yì''.

To cultivate one's attentiveness to ''rén'' one used another Confucian version of the [[Golden Rule]]: &quot;What one does not wish for oneself, one ought not to do to anyone else; what one recognises as desirable for oneself, one ought to be willing to grant to others.&quot; (''Confucius and Confucianism'', Richard Wilhelm) [[Virtue]], in this Confucian view, is based upon harmony with other people, produced through this type of ethical practice by a growing identification of the interests of self and other.

===Politics===

Confucius' political thought is based upon his ethical thought. He argues that the best government is one that rules through &quot;rites&quot; (''lǐ'') and people's [[natural morality]], rather than by using bribery and coercion. He explained that this is one of the most important analects: &quot;If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame. If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of the shame, and moreover will become good.&quot; (Translated by [[James Legge]]) in the [[Great Learning]] ({{lang|zh|大學}}). This &quot;sense of shame&quot; is an internalisation of [[duty]], where the punishment precedes the evil action, instead of following it in the form of laws as in [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]].

Confucius looked nostalgically upon earlier days, and urged the Chinese, particularly those with political power, to model themselves on earlier examples. In times of division, chaos, and endless wars between feudal states, he wanted to restore the [[Mandate of Heaven]] ({{lang|zh|天命}}) that could unify the &quot;world&quot; ({{lang|zh|天下}}, &quot;all under Heaven&quot;) and bestow peace and prosperity on the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Analects|479 BC - 221 BC|loc=[http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.html#div-16 XVI.2]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because his vision of personal and social perfections was framed as a revival of the ordered society of earlier times, Confucius is often considered a great proponent of [[conservatism]], but a closer look at what he proposes often shows that he used (and perhaps twisted) past institutions and rites to push a new political agenda of his own: a revival of a unified royal state, whose rulers would succeed to power on the basis of their moral merits instead of lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Analects|479 BC - 221 BC|loc=[http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.html#div-14 XIV.9]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zhang|2002|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; These would be rulers devoted to their people, striving for personal and social [[perfection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Analects|479 BC - 221 BC|loc= [http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.html#div-6 VI.24 and 30]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}; [http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.html#div-14 XIV.16 and 17]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such a ruler would spread his own virtues to the people instead of imposing proper behavior with laws and rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Analects|479 BC - 221 BC|loc=[http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.html#div-2 II.20]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}; [http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.html#div-12 XII.19]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he supported the idea of government by an all-powerful sage, ruling as an [[Emperor]], his ideas contained a number of elements to limit the power of rulers. He argued for according language with [[truth]], and [[honesty]] was of paramount importance. Even in [[facial expression]], truth must always be represented. In discussing the relationship between a king and his subject (or a father and his son), he underlined the need to give due respect to superiors. This demanded that the inferior must give advice to his superior if the superior was considered to be taking the wrong course of action.

==Disciples and legacy==
{{see also|Disciples of Confucius}}

Confucius's teachings were later turned into an elaborate set of rules and practices by his numerous disciples and followers who organized his teachings into the Analects.Confucius' disciples and his only grandson, [[Zisi]], continued his philosophical school after his death. These efforts spread Confucian ideals to students who then became officials in many of the royal courts in China, thereby giving Confucianism the first wide-scale test of its [[dogma]].

Two of Confucius's most famous later followers emphasized radically different aspects of his teachings. In the centuries after his death, [[Mencius]] ({{lang|zh|孟子}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Legge|1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Xun Zi]] ({{lang|zh|荀子}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Xun|325 BC - 238 BC}}&lt;/ref&gt; both composed important teachings elaborating in different ways on the fundamental ideas associated with Confucius. [[Mencius]] (4th century BC) articulated the innate goodness in human beings as a source of the ethical intuitions that guide people towards ''rén'', ''yì'', and ''lǐ'', while [[Xun Zi]] (3rd century BC) underscored the realistic and materialistic aspects of Confucian thought, stressing that morality was inculcated in society through tradition and in individuals through training. In time, their writings, together with the ''Analects'' and other core texts came to constitute the philosophical corpus of Confucianism. 

This realignment in Confucian thought was parallel to the development of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], which saw filial piety as self-interest and not a useful tool for a ruler to create an effective state.  A disagreement between these two political philosophies came to a head in 223 BC when the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] conquered all of China.  [[Li Ssu]], Prime Minister of the [[Qin Dynasty]] convinced [[Qin Shi Huang]] to abandon the Confucians' recommendation of awarding fiefs akin to the [[Zhou Dynasty]] before them which he saw as counter to the Legalist idea of centralizing the state around the ruler.  When the Confucian advisers pressed their point, Li Ssu had many Confucian scholars killed and their books burned—considered a huge blow to the philosophy and Chinese scholarship.

Under the succeeding [[Han Dynasty]] and [[Tang Dynasty]], Confucian ideas gained even more widespread prominence.  Under [[Wudi]], the works of Confucius were made the official imperial philosophy and required reading for civil service examinations in 140 BC which was continued nearly unbroken until the end of the 19th Century. As [[Moism]] lost support by the time of the Han,  the main philosophical contenders were Legalism, which Confucian thought somewhat absorbed, the teachings of [[Lao-tzu]], whose focus on more mystic ideas kept it from direct conflict with Confucianism, and the new [[Buddhist]] religion, which gained acceptance during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] era. Both Confucian ideas and Confucian-trained officials were relied upon in the [[Ming Dynasty]] and even the [[Yuan Dynasty]], although Kublai Khan distrusted handing over provincial control. 

During the [[Song Dynasty]], the scholar [[Zhu Xi]] (AD 1130-1200) added ideas from [[Daoism]] and [[Buddhism]] into Confucianism. In his life, Zhu Xi was largely ignored, but not long after his death his ideas became the new orthodox view of what Confucian texts actually meant. Modern historians view Zhu Xi as having created something rather different, and call his way of thinking ''[[Neo-Confucianism]]''. Neo-Confucianism held sway in China, Korea, and [[Vietnam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Li|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the 19th century.

[[File:LifeAndWorksOfConfucius1687.jpg|thumb|&quot;Life and works of Confucius&quot;, by Prospero Intorcetta, 1687.]]

The works of Confucius were translated into European languages through the agency of [[Jesuit]] scholars stationed in China.&lt;ref&gt;The first was [[Michele Ruggieri]] who had returned from China to Italy in 1588, and carried on translating in Latin Chinese classics, while residing in Salerno&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matteo Ricci]] started to report on the thoughts of Confucius, and father [[Prospero Intorcetta]] published the life and works of Confucius into [[Latin]] in 1687.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Windows into China&quot;, John Parker, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that such works had considerable importance on European thinkers of the period, particularly among the [[Deists]] and other philosophical groups of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of Confucius into [[western world|Western civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Windows into China&quot;, John Parker, p.25, ISBN 0890730504&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Eastern origins of Western civilization&quot;, John Hobson, p194-195, ISBN 0521547245&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era Confucian movements, such as [[New Confucianism]], still exist but during the [[Cultural Revolution]], Confucianism was frequently attacked by leading figures in the [[Communist Party of China]]. This was partially a continuation of the condemnations of Confucianism by intellectuals and activists in the early 20th Century as a cause of the ethnocentric close-mindedness and refusal of the [[Qing Dynasty]] to modernize that led to the tragedies that befell China in the 19th Century.

Confucius's works are studied by scholars in many other Asian countries, particularly those in the [[Sinosphere]], such as Korea, Japan and Vietnam. Many of those countries still hold the traditional memorial ceremony every year. 

The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] believes Confucius was a [[Prophets of Islam|Divine Prophet]] of God, as was [[Lao-Tzu]] and other eminent Chinese personages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_2_section_3.html |title=Revelation Rationality Knowledge and Truth |publisher=Alislam.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, [[7853 Confucius|Asteroid 7853]], &quot;Confucius&quot;, was named after the Chinese thinker.

==Visual portraits==
No contemporary painting or sculpture of Confucius survives, and it was only during the [[Han Dynasty]] that he was portrayed visually. Carvings often depict his legendary meeting with [[Laozi]]. Since that time there have been many portraits of Confucius as the ideal philosopher.

In former times, it was customary to have a portrait in [[Temple of Confucius|Confucius Temple]]s; however, during the reign of [[Hongwu Emperor]] (Taizu) of the [[Ming dynasty]] it was decided that the only proper portrait of Confucius should be in the [[Temple of Confucius, Qufu|temple]] in his hometown, [[Qufu]]. In other temples Confucius is represented by a memorial tablet. In 2006, the China Confucius Foundation commissioned a standard portrait of Confucius based on the [[Tang dynasty]] portrait by [[Wu Daozi]].

==Memorials of Confucius==

Soon after Confucius' death, [[Qufu]], his hometown became a place of devotion and remembrance. It is still a major destination for cultural tourism, and many people visit his grave and the surrounding temples. In pan-China cultures, there are many temples where representations of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Laozi]] and Confucius are found together. There are also many [[Temple of Confucius|temples]] dedicated to him, which have been used for Confucianist ceremonies.

The Chinese have a tradition of holding spectacular memorial ceremonies of Confucius ({{lang|zh|祭孔}}) every year, using ceremonies that supposedly derived from Zhou Li ({{lang|zh|周禮}}) as recorded by Confucius, on the date of Confucius' birth. This tradition was interrupted for several decades in mainland China, where the official stance of the Communist Party and the State was that Confucius and Confucianism represented reactionary [[Feudalism|feudalist]] beliefs which held that the subservience of the people to the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] is a part of the natural order. All such ceremonies and rites were therefore banned. Only after the 1990s, did the ceremony resume. As it is now considered a veneration of Chinese history and tradition, even Communist Party members may be found in attendance.

In Taiwan, where the Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]]) strongly promoted Confucian beliefs in ethics and behavior, the tradition of the memorial ceremony of Confucius (祭孔) is supported by the government and has continued without interruption. While not a national holiday, it does appear on all printed calendars, much as [[Father's Day]] does in the West.

==Descendants==
{{See also|Family tree of Confucius in the main line of descent}}
Confucius' descendants were repeatedly identified and honored by successive imperial governments with titles of nobility and official posts. They were honored with the rank of a [[marquess|marquis]] thirty-five times since [[Gaozu of Han|Gaozu]] of the [[Han Dynasty]], and they were promoted to the rank of [[duke]] forty-two times from the [[Tang Dynasty]] to the [[Qing Dynasty]]. [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] first bestowed the title of &quot;Duke Wenxuan&quot; on Kong Suizhi of the 35th generation. In 1055, [[Emperor Renzong of Song]] first bestowed the title of &quot;[[Duke Yansheng]]&quot; on Kong Zongyuan of the 46th generation.

Despite repeated dynastic change in China, the title of Duke Yansheng was bestowed upon successive generations of descendants until it was abolished by the [[Nationalist Government]] in 1935. The last holder of the title, [[Kung Te-cheng]] of the 77th generation, was appointed [[Sacrificial Official to Confucius]]. Kung Te-cheng was offered the position of puppet [[Emperor of China]] in 1937 by the Japanese, but Kung declined the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=OXlCAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=confucius+sought+by+japanese+as+puppet+emperor+of+china+in+1937+but+refused&amp;dq=confucius+sought+by+japanese+as+puppet+emperor+of+china+in+1937+but+refused|title=China fights for her life, Volume 2|author=Herbert Roslyn Ekins, Theon Wright|year=1938|publisher=Whittlesey house|location=|page=315|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Te-cheng died in October 2008, and his son, Kung Wei-yi, the 78th lineal descendant, had died in 1989. Kung Te-cheng's grandson, [[Kung Tsui-chang]], the 79th lineal descendant, was born in 1975; his great-grandson, Kung Yu-jen, the 80th lineal descendant, was born in Taipei on January 1, 2006.  Te-cheng's sister, Kong Demao, lives in mainland China and has written a book about her experiences growing up at the family estate in Qufu. Another sister, Kong Deqi, died as a young woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Demao&quot;&gt;Kong Demao, ''The House of Confucius'' (London:  Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucius's family, the Kongs, has the longest recorded extant pedigree in the world today. The father-to-son family tree, now in its 83rd generation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ce.cn/National/culture/200901/04/t20090104_17866318.shtml |title=Confucius family tree revision ends with 2 mln descendants |publisher=En.ce.cn |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been recorded since the death of Confucius. According to the Confucius Genealogy Compilation Committee, he has 2 million known and registered descendants, and there are an estimated 3 million in all.&lt;ref name=content&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-02/16/content_7616027.htm |title=Updated Confucius family tree has two million members |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2008-02-16 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, several tens of thousands live outside of China.&lt;ref name=content/&gt; In the 14th century, a Kong descendant went to Korea, where an estimated 34,000 descendants of Confucius live today.&lt;ref name=content/&gt; One of the main lineages fled from the Kong ancestral home in [[Qufu]] during the [[Chinese Civil War]] in the 1940s, and eventually settled in Taiwan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Demao&quot;/&gt;

Because of the huge interest in the Confucius family tree, there was a project in China to test the DNA of known family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ye2.mofcom.gov.cn/aarticle/chinanews/200606/20060602462372.html |title=DNA test to clear up Confucius confusion |publisher=Ye2.mofcom.gov.cn |date=2006-06-18 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, this would allow scientists to identify a common Y chromosome in male descendants of Confucius. If the descent were truly unbroken, father-to-son, since Confucius's lifetime, the males in the family would all have the same Y chromosome as their direct male ancestor, with slight mutations due to the passage of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/culture/171840.htm |title=DNA Testing Adopted to Identify Confucius Descendants |publisher=China.org.cn |date=2006-06-19 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2009, the family authorities decided not to agree to DNA testing.&lt;ref name=seedmagazine&gt;{{cite web|author=Jane Qiu |url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/inheriting_confucius/ |title=Inheriting Confucius |publisher=Seedmagazine.com |date=2008-08-13 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bryan Sykes, professor of genetics at Oxford University, understands this decision: &quot;The Confucius family tree has an enormous cultural significance,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not just a scientific question.&quot;&lt;ref name=seedmagazine/&gt;  The DNA testing was originally proposed to add new members, many of whose family record books were lost during 20th-century upheavals, to the Confucian family tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.bandao.cn/newsdetail.asp?id=4644 |title=Confucius descendents say DNA testing plan lacks wisdom |publisher=Eng.bandao.cn |date=2007-08-21 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth and most recent edition of the Confucius genealogy was printed by the [[Confucius Genealogy Compilation Committee]] (CGCC). It was unveiled in a ceremony at Qufu on September 24, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-09/24/content_8733256.htm |title=Confucius' Family Tree Recorded biggest |publisher=Chinadaily.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=New Confucius Genealogy out next year |url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/features/content_16696029.htm |quote=With a history of over 2,500 years covering more than 80 generations, and the longest family tree in the world according to the Guinness Book of Records, the fifth edition of the Confucius Genealogy will be printed in several volumes in 2009, according to an organizer of the [[Confucius Genealogy Compilation Committee]] (CGCC). |work=[[China Internet Information Center]] |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women are now included for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-02/02/content_800011.htm |title=Confucius family tree to record female kin |publisher=Chinadaily.com.cn |date=2007-02-02 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that this only deals with those whose lines of descent are documented historically.  Using mathematical models, it is easy to demonstrate that people living today have a much more common ancestry than commonly assumed, so it is likely that many more have Confucius as an ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stat.yale.edu/%7Ejtc5/papers/CommonAncestors/NatureCommonAncestors-Article.pdf www.stat.yale.edu]  Common Ancestors Article&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Complex number illustration.svg|thumb|right|A complex number can be visually represented as a pair of numbers forming a vector on a diagram called an Argand diagram, representing the [[complex plane]]. ''Re'' is the real axis, ''Im'' is the imaginary axis, and ''i'' is the square root of –1.]]

A '''complex number''' is a [[number]] consisting of a ''[[real number|real]]'' part and an ''[[imaginary number|imaginary]]'' part. Complex numbers extend the idea of the one-dimensional [[number line]] to the two-dimensional [[complex plane]] by using the number line for the real part and adding a vertical axis to plot the imaginary part. In this way the complex numbers [[subfield|contain]] the ordinary real numbers while extending them in order to solve problems that would be impossible with only real numbers.

Complex numbers are [[#Applications|used]] in many scientific fields, including [[engineering]], [[electromagnetism]], [[quantum physics]], [[applied mathematics]], and [[chaos theory]]. Italian mathematician [[Gerolamo Cardano]] is the first known to have conceived complex numbers; he called them &quot;fictitious&quot;, during his attempts to find solutions to [[cubic equations]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Burton|1995|p=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction and definition==
Complex numbers have been introduced to allow for solutions of certain equations that have no real solution: the equation
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 1 = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
has no real solution ''x'', since the square of ''x'' is 0 or positive, so ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''1'' cannot be zero. Complex numbers are a solution to this problem. The idea is to enhance the real numbers by adding a number ''i'' whose square is &amp;minus;1, so that ''x'' = ''i'' and ''x'' = -''i'' are the two solutions to the preceding equation.

===Definition===
A ''complex number'' is an expression of the form
:&lt;math&gt;a+bi, \ &lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'' and ''b'' are [[real number]]s and ''i'' is a [[mathematical symbol]] which is called the ''[[imaginary unit]]''. For example, -3.5 + 2''i'' is a complex number.

The real number ''a'' of the complex number ''z'' = ''a'' + ''bi'' is called the ''[[real part]]'' of ''z'' and the real number ''b'' is the ''[[imaginary part]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=College Algebra and Trigonometry |edition=6 |first1=Richard N. |last1=Aufmann |first2=Vernon C. |last2=Barker |first3=Richard D. |last3=Nation |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2007 |isbn=0618825150 |page=66 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=g5j-cT-vg_wC}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=g5j-cT-vg_wC&amp;pg=PA66 Chapter P, p. 66]&lt;/ref&gt; They are denoted Re(''z'') or ℜ(''z'') and Im(''z'') or ℑ(''z''), respectively. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}(-3.5 + 2i) = -3.5 \ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Im}(-3.5 + 2i) = 2  \ &lt;/math&gt;
Some authors write ''a''+''ib'' instead of ''a''+''bi''. In some disciplines (in particular, [[electrical engineering]], where ''i'' is a symbol for [[Electric current|current]]), the [[imaginary unit]] ''i'' is instead written as ''j'',  so complex numbers are written as ''a'' + ''bj'' or ''a'' + ''jb''.

A real number ''a'' can usually be regarded as a complex number with an imaginary part of zero, that is to say, ''a'' + 0''i''. However the sets are defined differently and have slightly different operations defined, for instance comparison operations are not defined for complex numbers. Complex numbers whose real part is zero, that is to say, those of the form 0 + ''bi'', are called ''imaginary numbers''. It is common to write ''a'' for ''a'' + 0''i'' and ''bi'' for {{nowrap|0 + ''bi''}}. Moreover, when ''b'' is negative, it is common to write ''a'' &amp;minus; (&amp;minus;''b)i'' instead of ''a'' + ''bi'', for example 3 &amp;minus; 4''i'' instead of 3 + (&amp;minus;4)''i''.

The [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all complex numbers is denoted by '''C''' or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

===The complex plane===
{{Main|Complex plane}}
[[Image:Complex number illustration.png|thumb|right|Figure 1: A complex number plotted as a point (red) and position vector (blue) on an [[Argand diagram]]; &lt;math&gt;a+bi&lt;/math&gt; is the ''rectangular'' expression of the point.]]
A complex number can be viewed as a point or [[Vector (geometric)|position vector]] in a two-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]] called the [[complex plane]] or Argand diagram (see {{harvnb|Pedoe|1988}} and {{harvnb|Solomentsev|2001}}), named after [[Jean-Robert Argand]]. The numbers are conventionally plotted using the real part as the horizontal component, and imaginary part as vertical (see Figure 1). These two values used to identify a given complex number are therefore called its ''Cartesian'', ''rectangular'', or ''algebraic form''.

The defining characteristic of a position vector is that it has magnitude and direction. These are emphasised in a complex number's ''[[#Polar form | polar form]]'' and it turns out notably that the operations of addition and multiplication take on a very natural geometric character when complex numbers are viewed as position vectors: addition corresponds to vector addition while multiplication corresponds to multiplying their magnitudes and adding their arguments (i.e. the angles they make with the ''x'' axis). Viewed in this way the multiplication of a complex number by ''i'' corresponds to rotating a complex number anticlockwise through 90° about the origin.

===History in brief===

:''Main section: [[Complex number#History|History]]''

The solution of a general cubic equation in radicals (without trigonometric functions) may require intermediate calculations containing the square roots of negative numbers, even when the final solutions are real numbers, a situation known as [[casus irreducibilis]]. This conundrum led Italian mathematician [[Gerolamo Cardano]] to conceive of complex numbers in around 1545, though his understanding was rudimentary.

Work on the problem of general polynomials ultimately led to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], which shows that with complex numbers, a solution exists to every [[polynomial]] equation of degree one or higher. Complex numbers thus form an [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]] [[field (mathematics)|field]], where any [[polynomial]] equation has a [[Root of a function|root]].

Many mathematicians contributed to the full development of complex numbers. The rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers were developed by the Italian mathematician [[Rafael Bombelli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Katz|2004|loc=§9.1.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more abstract formalism for the complex numbers was further developed by the Irish mathematician [[William Rowan Hamilton]], who extended this abstraction to the theory of [[quaternions]].

==Elementary operations==
===Conjugation===
[[File:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|Geometric representation of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and its conjugate &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt; in the complex plane]]
The ''[[complex conjugate]]'' of the complex number {{nowrap begin}}''z'' = ''x'' + ''yi''{{nowrap end}} is defined to be ''x'' &amp;minus; ''yi''. It is denoted &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z^*\,&lt;/math&gt;. Geometrically, &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt; is the &quot;reflection&quot; of ''z'' about the real axis. In particular, conjugating twice gives the original complex number: &lt;math&gt;\bar{\bar{z}}=z&lt;/math&gt;.

The real and imaginary parts of a complex number can be extracted using the conjugate:
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}\,(z) = \tfrac{1}{2}(z+\bar{z}), \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Im}\,(z) = \tfrac{1}{2i}(z-\bar{z}). \,&lt;/math&gt;
Moreover, a complex number is real if and only if it equals its conjugate.

Conjugation distributes over the standard arithmetic operations:
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{z+w} = \bar{z} + \bar{w}, \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{z w} = \bar{z} \bar{w}, \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\overline{(z/w)} = \bar{z}/\bar{w} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of a nonzero complex number {{nowrap begin}}''z'' = ''x'' + ''yi''{{nowrap end}} is given by
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{z}=\frac{\bar{z}}{z \bar{z}}=\frac{\bar{z}}{x^2+y^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
This formula can be used to compute the multiplicative inverse of a complex number if it is given in rectangular coordinates. [[Inversive geometry]], a branch of geometry studying more general reflections than ones about a line, can also be expressed in terms of complex numbers.

===Addition and subtraction===
[[Image:Vector Addition.svg|200px|right|thumb|Addition of two complex numbers can be done geometrically by constructing a parallelogram.]]
Complex numbers are [[addition|added]] by adding the real and imaginary parts of the summands. That is to say:
:&lt;math&gt;(a+bi) + (c+di) = (a+c) + (b+d)i. \ &lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, [[subtraction]] is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;(a+bi) - (c+di) = (a-c) + (b-d)i.\ &lt;/math&gt;
Using the visualization of complex numbers in the complex plane, the addition has the following geometric interpretation: the sum of two complex numbers ''A'' and ''B'', interpreted as points of the complex plane, is the point ''X'' obtained by building a [[parallelogram]] three of whose vertices are 0, ''A'' and ''B''. Equivalently, ''X'' is the point such that the [[triangle]]s with vertices 0, ''A'', ''B'', and ''X'', ''B'', ''A'', are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]].

===Multiplication and division===
The multiplication of two complex numbers is defined by the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;(a+bi) (c+di) = (ac-bd) + (bc+ad)i.\ &lt;/math&gt;
In particular, the square of the imaginary unit is &amp;minus;1:
:&lt;math&gt;i^2 = ii = -1.\ &lt;/math&gt;

The preceding definition of multiplication of general complex numbers is the natural way of extending this fundamental property of the imaginary unit. Indeed, treating ''i'' as a variable, the formula follows from this
:&lt;math&gt;(a+bi) (c+di) = ac + bci + adi + bidi \ &lt;/math&gt; ([[distributive law]])
:::&lt;math&gt; = ac + bidi + bci + adi \ &lt;/math&gt; ([[commutative law]] of addition&amp;mdash;the order of the summands can be changed)
:::&lt;math&gt; = ac + bdi^2 + (bc+ad)i \ &lt;/math&gt; (commutative law of multiplication&amp;mdash;the order of the factors can be changed)
:::&lt;math&gt; = (ac-bd) + (bc + ad)i \ &lt;/math&gt; (fundamental property of the imaginary unit).

The division of two complex numbers is defined in terms of complex multiplication, which is described above, and real division:
:&lt;math&gt;\,\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \left({ac + bd \over c^2 + d^2}\right) + \left( {bc - ad \over c^2 + d^2} \right)i. &lt;/math&gt;
Division can be defined in this way because of the following observation:
:&lt;math&gt;\,\frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \frac{\left(a + bi\right) \cdot \left(c - di\right)}{\left (c + di\right) \cdot \left (c - di\right)} = \left({ac + bd \over c^2 + d^2}\right) + \left( {bc - ad \over c^2 + d^2} \right)i. &lt;/math&gt;
As shown earlier, &lt;math&gt;c-di&lt;/math&gt; is the complex conjugate of the denominator &lt;math&gt;c+di&lt;/math&gt;. The real part ''c'' and the imaginary part ''d'' of the [[denominator]] must not both be zero for division to be defined.

===Square root===

The [[Square root#Formula|square roots of ''a'' + ''bi'']] (with ''b'' ≠ 0) are &lt;math&gt; \pm (\gamma + \delta i)&lt;/math&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \sqrt{\frac{a + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \sgn (b) \sqrt{\frac{-a + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}},&lt;/math&gt;

where sgn is the [[sign function|signum]] function. This can be seen by squaring &lt;math&gt; \pm (\gamma + \delta i)&lt;/math&gt; to obtain ''a'' + ''bi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Here &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[absolute value|modulus]] of ''a + bi'', and the square root with non-negative real part is called the '''principal square root'''.

==Polar form== &lt;!-- [[Nth root]] links to this section --&gt;
{{Main|Polar coordinate system}}
[[Image:Complex_number_illustration_modarg.svg|right|thumb|Figure 2: The argument ''φ'' and modulus ''r'' locate a point on an Argand diagram; &lt;math&gt;r(\cos \phi + i \sin \phi)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;r e^{i\phi}&lt;/math&gt; are ''polar'' expressions of the point.]]

===Absolute value and argument===
Another way of encoding points in the complex plane other than using the ''x''- and ''y''-coordinates is to use the distance of a point ''P'' to ''O'', the point whose coordinates are (0, 0) ([[origin (mathematics)|origin]]), and the angle of the line through ''P'' and ''O''. This idea leads to the polar form of complex numbers.

The ''[[absolute value]]'' (or ''modulus'' or ''magnitude'') of a complex number ''z'' = ''x''+''yi'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle r=|z|=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}.\,&lt;/math&gt;
If ''z'' is a real number (i.e., ''y'' = 0), then ''r'' = |''x''|. In general, by [[Pythagoras' theorem]], ''r'' is the distance of the point ''P'' representing the complex number ''z'' to the origin.

The ''[[arg (mathematics)|argument]]'' or ''phase'' of ''z'' is the angle to the real axis, and is written as &lt;math&gt;\arg(z)&lt;/math&gt;. As with the modulus, the argument can be found from the rectangular form &lt;math&gt;x+iy&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The value of ''φ'' must always be expressed in [[radian]]s. It can change by any multiple of 2''π'' and still give the same angle. Hence, the arg function is sometimes considered as [[Multivalued function|multivalued]]. Normally, as given above, the [[principal value]] in the interval &lt;math&gt;(-\pi,\pi]&lt;/math&gt; is chosen. Values in the range &lt;math&gt;[0,2\pi)&lt;/math&gt; are obtained by adding &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; if the value is negative. The polar angle for the complex number 0 is undefined, but arbitrary choice of the angle&amp;nbsp;0 is common.

The value of ''φ'' equals the result of [[atan2]]: &lt;math&gt;\varphi = \mbox{atan2}(\mbox{imaginary}, \mbox{real})&lt;/math&gt;.

Together, ''r'' and ''φ'' give another way of representing complex numbers, the ''polar form'', as the combination of modulus and argument fully specify the position of a point on the plane. Recovering the original rectangular co-ordinates from the polar form is done by the formula called ''trigonometric form''
:&lt;math&gt; z = r(\cos \varphi + i\sin \varphi ).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Using [[Euler's formula]] this can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;z = r e^{i \varphi}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[Cis (mathematics)|cis]] function, this is sometimes abbreviated to
:&lt;math&gt; z = r \ \operatorname{cis} \ \varphi. \,&lt;/math&gt;

In [[angle notation]], often used in [[electronics]] to represent a [[Phasor (sine waves)|phasor]] with amplitude ''r'' and phase ''φ'' it is written as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Multiplication, division and exponentiation in polar form===
[[File:ComplexMultiplication.png|right|thumb|Multiplication of 2+''i'' (blue triangle) and 3+''i'' (red triangle). The red triangle is rotated to match the vertex of the blue one and stretched by √{{overline|5}}, the length of the [[hypotenuse]] of the blue triangle.]]
The relevance of representing complex numbers in polar form stems from the fact that the formulas for multiplication, division and exponentiation are simpler than the ones using Cartesian coordinates. Given two complex numbers {{nowrap begin}}''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(cos φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''i''sin φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;){{nowrap end}} and {{nowrap begin}}''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; =''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(cos φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''i''sin φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;){{nowrap end}} the formula for multiplication is
:&lt;math&gt;z_1 z_2 = r_1 r_2 (\cos(\varphi_1 + \varphi_2) + i \sin(\varphi_1 + \varphi_2)).&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, the absolute values are multiplied and the arguments are added to yield the polar form of the product. For example, multiplying by ''i'' corresponds to a quarter-rotation counter-clockwise, which gives back ''i''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1. The picture at the right illustrates the multiplication of
:&lt;math&gt;(2+i)(3+i)=5+5i \,&lt;/math&gt;
Since the real and imaginary part of 5+5''i'' are equal, the argument of that number is 45 degrees, or π/4 (in [[radian]]). On the other hand, it is also the sum of the angles at the origin of the red and blue triangle are [[arctan]](1/3) and arctan(1/2), respectively. Thus, the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = \arctan\frac{1}{2} + \arctan\frac{1}{3} &lt;/math&gt;
holds. As the [[arctan]] function can be approximated highly efficiently, formulas like this&amp;mdash;known as [[Machin-like formulas]]&amp;mdash;are used for high-precision approximations of π.

Similarly, division is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{z_1}{ z_2} = \frac{r_1}{ r_2} \left(\cos(\varphi_1 - \varphi_2) + i \sin(\varphi_1 - \varphi_2)\right).&lt;/math&gt;
This also implies [[de Moivre's formula]] for exponentiation of complex numbers with integer exponents:
:&lt;math&gt; z^n = r^n\,(\cos n\varphi + i \sin n \varphi).&lt;/math&gt;
The ''n''-th [[Nth root|roots]] of ''z'' are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{z}  = \sqrt[n]r \left( \cos \left(\frac{\varphi+2k\pi}{n}\right) + i \sin \left(\frac{\varphi+2k\pi}{n}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
for any integer {{nowrap|''k'' satisfying 0 &amp;le; ''k'' &amp;le; n &amp;minus; 1}}. Here &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the usual (positive) ''n''th root of the positive real number ''r''. While the ''n''th root of a positive real number ''r'' is chosen to be the ''positive'' real number ''c'' satisfying ''c''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'' there is no natural way of distinguishing one particular complex ''n''th root of a complex number. Therefore, the ''n''th root of ''z'' is considered as a [[multivalued function]] (in ''z''), as opposed to a usual function ''f'', for which ''f''(''z'') is a uniquely defined number. Formulas such as
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{z^n} = z&lt;/math&gt;
(which holds for positive real numbers), do in general not hold for complex numbers.

==Properties==
===Field structure===
The set '''C''' of complex numbers is a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. Briefly, this means that the following facts hold: first, any two complex numbers can be added and multiplied to yield another complex number. Second, for any complex number ''a'', its negative &amp;minus;''a'' is also a complex number; and third, every nonzero complex number has a [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] complex number. Moreover, these operations satisfy a number of laws, for example the law of [[commutativity]] of addition and multiplication for any two complex numbers ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;z_1+ z_2 = z_2 + z_1, \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_1 z_2 = z_2 z_1. \,&lt;/math&gt;
These two laws and the other requirements on a field can be proven by the formulas given above, using the fact that the real numbers themselves form a field.

Unlike the reals, '''C''' is not an [[ordered field]], that is to say, it is not possible to define a relation ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that is compatible with the addition and multiplication. In fact, in any ordered field, the square of any element is necessarily positive, so ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;minus;1 precludes the existence of an [[total order|ordering]] on '''C'''.

When the underlying field for a mathematical topic or construct is the field of complex numbers, the thing's name is usually modified to reflect that fact. For example: [[complex analysis]], complex [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], complex [[polynomial]], and complex [[Lie algebra]].

===Solutions of polynomial equations===
Given any complex numbers (called [[coefficient]]s) ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the equation
:&lt;math&gt;a_n z^n + \dots + a_1 z + a_0 = 0, \,&lt;/math&gt;
has at least one complex solution ''z'', provided that at least one of the higher coefficients, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, is nonzero. This is the statement of the ''[[fundamental theorem of algebra]]''. Because of this fact, '''C''' is called an [[algebraically closed field]]. This property does not hold for the [[rational numbers|field of rational numbers]] '''Q''' (the polynomial ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 2 does not have a rational root, since √{{overline|2}} is not a rational number) nor the [[real number]]s '''R''' (the polynomial ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a'' does not have a real solution for ''a'' &gt; 0, since the square of ''x'' is positive for any real number ''x'').

There are various proofs of this theorem, either by analytic methods such as [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville's theorem]], or [[topology|topological]] ones such as the [[winding number]], or a proof combining [[Galois theory]] and the fact that any real polynomial of ''odd'' degree has at least one root.

Because of this fact, theorems that hold &quot;''for any algebraically closed field''&quot;, apply to '''C'''. For example, any complex [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] has at least one (complex) [[eigenvalue]].

===Algebraic characterization===
The field '''C''' has the following three properties: first, it has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0. This means that 1 + 1 + ... + 1 &amp;ne; 0 for any number of summands (all of which equal one). Second, its [[transcendence degree]] over '''Q''', the [[prime field]] of '''C''' is the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. Third, it is [[algebraically closed]] (see above). It can be shown that any field having these properties is [[isomorphic]] (as a field) to '''C'''. For example, the algebraic closure of '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; also satisfies these three properties, so these two fields are isomorphic. Also, '''C''' is isomorphic to the field of complex [[Puiseux series]]. However, specifying an isomorphism requires the [[axiom of choice]]. Another consequence of this algebraic characterization is that '''C''' contains many proper subfields which are isomorphic to '''C''' (the same is true of '''R''', which contains many sub fields isomorphic to itself{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}).

===Characterization as a topological field===
The preceding characterization of '''C''' describes the algebraic aspects of '''C''', only. That is to say, the properties of [[neighborhood (topology)|nearness]] and [[continuity (topology)|continuity]], which matter in areas such as [[analysis]] and [[topology]], are not dealt with. The following description of '''C''' as a [[topological ring|topological field]] (that is, a field that is equipped with a [[topological space|topology]], which allows to specify notions such as convergence) does take into account the topological properties. '''C''' contains a subset ''P'' (namely the set of positive real numbers) of nonzero elements satisfying the following three conditions:
* ''P'' is closed under addition, multiplication and taking inverses.
* If ''x'' and ''y'' are distinct elements of ''P'', then either ''x''&amp;minus;''y'' or ''y''&amp;minus;''x'' is in ''P''.
* If ''S'' is any nonempty subset of ''P'', then ''S'' + ''P'' = ''x'' + ''P'' for some ''x'' in '''C'''.
Moreover, '''C''' has a nontrivial [[involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[automorphism]] &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x^*&lt;/math&gt; (namely the complex conjugation), fixing ''P'' and such that ''xx''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; is in '''P''' for any nonzero ''x'' in '''C'''.

Any field ''F'' with these properties can be endowed with a topology by taking the sets {{nowrap begin}}''B''(''x'', ''p'') = {''y'' | ''P'' &amp;minus; (''y'' &amp;minus; ''x'')(''y'' &amp;minus;''x'') &amp;isin; ''P''}{{nowrap end}} as a [[base (topology)|base]], where ''x'' ranges over the field and ''p'' ranges over ''P''. With this topology ''F'' is isomorphic as a ''topological'' field to '''C'''.

The only [[connected space|connected]] [[locally compact]] [[topological ring|topological fields]] are '''R''' and '''C'''. This gives another characterization of '''C''' as a topological field, since '''C''' can be distinguished from '''R''' because the nonzero complex numbers are [[connected space|connected]], while the nonzero real numbers are not.

==Formal construction==
===Formal development===

Above, complex numbers have been defined by introducing ''i'', the imaginary unit, as a symbol. More rigorously, the set '''C''' of complex numbers can be defined as the set '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of [[ordered pairs]] (''a'', ''b'') of real numbers. In this notation, the above formulas for addition and multiplication read

: &lt;math&gt;(a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d)\,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; (a, b) \cdot (c, d) = (ac - bd, bc + ad)\,&lt;/math&gt;

It is then just a matter of notation to express (a, b) as a + ib.

Though this low-level construction does accurately describe the structure of the complex numbers, the following equivalent definition reveals the algebraic nature of C more immediately. This characterization relies on the notion of fields and polynomials. A field is a set endowed with an addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations which behave as is familiar from, say, rational numbers. For example, the [[distributive law]]
:&lt;math&gt;(x+y) z = xz + yz \ &lt;/math&gt;
is required to hold for any three elements ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' of a field. The set '''R''' of real numbers does form a field. A polynomial p(''X'') with real [[coefficient]]s is an expression of the form
:&lt;math&gt;a_nX^n+...+a_1X+a_0,\ &lt;/math&gt;
where the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are real numbers. The usual addition and multiplication of polynomials endows the set '''R'''[''X''] of all such polynomials with a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] structure. This ring is called [[polynomial ring]]. The [[quotient ring]] '''R'''[''X'']/(''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1) can be shown to be a field.
This extension field contains two square roots of &amp;minus;1, namely (the [[coset]]s of) ''X'' and &amp;minus;''X'', respectively. (The cosets of) 1 and ''X'' form a basis of '''R'''[''X'']/(''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1) as a real [[vector space]], which means that each element of the extension field can be uniquely written as a [[linear combination]] in these two elements. Equivalently, elements of the extension field can be written as ordered pairs (''a'',''b'') of real numbers. Moreover, the above formulas for addition etc. correspond to the ones yielded by this [[abstract algebra]]ic approach&amp;mdash;the two definitions of the field '''C''' are said to be [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] (as fields). Together with the above-mentioned fact that '''C''' is algebraically closed, this also shows that '''C''' is an [[algebraic closure]] of '''R'''.

===Matrix representation of complex numbers===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cauchy-Riemann equations]] --&gt;
Complex numbers can also be represented by 2×2 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] that have the following form:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
  a &amp;   -b  \\
  b &amp; \;\; a
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Here the entries ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers. The sum and product of two such matrices is again of this form, and the sum and product of complex numbers corresponds to the sum and [[matrix multiplication|product]] of such matrices. The geometric description of the multiplication of complex numbers can also be phrased in terms of [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]] by using this correspondence between complex numbers and such matrices. Moreover, the square of the absolute value of a complex number expressed as a matrix is equal to the [[determinant]] of that matrix:
:&lt;math&gt; |z|^2 =
\begin{vmatrix}
  a &amp; -b  \\
  b &amp;  a
\end{vmatrix}
= (a^2) - ((-b)(b)) = a^2 + b^2.
&lt;/math&gt;
The conjugate &lt;math&gt;\overline z&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the [[transpose]] of the matrix.

Though this representation of complex numbers with matricies is the most common, many other representations arise from matrices ''other than'' &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; -1 \\1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; that square to the negative of the [[identity matrix]]. See the article on [[2 × 2 real matrices]] for other representations of complex numbers.

==Complex analysis==
[[Image:Sin1perz.png|thumb|270px|[[Color wheel graphs of complex functions|Color wheel graph]] of sin(1/''z''). Black parts inside refer to numbers having large absolute values.]]
{{main|Complex analysis}}
&lt;!--
[[Image:Color complex plot.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Domain coloring]] plot of the function
&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \tfrac{(x^2 - 1)(x - 2 - i)^2}{x^2 + 2 + 2 i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;
The hue represents the function argument, while the saturation and [[Lightness (color)|value]] represent the magnitude.]]

The absolute value has three important properties:

:&lt;math&gt; | z | \geq 0, \,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; | z | = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt; [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt; z = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; | z + w | \leq | z | + | w | \,&lt;/math&gt; ([[triangle inequality]])

:&lt;math&gt; | z \cdot w | = | z | \cdot | w | \,&lt;/math&gt;

for all complex numbers ''z'' and ''w''.   These imply that |1|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and |''z''/''w''|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|''z''|/|''w''|.  By defining the '''distance''' function ''d''(''z'',&amp;nbsp;''w'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|''z''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''w''|, we turn the set of complex numbers into a [[metric space]] and we can therefore talk about [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and [[continuous function|continuity]].

In general, distances between complex numbers are given by the distance function &lt;math&gt;d(z,w)=|z-w|&lt;/math&gt;, which turns the complex numbers into a [[metric space]] and introduces the ideas of  [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and [[continuous function|continuity]]. All of the standard properties of two dimensional space therefore hold for the complex numbers, including important properties of the modulus such as non-negativity, and the [[triangle inequality]] (&lt;math&gt;| z + w | \leq | z | + | w |&lt;/math&gt; for all ''z'', ''w'').

--&gt;

The study of functions of a complex variable is known as  [[complex analysis]] and has  enormous practical use in  [[applied mathematics]] as well as in other branches of mathematics. Often, the most natural proofs for statements in [[real analysis]] or even [[number theory]] employ techniques from complex analysis (see [[prime number theorem]] for an example). Unlike real functions which are commonly represented as two-dimensional graphs, [[complex function]]s have four-dimensional graphs and may usefully be illustrated by color coding a [[three-dimensional graph]] to suggest four dimensions, or by animating the complex function's dynamic transformation of the complex plane.

===Complex exponential and related functions===
The notions of [[convergent series]] and [[continuous function]]s in (real) analysis have natural analogs in complex analysis. A sequence &lt;!--(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n'' &amp;ge; 0&lt;/sub&gt;--&gt; of complex numbers is said to [[convergent sequence|converge]] if and only if its real and imaginary parts do. This is equivalent to the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]]s, where the absolute value of real numbers is replaced by the one of complex numbers. From a more abstract point of view, '''C''', endowed with the [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{d}(z_1, z_2) = |z_1 - z_2| \,&lt;/math&gt;
is a [[metric space]], which notably includes the [[triangle inequality]]
:&lt;math&gt;|z_1 + z_2| \le |z_1| + |z_2|&lt;/math&gt;
for any two complex numbers ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Like in real analysis, this notion of convergence is used to construct a number of [[elementary functions]]: the ''[[exponential function]]'' exp(''z''), also written ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''z''&lt;/sup&gt;, is defined as the [[infinite series]]
:&lt;math&gt;\exp(z):= 1+z+\frac{z^2}{2\cdot 1}+\frac{z^3}{3\cdot 2\cdot 1}+\cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^n}{n!}. \,&lt;/math&gt;
and the series defining the real trigonmetric functions [[sine]] and [[cosine]], as well as [[hyperbolic functions]] such as [[sinh]] also carry over to complex arguments without change. ''[[Euler's identity]]'' states:
:&lt;math&gt;\exp(i\varphi) = \cos(\varphi) + i\sin(\varphi) \,&lt;/math&gt;
for any real number ''&amp;phi;'', in particular
:&lt;math&gt;\exp(i \pi) = -1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
Unlike in the situation of real numbers, there is an [[infinite set|infinitude]] of complex solutions ''z'' of the equation
:&lt;math&gt;\exp(z) = w \,&lt;/math&gt;
for any complex number {{nowrap|''w'' &amp;ne; 0}}. It can be shown that any such solution ''z''&amp;mdash;called [[complex logarithm]] of ''a''&amp;mdash;satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\log(x+iy)=\ln|w| + i\arg(w), \,&lt;/math&gt;
where arg is the [[arg (mathematics)|argument]] defined [[#Polar form|above]], and ln the (real) [[natural logarithm]]. As arg is a [[multivalued function]], unique only up to a multiple of 2''π'', log is also multivalued. The [[principal value]] of log is often taken by restricting the imaginary part to the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] (&amp;minus;π,π].

Complex [[exponentiation]] ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''ω''&lt;/sup&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;z^\omega = \exp(\omega \log z). \, &lt;/math&gt;
Consequently, they are in general multi-valued. For ''ω'' = 1 / ''n'', for some natural number ''n'', this recovers the non-unicity of ''n''-th roots mentioned above.

===Holomorphic functions===
A function ''f''&amp;thinsp;: '''C''' → '''C''' is called [[holomorphic]] if it satisfies the [[Cauchy-Riemann equations]]. For example, any [[Linear transformation#Definition and first consequences|'''R'''-linear]] map '''C''' → '''C''' can be written in the form
:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=az+b\overline{z}&lt;/math&gt;
with complex coefficients ''a'' and ''b''. This map is holomorphic [[if and only if]] ''b'' = 0. The second summand &lt;math&gt;b \overline z&lt;/math&gt; is real-differentiable, but does not satisfy the [[Cauchy-Riemann equations]].

Complex analysis shows some features not apparent in real analysis. For example, any two holomorphic functions ''f'' and ''g'' that agree on an arbitrarily small [[open subset]] of '''C''' necessarily agree everywhere. [[Meromorphic function]]s, functions that can locally be written as ''f''(''z'')/(''z'' &amp;minus; ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with a holomorphic function ''f''(''z''), still share some of the features of holomorphic functions. Other functions have [[essential singularity|essential singularities]], such as sin(1/''z'') at ''z'' = 0.

==Applications==
Some applications of complex numbers are:

===Control theory===
In [[control theory]], systems are often transformed from the [[time domain]] to the [[frequency domain]] using the [[Laplace transform]].  The system's [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] and [[zero (complex analysis)|zeros]] are then analyzed in the ''complex plane''.  The [[root locus]], [[Nyquist plot]], and [[Nichols plot]] techniques all make use of the complex plane.

In the root locus method, it is especially important whether the [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] and [[zero (complex analysis)|zeros]] are in the left or right half planes, i.e. have real part greater than or less than zero.  If a system has poles that are
*in the right half plane, it will be [[unstable]],
*all in the left half plane, it will be [[BIBO stability|stable]],
*on the imaginary axis, it will have [[marginal stability]].
If a system has zeros in the right half plane, it is a [[nonminimum phase]] system.

===Signal analysis===
Complex numbers are used in [[signal analysis]] and other fields for a convenient description for periodically varying signals. For given real functions representing actual physical quantities, often in terms of sines and cosines, corresponding complex functions are considered of which the real parts are the original quantities. For a [[sine wave]] of a given [[frequency]], the absolute value |''z''| of the corresponding ''z'' is the [[amplitude]] and the argument arg(''z'') the [[phase (waves)|phase]].

If [[Fourier analysis]] is employed to write a given real-valued signal as a sum of periodic functions, these periodic functions are often written as complex valued functions of the form
:&lt;math&gt; f ( t ) = z e^{i\omega t} \,&lt;/math&gt;
where ω represents the [[angular frequency]] and the complex number ''z'' encodes the phase and amplitude as explained above.

In [[electrical engineering]], the [[Fourier transform]] is used to analyze varying [[voltage]]s and [[Electric current|currents]]. The treatment of [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, and [[inductor]]s can then be unified by introducing imaginary, frequency-dependent resistances for the latter two and combining all three in a single complex number called the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]. (Electrical engineers and some physicists use the letter ''j'' for the imaginary unit since ''i'' is typically reserved for varying currents and may come into conflict with ''i''.) This approach is called [[Phasor (sine waves)|phasor calculus]]. This use is also extended into [[digital signal processing]] and [[digital image processing]], which utilize digital versions of Fourier analysis (and [[wavelet]] analysis) to transmit, [[Data compression|compress]], restore, and otherwise process [[digital]] [[Sound|audio]] signals, still images, and [[video]] signals.

===Improper integrals===
In applied fields, complex numbers are often used to compute certain real-valued [[improper integral]]s, by means of complex-valued functions. Several methods exist to do this; see [[methods of contour integration]].

===Quantum mechanics===
The complex number field is relevant in the [[mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics]], where complex [[Hilbert space]]s provide the context for one such formulation that is convenient and perhaps most standard. The original foundation formulas of quantum mechanics – the [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]] [[Schrödinger equation|equation]] and  [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]] – make use of complex numbers.

===Relativity===
In [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], some formulas for the metric on [[spacetime]] become simpler if one takes the time variable to be imaginary. (This is no longer standard in classical relativity, but is [[Wick rotation|used in an essential way]] in [[quantum field theory]].) Complex numbers are essential to [[spinor]]s, which are a generalization of the [[tensor]]s used in relativity.

===Dynamic equations===
In [[differential equations]], it is common to first find all complex roots ''r'' of the [[Linear differential equation#Homogeneous equations with constant coefficients|characteristic equation]] of a [[linear differential equation]] or equation system and then attempt to solve the system in terms of base functions of the form ''f''(''t'') = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''rt''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Likewise, in [[difference equations]], the complex roots ''r'' of the characteristic equation of the difference equation system are used, to attempt to solve the system in terms of base functions of the form ''f''(''t'') = ''r'' &lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Fluid dynamics===
In [[fluid dynamics]], complex functions are used to describe [[potential flow in two dimensions]].

===Fractals===
Certain [[fractal]]s are plotted in the complex plane, e.g. the [[Mandelbrot set]] and [[Julia set]]s.

===Algebraic number theory===
[[File:Pentagon construct.gif|right|thumb|Construction of a regular polygon [[compass and straightedge constructions|using straightedge and compass]].]]
As mentioned above, any nonconstant polynomial equation (in complex coefficients) has a solution in '''C'''. A fortiori, the same is true if the equation has rational coefficients. The roots of such equations are called [[algebraic numbers]]&amp;ndash;they are a principal object of study in [[algebraic number theory]]. Compared to {{overline|'''Q'''}}, the algebraic closure of '''Q''', which also contains all algebraic numbers, '''C''' has the advantage of being easily understandable in geometric terms. In this way, algebraic methods can be used to study geometric questions and vice versa. With algebraic methods, more specifically applying the machinery of [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]] to the [[number field]] containing [[root of unity|roots of unity]], it can be shown that it is not possible to construct a regular 9-gon [[compass and straightedge constructions|using only compass and straightedge]]&amp;ndash;a purely geometric problem.

Another example are Pythagorean triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c''), that is to say integers satisfying
:&lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
(which implies that the triangle having sidelengths ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' is a [[right triangle]]). They can be studied by considering [[Gaussian integer]]s, that is, numbers of the form ''x'' + ''iy'', where ''x'' and ''y'' are integers.

===Analytic number theory===
[[Analytic number theory]] studies numbers, often integers or rationals, by taking advantage of the fact that they can be regarded as complex numbers, in which analytic methods can be used. This is done by encoding number-theoretic information in complex-valued functions. For example, the [[Riemann zeta-function]] ζ(''s'') is related to the distribution of [[prime number]]s.

==History==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[History of complex numbers]] --&gt;
The earliest fleeting reference to [[square root]]s of [[negative numbers]] can perhaps be said to occur in the work of the [[Hellenistic mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron of Alexandria]] in the 1st century [[AD]], where in his ''[[Hero of Alexandria#Bibliography | Stereometrica]]'' he considers, apparently in error, the volume of an impossible [[frustum]] of a [[pyramid]] to arrive at the term &lt;math&gt;\sqrt(81 - 144)&lt;/math&gt; in his calculations, although negative quantities were not conceived of in [[Greek Mathematics |Hellenistic mathematics]] and Heron merely replaced it by its positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= An Imaginary Tale: The Story of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt {-1}&lt;/math&gt;|last= Nahin|first= Paul J.|year= 2007|publisher= [[Princeton University Press]]|isbn= 9780691127989|url= http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?forumID=149&amp;threadID=383188&amp;messageID=1181284|accessdate= 20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impetus to study complex numbers proper first arose in the 16th century when [[algebraic solution |algebraic solutions]] for the roots of [[Cubic equation|cubic]] and [[Quartic equation|quartic]] [[polynomial]]s were discovered by Italian mathematicians (see [[Niccolo Fontana Tartaglia]], [[Gerolamo Cardano]]). It was soon realized that these formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers. As an example, Tartaglia's cubic formula gives the solution to the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\left((\sqrt{-1})^{1/3}+\frac{1}{(\sqrt{-1})^{1/3}}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

and when the three [[cube roots]] of -1

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{-1} = \begin{cases} \  -1 \\ \ \ \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\sqrt3i \\ \ \ \frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\sqrt3i \end{cases},&lt;/math&gt;

of which two are complex, are substituted into this expression the three real roots, 0, 1 and −1, result. Of course this particular equation can be solved at sight but it does illustrate that when general formulas are used to solve cubic equations with real roots then, as later mathematicians showed rigorously, the use of complex numbers [[casus irreducibilis | is unavoidable]]. [[Rafael Bombelli]] was the first to explicitly address these seemingly paradoxical solutions of cubic equations and developed the rules for complex arithmetic trying to resolve these issues.

The term &quot;imaginary&quot; for these quantities was coined by [[René Descartes]] in 1637, although he was at pains to stress their imaginary nature &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= La Géométrie | The Geometry of Rene Descartes with a facsimile of the first edition|last= Descartes|first= René|authorlink= René Descartes|year= 1954|origyear= 1637|publisher= [[Dover Publications]]|isbn= 0486600688|page= |pages= |url= http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26400|accessdate= 20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|[...] quelquefois seulement imaginaires c’est-à-dire que l’on peut toujours en imaginer autant que j'ai dit en chaque équation, mais qu’il n’y a quelquefois aucune quantité qui corresponde à celle qu’on imagine.}} A further source of confusion was that the equation &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}^2=\sqrt{-1}\sqrt{-1}=-1&lt;/math&gt; seemed to be capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a}\sqrt{b}=\sqrt{ab}&lt;/math&gt;, which is valid for positive real numbers ''a'' and ''b'', and which was also used in complex number calculations with one of ''a'', ''b'' positive and the other negative. The incorrect use of this identity (and the related identity &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 1/\sqrt{a}=\sqrt{1/a}&lt;/math&gt;) in the case when both ''a'' and ''b'' are negative even bedeviled [[Euler]]. This difficulty eventually led to the convention of using the special symbol ''i'' in place of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to guard against this mistake {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. Even so Euler considered it natural to introduce students to complex numbers much earlier than we do today.  In his elementary algebra text book, ''[http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/C.J.Sangwin/euler/ Elements of Algebra]'', he introduces these numbers almost at once and then uses them in a natural way throughout.

In the 18th century complex numbers gained wider use, as it was noticed that formal manipulation of complex expressions could be used to simplify calculations involving trigonometric functions. For instance, in 1730 [[Abraham de Moivre]] noted that the complicated identities relating trigonometric functions of an integer multiple of an angle to powers of trigonometric functions of that angle could be simply re-expressed by the following well-known formula which bears his name, [[de Moivre's formula]]:

:&lt;math&gt;(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta)^{n} = \cos n \theta + i\sin n \theta. \,&lt;/math&gt;

In 1748 [[Leonhard Euler]] went further and obtained [[Euler's formula]] of [[complex analysis]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta + i\sin \theta = e ^{i\theta } \,&lt;/math&gt;

by formally manipulating complex [[power series]] and observed that this formula could be used to reduce any trigonometric identity to much simpler exponential identities.

The idea of a complex number as a point in the complex plane ([[#The complex plane|above]]) was first described by [[Caspar Wessel]] in 1799, although it had been anticipated as early as 1685 in [[John Wallis|Wallis's]] ''De Algebra tractatus''.

Wessel's memoir appeared in the Proceedings of the [[Copenhagen Academy]] but went largely unnoticed. In 1806 [[Jean-Robert Argand]] independently issued a pamphlet on complex numbers and provided a rigorous proof of the [[Fundamental theorem of algebra #History | fundamental theorem of algebra]]. Gauss had earlier published an essentially [[topology | topological]] proof of the theorem in 1797 but expressed his doubts at the time about &quot;the true metaphysics of the square root of -1&quot;. It was not until 1831 that he overcame these doubts and published his treatise on complex numbers as points in the plane, largely establishing modern notation and terminology. The English mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] remarked that Gauss was the first mathematician to use complex numbers in 'a really confident and scientific way' although mathematicians such as [[Niels Henrik Abel]] and  [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]] were necessarily using them routinely before Gauss published his 1831 treatise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers|last1= Hardy|first1= G. H.||last2= Wright|first2= E. M.|year= 2000|origyear= 1938|publisher= [[Oxford University Press | OUP Oxford]]|isbn= 0199219869|page= 189 (fourth edition)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]] together brought the fundamental ideas of [[#Complex analysis | complex analysis]] to a high state of completion, commencing around 1825 in Cauchy's case.

The common terms used in the theory are chiefly due to the founders. Argand called &lt;math&gt;\cos \phi + i\sin \phi&lt;/math&gt; the ''direction factor'', and &lt;math&gt;r = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}&lt;/math&gt; the ''modulus''; Cauchy (1828) called &lt;math&gt;\cos \phi + i\sin \phi&lt;/math&gt; the ''reduced form'' (l'expression réduite) and apparently introduced the term ''argument''; Gauss used ''i'' for &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, introduced the term ''complex number'' for ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bi'', and called ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; the ''norm''. The expression ''direction coefficient'', often used for &lt;math&gt;\cos \phi + i\sin \phi&lt;/math&gt;, is due to Hankel (1867), and ''absolute value,'' for ''modulus,'' is due to Weierstrass.

Later classical writers on the general theory include [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Otto Hölder]], [[Felix Klein]], [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Hermann Schwarz]], [[Karl Weierstrass]] and many others.

==Generalizations and related notions==
The process of extending the field '''R''' of reals to '''C''' is known as [[Cayley-Dickson construction]]. It can be carried further to higher dimensions, yielding the [[quaternion]]s '''H''' and [[octonion]]s '''O''' which (as a real vector space) are of dimension&amp;nbsp;4 and 8, respectively. However, with increasing dimension, the algebraic properties familiar from real and complex numbers vanish: the [[quaternions]] are only a [[skew field]], i.e. ''x·y''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''y·x'' for two quaternions, the multiplication of [[octonions]] fails (in addition to not being commutative) to be associative: (''x·y'')·''z''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;''x''·(''y·z''). However, all of these are [[normed division algebra]]s over '''R'''. By [[Hurwitz's theorem (normed division algebras)|Hurwitz's theorem]] they are the only ones. The next step in the Cayley-Dickson construction, the [[sedenion]]s fail to have this structure.

The Cayley-Dickson construction is closely related to the [[regular representation]] of '''C''', thought of as an '''R'''-[[Algebra (ring theory)|algebra]] (an '''R'''-vector space with a multiplication), with respect to the basis 1, ''i''. This means the following: the '''R'''-linear map
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}, z \mapsto wz&lt;/math&gt;
for some fixed complex number ''w'' can be represented by a 2&amp;times;2 matrix (once a basis has been chosen). With respect to the basis 1, ''i'', this matrix is
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
  \operatorname{Re}(w) &amp;   -\operatorname{Im}(w)  \\
  \operatorname{Im}(w) &amp; \;\; \operatorname{Re}(w)
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
i.e., the one mentioned in the section on matrix representation of complex numbers above. While this is a [[linear representation]] of '''C''' in the [[2 × 2 real matrices]], it is not the only one. Any matrix
:&lt;math&gt;J = \begin{pmatrix}p &amp; q \\ r &amp; -p \end{pmatrix}, \quad p^2 + qr + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
has the property that its square is the negative of the identity matrix: ''J''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = -''I''. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\{ z = a I + b J : a,b \in R \}&lt;/math&gt;
is also isomorphic to the field '''C''', and gives an alternative complex structure on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This is generalized by the notion of a [[linear complex structure]].

[[Hypercomplex number]]s also generalize '''R''', '''C''', '''H''', and '''O'''. For example this notion contains the [[split-complex number]]s, which are elements of the ring '''R'''[''x'']/(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 1) (as opposed to '''R'''[''x'']/(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1)). In this ring, the equation ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 has four solutions.

The field '''R''' is the completion of '''Q''', the field of [[rational number]]s, with respect to the usual [[absolute value]] [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]. Other choices of [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]s on '''Q''' lead to the fields '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]] (for any [[prime number]] ''p''), which are thereby analogous to '''R'''. There are no other nontrivial ways of completing '''Q''' than '''R''' and '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, by [[Ostrowski's theorem]]. The algebraic closure &lt;math&gt;\overline {\mathbf{Q}_p}&lt;/math&gt; of '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; still carry a norm, but (unlike '''C''') are not complete with respect to it. The completion &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}_p&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\overline {\mathbf{Q}_p}&lt;/math&gt; turns out to be algebraically closed. This field is called ''p''-adic complex numbers by analogy.

The fields '''R''' and '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and their finite field extensions, including '''C''', are [[local field]]s.

'''Cryptozoology''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:κρυπτός|κρυπτός]], ''kryptos'', &quot;hidden&quot; + [[zoology]]; literally, &quot;study of hidden animals&quot;) refers to the search for [[animal]]s whose existence has not been proven. This includes looking for living examples of animals that are considered extinct, such as [[Living dinosaur (cryptozoology)|dinosaurs]]; animals whose existence lacks physical evidence but which appear in [[myths]], legends, or are reported, such as [[Bigfoot]] and [[Chupacabra]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Simpson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simpson|first=George G.|year=1984|title=Mammals and Crytozoology|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|publisher=American Philosophical Society.|pages=1–19|volume=128|issue=1|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/986487|accessdate=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wild animals dramatically outside their normal geographic ranges, such as [[phantom cat]]s or &quot;ABCs&quot; (an [[initialism]] commonly used by cryptozoologists that stands for [[introduced species|Alien]] Big Cats).

The animals cryptozoologists study are often referred to as ''[[cryptids]]'', a term coined by John Wall in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coleman_1999&quot;&gt;[[Loren Coleman|Coleman, Loren]] and Clark, Jerome.''Cryptozoology A to Z: The Encyclopedia of [[Loch]] [[Monsters]], Sasquatch, Chupacabras, and Other Authentic Mysteries of Nature''. New York: Fireside/Simon and Schuster, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryptozoology is not a recognized branch of [[zoology]] or a discipline of science.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simpson&quot;/&gt; It is an example of [[pseudoscience]] because it relies heavily upon anecdotal evidence, stories and alleged sightings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skepdic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/crypto.html|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary|last=Carroll|first=Robert T.|date=1994-2009|accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;skeptic-encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shermer|first1=Michael |last2=Linse|first2=Pat |title=The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Gr4snwg7iaEC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=The+Skeptic+Encyclopedia+of+Pseudoscience+cryptozoology&amp;q|year=2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1576076539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Dr Karl P. N. Shuker and Smilodon Skull.jpg|thumb|Dr. [[Karl Shuker]] is a prominent British zoologist who studies [[cryptids]].]]
The coining of the word ''cryptozoology'' is often attributed to [[zoologist]] [[Bernard Heuvelmans]], though Heuvelmans attributes coinage of the term to the late Scottish explorer and adventurer [[Ivan T. Sanderson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;inthewake&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Heuvelmans, Bernard |title=In the Wake of the Sea-Serpents |publisher=Hill and Wang |location=New York |year=1968 |isbn=0809058146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heuvelmans' 1955 book ''[[On the Track of Unknown Animals]]'' traces the scholarly origins of the discipline to [[Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans]] and his 1892 study, ''The Great Sea Serpent''.&lt;ref name=&quot;onthetrack&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard Heuvelmans |title=On The Track Of Unknown Animals |location=New York |publisher=Hill and Wang |year=1965 |isbn=0710304986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heuvelmans argued that cryptozoology should be undertaken with [[scientific rigor]], but with an open-minded, [[interdisciplinary]] approach. He also stressed that attention should be given to local, urban and [[folklore|folkloric]] sources regarding such creatures, arguing that while often layered in unlikely and fantastic elements, folktales can have small grains of truth and important information regarding undiscovered organisms. [[Phantom cats]] (an example of living animals supposedly found outside of their normal range) are a common subject of cryptozoological interest,&lt;ref&gt;{{dmoz|Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Cryptozoology/Big_Cats/|Cryptozoology/Big  Cats}}&lt;/ref&gt; largely due to the relative likelihood of existence in comparison to fantastical cryptids lacking any evidence of existence, such as [[Mothman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Big Cat evidence gets stronger, as society calls for government study |url= http://www.britishbigcats.org/news.php |publisher= British Big Cats Society |accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brad Fear |title=A Macabre Myth of a Moth-Man |year=2008 |isbn=1438902646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable book on the subject is [[Willy Ley]]'s ''[[Exotic Zoology (book)|Exotic Zoology]]'' (1959). Ley was best known for his writings on [[rocket]]ry and related topics, but he was trained in [[paleontology]], and wrote a number of books about animals. Ley's collection ''Exotic Zoology'' is of some interest to cryptozoology, as he discusses the [[Yeti]] and [[sea serpent]]s, as well as [[relict]] dinosaurs. The book entertains the possibility that some [[legendary creature]]s (like the [[sirrush]], the [[unicorn]] or the [[cyclops]]) might be based on actual animals, through misinterpretation of the animals and/or their remains. Also notable is the work of British zoologist and cryptozoologist [[Karl Shuker]], who has published 12 books and countless articles on numerous cryptozoological subjects since the mid-1980s. [[Loren Coleman]], a modern popularizer of cryptozoology, has chronicled the history and personalities of cryptozoology in his books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Loren Coleman |title=Tom Slick: True Life Encounters in Cryptozoology |location=Fresno, California |publisher=Craven Street Books/Linden Press year=2002 |isbn=0941936740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discoveries==

Cryptozoologists claim there have been cases where species now accepted by the scientific community were initially considered [[superstition]], [[hoax]]es, delusions or misidentifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coleman_1999&quot; /&gt; The popularly reported European discovery of the [[okapi]] in 1901, earlier hinted at but unseen by [[Henry Morton Stanley]] in his travelogue of exploring the Congo, later became the emblem for the now defunct [[International Society of Cryptozoology]].

The 2003 discovery of the [[fossil]] remains of ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'' was cited by paleontologist [[Henry Gee]], editor of the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' as possible evidence that humanoid cryptids like the [[Orang Pendek]] and [[yeti]] were &quot;founded on grains of truth&quot;. &quot;Cryptozoology&quot;, Gee said, &quot;the study of such fabulous creatures, can come in from the cold.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Henry Gee |year=2004 |work=''Nature'' |url=http://www.bioedonline.org/news/news.cfm?art=1329 |title=Flores, God and Cryptozoology: The discovery poses thorny questions about the uniqueness of Homo sapiens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Cryptozoology has been criticised because of its reliance on anecdotal information&lt;ref name=&quot;shermer&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Shermer|first=Michael|year=2003|title=Show Me the Body|work=[[Scientific American]]|issue=288(5)|page=27|url=http://www.michaelshermer.com/2003/05/show-me-the-body}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because some cryptozoologists do not follow the [[scientific method]]&lt;ref name=&quot;bigfoot&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Coleman|first=Loren|coauthors=Huyghe, Patrick|others=Trumbore, Harry|title=The Field Guide to Bigfoot, Yeti, and Other Mystery Primates Worldwide|publisher=Avon Books|location=New York, New York|date=April 1999|pages=207|chapter=Afterword|isbn=0-380-80263-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lake&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleman|first1=Loren|last2=Huyghe|first2=Patrick|last3=Trumbore|first3=Harry|last4=Rollins|first4=Mark Lee|title=The Field Guide to Lake Monsters, Sea Serpents, and Other Mystery Denizens of the Deep|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York, New York|date=2003|pages=358|isbn=1-58542-252-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and devote a substantial portion of their efforts to investigations of animals that most scientists believe are unlikely to have existed.&lt;ref name=&quot;luumsh&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Dash|first=Mike|title=Borderlands: The Ultimate Exploration of the Unknown|publisher=[[Overlook Press]]|year=2000 |isbn=0440236568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Mike Dash]], a welsh historian, few scientists doubt there are thousands of unknown animals, particularly invertebrates, awaiting discovery; however, cryptozoologists are largely uninterested in researching and cataloging newly-discovered species of [[ant]]s or [[beetle]]s, instead focusing their efforts towards &quot;more elusive&quot; creatures that have often defied decades of work aimed at confirming their existence.&lt;ref name=&quot;luumsh&quot;/&gt; The majority of mainstream criticism of cryptozoology is thus directed towards the search for [[megafauna]] cryptids such as [[Bigfoot]], the [[Yeti]], and the [[Loch Ness Monster]], which appear often in popular culture, but for which there is little or no scientific support. Some scientists argue that megafauna cryptids are unlikely to exist undetected in great enough numbers to maintain a breeding population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/news/bfhunting.html |title=Bigfoot hunting |accessdate=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are unlikely to be able to survive in their reported habitats due to issues of climate and food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sjögren|first=Bengt|title=Berömda vidunder|publisher=Settern|year=1980|isbn=91-7586-023-6}} {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Craig Joseph Charles''' (born 11 July 1964) is an English actor, stand-up comedian, author, poet, radio and television presenter, best-known for playing [[Dave Lister]] in the British cult-favourite [[science fiction]] sitcom ''[[Red Dwarf]]''. Since 2005, he has appeared as [[Lloyd Mullaney]] in the long-running soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]''.

==Early life==
Craig Charles was born to a multiracial family in Liverpool; his father was black and his mother was Irish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/people/craig_charles_person_page.shtml Craig Charles] bbc.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up on the [[Cantril Farm]] estate and went to school with [[Micky Quinn]], who grew up to be a professional footballer.

==Career==
===Early career===
He started out his career as a contemporary and urban [[Performance poetry|performance poet]] on the British [[cabaret]] circuit, and his performances were considered original and Charles was described as having a natural ironic wit which appealed to [[talent scouts]].

Charles began to appear on television, including the late-night comedy programme, ''[[Saturday Live (UK TV series)|Saturday Live]]'', and later became a presenter of [[children's television]] [[television programme|programmes]], such as ''What's That Noise'' on [[BBC One|BBC1]]. He also appeared, weekly, as a [[John Cooper Clarke]]-style 'punk poet' on the BBC1 [[pop music]] [[television programme]] ''The Oxford Road Show''. In 1990, Charles was heard on London Radio Station [[Kiss 100]] as the Breakfast show presenter.

===''Red Dwarf'' fame===
Charles acquired cult status in 1988 as the [[Liverpool|Liverpudlian]] [[wikt:slob|slob]], [[Dave Lister]], in [[BBC Two|BBC2]]'s long-running [[science fiction]] [[comedy]] [[television series]] ''[[Red Dwarf]]''. This was a role Charles played in all eight series until 1999 and in the three part special for television channel [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] in 2009. Charles' younger brother [[Emile Charles]] guest-starred there.

===Other television work===
Charles has appeared briefly in a number of [[television shows]] such as ''[[EastEnders]]'', ''[[Holby City]]'', ''[[The Bill]]'', ''[[Lexx]]'', ''[[The 10 Percenters]]'', ''[[Doctors (BBC soap opera)|Doctors]]'' and ''[[Weakest Link|Celebrity Weakest Link]]''. He was also involved in the controversial [[mockumentary]] ''[[Ghostwatch]]'' in 1992.

Charles' other acting work includes briefly playing the title role in the short-lived [[Channel 4]] sitcom ''[[Captain Butler]]'' (1997).

He has also presented a number of television programmes, most notably at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s. Among his credits as a [[presenter]] are the [[virtual reality]] [[game show]] ''Cyberzone'' (1993) on [[BBC Two|BBC2]]; the late-night entertainment show ''Funky Bunker'' (1997) on [[ITV]]; the [[reality television]] show ''[[Jailbreak (TV series)|Jailbreak]]'' (2000) on [[Five (TV channel)|Five]]; the late-night [[chat show]] ''[[Weapons of Mass Distraction]]'' (2004) on [[ITV]]; and most notably ''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]'' on BBC2 from 1998&amp;ndash;2003, and on [[Five (TV channel)|Five]] from 2003&amp;ndash;2004.

He also provided the [[voice-over]] for the UK version of the Japanese hit TV show ''[[Takeshi's Castle]]'', shown on [[Challenge TV|Challenge]] and [[Ftn]], and was a team captain on the [[sci-fi]]-based quiz show ''[[Space Cadets (game show)|Space Cadets]]'' (1997) on [[Channel 4]].

In 2005, Charles joined the cast of [[ITV]]'s long-running soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'', playing philandering taxicab driver [[Lloyd Mullaney]]. Later that year, he participated in the [[Channel 4]] [[reality television|reality]] sports show, ''[[The Games (UK TV series)|The Games]]'', coming fourth overall in the men's competition.

===Radio work===
Since 2003 Charles has been a [[DJ]] on [[BBC 6 Music]], presenting ''The Craig Charles Funk Show'', a [[funk]] and [[soul (music)|soul]] radio show. He was briefly suspended from ''[[Coronation Street]]'' and BBC 6 Music in June 2006 whilst the production companies investigated allegations of [[crack cocaine]] usage. Charles returned to presenting his show from 4 November 2006. In the week before Christmas 2009 Craig presented afternoon radio programmes on [[BBC Radio Two]].

===Film roles===
Charles starred in two feature films in 2007, ''Clubbing to Death'' and ''Fated''.

===Writing===
In 1993, Craig had work with Russell Bell to write about his 'streetwise' sense of humour on to a range of topics from the world's most embarrassing stories to how to explain the mysteries of the universe. In 1997, he and Russell had written Charles' ''Red Dwarf'' character's book ''The Log'', where Lister, decides to leave a log detailing mankind's greatest achievements, just in case there is a posterity to find it which didn't appear on ''Red Dwarf''. In 1998, Craig decided to work with Philippa Drakeford on his next book called ''No Other Blue'', which cover a range of subjects, including poems about prison, his mother's final illness and politics at home and abroad.

In 2000, he wrote his first autobiography about his experience growing-up in Liverpool ''No Irish, No Niggers''. In 2007, Craig announced that he would release his autobiography in March 2008, published by [[Hodder Headline]] as ''On the Rocks'', which would cover the recent incidents of his life. The autobiography would be based on much of his journal, which he said he kept while in rehab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
In 1984, at the age of 20, Charles married [[England|English]] [[actress]] [[Cathy Tyson]]. Their son Jack Charles was born in 1988. The couple divorced in 1989.

Afterward, Charles dated [[Irish people|Irish]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Suzanne Rhatigan]], co-writing some lyrics for her album ''To Hell with Love'' and directing a video for her. Rhatigan also appeared alongside Charles in the fourth series of ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' for the episode &quot;[[Camille (Red Dwarf episode)|Camille]]&quot;.

In August 1997, Charles married his second wife, Jackie with whom he has two daughters Anna-Jo (born in 1998) and Nellie (born in 2003).

===Rape allegation===
In 1994, Charles and a friend were [[arrested]] and [[remanded in custody]] for several months on a [[rape]] charge. In February 1995, both Charles and his friend were acquitted in their  trial. Whilst in prison Charles was attacked by a man wielding a knife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

|accessdate=2006-12-27 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being cleared, Charles spoke of the need to restore anonymity for those accused of rape. He stated that &quot;the fact that my name and address along with my picture can appear on the front of the papers before the so-called victim has even signed a statement proves that anonymity for rape defendants is a must and that the law must be changed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19950306/ai_n13969745 }} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug use===
In June 2006, a photograph was printed in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' newspaper purporting to show Charles smoking [[crack cocaine]] in the back seat of a taxi. According to the story by writer Stephen Moyes, Charles spent four hours in the taxi smoking crack cocaine from an old drinks can, while instructing the driver to buy him [[pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Charles was arrested in August 2006 on suspicion of possession of a [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|Class A drug]], and later released on [[bail]] pending further enquiries. On 22 September 2006 he accepted a [[Police caution|caution]] for possession of a Class A drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

|accessdate=2006-12-27 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Charles blamed his relapse into drug use on the death of his father, combined with the bitterness stemming from being falsely accused of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1162513/Craig-Charles-I-spent-250-000-crack.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Craig Charles: 'I spent £250,000 on crack' | date=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''County Mayo''' ({{lang-gle|Contae Mhaigh Eo}}) is an [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|administrative]] county in the [[Republic of Ireland]], and one of the thirty-two traditional [[Counties of Ireland|counties]] of the island of [[Ireland]], located in the province of [[Connacht]]. The county was named after the village of [[Mayo, County Mayo|Mayo]], which is now generally known as Mayo Abbey. The county has a population of 123,839.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beyond2020.cso.ie/Census/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=75467 Census 2006 - Population of each province, county and city]&lt;/ref&gt; The county's main towns are [[Castlebar]] and [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ballina]], respectively located in the centre and in the northeast of the county.

==History==
===Prehistory===
[[File:Greystone011-6may08 004.JPG|left|thumb|Megalithic tomb at [[Faulagh]], [[Erris]]]]
County Mayo has a long history and prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayococo.ie/en/Services/Archaeology/&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the county there is a wealth of archaeological remains from the Neolithic period (approx 4,000BC to 2,500BC), particularly in terms of megalithic tombs and ritual stone-circles.

The first people who came to Ireland – mainly to coastal areas as the interior was heavily forested – arrived during the [[Mesolithic|Middle Stone Age]], as long as eleven thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayococo.ie/en/Services/Archaeology/Glossary/&lt;/ref&gt;

Artefacts of [[mesolithic|hunter/gatherers]] are sometimes found in [[midden]]s, rubbish pits around [[hearth]]s where people would have rested and cooked over large open fires. Once cliffs erode, midden-remains become exposed as blackened areas containing charred stones, bones, and shells. They are usually found a metre below the surface. Mesolithic people did not have major rituals associated with burial, unlike those of the Neolithic (New Stone Age) period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/pre_norman_history/neolithic_age.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neolithic period followed the Mesolithic around 6,000 years ago. People began to farm the land, domesticate animals for food and milk, and settle in one place for longer periods. The people had skills such as making pottery, building houses from wood, weaving, and knapping (stone tool working). The first farmers cleared forestry to graze livestock and grow crops. In North Mayo, where the ground cover was fragile, thin soils washed away and [[blanket bog]] covered the land farmed by the Neolithic people.

Extensive pre-bog field systems have been discovered under the blanket bog, particularly along the North Mayo coastline in [[Erris]] and north [[Tyrawley]] at sites such as the [[Céide Fields]], centred on the north east coast.

The Neolithic people developed rituals associated with burying their dead; this is why they built huge, elaborate, galleried stone tombs for their dead leaders, known nowadays as megalithic tombs. There are over 160 recorded megaliths in County Mayo, such as [[Faulagh]], and many more which are unrecorded.

===Megalithic tombs===
There are four distinct types of [[Irish megalithic tombs]] type--[[court cairn|court tomb]]s, [[Dolmen|portal tomb]]s, [[passage grave|passage tomb]]s and [[wedge-shaped gallery grave|wedge tomb]]s--examples of all four types can be found in County Mayo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Heritage/NationalMonuments/FileDownLoad,2293,en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Areas particularly rich in megalithic tombs include [[Achill Island|Achill]], [[Kilcommon]], [[Ballyhaunis]], [[Killala]] and the Behy/Glenurla area around the [[Céide Fields]].

===Bronze Age (2,500 BC to approx 500 BC)===
Megalithic tomb building continued into the [[Bronze Age]] when metal began to be worked for tools alongside the stone tools. The Bronze Age lasted from approx 4,500 years ago to 2,500 years ago (i.e. 2,500BC to 500BC)--archaeological remains from this period include [[stone row|stone alignments]], [[stone circle]]s and [[Fulacht fiadh|fulachta fiadh]] (early cooking sites).  They continued to bury their chieftains in megalithic tombs which changed design during this period, more being of the [[wedge-shaped gallery grave|wedge tomb]] type and [[cist]] burials.

===Iron Age (500 BC to 500 AD approx)===
Around 2,500 years ago the [[Iron Age]] took over from the Bronze Age as more and more metalworking took place.  At the same period the Roman Empire was at its height in Britain but it is not thought that the Roman Empire extended into Ireland to any large degree.   Remains from this period, which lasted until the [[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] period  began about 325AD (with the arrival of St. Patrick into Ireland, as a slave) include [[crannóg]]s (Lake dwellings, [[promontory fort]]s, [[ringfort]]s and [[souterrain]]s of which there are numerous examples across the county.
The [[Iron Age]] was a time of tribal warfare with kingships, each fighting neighbouring kings, vying for control of territories and taking slaves.  Territories were marked by tall stone markers, [[Ogham]] stones, using the first written down words using the [[Ogham inscription|Ogham alphabet]].  The Iron Age is the time period in which the tales of the [[Ulster Cycle]] and sagas took place.  The [[Táin Bó Flidhais]] which took place mainly in [[Erris]] sets the scene well.

===Early Christian Period (325 AD - 800 AD approx)===
[[File:Aghagower St Patrick Statue 2007 08 12.jpg|100px|upright|thumb|Statue of St. Patrick Aghagower]]
Christianity came to Ireland around the start of the 5th century AD.  It brought many changes including the introduction of writing and recording events.   The tribal 'tuatha' and the new religious settlements existed side by side.  Sometimes it suited the chieftains to become part of the early Churches, other times they remained as separate entities.  St. Patrick (4th century AD) may have spent time in County Mayo and it is believed that he spent forty days and forty nights on Croagh Patrick praying for the people of Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;mayo-ireland1&quot;&gt;http://www.mayo-ireland.ie/Mayo/History/FullHist.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
From the middle of the 6th century hundreds of small monastic settlements were established around the county.

Some examples of well-known early monastic sites in Mayo include [[Mayo Abbey]], [[Aughagower]], [[Ballintubber]], [[Errew]], [[Cong, County Mayo|Cong]], [[Killala]], Turlough on the outskirts of Castlebar, and island settlements off the [[Mullet Peninsula]] like the [[Inishkea Islands]], [[Inishglora]] and [[Duvillaun]].

In 795AD the first of the [[Viking]] raids took place.  The Vikings came from [[Scandinavia]] to raid the monasteries as they were places of wealth with precious metal working taking place in them.  Some of the larger ecclesiastical settlements erected [[Irish round tower|round tower]]s to prevent their precious items being plundered and also to show their status and strength against these pagan raiders from the north.  There are round towers at [[Aughagower]], [[Balla]], [[Killala]], Turlough and Meelick.  The Vikings established settlements which later developed into towns (Dublin, Cork, Wexford, Waterford etc..) but none were in County Mayo.
Between the reigns of [[Kings of Connacht]] [[Cathal mac Conchobar mac Taidg]] ([[973]]-[[1010]]) and [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]] ([[1106]]-[[1156]]), various tribal territories were incorporated into the kingdom of Connacht and ruled by the Siol Muirdaig dynasty, based initially at [[Rathcroghan]] in [[County Roscommon]], and from c. 1050 at [[Tuam]]. The families of [[O'Malley (surname)|O'Malley]] and [[O'Dowd]] of Mayo served as [[Admiral]]'s of the [[Naval fleet|fleet]] of [[Connacht]], while families such as O'Lachtnan, [[Mac Fhirbhisigh]], O'Cleary were ecclesiastical and bardic clans.

===Anglo-Normans (12th to 16th centuries)===
From 1169 AD when one of the warring 'kings' ([[Dermot MacMurrough]]) in the east of Ireland appealed to the King of England for help in his fight with a neighbouring king, the response of which was the arrival of the Anglo-Norman colonisation of Ireland.
County Mayo came under Norman control in 1235AD. Norman control meant the eclipse of many Gaelic lords and chieftains, chiefly the O'Connors of Connacht.&lt;ref name=&quot;mayo-ireland1&quot;/&gt;
During the 1230s, the [[Anglo-Norman]]s and [[Wales|Welsh]] under [[Richard Mór de Burgh]] (c. [[1194]]-[[1242]] invaded and settled in the county, introducing new families such as [[Burke (surname)|Burke]], [[Gibbons]], [[Staunton]], [[Prendergast]], [[Morris (surname)|Morris]], [[Joyce (name)|Joyce]], [[Walsh (surname)|Walsh]], [[Barrett (surname)|Barrett]], [[Lynott]], [[Costello]], [[Padden]] and [[Price]], Norman names still common in County Mayo today. Following the collapse of the lordship in the 1330s, all these families became [[estranged]] from the [[Anglo-Irish]] administration based in [[Dublin]] and assimilated with the Gaelic-Irish, adopting their language,religion, dress, laws, customs and culture and marrying into Irish families.  They &quot;became more Irish than the Irish themselves&quot;.

The most powerful clan to emerge during this era were the Mac William Burkes, also known as the Mac William Iochtar (see Burke Civil War 1333-1338, descended from Sir William Liath de Burgh, who defeated the Gaelic-Irish at the [[Second Battle of Athenry]] in August [[1316]]. They were frequently at war with their cousions, [[Clanricarde]] of [[Galway]], and in alliance with or against various factions of the O'Conor's of Siol Muiredaig and [[Kelly (name)|O'Kelly]]'s of [[Uí Maine]]. The [[O'Donnell dynasty|O'Donnell]]'s of [[Tyrconnell]] regularly invaded in an attempt to secure their right to rule.

The Anglo Normans encouraged and established many religious orders from continental Europe to settle in Ireland.  Mendicant orders—Augustinians, Carmelites, Dominicans and Franciscans began new settlements across Ireland and built large churches, many under the patronage of prominent [[Gaels|Gaelic]] families.  Some of these sites include [[Cong, County Mayo|Cong]], [[Strade]], [[Ballintubber]], [[Errew]], [[Burrishoole Friary|Burrishoole Abbey]] and [[Mayo Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-due.de/LI/Anglo_Norman.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 15th and 16th centuries, despite regular conflicts between them as England chopped and changed between religious beliefs, the Irish usually regarded the King of England as their King.  When Queen Elizabeth 1 came to the throne in the mid-16th century, the English people, as was customary at that time, followed the religious practices of the reigning Monarch and  became Protestant.   Many Irish people such as [[Gráínne O'Malley]], the famous pirate queen had close relationships with the English monarchy and the English kings and queens were welcome visitors to Irish shores. The Irish however, generally held onto their Catholic religious practices and beliefs.   The early plantations of settlers in Ireland began during the reign of Queen Mary in the mid-16th century and continued throughout the long reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] until [[1603]].   By then the term ''County Mayo'' had come into use.  In the summer of 1588 the galleons of the [[Spanish Armada]] were wrecked by [[Brian Rua U'Cearbhain|storms along the west coast]] of Ireland. Some of the hapless Spaniards came ashore in Mayo, only to be robbed and imprisoned, and in many cases slaughtered.  Almost all the religious foundations set up by the Anglo Normans were suppressed in the wake of the [[Reformation]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/history/15411598.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protestantism|Protestant]] settlers from [[Scotland]], [[England]], and elsewhere in Ireland, settled in the County in the early 17th century. Many would be killed or forced to flee because of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|1641 Rebellion]], during which a number of massacres were committed by the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Irish, most notably at [[Shrule]] in [[1642]].  A third of the overall population was reported to have perished due to warfare, famine and plague between 1641 and 1653, with several areas remaining disturbed and frequented by [[Whiteboys|Reparees]] into the 1670s.

===17th and 18th centuries===
[[File:Grace O'Malley00.jpg|left|thumb|Gráinne O'Malley meeting Queen Elizabeth 1]]
Pirate Queen [[Gráinne O'Malley]] is probably the best known person from County Mayo from the mid-16th to the turn of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.graceomalley.com/timeline.php&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1640s when Oliver Cromwell overthrew the English monarchy and set up a parliamentarian government, Ireland suffered severely.  With a stern regime in absolute control needing to pay its armies and friends, the need to pay them with grants of land in Ireland led to the '[[to hell or to Connaught]]' policies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.libraryireland.com/IrishIndependence/22.php&lt;/ref&gt; Displaced native Irish families from other (eastern and southern mostly) parts of the country were either forced to leave the country, often as slaves, or (if they had been well behaved and compliant with the orders of the parliamentarians) awarded grants of land 'west of the Shannon' and put off their own lands in the east.  The land in the west was divided and sub-divided between more and more people as huge estates were granted on the best land in the east to those who best pleased the English.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irish-society.org/Hedgemaster%20Archives/Cromwell_2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Mayo does not seem to have been affected much during the [[Williamite War in Ireland]], though many natives were outlawed and exiled.
[[File:Nephin Mountain, County Mayo July 2010.jpg|thumb|Nephin Mountain, County Mayo]]
For the vast majority of people in County Mayo the 18th century was a period of unrelieved misery. Because of 'the penal laws', Catholics had no hope of social advancement while they remained in their native land. Some, like [[William Brown (admiral)]] (1777–1857), left Foxford with his family at the age of nine and thirty years later was an admiral in the fledgling Argentine Navy. Today he is a national hero in that country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.con-telegraph.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=326:illustrious-and-amazing-career-of-admiral-william-brown&amp;catid=52:mayo-history&amp;Itemid=89&lt;/ref&gt;

The general unrest in Ireland was felt just as keenly across Mayo and as the 18th century approached and news reached Ireland about the [[American War of Independence]] and the [[French Revolution]], the downtrodden Irish, constantly suppressed by  Government policies and decisions from Dublin and London, began to rally themselves for their own stand against English rule in their country. By 1798 the Irish were ready for rebellion.  The French came to help the Irish cause.  [[Jean Joseph Amable Humbert|General Humbert]], from France landed in [[Killala]] with over 1,000 officers where they started to march across the county towards [[Battle of Castlebar|Castlebar]] where there was an English garrison. Taking them by surprise Humbert's army was victorious.  He established a 'Republic of Connacht' with one of the Moore family from [[Moore Hall, County Mayo|Moore Hall]] near Partry.  Humbert's army marched on towards Sligo, Leitrim and Longford where they were suddenly faced with a massive English army and were forced to surrender in less than half an hour.  The French soldiers were treated honourably, but for the Irish the surrender meant slaughter.  Many died on the scaffold in towns like Castlebar and Claremorris, where the high sheriff for County Mayo, the Honourable Denis Browne, M.P., brother of Lord Altamont, wreaked a terrible vengeance - thus earning for himself the nickname which has survived in folk-memory to the present day, 'Donnchadh an Rópa' (Denis of the Rope).

In the 18th century and early 19th century, sectarian tensions arose as evangelical Protestant missionaries sought to 'redeem the Irish poor from the errors of Popery'.  One of the best known was the Rev. Edward Nangle's mission at Dugort in [[Achill Island|Achill]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayococo.ie/en/Services/Environment/LeisureAmenities/Beaches/Doogort/&lt;/ref&gt;  These too were the years of the campaign for Catholic Emancipation and, later, for the abolition of the tithes, which a predominately Catholic population was forced to pay for the upkeep of the clergy of the Established (Protestant) Church.

===19th and 20th centuries===
During the early years of the 19th century, famine was a common occurrence, particularly where population pressure was a problem.  The population of Ireland grew to over eight million people prior to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] of 1845/47
The Irish people depended on the potato crop for their sustenance.  Disaster struck in August 1845, when a killer fungus (later diagnosed as Phytophthora infestans) started to destroy the potato crop. When widespread famine struck, about a million people died and a further million left the country. People died in the fields from starvation and disease.  The catastrophe was particularly bad in County Mayo, where nearly ninety per cent of the population depended on the potato as their staple food. By 1848, Mayo was a county of total misery and despair, with any attempts at alleviating measures in complete disarray.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.libraryireland.com/articles/FamineBelmulletFriends/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michael davitt.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Michael Davitt]]
There are numerous reminders of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] to be seen on the Mayo landscape: workhouse sites, famine graves, sites of soup-kitchens, deserted homes and villages and even traces of undug 'lazy-beds' in fields on the sides of hills. Many roads and lanes were built as famine relief measures. There were nine workhouses in the county: Ballina, Ballinrobe, Belmullet, Castlebar, Claremorris, Killala, Newport, Swinford and Westport.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayohistory.com/H18to19.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A small poverty-stricken place called [[Knock Shrine|Knock]], County Mayo, made headlines when it was announced that an apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Joseph and St. John had taken place there on 21 August 1879, witnessed by fifteen local people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.knock-shrine.ie/witnesses-accounts&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Cunningham Boycott (Vanity Fair).jpg|thumb|upright|Captain Boycott]]
A national movement was initiated in County Mayo during 1879 by [[Michael Davitt]], [[James Daly (Irish Land League)|James Daly]], and others, which brought about the greatest social change ever witnessed in Ireland.  Michael Davitt, a labourer whose family had moved to England joined forces with Charles Stewart Parnell to win back the land for the people from the landlords and stop evictions for non payment of rents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishidentity.com/stories/parnelldav.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A new word came into the English language through an incident that occurred in Mayo.  An English landlord called Captain Charles Cunningham [[Boycott]] could get no workers to do anything for him, so unpleasant as he was to them, so he brought in Protestant workers from elsewhere.  He spent so much on security and protection for them that his harvest cost him a fortune and also nobody in the area would serve him in shops, or deal with him.  This ostracisation  became known as 'boycotting' and Captain Boycott was left with no option but to leave Mayo and take his family with him to England.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.askaboutireland.ie/learning-zone/primary-students/looking-at-places/mayo/michael-davitt/captain-boycott/&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Land Question' was gradually resolved by a scheme of state-aided land purchase schemes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-IrishLan.html&lt;/ref&gt; The tenants became the owners of their lands under the newly set-up [[Irish Land Commission|Land Commission]].

A Mayo nun, Mother Agnes Morrogh-Bernard (1842–1932), set up the Foxford Woollen Mill in 1892. She made Foxford synonymous throughout the world with high quality tweeds, rugs and blankets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discoverireland.com/us/ireland-things-to-see-and-do/listings/product/?fid=FI_444&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museumsofmayo.com/foxford1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayo has remained an essentially rural community to the present day.

In the early historic period, what is now County Mayo consisted of a number of large kingdoms, minor lordships and [[Faulagh|tribes of obscure origins]]. They included:

* [[Calraige]]            - pre-historic tribe found in the parishes of [[Attymass]], [[Kilgarvan]], [[Crossmolina]] and the [[River Moy]]
* [[Ciarraige]]           - settlers from [[Munster]] found in south-east Mayo around [[Kiltimagh]] and west [[County Roscommon]]
* [[Conmhaícne|Conmaicne]]           - a people located in the [[barony (country subdivision)|barony]] of [[Kilmaine]], alleged descendants of [[Fergus mac Róich]]
* [[Fir Domnann]]         - branch of the [[Laigin]], originally from [[United Kingdom|Britain]], located in [[Erris]]
* [[Gamanraige]]          - pre-historic [[kings of Connacht]], famous for battle with [[Medb]] &amp; [[Ailill mac Máta|Ailill]] of [[Rathcroghan|Cruachan]] in [[Táin Bó Flidhais]].  Based in [[Erris]], [[Carrowmore Lake]], [[Killala Bay]], [[Lough Conn]].
* [[Gailenga]]            - kingdom extending east from [[Castlebar]] to adjoining parts of Mayo
* [[Uí Fiachrach]] Muidhe - a [[sept]] of the [[Connachta]], based around [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ballina]], some of whom were [[kings of Connacht]]
* [[Partraige]]           - apparently a pre-[[Gaels|Gaelic]] people of [[Lough Mask]] and [[Lough Carra]], namesakes of [[Partry]]
* Ui Mail                 - kingdom surrounding [[Clew Bay]], east towards [[Castlebar]], its rulers adopted the surname [[O'Malley (surname)|O'Malley]]

==Geography==
[[File:Glengad Stone circle overlooking Broadhaven Bay Kilcommon, Erris North Mayo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Glengad]] [[Stone circle]], [[Kilcommon]], [[Erris]]]]
Mayo is the third largest of Ireland’s 32 counties in area and 15th largest in terms of population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Eoghan| last=Corry| title=The GAA Book of Lists| publisher=Hodder Headline Ireland| year=2005| id= | pages=186–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second largest of Connacht’s five counties in both size and population.  There is a distinct geological difference between the north and the south of the county.  The north consists largely of poor subsoils, and is covered with large areas of extensive Atlantic blanket-bog, whereas the south is largely a limestone landscape in common with almost 70% of the 'green' fields of Ireland.  Agricultural land in the south is, therefore, more productive than that in the north.

*The highest point in Mayo and Connacht is [[Mweelrea]], at {{m to ft|814|abbr=yes}}.
*The river [[River Moy|Moy]] in the northeast of the county is renowned for its [[salmon]] [[fishing]].
*Ireland's largest island, [[Achill Island]], lies off Mayo's west coast.
*Mayo has Ireland's highest cliffs (second highest in Europe{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}) at [[Croaghaun]], Achill island while the [[Benwee Head]] cliffs in [[Kilcommon]] [[Erris]] drop almost perpendicularly {{convert|900|ft|m}} into the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  There is a spectacular viewing point on the top of the cliffs opposite the entrance to the [[Céide Fields]] near [[Ballycastle, County Mayo|Ballycastle]] in North Mayo.
*The north-west areas of County Mayo have some of the best renewable energy resources in Europe, if not the world, in terms of  wind resources, ocean wave, tidal and hydroelectric resources.

===Sub-divisions===
[[File:Baronies of Mayo.jpg|thumb|Map of County Mayo depicting its nine baronies]]
County Mayo is divided into nine [[barony (country subdivision)|baronies]], four in the northern area and five in the south of the county:

'''North Mayo'''
*[[Erris]] (north west containing [[Belmullet]], [[Gweesalia]], [[Bangor Erris]], [[Kilcommon]] etc..)
*[[Burrishoole]] (west Mayo containing [[Achill Island|Achill]], [[Mulranny]] and [[Newport, County Mayo]])
*[[Barony of Gallen|Gallen]] (east Mayo containing [[Bonniconlon, County Mayo|Bonniconlon]], [[Foxford]])
*[[Tyrawley]] (north east containing [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ballina]], [[Ballycastle, County Mayo|Ballycastle]], [[Killala]])

'''South Mayo'''
*[[Clanmorris]], (south east - [[Claremorris]] and [[Balla]])
*[[Barony of Costello|Costello]] (east south east containing [[Kilkelly]] [[Ballyhaunis]]) etc..
*[[Murrisk]] south west containing [[Westport, County Mayo|Westport]], [[Louisburgh, County Mayo|Louisburgh]], [[Croagh Patrick]] etc..)
*[[Kilmaine]] (south containing [[Ballinrobe]], [[Cong, County Mayo|Cong]] etc.)
*[[Carra, County Mayo|Carra]] (south containing [[Castlebar]], [[Partry]] etc..)

===Towns and villages===
[[Castlebar]] and [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ballina]] are the two most populous towns in the county, with 17,891 and 10,146 residents respectively according to the 2006 census; Ballina being much larger by land area. These are followed by [[Westport, County Mayo|Westport]], a popular tourist town, which has some 5,000 residents. The fourth largest town is [[Claremorris]], a market town, with a population of 3,170 in the 2006 census returns.

The county has experienced perhaps the highest emigration out of Ireland.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In the 1840s-1880s, waves of emigrants left the rural townlands of the county. Initially triggered by the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] and then in search of work in the newly industrialising England, Scotland and the United States, the population fell considerably. From 388,887 in 1841, the population fell to 199,166 in 1901. The population reached a low of 109,525 in 1971 as emigration continued.

===Irish language===
9% of the population of County Mayo live in the [[Gaeltacht]]. The Gaeltacht Irish-speaking region in County Mayo is the third largest in Ireland with 10,868 inhabitants. Tourmakeady is the largest town in this area. All schools in the area use Irish as the language of instruction.

[[File:Justice for the Rossport 5.jpg|300px|right|thumb|'Justice' (for the Rossport 5) mowed in Ros Dumhach hay field]]
There is local resistance to [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]'s decision to refine raw [[natural gas|gas]] from the [[Corrib gas field]] at an onshore [[refinery]]. In 2005, five local men were jailed for [[contempt of court]] after refusing to facilitate Shell's work. Subsequent protests against the project led to the [[Shell to Sea]] and related campaigns.

===Energy Audit===
The Mayo Energy Audit 2009-2020 is an investigation into the implications of [[peak oil]] and subsequent [[fossil fuel|fossil fuel depletion]] for a [[rural area|rural]] county in west of Ireland. The study draws together many different strands to examine current [[energy supply]] and demand within the area of study, and assesses these demands in
the face of the challenges posed by the declining production of fossil fuels and expected disruptions to supply chains, and by long term economic [[recession]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sustainability.ie/energyplan.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energybulletin.net/node/47704&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://zone5.org/2009/01/mayo-energy-audit/&lt;/ref&gt;

Fermanagh was made into a county by statute of Elizabeth I, but it was not until the time of the [[Plantation of Ulster]] that it was finally brought under civil government.

Fermanagh was a stronghold of the [[Maguire of Fermanagh|Maguire clan]] and Donn Carrach Maguire (died 1302) was the first of the chiefs of the Maguire dynasty. However on the confiscation of lands relating to [[Hugh Maguire]], Fermanagh was divided in similar manner to the other five escheated counties among Scottish and English undertakers and native Irish. The baronies of Knockinny and Maghenaboy were allotted to Scottish undertakers, those of Clankelly, Magherastephana and Lurg to English undertakers and those of Clanawley, Coole, and Tyrkennedy, to servitors and natives. The chief families to benefit under the new settlement were the families of Cole, Blennerhasset, Butler, Hume, and Dunbar.

It is one of four [[Counties of Ireland|counties]] of Northern Ireland presently to have a majority of the population from a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] background, according to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]].

The [[Annals of Ulster]] were written at Belle Isle on [[Lough Erne]].

[[Fermanagh District Council]] is the only one of the 26 district councils in Northern Ireland that contains all of the county it is named after. The district council also contains a small section of [[County Tyrone]] in the [[Dromore, County Tyrone|Dromore]] and [[Kilskeery]] road areas.

Fermanagh is part of the [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone Parliamentary Constituency]], renowned for high levels of voting and for electing [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] [[hunger strike|hunger-striker]] [[Bobby Sands]] as a [[Member of Parliament]] in the [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election, April 1981]], shortly before his death.

==Industry and tourism==
Agriculture and tourism are two of the most important industries in Fermanagh. The main types of farming in the area are beef, dairy, sheep, pigs and some poultry. Most of the agricultural land is used as grassland for grazing and silage or hay rather than for other crops.

The waterways are extensively used by cabin cruisers, other small pleasure craft and anglers. The main town of Fermanagh is [[Enniskillen]] ({{lang|ga|''Inis Ceithleann''}}, 'Ceithleann's island'). The island town hosts a range of attractions including the [[Castle Coole]] Estate and [[Enniskillen Castle]], which is home to the [[museum]] of The [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]] and the [[5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards]].

Attractions outside Enniskillen include:

The '''geography of [[Colombia]]''' is characterized by containing five main [[natural region]]s that present their own unique characteristics, from the [[Andes|Andes mountain range]] region shared with [[Ecuador]] and [[Venezuela]]; the [[Pacific Ocean]] [[Pacific Coast|coastal]] region shared with [[Panama]] and Ecuador; the [[Caribbean Sea]] coastal region shared with Venezuela and Panama; the ''[[Llanos]]'' (plains) shared with Venezuela; to the [[Amazon Rainforest]] region shared with Venezuela, [[Brazil]], [[Peru]] and Ecuador. Colombia is the only South American country which borders both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

Colombia is located in the northwestern region of [[South America]] bordering to the east with Venezuela and Brazil; to the south with Ecuador and Peru; to the North with the [[Atlantic Ocean]], through the [[Caribbean Sea]]; and to the west with [[Panama]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name=UNAL&gt;[http://www.virtual.unal.edu.co/cursos/humanas/2004878/docs_curso/contenido/c4l1geologica.htm {{es icon}} UNAL: History of the Colombian current territory] UNAL Accessed 23 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Colombia is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|26th largest nation]] in the [[world]] and the fourth-largest country in South America after Brazil, [[Argentina]], and Peru.&lt;ref name=DANE&gt;[http://www.dane.gov.co/dane_censo/mapa/censo2005/Ficha/2004.htm DANE: 2005 Census of Colombia - total area] dane.gov.co Accessed 23 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its large territory, Colombia's population is not evenly distributed with most Colombians living in the mountainous western portion of the country as well as the northern coastline, most living in or near the capital city of [[Bogotá]]. The southern and eastern portions of the country are mostly sparsely inhabited tropical rainforest and inland tropical plains containing small farming communities and indigenous tribes.

==Natural regions==
{{Main article|Natural Regions of Colombia}}

Colombia usually classifies its geography into five regions. Despite this ''[[The World Factbook]]'' makes no difference between Amazon region of Colombia (predominantly jungle) and the Orinoquia region of Colombia (predominantly plains). ''The World Factbook'' considers most appropriate to divide the country into four geographic regions: the Andean highlands, consisting of the three Andean ranges and intervening valley lowlands; the Caribbean lowlands coastal region; the Pacific lowlands coastal region, separated from the Caribbean lowlands by swamps at the base of the Isthmus of Panama; and eastern Colombia, the great plain that lies to the east of the [[Andes|Andes Mountains]]. 

The chief western mountain range, the [[Cordillera Occidental (Colombia)|Cordillera Occidental]], is a moderately high range with peaks reaching up to about {{convert|15000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} (4,670 m).&lt;ref name=&quot;andesmap&quot;&gt;{{cite web

  | work =
  | publisher = Nelles Map
  | date =
  | url=http://andes.zoom-maps.com/
  | accessdate=2011-01-10}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cauca River Valley]], an important agricultural region with several large cities on its borders, separates the Cordillera Occidental from the massive [[Cordillera Central]]. Several snow-clad volcanoes in the Cordillera Central have summits that rise above {{convert|17000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. The valley of the slow-flowing and muddy [[Magdalena River]], a major transportation artery, separates the Cordillera Central from the main eastern range, the Cordillera Oriental. The peaks of the Cordillera Oriental are moderately high. This range differs from Colombia's other mountain ranges in that it contains several large basins. In the east, the sparsely populated, flat to gently rolling eastern lowlands called ''[[llanos]]'' cover almost 60 percent of the country's total land area.

This cross section of the republic does not include two of Colombia's regions: the Caribbean coastal lowlands and the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]], both in the northern part of the country. The lowlands in the west are mostly swampy; the reed-filled marshes of the area are called ''ciénagas'' by the people of Colombia. The [[Guajira Peninsula]] in the east is semiarid. The [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] is a spectacular triangular snowcapped block of rock that towers over the eastern part of this lowland. Here can be found the highest peak of the country named [[Pico Cristobal Colon]] (5775 m).&lt;ref name=&quot;andesmap&quot; /&gt;

===Andean region===
{{Main article|Andean Region of Colombia}}

[[Image:Rabanal.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Páramo of Rabanal]], [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]].]]
[[Image:Usgs-glaciers-colombia.png|thumb|right|250px|Glaciers in Colombia.]]

Near the Ecuadorian frontier, the Andes Mountains divide into three distinct, roughly parallel chains, called cordilleras, that extend northeastward almost to the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Altitudes reach more than {{convert|18700|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, and mountain peaks are permanently covered with snow. The elevated basins and plateaus of these ranges have a moderate climate that provides pleasant living conditions and in many places enables farmers to harvest twice a year. Torrential rivers on the slopes of the mountains produce a large [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] potential and add their volume to the navigable rivers in the valleys. In the late 1980s, approximately 78 percent of the country's population lived in the Andean highlands.

The Cordillera Occidental in the west, the Cordillera Central in the center, and the Cordillera Oriental in the east have different characteristics. Geologically, the Cordillera Occidental and the Cordillera Central form the western and eastern sides of a massive crystalline arch that extends from the Caribbean lowlands to the southern border of Ecuador. The Cordillera Oriental, however, is composed of folded stratified rocks overlying a crystalline core.

The Cordillera Occidental is relatively low and is the least populated of the three cordilleras. Summits are only about {{convert|9840|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level and do not have permanent snows. Few passes exist, although one that is about {{convert|4985|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level provides the major city of [[Santiago de Cali|Cali]] with an outlet to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The relatively low elevation of the cordillera permits dense vegetation, which on the western slopes is truly tropical.

The Cordillera Occidental is separated from the Cordillera Central by the deep rift of the Cauca Valley. The Río Cauca rises within {{convert|124|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} of the border with [[Ecuador]] and flows through some of the best farmland in the country. After the two cordilleras converge, the Cauca Valley becomes a deep gorge all the way to the Caribbean lowlands.

The Cordillera Central is the loftiest of the mountain systems. Its crystalline rocks form a towering wall dotted with snow-covered volcanoes that is {{convert|500|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} long. There are no plateaus in this range and no passes under {{convert|10825|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. The highest peak in this range, the [[Nevado del Huila]], reaches {{convert|17602|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. The second highest peak is a volcano, [[Nevado del Ruiz]], which erupted violently on November 13, 1985. Toward its northern end, this cordillera separates into several branches that descend toward the Caribbean coast.

Between the Cordillera Central and the Cordillera Oriental flows the [[Magdalena River]]. This {{convert|1600|km|mi|0|adj=on|sp=us}}-long river rises near a point some {{convert|180|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of the border with Ecuador, where the Cordillera Oriental and the Cordillera Central diverge. Its spacious drainage area is fed by numerous mountain torrents originating high in the snowfields. The Magdalena River is generally navigable from the Caribbean Sea as far as the town of [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]], deep in the interior, but is interrupted midway by rapids. The valley floor is very deep; nearly {{convert|800|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the river's mouth the elevation is no more than about {{convert|300|m|ft|0|sp=us}}.

In the Cordillera Oriental at elevations between {{convert|2500|and|2700|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, three large fertile basins and a number of small ones provide suitable areas for settlement and intensive economic production. In the basin of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]], where the Spanish found the Chibcha Indians, the European invaders established the town of Santa Fe de Bogotá (present-day [[Bogotá]]) at an elevation of {{convert|2650|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level.

To the north of Bogotá, in the densely populated basins of [[Chiquinquirá]] and [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]], are fertile fields, rich mines, and large industrial establishments that produce much of the national wealth. Still farther north, where the Cordillera Oriental makes an abrupt turn to the northwest near the border with [[Venezuela]], the highest point of this range, the Sierra Nevada de Cocuy, rises to {{convert|5493|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level. In the [[Santander Department|department of Santander]], the valleys on the western slopes are more spacious, and agriculture is intensive in the area around [[Bucaramanga]]. The northernmost region of the range around [[Cúcuta]] is so rugged that historically it has been easier to maintain communications and transportation with Venezuela than with the adjacent parts of Colombia.

[[Image:Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta desde el espacio.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]], the highest standing mountain by the sea.]]

The Caribbean lowlands consist of all of Colombia north of an imaginary line extending northeastward from the [[Gulf of Urabá|Golfo de Urabá]] to the Venezuelan frontier at the northern extremity of the Cordillera Oriental. The semiarid [[Guajira Peninsula]] and [[Guajira-Barranquilla xeric scrub]], in the extreme north, bear little resemblance to the rest of the region. In the southern part rises the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]], an isolated mountain system with peaks reaching heights over {{convert|5700|m|ft|0|sp=us}} and slopes generally too steep for cultivation.

The Caribbean lowlands region is in roughly the shape of a triangle, the longest side of which is the coastline. Most of the country's commerce moves through Cartagena, Barranquilla, Santa Marta, and the other ports located along this important coast. Inland from these cities are swamps, hidden streams, and shallow lakes that support banana and cotton plantations, countless small farms, and, in higher places, cattle ranches. 

The city of Cartagena is mostly a touristic city with some basic industry, such as Santa marta, but the latter is a smaller-scale city by comparison. barranquilla is located some {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} away from the caribbean sea coastline but it's a more advanced and developed city with a much more complex industrial capacity, widely renowed for its talent and efficiency in all forms of metalworks, construction and the development of sciences and engineerings, being that its inhabitants have the highest cultural level of the region and the city is famous for its technical and scientifical achievements being the starting point and focus of the region and the country's development as the first city in the country with the use of phones, public lighting, air mail, planes and industrial works as well as cultural events and such.

The Caribbean region merges into and is connected with the Andean highlands through the two great river valleys. After the Andean highlands, it is the second most important region in economic activity. Approximately 17% of the country's population lived in this region in the late 1980s. 

The region also includes the peninsular archipelago of [[San Andres Island]] and the Insular Territories of Colombia, which are disputed in part by Nicaragua. However, the Colombian Navy protects such territories with the use of force when necessary to avoid drug trade or foreign invasion and the islands are home to 2 important bases for defense and custom controls, formerly used for research of classified projects with civilian assistance as the local universities often research in the area of oceanography and marine biology but also in the fields of biochemistry, genetics, immunology and Colombia is known for its advances in medical fields in experimental surgery, implant development or prosthetics and immunology and these facilities serve as containment and secure experimentation labs to complement those in Barranquilla and other undisclosed locations within the coast territories.

The '''Insular Region''' is considered by some as a [[geopolitical]] region of [[Colombia]] which comprises the areas outside the [[continental territories]] of [[Colombia]] and includes the [[San Andrés y Providencia Department]] in the [[Caribbean sea]] and the [[Malpelo Island|Malpelo]] and [[Gorgona, Colombia|Gorgona]] Islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The Insular region subregions include other group of [[islands]];

* [[Islas del Rosario]].(Caribbean)
* [[Isla Fuerte]].(Caribbean)
* [[Isla Barú]].(Caribbean)
* [[Isla Tortuguilla]].(Caribbean)
* [[Isla Tierra Bomba]]. (Caribbean)

On an special note, although the border between the Caribbean region and the Andes region has some presence of guerrilla left-wing exremist groups and some paramilitary right-wing groups, their presence is marginal in that area and even more minoritary in the rest of the Caribbean region, as opposed to the heavy presence and social infiltration they have in the inner side of the country where they are infiltrated in most levels of society and economic sectors or establishments and institutions while the government fights heavily to purge such insurgent infiltrates out of such cities. Arguably, it's the &quot;peace zone&quot; of the country for its low criminality, the low-level violence of its crimes and the absence of major organized crimes, gangs and the sort which make the regions afe for tourism from international visitors and this is due to the native people's desdain for the use of violence, brutality and for violent crime or aggression, in spite of being the region where the best and fiercest fighters in Boxing and other fighting and contact sports, martial arts and wrestling, and also where most of the male inhabitants and natives know one of such styles and follows it regularly on the news and sports broadcasts and shows.

===Pacific region===
{{Main article|Pacific Region of Colombia}}

The western third of the country is the most geographically complex. Starting at the shore of the Pacific Ocean in the west and moving eastward at a latitude of [[5th parallel north|4622982 degrees north]], a diverse sequence of features is encountered. In the extreme west are the very narrow and discontinuous Pacific coastal lowlands, which are backed by the [[Baudó Mountains|Serranía de Baudó]], the lowest and narrowest of Colombia's mountain ranges. Next is the broad region of the [[Atrato River|Río Atrato]]/[[San Juan River (Colombia)|Río San Juan]] lowland, which has been proposed as a possible alternate to the [[Panama Canal]] as a human-made route between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. Colombia occupies most of the Andes mountain range northern extremity sharing a bit with Venezuela which splits into three branches between the Colombia-Ecuador border.  

In the 1980s, only 3% of all Colombians resided in the Pacific lowlands, a region of jungle and swamp with considerable but little-exploited potential in minerals and other resources. Buenaventura is the only port of any size on the coast. On the east, the Pacific lowlands are bounded by the Cordillera Occidental, from which numerous streams run. Most of the streams flow westward to the Pacific, but the largest, the navigable Río Atrato, flows northward to the Golfo de Urabá, making the river settlements accessible to the major Atlantic ports and commercially related primarily to the Caribbean lowlands hinterland. To the west of the Río Atrato rises the [[Baudó Mountains|Serranía de Baudó]], an isolated chain of low mountains that occupies a large part of the region. Its highest elevation is less than 1,800 meters, and its vegetation resembles that of the surrounding tropical forest.

The [[Darién Gap|Atrato Swamp]]—in Chocó Department adjoining the border with Panama—is a deep muck sixty-five kilometers in width that for years has challenged engineers seeking to complete the [[Pan-American Highway]]. This stretch, near [[Turbo, Colombia|Turbo]], where the highway is interrupted is known as the Tapón del Chocó (Chocon Plug). A second major transportation project involving Chocó Department has been proposed. A second interoceanic canal would be constructed by dredging the Río Atrato and other streams and digging short access canals. Completion of either of these projects would do much to transform this region, although it could have devastating consequences on the fragile environment.

===Orinoquía region===
{{Main article|Orinoquía Region of Colombia}}

The area east of the Andes includes about 699,300 square kilometers, or three-fifths of the country's total area, but Colombians view it almost as an alien land. The entire area, known as the eastern plains, was home to only 2% of the country's population in the late 1980s. The Spanish term for plains ([[llanos]]) can be applied only to the open plains in the northern part, particularly the piedmont areas near the Cordillera Oriental, where extensive cattle raising is practiced.

The region is unbroken by highlands except in [[Meta Department]], where the [[Serranía de la Macarena]], an out lier of the Andes has unique vegetation and wildlife believed to be reminiscent of those that once existed throughout the Andes.

===Amazon region===
{{Main article|Amazon Region of Colombia}}

Many of the numerous large rivers of eastern Colombia are navigational. The [[Río Guaviare]] and the streams to its north flow eastward and drain into the basin of the [[Río Orinoco]], river that crosses into Venezuela and flows into the Atlantic Ocean. Those south of the Río Guaviare flow into the [[Amazon Basin]]. The Río Guaviare divides eastern Colombia into the llanos subregion in the north and the tropical rainforest, or selva, subregion in the south.

==Climate==
{{main|Climate of Colombia}}

[[Image:Colombia.A2004117.1535.250m.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Flooding in Colombia, April 2004]]

The striking variety in temperature and precipitation results principally from differences in elevation. Temperatures range from very hot at sea level to relatively cold at higher elevations but vary little with the season. At Bogotá, for example, the average annual temperature is {{convert|15|°C}}, and the difference between the average of the coldest and the warmest months is less than {{convert|1|°C|1}}. More significant, however, is the daily variation in temperature, from {{convert|5|°C}} at night to {{convert|17|°C|1}} during the day.

Colombians customarily describe their country in terms of the climatic zones: the area under {{convert|900|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in elevation is called the hot zone (tierra caliente), elevations between {{convert|900|and|1980|m|ft|0|sp=us}} are the temperate zone (tierra templada), and elevations from {{convert|1980|m|ft|0|sp=us}} to about {{convert|3500|m|ft|0|sp=us}} constitute the cold zone (tierra fría). The upper limit of the cold zone marks the tree line and the approximate limit of human habitation. The treeless regions adjacent to the cold zone and extending to approximately {{convert|4500|m|ft|0|sp=us}} are high, bleak areas (usually referred to as the páramos), above which begins the area of permanent snow (nevado).

About 86% of the country's total area lies in the hot zone. Included in the hot zone and interrupting the temperate area of the Andean highlands are the long and narrow extension of the Magdalena Valley and a small extension in the Cauca Valley. Temperatures, depending on elevation, vary between {{convert|24|and|38|°C|°F|1}}, and there are alternating dry and wet seasons corresponding to summer and winter, respectively. Breezes on the Caribbean coast, however, reduce both heat and precipitation.

Rainfall in the hot zone is heaviest in the Pacific lowlands and in parts of eastern Colombia, where rain is almost a daily occurrence and rain forests predominate. Precipitation exceeds {{convert|7600|mm|in|1|sp=us}} annually in most of the Pacific lowlands, making this one of the wettest regions in the world. The highest average annual precipitation in the world is estimated to be in Lloro, Colombia, with {{convert|13299|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalextremes.html Global Measured Extremes of Temperature and Precipitation]. ''[[National Climatic Data Center]]''.  August 9, 2005.  Last accessed January 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In eastern Colombia, it decreases from {{convert|6350|mm|in|0|sp=us}} in portions of the Andean piedmont to {{convert|2540|mm|in|0|sp=us}} eastward. Extensive areas of the Caribbean interior are permanently flooded, more because of poor drainage than because of the moderately heavy precipitation during the rainy season from May through October.

The temperate zone covers about 8% of the country. This zone includes the lower slopes of the Cordillera Oriental and the Cordillera Central and most of the intermontane valleys. The important cities of Medellín ({{convert|1487|m|ft|0|sp=us|disp=/}}) and Cali ({{convert|1030|m|ft|0|sp=us|disp=/}}) are located in this zone, where rainfall is moderate and the mean annual temperature varies between {{convert|19|and|24|°C|°F|1}}, depending on the elevation. In the higher elevations of this zone, farmers benefit from two wet and two dry seasons each year; January through March and July through September are the dry seasons.

[[Image:Rio Atrato.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[Atrato River]].]]

The cold or cool zone constitutes about 6% of the total area, including some of the most densely populated plateaus and terraces of the Colombian Andes; this zone supports about onefourth of the country's total population. The mean temperature ranges between {{convert|10|and|19|°C|°F|1}}, and the wet seasons occur in April and May and from September to December, as in the high elevations of the temperate zone.

Precipitation is moderate to heavy in most parts of the country; the heavier rainfall occurs in the low-lying hot zone. Considerable variations occur because of local conditions that affect wind currents, however, and areas on the leeward side of the Guajira Peninsula receive generally light rainfall; the annual rainfall of {{convert|350|mm|in|1|sp=us}} recorded at the Uribia station there is the lowest in Colombia. Considerable year-to-year variations have been recorded, and Colombia sometimes experiences droughts.

Colombia's geographic and climatic variations have combined to produce relatively well-defined &quot;ethnocultural&quot; groups among different regions of the country: the Costeño from the Caribbean coast; the Caucano in the Cauca region and the Pacific coast; the Antioqueño in Antioquia, Caldas, Risaralda, and Valle del Cauca departments; the Tolimense in Tolima and Huila departments; the Cundiboyacense in the interior departments of Cundinamarca and Boyacá in the Cordillera Oriental; the Santandereano in Norte de Santander and Santander departments; and the Llanero in the eastern plains. Each group has distinctive characteristics, accents, customs, social patterns, and forms of cultural adaptation to climate and topography that differentiates it from other groups. Even with rapid urbanization and modernization, regionalism and regional identification continued to be important reference points, although they were somewhat less prominent in the 1980s than in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Colombia's proximity to the equator influences its climates. The lowland areas are continuously hot. Altitude affects temperature greatly. Temperatures decrease about&lt;br&gt; {{convert|3.5|F-change}} for every {{convert|1000|ft|m|0|adj=on}} increase in altitude above sea level. Rainfall varies by location in Colombia, tending to increase as one travels southward. This is especially true in the eastern lowlands. For example, rainfall in parts of the [[Guajira Peninsula]] seldom exceeds {{convert|30|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} per year. Colombia's rainy southeast, however, is often drenched by more than {{convert|200|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain per year. Rainfall in most of the rest of the country runs between these two extremes.

==Flora and fauna==
{{See also|Fauna of Colombia|Flora of Colombia}}

Altitude affects not only temperature, but also vegetation. In fact, altitude is one of the most important influences on vegetation patterns in Colombia. The mountainous parts of the country can be divided into several vegetation zones according to altitude, although the altitude limits of each zone may vary somewhat depending on the latitude.

The &quot;tierra caliente&quot; (hot land), below {{convert|3300|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, is the zone of tropical crops such as bananas. The tierra templada (temperate land), extending from an altitude of {{convert|3300|to|6600|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, is the zone of coffee and maize. Wheat and potatoes dominate in the &quot;tierra fría&quot; (cold land), at altitudes from {{convert|6600|to|10500|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. In the &quot;zona forestada&quot; (forested zone), which is located between {{convert|10500|and|12800|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, many of the trees have been cut for firewood. Treeless pastures dominate the páramos, or alpine grasslands, at altitudes of {{convert|12800|to|15100|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. Above {{convert|15100|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, where temperatures are below freezing, is the &quot;tierra helada&quot;, a zone of permanent snow and ice.

Vegetation also responds to rainfall patterns. A scrub woodland of scattered trees and bushes dominates the semiarid northeast. To the south, savannah (tropical grassland) vegetation covers the Colombian portion of the llanos. The rainy areas in the southeast are blanketed by tropical rainforest. In the mountains, the spotty patterns of precipitation in alpine areas complicate vegetation patterns. The rainy side of a mountain may be lush and green, while the other side, in the rain shadow, may be parched.

==Relief==
[[Image:Colombia Mapa Relieve.svg|thumb|right|250px|Relief map of Colombia]]

The Andean range is located in Colombia from the southwest (Ecuador border) toward the northeast (Venezuela border) and is divided in the [[Colombian Massif]] (Macizo Colombiano) in three ranges (East Range, Centre Range and West Range) that form two long valleys, [[Magdalena]] and [[Cauca]] follow by the rivers of the same name.

The eastern half of Colombia, comprising more than half its territory, is plain and composed by [[savanna]] and [[rainforest]], crossed by rivers belonging to the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and [[Orinoco]] basins.  The northern part, called &quot;Los [[Llanos]]&quot; is a savanna region, mostly in the Orinoco basin (therefore called also Orinoquía).  The southern part is covered by the Amazon rain forest and belongs mostly to the Amazon basin.  It is usually called Amazonía.

At the north and west of the Andes range there are some coastal plains.  The Caribbean plains at the north and the Pacific plains at the west.

Colombian Pacific Plains are among the most rainy parts in the world, chieftly at the north ([[Department of Chocó|Chocó]]).

The highest mountain in Colombia is not in the Andes but in the Caribbean plain: [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] with its highest points named Pico Cristobal Colon (5775 m) and Pico Simon Bolivar (same elevation).  Other mountains in the Caribbean plain include the María Mountains and the [[Serranía de San Lucas]].

In the Pacific Plains there are other mountain formations, chiefly the [[Darién]] and the [[Baudó Mountains|Baudó Ranges]].

In the eastern Region, there is the Macarena Range and there are formations belonging to the [[Guyana Shield]].

==Natural resources==
{{main|Natural resources of Colombia}}

The natural resources of Colombia are varied and extensive with most of its territory and oceans still unexplored. Colombia has one of the largest coal open mine pits in the world in the region of [[Cerrejon]] in the [[Guajira Peninsula]]. It also has oil rigs and natural gas extraction in the eastern plains. Colombia is the main producer of [[emerald]]s and an important participant in gold, silver, iron, salt, platinum and uranium extraction.&lt;ref name=ENCARTA&gt;[http://es.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564636_2/Colombia.html Encyclopedia Encarta: Natural Resources of Colombia] Encyclopedia Encarta Accessed 24 August 2007.

==Environmental issues==
{{Main article|Environmental issues in Colombia}}

[[Image:Colombia land 1970.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Land use map of Colombia, 1970.]]
[[Image:Colombia econ 1970.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Economic activity map of Colombia, 1970.]]

The main environmental issues affecting Colombia are deforestation; soil and water quality damage from overuse of pesticides; air pollution, especially in Bogota, from vehicle emissions and other main cities. The collateral damaged produced by attacks against oil pipeline infrastructure by rebel guerrillas in the Colombian armed conflict has produced long term damage to the environment. The armed groups also deforest large areas to cultivate illegal crops and open unauthorized highways in protected areas.

==Extreme points==
;Highest points:

Snowfields and glaciers in Colombia are limited to the highest peaks and ranges in the Cordillera Central and Cordillera Oriental and above the 4,700-meter elevation on the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. The total area of snowfields and glaciers was estimated to be about 104 square kilometers in the early 1970s.

Historical, geographical, and pictorial records point toward a consistent and progressive depletion of ice-and-snow masses in the Colombian Andes since the end of the &quot;Little Ice Age&quot; in the late 1800s. Many glaciers have disappeared during the 20th century, and others are expected to disappear in the coming decades.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/prof/p1386i/colombia/intro.html USGS: Glaciers of Colombia] USGS Accessed 23 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Colombia}}

The '''Politics of Colombia''' take place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Colombia]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a  [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the two chambers of [[Congress of Colombia|congress]], the [[Senate of Colombia]] and the [[House of Representatives of Colombia]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

==Constitutional Reforms==
[[Colombia]]'s present [[constitution]], enacted on July 5, 1991, strengthened the administration of justice with the provision for introduction of an [[adversarial system]] which ultimately is to entirely replace the existing [[Napoleonic Code]]. Other [http://hup.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/jpla/article/view/40/40 significant reforms] under the new constitution provide for civil divorce, dual nationality, the election of a vice president, and the election of departmental governors. The constitution expanded citizens' basic rights, including that of &quot;tutela,&quot; under which an immediate court action can be requested by an individual if he or she feels that their constitutional rights are being violated and if there is no other [[legal recourse]].

The national government has separate executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

==Executive branch==
{{See also|President of Colombia}}
The president is elected for a four-year term and, since 2005, can be re-elected for one consecutive term. The [[1991]] constitution reestablished the position of [[Vice President of Colombia|vice president]], who is elected on the same ticket as the president. By law, the vice president will succeed in the event of the president's resignation, illness, or death.

==Legislative branch==
{{See also|Congress of Colombia}}
Colombia's bicameral Congress consists of a 102-member [[Senate of Colombia]] and a 161-member [[Chamber of Representatives of Colombia]]. Senators are elected on the basis of a nationwide ballot, while representatives are elected in multimember districts co-located within the 32 national departments. The country's capital is a separate capital district and elects its own representatives. Members may be re-elected indefinitely, and, in contrast to the previous system, there are no alternate congressmen. Congress meets twice a year, and the president has the power to call it into special session when needed.

==Political parties and elections==
{{elect|List of political parties in Colombia|Elections in Colombia}}
{{Colombian presidential election, 2006}}
{{Colombian Chamber of Representatives election, 2006}}
{{Colombian Senate election, 2006}}

==Judicial branch==
The civilian judiciary is a separate and independent branch of government. Guidelines and the general structure for Colombia's administration of justice are set out in Law 270 of March 7, 1996. Colombia's legal system has recently begun to incorporate some elements of an oral, accusatorial system. The judicial branch's general structure is composed of four distinct jurisdictions (civilian, administrative, constitutional, and special). Colombia's highest judicial organs include the Supreme Court, the Council of State, the Constitutional Court, and the Superior Judicial Council. This sometimes leads to conflicting opinions since there is no one court which clearly has authority over the decisions of the other three.

[[Colombia]] has a [[free market economy]] with major commercial and investment ties to the [[United States]]. Transition from a highly regulated economy has been underway for more than a decade{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}.

In 1990, the administration of President [[César Gaviria Trujillo]] (1990–94) initiated [[economic liberalism]] policies or &quot;apertura economica&quot; and this has continued since then, with tariff reductions, financial deregulation, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and adoption of a more liberal foreign exchange rate. Almost all sectors became open to foreign investment although agricultural products remained protected.

The original idea of his then [[Minister of Finance]], [[Rudolf Hommes]], was that the country should import agricultural products in which it was not competitive, like [[maize]], [[wheat]], [[cotton]] and [[soybeans]] and export the ones in which it had an advantage, like [[fruits]] and [[flowers]]. In ten years, the sector lost 7,000&amp;nbsp;km² to imports, represented mostly in heavily [[agricultural subsidies|subsidized agricultural products]] from the [[United States]], as a result of this [[policy]], with a critical impact on employment in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usip.org/library/pa/colombia/adddoc/plan_colombia_101999.html#approach Plan Colombia: Colombia: Peace Agreements: Library and Links: U.S. Institute of Peace&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Still, this policy makes food cheaper for the average Colombian than it would be if agricultural trade were more restricted.

Until 1997, Colombia had enjoyed a fairly stable economy. The first 5 years of liberalization were characterized by high economic growth rates of between 4% and 5%. The [[Ernesto Samper|Samper]] administration (1994–98) emphasized social welfare policies which targeted Colombia's lower income population. However, these reforms led to higher government spending which increased the fiscal deficit and public sector debt, the financing of which required higher interest rates. An over-valued peso inherited from the previous administration was maintained.

The economy slowed, and by 1998 GDP growth was only 0.6%. In 1999, the country fell into its first recession since the [[Great Depression]]. The economy shrank by 4.5% with unemployment at over 20%. While unemployment remained at 20% in 2000, GDP growth recovered to 3.1%.

The administration of President [[Andrés Pastrana Arango]], when it took office on August 7, 1998, faced an economy in crisis, with the difficult internal security situation and global economic turbulence additionally inhibiting confidence. As evidence of a serious recession became clear in 1999, the government took a number of steps. It engaged in a series of controlled devaluations of the peso, followed by a decision to let it float. Colombia also entered into an agreement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] which provided a $2.7 billion guarantee (extended funds facility), while committing the government to budget discipline and structural reforms.

By early 2000 there had been the beginning of an economic recovery, with the export sector leading the way, as it enjoyed the benefit of the more competitive exchange rate, as well as strong prices for [[petroleum]], Colombia's leading export product. Prices of [[coffee]], the other principal export product, have been more variable.

Economic growth reached 3.1 % during 2000 and inflation was 9.0% although unemployment has yet to significantly improve. Colombia's international reserves have remained stable at around $8.35 billion, and Colombia has successfully remained in international capital markets. Colombia's total foreign debt at the end of 1999 was $34.5 billion with $14.7 billion in private sector and $19.8 billion in public sector debt. Major international [[credit rating]] organizations have dropped Colombian [[sovereign debt]] below investment grade, primarily as a result of large fiscal deficits, which current policies are seeking to close.

Several international financial institutions have praised the economic reforms introduced by former president [[Álvaro Uribe]] (elected August 7, 2002), which include measures designed to reduce the public-sector deficit below 2.5% of GDP in 2004. The government's economic policy and [[democratic security]] strategy have engendered a growing sense of confidence in the economy, particularly within the business sector, and GDP growth in 2003 was among the highest in [[Latin America]], at over 4%. By 2007, GDP grew over 8%.

'''Economy - overview:'''   
Colombia's economy has experienced positive growth over the past three years despite a serious armed conflict. The economy continues to improve in part because of austere government budgets, focused efforts to reduce public debt levels, an export-oriented growth strategy, an improved security situation in the country, and high commodity prices. Ongoing economic problems facing President Uribe range from reforming the pension system to reducing high unemployment, and to achieving congressional passage of a fiscal transfers reform. New exploration is needed to offset declining [[oil production]]. International and domestic financial analysts note with concern the growing central government deficit, which hovers at 5% of GDP. However, the government's economic policy and democratic security strategy have engendered a growing sense of confidence in the economy, particularly within the business sector.

==Mining and energy==
Colombia is well-endowed with [[mineral]]s and energy resources. It has the largest [[coal]] reserves in Latin America, and is second to [[Brazil]] in [[hydroelectric]] potential. Estimates of [[petroleum]] reserves in 1995 were {{convert|3.1|Goilbbl|m3}}. It also possesses significant amounts of [[nickel]], [[gold]], [[silver]], [[platinum]], and [[emeralds]].

The discovery of {{convert|2|Goilbbl|m3}} of high-quality oil at the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields, about {{convert|200|km|mi}} east of [[Bogotá]], has enabled Colombia to become a net oil exporter since 1986. The [[Transandino pipeline]] transports oil from [[Orito]] in the [[Department of Putumayo]] to the Pacific port of [[Tumaco]] in the [[Department of Nariño]].&lt;ref name=unco&gt;
{{cite news|publisher=UNCO United Refineries|url=http://www.uncounitedrefineries.com/content/bostproject2.php|title=BOST project|accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total crude oil production averages {{convert|620|koilbbl/d|m3/d}}; about {{convert|184|koilbbl/d|m3/d}} is exported. The [[Andrés Pastrana|Pastrana]] government has significantly liberalized its petroleum investment policies, leading to an increase in exploration activity. Refining capacity cannot satisfy domestic demand, so some refined products, especially [[gasoline]], must be imported. Plans for the construction of a new refinery are under development.
 
While Colombia has vast hydroelectric potential, a prolonged drought in 1992 forced severe electricity rationing throughout the country until mid-1993. The consequences of the drought on electricity-generating capacity caused the government to commission the construction or upgrading of 10 [[thermoelectric]] power plants. Half will be coal-fired, and half will be fired by [[natural gas]]. The government also has begun awarding bids for the construction of a natural gas pipeline system that will extend from the country's extensive gas fields to its major population centers. Plans call for this project to make natural gas available to millions of Colombian households by the middle of the next decade.

As of 2004, Colombia has become a net energy exporter, exporting electricity to [[Ecuador]] and developing connections to [[Peru]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Panama]] to export to those markets as well. The [[Trans-Caribbean pipeline]] connecting western Venezuela to Panama through Colombia is also under construction, thanks to cooperation between presidents [[Álvaro Uribe]] of Colombia, [[Martín Torrijos]] of Panama and [[Hugo Chávez]] of Venezuela. The pipeline will be inaugurated by October 2007.

===Human Rights Abuse in Mining Zones===
The oil pipelines are a frequent target of extortion and bombing campaigns by the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] and, more recently, the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The bombings, which have occurred on average once every 5 days, have caused substantial environmental damage, often in fragile [[rain forests]] and jungles, as well as causing significant loss of life.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} In April 1999 in Cartagena de Indias, Clinton's Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson spoke before investors from the United States, Canada and other countries. He expressed his government's willingness to use military aid to support the investment that they and their allies were going to make in Colombia, especially in strategically important sectors like mining and energy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In 2002 there were 170 attacks on the 2nd largest pipeline, which travels 780&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Caño Limón]] to the Atlantic port of Coveñas. The pipeline was out of operation for 266 days of that year.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The government estimates that these bombings reduced the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of Colombia by 0.5%{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. The government of the [[United States]] increased military aid, in 2003, to Colombia to assist in the effort to defend the pipeline.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} [[Occidental Petroleum]] privately contracted mercenaries who flew [[Skymaster]] planes{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, from [[AirScan]] International Inc.,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} to patrol the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline. Many of these operations used helicopters, equipment and weapons provided by the U.S. military and anti-narcotics aid programs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Mining and Natural Exploitation has had environmental consequences. The region of Guajira is undergoing an accelerated desertification with the disappearances of forests, land, and water sources, due to the increase in coal production.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Social Consequences or lack of development in resource rich areas is common. 11 million Colombians survive on less than one dollar a day. Over 65% of these live in mining zones. There are 3.5 million children out of school, and the most critical situation is in the mining zone of Choco, Bolivar, and Sucre.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Economic consequences of privatization and liberal institutions have meant changes in taxation to attract foreign investment. Colombia will lose another $800 million over the next ninety years that [[Glencore International]] operates in El [[Cerrejon]] Zona Media, if the company continues to produce coal at a rate of 5 million tons/year, because of the reduction of the royalty tax from 10-15% to .04%.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} If the company, as is plausible, doubles or triples its production, the losses will be proportionally greater{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. The operational losses from the three large mining projects ([[El Cerrejon]], [[La Loma]], operated by Drummond, and [[Montelíbano]], which produces [[ferronickel]]) for Colombia to more than 12 billion. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Coal production has grown rapidly, from 22.7 million tons in 1994 to 50.0 million tons in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Unidad de Planeación Minero Energética - UPME (2004), ''Boletín Estadístico de Minas y Energía 1994 - 2004''. [http://www.upme.gov.co/Docs/Boletin_Esta_Minas_Energia.pdf PDF file in Spanish].&lt;/ref&gt; Over 90% of this amount was exported, making Colombia the world's sixth largest coal exporter, behind [[Australia]], the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Indonesia]], [[South Africa]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;World Coal Institute (2004), ''Coal Facts - 2004 Edition''. [http://www.worldcoal.org/assets_cm/files/PDF/coal_facts_2004.pdf PDF file].&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-1980s the center of coal production was the [[Cerrejón]] mines in the [[Guajira Department|Guajira]] department{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. However, the growth in output at [[La Loma, Cesar|La Loma]] in neighboring [[Cesar Department|Cesar]] mean that this department has been the leader in coal production since 2004.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Production in other departments, including [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]], [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] and [[Norte de Santander]], forms about 13% of the total{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. The coal industry is largely controlled by international mining companies, including a consortium of [[BHP Billiton]], [[Anglo American plc|Anglo American]] and [[Glencore International]] at Cerrejón, and [[Drummond Company]] at La Loma, which is undergoing a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Alabama for union assassinations and alleged paramilitary links{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}.

==Foreign Investment==
In 1990, to attract foreign investors and promote trade, an experiment from the [[IMF]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} known as &quot;la apertura&quot; was adopted by the government as an open trade strategy. Although the analysis of the results are not clear{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, the fact is that the agricultural sector was severely impacted by this policy{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}.

In 1991 and 1992, the government passed laws to stimulate foreign investment in nearly all sectors of the economy. The only activities closed to foreign direct investment are defense and national security, disposal of hazardous wastes, and real estate—the last of these restrictions is intended to hinder money laundering. Colombia established a special entity—CoInvertir—to assist foreigners in making investments in the country. Foreign investment flows for 1999 were $4.4 billion, down from $4.8 billion in 1998.

Major foreign investment projects underway include the $6 billion development of the Cusiana and Cupiagua oil fields, development of coal fields in the north of the country, and the recently concluded licensing for establishment of cellular telephone service. The United States accounted for 26.5% of the total $19.4 billion stock of nonpetroleum foreign direct investment in Colombia at the end of 1998.

On October 21, 1995, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), President Clinton signed an Executive Order barring U.S. entities from any commercial or financial transactions with four Colombian drug kingpins and with individuals and companies associated with the traffic in narcotics, as designated by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. The list of designated individuals and companies is amendeded periodically and is maintained by the Office of Foreign Asset Control at the Department of the Treasury, tel. (202) 622-0077 (ask for Document #1900). The document also is available at [http://www.ustreas.gov the Department of Treasury web site].

Colombia is the United States' fifth-largest export market in Latin America—behind Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina—and the 26th-largest market for U.S. products worldwide. The United States is Colombia's principal trading partner, with two-way trade from November 1999 through November 2000 exceeding $9.5 billion--$3.5 billion U.S. exports and $6.0 billion U.S. imports. Colombia benefits from duty-free entry—for a 10-year period, through 2001—for certain of its exports to the United States under the Andean Trade Preferences Act. Colombia improved protection of intellectual property rights through the adoption of three Andean Pact decisions in 1993 and 1994, but the U.S. remains concerned over deficiencies in licensing, patent regulations, and copyright protection.

The petroleum and natural gas coal mining, chemical, and manufacturing industries attract the greatest U.S. investment interest. U.S. investment accounted for 37.8% ($4.2 billion) of the total $11.2 billion in foreign direct investment at the end of 1997, excluding petroleum and portfolio investment. Worker rights and benefits in the U.S.-dominated sectors are more favorable than general working conditions. Examples include shorter-than-average working hours, higher wages, and compliance with health and safety standards above the national average.

'''Industry and Agriculture'''&lt;br&gt;
The most industrially diverse member of the five-nation Andean Community, Colombia has four major industrial centers—Bogota, Medellin, Cali, and Barranquilla, each located in a distinct geographical region. Colombia's industries include textiles and clothing, particularly lingerie, leather products, processed foods and beverages, paper and paper products, chemicals and petrochemicals, cement, construction, iron and steel products, and metalworking. Its diverse climate and topography permit the cultivation of a wide variety of crops. In addition, all regions yield forest products, ranging from tropical hardwoods in the hot country to pine and eucalyptus in the colder areas.

[[Cacao bean]]s, [[sugarcane]], [[coconut]]s, [[banana]]s, [[plantain]]s, [[rice]], [[cotton]], [[tobacco]], [[cassava]], and most of the nation's beef cattle are produced in the hot regions from sea level to 1,000 meters elevation. The temperate regions—between 1,000 and 2,000 meters—are better suited for [[coffee]]; certain flowers; [[maize]] and other vegetables; and fruits such as [[citrus]], [[pear]]s, [[pineapple]]s, and [[tomato]]es. The cooler elevations—between 2,000 and 3,000 meter—produce [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[potato]]es, cold-climate vegetables, flowers, [[dairy]] cattle, and [[poultry]].

The sector has had the second largest (after energy) investment in infrastructure (54 percent) since 1997. However, the [[Economy of Colombia|economic downturn between 1999 and 2002]] adversely affected telecommunications. During this period, Colombia’s telecommunications industry lost US$2 billion despite a profit of US$1 billion in local service. In June 2003, the government [[liquidation|liquidated]] the state-owned and heavily indebted National Telecommunications Company (Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones—Telecom) and replaced it with Colombia Telecomunicaciones (Colombia Telecom). The measure enabled the industry to expand rapidly, and in 2004 it constituted 2.8 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). [[Telefónica]] of Spain acquired a 50 percent share in the company in 2006.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Colombia.pdf Colombia country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (February 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of increasing competition, Colombia has a relatively modern telecommunications infrastructure that primarily serves larger towns and cities. Colombia’s telecommunication system includes [[INTELSAT]], 11 domestic satellite [[Earth station]]s, and a nationwide [[microwave radio relay]] system.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

==Telephones==
The country’s teledensity (the density of telephone lines in a community) is relatively high for [[Latin America]] (17 percent in 2006). However, there is a steep imbalance between rural and urban areas, with some regions below 10 percent and the big cities exceeding 30 percent. [[Bogotá]], [[Medellín]], and [[Cali]] account for about 50 percent of telephone lines in use. By the end of 2005, the number of telephone main lines in use totaled 7,851,649. Colombia Telecom accounted for only about 31 percent of these lines; 27 other operators accounted for the rest.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

Colombia’s [[mobile telephone|mobile]] market is one of the fastest-growing businesses in the country. In mid-2004 mobile telephones overtook fixed lines in service for the first time. By 2005 Colombia had the highest mobile phone density (90 percent) in Latin America, as compared with the region’s average density of 70 percent. The number of mobile telephone subscribers totaled an estimated 31 million in 2007, as compared to 21.8 million in 2005 and 6.8 million in 2001.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

==Radio and television==
{{see also|Media of Colombia}}
In late 2004, [[Radio Televisión Nacional de Colombia]] (RTVC) replaced the liquidated [[Instituto Nacional de Radio y Televisión]] (Inravisión) as the government-run radio and television broadcasting service, which oversees three national television stations and five radio companies (which operate about a dozen principal networks). Colombia has about 60 television stations, including seven low-power stations. In 2000 the population had about 11.9 million television receivers in use. Of the approximately 515 radio stations, 454 are [[AM broadcasting|AM]]; 34, [[FM broadcasting|FM]]; and 27, [[shortwave]].&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

==Internet==
{{main|Internet in Colombia}}
Colombia is still far behind [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], and [[Argentina]] in terms of online usage. It had an estimated total of 900,000 [[Internet]] subscribers by the end of 2005, a figure that equated to 4,739,000 Internet users, or 11.5 percent of the 2005 population (10.9 per 100 inhabitants). By late 2009 39% of households had internet access Colombia had 581,877 [[Internet host]]s in 2006. Although as many as 70 percent of Colombians accessed the Internet over their ordinary telephone lines, dial-up access is losing ground to [[Broadband Internet access|broadband]]. In 2005 Colombia had 345,000 broadband subscriber lines, or one per 100 inhabitants. In 2006 the number of [[personal computer]]s per 1,000 people increased to an estimated 87 per 1,000 inhabitants, a rate still below that in other large Latin American economies.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;  The internet country code is [[.co]].

==Addresses==
{{Disputed|date=March 2008}}
{{off-topic|date=March 2011}}
Colombia uses a unique system of addressing in order to combat the need for [[postal codes]]. In every city (with the notable exception of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena de Indias]]), streets are numbered. North-south streets are called ''calle'', while east-west streets are called ''carrerra''. South-west to north-east streets are called ''diagonal'', while south-east to north-west streets are called ''transversal''. It is fair to say that ''calles'' and ''carrerras'' do not always line up in a grid pattern.

House numbers are another matter. Rather than simply numbering the houses from 1 onwards, they are numbered by the first &quot;crossing&quot; street, and then the number of meters away from that street the front door is. This goes on until there is another &quot;crossing&quot; street, at which point the houses on the next block go up in number.

As an example, a typical house number in [[Bogotá]] could be: Calle 52 N° 42-18, Bogotá. This would indicate that the particular house in question is on Calle 52, approximately 18 meters in from Carrerra 42. To further the example, if the block closest to Carrerra 42 was only 100 meters long, the closest house to the next &quot;crossing&quot; street, Carrerra 43, could be numbered N° 43-05. Sometimes letters are added to the street numbers to differentiate actual streets from alleys or dead ends.

Accuracy isn't the focus of the design of the addresses, therefore, numbers simply alternate on opposite sides of the street.

'''[[Transport]] in [[Colombia]]''' is regulated by the [[Ministry of Transport (Colombia)|Ministry of Transport]].

Road travel is the main means of transport; almost 70 percent of cargo is transported by road, as compared with 27 percent by railroad, 3 percent by internal waterways, and 1 percent by air. Nevertheless, Colombia has one of the lowest ratios of paved roads per inhabitant in Latin America. The country has well-developed air and waterway routes. The only means of transportation in 60 percent of the country is via waterways, but guerrilla groups control the waterways in the south and southeast.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Colombia.pdf Colombia country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (February 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Indigenous peoples influence===
[[Image:Muisca raft Legend of El Dorado Offerings of gold.jpg|thumb|right|[[Muisca]] culture golden raft.]]

The [[indigenous peoples in Colombia]] used and some continue to use the water ways as the way of transportation using [[raft]]s and canoes.

===Spanish influence===
With the arrival of the Europeans the [[Spanish people|Spaniards brought]] the [[horse]]s, mules and donkey (which developed into the ''[[Paso Fino]]'') used by them in [[ranching]] duties later in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. Horses contributed greatly to the transport of the Spanish conquerors and colonizers. They also introduced the wheel, and brought wooden carts and carriages to facilitate their transport. The Spaniards also developed the first roads, rudimentary and most of these in the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean region]]. Due to the rough [[Geography of Colombia|terrain of Colombia]] communications between regions was difficult and affected the effectiveness of the central government creating isolation in some regions. Maritime navigation developed locally after Spain lifted its restrictions on ports within the [[Spanish Empire]] inducing mercantilism. Spanish also transported African slaves and forcedly migrated many indigenous tribes throughout Colombia.  

===Post-independence===
With the independence and the influences of the European [[Industrial Revolution]] the main way of transport in Colombia became the navigation mainly through the [[Magdalena River]] which connected the capital city [[Bogotá]] in inland Colombia, with [[Barranquilla]] by the [[Caribbean sea]] to the trade with the United States and Europe. This also brought a large wave of immigrants from European and Middle Eastern countries. The industrialization process and transportation in Colombia were affected by the internal civil wars that surged after the independence from Spain and that continued throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. 

===Standardization===
During the late 19th century European and American companies introduced railways to carry to the ports the local production of raw materials intended for exports and also imports from Europe. [[Steam ships]] began carrying Colombians, immigrants and goods from Europe and the United States over the [[Magdalena River]]. 

[[Image:IMG 0639.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pumarejo bridge]] in [[Barranquilla]]. The bridge serves to cross the [[Magdalena River]] between the [[Departments of Colombia|Departments]] of [[Atlántico Department|Atlántico]] and [[Magdalena Department|Magdalena]]. It is also one of the oldest standing bridges in Colombia.]]

The Ministry of Transport was created in 1905 during the Presidency of [[Rafael Reyes]] under the name of '' Ministerio de Obras Públicas y Transporte'' or Ministry of Public Works and Transport with the main function of taking care of national assets issues, including mines, oil (fuel), patents and trade marks, railways, roads, bridges, national buildings and land without landowners.

In the early 20th century roads and highways maintenance and construction regulations were established. Rivers were cleaned, dragged and channeled and the navigational industry was organized. The Public works districts were created, as well as the [[Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Colombia]] (National Railways of Colombia). Among other major projects developed were the aqueduct of [[Bogotá]], La Regadera Dam and the Vitelma Water Treatment Plant. The Ministry also created the [[National Institute of Transit]] (from the Spanish ''Instituto Nacional de Tránsito''), (INTRA) under the Transport and tariffs Directorate and was in charge of designing the first National roads plan with the support of many foreign multinational construction companies.

Aviation was born in [[Barranquilla]] with the creation of [[SCADTA]] in 1919 a joint venture between Colombians and Germans that delivered mail to the main cities of Colombia which later merged with [[SACO]] to form [[Avianca]].

==Infrastructure==
===Railways===
{{main|Rail transport in Colombia}}
[[File:Colombia Mapa Ferrocarriles.svg|thumb|200px|Railroads of Colombia]]

Colombia has 3,034 kilometers (1,885 miles) of rail lines, 150 kilometers (93 miles) of which are {{RailGauge|1435}} gauge and 3,154 kilometers (1,960 miles) of which are {{RailGauge|914}} gauge. However, only 2,611 kilometers (1,622 miles) of lines are still in use. Rail transport in Colombia remains underdeveloped. The national railroad system, once the country's main mode of transport for freight, has been neglected in favor of road development and now accounts for only about a quarter of freight transport. Passenger-rail use was suspended in 1992 and resumed at the end of the 1990s. However, fewer than 165,000 passenger journeys were made in 1999, as compared with more than 5 million in 1972, and the figure was only 160,130 in 2005. Short sections of railroad, mainly the Bogotá-Atlantic rim, are used to haul goods, mostly coal, to the Caribbean and Pacific ports. In 2005 a total of 27.5 million metric tons of cargo were transported by rail. Although the nation's rail network links seven of the country's 10 major cities, very little of it has been used regularly because of security concerns, lack of maintenance, and the power of the road transport union. During 2004–6, approximately 2,000 kilometers of the country's rail lines underwent refurbishment. This upgrade involved two main projects: the 1,484-kilometer line linking Bogotá to the Caribbean Coast and the 499-kilometer Pacific coastal network that links the industrial city of [[Cali]] and the surrounding [[Colombian Coffee-Growers Axis|coffee-growing region]] to the port of [[Buenaventura]].&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

===Roads===
[[File:Colombia Mapa Vial.svg|thumb|200px|Main roads in Colombia]]

The three main north-south highways are the Caribbean, Eastern, and Central Trunk Highways (troncales). Estimates of the length of Colombia's road system in 2004 ranged from 115,000 kilometers to 145,000 kilometers, of which fewer than 15 percent were paved. However, according to 2005 data reported by the Colombian government, the road network totaled 163,000 kilometers, 68 percent of which were paved and in good condition. The increase may reflect some newly built roads. President Uribe has vowed to pave more than 2,500 kilometers of roads during his administration, and about 5,000 kilometers of new secondary roads were being built in the 2003–6 period. Despite serious terrain obstacles, almost three-quarters of all cross-border dry cargo is now transported by road, 105,251 metric tons in 2005.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

Highways are managed by the [[Ministry of Transport (Colombia)|Colombian Ministry of Transport]] through the [[National Roads Institute]]. The security of the highways in Colombia is managed by the [[Highway Police (Colombia)|Highway Police]] unit of the [[Colombian National Police]]. Colombia is crossed by the [[Panamerican Highway]].

===Ports, waterways, and merchant marine===
[[File:Colombia Mapa Ríos.svg|thumb|200px|Rivers of Colombia]]

Seaports handle around 80 percent of international cargo. In 2005 a total of 105,251 metric tons of cargo were transported by water. Colombia's most important ocean terminals are Barranquilla, Cartagena, and Santa Marta on the Caribbean Coast and Buenaventura and Tumaco on the Pacific Coast. Exports mostly pass through the Caribbean ports of Cartagena and Santa Marta, while 65 percent of imports arrive at the port of Buenaventura. Other important ports and harbors are Bahía de Portete, Leticia, Puerto Bolívar, San Andrés, Santa Marta, and Turbo. Since privatization was implemented in 1993, the efficiency of port handling has increased greatly. There are plans to construct a deep-water port at Bahía Solano.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

The main inland waterways total about 18,200 kilometers, 11,000 kilometers of which are navigable by riverboats. A well-developed and important form of transport for both cargo and passengers, inland waterways transport approximately 3.8 million metric tons of freight and more than 5.5 million passengers annually. Main inland waterways are the Magdalena–Cauca River system, which is navigable for 1,500 kilometers; the Atrato, which is navigable for 687 kilometers; the Orinoco system of more than five navigable rivers, which total more than 4,000 kilometers of potential navigation (mainly through Venezuela); and the Amazonas system, which has four main rivers totaling 3,000 navigable kilometers (mainly through Brazil). The government is planning an ambitious program to more fully utilize the main rivers for transport. In addition, the navy's riverine brigade has been patrolling waterways more aggressively in order to establish safer river transport in the more remote areas in the south and east of the country that are controlled by rebel groups.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

The merchant marine totals 17 ships (1,000 gross registered tons or more), including four bulk, 13 cargo, one container, one liquefied gas, and three petroleum tanker ships. Colombia also has seven ships registered in other countries (Antigua and Barbuda, two; Panama, five).&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

===Aviation===
{{seealso|List of airports in Colombia}}
[[Image:Avianca 767-200 at El Dorado.JPG|right|thumb|[[Avianca]] [[Boeing 767-200ER]] parked at the El Dorado Terminal]]

All public airports in Colombia are managed and controlled by the [[Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics]]. The customs/immigration issues are controlled by the [[Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad]] (DAS).

Colombia has well-developed air routes and an estimated total of 984 airports, 100 of which have paved runways, plus two heliports. Of the 74 main airports, 20 can accommodate jet aircraft. Two airports are more than 3,047 meters in length, nine are 2,438–3,047 meters, 39 are 1,524–2,437 meters, 38 are 914–1,523 meters, 12 are shorter than 914 meters, and 880 have unpaved runways. The government has been selling its stake in local airports in order to allow their privatization. The country has 40 regional airports, and the cities of Bogotá, Medellín, Cali, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cartagena, Cucutá, Letícia, Pereira, San Andrés, and Santa Marta have international airports. Bogotá's El Dorado International Airport handles 350 million metric tons of cargo and 8 million passengers a year, making it the largest airport in Latin America in terms of cargo and the third largest in passenger numbers.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

===Urban transport===

Urban transport systems have been developed in Bogotá and Medellín. Traffic congestion in Bogotá has been greatly exacerbated by the lack of rail transport. However, this problem has been alleviated somewhat by the development of the [[TransMilenio]] Bus Rapid System and the restriction of vehicles through a daily, [[Pico y placa| rotating ban]] on private cars depending on plate numbers. Bogotá's system consists of bus and minibus services managed by both private- and public-sector enterprises. Since 1995 Medellín has had a modern urban railway referred to as the [[Metro de Medellín]], which also connects with the cities of Itagüí, Envigado, and Bello. An elevated cable car system, [[Metrocable (Medellin)| Metrocable]], was added in 2004 to link some of Medellín's poorer mountainous neighborhoods with the Metro de Medellín. A bus rapid-transit system called Transmetro, similar to Bogotá's TransMilenio, will begin operating in Barranquilla by late 2007. Cali's streets remain under construction as a new public-transit system called the Massive Integration of the West is being built.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

===Pipelines===
Colombia has 4,350 kilometers of gas pipelines, 6,134 kilometers of oil pipelines, and 3,140 kilometers of refined-products pipelines. The country has five major oil pipelines, four of which connect with the Caribbean export terminal at Puerto Coveñas. Until at least September 2005, the United States funded efforts to help protect a major pipeline, the 769-kilometer-long Caño Limón–Puerto Coveñas pipeline, which carries about 20 percent of Colombia's oil production to Puerto Coveñas from the guerrilla-infested Arauca region in the eastern Andean foothills and Amazonian jungle. The number of attacks against pipelines began declining substantially in 2002. In 2004 there were only 17 attacks against the Caño Limón–Puerto Coveñas pipeline, down from 170 in 2001. However, a bombing in February 2005 shut the pipeline for several weeks, and attacks against the electrical gird system that provides energy to the Caño Limón oilfield have continued. New oil pipeline projects with Brazil and Venezuela are underway. In addition, the already strong cross-border trade links between Colombia and Venezuela were solidified in July 2004 with an agreement to build a US$320 million natural gas pipeline between the two countries, to be completed in 2008.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

The '''Military of Colombia''', officially the '''Military Forces of Colombia''' ({{lang-es|Fuerzas Militares de Colombia}}) is the [[armed forces]] of [[Colombia]].

==Services==
The Military of Colombia consists of:
* [[National Army of Colombia]] ''Ejército Nacional de Colombia''
* [[Colombian National Armada]] ''Armada Nacional de Colombia'' (Marines, Navy and Coast Guard attached)
::*[[Colombian Naval Infantry]] ''Infanteria de Marina'' A branch of the Colombian Navy for Amphibious Operations
* [[Colombian Air Force]] ''Fuerza Aérea Colombiana''

===Dependencies===
* Military Medical Corps (''Sanidad Militar''):Medical and Nurse Corps)
* [[Indumil|Military Industry]] (''Industrias Militares'' INDUMIL): Military Industry Depot
* Military Sports Federation (''Federación Deportiva Militar'' FEDECODEMIL)
* Military Printing (''Imprenta Militar'')
* Military Museum (''Museo Militar''): History of the Armed Forces of Colombia
* War Superior College (''Escuela Superior de Guerra'' ESDEGUE)

==Funding==
In 1999, Colombia assigned 3.6% of its GDP to defense, according to the National Planning Department. By 2007 this figure had risen to 6.1% of GDP, one of the highest rates in the world. The armed forces number about 250,000 uniformed personnel: 145,000 military and 105,000 police. These figures do not include assistance personnel such as cooks, medics, mechanics, and so on. This makes the Colombian military one of the largest and most well-equipped in Latin America. Many Colombian military personnel have received military training assistance directly in Colombia and also in the United States. The United States has provided equipment and financing to the Colombian military and police through the military assistance program, foreign military sales, and the international narcotics control program, all currently united under the auspices of [[Plan Colombia]].

==Pre-Colombian period==
{{main|Indigenous peoples in Colombia}}

[[File:Muisca raft Legend of El Dorado Offerings of gold.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Zipa]] used to cover his body in gold and, from his raft, he offered treasures to the ''Guatavita'' goddess in the middle of the sacred lake. This old Muisca tradition became the origin of the [[El Dorado]] legend.]]
[[File:55 - Bogota - Décembre 2008.JPG|thumb|right|A Colombian mummy from the [[Colombian National Museum]] in [[Bogotá]].]]

Approximately 10,000 years BC [[hunter-gatherer]] societies existed near present-day Bogotá (at ''[[El Abra]]'' and ''Tequendama''), and they traded with one another and with cultures living in the [[Magdalena River]] valley. Beginning in the first millennium AD, groups of [[Amerindians]] developed a political system, the ''[[cacicazgo]]'', a pyramidal power structure headed by a [[cacique]]. Within Colombia, the two cultures with the most complex cacicazgo systems were the [[Tayrona]]s in the [[Caribbean Region|Caribbean region]], and the [[Muisca]]s in the highlands near [[Bogotá]], both of which belonged to the [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan]] language family. The Muisca people had one of the most developed political systems in [[South America]], surpassed only by the [[Incas]].

==Colonial times==
{{main|Spanish conquest of the Chibchan Nations}}

The [[Spain|Spanish]] settled along the north coast of today's Colombia as early as the [[1500s decade|1500s]], but their first permanent settlement, at Santa Marta, was not established until 1525. In 1549, the institution of the [[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]] in Santa Fe de [[Bogotá]] gave that city the status of capital of [[New Kingdom of Granada|New Granada]], which comprised in large part what is now territory of Colombia. In 1717 the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] was originally created, and then it was temporarily removed, to finally be reestablished in 1739. The Viceroyalty had Santa Fé de Bogotá as its capital. This Viceroyalty included some other provinces of northwestern South America which had previously been under the jurisdiction of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalties of New Spain]] or [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] and correspond mainly to today's [[Venezuela]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Panama]]. So, [[Bogotá]] became one of the principal administrative centers of the Spanish possessions in the New World, along with [[Lima, Peru|Lima]] and [[Mexico City]], though it remained somewhat backward compared to those two cities in several economicbbb and logistical ways. Colombia's great beaches are also a great aspect of the land there.

==The ''Patria Boba'': The Beginning of the Struggle for Independence==
{{main|Patria Boba}}
The period between 1796 and 1806 was marked by intense conflicts over the nature of the new government or governments. Constant fighting between federalists and centralists gave rise to a period of instability, which came to be known as ''la Patria Boba'' (the Foolish Fatherland). Each province, and even some cities, set up its own autonomous juntas, which declared themselves sovereign from each other.

With the arrival of news in May 1810 that southern Spain had been conquered by Napoleon's forces, that the Spanish [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Supreme Central Junta]] had dissolved itself, declarations of independence in Quito (1809), Gran Colombia (1810), Venezuela and Paraguay (1811) and other territories, established their own governments. [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena de Indias]] established a junta on May 22, 1810, followed others, including the viceregal capital, Bogotá, on July 20 (today Colombia's Independence Day). Although the Bogotá junta called itself a &quot;Supreme Junta of the New Kingdom of Granada,&quot; it failed to provide political unity, and battles broke out between cities and towns as each tried to defend its sovereignty. There were two fruitless attempts at establishing a congress of provinces in the subsequent months.

By March 1811 the province of Bogotá had transformed itself into a state called [[Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca|Cundinamarca]]. Cundinamarca convened a &quot;Congress of the United Provinces,&quot; which first met in Bogotá, but later moved to [[Tunja]] and [[Villa de Leyva|Leyva]] to maintain independence from the capital city. It established a confederation called the [[United Provinces of New Granada]] on November 27, 1811, but Cundinamarca did not recognize the new federation. The dispute over the form of government erupted into civil war by the end of 1812, and once again in 1814. By mid-1815 a large [[Spanish reconquest of New Granada|Spanish expeditionary force]] under [[Pablo Morillo]] had arrived in New Granada. Cartagena fell in December, and by May 1816 the royalists had control of all of New Granada.

==Gran Colombia: Independence Achieved==
{{main|Colombian Declaration of Independence|Gran Colombia}}

[[Image:Puente Boyaca.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Puente de Boyacá|Boyaca bridge]] crucial in the Battle of Boyacá.]]

From then on the long independence struggle, was led mainly by [[Simón Bolívar|Bolívar]] and [[Francisco de Paula Santander]] in neighboring Venezuela. Bolívar returned to New Granada only in 1819 after establishing himself as leader of the pro-independence forces in the Venezuelan ''[[llanos]]''. From there he led an army over the Andes and captured New Granada after a quick campaign that ended at the [[Battle of Boyacá]], on August 7, 1819. (''For more information, see [[Military career of Simón Bolívar]]''.)

That year, the [[Congress of Angostura]] established the Republic of Gran Colombia, which included all territories under jurisdiction of the former Viceroyalty of New Granada. Bolívar was elected first, president of Gran Colombia and Santander, vice president.

As the Federation of Gran Colombia was dissolved in 1830, the Department of Cundinamarca (as established in Angostura) became a new country, the Republic of New Granada.

==The Republic: Liberal and Conservative Conflict==
{{see|La Violencia}}
In 1863 the name of the Republic was changed officially to &quot;United States of Colombia&quot;, and in 1886 the country adopted its present name: &quot;Republic of Colombia&quot;.

Two political parties grew out of conflicts between the followers of Bolívar and Santander and their political visions—the [[Colombian Conservative Party|Conservatives]] and the [[Colombian Liberal Party|Liberals]] &amp;ndash; and have since dominated Colombian politics. Bolívar's supporters, who later formed the nucleus of the Conservative Party, sought strong centralized government, alliance with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and a limited franchise. Santander's followers, forerunners of the Liberals, wanted a decentralized government, state rather than church control over education and other civil matters, and a broadened suffrage.

Throughout the 19th century and early 20th century, each party held the presidency for roughly equal periods of time. Colombia maintained a tradition of civilian government and regular, free elections. The military has seized power three times in Colombia's history: in 1830, after the dissolution of Great Colombia; again in 1854 (by General [[José María Melo]]); and from 1953 to 1957 (under General [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla]]). Civilian rule was restored within one year in the first two instances.

Notwithstanding the country's commitment to democratic institutions, Colombia's history has also been characterized by widespread, violent conflict. Two civil wars resulted from bitter rivalry between the Conservative and Liberal parties. [[Thousand Days War]] (1899–1902) cost an estimated 100,000 lives, and up to 300,000 people died during &quot;[[La Violencia]]&quot; (The Violence) of the late 1940s and 1950s, a bipartisan confrontation which erupted after the assassination of Liberal popular candidate [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]]. [[United States]] activity to influence the area (especially the [[Panama Canal]] construction and control) led to a military uprising in the province of Panama in 1903, which resulted in the establishment of it as a nation.

A military coup in 1953 toppled the right-wing government of Conservative [[Laureano Gómez]] and brought General [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla|Gustavo Rojas]] to power. Initially, Rojas enjoyed considerable popular support, due largely to his success in reducing &quot;[[La Violencia]]&quot;. When he did not restore democratic rule and occasionally engaged in open repression, however, he was overthrown by the military in 1957 with the backing of both political parties, and a provisional government was installed.

==The National Front regime (1958–1974)==
In July 1957, former Conservative President Laureano Gómez (1950–1953) and former Liberal President [[Alberto Lleras Camargo|Alberto Lleras]] (1945–1946, 1958–1962) issued the &quot;Declaration of Sitges,&quot; in which they proposed a &quot;National Front,&quot; whereby the Liberal and Conservative parties would govern jointly. The presidency would be determined by an alternating conservative and liberal president every 4 years for 16 years; the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices.

The National Front ended &quot;[[La Violencia]]&quot;, and National Front administrations attempted to institute far-reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the Alliance for Progress. In the end, the contradictions between each successive Liberal and Conservative administration made the results decidedly mixed. Despite the progress in certain sectors, many social and political injustices continued.

The National Front system itself eventually began to be seen as a form of political repression by dissidents and even many mainstream voters, especially after what was apparently later confirmed as the fraudulent election of [[Colombian Conservative Party|Conservative]] candidate [[Misael Pastrana Borrero|Misael Pastrana]] in 1970, which resulted in the defeat of the relatively populist candidate [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla|Gustavo Rojas]]. The [[19th of April Movement|M-19]] guerrilla movement, &quot;Movimiento 19 de Abril&quot; (19 April Movement), would eventually be founded in part as a response to this particular event.

Although the system established by the Sitges agreement was phased out by 1974, the 1886 Colombian constitution &amp;mdash; in effect until 1991&amp;mdash;required that the losing political party be given adequate and equitable participation in the government which, according to many observers and later analysis, eventually resulted in some increase in corruption and legal relaxation. The current 1991 constitution does not have that requirement, but subsequent administrations have tended to include members of opposition parties.

==Post-National Front years==
From 1974 until 1982, different presidential administrations chose to focus on ending the persistent [[Insurgency|insurgencies]] that sought to undermine Colombia's traditional political system. Both groups claimed to represent the poor and weak against the rich and powerful classes of the country, demanding the completion of true land and political reform, from an openly [[Communist]] perspective.

By 1974, another challenge to the state's authority and legitimacy had come from [[19 April Movement]] (M-19), a mostly urban guerrilla group founded allegedly in response to an electoral fraud during the final National Front election of [[Misael Pastrana Borrero|Misael Pastrana]] (1970–1974) and the defeat of former dictator [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla|Gustavo Rojas]]. Initially, the M-19 attracted a degree of attention and sympathy from mainstream Colombians that the FARC and [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|National Liberation Army (ELN)]] had found largely elusive earlier due to extravagant and daring operations, such as stealing a sword that had belonged to Colombia's Independence hero [[Simon Bolívar]]. At the same time, its larger profile soon made it the focus of the state's counterinsurgency efforts.

The ELN guerrilla had been seriously crippled by military operations in the region of Anorí by 1974, but it managed to reconstitute itself and escape destruction, in part due to the administration of [[Alfonso López Michelsen]] (1974–1978) allowing it to escape encirclement, hoping to initiate a peace process with the group.

By 1982, the perceived passivity of the FARC, together with the relative success of the government's efforts against the M-19 and ELN, enabled the administration of the Liberal Party's [[Julio César Turbay Ayala|Julio César Turbay]] (1978–1982) to lift a state-of-siege decree that had been in effect, on and off, for most of the previous 30 years. Under the latest such decree, president Turbay had implemented security policies that, though of some military value against the M-19 in particular, were considered highly questionable both inside and outside Colombian circles due to numerous accusations of military [[human rights abuse]]s against suspects and captured guerrillas.

Citizen exhaustion due to the conflict's newfound intensity led to the election of president [[Belisario Betancur]] (1982–1986), a Conservative who won 47% of the popular vote, directed peace feelers at all the insurgents, and negotiated a 1984 cease-fire with the FARC and M-19 after a 1982 release of many guerrillas imprisoned during the previous effort to overpower them. The ELN rejected entering any negotiation and continued to recover itself through the use of extortions and threats, in particular against foreign oil companies of European and U.S. origin.

As these events were developing, the growing [[illegal drug trade]] and its consequences were also increasingly becoming a matter of widespread importance to all participants in the Colombian conflict. Guerrillas and newly wealthy drug lords had mutually uneven relations and thus numerous incidents occurred between them. Eventually the kidnapping of drug cartel family members by guerrillas led to the creation of the 1981 ''Muerte a Secuestradores'' (MAS) death squad (&quot;Death to Kidnappers&quot;). Pressure from the U.S. government and critical sectors of Colombian society was met with further violence, as the [[Medellín Cartel]] and its hitmen, bribed or murdered numerous public officials, politicians and others who stood in its way by supporting the implementation of [[extradition]] of Colombian nationals to the U.S. Victims of cartel violence included Justice Minister [[Rodrigo Lara Bonilla|Rodrigo Lara]], assassinated in 1984, an event which made the Betancur administration begin to directly oppose the drug lords.

The first negotiated cease-fire with the M-19 ended when the guerrillas resumed fighting in 1985, claiming that the cease-fire had not been fully respected by official security forces, saying that several of its members had suffered threats and assaults, and also questioning the government's real willingness to implement any accords. The Betancur administration in turn questioned the M-19's actions and its commitment to the peace process, as it continued to advance high profile negotiations with the FARC, which led to the creation of the [[Patriotic Union (Colombia)]] (UP), a legal and non-clandestine political organization.

On November 6, 1985, the M-19 [[Palace of Justice siege|stormed the Colombian Palace of Justice]] and held the Supreme Court magistrates hostage, intending to put president Betancur on trial. In the ensuing crossfire that followed the military's reaction, scores of people lost their lives, as did most of the guerrillas, including several high-ranking operatives. Both sides blamed each other for the outcome.

Meanwhile, individual FARC members initially joined the UP leadership in representation of the guerrilla command, though most of the guerrilla's chiefs and militiamen did not demobilize nor disarm, as that was not a requirement of the process at that point in time. Tension soon significantly increased, as both sides began to accuse each other of not respecting the cease-fire. Political violence against FARC and UP members (including presidential candidate [[Jaime Pardo Leal|Jaime Pardo]]) was blamed on drug lords and also on members of the security forces (to a much lesser degree on the argued inaction of Betancur administration). Members of the government and security authorities increasingly accused the FARC of continuing to recruit guerrillas, as well as kidnapping, extorting and politically intimidating voters even as the UP was already participating in politics.

The [[Virgilio Barco Vargas|Virgilio Barco]] (1986–1990) administration, in addition to continuing to handle the difficulties of the complex negotiations with the guerrillas, also inherited a particularly chaotic confrontation against the drug lords, who were engaged in a campaign of [[terrorism]] and murder in response to government moves in favor of their extradition overseas. The UP also suffered an increasing number of losses during this term (including the assassination of presidential candidate [[Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa|Bernardo Jaramillo]]), which stemmed both from private proto-[[paramilitary]] organizations, increasingly powerful drug lords and a number of would-be paramilitary-sympathizers within the armed forces.

==Post 1990==
Following administrations had to contend with the guerrillas, paramilitaries, narcotics traffickers and the violence and corruption that they all perpetuated, both through force and negotiation. Narcoterrorists assassinated three presidential candidates before [[César Gaviria Trujillo|César Gaviria]] was elected in 1990. Since the death of [[Medellín]] cartel leader [[Pablo Escobar]] in a police shootout during December 1993, indiscriminate acts of violence associated with that organization have abated as the &quot;cartels&quot; have broken up into multiple, smaller and often-competing trafficking organizations. Nevertheless, violence continues as these drug organizations resort to violence as part of their operations but also to protest government policies, including extradition.

The M-19 and several smaller guerrilla groups were successfully incorporated into a peace process as the 1980s ended and the 90s began, which culminated in the elections for a [[Constituent Assembly of Colombia]] that would write a new constitution, which took effect in 1991. The new Constitution, brought about a considerable number of institutional and legal reforms based on principles that the delegates considered as more modern, humanist, democratic and politically open than those in the 1886 constitution. Practical results were mixed and mingled emerged (such as the debate surrounding the constitutional prohibition of extradition, which later was reversed), but together with the reincorporation of some of the guerrilla groups to the legal political framework, the new Constitution inaugurated an era that was both a continuation and a gradual, but significant, departure from what had come before.

Contacts with the FARC, which had irregularly continued despite the generalized [[de facto]] interruptions of the ceasefire and the official 1987 break from negotiations, were temporarily cut off in 1990 under the presidency of [[César Gaviria Trujillo|César Gaviria]] (1990–1994). The Colombian Army's assault on the FARC's ''Casa Verde'' sanctuary at [[La Uribe]], [[Meta Department|Meta]], followed by a FARC offensive that sought to undermine the deliberations of the Constitutional Assembly, began to highlight a significant break in the uneven negotiations carried over from the previous decade.

President [[Ernesto Samper Pizano|Ernesto Samper]] assumed office in August 1994. However, a political crisis relating to large-scale contributions from drug traffickers to Samper's presidential campaign diverted attention from governance programs, thus slowing, and in many cases, halting progress on the nation's domestic reform agenda. The military also suffered several setbacks in its fight against the guerrillas, when several of its rural bases began to be overrun and a record number of soldiers and officers were taken prisoner by the FARC (which since 1982 was attempting to implement a more &quot;conventional&quot; style of warfare, seeking to eventually defeat the military in the field).

On August 7, 1998, [[Andrés Pastrana Arango|Andrés Pastrana]] was sworn in as the President of Colombia. A member of the Conservative Party, Pastrana defeated Liberal Party candidate Horacio Serpa in a run-off election marked by high voter turn-out and little political unrest. The new president's program was based on a commitment to bring about a peaceful resolution of Colombia's longstanding civil conflict and to cooperate fully with the United States to combat the trafficking of illegal drugs.

While early initiatives in the Colombian peace process gave reason for optimism, the Pastrana administration also has had to combat high unemployment and other economic problems, such as the fiscal deficit and the impact of global financial instability on Colombia. During his administration, unemployment has risen to over 20%. Additionally, the growing severity of countrywide guerrilla attacks by the FARC and ELN, and smaller movements, as well as the growth of drug production, corruption and the spread of even more violent paramilitary groups such as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia ([[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]]) has made it difficult to solve the country's problems.

Although the FARC and ELN accepted participation in the peace process, they did not make explicit commitments to end the conflict. The FARC suspended talks in November 2000, to protest what it called &quot;paramilitary terrorism&quot; but returned to the negotiating table in February 2001, following 2 days of meetings between President Pastrana and FARC leader Manuel Marulanda. The Colombian Government and ELN in early 2001 continued discussions aimed at opening a formal peace process.

===Plan Colombia===
No single explanation fully addresses the deep roots of Colombia's present-day troubles, but they include limited government presence in large areas of the interior, the expansion of illicit drug cultivation, endemic violence, and social inequities. In order to confront these challenges, the Pastrana administration unveiled its [[Plan Colombia]] in late 1999, an integrated strategy to deal with these longstanding, mutually reinforcing problems.

The main stated objectives of the original Plan Colombia were to promote peace, combat the narcotics industry, revive the Colombian economy, improve respect for human rights, and strengthen the democratic and social institutions of the country. Colombia planned to finance US$4 billion of the estimated US$7.5 billion overall cost, most of which would go towards the social portion of the project, but was ultimately unable to do so due to the state's 1997–1998 economic crisis.

The United States approved a US$1.3 billion assistance package, mostly of military and counternarcotics nature, but also including a small amount of social aid. The Colombian Government sought additional support from the IFIs, the [[European Union]], and other countries, with the intention of financing the social component of the original plan, but met with little cooperation as the would-be donors considered that the U.S. approved aid represented an undue military slant and additionally lacked the will to spend such amounts of money.

After the eventual breakup of the peace negotiations, which had been stalled numerous times and finally ended due to a guerrilla kidnapping of a congressman and other political figures, the Caguán demilitarized zone was terminated by the Pastrana administration.

Soon after that, in May 2002, the former liberal politician of conservative leanings [[Álvaro Uribe]], whose father had been killed by left-wing guerrillas, was sworn in as Colombian president. He immediately began taking action to crush the FARC, ELN, and AUC, including the employment of citizen informants to help the police and armed forces track down suspected members in all three armed groups.

In the fall of 2002, the administration released the much-awaited Colombian national security strategy, entitled Democratic Security and Defense Policy. The Plan would fit within the broader social, economic, and political goals of Plan Colombia. Though much attention has been focused on the security and military aspects of Colombia's situation, the administration also is spending significant time on issues such as expanding international trade, supporting alternate means of development, and reforming Colombia's judicial system.

==Recent developments==
{{update|date=November 2010}}
{{As of|2004}}, two years after its implementation began, the security situation of inside Colombia has shown some measure of an improvement and the economy, while still fragile, has also shown some positive signs according to observers, but relatively little has yet to have been accomplished in structurally solving most of the country's other grave problems, possibly in part due to legislative and political conflicts between the administration and the Colombian Congress (including those over the controversial project to eventually re-elect Uribe), and a relative lack of freely allocated funds and credits.

Some critical observers consider that Uribe's policies, while admittedly reducing crime and guerrilla activity, might be too slanted in favor of a military solution to Colombia's internal war, neglecting grave social and human rights concerns to a certain extent. They ask for Uribe's government to change this position and make serious efforts towards improving the human rights situation inside the country, protecting civilians and reducing any abuses committed by the armed forces.

Uribe's supporters in turn believe that increased military action is a necessary prelude to any serious negotiation attempt with the guerrillas and that the increased security situation will help to, in the long term, focus more actively on reducing most wide-scale abuses and human rights violations on the part of both the armed groups and any rogue security forces that might have links to the paramilitaries. In short, that the security situation must be stabilized in favor of the government before any other social concerns can take precedence.

With such conflicting perspectives, it can be argued that a certain polarization between both supporters and opponents of President Uribe seems to be forming both inside and outside the country. Uribe was reelected in 2006 after a change in the constitution allowed presidents to be reelected.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Politics of Colombia}}
[[Colombia]] seeks diplomatic and commercial relations with all countries, regardless of their ideologies or [[politics|political]] or economic systems. For this reason, the Colombian economy is very open, relying on international trade and following the guidelines given by the [[international law]].

Regional relations remain good despite occasional issues with neighbors, especially regarding spillover from [[Colombian Armed Conflict|Colombia's armed conflict]], including cross-border guerrilla crossings, the flow of refugees, and the spread of drug crops. These issues are of particular concern to the bordering countries of [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], and [[Venezuela]]. For example, Ecuador has closed its main border crossing with Colombia every night since August 2002, when evidence emerged that Colombian guerrillas and paramilitaries were asserting control over Ecuador's border communities. On May 1, 2004, Ecuador placed further stringent visa restrictions on Colombians seeking to enter Ecuador. Relations with [[Nicaragua]] and Venezuela have been strained over territorial disputes. Bilateral committees are negotiating the dispute with Venezuela over waters in the Gulf of Venezuela. Other issues with Venezuela include the presence of illegal undocumented Colombians in Venezuela, and activities of Colombian narcotics traffickers, and Venezuela's support for the Guerrillas in Colombia.

==Background==
In 1969, Colombia formed what is now the [[Andean Community]] along with [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]] ([[Venezuela]] joined in 1973, and Chile left in 1976).

In the 1980s, Colombia broadened its bilateral and multilateral relations, joining the [[Contadora Group]], the [[Group of Eight]] (now the [[Rio Group]]), and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], which it chaired from 1994 until September 1998. In addition, it has signed free trade agreements with Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela.

Colombia has traditionally played an active role in the [[United Nations]] and the Organization of American States and in their subsidiary agencies. Former President [[César Gaviria]] became Secretary General of the OAS in September 1994 and was reelected in 1999. Colombia was a participant in the December 1994 and April 1998 Summits of the Americas and followed up on initiatives developed at the summit by hosting two post-summit, ministerial-level meetings on trade and science and technology.

Colombia regularly participates in international fora, including CICAD, the Organization of American States' body on [[money laundering]], chemical controls, and drug abuse prevention. Although the Colombian Government ratified the [[1988 UN Convention on Narcotics]] in 1994—the last of the Andean governments to do so—it took important reservations, notably to the anti-money-laundering measures, asset forfeiture and confiscation provisions, maritime interdiction, and extradition clauses. Colombia subsequently withdrew some of its reservations, most notably a reservation on extradition.

[[Maritime boundary]] dispute with Venezuela in the [[Gulf of Venezuela]]; territorial disputes with Nicaragua over Archipelago de [[San Andrés y Providencia]] and Quita Sueño Bank. The United States disputes sovereignty with Colombia over the [[Serranilla Bank]] and the [[Bajo Nuevo Bank]]. Quita Sueño Bank is claimed by the United States to be a submerged reef, and thus does not recognize the sovereignty of any nation over the bank.

===Membership of international organizations===
Membership in International Organizations: The major organizations in which Colombia is a member include: the [[Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean]], [[Andean Pact]], [[Caribbean Development Bank]], [[Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], [[Group of 3]], [[Group of 11]], [[Group of 24]], [[Group of 77]], [[Inter-American Development Bank]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], [[International Chamber of Commerce]], [[International Civil Aviation Organization]], [[International Criminal Police Organization]], [[International Development Association]], [[International Finance Corporation]], [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]], [[International Labour Organization]], [[International Maritime Organization]], [[International Maritime Satellite Organization]], [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[International Olympic Committee]], [[International Organization for Migration]], [[International Organization for Standardization]], [[International Telecommunication Union]], [[International Telecommunications Satellite Organization]], [[International Trade Union Confederation]], [[Latin American Economic System]], [[Latin American Integration Association]], [[Latin Union]], [[Non-Aligned Movement]], [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]], [[Rio Group]], [[United Nations]] (UN), [[UN Conference on Trade and Development]], [[UN Educational]], [[Scientific and Cultural Organization]], [[UN Industrial Development Organization]], [[UN Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees]], [[Universal Postal Union]], [[World Confederation of Labour]], [[World Federation of Trade Unions]], [[World Health Organization]], [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], [[World Meteorological Organization]], [[World Tourism Organization]], and [[World Trade Organization]]. An OAS observer has monitored the government's peace process with the paramilitaries, lending the negotiations much-needed international credibility. The United States helps Colombia secure favorable treatment from the IMF.

===Major international treaties===
Defense treaties to which Colombia is a party include the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance of 1947 (the [[Rio Treaty]]). Regional treaties include the [[Andean Pact]], now known as the [[Andean Community]], which also includes Bolivia, [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]], the bodies and institutions making up the [[Andean Integration System]] (AIS). Colombia has signed free-trade agreements with Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela. The country has a strong bilateral trade agreement with Venezuela. The Uribe administration strongly favors extending these bilateral trade agreements across the hemisphere. Trade agreements include the Agreement on Trade, Economic, and Technical Cooperation Between the Caribbean Community and Common Market ([[Caricom]]) and the Government of the Republic of Colombia. Colombia has also signed and ratified 105 international treaties or agreements relating to the environment. These include the [[Antarctic Treaty and Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] and conventions on [[Biodiversity]], [[Climate Change]], [[Desertification]], [[Endangered Species]], [[Hazardous Wastes]], [[Marine Life Conservation]], [[Ozone Layer Protection]], [[Ship Pollution]], [[Tropical Timber 83]], [[Tropical Timber 94]], and Wetlands. It has signed, but not ratified, the [[Antarctic-Environmental Protocol]] and conventions on [[Law of the Sea and Marine Dumping]]. Colombia also has signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] and the [[Tlatelolco Treaty]]. By 1975 signatories to the 1974 [[Declaration of Ayacucho]], of which Colombia was one, had decided on limitations to nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.

Colombia is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).

Present-day Colombia and Ecuador trace back established official diplomatic relations to December, 1831 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Pasto]], in which both countries recognized each other as sovereign states. The Ecuadorean diplomatic mission in New Granada (Colombia) did not open until 1837. It wasn't until 1939 that Ecuador raised the diplomatic mission's status to an official Embassy. Colombia did the same the following year in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmrree.gov.ec/mre/documentos/ministerio/archivo_historico/radi/colombia.pdf {{es icon}} mmrree.gov.ec diplomatic relations of Colombia and Ecuador]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with the United States==
{{Main|Colombia – United States relations}}
[[Image:Clintonandvallenatokids.png|thumb|US President [[Bill Clinton]] and daughter Chelsea during a visit to Cartagena, Colombia, where they were greeted by a '''Vallenato''' children group.]]
During the last fifty years, different American governments and their representatives have become involved in Colombian affairs through the implementation of policies concerned with the above issues. Some critics of current US policies in Colombia, such as Law Professor John Barry, consider that US influences have catalyzed internal conflicts and substantially expanded the scope and nature of human rights abuses in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;John Barry, From Drug War to Dirty War: Plan Colombia and the U.S. Role in Human Rights Violations in Colombia, 12 Transnat'l L. &amp; Contemp. Probs. 161, 164 (Spring, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters, such as [[Under Secretary of State]] [[Marc Grossman]], consider that the U.S. has promoted respect for human rights and the rule of law in Colombia, in addition to the fight against drugs and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Grossman. Subsecretario de Estado para Asuntos Políticos. Universidad de Georgetown. Conferencia Uniendo esfuerzos por Colombia. US Embassy of Colombia (September 2, 2002). Available at http://bogota.usembassy.gov/wwwsmg13.shtml. Retrieved on March 27, 2006. (Spanish) (English version available)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Embassy of Colombia in Washington, D.C..JPG|thumb|left|[[Embassy of Colombia in Washington, D.C.|Embassy of Colombia]] in Washington, D.C.]]
The country traditionally has had good relations with the United States. Relations were strained during the presidency of [[Ernesto Samper Pizano|Ernesto Samper]] (1994–98) due to accusations of receiving illegal campaign funding from the [[Cali Cartel]]. Relations between the two countries greatly improved during the [[Andrés Pastrana|Pastrana]] administration (1998–2002). In January 2000, the Clinton administration pledged more than US$1 billion of mainly military assistance to Colombia to assist the antidrug component of President Pastrana's strategy known as [[Plan Colombia]].

Relations with the United States became a foreign policy priority for the Uribe administration, and President Uribe is an important ally in [[George W. Bush]]'s &quot;[[War on Terrorism]]&quot;. In March 2002, in response to a request from Bush, the [[U.S. Congress]] lifted restrictions on U.S. assistance to Colombia to allow it to be used for counterinsurgency in addition to antidrug operations. U.S. support for Colombia's antidrug-trafficking efforts included slightly more than US$2.5 billion between 2000 and 2004, as compared with only about US$300 million in 1998. In addition to the challenge posed to the United States by Colombian drug trafficking, illegal Colombian immigrants in the United States are an issue in U.S.-Colombian relations. An estimated one million illegal Colombian immigrants were in the United States by 1999. In early 2003, Colombia ranked among the top seven countries in the world exporting illegal aliens to the United States.

==Europe==
Under the Uribe administration, Colombia's relations with the [[European Union]] (EU) have been cordial. Representatives of the EU have been critical of Colombia's antiguerrilla and antidrug strategies in several respects. The EU is particularly concerned about the potential for increased [[human rights in Colombia|human rights abuses within Colombia]] at the hands of both government forces and illegal armed groups, and it has continued to distance itself from [[Plan Colombia]]. The EU is in favor of a negotiated solution to the nation's internal conflict. EU aid to Colombia has mainly consisted of social, economic and development investments.

In 2004, the EU as an entity did not offer unrestricted support for the Uribe government's peace initiative with paramilitaries, citing concerns over the possible lack of a credible and comprehensive peace strategy and its application, but it did approve 2 million USD in aid for the process. Individual EU members such Sweden, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands also provided limited support on their own.

==Transnational issues==
{{update|date=November 2010}}

===Illicit drugs===
Illicit producer of [[coca]], [[opium]] poppies, and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]:

*In 1998, Colombia was estimated to be the world's leading coca cultivator (cultivation of coca in 1998 - {{convert|1101|km²|0|abbr=on}}, a 28% increase over 1997).
*As such, Colombia was also estimated to be the world's largest processor of coca derivatives into [[cocaine]]; a supplier of cocaine to the US and other international drug markets, and an important supplier of [[heroin]] to the US market.
*In 1998, cultivation of opium in remained steady at {{convert|66|km²|0|abbr=on}}; potential production of opium in 1997 - 66 metric [[ton]]s, a 5% increase over 1996;
*Colombia maintains an active U.S.-backed aerial eradication program.

====Narcotics &amp; Terrorism====
By the 1990s, Colombia had become the world's leading supplier of refined cocaine and a growing source for heroin. More than 90% of the cocaine that entered in the 1990s the United States was produced, processed, or transshipped in Colombia. The cultivation of coca reduced  between 1995 and 1999 from 3,020 to {{convert|1100|km²|0|abbr=on}}, primarily in areas where government control is more active.

Despite the death of Medellín cartel drug kingpin [[Pablo Escobar]] in 1993 and the arrests of major Cali cartel leaders in 1995 and 1996, Colombian drug cartels remain among the most sophisticated criminal organizations in the world, controlling cocaine processing, international wholesale distribution chains, and markets. In 1999 Colombian police arrested over 30 narcotraffickers, most of them extraditable, in &quot;Operation Millennium&quot; involving extensive international cooperation. More arrests were made in a following &quot;Operation Millennium II.&quot;

Colombia is engaged in a broad range of narcotics control activities. Through aerial spraying of herbicide and manual eradication, Colombia has attempted to keep coca, opium poppy, and [[cannabis cultivation]] from expanding. The government has committed itself to the eradication of all illicit crops, interdiction of drug shipments, and financial controls to prevent money laundering. Alternative development programs were introduced in 1999.

Corruption and intimidation by traffickers complicate the drug-control efforts of the institutions of government. Colombia passed revised criminal procedures code in 1993 that permits traffickers to surrender and negotiate lenient sentences in return for cooperating with prosecutors. In December 1996 and February 1997, however, the Colombian Congress passed legislation to toughen sentencing, asset forfeiture, and money-laundering penalties.

In November 1997, the Colombian Congress amended the constitution to permit the extradition of Colombian nationals, albeit not retroactively. In late 1999, President Pastrana authorized the first extradition in almost 10 years of a Colombian trafficker to stand trial for U.S. crimes. Three such extraditions to the United States have taken place, the most recent in August 2000, with cases against others pending in Colombian courts. Under the Pastrana administration, [[Plan Colombia]] was  developed and implemented with U.S. backing.

In 2005, the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] estimated that some {{convert|860|km²|0|abbr=on}} were under cultivation. [http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/press_release_2006-06-20.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Czech landscape is quite varied. Bohemia, to the west, consists of a [[river basin]], drained by the [[Elbe]] (Czech: ''Labe'') and [[Vltava]] rivers. It is surrounded by mostly low mountains such as the [[Sudetes]] with its part [[Krkonoše]], containing the highest point in the country, the [[Sněžka-Śnieżka|Sněžka]] at {{convert|1602|m|ft|0}}. Moravia, the eastern part, is also quite hilly and is drained predominantly by the [[Morava River|Morava]] river, but also contains the source of the [[Oder River|Oder]] (Czech: ''Odra'') river. Water from the landlocked Czech Republic flows to three different seas: the [[North Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Black Sea]]. The [[Czech Republic]] also possesses [[Moldauhafen]], a {{convert|30,000|m2|acre|adj=on}} [[enclave]] in the middle of [[Hamburg]] docks, which was awarded to [[Czechoslovakia]] by Article 363 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] to allow the landlocked country a place where goods transported downriver could be transferred to seagoing ships; this territory reverts to [[Germany]] in 2028.

{{Politics of the Czech Republic}}
'''Politically''', the '''Czech Republic''' is a multi-party [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic. According to the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]], the [[President of the Czech Republic|President]] is the [[head of state]] while the [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]], exercising supreme [[executive power]]. The Legislature is [[bicameral]], with the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] (''Poslanecká sněmovna'') and the [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Senate]] (''Senát'').

==Political developments==
The [[Czech Republic|Czech]] political scene supports a broad spectrum of [[political party|parties]] ranging from [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|Communist Party]] on the far left to various [[nationalistic]] parties on the extreme right. Generally, the (liberal) right beyond the specific case of huge and conservative [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] is splintered and has failed in several attempts to unite.

Czech voters returned a split verdict in the June 2002 parliamentary elections, giving [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] (ČSSD) and Communists majority, without any possibility to form a functioning government together due to [[Vladimír Špidla]]'s strong anticommunism. The results produced a ČSSD coalition government with [[Christian Democratic Union - Czechoslovak People's Party|Christian Democrats]] (KDU-ČSL) and [[Freedom Union-Democratic Union|Liberals]] (US-DEU), while [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democrats]] (ODS) and Communists (KSČM) took place in opposition. The MP ratio was the tiniest 101:99. After many buffetings and, finally, after the catastrophic results of the June [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Czech Republic)|European Parliament election, 2004]] Špidla resigned after a revolt in his own party and the government was reshuffled on the same basis.

[[Image:Flag of the president of the Czech Republic.svg|left|thumb|Flag of the Czech president]]

As the system in Czech repeatedly produces very weak governments (a specific problem is that about 15% of the electorate support the Communists, who are shunned by all the other parties) there is constant talk about changing it but without much chance of really pushing the reform through. An attempt to increase majority elements by tweaking the system parameters (more smaller districts, [[d'Hondt method]] used) by ČSSD and ODS during their &quot;opposition agreement&quot; 1998–2002 was vehemently opposed by smaller parties and blocked by the Constitutional Court as going too much against the constitution-stated proportional principle; only a moderated form was adopted. This, however led to a stalemate in 2006 elections where both the left and the right each gained exactly 100 seats; as many commenters point out, the earlier system would have given the right 3–4 seats majority.

In March 2006, the parliament overturned a veto by President Václav Klaus, and the Czech Republic became the first former communist country in Europe to grant legal recognition to same-sex partnerships.

A government formed of a coalition of the ODS, KDU-ČSL, and the [[Green Party (Czech Republic)|Green Party]] (SZ), and led by the leader of the ODS [[Mirek Topolánek]] finally succeeded in winning a [[vote of confidence]] on 19 January 2007. This was thanks to two members of the ČSSD, [[Miloš Melčák]] and [[Michal Pohanka]], who abstained.

On 23 March 2009, the government of Mirek Topolánek lost a [[vote of no-confidence]].

The [[President of the Czech Republic]] is elected by collective session of the parliament for five-year term (no more than two consecutive). The president is a formal [[head of state]] with limited specific powers, most importantly to return laws to the parliament, nominate [[Constitutional Court]] judges for Senate's approval, and dissolve the parliament under certain special and rare conditions. He also appoints the [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic|prime minister]] as well the other members of the cabinet on a proposal by the prime minister. [[Václav Klaus]], now President of the Czech Republic, former Prime Minister and chairman of Civic Democrats (ODS) remains one of the country's most popular politicians.

The Prime Minister is the head of government and wields considerable powers, including the right to set the agenda for most foreign and domestic policy, mobilize the parliamentary majority, and choose governmental ministers.

==Legislative branch==
{{Main|Parliament of the Czech Republic}}
[[Image:Zasedací sál Poslanecké sněmovny.jpg|right|thumb|Interior of [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Sněmovna]]]]
[[Image:Senat Wallenstein palace Prague 4677.JPG|thumb|[[Wallenstein Palace]] – Seat of the Senate in Prague]]

The [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Parliament]] (''Parlament České republiky'') has [[bicameralism|two chambers]]. The [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] (''Poslanecká sněmovna'') has 200 members, elected for a four year term by [[proportional representation]] with a 5 % [[election threshold]]. There are 14 voting districts identical to the country's administrative regions. The Chamber of Deputies, at first the [[Czech National Council]], has the powers and responsibilities of the now defunct federal parliament of the former [[Czechoslovakia]]. 

The [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Senate]] (''Senát'') has 81 members, in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]] elected by two-round [[Two-round system|runoff voting]] for a six-year term, with one third renewed every even year in the autumn. The first election was 1996 (for differing terms). This is patterned after the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] but each constituency is of (roughly) same size and the system used is two-round runoff voting. The Senate is unpopular among the public and suffers from low election turnout (overall roughly 30% in the first round, 20% in the second).

==Judicial branch==
{{Main|Judiciary of the Czech Republic}}
The country's highest court of appeals is the [[Supreme Court of the Czech Republic|Supreme Court]]. The [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]], which rules on constitutional issues, is appointed by the president with Senate approval, and its 15 members serve 10-year terms. The justices of the Constitutional Court have a mandatory retirement age of 70. The [[Supreme Administrative Court of the Czech Republic|Supreme Administrative Court]] is the third arm of the Czech judiciary.

==Administrative divisions==
The Czech Republic is divided in 14 [[Regions of the Czech Republic|Regions]] including the capital of Prague. The older 73 districts (''okresy'', singular: ''okres'') and 4 municipalities* (města, singular: ''město'') were disbanded in 1999 in an often-criticised administrative reform; however are still traditionally recognized and remain the seats of various branches of state administration:
[[Benešov]], [[Beroun]], [[Blansko]], [[Břeclav]], [[Brno]]-město*, Brno-venkov, [[Bruntál]], [[České Budějovice]], [[Česká Lípa]], [[Český Krumlov]], [[Cheb]], [[Chomutov]], [[Chrudim]], [[Děčín]], [[Domažlice]], [[Frýdek-Místek]], [[Havlíčkův Brod]], [[Hodonín]], [[Hradec Králové]], [[Jablonec nad Nisou]], [[Jeseník]], [[Jičín]], [[Jihlava]], [[Jindřichův Hradec]], [[Karlovy Vary]], [[Karviná]], [[Kladno]], [[Klatovy]], [[Kolín]], [[Kroměříž]], [[Kutná Hora]], [[Liberec]], [[Litoměřice]], [[Louny]], [[Mělník]], [[Mladá Boleslav]], [[Most]], [[Náchod]], [[Nový Jičín]], [[Nymburk]], [[Olomouc]], [[Opava]], [[Ostrava]]*, [[Pardubice]], [[Pelhřimov]], [[Písek]], [[Plzeň]]*, Plzeň-jih, Plzeň-sever, [[Prachatice]], [[Prague|Praha]]*, Praha-východ, Praha-západ, [[Přerov]], [[Příbram]], [[Prostějov]], [[Rakovník]], [[Rokycany]], [[Rychnov nad Kněžnou]], [[Semily]], [[Sokolov (Sokolov District)|Sokolov]], [[Strakonice]], [[Šumperk]], [[Svitavy]], [[Tábor]], [[Tachov]], [[Teplice]], [[Trutnov]], [[Třebíč]], [[Uherské Hradiště]], [[Ústí nad Labem]], [[Ústí nad Orlicí]], [[Vsetín]], [[Vyškov]], [[Žďár nad Sázavou]], [[Zlín]], [[Znojmo]]

Of the emerging democracies in [[Central Europe|central]] and [[eastern Europe]], the [[Czech Republic]] has one of the most developed industrialized [[economic system|economies]]. It is one of the most stable and prosperous of the post-Communist states of Central and Eastern Europe. GDP per capita at purchasing power parity was $26,800 in 2008, which is 82% of the EU average.

The principal industries are heavy and general machine-building, [[Iron (material)|iron]] and [[steel]] production, metalworking, [[chemistry|chemical]] production, [[electronics]], transportation equipment, [[textile]]s, [[glass]], brewing, china, [[ceramic]]s, and [[pharmaceutical]]s. Its main agricultural products are [[sugarbeet]]s (now largely destroyed by [[EU]] quota policies), [[fodder|fodder root]]s, [[potato]]es, [[wheat]], and [[hops]].

==History==
{{See|Economy of Czechoslovakia}}

Its strong industrial tradition dates to the 19th century, when [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] were the economic heartland of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Today, this heritage is both an [[asset]] and a [[liability (financial accounting)|liability]]. The Czech Republic has a well-educated population and a well-developed [[infrastructure]], but its industrial plants and much of its industrial equipment are obsolete.

According to the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] development policy of planned interdependence, all the economies of the [[socialist]] countries were linked tightly with that of the [[Soviet Union]]. With the disintegration of the communist economic alliance in 1991, Czech manufacturers lost their traditional markets among former communist countries to the east.

===1990-1995===
The &quot;[[Velvet Revolution]]&quot; in 1989, offered a chance for profound and sustained political and economic reform. Signs of economic resurgence began to appear in the wake of the [[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]] that the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) labelled the &quot;''big bang''&quot; of January 1991. Since then, consistent liberalization and astute economic management has led to the removal of 95% of all price controls, low [[unemployment]], a positive [[balance of payments]] position, a stable [[exchange rate]], a shift of exports from former [[Eastern bloc|communist economic bloc]] markets to [[Western Europe]], and relatively low [[foreign debt]]. Inflation has been higher than in some other countries - mostly in the 10% range{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} - and the government has run consistent modest [[budget deficit]]s{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}.

Two government priorities have been strict [[fiscal policy|fiscal policies]] and creating a good climate for incoming investment in the republic. Following a series of currency [[devaluation]]s, the [[Czech koruna|crown]] has remained stable in relation to the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}. The Czech crown became fully [[convertibility|convertible]] for most business purposes in late 1995.

In order to stimulate the economy and attract foreign partners, the government has revamped the legal and administrative structure governing [[investment]]. With the breakup of the Soviet Union, the country, till that point highly dependent on exports to the USSR, had to make a radical shift in economic outlook: away from the East, and towards the West. This necessitated the restructuring of existing banking and telecommunications facilities, as well as adjusting commercial laws and practices to fit Western standards. Further minimizing reliance on a single major partner, successive Czech governments have welcomed [[United States of America|U.S.]] investment (amongst others) as a counter-balance to the strong economic influence of Western European partners, especially of their powerful neighbour, [[Germany]]. &lt;!-- Which was not always successful, see the flop with Boeing vs Aero Vodochody. --&gt; Although [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) runs in uneven cycles, with a 12.9% share of total FDI between 1990 and March 1998, the U.S. was the third-largest foreign investor in the Czech economy, behind Germany and the [[Netherlands]].

Progress toward creating a stable investment climate was recognized when the Czech Republic to become the first post-communist country to receive an investment-grade credit rating by international credit institutions{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}.

The republic boasts a flourishing consumer production sector and has [[privatization|privatized]] most state-owned heavy industries through the [[voucher privatization]] system. Under the system, every citizen was given the opportunity to buy, for a moderate price, a book of vouchers that represents potential shares in any state-owned company. The voucher holders could then invest their vouchers, increasing the capital base of the chosen company, and creating a nation of citizen share-holders. This is in contrast to Russian privatization, which consisted of sales of communal assets to private companies rather than share-transfer to citizens. The effect of this policy has been dramatic. Under [[communism]], state ownership of businesses was estimated to be 97% {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}. Privatization through restitution of real estate to the former owners was largely completed in 1992. By 1998, more than 80% of enterprises were in private hands. Now completed {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}, the program has made Czechs, who own shares of each of the Czech companies, one of the highest per-capita share owners in the world{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. &lt;!--. Some people think it was a flop. Shouldn't it be reflected here? --&gt;

===1995-2000===
The republic's economic transformation was far from complete. Political and financial crises in 1997, shattered the Czech Republic's image as one of the most stable and prosperous of post-Communist states. Delays in enterprise restructuring and failure to develop a well-functioning capital market played major roles in Czech economic troubles, which culminated in a currency crisis in May. The formerly pegged currency was forced into a floating system as investors sold their Korunas faster than the government could buy them. This followed a worldwide trend to divest from developing countries that year. Investors also worried the republic's economic transformation was far from complete. Another complicating factor was the current account deficit, which reached nearly 8% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. 

In response to the crisis, two [[austerity]] packages were introduced later in the spring (called vernacularly &quot;The Packages&quot;), which cut government spending by 2.5% of GDP. Growth dropped to 0.3% in 1997, -2.3% in 1998, and -0.5% in 1999. The government established a restructuring agency in 1999 and launched a revitalization program - to spur the sale of firms to foreign companies. Key priorities included accelerating legislative convergence with [[European Union|EU]] norms, restructuring enterprises, and privatising banks and utilities. The economy, fueled by increased export growth and investment, was expected to recover by 2000.

===2000-2005===
Growth in 2000-05 was supported by exports to the EU, primarily to Germany, and a strong recovery of foreign and domestic investment. Domestic demand is playing an ever more important role in underpinning growth as interest rates drop and the availability of credit cards and mortgages increases. Current account deficits of around 5% of GDP are beginning to decline as demand for Czech products in the European Union increases. Inflation is under control. Recent accession to the EU gives further impetus and direction to structural reform. In early 2004 the government passed increases in the Value Added Tax (VAT) and tightened eligibility for social benefits with the intention to bring the public finance gap down to 4% of GDP by 2006, but more difficult pension and healthcare reforms will have to wait until after the next elections. Privatization of the state-owned telecommunications firm [[Český Telecom]] took place in 2005. Intensified restructuring among large enterprises, improvements in the financial sector, and effective use of available EU funds should strengthen output growth.

===2005-2010===
Growth continued in the first years of the EU membership. The credit portion of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]] did not affect the Czech Republic much, mostly due to its stable banking sector which has learned its lessons during a smaller crisis in the late 1990s and became much more cautious. As a fraction of the GDP, the Czech public debt belongs among the smallest ones in Central and Eastern Europe. Moreover, unlike many other post-communist countries, an overwhelming majority of the household debt - over 99% - is denominated in the local Czech currency. That's why the country wasn't affected by the shrunken money supply in the U.S. dollars.

However, as a large exporter, the economy was sensitive to the decrease of the demand in Germany and other trading partners. In the middle of 2009, the annual drop of the GDP for 2009 was estimated around 3% or 4.3%,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/278536,czech-economy-to-shrink-by-43-per-cent-in-2009.html Czech economy to shrink by 4.3 per cent in 2009 | Earth Times News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; a relatively modest decrease. The impact of the economic crisis may have been limited by the existence of the national currency that temporarily weakened in H1 of 2009, simplifying the life of the exporters.

==Energy==
The Czech Republic is reducing its dependence on highly polluting low-grade [[brown coal]] as a source of energy. [[Nuclear energy]] presently provides about 30% of total power needs, and its share is projected to increase to 40%. [[Natural gas]] is procured from [[Russia]]n [[Gazprom]] (roughly three-fourths of domestic consumption) and from [[Norway|Norwegian]] companies (most of the remaining one-fourth). Russian gas is imported via Ukraine ([[Druzhba pipeline|Friendship pipeline]]), Norwegian gas is transported through [[Germany]]. The gas consumption (approx. 100 TWh in 2003-5) is almost two times higher than the electricity consumption. South Moravia has a [[Oil and gas deposits in the Czech Republic|small amount of oil and gas deposits]].

The '''Army of the Czech Republic''' ({{lang-cs|Armáda České republiky}}) comprise the land forces, the [[Czech Air Force]] and support units. From the late 1940s to 1989, the extensive [[Czechoslovak Armed Forces]] (about 200,000) formed one of the pillars of the [[Warsaw Pact]] military alliance. After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, the [[Czech Republic]] is completing a major reorganisation and reduction of the armed forces, which intensified after the Czech Republic joined [[NATO]] on March 12, 1999.

==History==
[[File:Afghanistan - Czech BVP2 tanks are firing.JPG|thumb|Czech [[BMP2|BVP2]] firing in Afghanistan]]
The Czechoslovak Armed Forces were originally formed after 1918. Following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1938, Czechoslovak units and formations served with the [[Polish Army]] ([[Czechoslovak Legion (1939)|Czechoslovak Legion]]), the [[French Army]], the [[Royal Air Force]], the [[British Army]] (the [[1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade]]), and the [[Red Army]] ([[I Corps (Czechoslovakia)|I Corps]]). Four Czech and Slovak-manned RAF squadrons were transferred to Czechoslovak control in late 1945.

From 1945 until 1990, the Army was known as the [[Czechoslovak People's Army]] (ČSLA).&lt;ref&gt;For more information on the Czechoslovak Army during the Cold War, see Gordon L. Rottman, ''Warsaw Pact Ground Forces'', [[Osprey Publishing]], 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ČSLA, as formed in 1945, included both Soviet- and British-sponsored expatriate troops, the British-sponsored soldiers had been purged from the ČSLA by 1948. The ČSLA offered no resistance to the invasion mounted by the Soviets in 1968 in reaction to the &quot;Prague Spring&quot;, and was extensively reorganized by the Soviets following the re-imposition of communist rule in Prague.

&quot;Of the approximately 201,000 personnel on active duty in the ČSLA in 1987, about 145,000, or about 72 percent, served in the ground forces (commonly referred to as the army). About 100,000 of these were conscripts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress Country Study: Czechoslovakia, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+cs0133) Ground Forces], 1987&lt;/ref&gt; There were two military districts, Western and Eastern. A 1989 listing of forces shows two Czech armies in the west, the 1st at [[Pribram]] with one tank division and three motor rifle divisions, the 4th at [[Pisek]] with two tank divisions and two motor rifle divisions. In the Eastern Military District, there were two tank divisions, the 13th and 14th, with a supervisory headquarters at [[Trencin]] in the east of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Orbat.com, [http://www.orbat.com/site/history/historical/nato/warsawpact.html Warsaw Pact Order of Battle 1989], accessed 2 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cold War, the ČSLA was equipped primarily with Soviet arms, although certain arms like the P-27 ''Panceřovka'' antitank rocket launcher and the ''SKOT'' armored personnel carrier were of Czechoslovak design.

The Army of the Czech Republic was formed after the Czechoslovak Armed Forces split after the 1 January 1993 dissolution of [[Czechoslovakia]]. Czech forces stood at 90,000 in 1993. They were reduced to around 65,000 in 11 combat brigades and the Air Force in 1997, to 63,601 in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceandstrategy.eu/filemanager/files/file.php?file=6406|title=Starting points for professionalization of the armed forces|language=Czech|year=2000|accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to 35,000 in 2005. At the same time, the forces were modernized and reoriented towards a defensive posture. In 2004 the army transformed itself into a fully professional organization and compulsory military service was abolished. The Army maintains an active reserve.

The [[Czech Republic]] is a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]. Since 1990, the ACR and the Czech Armed Forces have contributed to numerous peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, including [[IFOR]], [[SFOR]], and [[EUFOR Althea]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Desert Shield]]/[[Desert Storm]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Kosovo]], [[Albania]], [[Turkey]], [[Pakistan]] and with the Coalition forces in [[Iraq]].

Current deployments (as of 2010):

*[[Kosovo]]: NATO Operation &quot;Joint Enterprise&quot; ([[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]) - 450 soldiers
*[[Afghanistan]]: NATO Operation ([[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]]) - 458 soldiers, 12 civilian experts and 3 [[Mil Mi-17|Mi-171S]] helicopters in Faizabad, Logar and Paktika provinces.
*[[Somalia]]: EU Operation Atalanta ([[European Union Naval Force Somalia – Operation ATALANTA|NAVFOR]]) - 3 soldiers
*[[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]]: UN peacekeeping mission ([[United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo|MONUC]]) - 3 military observers
*[[Afghanistan]]: UN peacekeeping mission ([[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan|UNAMA]]) - 1 military observer
*[[Kosovo]]: UN peacekeeping mission ([[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]]) - 1 military observer

In February 2010 Czech media started to speculate about possible corruption around the purchase of [[Pandur II]] vehicles for the Czech Army.&lt;ref&gt;http://zpravy.idnes.cz/secret-pandur-agreement-bring-the-politicians-we-ll-pay-pio-/prilohy.asp?c=A100221_142541_domaci_abr&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

===Active reserves===

'''Active Reserve''' (in [[Czech language|Czech]] ''Aktivní záloha'') is a part of the otherwise professional Czech Armed forces. This service was created to allow participation of citizens with positive attitude to the military.

A volunteer needs either to have completed the compulsory military service (which ended in 2004) or to attend 8 week training. 
Then the reservists have to serve up to three weeks a year and can be called to serve two weeks in time of non-military crisis. They are not intended to serve abroad. The Reserve presents itself on events like [[BAHNA]], a military show.

{{Politics of the Czech Republic}}
Until the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989, the foreign policy of [[Czechoslovakia]] had followed that of the [[Soviet Union]]. Since the revolution and the subsequent mutually-agreed [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|peaceful dissolution]] of Czechoslovakia into the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], the [[Czechs]] have made integration with Western institutions their chief foreign policy objective. This goal was rapidly met with great success, as the nation joined [[NATO]] in 1999 and the European Union in 2004, and held the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency of the European Union]] during the first half of 2009.

==Participation in international organizations==
The Czech Republic participates in the [[United Nations]] (UN); [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO); [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF); [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD); [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA); North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the [[International Whaling Commission]].

Fundamental to this objective is Czech membership in the European Union. The Czech Republic became a member of the EU in May 2004. This followed signature of the Treaty of Accession with nine other candidate nations in 1993. Although there have been disagreements with established EU member nations over some economic issues, such as agricultural quotas and a recent{{When|date=November 2010}} amendment to the gaming law, relations are good.

The Czech Republic is a member of the United Nations and participates in its specialized agencies. It is a member of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]]. It maintains diplomatic relations with more than 85 countries, of which 63 have permanent representation in Prague. The Czech Republic became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, along with Poland and Hungary, on 12 March 1999. This membership represents a milestone in the country's foreign policy and security orientation.

==International disputes==
{{update|date=November 2010}}

===Liechtenstein===
Liechtenstein claims restitution for {{convert|1600|km2|abbr=on}} (which is ten times the size of Liechtenstein) of land in the Czech Republic confiscated from its princely family in 1918 by the then newly established state of Czechoslovakia, the predecessor of the Czech Republic; the Czech Republic insists that the power to claim restitution does not go back before February 1948, when the Communists seized power; Liechtenstein did not diplomatically recognize the Czech Republic until 2009, and the Czech Republic in turn did not diplomatically recognize Liechtenstein.

Individual [[Sudeten German]] claims for restitution of property confiscated in connection with their expulsion after World War II; agreement with Slovakia signed 24 November 1998 resolves issues of redistribution of former Czechoslovak federal land.

On 13 July 2009 the Czech Republic and Liechtenstein established diplomatic relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liechtenstein1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic establish diplomatic relations |url=http://88.82.102.51/fileadmin/_pm.liechtenstein.li/en/090713_PM_Beziehungen_CzFl_en.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Government Spokesperson's Office, the Principality of Liechtenstein |date=13 July 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Liechtenstein2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Navázání diplomatických styků České republiky s Knížectvím Lichtenštejnsko |url=http://www.mzv.cz/jnp/cz/udalosti_a_media/prohlaseni_a_stanoviska/x2009_07_13_lilchtejnstejnsko_navazani_diplomatickych_vztahu.html |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic]] |language=Czech |date=13 July 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Placement of US National Missile Defense base==
In February 2007, the US started formal negotiations with Czech Republic and Poland concerning construction of missile shield installations in those countries for a Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6704669.stm | title = Europe diary: Missile defence |publisher=BBC News | date = 31 May 2007 | first = Mark | last = Mardell | authorlink = Mark Mardell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government of the Czech Republic agrees (while 67% Czechs disagree and only about 22% support it)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | url = http://www.cvvm.cas.cz/upl/zpravy/100761s_pm80306.pdf | trans_title = Citizens on U.S. Anti-Missile Radar Base in Czech Republic | title = Občané o americké radarové základně v ČR | format = PDF | language = Czech | publisher=Centrum pro výzkum veřejného mínění | date = 6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to host a missile defense radar on its territory while a base of missile interceptors is supposed to be built in Poland. The objective is reportedly to protect another parts of US National Missile Defense from long-range missile strikes from Iran and North Korea, but Czech PM [[Mirek Topolánek]] said the main reason is to avoid Russian influence and strengthen ties to US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.ods.cz/akce/kongresy/18.kongres/projev.php?ID=721&amp;podsekce=532 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080531075236/http://www.ods.cz/akce/kongresy/18.kongres/projev.php?ID=721&amp;podsekce=532 | archivedate = 31 May 2008 | publisher=[[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] | first = Mirek | last = Topolánek | authorlink = Mirek Topolánek | title = 18.

The main government supporter [[Alexandr Vondra]], Deputy Prime Minister for European affairs, used to be an ambassador to the USA. More problematic is that between 2004 and 2006 he was an executive director of a lobbying company Dutko Worldwide Prague. Dutko's and its strategic partner AMI Communications (PR company owned by [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|ODS]] members) customers are Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Nortrop Grumman, which are largest contractors for NMD development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.nenasili.cz/cs/2026_kdo-prosazuje-radar-v-cr | title = Kdo prosazuje radar v ČR? | publisher=Hnutí Nenásilí | date = 16 October 2008 | language = Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.greenpeace.org/czech/protiraketova-obrana/protiraketova_lobby | title = Protiraketová lobby v USA a České republice | publisher=[[Greenpeace]] | language = Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMI Communications also received (without a formal selection procedure) a government contract to persuade Czechs to support US radar base.

'''Climbing''' is the activity of using one's hands and feet (or indeed any other part of the body) to ascend a steep object. It is done both for recreation (to reach an inaccessible place, or for its own enjoyment) and professionally, as part of activities such as maintenance of a structure, or military operations. 

Climbing activities include:
* [[Bouldering]]: Ascending boulders or small outcrops, often with climbing shoes and a chalk bag or bucket. Usually, instead of using a safety rope from above, injury is avoided using a [[Bouldering mat|crash pad]] and a human spotter (to direct a falling climber on to the pad).
* [[Buildering]]: Climbing urban structures - usually without equipment - avoiding normal means of ascent like stairs and elevators. Aspects of buildering can be seen in the art of movement known as [[Parkour]].
* [[Canyoning]]: Climbing along [[canyons]] for sport or recreation.
* [[Chalk climbing]]: cliffs of chalk may (with difficulty) be climbed using some of the same techniques as ice climbing [http://www.firstascent.co.uk/b_person8.html].
* [[climbing competition|Competition Climbing]]: A formal, competitive sport of recent origins, normally practiced on artificial walls that resemble natural rock formations. The International Federation of Sport Climbing ([[IFSC]]) is the official organization governing competition climbing worldwide and is recognized by the [[IOC]] and [[GAISF]] and is a member of the International World Games Association ([[IWGA]]). Competition Climbing has three major disciplines: Lead, Bouldering and Speed.
* [[Ice climbing]]: Ascending ice or hard snow formations using special equipment designed for the purpose, usually [[ice axe]]s and [[crampon]]s. Techniques of protecting the climber are similar to those of rock climbing, although the protective devices themselves are different (ice screws, snow wedges).
* [[Mountaineering|Mountain climbing]] (Mountaineering): Ascending mountains for sport or recreation.  It often involves rock and/or ice climbing.
* [[Net climbing]]: Climbing net structures.  The climbing structures consist of multiple interconnected steel reinforced ropes attached to the ground and steel poles. Climbing nets are usually installed on playgrounds to assist children in developing their balancing and climbing skills.
* [[Pole climbing (gymnastic)]]: Climbing poles and masts without equipment.
* [[Pole climbing (lumberjack)]]: Lumberjack tree-trimming and competitive tree-trunk or pole climbing for speed using spikes and belts.
* [[Rock climbing]]: Ascending rock formations, often using climbing shoes and a [[chalk bag]]. Equipment such as ropes, bolts, nuts, hexes and camming devices are normally employed, either as a safeguard or for artificial aid.
* [[Rope access]]: Industrial climbing, usually [[abseiling]], as an alternative to [[scaffolding]] for short works on exposed structures.
* [[Rope climbing]]: Climbing a short, thick rope for speed. Not to be confused with ''roped climbing'', as in rock or ice climbing.
* [[Tree climbing]]: Ascending trees without the intention of harming them, using ropes and other equipment. This is a less competitive activity than rock climbing.

Rock, ice and tree climbing all usually use ropes for safety or aid. Pole climbing and rope climbing were among the first exercises to be included in the origins of modern gymnastics in the late 18th century and early 19th century.

The '''Continuity Irish Republican Army''', otherwise known as the '''Continuity IRA''' ('''CIRA''') and styling itself as ''[[Óglaigh na hÉireann]]'', is an [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] [[paramilitary]] that aims to bring about a [[united Ireland]]. It emerged from a split in the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] in 1986 but did not become active until the Provisional IRA ceasefire of 1994. It is designated as an illegal organisation in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and as a [[List of designated terrorist organizations|terrorist organisation]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]].

The CIRA considers itself a direct continuation of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (the army of the unilaterally-declared 1919–1922 [[Irish Republic]]) that fought in the [[Irish War of Independence]]; as such, its supporters regard it as the national [[army]] of an Irish Republic that occupies all 32 [[counties of Ireland|counties]] of [[Ireland]].

Its main targets are the security forces of [[Northern Ireland]]. This includes the [[British Army]] and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC), now the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI). To date, it has been responsible for the death of one PSNI officer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/index.html Sutton Index of Deaths]. ''CAIN''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
===1986 IRA General Army Convention===
The Continuity IRA has its origins in a split in the Provisional IRA. In September 1986, the Provisional IRA held a meeting of its General Army Convention (GAC), the organisation’s supreme decision-making body. It was the first GAC in 16 years. The meeting, which like all such meetings was secret, was convened to discuss among other resolutions, the articles of the Provisional IRA constitution which dealt with [[abstentionism]], its opposition to the taking of seats in [[Dáil Éireann]].&lt;ref&gt;J Bowyer Bell, The Secret Army: The IRA, Poolbeg, revised third edition, Dublin, 1997, ISBN 1-85371-813-0&lt;/ref&gt; The GAC passed motions (by the necessary two-thirds majority) allowing members of the Provisional IRA to discuss and debate the taking of parliamentary seats, and the removal of the ban on members of the organisation from supporting any successful republican candidate who took their seat in Dáil Éireann.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = A Chronology of the Conflict - 1986 | author = | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch86.htm | publisher = [[CAIN]] | date = | accessdate = 2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Essentially since the spring of 1972, the crucial player in the armed struggle has been the Provisional IRA—now ''the IRA''. (Authors Italics) J. Bowyer Bell, IRA: Tactics &amp; Targets, Poolbeg, First Published 1990, Reprinted 1993, This Edition 1998, Dublin, ISBN 1-85371-603-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Provisional IRA convention delegates opposed to the change in the Constitution claimed that the convention was gerrymandered &quot;by the creation of new IRA organisational structures for the convention, including the combinations of Sligo-Roscommon-Longford and Wicklow-Wexford-Waterford.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert White, Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, The Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary, 2006, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; The only IRA body that supported this viewpoint was the outgoing IRA Executive. Those members of the outgoing Executive who opposed the change comprised a quorum. They met, dismissed those in favour of the change, and set up a new Executive. They contacted [[Tom Maguire]], who had legitimated the Provisionals in 1969, and asked him for support. Maguire had also been contacted by supporters of Gerry Adams, then and now President of Sinn Féin, and a supporter of the change in the Provisional IRA constitution. Maguire rejected Adams' supporters, supported the IRA Executive members opposed to the change, and named the new organisers the Continuity Army Council.&lt;ref&gt;Robert White, Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, the Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary. 2006. Indiana University Press. p310&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1986 statement, he rejected &quot;the legitimacy of an Army Council styling itself the Council of the Irish Republican Army which lends support to any person or organisation styling itself as Sinn Féin and prepared to enter the partition parliament of Leinster House.&quot; In 1987, Maguire described the &quot;Continuity Executive&quot; as the &quot;lawful Executive of the Irish Republican Army.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, Dilseacht, The Story of Comdt. General Tom Maguire and the Second (all-Ireland) Dáil, 1997, pp. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claim to legitimacy===
{{Main|Irish republican legitimatism}}

Thus, similar to the claim put forward by the Provisional IRA after its split from the [[Official IRA]] in 1969, the Continuity IRA claims to be the legitimate continuation of the '[[Irish Republican Army]]' or ''Óglaigh na hÉireann''. This argument is based on the view that the surviving anti-[[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] members of the [[Second Dáil]] delegated their &quot;authority&quot; to the [[IRA Army Council]] in 1938. As further justification for this claim, [[Tom Maguire]], one of those anti-Treaty members of the Second Dáil, issued a statement in favour of the Continuity IRA as he had done in 1969 in favour of the Provisionals. [[J. Bowyer Bell]], in his ''The Irish Troubles'', describes Maguire's opinion in 1986, &quot;abstentionism was a basic tenet of republicanism, a moral issue of principle. Abstentionism gave the movement legitimacy, the right to wage war, to speak for a Republic all but established in the hearts of the people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bowyer Bell, ''The Secret Army, The IRA'', Poolbeg, revised third edition, Dublin, 1997, ISBN 1-85371-813-0, p. 575.&lt;/ref&gt; Maguire's stature was such that a delegation from Gerry Adams sought his support in 1986, but was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. White, Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, The Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary'', 2006, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to other organisations===
These changes within the military wing of the [[Republican Movement (Ireland)|Republican Movement]] were accompanied by changes in the political wing and at the 1986 [[Sinn Féin]] Ard Fheis (party conference), which followed the IRA Convention, the party's policy of [[abstentionism]], which forbade Sinn Féin elected representatives from taking seats in the [[Oireachtas]], the parliament of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], was dropped. On November 2, the 628 delegates present cast their votes, the result being 429 to 161. The traditionalists, having lost at both conventions, walked out of the Mansion House, met that evening at the West County Hotel, and reformed as [[Republican Sinn Féin]].&lt;ref&gt;J Bowyer Bell, The Secret Army, The IRA, Poolbeg, revised third edition, Dublin, 1997, ISBN 1-85371-813-0&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report in the ''Cork Examiner'', the Continuity IRA's first chief of staff was [[Dáithí Ó Conaill]],&lt;ref name = &quot;agdooe&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title = CIRA bomb adds to growing crisis in the peace process | author = | url = http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2000/02/07/current/opinionpage_9.htm | publisher = ''[[Irish Examiner]]'' | date = 2 July 2000 | accessdate = 2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also served as the first chairman of RSF from 1986 to 1987. The Continuity IRA and RSF perceive themselves as forming a &quot;true&quot; [[Republican Movement (Ireland)|Republican Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;See text of Ruairí Ó Brádaigh's [http://www.rsf.ie/boden05.htm 2005 Bodenstown oration]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and status==
The leadership of the Continuity IRA is believed to be based in the [[Munster]] and [[Ulster]] areas. It is alleged that its [[List of IRA Chiefs of Staff|chief of staff]] is a [[Limerick]] man and that a number of other key members are from that county. He is believed to have been in this position since the death of [[Dáithí Ó Conaill]], the first chief of staff, in 1991.&lt;ref name = &quot;agdooe&quot;/&gt; In 2004 the [[United States]] (US) government believed the Continuity IRA consisted of fewer than fifty hardcore activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Continuity Irish Republican Army (CIRA) | author = | url = http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/cira.htm | publisher = [[Federation of American Scientists]] | date = 13 July 2004 | accessdate = 2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform|Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform]] [[Michael McDowell]] told [[Dáil Éireann]] that the organisation had a maximum of 150 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Parliamentary Debates (Official Report - Unrevised) | author = | url = http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20050623.xml&amp;Node=H10-1#H10-1 | publisher = Dáil Éireann | date = 23 June 2005 | accessdate = 2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIRA is an illegal organisation under UK (section 11(1) of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]]) and Irish law due to the use of 'IRA' in the group's name in a situation analogous to that of the [[Real Irish Republican Army]] (RIRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Statutory Rules and Orders, 1939, No. 162.

==External aid and arsenal==
The US government suspects the Continuity IRA of having received funds and arms from supporters in the United States. Security sources in Ireland have expressed the suspicion that, in cooperation with the RIRA, the Continuity IRA may have acquired arms and material from the [[Balkans]]. They also suspect that the Continuity IRA arsenal contains some weapons that were taken from Provisional IRA arms dumps, including a few dozen rifles, machine guns, and pistols; a small amount of the explosive [[Semtex]]; and a few dozen detonators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Decommissioning - how big a task? | author = | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/386434.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 5 July 1999 | accessdate = 2007-05-18 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ciraderry.jpg|thumb|right|CIRA propaganda video]]

Initially, the Continuity IRA did not reveal its existence, either in the form of press statements or paramilitary activity. Although the [[Garda Síochána]] had suspicions that the organisation existed, they were unsure of its name, labelling it the &quot;Irish National Republican Army&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = The Continuity IRA | author = David Kerr | url = http://www.ulsternation.org.uk/continuity_ira.htm | publisher = ''Ulster Nation'' | year = 1997 | accessdate = 2007-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 January 1994, on the 75th anniversary of the First Dáil Éireann, Continuity IRA volunteers offered a &quot;final salute&quot; to Tom Maguire by firing over his grave, and a public statement and a photo were published in ''[[Saoirse Irish Freedom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Final Salute to Comdt-General Tom Maguire,&quot; Saoirse, Feabhra-February, 1994, p. 2; see also, Robert White, Ruairi O Bradaigh, the Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary. 2006. Indiana University Press, pp. 323-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was only after the Provisional IRA declared a ceasefire in 1994 that the Continuity IRA became active, announcing its intention to continue the campaign against British rule. The CIRA continues to oppose the [[Belfast Agreement]] and, unlike the Provisional IRA (and the Real IRA in 1998), the CIRA has not announced a ceasefire or agreed to participate in weapons decommissioning—nor is there any evidence that it will. In the 18th [[Independent Monitoring Commission]]'s report, the RIRA, the CIRA and the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) were deemed a potential future threat. The CIRA was labeled &quot;active, dangerous and committed and... capable of a greater level of violent and other crime&quot;. Like the RIRA and [[Real IRA/ONH|Óglaigh na hÉireann]], it too sought funds for expansion. It is also known to have worked with the INLA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentmonitoringcommission.org/documents/uploads/18.%20Eighteenth%20Report.pdf IMC May 2008 Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIRA has been involved in a number of bombing and shooting incidents. Targets of the CIRA have included the [[British Armed Forces|British military]], the Northern Ireland police service ([[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]]) and [[Ulster loyalism|Ulster loyalist]] [[Paramilitary|paramilitaries]]. By 2005 the CIRA was believed to be an established presence on the island of [[Great Britain]] with the capability of launching attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Irish terror groups 'to hit London' | author = Martin Bright and Henry McDonald| url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1441975,00.html | publisher = ''[[The Observer]]'' | date = 20 March 2005 | accessdate = 2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bomb defused in Dublin in December 2005 was believed to have been the work of the CIRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Continuity IRA link suspected in M50 alert | author = | url = http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/1209/m50.html | publisher = ''RTÉ'' | date = 9 December 2005 | accessdate = 2007-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2006, the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) blamed the CIRA for planting four bombs in Northern Ireland during the final quarter of 2005, as well as several [[bomb threat|hoax bomb warnings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IMC8&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Independent Monitoring Commission | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Eighth report of the Independent Monitoring Commission | journal = | volume = | issue = | pages = 13–14 | date = 1 February 2006 | publisher = The Stationery Office | url = http://www.independentmonitoringcommission.org/documents/uploads/8th%20IMC%20Report.pdf | format = PDF | id = | accessdate = 2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMC also blamed the CIRA for the killings of two former CIRA members in Belfast, who had stolen CIRA weapons and established a rival organisation.
&lt;ref name=&quot;IMC17&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Independent Monitoring Commission | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Seventeenth report of the Independent Monitoring Commission | journal = | volume = | issue = | pages = 9–10 | date = 7 November 2007 | publisher = The Stationery Office | url = http://www.independentmonitoringcommission.org/documents/uploads/17th_IMC.pdf | format = PDF | id = | accessdate = 2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIRA continued to be active in both planning and undertaking attacks on the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI). The IMC said they tried to create troubles to lure police forth, while they have also taken to [[stoning]] and using [[petrol bomb]]s. In addition, other assaults, [[robbery]], [[tiger kidnapping]], [[extortion]], [[fuel laundering]] and [[smuggling]] were undertaken by the group. The CIRA also actively took part in recruiting and training members, including disgruntled former Provisional IRA members. As a result of this continued activity the IMC said the group remained &quot;a very serious threat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independentmonitoringcommission.org/documents/uploads/Twentieth%20Report.pdf |title=Twentieth Report of the Independent Monitoring Commission |publisher=[[The Stationary Office]] |format=PDF |date=2008-11-10 |accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March 2009 the CIRA claimed responsibility for the fatal shooting of a PSNI officer in [[Craigavon]], [[County Armagh]]—the first police fatality in Northern Ireland since 1998. The officer was shot dead by a sniper as he and a colleague investigated &quot;suspicious activity&quot; at a house nearby when a window was smashed by youths causing the occupant to phone the police. The PSNI officers responded to the emergency call, giving a CIRA sniper the chance to shoot and kill officer Stephen Carroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Continuity IRA shot dead officer  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7934426.stm | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 2009-03-10 | accessdate = 2009-03-10 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Continuity IRA claims PSNI murder  | url = http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0310/craigavon.html | publisher = [[RTÉ News and Current Affairs]] | date = 2009-03-10 | accessdate = 2009-03-10}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal tension==
In 2005, several members of the CIRA, who were serving prison sentences in [[Portlaoise Prison]] for paramilitary activity, left the organisation. Some transferred to the INLA landing of the prison, but the majority of those who left are now independent and on E4 landing. The remaining CIRA prisoners have moved to D Wing. Supporters of the Continuity IRA leadership claim that this resulted from an internal disagreement, which although brought to a conclusion, was followed by some people leaving the organisation anyway. Supporters of the disaffected members established the [[Concerned Group for Republican Prisoners]] in their support. Most of those who had left went back to the CIRA, or dissociated themselves from the CGRP. The group now defunct.

In February 2006, the [[Independent Monitoring Commission]] claimed in a report on paramilitary activity that two groups, styling themselves as [[Saoirse na hÉireann]] and [[Óglaigh na hÉireann (CIRA splinter group)|Óglaigh na hÉireann]], had been formed after a split in the Continuity IRA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentmonitoringcommission.org/documents/uploads/8th%20IMC%20Report.pdf  Eighth Report of the [[Independent Monitoring Commission]]], 1 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Copenhagen interpretation''' is a commonly taught [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wimmel1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Hermann Wimmel|title=Quantum physics &amp; observed reality: a critical interpretation of quantum mechanics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-4sJ_fgyZJEC&amp;pg=PA2|accessdate=9 May 2011|year=1992|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789810210106|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical physics draws a distinction between particles and energy, holding that only the latter exhibit waveform characteristics, whereas [[quantum mechanics]] is based on the fact that matter has both wave and particle aspects and postulates that the state of every subatomic [[Elementary particle|particle]] can be described by a [[wavefunction]]—a mathematical representation used to calculate the probability that the particle, if measured, will be in a given location or state of motion.

In the early work of [[Max Planck]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Niels Bohr]], the existence of energy in discrete quantities had been postulated, in order to avoid certain paradoxes that arise when classical physics is pushed to extremes. Also, while elementary particles showed predictable properties in many experiments, they became highly unpredictable in certain contexts; for example, if one attempted to measure their individual trajectories through a simple physical apparatus.

The [[Copenhagen]] interpretation is an attempt to explain the results of the experiments and their [[mathematical]] formulations, in terms of quantum mechanics. It was devised by Bohr, [[Werner Heisenberg]] and others in the years 1924–27. They theorised a new world of energy quanta, entities which fit neither the classical idea of particles nor the classical idea of waves. They thereby stepped beyond the world of empirical experiments and pragmatic predictions of such phenomena as the frequencies of light emitted under various conditions. According to their interpretation, the act of measurement causes the calculated set of probabilities to &quot;collapse&quot; to the value defined by the measurement. This feature of the mathematics is known as [[wavefunction collapse]].

The Copenhagen interpretation is, in form, a composite of those statements which can be legitimately made in natural language to complement the statements and predictions made in the language of instrument readings and mathematical operations. In substance, it attempts to answer the question, &quot;What do these amazing experimental results really mean?&quot; The concept that quantum mechanics does not yield an objective description of microscopic reality but deals only with probabilities, and that measurement plays an ineradicable role, is the most significant characteristic of the Copenhagen interpretation. One consequence of this, derived by [[Heisenberg]], is that knowledge of the position of a particle limits how accurately its momentum can be known—and vice versa.

==Background==

Early twentieth-century [[experiment]]s on the [[physics]] of very small-scale [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] led to the discovery of phenomena which could not be predicted on the basis of [[classical physics]], and to new models (theories) that described and predicted very accurately these micro-scale phenomena. These models of the [[Reality|real world]], being observed at this [[microscopic scale|micro]] scale, could not easily be reconciled with the way objects are observed to behave on the [[macroscopic scale|macro]] scale of everyday life. The predictions they offered often appeared counter-intuitive to observers. Indeed, they touched off much consternation—even in the minds of their discoverers.

==Overview==

Because it consists of the views developed by a number of scientists and philosophers during the second quarter of the 20th Century, there is no definitive statement of the Copenhagen Interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;In fact Bohr and Heisenberg never totally agreed on how to understand the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, and none of them ever used the term &quot;the Copenhagen interpretation&quot; as a joint name for their ideas. Bohr once distanced himself from what he considered to be Heisenberg's more subjective interpretation [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-copenhagen/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, various ideas have been associated with it; [[Asher Peres]] remarked that very different, sometimes opposite, views are presented as &quot;the Copenhagen interpretation&quot; by different authors.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;There seems to be at least as many different Copenhagen interpretations as people who use that term, probably there are more. For example, in two classic articles on the foundations of quantum mechanics, Ballentine (1970) and Stapp(1972) give diametrically opposite definitions of 'Copenhagen.'&quot;, {{cite journal|author1=Asher Peres|title=Popper's experiment and the Copenhagen interpretation|year=2002|volume=33|issue=23|journal=Stud. History Philos. Modern Physics|arxiv=quant-ph/9910078|bibcode = 1999quant.ph.10078P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principles===

# A system is completely described by a wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, representing an observer's subjective knowledge of the system. ([[Heisenberg]]) {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
# The description of nature is essentially probabilistic, with the probability of an event related to the square of the amplitude of the wave function related to it. (The [[Born rule]], after [[Max Born]])
# It is not possible to know the value of all the properties of the system at the same time; those properties that are not known with precision must be described by probabilities. ([[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]])
# Matter exhibits a [[wave–particle duality]]. An experiment can show the particle-like properties of matter, or the wave-like properties; in some experiments both of these complementary viewpoints must be invoked to explain the results, according to the [[complementarity principle]] of [[Niels Bohr]].
# Measuring devices are essentially classical devices, and measure only classical properties such as position and momentum.
# The quantum mechanical description of large systems will closely approximate the classical description. (The [[correspondence principle]] of Bohr and Heisenberg.)

==Meaning of the wave function==
The Copenhagen Interpretation denies that the wave function is anything more than a theoretical concept, or is at least non-committal about its being a discrete entity or a discernible component of some discrete entity.

The '''subjective''' view, that the wave function is merely a mathematical tool for calculating the probabilities in a specific experiment, is a similar approach to the [[Ensemble interpretation]].

There are some who say that there are '''objective''' variants of the Copenhagen Interpretation that allow for a &quot;real&quot; wave function, but it is questionable whether that view is really [[consistent]] with [[logical positivism]] and/or with some of Bohr's statements. Bohr emphasized that science is concerned with predictions of the outcomes of experiments, and that any additional propositions offered are not scientific but meta-physical. Bohr was heavily influenced by positivism. On the other hand, Bohr and Heisenberg were not in complete agreement, and they held different views at different times. Heisenberg in particular was prompted to move towards [[Philosophical realism|realism]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Historically, Heisenberg wanted to base quantum theory solely on observable quantities such as the intensity of spectral lines, getting rid of all intuitive (anschauliche) concepts such as particle trajectories in space-time. This attitude changed drastically with his paper in which he introduced the uncertainty relations – there he put forward the point of view that it is the theory which decides what can be observed. His move from positivism to operationalism can be clearly understood as a reaction on the advent of Schrödinger’s wave mechanics which, in particular due to its intuitiveness, became soon very popular among physicists. In fact, the word anschaulich (intuitive) is contained in the title of Heisenberg’s paper.&quot;, from {{cite arxiv
 | eprint= quant-ph/0210152
 | author1= Claus Kiefer
 | title= On the interpretation of quantum theory - from Copenhagen to the present   day
 | class= quant-ph
 | year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if the wave function is not regarded as real, there is still a divide between those who treat it as definitely and entirely subjective, and those who are non-committal or agnostic about the subject. An example of the [[agnosticism|agnostic view]] is given by [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], who, while participating in a colloquium at Cambridge, denied that the Copenhagen interpretation asserted: &quot;What cannot be observed does not exist&quot;. He suggested instead that the Copenhagen interpretation follows the principle: &quot;What is observed certainly exists; about what is not observed we are still free to make suitable assumptions. We use that freedom to avoid paradoxes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/tiqm/TI_20.html#2.0 John Cramer on the Copenhagen Interpretation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of collapse==

All versions of the Copenhagen interpretation include at least a formal or methodological version of [[wave function collapse]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;To summarize, one can identify the following ingredients as being characteristic for the Copenhagen interpretation(s)[...]Reduction of the wave packet as a formal rule without dynamical significance&quot;, {{cite arxiv | eprint = quant-ph/0210152 | author1 = Claus Kiefer | title = On the interpretation of quantum theory - from Copenhagen to the present   day | class = quant-ph | year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which unobserved [[eigenvalues]] are removed from further consideration. (In other words, Copenhagenists have always made the assumption of collapse, even in the early days of quantum physics, in the way that adherents of the [[Many-worlds interpretation]] have not.) In more prosaic terms, those who hold to the Copenhagen understanding are willing to say that a wave function involves the various probabilities that a given event will proceed to certain different outcomes. But when one or another of those more- or less-likely outcomes becomes manifest the other probabilities cease to have any function in the real world. So if an electron passes through a [[double-slit experiment|double slit apparatus]] there are various probabilities for where on the detection screen that individual electron will hit. But once it has hit, there is no longer any probability whatsoever that it will hit somewhere else. Many-worlds interpretations say that an electron hits wherever there is a possibility that it might hit, and that each of these hits occurs in a separate universe.

An adherent of the subjective view, that the wave function represents nothing but knowledge, would take an equally subjective view of &quot;collapse&quot;.

Some argue that the concept of the collapse of a &quot;real&quot; wave function was introduced by Heisenberg and later developed by [[John Von Neumann]] in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;the “collapse” or “reduction” of the wave function. This was introduced by Heisenberg in his uncertainty paper [3] and later postulated by von Neumann as a dynamical process independent of the Schrodinger equation&quot;, {{cite arxiv | eprint = quant-ph/0210152 | author1 = Claus Kiefer | title = On the interpretation of quantum theory - from Copenhagen to the present   day | class = quant-ph | year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acceptance among physicists==

According to a poll at a Quantum Mechanics workshop in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Max Tegmark |title=The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: Many Worlds or Many Words? |year=1998 |pages=855–862 |volume=46 |journal=Fortsch.Phys. |arxiv=quant-ph/9709032 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-3978(199811)46:6/8&lt;855::AID-PROP855&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q |issue=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Copenhagen interpretation is the most widely-accepted specific interpretation of quantum mechanics, followed by the [[many-worlds interpretation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/everett.ps The Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics]&lt;/ref&gt; Although current trends show substantial competition from [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|alternative interpretations]], throughout much of the twentieth century the Copenhagen interpretation had strong acceptance among physicists. Astrophysicist and science writer [[John Gribbin]] describes it as having fallen from primacy after the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Gribbin, J. ''Q for Quantum''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

The nature of the Copenhagen Interpretation is exposed by considering a number of experiments and paradoxes.

1. [[Schrödinger's Cat]]
:This [[thought experiment]] highlights the implications that accepting uncertainty at the microscopic level has on macroscopic objects.  A cat is put in a sealed box, with its life or death made dependent on the state of a subatomic particle.  Thus a description of the cat during the course of the experiment—having been entangled with the state of a subatomic particle—becomes a &quot;blur&quot; of &quot;living and dead cat.&quot;  But this can't be accurate because it implies the cat is actually both dead and alive until the box is opened to check on it.  But the cat, if he survives, will only remember being alive.  Schrödinger resists &quot;so naively accepting as valid a 'blurred model' for representing reality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Schrödinger, in an article in the ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', 124, 323-38.&lt;/ref&gt; ''How can the cat be both alive and dead?''

:&lt;u&gt;The Copenhagen Interpretation&lt;/u&gt;: The wave function reflects our knowledge of the system. The wave function &lt;math&gt;(|\text{dead}\rangle + |\text{alive}\rangle)/\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt; means that, once the cat is observed, there is a 50% chance it will be dead, and 50% chance it will be alive.

2. [[Wigner's Friend]]
:Wigner puts his friend in with the cat. The external observer believes the system is in the state &lt;math&gt;(|\text{dead}\rangle + |\text{alive}\rangle)/\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt;. His friend however is convinced that cat is alive, i.e. for him, the cat is in the state &lt;math&gt;|\text{alive}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. ''How can Wigner and his friend see different wave functions?''

:&lt;u&gt;The Copenhagen Interpretation&lt;/u&gt;: Wigner's friend highlights the subjective nature of probability. Each observer (Wigner and his friend) has different information and therefore different wave functions. The distinction between the &quot;objective&quot; nature of reality and the subjective nature of probability has led to a great deal of controversy. Cf. [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] versus [[Frequency probability|Frequentist]] interpretations of probability.

3. [[Double-slit experiment|Double-Slit]] [[Diffraction]]
:Light passes through double slits and onto a screen resulting in a diffraction pattern. ''Is light a particle or a wave?''

:&lt;u&gt;The Copenhagen Interpretation&lt;/u&gt;: Light is neither. A particular experiment can demonstrate particle (photon) or wave properties, but not both at the same time ([[Complementarity (physics)|Bohr's Complementarity Principle]]).

:The same experiment can in theory be performed with ''any'' physical system: electrons, protons, atoms, molecules, viruses, bacteria, cats, humans, elephants, planets, etc. In practice it has been performed for light, electrons, [[buckminsterfullerene]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.160401 |title=Diffraction of Complex Molecules by Structures Made of Light |year=2001 |last1=Nairz |first1=Olaf |last2=Brezger |first2=Björn |last3=Arndt |first3=Markus |last4=Zeilinger |first4=Anton |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=87 |issue=16|arxiv = quant-ph/0110012 |bibcode = 2001PhRvL..87p0401N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.100404 |title=Matter-Wave Interferometer for Large Molecules |year=2002 |last1=Brezger |first1=Björn |last2=Hackermüller |first2=Lucia |last3=Uttenthaler |first3=Stefan |last4=Petschinka |first4=Julia |last5=Arndt |first5=Markus |last6=Zeilinger |first6=Anton |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=88 |issue=10|arxiv = quant-ph/0202158 |bibcode = 2002PhRvL..88j0404B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some atoms. Due to the smallness of Planck's constant it is practically impossible to realize experiments that directly reveal the wave nature of any system bigger than a few atoms but, in general, quantum mechanics  considers all matter as possessing both particle and wave behaviors. The greater systems (like viruses, bacteria, cats, etc.) are considered as &quot;classical&quot; ones but only as an approximation,not exact.

4. [[EPR paradox|EPR (Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen) paradox]]
:Entangled &quot;particles&quot; are emitted in a single event. Conservation laws ensure that the measured spin of one particle must be the opposite of the measured spin of the other, so that if the spin of one particle is measured, the spin of the other particle is now instantaneously known. The most discomforting aspect of this paradox is that the effect is instantaneous so that something that happens in one galaxy could cause an instantaneous change in another galaxy. But, according to [[Einstein]]'s theory of [[special relativity]], no information-bearing signal or entity can travel at or faster than the [[speed of light]], which is finite. Thus, it seems as if the Copenhagen interpretation is inconsistent with special relativity.

:&lt;u&gt;The Copenhagen Interpretation&lt;/u&gt;: Assuming wave functions are not real, wave-function collapse is interpreted subjectively. The moment one observer measures the spin of one particle, he knows the spin of the other. However, another observer cannot benefit until the results of that measurement have been relayed to him, at less than or equal to the speed of light.

:Copenhagenists claim that interpretations of quantum mechanics where the wave function is regarded as real have problems with EPR-type effects, since they imply that the laws of physics allow for influences to propagate at speeds greater than the speed of light. However, proponents of [[Many worlds]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#local Michael price on nonlocality in Many Worlds]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Transactional interpretation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/tiqm/TI_38.html#3.9 Relativity and Causality in the Transactional Interpretation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/tiqm/TI_33.html#3.7 Collapse and Nonlocality in the Transactional Interpretation]&lt;/ref&gt; maintain that Copenhagen interpretation is fatally non-local.

:The claim that EPR effects violate the principle that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light can be avoided by noting that they cannot be used for signaling because neither observer can control, or predetermine, what he observes, and therefore cannot manipulate what the other observer measures. Relativistic difficulties about establishing which measurement occurred first also undermine the idea that one observer is causing what the other is measuring.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

==Criticism==
The completeness of quantum mechanics (thesis 1) was attacked by the [[EPR paradox|Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment]] which was intended to show that quantum physics could not be a complete theory.

[[bell test experiments|Experimental tests of]] [[Bell's inequality]] using particles have supported the quantum mechanical prediction of entanglement.

The Copenhagen Interpretation gives special status to measurement processes without clearly defining them or explaining their peculiar effects. In his article entitled &quot;Criticism and Counterproposals to the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Theory,&quot; countering the view of Alexandrov that  (in Heisenberg's paraphrase) &quot;the wave function in configuration space characterizes the objective state of the electron.&quot; Heisenberg says,

{{quote|Of course the introduction of the observer must not be misunderstood to imply that some kind of subjective features are to be brought into the description of nature. The observer has, rather, only the function of registering decisions, i.e., processes in space and time, and it does not matter whether the observer is an apparatus or a human being; but the registration, i.e., the transition from the &quot;possible&quot; to the &quot;actual,&quot; is absolutely necessary here and cannot be omitted from the interpretation of quantum theory.|Heisenberg, Physics and Philosophy, p. 137&lt;/small&gt;}}

Many [[physicist]]s and [[philosopher]]s have objected to the Copenhagen interpretation, both on the grounds that it is non-deterministic and that it includes an undefined measurement process that converts probability functions into non-probabilistic measurements. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] comments &quot;I, at any rate, am convinced that He (God) does not throw dice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Einstein#Sourced|&quot;God does not throw dice&quot; quote]]&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Do you really think the moon isn't there if you aren't looking at it?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;A. Pais, ''Einstein and the quantum theory'', Reviews of Modern Physics '''51''', 863-914 (1979), p. 907.&lt;/ref&gt; exemplify this. Bohr, in response, said &quot;Einstein, don't tell God what to do&quot;.

[[Steven Weinberg]] in &quot;Einstein's Mistakes&quot;, ''[[Physics Today]]'', November 2005, page 31, said:

{{quote|All this familiar story is true, but it leaves out an irony. Bohr's version of quantum mechanics was deeply flawed, but not for the reason Einstein thought. The Copenhagen interpretation describes what happens when an observer makes a measurement, but the observer and the act of measurement are themselves treated classically. This is surely wrong: Physicists and their apparatus must be governed by the same quantum mechanical rules that govern everything else in the universe. But these rules are expressed in terms of a wave function (or, more precisely, a state vector) that evolves in a perfectly deterministic way. So where do the probabilistic rules of the Copenhagen interpretation come from?

Considerable progress has been made in recent years toward the resolution of the problem, which I cannot go into here. It is enough to say that neither Bohr nor Einstein had focused on the real problem with quantum mechanics. The Copenhagen rules clearly work, so they have to be accepted. But this leaves the task of explaining them by applying the deterministic equation for the evolution of the wave function, the Schrödinger equation, to observers and their apparatus.}}

The problem of thinking in terms of classical measurements of a quantum system becomes particularly acute in the field of [[quantum cosmology]], where the quantum system is the universe.&lt;ref&gt;'Since the Universe naturally contains
all of its observers, the problem arises to come up with an interpretation of
quantum theory that contains no classical realms on the fundamental level.', {{cite arxiv|eprint=quant-ph/0210152|author1=Claus Kiefer|title=On the interpretation of quantum theory - from Copenhagen to the present day|class=quant-ph|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
{{further|[[Interpretation of quantum mechanics]]}}
The [[Ensemble interpretation]] is similar; it offers an interpretation of the wave function, but not for single particles. The [[consistent histories]] interpretation advertises itself as &quot;Copenhagen done  right&quot;. [[Consciousness causes collapse]] is often confused with the Copenhagen interpretation.

If the wave function is regarded as ontologically real, and collapse is entirely rejected, a [[many worlds]] theory results. If wave function collapse is regarded as ontologically real as well, an [[objective collapse theory]] is obtained. Dropping the principle that the wave function is a complete description results in a [[hidden variable]] theory.

Many physicists have subscribed to the [[instrumentalism|instrumentalist interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, a position often equated with eschewing all interpretation. It is summarized by the sentence &quot;Shut up and calculate!&quot;. While this slogan is sometimes attributed to [[Paul Dirac]]&lt;ref&gt;http://home.fnal.gov/~skands/slides/A-Quantum-Journey.ppt&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Richard Feynman]], it is in fact due to the lesser known [[David Mermin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Physics Today |volume=57 |issue=5 |page= |url=http://scitation.aip.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_57/iss_5/10_1.shtml |title=Could Feynman Have Said This? |author=N.

[[File:Customs_unions.png|thumb|right|200px|Customs unionworldwide]]
A '''customs union''' is a type of [[trade bloc]] which is composed of a [[free trade area]] with a [[common external tariff]]. The participant countries set up common [[external trade]] policy, but in some cases they use different import [[Import quota|quota]]s. Common [[competition policy]] is also helpful to avoid [[competition]] deficiency. 

Purposes for establishing a customs union normally include increasing [[economic efficiency]] and establishing closer political and cultural ties between the member countries.  

It is the third stage of [[economic integration]].

Customs union is established through [[trade pact]].

The '''Council of Europe''' ({{lang-fr|Conseil de l'Europe}}) is an [[international organisation]] promoting co-operation between all countries of Europe in the areas of legal standards, [[human rights]], [[democracy|democratic]] development, the [[rule of law]] and cultural co-operation. It was founded in 1949, has 47 member states with some 800 million citizens, and is an entirely separate body from the [[European Union]] (EU), which has only 27 member states. Unlike the EU, the Council of Europe cannot make binding laws. The two do however share [[Symbols of Europe|certain symbols]] such as the [[flag of Europe]]. The Council of Europe has nothing to do with either the [[Council of the European Union]] or the [[European Council]], which are both EU bodies.

The best known bodies of the Council of Europe are the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which enforces the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], and the [[European Pharmacopoeia]] Commission, which sets the quality standards for pharmaceutical products in Europe. The Council of Europe's work has resulted in standards, charters and conventions to facilitate cooperation between European countries.

Its statutory institutions are the [[Committee of Ministers]] comprising the foreign ministers of each member state, the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] composed of [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] from the [[Parliament]] of each member state, and the [[Secretary General of the Council of Europe|Secretary General]] heading the secretariat of the Council of Europe. The [[Commissioner for Human Rights]] is an independent institution within the Council of Europe, mandated to promote awareness of and respect for human rights in the member states.

The headquarters of the Council of Europe are in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]], with [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] as its two [[official language]]s. The Committee of Ministers, the Parliamentary Assembly and the [[Congress of the Council of Europe|Congress]] also use [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Russian language|Russian]] for some of their work.

== History ==
[[File:Palais Universitaire de Strasbourg-10 août 1949.jpg|thumb|upright|Plaque commemorating the first session of the Council of Europe Assembly at [[Strasbourg University]]]]
In 1945, at the end of the Second World War, Europe was marked by unprecedented devastation and human suffering. It faced new political challenges, in particular reconciliation among the peoples of Europe. This situation favoured the long-held idea of [[European integration]] through the creation of common institutions.

In a speech at the [[University of Zurich]] on 19 September 1946, Sir [[Winston Churchill]] called for a &quot;kind of [[United States of Europe]]&quot; and the creation of a Council of Europe.&lt;ref name=COE_Churchill&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dgal/dit/ilcd/Fonds/Themes/Churchill/Default_en.asp |title=Winston Churchill and the Council of Europe|work=Council of Europe: Archiving and Documentary Resources |publisher=Council of Europe|date= |accessdate=4 April 2011}}, including audio extracts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA_Churchill&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=European Navigator (ENA)|url=http://www.ena.lu/the_zurich_speech-020100043.html|accessdate=4 April 2011}} Including full transcript&lt;/ref&gt; He had spoken of a Council of Europe as early as 1943 in a radio broadcast.&lt;ref name=COE_Churchill&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dgal/dit/ilcd/Fonds/Themes/Churchill/Default_en.asp |title=Winston Churchill and the Council of Europe|work=Council of Europe: Archiving and Documentary Resources |publisher=Council of Europe |date= |accessdate=4 April 2011}} Including audio extracts&lt;/ref&gt;

The future structure of the Council of Europe was discussed at a specific congress of several hundred leading politicians, government representatives and civil society in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]], in 1948. There were two schools of thought competing: some favoured a classical international organisation with representatives of governments, while others preferred a political forum with parliamentarians. Both approaches were finally combined through the creation of the Committee of Ministers and the Parliamentary Assembly under the Statute of the Council of Europe. This dual intergovernmental and inter-parliamentary structure was later copied for the [[European Communities]], [[NATO]] and the [[OSCE]].

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F023908-0002, Straßburg, Tagung des Europarates.jpg|thumb|Session of the Council of Europe's Assembly in the former [[Palace of Europe|House of Europe]] in Strasbourg in 1967]]
The Council of Europe was founded on 5 May 1949 by the [[Treaty of London (1949)|Treaty of London]]. The Treaty of London or the Statute of the Council of Europe was signed in London on that day by ten states: Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Many other states followed, especially after the democratic transitions in central and eastern Europe during the early 1990s, and the Council of Europe now includes all European states except [[Belarus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;applicant&quot;&gt;See [[#applicant|Applicants section]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kazakhstan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;applicant&quot;/&gt; [[Vatican City]]&lt;ref&gt;The Holy See is [[#Observers|currently observer]] to the [[Committee of Ministers|CoE Committee of Ministers]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Including [[Kosovo]] - {{Kosovo-note}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims and achievements ==
[[File:Flags in front of Council of Europe 2.JPG|right|thumb|Japanese flag in front of Council of Europe following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]]]]
Article 1(a) of the Statute states that &quot;''The aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage and facilitating their economic and social progress.''&quot; Therefore, membership is open to all European states which seek [[European integration]], accept the principle of the [[rule of law]] and are able and willing to guarantee [[democracy]], fundamental [[human rights]] and [[Freedom (political)|freedoms]].

While the member states of the [[European Union]] transfer national legislative and executive powers to the [[European Commission]] and the [[European Parliament]] in specific areas under [[European Community law]], Council of Europe member states maintain their sovereignty but commit themselves through conventions (i.e. [[public international law]]) and co-operate on the basis of common values and common political decisions. Those conventions and decisions are developed by the member states working together at the Council of Europe, whereas secondary European Community law is set by the organs of the European Union. Both organisations function as concentric circles around the common foundations for [[European integration]], with the Council of Europe being the geographically wider circle. The European Union could be seen as the smaller circle with a much higher level of integration through the transfer of powers from the national to the EU level. Being part of public international law, Council of Europe conventions could also be opened for signature to non-member states thus facilitating equal co-operation with countries outside Europe (see chapter below).

The Council of Europe's most famous achievement is the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which was adopted in 1950 following a report by the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly. The Convention created the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in Strasbourg. The Court supervises compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and thus functions as the highest European court for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is to this court that Europeans can bring cases if they believe that a member country has violated their fundamental rights.

The wide activities and achievements of the Council of Europe can be found in detail on its official website. In a nutshell, the Council of Europe works in the following areas:
* Protection of the [[rule of law]] and fostering legal co-operation through some 200 conventions and other treaties, including such leading instruments as the [[Convention on Cybercrime]], the [[Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism|Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism]], the [[Conventions against Corruption and Organised Crime]], the [[Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings]], and the [[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine|Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=164&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=9/4/2007&amp;CL=ENG|title=Council of Europe Convention for the protection of Human Rights and dignity of the human being with regard to the application of biology and medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[CODEXTER]], designed to co-ordinate counter-terrorism measures
* [[The European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ)]]
* Protection of [[human rights]], notably through:

** minority rights under the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]]
** [[Freedom of the press|Media freedom]] under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Convention on Transfrontier Television
* Protection of [[democracy]] through parliamentary scrutiny and election monitoring by its Parliamentary Assembly as well as assistance in democratic reforms, in particular by the [[Venice Commission]].
* Promotion of cultural co-operation and diversity under the Council of Europe's Cultural Convention of 1954 and several conventions on the protection of cultural heritage as well as through its Centre for Modern Languages in [[Graz]], [[Austria]], and its [[North-South Centre]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]].
* Promotion of the right to education under Article 2 of the first Protocol to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and several conventions on the recognition of university studies and diplomas (see also [[Bologna Process]] and [[Lisbon Recognition Convention]]).
* Promotion of fair sport through the [[Anti-Doping]] Convention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=135&amp;CM=7&amp;DF=5/21/2008&amp;CL=ENG|title=Anti-Doping Convention}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Convention against Spectator Violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=135&amp;CM=8&amp;CL=ENG|title=Anti-Doping Convention}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Promotion of European youth exchanges and co-operation through European Youth Centres in [[Strasbourg]] and [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]].
* Promotion of the quality of medicines throughout Europe by the [[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]] and its [[European Pharmacopoeia]].

The current Secretary General is the former [[Prime Minister of Norway]], [[Thorbjørn Jagland]], who took office on 1 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

|accessdate=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Council of Europe Committee of Ministers|Committee of Ministers]], comprising the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of all 47 member states who are represented by their [[Ministers Deputies|Permanent Representatives and Ambassadors]] accredited to the Council of Europe. Committee of Ministers' presidencies are held in alphabetical order for six months following the English alphabet: [[Turkey]] 11/2010-05/2011, [[Ukraine]] 05/2011-11/2011, the [[United Kingdom]] 11/2011-05/2012, [[Albania]] 05/2012-11/2012, [[Andorra]] 11/2012-05/2013, [[Armenia]] 05/2013-11/2013, [[Austria]] 11/2013-05/2014, and so on.
* The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] (PACE), which comprises national parliamentarians from all member states and elects its President for a year with the possibility of being re-elected for another year. In January 2010, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu from [[Turkey]] was elected President of the Parliamentary Assembly. National parliamentary delegations to the Assembly must reflect the political spectrum of their national parliament, i.e. comprise government and opposition parties. The Assembly appoints members as rapporteurs with the mandate to prepare parliamentary reports on specific subjects. The British MP [[Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe]] was rapporteur for the drafting of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. [[Dick Marty]]'s reports on secret [[CIA]] detentions and rendition flights in Europe became quite famous in 2007. Other Assembly rapporteurs were instrumental in, for example, the abolition of the death penalty in Europe, the political and human rights situation in [[Chechnya]], disappeared persons in [[Belarus]], freedom of expression in the media and many other subjects.
* The [[Congress of the Council of Europe]] (Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe), which was created in 1994 and comprises political representatives from local and regional authorities in all member states. The most influential instruments of the Council of Europe in this field are the [[European Charter of Local Self-Government]] of 1985 and the European Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation between Territorial Communities or Authorities of 1980.
* The [[European Court of Human Rights]], created under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] of 1950, is composed of a judge from each member state elected for a renewable term of six years by the [[Parliamentary Assembly]] and is headed by the elected President of the Court. Since 2007, Jean-Paul Costa from France is the President of the Court. Under the new Protocol No. 14 to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the terms of office of judges shall be nine years but non-renewable. Ratification of Protocol No. 14 was delayed by Russia for a number of years, but won support to be passed in January 2010.
* The [[Commissioner for Human Rights]], who is elected by the [[Parliamentary Assembly]] for a non-renewable term of six years since the creation of this position in 1999. This position is held since 2006 by [[Thomas Hammarberg]] from Sweden.
* The [http://www.coe.int/T/NGO/default_en.asp Conference of INGOs.] NGOs ([[NGOs]]) can participate in the [[INGOs Conference of the Council of Europe]]. Since the [Resolution (2003)8] adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 19 November 2003, they are given a &quot;participatory status&quot;.
* Information Offices of the Council of Europe in many member states.

[[File:EU-FR-AL-67@Strasbourg-Pharmacopée européenne 01.jpg|thumb|[[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]].]]

The CoE system also includes a number of semi-autonomous structures known as &quot;[[Partial Agreement]]s&quot;, some of which are also open to non-member states:
* The [[Council of Europe Development Bank]] in [[Paris]]
* The [[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]] with its [[European Pharmacopoeia]]
* The [[European Audiovisual Observatory]]
* The European Support Fund ''[[Eurimages]]'' for the co-production and distribution of films
* The [[Pompidou Group]] - Cooperation Group to Combat Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in Drugs
* The European Commission for Democracy through Law, better known as the [[Venice Commission]]
* The [[Group of States Against Corruption]] (GRECO)
* The European and Mediterranean [[EUR-OPA Major Hazards Agreement|Major Hazards Agreement (EUR-OPA)]] which is a platform for co-operation between European and Southern Mediterranean countries in the field of major natural and technological disasters.
* The Enlarged Partial Agreement on Sport, which is open to accession by states and sport associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Enlarged Partial Agreement on Sport |publisher=Council of Europe|url=http://www.coe.int/t/DG4/EPAS/default_en.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[North-South Centre]] of the Council of Europe in [[Lisbon]] (Portugal)
* The Centre for Modern Languages is in [[Graz]] (Austria)

=== Headquarters and buildings ===
{{See also|European Institutions in Strasbourg}}
[[File:Council of Europe Palais de l'Europe aerial view.JPG|thumb|Aerial shot of the [[Palace of Europe|Palais de l'Europe]] in Strasbourg]]
The seat of the Council of Europe is in [[Strasbourg]], France. First meetings were held in Strasbourg's [[University of Strasbourg|University]] Palace in 1949, but the Council of Europe soon moved into its own buildings. The Council of Europe's eight main buildings are situated in the ''Quartier européen'', an area in the north-east of Strasbourg spread over the three districts of Le Wacken, La Robertsau and Quartier de l'Orangerie, where are also located the four buildings of the [[seat of the European Parliament in Strasbourg]], the [[Arte]] headquarters and the seat of the [[International Institute of Human Rights]].

Building in the area started in 1949 with the predecessor of the Palais de l'Europe, the House of Europe (demolished in 1977), and came to a provisional end in 2007 with the opening of the New General Office Building in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.coe.int/t/DC/Press/Source/PressFile_%20AGORA_fr.pdf | date = 30 January 2008 | language = French |title=Inauguration of the Agora Building | publisher = Council of Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Palais de l'Europe ([[Palace of Europe]]) and the [[Art Nouveau]] Villa Schutzenberger (seat of the [[European Audiovisual Observatory]]) are in the Orangerie district, and the [[European Court of Human Rights]], the [[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]] and the Agora Building are in the Robertsau district. The Agora building has been voted &quot;best international business center real estate project of 2007&quot; on 13 March 2008, at the [[MIPIM]] 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mipim.com/App/homepage.cfm?appname=100517&amp;moduleid=288&amp;campaignid=11888&amp;iUserCampaignID=43827991 |title=2008 List of MIPIM winners}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Youth Centre is located in the Wacken district.

Besides its headquarters in Strasbourg, the Council of Europe is also present in other cities and countries. The Council of Europe Development Bank has its seat in Paris, the [[North-South Centre]] of the Council of Europe is established in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], and the Centre for Modern Languages is in [[Graz]], [[Austria]]. There are [[European Youth Centres]] in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], and in Strasbourg. The European Wergeland Centre, a new Resource Centre on education for intercultural dialogue, human rights and democratic citizenship, operated in cooperation with the Norwegian Government, opened in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title =European Wergeland Centre |url=http://www.theewc.org/about-the-ewc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of Europe has offices in [[Albania]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Moldova]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], and [[Ukraine]]; information offices in Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, [[Bulgaria]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], Georgia, [[Hungary]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], Moldova, [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Russian Federation]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], and Ukraine; and a projects office in [[Turkey]]. All these offices are establishments of the Council of Europe and they share its juridical personality with privileges and immunities.

Due to persistent budgetary shortages, the Council of Europe is expected to cut down significantly the number of its activities, and thus the number of its employees, from 2011 on. This will notably affect the economy of the city of Strasbourg, where a total of 2,321 people (on 1 January 2010) are doing salary work for the CoE. Most offices in foreign countries are expected to be closed as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lalsace.fr/fr/france-monde/article/3340157,218/Reduction-drastique-des-activites-a-Strasbourg.html |title=Conseil de l'Europe - Réduction drastique des activités à Strasbourg | location = Mulhouse |date=19 June 2010 |work=L'Alsace |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbols ==
{{Main|Symbols of Europe|Flag of Europe}}
[[File:European flag in the wind.jpg|thumb|The [[Flag of Europe]]]]

The Council of Europe created and uses as its official symbols the famous [[European Flag]] with 12 golden stars arranged in a circle on a blue background since 1955, and the [[European Anthem]] based on the [[Ode to Joy]] in the final movement of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth symphony]] since 1972.

On 5 May 1964, the 15th anniversary of its founding, the Council of Europe established 5 May as [[Europe Day]].&lt;ref name=&quot;symbols&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title =Flag, anthem and logo: the Council of Europe's symbols|publisher=Council of Europe|url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/About_Coe/emblems/emblemes.asp|accessdate = 5 August 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080731041722/http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/About_Coe/emblems/emblemes.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although protected by copyright, the wide private and public use of the European Flag is encouraged to symbolise a European dimension. To avoid confusion with the [[European Union]] which subsequently adopted the same flag in the 1980s, as well as other European institutions, the Council of Europe often uses a modified version with a lower-case 'e' in the centre of the stars which is referred to as the &quot;Council of Europe Logo&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;symbols&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =Logo of the Council of Europe|publisher=Council of Europe|url=http://www.coe.int/02/Logo/Pictures/LogoCoE/LogoCoe.jpg|accessdate = 5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership, observers, partners ==
{{Main|Member states of the Council of Europe}}
The Council of Europe was founded on 5 May 1949 by [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] joined three months later, and [[Iceland]] and [[Germany]] the next year. It now has 47 member states, with [[Montenegro]] being the latest to join.

Article 4 of the Council of Europe Statute specifies that membership is open to any &quot;European&quot; State. This has been interpreted liberally from the beginning (when Turkey was admitted) to include any [[Geography of Europe#Countries bordering or spanning another continent|Eurasian state with a toe-hold in Europe]].

As a result, nearly all [[List of European countries and territories|European states]] have acceded to the Council of Europe, with the exception of [[Belarus]] ([[Human rights in Belarus|human rights concerns]]), [[Kazakhstan]]&lt;ref&gt;II General information, point 11 on Council of Europe document 11007 dated 7 July 2006 at http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc06/EDOC11007.htm&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Human rights in Kazakhstan|human rights concerns]]{{reference necessary|/not sufficient democratization|date=November 2010}}), [[Vatican City]] (a [[theocracy]]) and the [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited recognition]].

Besides the status of full member the Council of Europe has established [[Member states of the Council of Europe|other instruments for cooperation and participation]] of non-member states: observer, applicant, special guest, partner for democracy.

== Co-operation ==
=== Non-member states ===
[[File:CoE conventions external invitations.png|thumb|250px|{{legend|#0000ff|Council of Europe members}}{{legend|#00ff00|Non-members invited to sign conventions}}]]

The Council of Europe works mainly through conventions. By drafting conventions or international treaties, common legal standards are set for its member states. However, several conventions have also been opened for signature to non-member states. Important examples are the [[Convention on Cybercrime]] (signed for example, by [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United States]]), the [[Lisbon Recognition Convention]] on the recognition of study periods and degrees (signed for example, by [[Australia]], [[Belarus]], [[Canada]], the [[Holy See]], [[Israel]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[USA]]), the Anti-[[Doping (sport)|doping]] Convention (signed for example, by [[Australia]], [[Belarus]], [[Canada]] and [[Tunisia]]) and the [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats]] (signed for example, by [[Burkina Faso]], [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Senegal]] as well as the [[European Community]]). Non-member states also participate in several partial agreements, such as the [[Venice Commission]], the [[Group of States Against Corruption]] GRECO, the [[European Pharmacopoeia]] Commission and the [[North-South Centre]].

Invitations to sign and ratify relevant conventions of the Council of Europe on a case-by-case basis are sent to three groups of non-member entities&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheNonMembres.asp?CM=14&amp;CL=ENG CoE Conventions]&lt;/ref&gt;:
* Non-European states: [[Algeria]], [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Bahamas]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Chile]], [[China]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[South Korea]], [[Kyrgystan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mauritius]], [[Morocco]], [[New Zealand]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Philippines]], [[Senegal]], [[South Africa]], [[Syria]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Tonga]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Tunisia]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]] and the observers [[Canada]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], [[United States]].
* European states: [[Kazakhstan]], [[Belarus]] and the observer [[Vatican City]].
* the [[European Community]] and later the [[European Union]] after its [[legal personality]] was established by the ratification of the EU's [[Lisbon Treaty]].

=== European Union ===
==== Relations in general between the CoE and the EU ====
{{See also|Relationship between the European Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights}}
{{Supranational European Bodies|size=500px|align=right}}
As mentioned in the introduction, it is important to realise that the Council of Europe is not to be mistaken with the [[Council of the European Union]] (the &quot;Council of Ministers&quot;) or the [[European Council]]. These belong to the [[European Union]], which is separate from the Council of Europe, although they have shared the same European flag and anthem since the 1980s because they also work for [[European integration]].

Cooperation between the [[European Union]] and the Council of Europe has recently been reinforced, notably on culture and education as well as on the international enforcement of justice and Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Council of Europe and the European Union sign an agreement to foster mutual cooperation|date=23 May 2007|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=PR331(2007)&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original&amp;BackColorInternet=F5CA75&amp;BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&amp;BackColorLogged=A9BACE&amp;ShowBanner=no&amp;Target=_self|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate = 5 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union is expected to accede to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (the Convention). There are also concerns about consistency in case law - the [[European Court of Justice]] (the EU's court in [[Luxembourg]]) is treating the Convention as part of the legal system of all [[Member states of the European Union|EU member states]] in order to prevent conflict between its judgements and those of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (the court in [[Strasbourg]] interpreting the Convention). Protocol No.14 of the Convention is designed to allow the EU to accede to it and the EU [[Treaty of Lisbon]] contains a protocol binding the EU to join. The EU would thus be subject to its human rights law and external monitoring as its member states currently are.&lt;ref name=&quot;Juncker Council&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Juncker|first=Jean-Claude|authorlink=Jean-Claude Juncker|title =Council of Europe - European Union: &quot;A sole ambition for the European continent&quot;|year=2006|publisher=Council of Europe|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Sessions/2006/speeches/20060411_report_JCJuncker_EN.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 5 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reform Draft&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title =Draft treaty modifying the treaty on the European Union and the treaty establishing the European community|date=24 July 2007|publisher=[[Open Europe]]|url=http://www.openeurope.org.uk/research/translation.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 5 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations ===
The Council of Europe holds observer status with the [[United Nations]] and is regularly represented in the UN General Assembly. It has organised the regional UN conferences against racism and on women and co-operates with the United Nations at many levels, in particular in the areas of human rights, minorities, migration and counter-terrorism.

=== Non-governmental Organisations ===
Non-governmental Organisations ([[NGOs]]) can participate in the [[INGOs Conference of the Council of Europe]] and become observers to inter-governmental committees of experts. The Council of Europe drafted the European Convention on the Recognition of the Legal Personality of International Non-Governmental Organisations in 1986, which sets the legal basis for the existence and work of NGOs in Europe. Article 11 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] protects the right to freedom of association, which is also a fundamental norm for NGOs. The rules for [[Consultative Status]] for INGOs appended to the resolution (93)38 &quot;On relation between the Council of Europe and [[international nongovernmental organizations|non-governmental organisations]]&quot;, adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 18 October 1993 at the 500th meeting of the Ministers' Deputies.
On 19 November 2003 the Committee of Ministers changed the consultative status into a participatory status [https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=Res%282003%298&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383 (Resolution Res (2003)8)]“considering that it is indispensable that the rules governing the relations between the Council of Europe and NGOs evolve to reflect the active participation of international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) in the Organisation's policy and work programme”.

The '''Council of the European Union''' (officially the '''Council''' and commonly referred to as the '''Council of Ministers''') is the [[Institutions of the European Union|institution]] in the [[Legislature of the European Union|legislature]] of the [[European Union]] (EU) representing the governments of [[Member State of the European Union|member states]], the other legislative body being the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Legislative power&quot;/&gt; The Council is composed of twenty-seven [[Minister (government)|national ministers]] (one per [[Member State of the European Union|state]]). The exact membership depends upon the topic; for example, when discussing [[Common Agricultural Policy|agricultural policy]] the Council is formed by the twenty-seven national ministers whose portfolio includes this policy area (with the related [[European Commissioner]] contributing but not voting).

The [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency]] of the Council rotates every six months between the governments of EU member states, with the relevant minister of the respective country holding the Presidency at any given time ensuring the smooth running of the meetings and setting the daily agenda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Consilium - Council&quot;/&gt; The continuity between presidencies is provided by an arrangement under which three successive presidencies, known as ''Presidency trios'', share common political programmes. The [[Foreign Affairs Council]] (national foreign ministers) is however chaired by the Union's [[High Representative]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Const Info&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The Union's institutions: The Council of Ministers|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/council_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council is administered by the [[Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union|Council's Secretary General]].

Its decisions are made by [[qualified majority voting]] in some areas, unanimity in others. Usually where it operates unanimously, it need only consult the Parliament. However, in most areas the [[Legislature of the European Union#Ordinary legislative procedure|ordinary legislative procedure]] applies meaning both Council and Parliament share legislative and budgetary powers equally. In a few limited areas the Council may initiate new [[Law of the European Union|EU law]] itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Consilium - Council&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|title = Council of the European Union|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?lang=EN|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council first appeared in the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) as the &quot;Special Council of Ministers&quot;, set up to counterbalance the High Authority (the supranational executive, now the Commission). The original Council had limited powers as issues relating only to coal and steel were in the Authority's domain, whereas the Council only had to give its consent to decisions outside coal and steel. As a whole, it only scrutinised the [[High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community|High Authority]] (the [[Executive (government)|executive]]). In 1957, the [[Treaties of Rome]] established two new communities, and with them two new Councils: the Council of the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (EAEC) and the Council of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC). However due to objections over the supranational power of the Authority, their Councils had more executive powers with the new executive bodies being known as &quot;Commissions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[European NAvigator]]|title = Council of the European Union|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&amp;doc=5604|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the Council was hit by the &quot;empty chair crisis&quot;. Due to disagreements between [[French President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] and the Commission's agriculture proposals, among other things, France boycotted all meetings of the Council bringing work to a halt until it was resolved the following year by the [[Luxembourg compromise]]. Although initiated by a gamble of then-President [[Walter Hallstein]], who lost the Presidency after the crisis, it exposed flaws in the Council's workings.&lt;ref name=&quot;LSE Chair&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Ludlow|first=N|year=2006|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|title = De-commissioning the Empty Chair Crisis : the Community institutions and the crisis of 1965-6|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2422/01/Decommisioningempty.pdf|accessdate = 2007-09-24|format=PDF|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071025203706/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2422/01/Decommisioningempty.pdf |archivedate = October 25, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Merger Treaty]] of 1967, the ECSC's Special Council of Ministers and the Council of the EAEC (together with their other independent institutions) were merged into the Council of the EEC which would act as a single Council of the [[European Communities]]. In 1993, the Council adopted the name 'Council of the European Union', following the establishment of the European Union by the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. That treaty strengthened the Council with the addition of more intergovernmental elements in the [[Three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]] system. However, at the same time the Parliament and Commission had been strengthened inside the [[European Community|Community pillar]] curbing the ability of the Council to act independently.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA history&quot;/&gt;

The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] abolished the pillar system and gave further powers to Parliament. It also merged the Council's [[High Representative]] with the [[European Commissioner for External Relations|Commission's foreign policy head]], with this new figure chairing the foreign affair's Council rather than the rotating presidency. The [[European Council]] was declared a separate institution from the Council, also chaired by a permanent president, and the different Council configurations were mentioned in the treaties for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Const Info&quot;/&gt; Finally, Lisbon gave the Commission its executive powers directly{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} rather than have it delegated by the Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[European NAvigator]]|title = Implementing powers of the Council of the European Union|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&amp;doc=5625|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CP app&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = European Commission|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the Council has been characterised by the rise in power of the Parliament as, while the Council has not lost power, the Parliament has provided a greater and greater opposition to the Council's wishes. This has in some cases led to clashes between the two bodies with the Council's system of intergovernmentalism contradicting the developing parliamentary system and supranational principles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoskyns&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Hoskyns | first = Catherine | coauthors = Michael Newman | title = Democratizing the European Union: Issues for the twenty-first Century (Perspectives on Democratization | publisher = [[Manchester University Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0719056666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Powers and functions ==
The primary purpose of the Council is to act as one of the two chambers of the [[Legislature of the European Union|EU's legislative branch]], the other chamber being the [[European Parliament]]. However the Council only has [[legislative initiative]] in limited sensitive areas. It also holds, jointly with the Parliament, the budgetary power of the Union and has greater control than the Parliament over the intergovernmental areas of the EU. Finally, before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, it formally held the executive power of the EU which it conferred upon the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Treaty&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Treaty on the European Union (Nice consolidated version)|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf|accessdate = 2007-06-24|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=January 2010}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Legislative power&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|title=Legislative power|url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&amp;pageRank=2&amp;language=EN|accessdate = 2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=January 2010}}

[[File:Ordinary legislative procedure majorityrules.svg|thumb|300px|Simplified illustration of the voting rules that apply within the ordinary legislative procedure. The actual procedure involves various stages of consultations aimed at achieving compromise between the positions of the two legislative chambers.]]
The EU's legislative authority is divided between the Council and the Parliament. As the relationships and powers of these institutions have developed, various legislative procedures have been created for adopting laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legislative power&quot;/&gt; The vast majority of laws are subject to the [[Legislature of the European Union#Ordinary legislative procedure|ordinary legislative procedure]], which works on the principle that consent from both the Council and Parliament are required before a law may be adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = The Codecision Procedure|url=http://ec.europa.eu/codecision/procedure/index_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council. Following its first [[Reading (legislature)|reading]] the Parliament may propose amendments. If the Council accepts these amendments then the legislation is approved. If it does not then it adopts a &quot;common position&quot; and submits that new version to the Parliament. At its second reading, if the Parliament approves the text or does not act, the text is adopted, otherwise the Parliament may propose further amendments to the Council's proposal. It may be rejected out right by an [[absolute majority]] of MEPs. If the Council still does not approve the Parliament's position, then the text is taken to a &quot;C
