[[Image:Playing acoustic guitar.jpg|thumb|Playing a steel-string guitar without a pick ([[fingerpicking]]).]]
A '''steel-string acoustic guitar''' is a modern form of [[guitar]] descended from the [[classical guitar]], but strung with steel strings for a brighter, louder sound. It is often referred to simply as an '''[[acoustic guitar]]''', although strictly speaking the nylon-strung classical guitar is acoustic as well.

The most common type can be called a [[flat-top guitar]] to distinguish it from the more specialized [[archtop guitar]] and other variations.

The [[Standard tuning#Plucked strings|standard tuning]] for an acoustic guitar is E-A-D-G-B-E (low to high), although many players, particularly fingerpickers, use alternate tunings ([[scordatura]]), such as &quot;open G&quot; (D-G-D-G-B-D), &quot;[[open D tuning|open D]]&quot; (D-A-D-F{{music|sharp}}-A-D), or &quot;drop D&quot; (D-A-D-G-B-E).

== Construction ==
There are many different variations on the construction of, and materials used in, steel-string guitars. The various combinations of the different woods and their quality, along with design and construction elements (for example, how the top is braced), are among the factors affecting the [[timbre]] or &quot;tone&quot; of the guitar. Many players and [[luthier]]s feel a well-made guitar's tone improves over time.

=== Styles ===
Acoustic guitars are commonly constructed in several different body shapes. In general, the guitar's soundbox can be thought of as being composed of two connected chambers: the &quot;upper bout&quot; and &quot;lower bout&quot;, which meet at the &quot;waist&quot;, or the narrowest part of the body face near the soundhole. The proportion and overall size of these two parts helps determine the overall tonal balance and &quot;native sound&quot; of a particular body style – the larger the body, the louder the volume.

* A '''&quot;00&quot;''', '''&quot;Double-Oh&quot;''' or '''&quot;Grand Concert&quot;''' body style is the major body style most directly derived from the classical guitar. It has the thinnest soundbox and the smallest overall size of the major styles, making it very comfortable to play but also one of the quietest. Its smaller size makes it suitable for younger or smaller-framed players. These guitars are commonly called &quot;parlor steels&quot; as they are well-suited to smaller rooms. [[C. F. Martin &amp; Company|Martin]]'s 00-xxx series and Taylor's GC series are common examples.
* A '''&quot;Grand Auditorium&quot;''' (GA) guitar, sometimes called a ''&quot;000&quot;'' or ''&quot;Triple-Oh&quot;'', is very similar in design to the Grand Concert, but slightly wider and deeper. Many GA-style guitars also have a convex back panel to increase the volume of space in the soundbox without making the soundbox deeper at the edges, which would affect comfort and playability. The result is a very balanced tone, comparable to the 00 but with greater volume and dynamic range and slightly more low-end response, without sacrificing the ergonomics of the classical style, making these body styles very popular. [[Eric Clapton]]'s signature Martin guitar, for example, is of this style. [[Taylor Guitars|Taylor]]'s GA and x14 series and Martin's 000-xxx series are well-known examples of the Grand Auditorium style.
* A '''&quot;Dreadnought&quot;''', arguably the most common body style, incorporates a deeper soundbox, but a smaller and less-pronounced upper bout (the area of the soundbox between the waist and neck) than most styles, giving a somewhat wedge-shaped appearance – hence its name, relating to a class of warship. The dreadnought style was designed by [[Martin Guitars]]&lt;ref name=&quot;sweetwater1&quot;&gt;http://www.sweetwater.com/shop/guitars/acoustic/buying-guide.php Sweetwater Music - Acoustic Guitar Buying Guide&lt;/ref&gt; to produce a deeper sound than &quot;classic&quot;-style guitars, with very present bass fundamentals. This body style's combination of a small profile with a deep sound has made it immensely popular, and it has since been copied by virtually every major steel-string luthier. [[Martin Guitars|Martin]]'s &quot;D&quot; series such as the D-28 are classic examples of the dreadnought.
* A '''&quot;Jumbo&quot;''' body style is bigger again than a Grand Auditorium but similarly proportioned, and is generally designed to provide a deeper tone, similar to a dreadnought (the body style was designed by Gibson to compete with the dreadnought&lt;ref name=&quot;sweetwater1&quot;/&gt;) but with maximum resonant space for greater volume and sustain. This comes at the expense of being oversized, with a very deep sounding box, and thus somewhat more difficult to play. The foremost example of this style is the [[Gibson J-200]], but like the dreadnought, most guitar manufacturers have at least one jumbo model.

Any of these body styles can optionally incorporate a &quot;[[cutaway (guitar)|cutaway]]&quot;. A cutaway guitar has a redesigned upper bout that removes a section of the soundbox on the underside of the neck, hence the name &quot;cutaway&quot;. This allows for easier access to the frets that are located on top of the soundbox past the heel of the neck. The tradeoff is reduced soundbox volume, and often a change in bracing, which can change the resonant qualities and hence the tone of the instrument.

Another variation on the standard acoustic guitar is the [[12-string guitar]], which sports an additional, doubling string for each of the traditional six strings. This guitar was made famous by artists such as [[Lead Belly]], [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Leo Kottke]].

All of the above guitars are relatively traditional in looks and construction, and are commonly referred to as &quot;flattop&quot; guitars. All are commonly seen and heard in popular music genres, including [[rock (music)|rock]], [[blues]], [[country (music)|country]], and [[folk (music)|folk]]. However, other styles of guitar have been introduced and enjoy moderate popularity, generally in more specific genres:
* The '''[[archtop guitar]]''' incorporates a top, either carved out of solid wood or heat-pressed using laminations, that is arched like instruments in the [[violin family]], usually with an f-hole rather than a round sound hole. These guitars are most commonly used by [[swing (genre)|swing]] and [[jazz]] players and often incorporate electronics in the form of a [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]]. However, many other kinds of acoustic guitars may incorporate these kinds of electronics as well.
* The '''&quot;[[Selmer-Maccaferri guitar]]&quot;''' is usually played by those who follow the style of [[Django Reinhardt]]. It is an unusual-looking instrument, distinguished by a fairly large body with squarish bouts, and either a &quot;D&quot;-shaped or longitudinal oval soundhole. The strings are gathered at the tail like an archtop guitar, but the top is flatter. It also has a wide fingerboard and slotted head like a nylon-string guitar. The loud volume and penetrating tone make it suitable for single-note [[guitar solo|soloing]], and it is frequently employed as a [[lead guitar|lead instrument]] in [[gypsy swing]].
* The [[resonator guitar]] or [[resophonic guitar]] produces sound with one or more metal cones (resonators) instead of the wooden soundboard (guitar top/face). Resonator guitars were originally designed to be louder than conventional acoustic guitars, which were overwhelmed by horns and percussion instruments in dance orchestras. They became prized for their distinctive sound, however, and found life with several musical styles (most notably bluegrass and also blues) well after electric amplification solved the issue of inadequate guitar sound levels.

=== Tonewoods ===
Traditionally, steel-string guitars have been made of a combination of various &quot;[[tonewood]]s&quot;, or woods that have pleasing resonant qualities when used in instrument-making. Foremost are [[Sitka spruce]], the most common, and Alpine and Adirondack spruce, the most sought-after, woods for the making of guitar tops. The back and sides of a particular guitar are typically made of the same wood; Brazilian or East Indian [[rosewood]] and Honduras [[mahogany]] are traditional choices, however, [[maple]] has been prized for the figuring that can be seen when it is cut in a certain way (such as &quot;flame&quot; and &quot;quilt&quot; patterns). A common non-traditional wood gaining popularity is [[sapele]], which is tonally similar to mahogany but slightly lighter in color and possessing a deep grain structure that is visually appealing. 

Due to decreasing availability and rising prices of premium-quality traditional [[tonewood]]s, many manufacturers have begun experimenting with alternative species of woods or more commonly available variations on the standard species. For example, some makers have begun producing models with [[Thuja plicata|redcedar]] or mahogany tops, or with [[spruce]] variants other than Sitka. Cedar is also common in the back and sides, as is [[basswood]]. Entry-level models, especially those made in East Asia, often use [[nato wood]], which is again tonally similar to mahogany but is cheap to acquire. Some have also begun using non-wood materials, such as [[plastic]] or [[graphite]]. Carbon-fiber and phenolic composite materials have become desirable for building necks, and at least one high-end luthier ([[Composite Acoustics]]) produces a line of all-carbon-fiber guitars, prized for their high stability in changing climates that would cause wood instrument panels to swell and shrink.

[[Image:Taylor415 acoustic.JPG|thumb|right|Taylor steel-string guitar.]]

=== Assembly ===
The steel-string acoustic guitar evolved from the nylon- or gut-string classical guitar, and because steel strings have higher tension, heavier construction is required overall. One innovation is a metal bar called a [[guitar#Truss rod|truss rod]], which is incorporated into the neck to strengthen it and provide adjustable counter-tension to the stress of the strings. Typically, a steel-string acoustic guitar is built with a larger soundbox than a standard classical guitar. A critical structural and tonal component of an acoustic guitar is the [[Guitar bracing|bracing]], a systems of struts glued to the inside of the back and top. Steel-string guitars use different bracing systems from classical guitars, typically using X-bracing instead of fan bracing. (Another simpler system, called ladder bracing, where the braces are all placed across the width of the instrument, is used on all types of flat-top guitars on the back.) Innovations in bracing design have emerged, notably the A-brace developed by British luthier Roger Bucknall of Fylde Guitars.

Most [[luthier]]s and experienced players agree that a good solid top (as opposed to laminated or [[plywood]]) is the most important factor in the tone of the guitar. Solid backs and sides can also contribute to a pleasant sound, although laminated sides and backs are acceptable alternatives, commonly found in mid-level guitars (in the range of US$300–$1000). 

A unique construction method is that of [[Ovation Guitar Company]], which uses a rounded one-piece composite plastic bowl for the back and sides of virtually all of its guitars (the top and neck are usually still wood, though newer models have introduced [[Phenolic resin|phenolic]] necks). The resulting instrument is relatively durable, and the materials costs and luthier's labor drastically reduced; however, the tone of such a guitar is different from one with an all-wood soundbox.

Electronics, such as [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]] systems and electronic tuners, may be installed in modern instruments.

''See [[Guitar]] for more details on the construction of acoustic guitars.''

=== Guitar makers ===
Guitars can be factory-built or made in smaller operations focusing on handcrafting and tailoring to individual customers' requirements. The latter are often referred to as [[luthiers]].

There are several prominent [[United States|American]] makers of steel-string acoustic guitars. [[Breedlove]], [[Collings Guitars|Collings]], [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]], [[Fender]], [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]], [[Martin Guitars|Martin]], [[Santa Cruz Guitar Company|Santa Cruz]] and [[Taylor Guitars|Taylor]] are known for both the quality and price of their instruments. Other less-recognized but popular North American luthier shops include [[Godin (guitar manufacturer)|Godin]] and [[Larrivée (guitar company)|Larrivée]], both based in Canada. In Europe, several steel-string acoustic guitar makers have gained a worldwide reputation, although their production output is small relative to U.S. and Asian makers. Among the leading European brands are [[Avalon Guitars|Avalon]], [[Brook Guitars|Brook]], [[Lakewood Guitars|Lakewood]] and [[Tanglewood Guitars|Tanglewood]].

Many prominent, quality East Asian brands have been introduced to the U.S. and are popular with players of many skill levels. [[Yamaha]] produces a large assortment of musical instruments; while [[Ibanez]], [[Ovation Guitar Company|Ovation]] and [[Takamine Guitars|Takamine]] are other popular Korean/Japanese companies which specialize in guitar-making. [[Alvarez Guitars]], another quality brand, are made in China or Japan. In addition, many traditionally U.S.-centered brands have outsourced the production of their low-cost models to Asian firms: Fender/Squier and Gibson/Epiphone all own or contract with Asian factories to produce many of their entry-level and even intermediate-level instruments.

In Australia top-end guitars are manufactured by [[Cole Clark]] and [[Maton]].

== Amplification ==
A steel-string guitar can be amplified with a:
* [[microphone]], possibly clipped to the guitar body;
* detachable [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]], often straddling the soundhole and using the same magnetic principle as a traditional electric guitar; or
* [[transducer]] built into the body.

The last type of guitar is commonly called an &quot;acoustic-electric&quot; or &quot;[[electro-acoustic guitar|electro-acoustic]]&quot; guitar, as it can be played either &quot;unplugged&quot; as an acoustic or plugged in as an electric. The most common type is a [[piezoelectric pickup]], which is composed of a thin sandwich of quartz crystal. When compressed, the crystal produces a small electrical current, so when placed under the bridge saddle, the vibrations of the strings through the saddle, and of the body of the instrument, are converted to a weak electrical signal. This signal is often sent to a [[pre-amplifier]], which increases the signal strength and normally incorporates an [[equalizer]]. The output of the preamplifier then goes to a separate amplifier system similar to that for an electric guitar.

Several manufacturers produce specialised [[acoustic guitar amplifier]]s, which are designed to give undistorted and full-range reproduction.

== Steel-string guitar music and players ==
Until the 1960s, the predominant forms of music played on the flat-top, steel-string guitar remained relatively stable and included acoustic [[blues]], [[American country music|country]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[folk music|folk]], and several genres of [[rock (music)|rock]]. The concept of playing solo steel-string guitar in a concert setting was introduced in the early 1960s by such performers as [[Davey Graham]] and [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]], who used [[country blues]] [[fingerpicking]] techniques to compose original compositions with structures somewhat like European [[European classical music|classical music]]. Fahey contemporary [[Robbie Basho]] added elements of [[Indian classical music]] and Leo Kottke used a Faheyesque approach to make the first solo steel-string guitar &quot;hit&quot; record.

Steel-string guitars are also important in the world of [[flatpicking]], as utilized by such artists as [[Clarence White]], [[Tony Rice]], [[Bryan Sutton]], [[Doc Watson]] and [[David Grier]]. Luthiers have been experimenting with redesigning the acoustic guitar for these players. These flat-top, steel-string guitars are constructed and voiced more for classical-like fingerpicking and less for chordal accompaniment (strumming). Some luthiers have increasingly focused their attention on the needs of fingerstylists and have developed unique guitars for this style of playing.

Many other luthiers attempt to recreate the guitars of the &quot;Golden Era&quot; of [[Martin Guitars|C.F. Martin &amp; Co]]. This was started by Roy Noble, who built the guitar played by Clarence White from 1968 to 1972, and was followed by Bill Collings, Marty Lanham, [[Dana Bourgeois]], Randy Lucas, Lynn Dudenbostel and [[Wayne Henderson (luthier)|Wayne Henderson]], a few of the luthiers building guitars today inspired by vintage Martins, the pre–World War II models in particular. As prices for vintage Martins continue to rise exponentially, upscale guitar enthusiasts have demanded faithful recreations and luthiers are working to fill that demand.

'''Baldassarre Cossa''' (c. 1370 – 22 December 1419) was Pope '''John XXIII''' (1410–1415) during the [[Western Schism]]. The Catholic Church regards him as an [[antipope]].

==Biography==
Baldassarre Cossa was born on the island of [[Procida]] or [[Ischia]] in the [[Kingdom of Naples]] into a noble but impoverished family. Initially he followed a military career, taking part in the [[Kingdom of Naples|Angevin-Neapolitan war]]. His two brothers were sentenced to death for [[piracy]] by [[Ladislaus of Naples]].&lt;ref name=mccabe&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph McCabe|title=Crises in the History of the Papacy|chapter=Chapter XI. John XXIII and the Great Schism|year=1916|publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EkX2JjO4V6sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA221#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780766179042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied law at the [[University of Bologna]] and obtained a doctorate. In 1392 he entered the service of [[Pope Boniface IX]], first working in Bologna and then in Rome. (The [[Western Schism]] had begun in 1378 and there were two competing popes at the time, one in Avignon supported by France and Spain, and one in Rome supported by most of Italy, Germany and England.) Cossa worked in the administration of [[simony]], the sale of church offices.&lt;ref name=mccabe/&gt; Still a member of the [[laity]], he became [[cardinal (Catholicism)#Cardinal_deacon|Cardinal deacon]] in 1402 and [[Papal legate]] in Bologna in 1403.

He was one of the seven [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s who, in May 1408, deserted [[Pope Gregory XII]], and, with those following [[Antipope Benedict XIII]] from Avignon, convened the [[Council of Pisa]], of which Cossa became the leader. The aim of the council was to end the schism; to this end they deposed Gregory XII and Benedict XIII and elected the new pope [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] in 1409. Gregory and Benedict ignored this decision however, so that there were three simultaneous popes. 

Alexander V died soon after, and on 25 May 1410 Cossa was consecrated pope, taking the name John XXIII. He had been [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|ordained priest]] only one day earlier. John XXIII was acknowledged as pope by [[France]], [[England]], [[Bohemia]], [[Prussia]], [[Portugal]], parts of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and numerous Northern Italian city states, including Florence and [[Venice]]; however, the Avignon Pope Benedict XIII was regarded as pope by the [[Kingdom of Aragon|Kingdoms of Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and Gregory XII was still favored by [[Ladislaus of Naples]], [[Carlo I Malatesta]], the [[List of rulers of Bavaria|princes of Bavaria]], [[Louis III, Elector Palatine|Louis III]], [[Electoral Palatinate|Elector Palatine]], and parts of Germany and [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, R.W. (1980) ''Donatello &amp; Michelozzo''. London: Harvey Miller. Pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[House of Medici|Medicis]] had supported Cossa in his campaign to become cardinal and pope. Once in office, John XXIII made the [[Medici Bank]] the bank of the papacy, contributing considerably to the family's wealth and prestige.

John had his officials sell [[indulgence]]s, a controversial practice that was protested in various parts of Europe, for instance by the followers of [[Jan Hus]] in [[Prague]].

The main enemy of John was [[Ladislaus of Naples]], who protected Gregory XII in Rome. Following his election as pope, John spent a year in Bologna and then  joined forces with [[Louis II of Anjou]] to march against Ladislaus. An initial victory proved short-lived and Ladislaus retook Rome in 1413, forcing John to flee to Florence.

[[File:Grabmaljohannes13.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[Tomb of Antipope John XXIII]].]]
In Florence he met [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], who had just been crowned King of Germany and who had ambitions to become [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]]. Sigismund wanted to end the schism and urged John to call 
a general council. John did so with hesitation, afraid that he could be deposed at the council. The [[Council of Constance]] was convened in November 1412. During the third session, rival [[Pope Gregory XII]] authorized the council as well. The council resolved that all three popes should abdicate and a new pope be elected. Gregory agreed and John initially did as well, but then he fled the council, hoping that without him it would lose its authority. Instead, the council deposed him and tried him for heresy, simony, schism and immorality, finding him guilty on all counts. [[Pope Martin V]] was elected, while the last remaining claimant in [[Avignon]], [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]],  was excommunicated when he refused to resign as well. 

Cossa, as he was again, was imprisoned in Germany. He was freed in 1418 after a heavy ransom had been paid. In Rome he submitted to Martin V who made him [[cardinal bishop]] of [[Tusculum]]. He went to Florence and died only a few months later.

The Medicis oversaw the construction of [[Tomb of Antipope John XXIII|his magnificent tomb]] by [[Donatello]] and [[Michelozzo]] in the [[Battistero di San Giovanni]] in Florence. Pope Martin V protested in vain against the inscription on the sarcophagus: &quot;John the former pope&quot;. 

The 1910 [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] remarks that &quot;Undeniably secular and ambitious, his moral life was not above reproach, and his unscrupulous methods in no wise accorded with the requirements of his high office ... the heinous crimes of which his opponents in the council accused him were certainly gravely exaggerated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

==Numbering issues==
{{main|Pope John (numbering)}}
He should not be confused with [[Pope John XXIII]] of the twentieth century. When [[Pope John XXIII|Angelo Cardinal Roncalli]] was elected and became Pope John, there was some confusion as to whether he would be ''John XXIII'' or ''John XXIV''; he then declared that he was John XXIII to put this question to rest. There was no [[Pope John XX|John XX]]; for example, Gibbon refers to the antipope John as John XXII.

'''Antonio Salieri''' (18 August 1750{{ndash}}7 May 1825) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[classical period (music)|classical]] [[composer]], [[Conducting|conductor]] and teacher born in [[Legnago]], south of [[Verona]], in the [[Republic of Venice]], but who spent his adult life and career as a faithful subject of the [[Habsburg]] monarchy.

Salieri was a pivotal figure in the development of late 18th-century [[opera]]. As a student of [[Florian Leopold Gassmann]], and a protege of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]], Salieri was a cosmopolitan composer who wrote operas in three languages.  Salieri helped to develop and shape many of the features of operatic compositional vocabulary and his music was a powerful influence on contemporary composers.

Appointed the director of the Italian opera by the Habsburg court, a post he held from 1774 to 1792, Salieri dominated Italian language opera in [[Vienna]].  During his career he also spent time writing works for opera houses in Venice, Rome, and Paris.  His dramatic works were widely performed throughout Europe during his lifetime. As the Austrian imperial [[Kapellmeister]] from 1788 to 1824, he was responsible for music at the court chapel and attached school. Even as his works dropped from performance, and he wrote no new operas after 1804, he still remained one of the most important and sought after teachers of his generation and his influence was felt in every aspect of Vienna's musical life.  [[Franz Schubert]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Liszt]] were among the most famous of his pupils.

Salieri's music slowly disappeared from the repertoire between 1800 and 1868, and was rarely heard after that period until the revival of his fame in the late 20th century.  This revival was due to the dramatic and highly fictionalized depiction of Salieri in the play and film ''[[Amadeus]]'' (1979, 1984), by [[Peter Shaffer]] and [[Milos Forman]] respectively.  His music today has regained some modest popularity via recordings. It is also the subject of increasing academic study and a small number of his operas have returned to the stage.  In addition there is now a Salieri Opera Festival&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teatrosalieri.it/index.asp?m0=cartellone&amp;tipo=Salieri_Opera_Festival Salieri Opera Festival] at the Teatro Salieri web site. {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsored by the Fondazione Culturale Antonio Salieri and dedicated to rediscovering his work and those of his contemporaries. It is developing as an annual autumn event in his native town of Legnago where a theater has been re-named in his honor.

==Biography==
Antonio Salieri began his musical studies in his native town of [[Legnago]]; he was first taught at home by his older brother [[Francesco Salieri]] (a former student of the violinist and composer [[Giuseppe Tartini]]), and he received further lessons from the organist of the Legnago Cathedral, Giuseppe Simoni, a pupil of Padre [[Giovanni Battista Martini]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Braunbehrens, pp. 14–15&quot;&gt;Braunbehrens, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Salieri would recall little from his childhood in later years except a passion for sugar, reading and music.  He twice ran away from home without permission to hear his elder brother play violin concertos in neighboring churches on festival days (resulting in the loss of his beloved sugar), and he also recounted being chastised by his Father after failing to greet a local priest with proper respect.  Salieri responded to the reprimand by saying that the priest's organ playing displeased him because it was in an inappropriately theatrical style.&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometime between 1763 and 1764 Salieri suffered the death of both parents and was briefly taken in by an anonymous brother, a monk in [[Padua]], and then for unknown reasons in 1765 or 1766 he became the ward of a Venetian nobleman named Giovanni Mocenigo (which Giovanni is at this time unknown), a member of the powerful and well connected [[Mocenigo family]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Braunbehrens, pp. 14–15&quot;/&gt;  It is possible that Antonio's Father and Giovanni were friends or business associates, but this is obscure.  While living in [[Venice]] Salieri continued his musical studies with the organist and opera composer [[Giovanni Battista Pescetti]], then following Pescetti’s sudden death he studied with the [[opera]] singer [[Ferdinando Pacini]] or Pasini.  It was through Pacini that Salieri gained the attention of the composer [[Florian Leopold Gassmann]], who impressed with his talents and concerned for his future, took the young orphan to [[Vienna]] where he personally directed and paid for the remainder of his musical education.&lt;ref&gt;Braunbehrens pp. 19–22&lt;/ref&gt;

Salieri and Gassmann arrived in Vienna on 15 June 1766.  Gassmann's first act was to take Salieri to the Italian Church to consecrate his teaching and service to God, an event that left a deep impression on Salieri for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, Alexander Wheelock, ed. by Albrecht, Theodore, ''Salieri: Rival of Mozart'' The Philharmonia of Greater Kansas City, Kansas City, Mo., 1989, pg. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Salieri's education included instruction in Latin and Italian poetry by Fr. [[Don Pietro Tommasi]], instruction in the [[German language]], and European literature.  His music studies revolved around vocal composition, and [[thoroughbass]].  His musical theory training in [[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]] was rooted in [[Johann Fux]]'s [[Gradus ad Parnassum]],&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, pp. 30–31, also Rice pp. 17–20&lt;/ref&gt; which Salieri translated during each Latin lesson.&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, pp. 17–20&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result Salieri continued to live with Gassmann even after Gassmann’s marriage, an arrangement that lasted until the year of Gassmann's death and Salieri's own marriage in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, pp. 19–22, and p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Few of Salieri’s compositions have survived from this early period.  In his old age Salieri hinted that these works were either purposely destroyed, or had been lost with the exception of a few works for the church.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;  Among these sacred works there survives a [[Mass]] in C major written without a &quot;Gloria&quot; and in the antique [[a cappella]] style (presumably for one of the church’s penitential seasons) and dated 2 August 1767.&lt;ref&gt;Hettrick, Jane, ed. Salieri, Antonio, Missa Stylo A Cappella, Information taken from the un-number in English Preface. [v–vii] Doblinger (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;  A complete opera composed in 1769 (presumably as a culminating study) ''[[La Vestale]]'' (&quot;The Vestal Virgin&quot;) has also been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Braunbehrens p. 26, also Rice p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1766 Gassmann introduced Salieri to the daily [[chamber music]] performances held during [[Emperor Joseph II]]'s evening meal.  Salieri quickly impressed the Emperor, and Gassmann was instructed to bring his pupil as often as he wished.&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rice, pp. 21–27&lt;/ref&gt; This was the beginning of a relationship between monarch and musician that would last until Joseph's death in 1789.  Salieri met Pietro Antonio Domenico Trapassi better known as [[Metastasio]] and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] during this period at the famous Sunday morning salons held at the home of the Martinez family.  Here Metastasio had an apartment and participated in the weekly gatherings.  Over the next several years Metastasio gave Salieri informal instruction in prosody and the declamation of Italian poetry,&lt;ref&gt;Thayer pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; and Gluck became an informal advisor, friend and confidante.&lt;ref&gt;Braunbehrens, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rice, pg. 17,21,32&lt;/ref&gt; It was toward the end of this extended period of study that Gassmann was called away on a new opera commission and a gap in the theater’s program allowed for Salieri to make his debut as a composer of a completely original opera buffa.  Salieri's first full opera was composed during the winter and carnival season of 1770; ''[[Le donne letterate]]'' and was based on [[Molière]]'s ''[[Les Femmes Savantes]]'' (&quot;The Learned Ladies&quot;) with a libretto by [[Giovanni Gastone Boccherini]] a dancer in the court ballet, and a brother of the famous composer.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, pp. 113–151 features an extensive overview of this opera&lt;/ref&gt;  The modest success of this opera would launch Salieri's 34 year operatic career as a composer of over 35 original dramas.&lt;ref&gt;Braunbehrens pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Viennese period and operas (1770–1778)===
Following the modest success of ''Le donne letterate'' Salieri received new commissions writing two additional operas in 1770 both with libretti by Boccherini. The first a pastoral opera, ''[[L'amore innocente]]'' (&quot;Innocent Love&quot;) was a light hearted comedy set in the Austrian mountains,&lt;ref&gt;Braunbehrens pp. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and the second was based on an episode from [[Cervantes]] ''[[Don Quixote]]'' – ''[[Don Chisciotte alle nozze di Gamace]]'' (&quot;Don Quixote at the Marriage of Camacho&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Rice for an extended discussion of this work, pp. 153–162&lt;/ref&gt;  In these first works, drawn mostly from the traditions of mid-century opera buffa, Salieri showed a penchant for experimentation and for mixing the established characteristics of specific operatic genres. Don Chisciotte was a mix of ballet and opera buffa, and the lead female roles in ''L'amore innocente'' were designed to contrast and highlight the different traditions of operatic writing for soprano, even borrowing stylistic flourishes from opera-seria in the use of coloratura in what was a short pastoral comedy more in keeping with a Roman [[Intermezzo]].&lt;ref&gt;See Rice for genre catagorizations of L'amore Innocente pp. 107–09, 152–53, 177.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mixing and pushing against the boundaries of established operatic genres would be a continuing hallmark of Salieri's own personal style, and in his choice of material for the plot (as in his first opera), he manifested a lifelong interest in subjects drawn from classic drama and literature.

Salieri's first great success was in the realm of serious opera.  Commissioned for an unknown occasion Salieri's ''[[Armida (Salieri)|Armida]]'' was based on [[Torquato Tasso]]'s epic poem [[La Gerusalemme liberata]] (&quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;) and premiered on 2 June 1771.&lt;ref&gt;Rice pp. 162–64.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Armida'' is a tale of love and duty in conflict and is saturated in magic. The opera is set during the [[First Crusade]] and it features a dramatic mix of ballet, aria, ensemble and choral writing combining theatricality, scenic splendor and high emotionalism.  The work clearly followed in Gluck's footsteps and embraced his reform of serious opera begun with ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' and ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]]''.  The libretto to ''Armida'' was by [[Marco Coltellini]] the house poet for the imperial theaters.   While Salieri followed the precepts set forth by Gluck and his librettist [[Ranieri de' Calzabigi]] in the preface to ''Alceste''; Salieri also drew on some musical ideas from the more traditional opera-seria and even opera buffa, creating a new synthesis in the process.  ''Armida'' was translated into German and widely performed, especially in the northern German states, where it helped to establish Salieri's reputation as an important and innovative modern composer&lt;ref&gt;Rice pp. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;  It would also be the first opera to receive a serious preparation in a piano and vocal reduction by [[Carl Friedrich Cramer]] in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Braunbehrens pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rice.pp 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Armida'' was soon followed by Salieri's first truly popular success; a commedia per musica in the style of [[Carlo Goldoni]] ''[[La fiera di Venezia]]'' (&quot;The Fair of Venice&quot;). ''La fiera'' was written for Carnival in 1772 and premiered on 29 January.  Here Salieri returned to his collaboration with the young Boccherini who crafted an original plot.  ''La fiera'' would feature characters singing in three languages, a bustling portrayal of the Ascension-tide Fair and Carnival in Venice, and large and lengthy ensembles and choruses.  It also included an innovative scene that would combine a series of on stage dances with singing from both solo protagonists and the chorus. A pattern to be imitated by later composers, most famously and successfully by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] in ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.  Salieri would also write several bravura aria's for a soprano playing the part of a middle class character that would combine coloratura and concertante woodwind solos, another innovation for a comic opera that was to be widely imitated.

Salieri's next two operas were not particular or lasting successes, of the two only ''[[La secchia rapita]]'' (&quot;The Stolen Bucket&quot;),  deserves mention.  A parody of [[Pietro Metastasio|Metastasian]] opera-seria it featured dazzling parodies of the high flown and emotive aria's found in that genre, as well as bold and innovative orchestrations, including the first known use of three tympani.  Again a classic of [[Renaissance]] literature was the basis of the libretto by Boccherini, in this case a comic mock-epic by [[Tassoni]], in which a war between [[Modena]] and [[Bologna]] ensues over a stolen bucket.  This uneven work was followed by another popular comedic success ''[[La locandiera (Salieri)|La locandiera]]'' (&quot;Mine Hostess&quot;), an adaptation of the classic and popular spoken stage comedy ''[[La locandiera]]'' by Carlo Goldoni, the libretto was prepared by [[Domenico Poggi]].

The majority of Salieri's modest number of instrumental works also date from this time.  Salieri's instrumental works have been judged by various critics and scholars to lack the inspiration and innovation found in his writing for the stage.  These orchestral works are mainly in the gallant style and though they show some development toward the late classical they reflect a general weakness in comparison to his operatic works of the same and later periods.  These works were written for mostly unknown occasions and artists.  They include two concertos for pianoforte, one in C major and one in B flat major, (both 1773); a concerto for organ in C Major in two movements, (the middle movement is missing from the autograph score, or perhaps, it was an improvised organ solo) (also 1773); two concertante works: a concerto for oboe, violin and cello in D major (1770), and a flute and oboe concerto in C major (1774).  These works are among the most frequently recorded of Salieri's compositions.

Upon Gassmann's death on 22 January,&lt;ref&gt;Thayler, pg.53&lt;/ref&gt; most likely due to complications from an accident with a carriage some years earlier, Salieri succeeded him as assistant director of the Italian opera in early 1774.&lt;ref&gt;Braunbehrens pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In 1774 Salieri married Therese Helferstorfer on October 10, she was the daughter of a recently deceased financier and official of the court treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Rice pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred music was not a high priority for the composer during this stage of his career, but he did compose an Alleluia for chorus and orchestra in 1774, perhaps for his own wedding, or in thanksgiving for it.

During the next three years Salieri was primarily concerned with rehearsing and conducting the Italian opera company in Vienna and teaching. His three complete operas written during this time show the development of his compositional skills, but included no great success, either commercially, or artistically.  His most important compositions during this period were a symphony in D major, performed in the summer of 1776, and the oratorio ''[[La passione di Gesù Cristo]]'' with a text by [[Metastasio]] performed during Advent of 1776.

After the financial collapse of the Italian opera company in 1777 due to financial mis-management, Joseph II decided to end the performance of Italian opera, French spoken drama, and ballet.  Instead the two court owned theaters would be reopened under new management, and partly subsidized by the Imperial Court, as a new National Theater. The re-launched theaters would promote German language plays and musical productions that reflected Austrian (or as Joseph II would have said) German values, traditions and outlook.  The Italian opera buffa company was therefore replaced by a German language [[Singspiel]] troupe.  For Joseph and his supports of Imperial reform, besides encouraging any first buddings of pan-national pride that would unite his multi-lingual and ethnic subjects under one common language; they also hoped to save a considerable amount of money in the process.  Beginning in 1778 Emperor wished to have new works, in German, composed by his own subjects and brought on the stage with clear Imperial support.  This in effect left Salieri's role as assistant court composer in a much reduced position.  Salieri also had never truly mastered the German language, and he now felt no longer competent to continue as assistant opera director.  A further blow to his career was landed when the spoken drama and musical Singspiel were placed on an equal footing.  For the young composer there would be few, if any, new compositional commissions to receive from the court. Salieri was left with few financial options and he began casting about for new opportunities.

===Italian tour (1778–1780)===
However, in 1778 Gluck turned down an offer to compose the inaugural opera for [[La Scala]] in [[Milan]]; upon the suggestion of Joseph II and with the approval of Gluck, Salieri was offered the commission, which he gratefully accepted.  Joseph II granted Salieri permission to take a year long leave of absence (later extended) thus enabling him to write for La Scala and to undertake a tour of Italy.  Salieri's Italian tour of 1778–80 began with the production of ''[[Europa riconosciuta]]'' (&quot;Europa Recognized&quot;) for La Scala (which was revived in 2004 for the same opera house's re-opening following extensive renovations).  From Milan Salieri included stops in Venice and Rome and finally a return to Milan.  During this tour he wrote three new comic operas and he also collaborated with [[Giacomo Rust]] on one opera, ''[[Il Talismano]]'' (&quot;The Talismand&quot;). Of his Italian works one, ''[[La scuola de' gelosi]]'' (&quot;The School for Jealousy&quot;), a witty study of amorous intrigue and emotion, would prove a popular and lasting international success.

===Middle Viennese period and Parisian operas (1780–1788)===
Upon his return at imperial behest to Vienna in 1780, he wrote one German singspiel ''[[Der Rauchfangkehrer]]'' or (''The Chimney Sweep'') which premiered in 1781.  Salieri's ''Chimney Sweep'' and Mozart's work for the same company in 1782, ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' (&quot;The Abduction from the Seraglio&quot;) would be the only two major successes to emerge from the German singspiel experiment, and only Mozart's opera would survive on the stage beyond the close of the 18th century.  In 1783 the Italian opera company was revived with singers partly chosen and vetted by Salieri during his Italian tour,&lt;ref&gt;Rice pg. 256&lt;/ref&gt; the new season would open with a slightly re-worked version of Salieri's recent success ''[[La scuola de' gelosi]]''.  Salieri then returned to his rounds of rehearsing, composition and teaching. However, his time at home in Vienna would be quickly brought to a close when an opportunity to write an opera for Paris arose, again through the patronage of Gluck Salieri traveled abroad to fulfill an important commission.

The opera ''[[Les Danaïdes]]'' (&quot;The Danaids&quot;) is a five-act [[tragédie lyrique]]; the plot was based on an ancient Greek legend that had been the basis for the first play in a trilogy by [[Aeschylus]], entitled ''[[The Suppliants]]''.  The original commission that reached Salieri in 1783–84 was to assist Gluck in finishing a work for Paris that had been all but completed; in reality, Gluck had failed to notate any of the score for the new opera and gave the entire project over to his young friend.  Gluck feared that the Parisian critics would denounce the opera by a young composer known mostly for comic pieces and so the opera was originally billed in the press as being a new work by Gluck with some assistance from Antonio Salieri, then shortly before the premiere of the opera the Parisian press reported that the work was to be partly by Gluck and partly by Salieri, and finally after popular and critical success were won on stage the opera was acknowledged in a letter to the public by Gluck as being wholly by the young Antonio.  ''Les Danaïdes'' was received with great acclaim and its popularity with audiences and critics alike produced several further requests for new works for Paris audiences by Salieri.  ''Les Danaïdes''  followed in the tradition of reform that Gluck had begun in the 1760s and that Salieri had emulated in his earlier opera ''Armida''.  Salieri's first [[French opera]] contained scenes of great solemnity and festivity; yet overshadowing it all was darkness and revenge.  The opera depicted politically motivated murder, filial duty and love in conflict, tryannicide and finally eternal damnation.  The opera with its dark overture, lavish choral writing, many ballet scenes, and electrifying finale depicting a glimpse of hellish torture kept the opera on the stage in Paris for over forty years.  A young [[Hector Berlioz]] recorded the deep impression this work made on him in his ''Mémoires''.&lt;ref&gt;Berlioz, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning to Vienna following his success in Paris, Salieri met and befriended [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]] and had his first professional encounters with [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].  Da Ponte would write his first opera libretto for Salieri, ''[[Il ricco d'un giorno]]'' (&quot;A Rich Man for a Day&quot;) in 1784, it was not a success.  Salieri next turned to [[Giambattista Casti]] as a librettist, a more successful set of collaboration flowed from this pairing.  In the mean time Da Ponte would begin work with Mozart on ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]'' (&quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;).  (For the famous relationship between Mozart and Salieri please see below.)  Salieri soon produced one of his greatest works with the text by Casti ''[[La grotta di Trofonio]]'' (&quot;The Cave of Trofonius&quot;) in 1785, the first opera buffa published in full score by [[Artaria]].  Shortly after this success Joseph II had Mozart and Salieri each contribute a one-act opera and/or singspiel for production at a banquet in 1786.  Salieri collaborated with Casti to produce a parody of the relationship between poet and composer in ''[[Prima la musica e poi le parole]]'' (&quot;First the Music and then the Words&quot;).  This short work also highlighted the typical backstage antics of two high flown sopranos.  Salieri then returned to Paris for the premiere of his tragédie lyrique ''[[Les Horaces]]'' (&quot;The Horati&quot;) which proved a failure.  However the failure of this work was more than made up for with his next Parisian opera ''[[Tarare (Salieri)|Tarare]]'' with a libretto by [[Beaumarchais]].  This was intended to be the ''nec plus ultra'' of reform opera, a completely new synthesis of poetry and music that was an 18th-century anticipation of the ideals of [[Richard Wagner]].  He also created a sacred cantata ''Le Jugement dernier'' (&quot;The Last Judgement&quot;).  The success of his opera ''Tarare'' was such that it was soon translated into Italian at Joseph II behest by Lorenzo Da Ponte as ''[[Axur, Re d'Ormus]]'' (&quot;Axur, King of Hormuz&quot;) and staged at the royal wedding of [[Franz II]] in 1788.

===Late Viennese operas (1788–1804)===

In 1788 Salieri returned to Vienna where he remained for the rest of his life.  Also in that year he became Kappellmeister of the Imperial Chapel upon the death of [[Joseph Bonno]]; as Kappellmeister he conducted the music and musical school connected with the chapel until shortly before his death, being official retired from the post in 1824.

His Italian adaptation of ''Tarare'', ''Axur'' would prove to be his greatest international success.  ''Axur'' was widely produced throughout Europe and it even reached South America with the exiled royal house of Portugal in 1824.  ''Axur'' and his other new compositions completed by 1792 would mark the height of Salieri's popularity and his influence.  Just as his apogee of fame was being reached abroad, his influence in Vienna would begin to diminish with the death of Joseph II in 1789.  Joseph's death deprived Salieri of his greatest patron and protector.  During this period of imperial change in Vienna and revolutionary ferment in France, Salieri composed two additional extremely innovative musical dramas to libretti by Giovanni Casti.  Due, however, to their satiric and overtly liberal political inclinations, both operas were seen as unsuitable for public performance in the politically reactive cultures of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and later [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor]].  This resulted in two of his most original operas being consigned to his desk drawer, namely ''[[Cublai, gran kan de' Tartari]]'' (&quot;Kublai Grand Kahn of Tartary&quot;) a satire on the autocracy and court intrigues at the court of the Russian [[Czarina]], [[Catherine the Great]], and ''[[Catilina (Salieri)|Catilina]]'' (&quot;Cataline&quot;) a semi-comic-semi-tragic account of the [[Lucius Sergius Catilina|Catiline]] conspiracy that attempted to overthrow the Roman republic during the consulship of [[Cicero]].  These operas were composed in 1787 and 1792 respectively.  Two other operas of little success and longterm importance were composed in 1789, and one great popular success ''[[La Cifra]]'' (&quot;The Cipher&quot;).

As Salieri's political position became very insecure he was retired as director of the Italian opera in 1792.  He continued to write new operas per imperial contract until 1804, when he voluntarily withdrew from the stage.  Of his late works for the stage only two works gained wide popular esteem during his life, ''[[Palmira, regina di Persia]]'' (&quot;Palmira, Queen of Persia&quot;) 1795 and ''[[Cesare in Farmacusa]]'' (&quot;Caesar on Pharmacusa&quot;), both drawing on the heroic and exotic success established with ''Axur''.  His late opera based on [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'', ''[[Falstaff (Salieri)|Falstaff]]'', ''ossia Le tre burle'' (&quot;Falstaff, or the Three Tricks&quot;), (1799) has found a wider audience in modern times than its original reception promised. His last opera was a German language singspiel ''[[Die Neger]]'', (&quot;The Negroes&quot;), a melodrama set in colonial Virginia with a text by [[Georg Friedrich Treitschke]] (the author of the libretto for Beethoven's ''[[Fidelio]]'') performed in 1804 and was a complete failure.

===Life after opera (1804–1825)===
When Salieri retired from the stage, he recognized that artistic styles had changed and he felt that he no longer had the creative capacity to adapt or the emotional desire to continue.  Also as Salieri aged he moved slowly away from his more liberal political stances as he saw the enlightened reform of Joseph II's reign, and the hoped for reforms of the French revolution, replaced with more radical revolutionary ideas.  As the political situation threatened and eventually overwhelmed Austria, which was repeatedly crushed by French political forces, Salieri's first and most important biographer Mosel described the emotional effect that this political, social, and cultural upheaval had on the composer. Mosel noted that these radical changes, especially the invasion and defeat of Austria, and the occupation of Vienna intertwined with the personal losses that struck Salieri in the same period led to his withdrawal from operatic work.  Related to this Mosel quotes the aged composer concerning the radical changes in musical taste that were underway in the age of Beethoven, &quot;From that period [circa 1800] I realized that musical taste was gradually changing in a manner completely contrary to that of my own times. Eccentricity and confusion of genres replaced reasoned and masterful simplicity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rice, pp. 596–97&lt;/ref&gt;

As his teaching and work with the imperial chapel continued, his duties required the composition of a large number of sacred works, and in his last years it was almost exclusively in religious works and teaching that Salieri occupied himself.  Among his compositions written for the chapels needs were two complete sets of vespers, many graduals, offertories, and four orchestral masses. During this period he lost his only son in 1805 and his wife in 1807.

Salieri continued to conduct publicly (including the performance of [[Haydn]]'s [[The Creation (Haydn)|''The Creation'']], during which Haydn collapsed, and several premiers by Beethoven including the 1st and 2nd Piano Concertos and ''[[Wellington's Victory]]'').  He also continued to help administer several charities and organize their musical events.

His remaining secular works in this late period fall into three categories: first, large scale cantatas and one oratorio ''Habsburg'' written on patriotic themes or in response to the international political situation, pedagogical works written to aid his students in voice, and finally simple songs, rounds or canons written for home entertainment; many with original poetry by the composer.  He also composed one large scale instrumental work in 1815 intended as a study in late classical orchestration: ''[[Twenty-Six Variations for the Orchestra on a Theme called La Folia di Spagna]]''. The theme is likely folk derived and is known as ''[[Folia|La Folia]]''.  This simple melodic and harmonic progression had served as an inspiration for many baroque composers, and would be used by later romantic and post-romantic composers.  Salieri's setting is a brooding work in the minor key, which rarely moves far from the original melodic material, its main interest lies in the deft and varied handling of orchestral colors.  ''La Folia'' was the most monumental set of orchestral variations before [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]' ''[[Variations on a Theme by Haydn]]''.

His teaching of budding young musicians continued, and among his pupils in composition (usually vocal) were [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Antonio Casimir Cartellieri]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Franz Schubert]] and many other luminaries of the early Romantic period.  He also instructed many prominent singers throughout his long career.  All but the wealthiest of his pupils received their lessons for free, a tribute to the kindness Gassmann had shown Salieri as a penniless orphan.

Salieri was committed to medical care and suffered [[dementia]] for the last year and a half of his life.  He died in Vienna on 7 May 1825, and was buried in the Matzleinsdorfer Friedhof on 10&amp;nbsp;May.  At his memorial service on 22 June 1825 his own Requiem in C minor&amp;nbsp;— composed in 1804 — was performed for the first time.  His remains were later transferred to the [[Zentralfriedhof]].  His monument is adorned by a poem written by [[Joseph Weigl]], one of his pupils:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Rest in peace! Uncovered by dust'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Eternity shall bloom for you.'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Rest in peace! In eternal harmonies'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Your spirit now is dissolved.'' &lt;br /&gt;
''It expressed itself in enchanting notes,'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Now it is floating to everlasting beauty.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Opera===
During his time in Vienna, Salieri acquired great prestige as a composer and conductor, particularly of [[opera]], but also of [[chamber music|chamber]] and [[sacred music]].  Among the most successful of his 37 operas staged during his lifetime were ''[[Armida (Salieri)|Armida]]'' (1771), ''[[La fiera di Venezia]]'' (1772), ''[[La scuola de' gelosi]]'' (1778), ''[[Der Rauchfangkehrer]]'' (1781), ''[[Les Danaïdes]]'' (1784), which was first presented as a work of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck's]], ''[[La grotta di Trofonio]]'' (1785), ''[[Tarare (Salieri)|Tarare]]'' (1787) (''Tarare'' was reworked and revised several times as was ''Les Danaïdes'' ), ''[[Axur, Re d'Ormus]]'' (1788), ''[[La Cifra]]'' (1789), ''[[Palmira, regina di Persia]]'' (1795), [http://www.teatrosalieri.it/index.asp?m0=cartellonedett&amp;tipo=Salieri_Opera_Festival&amp;page=0&amp;id=3233 ''Il mondo alla rovescia''] (1795), ''[[Falstaff (Salieri)|Falstaff]]'' (1799), and ''[[Cesare in Farmacusa]]'' (1800).

In November 2009 at [http://www.teatrosalieri.it Teatro Salieri], Legnago (Italy), first staging in modern times of the opera [http://www.teatrosalieri.it/index.asp?m0=cartellonedett&amp;tipo=Salieri_Opera_Festival&amp;page=0&amp;id=3233 ''Il mondo alla rovescia''] by Antonio Salieri; it is a co-production between the [http://www.teatrosalieri.it Fondazione Culturale Antonio Salieri] and the Fondazione Arena di Verona for the [http://www.teatrosalieri.it/index.asp?m0=cartellone&amp;tipo=Salieri_Opera_Festival Salieri Opera Festival]

===Sacred works===
Salieri's earliest surviving work is a Mass in C major.  He would write four major orchestral masses, a requiem, and many offertories, graduals, vesper settings, and sacred cantatas and oratorios.  Much of his sacred music dates from after his appointment as Hofkapellmeister in 1788.

===Instrumental works===
His small instrumental output includes two [[Piano concerto|piano concerti]], a concerto for [[organ (music)|organ]] written in 1773, a concerto for [[flute]], [[oboe]] and orchestra (1774), and a set of twenty-six variations on ''[[La follia di Spagna]]'' (1815).

==Salieri and Mozart==
In the 1780s while [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] lived and worked in Vienna, he and his father Leopold wrote in their letters that several &quot;cabals&quot; of Italians led by Salieri were actively putting roadblocks in the way of Mozart's obtaining certain posts or staging his operas.  For example, Mozart wrote in December 1781 to his father that “the only one who counts in [the Emperor’s] eyes is Salieri”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert Spaethling&quot;&gt;Mozart’s Letters, Mozart’s Life, WW Norton &amp; Co, New York, 2000, p.294.&lt;/ref&gt;   Their letters suggest that both Mozart and his father, being Austrians who resented the special place that Italian composers had in the courts of the Austrian princes, blamed the Italians in general and Salieri in particular for all of Mozart's difficulties in establishing himself in Vienna. Mozart wrote to his father in May 1783 about Salieri and Lorenzo Da Ponte, the court poet: “You know those Italian gentlemen; they are very nice to your face!  Enough, we all know about them.  And if [Da Ponte] is in league with Salieri, I’ll never get a text from him, and I would love to show here what I can really do with an Italian opera.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Emily Anderson ed.&quot;&gt;Mozart’s Letters, Little, Brown &amp; Co, London, 1990 pp. 184–5 .&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 1783 Mozart wrote to his father of “a trick of Salieri’s”,&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert Spaethling&quot;&gt;Mozart’s Letters, Mozart’s Life, WW Norton &amp; Co, New York, 2000, p.357 .&lt;/ref&gt; one of several letters in which he accused Salieri of trickery. Decades after Mozart's death, a rumour began to circulate that Mozart had been poisoned by Salieri. This rumour has been attributed by some to a rivalry between the German and the Italian schools of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=For Mozart's Arch rival, an Italian Renaissance | author=Jason Horowitz | date=2004-12-28 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/28/arts/music/28sali.html?ei=5088&amp;en=7d60688cd81285e2&amp;ex=1261976400&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;adxnnlx=1127322281-E5bLYNdgoI5tijOhmwxecA | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Maria von Weber]], a relative of Mozart by marriage&lt;ref&gt;Braunbehrens, p. 5. &quot;Apparently Weber, who could claim family ties with Mozart, believed the rumors.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; whom Wagner has characterized as the most German of German composers, is said to have refused to join Ludlams-Höhle, a social club of which Salieri was a member and avoided having anything to do with him.&lt;ref&gt;Braunbehrens, p. 220. &quot;Carl Maria von Weber was also invited to join the society, but is said to have refused as long as Salieri was a member.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; These rumors then made their way into popular culture.  [[Albert Lortzing]]'s ''Singspiel'' ''Szenen aus Mozarts Leben'' LoWV28 (1832) uses the cliché of the jealous Salieri trying to hinder Mozart's career.

Ironically, Salieri's music was much more in the tradition of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] and Gassmann than of the Italians like Paisiello or Cimarosa.  In 1772, Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] commented on her preference of Italian composers over [[German people|Germans]] like Gassmann, Salieri or Gluck. While Venetian by birth, Salieri had lived in imperial Vienna for almost 60 years and was regarded by such people as the music critic Friedrich Rochlitz as a German composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=See his obituary reprinted in Alexander Wheelock Thayer, Salieri: Rival of Mozart (Kansas City 1989) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biographer [[Alexander Wheelock Thayer]] believes that Mozart's rivalry with Salieri could have originated with an incident in 1781 when Mozart applied to be the music teacher of the Princess of Württemberg, and Salieri was selected instead because of his reputation as a singing teacher. In the following year Mozart once again failed to be selected as the Princess's piano teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abert|first=Hermann|coauthors=Spencer, Stewart; Eisen, Cliff|title=W. A. Mozart|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|page=623|isbn=978-0300072235}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Salieri and his tribe will move heaven and earth to put it down&quot;, [[Leopold Mozart]] wrote to his daughter Nannerl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thayer|first=Alexander Wheelock|coauthors=Albrecht, Theodore|publisher=Philharmonia of Greater Kansas City|year=1989|page=85|isbn=978-0932845375}}&lt;/ref&gt; But at the time of the premiere of ''Figaro'', Salieri was busy with his new [[French language|French]] opera ''[[Les Horaces]]''. In addition, when [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]] was in [[Prague]] preparing the production of Mozart's setting of his ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', the poet was ordered back to Vienna for a royal wedding for which Salieri's ''Axur, re d'Ormus'' would be performed. Obviously, Mozart was not pleased by this.

However, even with Mozart and Salieri being rivals for certain jobs, there is very little evidence that the relationship between the two composers was at all acrimonious beyond this; rather, they appeared to usually see each other as friends and colleagues and supported each others' work. For example, when Salieri was appointed Kapellmeister in 1788 he revived ''Figaro'' instead of bringing out a new opera of his own; and when he went to the coronation festivities for Leopold II in 1790 he had no fewer than three Mozart masses in his luggage. Salieri and Mozart even composed a cantata for voice and piano together, called ''Per la ricuperata salute di Ophelia'' which was celebrating the return to stage of the singer [[Nancy Storace]]. This work has been [[Lost work|lost]], although it had been printed by [[Artaria]] in 1785. Mozart's ''Davide penitente'' (1785), his Piano Concerto in E flat major (1785), the Clarinet Quintet (1789) and the great Symphony in G minor had been premiered on the suggestion of Salieri, who supposedly conducted a performance of it in 1791. In his last surviving letter from 14 October 1791, Mozart tells his wife that he collected Salieri and [[Caterina Cavalieri]] in his carriage and drove them both to the opera, and about Salieri's attendance at his opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]'', speaking enthusiastically: ''&quot;He heard and saw with all his attention, and from the overture to the last choir there was not a piece that didn't elicit a &quot;Bravo!&quot; or &quot;Bello!&quot; out of him [...].&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[[Maynard Solomon|Solomon, Maynard]], Mozart: A life, Harper Perennial (February 14, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fictional treatments===
*Within a few months of Salieri's death in 1825, [[Alexander Pushkin]] wrote his &quot;little tragedy&quot; ''Mozart and Salieri'' (1831) as a dramatic study of the sin of [[envy]].  Russian composer [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov]] adapted Pushkin's play as an [[Mozart and Salieri|opera of the same name]] in 1898.
*A hugely popular perpetuation of the story came in [[Peter Shaffer]]'s play ''[[Amadeus]]'' (1979) and the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning [[Amadeus (film)|1984 film]] directed by [[Miloš Forman]] based upon it. He is depicted as a Machiavellian character, who uses his connections to keep Mozart as the underdog. Salieri is characterized as both in awe of and insanely resentful towards Mozart, going so far as to renounce [[God]] for blessing his adversary; &quot;Amadeus&quot; means love of God, or God's love, and the play can be said to be about God-given talent. Or the lack thereof: Salieri is hospitalized in a mental institution, where he announces himself as &quot;the [[Patron Saint]] of mediocrity&quot;. Salieri was portrayed in the award-winning play at London's National Theatre by [[Paul Scofield]]. In the film he is played by [[F. Murray Abraham]], who won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].
*Salieri's supposed hatred for Mozart is also alluded to in a [[parody|spoof]] opera entitled ''[[A Little Nightmare Music]]'', by [[P.D.Q. Bach]]. In the opera, Salieri attempts to [[poison]] an [[anachronism|anachronistic]] Shaffer but is bumped by a &quot;clumsy oaf&quot;, which causes him to inadvertently poison Mozart instead and spill wine on his favorite coat.
*[[Patrick Stewart]] played Salieri in the 1985 production ''The Mozart Inquest''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klossner|first=Michael|title=The Europe of 1500–1815 on film and television: a worldwide filmography of over 2550 works, 1895 through 2000|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|year=2002|page=267|isbn=978-0786412235}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Florent Mothe]] portrays Salieri in the 2009 French musical &quot;[[Mozart, l'opéra rock]]&quot;.
*In a [[Margical History Tour#Mozart and Salieri|segment]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode &quot;[[Margical History Tour]]&quot;, Salieri is represented by [[Lisa Simpson]], to [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]'s Mozart. They are interpreted as competitive siblings, with Lisa/Salieri being a serious, unappreciated professional and Bart/Mozart the successful, uncouth rock star (complete with an opera based on &quot;[[Beans, Beans, the Musical Fruit]]&quot; to the music of ''[[Eine kleine Nachtmusik]]'').
*In episode 2, season 4 of &quot;[[How I Met Your Mother]]&quot;, entitled &quot;[[The Best Burger in New York]]&quot;, Marshall's description of the taste of the best burger uses music that alludes to the 1984 film Amadeus, when Antonio Salieri describes the same music (by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) with the same accuracy and passion with which Marshall speaks of the burger

==Recent popularity==
More and more of Salieri's music is being recorded. Many of his overtures and most of his limited symphonic music have now been released on CD, though Salieri wrote primarily for the voice and much of his operatic music is only starting to be recorded. In 2003, [[mezzo-soprano]] [[Cecilia Bartoli]] released ''The Salieri Album'', a CD with 13 arias from Salieri's operas, most of which had never been recorded before. Patrice Michaels sang a number of his arias on the CD Divas of Mozart's Day.  In 2008, another female opera star, [[Diana Damrau]], released a CD with seven Salieri coloratura arias. Since 2000, there have also been complete recordings issued or re-issued of the operas ''Axur Re d'Ormus'', ''[[Falstaff (Salieri)|Falstaff]]'', ''[[Les Danaïdes]]'', ''La Locandiera'', ''[[La grotta di Trofonio]]'', ''[[Prima la musica e poi le parole]]'' and ''[[Il mondo alla rovescia]]'' . Salieri has yet to fully re-enter the general repertory, but performances of his works are progressively becoming more regular.

His operas ''Falstaff'' (1995 production) and ''Tarare'' (1987 production) have been released on DVD. In 2004, the opera ''[[Europa Riconosciuta]]'' was staged in Milan for the reopening of [[La Scala]] in [[Milan]], with soprano [[Diana Damrau]] in the title role. This production was also broadcast on television, with a future DVD release possible.

Salieri has even begun to attract some attention from Hollywood. In 2001, his triple concerto was used in the soundtrack of ''[[The Last Castle]]'', featuring Robert Redford and James Gandolfini. It is a story that builds on the rivalry between a meticulous but untested officer (Gandolfini) serving as the warden of a military prison and an imprisoned but much admired and highly decorated general (Redford). The Salieri piece is used as the warden's theme music, seemingly to invoke the image of jealousy of the inferior for his superior. In 2006, the movie ''[[Copying Beethoven]]'' referred to Salieri in a more positive light. In this movie a young female music student hired by Beethoven to copy out his Ninth Symphony is staying at a monastery. The abbess tries to discourage her from working with the irreverent Beethoven. She notes that she too once had dreams, having come to Vienna to study opera singing with Salieri. Most recently the 2008 movie ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'' used the Larghetto movement from Salieri's Piano Concerto in C major. The scene where Obadiah Stane, the archrival of 'Tony' Stark, the wealthy industrialist turned Ironman, tells Tony that he is being ousted from his company by the board, Obadiah plays the opening few bars of the Salieri concerto on a piano in Stark's suite.

'''Activism''' consists of intentional action to bring about [[social change|social]], [[politics|political]], [[economics|economic]], or [[Natural environment|environmental]] change. Activism can take a wide range of forms from writing letters to newspapers or politicians, political campaigning, [[economic activism]] such as [[boycott]]s or preferentially patronizing businesses, rallies, [[Demonstration (people)|street marches]], [[strike action|strikes]], both [[sit-ins]] and [[hunger strike]]s. 

Some activists try to persuade people to change their behavior directly, rather than persuade governments to change laws. The [[cooperative movement]] seeks to build new institutions which conform to cooperative principles, and generally does not lobby or protest politically.

The '''Cobble Hill Tunnel''' (popularly the '''Atlantic Avenue Tunnel''') of the [[Long Island Rail Road]] is an abandoned railroad tunnel beneath [[Atlantic Avenue (New York City)|Atlantic Avenue]] in downtown [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]]. When open, it ran for about {{convert|2517|ft|m}} between Columbia Street and Boerum Place.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} It is the oldest [[railway tunnel]] beneath a city street in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psfk.com/2009/03/notes-from-the-underground-the-secret-tunnels-of-brooklyn.html|title=Notes from the Underground: The Secret Tunnels of Brooklyn|last=Hilger|first=James|date=March 23, 2009|publisher=psfk.com|accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://citynoise.org/article/8748 Citynoise: Oldest Subway Tunnel in the World] Retrieved 2009-04-08.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some also claim it to be the oldest [[rapid transit|subway]] tunnel in the world, as it was built by the [[cut and cover]] method under a city street, specifically for the purposes of improved public safety, attaining [[grade separation]] and enhanced railway operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;BHRA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 1869–73 [[Beach Pneumatic Transit]] is usually cited as the first attempt at constructing an underground rapid transit system in New York City. In 1904, the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]] (now the [[New York City Subway]]) opened the city's [[Original IRT subway|first underground subway line]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Construction began in May 1844. The tunnel opened for use on December 3, 1844, but was not completely finished until late Spring 1845. It was built mainly to satisfy public demand for creation of a [[Grade separation|grade-separated]] [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right of way]] for the [[Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad]] (later Long Island Rail Road) on its way to the [[South Ferry, Brooklyn|South Ferry]] at the foot of Atlantic Street (later Atlantic Avenue), where passengers could catch ferries to [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BHRA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynrail.net/images/aa_tunnel/new_research/oct_09/events_leading_to_tunnel_creation.pdf|title=Events That Led To The Creation Of The Atlantic Avenue Tunnel|publisher=Brooklyn Historic Railway Association|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the tunnel also lowered the LIRR's grade through Cobble Hill.

In exchange for building the tunnel, the [[City of Brooklyn]] granted the B&amp;J permission to operate its steam locomotives on Atlantic Street west of Fifth Avenue (then Parmentier's Garden/Gowanus Lane), all the way to Brooklyn's South Ferry (the present location of Brooklyn's Pier 7). Prior to the tunnel being built, the LIRR's western terminus was Atlantic Street at Clinton Street. Train cars were hauled by teams of horses along Atlantic Street from Clinton Street to Parmentier's Garden, where steam locomotives were attached. While the tunnel was being built, the railroad operated to a temporary terminal at Pacific Street and Henry Street.

The Cobble Hill Tunnel was part of the first rail link between [[New York City]] and [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The railroad connected [[Lower Manhattan]] via the South Ferry to [[Greenport]] on the [[North Fork]] of [[Long Island]], where a ferry connected to [[Norwich, Connecticut]] to a rail link that continued to Boston. This avoided some difficult construction of bridges over the rivers of southern [[Connecticut]]. In 1848, the [[New York and New Haven Railroad]] Line was completed through Connecticut, providing a direct, faster rail connection from New York City to Boston. The Cobble Hill Tunnel and the Long Island Railroad remained the primary means of access to most of central Long Island from Manhattan and New York City.

As built, the tunnel was {{convert|21|ft|m}} wide, {{convert|17|ft|m}} high and {{convert|2517|ft|m}} long.

Insofar as it carried railroad trains under a city street, some have claimed it be the world's first [[rapid transit|subway]] tunnel, though, unlike a modern rapid transit subway, it had no stations. The ends of the tunnel were sealed in the fall of 1861. The similar [[Murray Hill Tunnel]] on the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] was built as an open cut around 1836, and roofed over around the 1850s, and is in use for automobile traffic.

== Controversy during closure ==
In 1861, the [[New York State Legislature]] voted to ban railroad locomotives from within the limits of the [[City of Brooklyn]]. A tax assessment was ordered on all property owners along Atlantic Street (today Atlantic Avenue), to defray the costs of the closure. It was undisclosed at the time that [[New York State]] Governor [[John A. King]] was a major [[shareholder]] in the Brooklyn and [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]] Railroad (later the [[Long Island Rail Road]]) and therefore had a conflict of interest and stood to benefit by the compensation payments to the railroad from the tax assessment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

== Dormant decades ==
[[Walt Whitman]] wrote of the tunnel:&lt;ref name=CB&gt;{{cite web | title=Crossing Brooklyn LIRR Tunnel | work=Forgotten NY | url=http://www.forgotten-ny.com/SUBWAYS/tunnel/tunnel.html | accessdate=February 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The old tunnel, that used to lie there under ground, a passage of Acheron-like solemnity and darkness, now all closed and filled up, and soon to be utterly forgotten, with all its reminiscences; however, there will, for a few years yet be many dear ones, to not a few Brooklynites, New Yorkers, and promiscuous crowds besides. For it was here you started to go down the island, in summer. For years, it was confidently counted on that this spot, and the railroad of which it was the terminus, were going to prove the permanent seat of business and wealth that belong to such enterprises. But its glory, after enduring in great splendor for a season, has now vanished—at least its Long Island Railroad glory has. The tunnel: dark as the grave, cold, damp, and silent. How beautiful look earth and heaven again, as we emerge from the gloom! It might not be unprofitable, now and then, to send us mortals—the dissatisfied ones, at least, and that's a large proportion—into some tunnel of several days' journey. We'd perhaps grumble less, afterward, at God's handiwork.

In March 1916, the [[FBI|Bureau of Investigation]] suspected German [[terrorist]]s were making bombs in the tunnel, and broke through the roof of the tunnel with jackhammers. They found nothing, installed an electric light, and resealed it. In the 1920s it was rumored used for both mushroom growing and bootleg whiskey stills even though there was no access into the main portion of the tunnel. It became an object of local folklore and legend. In 1936, the [[New York City Police Department]] unsuccessfully attempted to enter the tunnel, in order to look for the body of a hoodlum supposedly buried there. In 1941 it was rumored to have been inspected by the federal [[Works Progress Administration]] to determine its structural strength, but there is no evidence of this. A few years later, it was once again rumored to have been opened, this time by the FBI, in an unsuccessful search for spies; however, there is no evidence of this. During the late 1950s it was sought by two rail historians, George Horn and Martin Schachne, but they did not gain access to the tunnel itself.

== Rediscovery ==
Having fallen from public notice, the tunnel was rediscovered in 1981 by then 18-year-old Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Diamond, who entered from a manhole he located at Atlantic Avenue and Court Street, crawled a distance of {{convert|70|ft|m}} underground through a filled-in section of tunnel less than two feet high, and located the bulkhead wall that sealed off the main portion of the tunnel. With the assistance of a Brooklyn Union Gas Co. (now [[KeySpan|National Grid]]) engineering crew, he then broke through the massive concrete bulkhead wall, which is several feet thick. Diamond thereby opened access to the main portion of the tunnel, and began to popularize the tunnel as an antiquity. He led tours of its interior&lt;ref name=CB /&gt; through December 17, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local-beat/Brooklyn-Underground-Tunnel-Tours-Are-Now-Six-Feet-Under-112103379.html NBC.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] since 1989.

The [[History Channel]] series ''Cities of the Underworld'' ran a segment (&quot;New York's Secret Societies&quot;) on the tunnel in Fall 2008. The TV show ''[[Treasure Hunters (TV series)|Treasure Hunters]]'' used it in an episode.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Annapolis valley map.png|thumb|275px|Map showing the Annapolis Valley Region]]
The '''Annapolis Valley''' is a valley and region in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Nova Scotia]].  It is located in the western part of the [[Nova Scotia peninsula]], formed by a trough between two parallel mountain ranges along the shore of the [[Bay of Fundy]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Annapolis Valley from lookoff1.JPG|thumb|View of the Annapolis Valley as viewed from [[North Mountain (Nova Scotia)|North Mountain]] looking southwest from [[The Lookoff, Nova Scotia|The Lookoff]], north of [[Canning, Nova Scotia|Canning]], in October 2005.]]
The valley measures approximately 126 km in length from [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]] and the [[Annapolis Basin]] in the west to [[Wolfville, Nova Scotia|Wolfville]] and the [[Minas Basin]] in the east, spanning the counties of [[Digby County, Nova Scotia|Digby]], [[Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Annapolis]] and [[Kings County, Nova Scotia|Kings]].

Some also include the western part of [[Hants County, Nova Scotia|Hants County]], including the towns of [[Hantsport, Nova Scotia|Hantsport]] and [[Windsor, Nova Scotia|Windsor]] even further to the east, but geographically speaking they are part of the [[Avon River (Nova Scotia)|Avon River]] valley.

The steep face of basaltic [[North Mountain (Nova Scotia)|North Mountain]] shelters the valley from the adjacent Bay of Fundy and rises to almost {{convert|850|ft|m}} in elevation in some parts.  The granitic [[South Mountain (Nova Scotia)|South Mountain]] also rises to similar elevation and shelters the valley from the climate of the Atlantic Ocean approximately 100 kilometres further south on the province's [[South Shore (Nova Scotia)|South Shore]].

The shelter provided by these two mountainous ridges has produced a &quot;micro climate&quot; which provides relatively mild temperatures for the region and, coupled with the fertile glacial sedimentary soils on the valley floor, the region is conducive to growing vegetable and fruit crops.  Particularly famous for its [[apple]] crop, the valley hosts in excess of 1,000 farms of various types, the majority being relatively small family-owned operations.

Within the valley itself are two &quot;major&quot; rivers, the [[Annapolis River]] which flows west from the Caribou Bog in the central part of the valley into the [[Annapolis Basin]], and the [[Cornwallis River]] which flows east from Caribou Bog into the [[Minas Basin]]. The [[North Mountain (Nova Scotia)|North Mountain]] ridge forms the north side of the Annapolis Valley. Also flowing east, in two smaller valleys north of the Cornwallis River, are the Canard River and the Habitant River, both of which also flow into the Minas Basin.

==History==
[[File:W&amp;ARGabriel.jpg|200px|left|thumb|One of the [[Windsor and Annapolis Railway]] locomotives which transformed the valley's apple industry]]
Long settled by the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] Nation, the valley experienced French settlement at the [[Habitation at Port-Royal]], near modern day Annapolis Royal in the western part of the valley, beginning in 1605. From there, the Acadians spread throughout the Valley, in various communities, building dykes to claim the tidal lands along the Annapolis and Cornwallis Rivers. They continued throughout the Annapolis Valley until the British-ordered [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expulsion]] of [[Acadian]]s in 1755 which is memorialized at [[Grand Pre, Nova Scotia|Grand Pré]] in the eastern part of the valley.  [[New England Planters]] moved in to occupy the abandoned Acadian farming areas and the region also saw subsequent settlement by [[United Empire Loyalists|Loyalist]] refugees of the [[American Revolutionary War]], as well as foreign Protestants. These were followed by significant numbers of freed Africans in the [[War of 1812]], Irish immigrants in the mid 19th century and Dutch immigrants after [[World War II]]. Agriculture in the Annapolis valley boomed in the late 19th century with the arrival of the [[Windsor and Annapolis Railway]], later the [[Dominion Atlantic Railway]], which developed large export markets for Annapolis Valley apples.

==Economy==
Today, the Valley is still largely dominated by agriculture but also has a growing diversity in its economies, partly aided by the importance of post-secondary education centres provided by [[Acadia University]] in Wolfville, and the [[Nova Scotia Community College]] campuses located in [[Kentville, Nova Scotia|Kentville]], [[Middleton, Nova Scotia|Middleton]], [[Lawrencetown, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Lawrencetown]], and [[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]].

[[Michelin]] has an important truck tire manufacturing plant in [[Waterville, Nova Scotia|Waterville]] and the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] has its largest [[Canadian Forces Air Command|air force]] base in [[Atlantic Canada]] located at [[CFB Greenwood]] along with an important training facility at Camp Aldershot, near Kentville.

Tourism is also an important industry and the Annapolis Valley is known for its scenic farmland, although today much of it is threatened with suburban development from the Valley's towns. The valley also struggles with serious pollution from farm runoffs and residential sewers in its two major rivers, the [[Annapolis River]] and the [[Cornwallis River]]. 

The Valley is home to the annual [[Annapolis Valley Apple Blossom Festival|Apple Blossom Festival]], held in late spring. Also, in July is the annual Steer B-B-Que in Kingston, and Heart of the Valley Festival in Middleton. August sees Mud Creek Days in Wolfville and the Annapolis Valley Exhibition in Lawrencetown. Farmers markets in Annapolis Royal, Middleton, Kentville, Kingsport, Berwick and Wolfville bring a wealth of fresh produce and other fine goods to the public every week. In the fall there is the Pumpkin People in Kentville to entice the imagination.

==Communities==
Population centres in the valley from west to east include:

*[[Digby, Nova Scotia|Digby]]
*[[Cornwallis, Nova Scotia|Cornwallis]]
*[[Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia|Annapolis Royal]]
*[[Bridgetown, Nova Scotia|Bridgetown]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Redirect|Painkiller}}
{{refimprove|date=December 2009}}
An '''analgesic''' (also known as a '''painkiller''') is any member of the group of [[Medication|drugs]] used to relieve [[pain]] (achieve [[wiktionary:analgesia|analgesia]]). The word ''analgesic'' derives from Greek ''an-'' (&quot;without&quot;) and ''algos'' (&quot;pain&quot;).  

Analgesic drugs act in various ways on the [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] and [[central nervous system|central]] nervous systems; they include [[paracetamol]] (para-acetylaminophenol, also known in the US as acetaminophen), the [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) such as the [[salicylate]]s, and [[opioid]] drugs such as [[morphine]] and [[opium]]. They are distinct from [[anesthetics]], which reversibly eliminate [[sense|sensation]].

In choosing analgesics, the severity and response to other medication determines the choice of agent; the WHO [[pain ladder]], originally developed in [[cancer]]-related pain, is widely applied to find suitable drugs in a stepwise manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anonymous |title=Cancer pain relief and palliative care; report of a WHO expert committee |series=World Health Organization Technical Report Series, 804 |year=1990 |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva, Switzerland  |isbn=924120804X |pages=1–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analgesic choice is also determined by the type of pain: for [[neuropathic pain]], traditional analgesics are less effective, and there is often benefit from classes of drugs that are not normally considered analgesics, such as [[tricyclic antidepressants]] and [[anticonvulsant]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14623723&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dworkin RH, Backonja M, Rowbotham MC, ''et al.'' |title=Advances in neuropathic pain: diagnosis, mechanisms, and treatment recommendations |journal=Arch. Neurol. |volume=60 |issue=11 |pages=1524–34 |year=2003 |pmid=14623723 |doi=10.1001/archneur.60.11.1524|url=http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/60/11/1524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The major classes==
===Paracetamol and NSAIDs===
{{Main|Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}}

The exact mechanism of action of [[paracetamol|paracetamol/acetaminophen]] is uncertain, but it appears to be acting centrally rather than peripherally (in the brain rather than in nerve endings). [[Aspirin]] and the other [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) inhibit [[cyclooxygenase]]s, leading to a decrease in [[prostaglandin]] production. This reduces pain and also [[inflammation]] (in contrast to paracetamol and the opioids).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Paracetamol has few side effects and is regarded as safe, although intake above the recommended dose can lead to [[paracetamol toxicity|liver damage]], which can be severe and life-threatening, and occasionally [[analgesic nephropathy|kidney damage]]. NSAIDs predispose to [[peptic ulcer]]s, [[renal failure]], [[allergy|allergic reactions]], and occasionally [[hearing loss]], and they can increase the risk of [[hemorrhage]] by affecting [[platelet]] function. The use of aspirin in children under 16 suffering from viral illness has been linked to [[Reye's syndrome]], a rare but severe liver disorder.

===COX-2 inhibitors===
{{Main|COX-2 inhibitor}}
These drugs have been derived from NSAIDs.  The [[cyclooxygenase]] enzyme inhibited by NSAIDs was discovered to have at least 2 different versions: COX1 and COX2.  Research suggested that most of the adverse effects of NSAIDs were mediated by blocking the COX1 (constitutive) enzyme, with the analgesic effects being mediated by the COX2 (inducible) enzyme.  The COX2 inhibitors were thus developed to inhibit only the COX2 enzyme (traditional NSAIDs block both versions in general).  These drugs (such as [[rofecoxib]] and [[celecoxib]]) are equally effective analgesics when compared with NSAIDs, but cause less gastrointestinal hemorrhage in particular.  However, post-launch data indicated increased risk of cardiac and cerebrovascular events with these drugs; this is probably due to an imbalance in blood coagulation. Rofecoxib (marketed as Vioxx) was subsequently withdrawn from the market. The role for the remaining members of this class of drug is debated.

===Opiates and morphinomimetics===
{{Main|Opioid|Opiate}}
[[Morphine]], the [[archetypal]] [[opioid]], and various other substances (e.g. [[codeine]], [[oxycodone]], [[hydrocodone]], [[dihydromorphine]], [[pethidine]]) all exert a similar influence on the [[Cerebrum|cerebral]] [[opioid receptor]] system. [[Buprenorphine]] is thought to be a [[partial agonist]] of the opioid receptor, and [[tramadol]] is an opiate agonist with SNRI properties.{{Citation needed|reason=tramadol|date=February 2009}}  [[Tramadol]] is structurally closer to [[venlafaxine]] than to [[codeine]] and delivers analgesia by not only delivering &quot;opiate-like&quot; effects (through mild agonism of the [[mu receptor]]) but also by acting as a weak but fast-acting [[serotonin releasing agent]] and [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1596676&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Driessen B, Reimann W | title = Interaction of the central analgesic, tramadol, with the uptake and release of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the rat brain in vitro | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 105 | issue = 1 | pages = 147–51 | year = 1992 | month = January | pmid = 1596676 | pmc = 1908625 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9389855&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bamigbade TA, Davidson C, Langford RM, Stamford JA | title = Actions of tramadol, its enantiomers and principal metabolite, O-desmethyltramadol, on serotonin (5-HT) efflux and uptake in the rat dorsal raphe nucleus | journal = British Journal of Anaesthesia | volume = 79 | issue = 3 | pages = 352–6 | year = 1997 | month = September | pmid = 9389855 | doi = | url = http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9389855}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9671098&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reimann W, Schneider F |title=Induction of 5-hydroxytryptamine release by tramadol, fenfluramine and reserpine |journal=European Journal of Pharmacology |volume=349 |issue=2-3 |pages=199–203 |year=1998 |month=May |pmid=9671098 |doi=10.1016/S0014-2999(98)00195-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12354291&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gobbi M, Moia M, Pirona L, ''et al.'' |title=p-Methylthioamphetamine and 1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine, two non-neurotoxic 5-HT releasers in vivo, differ from neurotoxic amphetamine derivatives in their mode of action at 5-HT nerve endings in vitro |journal=Journal of Neurochemistry |volume=82 |issue=6 |pages=1435–43 |year=2002 |month=September |pmid=12354291 |doi=10.1046/j.1471-4159.2002.01073.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dosing of all opioids may be limited by opioid toxicity (confusion, respiratory depression, [[myoclonus|myoclonic jerks]] and pinpoint pupils), seizures ([[tramadol]]), but there is no dose ceiling in patients who accumulate tolerance. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Opioids, while very effective analgesics, may have some unpleasant side-effects.  Patients starting morphine may experience [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] (generally relieved by a short course of [[antiemetic]]s such as [[phenergan]]). [[Pruritus]] (itching) may require switching to a different opioid.  [[Constipation]] occurs in almost all patients on opioids, and [[laxative]]s ([[lactulose]], [[macrogol]]-containing or co-danthramer) are typically co-prescribed.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot;&gt;Oxford Textbook of Palliative Medicine, 3rd ed. (Doyle D, Hanks G, Cherney I and Calman K, eds. Oxford University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

When used appropriately, opioids and similar [[narcotic]] analgesics are otherwise safe and effective, however risks such as addiction and the body becoming used to the drug (tolerance) can occur. The effect of tolerance means that frequent use of the drug may result in its diminished effect so, when safe to do so, the dosage may need to be incresed to maintain effectiveness. This may be of particular concern regarding patients suffering with chronic pain.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Flupirtine===
[[Flupirtine]] is a centrally acting K+ channel opener with weak NMDA antagonist properties. It is used in Europe for moderate to strong pain and migraine and its muscle relaxant properties. It has no anticholinergic properties and is believed be devoid of any activity on dopamine, serotonin or histamin receptors. It is not addictive and tolerance does not develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Klawe|first1=C|last2=Maschke|first2=M|title=Flupirtine: pharmacology and clinical applications of a nonopioid analgesic and potentially neuroprotective compound.|journal=Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy|volume=10|issue=9|pages=1495–500|year=2009|pmid=19505216|doi=10.1517/14656560902988528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific agents===
In patients with chronic or neuropathic pain, various other substances may have analgesic properties.  [[Tricyclic antidepressant]]s, especially [[amitriptyline]], have been shown to improve pain in what appears to be a central manner.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Nefopam is used in Europe for pain relief with concurrent opioids. The exact mechanism of [[carbamazepine]], [[gabapentin]] and [[pregabalin]] is similarly unclear, but these [[anticonvulsant]]s are used to treat neuropathic pain with differing degrees of success. Anticonvulsants are most commonly used for neuropathic pain as their mechanism of action tends to inhibit pain sensation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Specific forms and uses==
===Combinations===
Analgesics are frequently used in combination, such as the [[paracetamol]] and [[codeine]] preparations found in many non-prescription pain relievers.  They can also be found in combination with vasoconstrictor drugs such as [[pseudoephedrine]] for [[Paranasal sinus|sinus]]-related preparations, or with [[antihistamine]] drugs for allergy sufferers.

While the use of paracetamol, as well as aspirin, [[ibuprofen]], [[naproxen]], and other [[NSAIDS]] concurrently with weak to mid-range opiates (up to about the hydrocodone level) has been said to show beneficial synergistic effects by combatting pain at multiple sites of action,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12148679&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mehlisch DR |title=The efficacy of combination analgesic therapy in relieving dental pain |journal=J Am Dent Assoc |volume=133 |issue=7 |pages=861–71 |year=2002 |pmid=12148679 |url=http://jada.ada.org/cgi/content/full/133/7/861 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; several combination analgesic products have been shown to have little efficacy benefits when compared to similar doses of their individual components. These combination analgesics can often result in significant adverse events including accidental overdoses, most often due to confusion which arises from the multiple (and often non-acting) components of these combinations.&lt;ref name=nps01&gt;{{cite journal |author=Murnion B |title=Combination analgesics in adults |journal=Australian Prescriber |issue=33 |pages=113–5 |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/33/4/113/5 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topical or systemic===
Topical analgesia is generally recommended to avoid systemic side-effects.  Painful joints, for example, may be treated with an [[ibuprofen]]- or [[diclofenac]]-containing gel; [[capsaicin]] also is used [[topical cream|topical]]ly.  [[Lidocaine]], an [[anesthetic]], and [[glucocorticoid|steroids]] may be injected into painful joints for longer-term pain relief.  [[Lidocaine]] is also used for painful [[mouth sore]]s and to numb areas for [[dentistry|dental]] work and minor medical procedures.

===Psychotropic agents===
[[Tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC) and some other [[cannabinoids]], either from the ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'' plant or synthetic, have analgesic properties, although the use of cannabis derivatives is currently illegal in many countries. A recent study finds that inhaled cannabis is effective in alleviating neuropathy and pain resulting from e.g. spinal injury and multiple sclerosis.&lt;ref&gt;CMCR: ''CMCR Report February 17th'', California, 2010. http://www.cmcr.ucsd.edu/CMCR_REPORT_FEB17.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other psychotropic analgesic agents include [[ketamine]] (an NMDA receptor antagonist), [[clonidine]] and other α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenoreceptor agonists, and [[mexiletine]] and other local anaesthetic analogues.

===Atypical and/or adjuvant analgesics===
[[Orphenadrine]], [[cyclobenzaprine]], [[scopolamine]], [[atropine]], [[gabapentin]], first-generation [[antidepressants]] and other drugs possessing [[anticholinergic]] and/or [[antispasmodic]] properties are used in many cases along with analgesics to potentiate centrally acting analgesics such as [[opioids]] when used against pain especially of neuropathic origin and to modulate the effects of many other types of analgesics by action in the [[parasympathetic nervous system]].  [[Dextromethorphan]] has been noted to slow the development of tolerance to opioids and exert additional analgesia by acting upon the [[NMDA]] receptors; some analgesics such as [[methadone]] and [[ketobemidone]] and perhaps [[piritramide]] have intrinsic NMDA action. High-alcohol [[liquor]] has been used in the past as an agent for dulling pain, due to the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] depressant effects of [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]], a notable example being the [[American Civil War]]. However, the ability of alcohol to &quot;kill pain&quot; may be inferior to many analgesics used today (e.g. morphine, codeine). As such, the idea of alcohol for analgesia is generally considered a primitive practice in virtually all industrialized countries today.

The use of [[adjuvant]] analgesics is an important and growing part of the pain-control field and new discoveries are made practically every year.  Many of these drugs combat the side effects of opioid analgesics, an added bonus.  For example, [[antihistamines]] including orphenadrine combat the release of histamine caused by many opioids, [[methylphenidate]], [[caffeine]], [[ephedrine]], [[dextroamphetamine]], and [[cocaine]] work against heavy sedation and may elevate mood in distressed patients as do the antidepressants. The use of medicinal [[cannabis]] remains a debated issue.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abiotic stress''' is defined as the negative impact of non-living factors on the living organisms in a specific environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Abiotic_stress|title=Abiotic Stress|publisher=Biology Online|accessdate=2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The non-living variable must influence the environment beyond its normal range of variation to adversely affect the population performance or individual physiology of the organism in a significant way.&lt;ref name = &quot;vine&quot;&gt;Vinebrooke, Rolf D. et al.  “Impacts of multiple stressors on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning: the role of species co-tolerance.”  OIKOS 104: 451– 457, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
Whereas a [[biotic stress]] would include such living disturbances as [[fungi]] or harmful insects, abiotic stress factors, or stressors, are naturally occurring, often intangible, factors such as intense sunlight or wind that may cause harm to the plants and animals in the area affected. Abiotic stress is essentially unavoidable.
Abiotic stress affects animals, but plants are especially dependent on environmental factors, so it is particularly constraining.  Abiotic stress is the most harmful factor concerning the growth and [[Agricultural productivity|productivity of crops]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Gao, Ji-Ping, et al.  “Understanding Abiotic Stress Tolerance Mechanisms:  Recent Studies on Stress Response in Rice.”  Journal of Integrative Plant Biology 49 (6): 742−750, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has also shown that abiotic stressors are at their most harmful when they occur together, in combinations of abiotic stress factors.&lt;ref name =&quot;mitt&quot;&gt;Mittler, Ron.  “Abiotic stress, the field environment and stress combination.” Trends in Plant Science 11(1): 15–19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of abiotic stress==
Abiotic stress comes in many forms.  The most common of the stressors are the easiest for people to identify, but there are many other, less recognizable abiotic stress factors which affect environments constantly.  The most basic stressors include:  high winds, extreme temperatures, drought, flood, and other natural disasters, such as tornados and wildfires.
The lesser-known stressors generally occur on a smaller scale and so are less noticeable, but they include:  poor [[edaphic]] conditions like rock content and pH, high radiation, compaction, contamination, and other, highly specific conditions like rapid [[rehydration]] during seed germination.&lt;ref&gt;Palta, Jiwan P. and Farag, Karim.  “Methods for enhancing plant health, protecting plants from biotic and abiotic stress related injuries and enhancing the recovery of plants injured as a result of such stresses.”  United States Patent 7101828, September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of abiotic stress==
Abiotic stress, as a natural part of every ecosystem, will affect organisms in a variety of ways.  Although these effects may be either beneficial or detrimental, the location of the area is crucial in determining the extent of the impact that abiotic stress will have.  The higher the latitude of the area affected, the greater the impact of abiotic stress will be on that area.  So, a [[taiga]] or boreal forest is at the mercy of whatever abiotic stress factors may come along, while tropical zones are much less susceptible to such stressors.&lt;ref name=&quot;wolf&quot;&gt;Wolfe, A.  “Patterns of biodiversity.”  Ohio State University, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
One example of a situation where abiotic stress plays a constructive role in an ecosystem is in natural wildfires.  While they can be a human safety hazard, it is productive for these ecosystems to burn out every once in a while so that new organisms can begin to grow and thrive.
Even though it is healthy for an ecosystem, a wildfire can still be considered an abiotic stressor, because it puts an obvious stress on individual organisms within the area.  Every tree that is scorched and each bird nest that is devoured is a sign of the abiotic stress.  On the larger scale, though, natural wildfires are positive manifestations of abiotic stress.&lt;ref name=&quot;bruss&quot;&gt;Brussaard, Lijbert, Peter C. de Ruiter, and George G. Brown.  “Soil biodiversity for agricultural sustainability.”  Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment 121:  233–244, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
What also needs to be taken into account when looking for benefits of abiotic stress, is that one phenomenon may not affect an entire ecosystem in the same way.  While a flood will kill most plants living low on the ground in a certain area, if there is rice there, it will thrive in the wet conditions.
Another example of this is in, [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]].  The same types of conditions are usually considered stressful for these two types of organisms.  They act very similarly when exposed to ultraviolet light and most toxins, but at elevated temperatures the phytoplankton reacts negatively, while the [[thermophilic]] zooplankton reacts positively to the increase in temperature.  The two may be living in the same environment, but an increase in temperature of the area would prove stressful only for one of the organisms.&lt;ref name = &quot;vine&quot;/&gt;
Lastly, abiotic stress has enabled species to grow, develop, and evolve, furthering natural selection as it picks out the weakest of a group of organisms.  Both plants and animals have evolved mechanisms allowing them to survive extremes.&lt;ref name=&quot;roel&quot;&gt;Roelofs, D. et al.  “Functional ecological genomics to demonstrate general and specific responses to abiotic stress.”  Functional Ecology 22: 8–18, 2008.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detriments===
The most obvious detriment concerning abiotic stress involves farming.  It has been claimed by one study that abiotic stress causes the most crop loss of any other factor and that most major crops are reduced in their yield by more than 50% from their potential yield.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, W., Vinocur, B. and Altman, A.  “Plant responses to drought, salinity and extreme temperatures towards genetic engineering for stress tolerance.”  Planta 218: 1-14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been speculated that this yield reduction will only worsen with the dramatic climate changes expected in the future.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lane&quot;&gt;Lane, A. and A. Jarvis.  “Changes in Climate will modify the Geography of Crop Suitability: Agricultural Biodiversity can help with Adaptation.”  eJournal 4(1):  1-12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
	Because abiotic stress is widely considered a detrimental effect, the research on this branch of the issue is extensive.  For more information on the harmful effects of abiotic stress, see the sections below on plants and animals.

==In plants==
A plant’s first line of defense against abiotic stress is in its roots.  If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;bruss&quot;/&gt;
	Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment.  It is how plants work together.  In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well.  This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.&lt;ref&gt;Maestre, Fernando T., Jordi Cortina, and Susana Bautista.  “Mechanisms underlying the interaction between Pinus halepensis and the native late-successional shrub Pistacia lentiscus in a semi-arid plantation.”  Ecography 27: 776–786, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
	This facilitation will not go so far as to protect an entire species, however.  For example, cold weather crops like rye, oats, wheat, and apples are expected to decline by about 15% in the next fifty years and strawberries will drop as much as 32% simply because of projected climate changes of a few degrees.  Plants are extremely sensitive to such changes, and do not generally adapt quickly.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lane&quot;/&gt;
	Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area.  When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely.  Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.&lt;ref name =&quot;mitt&quot;/&gt;
There is a classic example of a plant in gramenae angiospermic family: Rice (''Oryza sativa'' L.).Rice plant is used as a stapple food by common people through out the world,specially India.West Bengal is very much dependent on rice based food.Now a days, due to climate change,Rice plant is experienced with different types of abiotic stresses,like drought,salinity,etc.These stressed conditions create a negetive impact on rice production.So,any tolerance is given by the rice genome.Genetic diversity also studied among several rice varieties with different genotypes using molecular markar.

==In animals==
For animals, the most stressful of all the abiotic stressors is heat.  This is because many species are unable to regulate their internal body temperature.  Even in the species that are able to regulate their own temperature, it is not always a completely accurate system.  Temperature determines metabolic rates, heart rates, and other very important factors within the bodies of animals, so an extreme temperature change can easily distress the animal’s body.  Animals can respond to extreme heat, for example, through natural heat acclimation or by burrowing into the ground to find a cooler space.&lt;ref name=&quot;roel&quot;/&gt;
	It is also possible to see in animals that a high genetic diversity is beneficial in providing resiliency against harsh abiotic stressors.  This acts as a sort of stock room when a species is plagued by the perils of natural selection.  A variety of galling insects are among the most specialized and diverse herbivores on the planet, and their extensive protections against abiotic stress factors have helped the insect in gaining that position of honor.&lt;ref&gt;Goncalves-Alvim, Silmary J. and G. Wilson Fernandez.  “Biodiversity of galling insects: historical, community and habitat effects in four neotropical savannas.”  Biodiversity and Conservation 10: 79–98, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In endangered species==
[[Biodiversity]] is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress.  If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low.  If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.&lt;ref name=&quot;bruss&quot;/&gt;  This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related.  It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases.&lt;ref name=&quot;wolf&quot;/&gt;  This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''accusative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''acc'''}}) of a [[noun]] is the [[grammatical case]] used to mark the [[direct object]] of a [[transitive verb]]. The same case is used in many languages for the objects of (some or all) [[preposition]]s.  It is a noun that is having something done to it, usually joined (such as in [[Latin]]) with the [[nominative case]], making it an [[indirect object]].

The accusative case existed in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] and is present in some [[Indo-European languages]] (including [[Latin]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[German language|German]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]), in the [[Uralic languages]], in [[Altaic languages]], and in [[Semitic languages]] (such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]]). [[Finnic languages]], such as Finnish and Estonian, have two cases to mark objects, the accusative and the [[partitive case]]. In [[morphosyntactic alignment]] terms, both perform the accusative function, but the accusative object is [[Telicity|telic]], while the partitive is not.

Modern [[English language|English]], which almost entirely lacks [[declension]] in its nouns, does not have an explicitly marked accusative case even in the pronouns.  Such forms as ''whom'', ''them'', and ''her'' derive rather from the old Germanic [[dative case|dative]] forms, of which the -m and -r endings are characteristic.  These words can arguably be classified in the [[oblique case]] instead.  Most modern English grammarians feel that due to the lack of declension, except in a few pronouns where accusative and dative have been merged, that making case distinctions in English is no longer relevant, and frequently employ the term &quot;[[Objective (grammar)|objective case]]&quot; instead ''(see [[Declension in English]]).''  ''Hine'', a true accusative masculine third person singular pronoun, is attested in some northern English dialects as late as the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Press. ''Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed.''.Oxford, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[English language|English]] name &quot;accusative (case)&quot; is an [[Anglicisation]] of the [[Latin]] ''accūsātīvus'' (''cāsus''),&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|accusativus|accūsātīvus|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was translated from [[Ancient Greek]] {{unicode|''(ptôsis) aitiatikē&amp;#769;''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|ai)tiatikh/|αἰτιατική|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek term can mean either &quot;(inflection) for something caused&quot; or &quot;for an accusation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|accusative}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intended meaning was likely the first, which would be translated as Latin ''causātīvus''&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|accusative}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''effectīvus'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Weir Smyth]]. A Greek grammar for colleges. p. 353, sect. 1551.a.: name of the accusative.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Latin term was a translation of the second. Compare [[Russian language|Russian]] [[wikt:винительный#Russian|вини&amp;#769;тельный]] ''vinítel’nyj'', from [[wikt:винить#Russian|винить]] ''vinít’'' &quot;to blame&quot;.

==Description==
In the sentence ''I see '''the car''''', the [[noun phrase]] ''the car'' is the direct object of the verb &quot;see&quot;. In English, which has mostly lost the case system, the definite article and noun&amp;nbsp;– &quot;the car&quot;&amp;nbsp;– remain in the same form regardless of the grammatical role played by the words. One can correctly use &quot;the car&quot; as the subject of a sentence also: &quot;The car is parked here.&quot;

In a declined language, the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of the article or noun changes in some way according to the grammatical role played by the noun in a given sentence. For example, in [[German language|German]], one possible translation of &quot;the car&quot; is ''der Wagen''. This is the form in the [[nominative case]], used for the subject of a sentence. If this article/noun pair is used as the object of a verb, it (usually) changes to the accusative case, which entails an article shift in German&amp;nbsp;– ''Ich sehe '''den Wagen'''.'' In German, masculine nouns change their definite article from ''der'' to ''den'' in the accusative case.

==Examples==
===Indo-European languages===
==== Latin ====
In Latin, nouns, adjectives, or pronouns in the accusative case (''accusativus'') can be used
* as a [[object (grammar)|direct object]].
* to indicate duration of time. E.g., ''multos annos'', &quot;for many years&quot;; ''ducentos annos'', &quot;for 200 years.&quot;  This is known as the '''accusative of duration of time'''.
* to indicate direction towards which.  E.g. ''domum'', &quot;homewards&quot;; ''Romam'', &quot;to Rome&quot; with no preposition needed. This is known as the '''accusative of place to which''', and is equivalent to the [[lative case]] found in some other languages.
* as the subject of an [[indirect statement]] (e.g. ''Dixit '''me''' fuisse saevum'', &quot;He said that '''I''' had been cruel;&quot; in later Latin works, such as the [[Vulgate]], such a construction is replaced by ''quod'' and a regularly structured sentence, having the subject in the nominative: e.g., ''Dixit quod '''ego''' fueram saevus'').
* with case-specific prepositions such as &quot;per&quot; (through), &quot;ad&quot; (to/toward), and &quot;trans&quot; (across).
* in exclamations, such as ''me miseram,'' &quot;wretched me&quot; (spoken by [[Circe]] to [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] in [[Ovid]]'s ''Remedium Amoris;'' note that this is feminine: the masculine form would be me miser&lt;ins&gt;um&lt;/ins&gt;).

For the accusative endings, see [[Latin declension]].

==== German ====
[[German language|German]] uses the accusative to mark direct objects and objects of certain [[preposition and postposition|prepositions]], or [[adverb]]s relating to time. The accusative is marked for masculine [[article (grammar)|articles]], [[pronoun]]s, and [[adjective]]s.

=====German articles=====
The masculine forms for [[German articles]], e.g., 'the', 'a/an', 'my', etc., change in the accusative case: they always end in -en. The feminine, neutral and plural forms do not change.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-

! Feminine
! Neuter

| Definite article (the)
| ''den''
| die
| das
| die
|-
| Indefinite article (a/an)
| ''einen''
| eine
| ein
| 
|}

For example, &quot;''Hund''&quot; (dog) is a masculine (''der'') word, so the article changes when used in the accusative case:
*''Ich habe einen Hund''. (lit., I have a dog.) In the sentence &quot;a dog&quot; is in the accusative case as it is the second idea (the [[Object (grammar)|object]]) of the sentence.

=====German pronouns=====
Some [[German pronouns]] also change in the accusative case.

=====German prepositions=====
The accusative case is also used after particular German prepositions. These include ''bis, durch, für, gegen, ohne, um'', after which the accusative case is always used, and ''an, auf, hinter, in, neben, über, unter, vor, zwischen'' which can govern either the accusative or the dative. The latter prepositions take the accusative when motion or action is specified (being done into/onto the space), but take the dative when location is specified (being done in/on that space). These prepositions are also used in conjunction with certain verbs, in which case it is the verb in question which governs whether the accusative or dative should be used.

=====German adjectives=====
Adjective endings also change in the accusative case. Another factor that determines the endings of adjectives is whether the adjective is being used after a definite article (the), after an indefinite article (a/an) or without any article before the adjective (''many'' green apples).

=====German adverbial use=====
In German, the accusative case is also used for some adverbial expressions, mostly temporal ones, as in &quot;''Diesen Abend bleibe ich daheim''&quot; (This evening I'm staying at home), where &quot;''diesen Abend''&quot; is marked as accusative, although not a direct object.

==== Russian ====
In Russian, accusative is used not only to display the direct object of an action, but also to indicate the destination or goal of motion. It is also used with some prepositions. The prepositions ''в'' and ''на'' can both take accusative in situations where they are indicating the goal of a motion.

In the [[Grammatical gender|masculine]], Russian also distinguishes between [[animacy|animate and inanimate]] nouns with regard to the accusative; only the animates carry a [[marker (linguistics)|marker]] in this case.

In fact Russian almost lost the real PIE accusative case, since only singular feminine nouns ending in 'a' have a distinct form. Other words use the genitive case or the nominative case in place of the accusative, depending on their [[animacy]].

==== Armenian ====
While the [[Armenian language|Armenian]] dialects both have a [[de facto]] accusative case, Eastern Armenian uses an accusative marker for transitive verbs&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=Armenian_Language_Lessons_Chapter_2#Accusative_case&lt;/ref&gt;

Example:

գիրք - girkh - book (Nominative)&lt;br/&gt;
ուսուցիչ - usuchičh - teacher (Nominative)

Արամը վերցրեց գիրք&lt;u&gt;ը&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;br/&gt;
Aramë verchrech girkh&lt;u&gt;ë&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Aram took the book.

Արամը սիրում է իր ուսուցչ&lt;u&gt;ին&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;br/&gt;
Aramë sirum ē ir usuchičh&lt;u&gt;in&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Aram loves his teacher.

===Constructed languages===
==== Esperanto ====
[[Esperanto grammar]] involves only two cases, a nominative and an accusative. The accusative is formed by the addition of ''-n'' to the nominative form, and is the case used for direct objects. Other objective functions, including dative functions are achieved with prepositions, all of which normally take the nominative case. Direction of motion can be expressed either by the accusative case, or by the preposition ''al'' (to) with the nominative.

==== Ido ====
In [[Ido]] the ''-n'' suffix is optional, as [[subject-verb-object]] order is assumed when it is not present. Note that this is sometimes done in Esperanto, especially by beginners, but it is considered incorrect while in Ido it is the norm.

===Uralic languages===
==== Finnish ====
According to traditional Finnish grammars, the accusative is the case of a total object, while the case of a partial object is the [[partitive case|partitive]]. The accusative is identical either to the [[nominative case|nominative]] or the [[genitive case|genitive]], except for [[personal pronoun]]s and the personal [[interrogative pronoun]] ''kuka/ken'', which have a special accusative form ending in ''-t''.

The major new Finnish grammar, ''[[Iso suomen kielioppi]]'', breaks with the traditional classification to limit the accusative case to the special case of the personal pronouns and ''kuka/ken''. The new grammar considers other total objects as being in the nominative or genitive case.

=== Semitic languages ===

Accusative case marking existed in [[Proto-Semitic]], [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], and [[Ugaritic]]. It is  preserved today only in [[literary Arabic]] and [[Ge'ez]].

==== Akkadian ====

:Nominative: ''awīlum'' (a/the man)
:Accusative: ''apaqqid awīlam'' (I trust a/the man)

==== Arabic ====

:Nominative: ''rajulun'' (a man)
:Accusative: ''as'alu rajulan'' (I ask a man) ''as'alu ar-rajula'' (I ask the man)

The accusative case is called in Arabic النصب ''an-naṣb'', and it has many other uses in addition to marking the object of a verb.

[[Image:Consécration-de-Déodat.jpg|thumb|Apostolic succession is transmitted in an [[episcopal consecration]] by the [[Laying on of hands#Christianity|laying on of hands]].]]

'''Apostolic succession''' ({{lang-he|האפיפיור הירושה}}, {{lang-el|Αποστολική διαδοχή}}) is a doctrine, held by some [[Christian denominations]], which asserts that the chosen successors (properly ordained [[bishops]]) of the [[Twelve Apostles]], from the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first century]] to the present day, have inherited the spiritual, ecclesiastical and [[sacramental]] authority, power, and responsibility that were conferred upon them by the Apostles, who in turn received [[Great Commission|their spiritual authority]] from [[Jesus Christ]].

The [[Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox churches]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox churches]], the [[Anglican Communion]] and some [[Lutheran church]]es are the predominant proponents of this doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Assyrian Church of the East]] and the [[Old Catholic Church]] all claim apostolic succession, as do [[Lutheran church]]es in some countries, the [[Mar Thoma Church]] in India, and the [[Polish National Catholic Church]], Encyclopedia of American Religions, J. Gordon Melton, editor. 6th Ed., 1999. pp 93-94.&lt;/ref&gt; To them, present-day [[bishops]], as the successors of previous bishops, going back to the early days of Christianity, have spiritual and ecclesiastical power by this unbroken chain of ordinations stemming from the Apostles. This link with the Apostles guarantees for them their authority in matters of faith, morals and the valid administration of sacraments. This is reaffirmed every Sunday in the reciting of the [[Nicene Creed]] by priests and congregants, with the words, &quot;We believe in [[Four Marks of the Church|one holy and catholic and apostolic Church]]...&quot;  All adherents view proper consecration of bishops as essential to maintaining apostolic succession.

The [[Catholic Church]] additionally believes that a bishop's authority on matters of faith and morals is infallible when what he teaches is universally taught by all the [[college of bishops]] in communion with the [[Bishop of Rome]] (the [[Pope]]), who in turn is seen as the [[papal primacy|successor]] of [[Saint Peter|Saint Peter the Apostle]] and the [[Vicar of Christ]] on Earth.  Nevertheless, Apostolic succession is to be distinguished from the [[Primacy of Simon Peter|Petrine supremacy]] (see [[Papacy]] and [[Coptic Pope]]). 

Most Protestants consider the authority given to the apostles as unique, proper to them alone. They reject any doctrine of a succession of their power. The Protestant view of ecclesiastical authority differs accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Apostolic succession&quot;, Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition, 10/1/2009. Web: 20 February 2010. [http://www.questia.com/library/encyclopedia/apostolic_succession.jsp Apostolic Succession in Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining features==
Adherents maintain that apostolic succession &quot;is one of four elements which define the true Church of Jesus Christ&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Oskar Sommel, ''Rudolf Stählin Christliche Religion,'' Frankfurt 1960, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; and legitimizes the sacramental offices, as it is considered necessary for a bishop to perform legitimate or &quot;valid&quot; ordinations of [[priest]]s, [[deacon]]s and other bishops. Apostolic succession is transmitted during [[Consecration#Consecration of bishops|episcopal consecrations]] (the [[ordination]] of bishops) by the [[laying on of hands]] of bishops previously consecrated within the apostolic succession. This lineage of ordination is traceable, according to &quot;Apostolic&quot; churches, to the original [[Twelve Apostles]], thus making the Church the continuation of the early [[Apostolic Age|Apostolic Christian community]].

Within the sacramental theology of these churches, only [[bishop]]s and [[Priesthood|presbyters (priests)]] ordained by bishops in the apostolic succession can validly celebrate or &quot;confect&quot; several of the other [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]], including the [[Eucharist]], [[Confession|reconciliation of penitents]], [[confirmation]] and [[anointing of the sick]]. To those who claim it, apostolic succession is an important dividing line: the lack of it is the primary basis on which Protestant communities are not considered ''churches'' by the Orthodox churches and the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;vatican.va&quot;&gt;&quot;Responses to Some Questions Regarding Certain Aspects of the Doctrine on the Church&quot;, published July 10, 2007.[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070629_responsa-quaestiones_en.html Responses to Some Questions Regarding Certain Aspects of the Doctrine on the Church]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Anglican claim of apostolic succession is recognized by some [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches, it is not officially recognized by the [[Catholic Church]], based on [[Pope Leo XIII|Pope Leo XIII's]] [[papal bull]] ''[[Apostolicae Curae]]''. However, since the promulgation of ''Apostolicae Curae'', Anglican bishops have acquired [[Old Catholic]] lines of apostolic succession recognized by Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;dufort&quot;/&gt;

[[Eastern Orthodox]] theology and ecclesiology teach that each bishop is equal to the other bishops, even the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]], who is ''[[Primus inter pares|first amongst equals]].'' The Roman Catholic Church and many early Christian writers teach that [[Jesus]] gave [[Saint Peter]] a unique primacy among the apostles. Roman Catholics teach that this primacy has been passed on in the office of the [[Papacy]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Apostolicity as doctrinal continuity==
{{Ref improve section|date=May 2009}}

{{rquote|right|Let them produce the original records of their churches; let them unfold the roll of their bishops, running down in due succession from the beginning in such a manner that [that first bishop of theirs] bishop shall be able to show for his ordainer and predecessor some one of the apostles or of apostolic men&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0311.htm The Prescription against Heretics: Chapter 32]&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Tertullian]]}}

While many of the more ancient Churches within the [[historical episcopate]] state that [[Holy Orders]] are valid only through apostolic succession, most of the various [[Protestant]] denominations would deny the need of maintaining episcopal continuity with the early Church. Such Protestants generally hold that one important qualification of the Apostles was that they were chosen directly by Jesus and that they witnessed the resurrected Christ. According to this understanding, the work of the [[Twelve Apostles|twelve]] (and the Apostle [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]), together with the prophets of the [[Israelite#The Twelve Tribes|twelve tribes of Israel]], provide the doctrinal foundation for the whole church of subsequent history through the Scriptures of the Bible. To share with the apostles the same faith, to believe their word as found in the Scriptures, to receive the same Holy Spirit, is to them the only meaningful &quot;continuity&quot; with what such Protestants hold the early Christians to have believed, because it is in this sense only that men have fellowship with God in the truth (an extension of the new [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation-era]] doctrines of ''[[sola fide]]'' and ''[[sola scriptura]]''). The most meaningful ''apostolic succession'' for most Protestants, then, is a &quot;faithful succession&quot; of apostolic teaching. There is, of course, much disagreement among various Protestant denominations about the exact content of apostolic teaching, ranging from fundamental doctrinal disagreements to lesser side-issues.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

It is worth noting, however, that the [[First Epistle of Clement]] which is commonly dated to the 1st century and claims to be written by the Roman Church (the [[chair of St. Peter]] and the center of the unity of the Church, according to Catholic doctrine) which was established by the Apostles, suggests a belief in apostolic succession&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clement of Rome|title=First Epistle of Clement|pages=1 Clement 42:44-45}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clement of Rome|title=First Epistle of Clement|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-lightfoot.html|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; , as does also the Epistles of [[Ignatius of Antioch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ignatius|title=Epistle to the Ephesians|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ante-Nicene_Fathers/Volume_I/IGNATIUS/Epistle_to_the_Ephesians:_Shorter_and_Longer_Versions/Chapter_VI.|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who was a personal disciple of the Apostles John and Paul. Also worth noting is the fact that others besides the twelve Apostles and Saint Paul are called &quot;Apostles&quot; in the New Testament. Also noteworthy is that the Apostle Paul, though given spiritual authority directly by Christ, did not embark on his apostleship without conferring with those who were apostles before him as he notes in his [[Epistle to the Galatians]]. By contrast, some Protestant groups such as the [[Charismatic movement|charismatic]] and the [[British New Church Movement]] include &quot;apostles&quot; among the offices that should be evident into modern times in &quot;a true church&quot;, though they never trace a historical line of succession or attempt to confer, like Paul, with those who were &quot;apostles&quot; before them. The founders or senior leaders of a church grouping may be referred to as the apostles, and they may have been ordained by self-ordination, or appointed by a congregation. &quot;[[Church planting]]&quot; is seen as a key role of these present-day apostles.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Those who hold to the importance of episcopal apostolic succession would counter the above by appealing to the [[New Testament]], which, they say, implies a personal apostolic succession (from [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] to [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] and [[Apostle Titus|Titus]], for example) and which states that Jesus gave the Apostles a &quot;blank check&quot; to lead the Church as they saw fit under the guidance of the [[Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleref2-nb|Matt|18:18}} and [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] [[Council of Jerusalem|Chapter 15]], for example&lt;/ref&gt; They appeal as well to other documents of the early Church, especially the Epistle of St. Clement to the Church at Corinth, written around 96 AD. In it, [[Pope Clement I|Clement]] defends the authority and prerogatives of a group of &quot;[[elder (religious)|elder]]s&quot; or &quot;[[bishop]]s&quot; in the Corinthian Church which had, apparently, been deposed and replaced by the congregation on its own initiative. In this context, Clement explicitly states that the apostles appointed bishops as successors and had directed that these bishops should in turn appoint their own successors; given this, such leaders of the Church were not to be removed without cause and not in this way. Further, proponents of the necessity of the personal apostolic succession of bishops within the Church point to the universal practice of the undivided early Church (up to 431 AD), from which, as organizations, the Latin Catholic and Eastern Orthodox (at that point in time one Church until 1054, see [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]]), as well as Oriental Orthodox and Assyrian Churches have all directly descended.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

At the same time, no defender of the personal apostolic succession of bishops would deny the importance of doctrinal continuity in the Church.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

These churches hold that Christ entrusted the leadership of the community of believers, and the obligation to transmit and preserve the &quot;deposit of faith&quot; (the experience of Christ and his teachings contained in the doctrinal &quot;tradition&quot; handed down from the time of the apostles, the written portion of which is Scripture) to the apostles, and the apostles passed on this role by ordaining bishops after them.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Catholic and Orthodox theology additionally holds that the power and authority to confect the [[sacraments]], or at least all the sacraments aside from baptism and matrimony (the first of which may be administered by anyone, the second of which is administered by the couple to each other) are passed on '''only''' through the sacrament of Holy Orders, and an unbroken line of [[ordination]] of bishops to the Apostles is necessary for the valid celebration of the sacraments today. Roman Catholics recognize the validity of the apostolic successions of the bishops, and therefore the rest of the clergy, of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian, Old Catholic (Union of Utrecht only). Since 1896, Rome has not fully recognized all Anglican orders as valid. The Eastern Orthodox generally recognize Roman Catholic orders, but have a different concept of the apostolic succession as it exists outside of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. This is also the case with Anglicans or other groups having apostolic succession. The validity of a priest's ordination is decided by each autocephalic Orthodox church.[4] Neither the Catholic Church nor the Orthodox churches recognizes the validity of the apostolic succession of the clergy of the Protestant denominations, in large measure because of their theology of the Eucharist and the abandonment of more traditional views of the [[sacraments]] and sacramentalism.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Traditional doctrine==
{{rquote|right|Wherefore we must obey the priests of the Church who have succession from the Apostles, as we have shown, who, together with succession in the episcopate, have received the mark of truth according to the will of the Father; all others, however, are to be suspected, who separated themselves from the principal succession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103426.htm Adversus Haereses (Book IV, Chapter 26)]&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Irenaeus]]}}

&lt;!-- Was Irenaeus the first to hold this view? state this view? use the term? Who did? --&gt;

The early [[Nicene Creed]] of the Church, in the form given to it by the [[First Council of Constantinople]], affirms that the Church is &quot;one, holy, catholic, and apostolic&quot;. Of these &quot;four marks&quot; of the true Church, the &quot;apostolic&quot; mark has historically been understood principally as a reference to apostolic succession. Even so, the practice of the ancient church has also been to designate churches as apostolic, even without a succession of bishops, simply for holding to the doctrines professed by the twelve apostles.{{Clarify|date=November 2010}}{{Which?|date=November 2010}}

The literature on this traditional doctrine is substantial. Many inferences have been drawn from it. For example, the unbrokenness of apostolic succession is seen as significant because of the promise made by Jesus Christ that the &quot;gates of hell&quot; ({{bibleref2|Matthew|16:18|NRSV}}) would not prevail against the Church, and his promise that he would be with the apostles to &quot;the end of the age&quot;.{{bibleref2c|Matthew|28:20|NRSV}} According to this interpretation,{{By whom|date=November 2010}} a complete disruption or end of such apostolic succession would mean that these promises were not kept. The same would be true if an intact apostolic succession should completely abandon the teachings of the apostles and their immediate successors. An abandonment hypothetical example might imagine all the bishops of the world agreeing to abrogate the [[Nicene Creed]] or to repudiate the [[Bible]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Some Eastern Christians hold that the Western papal [[Catholic Church]] lost all claim to apostolic succession by an illegitimate addition of the [[Filioque clause]] to the Nicene Creed incorporated by the Western church, which began with the teachings of Augustine. They see the rift as resulting in the loss of apostolic succession in the western churches.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} This is a minority view, however.

[[Papal primacy]] is different though related to apostolic succession as described here. The Catholic Church has traditionally claimed a unique leadership role for the Apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]], believed to have been named by Jesus as head of the Apostles and as a focus of their unity, who became the first [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]], and whose successors accordingly became the leaders of the worldwide Church as well. Even so, Catholicism acknowledges the papacy is built on apostolic succession, not the other way around. As such, apostolic succession is a foundational doctrine of authority in the Catholic Church.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Churches claiming apostolic succession==
Churches that claim the [[historic episcopate]] include the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian]], [[Independent Catholic Churches|Independent Catholic]], the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Communion]], and several [[Lutheran Church]]es (see below). The former churches teach that apostolic succession is maintained through the consecration of their [[bishop]]s in unbroken personal succession back to the apostles or at least to leaders from the apostolic era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01648b.htm Apostolicity] [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglican and some Lutheran Churches do not specifically teach this but exclusively practice episcopal ordination.

These churches generally hold that Jesus Christ founded a community of believers and selected the apostles to serve, as a group, as the leadership of that community.

===Catholic Church===
{{rquote|right|

Since, however, it would be tedious, in such a volume as this, to reckon up the successions of all the churches, we do put to confusion all those who, in whatever manner, whether by an evil self-pleasing, by vainglory, or by blindness and perverse opinion, assemble in unauthorized meetings; [we do this, I say,] by indicating that tradition derived from the apostles, of the very great, the very ancient, and universally known Church founded and organized at Rome by the two most glorious Apostles, Peter and Paul; as also [by pointing out] the faith preached to men, which comes down to our time by means of the successions of the bishops. For it is a matter of necessity that every church should agree with this Church, on account of its preeminent authority, that is, the faithful everywhere, inasmuch as the apostolical tradition has been preserved continuously by those [faithful men] who exist everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103303.htm Adversus Haereses (Book III, Chapter 3)]&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Irenaeus]], d. 202}}

On June 29, 2007 the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], under the prefecture of [[William Levada|Cardinal William Levada]], explained why apostolic succession is integral to, and indeed, &quot;a constitutive element&quot; of the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vatican.va&quot; /&gt; The Vatican was asked why the [[Second Vatican Council]] and all Catholic statements before and after the Council do not consider Protestant Christian Communities as ''Churches''.
The Vatican responded that &quot;according to Catholic doctrine, these Communities do not enjoy ''apostolic succession'' in the sacrament of Orders, and are, therefore, deprived of a constitutive element of the Church. These ecclesial Communities which, specifically because of the absence of the sacramental priesthood, have not preserved the genuine and integral substance of the Eucharistic Mystery cannot, according to Catholic doctrine, be called 'Churches' in the proper sense&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;vatican.va&quot; /&gt;

In [[Roman Catholic]] theology, the doctrine of apostolic succession states that Christ gave the full sacramental authority of the Church to the [[Twelve Apostles]] in the sacrament of [[Holy Orders]], making them the first [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]]. By conferring the fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders on the apostles, they were given the authority to confer the sacrament of Holy Orders on others, thus consecrating more bishops in a direct lineage that can trace its origin back to the Twelve Apostles and Christ. This direct succession of bishops from the apostles to the present day bishops is referred to as apostolic succession. The Catholic Church also holds that within the College of Apostles, [[St. Peter|Peter]] was picked out for the unique role of leadership and to serve as the source of unity among the apostles, a role among the bishops and within the church inherited by the [[pope]] as Peter's successor today.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;If the very order of episcopal succession is to be considered, how much more surely, truly, and safely do we number them from Peter himself, to whom, as to one representing the whole Church, the Lord said, ‘Upon this rock I will build my Church’....{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|16:18}} Peter was succeeded by Linus, Linus by Clement, Clement by Anacletus, Anacletus by Evaristus...&quot; (St. Augustine; Letters 53:1:2 [A.D. 412]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Roman Catholic position is summarized this way: &quot;The Lord says to Peter: ‘I say to you,’ he says, ‘that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it ....’{{bibleref2c|Mt.|16:18}} On him [Peter] he builds the Church, and to him he gives the command to feed the sheep,{{bibleref2c|Jn|21:17}} and although he assigns a like power to all the apostles, yet he founded a single chair [cathedra], and he established by his own authority a source and an intrinsic reason for that unity.... If someone [today] does not hold fast to this unity of Peter, can he imagine that he still holds the faith? If he [should] desert the chair of Peter upon whom the Church was built, can he still be confident that he is in the Church?&quot;
(Cyprian of Carthage; The Unity of the Catholic Church 4; first edition [A.D. 251]). http://www.catholic.com/library/Peter_Successors.asp early Christian writings on papal succession&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholicism holds that Christ entrusted the Apostles with the leadership of the community of believers, and the obligation to transmit and preserve the &quot;deposit of faith&quot; (the experience of Christ and his teachings contained in the doctrinal &quot;tradition&quot; handed down from the time of the apostles and the written portion, which is Scripture). The apostles then passed on this office and authority by ordaining bishops to follow after them.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Roman Catholic theology holds that the apostolic succession effects the power and authority to administer the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]] except for [[baptism]] and [[matrimony]]. (Baptism may be administered by anyone and matrimony by the couple to each other). Authority to so administer such sacraments is passed on only through the sacrament of [[Holy Orders]], a rite by which a priest is ordained (ordination can be conferred only by a bishop). The bishop, of course, must be from an unbroken line of bishops stemming from the original apostles selected by Jesus Christ. Thus, apostolic succession is necessary for the valid celebration of the sacraments today.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the early 18th century, Pope Benedict XIII, whose orders were descended from [[Scipione Rebiba]], personally consecrated at least 139 bishops for various important European sees, including German, French, English and New World bishops. These bishops in turn consecrated bishops almost exclusively for their respective countries causing other episcopal lineages to die off&lt;ref&gt;[http://mysite.verizon.net/res7gdmc/aposccs/ Apostolic succession in the Roman Catholic Church]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Roman Catholics recognize the validity of the apostolic successions of the bishops, and therefore the rest of the clergy, of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian, Old Catholic, and some Independent Catholic Churches. Rome does not fully recognize all Anglican orders as valid. This conflict stems over the Anglican Church's revision of its rite of ordination for its bishops during the 16th century. Most of today's Anglican bishops would trace their succession back through a bishop who was ordained with the revised form and thus would be viewed as invalid. However, all Anglican bishops in Europe today&lt;ref name=&quot;dufort&quot;/&gt; can claim a line of succession through bishops who had only been ordained through the old rite. This was achieved through several different means: ordinations by the schismatic Catholic bishops of the Old Catholic and Independent Catholic Churches who converted to Anglicanism.

====Debate over 'bishop' role in apostolic succession a church-dividing issue====
According to liberal Catholic theologian Richard P. McBrien, debate over the role of &quot;bishop&quot; in apostolic succession is a church-dividing issue. He calls for rejection of what he terms the passing-the-baton theory which he characterizes as &quot;an overly simplistic, mechanistic notion.&quot; McBrien says many Catholics accept the commonly-understood definition of the doctrine; specifically, the claim that each validly ordained Catholic bishop can trace his episcopal consecration in an unbroken line back to one of the original apostles or to the apostles, collectively. He quotes Jesuit Professor Francis Sullivan's two reasons for opposing such a view:

* The apostles were not bishops in the present-day meaning of the word. They were missionaries and founders of local churches.
* Second, while some local churches had pastoral leaders who were called bishops, {{Bibleref2c|Ac|20:17-35||Ac 20:17-35}} it remains unclear whether these “bishops” were appointed or ordained by the apostle Paul, or by any other apostle.

McBrien, professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame, has no complaint with the succession doctrine, but with the way it is so often explained. He says that Catholic theologians today would point to Vatican&amp;nbsp;II’s declaration that apostolic succession is “by divine institution” (Dogmatic Constitution on the Church). McBrien maintains this interpretation should ''not'' be understood to mean that Christ explicitly determined the episcopal structures of either the local churches or dioceses. Boston College theologian Francis Sullivan says that “apostolic succession in the episcopate remains a church-dividing issue,” a source of debate even within the Catholic Church. There are the differing interpretations offered by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on the one side, and by many Catholic theologians on the other.&lt;ref&gt;McBrien, Richard P. &quot;Debate over role of 'bishop' in apostolic succession is a church-dividing issue.&quot; The National Catholic Reporter, Sept 19, 2008. Web: 21 February 2010. [http://ncronline.org/node/1862 http://ncronline.org/node/1862] &quot;Debate over role of 'bishop' in apostolic succession is a church-dividing issue.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, from a Catholic point of view, the bishops in communion with the Pope (the Church's [[Magisterium]]) have the final say in the matter, as they, not theologians, are the successors of the Apostles and have doctrinal authority.

===Orthodox Churches===
[[Image:Russian Orthodox Episcopal Ordination.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Consecration of a Bishop, by [[Russian Orthodox]] [[Patriarch]] [[Patriarch Alexius II|Alexius II]] (left) and other bishops.]]

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Russian Orthodox Episcopal Ordination.jpg|thumb|Patriarch Alexius II of Moscow and All Russia consecrating a Russian Orthodox diocesan bishop. Ordination of a bishop, and thus continuation of apostolic succession, takes place through a ritual centered on the imposition of hands and prayer.]] --&gt;Orthodox Christians view apostolic succession as an important, God-ordained mechanism by which the structure and teaching of the Church are perpetuated. While Eastern Orthodox sources often refer to the bishops as &quot;successors of the apostles&quot; under the influence of Scholastic theology, strict Orthodox ecclesiology and theology hold that all legitimate bishops are properly successors of Peter.&lt;ref&gt;See Meyendorff J., Byzantine Theology&lt;/ref&gt; This also means that presbyters (or &quot;priests&quot;) are successors of the apostles. As a result, Orthodox theology makes a distinction between a geographical or historical succession and proper [[Ontology|ontological]] or ecclesiological succession. Hence, the bishops of [[Pope|Rome]] and [[Bishop of Antioch|Antioch]] can be considered successors of Peter in a historical sense on account of Peter's presence in the early community. This does not imply that these bishops are more successors of Peter than all others in an ontological sense.&lt;ref&gt;Cleenewerck, Laurent. His Broken Body. Washington, DC: EUC Press, 2007. p. 86-89&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ancient canons still observed with the Orthodox communion, a bishop must be consecrated by at least three other bishops; so-called &quot;single handed ordinations&quot; do not exist. Moreover, bishops are never ordained &quot;at large&quot; but only for a specific Eucharist community, in due historical and sacramental succession.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

====Traditional Western churches as seen by Eastern churches====
The [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] have often permitted non-Orthodox clergy to be rapidly ordained within Orthodoxy as a matter of pastoral necessity and [[Economy (Eastern Orthodoxy)|economia]]. Priests entering Eastern Orthodoxy from Oriental Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism have usually been received by &quot;vesting&quot; and have been allowed to function immediately within Eastern Orthodoxy as priests. Recognition of Roman Catholic orders by the Russian Orthodox Church was stipulated in 1667 by the [[Moscow Sobor of 1666–1667|Synod of Moscow]],&lt;ref&gt;Cleenewerck, Laurent. His Broken Body. Washington, DC: EUC Press, 2007. p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; but this position is not universal within the Eastern Orthodox communion.

In addition to a line of historic transmission, [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] churches additionally require that a person who holds a high position in a hierarchy maintain Orthodox Church doctrine, which they hold to be that of the apostles and communion with other Orthodox bishops.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], which is one of the Oriental Orthodox churches, recognizes Roman Catholic episcopal consecrations without qualification.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Anglican Communion===
The [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]]'s claim to apostolic succession is rooted in its evolution as part of the Western Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglican.org/church/ChurchHistory.html The Anglican Domain: Church History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Apostolic succession is viewed not so much as conveyed mechanically through an unbroken chain of the laying-on of hands, but as expressing continuity with the unbroken chain of commitment, beliefs and mission starting with the first apostles; and as hence emphasising the enduring yet evolving nature of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofe.anglican.org/info/papers/pmreview/pmrappendix1.doc Document Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anglican—Roman Catholic International Commission]] report expressed broad agreement in the nature of apostolic succession as the ‘effective sign’ of the apostolicity of the whole people of God, living in fidelity to the teaching and mission of the apostles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofe.anglican.org/info/ccu/europe/ecumbackground/may_they_all_be_one.rtf Council for Christian Unity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Church of England]] declared independence from the [[Pope]] in the 16th century, the [[Church of England]] retained the [[episcopal polity]] and apostolic succession inherent in the Catholic Church. At first the Church of England continued to adhere to the doctrinal and liturgical norms of the Catholic Church. However, in the years following the split, the Church of England was increasingly influenced by the [[Protestant]] theology popular on the continent. English Reformers such as [[Richard Hooker]] rejected the Catholic position that Apostolic Succession is divinely commanded or necessary for true Christian ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Archer |first1=Stanley |last2= |first2= |year=1993 |title=Hooker on Apostolic Succession: The Two Voices |journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal |publisher= |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=67–74 |url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/2541798 |doi=|quote=&quot;While he argues that the rank originated with the Apostles, enjoyed divine approval, and flourished throughout Christendom, he rejects the view inherent in the Catholic position that the office is divinely commanded or is a result of divine law.&quot; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orthodox judgments====
In the 20th century there have been a variety of positions taken by the various [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es on the validity of Anglican orders. In 1922 the Patriarch of Constantinople recognized them as valid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgbmxd/patriarc.htm The Ecumenical Patriarch on Anglican Orders&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: &quot;That the orthodox theologians who have scientifically examined the question have almost unanimously come to the same conclusions and have declared themselves as accepting the validity of Anglican Orders.&quot;

Succeeding judgments, however, have been more conflicting. The Eastern Orthodox churches require a totality of common teaching to recognize orders and in this broader view find ambiguities in Anglican teaching and practice problematic. Accordingly, in practice Anglican clergy who convert to Orthodoxy are treated as if they had not been ordained and must be ordained in the Eastern Orthodox communion as would a lay person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodox.clara.net/orthodoxy_and_anglicanism.htm The Orthodox Web Site for information about the faith, life and worship of the Orthodox Church]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roman Catholic judgments====
In the Catholic Church, [[Pope Leo XIII]] stated in his 1896 [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Apostolicae Curae]]'' that the [[Catholic Church]] believes specifically that the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]]'s consecrations are &quot;absolutely null and utterly void&quot; because of changes made to the rite of consecration under [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], thus denying that Anglicans participate in the apostolic succession. Anglican clergy, then, are ordained as Catholic priests upon entry into the Catholic Church.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

A reply from the Archbishops of Canterbury and York (1896) was issued to counter Pope Leo's arguments: ''[[Saepius Officio]]: Answer of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York to the Bull Apostolicae Curae of H. H. Leo XIII''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgbmxd/saepius.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It was argued in their reply that if the Anglican orders were invalid, then the Roman orders were as well:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For if the Pope shall by a new decree declare our Fathers of two hundred and fifty years ago wrongly ordained, there is nothing to hinder the inevitable sentence that by the same law all who have been similarly ordained have received no orders. And if our Fathers, who used in 1550 and 1552 forms which as he (the Pope) says are null, were altogether unable to reform them in 1662, (Roman) Fathers come under the self-same law. And if Hippolytus and Victor and Leo and Gelasius and Gregory have some of them said too little in their rites about the priesthood and the high priesthood, and nothing about the power of offering the sacrifice of the Body and Blood of Christ, the Church of Rome herself has an invalid priesthood...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgbmxd/saepius.htm Archbishops of England: ''Saepius Officio'': Answer of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York to the Bull Apostolicae Curae of H. H. Leo XIII]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Catholics argue, this argument does not consider the sacramental intention involved in validating Holy Orders. In other words, Catholics believe that the ordinands were reworded so as to invalidate the ordinations because the intention behind the word substitution was a fundamental change in Anglican understanding of the priesthood.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

It is Roman Catholic doctrine that the teaching of ''Apostolicae Curae'' is a truth to be &quot;held definitively&quot;, as evidenced by commentary by then-Cardinal Ratzinger, currently Pope Benedict XVI:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
With regard to those truths connected to revelation by historical necessity and which are to be held definitively, but are not able to be declared as divinely revealed, the following examples can be given: the legitimacy of the election of the Supreme Pontiff or of the celebration of an ecumenical council, the canonizations of saints (dogmatic facts), the declaration of Pope Leo XIII in the Apostolic Letter Apostolicae Curae on the invalidity of Anglican ordinations...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDFADTU.HTM Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: ''Doctrinal commentary on the concluding formula of the ''professio fidei]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&quot;While firmly restating the judgment of ''Apostolicae Curae'' that Anglican ordination is invalid, the Catholic Church takes account of the involvement, in some Anglican episcopal ordinations, of bishops of the Old Catholic Church of the Union of Utrecht who are validly ordained. In particular and probably rare cases the authorities in Rome may judge that there is a 'prudent doubt' concerning the invalidity of priestly ordination received by an individual Anglican minister ordained in this line of succession.&quot; This was a statement issued by Cardinal [[Basil Hume]] to explain the conditional character of his ordination of [[Graham Leonard]], former Anglican bishop of the Diocese of London, to the priesthood,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/nj/malleus/hume_statement.html Statement of Cardinal Hume on the Ordination of Anglican Bishop Graham Leonard as a Roman Catholic Priest]&lt;/ref&gt; but is not widely endorsed. Since ''Apostolicae Curae'' was issued many Anglican jurisdictions have revised their ordinals, bringing them more in line with ordinals of the early Church. The [[Nag's Head Fable]] discrediting Matthew Parker's ordination was dismissed as an invention long before the issuance of ''Apostolicae Curae''.

Timothy Dufort, writing in [[The Tablet]] in 1982, argued that by 1969 all Anglican bishops had acquired apostolic succession fully recognized by Rome,&lt;ref name=&quot;dufort&quot;&gt;Timothy Dufort, ''The Tablet'', 29 May 1982, pp. 536–538.&lt;/ref&gt; since from the 1930s [[Old Catholic]] bishops (whose orders Rome recognizes as valid) have acted as co-consecrators in the ordination of Anglican bishops. This view is not accepted by the Roman Catholic Church itself, which continues to require that Anglican clergy be ordained absolutely (not conditionally) if they are to exercise a ministry in that church.

===Porvoo Communion of Churches===
Negotiated at [[Järvenpää]], Finland, and inaugurated with a celebration of the eucharist at [[Porvoo Cathedral]] in 1992, this agreement of unity includes the mutual recognition of the traditional apostolic succession among the following Churches:

* Lutheran Churches: [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Iceland]], [[Church of Norway]], [[Church of Sweden]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], [[Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Lithuania]], [[Church of Denmark]], observer: [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia]].&lt;ref&gt;See below, section: &quot;Lutheran Churches&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Anglican Communion: [[Church of Ireland]], [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], [[Church of England]], the [[Church in Wales]], the [[Lusitanian Catholic Apostolic Evangelical Church]], and the [[Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church]].

Of note is the fact that at least one of the Scandinavian Lutheran Churches in the Porvoo Communion of Churches, the [[Church of Denmark]] has bishops, but strictly speaking they were not in the historic apostolic succession prior to their entry into the Porvoo Communion, since their Episcopate and Holy Orders derived from Dr. [[Johannes Bugenhagen]], who was a pastor, not a bishop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anglicanhistory.org/lutherania/denmark.html The Church of Denmark and the Anglican Communion]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Church of Denmark joined the Porvoo Communion of Churches.

===Lutheran churches===
Wide variations exist within Lutheranism on this issue. Most Lutheran churches in Scandinavian countries (see immediately above and below) are favorable to the traditional doctrine of apostolic succession. Others de-emphasize it, e.g., many German Lutheran churches in former Prussian lands, resulting from their state-ordered union with Reformed (Calvinist) churches in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Also, evidently in some churches the title of bishop was re-introduced without reference to apostolic succession, which happened in most cases under Nazi influence. Christliche Religion, Oskar Simmel, Rudolf Stählin (Frankfurt 1960), at 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years a number of Lutheran churches at the most Catholic edge of the Evangelical Catholic [[High Church Lutheran]] spectrum in the United States of America have accepted the doctrine of apostolic succession and have successfully recovered it, generally from [[Independent Catholic Churches]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pastorzip.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.pastorzip.org/uslutheranlinx.html Pastor Zip's US Lutheran Web Links - Evangelical Catholics]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Claim to Apostolic Succession====
In Scandinavia, most [[Lutheran]] churches participating in the [[Porvoo Communion]],&lt;ref&gt;See section immediately above.&lt;/ref&gt; those of Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, and Lithuania, believe that they ordain their bishops in the apostolic succession in lines stemming from the original apostles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ind-movement.org/intro.html Introduction to the World of Autocephalous Churches in the Apostolic Succession]. As well, the [[Old Catholic Church]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Several new and often small churches claiming to be within the historic episcopate recognize the ''Porvoo'' churches, especially the [[Church of Sweden]] and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], as maintaining apostolic succession, despite their [[Lutheranism]]. Cf., [http://www.ind-movement.org/intro.html Ind-Movement: Introduction to the World of Autocephalous Churches in the Apostolic Succession]&lt;/ref&gt; This view is not supported by the Roman Catholic Church,&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01641a.htm Catholic  Encyclopedia: Apostolic Succession&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; nor by all of Orthodoxy. Two other Lutheran churches of Scandinavia, those of Denmark and Latvia, were observers at Porvoo.

[[The Lutheran Evangelical Protestant Church|Lutheran Evangelical Protestant Church]], representing the earliest Lutherans in America, has autonomous and congregationally-oriented ministries and believes it consecrates deacons, priests and bishops in valid and historic apostolic succession. This must be done through the laying on of hands during the celebration of Holy Communion. Only bishops may ordain deacons, priests and other bishops into apostolic succession. The newly consecrated bishop's name is added to the apostolic lineage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orgsites.com/pa/lutheranepc/index.html Lutheran Evangelical Protestant Church&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lutheran Orthodox Church]] traces its historic lineage of apostolic succession through established lines.&lt;ref&gt;The lineages include the Episcopal, Anglican, Church of Sweden, and Old Catholic.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 it had broken away from the Lutheran Evangelical Protestant Church.&lt;ref&gt;Its founder, Bishop Sam Guido, was once the Presiding Bishop of the [[Lutheran Evangelical Protestant Church]], (LEPC) when apostolic succession lineage was offered to LEPC bishops. He, along with the Executive Bishop, Ray Copp, then accepted the lines of apostolic succession from fellow bishops of the several denominations mentioned above; the ceremony was held in New York City on July 11, 2004. Many ministers of the LEPC, however, objected that the two LEPC bishops accepted apostolic succession; rather than upset church peace, Bishops Guido and Copp left the LEPC when their terms expired to form a new body: The [[Lutheran Orthodox Church]]. Yet any rift in the Council of Bishops was quickly reconciled. Later that year other bishops of the LEPC, including the then newly elected Presiding Bishop, the Rev. Nancy Drew, were consecrated into apostolic succession by Bishops Guido, Copp, and others, at St. Paul's Lutheran Orthodox Chapel in Pennsylvania.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two church bodies remain on amicable terms. The Lutheran Orthodox Church maintains its complete book of apostolic lineages in its archives, adding a new bishop's name following consecration.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], North America's largest Lutheran body, became united in the historic episcopate of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in 2000, upon the signing of ''[[Called to Common Mission]]''. By this document the full communion between the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Episcopal Church was established.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Three-Expressions/Churchwide-Organization/Ecumenical-and-Inter-Religious-Relations/Full-Communion/The-Episcopal-Church/Called-to-Common-Mission/Liturgical-Changes.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America is headed by a presiding [[bishop]] who is elected by the churchwide assembly for a six year term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elca.org/Who%20We%20Are/Our%20Three%20Expressions/Churchwide%20Organization/Office%20of%20the%20Presiding%20Bishop.aspx Office of the Presiding Bishop - Evangelical Lutheran Church in America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church]] recovered the apostolic succession from [[Old Catholic]] and [[Independent Catholic]] churches, adopted a strict [[episcopal polity]], and all of its clergy have been ordained (or re-ordained) into the historic apostolic succession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christalcc.org/files/Constitution_ALCC_3_.pdf ALCC Constitution, Article V, Section 4, lines 3,4]&lt;/ref&gt;  This Church was formed in 1997, with its headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christalcc.org/ALCC.html Christ Lutheran Church ALCC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another North American Lutheran church which has also has successfully recovered the historic apostolic succession is the [[International Lutheran Fellowship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pastorzip.org&quot;/&gt;

Similarly, in the [[High Church Lutheranism]] of Germany, some religious brotherhoods like [[Hochkirchliche St. Johannes-Bruderschaft]] and [[Hochkirchlicher Apostolat St. Ansgar]] have managed to arrange for their own bishop to be re-ordained in apostolic succession. The members of these brotherhoods do not form into separate ecclesia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

====Indifferent to issue====
Many German Lutherans appear to demur on this issue, which may be sourced in the [[Church Order (Lutheran)|church governance views]] of [[Martin Luther]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, ''An Appeal to the Ruling Class of German Nationality as to the Amelioration of the State of Christendom'' (1520), reprinted in Lewis W. Spitz, editor, ''The Protestant Reformation'' (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall 1966) at 51-59. E.g., &quot;When a bishop consecrates, he simply acts on behalf of the entire congregation, all of whom have the same authority.&quot; ... &quot;[T]he status of priest among Christians is merely that of an office-bearer; while he holds the office he exercises it; if he be deposed he resumes his status in the community and becomes like the rest. ... All these are human inventions and regulations.&quot; ''Ibid.'' at 54, 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther's reform movement, however, usually did not as a rule abrogate the ecclesiastic office of [[Bishop]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookofconcord.org/defense_13_ecclesiasticalorder.php Defense of the Augsburg confession, Article XVI, lines 24]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Roland H. Bainton, ''The Reformation of the Sixteenth Century'' (Boston: The Beadon Press 1952) at 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important historical context to explicate the wide differences among German Lutheran Churches is the [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Prussian Union]] of 1817, whereby the secular government directed the Lutheran Churches in Prussia to merge with non-Lutheran [[Reformed Church]]es in Prussia. The Reformed Churches generally oppose on principle the traditional doctrine of ecclesiastic Apostolic Succession, e.g., not usually even recognizing the church office of Bishop.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [[Jean Calvin]], ''Ecclesiastical ordinances'' (Genève 1541, 1561), reprinted in Lewis W. Spitz, editor, ''The Protestant Reformation'' (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall 1966) at 122-129, 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 19th century, other Lutheran and Reformed congregations merged to form [[United and uniting churches|united church bodies]] in some of the other 39 states of the [[German Confederation]], e.g., in Anhalt, Baden, Bremen, Hesse and Nassau, Hesse-Kassel and Waldeck, and the Palatinate.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Evangelical State Church of Anhalt]], [[Evangelical State Church of Baden]], [[Evangelical Church of Bremen|Bremian Evangelical Church]] (union of Lutheran and Reformed in 1873), [[Evangelical Church in Hesse and Nassau]], [[Evangelical Church of Hesse-Kassel and Waldeck]], and the [[Evangelical Church of the Palatinate]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1866 the [[States of the German Confederation|German Confederation]] dissolved; in 1871 most of its former member states joined the German Empire led by Prussia. [[Hajo Holborn]], ''A History of Modern Germany 1840-1945'' [volume 3] (New York: Alfred A. Knoft 1969) at 187-188, 194-199 [1866]; at 223-227 [1871].&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the partial nature of this list also serves to show that in Germany there remained many Lutherans who never did unite with the Reformed.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., the current umbrella federation of German protestant churches known as the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|EKD]] has as members 22 Church bodies: 9 regional Lutheran, 11 united Lutheran and Reformed, and 2 Reformed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Lutheran Churches seem indifferent as a matter of understood doctrine regarding this particular issue of ecclesiastical governance. In America, the conservative [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod|Missouri Synod]] places its church authority in the congregation rather than in the bishop, though its founder, C.F.W. Walther, while establishing congregational polity for the Missouri Synod, did consider Polity (a Church's form of government) to be a matter of adiaphora (something indifferent.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reformationchurch.org/Informative%20Pages/The%20Church%20Polity%20of%20CFW%20Walther%20and%20Its%20Context.pdf|title=The Church Polity of CWF Walther and its Context}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Missouri Synod is, however, not in what it calls &quot;Pulpit and Altar Fellowship&quot; (full communion) with Churches which are not governed by [[Congregationalist polity]].  It has its own international communion structure, the [[International Lutheran Council]], the member Churches of which are all of Congregationalist polity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pastorzip.org/uslutheranlinx.html Pastor Zip's US Lutheran Web Links] - the entry for The Lutheran Church Missouri Synod&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilc-online.org/pages/default.asp?NavID=69 International Lutheran Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond indifference, some conservative Lutherans are in principle outright against the traditional doctrine of Apostolic Succession, e.g., [[Confessional Lutheranism]] (see also subsection ''Confessional Lutheranism'' herein below). Other conservative Lutherans, however, may favor [[High Church Lutheranism]] which remains generally favorable to the traditional doctrine of Apostolic Succession (see above).

===Methodist churches===
In the beginnings of the [[Methodist]] movement, adherents were instructed to receive the [[sacraments]] within the [[Anglican Church]]; however, the Methodists soon petitioned to receive the sacraments from the [[Methodist local preacher|local preachers]] who conducted [[worship service]]s and [[Revival meeting|revivals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;William Joseph Whalen - Beginnings of Methodism&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=sw9ILcqw2hsC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=methodism+our+separated+brethren&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Separated Brethren: A Review of Protestant, Anglican, Eastern Orthodox &amp; Other Religions in the United States|quote= the Methodists were directed to receive baptism and Holy Communion from Episcopal priests.

Now this term episcopos, overseer, or bishop, is applied to the ''identical'' persons called ''elders'' in the 17th verse, and to none other.

==Protestant denominations against the traditional doctrine of apostolic succession==
=== Contra: Doctrinal continuity important, the Ecclesia not ===
====Institutional background====
Almost all Protestants deny the doctrine of apostolic succession, believing that it is neither taught in Scripture nor necessary for Christian teaching, life, and practice. Accordingly, Protestants strip the notion of apostolic succession from the definition of &quot;apostolic&quot; or &quot;apostolicity.&quot; For them, to be apostolic is simply to be in submission to the teachings of the original twelve apostles as recorded in Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Martin E. Marty, ''A Short History of Christianity'' (New York: Meridian Books 1959) at 75-77 (traditional doctrine).&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrinal stance reflects the Protestant view of authority, embodied in the doctrine known as [[Sola Scriptura]].

Among the original champions of Protestantism who rejected the doctrine of apostolic succession were [[John Calvin]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf., John Calvin, ''Institutio Christianae Religionis'' 1536, 5th ed. 1559; translated by John Allen as ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'' (London 1813; reprinted Philadelphia: Presbyterian Board of Publications, 6th ed. 1921), 2 volumes.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Luther]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther ''The Bondage of the Will'' (1525)&lt;/ref&gt; They both said that the episcopacy was inadequate to address corruption, doctrinal or otherwise, and that this inadequacy justified the intervention of the church of common people. In part this position was also necessary, as otherwise there would have been no means to elicit or initiate reform of the church.

====A Protestant Reformation-era re-definition of apostolic succession====
Protestants may hold that one important qualification of the Apostles was that they were chosen directly by [[Jesus]] and that they witnessed the resurrected Christ. According to this understanding, the work of these twelve (and the Apostle [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]), together with the prophets of the twelve tribes of Israel, as all described in the Scriptures of the Bible, provide the doctrinal foundation for the whole church during our subsequent history. Such Protestants proclaim that to share with the historic apostles the same faith, to believe their word as found in Scripture, to receive the same Holy Spirit: this can be the only sense in which &quot;apostolic succession&quot; is meaningful. It is in this sense only that men have fellowship with God in the truth (an extension of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] doctrines of ''[[sola fide]]'' and ''[[sola scriptura]]''). The most meaningful ''apostolic succession'' for many Protestants, then, is construed as the &quot;faithful succession&quot; of apostolic teaching.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Many Protestants point to episodes described in the Hebrew Bible when the Jewish leadership became disobedient or strayed from the Divine command; God would then bestow that position upon an individual who was more obedient to his will---regardless of any claims that any other person might have sourced in tradition. An example of this would be when [[King Saul of Israel]] was removed by God due to his disobedience so that [[King David]] could assume the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Yet here David did not self-select himself, but rather was chosen by another recognized leader, by [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] a prophet of God.&lt;/ref&gt; Protestants see apostolic succession in much the same way. In the view of many Protestants apostolic succession is not a matter of tradition, rather it is a matter of God safe-guarding his church by means of bestowing authority on those who best exemplify sound doctrine.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;Yet how God does so, a traditional ecclesia spokesperson may ask, would be the question. The example of the split into northern and southern protestant denominations in the U.S.A. during the Civil War (1861-1865) illustrates the problem. Certainly the traditional apostolic churches must also struggle in similar historic circumstances{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many Protestant ''contras'' state that the teaching of apostolic succession did not arise until 170-200 AD.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;stcwsb&quot; /&gt; --&gt; Others would differ, pointing out that the doctrine is mentioned and expounded upon by [[St. Ignatius of Antioch]], a disciple of John, and [[Clement of Rome]], a disciple of Paul. They became bishops, and were later martyred.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the centuries following the Protestant Reformation, most debates about apostolic succession in the West concerned the [[Catholic Church]]'s claim that apostolic succession, as traditionally defined, was essential for orthodox Christian ecclesiae and valid sacramental ministry. Protestants denied this and asserted that the traditional definition of apostolic succession was not revealed in the Bible, but was formulated later by the post-apostolic church.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

====Doctrines not uniform among the ancient churches====
In the 20th century, there has been more contact between Protestants and Christians from Eastern traditions which also claim apostolic succession. These ancient churches of the various Eastern Orthodox may use the doctrine of apostolic succession in their apologetics against Protestantism. Many Protestants now feel that the claims made by advocates of apostolic succession have been proven false by multiple churches' claims to have apostolic succession, and the traditions and doctrines of these churches are, according to Protestants, at odds with each other. According to some Protestant apologists, apostolic succession is a failed theological hypothesis and continued debates about it are no more meaningful than debates about whether the Earth is flat. The following reasons are cited by some Protestant apologists for the doctrine's failure:

* Different churches that claim apostolic succession insist that they alone are the true Church, and other churches in apostolic succession are false.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see &quot;An Orthodox Response to the Recent Roman Catholic Declaration on the Church,&quot; available online at http://www.uocc.ca/PDF/faithandspirituality/An%20Orthodox%20Response%20to%20the%20Recent%20Roman%20Catholic.pdf. In this article, Metropolitan Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church dismisses the Roman Catholic Church's claim to be the one true church and states, “The Orthodox Church is, according to Apostolic Succession, successor and heir to the old, undivided Church. Which is why everything contained in the Catholic document rightfully applies to the Orthodox Church.”&lt;/ref&gt; Some apostolic churches, such as the Roman Catholic Church, do recognize the apostolic succession of other churches, but may consider their holy orders 'illicit' yet essentially valid. Other apostolic churches, however, appear to deny the validity of churches other than themselves.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

* The doctrines of the various &quot;apostolic&quot; churches are often as different from each other as Protestant doctrines are from Catholic or Orthodox doctrines. For example:
** Oriental Orthodox churches define the union of divine and human natures in Christ differently from the dual-nature doctrine held by the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy, and reject Church councils that the other Churches regard as foundational to their religion.&lt;ref&gt;Oriental Orthodox, available online at http://orthodoxwiki.org/Oriental_Orthodox&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the other hand, most Protestant denominations abide by the ancient councils of the apostolic churches, while there are other Protestant denominations that diverge, e.g., the Jehovah's Witnesses seem to have adopted some teachings of the Egyptian priest [[Arius]] condemned by the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]] in 325.&lt;/ref&gt; The Eastern Orthodox define the relationship of the Holy Spirit to other members of the Trinity differently than Roman Catholics (see [[Filioque]]).
** The Catholic Church has dogmatically proclaimed beliefs such as [[Papal Infallibility]], and the [[Immaculate Conception]] of Mary, which are rejected with varying degrees of vehemence by other apostolic churches.
** The Syriac Orthodox Church rejects the doctrine of [[Transubstantiation]], the dogma that the bread and wine used in the Eucharist are transformed into the literal body and blood of Christ during Mass, and believes that the bread and wine are only symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacobitesyrianchurch.org/faith.htm Jacobite Syrian Christian Church ::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
** Many of the practices of the various churches are mutually contradictory. Eastern and Oriental Orthodox churches perform confirmation, which they call chrismation, on infants immediately after baptism, while the Catholic Church delays the rite until adolescence or adulthood, although in some parts of the world confirmation is administered to infants immediately after baptism by Catholic bishops.
** The Roman Catholic Church insists (although not as a matter of faith) that in general, for the [[Latin Rite]], priests be taken from the unmarried (though married priests are occasionally allowed if they were originally ordained in other apostolic churches and desire to continue their calling to ministry serving as Catholics). Both the Eastern Orthodox and the Eastern Catholic churches (which are another branch of the worldwide Catholic Church) permit married men into the priesthood. Some Oriental Orthodox churches, like the Egyptian Copts, insist that parish priests be married. Universally, monastics, by their vocation, and bishops, by tradition, are chosen from among widowers or the never-married in the traditions of the Eastern Orthodox,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coptic.net/EncyclopediaCoptica/ Encyclopedia Coptica: The Christian Coptic Orthodox Church Of Egypt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and of the Eastern Catholic Church.
** Apostolic churches cannot agree on issues as basic as the contents of the Biblical canon. The Eastern Orthodox churches believe that the [[Septuagint]] is divinely-inspired and authoritative, while the Roman Catholic Church uses Hebrew manuscripts of the Old Testament, and to some extent, the Latin [[Vulgate]], as its canon. The Ethiopian Copts include books in the Biblical canon that no other church recognizes, such as the [[Book of Enoch]].&lt;ref&gt;Ethiopian Old Testament Canon, available online at http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/bible/ethold.stm&lt;/ref&gt;
** The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]] &quot;Copts&quot;, who have been geographically isolated since the early centuries of the Christian era, also show other doctrinal innovations that no other denomination accepts, except perhaps for some recent [[Messianic Jews]]. The Jewish Law is held in high regard by the Ethiopians, the [[Ark of the Covenant]] is revered, and [[Adoptionism]] is regarded as a valid Christology by this denomination. If apostolic succession gave bishops the power to remain in the true faith, then an isolated line of bishops should have produced virtually the same theological consensus as the general Church. This clearly did not happen in the Ethiopian church.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

According to some Protestants, it is evident from these facts that claims regarding the necessity of apostolic succession to preserve Christian orthodoxy are false. Continued debates regarding the doctrine would therefore be meaningless. Catholic apologists may reply that these arguments against apostolic succession overstate the Church's teachings about apostolic succession's effect on Christian unity and downplay the doctrine's sacramental aspects. Nonresponsive, however, some Protestants wonder what meaning such a doctrine might possibly have, if those with legitimate ministry, according to the doctrine, fail to preserve sound Christian teaching.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} On the other hand the doctrine of succession relates not only to the preservation of doctrine but also to the power to administer the sacraments. As such, those in succession are not infallible (or not necessarily so), but are given the position of administering the sacraments. Since Protestants frequently hold to the priesthood of all believers, they reject the need for a special episcopal class to administer the sacraments.

Yet such arguments may not be persuasive to the apostolic churches.&lt;ref&gt;See here below the subsection &quot;Broad uniformity among the ancient churches&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Some favoring the traditional ecclesia see the 'contra' Protestant denominations as vulnerable existentially because of their late origins in the 16th century, a millennium and a half after the ministry of Jesus Christ and his Apostles. Some Protestants dismiss the claims made by Catholics and by Orthodox that their episcopal institutions, in their current forms, date directly back to Christ and are in harmony with the early Christian church. To the contrary, it seems clear that these churches, the Orthodox and the Catholic who share a similar ecclesia, have evolved considerably during the great historical changes of the last two millennia. Several elements of their traditions were instituted by later church leaders, e.g., by Patriarches and by Popes, and sometimes by secular emperors. The dates when the Christian Church became fragmented into different denominations is not truly relevant to an ahistoric discussion of theology. Moreover, apostolic church criticism against ''contra'' Protestants appears to presuppose an approved ecclesiology of the Church that is not plainly stated in the Bible: namely, that the Christian Churches should be identical with authoritarian, episcopal institutions rather than simply indicating the worldwide community of Christians, each church interpreting scripture differently, as many Protestants maintain.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

All Christians who have a genuine relationship with God through and in Christ are part of the &quot;True Church,&quot; according to exemplary statements of evangelical Protestant theology, notwithstanding condemnation of the Catholic Church by some Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;But cf., Mark A. Noll and Carolyn Nystrom, ''Is the Reformation Over? An evangelical assessment of contemporary Roman Catholicism'' (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Claims that one or more denominations might be the &quot;True Church&quot; appear as nothing more than propaganda which has evolved over centuries to support authoritarian claims---based on tradition or based on scripture---of merely human institutions. Such claims can be found among the worldwide community of Christians. Yet all appear to treasure the truth that liberates.&lt;ref&gt;Jesus taught his followers to love one another. {{Bibleref2|John|13:35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that Roman Catholics, Anglicans, and Eastern Orthodox consider both the Oriental Orthodox and the Coptic Orthodox churches to have been anathematized in the early ecumenical councils. Therefore, although maintaining that these churches have valid sacramental power in their succession, they would hold that this is distinct from maintaining fully sound doctrine.

===A traditionalist response to the redefinition===
==== Broad uniformity among the ancient churches ====

An apologist for the traditional ecclesiastic form of apostolic succession would suggest taking a long view to survey the ''coherence'' among the ancient churches. That approach will find a ''general agreement'' over the course of two millennia regarding historic practice and church doctrine, e.g., the [[liturgy]], the [[sacraments]], regarding the [[monasticism|monasteries]], concerning [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]], and in other matters, like [[church governance]] (hence their agreement about the necessity of apostolic succession). Yet such ''coherence'' among the ancient churches is not exact; the broad uniformity exists notwithstanding their well-articulated differences.&lt;ref&gt;As to these differences see, e.g., the subsection here above &quot;Doctrines not uniform among the ancient churches.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, among those Protestant churches claiming traditional apostolic succession (see section above), their doctrines and practices can now generally be seen in light of the [[ecumenical]] movement and in the context of the 21st century, and compared with those of the ancient churches: there remain differences but in many areas, following a long process of discussion and prayer, significant reconciliation has been reached.&lt;ref&gt;The initial but incomplete success of the ecumenical movement has evolved between different partners in dialogue and the general discussion, e.g., the ancient churches, Catholic and Orthodox; each also with various Protestant churches; and between the many Protestant churches. Some Protestant churches, however, [[Ecumenism#Fundamentalists and Evangelicals|reject the ecumenical]] movement as theology: often those who do so also reject ''apostolic'' bishops and traditional apostolic succession. Yet in charitable activity there can be welcome cooperation and mutual assistance across the full range of [[Christian denomination]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Thomas E. FitzGerald, ''The Ecumenical Movement. An introductory history (Westport CT: Praeger 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in the 500 years since the Reformation, the Protestant churches not following ecclesiastic apostolic succession have come to differ markedly in several fundamentals, especially 'contra'{{Clarify|date=May 2011}} churches that derive from the Protestant reformation. Such would include, e.g., the Unitarians whose name reflects their early rejection of the Trinity; [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] {LDS Church} (although not Protestant) claim new scripture on par with the Bible and a restored apostolic order by angelic ordination;&lt;ref&gt;http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/128/20#20&lt;/ref&gt; and the Jehovah's Witnesses who largely reject secular society. Yet many Protestants disavow these three churches as not Protestant for not following [[sola scriptura]], the defining principle of Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;Yet, at least initially, the [[Unitarians]] claimed to follow Scripture, and the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] today state that their beliefs are based solely on their interpretation of Scripture.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the Adventist as well as Dispensationalist doctrines, both based on a new reading of Scripture, are generally considered Protestant.&lt;ref&gt;Compare ''Protestant'' churches arising out of the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the U.S.A. (and often following [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|Restorationism]]), e.g., [[Adventism]] as well as other churches (yet here also would be the LDS Church). Compare also the emergence of [[Dispensationalism]], a novel interpretation of scripture which divides biblical and church history into progressive periods ending in the ''rapture''.&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, while all practice many teachings of Christianity, a minority of such 'contra' churches, either Protestant or merely deriving therefrom, have also become---for good or ill---a source of profound innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., John A. Hardon, ''The Protestant Churches of America'' (Newman Press 1956; new edition by Doubleday Image 1969), [[Adventism]] at 29-41, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] at 330-334, LDS Church at 154-168, [[Unitarians]] at 228-239.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Common ground====
One reason often given for traditional apostolic succession is the need for institutional continuity so that Christian doctrine, not only the written texts (pre-Gutenberg (1397–1468) an important consideration) but also their proper orthodox interpretation, could be better maintained. Many Protestants ''contra'' to traditionalist apostolic succession would not deny the importance of continuity and consistency in the true interpretation of Christian doctrine. At the same time, traditionalists defending apostolic succession would agree that ecclesiastics must remain orthodox in their teaching, or be disciplined or [[excommunication|excommunicated]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Charismatic and British New Church Movement new apostles===
Some Protestant [[Charismatic movement|charismatic]] and [[British New Church Movement]] churches include &quot;apostles&quot; among the offices that should be evident into modern times in a true church, though they never trace an historical line of succession. The founders or senior leaders of a [[British New Church Movement]] group will frequently be referred to as the apostles. [[Church planting]] is a key role of these present-day apostles.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Confessional Lutheranism===
[[Confessional Lutheranism]] rejects Apostolic succession, stating that that there's no evidence the Popes have historic succession to Peter other than their own claim that it is so. Furthermore, they claim that in the Bible there's no evidence showing that the office must be conveyed by laying on of hands and no Biblical command that it must be by a special class of bishops (the laying on of hands is repeatedly used to give a commission to some person in scripture, however; for example, it was done to St. Paul before his missions work; St. Paul also instructed St. Timothy to not be hasty in laying on hands). Confessional Lutherans claim that the churches claiming apostolic succession have not preserved [[Pauline epistles|apostolic doctrine]], therefore their leaders have no meaningful apostolic succession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080630172953/http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=942&amp;cuItem_itemID=22266 WELS Topical Q&amp;A - Apostolic Succession]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anglo-Saxon monarchs''' were the rulers of the various kingdoms which arose in [[Anglo-Saxon England|England]] following the withdrawal of the Romans in the fifth century.  The most prominent kingdoms were Kent, Sussex, Wessex, Mercia and Bernicia, each recognising their own monarch.  After a considerable period of time and fluctuations in power balance, [[Alfred the Great]] of Wessex was recognised by the other kingdoms as the premier English king.

'''Ascorbic acid''' is a naturally occurring [[organic compound]] with [[antioxidant]] properties. It is a white solid but impure samples can appear yellowish.  It dissolves well in water to give mildly acidic solutions. Ascorbic acid is one form (&quot;[[vitamer]]&quot;) of [[vitamin C]]. The name is derived from ''a-'' (meaning &quot;no&quot;) and ''scorbutus'' ([[scurvy]]), the disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C.  Being derived from [[glucose]], many animals are able to produce it, but humans require it as a nutritional supplement.

==History==
The discovery of an essential disease-preventing compound in foods that was distinct from the one that prevented beriberi was made in 1907 by two Norwegian physicians while investigating dietary deficiency diseases using the new animal model of [[guinea pig]]s. Quite unexpectedly, guinea pigs proved to be susceptible to [[scurvy]] when fed a diet similar to that of sailors who developed scurvy, and the food-factor of unknown chemical nature that guinea pigs required, was eventually called [[vitamin C]]. 

From 1928 to 1932, the Hungarian research team led by [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] and that of the [[United States|American]] worker [[Charles Glen King]], identified the anti-scorbutic factor as a particular single pure chemical substance. Szent-Györgyi had isolated the chemical hexuronic acid from animal adrenal glands at the Mayo clinic.  He suspected it to be the anti-scorbutic factor but could not prove it without a biological assay. This was finally done by King's laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, which had been working on the problem for years. In late 1931, King's lab obtained adrenal hexuronic acid indirectly from Szent-Györgyi and proved that it was vitamin C by early 1932. This was the last of the compound from animal sources, but later that year, Szent-Györgyi's group discovered that paprika peppers, a common spice in the Hungarian diet, was a rich source of hexuronic acid, and he sent some of the now more available chemical to [[Walter Norman Haworth]], a British sugar chemist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/WG/Views/Exhibit/narrative/szeged.html Story of Vitamin C's chemical discovery. Accessed Jan 21, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1933, working with the then Assistant Director of Research (later Sir) [[Edmund Hirst]] and their research teams, Haworth deduced the correct structure and optical-isomeric nature of vitamin C, and reported the first synthesis of the vitamin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; In honor of the compound's anti-scorbutic properties, Haworth and Szent-Györgyi now proposed the new name of &quot;a-scorbic acid&quot; for the molecule, with [[L-ascorbic acid]] as its formal chemical name.

In 1937 the [[Nobel Prize]] for chemistry was awarded to [[Norman Haworth]] for his work in determining the structure of ascorbic acid (shared with [[Paul Karrer]], who received his award for work on [[vitamin]]s), and the prize for Physiology or Medicine that year went to [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] for his studies of the biological functions of L-ascorbic acid. At the time of its discovery in the 1920s, it was called '''hexuronic acid''' by some researchers, but named L-ascorbic acid by Haworth and Szent-Györgyi when its structure was finally proven by synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1 = Joseph Louis | last1 = Svirbelf | first2 = Albert | last2 = Szent-Györgyi | authorlink2 = Albert Szent-Györgyi | url = http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/WG/B/B/G/W/_/wgbbgw.pdf | title = The Chemical Nature Of Vitamin C | date = April 25, 1932}}.

==Reactions==
Ascorbic acid resembles the sugar from which it is derived, being a ring containing many oxygen [[functional group]]s.  The molecule exists in equilibrium with two [[ketone]] [[tautomer]]s, which are less stable than the [[enol]] form. These forms rapidly interconvert in solutions of ascorbic acid.

[[Image:Ascorbic diketone.png|frame|left|[[Nucleophile|Nucleophilic attack]] of ascorbic enol on proton to give 1,3-diketone]]

==Antioxidant mechanism==
Most importantly, ascorbic acid is a mild [[reducing agent]].  For this reason, it degrades upon exposure to oxygen, especially in the presence of metal ions and light.  It can be oxidized by one electron to a radical state or doubly oxidized to the stable form called [[dehydroascorbic acid]].

Ascorbate usually acts as an antioxidant. Typically it reacts with oxidants such [[reactive oxygen species]], such as the [[hydroxyl radical]] formed from [[hydrogen peroxide]].  Such radicals are damaging to animals and plants at the molecular level due to their possible interaction with [[nucleic acids]], proteins, and lipids. Sometimes these radicals initiate chain reactions. Ascorbate can terminate these chain radical reactions by [[electron transfer]].  Ascorbic acid is special because it can transfer a single electron, owing to the stability of its own 
[[radical ion]] called &quot;semidehydroascorbate&quot;. [[dehydroascorbate]]. The net reaction is:

:RO• + {{chem|C|6|H|7|O|6|-}} → ROH + {{chem|C|6|H|6|O|6|-•}}. 
The oxidized forms of ascorbate are relatively unreactive, and do not cause cellular damage.

However, being a good electron donor, excess ascorbate in the presence of free metal ions can not only promote, but also initiate free radical reactions, thus making it a potentially dangerous pro-oxidative compound in certain metabolic contexts.

===Acidity===
Ascorbic acid, a [[reductone]], behaves as a [[vinylogous]] [[carboxylic acid]] where the electrons in the double bond, hydroxyl group lone pair, and the carbonyl double bond form a [[conjugated system]].  Because the two major [[resonance structure]]s stabilize the deprotonated [[conjugate base]] of ascorbic acid, the hydroxyl group in ascorbic acid is much more acidic than typical hydroxyl groups. In other words, ascorbic acid can be considered an [[enol]] where the deprotonated form is a stabilized [[enolate]]. [[File:AscorbicAcid acidity aaw 20100318.png|thumb|left|400px|Electron pushing for major contributing structures in conjugate base of ascorbic acid]]&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot;&gt;

==Food chemistry==
Ascorbic acid and its sodium, potassium, and calcium [[salts]] are commonly used as [[antioxidant]] [[food additive]]s. These compounds are water-soluble and thus cannot protect [[fat]]s from oxidation: For this purpose, the fat-[[soluble]] [[ester]]s of ascorbic acid with long-chain [[fatty acid]]s (ascorbyl palmitate or ascorbyl stearate) can be used as food antioxidants. Eighty percent of the world's supply of ascorbic acid is produced in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | newspaper = Washington Post | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/19/AR2007051901273.html | title = Tainted Chinese Imports Common | date = May 20, 2007 | first=Rick | last=Weiss | accessdate=2010-04-25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In plastic manufacturing, ascorbic acid can be used to assemble molecular chains more quickly and with less waste than traditional synthesis methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Vitamin C, water have benefits for plastic manufacturing | url = http://reliableplant.com/article.asp?pagetitle=Vitamin%20C,%20water%20have%20benefits%20for%20plastic%20manufacturing&amp;articleid=3133 | publisher = Reliable Plant Magazine | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-06-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927230356/http://www.reliableplant.com/article.asp?pagetitle=Vitamin+C,+water+have+benefits+for+plastic+manufacturing&amp;articleid=3133 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It creates volatile compounds when mixed with [[glucose]] and [[amino acids]].&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1981.tb15349.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a cofactor in [[tyrosine]] [[oxidation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jbc.org/content/196/2/761.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Niche, non-food uses==
Ascorbic acid is easily oxidized and so is used as a reductant in photographic developer solutions (among others) and as a [[preservative]]. 

In [[fluorescence microscope|fluorescence microscopy]] and related fluorescence-based techniques, ascorbic acid can be used as an [[antioxidant]] to increase fluorescent signal and chemically retard dye [[photobleaching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jerker Widengren, Andriy Chmyrov, Christian Eggeling, Per-Åke Löfdahl, and Claus A.

Reptiles and older orders of birds make ascorbic acid in their kidneys.  Recent orders of birds and most mammals make ascorbic acid in their liver where the enzyme [[L-gulonolactone oxidase]] is required to convert glucose to ascorbic acid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot;/&gt; Humans, some other primates, and guinea pigs are not able to make L-gulonolactone oxidase because of a genetic mutation and are therefore unable to make ascorbic acid.   Synthesis and signalling properties are still under investigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;valpuesta&quot;&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.bmbq.uma.es/lbbv/index_archivos/pdf/Valpuesta%202004.pdf | title = Biosynthesis of L-ascorbic acid in plants: new pathways for an old antioxidant | first = Victoriano | last = Valpuesta| first2=Miguel| last2=Botella|journal=TRENDS in Plant Science |volume=9 |month=December | year = 2004| issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial preparation==
Ascorbic acid is synthesized from [[glucose]] through a five-step process. Firstly, glucose, a pentahydroxy [[aldose]], is reduced to [[sorbitol]], which is then [[oxidized]] by the [[microorganism]] [[Acetobacter suboxydans]]. To selectively oxidize only one of the six hydroxy groups in sorbitol, an enzymatic reaction is involved. Treatment with [[acetone]] and an acid [[catalyst]] then protects four of the remaining [[hydroxyl]] groups in [[acetal]] linkages. The unprotected hydroxyl group is chemically oxidized to the carboxylic acid by reaction with [[sodium hypochlorite]] (bleaching solution). Hydrolysis with acid then removes the two acetal groups. The removal then causes an internal ester-forming reaction to yield ascorbic acid. Each of the five steps has a yield larger than 90%.

===Determination===
The traditional way to analyze the ascorbic acid content is [[titration]] with an [[oxidizing agent]]. 

;Iodine (Iodimetry)
Using [[iodine]] and a [[starch indicator]].odine reacts with ascorbic acid, and, when all the ascorbic acid has reacted, the iodine is then in excess, forming a blue-black complex with the starch indicator.  This indicates the end-point of the titration. As an alternative, ascorbic acid can be treated with iodine in excess, followed by back titration with sodium thiosulfate using starch as an indicator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-saps.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/docs/vitc.pdf A website with an excerpt to using iodine]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Iodate and iodine
The above \ involving iodine requires standardising the iodine solution. Iodine can be generate in the presence of the ascorbic acid by the reaction of [[iodate]] and [[iodide]] in [[acid]] solution, the ionic equation for this reaction follows;

;N-Bromosuccinimide
A much-less-common oxidising agent is [[N-Bromosuccinimide|''N''-bromosuccinimide]], (NBS). In this titration, the NBS oxidises the ascorbic acid in the presence of [[potassium iodide]] and starch. When the NBS is in excess (i.e., the reaction is complete), the NBS liberates the iodine from the potassium iodide, which then forms the blue/black complex with starch, indicating the end-point of the titration.

; Iodimetric determination involving electrochemical method
Electrolyzing the solution of potassium iodide produces iodine, which reacts with ascorbic acid. The end of process is determined by [[potentiometric titration]] in a manner similar to [[Karl Fischer titration]]. The amount of ascorbic acid can be calculated by the Faraday's law.

'''Amsterdamsche Football Club Ajax''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈaːjɐks}}; {{euronext|AJAX}}), also referred to as '''AFC Ajax''', '''Ajax Amsterdam''' or simply '''Ajax''' (after the [[Ajax (mythology)|legendary Greek hero]]), is a professional [[Association football|football]] [[football team|club]] from [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. The club is historically one of the three clubs that dominate the Dutch national football league ([[Eredivisie]]), the others being [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and [[Feyenoord]].

Ajax is historically one of the most successful clubs in the world; according to the [[International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics|IFFHS]], Ajax were the seventh most successful European club of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Europe's Club of the Century | publisher = International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics

In 1972, they completed the [[Treble (association football)#Continental trebles|European treble]] by winning the Dutch [[Eredivisie]], [[KNVB Cup]], and the European Cup; to date, they are the only team to keep the European Cup and accomplish the European treble. Ajax's last international trophies were the [[1995 Intercontinental Cup]] and the [[1994–95 UEFA Champions League|1995 Champions League]], where they defeated [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] in the [[1995 UEFA Champions League Final|final]]; they lost the [[1995–96 UEFA Champions League|1996 Champions League]] final on penalties to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]].

They are also one of three teams to win the treble and the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] in the same season/calendar year;&lt;ref&gt;with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 1999 and [[FC Barcelona]] in 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This was achieved in the 1971–72 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;UEFA sanctioned the UEFA Supercup for the first time in 1973. In 1972 was an unofficial edition and the I Centenary of [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] (see [http://www.uefa.com/competitions/supercup/history/index.html History of the UEFA Supercup] in uefa.com).&lt;/ref&gt; Ajax, [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] are the three clubs to have won all three major UEFA club competitions.&lt;ref&gt;([[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] and [[UEFA Cup]])&lt;/ref&gt; They have also won the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] twice, the [[1991–92 UEFA Cup]], as well as the [[1961–62 Intertoto Cup|Karl Rappan Cup]], a predecessor of the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] in 1962.&lt;ref name=Intertoto&gt;UEFA sanctioned the UEFA Intertoto Cup for the first time in 1995.

Ajax plays at the [[Amsterdam Arena]], which opened in 1996. They previously played at [[De Meer Stadion]] and the [[Olympic Stadium (Amsterdam)|Amsterdam Olympic Stadium]] (for international matches).

==History==
===Amateur Era===
The club was founded in Amsterdam on March 18, 1900 by [[Floris Stempel]], [[Carel Reeser]] and [[Johan Dade]].

It was the second incarnation, after a short-lived previous attempt (as the Football Club Ajax) in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajax.nl/De-Club/Historie/History-Tour/18931900-De-prehistorie.htm &quot;Ajax – 1893–1900: De pre-historie&quot;]. AFC Ajax. Retrieved on 2009-06-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The club were named after the mythological hero [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]], a Greek who fought in the [[Trojan War]] against [[Troy]]. In [[The Iliad]], Ajax was said to be the greatest of all the Greeks next to his cousin [[Achilles]], and even fought an inconclusive duel with Troy's champion [[Hector]]. According to most accounts, Ajax died by committing suicide. Thus, unlike Achilles, he died unconquered.

Ajax succeeded in promotion to the highest level of Dutch football in 1911, under the guidance of [[Jack Kirwan]], their first official coach. The promotion meant that Ajax were forced to alter the club's strip, as [[Sparta Rotterdam|Sparta]] of [[Rotterdam]] had the same kit, red-white vertical stripes with black shorts. Ajax adopted a broad vertical red stripe on a white background with white shorts, the club's kit to this day.

Although their efforts were not unnoticed (Gé Fortgens became a frequent member of the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] for a while) they were relegated in 1914. While they immediately bounced back, they had to wait until 1917 to regain higher level status again: they did become league champions in both 1915 and 1916, however the 1915 league was declared unofficial (due to World War I), whereas in 1916 they did not make it through the promotion round.

Under the guidance of [[Jack Reynolds (1881-1962)|Jack Reynolds]] (Kirwan's successor as of 1915) the club was promoted to the highest level in 1917 and won the Dutch national cup final, defeating VSV 5–0. Ajax went on to win their first national championship in 1918. The championship was secured in [[Tilburg]] where they faced [[Willem II Tilburg|Willem II]] without Jan de Natris, arguably the club's first 'star player', who missed the train to Tilburg and opted to stay in Amsterdam instead – earning him a fine of 10 cents. In the following season he earned a six month ban, but Ajax did well in his absence: not only did they retain the championship title, their 1919 campaign was also an unbeaten run for them – an accomplishment that was only repeated 76 years later by Ajax themselves.

Now a regular contender for the Western Regional championship in the Netherlands, Ajax marched through the twenties with regional titles in 1921, 1927 and 1928, next to a few minor cups. The 1930s would prove to be more successful however; with household names as [[Wim Anderiesen|Wim Anderiesen Sr.]], Dolf van Kol, Piet Strijbosch, Wim Volkers, Jan van Diepenbeek, Bob ten Have, Erwin van Wijngaarden and prolific striker Piet van Reenen, Ajax' period from the late twenties until [[World War II]] was so successful that many people dubbed it 'the [[Dutch golden age|golden age]]' (a reference to the 17th century, the heyday of the [[Dutch Republic]]).

With eight regional titles (1930–32, 1934–37, and 1939) and 5 national championships (1931, 1932, 1934, 1937, 1939) Ajax was the most successful team of that era in the country. The thirties were also notable for the final culmination of the rivalry with [[Feyenoord]], another squad that earned many awards in that time, as well as the creation of the stadium 'het Ajax-Stadion' dubbed [[De Meer Stadion|'De Meer']] (named after the borough of its residence). Until the emergence of the [[Amsterdam ArenA]] in 1996, this was Ajax' home ground together with the [[Olympisch Stadion (Amsterdam)|Olympic Stadium]] for the bigger games.

As of the 1940s, perhaps in line with Jack Reynolds' retirement (he had stayed – save for a few spells of absence – on for the entire time as Ajax' manager since his entry in 1915), Ajax went through a period of rebuilding. Gerrit Fischer and Erwin van Wijngaarden were retained, with Joop Stoffelen, Guus Dräger, [[Gé van Dijk]], Jan Potharst and later [[Rinus Michels]] and [[Cor van der Hart]] brought in. After a Cup Final victory in 1943, Ajax went on to finish second in the championship league in 1946 (behind [[HFC Haarlem]]) followed by a league championship win in 1947.

They became regional champions in 1950 again, though they never came near winning the championship. The season was notable for a match against [[SC Heerenveen]], with Heerenveen coming back from 5–1 down to win 6–5. In 1941, Ajax performed the opposite: after being 6–0 behind to VUC in [[The Hague]] they managed to pull out a draw in the end (6–6).

Until 1954, the year that professional football was introduced in the Netherlands, Ajax had some minor successes, with the regional title in 1952 and a second place in the regional championship in 1954 (equal in points with fellow Amsterdam club [[Door Wilskracht Sterk]]).

===Professional football and the road to the top===
In 1955, professional football was finally permitted in the Netherlands. Ajax was still far from the international top, as was demonstrated in the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] match against [[Vasas SC]], where they were beaten by the Hungarians 4–0 in the [[Stadium Puskás Ferenc|Népstadion]]). Similar European failures followed in 1960, with Ajax being knocked out by the Norwegian amateurs of [[Fredrikstad FK]] and in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1961 by [[Újpest FC]] of [[Ferenc Bene]].

Ajax achieved some success on the domestic level, earning the first [[Eredivisie]]-championship in 1957 and again in 1960 – the 1960 title decided by a playoff after equalling in points with arch-rivals Feyenoord. Ajax cruised to a 5–1 victory with a hat trick by striker Wim Bleijenberg.

Bleijenberg was not the top scorer however. Henk Groot – the younger brother of Cees Groot who scored 100 goals for Ajax in his 5 year stay – arrived in 1959 from Stormvogels and scored 38 goals in 1959/60 and 41 goals in 1960/61. He was a vital part of Ajax in the early sixties, replacing star striker Piet van der Kuil who left for [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] in 1960. Alongside the man who would later become ''Mister Ajax'', [[Sjaak Swart]], Co Prins, Ton Pronk, Bennie Muller and a young [[Piet Keizer]], Ajax added the National Cup in 1961 and the Intertoto Cup 1962 to their trophy cabinet.

[[File:Johan Cruijff 1982.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johan Cruijff]] played at Ajax between 1959–73 and 1981–83, winning 3 European Cups; his #14 is the only squad number Ajax has ever retired. Cruyff came back to manage the club from 1985–88. Since 2011, he is back at the club in an advisory position.]]
After missing out on the championship after a 5–2 defeat against PSV in 1963, Ajax entered a period of decline in the national league. Henk Groot left to Feyenoord that summer, and in 1964/65 they were near relegation. Things improved after former player [[Rinus Michels]] replaced [[Vic Buckingham]] as the head manager. Ajax managed to secure a midtable spot under Michels; however Buckingham's second tenure saw the introduction of [[Johan Cruijff]] during a 3–1 loss at GVAV.

Michels started a revolution in Amsterdam, beginning with the return of Henk Groot and Co Prins, as well as the signing of goalkeeper Gert Bals. Michels built a side around the vision of ''[[Total Football]]'', sacrificing players who he considered not to be good enough or fit the style of play. The most notable example of this was defender Frits Soetekouw – replaced by Ajax' new captain [[Velibor Vasović]] – whose [[own goal]] aided the victory of [[Dukla Prague]] in the quarter-final of the European Cup in 1966/67, after Ajax had knocked out [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]] and defeated [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] 5–1.

Ajax sealed their second consecutive championship in 1967. They were not as dominant as the previous year, but with a seemingly unstoppable attack they scored no less than 122 goals (still a national record), of which 33 were from Johan Cruijff, at 20 years old already the star player. It was also the season for another important milestone: for the first time in history, Ajax won the double (after defeating [[NAC Breda|NAC]] in the cup final).

It earned them European Cup qualification, being knocked out by [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in the subsequent season, with [[Veloso]] scoring the winner for ''Los Merengues'' in extra time after two 1–1 draws, results which greatly enhanced the reputation of the club.

Ajax won the Dutch title of 1968 overtaking Feyenoord, the league leaders for much of the season, and reached the European Cup final of 1969 in [[Madrid]] against [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]]. In qualifying for the European Cup final Ajax defeated [[1. FC Nuremberg|FC Nuremberg]] in the first round. They were almost knocked out by [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the second, losing 3–1 to them in Amsterdam but winning the second leg in Lisbon 3–1. The decisive third match in neutral Paris was won 3–0 through goals by Inge Danielsson (2) and Johan Cruijff. They repeated this score at home against the next opponent, [[FC Spartak Trnava|Spartak Trnava]] in the next round, but struggled in the second leg qualifying narrowly on aggregate. In the final, Milan – lauded for their excellent defense and counter-attacks – easily won 4–1 with [[Pierino Prati]] opening the scoring after seven minutes and going on to score a hattrick, while [[Velibor Vasović]] was the only Ajax player on the scoresheet with a penalty. Milan's win was capped by a goal by [[Angelo Sormani]].

===''Gloria Ajax'' – European dominance and treble===
Following their loss in the European Cup final, Ajax entered another period of rebuilding. Among the new additions were national top scorer Dick van Dijk and midfielders Gerrie Mühren and Nico Rijnders, while a second team player, [[Ruud Krol]], was promoted to the first 11. They replaced Klaas Nuninga, Inge Danielsson, Theo van Duijvenbode (all sold to other clubs) and Henk Groot, who retired from football after an injury while playing against [[Poland national football team|Poland]]. Ton Pronk and Bennie Muller were no longer as frequently in the first 11 after many years of service.

In 1969–70 Ajax won the Dutch league championship, winning 27 out of 34 games and scoring 100 goals. Feyenoord remained in contention throughout the season, but they had to settle for second place. Both clubs won a trophy however, with Ajax winning the Eredivisie title while Feyenoord captured the [[European Cup 1969-70|European Cup]]. Ajax reached the semi-finals of the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] in 1970 (being knocked out by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] after defeating [[Hannover 96]], [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]], [[Ruch Chorzów]], and [[FC Carl Zeiss Jena|Carl Zeiss Jena]])

1971 became the long awaited year of glory, with Ajax winning trophies at both domestic and European level. For a substantial part of the season Ajax seemed to be on their way to the European treble (a feat only previously performed by [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in 1967). Domestically, Ajax finished second to Feyenoord in the league, winning the KNVB Cup after a replayed final against Sparta. In Europe, Ajax defeated [[KF Tirana|17 Nëntori]], [[FC Basel]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Atlético Madrid]] en route to the 1971 European Cup final played at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] on June 2. There, 83,000 spectators witnessed a 2–0 victory over [[Panathinaikos FC|Panathinaikos]], with goals from Dick van Dijk and an Arie Haan shot deflected by defender Kapsis. Captain Vasović could finally lift the European Cup, having lost two previous finals in 1966 with [[FK Partizan]] and again in 1969.

In the following years Ajax established itself as the foremost club in European football. Stefan Kovacs replaced coach Michels in 1971, while Rijnders and Vasović' departed in the same year. Van Dijk's departed in 1972. Such changes in the side and management did not disrupt the success of the club, with Ajax completing the treble of European Cup, Dutch National Championship and the KNVB Cup in 1972 to which was added the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]]. In 1973, Ajax won a third consecutive European Cup and another Dutch championship; however, failure in the KNVB Cup meant Ajax missed out on a second consecutive treble.

The departure of [[Johan Cruijff]] for [[FC Barcelona]] in 1973 signalled the end of the period of success, effectively ending the reign of the so called '12 Apostles' (The usual line-up [[Heinz Stuy]], [[Wim Suurbier]], [[Barry Hulshoff]], [[Horst Blankenburg]], [[Ruud Krol]], [[Arie Haan]], [[Johan Neeskens]], [[Gerrie Mühren]], [[Sjaak Swart]], Johan Cruijff, [[Piet Keizer]] plus the usual twelfth man who was Ruud Suurendonk until 1972 and then [[Johnny Rep]]). Whereas clubs like [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]] were beaten by Ajax between 1971 and 1973, failure in the European Cup at the hands of [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]] in late 1973 signalled the decline of Ajax in European football.

Nevertheless, the ''[[Total Football]]'' that they had propagated became a lasting memory for many football fans, contributing to the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] reaching the final of the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] using similar tactics. The decline of Ajax and the loss to the Germans in the World Cup final saw the end of the Total Football era; later Ajax manager [[Tomislav Ivić]] would dub the era 'Gloria Ajax', illustrating the impact of their years at the top.

===The 1st Renaissance and 1980s===
After a period of decline, in 1977, Ivić coached Ajax to their first domestic championship since 1973. Ajax returned to domestic success winning 5 league championships after '77 as well as 4 cups, though impressive European performances were sparse. Ajax were knocked out by Juventus in the quarter-finals of the European Cup in 1978 and reached a European Cup semi-final in 1980, losing to eventual winners, the [[Brian Clough]]-managed [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. Disappointing European form between 1980 and 1986 saw the club not getting past the second round for six years in a row. Johan Cruijff returned to the club in 1981, with the club producing some talented youngsters in the mid-1980s such as [[Wim Kieft]], [[John van 't Schip]], [[Marco van Basten]], [[Gerald Vanenburg]], [[Jesper Olsen]], and [[Frank Rijkaard]].

After leaving the club in 1983 after a conflict with president Harmsen, Cruijff returned once again in 1985 as the new manager.
Cruijff's attacking tactics were immediately illustrated in his first active season, where Ajax ended the season with 120 goals in total, of which 37 were from Ajax's new star player [[Marco van Basten]]. Despite this, Ajax finished as runners up in the league to [[PSV Eindhoven]] twice in a row in '85/'86 and '86/'87. Despite the lack of domestic league success, Cruijff's Ajax won the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1986-87|'87 Cup Winners Cup]], beating [[Lokomotive Leipzig]]. They reached the final again in the following season, losing out to [[KV Mechelen]].

Cruijff departed prior to the second [[Cup Winners Cup]] final, as a result of the declining results in the national league. With most of the 80's stars such as van Basten also leaving, Ajax once again declined. They continued to compete for the title with PSV in subsequent years, who became the dominant club in European and Dutch football, matching Ajax's 1972 achievement of [[Treble (association football)#Continental trebles|a continental treble]] in 1988. Negative aspects of the period 1988–1991 were the fraud-case in 1989 and a year long ban from European competition in 1990–91 following an incident whereby a fan threw an iron bar at the [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]] goalkeeper during a UEFA Cup tie in the 1989–1990 season. Under manager [[Leo Beenhakker]], Ajax went on to win the championship race with PSV in 1990. They almost won the league again in 1991, losing narrowly to PSV.

===The Van Gaal era: European success and Decline===
On departure to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in 1991, Beenhakker was replaced by [[Louis van Gaal]], the former assistant-coach. Like Cruyff, van Gaal rapidly made his mark by altering Ajax' tactics. Also like Cruijff, his efforts were rewarded in his first season at the helm by winning the 1992 [[UEFA Cup]] after a thrilling final against [[Torino F.C.|AC Torino]]. Although he did not play the final's second leg, the tournament saw the arrival of [[Dennis Bergkamp]] who contributed six goals during the competition. Despite Bergkamp being the top goalscorer in Dutch football in 1991, 1992, Ajax once again finished as runners up to PSV in the league. In 1992/93 Ajax even had to settle for a third spot, for first time since 1984, but won the KNVB Cup.

In 1993, Bergkamp and [[Wim Jonk]] left to [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]], allowing Finn [[Jari Litmanen]] to establish himself as the new number 10 of Ajax. Aside from Litmanen, Ajax attracted [[Finidi George]] and the return of [[Frank Rijkaard]], providing a base for van Gaal to build on.

The 1994–95 season saw the return of European success after two decades, with Ajax winning the [[UEFA Champions League 1994-95]] and the league title. The season saw an unbeaten run in the national league and the final season for Frank Rijkaard, while striker [[Patrick Kluivert]] had an excellent start to his season, with the then 18-year-old coming off the bench to score a late winner to beat [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]] in the final of the Champions League. Ajax went on to beat Brazilian side [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] on penalties to win the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]]. The following season, Ajax continued to succeed on the European front, succumbing only to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] on penalties in the European Cup final.

However, the subsequent period saw the departure of manager van Gaal along with an exodus of many key players, several on free transfers following the [[Bosman ruling]]. [[Clarence Seedorf]] departed in 1995; [[Edgar Davids]], [[Michael Reiziger]], [[Finidi George]], and [[Nwankwo Kanu]] in 1996; [[Patrick Kluivert]], [[Marc Overmars]], and [[Winston Bogarde]] in 1997; [[Ronald de Boer]] and [[Frank de Boer]] in 1998; and [[Edwin van der Sar]] and [[Jari Litmanen]] in 1999, together with the retirement of [[Frank Rijkaard]] in 1995 and [[Danny Blind]] in 1999. Van Gaal's replacement, [[Morten Olsen]], attracted Danish national team captain [[Michael Laudrup]] to the club. Ajax won the league championship and the Dutch cup. Despite this success, Olsen could not replace the key players who had departed or maintain the success under van Gaal. In Olsen's second year at the club, tension arose between Olsen and the Dutch players Ronald de Boer and Frank de Boer, and Olsen was sacked in 1998. In 1999, Ajax finished 6th in the league, their lowest position in over 20 years.

===Recent events===
{{Cleanup|section|date=November 2009}}
In the [[Eredivisie 2002–03|2002–03 season]], manager [[Ronald Koeman]] led Ajax to the Champions League quarter finals against [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]], losing only to a last minute winner in the second-leg encounter at the [[San Siro]].

[[File:Amsterdam Arena Feb 18 2010.ogv|thumb|250px|The Amsterdam ArenA in a match against Juventus.]]

Koeman's early success was short-lived. In 2005, he resigned after Ajax's defeat to [[AJ Auxerre]] in the [[UEFA Cup]] tournament during a period of arguments with football director [[Louis van Gaal]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} [[Danny Blind]] was Koeman's replacement. Blind instantly caused consternation by announcing that the club was to play using a [[Formation (association football)|4–4–2]] formation, abandoning the [[Total Football]]-oriented [[4-3-3]] that has become Ajax' trademark.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} This season also saw the departure of key players [[Rafael van der Vaart]] and [[Nigel de Jong]] to [[Hamburger SV]] and Zlatan Ibrahimović to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], while six others ([[Hatem Trabelsi]], [[Tomáš Galásek]], [[Hans Vonk (footballer)|Hans Vonk]], [[Nourdin Boukhari]], [[Steven Pienaar]], and [[Maxwell Cabelino Andrade|Maxwell]]) revealed they would leave the club at the end of the [[Eredivisie 2005–06|2005–06 season]]. Blind was sacked on 10 May 2006 after 422 days in charge. New coach [[Henk ten Cate]], who won the Champions League and [[La Liga]] in 2006 as the assistant of [[Frank Rijkaard]] with [[FC Barcelona]], gave youngsters a shot to enter the selection of the first team. Ten Cate said youngsters [[Jan Vertonghen]] and [[Robbert Schilder]] would be included in the selection, whereas Greek forward [[Angelos Charisteas]] was sold to [[Feyenoord]].

Ajax missed out on a Champions League place in [[UEFA Champions League 2006–07|2006–07]] after their defeat against Danish side [[F.C. Copenhagen|FC Copenhagen]] (3–2 on aggregate). As a result, Ajax played against [[IK Start]] from [[Norway]] in the first round of the [[UEFA Cup 2006–07|UEFA Cup]] on 14 and 18 of September, and won the match 9–2 on aggregate (2–5 away and 4–0 home). Having then progressed through the group stages, they drew German club [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] in the round of 32. In the first leg in Germany, Ajax lost 3–0. On the return leg in Amsterdam, they rallied for two second half goals to win 3–1, but lost 4–3 on aggregate.

[[File:AFC Ajax 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Ajax players in 2010.]]

In the [[Eredivisie 2006–07|2006–07 season]] Ajax also achieved some successes with ten Cate in charge. They won the [[Johan Cruijff Shield]] after a 3–1 win over rivals PSV and they also defeated [[AZ (football club)|AZ]] 8–9 on penalties in the [[KNVB Cup 2006–07|Dutch Cup final]] after a 1–1 draw after extra time. Ajax was very close to clinch the Eredivisie title after deducting a 10 point deficit from PSV, but lost it on goal difference on the last matchday to PSV (PSV: 75–25, Ajax 84–35).

In the following [[Eredivisie 2007–08|2007–08 season]], Ajax sold two of the biggest talents: [[Ryan Babel]] for €17 million to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Wesley Sneijder]] for €27 million to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. [[Luis Suárez (Uruguayan footballer)|Luis Suárez]], seen as a replacement for Babel, was signed from [[FC Groningen]]. Ajax decided not to buy a replacement for Sneijder because of the difficulty in finding a similar-position type of player to replace him and also because the deal was finished close to the [[transfer window|transfer deadline]] and Ajax would not rush through any signings.

The fact that they did not find any replacement for Sneijder, backed with [[Edgar Davids]]'s broken leg, disrupted the preparation for the qualification games for a [[UEFA Champions League 2007–08|Champions League]] place. Opponent [[Slavia Prague]] won both matches; with a 2–1 scoreline in [[Prague]] and 0–1 victory in Amsterdam. The failure to clinch a position in the Champions League group stage led to great criticism from both the supporters and the media, mainly directed at Henk ten Cate and the board of directors. A 1–0 victory over [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] for the Johan Cruijff Shield could not make up for the loss of a Champions League spot. Despite quite a good start in the competition with a lot of goals from both Luis Suárez and [[Klaas-Jan Huntelaar]], Ajax lost ground again in Europe after not making it to the group phase of the [[UEFA Cup]]; managing a 0–1 win away against [[NK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] but lost the tie in Amsterdam after extra time with the score 2–3 to Dinamo. With these string of European failures, coach Ten Cate wasn't able to carry the team through to the Champions League group stage for two seasons in a row and no European football at the ArenA for the remainder of the 2007–08 season. With these disappointing results, ten Cate lost the confidence of the supporters who demanded that the board sack him. A more viable solution came when Chelsea (in the same week) offered ten Cate the job of assistant manager with a 3-year deal. On 9 October, ten Cate left Ajax. [[Adrie Koster]] was selected to helm the squad. On 29 October 2007, captain [[Jaap Stam]] announced his immediate retirement from professional football because of a lack of motivation to continue. Ajax finished the season second and, following the [[Eredivisie 2007–08#Play-offs|Play-offs]], qualified for the [[UEFA Cup 2008–09]].

[[File:Ajax Kiev.ogv|thumb|250px|Amsterdam ArenA prior to a Champions League qualification match between Ajax and Dynamo Kiev.]]
Following [[UEFA Euro 2008]], former Ajax striker [[Marco van Basten]] was appointed as the new manager, succeeding Koster. [[Johan Cruyff]] was poised to take up a new position with the club to overhaul the youth program but after a dispute with van Basten, he reneged on this commitment. Following van Basten's appointement, a host of new players were brought into the squad, including [[Ismaïl Aissati]] and [[Miralem Sulejmani]], whose €16.25 million transfer from [[SC Heerenveen]] broke the Dutch transfer record. Van Basten chose Klaas-Jan Huntelaar as the new club captain following his appointment, but in the January 2009 transfer window Huntelaar transferred to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] (for €27 million), a decision for which Ajax were hugely criticised in the Dutch papers. ''[[de Volkskrant|The Volkskrant]]'', for instance, referred to Ajax as a mere &quot;trading company&quot; which reduces its chances for a title by selling its main striker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Ajax finished third in [[Eredivisie 2008–09|2008–09 season]], qualifying for the inaugural [[UEFA Europa League 2009–10|UEFA Europa League]]. [[Marco van Basten]] resigned after the penultimate game of the season, citing the season's results and his inability to perform better next season as main reasons. For the last game against Twente, the team was under the hands of assistant coach [[John van 't Schip]]. Later the same month [[Martin Jol]] was signed as the new coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The [[Eredivisie 2009–10|2009–10 season]] for Ajax started with two wins, but after an away defeat against rivals [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and a draw against Sparta Rotterdam, they were again trailing the league leaders in the early stages of the competition. From game 7 until game 27, Ajax held the third place in the league, with [[FC Twente|Twente]] and PSV above them, which held the top position respectively 10 and 11 games. Starting with game 21, Ajax won every single match until the end of the season. Twente however, unlike PSV, would not succumb to the pressure and eventually succeeded in keeping a one point deficit to win the title. Ajax finished the season with a goal difference of +86 (106–20), which was more than double that of Twente (+40). [[Luis Alberto Suárez|Luis Suarez]] finished the season as top goal scorer with 35 goals, a record for a non-Dutch player in the Eredivisie. Despite the disappointment of missing out on the league title, Ajax would finish the season by winning a record 18th KNVB Cup by defeating Feyenoord in the final. (On their way to this cup triumph, Ajax also re-wrote the Dutch record books with a remarkable 14–1 victory at the ground of amateurs WHC in Round Four.) 

Winning double-leg matches with [[PAOK]] and [[Dinamo Kyiv]] in the Champions League 2010–2011 qualifiers, the club returns to the main European competition after five long seasons.

==Youth program==
{{Main|Jong Ajax}}
The club is also particularly famous for its renowned youth program that has produced many Dutch talents over the years – [[Johan Cruijff]], [[Edwin van der Sar]], [[Dennis Bergkamp]], national team top scorer [[Patrick Kluivert]], and former national team coach [[Marco van Basten]]. Dutch national first-team players [[Ryan Babel]], [[Wesley Sneijder]], [[Rafael van der Vaart]], [[Maarten Stekelenburg]], [[Eljero Elia]], [[André Ooijer]], [[John Heitinga]] and [[Nigel de Jong]] had also came through the ranks at Ajax and all are now playing for top-flight clubs. Ajax also regularly supplies the Dutch national youth teams with local talent. First team regulars [[Siem de Jong]], [[Urby Emanuelson]] and [[Gregory van der Wiel]] are former youth internationals who made the successful step up to the senior side.

Due to mutual agreements with foreign clubs, the youth academy has also signed foreign players as teenagers before making first team debuts, such as Belgian defensive trio [[Jan Vertonghen]], [[Toby Alderweireld]] and [[Thomas Vermaelen]] (now with Arsenal) and winger [[Tom de Mul]] (now with Sevilla), all of whom are full internationals as well as Dutch youth international [[Javier Martina]] and [[Vurnon Anita]] of the [[Netherlands Antilles]].

Ajax has also expanded its talent searching program to South Africa with [[Ajax Cape Town FC|Ajax Cape Town]]. Ajax Cape Town was set up with the help of [[Rob Moore (South African Entrepreneur)|Rob Moore]].   Ajax has also had a satellite club in the United States under the name [[Ajax Orlando Prospects|Ajax America]], until it filed for bankruptcy. There are some youth players from Ajax Cape Town that have been drafted into the Eredivisie squad, such as South African international [[Steven Pienaar]] (now with [[Totenham Hotspurs|Spurs]]) and Cameroonian international [[Eyong Enoh]].

In 1995, the year Ajax won the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] was almost entirely composed of Ajax players, with [[Edwin van der Sar]] in goal; players such as [[Michael Reiziger]], [[Frank de Boer]], and [[Danny Blind]] in defense; [[Ronald de Boer]], [[Edgar Davids]], and [[Clarence Seedorf]] in midfield; and [[Patrick Kluivert]] and [[Marc Overmars]] in attack.

==Klassieker derby==

Every year Ajax play [[Feyenoord]] from [[Rotterdam]] in the &quot;[[Klassieker]]&quot; (&quot;The Classic&quot;), a [[derby match]] between teams from the two largest cities of the Netherlands.

==Logo==
In 1900, when the club was founded, the emblem of Ajax was just a picture of an Ajax player. In 1928, the club logo was introduced with the head of the Greek hero [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]]. The logo was once again changed in 1990 into an abstract version of the previous one. The new logo still sports the portrait of Ajax, but drawn with just 11 lines, symbolizing the 11 players of a football team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~michielh/hetlogo.html History of the Ajax logo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colours==
Ajax originally played in an all black uniform with a red sash tied around the players' waists, but that uniform was soon replaced by a red/white striped shirt and black shorts. Red, black and white are the three colours of the flag of [[Amsterdam]]. However, when, under manager [[Jack Kirwan]], the club got promoted to the top flight of Dutch football for the first time in 1911 (then the ''Eerste Klasse'' or 'First Class', later named the [[Eredivisie]]), Ajax were forced to change their colours because [[Sparta Rotterdam]] already had exactly the same outfit. Special kits for away fixtures did not exist at the time and according to football association regulations the newcomers had to change their colours if two teams in the same league had identical uniforms. Ajax opted for white shorts and white shirt with a broad, vertical red stripe over chest and back, which still is Ajax's outfit.
[[Image:Amsterdam ArenA.JPG|thumb|[[Amsterdam ArenA]]]]
[[Image:Amsterdam Arena Aerial.jpg|thumb|Exterior of Stadium]]

Ajax's shirts have been [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsored]] by [[TDK]], and by [[ABN AMRO]] from 1991 to 2008. [[AEGON]] has replaced ABN AMRO as the new head sponsor for a period of at least seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.ajax.nl/web/show/id=154814/contentid=64367 | title=AEGON new head sponsor AFC Ajax | work=Ajax.nl | accessdate=2007-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 2007, Ajax wore a different sponsor for the match against [[Heracles Almelo]]: ''Florius''. Florius is a banking program just launched by [[ABN AMRO]] who wanted it to be the shirt sponsor for one match. The shirts have been manufactured by [[Umbro]] (1989–2000) and [[Adidas]] since 2000 (until at least 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ajax-usa.com/news/2002-2003/contract-with-kit-sponsor-adidas.html | title=Contract with kit sponsor Adidas extended until summer 2009 | work=AJAX-USA.com | accessdate=2006-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stadium==
{{Main|Amsterdam ArenA}}
Ajax' first stadium was built in 1911 out of wood and was simply called &quot;The Stadium&quot;. Ajax later played in the stadium built for the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Amsterdam Olympics]]. This stadium, designed by [[Jan Wils]], is known as the [[Olympic Stadium (Amsterdam)|Olympic Stadium]]. In 1934, Ajax moved to [[De Meer Stadion]] in east Amsterdam, designed by architect and Ajax-member Daan Roodenburgh. The stadium could accommodate 29,500 spectators and Ajax continued to play there until 1996. For big European and national fixtures the club would often play at the Olympic Stadium, which could accommodate about twice the number of spectators.

In 1996, Ajax moved to a new home ground in the southeast of the city known as the [[Amsterdam ArenA]] This was built by the Amsterdam city authority at a cost of $134 million. The stadium is capable of holding approximately 52,000 people. The average attendance in 2006/07 was 48,610, rising in the next season to 49,128. The ArenA has a retractable roof and set a trend for other modern stadiums built in Europe in the following years. In the Netherlands, the ArenA has earned a reputation for a terrible grass pitch caused by the removable roof that, even when open, takes away too much sunlight and fresh air. During the 2008–2009 season groundstaff introduced an artificial lighting system that has finally reduced this problem considerably.

The much-loved De Meer stadium was torn down and the land was sold to the city council. A residential neighbourhood now occupies the area. The only thing left of the old stadium are the letters AJAX, nowadays in place on the façade of the youth training grounds De Toekomst, near the Amsterdam Arena.

==Ajax and Judaism==
[[Image:3070281519 5ab83a4dbb.jpg|thumb|Israeli flag at the Amsterdam Arena.]]

Ajax is popularly seen as having &quot;Jewish roots&quot;, although not an official Jewish club like the city's WV/HEDW Ajax has had a Jewish image since the 30's when the home stadium was located next to the Jewish neighbourhood of Amsterdam and opponents saw many supporters walking through this neighbourhood to get to the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportgeschiedenis.nl/2006/12/09/ajax-en-de-joden.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Ajax fans (few of whom are actually Jewish&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E7DB153FF93BA15750C0A9639C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 Amsterdam Journal; A Dutch Soccer Riddle: Jewish Regalia Without Jews] – New York Times, March 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;) responded by embracing Ajax's &quot;Jewish&quot; identity: calling themselves &quot;super Jews&quot;, chanting &quot;Jews, Jews&quot; (&quot;Joden, Joden&quot;) at games, and adopting Jewish symbols such as the [[Star of David]] and the [[Flag of Israel|Israeli flag]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;understanding&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=i21W_KN_iUMC&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=ajax%20jews&amp;client=safari&amp;pg=PA196 Understanding football hooliganism: A Comparison of Six Western European Clubs] by Ramon Spaaij, published 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources say that Ajax fans began doing this after seeing [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] fans [[Tottenham Hotspur F.

===Retired numbers===
*'''14''' – {{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Johan Cruyff]], honour of respect

As of the [[Eredivisie 2007-08|2007–08 season]], no player will wear the number 14 shirt at Ajax, since the club decided to retire the shirt out of respect for legend [[Johan Cruyff]]. Cruyff himself said that it would be better if the best player of the team were to wear number 14. Spanish midfielder [[Roger García Junyent|Roger]] was the last player to wear the number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://english.ajax.nl/web/show/id=154814/contentid=62523|title= Ajax retire number 14|accessdate= 2007-04-18|publisher = Ajax.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington''', [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|OM]], [[Royal Society|FRS]] (28 December 1882 – 22 November 1944) was a British [[astrophysicist]] of the early 20th century. The [[Eddington limit]], the natural limit to the [[luminosity]] of stars, or the radiation generated by accretion onto a compact object, is named in his honour.

He is famous for his work regarding the [[Theory of Relativity]]. Eddington wrote a number of articles which announced and explained [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[general relativity]] to the English-speaking world. [[World War I]] severed many lines of scientific communication and new developments in German science were not well known in England.  He also conducted an expedition to observe the [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|Solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]] that provided one of the earliest confirmations of relativity, and he became known for his popular expositions and interpretations of the theory.

== Biography ==
===Early Years===
Eddington was born in [[Kendal]], [[Cumbria]], England, son of [[Quaker]] parents, Arthur Henry Eddington and Sarah Ann Shout.  His father taught at a Quaker training college in Lancashire before moving to Kendal to become headmaster of Stramongate School. He died in the [[typhoid]] epidemic which swept England in 1884. When his father died, his mother was left to bring up her two children with relatively little income. The family moved to [[Weston-super-Mare]] where at first Stanley (as his mother and sister always called Eddington) was educated at home before spending three years at a preparatory school.

In 1893 Stanley entered Brynmelyn School. He proved to be a most capable scholar particularly in mathematics and English literature. His performance earned him a scholarship to Owens College, Manchester (what was later to become the [[University of Manchester]]) in 1898, which he was able to attend, having turned 16 that year. He spent the first year in a general course, but turned to [[physics]] for the next three years. Eddington was greatly influenced by his physics and mathematics teachers, [[Arthur Schuster]] and [[Horace Lamb]]. At Manchester, Eddington lived at Dalton Hall, where he came under the lasting influence of the Quaker mathematician J.W. Graham. His progress was rapid, winning him several scholarships and he graduated with a B.Sc. in physics with First Class Honours in 1902.

Based on his performance at Owens College, he was awarded a scholarship to the University of Cambridge (Trinity College) in 1902. His tutor at Cambridge was the distinguished mathematician R.A. Herman and in 1904 Eddington became the first ever second-year student to be placed as [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Senior Wrangler]].  After receiving his M.A. in 1905, he began research on [[thermionic emission]] in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]. This did not go well, and meanwhile he spent time teaching mathematics to first year engineering students. This hiatus was brief.

=== Astronomy ===

In January 1906, Eddington was nominated to the post of chief assistant to the [[Astronomer Royal]] at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]]. He left Cambridge for Greenwich the following month. He was put to work on a detailed analysis of the [[parallax]] of [[433 Eros]] on [[photographic plate]]s that had started in 1900. He developed a new statistical method based on the apparent drift of two background stars, winning him the [[Smith's Prize]] in 1907. The prize won him a Fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge. In December 1912 [[George Darwin]], son of [[Charles Darwin]], died suddenly and Eddington was promoted to his chair as the [[Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy]] in early 1913. Later that year, [[Robert Stawell Ball|Robert Ball]], holder of the theoretical [[Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry|Lowndean chair]] also died, and Eddington was named the director of the entire [[Cambridge Observatory]] the next year. In May, 1914 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and won their [[Royal Medal]] in 1918 and delivered their [[Bakerian Lecture]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27eddington%27%29| title = Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher = Royal Society| accessdate= 29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddington also investigated the interior of [[star]]s through theory, and developed the first true understanding of stellar processes. He began this in 1916 with investigations of possible physical explanations for [[Cepheid variables]].  He began by extending Karl Schwarzschild's earlier work on radiation pressure in Emden polytropic models. These models treated a star as a sphere of gas held up against gravity by internal thermal pressure, and one of Eddington's chief additions was to show that radiation pressure was necessary to prevent collapse of the sphere. He developed his model despite knowingly lacking firm foundations for understanding opacity and energy generation in the stellar interior. However, his results allowed for calculation of temperature, [[density]] and [[pressure]] at all points inside a star, and Eddington argued that his theory was so useful for further astrophysical investigation that it should be retained despite not being based on completely accepted physics. [[James Jeans]] contributed the important suggestion that stellar matter would certainly be [[Ionization|ionized]], but that was the end of any collaboration between the pair, who became famous for their lively debates.

Eddington defended his method by pointing to the utility of his results, particularly his important [[mass-luminosity relation]]. This had the unexpected result of showing that virtually all stars, including giants and dwarfs, behaved as [[ideal gases]].  In the process of developing his stellar models, he sought to overturn current thinking about the sources of stellar energy. Jeans and others defended the [[Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism]], which was based on classical mechanics, while Eddington speculated broadly about the qualitative and quantitative consequences of possible proton-electron annihilation and nuclear fusion processes.

With these assumptions, he demonstrated that the interior temperature of stars must be millions of degrees. In 1924, he discovered the [[Main sequence|mass-luminosity relation]] for [[star]]s (see Lecchini in [[#External links and references]] ).  Despite some disagreement, Eddington's models were eventually accepted as a powerful tool for further investigation, particularly in issues of stellar evolution.  The confirmation of his estimated stellar diameters by Michelson in 1920 proved crucial in convincing astronomers unused to Eddington's intuitive, exploratory style. Eddington's theory appeared in mature form in 1926 as ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars'', which became an important text for training an entire generation of astrophysicists.

During World War I Eddington became embroiled in controversy within the British astronomical and scientific communities. Many astronomers, chief among them H.H. Turner, argued that scientific relations with all of the Central Powers should be permanently ended due to their conduct in the war. Eddington, a Quaker pacifist, struggled to keep wartime bitterness out of astronomy. He repeatedly called for British scientists to preserve their pre-war friendships and collegiality with German scientists. Eddington's pacifism caused severe difficulties during the war, especially when he was called up for conscription in 1918. He claimed [[conscientious objector]] status, a position recognized by  the law, if somewhat despised by the public. In 1918 the government sought to revoke this deferment, and only the timely intervention of the Astronomer Royal and other high profile figures kept Eddington out of prison.

Eddington's work in astrophysics in the late 1920s and the 1930s continued his work in stellar structure, and precipitated further clashes with Jeans and [[Edward Arthur Milne]]. An important topic was the extension of his models to take advantage of developments in [[quantum physics]], including the use of degeneracy physics in describing dwarf stars. This  precipitated his famous dispute with [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]], who was then a student at Cambridge. Chandrasekhar's work presaged the existence of [[black hole]]s, which at the time seemed so absurdly non-physical that Eddington refused to believe that Chandrasekhar's purely mathematical derivation had consequences for the real world. Chandrasekhar's narrative of this incident, in which his work is harshly rejected, portrays Eddington as rather cruel and dogmatic, and is at variance with Eddington's character as described by other contemporaries. Eddington's criticism seems to have been based on a suspicion that a purely mathematical derivation from quantum theory was not enough to explain the daunting physical paradoxes that were apparently part of degenerate stars.

===Relativity===

During [[World War I]] Eddington was Secretary of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]], which meant he was the first to receive a series of letters and papers from [[Willem de Sitter]] regarding Einstein’s theory of general relativity.  Eddington was fortunate in being not only one of the few astronomers with the mathematical skills to understand general relativity, but (owing to his internationalist and pacifist views) one of the few at the time who was still interested in pursuing a theory developed by a German physicist. He quickly became the chief supporter and expositor of relativity in Britain. He and Astronomer Royal [[Frank Watson Dyson]] organized two expeditions to observe a solar eclipse in 1919 to make the first empirical test of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]’s theory: the measurement of the deflection of light by the sun's gravitational field.  In fact, it was Dyson’s argument for the indispensability of Eddington’s expertise in this test that allowed him to escape prison during the war.

[[Image:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|260px|thumb|right|One of Eddington's photographs of the total [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]], presented in his 1920 paper announcing its success, confirming [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory that light &quot;bends&quot;]]
After the war, Eddington travelled to the island of [[Príncipe]] near Africa to watch the [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]]. During the eclipse, he took pictures of the stars in the region around the Sun. According to the theory of [[general relativity]], stars with light rays that passed near the Sun would appear to have been slightly shifted because their light had been curved by its gravitational field. This effect is noticeable only during eclipses, since otherwise the Sun's brightness obscures the affected stars. Eddington showed that Newtonian gravitation could be interpreted to predict half the shift predicted by Einstein. (Somewhat confusingly, this same half-shift was initially predicted by Einstein with an incomplete version of general relativity.  By the time of the 1919 eclipse Einstein had corrected his calculations.)

Eddington's observations published the next year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dyson|coauthors= Eddington, A.S., &amp; Davidson, C.R. |year=1920 |title=A Determination of the Deflection of Light by the Sun's Gravitational Field, from Observations Made at the Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Physical, Mathematical and Engineering Sciences|Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. A]]|volume=220|issue=571-581|pages= 291–333|bibcode=1920RSPTA.220..291D|doi=10.1098/rsta.1920.0009|first =F.W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed Einstein's theory, and were hailed at the time as a conclusive proof of general relativity over the Newtonian model.  The news was reported in newspapers all over the world as a major story. Afterward, Eddington embarked on a campaign to popularize relativity and the expedition as landmarks both in scientific development and international scientific relations. 

It has been claimed that Eddington's observations were of poor quality and he had unjustly discounted simultaneous observations at [[Sobral, Brazil]] which appeared closer to the Newtonian model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xxx.arxiv.org/abs/0709.0685 Not Only Because of Theory: Dyson, Eddington and the Competing Myths of the 1919 Eclipse Expedition by Daniel Kennefick]&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the 1919 results was indeed poor compared to later observations, but was sufficient to persuade contemporary astronomers.  The rejection of the results from the Brazil expedition was due to a defect in the telescopes used which, again, was completely accepted and well-understood by contemporary astronomers.&lt;ref name= &quot;PhysToday&quot;&gt;[http://ptonline.aip.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_62/iss_3/37_1.shtml?type=PTFAVE&amp;bypassSSO=1 D. Kennefick, &quot;Testing relativity from the 1919 eclipse- a question of bias,&quot; ''Physics Today,'' March 2009, pp. 37-42.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this period Eddington lectured on relativity, and was particularly well known for his ability to explain the concepts in lay terms as well as scientific. He collected many of these into the ''Mathematical Theory of Relativity'' in 1923, which [[Albert Einstein]] suggested was &quot;the finest presentation of the subject in any language.&quot; He was an early advocate of Einstein's General Relativity, and an interesting anecdote well illustrates his humour and personal intellectual investment: [[Ludwig Silberstein]], a physicist who thought of himself as an expert on relativity, approached Eddington at the [[Royal Society]]'s (6 November) 1919 meeting where he had defended Einstein's Relativity with his Brazil-Principe Solar Eclipse calculations with some degree of scepticism and ruefully charged Arthur as one who claimed to be one of three men who actually understood the theory (Silberstein, of course, was including himself and Einstein as the other two). When Eddington refrained from replying, he insisted Arthur not be &quot;so shy&quot;, whereupon Eddington replied, &quot;Oh, no! I was wondering who the third one might be!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;As related by Eddington to Chandrasekhar and quoted in Walter Isaacson &quot;Einstein: His Life and Universe&quot;, page 262&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular and philosophical writings===

During the 1920s and 30s Eddington gave innumerable lectures, interviews, and radio broadcasts on relativity (in addition to his textbook ''[[List of publications in physics#The Mathematical Theory of Relativity|The Mathematical Theory of Relativity]]''), and later, quantum mechanics. Many of these were gathered into books, including ''The Nature of the Physical World'' and ''New Pathways in Science''. His skillful use of literary allusions and humor helped make these famously difficult subjects quite accessible.

Eddington's books and lectures were immensely popular with the public, not only because of Eddington’s clear and entertaining exposition, but also for his willingness to discuss the philosophical and religious implications of the new physics. He argued for a deeply-rooted philosophical harmony between scientific investigation and religious mysticism, and also that the positivist nature of modern physics (i.e., relativity and quantum physics) provided new room for personal religious experience and free will. Unlike many other spiritual scientists, he rejected the idea that science could provide proof of religious propositions. He promoted the [[infinite monkey theorem]] in his 1928 book ''The Nature of the Physical World'', with the phrase &quot;If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters, they might write all the books in the [[British Museum]]&quot;.  His popular writings made him, quite literally, a household name in Great Britain between the world wars.

===Idealism===

Sir Arthur Eddington wrote in his book The Nature of the Physical World  “The stuff of the world is mind-stuff.”

{{quote|The mind-stuff of the world is, of course, something more general than our individual conscious minds…. The mind-stuff is not spread in space and time; these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it…. It is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed, has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness…. Consciousness is not sharply defined, but fades into subconsciousness; and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature…. It is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character. But no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience, and all else is remote inference.&quot;|Eddington, ''The Nature of the Physical World'', 276-81.}}

The [[idealist]] conclusion was not integral to his epistemology but was based on two main arguments.{{Or|date=January 2011}}

The first derives directly from current physical theory. Briefly, mechanical theories of the ether and of the behavior of fundamental particles have been discarded in both relativity and quantum physics. From this Eddington inferred that a materialistic metaphysics was outmoded and that, in consequence—the disjunction of materialism or idealism being assumed exhaustive—an idealistic metaphysics is required. The second and more interesting argument was based on Eddington's epistemology and may be regarded as consisting of two parts. First, all we know of the objective world is its structure, and the structure of the objective world is precisely mirrored in our own consciousness. We therefore have no reason to doubt that the objective world, too, is &quot;mind-stuff.&quot; Dualistic metaphysics, then, cannot be evidentially supported. (The conclusion appears to be a valid deduction from its premises.){{Or|date=January 2011}}

But, second, not only can we not know that the objective world is nonmentalistic, we also cannot intelligibly suppose that it could be material. To conceive of a dualism entails attributing material properties to the objective world. However, this presupposes that we could observe that the objective world has material properties. But this is absurd, for whatever is observed must ultimately be the content of our own consciousness and, consequently, nonmaterial. This last argument confuses, among other things, the supposition that the objective world has certain properties with the supposition of our observing that it has them.{{Or|date=January 2011}}

[[Ian Barbour]] in his book Issues in Science and Religion (1966), p.&amp;nbsp;133, cites Arthur Eddington's The Nature of the Physical World (1928) for a text that argues The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principles provides a scientific basis for &quot;the defense of the idea of human freedom&quot; and his Science and the Unseen World (1929) for support of philosophical idealism &quot;the thesis that reality is basically mental&quot;.

[[Charles De Koninck]] points out that Eddington believed in objective reality existing apart from our minds, but was using the phrase &quot;mind-stuff&quot; to highlight the inherent intelligibility of the world: that our minds and the physical world are made of the same &quot;stuff&quot; and that our minds are the inescapable connection to the world.&lt;ref&gt;Charles De Koninck, &quot;The Philosophy of Sir Arthur Eddington,&quot; ''The Writings of Charles De Koninck'' (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 2008), 183-185.&lt;/ref&gt; As De Koninck quotes Eddington,

{{quote|There is a doctrine well known to philosophers that the moon ceases to exist when no one is looking at it. I will not discuss the doctrine since I have not the least idea what is the meaning of the word existence when used in this connection. At any rate the science of astronomy has not been based on this spasmodic kind of moon. In the scientific world (which has to fulfill functions less vague than merely existing) there is a moon which appeared on the scene before the astronomer; it reflects sunlight when no one sees it; it has mass when no one is measuring the mass; it is distant 240,000 miles from the earth when no one is surveying the distance; and it will eclipse the sun in 1999 even if the human race has succeeded in killing itself off before that date.|Eddington, ''The Nature of the Physical World'', 226}}

===Cosmology===

Eddington was also heavily involved with the development of the first generation of general relativistic cosmological models. He had been investigating the instability of the Einstein universe when he learned of both [[Georges Lemaître|Lemaitre's]] 1927 paper postulating an expanding or contracting universe and Hubble's work on the recession on the spiral nebulae. He felt the [[cosmological constant]] must have played the crucial role in the universe's evolution from an Einsteinian steady state to its current expanding state, and most of his cosmological investigations focused on the constant's significance and characteristics.

=== Fundamental theory ===
During the 1920s until his death, he increasingly concentrated on what he called &quot;[[Theory of everything|fundamental theory]]&quot; which was intended to be a unification of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], [[theory of relativity|relativity]] and [[gravitation]]. At first he progressed along &quot;traditional&quot; lines, but turned increasingly to an almost [[numerology|numerological]] analysis of the dimensionless ratios of fundamental constants.

His basic approach was to combine several fundamental constants in order to produce a dimensionless number. In many cases these would result in numbers close to 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;, its square, or its square root. He was convinced that the mass of the [[proton]] and the charge of the [[electron]] were a ''natural and complete specification for constructing a Universe'' and that their values were not accidental. One of the discoverers of quantum mechanics, [[Paul Dirac]], also pursued this line of investigation, which has become known as the [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis]], and some scientists even today believe it has something to it.

A somewhat damaging statement in his defence of these concepts involved the [[fine structure constant]], α. At the time it was measured to be very close to 1/136, and he argued that the value should in fact be exactly 1/136 for epistemological reasons. Later measurements placed the value much closer to 1/137, at which point he switched his line of reasoning to argue that one more should be added to the [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], so that the value should in fact be exactly 1/137, the [[Eddington number]]. Wags at the time started calling him &quot;Arthur Adding-one&quot;{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}.  This change of stance detracted from Eddington's credibility in the physics community. The [http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?alphinv|search_for=fine+structure+constant current measured value] is estimated at 1/137.035999679(94).

Eddington believed he had identified an algebraic basis for fundamental physics, which he termed &quot;E-frames&quot; (representing a certain [[group (mathematics)|group]] - a Clifford algebra). While his theory has long been neglected by the general physics community, similar algebraic notions underlie many modern attempts at a [[grand unified theory]]. Moreover, Eddington's emphasis on the values of the fundamental constants, and specifically upon dimensionless numbers derived from them, is nowadays a central concern of physics.

He did not complete this line of research before his death in 1944, and his book entitled ''Fundamental Theory'' was published posthumously in 1948. Eddington died in [[Cambridge]], England and is buried at the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]] in Cambridge.

=== Eddington number (cycling) ===
Eddington is credited with devising a measure of a cyclist's long distance riding achievements. The Eddington Number in this context is defined as E, the number of days a cyclist has cycled more than E miles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physicsworldarchive.iop.org/index.cfm?action=summary&amp;doc=18%2F11%2Fphwv18i11a30%40pwa-xml&amp;qt= PhysicsWorld Archive » Volume 18 » Cycling record&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tlatet.blogspot.com/2008/03/eddington-number.html Tlatet: Eddington number&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For example an Eddington Number of 70 would imply that a cyclist has cycled more than 70 miles  in a day on 70 occasions. Achieving a high Eddington number is difficult since moving from, say, 70 to 75 will probably require more than five new long distance rides since any rides shorter than 75 miles will no longer be included in the reckoning.

The construct of the Eddington Number for cycling is identical to the [[h-index|''h''-index]] that quantifies both the actual scientific productivity and the apparent scientific impact of a scientist.

'''Alexis Korner''' (19 April 1928 — 1 January 1984) was a pioneering [[blues]] [[musician]] and [[Presenter|radio broadcaster]] who has sometimes been referred to as &quot;a Founding Father of [[British Blues]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|iDE0dH6ZLwUC|Then, now and rare British beat 1960-1969 by Terry Rawlings|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major influence on the sound of the British music scene in the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiorewind.co.uk/alexis_korner_page.htm  &quot;Korner, a pioneer and influential musician&quot; retrieved 26 August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Korner was instrumental in bringing together various [[England|English]] blues musicians.

==Early career==
'''Alexis Andrew Nicholas Koerner''' was born in [[Paris]] to an [[Austria]]n father and [[Greece|Greek]] mother, and spent his childhood in France, [[Switzerland]], and [[North Africa]]. He arrived in London in 1940 at the start of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. One memory of his youth was listening to a record by black pianist [[Jimmy Yancey]] during a German air raid. He said, ''&quot;From then on all I wanted to do was play the blues.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;tsxbpf&quot;&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p412/biography|pure_url=yes}} Bio at Allmusic.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, he played piano and guitar (his first guitar was built by friend and author [[Sydney Hopkins]], who wrote [[Mister God, This Is Anna]]), and in 1949 joined [[Chris Barber]]'s Jazz Band&lt;ref&gt;[[John Pidgeon (Writer, radio producer)|John Pidgeon]]'s Rock'sbackpagesblog: http://www.rocksbackpagesblogs.com/2009/09/chris-barber-father-of-british-rb/&lt;/ref&gt; where he met blues harmonica player [[Cyril Davies]]. They started playing together as a duo, formed the influential London Blues and Barrelhouse Club in 1955, and made their first record together in 1957. Korner brought many [[United States|American]] blues artists, previously unknown in England, to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|4y-oDmH2YzYC|The Beatles, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  by Allan F. Moore|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 1960s==
{{Main|Blues Incorporated}}
In 1961, Korner and Davies formed [[Blues Incorporated]],&lt;ref&gt;[[John Pidgeon (Writer, radio producer)|John Pidgeon]]'s Rock'sbackpages blog: http://www.rocksbackpagesblogs.com/2009/09/blues-incorporated-how-british-rb-trashed-trad&lt;/ref&gt; initially a loose-knit group of musicians with a shared love of [[electric blues]] and [[R&amp;B]] music. The group included, at various times, such influential musicians as [[Charlie Watts]], [[Jack Bruce]], [[Ginger Baker]], [[Long John Baldry]], [[Graham Bond]], [[Danny Thompson]] and [[Dick Heckstall-Smith]]. It also attracted a wider crowd of mostly younger fans, some of whom occasionally performed with the group, including [[Mick Jagger]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Brian Jones]], [[Geoff Bradford (musician)|Geoff Bradford]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[John Mayall]] and [[Jimmy Page]].&lt;ref name=Shapiro1997&gt;{{cite book|last = Shapiro |first = Harry |authorlink = Harry Shapiro |title = Alexis Korner: The Biography |year =1997|isbn = 0-7475-3163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One story is that The Rolling Stones went to stay at Korner's house late one night, in the early 1960s, after a performance. They entered in the accepted way, by climbing in through the kitchen window, to find [[Muddy Waters]]' band sleeping on the kitchen floor. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Although Cyril Davies left the group in 1963, Blues Incorporated continued to record, with Korner at the helm, until 1966. However, by that time its originally stellar line-up and crowd of followers had mostly left to start their own bands. ''&quot;While his one-time acolytes [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Cream (band)|Cream]] made the front pages of music magazines all over the world, Korner was relegated to the role of 'elder statesman'.&quot;''&lt;ref name = &quot;tsxbpf&quot;/&gt;

Although he himself was a blues purist, Korner criticised better-known British blues musicians during the blues boom of the late 1960s for their blind adherence to [[Chicago blues]], as if the music came in no other form. He liked to surround himself with [[jazz]] musicians and often performed with a [[horn section]] drawn from a pool which included, among others, [[saxophone]] players [[Art Themen]], [[Mel Collins]], [[Dick Heckstall-Smith]], [[Dick Morrissey]], [[John Surman]] and [[trombonist]] [[Mike Zwerin]].

== Broadcasting ==

In the 1960s Korner began a media career, working initially as a [[show business]] interviewer and then on [[ITV]]'s ''Five O'Clock Club'', a children's TV show. Korner also wrote about blues for the music papers, and continued to maintain his own career as a blues artist, especially in Europe. 

On 17 October 1967, Korner interviewed [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]] for the [[BBC]] radio show [[Top Gear (radio show)|Top Gear]]. Some of these tracks, including audio of Korner himself, appear on the Hendrix double-CD [[BBC Sessions (The Jimi Hendrix Experience album)|BBC Sessions]], including Korner playing slide guitar on [[(I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man]].

While touring [[Scandinavia]] he first joined forces with singer [[Peter Thorup]], together forming the band [[New Church (band)|New Church]], who were one of the support bands at the [[Rolling Stones]] Free Concert at Hyde Park on 5 July 1969. [[Jimmy Page]] reportedly found out about a new singer, [[Robert Plant]], who had been jamming with Korner, who wondered why Plant had not yet been discovered. Plant and Korner were in the process of recording a full album with Plant on vocals until Page had asked him to join &quot;the New [[Yardbirds]]&quot;, aka [[Led Zeppelin]]. Only two songs are in circulation from these recordings: &quot;Steal Away&quot; and &quot;Operator&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro1997&quot;/&gt;

=== 1970s===
{{Main|C. C. S. (pop group)}}
[[Image:Alexis Korner 1968 Bremen.jpg|thumb|160px|Korner and [[Peter Thorup]] in [[Bremen]]]]
In 1970 Korner and Thorup formed a big band ensemble, [[C. C. S. (pop group)|C.C.S.]] - short for ''The Collective Consciousness Society'' - which had several hit singles produced by [[Mickie Most]], including a version of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s &quot;[[Whole Lotta Love]]&quot; which was used as the theme for BBC's ''[[Top Of The Pops]]'' between 1971 and 1981. Another instrumental called &quot;Brother&quot; was used as the theme to the [[BBC Radio 1]] Top 20/40 when [[Tom Browne (broadcaster and actor)|Tom Browne]]/[[Simon Bates]] presented the programme in the 1970s. This was the period of Korner's greatest commercial success in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro1997&quot;/&gt;

=== 1970s to 1984===
[[Image:Alexis Korner musician.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Korner with Blues Incorporated]]
In 1973, he formed another group, [[Snape (group)|Snape]], with [[Boz Burrell]], Mel Collins, and [[Ian Wallace (drummer)|Ian Wallace]], who were previously together in [[King Crimson]]. Korner also played on [[B. B. King]]'s ''In London'' album, and cut his own, similar 'supersession' album; ''Get Off My Cloud'', with [[Keith Richards]], [[Peter Frampton]], [[Nicky Hopkins]] and members of [[Joe Cocker]]'s [[The Grease Band|Grease Band]]. In the mid 1970s, while touring [[Germany]], Korner established an intensive working relationship with bassist [[Colin Hodgkinson]] who played for the support act [[Back Door (jazz trio)|Back Door]]. They would continue to collaborate right up until Korner's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro1997&quot;/&gt;

In the 1970s Korner's main career was in broadcasting. In 1973 he presented a unique 6-part documentary on [[BBC Radio 1]], ''The [[Rolling Stones]] Story'',&lt;ref name = &quot;ibndjr&quot;&gt;[http://radiorewind.co.uk/alexis_korner_page.htm Radiorewind.co.uk -  retrieved 26 August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1977 he established a Sunday night blues and soul show on Radio 1, &quot;Alexis Korner's Blues and Soul show&quot;, which ran until 1981. He also used his gravelly voice to great effect as an advertising voice-over artist. In 1978, for Korner's 50th birthday, an all-star concert was held featuring many of his friends mentioned above, as well as [[Eric Clapton]], [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]], [[Chris Farlowe]], [[Zoot Money]] and other friends, which was later released as ''[[The Party Album (Alexis Korner album)|The Party Album]]'', and as a video.

In 1981, he joined another &quot;supergroup&quot;, [[Rocket 88 (band)|Rocket 88]], a project led by [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] based on [[boogie-woogie]] [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] players, which featured a [[rhythm section]] comprising [[Jack Bruce]] and [[Charlie Watts]], among others, as well as a [[horn section]]. They toured Europe and released an album on [[Atlantic Records]]. He played in Italy with [[Paul Jones]] and the Blues Society of Italian bluesman [[Guido Toffoletti]].

Korner, a lifelong chain smoker, died of [[lung cancer]] in [[London]] on 1 January 1984, aged 55. He left behind a daughter, the musician Sappho Gillett Korner, and two sons, guitarist Nicholas (Nico) Korner and the sound engineer Damian Korner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro1997&quot;/&gt;

An '''assault gun''' is a [[gun]] or [[howitzer]] mounted on a motor vehicle or [[armoured warfare|armored]] [[chassis]], designed for use in the [[direct fire]] role in support of [[infantry]] when attacking other [[infantry]] or [[fortified]] positions.

Historically the custom-built fully armored assault guns usually mounted the [[gun]] or [[howitzer]] in a fully enclosed [[casemate]] on a [[tank]] [[chassis]]. The use of a [[casemate]] instead of a [[gun turret]] limited these weapons' [[field of fire (weaponry)|field of fire]], but provided a simpler construction that was cheaper to build and less prone to mechanical breakdowns. The increased space and reduced weight of the turretless design also allowed for the mounting of a larger [[weapon]] and heavier frontal [[armour]] on any given chassis.  In most cases, these turretless vehicles also presented a lower profile as a target for the enemy.

==History==
===World War II===
[[Image:KW-2 1940.jpg|thumb|left|Soviet [[KV-2]], an assault gun variant of the [[KV-1]] [[tank]] with an oversized [[howitzer]] mount replacing the turret, 1940]]

Assault guns were primarily used during [[World War II]] by the forces of [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Early in the war, the [[Germans]] began to create makeshift assault guns by mounting their [[infantry support weapon]]s on the bed of a [[truck]] or on obsolete [[tank]]s with the turret removed. Later in the war, both the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] introduced fully [[armoured warfare|armored]] purpose-built assault guns into their arsenals.

Early on, the Soviets built the [[KV-2]], a variant of the [[KV-1]] heavy tank with a short-barreled [[152 mm howitzer-gun M1937 (ML-20)|152 mm howitzer]] mounted in an oversized turret. This was not a success in [[battle]], and was replaced with a very successful series of increasingly powerful turretless assault guns: the [[SU-76]], [[SU-122]], and the heavy [[SU-152]], which were followed by the [[ISU-122]] and [[ISU-152]] on the new [[Iosif Stalin tank|IS]] heavy [[tank]] [[chassis]].

[[Image:Germany06 086.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sturmtiger]] in the [[Deutsches Panzermuseum]] at [[Munster, Lower Saxony|Munster]].]]

The primary German assault gun was the [[Sturmgeschütz III]] (StuG III). Armed with a high-velocity dual-purpose 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun, late production StuG III variants blurred the line between assault guns and [[tank destroyer]]s. The Germans also built a number of other fully armored turretless assault guns, including the [[StuG IV]], [[Brummbär]] and [[Sturmtiger]]. The latter two were very heavy vehicles and were built only in small quantities.

[[Battalions]] of assault guns, usually [[StuG III]]s, commonly replaced the intended [[panzer]] [[battalion]] in the German [[Panzergrenadier|panzergrenadier divisions]] due to the chronic shortage of [[tanks]], and were sometimes used as makeshifts even in the [[panzer division]]s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Independent [[battalions]] were also deployed as 'stiffeners' for [[infantry]] divisions, and the [[StuG III]]'s [[anti-tank]] capabilities contributed greatly to the German's ability to draw out [[World War II]] after they had lost the strategic initiative. However, command problems ensued, as the assault guns were considered to be [[artillery]] by the [[Wehrmacht]] (despite that they were, and should be, employed as a [[tank]].) Therefore the assault guns were not under the control of the [[Panzer]] unit's commanding officer, reducing unit effectiveness. 
[[Image:Sherman Tank WW2.jpg|right|thumb|A preserved Sherman M4(105).]]
[[United Kingdom|British]] and [[United States|American]] forces also deployed vehicles designed for a close support role, but these were conventional tanks whose only significant modification was the replacement of the main gun with a howitzer. Among these was the '''[[M4 Sherman|M4]](105)''', a [[M4 Sherman]] [[tank]] armed with a [[105 mm howitzer]]. In addition, the Mark IV version of the [[Cromwell tank|Centaur tank]] and the Mark V and the Mark VIII versions of the [[Churchill Tank]] were fitted with [[Ordnance QF 95 mm Howitzer|95&amp;nbsp;mm howitzers]]. As the amount of German armour encountered by the Allies decreased, especially in Italy, a number of American [[tank destroyer]] units were used in the assault gun role for infantry support.

The AVRE version of the Churchill Tank was armed with a [[Mortar (weapon)#Spigot mortar|Spigot Mortar]] that fired a forty pound (18&amp;nbsp;kg) [[High explosive|HE]]-filled projectile (nicknamed the ''Flying Dustbin'') 150 yards (137 metres). Its task was to attack fortified positions such as [[Bunker]]s at close range (see [[Hobart's Funnies]]).

=== Postwar use ===

In the post-[[World War II|WWII]] era, vehicles fitting into an &quot;assault gun&quot; category were developed as a light-weight, air-deployable, direct fire weapon for use with airborne troops. Current weapons were either based on [[jeep]]s or small [[Caterpillar track|tracked]] vehicles and the airborne troops thus always fought at a distinct disadvantage in terms of heavy weapons.  The Soviet Union and the United States were the most attracted to the idea of providing this capability to traditionally light airborne forces.  Their answers to the problem were similar, with the United States developing the [[M56 Scorpion]] and the Soviet Union developing the [[ASU-57]], both essentially air-droppable light anti-tank guns.

The Soviets went on to develop an improved air-droppable assault gun, the [[ASU-85]], which served through the 1980s, while their [[SU-100]] remained in service with Communist countries, including Vietnam and Cuba, years after WW2.  The US M56 and another similar vehicle, the [[Ontos|M50 Ontos]], were to be the last of the more traditional assault guns in US service.  Improvised arrangements such as [[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier#Weapons|M113]] personnel carriers with recoilless rifles were quickly replaced by missile carrier vehicles in the anti-tank role.

The only vehicle with the qualities of an assault gun to be fielded after the removal of the M50 and M56 from service within the US military was the [[M551 Sheridan]]. The Sheridan's gun was a low-velocity weapon suitable in the assault role, but with the addition of the [[Shillelagh missile]] could double in the anti-tank role as well.  It is important, however, to remember that the Sheridan was not developed as an assault gun, but as a light reconnaissance vehicle.

Currently there appears to be a move toward wheeled vehicles fitting a &quot;tank destroyer&quot; or &quot;assault gun&quot; role, with the US testing the [[Mobile Gun System|M1128 Stryker MGS]].  The [[Centauro]] Wheeled Tank Destroyer of the [[Italian Army]] and [[Spanish Army]] and the French [[AMX 10 RC]] heavy armored car are also good examples.  While these vehicles might be useful in a direct fire role, none were developed with this specifically in mind, reminiscent of the use of tank destroyers by the US military in the assault gun role during WWII.

[[File:Tank destroyers.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Two American M10 tank destroyers in France during World War II.]]
A '''tank destroyer''', is a type of [[armored fighting vehicle]] armed with a gun, or missile launcher, and is designed specifically to engage enemy armored vehicles. Many have been based on a [tracked] tank chassis, while others are wheeled. 

Since [[World War II]], [[main battle tank]]s have largely replaced gun-armed tank destroyers although lightly armored [[anti-tank missile|anti tank guided missile]] (ATGM) carriers are commonly used for supplementary long-range anti-tank work. However, the resurgence of expeditionary warfare in the past twenty years has seen the emergence of gun-armed wheeled vehicles, sometimes called protected gun systems, that are tank destroyers in all but name.  

== World War II ==
Dedicated anti-tank vehicles made their first major appearance in the Second World War as combatants developed effective armored vehicles and tactics.  Some were little more than stopgap solutions, mounting a gun on a tracked vehicle to give mobility, while others were more sophisticated designs.  An example of the development of tank destroyer technology throughout the war are the [[Marder III]] and [[Hetzer]] vehicle, that were very different in spite of being based on the same chassis: Marder was straightforwardly an anti-tank gun on tracks whereas Hetzer traded some firepower (its Pak 39, designed to operate within the confines of a full-armored fighting compartment, fires the same projectiles from a reduced propellant charge compared to Marder's Pak 40) for better armor protection and ease of battlefield concealment.  

The role of the tank destroyer was to attack enemy tanks from an ambush. A turret was not particularly important for this form of attack, nor particularly desirable since a low silhouette was paramount in order to make the vehicle easier to conceal. The absence of a turret also meant that tank destroyers could be manufactured significantly cheaper, faster and more easily than the tanks on which they were based. 

Except for the American tank destroyers they were all turretless and had fixed or [[casemate]] superstructures.  The later allowed accommodation of a bigger cannon than could be mounted in a turreted tank on the same chassis, and increased the vehicle's internal volume, allowing for increased ammunition stowage and crew comfort.&lt;ref&gt;([[#References|Perrett 1987:84]])&lt;/ref&gt; Eliminating the turret also allowed the vehicle to carry thicker armor than would otherwise be the case, although sometimes there was no roof (or merely a strip of canvas) to keep the overall weight down to the limit that the chassis could bear.  After hard lessons early in the war, machine guns were mounted for use against infantry but the mounting was usually less effective than that which would be found on a true tank. 


===Polish===
The first dedicated tank destroyers{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} were two models of [[TKS]] Polish [[tankette]]s with 20&amp;nbsp;mm (24 vehicles) and 37&amp;nbsp;mm guns (2).  They suffered heavy losses during the [[invasion of Poland]] before entering battles due to air bombardment, penetrating their weak top armor.

===German===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-782-0041-31, Nordafrika, Panzerjäger 1.jpg|thumb|''Panzerjäger'' I]]

The first [[Nazi Germany|German]] tank destroyers were the ''[[Panzerjäger]]'' (&quot;tank hunters&quot;) which took an existing anti-tank gun and mounted it on a convenient chassis to give mobility, usually with just a three-sided [[gun shield]] for protection. For instance, 202 German [[Panzer I]] light tanks were modified by removing the turret and were rebuilt as the [[Panzerjäger I]] self-propelled [[Škoda Works|Skoda]] {{nowrap|47 mm}} anti-tank gun. Similarly, [[Panzer II]] tanks were used on the eastern front. Captured Soviet {{nowrap|76.2 mm}} anti-tank guns were mounted on modified [[Panzer II]] chassis, producing the [[Marder II]] self-propelled anti-tank gun. The most common mounting was a German {{nowrap|75 mm}} anti-tank gun on the Czech [[Panzer 38(t)]] chassis to produce the [[Marder III]]. The Panzer 38(t) chassis was also used to make the Jagdpanzer 38 '[[Hetzer]]' casemate style tank destroyer. The Panzerjäger series continued up to the {{nowrap|88 mm}} equipped [[Nashorn]]. 

[[File:StuG-III-latrun-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Sturmgeschütz'' III]]

German tank destroyers based on the Panzer Mk III or later German tanks were unique in that they had more armor than their tank counterparts, sacrificing speed for better crew protection.  One of the more successful German tank destroyers was actually designed as a self-propelled artillery gun, the [[Sturmgeschütz III]].  Based on the Mk III tank chassis, the Sturmgeschütz III was originally fitted with a low-velocity gun, and was assigned to the artillery arm for infantry fire support.  Later, after encountering Soviet tanks, it was refitted with a high-velocity anti-tank gun, enabling it to function as a tank destroyer.  The ''Sturmgeschütz III'' used a new casemate-style superstructure with an integrated design similar to the later ''[[Jagdpanzer]]''.  It became the single most-produced armored fighting vehicle of Nazi Germany throughout the war, and was employed in infantry support and offensive armored operations as well in the defensive anti-tank role.  

[[File:Jagdpanther2.jpg|thumb|right|''Jagdpanther'']]
Although the early German ''Panzerjäger'' carried more effective weapons than the tanks on which they were based, they were generally lacking in protection for the crew, having thinly armored open-topped superstructures. The &quot;open-topped&quot; design format of the ''Panzerjäger'' vehicles was succeeded by the ''Jagdpanzer'' '(&quot;hunting tanks&quot;) which mounted the gun in true casemate-style superstructures, completely enclosing the crew compartment in armor that was integral to the hull.  The first of these ''Jagdpanzer''s was the ''Ferdinand'' (later renamed the ''[[Elefant]]''), a 70-ton monster mounting an 88&amp;nbsp;mm cannon.  However, the ''Elefant'' proved to be mechanically unreliable and difficult to maneuver, and the type was discontinued after only 91 vehicles had been completed.  The German Army had more success with the [[Jagdpanther]].  Introduced in mid-1944, the Jagdpanther was considered the best of the casemate-design Jagdpanzer designs.&lt;ref name=&quot;tanks&quot;&gt;Forty and Livesey 2006 p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  It featured an {{nowrap|88 mm}} cannon fitted to the chassis of the medium [[Panther tank]], providing greatly improved armor-penetrating capability in a medium-weight vehicle.  

[[File:Jagdtiger ussr 1945.jpg|thumb|left|''Jagdtiger'']]

Facing an increasingly defensive war, the German Army reverted to larger and and more powerfully armed Jagdpanzer designs, and in July 1944 the first ''[[Jagdtiger]]'' rolled off the production line, the heaviest German armored fighting vehicle to go into active service.&lt;ref name=&quot;tanks&quot;/&gt;  The ''Jagdtiger'' featured a huge 128&amp;nbsp;mm cannon and heavy armor protection.  It was first deployed to combat units in September 1944.    

The decision of German armored vehicle designers to use a casemate-stye superstructure for all tank destroyers had the advantage of a reduced silhouette, allowing the crew to more frequently fire from defilade ambush positions.  Such designs were also easier and faster to manufacture and offered good crew protection from artillery fire and shell splinters.  However, the lack of a rotating turret limited the gun's traverse to a few degrees. This meant that the entire tank normally had to be turned onto its target by the driver, a much slower process than simply rotating a powered turret.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, John P. ''Another River, Another Town'', New York: Random House Publishers (2002), pp. 61-61&lt;/ref&gt;  If the TD became immobilized due to engine failure or track damage, it could not rotate its gun to counter opposing tanks, making it highly vulnerable to counterfire.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, pp. 61-61&lt;/ref&gt;  This vulnerability was later exploited by opposing tank forces. Even the largest and most powerful of German tank destroyers were found abandoned on the field after a battle, having been immobilized by one or more hits by high explosive (HE) or armor-piercing (AP) shells to the track or front drive sprocket.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, pp. 61-62: Even the U.S. M4 Sherman could disable a Jagdpanther's track or fracture the front drive sprocket with a 75&amp;nbsp;mm HE shell.  As the TD crew abandoned their vehicle, they were easy targets for enemy machinegun fire.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet===
[[Image:ISU-122 skos RB.jpg|thumb|Soviet [[ISU-122]], a [[casemate]] tank destroyer of the Second World War, shown here with postwar [[Polish Army]] markings]]

As with the Germans, most of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] designs mounted anti-tank guns, with limited traverse in casemate-style turretless hulls. The results were smaller, lighter, and simpler to build than tanks, but could carry larger guns. The Soviets produced the {{nowrap|85 mm}} [[SU-85]] and {{nowrap|100 mm}} [[SU-100]] self-propelled guns based on the same chassis as the [[T-34]] medium tank, as well as the {{nowrap|122 mm}} [[ISU-122]] and {{nowrap|152 mm}} [[ISU-152]] which shared components with the [[IS-2]] heavy tank and was nicknamed ''Zveroboy'' (&quot;beast killer&quot;) for its ability to destroy German [[Tiger I tank|Tigers]], [[Panther tank|Panthers]] and [[Elefant]]s. The ISU-152 built as a heavy assault gun, relied on the weight of the shell fired from its M-1937/43 howitzer to defeat tanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;tanks2&quot;&gt;Forty and Livesey 2006 p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, the Soviets also shifted all production of light tanks like the [[T-70]] to much simpler and better-armed [[SU-76]] self-propelled guns, which used the same drive train. The SU-76 &quot;Suka&quot; was originally designed as an anti-tank vehicle, but was soon relegated to the infantry-support role.&lt;ref name=&quot;tanks3&quot;&gt;Forty and Livesey 2006 p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|Tank destroyer battalion (United States)}}
[[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and counterpart [[United Kingdom|British]] designs were very different in conception. U.S. doctrine was based in light of the [[fall of France]] on the perceived need to defeat German [[blitzkrieg]] tactics, and U.S. units expected to be faced with large numbers of German tanks attacking on relatively narrow fronts. These were expected to breakthrough a thin screen of largely immobile anti-tank guns, hence the decision to go for mobility. All American tank destroyers were officially known by the exact same collective term used for American self-propelled artillery ordnance, &quot;Gun Motor Carriage&quot;. 

In actual practice, such attacks rarely happened; indeed, throughout the war only one battalion ever fought in an engagement quite like that which had originally been envisaged. The Tank Destroyer Command eventually numbered over 100,000 men and 80 battalions each equipped with 36 self-propelled tank destroyers or towed guns.

[[File:Aberdean proving grounds 036.JPG|thumb|3in Gun Motor Carriage M10]]
The U.S. tank destroyer designs were intended to be very mobile and heavily armed. Most retained a turret, but left it open on top both to save weight and to accommodate a larger gun. The earliest expedient design was an [[M3 Half-track]] mounting an M1897 {{nowrap|75 mm}} gun in a limited-traverse mount, and called the [[M3 GMC|75 mm Gun Motor Carriage M3]]. Another, considerably less successful, early design mounted a 37-mm anti-tank gun in the bed of a Dodge 3/4-ton truck - the [[M6 Fargo|37-mm GMC M6]]. By far the most common US design was the [[M10 Tank Destroyer|3in Gun Motor Carriage M10 (Wolverine)]], later supplemented by the [[M36 tank destroyer|90&amp;nbsp;mm Gun Motor Carriage M36 (Jackson)]] and [[M18 Hellcat|76&amp;nbsp;mm Gun Motor Carriage M18 (Hellcat)]]. The M18 came closest to the US ideal; the vehicle was very fast, small, and mounted a {{nowrap|76 mm}} gun in a turret. The M36 Jackson GMC possessed the only American-origin operational gun that could rival the vaunted 88&amp;nbsp;mm German ordnance, the [[90 mm Gun M1/M2/M3|90 mm M3 gun]], and the M36 remained in service well after World War II.  The only dedicated American-origin, casemate hull design fighting vehicle of any type to be built during the war, that resembled the German and Soviet tank destroyers in hull and general gun mounting design, was the experimental [[T28 Super Heavy Tank]], which mounted a 105&amp;nbsp;mm T5E1 long-barrel cannon, which had a maximum firing range of 12 miles (20&amp;nbsp;km), and was originally designed as a self-propelled assault gun to breach Germany's [[Siegfried Line]] defenses. 

Of these tank destroyers, only the {{nowrap|90 mm}} gun of the M36 proved to be effective against the Germans' larger armored vehicles at long range.&lt;ref name=&quot;tanks3&quot;&gt;Forty and Livesey 2006 p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The open top and light armor made these tank destroyers vulnerable to anything greater than small-arms fire. As the number of German tanks encountered by American forces steadily decreased throughout the war, most battalions were split up and assigned to infantry units as supporting arms, fighting as [[assault guns]] or being used essentially as tanks.

===British===
Although initially flawed in its division of tanks into [[cruiser tank|cruiser]] and [[infantry tank|infantry]] support roles{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}, repeated encounters with German armor led the British to recognize the inevitability of tank-to-tank combat earlier than the Americans{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. As a result, there was extra impetus given to the development of anti-tank weaponry, which culminated in the [[Ordnance QF 17 pounder]], widely considered one of the best anti-tank guns of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;tanks4&quot;&gt;Forty and Livesey 2006 p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Towed anti-tank guns were the domain of the [[Royal Artillery]] rather than the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] and vehicles adapted to mount artillery including anti-tank self-propelled guns such as the [[Deacon (artillery)|Deacon]] and [[Archer (tank destroyer)|Archer]] were their preserve.

[[File:Archer SP 17 pdr Tank Destroyer.jpg|thumb|Archer. The gun faced to the rear]]
The self-propelled guns that were built in the &quot;tank destroyer&quot; mold came about through the desire to field the formidable [[QF 17 pounder]] anti-tank gun and simultaneous lack of suitable tanks to carry it. As a result they were of a somewhat extemporized nature. Mounting the gun on the [[Valentine tank]] chassis gave the Marder-like [[Archer (tank destroyer)|Archer]]. The 17 pounder was also used to re-equip the US-supplied [[M10 Tank Destroyer]], replacing the American 3&quot; gun to produce the [[17pdr SP Achilles]]. 
The [[Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger|Tank, Cruiser, Challenger (A30)]] was a project to bring a 17 pdr tank into use to support the Cromwell cruiser tank. Delays led to it being outnumbered in use by the [[Sherman Firefly]] but a derivative of Challenger was the more-or-less open-topped variant ''Avenger'' which was delayed until post war before entering service.

The closest the British came to developing an armored tank destroyer in the vein of the German Jagdpanzers or Soviet ISU series was the Churchill 3&amp;nbsp;inch Gun Carrier {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} - a [[Churchill tank]] chassis with a boxy superstructure in place of the turret and mounting a 3&amp;nbsp;inch anti-aircraft gun. Although a number were ordered, they were not put into service. The design was rejected in favor of developing a 17 pounder armed Cromwell tank variant ultimately leading to the [[Comet tank]]. The heavy assault tank known as [[Tortoise (tank)|Tortoise]] was well armoured and had a very powerful 32 pounder gun but did not reach service use.

By 1944, a number of the [[Sherman tank|Shermans]] in British use were being converted to [[Sherman Fireflies]] by adding the QF 17 pounder gun. Initially this gave each platoon of Shermans one powerfully armed tank. By war's end - through the production of more Fireflies and the replacement of Shermans by British tanks - about 50% of Shermans in British service were Fireflies.

== Post-World War II==
In the face of the Warsaw Pact, a general need for extra firepower was identified. In the 1950s, the UK produced the [[FV 4101 Charioteer]] to beef up the tank regiments, mounting a 20 pounder gun in an oversize turret on the Cromwell tank hull—it lacked the all round capability of the [[Centurion tank]]. In the late 1960s, Germany developed the [[Kanonenjagdpanzer]], essentially a modernized World War II Jagdpanzer mounting a {{nowrap|90 mm}} gun. As Soviet designs became more heavily armored, the {{nowrap|90 mm}} gun became ineffective and the Kanonenjagdpanzers were retrofitted for different roles or retired. Some provisions were made for the fitting of a 105&amp;nbsp;mm cannon, and many of the vehicles were modified to fire [[Euromissile HOT|HOT]] or [[TOW missile]]s in place of a main gun. These upgraded variants remained in service into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;([[#References|Gelbart 1996:137-8]])&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of flexible [[anti-tank missile]]s, which were capable of installation on almost any vehicle in the 1960s, the concept of the tank destroyer has waned.  
With the weight of main battle tanks growing to the forty to seventy-tonne range, airborne forces were unable to deploy reasonable anti-tank forces. The result was a number of attempts to make a light vehicle, including the conventional [[ASU-85]], the recoilless rifle-armed [[Ontos]], and missile-armed [[Malkara missile#FV1620 Humber Hornet|Hornet Malkara]] armored car and [[M551 Sheridan|Sheridan]] light assault vehicle.

==Modern==
Many forces' [[IFV]]s carry [[anti-tank missile]] in every infantry platoon, and [[attack helicopter]]s have also added anti-tank capability to the modern battlefield. But there are still dedicated anti-tank vehicles with very heavy long-range missiles, and ones intended for [[Airborne forces|airborne]] use. 

[[Image:NM142 x 3.jpg|thumb|A Norwegian anti-tank platoon equipped with [[NM142]] TOW missile launchers]]
There have also been dedicated anti-tank vehicles built on ordinary [[armoured personnel carrier|armored personnel carrier]] or [[armored car (military)|armored car]] chassis. Examples include the U.S. [[M901 ITV|M901 ITV (Improved TOW Vehicle)]] and the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[NM142]], both on an [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]] chassis, several [[Soviet Army|Soviet]] ATGM launchers based on the [[BRDM]] reconnaissance car, the British [[FV438 Swingfire]] and [[FV102 Striker]] and the [[Germany|German]] [[Raketenjagdpanzer]] series built on the chassis of the [[HS 30]] and [[Marder (IFV)|Marder]] IFV.

A [[United States Army|US Army]] combined arms battalion has two infantry companies with TOW missile-armed [[M2 Bradley|Bradley IFVs]] and can bring a large concentration of accurate and lethal fire to bear on an attacking enemy unit that uses AFVs.

[[Image:Pzj Tow PIRANHA - Schweizer Armee - Steel Parade 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Mowag Piranha]]-based, [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-armed ATGM carrier of the [[Swiss Army]]]]
Missile carrying vehicles however are referred to as [[anti-tank missile]] carriers instead of tank destroyers.

Some gun-armed tank destroyers continue to be used. The [[People's Republic of China]] has developed the tracked [[Type 89 (Tank Destroyer)|PTZ89]] and the wheeled [[PTL02]] tank destroyers. PTZ89 is armed with a {{nowrap|120 mm}} smoothbore cannon while PTL02, developed by NORINCO for the PLA's new light (rapid reaction) mechanized infantry divisions, carries a {{nowrap|100 mm}} one (a version armed with a 105&amp;nbsp;mm rifled gun is available for export). PTL02 is built on the 6×6 wheeled chassis of the [[WZ551]] APC.

[[Italy]] and [[Spain]] use the Italian-built [[Centauro]], a wheeled tank destroyer with a {{nowrap|105 mm}} cannon. The gun-armed tank destroyer may possibly see revival in the US Army through the introduction of the [[Stryker]], more specifically, the [[Mobile Gun System|M1128 Mobile Gun System]], a Stryker variant armed with a {{nowrap|105 mm}} cannon which has remote control and autoloading capabilities. Originally, the Canadian Forces had considered replacing their aging [[Leopard 1]] tanks with the Stryker Mobile Gun System. But with the increased use of [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]] capable of destroying Strykers by insurgent forces, they opted instead to purchase the [[Leopard 2]] tank.

A military '''armored''' (or '''armoured''') '''car''' is a wheeled [[vehicle armour|armored]] vehicle, lighter than other [[armoured fighting vehicle|armored fighting vehicle]]s, primarily being armored and/or armed for self-defense of the occupants. Other multi-axled wheeled military vehicles can be quite large, and actually be superior to some smaller tracked vehicles in terms of armor and armament.

==History==
[[File:Charron Girardot Voigt 1902.jpg|thumb|French armored car: the [[Charron-Girardot-Voigt 1902]].]]
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a number of military armored vehicles were manufactured by adding armor and weapons to existing vehicles.  The first manufactured one was the &quot;[[Motor War Car]]&quot; in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=====World War I=====
Generally, the armored cars were used by more or less independent car commanders.  However, sometimes they were used in larger units up to squadron size.  The cars were primarily armed with light machine guns.  But larger units usually employed a few cars with heavier guns.  As air power became a factor, armored cars offered a mobile platform for anti-aircraft guns.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, ''Encyclopedia of Armored Cars'', pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rolls Royce 1920 Mk1 1 Bovington.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Rolls-Royce Armoured Car]] 1920 pattern]]&lt;!-- The spelling &quot;Armored Car&quot; is a proper noun here: do not change. --&gt;
In 1914, the Belgians fielded some early examples of armored cars during the ''[[Race to the Sea]]''. The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Naval Air Service]] dispatched aircraft to Dunkirk to defend the UK from Zeppelins. The officers cars followed them and these began to be used to rescue downed reconnaissance pilots in the battle areas. They mounted machine guns on them&lt;ref&gt;''Band of Brigands'' p 59&lt;/ref&gt; and as these excursions became increasingly dangerous, they improvised boiler plate armoring on the vehicles provided by a local shipbuilder. In London [[Murray Sueter]] ordered &quot;fighting cars&quot; based on Rolls-Royce, Talbot and Wolseley chassis. By the time [[Rolls-Royce Armoured Car|Rolls-Royce armored cars]] arrived in December 1914, the mobile period on the Western Front was already over.&lt;ref&gt;''First World War'' - Willmott, H.P., [[Dorling Kindersley]], 2003, Pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
{{-}}

=====World War II=====
[[Image:UStankParis-edit1.jpg|thumb|upright|American troops in an [[M8 Greyhound]] passing the [[Arc de Triomphe]] after the [[liberation of Paris]]
By the Second World War, there were different classes of armored car: at one end &quot;Light Reconnaisance&quot; or &quot;Scout&quot; cars used for scouting and liaison work between units and generally lightly armed such as the [[Daimler Dingo]] to, at the other, heavy armored cars with armament equivalent to that carried on tanks such as the 6 pounder armed [[AEC Armoured Car]].]]&lt;!-- The spelling &quot;Armored Car&quot; is a proper noun here: do not change. --&gt;

The British RAF in the [[Middle East]] was equipped with [[Rolls-Royce Armoured Car|Rolls Royce armored cars]] and Morris tenders. Some of these vehicles were among the last of a consignment of ex-[[Royal Navy]] armored cars that had been serving in the [[Middle East]] since 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, ''Iraq 1941'', pg. 40&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1940 a section of the No. 2 Squadron RAF Regiment Company was detached to [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|General Wavell’s ground]] forces during the first offensive against the Italians in Egypt. It is said{{By whom|date=July 2010}} that these armored cars became ‘the eyes and ears of Wavell’. During the actions in the October of that year the Company was employed on convoy escort tasks, airfield defense, fighting reconnaissance patrols and screening operations.

[[File:Fordson Armoured Car Iraq.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Rolls-Royce Armoured Car#Variants|Fordson armored car]] waits outside [[Baghdad]] while negotiations for an armistice take place between British officials and representatives of the Iraqi rebel government.]]

During the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]], some of the units located in the [[British Mandate of Palestine]]&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; were sent to Iraq and drove Fordson armored cars.&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, ''Iraq 1941'', pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Fordson&quot; armored cars were Rolls Royce armored cars which received new chassis from a [[Fordson]] truck in [[Egypt]].

The American [[M8 Greyhound|M8 Light Armored Car]] was a 6x6 armored car produced by the [[Ford Motor Company]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]] intended initially as a fast wheeled [[tank destroyer]]. Its design style and excellent cross-country performance earned it the nickname of 'Greyhound'.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} However, the small 37&amp;nbsp;mm gun would not be effective against the front armor of German tanks so as an armored car, designated M8 Light Armored Car, it was used for reconnaissance instead.&lt;ref name=Zaloga&gt;{{cite book |last=Zaloga|first=Steve |title=M8 Greyhound Light Armored Car|year=2002 |publisher=Osprey |isbn=1 841 76 468 X|page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its small 37&amp;nbsp;mm gun and light armor was seen as a flaw, but was produced in such a large volume and, coupled with its off-road capability, that this shortcoming was largely overlooked. The M8 Greyhound was a supportive element to the advancing American and British armored columns. It was used by the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] troops in [[Europe]] and the [[Far East]] until the end of the war.&lt;ref name=Zaloga&gt;{{cite book |last=Zaloga|first=Steve |title=M8 Greyhound Light Armored Car|year=2002 |publisher=Osprey |isbn=1 841 76 468 X|page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A military armored car is a type of [[armoured fighting vehicle|armored fighting vehicle]] having [[wheel]]s (from four to ten large, off-road wheels) instead of [[Caterpillar track|tracks]], and usually light [[vehicle armour|armor]]. Armored cars are typically less expensive and have better speed and range than tracked military vehicles. Most are not intended for heavy fighting; their normal use is for [[reconnaissance]], command, control, and communications, or for use against lightly armed insurgents or rioters. Only some are intended to enter close combat, often accompanying convoys to protect soft-skinned vehicles.

Light armored cars, such as the British [[Ferret armoured car|Ferret]] are armed with just a machine gun. Heavier vehicles are armed with [[autocannon]] or a small tank gun. The heaviest armored cars, such as the German, World War II era [[SdKfz 234]] or the modern, US [[M1128 Mobile Gun System]], mount the same guns that arm medium tanks.

[[Image:DanishResistanceAC2795.jpg|thumb|left||Vehicle built by railway shop workers for the [[Danish resistance movement]], near the end of World War II]]
Armored cars are popular for peacekeeping or internal security duties. Their appearance is less confrontational and threatening than tanks, and their size and maneuverability is more compatible with tight urban spaces designed for wheeled vehicles. They can also be much more easily air-deployed in [[cargo planes]].

Many modern forces now have their dedicated armored car designs, to exploit the advantages noted above. Examples would be the [[M1117 Armored Security Vehicle]] of the [[United States|USA]] or [[Alvis Saladin]] of the post-World War II era in the [[United Kingdom]].

Alternatively, civilian vehicles may be modified into improvised armored cars in ad-hoc fashion. Many militias and irregular forces adapt civilian vehicles into AFVs (armored fighting vehicles) and troop carriers, and in some regional conflicts these [[technical (fighting vehicle)|&quot;technicals&quot;]] are the only combat vehicles present. On occasion, even the soldiers of national militaries are forced to adapt their [[Gun truck|civilian-type vehicles]] for combat use, often using [[Improvised vehicle armour|improvised armor]] and scrounged weapons.

}}
An '''anti-aircraft vehicle''', also known as a '''self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon''' ('''SPAA''') or '''self-propelled air defense system''' ('''SPAD'''), is a mobile vehicle with a dedicated anti-aircraft capability. The [[Russian language|Russian]] equivalent of ''SPAAG'' is ''ZSU'', for ''zenitnaya samokhodnaya ustanovka'', (&quot;anti-aircraft self-propelled mount&quot;).

Specific weapon systems used include [[machine gun]]s, [[autocannon]]s, larger guns, or [[missile]]s, and some mount both guns and longer-ranged missiles. Platforms used include both [[truck]]s and heavier [[Armoured fighting vehicle|armored fighting vehicles]] such as [[armoured personnel carrier|APCs]] and [[tank]]s, which add protection from aircraft, artillery, and small arms fire for front line deployment.

Anti-aircraft guns are usually mounted in a quickly-traversing [[gun turret|turret]] with a high rate of elevation, for tracking fast-moving aircraft. They are often in dual or quadruple mounts, allowing a high rate of fire. Today, [[missile]]s (generally mounted on similar turrets) have largely supplanted anti-aircraft guns.

==History==
[[Image:3inch20cwtAAgunPeerlessLorryWWIQuality90.jpg|thumb|right|A World War 1, British, truck–mounted , QF 3 inch gun ]]
===First World War===
Anti-aircraft machine guns have long been mounted on trucks, and these were quite common during [[World War I]]. A predecessor of the WW2 German &quot;88&quot; anti-aircraft gun, the WWI German 77&amp;nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, was truck-mounted and used to great effect against British tanks.

The British [[QF 3 inch 20 cwt]] was mounted on trucks for use on the Western front.

===Between wars===
Between the wars the British developed the [[Birch gun]], a general purpose artillery piece on an armoured tracked chassis capable of maintaining formation with their current tanks. The gun could be elevated for anti-aircraft use.

Among early pre-war pioneers of self-propelled AA guns were the Germans. By the time of the war, they fielded the SdKfz 10/4 and 6/2, cargo halftracks mounting single 20&amp;nbsp;mm or 37&amp;nbsp;mm AA guns (respectively). Later in the war similar German halftracks mounted quadruple 20&amp;nbsp;mm weapons.

===Second World War===
Larger guns followed on larger trucks, but these mountings generally required off-truck setup in order to unlimber the stabilizing legs these guns needed. One exception to this rule was the Italian [[Cannone da 90/53]] which was highly effective when mounted on trucks, a fit known as the &quot;''autocannoni da 90/53''&quot;. The 90/53 was a feared weapon, notably in the anti-tank role, but only a few hundred had been produced by the time of the armistice in 1943.

Other nations tended to work on truck chassis. Starting in 1941, the British developed the &quot;en [[portee]]&quot; method of mounting an anti-tank gun (initially a [[2 pounder]]) on a truck. This was to prevent the weapon from being damaged by long-distance towing across rough, stony deserts, and it was intended only to be a carrying method, with the gun unloaded for firing. However, crews tended to fire their weapons from their vehicles for the mobility this method provided, with consequent casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;avalon&quot;&gt;Advanced Squad Leader, Avalon Hill Game Company&lt;/ref&gt;  
This undoubtedly inspired their Morris C9/B (officially the &quot;Carrier, SP, 4x4, 40 mm AA&quot;), a Bofors 40&amp;nbsp;mm AA gun mounted on a chassis derived from the [[Morris C8|Morris &quot;Quad&quot;]] Field Artillery Tractor truck.&lt;ref name=&quot;avalon&quot; /&gt; Similar types, based on 3-ton lorries, were produced in Britain, Canada and Australia, and together formed the most numerous self-propelled AA guns in British service.&lt;ref name=&quot;avalon&quot; /&gt;

The U.S. Army brought truck-towed [[Bofors 40 mm]] AA guns along with truck-mounted units fitted with mechanized turrets when they sailed, first for Great Britain and then onto France.  The turrets carried four .50&amp;nbsp;inch (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns, which were designed to be adjusted to converge at the single point where enemy aircraft were expected to appear at low altitude in conduction of strafing runs directed at large infantry and field artillery units. 

Interest in mobile AA turned to heavier vehicles with the mass and stability needed to easily train weapons of all sizes. Probably the desire, particularly in German service, for anti-aircraft vehicles to be armoured for their own protection also assisted this trend.

The concept of an armored SPAAG was pioneered by [[Hungary]] during [[World War II]] [[Hungary]] by producing the [[40M Nimrod]] based on the [[Luftvärnskanonvagn L-62 Anti II]] license acquired from [[Sweden]]. 
[[Germany]] followed later with their &quot;''flakpanzer''&quot; series. German World War II SPAAGs include the [[Möbelwagen]], [[Wirbelwind]], [[Ostwind]] and [[Kugelblitz]]. Other forces followed with designs of their own, notably the American M16 created by mounting quadruple [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 machine guns]] on a [[M3 Half-track]].

The British developed their own SPAAGs throughout the war mounting multiple machine guns and light cannon on various tank and armoured car chassis and by 1943, the [[Crusader tank|Crusader AA tanks]], which mounted the [[Bofors 40 mm]] gun or two-three [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]]. Although used during the Normandy landings, by that point German aircraft were contained by the Allies own air forces and they were largely unneeded.

===Cold war and later===
[[Image:PZA Loara zdjecie 489 5980.jpg|thumb|[[PZA Loara]], [[Poland]]]]
On occasion SPAAGs have been used as very effective direct fire weapons against infantry, for example by American forces during late World War II, in Korea against mass infantry assault, and extensively during the [[Vietnam War]], where for example the U.S. [[M42 Duster]] SPAAG (based on a light tank) was employed purely for this purpose. Nowadays the system is rather superfluous due to the lack of a threat from sophisticated gunship helicopters, but development continues{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Modern weapons include the [[Russia]]n [[ZSU-23-4|ZSU-23-4 Shilka]] and [[Tunguska-M1]], [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[Type 95 SPAAA]], [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Combat Vehicle 90|CV9040 AAV]], Polish [[PZA Loara]], American [[M2/M3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle#M6 Linebacker|M6 Bradley Linebacker]] and [[M1097 Avenger|M1097 Humvee Avenger]], [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] [[BOV (APC)|BOV-3]], Canadian [[Air Defense Anti-Tank System|ADATS]], aging [[Germany|German]] [[Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer Gepard|Gepard]], Japanese [[Type 87 Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun|Type 87 SPAAG]] and similar versions with the British [[Marksman anti-aircraft system|Marksman turret]] (which was also adapted for a number of other users), [[Italy|Italian]] [[SIDAM 25]] and [[Otomatic]], and versions of the [[France|French]] [[AMX-13]]. Older post-war examples include the [[ZSU-57-2]], [[M163 VADS]] (mounting the [[Vulcan cannon]]) and failed [[M247 Sergeant York]].

'''AZ''', an initialism for '''[[Alkmaar]] [[Zaanstreek]]''', is an [[association football]] club from the city of [[Alkmaar]], [[Netherlands]]. The club plays in the [[Eredivisie]], the highest [[association football|football]] league in the Netherlands. AZ was founded in 1967 as ''AZ '67''. The name was changed into '''AZ''' in July 1986; internationally, the [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]] ''AZ Alkmaar'' is often used.

==History==
AZ was founded on 10 May 1967 as '''AZ '67''', the result of a merger of '''Alkmaar '54''' and '''FC Zaanstreek'''. FC Zaanstreek was formed in 1964, continuing the professional adventure of the [[Koog aan de Zaan|Kooger]] Football Club ('''[[:nl:KFC (voetbalclub)|KFC]]'''). KFC had been founded in 1910, had nearly  become National Champion in 1934 through a narrow loss to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in the finals, and had been professional since 1955.

In 1964, the brothers Cees and Klaas Molenaar, former players for KFC and owners of a growing appliance store chain, sought to create a powerful football team in the Zaanstreek by merging the two local professional teams (KFC and [[:nl:ZFC|ZFC]]). After this merger failed, they successfully merged KFC (now &quot;FC Zaanstreek&quot;) with Alkmaar '54, though the team would be located in Alkmaar. Partially through the hiring of expensive foreign player, the new club soon acquired large debts. Fortunately in 1972 the brothers Molenaar bailed it out and invested heavily in the club, to the point that AZ '67 were successful in the late seventies and early eighties. In 1981, they became [[Eredivisie|Dutch champions]] and [[UEFA Cup]] finalists. Things went downhill after the Molenaar brothers left the club. In 1988, AZ were relegated from the [[Eredivisie]].

The involvement of businessman Dirk Scheringa in the mid-'90s marked the revival of the club. AZ returned to the [[Eredivisie]] in 1998. In 2004–05, they reappeared in the [[UEFA Cup]] tournament, advancing to the semi-finals. They also finished third in the Eredivisie that season, again qualifying for the UEFA Cup, after spending most of the season in the top two spots. A remarkable achievement, since AZ is financially not a big club and it does not have a similar fanbase like their Eredivisie rivals: AZ's home ground in the 2005–06 season, the [[Alkmaarderhout]], had a spectator capacity of 8,390.

AZ were undefeated in all 32 of their home matches in European competitions, a sequence which ran from 1977 until 20 December 2007, when they finally lost to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] of [[Premier League|England]] by a score of 3–2.

In the summer of 2006, the club moved to a new 17,000 capacity stadium [[AZ Stadion]]. Club's chairman Dirk Scheringa stated in 2007 that he wished to expand the stadium capacity to 40,000 by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.az.nl/index.php?module=news&amp;articleID=21316 |title=We want to win trophies |publisher=AZ |date=2007-08-09 |accessdate=2007-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the club began plans to expand the stadium to at least 30,000 seats by 2011–12.

AZ had a very good 2006–07 season, which ended, however, in disaster. Going into the last game of the 2006–07 season, AZ led [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] by goal-differential for the [[Eredivisie]] championship, but ended up third after losing this last match against bottom-dweller [[Excelsior Rotterdam|Excelsior]], playing with 10 men for 80 minutes. Further setbacks followed when AZ lost the [[KNVB Cup]] finals to Ajax, 8–7 in penalty kicks after a drawn game, and also lost to Ajax over two playoff games for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. After the season, key players like [[Tim de Cler]], [[Danny Koevermans]], and [[Shota Arveladze]] left the team.

[[File:AZ Larisa UEFA Cup0708.jpg|thumb|left|220px|AZ versus [[Larissa F.C.|Larissa]] in a [[2007–08 UEFA Cup]] match.]]
In the 2007–08 season, AZ performed so badly (first round loss in the KNVB Cup, elimination from the UEFA Cup before winter break and a final 11th position in the Eredivisie), that team manager [[Louis van Gaal]] felt obliged to hand in his resignation in March 2008. However, after protests from the players and direction, van Gaal withdrew his resignation to finish his contractual obligations.

The 2008–09 season had an unpromising start with two defeats against [[NAC Breda]] and [[ADO Den Haag]]. However, starting with a 1–0 victory over defending league champions PSV, the team didn't lose in the next 28 matches, including a stretch of 11 matches in which the opposing teams did not score a single goal. Three weeks before the end of the season, despite their second home defeat of the season (against [[Vitesse]]), AZ became [[Eredivisie]] champions when nearest rivals [[FC Twente|Twente]] and Ajax both lost their matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5j2aUlWUBM9Jzk4D7Amr-0THfFDpg |accessdate=2009-04-19 |date=2009-04-18 |title=AZ Alkmaar loses 2–1 to Vitesse in Dutch soccer league Saturday |publisher=The Canadian Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5iRdPaZUa1Ug7nV9ZOHEJrKv5cO0w |accessdate=2009-04-19 |date=2009-04-19 |title=AZ Alkmaar wins Dutch First Division soccer title after PSV downs Ajax|publisher=The Canadian Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; AZ's second championship was the first Eredivisie title in 28 years, and the first time since then that  the Eredivisie was won by a team other than the &quot;big three&quot; (Ajax, PSV and [[Feyenoord]]). AZ therefore qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the first time in their history, but only took four points from six matches and finished bottom of their group.

[[Ronald Koeman]], succeeded [[Louis van Gaal]] after the 2008–09 season. Van Gaal had already left for [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] after becoming league champions with AZ. Koeman became the manager for AZ on 17 May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/sow/news?slug=reu-dutchalkmaarkoeman&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns|title=Koeman takes over from Van Gaal at AZ Alkmaar |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-05-17 |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 5, 2009 AZ announced that Koeman no longer was in charge of AZ, after losing 7 of the first 16 games in the Dutch competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transfermarkt.de/de/news/33522/alkmaar-entlaesst-koeman.html Alkmaar entlässt Koeman]&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Zenit St. Petersburg]] manager [[Dick Advocaat]] took over for the rest of the season. Under his lead, some good results were achieved and European football was secured. For the 2010–2011 season, [[Gertjan Verbeek]], coming from [[Heracles Almelo]], will be the new manager.

==Stadium and sponsor==
{{See also|AZ Stadion}}

[[File:DSB-Stadion.jpg|250px|right|thumb|DSB Stadion, AZ's home venue in Alkmaar]]

AZ play their home games at the [[AZ Stadion]], located in the southern part of the city of [[Alkmaar]]. The stadium, which is owned directly by the club, was inaugurated in 2006 and replaced the old [[Alkmaarderhout]] venue. The stadium currently has a capacity of 17,023.

In order to further grow the club's budget, the AZ board of directors decided to extend the capacity of the new stadium to a minimum of 30,000 seated spectators. The extension will be realised to construct a second tier to three of the four stands. The main stand with all technical areas, VIP and sponsor and media facilities will remain in place. The club plans to start construction in the third quarter of 2010 in order for the stadium to be commissioned in time for the 2011–12 season.

In October 2009 sponsor [[DSB Bank]] was declared [[bankrupt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/community_focus/Court-gives-Dutch-bank-DSB-last-chance-to-find-a-buyer_57311.html &quot;Court gives Dutch bank DSB last chance to find a buyer&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/community_focus/Court-declares-Dutch-bank-DSB-bankrupt_57382.html &quot;Court declares Dutch bank DSB bankrupt&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/local_news/DSB-mother-company-declared-bankrupt_57487.html &quot;DSB mother company declared bankrupt&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
The stadium name changed from DSB Stadion to AZ Stadion, as it was considered undesirable that the stadium was linked with a non-existent bank. In February 2010 a new main sponsor was found: construction works service provider BUKO from [[Beverwijk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/dutch-rss-news/new-sponsor-for-az_22937.html &quot;New sponsor for AZ&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mammal]]s, the '''adrenal glands''' (also known as '''suprarenal glands''') are [[endocrine gland]]s that sit atop the [[kidney]]s; in humans, the right suprarenal gland is triangular shaped, while the left suprarenal gland is semilunar shaped. They are chiefly responsible for releasing [[hormone]]s in response to [[stress (medicine)|stress]] through the [[biosynthesis|synthesis]] of [[corticosteroid]]s such as [[cortisol]] and [[catecholamine]]s such as epinephrine. The adrenal glands affect kidney function through the secretion of [[aldosterone]], a hormone involved in regulating the [[osmolarity]] of [[blood plasma]].

==Anatomy and function==
Anatomically,  the adrenal glands are located in the [[retroperitoneum]] situated atop the [[kidney]]s, one on each side. They are surrounded by an [[adipose capsule]] and [[renal fascia]]. In humans, the adrenal glands are found at the level of the 12th [[thoracic vertebra]]. Each adrenal gland has two distinct structures, the [[adrenal cortex]] and the [[adrenal medulla|medulla]], both of which produce hormones. The cortex mainly produces [[cortisol]], [[aldosterone]] and [[androgen]]s, while the medulla chiefly produces [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]]. The combined weight of the adrenal glands in an adult human ranges from 7 to 10&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.lww.com/obgynsurvey/Citation/1972/01000/Reinfection_With_Rubella_in_Pregnant_Women.4.aspx Page 18] in: {{cite journal |author=Boué A, Nicolas A, Montagnon B |title=Reinfection with rubella in pregnant women |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=7712 |pages=1251–3 |year=1971 |month=June |pmid=4104713 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cortex===
The [[adrenal cortex]] is devoted to the synthesis of [[corticosteroid]] [[hormones]]. Specific cortical cells produce particular hormones including [[cortisol]], [[corticosterone]], [[androgen]]s such as [[testosterone]], and [[aldosterone]].  Under normal unstressed conditions, the human adrenal glands produce the equivalent of 35–40&amp;nbsp;mg of cortisone acetate per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;safeuses&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Jefferies, William McK |title=Safe uses of cortisol |publisher=Charles C. Thomas |location=Springfield, Ill |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-398-07500-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the direct innervation of the medulla, the cortex is regulated by [[neuroendocrine]] hormones secreted by the [[pituitary gland]] and [[hypothalamus]], as well as by the [[renin-angiotensin system]].

The adrenal cortex comprises three zones, or layers. This ''anatomic zonation'' can be appreciated at the microscopic level, where each zone can be recognized and distinguished from one another based on structural and anatomic characteristics.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehead&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Whitehead, Saffron A.; Nussey, Stephen |title=Endocrinology: an integrated approach |publisher=BIOS |location=Oxford |year=2001 |pages=122 |isbn=1-85996-252-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adrenal cortex exhibits ''functional zonation'' as well: by virtue of the characteristic enzymes present in each zone, the zones produce and secrete distinct hormones.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehead&quot;/&gt;

;Zona glomerulosa (outer)
:The outermost layer, the [[zona glomerulosa]] is the main site for production of [[mineralocorticoid]]s, mainly [[aldosterone]], which is largely responsible for the long-term [[regulation of blood pressure]].
;Zona fasciculata
:Situated between the glomerulosa and reticularis, the [[zona fasciculata]] is responsible for producing [[glucocorticoid]]s, chiefly [[cortisol]] in humans.  The zona fasciculata secretes a basal level of cortisol but can also produce bursts of the hormone in response to [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) from the [[anterior pituitary]].
;Zona reticularis
:The inner most cortical layer, the [[zona reticularis]] produces [[androgen]]s, mainly [[dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA) and [[DHEA sulfate]] (DHEA-S) in humans.

===Medulla===
The [[adrenal medulla]] is the core of the adrenal gland, and is surrounded by the adrenal cortex. The [[chromaffin cell]]s of the medulla, named for their characteristic brown staining with [[chromic acid]] salts, are the body's main source of the circulating [[catecholamine]]s [[adrenaline]] (epinephrine) and [[noradrenaline]] (norepinephrine). Derived from the amino acid [[tyrosine]], these water-soluble hormones are major hormones underlying the [[fight-or-flight response]].

To carry out its part of this response, the adrenal medulla receives input from the [[sympathetic nervous system]] through [[preganglionic fiber]]s originating in the [[thoracic spinal cord]] from T5–T11.&lt;ref name=&quot;essentialneuroscience&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Sapru, Hreday N.; Siegel, Allan |title=Essential Neuroscience |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-9121-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is innervated by preganglionic nerve fibers, the adrenal medulla can be considered as a specialized [[sympathetic ganglion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;essentialneuroscience&quot;/&gt; Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.

Cortisol also promotes epinephrine synthesis in the medulla. Produced in the cortex, cortisol reaches the adrenal medulla and at high levels, the hormone can promote the upregulation of [[phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase|phenylethanolamine ''N''-methyltransferase]] (PNMT), thereby increasing epinephrine synthesis and secretion.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehead&quot;/&gt;

===Blood supply===
Although variations of the blood supply to the adrenal glands (and indeed the kidneys themselves) are common, there are usually three arteries that supply each adrenal gland:
* The [[superior suprarenal artery]] is provided by the [[inferior phrenic arteries|inferior phrenic artery]]
* The [[middle suprarenal artery]] is provided by the [[abdominal aorta]]
* The [[inferior suprarenal artery]] is provided by the [[renal artery]]

[[Venous]] drainage of the adrenal glands is achieved via the [[suprarenal veins]]:
* The [[right suprarenal vein]] drains into the [[inferior vena cava]]
* The [[left suprarenal vein]] drains into the left [[renal vein]] or the left [[inferior phrenic vein]].

The [[suprarenal veins]] may form [[anastomoses]] with the [[inferior phrenic veins]].

The adrenal glands and the [[thyroid gland]] are the organs that have the greatest blood supply per gram of tissue. Up to 60 [[arterioles]] may enter each adrenal gland.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn960-399-074-4&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Mirilas P, Skandalakis JE, Colborn GL, Weidman TA, Foster RS, Kingsnorth A, Skandalakis LJ, Skandalakis PN |title=Surgical Anatomy: The Embryologic And Anatomic Basis Of Modern Surgery |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional Publishing |location= |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=960-399-074-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be one of the reasons lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the adrenals.

==Terminology==
The adrenal glands are named for their location relative to the kidneys. The term &quot;adrenal&quot; comes from ''ad-'' (Latin, &quot;near&quot;) and ''renes'' (Latin, &quot;kidney&quot;). Similarly, &quot;suprarenal&quot; is derived from ''supra-'' (Latin, &quot;above&quot;) and ''renes''..

'''American Media, Inc.''', is a publisher of a number of major [[United States]]-based magazines and [[supermarket tabloid]]s.

==Company background==
The modern American Media came into being after [[Generoso Pope, Jr.]], longtime owner of ''[[The National Enquirer]]'', died in 1988, and his tabloids came under new ownership. American tabloids began consolidating in 1990, when American Media bought ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]'' from Rupert Murdoch. The purchase of Globe Communications (owner of the ''[[Globe (tabloid)|Globe]]'' and the ''[[National Examiner]]'') followed nine years later.

American Media's corporate headquarters in [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]], [[Florida]], figured prominently in news headlines in late 2001, after an [[2001 anthrax attacks|anthrax attack]] was perpetrated on the company. Since then the corporate headquarters have moved to [[New York City]] at 1 Park Avenue in [[Manhattan]]. The [[CEO]], [[David J. Pecker]], now travels between the Boca Raton and New York office while managing the company.

American Media also owns [[Distribution Services, Inc.]], an in-store magazine merchandising company. 

[[Roger Altman]], through [[Evercore Partners]], bought a controlling stake in American Media in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1007/The_Clintonite_who_owns_National_Enquirer.html The Clintonite who owns National Enquirer] Ben Smith, ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]'', October 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, American Media was taken over by its bondholders to keep it out of bankruptcy.

In November 2010, American Media filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection due to nearly $1 billion in debt, and assets of less than $50,000. Its subsidiary, American Media Operations Inc., listed assets of $100 to $500 million and debt of over $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='National Enquirer' Publisher Files for Chapter 11|publisher=Bloomberg Bussinessweek|date=17 November 2010|accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It exited in December.

'''Aramaic''' is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]] belonging to the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] [[language family]]. The name of the language is based on the name of [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]],&lt;ref&gt;oxford english dictionary, http://oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/10127&lt;/ref&gt; an ancient region in central [[Syria]].  Within this family, Aramaic belongs to the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] subfamily, and more specifically, is a part of the [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] group of languages, which also includes [[Canaanite languages]] such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]].  [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic script]] was widely adopted for other languages and is ancestral to both the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew alphabet|modern Hebrew]] alphabets.

During its 3,000-year history,&lt;ref&gt;Aramaic appears somewhere between 11th and 9th centuries BCE. Beyer (1986: 11) suggests that written Aramaic probably dates from the 11th century BCE, as it is established by the 10th century, to which he dates the oldest inscriptions of northern Syria. Heinrichs (1990: x) uses the less controversial date of 9th century, for which there is clear and widespread attestation.&lt;/ref&gt; Aramaic has served variously as a language of administration of empires and as a language of divine worship.  It was the day-to-day language of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah#Second Temple|Israel in the Second Temple period]] (539 [[BCE]] &amp;ndash; 70 CE), was the original language of large sections of the [[Bible|biblical]] books of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]], was the [[Aramaic of Jesus|language spoken]] by [[Jesus]], and is the main language of the [[Talmud]].&lt;ref&gt;Beyer 1986: 38–43; Casey 1998: 83–6, 88, 89–93; Eerdmans 1975: 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aramaic's long history and diverse and widespread use has led to the development of many divergent varieties which are sometimes treated as ''[[dialect]]s''. Therefore, there is no one singular Aramaic language, but each time and place has had its own variation. Aramaic is retained as a liturgical language by certain Eastern Christian churches, in the form of [[Syriac language|Syriac]], the Aramaic variety by which [[Eastern Christianity]] was diffused, whether or not those communities once spoke it or another form of Aramaic as their [[vernacular]], but have since shifted to another language as their primary community language.

[[Neo-Aramaic languages|Modern Aramaic]] is spoken today as a first language by many scattered, predominantly small, and largely isolated communities of differing [[Christian]], [[Jew]]ish and [[Mandean]] groups of [[West Asia]]&lt;ref&gt;Heinrichs 1990: xi–xv; Beyer 1986: 53.&lt;/ref&gt;—most numerously by the [[Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac people|Assyrians]] (also known as [[Chaldo-Assyrians]]) in the form of [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] —that have all retained use of the once dominant [[lingua franca]] despite subsequent [[language shift]]s experienced throughout the [[Middle East]]. The Aramaic languages are considered to be [[endangered language|endangered]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Naby|first=Eden|publisher=Assyrian International News Agency|title=From Lingua Franca to Endangered Language|accessdate=2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
During the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] and the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] period, [[Aramaeans]], the native speakers of Aramaic, began to settle in greater numbers in Upper [[Mesopotamia]] (modern-day northern [[Iraq]], northeast [[Syria]], northwest [[Iran]],  and south eastern [[Turkey]]).&lt;ref name=Richardp69/&gt; The influx eventually resulted in the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] and [[Chaldean Dynasty]] of [[Babylonia]] becoming operationally [[Multilingualism|bilingual]] in written sources, with Aramaic used alongside [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. As these empires, and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] that followed, extended their influence in the region, Aramaic gradually became the [[lingua franca]] of most of Western Asia and Egypt.&lt;ref name=Richardp69&gt;Richard, 2003, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 7th century CE onwards, Aramaic was gradually replaced as the lingua franca of the [[Middle East]] by [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. However, Aramaic remains a spoken, literary and liturgical language among [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christians,  [[Jews]], [[Mandaeism|Mandaeans]] and some [[Syriac]]/[[Aramean]] Christians, and is still spoken by small isolated communities throughout its original area of influence, predominantly in northwest [[Iraq]], northeast [[Syria]], southeast [[Turkey]] and northern [[Iran]], with diaspora communities in [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and southern [[Russia]]. The turbulence of the last two centuries (particularly the [[Assyrian Genocide]]) has seen speakers of first-language and literary Aramaic dispersed throughout the world.

===Aramaic languages and dialects===
Traditionally, Aramaic is considered a single language. However, it could equally well be considered a group of closely related languages, rather than a single monolithic language—something which it has never been. Its long history, extensive literature, and use by different religious communities are all factors in the diversification of the language. Some Aramaic dialects are mutually intelligible, whereas others are not. Some Aramaic languages are known under different names; for example, ''[[Syriac language|Syriac]]'' is particularly used to describe the Eastern Aramaic of Christian ethnic communities in Iraq, southeastern Turkey northern Syria and northwest Iran. Most dialects can be described as either &quot;Eastern&quot;' or &quot;Western&quot;, the dividing line being roughly the [[Euphrates]], or slightly west of it. A kind of high Aramaic [[Standard Aramaic]] survived till the 9th century. It is also helpful to draw a distinction between those Aramaic languages that are modern living languages (often called ''Neo-Aramaic''), those that are still in use as literary languages, and those that are extinct and are only of interest to scholars. Although there are some exceptions to this rule, this classification gives &quot;Modern&quot;, &quot;Middle&quot; and &quot;Old&quot; periods, alongside &quot;Eastern&quot; and &quot;Western&quot; areas, to distinguish between the various languages and dialects that are Aramaic.

==Writing system==
{{Main|Aramaic alphabet}}
[[Image:Syriac Sertâ book script.jpg|left|thumb|11th century book in [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac Serto]]]]
The earliest Aramaic alphabet was based on the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician script]]. In time, Aramaic developed its distinctive 'square' style. The ancient Israelites and other peoples of [[Canaan]] adopted this alphabet for writing their own languages. Thus, it is better known as the [[Hebrew alphabet]] today. This is the writing system used in [[Biblical Aramaic]] and other Jewish writing in Aramaic. The other main writing system used for Aramaic was developed by Christian communities: a cursive form known as the [[Syriac alphabet]] (one of the varieties of the Syriac alphabet, Serto, is shown to the left). A highly modified form of the Aramaic alphabet, the [[Mandaic alphabet]], is used by the [[Mandaeism|Mandaeans]].

In addition to these writing systems, certain derivatives of the Aramaic alphabet were used in ancient times by particular groups: [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean]] in [[Petra]], for instance and [[Palmyrene]]an in [[Palmyra]]. In modern times, [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]] (see [[#Modern Eastern Aramaic|below]]) has sometimes been written in an adapted [[Latin alphabet]].

The history of Aramaic is broken down into three broad periods:
* [[#Old Aramaic|Old Aramaic]] (1100 BCE–200 CE), including:
** The [[Biblical Aramaic]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]].
** The [[Aramaic of Jesus]].
* [[#Middle Aramaic|Middle Aramaic]] (200–1200), including:
** Literary [[Syriac language|Syriac]].
** The Aramaic of the [[Talmud]]s, [[Targum]]im, and [[Midrash]]im.
** [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]].
* [[#Modern Aramaic|Modern Aramaic]] (1200–present), including:
** Various modern vernaculars.

This classification is based on that used by Klaus Beyer[[#References|*]].

==Old Aramaic==
The term ‘Old Aramaic’ is used to describe the varieties of the language from its first known use until the point roughly marked by the rise of the [[Sasanian Empire]] (224 CE), dominating the influential, eastern dialect region. As such, the term covers over thirteen centuries of the development of Aramaic. This vast time span includes all Aramaic that is now effectively extinct.

The central phase in the development of Old Aramaic was its official use by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (500–330 BCE). The period before this, dubbed ‘Ancient Aramaic’, saw the development of the language from being spoken in Aramaean city-states to become a major means of communication in diplomacy and trade throughout [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]. After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, local vernaculars became increasingly prominent, fanning the divergence of an Aramaic [[dialect continuum]] and the development of differing written standards.

===Ancient Aramaic===
‘Ancient Aramaic’ refers to the earliest known period of the language, from its origin until it becomes the lingua franca of the [[Fertile Crescent]]. It was the language of the [[Aramaeans|Aramaean]] city-states of [[Damascus]], [[Hama]]th and [[Arpad (Syria)|Arpad]].

There are inscriptions that evidence the earliest use of the language, dating from the 10th century BCE. These inscriptions are mostly diplomatic documents between Aramaean city-states. The orthography of Aramaic at this early period seems to be based on [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], and there is a unity in the written language. It seems that, in time, a more refined orthography, suited to the needs of the language, began to develop from this in the eastern regions of Aram. Oddly, the dominance of [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] Empire under [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] over [[Aram Damascus|Aram]] in the middle of the 8th century led to the establishment of Aramaic as a [[lingua franca]] of the empire, rather than it being eclipsed by [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]].

From 700 BCE, the language began to spread in all directions, but lost much of its homogeneity. Different dialects emerged in [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]], the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]. However, the [[Akkadian]]-influenced Aramaic of Assyria, and then [[Babylon]], started to come to the fore. As described in [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 18:26, [[Hezekiah]], king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], negotiates with Assyrian ambassadors in Aramaic so that the common people would not understand. Around 600 BCE, Adon, a [[Canaan]]ite king, used Aramaic to write to the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]].

‘Chaldee’ or ‘Chaldean Aramaic’ used to be common terms for the Aramaic of the Chaldean dynasty of [[Babylonia]]. It was used to describe [[Biblical Aramaic]], which was, however, written in a later style. It is not to be confused with the modern language [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]].

===Imperial Aramaic===
{{Aramaeans}}
Around 500 BCE, following the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] conquest of Mesopotamia under [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]], Aramaic (as had been used in that region) was adopted by the conquerors as the &quot;vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast empire with its different peoples and languages. The use of a single official language, which modern scholarship has dubbed Official Aramaic or Imperial Aramaic, can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the Achaemenids in holding their far-flung empire together for as long as they did&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica|volume=2|year=1987|title=Aramaic&lt;!-- pp 250–261 --&gt;&lt;!-- section:Aramaic in the Achaemenid Empire pp 251–252--&gt;|last=Shaked|first=Saul|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=New York|pages=250–261}} p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Richard Frye questioned the classification of Imperial Aramaic as an 'official language', noting that no surviving edict expressly and unambiguously accorded that status to any particular language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frye|first=Richard N.|title=Review of G. R. Driver's &quot;Aramaic Documents of the Fifth Century B. C.&quot;|journal=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies|volume=18|issue=3/4|year=1955|pages=456–461|doi=10.2307/2718444|last2=Driver|first2=G. R.|url=http://jstor.org/stable/2718444}} p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt; Frye reclassifies Imperial Aramaic as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Achaemenid territories, suggesting then that the Achaemenid-era use of Aramaic was more pervasive than generally thought.

Imperial Aramaic was highly standardised; its orthography was based more on historical roots than any spoken dialect, and the inevitable influence of [[Persian language|Persian]] gave the language a new clarity and robust flexibility. For centuries after the fall of the Achaemenid Empire (in 331 BCE), Imperial Aramaic&amp;nbsp;– or near enough for it to be recognisable&amp;nbsp;– would remain an influence on the various native [[Iranian languages]]. Aramaic script and&amp;nbsp;– as ideograms&amp;nbsp;– Aramaic vocabulary would survive as the essential characteristics of the [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi writing system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1-link=Wilhelm Geiger|first1=Wilhelm|last1=Geiger|first2=Ernst|last2=Kuhn|year=2002|title=Grundriss der iranischen Philologie: Band I. Abteilung 1|location=Boston|publisher=Adamant|pages=249ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest collections of Imperial Aramaic texts is that of the [[Persepolis]] fortification tablets, which number about five hundred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=John A. Matthew|last=Stolper|title=What are the Persepolis Fortiﬁcation Tablets?|journal=The Oriental Studies News &amp; Notes|issue=winter|year=2007|pages=6–9|url=http://persepolistablets.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-are-persepolis-fortication.html|accessdate=2007-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the extant documents witnessing to this form of Aramaic come from [[Egypt]], and [[Elephantine]] in particular (see [[Elephantine papyri]]). Of them, the best known is the ''Wisdom of [[Ahiqar]]'', a book of instructive aphorisms quite similar in style to the biblical [[book of Proverbs]]. Achaemenid Aramaic is sufficiently uniform that it is often difficult to know where any particular example of the language was written. Only careful examination reveals the occasional loan word from a local language.

A group of thirty Aramaic documents from [[Bactria]] have been discovered, And an analysis was published in November 2006. The texts, which were rendered on leather, reflect the use of Aramaic in the 4th century BCE Achaemenid administration of Bactria and [[Sogdiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Aramaic Documents from Bactria|series=Studies in the Khalili Collection|last1=Naveh|first1=Joseph|last2=Shaked|first2=Shaul|isbn=1-874-78074-9|publisher=Khalili Collections|location=Oxford|year=2006|author=ed. by Joseph Naveh ....}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Achaemenid Aramaic===
[[Image:Alexander Aramaic coin.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Alexander the Great]] bearing an Aramaic language inscription.]]
[[Image:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|Bilingual inscription (Greek and Aramaic) by the Indian king [[Ashoka the Great|Ashoka]], 3rd century BCE]]
[[Image:Targum.jpg|right|thumb|11th century [[Hebrew Bible]] with [[Targum]]]]
The conquest by [[Alexander the Great]] did not destroy the unity of Aramaic language and literature immediately. Aramaic that bears a relatively close resemblance to that of the 5th century BCE can be found right up to the early 2nd century BCE. The [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] imposed [[Greek language|Greek]] in the administration of [[Syria]] and [[Mesopotamia]] from the start of their rule. In the 3rd century BCE, Greek overtook Aramaic as the common language in Egypt and Syria. However, a post-Achaemenid Aramaic continued to flourish from [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]], Assyria, Mesopotamia, through the Syrian Desert and into northern [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] and [[Parthia]].

[[Biblical Aramaic]] is the Aramaic found in four discrete sections of the [[Hebrew Bible]]:
* [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 4:8–6:18 and 7:12–26&amp;nbsp;– documents from the Achaemenid period (5th century BCE) concerning the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem.
* [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 2:4b–7:28&amp;nbsp;– five subversive tales and an apocalyptic vision.
* [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 10:11&amp;nbsp;– a single sentence in the middle of a Hebrew text denouncing idolatry.
* [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 31:47&amp;nbsp;– translation of a Hebrew place-name.
Biblical Aramaic is a somewhat hybrid dialect. Some Biblical Aramaic material probably originated in both Babylonia and Judaea before the fall of the Achaemenid dynasty. During [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] rule, defiant Jewish propaganda shaped Aramaic [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]]. These stories probably existed as oral traditions at their earliest stage. This might be one factor that led to differing collections of Daniel in the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Septuagint]] and the [[Masoretic Text]], which presents a lightly [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]-influenced Aramaic.

Under the category of post-Achaemenid is Hasmonaean Aramaic, the official language of [[Hasmonean|Hasmonaean]] Judaea (142–37 BCE). It influenced the Biblical Aramaic of the [[Qumran]] texts, and was the main language of non-biblical theological texts of that community. The major [[Targum]]s, translations of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic, were originally composed in Hasmonaean. Hasmonaean also appears in quotations in the [[Mishnah]] and [[Tosefta]], although smoothed into its later context. It is written quite differently from Achaemenid Aramaic; there is an emphasis on writing as words are pronounced rather than using etymological forms.

Babylonian [[Targum]]ic is the later post-Achaemenid dialect found in the [[Targum Onkelos|Targum Onqelos]] and [[Targum Jonathan]], the 'official' targums. The original, Hasmonaean targums had reached Babylon sometime in the 2nd or 3rd century CE. They were then reworked according to the contemporary dialect of Babylon to create the language of the standard targums. This combination formed the basis of Babylonian Jewish literature for centuries to follow.

Galilean Targumic is similar to Babylonian Targumic. It is the mixing of literary Hasmonaean with the dialect of [[Galilee]]. The Hasmonaean targums reached Galilee in the 2nd century CE, and were reworked into this Galilean dialect for local use. The Galilean Targum was not considered an authoritative work by other communities, and documentary evidence shows that its text was amended. From the 11th century CE onwards, once the Babylonian Targum had become normative, the Galilean version became heavily influenced by it.

Babylonian Documentary Aramaic is a dialect in use from the 3rd century CE onwards. It is the dialect of Babylonian private documents, and, from the 12th century, all Jewish private documents are in Aramaic. It is based on Hasmonaean with very few changes. This was perhaps because many of the documents in BDA are legal documents, the language in them had to be sensible throughout the Jewish community from the start, and Hasmonaean was the old standard.

[[Nabataean language|Nabataean Aramaic]] is the language of the Arameo-Arab kingdom of [[Petra]]. The kingdom (''c.'' 200 BCE–106 CE) covered the east bank of the [[Jordan River]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northern Arabia. Perhaps because of the importance of the caravan trade, the Nabataeans began to use Aramaic in preference to [[Ancient North Arabian|Old North Arabic]]. The dialect is based on Achaemenid with a little influence from Arabic: 'l' is often turned into 'n', and there are a few Arabic loan words. Some Nabataean Aramaic inscriptions exist from the early days of the kingdom, but most are from the first four centuries CE The language is written in a [[cursive]] script that is the precursor to the modern [[Arabic alphabet]]. The number of Arabic loan words increases through the centuries, until, in the 4th century, Nabataean merges seamlessly with [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

Palmyrene Aramaic is the dialect that was in use in the [[Syriac]] city state of [[Palmyra]] in the Syrian Desert from 44 BCE to 274 CE. It was written in a rounded script, which later gave way to cursive [[Syriac alphabet|Estrangela]]. Like Nabataean, Palmyrene was influenced by Arabic, but to a much lesser degree.

Arsacid Aramaic, that in use during the [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid empire]] (247 BCE – 224 CE), represents a continuation of Achaemenid Aramaic, widely spoken throughout the west of the empire. Aramaic continued as the scribal basis for [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] as it developed for the needs of [[Parthian language|Parthian]]: using an Aramaic-derived script and incorporating many '[[heterograms]]', or Aramaic words meant to be read as Parthian ones. The Arsacids saw themselves as a continuation of Achaemenid rule, and so Arsacid Aramaic, more than any other post-Achaemenid dialect, continued the tradition of the chancery of [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]]. Over time, however, it came under the influence of contemporary, spoken Aramaic, [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. After the conquest of the Parthians by the Persian-speaking [[Sassanid Empire|Sasanids]], Arsacid Pahlavi and Aramaic were influential on Sasanian language use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Beyer|page=28 n. 27}}; {{Cite book|title=Ancient Persia|pages=118–20|last1=Wiesehöfer|first1=Josef|last2=Azodi|first2=Azizeh|isbn=|publisher=|location=|year=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Old Eastern Aramaic===
[[Image:Mandaic.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] [[Incantation bowl|magical 'demon trap']]]]
The dialects mentioned in the last section were all descended from Achaemenid Imperial Aramaic. However, the diverse regional dialects of Late Ancient Aramaic continued alongside these, often as simple, spoken languages. Early evidence for these spoken dialects is known only through their influence on words and names in a more standard dialect. However, these regional dialects became written languages in the 2nd century BCE. These dialects reflect a stream of Aramaic that is not dependent on Imperial Aramaic, and shows a clear division between the regions of Mesopotamia, Babylon and the east, and Judah, Syria, and the west.

In the East, the dialects of Palmyrene and Arsacid Aramaic merged with the regional languages to create languages with a foot in Imperial and a foot in regional Aramaic. The written form of [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]], the language of the [[Mandaeism|Mandaean]] religion, was descended from the Arsacid chancery script.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Iranian Scripts for Aramaic Languages,&quot; in the Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 341 (2006), pp. 53-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the kingdom of [[Osroene]], centred on [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] and founded in 132 BCE, the regional dialect became the official language: Old [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. On the upper reaches of the [[Tigris]], East Mesopotamian Aramaic flourished, with evidence from [[Hatra]], [[Assur]] and the [[Tur Abdin]]. [[Tatian]], the author of the gospel harmony the [[Diatessaron]] came from Assyria, and perhaps wrote his work (172 CE) in East Mesopotamian rather than Syriac or Greek. In Babylonia, the regional dialect was used by the Jewish community, Jewish Old Babylonian (from ''c.'' 70 CE). This everyday language increasingly came under the influence of Biblical Aramaic and Babylonian Targumic.

===Late Old Western Aramaic===
The western regional dialects of Aramaic followed a similar course to those of the east. They are quite distinct from the eastern dialects and Imperial Aramaic. Aramaic came to coexist with Canaanite dialects, eventually completely displacing [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] in the 1st century BCE and [[Hebrew language#Aramaic displaces Hebrew as a spoken language|Hebrew]] around the turn of the 4th century CE.

The form of Late Old Western Aramaic used by the Jewish community is best attested, and is usually referred to as Jewish Old Palestinian. Its oldest form is Old East Jordanian, which probably comes from the region of [[Caesarea Philippi]]. This is the dialect of the oldest manuscript of [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]] (''c.'' 170 BCE). The next distinct phase of the language is called Old Judaean into the 2nd century CE. Old Judaean literature can be found in various inscriptions and personal letters, preserved quotations in the [[Talmud]] and receipts from [[Qumran]]. [[Josephus]]' first, non-extant edition of his ''[[The Wars of the Jews|Jewish War]]'' was written in Old Judaean.

The Old East Jordanian dialect continued to be used into the 1st century CE by pagan communities living to the east of the Jordan. Their dialect is often then called Pagan Old Palestinian, and it was written in a cursive script somewhat similar to that used for Old Syriac. A Christian Old Palestinian dialect may have arisen from the pagan one, and this dialect may be behind some of the Western Aramaic tendencies found in the otherwise eastern Old Syriac gospels (see [[Peshitta]]).

====Languages during Jesus' lifetime====
{{See|Aramaic of Jesus}}
It is generally believed that in the 1st century CE, Jews in Judaea primarily spoke Aramaic with a dwindling number using [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as a native language.  Many learned Hebrew as a liturgical language.  Additionally, [[Koine Greek]] was an international language of the Roman administration and trade, and was widely understood by those in the urban spheres of influence. [[Latin]] was spoken in the Roman army, but had almost no impact on the linguistic landscape.

In addition to the formal, literary dialects of Aramaic based on Hasmonaean and Babylonian there were a number of colloquial Aramaic dialects. Seven dialects of [[Aramaic#Late Old Western Aramaic|Western Aramaic]] were spoken in the vicinity of Judaea in [[Jesus]]' time. They were probably distinctive yet mutually intelligible. Old Judaean was the prominent dialect of [[Jerusalem]] and Judaea. The region of [[Ein Gedi|Engedi]] had the South-east Judaean dialect. [[Samaria]] had its distinctive Samaritan Aramaic, where the consonants '[[he (letter)|he]]', '{{Transl|sem|[[heth]]}}' and '[[ayin|‘ayin]]' all became pronounced as '[[aleph]]'. Galilean Aramaic, the dialect of Jesus' home region, is only known from a few place names, the influences on Galilean Targumic, some rabbinic literature and a few private letters. It seems to have a number of distinctive features: [[diphthong]]s are never simplified into monophthongs. East of the Jordan, the various dialects of East Jordanian were spoken. In the region of [[Damascus]] and the  [[Anti-Lebanon mountains]], Damascene Aramaic was spoken (deduced mostly from Modern Western Aramaic). Finally, as far north as [[Aleppo]], the western dialect of Orontes Aramaic was spoken.

The three languages mutually influenced each other, especially Hebrew and Aramaic. Hebrew words entered Jewish Aramaic (mostly technical religious words but also everyday words like ''{{Transl|sem|‘ēṣ}}'' 'wood'). Vice versa, Aramaic words entered Hebrew (not only Aramaic words like ''māmmôn'' 'wealth' but Aramaic ways of using words like making Hebrew ''rā’ûi'', 'seen' mean 'worthy' in the sense of 'seemly', which is a loan translation of Aramaic ''{{Transl|sem|ḥāzê}}'' meaning 'seen' and 'worthy').

The Greek of the [[New Testament]] often preserves non-Greek ''semiticisms'', including transliterations of [[Semitic]] words:
* Some are Aramaic like ''talitha'' (ταλιθα) that can represent the noun ''{{Transl|sem|ṭalyĕṯā}}'' (Mark 5:41).
* Others can be either Hebrew or Aramaic like ''Rabbounei'' (Ραββουνει), which stands for 'my master/great one/teacher' in both languages (John 20:16).

The 2004 film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' is notable for its use of much dialogue in Aramaic only, specially reconstructed by a  scholar, but not an Aramaic specialist, [[William Fulco]]. Where the appropriate words (in 1st century Aramaic) were no longer known, he used the Aramaic of Daniel, 4th-century Syriac and Hebrew as the basis for his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.langmaker.com/db/Aramaic|title=Langmaker: Aramaic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Aramaic==
The 3rd century CE is taken as the threshold between Old and Middle Aramaic. During that century, the nature of the various Aramaic languages and dialects begins to change. The descendants of Imperial Aramaic ceased to be living languages, and the eastern and western regional languages began to form vital, new literatures. Unlike many of the dialects of Old Aramaic, much is known about the vocabulary and grammar of Middle Aramaic.

===Eastern Middle Aramaic===
Only two of the Old Eastern Aramaic languages continued into this period. In the north of the region, Old Syriac moved into Middle Syriac. In the south, Jewish Old Babylonian became Jewish Middle Babylonian. The post-Achaemenid, Arsacid dialect became the background of the new [[Mandaic language]].

====Syriac====
{{Main|Syriac language}}

{{listen|filename=aboun.ogg|title=Abun dbashmayo|description=The [[Lord's Prayer]], ''Abun dbashmayo'', sung in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]}}

Syriac (also &quot;Middle Syriac&quot;) is the classical, literary, liturgical and often spoken language of [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]] to this day, particularly the [[Assyrian church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic]] Church, [[Ancient Church of the East]] and [[Syriac Orthodox]] churches. It originated in [[Sassanid]] [[Assyria]] ([[Assuristan]]). Its golden age was the 4th to 6th centuries. This period began with the translation of the Bible into the language: the [[Peshitta]] and the masterful prose and poetry of [[Ephrem the Syrian]]. Middle Syriac, unlike its forebear, is a thoroughly Christian language{{Clarify|date=March 2010}}&lt;!--what exactly is a Christian language like, typologically, and how does it differ from a Buddhist language?--&gt;, although in time it became the language of those opposed to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] leadership of the [[Church of the East]]. Missionary activity by Assyrian and Nestorian Christians led to the spread of Syriac from Mesopotamia through [[Iran|Persia]] and into [[Central Asia]], [[India]] and [[China]].

====Jewish Middle Babylonian Aramaic====
&lt;!-- This section is linked, this language was taken from the aramaic language of the byzintine's from [[Halakha]] --&gt;
{{Main|Jewish Babylonian Aramaic}}
Jewish Middle Babylonian is the language employed by Jewish writers in Babylonia between the 4th century and the 11th century CE. It is most commonly identified with the language of the Babylonian [[Talmud]] (which was completed in the 7th century) and of post-Talmudic ([[Geonim|Geonic]]) literature, which are the most important cultural products of Babylonian Jewry. The most important epigraphic sources for the dialect are the hundreds of Aramaic [[Incantation bowl|magic bowls]] written in the Jewish script.

====Mandaic====
{{Main|Mandaic language}}
Mandaic, spoken by the [[Mandeans]] of [[Iraq]], is a sister dialect to Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, though it is both linguistically and culturally distinct. Classical Mandaic is the language in which the Mandaean's [[Gnostic]] religious literature was composed. It is characterized by a highly phonetic orthography.

===Western Middle Aramaic===
The dialects of Old Western Aramaic continued with Jewish Middle Palestinian (in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew 'square script']]), Samaritan Aramaic (in the [[Phoenician alphabet|old Hebrew script]]) and Christian Palestinian (in cursive [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac script]]). Of these three, only Jewish Middle Palestinian continued as a written language.{{Clarify|date=March 2010}}&lt;!--So how do we know the other two if they weren't written? Also, at least Samaritan Aramaic certainly was written and lots of texts survive.--&gt;

====Jewish Middle Palestinian Aramaic====
In 135, after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], many [[Jew]]ish leaders, expelled from [[Jerusalem]], moved to [[Galilee]]. The Galilean dialect thus rose from obscurity to become the standard among Jews in the west. This dialect was spoken not only in Galilee, but also in the surrounding parts. It is the linguistic setting for the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (completed in the 5th century), Palestinian [[targum]]im (Jewish Aramaic versions of scripture), and [[midrash]]im (biblical commentaries and teaching). The standard [[niqqud|vowel pointing]] for the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Tiberian system (7th century), was developed by speakers of the Galilean dialect of Jewish Middle Palestinian. Classical Hebrew vocalisation, therefore, in representing the Hebrew of this period, probably reflects the contemporary pronunciation of this Aramaic dialect.

[[Middle Judaean Aramaic|Middle Judaean]], the descendant of [[Old Judaean Aramaic|Old Judaean]], is no longer the dominant dialect, and was used only in southern Judaea (the variant Engedi dialect continued throughout this period). Likewise, [[Middle East Jordanian Aramaic|Middle East Jordanian]] continues as a minor dialect from [[Old East Jordanian Aramaic|Old East Jordanian]]. The inscriptions in the synagogue at [[Dura-Europos]] are either in Middle East Jordanian or Middle Judaean.

====Samaritan Aramaic====
{{Main|Samaritan Aramaic language}}
The Aramaic dialect of the [[Samaritan]] community is earliest attested by a documentary tradition that can be dated back to the 4th century. Its modern pronunciation is based on the form used in the 10th century.

====Christian Palestinian Aramaic====
The language of Western-Aramaic-speaking Christians is evidenced from the 6th century, but probably existed two centuries earlier. The language itself comes from Christian Old Palestinian, but its writing conventions were based on early [[Middle Syriac]], and it was heavily influenced by [[Greek language|Greek]]. For example, the name Jesus, although ''Yešû`'' in Aramaic, is written ''Yesûs'' in Christian Palestinian.

==Modern Aramaic==
{{Main|Neo-Aramaic languages}}
Over 400,000 people of various communities from across the [[Middle East]], and recent [[Emigration|emigrants]] who have moved out of these communities, speak one of several varieties of Modern Aramaic (also called ''Neo-Aramaic'') natively, including by religious adherence; [[Christian]]s, [[Jew]]s, [[Mandaeism|Mandaeans]] and a tiny number of [[Muslim]]s. Having lived in remote areas as insulated communities, the remaining modern speakers of Aramaic dialects escaped the linguistic pressures experienced by others during the large scale [[language shift]]s that saw the proliferation of other tongues among those who previously did not speak them, most recently the [[Arabization]] of the Middle East and North Africa by [[Muslim]] [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabians]], during their spread of [[Islam]]. Most of the people of that region who converted to Islam, and many from the remaining unconverted population, also adopted Arabic as their first language. The Aramaic speaking peoples such as Assyrians have preserved their traditions with schools, printing presses and now with electronic media.

The Neo-Aramaic languages are now farther apart in their comprehension of one another than perhaps they have ever been. The last 200 years have not been good to Aramaic speakers. Instability throughout the Middle East has led to a worldwide diaspora of Aramaic-speakers. The year 1915 is especially prominent for Aramaic-speaking Assyrian Christians who experienced the [[Assyrian Genocide]] (''Sayfo'' or ''Saypā''; literally meaning ''sword'' in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]), and all Christian groups living in eastern [[Turkey]] in general (see also [[Armenian Genocide]], [[Greek genocide]]) who were the subjects of the genocide that marked the end of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. For Aramaic-speaking Jews, 1950 is a watershed year: the founding of the state of [[Israel]] and consequent [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]], including [[Iraq]], led most Iraqi Jews, both Aramaic-speaking and Arabic-speaking Iraqi Jews, to emigrate to Israel. However, immigration to Israel has led to the Jewish Neo-Aramaic (and Jewish Iraqi Arabic) being replaced by Modern Hebrew ([[Ivrit]]) among children of the migrants. The practical extinction of many Jewish dialects seems imminent.

===Modern Eastern Aramaic===
Modern Eastern Aramaic exists in a wide variety of dialects and languages. There is significant difference between the Aramaic spoken by [[Jew]]s, [[Chaldo-Assyrian]] [[Christian]]s, and [[Mandaeism|Mandaeans]].

The Christian languages are often called Modern [[Syriac language|Syriac]] (or Neo-Syriac, particularly when referring to their literature), being deeply influenced by the literary and liturgical language of Middle Syriac. However, they also have roots in numerous, previously unwritten, local Aramaic varieties, and are not purely the direct descendants of the language of [[Ephrem the Syrian]]. The varieties are not all mutually intelligible.  The principal Christian varieties are [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] used by the ethnic Assyrians of Iraq, south east Turkey, Iran and north east Syria.

The [[Judeo-Aramaic language|Jewish Modern Aramaic languages]] are now mostly spoken in [[Israel]], and most are facing extinction. The Jewish varieties that have come from communities that once lived between [[Lake Urmia]] and [[Mosul]] are not all mutually intelligible. In some places, for example [[Urmia]], Christians and Jews speak mutually unintelligible varieties of Modern Eastern Aramaic in the same place. In others, the [[Nineveh Plains]] around Mosul for example, the varieties of the two ethnic and faith communities are similar enough to allow conversation.

Modern Western Syriac (also called Central Neo-Aramaic, being in between Western Neo-Aramaic and Eastern Neo-Syriac) is generally represented by [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]], the language of the [[Tur Abdin]]. A related language, [[Mlahsô language|Mlahsô]], has recently become extinct.

[[Mandaeans]], living in the [[Khūzestān Province]] of [[Iran]] and scattered throughout [[Iraq]], speak Modern [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]]. It is quite distinct from any other Aramaic variety.

===Modern Western Aramaic===
{{Main|Western Neo-Aramaic}}
Very little remains of Western Aramaic. It is still spoken in the villages of [[Ma'loula]], [[Bakh`a]] and [[Jubb`adin]] on [[Syria]]'s side of the [[Anti-Lebanon mountains]], as well as by some people who migrated from these villages, to [[Damascus]] and other larger towns of Syria. All these speakers of Modern Western Aramaic are fluent in Arabic, which has now become the main language in these villages.

==Sounds==
Each dialect of Aramaic has its own distinctive pronunciation, and it would not be feasible here to go into all these properties. Aramaic has a phonological palette of 25 to 40 distinct phonemes. In general, older dialects tended to have a richer phonology than more modern ones. In particular, some modern Jewish Aramaic pronunciations lack the series of 'emphatic' consonants. Other dialects have borrowed from the inventories of surrounding languages, particularly [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

===Vowels===
As with most Semitic languages, Aramaic can be thought of as having three basic sets of vowels:
* Open ''a''-vowels
* Close front ''i''-vowels
* Close back ''u''-vowels
These vowel groups are relatively stable, but the exact articulation of any individual is most dependent on its consonantal setting.

The cardinal open vowel is an open near-front unrounded vowel ('short' ''a'', somewhat like the first vowel in the English 'batter', {{IPAblink|a}}). It usually has a back counterpart ('long' ''a'', like the ''a'' in 'father', {{IPAblink|ɑ}}, or even tending to the vowel in 'caught', {{IPAblink|ɔ}}), and a front counterpart ('short' ''e'', like the vowel in 'head', {{IPAblink|ɛ}}). There is much correspondence between these vowels between dialects. There is some evidence that Middle Babylonian dialects did not distinguish between the short ''a'' and short ''e''. In West Syriac dialects, and possibly Middle Galilean, the long ''a'' became the ''o'' sound. The open ''e'' and back ''a'' are often indicated in writing by the use of the letters 'alaph' (a [[glottal stop]]) or 'he' (like the English ''h'').

The cardinal close front vowel is the 'long' ''i'' (like the vowel in 'need', {{IPA|[i]}}). It has a slightly more open counterpart, the 'long' ''e'', as in the final vowel of 'café' ({{IPA|[e]}}). Both of these have shorter counterparts, which tend to be pronounced slightly more open. Thus, the short close ''e'' corresponds with the open ''e'' in some dialects. The close front vowels usually use the consonant ''y'' as a [[mater lectionis]].

The cardinal close back vowel is the 'long' ''u'' (like the vowel in 'school', {{IPA|[u]}}). It has a more open counterpart, the 'long' ''o'', like the vowel in 'low' ({{IPA|[o]}}). There are shorter, and thus more open, counterparts to each of these, with the short close ''o'' sometimes corresponding with the long open ''a''. The close back vowels often use the consonant ''w'' to indicate their quality.

Two basic [[diphthong]]s exist: an open vowel followed by ''y'' (''ay''), and an open vowel followed by ''w'' (''aw''). These were originally full diphthongs, but many dialects have converted them to ''e'' and ''o'' respectively.

The so-called 'emphatic' consonants (see the next section) cause all vowels to become mid-centralised.

===Consonants===
The various alphabets used for writing Aramaic languages have twenty-two letters (all of which are consonants). Some of these letters, though, can stand for two or three different sounds (usually a [[Stop consonant|plosive]] and a [[fricative consonant|fricative]] at the same point of articulation). Aramaic classically uses a series of lightly contrasted plosives and fricatives:
* Labial set: ''p''/''f'' and ''b''/''v'',
* Dental set: ''t''/''θ'' and ''d''/''ð'',
* Velar set: ''k''/''x'' and ''g''/''ɣ''.
Each member of a certain pair is written with the same letter of the alphabet in most writing systems (that is, ''p'' and ''f'' are written with the same letter), and are near [[allophone]]s.

A distinguishing feature of Aramaic phonology (and that of Semitic languages in general) is the presence of 'emphatic' consonants. These are consonants that are pronounced with the root of the tongue retracted, with varying degrees of [[pharyngealization]] and [[Velar consonant|velarisation]]. Using their alphabetic names, these emphatics are:
* {{unicode|Ḥêṯ}}, a [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]], {{IPA|/ħ/}},
* {{unicode|Ṭêṯ}}, a pharyngealized ''t'', {{IPA|/tˤ/}},
* {{unicode|ʽAyin}} (or {{unicode|ʽE}} in some dialects), a pharyngealized [[glottal stop]] (sometimes considered to be a [[voiced pharyngeal approximant]]), {{IPA|[ʕ]}} or {{IPA|[ʔˤ]}},
* {{unicode|Ṣāḏê}}, a pharyngealized ''s'', {{IPA|/sˤ/}},
* {{unicode|Qôp}}, an [[uvular consonant|uvular]] ''k'' (a [[voiceless uvular plosive]]), {{IPA|/q/}}.
{{listen|filename=Aramaic_emphatics.ogg|title=The emphatic consonants of Aramaic|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Ancient Aramaic may have had a larger series of emphatics. Not all dialects of Aramaic give these consonants their historic values.

Overlapping with the set of emphatics are the 'guttural' consonants. They include {{unicode|Ḥêṯ}} and {{unicode|ʽAyn}} from the emphatic set, and add {{unicode|ʼĀlap̄}} (a [[glottal stop]]) and {{unicode|Hê}} (as the English 'h').

Aramaic classically has a set of four [[sibilant consonant|sibilants]] (Ancient Aramaic may have had six):
* {{IPA|/s/}} (as in English 'sea'),
* {{IPA|/z/}} (as in English 'zero'),
* {{IPA|/ʃ/}} (as in English 'ship'),
* {{IPA|/sˤ/}} (the emphatic {{unicode|Ṣāḏê}} listed above).

In addition to these sets, Aramaic has the [[nasal consonant]]s ''m'' and ''n'', and the [[approximant consonant|approximants]] ''r'' (usually an [[alveolar trill]]), ''l'', ''y'' and ''w''.

===Historical sound changes===
Six broad features of sound change can be seen as dialect differentials:
# Vowel change&amp;nbsp;– This occurs almost too frequently to document fully, but is a major distinctive feature of different dialects.
# Plosive/fricative pair reduction&amp;nbsp;– Originally, Aramaic, like [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian Hebrew]], had fricatives as conditioned [[allophone]]s for each plosive. In the wake of vowel changes, the distinction eventually became phonemic; still later, it was often lost in certain dialects. For example, [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]] has mostly lost {{IPA|/p/}}, using {{IPA|/f/}} instead; other dialects (for instance, standard [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]]) have lost {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}} and replaced them with {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}. In most dialects of Modern Syriac, {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} become {{IPA|/w/}} after a vowel.
# Loss of emphatics&amp;nbsp;– Some dialects have replaced emphatic consonants with non-emphatic counterparts, while those spoken in the [[Caucasus]] often have [[glottalic consonant|glottalized]] rather than [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] emphatics.
# Guttural assimilation&amp;nbsp;– This is the main feature of Samaritan pronunciation, also found in the [[Samaritan Hebrew language]]: all the gutturals are reduced to a simple glottal stop. Some Modern Aramaic dialects do not pronounce ''h'' in all words (the third person masculine pronoun 'hu' becomes 'ow').
# Proto-Semitic */θ/ */ð/ are reflected in Aramaic as */t/, */d/, whereas they became sibilants in Hebrew (the number three in Hebrew is 'šālôš', but '{{unicode|tlāṯ}}' in Aramaic). Dental/sibilant shifts are still happening in the modern dialects.
# New phonetic inventory&amp;nbsp;– Modern dialects have borrowed sounds from the surrounding, dominant languages. The usual inventory is {{IPA|[ʒ]}} (as the first consonant in 'azure'), {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}} (as in 'jam') and {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}} (as in 'church'). The [[Syriac alphabet]] has been adapted for writing these new sounds.

==Grammar==
{{listen|filename=kthovo.ogg|title=Aramaic words based on the triliteral&lt;br /&gt; root ''k-t-b'' |description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}
As with other Semitic languages, Aramaic [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the way words are formed) is based on the [[Semitic root|triliteral]] root. The root consists of three consonants and has a basic meaning, for example, ''k-t-b'' has the meaning of 'writing'. This is then modified by the addition of vowels and other consonants to create different nuances of the basic meaning:
* ''{{unicode|Kṯāḇâ}}'', handwriting, inscription, script, book.
* ''{{unicode|Kṯāḇê}}'', the Scriptures.
* ''{{unicode|Kāṯûḇâ}}'', secretary, scribe.
* ''{{unicode|Kṯāḇeṯ}}'', I wrote.
* ''{{unicode|Eḵtûḇ}}'', I shall write.

===Nouns and adjectives===
Aramaic nouns and adjectives are inflected to show gender, number and state. The latter somewhat akin to case in [[Indo-European languages]].

Aramaic has two grammatical genders, masculine and feminine. The feminine absolute singular is usually marked by the ending ''-â'', which is usually written with an [[aleph]]. Jewish varieties, however, often use [[he (letter)|he]] instead, following Hebrew orthography.

Nouns can be either singular or plural, but an additional 'dual' number exists for nouns that usually come in pairs. The dual number gradually disappeared from Aramaic over time and has little influence in Middle and Modern Aramaic.

Aramaic nouns and adjectives can exist in one of three states; these states correspond in part to the role of cases in other languages.
# The ''absolute'' state is the basic form of a noun (for example, ''{{unicode|kṯâḇâ}}'', 'handwriting'). The absolute state can be used in most syntactical roles. However, by the Middle Aramaic period, its use for nouns, but not adjectives, had been widely replaced by the emphatic state.
# The ''[[Status constructus|construct]]'' state is a form of the noun used to make possessive phrases (for example, ''{{unicode|kṯāḇaṯ malkṯâ}}'', 'the handwriting of the queen). In the masculine singular it is often the same as the absolute, but may undergo vowel reduction in longer words. The feminine construct and masculine construct plural are marked by suffixes. Unlike a [[genitive case]], which marks the possessor, the construct state is marked on the possessed. This is mainly due to Aramaic word order: '''possessed[const.] possessor[abs./emph.]''' are treated as a speech unit, with the first unit (possessed) employing the construct state to link it to the following word. In Middle Aramaic, the use of the construct state for all but stock phrases (like ''bar-nāšâ'', 'son of man') begins to disappear.
# The ''emphatic'' or ''determined'' state is an extended form of the noun that functions a bit like a [[Article (grammar)|definite article]] (which Aramaic lacks; for example, ''{{unicode|kṯāḇtâ}}'', 'the handwriting'). It is marked with a suffix. Although its original grammatical function seems to have been to mark definiteness, it is used already in Imperial Aramaic to mark all important nouns, even if they should be considered technically indefinite. This practice developed to the extent that the absolute state became a virtual rarity in later varieties of Aramaic.

Whereas other [[Northwest Semitic languages]], like Hebrew, have the absolute and construct states, the emphatic/determined state is a unique feature to Aramaic. [[Inflection|Case endings]], as in [[Ugaritic grammar#Case|Ugaritic]], probably existed in a very early stage of the language, and glimpses of them can be seen in a few compounded proper names. However, as most were short final vowels, they were never written, and the few characteristic long vowels of  the masculine plural accusative and genitive are not clearly evidenced in inscriptions. Often, the [[Object (grammar)|direct object]] is marked by a prefixed ''l-'' (the [[preposition and postposition|preposition]] 'to') if it is definite.

Adjectives agree with their nouns in number and gender, but only agree in state if attributive. Predicative adjectives are in the absolute state regardless of the state of their noun (a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] can, but need not be written). Thus, an attributive adjective to an emphatic noun, as in the phrase 'the good king', is written also in the emphatic state ''{{unicode|malkâ ṭāḇâ}}'' — king[emph.] good[emph.]. In comparison, the predicative adjective, as in the phrase 'the king is good', is written in the absolute state ''{{unicode|ṭāḇ malkâ}}'' — good[abs.] king[emph.].

The final ''-â'' in a number of these suffixes is written with the letter [[aleph]]. However, some Jewish Aramaic texts employ the letter [[he (letter)|he]] for the feminine absolute singular. Likewise, some Jewish Aramaic texts employ the Hebrew masculine absolute singular suffix ''-îm'' instead of ''-în''. The masculine determined plural suffix, ''-ayyâ'', has an alternative version, ''-ê''. The alternative is sometimes called the 'gentilic plural' for its prominent use in ethnonyms (''yəhûḏāyê'', 'the Jews', for example). This alternative plural is written with the letter [[aleph]], and came to be the only plural for nouns and adjectives of this type in Syriac and some other varieties of Aramaic. The masculine construct plural, ''-ê'', is written with [[yodh]]. In Syriac and some other variants this ending is [[diphthong]]ized to ''-ai''.

Possessive phrases in Aramaic can either be made with the construct state or by linking two nouns with the relative particle ''d[î]-''. As use of the construct state almost disappears from the Middle Aramaic period on, the latter method became the main way of making possessive phrases.

{{listen|filename=kthovath malktho.ogg|title=Different variations of the possessive construction in Aramaic|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}
For example, the various forms of possessive phrases (for 'the handwriting of the queen') are:
# '''{{unicode|Kṯāḇaṯ malkṯâ}}''' — the oldest construction: the possessed object(kṯāḇâ, 'handwriting') is in the construct state (kṯāḇaṯ); the possessor (malkâ, 'queen') is in the emphatic state (malkṯâ)
# '''{{unicode|Kṯāḇtâ d(î)-malkṯâ}}''' — both words are in the emphatic state and the relative particle ''d[î]-'' is used to mark the relationship
# '''{{unicode|Kṯāḇtāh d(î)-malkṯâ}}''' — both words are in the emphatic state, and the relative particle is used, but the possessed is given an anticipatory, pronominal ending (kṯāḇt[â]-āh, 'handwriting-her'; literally, 'her writing, that (of) the queen').
In Modern Aramaic, the last form is by far the most common. In Biblical Aramaic, the last form is virtually absent.

===Verbs===
The Aramaic verb has gradually evolved in time and place, varying between varieties of the language. Verb forms are marked for [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second or third), [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural), [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine or feminine), [[grammatical tense|tense]] (perfect or imperfect), [[grammatical mood|mood]] (indicative, imperative, jussive or infinitive) and [[voice (grammar)|voice]] (active, reflexive or passive). Aramaic also employs a system of [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]s, or verbal stems, to mark intensive and extensive developments in the lexical meaning of verbs.

====Aspectual tense====
Aramaic has two proper [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: [[perfective aspect|perfect]] and [[imperfective aspect|imperfect]]. These were originally [[grammatical aspect|aspectual]], but developed into something more like a [[preterite]] and [[future tense|future]]. The perfect is [[Markedness|unmarked]], while the imperfect uses various [[prefix|preformative]]s that vary according to person, number and gender. In both tenses the third-person singular masculine is the unmarked form from which others are derived by addition of [[Suffix|afformative]]s (and preformatives in the imperfect). In the chart below (on the root K-T-B, meaning 'to write'), the first form given is the usual form in Imperial Aramaic, while the second is [[Syriac language|Classical Syriac]].

|}

====Conjugations or verbal stems====
Like other Semitic languages, Aramaic employs a number of conjugations, or verbal stems, to extend the lexical coverage of verbs. The basic conjugation of the verb is called the ''ground stem'', or ''G-stem''. Following the tradition of mediaeval Arabic grammarians, it is more often called the Pə‘al (also written Pe‘al), using the form of the [[triliteral root]] P-‘-L, meaning ‘to do’. This stem carries the basic lexical meaning of the verb.

By doubling of the second radical, or root letter, the D-stem or Pa‘‘el is formed. This is often an intensive development of the basic lexical meaning. For example, ''{{unicode|qəṭal}}'' means ‘he killed’, whereas ''{{unicode|qaṭṭel}}'' means ‘he slew’. The precise relationship in meaning between the two stems differs for every verb.

A [[preformative]], which can be ''ha-'', ''a-'' or ''ša-'', creates the C-stem or variously the Hap̄‘el, Ap̄‘el or Šap̄‘el (also spelt Haph‘el, Aph‘el and Shaph‘el). This is often an extensive or causative development of the basic lexical meaning. For example, ''{{unicode|ṭə‘â}}'' means ‘he went astray’, whereas ''{{unicode|aṭ‘î}}'' means ‘he deceived’. The Šap̄‘el is the least common variant of the C-stem. Because this variant is standard in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], it is possible that its use in Aramaic represents [[loanword]]s from that language. The difference between the variants Hap̄‘el and Ap̄‘el appears to be the gradual dropping of the initial ''h'' sound in later Old Aramaic. This is noted by the respelling of the older [[he (letter)|he]] preformative with [[aleph]].

These three conjugations are supplemented with three derived conjugations, produced by the preformative ''hiṯ-'' or ''eṯ-''. The loss of the initial ''h'' sound occurs similarly to that in the form above. These three derived stems are the Gt-stem, Hiṯpə‘el or Eṯpə‘el (also written Hithpe‘el or Ethpe‘el), the Dt-stem, Hiṯpa‘‘al or Eṯpa‘‘al (also written Hithpa‘‘al or Ethpa‘‘al), and the Ct-stem, Hiṯhap̄‘al, Ettap̄‘al, Hištap̄‘al or Eštap̄‘al (also written Hithhaph‘al, Ettaph‘al, Hishtaph‘al or Eshtaph‘al). Their meaning is usually [[reflexive verb|reflexive]], but later became [[passive voice|passive]]. However, as with other conjugations, actual meaning differs from verb to verb.

Not all verbs utilise all of these conjugations, and, in some, the G-stem is not used. In the chart below (on the root K-T-B, meaning ‘to write’), the first form given is the usual form in Imperial Aramaic, while the second is [[Syriac language|Classical Syriac]].

Aramaic also has two proper [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: the perfect and the imperfect. In Imperial Aramaic, the [[participle]] began to be used for a [[historical present]]. Perhaps under influence from other languages, Middle Aramaic developed a system of composite tenses (combinations of forms of the verb with pronouns or an [[auxiliary verb]]), allowing for narrative that is more vivid. The syntax of Aramaic (the way sentences are put together) usually follows the order verb-subject-object (VSO).  Imperial (Persian) Aramaic, however, tended to follow a S-O-V pattern (similar to Akkadian), which was the result of Persian syntactic influence.

==Aramaic word processors==
The World's first Aramaic language [[word processor|word processing software]] was developed in 1986&amp;ndash;1987 in [[Kuwait]] by a young information technology professional named [[Sunil Sivanand]], who is now Managing Director and Chief Technology Architect at [[Acette]]. Sunil Sivanand did most of the character generation and programming work on a first generation, twin disk drive [[IBM Personal Computer]]. The project was sponsored by [[Daniel Benjamin]], who was a patron of a group of individuals working worldwide to preserve and revive the Aramaic language.

'''Titus''' was a companion of [[Saint Paul]], mentioned in several of the [[Pauline epistles]]. Titus was with Paul and [[Barnabas]] at [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]] and accompanied them to the [[Council of Jerusalem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Galatians|2:1-3}}; {{Bibleverse||Acts|15:2}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his name occurs nowhere in the [[Acts of the Apostles]].

He appears to have been a [[Gentile]] – for Paul sternly refused to have him [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]], because Paul believed Christ's gospel freed believers from the requirements of the [[613 Mitzvot]] &amp;mdash; and to have been chiefly engaged in ministering to Gentiles. At a later period, Paul's epistles place him with Paul and [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] at [[Ephesus]], whence he was sent by Paul to [[Corinth, Greece]] for the purpose of getting the contributions of the church there on behalf of the poor Christians at Jerusalem sent forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2|Corinthians|8:6}}; {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Corinthians|12:18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rejoined Paul when he was in [[Macedon]]ia, and cheered him with the tidings he brought from Corinth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse-nb|2|Corinthians|7:6-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this his name is not mentioned until after Paul's first imprisonment, when he was engaged in the organization of the church in [[Crete]], where Paul had left him for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Titus|1:5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last notice of him is in {{Bibleverse|2|Timothy|4:10}}, where he leaves Paul in Rome in order to travel to [[Early centers of Christianity#Salona|Dalmatia]]. The [[New Testament]] does not record his death.

According to tradition, Paul ordained Titus bishop of [[Gortyn]] in Crete. He died in the year 107, aged about 95.

It has been argued that the name &quot;Titus&quot; in 2 Corinthians and Galatians is nothing more than an informal name used by Timothy, implied already by the fact that even though both are said to be long-term close companions of Paul, they never appear in common scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Fellows, Richard G. &quot;Was Titus Timothy?&quot; ''Journal for the Study of the New Testament'' '''81''' (2001):33-58.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory proposes that a number of passages—1 Cor. 4:17, 16.10; 2 Cor. 2:13, 7:6, 13-14, 12:18; and Acts 19.22—all refer to the same journey of a single individual, Titus-Timothy. [[2 Timothy]] seems to dispute this, by claiming that Titus has gone to Dalmatia.&lt;ref&gt;cf 2 Timothy 4:10&lt;/ref&gt; 

The feast day of Titus was not included in the [[Tridentine Calendar]]. When added in 1854, it was assigned to 6 February.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] assigned the feast to 26 January so as to celebrate the two disciples of Paul, Titus and Timothy, on the day after the feast of the [[Conversion of St. Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] celebrates these two, together with [[Silas]], on the same date. The [[Orthodox Church]] commemorates him on 25 August and on 4 January.

His relics, now consisting of only his skull, are venerated in the Church of St. Titus, [[Heraklion]], Crete to which it was returned in 1966&lt;ref name=&quot;The Orthodox Messenger, v. 8(7/8), July/Aug 1997&quot;&gt;[http://www.orthodoxchristian.info/pages/titus.htm The Orthodox Messenger, v. 8(7/8), July/Aug 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; after being removed to Venice during the Turkish occupation.

Like [[lanthanide]]s, actinides form a family of elements with similar properties. Within actinides, there are two overlapping groups: [[transuranium elements]], which follow uranium in the [[periodic table]]&amp;mdash;and [[transplutonium element]]s, which follow plutonium. Compared to the lanthanides, which (except for [[promethium]]) are found in nature in appreciable quantities, most actinides are rare. The most abundant, or easy to synthesize actinides are [[uranium]] and [[thorium]], followed by plutonium, [[americium]], [[actinium]], [[protactinium]] and [[neptunium]].

At present, there are two major methods of producing [[isotope]]s of transplutonium elements: irradiation of the lighter elements with [[neutron]]s or accelerated charged particles. The first method is most important for applications, as only neutron irradiation using [[nuclear reactor]]s allows to produce sizeable amounts of synthetic actinides; however, it is limited to relatively light elements. The advantage of the second method is that it allows obtaining elements heavier than plutonium, as well as neutron-deficient isotopes, which are not formed during neutron irradiation.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBE&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author = B. Myasoedov ''et al.''|title = Analytical chemistry of transplutonium elements| place =Moscow|publisher = Nauka|year = 1972|isbn = 0470627158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962–1966, there were attempts in the United States to produce transplutonium isotopes using a series of 6 [[Underground nuclear testing|underground nuclear explosions]]. Small samples of rock were extracted from the blast area immediately after the test to study the explosion products, but no isotopes with [[mass number]] greater than 257 could be detected, despite predictions that such isotopes would have relatively long [[half-life|half-lives]] of [[Alpha-decay|α-decay]]. This inobservation was attributed to [[spontaneous fission]] owing to the large speed of the products and to other decay channels, such as neutron emission and [[nuclear fission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TBE&quot;/&gt;

The existence of transuranium elements was suggested by [[Enrico Fermi]] based on his experiments in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=О возможном нахождении элемента с атомным номером выше 92 (On the possible finding of the element with atomic number greater than 92)|journal=Uspekhi Fizicheskikh Nauk|year=1934|volume=14|issue=7|page=829|url=http://ufn.ru/ru/articles/1934/7/b/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ku&quot;&gt;{{cite book

| page = 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, even though four actinides were known by that time, it was not yet understood that they formed a family similar to lanthanides. The prevailing view that dominated early research into transuranics was that they were regular elements in the 7th period, with thorium, protactinium, and uranium corresponding to 6th-period hafnium, tantalum, and tungsten, respectively. Synthesis of transuranics gradually undermined this point of view. By 1944 an observation that [[curium]] failed to exhibit oxidation states above 4 (whereas its supposed 6th period neighbor, platinum, can reach oxidation state of 7) prompted [[Glenn Seaborg]] to formulate a so-called &quot;actinide hypothesis&quot; . Studies of known actinides and discoveries of further transuranic elements provided more data in support of this point of view, but the phrase &quot;actinide hypothesis&quot; (the implication being that &quot;hypothesis&quot; is something that's not been decisively proven) remained in active use by scientists through the late 1960s.

===From actinium to neptunium===
[[File:Enrico Fermi 1943-49.jpg|thumb|left|[[Enrico Fermi]] suggested the existence of transuranium elements in 1934.]]

Uranium and thorium were the first actinides [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]]. Uranium was identified in 1789 by the German chemist [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] in [[Uraninite|pitchblende]] ore. He named it after the planet [[Uranus (planet)|Uranus]],&lt;ref name=g1250/&gt; which had been discovered only eight years earlier. Klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound (likely [[sodium diuranate]]) by dissolving [[pitchblende]] in [[nitric acid]] and neutralizing the solution with [[sodium hydroxide]]. He then reduced the obtained yellow powder with charcoal, and extracted a black substance that he mistook for metal. Only 60 years later, the French scientist [[Eugène-Melchior Péligot]] identified it with uranium oxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This value was confirmed experimentally in 1882 by K. Zimmerman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1007/1-4020-3598-5_5|author=Ingmar Grenthe ''et al.''|chapter=Uranium|title=The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Ann., 213, 290 (1882); 216, 1 (1883); Ber. 15 (1882) 849&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thorium oxide]] was discovered by [[Friedrich Wöhler]] in the mineral, which was found in Norway (1827).&lt;ref name=&quot;Golub&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author = A. M. Golub|title = Общая и неорганическая химия (General and Inorganic Chemistry)|year = 1971|volume = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] characterized this material in more detail by in 1828. By reduction of thorium tetrachloride with potassium, he isolated the metal
and named it thorium after the [[norse mythology|Norse god]] of thunder and lightning [[Thor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Berzelius, J.

Actinium was discovered in 1899 by [[André-Louis Debierne]], an assistant of [[Marie Curie]], in the pitchblende waste left after removal of radium and polonium. He described the substance (in 1899) as similar to [[titanium]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Sur un nouvelle matière radio-active |first = André-Louis|last = Debierne|journal = Comptes rendus|volume = 129|pages = 593–595|year = 1899|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3085b/f593.table|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (in 1900) as similar to [[thorium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Sur un nouvelle matière radio-actif – l'actinium|first = André-Louis|last = Debierne |journal = Comptes rendus|volume = 130|pages = 906–908|year = 1900–1901|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3086n/f906.table|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of actinium by Debierne was however questioned in 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Discovery of Actinium |first = H.

The name for word actinium comes from the Greek ''aktis, aktinos'' (ακτίς, ακτίνος), meaning beam or ray. This metal was discovered not by its own radiation but by the radiation of the daughter products.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golub&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Himiya aktiniya&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Z. K. Karalova, B. Myasoedov|title=Actinium|place=Moscow|publisher=[[Nauka]]|year=1982|series=Analytical chemistry items}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the close similarity of actinium and lanthanum and low abundance, pure actinium could only be produced in 1950. The term actinide was probably introduced by [[Victor Goldschmidt]] in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ed029p581.2|title=Letters|year=1952|last1=Hakala|first1=Reino W.|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=29|issue=11|pages=581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protactinium]] was possibly isolated in 1900 by [[William Crookes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Emsley&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title = Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|last = Emsley|first = John|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2001|location = Oxford, England, UK|isbn = 0198503407|chapter = Protactinium|pages = 347–349|url = http://books.google.com/?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&amp;pg=PA348|date = 2003-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first identified in 1913, when [[Kasimir Fajans]] and Oswald Helmuth Göhring encountered the short-lived isotope &lt;sup&gt;234m&lt;/sup&gt;Pa (half-life 1.17 minutes) during their studies of the &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U decay.

The name was shortened to ''Protactinium'' in 1949. This element was little characterized until 1960, when A. G. Maddock and co-workers in UK produced 130&amp;nbsp;grams of protactinium from 60 tonnes of waste left after extraction of uranium from its ore.&lt;ref name=g1251&gt;Greenwood, p. 1251&lt;/ref&gt;

Neptunium (named for the planet [[Neptune]], the next [[planet]] out from Uranus, after which uranium was named) was discovered by [[Edwin McMillan]] and [[Philip H.

===Plutonium and above===
[[File:Glenn Seaborg 1964.png|thumb|[[Glenn T. Seaborg]] and his group at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] synthesized Pu, Am, Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, Md, No and element 106, which was later named [[seaborgium]] in his honor while he was still living. They also developed more than 100 atomic actinide isotopes.]]

Transuranium elements do not occur in sizeable quantities in nature and are commonly synthesized via [[nuclear reaction]]s conducted with [[nuclear reactor]]s. For example, under irradiation with reactor neutrons, [[uranium-238]] partially converts to [[plutonium-239]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ {}^{238}_{92}U + {}^{1}_{0}n\ \xrightarrow\ \ {}^{239}_{92}U\ \xrightarrow[23.5\ min]{\beta^-}\ {}^{239}_{93}Np\ \xrightarrow[2.3\ days]{\beta^-}\ {}^{239}_{94}Pu\ \xrightarrow[2.4\cdot 10^4\ years]{\alpha} }&lt;/math&gt;

In this way, Enrico Fermi with collaborators, using the first nuclear reactor [[Chicago Pile-1]], obtained significant amounts of plutonium-239, which were then [[Manhattan Project|used in nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Actinides with the highest mass numbers are synthesized by bombarding uranium, plutonium, curium and californium with [[ion]]s of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, neon or boron in a [[particle accelerator]]. So, [[nobelium]] was produced by bombarding [[uranium-238]] with [[neon-22]] as
: &lt;math&gt;~\mathrm{{}_{~92}^{238}{}U+{}_{10}^{22}{}Ne \longrightarrow {}_{102}^{256}{}No+4{}_0^1{}n}&lt;/math&gt;.

First isotopes of transplutonium elements, [[americium-241]] and [[curium-242]], were synthesized in 1944 by Glenn T. Seaborg, Ralph A. James and [[Albert Ghiorso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The New Chemistry: A Showcase for Modern Chemistry and Its Applications|first = Nina|last = Hall|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2000|pages = 8–9|isbn = 9780521452243|url = http://books.google.com/?id=U4rnzH9QbT4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curium-242 was obtained by bombarding [[plutonium-239]] with 32-MeV α-particles
: &lt;math&gt;~\mathrm{{}_{~94}^{239}{}Pu+{}_2^4{}He \longrightarrow {}_{~96}^{242}{}Cm+{}_0^1{}n}&lt;/math&gt;.

The americium-241 and curium-242 isotopes also were produced by irradiating plutonium in a nuclear reactor.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBE&quot;/&gt; The latter element was named after [[Marie Curie]] and her husband [[Pierre Curie|Pierre]] who are noted for discovering [[radium]] and for their work in [[radioactivity]]. 

Bombarding [[curium-242]] with α-particles resulted in an isotope of californium [[Californium-245|&lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Cf]] (1950), and a similar procedure yielded in 1949 [[berkelium-243]] from americium-241.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = S.

[[Einsteinium]] and [[fermium]] were identified in 1952–1953 in the fallout from the &quot;[[Ivy Mike]]&quot; nuclear test (1 November 1952), the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb. Instantaneous exposure of [[uranium-238]] to a large neutron flux resulting from the explosion produced heavy isotopes of uranium, including uranium-253 and uranium-255, and their [[Beta decay|β-decay]] yielded [[einsteinium-253]] and [[fermium-255]]. The discovery of the new elements and the new data on neutron capture were initially kept secret on the orders of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;military until 1955 due to [[Cold War]] tensions.&lt;ref name = &quot;PhysRev.99.1048&quot; &gt;{{cite journal|title = New Elements Einsteinium and Fermium, Atomic Numbers 99 and 100

There were several attempts to obtain isotopes of [[nobelium]] by Swedish (1957) and American (1958) groups, but the first reliable results was the synthesis of [[Nobelium-256|&lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;No]] by the Russian group ([[Georgy Flyorov]] ''et al.'') in 1965, as acknowledges by the [[IUPAC]] in 1992. In their experiments, Flyorov ''et al.'' bombarded uranium-238 with neon-22.&lt;ref name=g1252/&gt; 

In 1961, Ghiorso ''et al.'' obtained the first isotope of lawrencium by irradiating [[californium]] (mostly [[californium-252]]) with [[boron-10]] and [[boron-11]] ions.&lt;ref name=g1252/&gt; The [[mass number]] of this isotope was not clearly established (possibly 258 or 259) at the time. In 1965, [[Lawrencium-256|&lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Lr]] were synthesized by Flyorov ''et al.'' from [[Americium-243|&lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am]] and [[oxygen-18|&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]]. Thus IUPAC recognized the nuclear physics teams at Dubna and Berkeley as the co-discoverers of lawrencium.

Thirty one [[isotopes of actinium]] and 8 excited [[nuclear isomerism|isomeric states]] of some of its [[nuclide]]s were identified by 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nubase2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://amdc.in2p3.fr/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf|title=The Nubase evaluation of nuclear and decay properties|author = G.

Actinium-225 is a member of radioactive [[Decay_chain#Neptunium_series|neptunium series]];&lt;ref name=g1254&gt;Greenwood, p. 1254&lt;/ref&gt; it was first discovered in 1947 as a fission product of [[uranium-233]], it is an α-emitter with a half-life of 10 days. Actinium-225 is less available than actinium-228, but is more promising in radiotracer applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Himiya aktiniya&quot; /&gt; Actinium-227 (half-life 21.77 years) occurs in all uranium ores, but in small quantities. One gram of uranium (in radioactive equilibrium) contains only 2{{e|-10}} gram of &lt;sup&gt;227&lt;/sup&gt;Ac.&lt;ref name=&quot;Himiya aktiniya&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nubase2003&quot; /&gt; Actinium-228 is a member of [[Radioactive_series#Thorium_series|radioactive thorium series]] formed by the decay of [[Radium-228|&lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ra]];&lt;ref name=g1254/&gt; it is a β&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; emitter with a half-life of 6.15 hours. In one tonne of thorium there is 5{{e|-8}} gram of &lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ac. It was discovered by [[Otto Hahn]] in 1906.&lt;ref name=&quot;Himiya aktiniya&quot; /&gt;

Twenty nine [[isotopes of protactinium]] are known with mass numbers 212–240&lt;ref name=&quot;Nubase2003&quot; /&gt; as well as three excited [[nuclear isomerism|isomeric states]]. Only [[protactinium-231|&lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa]] and [[protactinium-234|&lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;Pa]] have been found in nature. All the isotopes have short lifetime, except for protactinium-231 (half-life 32,760 years). The most important isotopes are &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa and [[protactinium-233|&lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;Pa]], which is an intermediate product in obtaining uranium-233 and is the most affordable among artificial isotopes of protactinium. &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;Pa has convenient half-life and energy of [[Gamma radiation|γ-radiation]], and thus was used in most studies of protactinium chemistry. Protactinium-233 is a [[Beta radiation|β-emitter]] with a half-life of 26.97 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nubase2003&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Himiya protaktiniya&quot; /&gt;

Uranium has the highest number (25) of both natural and synthetic [[Isotopes of uranium|isotopes]]. They have mass numbers of 217–242,&lt;ref name=&quot;tablitsa MAGATE&quot;/&gt; and three of them, [[Uranium-234|&lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U]], &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U, are present in appreciable quantities in nature. Among others, the most important is &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U, which is a final product of transformations of [[Thorium-232|&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th]] irradiated by slow neutrons. &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U has a very higher fission efficiency by low-energy (thermal) neutrons, compared e.g. with &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. Most uranium chemistry studies were carried out on uranium-238 owing to its long half-life of 4.4{{e|9}} years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Analiticheskaya chemistry urana&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=I.P. Alimarin ''et al.''|title = Analytical chemistry of uranium|editor=A.P. Vinogradov|location = Moscow|publisher = Publisher USSR Academy of Sciences|year = 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 19 [[isotopes of neptunium]] with mass numbers from 225 to 244;&lt;ref name=&quot;tablitsa MAGATE&quot;/&gt; they are all highly radioactive. The most popular among scientists are long-lived &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np (t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.20{{e|6}} years) and short-lived &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Np, &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Np (t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 2 days).&lt;ref name=&quot;Himiya neptuniya&quot;/&gt;

Sixteen [[isotopes of americium]] are known with mass numbers from 232 to 248.&lt;ref name=&quot;tablitsa MAGATE&quot;/&gt; The most important are &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am and &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am, which are alpha-emitters and also emit soft, but intense γ-rays; both of them can be obtained in an isotopically pure form. Chemical properties of americium were first studied with &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am, but later shifted to &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am, which is almost 20 times less radioactive. The disadvantage of &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am is production of the short-lived daughter isotope &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Np, which has to be considered in the data analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBE&quot;/&gt;

Among 19 [[isotopes of curium]],&lt;ref name=&quot;tablitsa MAGATE&quot;/&gt; the most accessible are &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm; they are α-emitters, but with much shorter lifetime than the americium isotopes. These isotopes emit almost no γ-radiation, but undergo [[spontaneous fission]] with the associated emission of neutrons. More long-lived isotopes of curium (&lt;sup&gt;245–248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, all α-emitters) are formed as a mixture during neutron irradiation of plutonium or americium. Upon short irradiation, this mixture is dominated by curium-246, and then curium-248 begins to accumulate. Both of these isotopes, especially &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, have a longer half-life (3.48{{e|5}} years) and are much more convenient for carrying out chemical research than &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, but they also have a rather high rate of spontaneous fission. &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Cm has the longest lifetime among isotopes of curium (1.56{{e|7}} years), but is not formed in large quantities because of the strong fission induced by thermal neutrons.

Fourteen [[isotopes of berkelium]] were identified with mass numbers 238–252.&lt;ref name=&quot;tablitsa MAGATE&quot;/&gt; Only &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Bk is available in large quantities; it has a relatively short half-life of 330 days and emits mostly soft [[Beta decay|β-particles]], which are inconvenient for detection. Its [[alpha radiation]] is rather weak (1.45{{e|-3}}% with respect to β-radiation), but is sometimes used to detect this isotope. &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Bk is an alpha-emitter with a long half-life of 1,380 years, but it is hard to obtain in appreciable quantities; it is not formed upon neutron irradiation of plutonium because of the β-stability of isotopes of curium isotopes with mass number below 248.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBE&quot;/&gt;

[[Isotopes of californium]] with mass numbers 237–256 are formed in nuclear reactors;&lt;ref name=&quot;tablitsa MAGATE&quot;/&gt; californium-253 is a β-emitter and the rest are α-emitters. The isotopes with even mass numbers (&lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Cf, &lt;sup&gt;252&lt;/sup&gt;Cf and &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Cf) have a high rate of spontaneous fission, especially &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Cf of which 99.7% decays by spontaneous fission. Californium-249 has a relatively long half-life (352 years), weak spontaneous fission and strong γ-emission that facilitates its identification. &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Cf is not formed in large quantities in a nuclear reactor because of the slow β-decay of the parent isotope &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Bk and a large cross section of interaction with neutrons, but it can be accumulated in the isotopically pure form as the β-decay product of (pre-selected) &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Bk. Californium produced by reactor-irradiation of plutonium mostly consists of &lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Cf and &lt;sup&gt;252&lt;/sup&gt;Cf, the latter being predominant for large neutron fluences, and its study is hindered by the strong neutron radiation.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBE&quot;/&gt;

Among the 16 known [[isotopes of einsteinium]] with mass numbers from 241 to 257&lt;ref name=&quot;tablitsa MAGATE&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www-nds.iaea.org/relnsd/vcharthtml/VChartHTML.html|title = Table of nuclides, IAEA|accessdate = 2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most affordable is &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es. It is an α-emitter with a half-life of 20.47 days, a relatively weak γ-emission and small spontaneous fission rate as compared with the isotopes of californium. Prolonged neutron irradiation also produces a long-lived isotope &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Es (t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; = 275.5 days).&lt;ref name=&quot;TBE&quot;/&gt;

Nineteen [[isotopes of fermium]] are known with mass numbers of 242–260. &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Fm, &lt;sup&gt;255&lt;/sup&gt;Fm and &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Fm are [[Alpha radiation|α-emitters]] with a short half-life (hours), which can be isolated in significant amounts. &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;Fm (t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; = 100 days) can accumulate upon prolonged and strong irradiation. All these isotopes are characterized by high rates of spontaneous fission.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBE&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tablitsa izotopov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://elm.e-science.ru/|title = Table of elements, compounds, isotopes|language = Russian|accessdate = 2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the 15 known [[isotopes of mendelevium]] (mass numbers from 245 to 260),&lt;ref name=&quot;tablitsa MAGATE&quot;/&gt; the most studied is &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Md, which mainly decays through the electron capture (α-radiation is ≈10%) with the half-life of 77 minutes. Another alpha emitter, &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;Md, has a half-life of 53 days. Both these isotopes are produced from rare einsteinium (&lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es and &lt;sup&gt;255&lt;/sup&gt;Es respectively), that limits their so their availability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nubase2003&quot;/&gt;

Long-lived [[isotopes of nobelium]] and [[isotopes of lawrencium]] (and of heavier elements) have relatively small half-lives. For nobelium 11 isotopes are known with mass numbers 250–260 and 262. Chemical properties of nobelium and lawrencium were studied with &lt;sup&gt;255&lt;/sup&gt;No (t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; = 3 min) and &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Lr (t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; = 35 s). The longest-lived nobelium isotope &lt;sup&gt;259&lt;/sup&gt;No has a half-life of 1.5 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nubase2003&quot;/&gt;

The isotopic composition of natural uranium is [[Uranium-238|&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U]] (relative abundance 99.2742%), [[Uranium-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]] (0.7204%) and [[Uranium-234|&lt;sup&gt;234&lt;/sup&gt;U]] (0.0054%); of these &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U has the largest half-life of 4.51{{e|9}} years.&lt;ref name=crc&gt;{{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yu.

Other important uranium mining countries are [[Canada]] (20.1%), [[Australia]] (15.7%), [[Namibia]] (9.1%), [[Russia]] (7.0%), and [[Niger]] (6.4%).&lt;ref name=&quot;WNA-WUM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf23.html|title=World Uranium Mining|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most abundant [[:Category:Thorium minerals|thorium minerals]] are [[thorianite]] (ThO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[thorite]] (ThSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[monazite]], (([[Thorium|Th]], [[Calcium|Ca]], [[Cerium|Ce]])PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

The abundance of actinium in the Earth's crust is only about 5{{e|-15}}%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Himiya protaktiniya&quot;/&gt; Actinium is mostly present in uranium-containing, but also in other minerals, though in much smaller quantities. The content of actinium in most natural objects corresponds to the isotopic equilibrium of parent isotope &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U, and it is not affected by the weak Ac migration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Himiya aktiniya&quot; /&gt; Protactinium is more abundant (10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;%) in the Earth's crust than actinium. It was discovered in the uranium ore in 1913 by Fajans and Göhring.&lt;ref name=fajans/&gt; As actinium, the distribution of protactinium follows that of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U.&lt;ref name=&quot;Himiya protaktiniya&quot;/&gt;

The half-life of the longest-lived isotope of neptunium, [[Neptunium-237|&lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np]], is negligible compared to the age of the Earth. Thus neptunium is present in nature in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Himiya neptuniya&quot;/&gt; Traces of plutonium in uranium minerals were first found in 1942, and the more systematic results on &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu are summarized in the table (no other plutonium isotopes could be detected in those samples). The upper limit of abundance of the longest-living isotope of plutonium, &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Pu, is 3{{e|-20}}%. Plutonium could not be detected in samples of lunar soil. Owing to its scarcity in nature, most plutonium is produced synthetically.&lt;ref name=&quot;katz&quot;/&gt;

==Extraction==
[[File:MonaziteUSGOV.jpg|thumb|Monazite—a major thorium mineral]]
Owing to the low abundance of actinides, their extraction is a complex, multistep process. [[Fluoride]]s of actinides are usually used because they are insoluble in water and can be easily separated with [[redox]] reactions. Fluorides are reduced with [[calcium]], [[magnesium]] or [[barium]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;Golub&quot;/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;~\mathrm{2AmF_3+3Ba \ \xrightarrow{1150-1350^\circ C} \ 3BaF_2+2Am}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;~\mathrm{PuF_4+2Ba \ \xrightarrow{1200^\circ C} \ 2BaF_2+Pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;~\mathrm{UF_4+2Mg \ \xrightarrow{&gt;500^\circ C} \ U+2MgF_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Among the actinides, thorium and uranium are the easiest to isolate. Thorium is extracted mostly from [[monazite]]: thorium diphosphate (Th(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is reacted with [[nitric acid]], and the produced thorium nitrate treated with [[tributyl phosphate]]. [[Rare earth element|Rare-earth]] impurities are separated by increasing the [[pH]] in sulfate solution.

Monazite is decomposed with a 45% aqueous solution of [[sodium hydroxide]] at 140 °C. Mixed metal hydroxides are extracted first, filtered at 80 °C, washed with water and dissolved with concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]]. Next, the acidic solution is neutralized with hydroxides to pH = 5.8 that results in precipitation of thorium hydroxide (Th(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) contaminated with ~3% of rare-earth hydroxides; the rest of rare-earth hydroxides remains in solution. Thorium hydroxide is dissolved in an inorganic acid and then purified from the [[rare earth element]]s. An efficient method is the dissolution of thorium hydroxide in nitric acid, because the resulting solution can be purified by [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extraction]] with organic solvents:&lt;ref name = &quot;Golub&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Plutonium and uranium extraction from nuclear fuel-eng.svg|thumb|450px|left|Separation of uranium and plutonium from nuclear fuel&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, pp. 1255, 1261&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Th(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Th(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Metallic thorium is separated from the anhydrous oxide, chloride or fluoride by reacting it with calcium in an inert atmosphere:&lt;ref name=g1255/&gt;

ThO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 Ca → 2 CaO + Th

Sometimes thorium is extracted by [[electrolysis]] of a fluoride in a mixture of sodium and potassium chloride at 700–800 °C in a [[graphite]] crucible. Highly pure thorium can be extracted from its iodide with the [[crystal bar process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1002/zaac.19251480133|title = Darstellung von reinem Titanium-, Zirkonium-, Hafnium- und Thoriummetall|first = A. E.|last = van Arkel|coauthors = de Boer, J. H.|volume = 148|issue = 1|pages =345–350|year = 1925|journal = Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uranium is extracted from its ores in various ways. In one method, the ore is burned and then reacted with nitric acid to convert uranium into a dissolved state. Treating the solution with a solution of tributyl phosphate (TBP) in kerosene transforms uranium into an organic form UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NCS)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·2TBP. The insoluble impurities are filtered and the uranium is extracted by reaction with hydroxides as (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; or with [[hydrogen peroxide]] as UO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golub&quot;/&gt;

When the uranium ore is rich in such minerals as [[dolomite]], [[magnesite]], etc., those minerals consume much acid. In this case, the carbonate method is used for uranium extraction. Its main component is an aqueous solution of [[sodium carbonate]], which converts uranium into a complex [UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4–&lt;/sup&gt;, which is stable in aqueous solutions at low concentrations of hydroxide ions. The advantages of the sodium carbonate method are that the chemicals have low [[Corrosion|corrosivity]] (compared to nitrates) and that most non-uranium metals precipitate from the solution. The disadvantage is that tetravalent uranium compounds precipitate as well. Therefore, the uranium ore is treated with sodium carbonate at elevated temperature and under oxygen pressure:
:2 UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt; → 2 [UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4–&lt;/sup&gt;
This equation suggests that the best solvent for the uranium carbonate processing is a mixture of carbonate with bicarbonate. At high pH, this results in precipitation of diuranate, which is treated with [[hydrogen]] in the presence of [[nickel]] yielding an insoluble uranium tetracarbonate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golub&quot;/&gt;

Another separation method uses polymeric resins as a [[polyelectrolyte]]. Ion exchange processes in the resins result in separation of uranium. Uranium from resins is washed with a solution of [[ammonium nitrate]] or nitric acid that yields [[uranyl]] nitrate, UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. When heated, it turns into UO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is converted to UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with hydrogen:
: UO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Reacting uranium dioxide with [[fluoric acid]] changes it to [[uranium tetrafluoride]], which yields uranium metal upon reaction with magnesium metal:&lt;ref name=g1255/&gt;
: 4 HF + UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → UF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

To extract plutonium, neutron-irradiated uranium is dissolved in nitric acid, and a reducing agent ([[Iron(II) sulfate|FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], or [[hydrogen peroxide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) is added to the resulting solution. This addition changes the oxidation state of plutonium from +6 to +4, while uranium remains in the form of uranyl nitrate (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The solution is treated with a reducing agent and neutralized with [[ammonium carbonate]] to pH = 8 that results in precipitation of Pu&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golub&quot;/&gt;

In another method, Pu&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;and UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; are first extracted with tributyl phosphate, then reacted with [[hydrazine]] washing out the recovered plutonium.&lt;ref name = &quot;Golub&quot; /&gt;

The major difficulty in separation of actinium is the similarity of its properties with those of lanthanum. Thus actinium is either synthesized in nuclear reactions from isotopes of radium or separated using ion-exchange procedures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Himiya aktiniya&quot; /&gt;

==Properties==
Actinides have similar properties to lanthanides. The 6[[d-block|''d'']] and 7[[s-block|''s'']] electronic shells are completed in actinium and thorium, and the 5[[f-block|''f'' shell]] is being filled with further increase in atomic number; the 4''f'' shell is filled in the lanthanides. The first experimental evidence for the filling of the 5''f'' shell in actinides was obtained by McMillan and Abelson in 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;I. L. Knunyants&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author = I.L. Knunyants ''et al.''|title = Short Chemical Encyclopedia| place =Moscow|publisher = Soviet Encyclopedia|year = 1961|volume = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in lanthanides (see [[lanthanide contraction]]), the [[ionic radius]] of actinides monotonically decreases with atomic number (see also [[Aufbau principle]]).&lt;ref name = &quot;Golub&quot;/&gt;

Actinides are typical [[metal]]s. All of them are soft and have a silvery color (but tarnish in air),&lt;ref name=g1264&gt;Greenwood, p. 1264&lt;/ref&gt; relatively high [[density]] and plasticity. Some of them can be cut with a knife. Their [[electrical resistivity]] varies between 15 and 150 µOhm·cm.&lt;ref name=g1263/&gt; The hardness of thorium is similar to that of soft [[steel]], so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire. Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium, but is harder than either of them. All actinides are radioactive, [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]], and, with the exception of actinium, have several crystalline phases: plutonium has seven, and uranium, neptunium and californium three. [[Crystal structure]]s of protactinium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanide and are more similar to those of the 3''d''-[[transition metal]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yu.

All actinides are [[Pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]], especially when finely divided, that is, they spontaneously ignite upon reaction with air.&lt;ref name=g1264/&gt; The [[melting point]] of actinides does not have a clear dependence on the number of ''f''-electrons.

===Chemical properties===
Like the lanthanides, all actinides are highly reactive with [[halogen]]s and [[chalcogen]]s; however, actinides react more easily. Actinides, especially those with a small number of 5''f''-electrons, are prone to [[Hybridization (chemistry)|hybridization]]. This is explained by the similarity of the electron energies at the 5''f'', 7''s'' and 6''d'' shells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golub&quot;/&gt; Most actinides exhibit a larger variety of valence states, and the most stable are +6 for uranium, +5 for protactinium and neptunium, +4 for thorium and plutonium and +3 for actinium and other actinides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golub&quot;/&gt;

Chemically, actinium is similar to lanthanum, which is explained by their similar ionic radii and electronic structure. Like lanthanum, actinium has oxidation of +3, but it is less reactive and has more pronounced [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] properties. Among other trivalent actinides Ac&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is least acidic, i.e. has the weakest tendency to hydrolyze in aqueous solutions.&lt;ref name = &quot;Himiya aktiniya&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yu. D. Tretyakov&quot;/&gt;

Thorium is rather active chemically. Owing to lack of [[electron]]s on 6''d''-and 4''f''-orbitals, the tetravalent thorium compounds are colorless. At pH &lt; 3, the solutions of thorium salts are dominated by the cations [Th(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;. The Th&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is relatively large, and depending on the [[coordination number]] can have a radius between 0.95 and 1.14 Å. As a result, thorium salts have a weak tendency to a hydrolysis. The distinctive ability of thorium salts is their high solubility, not only in water, but also in polar organic solvents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yu. D. Tretyakov&quot;/&gt;

[[Protactinium]] exhibits two valence states; the +5 is stable, and the +4 state easily oxidizes to protactinium(V). Thus tetravalent protactinium in solutions is obtained by the action of strong reducing agents in a hydrogen atmosphere. Tetravalent protactinium is chemically similar to U&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; and thorium. Fluorides, phosphates, hypophosphate, iodate and phenylarsonates of Pa&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; are insoluble in water and dilute acids. Protactinium forms soluble carbonates. The hydrolytic properties of pentavalent protactinium are close to those of [[tantalum]](V) and [[niobium]](V). The complex chemical behavior of protactinium is a consequence of the start of the filling of the 5''f'' shell in this element.&lt;ref name=&quot;Himiya protaktiniya&quot; /&gt;

Uranium has a valence from 3 to 6, the last being most stable. In the hexavalent state, uranium is very similar to the sixth group elements. Many compounds of uranium(IV) and uranium(VI) are nonstoichiometric, i.e. have variable composition. For example, the actual chemical formula of uranium dioxide is UO&lt;sub&gt;2+x&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''x'' varies between −0.4 and 0.32. Uranium(VI) compounds are weak [[Oxidizing agent|oxidants]]. Most of them contain the linear &quot;[[uranyl]]&quot; group, UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Between 4 to 6 ligands can be accommodated in an equatorial plane perpendicular to the uranyl group. The uranyl group acts as a [[hard acid]] and forms stronger complexes with oxygen-donor ligands than with nitrogen-donor ligands. NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; are also the common form of Np and Pu in the +6 oxidation state. Uranium(IV) compounds exhibit reducing properties, e.g., they are easily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. Uranium(III) is a very strong reducing agent. Owing to the presence of d-shell, uranium (as well as many other actinides) forms [[organometallic compound]]s, such as U&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and U&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yu. D. Tretyakov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=g1278&gt;Greenwood, p. 1278&lt;/ref&gt;

Neptunium has valence states from 3 to 7, which can be simultaneously observed in solutions. The most stable state in solution is +5, but the valence +4 is preferred in solid neptunium compounds. Neptunium metal is very reactive. Ions of neptunium are prone to hydrolysis and formation of [[coordination compound]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Himiya neptuniya&quot; /&gt;

Plutonium also exhibits the valence between 3 and 7, and thus is chemically similar to neptunium and uranium. It is highly reactive, and quickly forms an oxide film in air. Plutonium reacts with [[hydrogen]] even at temperatures as low as 25–50 °C; it also easily forms [[halide]]s and [[intermetallic compound]]s. Hydrolysis reactions of plutonium ions of different oxidation states are quite diverse. Plutonium(V) can enter [[polymerization]] reactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutoniy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Himiya plutoniya&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author = M. S. Milyukova ''et al.''|title = Analytical chemistry of plutonium| place =Moscow|publisher = Nauka|year = 1965|isbn = 0250399180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest chemical diversity among actinides is observed in americium, which can have valence between 2 and 6. Divalent americium is obtained only in dry compounds and non-aqueous solutions ([[acetonitrile]]). Oxidation states +3, +5 and +6 are typical for aqueous solutions, but also in the solid state. Tetravalent americium forms stable solid compounds (dioxide, fluoride and hydroxide) as well as complexes in aqueous solutions. It was reported that in alkaline solution americium can be oxidized to the heptavalent state, but these data proved to be erroneous. The most stable valence of americium is 3 in the aqueous solutions and 3 or 4 in solid compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBE&quot;/&gt;

Valence 3 is dominant in all subsequent elements up to lawrencium (with the possible exception of nobelium). Curium can be tetravalent in solids (fluoride, dioxide). Berkelium, along with a valence of +3, also shows the valence of +4, more stable than that of curium; the valence 4 is observed in solid fluoride and dioxide. The stability of Bk&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; in aqueous solution is close to that of [[Cerium|Ce]]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;. Only valence 3 was observed for californium, einsteinium and fermium. Bivalent state is proven for mendelevium and nobelium, and in nobelium it is more stable than the trivalent state. Lawrencium shows valence 3 both in solutions and solids. Rutherfordium chloride behaves similar to [[hafnium chloride]], i.e. might contain tetravalent rutherfordium.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBE&quot;/&gt;

The redox potential &lt;math&gt;~E_\frac{M^{4+}}{AnO^{2+}_{2}}&lt;/math&gt; increases from −0.32 V in uranium, through 0.34 V (Np) and 1.04 V (Pu) to 1.34 V in americium revealing the increasing reduction ability of the An&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ion from americium to uranium. All actinides form AnH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; hydrides of black color with salt-like properties. Actinides also produce [[carbide]]s with the general formula of AnC or AnC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for uranium) as well as sulfides An&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and AnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Golub&quot;/&gt;

Some actinides can exists in various oxide forms: An&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, AnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, An&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and AnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. For all actinides, oxides AnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are [[Amphoterism|amphoteric]] and An&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, AnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and An&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; are basic, they easily react with water, forming bases:&lt;ref name=&quot;Golub&quot;/&gt;

: An&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 An(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
These bases are poorly soluble in water and by their activity are close to the [[hydroxide]]s of rare-earth metals. The strongest base is of actinium. All compounds of actinium are colorless, except for black [[actinium sulfide]] (Ac&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name = &quot;Golub&quot;/&gt; Dioxides of tetravalent actinides crystallize in the [[cubic system]], same as in [[calcium fluoride]].

Thorium reacting with oxygen exclusively forms dioxide:
: &lt;math&gt;~\mathrm{Th+O_2 \ \xrightarrow{1000^\circ C} \ ThO_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Thorium dioxide is a refractory material with the highest melting point among any known oxide (3390 °C).&lt;ref name=g1268&gt;Greenwood, p. 1268&lt;/ref&gt; Adding 0.8–1% ThO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;to tungsten stabilizes its structure, so the doped filaments have better mechanical stability to vibrations. To dissolve ThO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;acids, it is heated to 500–600 °C; heating above 600 °C produces a very resistant to acids and other reagents form of ThO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Small addition of fluoride ions [[Catalyst|catalyses]] dissolution of thorium dioxide in acids. 

Two protactinium oxides were obtained: PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (black) and Pa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(white); the former is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] with ThO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the latter is easier to obtain. Both oxides are basic, and Pa(OH)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is a weak, poorly soluble base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golub&quot;/&gt;

Decomposition of certain salts of uranium, for example UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)·6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in air at 400 °C, yields orange or yellow UO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=g1268/&gt; This oxide is amphoteric and forms several hydroxides, the most stable being UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. 
Reaction of uranium(VI) oxide with hydrogen results in uranium dioxide, which is similar in its properties with ThO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This oxide is also basic and corresponds to the uranium hydroxide (U(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Golub&quot;/&gt;

Plutonium, neptunium and americium form two basic oxides: An&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and AnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Neptunium trioxide is unstable, thus only Np&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; could be obtained so far. However, the oxides of plutonium and neptunium with the chemical formula AnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and An&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are well characterized.&lt;ref name = &quot;Golub&quot;/&gt;

Actinides easily react with halogens forming salts with the formulas MX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and MX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (X = [[halogen]]). So the first berkelium compound, BkCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, was synthesized in 1962 with an amount of 3 nanogram. Like the halogens of rare earth elements, actinide [[chloride]]s, [[bromide]]s, and [[iodide]]s are water soluble, and [[fluoride]]s are insoluble. Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride, which [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimates]] at a temperature of 56.5 °C; because of its volatility, it is used in the separation of uranium isotopes with [[gas centrifuge]] or [[gaseous diffusion]]. Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to [[anhydride]]s. They are very sensitive to moisture and hydrolyze forming AnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=g1269&gt;Greenwood, p.1269&lt;/ref&gt; Pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized, but they are both unstable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golub&quot;/&gt;

Action of acids on actinides yields salts, and if the acids are non-oxidizing then the actinide in the salt is in low-valence state:
: U + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → U (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
: 2 Pu + 6 HCl → 2 PuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
However, in these reactions the regenerating hydrogen can react with the metal, forming the corresponding hydride. Uranium reacts with acids and water much easier than thorium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golub&quot;/&gt;

Actinide salts can also be obtained by dissolving the corresponding hydroxides in acids. Nitrates, chlorides, sulfates and perchlorates of actinides are water soluble. When crystallizing from aqueous solutions, these salts forming a hydrates, such as Th(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, Th(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·9H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and Pu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Salts of high-valence actinides easily hydrolyze. So, colorless sulfate, chloride, perchlorate and nitrate of thorium transform into basic salts with formulas Th(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SOsub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Th(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The solubility and insolubility of trivalent and tetravalent actinides is like that of lanthanide salts. So [[phosphate]]s, [[fluoride]]s, [[oxalate]]s, [[iodate]]s and [[carbonates]] of actinides are weakly soluble in water; they precipitate as hydrates, such as ThF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and Th(CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golub&quot;/&gt;

Actinides with oxidation state +6, except for the AnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-type cations, form [AnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt;, [An&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt; and other complex anions. For example, uranium, neptunium and plutonium form salts of the Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;UO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (uranate) and (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (diuranate) types. In comparison with lanthanides, actinides easier form [[coordination compounds]], and this ability increases with the actinide valence. Trivalent actinides do not form fluoride coordination compounds, whereas tetravalent thorium forms K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ThF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, KThF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and even K&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;ThF&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; complexes. Thorium also forms the corresponding [[sulfate]]s (for example Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·Th (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[nitrate]]s and thiocyanates. Salts with the general formula An&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Th(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;·''n''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are of coordination nature, with the [[coordination number]] of thorium equal to 12. Even easier is to produce complex salts of pentavalent and hexavalent actinides. The most stable coordination compounds of actinides – tetravalent thorium and uranium – are obtained in reactions with diketones, e.g. [[acetylacetone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Golub&quot;/&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:InsideSmokeDetector.jpg|thumb|Inside of a [[smoke detector]] containing [[americium-241]].]]
While actinides have some established daily-life applications, such as in smoke detectors (americium)&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/19960101-re_/http://www.uic.com.au/nip35.htm Smoke Detectors and Americium], Nuclear Issues Briefing Paper 35, May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=g1262&gt;Greenwood, p. 1262&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gas mantle]]s (thorium),&lt;ref name=g1255&gt;Greenwood, p. 1255&lt;/ref&gt; they are mostly used in [[nuclear weapon]]s and use as a [[nuclear fuel|fuel]] in [[nuclear reactor]]s.&lt;ref name=g1255/&gt; The last two areas exploit the property of actinides to release enormous energy in [[nuclear reaction]]s, which under certain conditions may become self-sustaining [[Nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]].

[[File:KKG Reactor Core.jpg|thumb|left|Self-illumination of a nuclear reactor by the [[Cherenkov radiation]].]]
The most important isotope for [[nuclear energy]] applications is [[uranium-235]]. It is used in the most popular [[thermal reactor]], and its concentration in natural uranium does not exceed 0.72%. This isotope strongly absorbs [[thermal neutron]]s releasing much energy. One fission act of 1&amp;nbsp;gram of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U converts into about 1 MW·day. Important is that &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U emits more neutrons than it absorbs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golub&quot;/&gt; Upon reaching the [[critical mass]], &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U enters into a self-sustaining chain reaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yu. D. Tretyakov&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor=Yu.D. Tretyakov|title = Non-organic chemistry in three volumes| place =Moscow|publisher = Academy|year = 2007|volume = 3|series = Chemistry of transition elements|isbn = 5-7695-2533-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, uranium nucleus is divided into two fragments with the release of 2–3 neutrons, for example:
: &lt;math&gt;~\mathrm{{}_{~}^{235}U+ \ ^1_0n \longrightarrow {}_{~}^{115}Rh+{}_{~}^{118}Ag + 3^1_0n}&lt;/math&gt;

Other promising actinide isotopes for nuclear energy are [[thorium-232]] and its fission product, formed [[uranium-233]].

| &lt;small&gt; The core of any nuclear reactor contains a set of hollow metal rods, usually made of [[zirconium]] alloys, filled with [[nuclear fuel]] cells – mostly oxide, carbide, nitride or monosulfide of uranium, plutonium or thorium, or their mixture (the so-called [[MOX fuel]]). The most common fuel is oxide of [[uranium-235]].
[[File:Heterogeneous reactor scheme.png|border|150px|left|Nuclear reactor scheme]]
[[Neutron temperature|Fast neutrons]] are slowed by [[Moderator (Nuclear Reactor)|moderators]], which contain water, [[carbon]], [[deuterium]], or [[beryllium]], as [[thermal neutrons]] to increase the efficiency of their interaction with uranium-235. The rate of nuclear reaction is controlled by introducing additional rods made of [[boron]] or [[cadmium]] or a liquid absorbent, usually [[boric acid]]. Reactors for plutonium production are called [[breeder reactor]] or breeders; they have a different design and use fast neutrons.&lt;/small&gt;

Emission of neutrons during the fission of uranium is important not only for maintaining the nuclear chain reaction, but also for the synthesis of the heavier actinides. [[Uranium-239]] converts via [[Beta decay|β-decay]] into plutonium-239, which, like uranium-235, is capable of spontaneous fission. The world's first nuclear reactors were built not for energy, but for producing plutonium-239 for nuclear weapons.

About half of the produced thorium is used as the light-emitting material of gas mantles.&lt;ref name=g1255/&gt; Thorium is also added into multicomponent [[alloy]]s of [[magnesium]] and [[zinc]]. So the Mg-Th alloys are light and strong, but also have high melting point and ductility and thus are widely used in the aviation industry and in the production of [[missile]]s. Thorium also has good [[electron emission]] properties, with long lifetime and low potential barrier for the emission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golub&quot;/&gt; The relative content of thorium and uranium isotopes is widely used to estimate the age of various objects, including stars (see [[:Category:Radiometric dating|radiometric dating]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Sergey Popov, Alexander Sergeev|title = Universal Alchemy|url = http://www.vokrugsveta.ru/vs/article/6214/|language = Russian|journal=Vokrug Sveta|year = 2008|volume = 2811|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutonium-238]] is potentially more efficient isotope for nuclear reactors, as it has smaller critical mass than uranium-235, but releases much more thermal energy (0.56 W/g).&lt;ref name=g1262/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nti.org/e_research/cnwm/overview/technical2.asp Nuclear Weapons Design &amp; Materials]&lt;/ref&gt; However, its application is limited by the high price (about 1000 USD/g). This isotope has been used in [[thermopile]]s and water [[distillation]] systems of some space satellites and stations. So [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]] and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] spacecrafts (e.g. [[Apollo 14]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/A14_PressKit.pdf Apollo 14 Press Kit – 01/11/71], NASA, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;) had heaters powered by kilogram quantities of plutonium-238 oxide; this heat is also transformed into electricity with thermopiles. The decay of plutonium-238 is produced relatively harmless alpha particles and is not accompanied by gamma-irradiation. Therefore and this isotope (~160&amp;nbsp;mg) is used as the energy source in heart pacemakers where it lasts about 5 times longer than conventional batteries.&lt;ref name=g1262/&gt;

[[Actinium-227]] is used as a neutron source. Its high specific energy (14.5 W/g) and the possibility of obtaining significant quantities of thermally stable compounds are attractive for use in long-lasting thermoelectric generators for remote use. &lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ac is used as an indicator of [[radioactivity]] in chemical research, as it emits high-energy electrons (2.18 MeV) that can be easily detected. [[Actinium-228|&lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ac]]-[[Radium-228|&lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ra]] mixtures are widely used as an intense gamma-source in industry and medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Himiya aktiniya&quot;/&gt;

Radioactive substances can harm human health via (i) local skin contamination, (ii) internal exposure due to ingestion of radioactive isotopes, and (iii) external overexposure by β and γ-radiation. Together with radium and transuranium elements, actinium is one of the most dangerous radioactive poisons with high specific [[Alpha radiation|α-activity]]. The most important feature of actinium is its ability to accumulate and remain in the surface layer of [[skeleton]]s. At the initial stage of poisoning, actinium accumulates in the [[liver]]. Another danger of actinium is that it undergoes radioactive decay faster than being excreted. [[Adsorption]] from the digestive tract is much smaller (~0.05%) for actinium than radium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Himiya aktiniya&quot; /&gt;

Protactinium in the body tends to accumulate in the kidneys and bones. The maximum safe dose of Pa in the human body is 0.03 [[Curie (unit)|µCi]] that corresponds to 0.5 micrograms of &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa. This isotope, which might be present in the air as [[aerosol]], is 2.5{{e|8}} times more toxic than [[hydrocyanic acid]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Himiya protaktiniya&quot;/&gt;

Plutonium, when entering the body through air, food or blood (e.g. a wound), mostly settles in the lungs, liver and bones with only about 10% going to other organs, and remains there for decades. The long residence time of plutonium in the body is partly explained by its poor solubility in water. Some isotopes of plutonium emit ionizing α-radiation, which damages the surrounding cells. The [[median lethal dose]] (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection of plutonium is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass, and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22&amp;nbsp;mg for a person weighing 70&amp;nbsp;kg; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately 4 times greater. Another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than [[radium]], and thus permissible content of plutonium in the body should be 5&amp;nbsp;µg or 0.3 µCi. Such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope. After trials on animals, this maximum permissible dose was reduced to 0.65&amp;nbsp;µg or 0.04 µCi. Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous Pu exposure route is through inhalation, after which 5–25% of inhaled substances is retained in the body. Depending on the particle size and solubility of the plutonium compounds, Pu is localized either in the lungs or in the [[lymphatic system]], or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver and bones. Contamination via food is the least likely way. In this case, only about 0.05% of soluble 0.01% insoluble compounds of plutonium absorbs into blood, and the rest is excreted. Exposure of damaged skin to plutonium would retain nearly 100% of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutoniy&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor=B.A. Nadykto and L.F.

'''Arthur Asher Miller''' (October 17, 1915 &amp;ndash; February 10, 2005)&lt;ref name=&quot;guardobit&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2005/feb/11/usa.theatre1 Death of a playwright: legend Arthur Miller dies aged 89], a February 11, 2005 obituary from ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UMICH_Early&quot; /&gt; was an [[United States|American]] [[playwright]] and [[essayist]]. He was a prominent figure in [[Theater in the United States|American theatre]], writing [[drama]]s that include plays such as ''[[All My Sons]]'' (1947), ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' (1949), ''[[The Crucible]]'' (1953), and ''[[A View from the Bridge]]'' (one-act, 1955; revised two-act, 1956).

Miller was often in the public eye, particularly during the late 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s, a period during which he testified before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]], and was married to [[Marilyn Monroe]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Arthur Asher Miller was born on October 17, 1915, in [[Harlem]], [[New York City]], the second of three children of Isidore and Augusta Miller, Polish-[[Jewish]] immigrants.&lt;ref

The family, including his [[Joan Copeland|younger sister Joan]], lived on [[110th Street (Manhattan)|East 110th Street]] in [[Manhattan]] and owned a summer house in [[Far Rockaway, Queens]]. They employed a chauffeur.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/books/03garn.html Miller: Life before and after Marilyn]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the family lost almost everything and moved to [[Gravesend, Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot;&gt;The Times Arthur Miller Obituary, (London: The Times, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, Miller delivered bread every morning before school to help the family make ends meet.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt; After graduating in 1932 from [[Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn, New York)|Abraham Lincoln High School]], he worked at several menial jobs to pay for his college tuition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hechinger, Fred M.

At the [[University of Michigan]], Miller first majored in journalism and worked as a reporter and night editor for the student paper, the ''[[Michigan Daily]]''. It was during this time that he wrote his first play, ''[[No Villain]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The award brought him his first recognition and led him to begin to consider that he could have a career as a playwright.  Miller enrolled in a playwriting seminar taught by the influential [[Kenneth Thorpe Rowe|Professor Kenneth Rowe]], who instructed him in his early forays into playwriting;&lt;ref&gt;For Rowe's recollections of Miller's work as a student playwright, see Kenneth Thorpe Rowe, &quot;Shadows Cast Before,&quot; in Robert A. Martin, ed., ''Arthur Miller: New Perspectives'' (Prentice-Hall, 1982).  Rowe's influential book ''Write That Play'' (Funk and Wagnalls, 1939), which appeared just a year after Miller's graduation, describes Rowe's approach to play construction.&lt;/ref&gt; Rowe emphasized how a play is built in order to achieve its intended effect, or what Miller called &quot;the dynamics of play construction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Miller, ''Timebends: A Life.''  New York: Grove Press, 1987, pp. 226-227&lt;/ref&gt; Rowe provided realistic feedback along with much-needed encouragement, and became a lifelong friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1938, Miller received a [[bachelor's degree|BA]] in English. After graduation, he joined the [[Federal Theater Project]], a [[New Deal]] agency established to provide jobs in the theater. He chose the theater project although he had an offer to work as a scriptwriter for [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot; /&gt; However, [[United States Congress|Congress]], worried about possible [[communism|Communist]] infiltration, closed the project in 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot; /&gt; Miller began working in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] while continuing to write [[radio plays]], some of which were broadcast on [[CBS Radio|CBS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot; /&gt;

On August 5, 1940, he married his college sweetheart, Mary Slattery, the Catholic daughter of an insurance salesman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot;&gt;Michael Ratcliffe, Arthur Miller Obituary, (London: The Observer, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two children, Jane and Robert.

===Early career===
In 1940 Miller wrote ''[[The Man Who Had All the Luck]],'' which was produced in New Jersey in 1940 and won the Theatre Guild's National Award.&lt;ref&gt;Royal National Theater: Platform Papers, 7. Arthur Miller (Battley Brothers Printers, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; The play closed after four performances and disastrous reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;shenton&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/shenton/2008/03/the-man-who-has-all-the-luck/#more|title=The man who HAS all the luck…..|last=Shenton|first=Mark|date=14 March 14, 2008|work=[[The Stage]]|publisher=The Stage Newspaper Limited|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Trinity of Passion'', author Alan M.

In 1948 Miller built a small studio in [[Roxbury, Connecticut]]. There, in less than a day, he wrote Act I of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]''. Within six weeks, he completed the rest of the play,&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot; /&gt; one of the classics of world theater.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-Obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Cobb]] as Willy Loman, [[Mildred Dunnock]] as Linda, [[Arthur Kennedy (actor)|Arthur Kennedy]] as Biff, and [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] as Happy. The play was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, winning a [[Tony Award for Best Author]], the [[New York Drama Critics' Circle|New York Drama Circle Critics' Award]], and the [[1949 Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer Prize]] for Drama. It was the first play to win all three of these major awards. The play was performed 742 times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot; /&gt;

In 1952, Kazan appeared before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC); fearful of being blacklisted from Hollywood, Kazan named eight members of the Group Theatre, including [[Clifford Odets]], [[Paula Strasberg]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[J.

Though widely considered only somewhat successful at the time of its initial release, today ''[[The Crucible]]'' is Miller's most frequently produced work throughout the world&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot; /&gt; and was adapted into an [[The Crucible (opera)|opera]] by [[Robert Ward (composer)|Robert Ward]] which won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1962. Miller and Kazan were close friends throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, but after Kazan's testimony to the HUAC, the pair's friendship ended, and they did not speak to each other for the next ten years.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmMasters&quot; /&gt; The HUAC took an interest in Miller himself not long after ''The Crucible'' opened, denying him a passport to attend the play's London opening in 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot; /&gt; Kazan defended his own actions through his film [[On the Waterfront]], in which a dockworker heroically testifies against a corrupt union boss.

Miller's experience with the HUAC affected him throughout his life. In the late 1970s he became very interested in the highly publicized Barbara Gibbons murder case, in which Gibbons' son Peter Reilly was convicted of his mother's murder based on what many felt was a coerced confession and little other evidence. ''[[City Confidential]]'', an [[A&amp;E Network]] program about the murder, postulated that part of the reason Miller took such an active interest (including supporting Reilly's defense and using his own celebrity to bring attention to Reilly's plight) was because he had felt similarly persecuted in his run-in with the HUAC. He sympathized with Reilly, whom he firmly believed to be innocent and to have been railroaded by the Connecticut State Police and the Attorney General who had initially prosecuted the case.&lt;ref&gt;

===1956–1964===
In 1956, a [[One-act play|one-act version]] of Miller's [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse drama]] ''[[A View from the Bridge]]'' opened on Broadway in a joint bill with one of Miller's lesser-known plays, ''[[A Memory of Two Mondays]]''. The following year, Miller revised ''A View from the Bridge'' as a two-act [[prose]] drama, which [[Peter Brook]] directed in London.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Miller, Introduction to ''Plays: One'' (London: Methuen, 1988). p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1956, Miller left his first wife Mary Slattery and on June 25 he married [[Marilyn Monroe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot;/&gt; Miller and Monroe had met in April 1951, when they had a brief affair, and had remained in contact since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot;/&gt;

When Miller applied in 1956 for a routine renewal of his passport, the HUAC used this opportunity to [[subpoena]] him to appear before the committee. Before appearing, Miller asked the committee not to ask him to name names, to which the chairman agreed.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCOnThisDay&quot;&gt;{{cite news
|publisher=BBC.co.uk
|title=BBC On This Day

|accessdate=2006-10-14 | date=1958-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Miller attended the hearing, to which Monroe accompanied him, risking her own career,&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot; /&gt; he gave the committee a detailed account of his political activities. Reneging on the chairman's promise, the committee demanded the names of friends and colleagues who had participated in similar activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCOnThisDay&quot;/&gt; Miller refused to comply, saying &quot;I could not use the name of another person and bring trouble on him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCOnThisDay&quot; /&gt; As a result, a judge found Miller guilty of [[contempt of Congress]] in May 1957. Miller was sentenced to a $500 fine or thirty days in prison, blacklisted, and disallowed a US passport.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMICH_Early&quot;/&gt; In 1958, his conviction was overturned by the court of appeals, which ruled that Miller had been misled by the chairman of the HUAC.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMICH_Early&quot;/&gt;

Miller began work on ''[[The Misfits (film)|The Misfits]]'', starring his wife. Miller later said that the filming was one of the lowest points in his life; shortly before the film's premiere in 1961, the pair divorced.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot;/&gt; 19 months later, Monroe died of an apparent drug overdose.

Miller married photographer [[Inge Morath]] on February 17, 1962 and the first of their two children, [[Rebecca Miller|Rebecca]], was born that September. Their son Daniel was born with [[Down syndrome]] in November 1966; he was institutionalized and excluded from the Millers' personal life at Arthur's insistence.&lt;ref name=&quot;VanityFair&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|title=Arthur Miller's Missing Act|author=Suzanna Andrews|date=September 2007|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/fame/features/2007/09/miller200709?printable=true&amp;currentPage=all|accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple remained together until Inge's death in 2002. Arthur Miller's son-in-law, actor [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], is said to have visited Daniel frequently, and to have persuaded Arthur Miller to reunite with his adult son.&lt;ref name=&quot;DailyMail2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|title=The very strange life of reclusive superstar Daniel Day-Lewis|author=Paul Scott|date=January 2008|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=509161&amp;in_page_id=1773|accessdate=2008-01-28|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
In 1964 Miller's next play was produced. ''[[After the Fall (play)|After the Fall]]'' is a deeply personal view of Miller's experiences during his marriage to Monroe. The play reunited Miller with his former friend Kazan: they collaborated on both the script and the direction. ''[[After the Fall (play)|After the Fall]]'' opened on January 23, 1964 at the ANTA Theatre in [[Washington Square Park]] amid a flurry of publicity and outrage at putting a Monroe-like character, called Maggie, on stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot; /&gt; That same year, Miller produced ''[[Incident at Vichy]]''. In 1965, Miller was elected the first American president of [[International PEN]], a position which he held for four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 1969, Miller's works were banned in the [[Soviet Union]] after he campaigned for the freedom of dissident writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot; /&gt; Throughout the 1970s, Miller spent much of his time experimenting with the theatre, producing one-act plays such as ''Fame'' and ''The Reason Why'', and traveling with his wife, producing ''In The Country'' and ''Chinese Encounters'' with her. Both his 1972 comedy ''[[The Creation of the World and Other Business]]'' and its musical adaptation, ''[[Up from Paradise]]'', were critical and commercial failures.&lt;ref&gt;

Miller was an unusually articulate commentator on his own work.  In 1978 he published a collection of his ''Theater Essays'', edited by Robert A. Martin and with a foreword by Miller.  Highlights of the collection included Miller's introduction to his ''Collected Plays'', his reflections on the theory of tragedy, comments on the McCarthy Era, and pieces arguing for a publicly supported theater.  Reviewing this collection in the ''Chicago Tribune,'' Studs Terkel remarked, &quot;in reading [the ''Theater Essays'']...you are exhilaratingly aware of a social critic, as well as a playwright, who knows what he's talking about.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Martin, ed., ''The Theater Essays of Arthur Miller.''  Viking, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1983, Miller traveled to the [[People's Republic of China]] to produce and direct ''Death of a Salesman'' at the People's Art Theatre in [[Beijing]]. The play was a success in China&lt;ref name=&quot;UMICH_60s70s80s&quot; /&gt; and in 1984, ''Salesman in Beijing,'' a book about Miller's experiences in [[Beijing]], was published. Around the same time, ''Death of a Salesman'' was made into a TV movie starring [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Willy Loman. Shown on CBS, it attracted 25 million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of American Theatre: Post-World War II to the 1990s'', page 296 ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1987, Miller's autobiographical work,
''Timebends'', was published. Before it was published, it was well-known that Miller would not talk about Monroe in interviews; in ''Timebends'' Miller talks about his experiences with Monroe in detail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot; /&gt; During the early 1990s Miller wrote three new plays, ''[[The Ride Down Mt. Morgan]]'' (1991), ''[[The Last Yankee]]'' (1992), and ''[[Broken Glass (play)|Broken Glass]]'' (1994). In 1996, a film of ''The Crucible'' starring [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] and [[Winona Ryder]] opened. Miller spent much of 1996 working on the screenplay to the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot; /&gt;
''[[Mr. Peters' Connections]]'' was staged [[Off-Broadway]] in 1998, and ''Death of a Salesman'' was revived on Broadway in 1999 to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary. The play, once again, was a large critical success, winning a Tony Award for best revival of a play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1993, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#93 Lifetime Honors – National Medal of Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) selected Miller for the [[Jefferson Lecture]], the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the [[humanities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jefflect&quot;&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html Jefferson Lecturers] at NEH Website .

Miller's lecture analyzed political events (including the recent [[United States presidential election, 2000|U.S. presidential election of 2000]])
in terms of the &quot;arts of performance&quot;, and it drew attacks from some conservatives&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Craig, &quot;Arthur Miller's Jefferson Lecture Stirs Controversy&quot;, in [http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2001may/ncc.html &quot;Capital Commentary&quot;], ''OAH Newsletter'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[published by &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Organization of American Historians]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Jay Nordlinger]], who called it &quot;a disgrace&quot;,

In 1999 Miller was awarded [[The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize]], one of the richest prizes in the arts, given annually to “a man or woman who has made an outstanding contribution to the beauty of the world and to mankind’s enjoyment and understanding of life.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://gishprize.com/index.html The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize], official website.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, 2002, Miller was awarded Spain's [[Principe de Asturias Prize for Literature]] as &quot;the undisputed master of modern drama&quot;.

In December 2004, the 89-year-old Miller announced that he had been in love with 34-year-old [[Minimalism|minimalist painter]] Agnes Barley and had been living with her at his Connecticut farm since 2002, and that they intended to marry. Within hours of her father's death, [[Rebecca Miller]] ordered Barley to vacate the premises, having consistently opposed the relationship.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Miller's final play, ''[[Finishing the Picture]]'', opened at the [[Goodman Theatre]], [[Chicago]], in the fall of 2004, with one character said to be based on Barley.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Miller said that the work was based on the experience of filming ''The Misfits''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Diabelli was born in [[Mattsee]] near [[Salzburg]]. A musical child, he sang in the [[boys' choir]] at the [[Salzburg Cathedral]] where he is believed to have taken music lessons with [[Michael Haydn]]. By age 19, Diabelli had already composed several important compositions, including six masses.

Diabelli was trained to enter the [[priest]]hood and in 1800 he joined the monastery at Raitenhaslach, [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMusic.com&quot;/&gt;  He remained there until 1803 when Bavaria closed all its monasteries.

==Career==
In 1803 Diabelli moved to [[Vienna]] and began teaching [[piano]] and [[classical guitar|guitar]] and found work as a proofreader for a music publisher.  During this period he learned the music publishing business while continuing to compose.  In 1809 he composed his comic opera, ''Adam in der Klemme.''  In 1817 he started a music publishing business and 1818, partnered with [[Pietro Cappi]] to create the music publishing firm of Cappi &amp; Diabelli.

The firm, Cappi &amp; Diabelli became well known by [[arrangement|arranging]] popular pieces so they could be played by amateurs at home. A master of promotion, Diabelli selected widely-accessible music such as famous opera tune arrangements, dance music, or hundreds of the latest popular comic theater songs

The firm soon established a reputation in more serious music circles by championing the works of [[Franz Schubert]].  It was Diabelli who first recognized the composer's potential, become the very first to publish Schubert's work with [[Der Erlkönig]] in 1821.  Diabelli's firm continued to publish Schubert's work until 1823 when an argument between Cappi and Schubert terminated their business.  The following year, Diabelli and Cappi parted ways, with Diabelli launching a new publishing house, Diabelli &amp; Co, in 1824.

Following Schubert's early death in 1828, Diabelli purchased a large portion of the composer's massive musical estate from Schubert's brother [[Ferdinand Schubert|Ferdinand]].  As Schubert's total compositions number nearly 1000, Diabelli's firm was able to publish &quot;new&quot; Schubert works for more than 30 years after the composer's death.

Diabelli's publishing house expanded throughout his life, before he retired in 1851, leaving it under the control of [[Carl Anton Spina]]. When Diabelli died in 1858, Spina continued to run the firm, and published much music by [[Johann Strauss II]] and [[Josef Strauss]]. In 1872, the firm was taken over by [[Friedrich Schreiber]], and in 1876 it merged with the firm of [[August Cranz]], who bought the company in 1879 and ran it under his name.

He died in Vienna at the age of 76.

==Compositions==
Diabelli produced a number of works as a composer, including an [[operetta]] called ''Adam in der Klemme'', several [[mass (music)|mass]]es and [[song]]s and numerous piano and classical guitar pieces. Among these are pieces for [[piano four hands]] that are popular among amateur pianists.

Diabelli's composition ''Pleasures of Youth: Six Sonatinas'' is a collection of six [[sonatina]]s depicting a struggle between unknown opposing forces. This is suggested by the sharp and frequent change in dynamics from [[Dynamics (music)|forte]] to [[Dynamics (music)|piano]]. When forte is indicated, the pianist is meant to evoke a sense of wickedness, thus depicting the antagonist. In contrast, the markings of piano represent the protagonist with its softer, more tranquil tones.

===Diabelli Variations===
The composition for which Diabelli is now best known was actually written as part of an adventuring story. In 1819, as a promotional idea, he decided to try to publish a volume of [[variation (music)|variation]]s on a &quot;patriotic&quot; waltz he had penned expressly for this purpose, with one variation by every important Austrian composer living at the time, as well as several significant non-Austrians. The combined contributions would be published in an anthology called ''[[Vaterländischer Künstlerverein]]''.  Fifty-one composers responded with pieces, including Beethoven, Schubert, [[Carl Czerny]], [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]], [[Ignaz Moscheles]], and the eight-year-old [[Franz Liszt]] (although it seems Liszt was not invited personally, but his teacher Czerny arranged for him to be involved). Czerny was also enlisted to write a [[coda (music)|coda]].  Beethoven, however, instead of providing just one variation, provided 33, and his formed Part I of ''Vaterländischer Künstlerverein''.  They constitute what is generally regarded as one of the greatest of Beethoven's piano pieces and as the greatest set of variations of their time, and are generally known simply as the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', Op. 120. The other 50 variations were published as Part II of ''Vaterländischer Künstlerverein''.

==Cultural references==
A [[sonatina]] of Diabelli's, presumably ''Sonatina in F major,'' op. 168, no. 1 (I: Moderato cantabile), provides the title and a motif for the French [[novella]] ''[[Moderato Cantabile]]'' by [[Marguerite Duras]].

{{For|the Lutheran pastor|Anita C. Hill}}
'''Anita Faye Hill''' (born {{Birth date|1956|7|30}}) is a professor of social policy, law, and women's studies at [[Brandeis University]] at the [[Heller School for Social Policy and Management]] and a former colleague of [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Clarence Thomas]]. She gained national exposure for testifying under oath at Thomas' 1991 [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmation hearings alleging that her supervisor Thomas had made provocative and [[sexual harassment|harassing sexual statements]].

==Early career==
Anita F. Hill was born in [[Lone Tree, Oklahoma|Lone Tree]], [[Oklahoma]]. She received her [[undergraduate degree]] from [[Oklahoma State University]] in 1977 and her [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[Yale Law School]] in 1980.

Hill was admitted to the District of Columbia Bar in 1980. Hill began her law career as an associate with the [[Washington, D.C.]], firm of Wald, Harkrader &amp; Ross. In 1981 she served as counsel to the assistant secretary of the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. From 1982 to 1983, she moved on to serve as assistant to the chairman of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], [[Clarence Thomas]] (see below). Hill became a professor at [[Oral Roberts University]], where she actively taught from 1983 to 1986. In 1986, she joined the faculty at the University of Oklahoma College of Law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctforum.org/popups/bio.asp event_bio_image_id=2611].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clarence Thomas controversy==
{{Main|Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination}}
In 1981, Hill became an attorney-adviser to Clarence Thomas at the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] (''ED''). When Thomas became Chairman of the U.S. [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (''EEOC''), Hill went to the EEOC with Thomas and his then-secretary, Diane Holt, to serve as his special assistant. Hill alleges that it was during these two periods (i.e., during her employment at ED and EEOC) that Thomas made sexually provocative statements.

Although Hill was a career employee and therefore had the option of remaining at the Department of Education, she testified that she followed Thomas because, &quot;[t]he work, itself, was interesting, and at that time, it appeared that the sexual overtures . . . had ended.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;zeflrz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/congress/senate/judiciary/sh102-1084pt4/36-40.pdf|title=Testimony of Anita F. Hill, Professor of Law, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, OK|date=1991-10-11|pages=37|publisher=US Government Printing Office|accessdate=2007-10-03|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, she testified that she wanted to work in the civil-rights field, and that she believed that &quot;at that time the Department of Education, itself, was a dubious venture.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;zeflrz&quot;/&gt;

Thomas was nominated to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] by then-President [[George H. W. Bush]] to replace the retiring Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]]. On October 11, 1991, Hill was called to testify during the Senate confirmation hearing for Thomas. Hill's allegations against Thomas were made public when information from an FBI interview about the allegations was leaked to the media days before the final Senate vote on his appointment.

Hill's testimony included a wide variety of language that she allegedly was subjected to by Thomas and that she found inappropriate:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He spoke about acts that he had seen in pornographic films involving such matters as women having sex with animals and films showing group sex or rape scenes....On several occasions, Thomas told me graphically of his own sexual prowess....Thomas was drinking a Coke in his office, he got up from the table at which we were working, went over to his desk to get the Coke, looked at the can and asked, &quot;Who has put pubic hair on my Coke?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Opening Statement:
Sexual Harassment Hearings Concerning Judge Clarence Thomas,&quot; Women's Speeches from Around the World [http://gos.sbc.edu/h/hill.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Four individuals ([[Ellen Wells]], [[John W. Carr (witness, Clarence Thomas hearings)|John W. Carr]], Judge [[Susan Hoerchner]], and [[Joel Paul]]) testified that Hill had been upset at the time she worked for Thomas about what she had said was sexual harassment by him.  [[Angela Wright]], another of Thomas' subordinates, stated that she had not considered the behavior to be sexual harassment, but that others might.  She was interviewed by Senate Judiciary Committee staff, but did not testify at the hearings.  Wright had been fired by Thomas from the EEOC.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Anita Hill's accusations were viewed suspiciously by Thomas' supporters, partly due to their timing (only revealed during Justice Thomas' confirmation hearings) and the &quot;he said, she said&quot; nature of the discussions made privately between Hill and Thomas. Further cause for suspicion were her actions after the contested events: in addition to following him to the EEOC, after that job concluded she continued personal contact with him, both in public and in private.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/29/us/the-thomas-nomination-questions-to-those-who-corroborated-hill-account.html?pagewanted=1 “THE THOMAS NOMINATION; Questions to Those Who Corroborated Hill Account,”] ''[[New York Times]]'' (1991-10-21): “And I ask you, why then after she left his power, after she left his presence, after she left his influence and his domination or whatever it was that gave her fear, and call it fear of revulsion, or repulsion, why did she twice after that visit personally with him in Tulsa, Oklahoma, had dinner with him in the presence of others, had breakfast with him in the presence of others, rode to the airport alone with him in the presence of no one. And we have eleven phone calls initiated by her from 1984 through the date of Clarence Thomas's marriage to Jenny Lamp....I'm afraid that that will remain a puzzlement for me forever as to how that can be, where one would continue a relationship with a person that had done this foul, foul presentation of verbiage, verbal garbage to him or her. And I shall never understand that. It remains one of my great quandaries.”&lt;/ref&gt; Anita Hill agreed to take a polygraph test which found that her statements were true. Clarence Thomas refused to take a polygraph test.  Thomas made a blanket denial of the accusations, claiming this was a &quot;high-tech lynching&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Ann Essoglou “Louder Than Words: A WAC Chronicle” in Nina Felshin, (ed.) But is it Art? The Spirit of Art as Activism (Seattle: Bay Press, 1995) 333–372.&lt;/ref&gt;  After extensive debate, the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] confirmed Thomas by a vote of 52–48.&lt;ref&gt;

===Effects===
Public interest in, and debate over, Hill's testimony is said by some{{who|date=November 2010}} to have launched modern-day public awareness of the issue of [[sexual harassment]] in the [[United States]].

In their [[Black feminist]] anthology, ''All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave: Black Women's Studies'', Editors Akasha (Gloria T.) Hull, Patricia Bell Scott and [[Barbara Smith]] describe Black feminists mobilizing &quot;a remarkable national response to the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas (Supreme Court nomination) in 1991, naming their effort ''African American Women in Defense of Ourselves''.&lt;ref&gt;Hull, Smith, Scott. ''All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave: Black Women's Studies'', pxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, almost 20 years after the accusations, [[Virginia Lamp Thomas]], Thomas' wife, sought an apology from Hill in an office voicemail left for her. Hill dismissed the request, maintaining &quot;I testified truthfully about my experience and I stand by that testimony.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304510704575562993761893962.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsSecond|title=Justice's Wife Seeks Apology From His Accuser|publisher=The Wall Street Journal| first=Jess | last=Bravin | date=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hill referred the matter to the Brandeis University campus police with a request that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] investigate the call.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news

===Books===
Doubts about her testimony were furthered by the widely publicized and later recanted claims of journalist [[David Brock]], founder of the progressive [[Media Matters]], in his book ''[[The Real Anita Hill]]''.  Brock, later describing the book as &quot;character assassination&quot;, disavowed it and apologized to Hill; he also suggests that he used information provided by an intermediary of Thomas to threaten another witness, [[Kaye Savage]], into backing down, which Savage confirms.&lt;ref name=&quot;cd&quot;/&gt; His recantation was published in the July 1997 issue of ''[[Esquire Magazine]]'', in a piece titled &quot;I was a Conservative Hit Man.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cd&quot;&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0627-01.htm Critic of Anita Hill Now Admits Lying&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and, in his subsequent book, ''[[Blinded by the Right]]'', he accuses himself of being &quot;a witting cog in the Republican sleaze machine.&quot;

In 1998, Anita Hill penned her autobiography, ''Speaking Truth To Power'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I see...the faces of these young people, and I see their hearts and that they really do want change, and that they deserve it. They deserve a better society and so that is what motivates me and I think that I can be a part of creating that and having [been] given that chance, I don't want to blow it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Then &amp; Now: Anita Hill |publisher=CNN.com |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/01/03/cnn25.tan.anita.hill/ |date=2005-06-19 |accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2007, Clarence Thomas published his autobiography, ''My Grandfather's Son'', revisiting the Anita Hill controversy. He describes her as touchy and apt to overreact and her work at the EEOC as mediocre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21038082/ &quot;16 years later, Thomas fires back at Anita Hill&quot;], MSNBC.com, 28 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On Sunday morning, courtesy of Newsday, I met for the first time an Anita Hill who bore little resemblance to the woman who had worked for me at EEOC and the Education Department. Somewhere along the line she had been transformed into a conservative, devoutly religious Reagan-administration employee. In fact she was a left-winger who'd never expressed any religious sentiments whatsoever during the time I'd known her, and the only reason why she'd held a job in the Reagan administration was because I'd given it to her.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an [[op-ed]] piece written by Anita Hill, appearing in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on October 2, 2007, Hill writes that she &quot;will not stand by silently and allow [Justice Thomas], in his anger, to reinvent me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/opinion/02hill.html &quot;The Smear This Time&quot;], ''The New York Times'', 2 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent career==
Hill has provided expert commentary on many national television programs. Hill has been featured on ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]],'' ''[[60 Minutes]]'' and ''[[Face the Nation]]''. Hill is also the author of many articles that have been published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', and ''Critical Race Feminism''. In addition, she has contributed to many scholarly and legal publications. Hill has been a speaker in the area of law and women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allamericanspeakers.com/speakers/Anita-Hill/722|title=Biography of Anita Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Hill co-edited ''Race, Gender and Power in America'' with Emma Coleman Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, A. F. (Editor) &amp; Jordan, E. C. (Editor).  ''Race, Gender and Power in America''.  ISBN 0195087747.&lt;/ref&gt; She has also &quot;written extensively on international [[commercial law]], [[bankruptcy]], and [[civil rights]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.brandeis.edu/profiles/one-profile?profile_id=27|title=Anita Hill focuses on electoral, Supreme Court issues|publisher=Brandeis University|accessdate=2007-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 29, 1996, Hill resigned from the University of Oklahoma College of Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902EFD6103BF930A25752C1A960958260|title=Anita Hill Plans to Leave Teaching Post in Oklahoma|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2007-10-03 | first=Jo | last=Thomas | date=1996-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; She obtained a position at the Institute for the Study of Social Change at [[University of California, Berkeley]] in January 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/97legacy/hill.html|title=Anita Hill to be visiting scholar at UC Berkeley during spring 1997 to work on book, give seminars |publisher=The Regents of the University of California|accessdate=2007-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Hill joined the faculty of the [[Heller School for Social Policy and Management]] at [[Brandeis University]], after time at Brandeis University's Women's Studies Program.

In 2005, Hill was selected as a [[Fletcher Foundation]] Fellow.

In 2008, Professor Hill was awarded the Louis P. and Evelyn Smith First Amendment Award&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordhallforum.org/about/firstamendment Ford Hall Forum First Amendment Award]&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Ford Hall Forum]].

Anita Hill also serves on the Board of Trustees for Southern Vermont College which is located in Bennington, Vermont. [http://www.svc.edu/about/board.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''audio file format''' is a [[file format]] for storing [[digital audio]] data on a [[computer]] system. This data can be stored uncompressed, or [[audio compression (data)|compressed]] to reduce the file size. It can be a raw [[bitstream]], but it is usually a [[container format (digital)|container format]] or an audio data format with defined storage layer.

==Types of formats==
It is important to distinguish between a [[file format]] and an [[audio codec]]. A codec performs the encoding and decoding of the raw audio data while the data itself is stored in a file with a specific audio file format. Most of the publicly documented audio file formats can be created with one of two or more encoders or codecs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Although most audio file formats support only one type of audio data (created with an [[audio codec|audio coder]]), a multimedia container format (as [[Matroska]] or [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]]) may support multiple types of audio and video data.

There are three major groups of audio file formats:

* Uncompressed audio formats, such as [[WAV]], [[AIFF]], [[Au file format|AU]] or [[raw audio format|raw]] header-less [[PCM]];
* Formats with [[lossless data compression|lossless]] compression, such as [[Free Lossless Audio Codec|FLAC]], [[Monkey's Audio]] ([[filename extension]] APE), [[WavPack]] ([[filename extension]] WV), [[SHN|Shorten]], [[TTA (codec)|TTA]], [[ATRAC]] Advanced Lossless, [[Apple Lossless]] ([[filename extension]] m4a), [[MPEG-4 SLS]], [[MPEG-4 ALS]], [[MPEG-4 DST]], [[Windows_Media_Audio#Windows_Media_Audio_Lossless|Windows Media Audio Lossless (WMA Lossless)]], and [[SHN]] or [[Shorten]].
* Formats with [[lossy data compression|lossy]] compression, such as [[MP3]], [[Vorbis]], [[Musepack]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[ATRAC]] and [[Windows_Media_Audio#WIndows_Media_Audio_Lossy|Windows Media Audio Lossy (WMA lossy)]]).

===Uncompressed audio formats===
There is one major uncompressed audio format, [[PCM]], which is usually stored in a .wav file on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] or in a .aiff file on [[Mac OS]]. The AIFF format is based on the [[Interchange File Format]] (IFF). The WAV format is based on the [[RIFF (File format)|Resource Interchange File Format]] (RIFF), which is similar to IFF. WAV and AIFF are flexible file formats designed to store more or less any combination of sampling rates or bitrates. This makes them suitable file formats for storing and archiving an original recording.

[[Broadcast Wave Format|BWF]] (Broadcast Wave Format) is a standard audio format created by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] as a successor to WAV. BWF allows [[metadata]] to be stored in the file. See ''[[Broadcast Wave Format|European Broadcasting Union: Specification of the Broadcast Wave Format]]'' (EBU Technical document 3285, July 1997). This is the primary recording format used in many professional audio workstations in the television and film industry. BWF files include a standardized [[Timestamp]] reference which allows for easy synchronization with a separate picture element. Stand-alone, file based, multi-track recorders from Sound Devices,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sounddevices.com Sound Devices, LLC | Professional, Portable Audio Products&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Zaxcom,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zaxcom.com Zaxcom&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; HHB USA,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhb.co.uk/hhb/usa/ HHB USA | Essential Tools for Audio Professionals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fostex]], and Aaton&lt;ref&gt;http://aaton.com&lt;/ref&gt; all use BWF as their preferred format.

The [[.cda]] (Compact Disk Audio Track) is a small file that serves as a [[File shortcut|shortcut]] to the audio data for a track on a music CD. It does not contain audio data and is therefore not considered to be a proper audio file format.

===Lossless compressed audio formats===
A lossless compressed format stores data in less space by eliminating unnecessary data. It requires more processing power both to compress the data and to 
uncompress for playback.

Uncompressed audio formats encode both sound and silence with the same number of bits per unit of time. Encoding an uncompressed minute of absolute silence produces a file of the same size as encoding an uncompressed minute of symphonic orchestra music. In a lossless compressed format, however, the music would occupy a smaller portion of the file and the silence take up almost no space at all.

Lossless compression formats enable the original uncompressed data to be recreated exactly. They include the common&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=60145 2008 ripping/encoding general poll - Hydrogenaudio Forums&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Verify credibility|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[FLAC]], [[WavPack]], [[Monkey's Audio]], [[Apple Lossless|ALAC]]/Apple Lossless). They provide a compression ratio of about 2:1 (i.e. their files take up half the space of the originals). Development in lossless compression formats aims to reduce processing time while maintaining a good compression ratio.

===Lossy compressed audio formats===
Lossy compression enables even greater reductions in file size by removing some of the data. A variety of techniques are used, mainly by exploiting [[psychoacoustics]], to remove data with minimal reduction in the quality of reproduction. For many everyday listening situations, the loss in data (and thus quality) is imperceptible. The popular MP3 format is probably the best-known example, but Apple's AAC format is another common one. Most formats offer a range of degrees of compression, generally measured in [[bit rate]]. The lower the rate, the smaller the file and the greater the quality loss.

==List of formats==
{{see also|Comparison of audio formats|List of codecs}}

* [[3gp]] - multimedia container format can contain proprietary formats as [[Adaptive Multi-Rate audio codec|AMR]], [[AMR-WB]] or [[AMR-WB+]], but also some open formats
* [[ACT_(audio_format)|act]] - ACT is a lossy ADPCM 8 kbit/s compressed audio format recorded by most Chinese MP3 and MP4 players with a recording function, and voice recorders
* [[AIFF]] – standard audio file format used by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]. It could be considered the Apple equivalent of [[wav]].
* [[Advanced Audio Coding|aac]] – the Advanced Audio Coding format is based on the [[MPEG2]] and [[MPEG4]] standards. aac files are usually [[ADTS]] or [[Advanced Audio Coding|ADIF]] containers.
* [[Apple Lossless|ALAC]] - Apple Lossless compression, a lossless compression format from Apple.
* [[Adaptive Multi-Rate|amr]] - AMR-NB audio, used primarily for speech.
* [[atrac]] (.wav) – the older style Sony ATRAC format. It always has a .wav file extension. To open these files, install the ATRAC3 drivers.
* [[Au file format|Au]] – the standard audio file format used by [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]], [[Unix]] and [[Java (Sun)|Java]]. The audio in au files can be [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] or compressed with the [[M-law|μ-law]], [[a-law]] or [[G729]] codecs.
* [[Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband|awb]] - AMR-WB audio, used primarily for speech, same as the [[ITU-T]]'s G.722.2 specification.
* [[Dct (File Format)|dct]] – A variable codec format designed for dictation. It has dictation header information and can be encrypted (as may be required by medical confidentiality laws).
* dss – Digital Speech Standard files are an [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] proprietary format. It is a fairly old and poor codec. Gsm or mp3 are generally preferred where the recorder allows. It allows additional data to be held in the file header.
* dvf – a Sony proprietary format for compressed voice files; commonly used by Sony dictation recorders.
* [[FLAC|flac]] – File format for the Free Lossless Audio Codec, a lossless compression codec.
* [[GSM-FR|gsm]] – designed for telephony use in Europe, gsm is a very practical format for telephone quality voice. It makes a good compromise between file size and quality. Note that wav files can also be encoded with the gsm codec.
* [[iklax]] – An iKlax Media proprietary format, the iKlax format is a multi-track digital audio format allowing various actions on musical data, for instance on mixing and volumes arrangements.
* IVS – A proprietary version with [[Digital Rights Management]] developed by 3D Solar UK Ltd for use in music downloaded from their Tronme Music Store and interactive music and video player.
* [[m4p]] – A proprietary version of AAC in MP4 with [[Digital Rights Management]] developed by Apple for use in music downloaded from their [[iTunes]] Music Store.
* mmf - a Samsung audio format that is used in ringtones.
* [[Musepack|mpc]] - Musepack or MPC (formerly known as MPEGplus, MPEG+ or MP+) is an open source lossy audio codec, specifically optimized for [[Transparency (data compression)|transparent]] compression of stereo audio at bitrates of 160&amp;ndash;180 kbit/s.
* msv – a [[Sony]] proprietary format for Memory Stick compressed voice files.
* mxp4 – a Musinaut proprietary format allowing play of different versions (or skins) of the same song. It allows various interactivity scenarios between the artist and the end user.
* [[ogg]] – a free, open source container format supporting a variety of formats, the most popular of which is the audio format Vorbis. Vorbis offers compression similar to MP3 but is less popular.
* [[RealAudio|ra &amp; rm]] – a [[Real Audio]] format designed for streaming audio over the Internet. The .ra format allows files to be stored in a self-contained fashion on a computer, with all of the audio data contained inside the file itself.
* ram – a text file that contains a link to the Internet address where the Real Audio file is stored. The .ram file contains no audio data itself.
* [[raw audio format|raw]] – a raw file can contain audio in any format but is usually used with PCM audio data. It is rarely used except for technical tests.
* [[TTA (codec)|TTA]] - The True Audio, real-time lossless audio codec.
* [[VOX (file format)|vox]] – the vox format most commonly uses the Dialogic [[ADPCM]] (Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation) codec. Similar to other ADPCM formats, it compresses to 4-bits. Vox format files are similar to wave files except that the vox files contain no information about the file itself so the codec sample rate and number of channels must first be specified in order to play a vox file.
* [[wav]] – standard audio file container format used mainly in [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] PCs. Commonly used for storing uncompressed ([[PCM]]), CD-quality sound files, which means that they can be large in size—around 10&amp;nbsp;MB per minute. Wave files can also contain data encoded with a variety of (lossy) codecs to reduce the file size (for example the GSM or MP3 formats). Wav files use a [[Resource Interchange File Format|RIFF]] structure.
* [[Windows Media Audio|wma]] – the popular Windows Media Audio format owned by [[Microsoft]]. Designed with [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM) abilities for copy protection.

'''Area 51''' is a [[military base]], and a remote detachment of [[Edwards Air Force Base]].  It is located in the southern portion of [[Nevada]] in the [[western United States]], 83&amp;nbsp;miles (133&amp;nbsp;km) north-northwest of downtown [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. Situated at its center, on the southern shore of [[Groom Lake]], is a large military airfield. The base's primary purpose is to support development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dreamlandresort.com/area51/dreamland_50years.html DREAMLAND: Fifty Years of Secret Flight Testing in Nevada] By Peter W. Merlin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rich_groom_1977&quot;&gt;Rich, p. 57. Rich describes Groom in 1977 as being &quot;...a sprawling facility, bigger than some municipal airports, a test range for sensitive aviation projects&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The base lies within the [[United States Air Force]]'s vast [[Nevada Test and Training Range]]. Although the facilities at the range are managed by the [[99th Air Base Wing]] at [[Nellis Air Force Base]], the Groom facility appears to be run as an adjunct of the [[Air Force Flight Test Center]] (AFFTC) at Edwards Air Force Base in the [[Mojave Desert]], around {{convert|186|mi|km|-1}} southwest of Groom, and as such the base is known as Air Force Flight Test Center (Detachment&amp;nbsp;3).&lt;ref name=&quot;cambell_afftc&quot;&gt;Area 51 researcher Glenn Campbell claims that AFFTC Detachment 3 is located at Groom, citing the title of a leaked security manual, the mailbox in [[Henderson, Nevada]] he believes formerly served Groom, and the NASA biography of astronaut [[Carl E. Walz]] who was formerly a manager at AFFTC-DET3 !: Campbell, Glenn. [http://www.ufomind.com/area51/desert_rat/1996/dr36/walz/ &quot;Area 51 is Edwards DET 3&quot;], ''Groom Lake Desert Rat'', 17 June 1996; [http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/walz.html Biography of Carl E. Walz (Colonel, USAF, Ret.)], NASA [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;merlin_afftc&quot;&gt;Merlin, Peter W.[http://www.dreamlandresort.com/black_projects/black_projects_history.html &quot;Black Projects at Groom Lake: Into the 21st Century&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the name Area 51 is used in official [[CIA]] documentation,&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA_BYE2369-67&quot;/&gt; other names used for the facility include ''Dreamland'', ''Paradise Ranch'',&lt;ref&gt;Rich, p. 56. Rich writes &quot;Kelly [Johnson, the U2's designer] had jokingly nicknamed this Godforsaken place Paradise Ranch, hoping to lure young and innocent flight crews&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jacobsen&quot;/&gt; ''Home Base'', ''Watertown Strip'', ''Groom Lake'',&lt;ref name=&quot;patton_names&quot;&gt;Patton, p. 3, lists Paradise Ranch, Watertown, Groom Lake, and Home Base as nicknames&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently '''Homey Airport'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyaviator.com/?p=1498 &quot;Homey Airport - KXTA&quot;], ''Daily Aviator'' (blog), January 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The area is part of the Nellis [[Military Operations Area]], and the [[restricted airspace]] around the field is referred to as (R-4808N),&lt;ref&gt;[http://skyvector.com/#30-17-2-3294-3333 FAA aviation chart for the Groom area]&lt;/ref&gt; known by the military pilots in the area as &quot;The Box&quot; or &quot;the Container&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dreamlandresort.com/info/janet_routes.html &quot;R-4808N Fixes and Janet Routes&quot;] Dreamland Resort&lt;/ref&gt;

The intense secrecy surrounding the base, the very existence of which the U.S. government barely acknowledges, has made it the frequent subject of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] and a central component to [[unidentified flying object]] (UFO) folklore.&lt;ref name=&quot;jacobsen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lacitis20100327&quot;/&gt;

The original rectangular base of {{convert|6|by|10|mi|km}} is now part of the so-called &quot;Groom box&quot;, a rectangular area measuring {{convert|23|by|25|mi|km}}, of restricted airspace. The area is connected to the internal NTS road network, with paved roads leading south to [[Mercury, Nevada|Mercury]] and west to Yucca Flat. Leading northeast from the lake, the wide and well-maintained Groom Lake Road runs through a pass in the Jumbled Hills. The road formerly led to mines in the Groom basin, but has been improved since their closure. Its winding course runs past a security checkpoint, but the restricted area around the base extends further east. After leaving the restricted area, Groom Lake Road descends eastward to the floor of the Tikaboo Valley, passing the dirt-road entrances to several small ranches, before converging with [[Nevada State Route 375|State Route 375, the &quot;Extraterrestrial Highway&quot;]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/04/13/travel/escapes/13extraterrestrial.html

==Operations at Groom Lake==
Groom Lake is not a conventional airbase, as frontline units are not normally deployed there. It instead appears to be used during the development, testing, and training phases for new aircraft. Once these aircraft have been approved by the [[United States Air Force]] or other agencies such as the [[CIA]], operation of that aircraft is generally conducted from a normal air force base.

Soviet spy satellites obtained photographs of the Groom Lake area during the height of the Cold War, and later civilian satellites produced detailed images of the base and its surroundings. These images support only modest conclusions about the base, depicting a nondescript base, long airstrip, hangars and the lake.

===U-2 program===
{{Main|Lockheed U-2}}
Groom Lake was used for bombing and artillery practice during [[World War II]], but was then abandoned until April 1955, when it was selected by [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]'s [[Skunk Works]] team as the ideal location to test the forthcoming [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane.&lt;ref name=&quot;shadow&quot;&gt;Peebles, Curtis (2000). ''Shadow Flights: America's Secret Air War Against the Soviet Union''. Novato, CA: Presidio Press. ISBN 978-0-89141-700-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rich, pp. 141-144, details U2 test pilot [[Tony LeVier]] scouting the remote area near Death Valley for locations, saying of Groom &quot;I gave it a ten plus [score]... a dry lake bed around three and a half miles around&quot;, and describes LeVier showing the lake to U-2 designer [[Clarence Johnson|Kelly Johnson]] and CIA official [[Richard M. Bissell, Jr.|Richard Bissell]], and Johnson deciding to locate the runway &quot;at south end of lake&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The lakebed made an ideal strip from which they could operate the troublesome test aircraft, and the Emigrant Valley's mountain ranges and the NTS perimeter protected the test site from prying eyes and outside interference.

Lockheed constructed a makeshift base at the location, then known as Site II or &quot;The Ranch&quot;, consisting of little more than a few shelters, workshops and trailer homes in which to house its small team. In only three months a {{convert|5000|ft|m|adj=on}} runway was constructed&lt;ref name=&quot;shadow&quot; /&gt; and was serviceable by July 1955. The Ranch received its first U-2 delivery on July 24, 1955 from Burbank on a [[C-124 Globemaster II]] cargo plane, accompanied by Lockheed technicians on a [[Douglas DC-3]].&lt;ref name=&quot;shadow&quot; /&gt; The first U-2 lifted off from Groom on August 4, 1955. A U-2 fleet under the control of the [[CIA]] began overflights of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] territory by mid-1956.

During this period, the NTS continued to perform a series of atmospheric nuclear explosions. U-2 operations throughout 1957 were frequently disrupted by the [[Operation Plumbbob|Plumbbob]] series of atomic tests, which detonated over two-dozen devices at the NTS. The [[Operation Plumbbob|Plumbbob-Hood]] explosion on July 5 scattered [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] across Groom and forced a temporary evacuation.

===The OXCART program===
{{Main|Lockheed A-12|SR-71 Blackbird}}
[[File:A12radartesting.jpg|thumb|right|A-12 during radar testing at Groom Lake]]
Even before U-2 development was complete, Lockheed began work on its successor as part of the [[CIA]]'s ''[[Lockheed A-12|OXCART]]'' project, involving the A-12, a [[Mach number|Mach]]-3 high-altitude [[reconnaissance]] aircraft — a later variant of which became the famed USAF [[SR-71 Blackbird]]. This aircraft flight characteristics and maintenance requirements forced a massive expansion of facilities and runways at Groom Lake in 1960 since the aircraft required an {{convert|8000|ft|m|adj=on}} runway and additional infrastructure.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheOxcartStory&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol15no1/html/v15i1a01p_0001.htm The OXCART Story], Thomas P. McIninch, CIA Studies Archive, Vol 15, No. 1, 1994, declassified&lt;/ref&gt;  The main runway was lengthened from {{convert|5000|to|8500|ft|m|abbr=on|lk=off}} in autumn 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheOxcartStory&quot;/&gt;  Preparations began for the arrival of OXCART in early 1962: the FAA agreed to close off airspace around Groom Lake, security was greatly enhanced, and the small civilian mine in the Groom basin was closed.  The facility received eight F-101s for training, two T-33s for proficiency flying, a C-130 for cargo transport, a U-3A for administrative purposes, a helicopter for search and rescue, and a Cessna-180 for liaison use, and Lockheed provided an F-104 chase plane.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheOxcartStory&quot;/&gt; The first OXCART was covertly trucked to the base in February 1962, assembled, and it made its first flight 26 April 1962.  At the time, the base boasted a complement of over 1,000 personnel. It had fueling tanks, a control tower, and a [[baseball]] diamond. Groom saw the first flight of most major Blackbird variants: A-12, the abortive [[Lockheed YF-12|YF-12]] interceptor variant, and the [[Lockheed D-21|D-21]] Blackbird-based [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] project. The A-12 would remain at Groom Lake until 1968 and occasionally deployed to other United States bases overseas.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA_BYE2369-67&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SR-71 Blackbird, by contrast, first flew at Palmdale, California in December 1964, and Palmdale and Edwards AFB served as the primary operation sites for that model until [[Beale Air Force Base]] became active in early 1966.

===Have Blue/F-117 program===
{{Main|Lockheed Have Blue}}
The [[Lockheed Have Blue]] prototype stealth fighter (a smaller proof-of-concept model of the [[F-117 Nighthawk]]) first flew at Groom in December 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;rich_haveblue&quot;&gt;Rich, pp. 56-60&lt;/ref&gt; Testing of a series of ultra-secret prototypes continued there until mid-1981, when testing transitioned to the initial production of F-117 stealth fighters. In addition to flight-testing, Groom performed radar profiling, F-117 weapons testing, and was the location for training of the first group of frontline USAF F-117 pilots. Subsequently, the still highly classified active-service F-117 operations moved to the nearby [[Tonopah Test Range Airport]], and finally to [[Holloman Air Force Base]].

A government vehicle is parked on the hilltop; from there, security agents observe the approach to Groom Lake.]]

===Later operations===
Since the F-117 became operational in 1983, operations at Groom Lake have continued. The base and its associated runway system were expanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;fas_a51_overview&quot;&gt;Pike, John. &quot;Area 51 Facility Overview&quot;, [[Federation of American Scientists]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;space_com_expand&quot;&gt;Motta, Mary (April 23, 2000). [http://www.space.com/news/area51_exclusive_00421.html &quot;Images of Top-Secret U.S. Air Base Show Growth&quot;], [[space.com]]: &quot;the photos ... show that the area has significantly expanded since the first images were snapped of the infamous site over 30 years ago.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the federal government expanded the exclusionary area around the base to include nearby mountains that had hitherto afforded the only decent overlook of the base, prohibiting access to {{convert|3972|acre|km2}} of land formerly administered by the [[Bureau of Land Management]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fas_a51_overview&quot;/&gt;

Commuter service is provided along Groom Lake Road by a bus, catering to a small number of employees living in several small communities beyond the NTS boundary (although it is not clear whether these workers are employed at Groom or at other facilities in the NTS). The bus travels Groom Lake Road and stops at [[Crystal Springs, Nevada|Crystal Springs]], [[Ash Springs, Nevada|Ash Springs]], and [[Alamo, Nevada|Alamo]], and parks at the Alamo courthouse overnight.

==Runways==
The base has seven [[runways]] including one that now appears to be closed. The closed runway, 14R/32L, is also by far the longest with a total length of approximately {{convert|23300|ft}}, not including stopway. The other runways are two asphalt runways, the 14L/32R with a length of {{convert|12000|ft}} and 12/30 with a length of {{convert|5400|ft}}, and four runways located on the salt lake. These four runways are 09L/27R and 09R/27L, which are both approximately {{convert|11450|ft}}, and 03L/21R and 03R/21L, which are both approximately {{convert|10000|ft}}. The base also has a helipad.&lt;ref&gt;Measurements, runway state and alignment information based upon Google Earth / Digital Globe images as retrieved on December 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jeppesen.com/wlcs/index.jsp?section=support&amp;content=technical_flitestar.jsp

In December 2007, airline pilots noticed that the base had appeared in their aircraft navigation systems' latest [[Jeppesen]] database revision with the [[ICAO]] airport identifier code of KXTA and listed as &quot;Homey Airport&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;aopa-kxta-20080111&quot;&gt;Marsh, Alton K.

==U.S. government's positions on Area 51==
[[File:Usaf on area51.png|left|thumb|upright|A letter from the USAF replying to a query about Area 51]]
[[File:CIA BYE2369-67 page17.gif|left|thumb|upright|CIA document from 1967 referring to Area 51]]
The federal government explicitly concedes (in various court filings and government directives) that the USAF has an &quot;operating location&quot; near Groom Lake, but does not provide any further information.

Unlike much of the Nellis range, the area surrounding the lake is permanently off-limits both to civilian and normal military air traffic. Radar stations protect the area, and unauthorized personnel are quickly expelled. Even military pilots training in the NAFR risk disciplinary action if they stray into the exclusionary &quot;box&quot; surrounding Groom's airspace.&lt;ref name=&quot;lacitis20100327&quot;&gt;Lacitis, Erik. &quot;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2011461015_area51vets28m.html Area 51 vets break silence: Sorry, but no space aliens or UFOs]&quot; ''The Seattle Times'', 27 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=redflag&gt;Hall, George.

[[File:Wfm nellis range redactions.jpg|thumb|right|A montage of available USGS satellite photography showing southern Nevada. The NTS and the surrounding lands are visible; the NAFR and neighboring land has been removed]] Perimeter security is provided by uniformed private security guards working for [[EG&amp;G]]'s security subcontractor [[Wackenhut]],&lt;ref&gt;Patton, p10&lt;/ref&gt; who patrol in desert camouflage [[Jeep Cherokee]]s and [[Humvee]]s, and more recently, champagne-colored [[Ford F-Series|Ford F-150 pickups]] and gray Chevrolet 2500 4X4 pickups. Although the guards are armed with [[M16 rifle|M16s]], no violent encounters with Area 51 observers have been reported; instead, the guards generally follow visitors near the perimeter and radio for the [[Lincoln County, Nevada|Lincoln County]] Sheriff. Deadly force is authorized if violators who attempt to breach the secured area fail to heed warnings to halt. Fines of around $600 seem to be the normal course of action, although some visitors and journalists report receiving follow-up visits from [[FBI]] agents. Some observers have been detained on public land for pointing camera equipment at the base. Surveillance is supplemented using buried motion sensors.&lt;ref name=&quot;poulsen&quot;&gt;[[Kevin Poulsen|Poulsen, Kevin]].

Higher resolution (and more recent) images from other satellite imagery providers (including Russian providers and the [[IKONOS]]) are commercially available. These show, in considerable detail, the runway marking, base facilities, aircraft, and vehicles.

Although federal property within the base is exempt from state and local taxes, facilities owned by private contractors are not. Area 51 researcher Glenn Campbell claimed in 1994 that the base only declares a taxable value of $2 million to the Lincoln County tax assessor, who is unable to enter the area to perform an assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ufomind.com/area51/desertrat/1994/rat_05.html

===Environmental lawsuit===

In 1994, five unnamed civilian contractors and the widows of contractors Walter Kasza and Robert Frost sued the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]. Their suit, in which they were represented by [[George Washington University]] law professor [[Jonathan Turley]], alleged they had been present when large quantities of unknown chemicals had been burned in open pits and trenches at Groom. [[biopsy|Biopsies]] taken from the complainants were analyzed by [[Rutgers University]] [[biochemistry|biochemists]], who found high levels of [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]], [[dibenzofuran]], and [[trichloroethylene]] in their body fat. The complainants alleged they had sustained skin, liver, and respiratory injuries due to their work at Groom, and that this had contributed to the deaths of Frost and Kasza. The suit sought compensation for the injuries they had sustained, claiming the USAF had illegally handled toxic materials, and that the EPA had failed in its duty to enforce the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (which governs handling of dangerous materials.) They also sought detailed information about the chemicals to which they were allegedly exposed, hoping this would facilitate the medical treatment of survivors. Congressman [[Lee H. Hamilton]], former chairman of the House
Intelligence Committee, told ''[[60 Minutes]]'' reporter [[Leslie Stahl]], &quot;The Air Force is classifying all information about Area 51 in order to protect themselves from a lawsuit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufomind.com/area51/articles/1996/60min_960317.html &quot;Area 51 / Catch 22&quot;] segment, ''60 Minutes'' broadcast March 17, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing the [[State Secrets Privilege]], the government petitioned trial judge U.S. District Judge Philip Pro (of the [[United States District Court for the District of Nevada]] in Las Vegas) to disallow disclosure of classified documents or examination of secret witnesses, alleging this would expose classified information and threaten national security.&lt;ref name=lvrj_jun2002&gt;Rogers, Keith (June 4, 2002).

Consequently, Pro dismissed the suit due to lack of evidence. Turley appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], on the grounds that the government was abusing its power to classify material. [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]] [[Sheila E. Widnall]] filed a brief that stated that disclosures of the materials present in the air and water near Groom &quot;can reveal military operational capabilities or the nature and scope of classified operations.&quot; The Ninth Circuit rejected Turley's appeal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/0/54eb6df18826949b88256e5a007188b2?OpenDocument US 9th Circuit ruling]{{dead link|date=December 2010}} on ''Kasza V Browner'' and related case ''Frost V Perry, Lake, Widnall''&lt;/ref&gt; and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear it, putting an end to the complainants' case.

An unclassified memo on the safe handling of [[F-117 Nighthawk]] material was posted on an Air Force website in 2005. This discussed the same materials for which the complainants had requested information (information the government had claimed was classified). The memo was removed shortly after journalists became aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Keith (May 21, 2006).

===1974 Skylab photography===
[[File:Groom Lake and Papoose Lake.jpg|thumb|[[Groom Lake]] and [[Papoose Lake]] (lower right)]]
In January 2006, space historian [[Dwayne A. Day]] published an article in online aerospace magazine ''[[The Space Review]]'' titled &quot;Astronauts and Area 51: the Skylab Incident.&quot; The article was based on a memo written in 1974 to [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] director [[William Colby]] by an unknown CIA official. The memo reported that astronauts on board [[Skylab 4]] had, as part of a larger program, inadvertently photographed a location of which the memo said:
{{quote|There were specific instructions not to do this. &lt;redacted&gt; was the only location which had such an instruction.}}
Although the name of the location was obscured, the context led Day to believe that the subject was Groom Lake. As Day noted:
{{quote|[I]n other words, the CIA considered no other spot on Earth to be as sensitive as Groom Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The memo details debate between federal agencies regarding whether the images should be classified, with [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] agencies arguing that it should, and [[NASA]] and the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] arguing against classification. The memo itself questions the legality of unclassified images to be retroactively classified.

Remarks on the memo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/archive/531.pdf|title=CIA memo to DCI Colby|publisher=hosted by The Space Review| accessdate = April 2, 2006|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; handwritten apparently by DCI ([[Director of Central Intelligence]]) Colby himself, read:

{{quote|He did raise it—said State Dept. people felt strongly. But he inclined leave decision to me (DCI)—I confessed some question over need to protect since:

==UFO and other conspiracy theories concerning Area 51==

Its secretive nature and undoubted connection to classified [[aircraft]] research, together with reports of unusual phenomena, have led Area 51 to become a focus of modern [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] and [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]]. Some of the activities mentioned in such theories at Area 51 include:
* The storage, examination, and [[reverse engineering]] of crashed [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] spacecraft (including material supposedly recovered at [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell]]), the study of their occupants (living and dead), and the manufacture of aircraft based on alien technology.
* Meetings or joint undertakings with extraterrestrials.
* The development of exotic [[energy weapons]] for the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI) or other weapons programs.
* The development of means of [[weather control]].
* The development of [[time travel]] and [[teleportation]] technology.
* The development of unusual and exotic propulsion systems related to the [[Aurora (aircraft)|Aurora Program]].
* Activities related to a supposed shadowy [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Alien Invasion|one world government]]  or the [[Majestic 12]] organization.
Many of the hypotheses concern underground facilities at Groom or at [[Papoose Lake]], {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} south, and include claims of a transcontinental underground railroad system, a disappearing airstrip (nicknamed the &quot;Cheshire Airstrip&quot;, after [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Cheshire cat]]) which briefly appears when water is sprayed onto its camouflaged asphalt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.serve.com/mahood/nellis/area19/cheshire.htm |title=The Cheshire Airstrip |first=Tom |last=Mahood |month=October |year=1996 |accessdate=April 2, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060316110233/http://www.serve.com/mahood/nellis/area19/cheshire.htm |archivedate = March 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and engineering based on alien technology. Publicly available satellite imagery, however, reveals clearly visible landing strips at Groom Dry Lake, but not at Papoose Lake.

Veterans of experimental projects such as OXCART and [[NERVA]] at Area 51 agree that their work (including 2,850 OXCART test flights alone) inadvertently prompted many of the UFO sightings and other rumors:&lt;ref name=&quot;jacobsen&quot;/&gt;
{{quote|The shape of OXCART was unprecedented, with its wide, disk-like fuselage designed to carry vast quantities of fuel.

They believe that the rumors helped maintain secrecy over Area 51's actual operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;lacitis20100327&quot;/&gt; While the veterans deny the existence of a vast underground railroad system, many of Area 51's operations did (and presumably still do) occur underground.&lt;ref name=&quot;jacobsen&quot;/&gt;

Several people have claimed knowledge of events supporting Area 51 conspiracy theories. These have included [[Bob Lazar]], who claimed in 1989 that he had worked at Area 51's [[S-4 (Sector Four)|S-4]] (a facility at Papoose Lake), where he was contracted to work with alien spacecraft that the U.S. government had in its possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zamandayolculuk.com/cetinbal/s4sportmodel.htm |title=S4 Sport Model - Cetin BAL - GSM:+90 05366063183 - Turkey / Denizli |publisher=Zamandayolculuk.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the 1996 documentary ''Dreamland'' directed by [[Bruce Burgess]] included an interview with a 71 year old mechanical engineer who claimed to be a former employee at Area 51 during the 1950s. His claims included that he had worked on a &quot;flying disc simulator&quot; which had been based on a disc originating from a crashed extraterrestrial craft and was used to train US Pilots. He also claimed to have worked with an extraterrestrial being named &quot;J-Rod&quot; and described as a &quot;telepathic translator&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Dreamland'', Transmedia and Dandelion Production for Sky Television (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Dan Burisch (pseudonym of Dan Crain) claimed to have worked on cloning alien viruses at Area 51, also alongside the alien named &quot;J-Rod&quot;. Burisch's scholarly credentials are the subject of much debate, as he was apparently working as a Las Vegas parole officer in 1989 while also earning a [[PhD]] at [[State University of New York|SUNY]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/2004-11/ |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |work=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=28 |issue=6 |month=November/December |year=2004 |first=Robert |last=Sheaffer |title=Tunguska 1, Roswell 0 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080329151518/http%3A//www.csicop.org/si/2004-11/ |archivedate = March 29, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Audio signal processing''', sometimes referred to as '''audio processing''', is the intentional alteration of [[sound|auditory]] [[Signal (information theory)|signals]], or [[sound]]. As audio signals may be electronically represented in either [[digital]] or [[analog signal|analog]] format, signal processing may occur in either domain.  Analog processors operate directly on the electrical signal, while digital processors operate mathematically on the digital representation of that signal.

== History ==

Audio processing was necessary for early [[radio broadcasting]] -- as there were many problems with studio to transmitter links.

== Analog signals ==
An analog representation is usually a continuous, non-discrete, electrical; a [[voltage]] level represents the [[Pressure|air pressure]] [[waveform]] of the sound.

== Digital signals ==
{{Main|Digital signal processing}}
A digital representation expresses the pressure wave-form as a sequence of symbols, usually [[Binary numeral system|binary]] numbers.  This permits signal processing using [[digital circuits]] such as [[microprocessors]] and [[computers]].  Although such a conversion can be prone to loss, most modern audio systems use this approach as the techniques of digital signal processing are much more powerful and efficient than analog domain signal processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Digital Audio Signal Processing|first=Udo |last=Zölzer|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year= 1997|ISBN=0471972266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application areas ==

Processing methods and application areas include [[audio storage|storage]], [[audio level compression|level compression]], [[audio data compression|data compression]], [[transmission (telecom)|transmission]], enhancement (e.g., [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]], [[audio filter|filtering]], [[noise cancellation]], [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]] or [[reverb]] removal or addition, etc.)

=== Audio Broadcasting ===
Audio broadcasting (be it for [[television]] or audio broadcasting) is perhaps {{Weasel-inline|date=July 2009}} the biggest market segment (and user area) for audio processing products—globally.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Traditionally the most important audio processing (in audio broadcasting) takes place just before the transmitter. Studio audio processing is limited in the modern era due to digital audio systems (mixers, routers) being pervasive in the studio.

In audio broadcasting, the audio processor must
* prevent [[overmodulation]], and minimize it when it occurs
* compensate for non-linear transmitters, more common with [[medium wave]] and [[shortwave]] broadcasting
* adjust overall loudness to desired level
* correct errors in audio levels

For example, if 95% of the program can be parallelized, the theoretical maximum speedup using parallel computing would be 20× as shown in the diagram, no matter how many processors are used.]]

'''Amdahl's law''', also known as '''Amdahl's argument''',&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers 85, p.226&lt;/ref&gt; is named after [[Computer architecture|computer architect]] [[Gene Amdahl]], and is used to find the maximum expected improvement to an overall system when only part of the system is improved. It is often used in [[parallel computing]] to predict the theoretical maximum [[speedup]] using multiple processors.

The speedup of a program using multiple processors in parallel computing is limited by the time needed for the sequential fraction of the program. For example, if a program needs 20 hours using a single processor core, and a particular portion of 1 hour cannot be parallelized, while the remaining promising portion of 19 hours (95%) can be parallelized, then regardless of how many processors we devote to a parallelized execution of this program, the minimum execution time cannot be less than that critical 1 hour. Hence the speedup is limited up to 20×, as the diagram illustrates.

==Description==
Amdahl's law is a model for the relationship between the expected speedup of parallelized implementations of an algorithm relative to the serial algorithm, under the assumption that the problem size remains the same when parallelized. For example, if for a given problem size a parallelized implementation of an algorithm can run 12% of the algorithm's operations arbitrarily quickly (while the remaining 88% of the operations are not parallelizable), Amdahl's law states that the maximum speedup of the parallelized version is {{nowrap|1=1/(1 – 0.12) = 1.136}} times as fast as the non-parallelized implementation.

More technically, the law is concerned with the speedup achievable from an improvement to a computation that affects a proportion ''P'' of that computation where the improvement has a speedup of ''S''. (For example, if an improvement can speed up 30% of the computation, ''P'' will be 0.3; if the improvement makes the portion affected twice as fast, ''S'' will be 2.) Amdahl's law states that the overall speedup of applying the improvement will be

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(1 - P) + \frac{P}{S}}.&lt;/math&gt;

To see how this formula was derived, assume that the running time of the old computation was 1, for some unit of time. The running time of the new computation will be the length of time the unimproved fraction takes (which is 1 &amp;minus; ''P''), plus the length of time the improved fraction takes. The length of time for the improved part of the computation is the length of the improved part's former running time divided by the speedup, making the length of time of the improved part ''P''/''S''. The final speedup is computed by dividing the old running time by the new running time, which is what the above formula does.

Here's another example. We are given a task which is split up into four parts: P1 = 11%, P2 = 18%, P3 = 23%, P4 = 48%, which add up to 100%. Then we say P1 is not sped up, so S1 = 1 or 100%, P2 is sped up 5×, so S2 = 500%, P3 is sped up 20×, so S3 = 2000%, and P4 is sped up 1.6×, so S4 = 160%. By using the formula
P1/S1 + P2/S2 + P3/S3 + P4/S4,
we find the running time is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{0.11}{1} + \frac{0.18}{5} + \frac{0.23}{20} + \frac{0.48}{1.6} = 0.4575.&lt;/math&gt;
or a little less than ½ the original running time which we know is 1. Therefore the overall speed boost is
1 / 0.4575 = 2.186
or a little more than double the original speed using the formula
{{nowrap|(P1/S1 + P2/S2 + P3/S3 + P4/S4)&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
Notice how the 20× and 5× speedup don't have much effect on the overall speed boost and running time when 11% is not sped up, and 48% is sped up by 1.6×.

== Parallelization ==
In the case of parallelization, Amdahl's law states that if ''P'' is the proportion of a program that can be made parallel (i.e. benefit from parallelization), and (1 &amp;minus; ''P'') is the proportion that cannot be parallelized (remains serial), then the maximum speedup that can be achieved by using ''N'' processors is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(1-P) + \frac{P}{N}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the limit, as ''N'' tends to [[Extended real number line|infinity]], the maximum speedup tends to 1 / (1 − ''P''). In practice, performance to price ratio falls rapidly as ''N'' is increased once there is even a small component of (1 &amp;minus; ''P'').

As an example, if ''P'' is 90%, then (1 &amp;minus; ''P'') is 10%, and the problem can be speed up by a maximum of a factor of 10, no matter how large the value of ''N'' used. For this reason, parallel computing is only useful for either small numbers of [[central processing unit|processor]]s, or problems with very high values of ''P'': so-called [[embarrassingly parallel]] problems. A great part of the craft of [[parallel programming]] consists of attempting to reduce the component (1 – ''P'') to the smallest possible value.

''P'' can be estimated by using the measured speedup ''SU'' on a specific number of processors ''NP'' using

:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{estimated} = \frac{\frac{1}{SU} - 1}{\frac{1}{NP} - 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

''P'' estimated in this way can then be used in Amdahl's law to predict speedup for a different number of processors.

==Relation to law of diminishing returns==
Amdahl's law is often conflated with the [[Diminishing returns|law of diminishing returns]], whereas only a special case of applying Amdahl's law demonstrates 'law of diminishing returns'. If one picks optimally (in terms of the achieved speed-up) what to improve, then one will see monotonically decreasing improvements as one improves. If, however, one picks non-optimally, after improving a sub-optimal component and moving on to improve a more optimal component, one can see an increase in return. Note that it is often rational to improve a system in an order that is &quot;non-optimal&quot; in this sense, given that some improvements are more difficult or consuming of development time than others.

Amdahl's law does represent the law of diminishing returns if you are considering what sort of return you get by adding more processors to a machine, if you are running a fixed-size computation that will use all available processors to their capacity. Each new processor you add to the system will add less usable power than the previous one. Each time you double the number of processors the speedup ratio will diminish, as the total throughput heads toward the limit of &lt;math&gt;1 / (1 - P)&lt;/math&gt;.

This analysis neglects other potential bottlenecks such as [[memory bandwidth]] and I/O bandwidth, if they do not scale with the number of processors; however, taking into account such bottlenecks would tend to further demonstrate the diminishing returns of only adding processors.

== Speedup in a sequential program ==
[[Image:Optimizing-different-parts.svg|thumb|400px|Assume that a task has two independent parts, A and B. B takes roughly 25% of the time of the whole computation. By working very hard, one may be able to make this part 5 times faster, but this only reduces the time for the whole computation by a little. In contrast, one may need to perform less work to make part A be twice as fast. This will make the computation much faster than by optimizing part B, even though B speed-up by a greater ratio, (5× versus 2×).]]
The maximum speedup in an improved sequential program, where some part was sped up &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; times is limited by inequality

:&lt;math&gt;\text{maximum speedup } \le \frac{p}{1 + f \cdot (p - 1)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; f &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;) is the fraction of time (before the improvement) spent in the part that was not improved. For example (see picture on right):

*If part B is made five times faster (&lt;math&gt;p = 5&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;t_A = 3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t_B = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f = t_A / (t_A + t_B) = 0.75&lt;/math&gt;, then
*:&lt;math&gt;\text{maximum speedup } \le \frac{5}{1 + 0.75 \cdot (5 - 1)} = 1.25.&lt;/math&gt;
*If part A is made to run twice as fast (&lt;math&gt;p = 2&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;t_B = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t_A = 3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f = t_B / (t_A + t_B) = 0.25&lt;/math&gt;, then
*:&lt;math&gt;\text{maximum speedup } \le \frac{2}{1 + 0.25 \cdot (2 - 1)} = 1.60.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, making A twice as fast is better than making B five times faster. The percentage improvement in speed can be calculated as

:&lt;math&gt;\text{percentage improvement} = \left(1 - \frac{1}{\text{speedup factor}}\right) \cdot 100 \%.&lt;/math&gt;

*Improving part A by a factor of two will increase overall program speed by a factor of 1.6, which makes it 37.5% faster than the original computation.
*However, improving part B by a factor of five, which presumably requires more effort, will only achieve an overall speedup factor of 1.25, which makes it 20% faster.

== Criticisms ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}

[[Danny Hillis]] (in the 1998 book ''[[The Pattern on the Stone: The Simple Ideas That Make Computers Work|Pattern on the Stone]])'' has criticized Amdahl's Law as being unnecessarily pessimistic in its assumption that the sequential portion of a program as being 5% (or 50%) of the execution time.  In many applications, particularly with very large data sets (such as [[Google]] calculating [[PageRank]], or scientific programs doing [[Finite element analysis|FEA]]), the amount of sequential code is closer to 0%, as essentially every data element can be processed independently.

[[John L. Gustafson]] pointed out in 1988 what is now known as [[Gustafson's Law]]: people typically are not interested in solving a fixed problem in the shortest possible period of time, as Amdahl's Law describes, but rather in solving the largest possible problem (e.g. the most accurate possible approximation) in a fixed &quot;reasonable&quot; amount of time.  If the non-parallelizable portion of the problem is fixed, or grows very slowly with problem size (e.g. [[Big O notation|O(]]log ''n'')), then additional processors can increase the possible problem size without limit.

[[File:aya-cooking.jpg|thumb|right|Ayahuasca cooking in the [[Napo Province|Napo]] region of [[Ecuador]]]]
'''''Ayahuasca''''' ('''''ayawaska''''' pronounced {{IPA-qu|ajaˈwaska|}} in the [[Quechua language]]) is any of various [[psychoactive]] infusions or [[decoction]]s prepared from the ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi|Banisteriopsis spp.]]'' vine, usually mixed with the leaves of [[dimethyltryptamine]]-containing species of shrubs from the ''[[Psychotria]]'' genus. The brew, first described academically in the early 1950s by [[Harvard]] ethnobotanist [[Richard Evans Schultes]], who found it employed for divinatory and healing purposes by the native peoples of the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazonian]] [[Colombia]], is known by a number of different names (see [[#Names|below]]).  A notable property of ayahuasca is that neither of the ingredients cause any significant psychedelic effects when imbibed alone; they must be consumed together in order to have the desired effect. How indigenous peoples discovered the psychedelic properties of the ayahuasca brew remains unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;discovery&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ayahuasca.com/ayahuasca-overviews/on-the-origins-of-ayahuasca/|title=Ayahuasca.com - Overviews Shamanism - On The Origin of Ayahuasca|accessdate=August, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
In [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]], and to a lesser extent in [[Brazil]], &quot;ayahuasca&quot; or &quot;ayawaska&quot; is [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] for &quot;spirit vine&quot; or &quot;vine of the souls&quot;; ''aya'' means &quot;spirit&quot; while ''huasca'' or ''waska'' means &quot;vine&quot;.  The spelling of ''ayahuasca'' is the hispanicized version of the name; many Quechua or [[Aymara language|Aymara]] speakers would prefer the spelling ''ayawaska''. The name is properly that of the plant ''B. caapi'', one of the primary sources of beta-carbolines for the brew.  Other terms include:

* ''cipó'' (generic vine, liana), &quot;caapi&quot;, &quot;hoasca&quot;, &quot;vegetal&quot;, &quot;daime&quot; or &quot;santo daime&quot; in Brazil
* ''natem'' amongst the indigenous [[Shuar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Incayawar|first=Mario|coauthors=Lise Bouchard, Ronald Wintrob, Goffredo Bartocci|year=2009|title=Psychiatrists and Traditional Healers: Unwitting Partners in Global Mental Health|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-51683-6|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Achuar people|Achuar]] people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Descola|first=Philippe|year=1996|title=In the Society of Nature: A Native Ecology in Amazonia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521574679|pages=99–100, 163}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Peru and Ecuador
* ''yagé'' or ''yajé'' (both pronounced {{IPA-xx|jaˈhe|}})  in [[Tucanoan]]&lt;ref&gt;This term was popularized in English in the 1960s by the [[beat generation]] writers [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]] in ''[[The Yage Letters]]''.  The letters were originally written in the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''shori'' among the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] people of Peru&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Siskind|first=Janet|year=1973|title=To Hunt in the Morning|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195018915|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
[[Harmala alkaloid|Harmine compounds]] are of beta-carboline origin.  The three most studied beta-carboline compounds found in the ''B. caapi'' vine are harmine, harmaline and tetrahydroharmine. Harmine and harmaline are selective and reversible inhibitors of MAO-A, while tetrahydroharmine is a weak serotonin uptake inhibitor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pharmacokinetics&quot;/&gt; This inhibition of MAO-A allows [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] to diffuse unmetabolized past the membranes in the stomach and small intestine and eventually get through the [[blood-brain barrier]] to activate receptor sites in the brain. Without [[RIMA]]s or the MAOI of MAO-A, [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] would be metabolized in the digestive tract and would not have an effect when taken orally.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIBA, J 2003&quot;&gt;RIBA, J. Human Pharmacology of Ayahuasca. Doctoral Thesis: Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] in the  [[CYP2D6|cytochrome P450-2D6 enzyme]] affect the ability of individuals to metabolize harmine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Callaway JC |title=Fast and slow metabolizers of Hoasca |journal=J Psychoactive Drugs |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=157–61 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=16149329 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some natural tolerance to habitual use of ayahuasca (roughly once weekly) may develop through upregulation of the serotonergic system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pharmacokinetics&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Callaway JC, McKenna DJ, Grob CS, Brito GS, Raymon LP, Poland RE, Andrade EN, Andrade EO |year=1999 |title= Pharmacokinetics of Hoasca alkaloids in healthy humans |journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology | pmid = 10404423 |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages= 243–256 | doi = 10.1016/S0378-8741(98)00168-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Callaway JC, Airaksinen MM, McKenna DJ, Brito GS, Grob CS |title=Platelet serotonin uptake sites increased in drinkers of ayahuasca |journal=Psychopharmacology (Berl.) |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=385–7 |year=1994 |month=November |pmid=7892432 |doi= 10.1007/BF02245347|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A phase 1 pharmacokinetic study on ayahuasca (as Hoasca) with 15 volunteers was conducted in 1993, during the Hoasca Project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pharmacokinetics&quot; /&gt; A review of the Hoasca Project has been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=McKenna DJ, Callaway JC, Grob CS |year=1998 |title= The scientific investigation of ayahuasca: A review of past and current research | journal= The Heffter Review of Psychedelic Research |volume=1 |pages= 65–77 |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/3937611/The-Scientific-Investigation-of-Ayahuasca-A-Review-of-Past-and-Current-Research- }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
Sections of ''Banisteriopsis caapi'' vine are [[liquid-liquid extraction|macerated]] and boiled alone or with leaves from any of a number of other plants, including ''[[Psychotria viridis]]'' (''chacruna'') or ''[[Diplopterys cabrerana]]'' (also known as ''chaliponga'').  The resulting brew contains the powerful [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] alkaloid [[N,N-dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT), and [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO inhibiting]] [[harmala alkaloid]]s, which are necessary to make the DMT orally active.

Brews can also be made with no DMT-containing plants; ''Psychotria viridis'' being substituted by plants such as ''Justicia pectoralis'', [[Brugmansia]], or sacred tobacco, also known as ''Mapacho'' ([[Nicotiana rustica]]), or sometimes left out with no replacement. The potency of this brew varies radically from one batch to the next, both in potency and psychoactive effect, based mainly on the skill of the shaman or brewer, as well as other admixtures sometimes added and the intent of the ceremony.  Natural variations in plant alkaloid content and profiles also affect the final concentration of alkaloids in the brew, and the physical act of cooking may also serve to modify the alkaloid profile of [[harmala]] alkaloids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Callaway JC |title=Various alkaloid profiles in decoctions of Banisteriopsis caapi |journal=J Psychoactive Drugs |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=151–5 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=16149328 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Callaway JC, Brito GS, Neves ES |title=Phytochemical analyses of Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis |journal=J Psychoactive Drugs |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=145–50 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=16149327 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional ayahuasca brews are often made with ''Banisteriopsis caapi'' as a [[MAOI]], although [[DMT|Dimethyltryptamine]] sources and other admixtures vary from region to region.  There are several [[Banisteriopsis caapi#Types of vine|varieties of caapi]], often known as different &quot;colors&quot;, with varying effects, potencies, and uses.

DMT admixtures:
* ''[[Psychotria viridis]]'' (Chacruna)&lt;ref name=&quot;RatschIngredients&quot;&gt;[[#Ratsch2005|Ratsch 2005]], pp. 704–708&lt;/ref&gt; - leaves

==Usage==
Ayahuasca is used largely as a religious [[sacrament]].  Users of ayahuasca in non-traditional contexts often align themselves with the philosophies and cosmologies associated with ayahuasca [[shamanism]], as practiced among [[indigenous people]]s like the [[Urarina]] of [[Peru]]vian [[Amazonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Dean |first1= Bartholomew |year=2009 |title=Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia |location= Gainesville | publisher= University Press of Florida |isbn=978-0-8130-3378-5 |url=http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While non-native users know of the spiritual applications of ayahuasca, a less well-known traditional usage focuses on the medicinal properties of ayahuasca. When used for its medicinal purposes ayahuasca affects the human consciousness for less than six hours beginning half an hour after consumption, and peaking after two hours. The remedy also has cardiovascular effects, moderately increasing both heart rate and diastolic blood pressure. The psychedelic effects of ayahuasca include visual and auditory stimulation, the mixing of sensory modaltities , and psychological introspection that may lead to great elation, fear, or illumination. Its purgative properties are important (known as ''la purga'' or &quot;the purge&quot;). The intense [[vomiting]] and occasional [[diarrhea]] it induces can clear the body of worms and other tropical [[parasite]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Andritzky W |title=Sociopsychotherapeutic functions of ayahuasca healing in Amazonia |journal=J Psychoactive Drugs |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=77–89 |year=1989 |pmid=2656954 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and harmala alkaloids themselves have been shown to be [[anthelmintic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hassan, I. |year=1967 |title= Some folk uses of Peganum harmala in India and Pakistan |journal=Economic Botany |volume=21 |issue= 3 |page= 384 | doi = 10.1007/BF02860378 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, this action is twofold; a direct action on the parasites by these harmala alkaloids (particularly harmine in ayahuasca) works to kill the parasites, and parasites are expelled through the increased intestinal motility that is caused by these alkaloids.

Dietary taboos are often associated with the use of ayahuasca.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ott, J. Jonathan Ott 1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ott |first1= J. |title=Ayahuasca Analogues: Pangaean Entheogens |location= Kennewick, WA | publisher= Natural Books |year= 1994  | isbn = 978-0961423445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the rainforest, these tend towards the purification of one's self - abstaining from spicy and heavily-seasoned foods, excess fat, salt, caffeine, acidic foods (such as citrus) and sex before, after, or during a ceremony. A diet low in [[list of foods containing tyramine|foods containing tyramine]] has been recommended, as the speculative interaction of [[tyramine]] and MAOIs could lead to a [[hypertensive crisis]]. However, evidence indicates that [[harmala alkaloids]] act only  on [[Monoamine oxidase A|MAO-A]], in a reversible way similar to [[moclobemide]] (an antidepressant that does not require dietary restrictions). [[Psychonaut]]ic experiments and the absence of dietary restrictions in the highly urban Brazilian ayahuasca church [[União do Vegetal]] also suggest that the risk is much lower than perceived, and probably non-existent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ott, J. Jonathan Ott 1994&quot;/&gt;

The name 'ayahuasca' specifically refers to a botanical decoction that contains Banisteriopsis caapi. A synthetic version, known as [[pharmahuasca]] is a combination of an appropriate MAOI and typically DMT. In this usage, the [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] is generally considered the main psychoactive active ingredient, while the MAOI merely preserves the psychoactivity of orally ingested DMT, which would otherwise be destroyed in the gut before it could be absorbed in the body. Thus, ayahuasqueros and most others working with the brew maintain that the ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi|B. caapi]]'' vine is the defining ingredient, and that this beverage is not ayahuasca unless ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi|B. caapi]]'' is in the brew. The vine is considered to be the &quot;spirit&quot; of ayahuasca, the gatekeeper and guide to the otherworldly realms.

In some areas{{Specify|date=July 2009}}, it is even said that the ''chakruna'' or chaliponga admixtures are added only to make the brew taste sweeter.  This is a strong indicator of the often wildly divergent intentions and cultural differences between the native ayahuasca-using cultures and psychedelics enthusiasts in other countries.

In modern Europe and North America, ayahuasca analogues are often prepared using non-traditional plants which contain the same alkaloids. For example, seeds of the [[Syrian rue]] plant can be used as a substitute for the ayahuasca vine, and the DMT-rich ''[[Mimosa hostilis]]'' is used in place of ''chakruna''. Australia has several indigenous plants which are popular among modern ayahuasqueros there, such as various DMT-rich species of ''[[Acacia]]''.

A visitor who wishes to become a &quot;dietero&quot; or &quot;dietera&quot;, that is, a male or female apprentice-shaman learning the way of the teacher plants, undergoes a rigorous initiation. This can involve spending up to a year or more in the jungle. This initiation challenges and trains the initiate through extreme circumstances involving a special diet and numerous different plant medicines to complement the ayahuasca, the lack of western food and conveniences, the harsh environmental conditions of heavy rains, storms, intense heat, insects, and poisonous animals. The initiate is also tested for their unwavering commitment to ayahuasca and the shaman who oversees the training.

==Non-traditional usage==
Around the end of the 1990s, ayahuasca use spread to [[Europe]]. The first ayahuasca ‘Churches’ affiliated to the [[Brazil]]ian [[Santo Daime]] were established in the [[Netherlands]]. A legal case was filed against two of the Church's leaders, Hans Bogers (one of the original founders of the Dutch Santo Daime community) and Geraldine Fijneman (the head of the [[Amsterdam]] Santo Daime community). Bogers and Fijneman were charged with distributing a [[controlled substance|scheduled substance]] (DMT), however the prosecution was unable to prove that the use of ayahuasca by members of the Santo Daime constituted a sufficient threat to public health and order that it warranted denying their rights to [[religious freedom]] under [[ECHR#Article_9_-_conscience_and_religion|ECHR Article 9]]. The 2001 verdict of the Amsterdam district court is an important precedent. Since then groups that are not affiliated to the Santo Daime have used ayahuasca, and a number of different 'styles' have been developed, such as the non-religious approach developed by Daniel Waterman in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a-keys.nl/ayahuasca/who_we_are.html Who We Are] at a-keys.nl&lt;/ref&gt; popularly termed Ayahuasca Open Style (AOS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a-keys.nl/ayahuasca/introduction.html Introduction to Ayahuasca] at a-keys.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of [[Stanislav Grof]] has been an important inspiration for a non-religious approach to working with [[entheogen]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Grof’s primary focus has been on the transpersonal dimensions of the [[psychedelic]] experience.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} According to Grof, the birth process plays a decisive role in determining the individual's relationship to life in general, and to spirituality in particular. Problems experienced during the intrauterine (pre-natal) phase, a time when the foetus is physically one with the mother, are reflected in developmental problems. As a consequence, authority issues inevitably play a significant role in this type of ayahuasca use.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The personality of the person or persons administering ayahuasca, the purposes for which it is being used, the level of understanding and commitment as well as personal views and beliefs involved play a much more important role in determining the outcome of ayahuasca use than in the more conventional ceremonies of the Santo Daime and União do Vegetal where interactions between participants are strictly regulated.

Due to the legal status of ayahuasca, those who have been exploring its therapeutic potential are unable to do so openly. The therapeutic use of ayahuasca is not protected by covenants on religious freedom.

==History==
In the 16th century, Christian missionaries from Spain and Portugal first encountered indigenous peoples using ayahuasca in South America; their earliest reports described it as the work of the devil.&lt;ref&gt;Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975, p. 48 as cited in Soibelman 1995, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 20th century, the active chemical constituent of ''B. caapi'' was named ''[[telepathine]]'', but it was found to be identical to a chemical already isolated from ''Peganum harmala'' and was given the name [[harmaline]].  Beat writer William Burroughs read a paper by  [[Richard Evans Schultes]] on the subject and sought out ''yagé'' in the early 1950s while traveling through South America in the hopes that it could relieve or cure [[opiate]] [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] (see ''[[The Yage Letters]]''). Ayahuasca became more widely known when the McKenna brothers published their experience in the Amazon in ''True Hallucinations''.  Dennis later studied the pharmacology, [[botany]], and [[chemistry]] of ayahuasca and [[oo-koo-he]], which became the subject of his master's thesis.

In Brazil, a number of modern religious movements based on the use of ayahuasca have emerged, the most famous of them being [[Santo Daime]] and the [[União do Vegetal]] (or UDV), usually in an [[Spiritism|animistic]] context that may be shamanistic or, more often (as with Santo Daime and the UDV), integrated with [[Christianity]]. Both Santo Daime and União do Vegetal now have members and churches throughout the world.  Similarly, the US and Europe have started to see new religious groups develop in relation to increased ayahuasca use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Labate, B.C.; Rose, I.S. &amp; Santos, R.G. |title=Ayahuasca Religions: a comprehensive bibliography and critical essays | location= Santa Cruz | publisher= Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies - MAPS |year= 2009 | isbn=978-0979862212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Westerners have teamed up with shamans in the Amazon rainforest regions, forming ayahuasca healing retreats that claim to be able to cure mental and physical illness and allow communication with the spirit world. Some reports and scientific studies affirm that ritualized use of ayahuasca may improve mental and physical health.&lt;ref&gt;See research by Doctor [[John Halpern]] in [http://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/mg18524881.400 New Scientist]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the tea has been popularized by [[Wade Davis]] (''The Serpent and The Rainbow''), Chilean novelist [[Isabel Allende]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/03/23/st_isabelallende.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Isabel Allende: kith and tell | first=Catherine | last=Elsworth | date=2008-03-21 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; writer [[Kira Salak]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Salak's Article&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirasalak.com/Peru.html |title=Hell And Back |author=Salak, Kira |accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salak's Summary&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirasalak.com/Ayahuasca.html |title=Ayahuasca Healing in Peru |author=Salak, Kira |accessdate=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;,author Jeremy Narby (''The Cosmic Serpent''), and radio personality [[Robin Quivers]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcqj.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
Internationally, DMT is a Schedule I drug under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]. The Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances notes, however, that the plants containing it are not subject to international control:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maps.org/pipermail/maps_forum/2001-March/003376.html MAPS: DMT - UN report&lt;!-- RoBot generated title (T-1000) --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The cultivation of plants from which psychotropic substances are obtained is not controlled by the Vienna Convention. . . . Neither the crown (fruit, mescal button) of the Peyote cactus nor the roots of the plant Mimosa hostilis nor Psilocybe mushrooms themselves are included in Schedule 1, but only their respective principles, mescaline, DMT and psilocin.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[fax]] from the Secretary of the International Narcotics Control Board to the Netherlands Ministry of Public Health sent in 2001 goes on to state that &quot;Consequently, preparations (e.g.decoctions) made of these plants, including ayahuasca, are not under international control and, therefore, not subject to any of the articles of the 1971 Convention.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ayahuasca/ayahuasca_law10.shtml Erowid Ayahuasca Vault : Law : UNDCP's Ayahuasca Fax, Jan 17 2001&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal status in the United States of DMT-containing plants is somewhat questionable. Ayahuasca plants and preparations are legal, as they contain no scheduled chemicals. However, brews made using DMT containing plants are illegal since DMT is a Schedule I drug.  That said, some people are challenging this, using arguments similar to those used by peyotist religious sects, such as the [[Native American Church]]. A court case allowing União do Vegetal to use the tea for religious purposes in the United States, ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal]]'', was heard by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] on November 1, 2005; the decision, released February 21, 2006, allows the UDV to use the tea in its ceremonies pursuant to the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]]. In a similar case an Ashland, Oregon based Santo Daime church sued for their right to import and consume ayahuasca tea.  In March 2009, U.S. District Court Judge Panner ruled in favor of the Santo Daime, acknowledging its protection from prosecution under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csp.org/society/docs/SantoDaimeAshland20090318.pdf Ruling by District Court Judge Panner in Santo Daime case in Oregon]&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious use in Brazil was legalized after two official inquiries into the tea in the mid-1980s, which concluded that ayahuasca is not a recreational drug and has valid spiritual uses.&lt;ref&gt;More on the legal status of ayahuasca can be found in the [[Erowid]] vault on the [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ayahuasca/ayahuasca_law.shtml legality of ayahuasca].&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, [[Santo Daime]] won a court case allowing them to use the tea in early 2005; however, they were not allowed an exception for religious purposes, but rather for the simple reason that they did not perform chemical extractions to end up with pure DMT and harmala and the plants used were not scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;''Cour d'appel de Paris, 10ème chambre, section B,  dossier n° 04/01888.  Arrêt du 13 janvier 2005'' [Court of Appeal of Paris, 10th Chamber, Section B, File No. 04/01888. Judgement of 13 January 2005]. PDF of this document may be obtained from [http://www.santodaime.it/Library/LAW/0_LAW.htm#fra Ayahuasca - Santo Daime Library].&lt;/ref&gt;  Four months after the court victory, the common ingredients of ayahuasca as well as harmala were declared ''stupéfiants'', or narcotic schedule I substances, making the tea and its ingredients illegal to use or possess.&lt;ref&gt;''JO'', 2005-05-03. [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&amp;dateJO=20050503&amp;numTexte=18&amp;pageDebut=07636&amp;pageFin=07636 ''Arrêté du 20 avril 2005 modifiant l'arrêté du 22 février 1990 fixant la liste des substances classées comme stupéfiants'' (PDF)] [Decree of 20 April 2005 amending the decree of 22 February 1990 establishing the list of substances scheduled as narcotics].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- NPR reported in August 2010 that it was legal, is that wrong?
In Peru, the government is undergoing the legislation process of legalizing and regulating ayahuasca usage and monitoring ayahuasca centers. Currently (April 2010) the use of ayahuasca is not technically legal but since it is an accepted practice of its indigenous cultures the Peruvian government is going through of the process maintaining the continuity of its culture whilst avoiding international issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alfonso Leng''' (11 February 11 1894 &amp;ndash; 11 November 1974) was a post-romantic composer of [[European classical music|classical music]] and [[dentist]]. He was born in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]]. He wrote the first important [[symphony|symphonic]] work in Chilean tradition, &quot;La Muerte de Alcino&quot;, a [[symphonic poem]] inspired by the novel of [[Pedro Prado]]. He composed also a number of different works including many art songs in different languages and a number of important piano pieces, like the five &quot;Doloras&quot; (1914), which he later orchestrated and are normally played in concerts in Chile and Latinamerica. He won the Nacional Art Prize in 1957.
As dentist, he was the main founder of the Dentistry Faculty of the [[Universidad de Chile]], and he was eventually elected as the first dean.

Leng was the nephew of composer [[Carmela Mackenna]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Abbe-diagram 2.svg|right|thumb|380px|An Abbe diagram plots the Abbe number against refractive index for a range of different glasses (red dots). Glasses are classified using the Schott Glass letter-number code to reflect their composition and position on the diagram.]]

[[Image:SpiderGraph Abbe Number-en.svg|250px|thumb|Influences of selected [[glass]] component additions on the Abbe number of a specific base glass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://glassproperties.com/abbe_number/ Abbe number calculation of glasses]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[physics]] and [[optics]], the '''Abbe number''', also known as the '''V-number''' or '''constringence''' of a [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] material, is a measure of the material's [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] (variation of refractive index with wavelength) in relation to the [[refractive index]]. It is named after [[Ernst Abbe]] (1840–1905), the German physicist who defined it.

The Abbe number ''V'' of a material is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{ n_d - 1 }{ n_F - n_C },&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; are the refractive indices of the material at the wavelengths of the [[Fraunhofer lines|Fraunhofer]] d-, F- and C- [[spectral line]]s (587.6 [[nanometre|nm]], 486.1&amp;nbsp;nm and 656.3&amp;nbsp;nm respectively). Low dispersion (low [[lens (optics)#Chromatic aberration|chromatic aberration]]) materials have high values of ''V''.

Abbe numbers are used to classify [[glass]] and other optically transparent materials. For example, [[flint glass]] has ''V''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;50 and [[crown glass (optics)|crown glass]] has ''V''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;50. Typical values of ''V'' range from around 20 for very dense flint glass, around 30 for [[polycarbonate]] plastics, and up to 65 for very light crown glass, and up to 85 for [[fluorite|fluor]]-crown glass. Abbe numbers are only a useful measure of dispersion for visible light, and for other wavelengths, or for higher precision work, the [[dispersion (optics)|group velocity dispersion]] is used.

Alternate definitions of the Abbe number are used in some contexts. The value ''V''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt; V_d = \frac{n_d-1}{ n_F - n_C }&lt;/math&gt;
which defines the Abbe number with respect to the yellow Fraunhofer d (or D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) [[helium]] line at 587.5618&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength. It can also be defined at the green [[mercury (element)|mercury]] E-line at 546.073&amp;nbsp;nm:
:&lt;math&gt; V_e = \frac{n_e-1}{ n_{F'} - n_{C'}}&lt;/math&gt;
where F' and C' are the blue and red [[cadmium]] lines at 480.0&amp;nbsp;nm and 643.8&amp;nbsp;nm, respectively.

An '''Abbe diagram''' is produced by plotting the Abbe number ''V''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; of a material versus its refractive index ''n''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;. Glasses can then be categorised by their composition and position on the diagram. This can be a letter-number code, as used in the [[Schott Glass]] catalogue, or a 6-digit [[glass code]].

Abbe numbers are used to calculate the necessary [[focal length]]s of [[achromatic lens|achromatic doublet]] [[lens (optics)|lenses]] to minimize [[chromatic aberration]].

The following table lists standard wavelengths at which n is usually determined, indicated by subscripts.&lt;ref&gt;L. D. Pye, V. D. Frechette, N. J. Kreidl: &quot;Borate Glasses&quot;; Plenum Press, New York, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; For example, n&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is measured at 589.3&amp;nbsp;nm:

In [[linguistics]], '''ablative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''abl'''}}) is a name given to [[grammatical case|cases]] in various languages whose common characteristic is that they mark motion away from something, though the details in each language may differ. The name &quot;ablative&quot; is derived from the [[Latin]] ''ablatus'', the (irregular) perfect passive participle of ''auferre'' &quot;to carry away&quot;.

==Indo-European languages==
===Latin===
{{Main|Ablative (Latin)}}
The [[Latin]] ablative case (''ablativus'') is mainly used [[adverb]]ially to modify [[verb]]s. It has 15 uses, descending from three [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] cases: ablative (from), instrumental (with), and locative (in/at). The ablative is sometimes called the [[adverbial case]], since phrases in the ablative can be translated as [[adverb]]s: ''magnā (cum) celeritāte'' can be translated as &quot;with great speed&quot; or &quot;very quickly.&quot;

===Greek===
In [[Ancient Greek]], the functions of the ablative case were taken by the [[genitive case|genitive]], so that the genitive has functions belonging to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] genitive and ablative cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Weir Smyth]]. ''Greek Grammar''. par. 1279: composite or mixed cases.&lt;/ref&gt; The genitive case with the prepositions ἀπό ''apó'' &quot;away from&quot; and ἐκ/ἐξ ''ek/ex'' &quot;out of&quot; is an example.

===Albanian===
The ablative case is found in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] where it is the fifth case and is called ''rasa rrjedhore''.

===Sanskrit===
The ablative case in Sanskrit is the fifth case (panchami) in the grammar, and has similar function to that of Latin.  

Sanskrit nouns in this case often refer to a subject &quot;out of&quot; which or &quot;from&quot; whom something (an action, an object) has arisen or occurred. 

E.g. ''patram '''vrikshaat''' patati'' &quot;the leaf falls '''from the tree'''&quot;.

This case is also used for nouns in several other senses, eg, where the action occurs &quot;because of&quot; or &quot;without&quot; a certain noun; nouns indicating distance or direction.

===Armenian===
In the Western Armenian language, the ablative case is rendered by the suffix ''-e'' (indefinite) or ''-en'' (definite).

:''Mart'' - man
:''Marten'' - from the man
:''Marte'' - from (a) man

:''Doon'' - house
:''D'nen'' - from the house
:''D'ne'' - from (a) house

In Eastern Armenian, the suffix ''-its'' is used for both definite and indefinite nouns.

''Mard-'' man  
''Mardits-'' from man

''Toon-'' house 
''T'nits-'' from house

Both suffixes are derived from Classical Armenian. The Western suffix ''-e'' is from the Classical singular and the Eastern suffix ''-its'' is from the Classical plural; both have been generalized for singular and plural in the dialects that use them.

In Armenian, the ablative case has several uses.
*Its principal function is to show motion away from a point in space or time.
**''KAGHAKEN katsi.''  -  I came FROM THE CITY. (Eastern Armenian;  ''KAGHAKITS gnets'')
**''ASTEGHEN heroo g'abrei.''  -  I used to live far FROM HERE.  (Ea.  ''ASTEGHITS heroo ei b'nakvoom'')

*The case also shows the agent when used with the passive voice of the verb.
**''INE misht g' sirveis.''  -  You were always loved BY ME.   (Ea. ''INDZITS misht eis sirvoom'')
**''AZAD'CHNEREN azadetsank.''  -  We were freed BY THE LIBERATORS. (Ea.  ''AZATOGHNERITS azatfetsink'')

*The ablative case is also important to comparative statements in colloquial Armenian.
**''Inch MEGHREN anoosh eh?''  -  &quot;What is sweeter THAN HONEY?&quot; (proverb)   (Ea.  ''Inch MEGHRITS e anoosh?'')

==Uralic languages==
===Finnish===
In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the ablative case is the sixth of the locative cases with the meaning &quot;from, off, of&quot;, e.g. ''pöytä&amp;nbsp;– pöydältä'' &quot;table&amp;nbsp;– off from the table&quot;. It is an outer locative case, used just as the [[adessive]] and [[allative]] cases to denote both being on top of something and &quot;being around the place&quot; (as opposed to the inner locative case, the [[elative]], which means &quot;from out of&quot; or &quot;from the inside of&quot;). In the locative meaning, the receding object was near the other place or object, not inside it.

The Finnish ablative is also used in time expressions to indicate start times as well as with verbs expressing feelings or emotions.

The Finnish ablative has the ending -lta or -ltä according to the regular rules of [[vowel harmony]].

Usage

* away from a place

::Katolta
:::Off the roof

::Pöydältä
:::Off the table

::Rannalta
:::From the beach

::Maalta
:::From the land

::Mereltä
:::From the sea

* to stop some activity with the verb lähteä

::lähteä tupakalta
:::stop smoking (in the sense of putting out the cigarette one is smoking now; literally 'leave from the tobacco')
::lähteä hippasilta
:::stop playing the game of tag (hippa=tag, olla hippasilla=playing tag)

* to smell/taste/feel/look/sound like something

::haisee pahalta
:::smells bad
::maistuu hyvältä
:::tastes good
::tuntuu kamalalta
:::feels awful
::näyttää tyhmältä
:::looks stupid
::kuulostaa mukavalta
:::sounds nice

===Hungarian===
The ablative case in Hungarian is used to describe '''movement away from a solid object'''.  For example, if one is walking away from a friend one could say: 
''a barátom'''tól''' jövök'' - I am coming (away from) my friend.

Note that this case in this example implies that the user was ''next to'' the solid object, and not inside it.  This means that if one said
''a postától jövök'' it would mean one is coming from being stood ''next to'' the post office, and that you were not inside the building. 

The application of [[vowel harmony]] gives two different suffixes:  '''-tól''' and '''-től'''.  These are applied to back- and front-vowel words respectively.

Its partners for movement towards a solid object and for being next to that solid object are the [[allative case]] and the [[adessive case]] respectively.   Its partners that correspond to movement away from, or out of, something are the [[delative case]] (for movement from a surface or from a Hungarian city) and the [[elative case]] (for movement out of a container or from out of an international city).

==Altaic languages==
===Azeri===

The ablative in [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]] (''{{Lang|az|çıxışlıq hal}}'') is expressed through the suffixes ''-dan'' or ''-dən''. Examples:

Ev - ev'''dən'''
&lt;br&gt;''House - from/off the house''

Aparmaq - aparmaq'''dan'''
&lt;br&gt;''To carry - from/off carrying''

===Turkish===
The ablative in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (''-den hali'' or ''uzaklaşma hali'') is expressed through the suffixes ''-den'', ''-dan'', ''-ten'', or ''-tan''. Examples:

Ev - ev'''den'''
&lt;br&gt;''House - from/off the house''

At - at'''tan'''
&lt;br&gt;''Horse - from/off the horse''

Taşımak - taşımak'''tan'''
&lt;br&gt;''To carry - from/off carrying''

Ses - ses'''ten'''
&lt;br&gt;''Sound/volume - from/off sound/volume''

&lt;br&gt;In some situations simple ablative can have a ”because of” meaning, in this situations ablative + ”dolayı” (because of) preposition is optional. 

Yüksek sesten (dolayı) rahatsız oldum. /  ''I was uneasy because of high volume. ''

The '''Adamic language''' is, according to [[Abrahamic traditions]], the language spoken by [[Adam and Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]], i.e., either the language used by [[God]] to address Adam, or the language invented by Adam ([[Book of Genesis]] 2:19). 

==Medieval==
{{see|Confusion of tongues|Lingua ignota}}

Traditional Jewish exegesis such as [[Midrash]] ([[Genesis Rabbah]] 38) says that Adam spoke [[Hebrew]] because the names he gives Eve - &quot;''Isha''&quot; ([[Book of Genesis]] 2:23) and &quot;''Chava''&quot; (Genesis 3:20) - only make sense in Hebrew. By contrast, [[Kabbalism]] assumed an &quot;eternal Torah&quot; which was not identical to the Torah written in Hebrew. Thus, [[Abulafia]] in the 13th century assumed that the language spoken in Paradise had been different from Hebrew, and rejected the claim then current also among Christian authors, that a child left unexposed to linguistic stimulus would automatically begin to speak in Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Eco (1993), p. 32 f.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Eco (1993) notes that Genesis is ambiguous on whether the language of Adam was preserved by Adam's descendants until the [[confusion of tongues]] (Genesis 11:1-9), or if it began to evolve naturally even before Babel (Genesis 10:5).&lt;ref&gt;Eco (1993), 7-10.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] addresses the topic in his ''[[De Vulgari Eloquentia]]''. He argues that the Adamic language is of divine origin and therefore unchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzocco, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes that according to Genesis, the first speech act is due to Eve, addressing the serpent, and not to Adam.&lt;ref&gt;''mulierem invenitur ante omnes fuisse locutam''. Eco (1993), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Divina Commedia]]'', however, Dante changes his view to another that treats the Adamic language as the product of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzocco, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; This had the consequence that it could not any longer be regarded immutable, and hence Hebrew could not be regarded as identical with the language of Paradise. Dante concludes (''Paradiso'' XXVI) that Hebrew is a derivative of the language of Adam. In particular, the chief Hebrew name for God in scholastic tradition, ''[[El (god)|El]]'', must be derived of a different Adamic name for God, which Dante gives as ''[[Close front unrounded vowel|I]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'' 26.133f.; Mazzocco, p. 178f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Modern==
{{unrefsect|date=December 2010}}
Elizabethan scholar [[John Dee]] makes references to an [[occult]] or angelic language recorded in his private journals and those of [[spirit medium]] [[Edward Kelley]]. Dee's journals did not describe the language as &quot;[[Enochian]]&quot;, instead preferring &quot;Angelical&quot;, the &quot;Celestial Speech&quot;, the &quot;Language of Angels&quot;, the &quot;First Language of God-Christ&quot;, the &quot;Holy Language&quot;, or &quot;Adamical&quot; because, according to Dee's Angels, it was used by Adam in Paradise to name all things. The language was later dubbed Enochian, due to Dee's assertion that the [[Biblical Patriarch]] [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] had been the last human (before Dee and Kelley) to know the language.

==Modern==
===Anne Catherine Emmerich===
The Catholic nun [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]] stated in her private revelations that most direct descendants of the Adamic language were [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]], [[Avestan language|Zend]] and [[Sanskrit|Indian]] languages. In this way Emmerich possibly identifies divine language as [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. According to her, it was written in sentence-level ideographic script that was more abstract than word-level ideographic script.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Catherine Emmerich, ''[http://www.all-jesus.com/scriptures/bible1-4.htm Life of Jesus Christ And Biblical Revelations]'', 6. Noah and his posterity, 7. The Tower of Babel (1790)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latter-day Saints movement===
[[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], in his [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible|version of the Bible]], declared the Adamic language to have been &quot;pure and undefiled&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Moses]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moses/6/6#6 6:6].&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Latter Day Saints]] believe it to be the language of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;John S. Robertson, [http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/EoM&amp;CISOPTR=5449&amp;filename=5450.pdf &quot;Adamic Language&quot;], in ''[[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]]'' (New York: Macmillan) '''1''':18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other early Latter-day Saint leaders, including [[Brigham Young]],&lt;ref&gt;Brigham Young, [http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/MStar&amp;CISOPTR=7661&amp;filename=7662.pdf &quot;History of Brigham Young&quot;], ''[[Millennial Star]]'', vol. 25, no. 28, p. 439 (1863-07-11), cited in ''[[History of the Church]]'' '''1''':297, footnote (Young prays in the Adamic tongue).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orson Pratt]]&lt;ref name = Pratt&gt;''[[Journal of Discourses]]'' [http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1953&amp;filename=100504_170857_cp342_Va_M230_J82_v02.pdf '''2''':342] (God = &quot;Ahman&quot;; Son of God = &quot;Son Ahman&quot;; Men = &quot;Sons Ahman&quot;; Angel = &quot;Anglo-man&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elizabeth Ann Whitney]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Woman's Exponent]]'' [http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/WomansExp&amp;CISOPTR=6638&amp;filename=6639.pdf '''7''':83] (1 November 1878) (Whitney sings a hymn in the Adamic tongue).&lt;/ref&gt; claimed to have received several words in the Adamic language in revelations. Some Latter Day Saints believe that the Adamic language is the &quot;pure language&quot; spoken of by [[Zephaniah]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] {{bibleverse-nb||Zephaniah|3:9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it will be restored as the universal language of humankind at the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oliver Cowdery]], [http://patriot.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/NCMP1820-1846&amp;CISOPTR=10065&amp;filename=5298.pdf &quot;The Prophecy of Zephaniah&quot;], ''[[Evening and Morning Star]]'', vol. 2, no. 18, p. 142 (March 1834).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce R.

''Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft) p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latter-day Saint [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] [[Orson Pratt]] declared that &quot;Ahman&quot;, part of the name of the settlement &quot;[[Adam-ondi-Ahman]]&quot; in [[Daviess County, Missouri|Daviess County]], [[Missouri]], was the name of God in the Adamic language.&lt;ref name = Pratt/&gt;

The Latter-day Saint [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|Endowment]] [[prayer circle]] once included use of the words &quot;Pay Lay Ale&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, ''The Mormon Murders'' (New York: St. Martins's Press, 1988) ISBN 0312934106, p. 69. &quot;the sign of the Second Token [is] raising both hands and then lowering them while repeating the incantation &quot;Pay Lay Ale&quot; three times&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; which some adherents believed were Adamic words meaning &quot;Oh God, hear the words of my mouth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tamra Jean Braithwaite, ''A Mormon Odyssey'' (Xlibris Co., 2003) ISBN 1413418783, p. 212. &quot;In 1990, several significant portions of the endowment ceremony performed worldwide in Latter-day Saint temples were eliminated&quot; including &quot;the chanting in unison of &quot;Pay Lay Ale, Pay Lay Ale, Pay Lay Ale&quot; (supposedly meaning &quot;Oh God, hear the words of my mouth&quot; in the Adamic language).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The untranslated words are no longer used in [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] and have been replaced by the English version.&lt;ref name = SLCM&gt;[http://www.utlm.org/newsletters/no76.htm &quot;Current Mormon Temple Ceremony Now Available&quot;], ''Salt Lake City Messenger'', no. 76, November 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Some think that the &quot;Pay Lay Ale&quot; sentence is derived from the Hebrew phrase &quot;pe le-El&quot;, פה לאל 'mouth to God'.&lt;ref name = SLCM/&gt;

Other words thought by some Latter-day Saints to derive from the Adamic language include ''[[deseret]]'' (&quot;honey bee&quot;, see [[Book of Ether|Ether]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/ether/2/3#3 2:3], or the Egyptian word ''dsrt,'' which refers to the honey bee), &lt;ref&gt;Dr. Hugh Nibley, ''Lehi in the Deseret and the World of the Jaredites'' (Shadow Mountain, 1998) ISBN 0875791328 pp. 184-85&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Ahman'' (&quot;God&quot;). 

In the Pearl of Great Price, a section of [[Joseph Smith Translation|Joseph Smith's translation of the Bible]], it refers to &quot;a Book of Remembrance&quot;, written in language of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moses/6/5,46#5 Moses 6:5, 46].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Redirect|Mahagonny|the ''Mahagonny-Songspiel''|Mahagonny-Songspiel}}
'''''Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny''''' ({{Lang|de|''Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny''}}) is a political-satirical [[opera]] composed by [[Kurt Weill]] to a German [[libretto]] by [[Bertolt Brecht]]. It was first performed in [[Leipzig]] on 9 March [[1930 in music#Opera|1930]].

==Composition history==
The libretto was mainly written in early 1927 and the music was finished in the spring of 1929, although both text and music were to be partly revised by the authors later. An early by-product, however, was the ''[[Mahagonny-Songspiel]]'', sometimes known as ''Das kleine Mahagonny'', a concert work for voices and small orchestra commissioned by the Deutsche Kammermusik Festival in [[Baden-Baden]] and premiered there on 18 July 1927. The ten numbers, which include the &quot;Alabama Song&quot; and &quot;Benares Song&quot;, were duly incorporated into the full opera. The opera had its premiere in [[Leipzig]] in March 1930 and played in Berlin in December of the following year. The opera was banned by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in 1933 and did not have a significant production until the 1960s.

Weill's score uses a number of styles, including [[ragtime|rag-time]], [[jazz]] and formal [[counterpoint]], notably in the &quot;[[Alabama Song]]&quot; (covered by multiple artists, notably [[The Doors]] and [[David Bowie]]). The lyrics for the &quot;Alabama Song&quot; and another song, the &quot;Benares Song&quot; are in English (albeit specifically [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] English) and are performed in that language even when the opera is performed in its original (German) language.

==Production history==
It has played in opera houses around the world. Never achieving the popularity of Weill and Brecht's ''[[The Threepenny Opera]],'' ''Mahagonny'' is still considered a work of stature with a haunting score. Herbert Lindenberger in his book ''Opera in History'', for example, views ''Mahagonny'' alongside Schoenberg's ''[[Moses und Aron]]'' as indicative of the two poles of modernist opera.

Following the [[Leipzig]] premiere, the opera was presented in Berlin in December 1931 at the [[Theater am Schiffbauerdamm]] conducted by [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]] with [[Lotte Lenya]] as Jenny, Trude Hesterberg as Begbick, and Harald Paulsen as Jimmy. Another production was presented in January 1934 in [[Copenhagen]] at the Det ny Teater.

Other productions within Europe waited until the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], some notable ones being in January 1963 in London at [[Sadler's Wells Opera]] conducted by [[Colin Davis]] and in Berlin in September 1977 by the [[Komische Oper Berlin|Komische Oper]].

It was not presented in the United States until 1970, when a short-lived April production at the Phyllis Anderson Theatre off Broadway starred [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as Jenny and Estelle Parsons as Begbick.

A full version was presented at the [[Yale Repertory Theatre]] in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1974, with [[Gilbert Price]] as Jimmy and Stephanie Cotsirilos as Jenny. [[Kurt Kasznar]] played Moses. The libretto was performed in an original translation by [[Michael Feingold]]; the production was directed by [[Alvin Epstein]].

In October of 1978, Yale presented a &quot;chamber version&quot; adapted and directed by Keith Hack, with [[John Glover]]{{dn|date=April 2011}} as Jimmy and [[June Gable]] as Begbick. Mark Lynn-Baker played Fatty; [[Michael Gross]]{{dn|date=April 2011}} was Trinity Moses.

Finally, in November 1979 it debuted at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in a [[John Dexter]] production conducted by [[James Levine]]. The cast included [[Teresa Stratas]] as Jenny, [[Astrid Varnay]] as Begbick, [[Richard Cassilly]] as Jimmy, [[Cornell MacNeil]] as Moses, [[Ragnar Ulfung]] as Fatty and [[Paul Plishka]] as Joe. In 2010, the Met released it on DVD.

The [[Los Angeles Opera]] presented the opera in September 1989 under conductor [[Kent Nagano]] and with a [[Jonathan Miller]] production. Other notable productions in Europe from the 1980s included the March 1986 presentation by the [[Scottish Opera]] in [[Glasgow]]; a June 1990 production in [[Florence]] by the Maggio musicale fiorentino. In October 1995 and 1997, the [[Paris Opera]] staged by [[Graham Vick]], under the baton of [[Jeffrey Tate]] starring [[Marie McLaughlin]] as Jenny, [[Felicity Palmer]] (1995) and [[Kathryn Harries]] (1997) as Begbick, Kim Begley (1995) and Peter Straka (1997) as Jimmy. The July 1998 [[Salzburg Festival]] production featured [[Catherine Malfitano]] as Jenny, [[Gwyneth Jones (soprano)|Gwyneth Jones]] as Begbick, and [[Jerry Hadley]] as Jimmy.

Productions within the US in the last ten years have included those in November 1998 by the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] directed by [[David Alden]]. Catherine Malfitano repeated her role as Jenny, while [[Felicity Palmer]] sang Begbick, and [[Kim Begley]] sang in the role of Jimmy. The Los Angeles Opera's February 2007 production directed by [[John Doyle (director)|John Doyle]] and conducted by [[James Conlon]] included [[Audra McDonald]] as Jenny, [[Patti LuPone]] as Begbick, and [[Anthony Dean Griffey]] as Jimmy. This production was recorded on [[DVD]], and subsequently won the 2009 [[Grammy Award]]s for &quot;Best Classical Album&quot; and &quot;Best Opera Recording.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The 51st Annual Grammy Awards Winners List |url=http://www.grammy.com/grammy_awards/51st_show/list.aspx#30 | accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reference necessary|1=In Ireland, the surname &quot;Mahony&quot; is accented on the first syllable, while in the US, the accent falls on the second syllable; the opera is written reflecting the Irish pronunciation. For this reason the Los Angeles Opera production (in English, not the original German), Mahoney was renamed &quot;Jimmy McIntyre.&quot;|date=April 2010}}

==Synopsis==
===Act 1===
''Scene 1: A desolate no-man’s land''

A truck breaks down. Three fugitives from justice get out: Fatty the Bookkeeper, Trinity Moses, and Leocadia Begbick. Because the federal agents pursuing them will not search this far north, and they are in a good location to attract ships coming south from the Alaskan gold fields, Begbick decides that they can profit by staying where they are and founding a pleasure city, where men can have fun, because there is nothing else in the world to rely on.

{{listen|filename=Mahagonny_Alabama_Song.ogg|title=Alabama Song|description=Excerpt from the &quot;[[Alabama Song]]&quot; as sung in act 1, scene 2}}
''Scene 2''

The news of Mahagonny spreads quickly, and sharks from all over flock to the bait, including the whore Jenny Smith, who is seen, with six other girls, singing the &quot;[[Alabama Song]]&quot;, in which she waves goodbye to her home and sets out in pursuit of whiskey, dollars and pretty boys.

''Scene 3''

In the big cities, where men lead boring, purposeless lives, Fatty and Moses spread the gospel of Mahagonny, city of gold, among the disillusioned.

''Scene 4''

Four Alaskan Lumberjacks who have shared hard times together in the timberlands and made their fortunes set off together for Mahagonny. Jimmy Mahoney and his three friends&amp;nbsp;– Jacob Schmidt, Bank Account Billy, and Alaska Wolf Joe&amp;nbsp;– sing of the pleasures awaiting them in &quot;Off to Mahagonny&quot;, they look forward to the peace and pleasure they will find there.

''Scene 5''

The four friends arrive in Mahagonny, only to find other disappointed travelers already leaving. Begbick, well-informed about their personal tastes, marks down her prices, but for the penurious Billy they still seem too high. Jimmy impatiently calls for the girls of Mahagonny to show themselves, so he can make a choice. Begbick suggests Jenny as the right girl for Jack, who finds her rates too high. She pleads with Jack to reconsider (&quot;Havana Song&quot;), which arouses Jim’s interest, and he chooses her. Jenny and the girls sing a tribute to &quot;the Jimmys from Alaska.&quot;

''Scene 6''

Jimmy and Jenny get to know one another as she asks him to define the terms of their contact: Does he wish her to wear her hair up or down, to wear fancy underwear or none at all? &quot;What is your wish?&quot; asks Jim, but Jenny evades answering.

''Scene 7''

Begbick, Fatty and Moses meet to discuss the pleasure city’s financial crisis: People are leaving in droves, and the price of whiskey is sinking rapidly. Begbick suggests going back to civilization, but Fatty reminds her that the federal agents have been inquiring for her in nearby Pensacola. Money would solve everything, declares Begbick, and she decides to soak the four new arrivals for all they’ve got.

''Scene 8''

Jimmy, restless, attempts to leave Mahagonny; it’s too peaceful for him. His three friends, in close harmony, try to persuade him to stay. Eventually their threats drive Jim, his anger vented, back to the city.

''Scene 9''

In front of the Rich Man’s Hotel, Jimmy and the others sit lazily as a pianist plays [[Tekla Bądarzewska-Baranowska|Thekla Badarzewska]]'s &quot;A Maiden’s Prayer&quot;. With growing anger, Jimmy sings of how his hard work and suffering in Alaska have led only to this. Drawing a knife, he shouts for Begbick, while his friends try to disarm him and the other men call to have him thrown out. Calm again, he tells Begbick that Mahagonny can never make people happy: it has too much peace and quiet.

''Scene 10''

As if in answer to Jimmy’s complaint, the city is threatened by a typhoon. Everyone sings in horror of the destruction awaiting them.

''Scene 11''

Tensely, people watch for the hurricane’s arrival. The men sing a hymn-like admonition not to be afraid. Jim meditatively compares Nature’s savagery to the far greater destructiveness of Man. Why do we build, he asks, if not for the pleasure of destroying? Since Man can outdo any hurricane, fear makes no sense. For the sake of human satisfaction, nothing should be forbidden: If you want another man’s money, his house or his wife, knock him down and take it; do what you please. As Begbick and the men ponder Jimmy’s philosophy, Fatty and Moses rush in with news: The hurricane has unexpectedly struck Pensacola, destroying Begbick’s enemies, the federal agents. Begbick and her cohorts take it as a sign that Jimmy is right; they join him, Jenny, and his three friends in singing a new, defiant song: If someone walks on, then it’s me, and if someone gets walked on, then it’s you. In the background, the men continue to chant their hymn as the hurricane draws nearer.

===Act 2===
''Scene 12''

Magically, the hurricane bypasses Mahagonny, and the people sing in awe of their miraculous rescue. This confirms Begbick’s belief in the philosophy of &quot;Do what you want,&quot; and she proceeds to put it into effect.

''Scene 13 At the renovated &quot;Do It&quot; tavern.''

The men sing of the four pleasures of life: Eating, Lovemaking, Fighting and Drinking. First comes eating: To kitschy cafe music, Jimmy’s friend Jacob gorges until he keels over and dies. The men sing a chorale over his body, saluting &quot;a man without fear&quot;.

''Scene 14: Loving.''

While Begbick collects money and issues tips on behavior, Moses placates the impatient men waiting in line to make love to Jenny and the other whores. The men sing the &quot;Mandalay Song&quot;, warning that love doesn’t last forever, and urging those ahead of them to make it snappy.

''Scene 15: Fighting.''

The men flock to see a boxing match between Trinity Moses and Jim’s friend Alaska Wolf Joe. While most of the men, including the ever-cautious Billy, bet on the burly Moses, Jim, out of friendship, bets heavily on Joe. The match is manifestly unfair; Moses not only wins but kills Joe in knocking him out.

''Scene 16: Drinking.''

In an effort to shake off the gloom of Joe’s death, Jimmy invites everyone to have a drink on him. The men sing &quot;Life in Mahagonny&quot;, describing how one could live in the city for only five dollars a day, but those who wanted to have fun always needed more. Jim, increasingly drunk, dreams of sailing back to Alaska. He takes down a curtain rod for a mast and climbs on the pool table, pretending it is a ship; Jenny and Billy play along. Jimmy is abruptly sobered up when Begbick demands payment for the whiskey as well as for the damage to her property. Totally broke, he turns in a panic to Jenny, who explains her refusal to help him out in the song &quot;Make your own bed&quot;&amp;nbsp;– an adaptation of the ideas he proclaimed at the end of act 1. Jim is led off in chains as the chorus, singing another stanza of &quot;Life in Mahagonny&quot;, returns to its pastimes. Trinity Moses assures the crowd that Jimmy will pay for his crimes with his life.

''Scene 17''

At night, Jim alone and chained to a lamppost, sings a plea for the sun not to rise on the day of his impending trial.

===Act 3===

''Scene 18: In the courtroom''

Moses, like a carnival barker, sells tickets to the trials. He serves as prosecutor, Fatty as defense attorney, Begbick as judge. First comes the case of Toby Higgins, accused of premeditated murder for the purpose of testing an old revolver. Fatty invites the injured party to rise, but no one does so, since the dead do not speak. Toby bribes all three, and as a result, Begbick dismisses the case. Next Jimmy’s case is called. Chained, he is led in by Billy, from whom he tries to borrow money; Billy of course refuses, despite Jim’s plea to remember their time together in Alaska. In virtually the same speech he used to attack Higgins,
