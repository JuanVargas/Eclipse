This page lists some links to '''ancient philosophy'''. In [[Western philosophy]], the spread of [[Christianity]] through the [[Roman Empire]] marked the end of [[Hellenistic philosophy]] and ushered in the beginnings of [[Medieval philosophy]], whereas in [[Eastern philosophy]], the [[spread of Islam]] through the [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] marked the end of [[#Ancient Iranian philosophy|Old Iranian philosophy]] and ushered in the beginnings of [[early Islamic philosophy]].

While there are ancient relations between the Indian [[Vedas]] and the Iranian [[Avesta]], the two main families of the Indo-Iranian philosophical traditions were characterized by fundamental differences in their implications for the human being's position in society and their view on the role of man in the universe. The first charter of [[human rights]] by [[Cyrus the Great]] as understood in the [[Cyrus cylinder]] is often seen as a reflection of the questions and thoughts expressed by [[Zarathustra]] and developed in [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] schools of thought.

==Indian philosophy==
{{Main|Indian philosophy}}
The ancient Indian philosophy is a fusion of two ancient traditions : [[Sramana]] tradition and Vedic tradition.

===Vedic philosophy===
[[Image:Vyasa.jpg|thumb|150px|right||[[Veda Vyasa]] (contemporary painting) attributed to have compiled the Vedas]]
Indian philosophy begins with the ''[[Vedas]]'' where questions related to laws of nature, the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked. In the famous [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] ''Hymn of Creation'' the poet says:

&quot;Whence all creation had its origin,
he, whether he fashioned it or whether he did not,
he, who surveys it all from highest heaven,
he knows--or maybe even he does not know.&quot;

In the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] view, creation is ascribed to the self-consciousness of the primeval being (''Purusha''). This leads to the inquiry into ''the one being'' that underlies the diversity of empirical phenomena and the origin of all things.  Cosmic order is termed ''rta'' and causal law by ''karma''. Nature (''prakriti'') is taken to have three qualities (''[[sattva]]'', ''[[rajas]]'', and ''[[tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]'').

*[[Vedas]]
*[[Upanishads]]
*[[Hindu philosophy]]

===Sramana Philosophy===
{{Main|Jain philosophy|Buddhist philosophy|Sramana}}
[[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] are continuation of the Sramana school of thought. The Sramanas cultivated a pessimistic worldview of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities. They laid stress on philosophical concepts like Ahimsa, Karma, Jnana, Samsara and Moksa.

===Classical Indian philosophy===
In classical times, these inquiries were systematized in six schools of philosophy. Some of the questions asked were:

*What is the ontological nature of consciousness?
*How is cognition itself experienced?
*Is mind (''chit'') intentional or not?
*Does cognition have its own structure?

The Six schools of [[Indian philosophy]] are:

*[[Nyaya]]
*[[Vaisheshika]]
*[[Samkhya]]
*[[Yoga]]
*[[Mimamsa]] (Purva Mimamsa)
*[[Vedanta]] (Uttara Mimamsa)

Other traditions of Indian philosophy include:
* [[Hindu philosophy]]
* [[Buddhist philosophy]]

'''Anaximander''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: '''{{Polytonic|Ἀναξίμανδρος}}''', ''Anaximandros''; {{IPA-en|æˌnæksɪˈmændə}}) (c. 610 BC – c. 546 BC) was a [[pre-Socratic]] [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher who lived in [[Miletus]], a city of [[Ionia]]; [[Milet]] in modern [[Turkey]]. He belonged to the [[Milesian school]] and learned the teachings of his master [[Thales]]. He succeeded Thales and became the second master of that school where he counted [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] and [[Pythagoras]] amongst his pupils.

Little of his life and work is known today. According to available historical documents, he is the first philosopher known to have written down his studies,&lt;ref&gt;[[Themistius]], ''Oratio'' 36, §317&lt;/ref&gt; although only one fragment of his work remains. Fragmentary testimonies found in documents after his death provide a portrait of the man.

Anaximander was one of the earliest Greek thinkers at the start of the [[Axial Age]], the period from approximately 700 BC to 200 BC, during which similarly revolutionary thinking appeared in China, India, Iran, the Near East, and Ancient Greece. He was an early proponent of [[science]] and tried to observe and explain different aspects of the universe, with a particular interest in its origins, claiming that nature is ruled by laws, just like human societies, and anything that disturbs the balance of nature does not last long.&lt;ref&gt;Park, David (2005) ''The Grand Contraption'', Princeton University Press ISBN 0-691-12133-8&lt;/ref&gt; Like many thinkers of his time, Anaximander's contributions to [[philosophy]] relate to many disciplines. In [[astronomy]], he tried to describe the mechanics of celestial bodies in relation to the Earth. In physics, his postulation that the indefinite (or [[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]) was the source of all things led Greek philosophy to a new level of conceptual abstraction. His knowledge of [[geometry]] allowed him to introduce the [[gnomon]] in Greece. He created a map of the world that contributed greatly to the advancement of [[geography]]. He was also involved in the [[politics]] of Miletus and was sent as a leader to one of its colonies.

Anaximander claimed that an 'indefinite' (''apeiron'') principle gives rise to all natural phenomena. Carl Sagan claims that he conducted the earliest recorded scientific experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Carl (1985) ''Cosmos'', Ballantine Books,  ISBN 0-345-33135-4, pg 143-144.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Anaximander, son of Praxiades, was born in [[Miletus]] during the third year of the 42nd [[Olympiad]] (610 BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;Refutation&quot;&gt;[[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]'' (I, 5)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Apollodorus]], Greek grammarian of the 2nd century BC, he was sixty-four years old during the second year of the 58th Olympiad (547-546 BC), and died shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Chronicles'', as reported by [[Diogenes Laërtius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' (II, 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Establishing a timeline of his work is now impossible, since no document provides chronological references. [[Themistius]], a 4th century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Rhetoric|rhethorician]], mentions that he was the &quot;first of the known Greeks to publish a written document on nature.&quot; Therefore his texts would be amongst the earliest written in [[prose]], at least in the Western world. By the time of [[Plato]], his philosophy was almost forgotten, and [[Aristotle]], his successor [[Theophrastus]] and a few [[Doxography|doxographers]] provide us with the little information that remains.  However, we know from Aristotle that Thales, also from Miletus, precedes Anaximander. It is debatable whether Thales actually was the teacher of Anaximander, but there is no doubt that Anaximander was influenced by Thales' theory that everything is derived from water. One thing that is not debatable is that even the ancient Greeks considered Anaximander to be from the Monist school which began in Miletus with Thales followed by Anaximander and finished with [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard D. McKirahan, ''Philosophy before Socrates'', Ch 5, 32-34&lt;/ref&gt;   3rd century [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rhetorician [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] depicts him as leader of the Milesian colony to [[Sozopol|Apollonia]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast, and hence some have inferred that he was a prominent citizen. Indeed, ''Various History'' (III, 17) explains that philosophers sometimes also dealt with political matters. It is very likely that leaders of Miletus sent him there as a legislator to create a constitution or simply to maintain the colony’s allegiance.

==Theories==
Anaximander's theories were influenced by the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythical]] tradition, and by some ideas of [[Thales]] – the father of philosophy – as well as by observations made by older civilizations in the East (especially by the Babylonian astrologists).&lt;ref&gt;C. Mosse (1984) ''La Grece archaique d' Homere a Eschyle''. Edition du Seuil. p236&lt;/ref&gt; All these were elaborated rationally. In his desire to find some universal principle, he assumed like traditional religion the existence of a ''cosmic'' order and in elaborating his ideas on this he used the old ''mythical'' language which ascribed divine control to various spheres of reality. This was a common practice for the Greek philosophers in a society which saw gods everywhere, therefore they could fit their ideas into a tolerably elastic system.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World publishing Company. Cleveland and New York. p168,169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars saw a gap between the existing ''mythical'' and the new [[rationalism|rational]] way of thought which is the main characteristic of the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]] (8th to 6th century BC) in the Greek [[city states]]. Because of this, they didn't hesitate to speak for a 'Greek miracle'. But if we follow carefully the course of Anaximander's ideas, we will notice that there was not such an abrupt break as initially appears. The basic elements of nature ([[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]]) which the first Greek philosophers believed that constituted the universe represent in fact the [[primordial]] forces of previous thought. Their collision produced what the mythical tradition had called ''cosmic'' harmony. In the old ''cosmogonies'' – [[Hesiod]] (8th-7th century BC) and [[Pherecydes of Syros|Pherecydes]] (6th century BC) – [[Zeus]] establishes his order in the world by destroying the powers which were threatening this harmony, (the [[Titans]]). Anaximander claimed that the cosmic order is not [[monarchic]] but [[geometric]] and this causes the equilibrium of the earth which is lying in the centre of the universe. This is the projection on nature of a new political order and a new space organized around a centre which is the static point of the system in the society as in nature.&lt;ref&gt;C. Mosse (1984) ''La Grece archaique d'Homere a Eschyle''. Edition du Seuil. p 235&lt;/ref&gt; In this space there is ''isonomy'' (equal rights) and all the forces are symmetrical and transferrable. The decisions are now taken by the assembly of [[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|demos]] in the [[agora]] which is lying in the middle of the city.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Vernart (1982) ''Les origins de la pensee grecque''. PUF Pariw. p 128, J. P. Vernart (1982) ''The origins of the Greek thought''. Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same ''rational'' way of thought led him to introduce the abstract [[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]] (indefinite, infinite, boundless, unlimited&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29pei%2Frwn2 ἀπείρων], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) as an origin of the universe, a concept that is probably influenced by the original [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] (gaping void, abyss, formless state) of the mythical [[Greece|Greek]] [[cosmogony]] from which everything else appeared.&lt;ref&gt;''The Theogony of Hesiod'', Transl. H. G. Evelyn White, 736-740&lt;/ref&gt; It also takes notice of the mutual changes between the four elements. Origin, then, must be something else unlimited in its source, that could create without experiencing decay, so that genesis would never stop.&lt;ref&gt;Aetios, I 3,3 [ [[Pseudo-Plutarch]]; DK 12 A 14.]; Aristotle, ''Phys.'' Γ5,204b 23sq. [DK 12 A 16.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Apeiron''===

{{Main|Apeiron (cosmology)}}

The [[bishop]] [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (I, 5), and the later 6th century Byzantine philosopher [[Simplicius of Cilicia]], attribute to Anaximander the earliest use of the word ''apeíron'' ({{Polytonic|ἄπειρον}} ''infinite'' or ''limitless'') to designate the original principle. He was the first philosopher to employ, in a philosophical context, the term ''[[Arche|arkhế]]'' ({{Polytonic|ἀρχή}}), which until then had meant ''beginning'' or ''origin''. For him, it became no longer a mere point in time, but a source that could perpetually give birth to whatever will be. The indefiniteness is spatial in early usages as in [[Homer]] (indefinite sea) and as in [[Xenophanes]] (6th century BC) who said that the earth went down indefinitely (to apeiron) i.e. beyond the imagination or concept of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Presocratic Philosophers|author=G.S.Kirk,J.E.Raven and M.Schofield|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=http://books.google.com/?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;pg|isbn=9780521274555}}p 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle writes (''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', I III 3-4) that the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratics]] were searching for the ''element'' that constitutes all things. While each pre-Socratic philosopher gave a different answer as to the identity of this element ([[water (classical element)|water]] for Thales and [[air (classical element)|air]] for Anaximenes), Anaximander understood the beginning or first principle to be an endless, unlimited primordial mass (''apeiron''), subject to neither old age nor decay, that perpetually yielded fresh materials from which everything we perceive is derived.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Plutarch]], ''The Doctrines of the Philosophers'' (I, 3).&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the theory of the apeiron in direct response to the earlier theory of his teacher, Thales, who had claimed that the primary substance was water. The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious concept of immortality and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This ''arche'' is called &quot;eternal and ageless&quot;. (Hippolitus I,6,I;DK B2)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Greek Philosophy|author=William Keith Chambers Guthrie|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg|isbn=9780521294201}} p83&lt;/ref&gt;

For Anaximander, the [[Principle (chemistry)|principle]] of things, the constituent of all substances, is nothing determined and not an element such as water in Thales' view. Neither is it something halfway between air and water, or between air and fire, thicker than air and fire, or more subtle than water and earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'' (II, 5)&lt;/ref&gt; Anaximander argues that water cannot embrace all of the opposites found in nature — for example, water can only be wet, never dry — and therefore cannot be the one primary substance; nor could any of the other candidates. He postulated the ''apeiron'' as a substance that, although not directly perceptible to us, could explain the opposites he saw around him.

Anaximander explains how the [[Classical element|four elements]] of ancient physics ([[air (classical element)|air]], [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[water (classical element)|water]] and [[fire (classical element)|fire]]) are formed, and how Earth and terrestrial beings are formed through their interactions. Unlike other Pre-Socratics, he never defines this principle precisely, and it has generally been understood (e.g., by Aristotle and by [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]) as a sort of primal [[Chaos (mythology)|chaos]]. According to him, the Universe originates in the separation of opposites in the primordial matter. It embraces the opposites of hot and cold, wet and dry, and directs the movement of things; an entire host of shapes and differences then grow that are found in &quot;all the worlds&quot; (for he believed there were many).

Anaximander maintains that all dying things are returning to the element from which they came (''apeiron''). The one surviving fragment of Anaximander's writing deals with this matter. Simplicius transmitted it as a quotation, which describes the balanced and mutual changes of the elements:&lt;ref&gt;[[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], ''Comments on Aristotle's Physics'' (24, 13):

: &quot;{{Polytonic|Ἀναξίμανδρος [...] λέγει δ' αὐτὴν μήτε ὕδωρ μήτε ἄλλο τι τῶν καλουμένων εἶναι στοιχείων, ἀλλ' ἑτέραν τινὰ φύσιν ἄπειρον, ἐξ ἧς ἅπαντας γίνεσθαι τοὺς οὐρανοὺς καὶ τοὺς ἐν αὐτοῖς κόσμους· ἐξ ὧν δὲ ἡ γένεσίς ἐστι τοῖς οὖσι, καὶ τὴν φθορὰν εἰς ταῦτα γίνεσθαι κατὰ τὸ χρεών· διδόναι γὰρ αὐτὰ δίκην καὶ τίσιν ἀλλήλοις τῆς ἀδικίας κατὰ τὴν τοῦ χρόνου τάξιν, ποιητικωτέροις οὕτως ὀνόμασιν αὐτὰ λέγων. δῆλον δὲ ὅτι τὴν εἰς ἄλληλα μεταβολὴν τῶν τεττάρων στοιχείων οὗτος θεασάμενος οὐκ ἠξίωσεν ἕν τι τούτων ὑποκείμενον ποιῆσαι, ἀλλά τι ἄλλο παρὰ ταῦτα· οὗτος δὲ οὐκ ἀλλοιουμένου τοῦ στοιχείου τὴν γένεσιν ποιεῖ, ἀλλ' ἀποκρινομένων τῶν ἐναντίων διὰ τῆς αἰδίου κινήσεως.}}&quot;

Punctuation does not exist in [[Ancient Greek]] and quotes usually blend with surrounding text. Consequently, deciding where they start and where they end is often difficult. However, it is generally accepted that this quote is not Simplicius' own interpretation, but Anaximander's writing, in &quot;somewhat poetic terms&quot; as it is mentioned by Simplicius,&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Whence things have their origin,&lt;br /&gt;
Thence also their destruction happens,&lt;br /&gt;
According to necessity;&lt;br /&gt;
For they give to each other justice and recompense&lt;br /&gt;
For their injustice&lt;br /&gt;
In conformity with the ordinance of Time.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Simplicius mentions that Anaximander said all these &quot;in poetic terms&quot;, meaning that he used the old mythical language. The goddess Justice ([[Dike (mythology)|Dike]]) keeps the cosmic order.
This concept of returning to the element of origin was often revisited afterwards, notably by Aristotle,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', I, 3, 983 ''b'' 8-11; ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', III, 5, 204 ''b'' 33-34&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Greek [[Tragedy|tragedian]] [[Euripides]]: &quot;what comes from earth must return to earth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Euripides''[[The Suppliants (Euripides)|Supplices]]'', v. 532&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in his ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', stated that Anaximander viewed &quot;...all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'' (1873) § 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmology===

[[Image:Anaximander cosmology-en.svg|thumb|left|280px|Map of Anaximander's universe]]

Anaximander's bold use of non-[[Greek mythology|mythological]] explanatory hypotheses considerably distinguishes him from previous cosmology writers such as [[Hesiod]]. It confirms that pre-Socratic philosophers were making an early effort to demythify physical processes. His major contribution to history was writing the oldest prose document about the [[Universe]] and the origins of [[life]]; for this he is often called the &quot;Father of [[Cosmology]]&quot; and founder of astronomy. However, [[pseudo-Plutarch]] states that he still viewed celestial bodies as deities.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Doctrines of the philosophers'', i. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Anaximander was the first to conceive a [[Mechanics|mechanical]] model of the [[world]]. In his model, the [[Earth]] floats very still in the centre of the infinite, not supported by anything. It remains &quot;in the same place because of its indifference&quot;, a point of view that Aristotle considered ingenious, but false, in ''[[On the Heavens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, On the Heavens, ii, 13&lt;/ref&gt; Its curious shape is that of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A column of stone&quot;, [[Aëtius (theologian)|Aetius]] reports in ''De Fide'' (III, 7, 1), or &quot;similar to a pillar-shaped stone&quot;, pseudo-Plutarch (III, 10).&lt;/ref&gt; with a height one-third of its diameter. The flat top forms the inhabited world, which is surrounded by a circular oceanic mass.

Such a model allowed the concept that [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]] could pass under it. It goes further than Thales’ claim of a world floating on water, for which Thales faced the problem of explaining what would contain this ocean, while Anaximander solved it by introducing his concept of infinite (''apeiron'').

[[Image:Persectives of Anaximander's universe.png|thumb|right|350px|Illustration of Anaximander's models of the universe. On the left, daytime in summer; on the right, nighttime in winter.]]

At the origin, after the separation of [[Temperature|hot and cold]], a ball of flame appeared that surrounded Earth like bark on a tree. This ball broke apart to form the rest of the Universe. It resembled a system of hollow concentric wheels, filled with fire, with the rims pierced by holes like those of a flute. Consequently, the [[Sun]] was the fire that one could see through a hole the same size as the Earth on the farthest wheel, and an eclipse corresponded with the [[Occultation|occlusion]] of that hole. The diameter of the solar wheel was twenty-seven times that of the Earth (or twenty-eight, depending on the sources)&lt;ref&gt;In ''Refutation'', Hippolytus reports that the circle of the Sun is twenty-seven times bigger than the Moon.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Moon|lunar]] wheel, whose fire was less intense, eighteen (or nineteen) times. Its hole could change shape, thus explaining [[lunar phase]]s. The [[star]]s and the [[planet]]s, located closer,&lt;ref&gt;Aetius, ''De Fide'' (II, 15, 6)&lt;/ref&gt; followed the same model.&lt;ref&gt;Most of Anaximander's model of the Universe comes from pseudo-Plutarch (II, 20-28):

: &quot;[The Sun] is a circle twenty-eight times as big as the Earth, with the outline similar to that of a fire-filled chariot wheel, on which appears a mouth in certain places and through which it exposes its fire, as through the hole on a flute. [...] the Sun is equal to the Earth, but the circle on which it breathes and on which it's born is twenty-seven times as big as the whole earth. [...] [The eclipse] is when the mouth from which comes the fire heat is closed. [...] [The Moon] is a circle nineteen times as big as the whole earth, all filled with fire, like that of the Sun&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anaximander was the first astronomer to consider the Sun as a huge mass, and consequently, to realize how far from Earth it might be, and the first to present a system where the celestial bodies turned at different distances. Furthermore, according to Diogenes Laertius (II, 2), he built a [[celestial sphere]]. This invention undoubtedly made him the first to realize the [[Axial tilt|obliquity]] of the [[Zodiac]] as the Roman philosopher [[Pliny the Elder]] reports in [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] (II, 8). It is a little early to use the term [[ecliptic]], but his knowledge and work on astronomy confirm that he must have observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the plane of the Earth to explain the seasons. The [[doxography|doxographer]] and theologian Aetius attributes to Pythagoras the exact measurement of the obliquity.

===Multiple worlds===

According to Simplicius, Anaximander already speculated on the plurality of [[worlds]], similar to [[atomism|atomists]] [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]], and later philosopher [[Epicurus]]. These thinkers supposed that worlds appeared and disappeared for a while, and that some were born when others perished. They claimed that this movement was eternal, &quot;for without movement, there can be no generation, no destruction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius, ''Commentary on Aristotle's Physics'', 1121, 5-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Simplicius, Hippolytus&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus, ''Refutation'' I, 6&lt;/ref&gt; reports Anaximander's claim that from the infinite comes the principle of beings, which themselves come from the heavens and the worlds (several doxographers use the plural when this philosopher is referring to the worlds within,&lt;ref&gt;Notably pseudo-Plutarch (III, 2) and Aetius, (I, 3, 3; I, 7, 12; II, 1, 3; II, 1, 8).&lt;/ref&gt; which are often infinite in quantity). [[Cicero]] writes that he attributes different gods to the countless worlds.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Nature of the Gods'' (I, 10, 25):

: ''&quot;Anaximandri autem opinio est nativos esse deos longis intervallis orientis occidentisque, eosque innumerabiles esse mundos.&quot;''
: &quot;For Anaximander, gods were born, but the time is long between their birth and their death; and the worlds are countless.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory places Anaximander close to the Atomists and the [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] who, more than a century later, also claimed that an infinity of worlds appeared and disappeared. In the [[Timeline of Western philosophers#Classical philosophers|timeline of the Greek history of thought]], some thinkers conceptualized a single world (Plato, Aristotle, [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Archelaus (philosopher)|Archelaus]]), while others instead speculated on the existence of a series of worlds, continuous or non-continuous (Anaximenes, Heraclitus, [[Empedocles]] and [[Diogenes Apolloniates|Diogenes]]).

===Meteorological phenomena===

Anaximander attributed some phenomena, such as [[thunder]] and [[lightning]], to the intervention of elements, rather than to divine causes.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Plutarch (III, 3):

: &quot;Anaximander claims that all this is done by the wind, for when it happens to be enclosed in a thick cloud, then by its subtlety and lightness, the rupture produces the sound; and the scattering, because of the darkness of the cloud, creates the light.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In his system, thunder results from the shock of clouds hitting each other; the loudness of the sound is proportionate with that of the shock. Thunder without lightning is the result of the wind being too weak to emit any flame, but strong enough to produce a sound. A flash of lightning without thunder is a jolt of the air that disperses and falls, allowing a less active fire to break free. Thunderbolts are the result of a thicker and more violent air flow.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Naturales quaestiones'' (II, 18).&lt;/ref&gt;

He saw the sea as a remnant of the mass of humidity that once surrounded Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Plutarch (III, 16)&lt;/ref&gt; A part of that mass evaporated under the sun's action, thus causing the winds and even the rotation of the celestial bodies, which he believed were attracted to places where water is more abundant.&lt;ref&gt;It is then very likely that by observing the moon and the tides, Anaximander thought the latter were the cause, and not the effect of the satellite's movement.&lt;/ref&gt; He explained rain as a product of the humidity pumped up from Earth by the sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Refutation&quot; /&gt; For him, the Earth was slowly drying up and water only remained in the deepest regions, which someday would go dry as well. According to Aristotle's ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'' (II, 3), Democritus also shared this opinion.

===Origin of humankind===

Anaximander speculated about the beginnings and [[Evolution|origin]] of animal life. Taking into account the existence of fossils, he claimed that animals sprang out of the sea long ago. The first animals were born trapped in a spiny bark, but as they got older, the bark would dry up and break.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Plutarch (V, 19)&lt;/ref&gt; As the early humidity evaporated, dry land emerged and, in time, humankind had to adapt. The 3rd century Roman writer [[Censorinus]] reports:

{{bquote|Anaximander of Miletus considered that from warmed up water and earth emerged either fish or entirely fishlike animals. Inside these animals, men took form and embryos were held prisoners until puberty; only then, after these animals burst open, could men and women come out, now able to feed themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Censorinus, ''De Die Natali'', IV, 7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anaximander put forward the idea that humans had to spend part of this transition inside the mouths of big fish to protect themselves from the Earth's climate until they could come out in open air and lose their scales.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]] also mentions Anaximander's theory that humans were born inside fish, feeding like sharks, and that when they could defend themselves, they were thrown ashore to live on dry land.&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that, considering humans' extended infancy, we could not have survived in the primeval world in the same manner we do presently.

Even though he had no theory of [[natural selection]], some people consider him as evolution's most ancient proponent. The theory of an aquatic descent of man was re-conceived centuries later as the [[aquatic ape hypothesis]]. These pre-Darwinian concepts may seem strange, considering modern knowledge and scientific methods, because they present complete explanations of the universe while using bold and hard-to-demonstrate hypotheses. However, they illustrate the beginning of a phenomenon sometimes called the &quot;Greek miracle&quot;: men try to explain the nature of the world, not with the aid of myths or religion, but with material principles. This is the very principle of scientific thought, which was later advanced further by improved research methods.

==Other accomplishments==
===Cartography===

[[Image:Anaximander world map-en.svg|thumb|right|280px|Possible rendering of Anaximander's world map&lt;ref&gt;According to John Mansley Robinson, ''An Introduction to Early Greek Philosophy'', Houghton and Mifflin, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Both [[Strabo]] and [[Agathemerus]] (later Greek geographers) claim that, according to the geographer [[Eratosthenes]], Anaximander was the first to publish a map of the world. The map probably inspired the Greek historian [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] to draw a more accurate version. Strabo viewed both as the first geographers after [[Homer]].

Maps were produced in ancient times, also notably in [[Egypt]], [[Lydia]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Babylon]]. Only some small examples survived until today. The unique example of a world map comes from late Babylonian tablet BM 92687 later than 9th century BCE but is based probably on a much older map. These maps indicated directions, roads, towns, borders, and geological features. Anaximander's innovation was to represent the entire inhabited land known to the ancient Greeks.

Such an accomplishment is more significant than it at first appears. Anaximander most likely drew this map for three reasons.&lt;ref&gt;As established by Marcel Conche, ''Anaximandre. Fragments et témoignages'', introduction (p.&amp;nbsp;43-47).&lt;/ref&gt; First, it could be used to improve navigation and trade between [[Miletus]]'s colonies and other colonies around the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. Second, [[Thales]] would probably have found it easier to convince the Ionian [[Polis|city-states]] to join in a federation in order to push the [[Medes|Median]] threat away if he possessed such a tool. Finally, the philosophical idea of a global representation of the world simply for the sake of knowledge was reason enough to design one.

Surely aware of the sea's convexity, he may have designed his map on a slightly rounded metal surface. The centre or “navel” of the world ({{Polytonic|ὀμφαλός γῆς}} ''omphalós gẽs'') could have been [[Delphi]], but is more likely in Anaximander's time to have been located near Miletus. The [[Aegean Sea]] was near the map's centre and enclosed by three continents, themselves located in the middle of the ocean and isolated like islands by sea and rivers. [[Europe]] was bordered on the south by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and was separated from [[Asia]] by the Black Sea, the [[Sea of Azov|Lake Maeotis]], and, further east, either by the [[Rioni River|Phasis River]] (now called the Rioni) or the [[Tanais]]. The [[Nile]] flowed south into the ocean, separating [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] (which was the name for the part of the then-known [[Africa]]n continent) from Asia.

===Gnomon===

The ''[[Suda]]'' relates that Anaximander explained some basic notions of geometry. It also mentions his interest in the measurement of time and associates him with the introduction in [[Greece]] of the gnomon. In [[Lacedaemon]], he participated in the construction, or at least in the adjustment, of [[sundial]]s to indicate [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es.&lt;ref&gt;These accomplishments are often attributed to him, notably by Diogenes Laertius (II, 1) and by the Roman historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], ''[[Preparation for the Gospel]]'' (X, 14, 11).&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, a gnomon required adjustments from a place to another because of the difference in latitude.

In his time, the gnomon was simply a vertical pillar or rod mounted on a horizontal plane. The position of its shadow on the plane indicated the time of day. As it moves through its apparent course, the sun draws a curve with the tip of the projected shadow, which is shortest at noon, when pointing due south. The variation in the tip’s position at noon indicates the solar time and the seasons; the shadow is longest on the winter solstice and shortest on the summer solstice.

However, the invention of the gnomon itself cannot be attributed to Anaximander because its use, as well as the division of days into twelve parts, came from the [[Babylonia]]ns. It is they, according to [[Herodotus]]' [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] (II, 109), who gave the Greeks the art of time measurement. It is likely that he was not the first to determine the solstices, because no calculation is necessary. On the other hand, equinoxes do not correspond to the middle point between the positions during solstices, as the Babylonians thought. As the ''Suda'' seems to suggest, it is very likely that with his knowledge of geometry, he became the first Greek to accurately determine the equinoxes.

===Prediction of an earthquake===

In his philosophical work [[De Divinatione]] (I, 50, 112), Cicero states that Anaximander convinced the inhabitants of [[Lacedaemon]] to abandon their city and spend the night in the country with their weapons because an earthquake was near.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/divinatione1.shtml  ''Da Divinatione'' (in Latin)]&lt;/ref&gt; The city collapsed when the top of the [[Taygetus]] split like the stern of a ship. Pliny the Elder also mentions this anecdote (II, 81), suggesting that it came from an &quot;admirable inspiration&quot;, as opposed to Cicero, who did not associate the prediction with divination.

==Interpretations==

[[Bertrand Russell]] in the ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]'' interprets Anaximander's theories as &lt;!-- the above quote as | CLARIFY: probably due to editing, the quote referenced here is unclear. --&gt; an assertion of the necessity of an appropriate balance between earth, fire, and water, all of which may be independently seeking to aggrandize their proportions relative to the others. Anaximander seems to express his belief that a natural order ensures balance between these elements, that where there was fire, ashes (earth) now exist.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy and Its Connection with Political and Social Circumstances from the Earliest Times to the Present Day'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1946).&lt;/ref&gt; His Greek peers echoed this sentiment with their belief in natural boundaries beyond which not even their gods could operate.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', claimed that Anaximander was a pessimist who asserted that the primal being of the world was a state of indefiniteness. In accordance with this, anything definite has to eventually pass back into indefiniteness. In other words, Anaximander viewed &quot;...all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance&quot;. (''Ibid.'', § 4) The world of individual objects, in this way of thinking, has no worth and should perish.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, ''Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks'' (Washington, D.C.: Regnery Gateway, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Heidegger]] lectured extensively on Anaximander, and delivered a lecture entitled &quot;Anaximander's Saying&quot; which was subsequently included in ''Off the Beaten Track''. The lecture examines the ontological difference and the oblivion of Being or ''[[Dasein]]'' in the context of the Anaximander fragment.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Off the Beaten Track'' (Cambridge &amp; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger's lecture is, in turn, an important influence on the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Jacques Derrida, ''Margins of Philosophy'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), pp. 66–7; Derrida, &quot;''Geschlecht'' II: Heidegger's Hand,&quot; in [[John Sallis]] (ed.), ''Deconstruction and Philosophy'' (Chicago &amp; London: University of Chicago Press, 1987), pp. 181–2; Derrida, ''Given Time: I. Counterfeit Money'' (Chicago &amp; London: University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 159, n. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

According to the ''Suda'':&lt;ref&gt;Themistius and Simplicius also mention some work &quot;on nature&quot;. The list could refer to book titles or simply their topics. Again, no one can tell because there is no punctuation sign in Ancient Greek. Furthermore, this list is incomplete since the ''Suda'' ends it with {{Polytonic|ἄλλα τινά}}, thus implying &quot;other works&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''architect''' is a person trained in the planning, design and oversight of the construction of buildings, and is licensed to practice architecture. To ''practice architecture'' means to offer or render services in connection with the design and construction of a building, or group of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use.&lt;ref name=ns.ca&gt;http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/bills/60th_1st/3rd_read/b115.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Etymologically, ''architect'' derives from the Latin ''architectus'', itself derived from the Greek ''arkhitekton'' (''arkhi-'', chief + ''tekton'', builder), i.e. '''chief builder'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=architect Online Etymology of the term &quot;architect&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Professionally, an architect's decisions affect public safety, and thus an architect must undergo specialized training consisting of advanced education and a ''practicum'' (or ''internship'') for practical experience to earn a license to practice [[architecture]]. The practical, technical, and academic requirements for becoming an architect vary by jurisdiction (see below).

The terms '''architect''' and '''architecture''' are also used  in the disciplines of [[landscape architecture]], [[naval architecture]] and often [[information technology]] (for example a [[software architect]]). In most of the world's jurisdictions, the professional and commercial uses of the term &quot;architect&quot;, outside of the etymological variants noted, is legally protected.

==Architects in practice==
The '''practice of architecture''' involves offering or rendering services that include pre-design services, programming, planning, providing designs, drawings, specifications and other technical submissions, the administration of construction contracts and the co-ordination of any elements of technical submissions prepared by others (such as by [[engineer]]s) and technical designers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ns.ca&quot;/&gt;

Architecture is a business in which technical knowledge, management, and an understanding of business are as  important as design. An architect accepts a commission from a client. The commission might involve preparing feasibility reports, building audits, the design of a building or of several buildings, structures, and the spaces among them. The architect participates in developing the requirements the client wants in the building. Throughout the project (planning to occupancy), the architect co-ordinates a design team. [[Structural engineer|Structural]], [[mechanical engineer|mechanical]], and [[electrical engineer]]s and other specialists, are hired by the client or the architect, who must ensure that the work is co-ordinated to construct the design.

===Design role===
The architect hired by a client is responsible for creating a design concept that meets the requirements of that client and provides a facility suitable to the required use. In that, the architect must meet with and question the client [extensively] to ascertain all the requirements and nuances of the planned project. This information, known as a program or brief, is essential to producing a project that meets all the needs and desires of the owner—it is a guide for the architect in creating the design concept.

Architects deal with local and federal jurisdictions about regulations and [[building code]]s. The architect might need to comply with local [[Urban planning|planning]] and [[zoning]] laws, such as required setbacks, height limitations, parking requirements, transparency requirements (windows), and [[land use]]. Some established jurisdictions require adherence to design and [[historic preservation]] guidelines.

===Documentation role===
Architects prepare the technical or &quot;working&quot; documents (construction [[Architectural drawing|drawings]] and [[Specification (technical standard)|specifications]]), usually coordinated with and supplemented by the work of a variety of disciplines [i.e., with varied expertise like mechanical, plumbing, electrical, civil, structural, etc.] engineers for the building services and that are filed for obtaining permits (development and [[building permit]]s) that require compliance with building, seismic, and relevant federal and local regulations. These construction drawings and specifications are also used for pricing the work, and for construction.

===Construction role===
Architects typically put projects to [[Call for bids|tender]] on behalf of their clients, advise on the award of the project to a [[general contractor]],  and review the progress of the work during construction. They typically review [[subcontractor]] [[shop drawings]] and other [[Submittals (construction)|submittals]], prepare and issue site instructions, and provide construction contract administration and Certificates for Payment to the contractor (see also [[Design-bid-build]]). In many jurisdictions, mandatory certification or assurance of the work is required.

Depending on the client's needs and the jurisdiction's requirements, the spectrum of the architect's services may be extensive (detailed document preparation and construction review) or less inclusive (such as allowing a contractor to exercise considerable [[design-build]] functions). With very large, complex projects, an independent [[Construction management|construction manager]] is sometimes hired to assist in design and to manage construction. In the [[United Kingdom]] and other countries, a [[quantity surveyor]] is often part of the team to provide cost consulting.

==Alternate practice and specializations==
Recent decades have seen the rise of specializations within the profession. Many architects and architectural firms focus on certain project types (for example, health care, retail, public housing), technological expertise or project delivery methods. Some architects specialize as [[building code]], [[building envelope]], [[Sustainable architecture|sustainable design]], [[historic preservation]], [[accessibility]] and other forms of specialist consultants.

Many architects elect to move into [[real estate development|real estate (property) development]], corporate facilities planning, [[project management]], [[construction management]], [[interior design]] or other related fields.

==Professional requirements==
{{Main|Professional requirements for architects}}
Although there are variations from place to place, most of the world's architects are required to register with the appropriate jurisdiction. To do so, architects are typically required to meet three common requirements: education, experience, and examination.

Educational requirements generally consist of a [[university degree]] in architecture. The experience requirement for degreed candidates is usually satisfied by a practicum or internship (usually two to three years, depending on jurisdiction). Finally, a Registration Examination or a series of exams is required prior to licensure.

Professionals engaged in the design and supervision of construction projects prior to the late nineteenth century were not necessarily trained in a separate architecture program in an academic setting. Instead, they often trained under established architects. Prior to modern times, there was no distinction between architects, [[engineer]]s and often [[artist]]s, and the title used varied depending on geographical location. They often carried the title of [[master builder]], or [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Search/surveyor surveyor], after serving a number of years as an apprentice (such as Sir [[Christopher Wren]]). The formal study of architecture in academic institutions played a pivotal role in the development of the profession as a whole, serving as a focal point for advances in architectural technology and theory.

==Professional title distinctions==
According to the [[American Institute of Architects]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aianova.org/pdf/BP_Arch_Positions.pdf &quot;http://www.aianova.org/pdf/BP_Arch_Positions.pdf&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; titles and job descriptions within American architectural offices might be as follows:

*'''Senior Principal / Partner''': Typically an owner or majority shareholder of the firm; may be the founder; titles may include president, chief executive officer, or managing principal/partner.

*'''Mid-level Principal / Partner''': Principal or partner; titles may include executive or senior vice president.

*'''Junior Principal / Partner''': Recently made a partner or principal of the firm; title may include vice president.

*'''Department head / Senior Manage'''r: Senior management architect or non-registered graduate; responsible for major department(s) or functions; reports to a principal or partner.

*'''Project Manager''': Licensed architect, or non-registered graduate with more than 10 years of experience; has overall project management responsibility for a variety of projects or project teams, including client contact, scheduling, and budgeting.

*'''Senior Architect / Designer''': Licensed architect, or non-registered graduate with more than 10 years of experience; has a design or technical focus and is responsible for significant project activities.

*'''Architect / Designer III''': Licensed architect or non-registered graduate with 8–10 years of experience; responsible for significant aspects of projects.

*'''Architect / Designer II''': Licensed architect or non-registered graduate with 6–8 years of experience, responsible for daily design or technical development of projects.

*'''Architect / Designer I''': Recently licensed architect or non-registered graduate with 3–5 years of experience; responsible for particular parts of a project within parameters set by others.

*'''[[Intern Architect|Intern-Architect]]''': Unlicensed architecture school graduate participating in defined internship program; develops design or technical solutions under supervision of an architect.

==Architect's fees==
{{See also|Earnings for architects}}
Architects' fee structures are typically based on a percentage of construction value, hourly rates or a fixed lump sum fee. Combinations of these structures are also common. Fixed fees are usually based on an a project's allocated construction cost and can range between 2 and 12% of new construction cost, for commercial and institutional projects, depending on a project's size and complexity. Residential projects range from 12 to 20%. Renovation projects typically command higher percentages, as high as 15-20%.

Overall billings for [[architectural firm]]s range widely, depending on location and economic climate. Billings have traditionally been dependent on the local economic conditions but, with rapid globalization, this is becoming less of a factor for larger international firms. Salaries also vary, depending on experience, position within the firm (staff architect, partner or shareholder, etc.) and the size and location of the firm.

==Professional organizations==
Refer to the international [[list of professional architecture organizations]] for groups created to promote career and business development in architecture. A wide variety of [[List of architecture prizes|prizes]] are awarded to architects to acknowledge superior buildings, structures and professional careers.

==Prizes, awards, and titles==
The most lucrative award an architect can receive is the [[Pritzker Prize]], sometimes termed the &quot;[[Nobel Prize]] for [[architecture]].&quot; Other prestigious architectural awards are the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]], the [[Richard H. Driehaus Prize for Classical Architecture]], the [[Alvar Aalto Medal]] ([[Finland]]), the [[Carlsberg Architecture Prize]] ([[Denmark]]), and the [[Governor General's Awards#Governor General's Medals in Architecture|Governor General's Awards]] ([[Canada]]). [[List of architecture prizes|Other awards]] for excellence in architecture are given by national professional associations such as the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA), the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA), and the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] (RAIC).

Architects in the [[UK]] who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education, or have in some other way advanced the profession, are elected Fellows of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] and can write [[FRIBA]] after their name if they feel so inclined. Architects in the [[United States|US]] who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education, or have in some other way advanced the profession, are elected Fellows of the [[American Institute of Architects]] and can write [[FAIA]] after their name.   Architects in [[Canada]] who have made outstanding contributions to the profession through contribution to research, scholarship, public service or professional standing to the good of architecture in Canada, or elsewhere, may be recognized as a Fellow of the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] and can write FRAIC after their name.

An '''abbreviation''' (from [[Latin]] ''brevis'', meaning ''short'') is a shortened form of a word or [[phrase]].  Usually, but not always, it consists of a letter or group of letters taken from the word or phrase. For example, the word ''abbreviation'' can itself be represented by the abbreviation ''abbr.'', ''abbrv.'' or ''abbrev.''

In strict analysis, abbreviations should not be confused with [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]] or [[Acronym and initialism|acronyms]] (including initialisms), with which they share some [[semantic]] and [[phonetic]] functions, though all three are connoted by the term &quot;abbreviation&quot; in loose parlance.&lt;ref name=harts&gt;{{cite book|title=New Hart's Rules: The handbook of style for writers and editors|publisher=Oxford University Press, 2005|id=ISBN 0-19-861041-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p167}}An abbreviation is a shortening by any method; a contraction is a reduction of size by the drawing together of the parts. A contraction of a word is made by omitting certain letters or syllables and bringing together the first and last letters or elements; an abbreviation may be made either by omitting certain portions from the interior or by cutting off a part; a contraction is an abbreviation, but an abbreviation is not necessarily a contraction. However, normally acronyms are regarded as a subgroup of abbreviations (e.g. by the Council of Science Editors).

Abbreviations can also be used to give a different context to the world itself, such as (PIN Number, wherein if the abbreviation were removed the context would be invalid)

== History ==
{{See also|Scribal abbreviation}}
Abbreviation has been used as long as phonetic script existed, in some senses actually being more common in early literacy, where spelling out a whole word was often avoided, initial letters commonly being used to represent words in specific application. By classical Greece and Rome, the reduction of words to single letters was still normal, but can default.

An increase in literacy has, historically, sometimes spawned a trend toward abbreviation. The standardization of English in the 15th through 17th centuries included such a growth in the use of abbreviation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j7/shortcuts.php Spelling Society : Shortcuts 1483-1660&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; At first, abbreviations were sometimes represented with various suspension signs, not only periods. For example, sequences like ‹er› were replaced with {{unicode|‹ɔ›}}, as in {{unicode|‹mastɔ›}} for ''master'' and {{unicode|‹exacɔbate›}} for ''exacerbate''. While this may seem trivial, it was symptomatic of an attempt by people manually reproducing academic texts to reduce their copy time. An example from the Oxford University Register, 1503:

{{quote|{{unicode|Mastɔ subwardenɔ y ɔmēde me to you. And wherɔ y wrot to you the last wyke that y trouyde itt good to differrɔ thelectionɔ ovɔ to quīdenaɔ tinitatis y have be thougħt me synɔ that itt woll be thenɔ a bowte mydsomɔ.}}}}
During the growth of [[philology|philological]] linguistic theory in academic Britain, abbreviating became very fashionable. The use of abbreviation for the names of &quot;Father of modern etymology&quot; [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and his friend [[C. S. Lewis]], and other members of the [[Oxford]] literary group known as the [[Inklings]], are sometimes cited as symptomatic of this. Likewise, a century earlier in Boston, a fad of abbreviation started that swept the United States, with the globally popular term [[Okay|OK]] generally credited as a remnant of its influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.illinoisprairie.info/chocokeh.htm |title=The Choctaw Expression 'Okeh' and the Americanism 'Okay' |publisher=Jim Fay |date=2007-09-13 |accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_250.html |title=What does &quot;OK&quot; stand for? |publisher=[[The Straight Dope]] |accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, the British greatly reduced their use of the full stop and other punctuation points after abbreviations in at least semi-formal writing, while the Americans more readily kept such use until more recently, and still maintain it more than Britons. The classic example, considered by their American counterparts quite curious, was the maintenance of the internal comma in a British organization of secret agents called the &quot;[[Special Operations, Executive]]&quot; — &quot;S.O.,E&quot; — which is not found in histories written after about 1960.

But before that, many Britons were more scrupulous at maintaining the French form. In [[French language|French]], the period only follows an abbreviation if the last letter in the abbreviation is ''not'' the last letter of its antecedent:  &quot;M.&quot; is the abbreviation for &quot;monsieur&quot; while &quot;Mme&quot; is that for &quot;madame&quot;. Like many other cross-[[English Channel|channel]] linguistic acquisitions, many Britons readily took this up and followed this rule themselves, while the Americans took a simpler rule and applied it rigorously.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Over the years, however, the lack of convention in some style guides has made it difficult to determine which two-word abbreviations should be abbreviated with periods and which should not. The U.S. media tend to use periods in two-word abbreviations like United States (U.S.), but not personal computer (PC) or television (TV). Many British publications have gradually done away with the use of periods in abbreviations completely.

Minimization of punctuation in typewritten matter became economically desirable in the 1960s and 1970s for the many users of carbon-film [[IBM Selectric typewriter#Ribbons|ribbons]], since a period or comma consumed the same length of non-reusable expensive ribbon as did a capital letter.

Widespread use of electronic communication through [[Mobile_phone#Mobile_phones_in_society|mobile phones]] and [[Internet#Social_impact|the Internet]] during the 1990s allowed for a marked rise in colloquial abbreviation. This was due largely to increasing popularity of textual communication services such as [[Instant messaging|instant-]] and [[text messaging]]. [[Short Message Service|SMS]] for instance supports message lengths of 160 characters at most (using the [[GSM 03.38]] character set). This brevity gave rise to an informal abbreviation scheme sometimes called [[SMS language|Textese]], with which 10% or more of the words in a typical SMS message are abbreviated.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David. [[Txtng: the Gr8 Db8|Txtng: The Gr8 Db8]]. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008. ISBN 978-0-19-954490-5&lt;/ref&gt; More recently [[Twitter]], a popular [[social network service]], began driving abbreviation use with 140 character message limits.

== Style conventions in English ==
In [[modern English]] there are several conventions for abbreviations and the choice may be confusing. The only rule universally accepted is that one should be ''consistent'', and to make this easier, publishers express their preferences in a [[style guide]].  Questions which arise include those in the following subsections.

=== Lowercase letters ===
If the original word was capitalized, then the first letter of its abbreviation should retain the capital, for example Lev. for Leviticus.  When abbreviating words that are originally spelled with lower case letters, there is no need for capitalization.

=== Periods (full stops) and spaces ===
A period (full stop) is sometimes written after an abbreviated word, but there are exceptions and a general lack of consensus about when this should happen. There is some confusion over the strict distinction between an abbreviation (a word shortened by omission of its ''end'' part) — requiring a full point (or full stop or period) — and a [[Contraction (grammar)|contraction]] (a word or compound shortened by omission of a ''middle'' part) — which does not need a full point or period. [[American English]] usage is less strict about this distinction and thus more likely to conclude a contraction, e.g., ''Jr.'' for &quot;Junior&quot; with a period{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

In [[British English]], according to [[Hart's Rules]], the general rule is that abbreviations terminate with a full stop (period), whereas contractions do not.&lt;ref name=&quot;harts&quot;/&gt;{{rp|p167}}

|Revd (or Rev.)

|R–t Hon...
|}

In [[American English]], the period is usually added if the abbreviation might otherwise be interpreted as a word, but some American writers{{who|date=May 2011}} do not use a period here.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Sometimes, periods are used for certain initialisms but not others; a notable instance in American English is to write ''United States'', ''[[European Union]]'', and ''[[United Nations]]'' as ''U.S.'', ''EU'', and ''UN'' respectively.

A third standard removes the full stops from all abbreviations (both ''&quot;Saint&quot;'' and ''&quot;Street&quot;'' become ''&quot;St&quot;'').  The U.S. [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] advises that periods should not be used with abbreviations on road signs, except for cardinal directions as part of a destination name.  (For example, ''&quot;Northwest Blvd&quot;'', ''&quot;W. Jefferson&quot;'', and ''&quot;PED XING&quot;'' all follow this recommendation.)

[[Acronym]]s that were originally capitalized (with or without periods) but have since entered the vocabulary as generic words are no longer abbreviated with capital letters nor with any periods.  Examples are [[sonar]], [[radar]], [[lidar]], [[laser]], [[SNAFU|snafu]], and [[Scuba set|scuba]].

Spaces are generally not used between single letter abbreviations of words in the same phrase, so one almost never encounters &quot;U.&amp;nbsp;S.&quot;.

When an abbreviation appears at the end of a sentence, use only one period:
The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C.

=== Plural forms ===
To form the plural of an abbreviation, a number, or a capital letter used as a noun, simply add a lowercase ''s'' to the end.
* A group of MPs
* The roaring '20s
* Mind your Ps and Qs

To indicate the plural of the abbreviation of a unit of measure, the same form is used as in the singular.
* 1&amp;nbsp;lb or 20&amp;nbsp;lb.
* 1&amp;nbsp;ft or 16&amp;nbsp;ft.
* 1 min or 45 min.

When an abbreviation contains more than one full point, ''[[Hart's Rules]]'' recommends to put the ''s'' after the final one.
* Ph.D.s
* M.Phil.s
* the d.t.s
However, subject to any house style or consistency requirement, the same plurals may be rendered less formally as:
* PhDs
* MPhils
* the DTs. (This is the recommended form in the ''New Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors''.)

According to ''Hart's Rules'', an apostrophe may be used in rare cases where clarity calls for it, for example when letters or symbols are referred to as objects.
* The x's of the equation
* Dot the i's and cross the t's
However, the apostrophe can be dispensed with if the items are set in italics or quotes:
* The ''x''s of the equation
* Dot the 'i's and cross the 't's

In Latin, and continuing to the derivative forms in European languages as well as English, single-letter abbreviations had the plural being a doubling of the letter for note-taking. Most of these deal with writing and publishing. A few longer abbreviations use this as well.

=== Conventions followed by publications and newspapers ===
==== United States ====
Publications based in the U.S. tend to follow the style guides of [[The Chicago Manual of Style]] and the [[Associated Press]].{{Verify source|date=May 2008}} The [[U.S. Government]] follows a style guide published by the [[U.S. Government Printing Office]].

==== United Kingdom ====
Many British publications follow some of these guidelines in abbreviation:
* For the sake of convenience, many British publications, including the [[BBC]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'', have completely done away with the use of full stops or periods in all abbreviations. These include:
** Social titles, like Ms or Mr (though these would usually not have had full stops — see above) Capt, Prof, ''etc.;''
** Two-letter abbreviations for countries (''&quot;US&quot;'', not ''&quot;U.S.&quot;'');
** Abbreviations beyond three letters (full caps for all except initialisms);
** Words seldom abbreviated with lower case letters (''&quot;PR&quot;'', instead of ''&quot;p.r.&quot;'', or ''&quot;pr&quot;'')
** Names (''&quot;FW de Klerk&quot;'', ''&quot;GB Whiteley&quot;'', ''&quot;Park JS&quot;'').  A notable exception is ''[[The Economist]]'' which writes ''&quot;Mr F. W. de Klerk&quot;''.
** Scientific units (see Measurement below).
* [[Acronym]]s are often referred to with only the first letter of the abbreviation capitalised. For instance, the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] can be abbreviated as ''&quot;Nato&quot;'' or ''&quot;NATO&quot;'', and [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] as ''&quot;Sars&quot;'' or ''&quot;SARS&quot;'' (compare with ''&quot;[[laser]]&quot;'' which has made the full transition to an English word and is rarely capitalised at all).
* [[Initialism]]s are always written in capitals; for example the ''&quot;British Broadcasting Corporation&quot;'' is abbreviated to ''&quot;BBC&quot;'', never ''&quot;Bbc&quot;''. An initialism is similar to acronym but is not pronounced as a word.
* When abbreviating scientific units, no space is added between the number and unit (&lt;nowiki&gt;100mph, 100m, 10cm, 10°C&lt;/nowiki&gt;). (This is contrary to the SI standard, see below.)

==== Miscellaneous and general rules ====
* A doubled letter also appears in abbreviations of some Welsh names, as in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] the double &quot;l&quot; is a separate sound: &quot;Ll. George&quot; for (British prime minister) [[David Lloyd George]].
* Some titles, such as &quot;Reverend&quot; and &quot;Honourable&quot;, are spelt out when preceded by &quot;the&quot;, rather than as &quot;Rev.&quot; or &quot;Hon.&quot; respectively.  This is true for most British publications, and some in the United States.
* A repeatedly used abbreviation should be spelt out for identification on its first occurrence in a written or spoken passage. Abbreviations likely to be unfamiliar to many readers should be avoided.

== Measurement ==
The [[International System of Units]] (SI) defines a set of base units, from which other &quot;derived&quot; units may be obtained.  The abbreviations, or more accurately &quot;symbols&quot; (using Roman letters, Greek letters in the case of [[ohm]] and [[micro-]] and other characters in the case of [[degrees celsius]]) for these units are also clearly defined together with a set of prefixes for which there are also abbreviations or symbols.
There should never be a period after or inside a unit; both '10 k.m.' and '10 k.m' are wrong — the only correct form is '&lt;nowiki&gt;10 km&lt;/nowiki&gt;' (only followed with a period when at the end of a sentence).

A period &quot;within&quot; a compound unit denotes multiplication of the base units on each side of it. Ideally, this period should be raised to the centre of the line, but often it is not.  For instance, '5&amp;nbsp;ms' means 5 millisecond(s), whereas '5&amp;nbsp;m.s' means 5 metre·second(s).  The &quot;m.s&quot; here is a compound unit formed from the product of two fundamental SI units — metre and second.  However, the [[Interpunct|middle dot]] symbol (·, unicode U+00B7, HTML &amp;amp;middot;) is the preferred way to represent compound units when available, e.g. &quot;5&amp;nbsp;m·s&quot;.

There should always be a [[Non-breaking space|(non-breaking)]] space between the number and the unit — '25&amp;nbsp;km' is correct, and '&lt;nowiki&gt;25km&lt;/nowiki&gt;' is incorrect. In Section 5.3.3. of [http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf ''The International System of Units (SI)''], the [http://www.bipm.org/en/home/ International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM)] states &quot;The numerical value always precedes the unit, and a space is always used to separate the unit from the number. … The only exceptions to this rule are for the unit symbols for degree, minute, and second for plane angle.&quot;&lt;ref name='BIPM style'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf|format=pdf |title=The International System of Units (SI) |accessdate=2008-04-18 |publisher=International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[letter case|case of letters]] (uppercase or lowercase) has meaning in the SI system, and case should never be changed in a misguided attempt to follow an abbreviation style.  For example, &quot;10&amp;nbsp;S&quot; denotes 10&amp;nbsp;siemens (a unit of conductance), while &quot;10&amp;nbsp;s&quot; denotes 10&amp;nbsp;seconds.  Any unit named after a person is denoted by a symbol with an upper case first letter (S, Pa, A, V, N, Wb, W), but spelt out in full in lower case, (siemens, pascal, ampere, volt, newton, weber and watt). By contrast g, l, m, s, cd, ha represent gram, litre, metre, second, candela and hectare respectively.  The one slight exception to this rule is that the symbol for litre is allowed to be L to help avoid confusion with an upper case ''i'' or a [[1 (number)|one]] in some [[typeface]]s — compare l, I, and 1.

Likewise, the abbreviations of the prefixes denoting powers of ten are case-sensitive: m (milli) represents a thousandth, but M (mega) represents a million, so by inadvertent changes of case one may introduce (in this example) an error of a factor of 1&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000. When a unit is written in full, the whole unit is written in lowercase, including the prefix: millivolt for mV, nanometre for nm, gigacandela for Gcd.

The above rules, if followed, ensure that the SI system is always unambiguous, so for instance mK denotes millikelvin, MK denotes megakelvin, K.m denotes kelvin.metre, and km denotes kilometre.  Forms such as k.m and Km are ill-formed and technically meaningless in the SI system, although the intended meaning might be inferred from the context.

== Syllabic abbreviation ==
A '''syllabic abbreviation''' is an abbreviation formed from (usually) initial [[syllable]]s of several words, such as ''[[Interpol]]'' = '''''Inter'''national'' + '''''pol'''ice''. It is basically a variant of the [[acronym]].

Syllabic abbreviations are usually written using [[lower case]], sometimes starting with a [[capital letter]], and are always pronounced as words rather than letter by letter.

Syllabic abbreviations should be distinguished from [[portmanteau]]s.

=== Usage ===
==== Different languages ====
Syllabic abbreviations are not widely used in English or French. The United States Navy, however, often uses syllabic abbreviations, as described below.

On the other hand, they prevailed in Germany under the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and in the Soviet Union for naming the plethora of new bureaucratic organizations. For example, ''[[Gestapo]]'' stands for '''''Ge'''heime '''Sta'''ats-'''Po'''lizei'', or &quot;secret state police&quot;. Similarly, ''[[Comintern]]'' stands for the ''[[Communist International]]''. This has caused syllabic abbreviations to have negative connotation, notwithstanding that such abbreviations were used in Germany even before the Nazis came to power, e.g., ''[[:de:Schupo|Schupo]]'' for ''Schutzpolizei''.

Syllabic abbreviations were also typical for the [[German language]] used in the [[German Democratic Republic]], e.g. ''[[Stasi]]'' for ''Staatssicherheit'' (&quot;state security&quot;, the secret police) or ''Vopo'' for ''Volkspolizist'' (&quot;people's policeman&quot;).

East Asian languages whose writing uses Chinese-originated [[ideogram]]s instead of an alphabet form abbreviations similarly by using key [[Chinese character|characters]] from a term or phrase.  For example, in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] the term for the [[United Nations]], ''kokusai rengō'' (国際連合) is often abbreviated to ''kokuren'' (国連). (Such abbreviations are called [[:ja:略語|ryakugo]] (略語) in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]). The syllabic abbreviation is frequently used for universities: for instance, ''Běidà'' (北大) for ''Běijīng Dàxué'' (北京大学, [[Peking University]]) and ''Tōdai'' (東大) for ''Tōkyō daigaku'' (東京大学, [[University of Tokyo]]).

==== Organizations ====
{{See also|Neologism}}

Syllabic abbreviations are preferred by the US [[Navy]] as it increases readability amidst the large number of [[initialism]]s that would otherwise have to fit into the same [[acronym]]s. Hence ''[[DESRON]] 6'' is used (in the full capital form) to mean &quot;Destroyer Squadron 6&quot;, while ''[[COMNAVAIRLANT]]'' would be &quot;Commander, Naval Air Force (in the) Atlantic.&quot;

'''Aphrodite''' ({{IPAc-en|En-us-Aphrodite.ogg|æ|f|r|ə|ˈ|d|aɪ|t|i}} {{Respell|af-rə|DY|tee}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ἀφροδίτη}}) is the  [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[goddess]] of [[love]], [[beauty]], and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].
Her [[interpretatio romana|Roman equivalent]] is the goddess  {{lang|la|'''[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]'''}}.
Historically, her cult in Greece was imported from, or influenced by, the cult of [[Astarte]] in [[Phoenicia]].

According to [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', she was born when [[Cronus]] cut off [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]' genitals and threw them into the sea, and from the sea foam (''aphros'') arose Aphrodite.

Because of her beauty other gods feared that jealousy would interrupt the peace among them and lead to war, and so [[Zeus]] married her to [[Hephaestus]], who was not viewed as a threat.  Aphrodite had many lovers, both gods like [[Ares]], and men like [[Anchises]]. Aphrodite also became instrumental in the [[Eros and Psyche]] legend, and later was both [[Adonis]]' lover and his surrogate mother. Many lesser beings were said to be children of Aphrodite. 

Aphrodite is also known as '''Cytherea''' (''Lady of Cythera'') and '''Cypris''' (''Lady of Cyprus'') after the two cult-sites, [[Kythira|Cythera]] and [[Cyprus]], which claimed her birth.  [[Myrtle (plant)|Myrtle]]s, [[dove]]s, [[sparrow]]s, [[horses]], and [[swan]]s are sacred to her. The Greeks further identified the Ancient Egyptian goddess [[Hathor]] with Aphrodite.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Eldred Witt, ''Isis in the ancient world'' (Johns Hopkins University Press) 1997:125.
ISBN 0-8018-5642-6&lt;/ref&gt;
Aphrodite also has many other local names, such as Acidalia, Cytherea and Cerigo, used in specific areas of Greece.   Each goddess demanded a slightly different cult but Greeks recognized in their overall similarities the one Aphrodite. Attic philosophers of the fourth century separated a celestial Aphrodite (Aprodite Urania) of transcendent principles with the common Aphrodite of the people (Aphrodite Pandemos).

==Name==
The [[Archaic Greece|archaic]] ([[Homeric Greek|Homeric]]) pronunciation of the name  {{lang|grc|Ἀφροδίτη}}
was approximately {{IPA|[ˌapʰroˈdiːtɛː]}}. In [[Koine Greek]], this became {{IPA|[ˌafroˈdiːtɛː]}}, changing further to {{IPA|[ˌafroˈditi]}} in [[Byzantine Greek]] by [[itacism]]. The most common English pronunciation of ''Aphrodite'' is {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|f|r|ɵ|ˈ|d|aɪ|t|i}}.

The etymology of  Greek {{lang|grc|Ἀφροδίτη}} is unknown.
[[Hesiod]] connects it by with {{lang|grc|ἀφρός}} (''aphros'') &quot;foam,&quot; interpreting it as &quot;risen from the foam&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'', 176ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
This has been widely classified as a  [[folk etymology]], and numerous speculative etymologies, many of them non-Greek, have been suggested in scholarship.
But Janda (2010) considers the connection with &quot;foam&quot; genuine, identifying the myth of Aphrodite rising out of the waters after Cronus defeats Uranus as a mytheme of [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Proto-Indo-European]] age.
According to this interpretation, the name is from ''aphrós'' &quot;foam&quot; and ''déatai'' &quot;[she] seems&quot; or &quot;shines&quot; (infinitive form *''déasthai''&lt;ref&gt;Pocket Oxford Classical Greek Dictionary (2002)&lt;br&gt;Oxford Grammar Of Classical Greek (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;), meaning &quot;she who shines from the foam [ocean]&quot;, a byname of the [[Hausos|dawn goddess]] ([[Eos (mythology)|Eos]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Janda&quot;&gt;Janda, Michael, ''Die Musik nach dem Chaos'', Innsbruck 2010, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; J.P. Mallory and D.Q. Adams (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Mallory, J.P. and D.Q. Adams. ''[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]]''. London: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishing, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; have also proposed an etymology based on the connection with the  Indo-European dawn goddess, from ''{{PIE|*ab&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;or-}}'' &quot;very&quot; and ''{{PIE|*d&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;ei}}'' &quot;to shine&quot;.

A number of speculative non-Greek etymologies have been suggested in scholarship.
The connection to [[Canaanite religion|Phoenician religion]] claimed by [[Herodotus]]  I.105,131) has led to inconclusive attempts at deriving Greek ''Aphrodite'' from a Semitic ''Aštoret'', via hypothetical Hittite transmission.
Another Semitic etymology compares Assyrian ''barīrītu'', the name of a female demon found in Middle Babylonian and Late Babylonian texts.&lt;ref&gt;see Chicago Assyrian Dictionary vol. 2 p.&amp;nbsp;111&lt;/ref&gt;
The name probably means &quot;she who (comes) at dusk,&quot; which would identify Aphrodite in her personification as the [[Hesperus|evening star]], a significant parallel she shares with Mesopotamian Ishtar.

Another non-Greek etymology suggested by  M. Hammarström,&lt;ref&gt;In ''Glotta: Zeitschrift für griechische und lateinische Sprache'' '''11''', 21 5f.&lt;/ref&gt;  looks to [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], comparing ''(e)pruni'' &quot;lord&quot;, an Etruscan  honorific loaned into Greek as
[[Prytaneis|πρύτανις]]. This would make the theonym in origin an honorific, &quot;the lady&quot;.  [[Hjalmar Frisk]] rejects this etymology as implausible.

The [[Etymologicum Magnum]] presents a medieval learned pseudo-etymology,  explaining Aphrodite as derived from the  compound {{lang|grc|ἁβροδίαιτος}} ''habrodiaitos'' (&quot;she who lives delicately&quot; from {{lang|grc|ἁβρός}} ''habros'' + {{lang|grc|δίαιτα}} ''diaita'') explaining the alternation between ''b'' and ''ph'' as a &quot;familiar&quot; characteristic of Greek &quot;obvious from the [[Ancient Macedonian language|Macedonians]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Etymologicum Magnum, Ἀφροδίτη&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparative mythology==

===Ancient Near Eastern parallels===
{{See|Ancient Semitic religion|Ishtar}}

The [[religions of the Ancient Near East]] have a number of love goddesses that can be argued to be predecessors of certain aspects of Aphrodite.

The Sumerian love goddess was [[Inanna]], reflected as [[Ishtar]]/[[Astarte]] in Semitic religion.

Other comparanda{{By whom|date=September 2010}} are Armenian [[Astghik]]and Etruscan [[Turan (mythology)|Turan]].
Hans Georg Wunderlich further connects Aphrodite with the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[snake goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;Wunderlich (R. Winston, tr.).''The secret of Crete'' (1987:134)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Egyptian snake goddess [[Wadjet]] was asocciated with the city known to the Greeks as ''Aphroditopolis'' (the city of Aphrodite).&lt;ref&gt;C.L. Whitcombe.''Minoan snake goddess''.8.''Snakes,Egypt magic and women''.[http://witcombe.sbc.edu/snakegoddess/ Minoan Snake Goddess]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lucian of Samosata]]  (''[[De Dea Syria]]'' .4) identifies Aphrodite with [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], the Phoenecian princess who [[Zeus]] transformed into a white bull abducted and carried to Crete.

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] states that the first to establish a cult of Aphrodite were the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]], after the Assyrians the [[Paphos|Paphians]] of Cyprus and then the Phoenicians at [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]]. The  Phoenicians in turn taught her worship to the people of [[Cythera]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+1.14.7 I. XIV.7]&lt;/ref&gt;

An origin of (or significant influence on) the Greek love goddess from Near Eastern traditions was seen with some skepticism in classical 19th century scholarship. Authors like A. Enmann (''Kypros und der Ursprung des Aphroditekultes'' 1881) attempted to portray the cult of Aphrodite as a native Greek development.
Scholarly opinion on this question has shifted significantly since the 1980s, notably due to [[Walter Burkert]] (1984), and the significant influence of the Near East on early Greek religion in general (and on the cult of Aphrodite in particular) is now widely recognized as dating to a period of [[Orientalizing period|Orientalization]] during the 8th century BC, when [[archaic Greece]] was on the fringes of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;see Burkert in his introduction to ''The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age'' (1992), especially in pp 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important parallel between Ishtar and Aphrodite is their identification as the [[Hesperus|evening star]]. [[Babylonian astrology]] associated the planet [[Venus]] with Ishtar. This presumably follows a yet earlier Sumerian tradition identifying [[Inanna]] with the planet Venus.
Scholars such as Bendt Alster{{Year needed|date=September 2010}} have suggested that this identification may go back to the [[Early Bronze Age]].
This identification is later than the archaic period of &quot;Orientalization&quot;. In native Greek tradition, the planet had two names, ''Hesperos'' as the evening star and ''Eosphoros'' as the morning star. The Greeks adopted the identification of the morning and the evening star as well as its identification as Ishtar/Aphrodite during the 4th century BC, along with other items of Babylonian astrology such as the [[zodiac]] ([[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]).

The Ancient Greeks and Romans often equated their deities with foreign ones in a process known as ''[[interpretatio graeca]]''. Aphrodite was equated by the Greeks to [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] [[Hathor]], [[Assyrian mythology|Assyrian]] [[Mylitta]], [[Phoenician mythology|Canaanite/Phoenician]] [[Astarte]] and [[Arabian mythology|Arabian]] [[Allāt|Alilat]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Comparison with the Indo-European dawn goddess===
It has long been accepted in [[comparative mythology]] that Aphrodite (regardless of possible oriental influences) preserves some aspects of the  [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Indo-European]] dawn goddess [[Hausos|*Hausos]] (properly Greek [[Eos]], Latin  [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]], Sanskrit [[Ushas]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil.''Ouranos-Vàruna:Ètude de mythologie compáree indo-européene''. Paris Maisonneuve.1934&lt;/ref&gt;

Janda (2010) etymologizes her name as &quot;she who rises from the foam [of the ocean]&quot; and points to Hediod's account of Aphrodite's birth as an archaic reflex of Indo-European myth.  Aphrodite rising out of the waters after Cronus defeats Uranus as a mytheme   would then be directly cognate to the [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] myth of [[Indra]] defeating [[Vrtra]], liberating [[Ushas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Janda&quot;/&gt;

Roman [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] was in origin a genuinely Italic reflex of the dawn goddess (besides [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]]), but she became identified with Aphrodite at such an early time that it is now difficult to recover elements of her native cult.

==Aphrodite Ourania and Aphrodite Pandemos==
By the late 5th century BC, philosophers might separate Aphrodite into two separate goddesses, not individuated in cult: ''Aphrodite Ourania'', born from the sea foam after Cronus castrated Uranus, and ''Aphrodite Pandemos'', the common Aphrodite &quot;of all the folk,&quot; born from Zeus and [[Dione (mythology)|Dione]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Plato]], ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' 181a-d.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[neo-Platonist]]s and eventually their Christian interpreters, Aphrodite Ourania figures as the celestial Aphrodite, representing the love of body and soul, while Aphrodite Pandemos is associated with mere physical love. The representation of Aphrodite Ourania, with a foot resting on a tortoise, was read later as emblematic of discretion in conjugal love; the image is credited to [[Phidias]], in a [[chryselephantine]] sculpture made for [[Elis]], of which we have only a passing remark by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Periegesis'' vi.25.1; ''Aphrodite Pandemos'' was represented in the same temple riding on a goat, symbol of purely carnal rut: &quot;The meaning of the tortoise and of the he-goat I leave to those who care to guess,&quot; Pausanias remarks. The image was taken up again after the Renaissance: see [http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/french/emblem.php?id=FALc195 Andrea Alciato, ''Emblemata / Les emblemes'' (1584)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, according to the character [[Pausanias (Athenian)|Pausanias]] in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' 180e.&lt;/ref&gt; Aphrodite is two goddesses, one older the other younger. The older, Urania, is the &quot;heavenly&quot; daughter of Uranus, and inspires homosexual male (and more specifically, [[Ephebic Oath|ephebic]]) love/eros; the younger is named Pandemos, the daughter of Zeus and Dione, and all love for women comes from her. Pandemos is the common Aphrodite. The speech of [[Pausanias (Athenian)|Pausanias]] distinguishes two manifestations of Aphrodite, represented by the two stories: Aphrodite Ourania (&quot;heavenly&quot; Aphrodite), and Aphrodite Pandemos (&quot;Common&quot; Aphrodite).&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Hunter, ''Plato's Symposium'', Oxford University Press: 2004, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult of Aphrodite==
The epithet ''Aphrodite Acidalia'' was occasionally added to her name, after the spring she used to bathe in, located in [[Boeotia]] ([[Virgil]] I, 720).  She was also called ''Kypris'' or ''Cytherea'' after her birth-places in [[Cyprus]] and [[Cythera]], respectively, both centers of her cult.   She was associated with [[Hesperides|Hesperia]] and frequently accompanied by the [[Oread]]s, [[nymph]]s of the mountains. Her festival, ''Aphrodisia'', was celebrated across Greece but particularly in [[Athens]] and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]. At the temple of Aphrodite on the summit of [[Acrocorinth]] (before the Roman destruction of the city in 146 BC) intercourse with her priestesses was considered a method of worshiping Aphrodite. This temple was not rebuilt when the city was reestablished under Roman rule in 44 BC, but it is likely that the fertility rituals continued in the main city near the agora.

Aphrodite was associated with, and often depicted with, the sea, dolphins, doves, swans, [[pomegranate]]s, sceptres, apples, [[Myrtus|myrtle]], rose trees, [[Lime (Citrus aurantifolia)|lime]] trees, clams, scallop shells, and pearls.

One aspect of the [[cult (religion)|cult]] of Aphrodite and her precedents that [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s much-reprinted ''The Age of Fable; or Stories of Gods and Heroes'' (1855 etc.) elided&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Our work is not for the learned, nor for the theologian, nor for the philosopher, but for the reader of English literature, of either sex, who wishes to comprehend the allusions so frequently made by public speakers, lecturers, essayists, and poets, and those which occur in polite conversation.&quot; Bulfinch's obituary in the ''Boston Evening Standard'' noted that the contents were &quot;expurgated of all that would be offensive&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; was the practice of [[Religious prostitution|ritual prostitution]] in her shrines and temples. The euphemism in Greek is ''hierodoule'', &quot;sacred slave.&quot; The practice was an inherent part of the rituals owed to Aphrodite's Near Eastern forebears, Sumerian [[Inanna]] and Akkadian [[Ishtar]], whose temple priestesses were the &quot;women of Ishtar,&quot; ''ishtaritum''.&lt;ref&gt;Miroslav Marcovich, &quot;From Ishtar to Aphrodite&quot; ''Journal of Aesthetic Education'' '''30'''.2, Special Issue: Distinguished Humanities Lectures II (Summer 1996) p 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice has been documented in Babylon, Syria and Palestine, in Phoenician cities and the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] colony [[Carthage]], and for Hellenic Aphrodite in [[Cyprus]], the center of her cult, [[Cythera]], [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] and in Sicily (Marcovich 1996:49); the practice however is not attested in Athens. Aphrodite was everywhere the patroness of the ''[[hetaira]]'' and courtesan. In [[Ionia]] on the coast of Asia Minor, ''hierodoulai'' served in the [[temple of Artemis]].

==Myths==
=== Birth ===
[[File:La naissance de Vénus.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'' by [[Sandro Botticelli]], 1485]]&quot;Foam-arisen&quot; Aphrodite was born of the sea  foam near [[Paphos]], Cyprus after [[Cronus]] severed [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus']] genitals and threw them behind him into the sea, while the [[Erinyes]] emerged from the drops of blood. [[Hesiod's Theogony]] described that the genitals &quot;were carried over the sea a long time, and white foam arose from the immortal flesh; with it a girl grew&quot; to become Aphrodite. Aphrodite floated in on a [[scallop]] shell. When she arose, she was hailed as &quot;Cyprian,&quot; and is referred to as such often, especially in the poetic works of Sappho. This myth of a fully mature Venus (the Roman name for Aphrodite), ''[[Venus Anadyomene]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Αναδυόμενη'' (''Anadyómenē''), &quot;rising up&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;Venus Rising From the Sea&quot;) was one of the iconic representations of Aphrodite, made famous in a much-admired painting by [[Apelles]], now lost, but described in the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]].

[[File:Aphrodites Rock.jpg|thumb|right|[[Petra Tou Romiou|Petra tou Romiou]] (&quot;The rock of the [[Greeks|Greek]]&quot;), Aphrodite's legendary birthplace in [[Paphos]], [[Cyprus]]]]

Thus Aphrodite is of an older generation than [[Zeus]]. ''[[Iliad]]'' (Book&amp;nbsp;V) expresses another version of her origin, by which she was considered a daughter of Dione, who was the original oracular goddess (&quot;Dione&quot; being simply &quot;the goddess, the feminine form of Δíος, &quot;Dios,&quot; the [[genitive]] of Zeus) at [[Dodona]]. Aphrodite herself was sometimes referred to as &quot;Dione.&quot; Once the worship of Zeus had usurped the oak-grove oracle at Dodona, some poets made him out to be the father of Aphrodite.

In Homer, Aphrodite, venturing into battle to protect her son, [[Aeneas]], is wounded by [[Diomedes]] and returns to her mother, to sink down at her knee and be comforted. &quot;Dione&quot; seems to be an equivalent of [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], the [[Earth Mother]], whom Homer has relocated to Olympus, and refers to a hypothesized original [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] pantheon, with the chief male god (Di-) represented by the sky and thunder, and the chief female god (feminine form of&amp;nbsp;Di-) represented as the earth or fertile soil.

Aphrodite's chief center of worship remained at [[Paphos]], on the south-western coast of Cyprus, where the goddess of desire had been worshipped from the early Iron Age as [[Ishtar]] and [[Ashtaroth]].  It was said that, as ''Kythereia'', she first tentatively came ashore at [[Cythera]],&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'' viii. 288; Herodotus i. 105; Pausanias iii. 23. § 1 ; Anacreon v. 9; Horace, ''Carmina'' i. 4. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; a stopping place for trade and culture between [[Crete]] and the [[Peloponnese|Peloponesus]]. Thus perhaps we have hints of the track of Aphrodite's original cult from the [[Levant]] to mainland [[Greece]].

In other tales, Aphrodite was a daughter of [[Thalassa (mythology)|Thalassa]] and [[Zeus]].

===Adulthood===
Aphrodite had no childhood: in every image and each reference she is born as an adult, nubile, and infinitely desirable. Aphrodite, in many of the late anecdotal myths involving her, is characterized as vain, ill-tempered and easily offended. Though she is one of the few gods of the [[List of Greek mythological characters|Greek Pantheon]] to be actually married, she is frequently unfaithful to her husband. [[Hephaestus]] is one of the most even-tempered of the Hellenic deities; in the narrative embedded in the ''Odyssey'' Aphrodite seems to prefer [[Ares]], the volatile god of war, as she was attracted to his violent nature. She is one of a few characters who played a major part in the original cause of the [[Trojan War]] itself: not only did she offer [[Helen]] of Troy to [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], but the abduction was accomplished when Paris, seeing Helen for the first time, was inflamed with desire to have her&amp;mdash;which is Aphrodite's realm.

Due to her immense beauty, Zeus was frightened that she would be the cause of violence between the other gods. He married her off to [[Hephaestus]], the dour, humorless god of smithing. In another version of this story, [[Hera]], Hephaestus' mother, had cast him off Olympus; deeming him ugly and deformed.  His revenge was to trap her in a magic throne, and then to demand Aphrodite's hand in return for Hera's release. Hephaestus was overjoyed at being married to the goddess of beauty and forged her beautiful jewelry, including the cestus, a [[girdle]] that made her even more irresistible to men. Her unhappiness with her marriage caused Aphrodite to seek out companionship from others, most frequently [[Ares]], but also [[Adonis]].

===Aphrodite and Psyche===
{{Main|Cupid and Psyche}}
Aphrodite figures as a secondary character in the Tale of Eros and Psyche, which first appeared as a digressive story told by an old woman in [[Lucius Apuleius]]' novel, ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', written in the second century&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;!--this extended re-telling needs to be briefer, concentrating on Aphrodite's (peripheral) role--&gt; In it Aphrodite was jealous of the beauty of a mortal woman named Psyche. She asked [[Eros]] to use his golden arrows to cause Psyche to fall in love with the ugliest man on earth.  Eros agreed, but then fell in love with Psyche on his own, by accidentally pricking himself with a golden arrow.

Meanwhile, Psyche's parents were anxious that their daughter remained unmarried. They consulted an [[oracle]] who told them she was destined for no mortal lover, but a creature that lived on top of a particular mountain, that even the gods themselves feared. Eros had arranged for the [[oracle]] to say this.  Psyche was resigned to her fate and climbed to the top of the mountain. She told the townsfolk that followed her to leave and let her face her fate on her own. There, [[Zephyrus]], the west wind, gently floated her downwards. She entered a cave on the appointed mountain, surprised to find it full of jewelry and finery. Eros visited her every night in the cave and they made passionate love; he demanded only that she never light any lamps because he did not want her to know who he was (having wings made him distinctive).  Her two sisters, jealous of Psyche, convinced her that her husband was a monster, and she should strike him with a dagger. So one night  she lit a lamp, but recognizing Eros instantly, she dropped her dagger. Oil spilled from the lamp onto his shoulder, awaking him, and he fled, saying &quot;Love cannot live where there is no trust!&quot;

[[File:Turtle Aphrodite AO20126 mp3h9188.jpg|thumb|right|''Aphrodite Ourania'', draped rather than [[nude]], and with her foot resting on a tortoise ([[Musée du Louvre]])]]
When Psyche told her two jealous elder sisters what had happened, they rejoiced secretly and each separately walked to the top of the mountain and did as Psyche described her entry to the cave, hoping Eros would pick them instead. Eros was still heart broken and did not pick them and they fell to their deaths at the base of the mountain.

Psyche searched for her love across much of Greece, finally stumbling into a temple to [[Demeter]], where the floor was covered with piles of mixed grains. She started sorting the grains into organized piles and, when she finished, Demeter spoke to her, telling her that the best way to find Eros was to find his mother, Aphrodite, and earn her blessing. Psyche found a temple to Aphrodite and entered it. Aphrodite assigned her a similar task to Demeter's temple, but gave her an impossible deadline to finish it by. Eros intervened, for he still loved her, and caused some ants to organize the grains for her. Aphrodite was outraged at her success and told her to go to a field where deadly golden sheep grazed and get some golden wool. Psyche went to the field and saw the sheep but was stopped by a river-god, whose river she had to cross to enter the field.  He told her the sheep were mean and vicious and would kill her, but if she waited until noontime, the sheep would go into the shade on the other side of the field and sleep; she could pick the wool that stuck to the branches and bark of the trees.  Psyche did so and Aphrodite was even more outraged at her survival and success.

Finally, Aphrodite claimed that the stress of caring for her son, depressed and ill as a result of Psyche's unfaithfulness, had caused her to lose some of her beauty.  Psyche was to go to [[Hades]] and ask [[Persephone]], the queen of the underworld, for a bit of her beauty in a black box that Aphrodite gave to Psyche. Psyche walked to a tower, deciding that the quickest way to the underworld would be to die.  A voice stopped her at the last moment and told her a route that would allow her to enter and return still living, as well as telling her how to pass the three-headed dog [[Cerberus]], [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] and the other dangers of the route. She was to not lend a hand to anyone in need. She baked two barley cakes for Cerberus, and took two coins for Charon. She pacified Cerberus with the barley cake and paid Charon to take her to Hades. On the way there, she saw hands reaching out of the water. A voice told her to toss a  barley cake to them. She refused. Once there, Persephone said she would be glad to do Aphrodite a favor. She once more paid Charon, and gave the other barley cake to Cerberus.

Psyche left the underworld and decided to open the box and take a little bit of the beauty for herself, thinking that if she did so, Eros would surely love her. Inside was a &quot;[[Wiktionary:stygian|Stygian]] sleep,&quot; which overtook her.  Eros, who had forgiven her, flew to her body and wiped the sleep from her eyes, then begged Zeus and Aphrodite for their consent to his wedding of Psyche. They agreed and Zeus made her immortal. Aphrodite danced at the wedding of Eros and Psyche, and their subsequent child was named Hedone, or (in the Roman mythology) [[Voluptas]].

===Adonis===
Aphrodite was [[Adonis]]' lover and a surrogate mother to him. [[Cinyras]], the King of [[Cyprus]], had an intoxicatingly beautiful daughter named [[Myrrha]]. When Myrrha's mother commits [[Hubris]] against Aphrodite by claiming her daughter is more beautiful than the famed goddess, Myrrha is punished with a never ending lust for her own father. Cinyras is repulsed by this, but Myrrha disguises herself as a prostitute, and secretly sleeps with her father at night. Eventually, Myrrha becomes pregnant and is discovered by Cinyras. In a rage, he chases her out of the house with a knife. Myrrha flees from him, praying to the gods for mercy as she runs. The gods hear her plea, and change her into a Myrrh tree so her father cannot kill her. Eventually, Cinyras takes his own life in an attempt to restore the family's honor.

Myrrha gives birth to a baby boy named Adonis. Aphrodite happens by the Myrrh tree and, seeing him, takes pity on the infant. She places Adonis in a box, and takes him down to [[Hades]] so that [[Persephone]] can care for him. Adonis grows into a strikingly handsome young man, and Aphrodite eventually returns for him. Persephone, however, is loath to give him up, and wishes Adonis would stay with her in the underworld. The two goddesses begin such a quarrel that Zeus is forced to intercede. He decrees that Adonis will spend a third of the year with Aphrodite, a third of the year with Persephone, and a third of the year with whomever he wishes. Adonis, of course, chooses Aphrodite.

Adonis begins his year on the earth with Aphrodite. One of his greatest passions is hunting, and although Aphrodite is not naturally a hunter, she takes up the sport just so she can be with Adonis. They spend every waking hour with one another, and Aphrodite is enraptured with him. However, her anxiety begins to grow over her neglected duties, and she is forced to leave him for a short time. Before she leaves, she gives Adonis one warning: do not attack an animal who shows no fear. Adonis agrees to her advice, but, secretly doubting her skills as a huntress, quickly forgets her warning.

Not long after Aphrodite leaves, Adonis comes across an enormous wild boar, much larger than any he has ever seen. It is suggested that the boar is the god Ares, one of Aphrodite's lovers made jealous through her constant doting on Adonis. Although boars are dangerous and will charge a hunter if provoked, Adonis disregards Aphrodite's warning and pursues the giant creature. Soon, however, Adonis is the one being pursued; he is no match for the giant boar. In the attack, Adonis is [[castrated]] by the boar, and dies from a loss of blood. Aphrodite rushes back to his side, but she is too late to save him and can only mourn over his body. Wherever Adonis' blood falls, Aphrodite causes [[anemone]]s to grow in his memory. She vows that on the anniversary of his death, every year there will be a festival held in his honor.

On his death, Adonis goes back to the underworld, and Persephone is delighted to see him again. Eventually, Aphrodite realizes that he is there, and rushes back to retrieve him. Again, she and Persephone bicker over who is allowed to keep Adonis until Zeus intervenes. This time, he says that Adonis must spend six months with Aphrodite and six months with Persephone, the way it should have been in the first place.

===The Judgement of Paris===
{{Main|Judgement of Paris}}

The gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]] (the eventual parents of [[Achilles]]). Only the goddess [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]] (Discord) was not invited, but she arrived with a [[Apple of Discord|golden apple]] inscribed with the word ''kallistēi'' (&quot;to the fairest one&quot;), which she threw among the goddesses. Aphrodite, [[Hera]], and [[Athena]] all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.

[[File:Aphroditi Soloi.jpg|thumb|left|Aphrodite of [[Soli, Cyprus|Soli]], probably Roman ca.&amp;nbsp;100 BC, Archeological Museum, [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]]]]

The goddesses chose to place the matter before [[Zeus]], who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]. Hera tried to bribe Paris with [[Asia Minor]], while Athena offered wisdom, fame and glory in battle, but Aphrodite whispered to Paris that if he were to choose her as the fairest he would have the most beautiful mortal woman in the world as a wife, and he accordingly chose her. This woman was [[Helen]]. The other goddesses were enraged by this and through Helen's abduction by Paris they brought about the [[Trojan War]].

===Pygmalion and Galatea===
[[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]] was a sculptor who had never found a woman worthy of his love. Aphrodite took pity on him and decided to show him the wonders of love. One day, Pygmalion was inspired by a dream of Aphrodite to make a woman out of [[ivory]] resembling her image, and he called her [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]]. He fell in love with the statue and decided he could not live without her. He prayed to Aphrodite, who carried out the final phase of her plan and brought the exquisite sculpture to life. Pygmalion loved Galatea and they were soon married.

Another version of this myth tells that the women of the village where Pygmalion lived grew angry that he had not married. They asked Aphrodite to force him to marry. Aphrodite agreed and went that very night to Pygmalion, and asked him to pick a woman to marry. She told him that if he did not pick one, she would do so for him. Not wanting to be married, he begged her for more time, asking that he be allowed to make a sculpture of Aphrodite before he had to choose his bride. Flattered, she accepted.

Pygmalion spent a lot of time making small clay sculptures of the goddess, claiming it was needed so he could pick the right pose. As he started making the actual sculpture he was shocked to discover he actually wanted to finish, even though he knew he would have to marry someone when he finished. The reason he wanted to finish it was that he had fallen in love with the sculpture. The more he worked on it, the more it changed, until it no longer resembled Aphrodite at all.

At the very moment Pygmalion stepped away from the finished sculpture Aphrodite appeared and told him to choose his bride. Pygmalion chose the statue. Aphrodite told him that could not be, and asked him again to choose a bride. Pygmalion put his arms around the statue, and asked Aphrodite to turn him into a statue so he could be with her. Aphrodite took pity on him and brought the statue to life instead.

===Other tales===
In one version of the story of [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]], she was the catalyst for his death. He scorned the worship of Aphrodite for [[Artemis]] and, in revenge, Aphrodite caused his stepmother, [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], to fall in love with him, knowing Hippolytus would reject her. In the most popular version of the story, as told in the play ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'' by [[Euripides]], Phaedra seeks revenge against Hippolytus by killing herself and, in her [[suicide note]], telling [[Theseus]], her husband and Hippolytus' father, that Hippolytus had raped her. Hippolytus was oath-bound not to mention Phaedra's love for him and nobly refused to defend himself despite the consequences. Theseus then cursed his son, a curse that [[Poseidon]] was bound to fulfill and so Hippolytus was laid low by a bull from the sea that caused his chariot-team to panic and wreck his vehicle. Hippolytus forgives his father before he dies and [[Artemis]] reveals the truth to Theseus before vowing to kill the one Aphrodite loves ([[Adonis]]) for revenge.

[[Glaucus (son of Sisyphus)|Glaucus]] of Corinth angered Aphrodite and she made her horses angry during the funeral games of King [[Pelias]]. They tore him apart. His ghost supposedly frightened horses during the [[Isthmian Games]].

In one Greek myth, Aphrodite placed the curse of snakes for hair and the stone-gaze upon [[Medusa]] and her sisters. Aphrodite was jealous of the three sisters beauty, and she grew so jealous she cursed them.

In [[mathematics]], a [[binary relation]] ''R'' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' is '''antisymmetric''' if, for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''X''
:if ''R(a,b)'' and ''R(b,a)'', then ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'',
or, equivalently,
:if ''R(a,b)'' with ''a''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''b'', then ''R(b,a)'' must not hold.

In [[mathematical notation]], this is:

:&lt;math&gt;\forall a, b \in X,\ R(a,b) \and R(b,a) \; \Rightarrow \; a = b&lt;/math&gt;

or, equivalently,

&lt;!-- this is the same formula as above, but due to the addition of the negation, it is more clear where the term anti-symmetric comes from --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a, b \in X,\ R(a,b) \and a \ne b \Rightarrow \lnot  R(b,a) .&lt;/math&gt;

An example of an antisymmetric relation is the [[subset]] relation:
:&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B \and B \subseteq A \Rightarrow A = B&lt;/math&gt;
Or in words, if every [[Element (mathematics)|element]] in A also is in B and all elements in B are in A, then A and B must be equal, i.e. containing all the same elements.

[[partial order|Partial]] and [[total order]]s are antisymmetric by definition. Therefore the usual [[order relation]] ≤ on the [[real number]]s, the [[subset order]] ⊆ on the subsets of any given set and the [[divisibility]] order of the [[natural number]]s are antisymmetric. For example, if for two real numbers ''x'' and ''y'' both [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] ''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x'' hold then ''x'' and ''y'' must be equal.

A relation can be both [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] and antisymmetric (e.g., [[equality (mathematics)|the equality relation]]), and there are relations which are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric (e.g., the &quot;preys on&quot; relation on biological [[species]]).

Antisymmetry is different from [[Asymmetric relation|asymmetry]].  According to one definition of '''asymmetric''', anything that fails to be symmetric is asymmetric.  Another definition of '''asymmetric''' makes asymmetry equivalent to antisymmetry plus [[reflexive relation|irreflexivity]].

==Examples==
The relation &quot;''x'' is even, ''y'' is odd&quot; between a pair (''x'', ''y'') of [[integer]]s is antisymmetric:

'''Aleister Crowley''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|r|oʊ|l|i}}; 12 October 1875 – 1 December 1947), born '''Edward Alexander Crowley''', and also known as both '''Frater Perdurabo''' and '''The Great Beast''', was an influential [[England|English]] [[occult]]ist, [[astrology|astrologer]], [[mysticism|mystic]] and [[ceremonial magic]]ian, responsible for founding the religious philosophy of [[Thelema]]. He was also successful in various other fields, including [[mountaineering]], [[chess]] and [[poetry]], and it has also been alleged that he was a spy for the British government. In his role as the founder of the Thelemite faith, he came to see himself as the prophet who was entrusted with informing humanity that it was entering the new [[Aeon of Horus]] in the early twentieth century.

Born into a wealthy upper class family, as a young man he became an influential member of the esoteric [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] after befriending the order's leader, [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]]. Subsequently believing that he was being contacted by his Holy Guardian Angel, an entity known as [[Aiwass]], whilst staying in Egypt in 1904, he received a text known as ''[[The Book of the Law]]'' from what he believed was a divine source, and around which he would come to develop his new religion of Thelema. He would go on to found his own occult society, the [[A∴A∴]] and eventually rose to become a leader of [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O.), before founding a religious commune in [[Cefalu]] known as the [[Abbey of Thelema]], which he led from 1920 through till 1923. After being evicted from Cefalu he returned to Britain, where he continued to promote Thelema until his death.

Crowley was also a [[bisexual]], a [[recreational drug use|recreational drug experimenter]] and [[social criticism|social critic]]. In many of these roles he &quot;was in revolt against the moral and religious values of his time&quot;, espousing a form of [[libertinism]] based upon the rule of &quot;Do What Thou Wilt&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Symonds|1997|p=vii.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, he gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime, and was denounced in the popular press of the day as &quot;the wickedest man in the world.&quot;

Crowley has remained an influential figure and is widely thought of as the most influential occultist of all time. In 2002, a [[BBC]] poll described him as being the seventy-third [[100 Greatest Britons|greatest Briton of all time]]. References to him can be found in the works of numerous writers, musicians and filmmakers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaczynski|2010|p=Acknowledgments.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he has also been cited as a key influence on many later esoteric groups and individuals, including [[Jimmy Page]], [[Kenneth Grant]], [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]], [[Gerald Gardner]] and, to some degree, [[Austin Osman Spare]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
===Early years: 1875–1894===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Aleister Crowley 13.jpg|thumb|right|Aleister Crowley, aged 13.]] --&gt;

Aleister was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in [[Royal Leamington Spa]], [[Warwickshire]], England, between 11 pm and midnight on 12 October 1875.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Edward Crowley (''c''.1830 — 1887), was trained as an engineer but, according to Aleister, never worked as one, instead owning shares in a lucrative family brewing business, Crowley's Ales, which allowed him to retire before Aleister was born.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 04-08.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Emily Bertha Bishop (1848–1917), drew roots from a Devonshire-Somerset family and was despised by her son, whom she described as &quot;the Beast&quot;, a name that he revelled in.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. pp. 18-21.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, who had been born a [[Quaker]], had converted to the [[Exclusive Brethren]], a more conservative faction of a Christian denomination known as the [[Plymouth Brethren]], as had his mother when she married him. His father was particularly devout, spending his time as a travelling preacher for the sect and reading a chapter from the [[Bible]] to his wife and son after breakfast every day.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. pp. 17-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 11-12, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 1887, when Crowley was eleven, his father died of [[tongue cancer]]. Aleister would later describe this as a turning point in his life,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and he always maintained some admiration for his father, describing him as &quot;his hero and his friend&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, quoted in [[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Inheriting his father's wealth, he was subsequently sent to Ebor School in Cambridge, a [[independent school (UK)|private]] Plymouth Brethren school, but was expelled for misbehaviour.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. pp. 27-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this he attended [[Malvern College]] and then [[Tonbridge School]], both of which he despised and soon left after only a few terms, instead beginning studies at [[Eastbourne College]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. pp. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He became increasingly sceptical about Christianity, pointing out logical [[Inconsistencies in the Bible|inconsistencies]] in the Bible to his religious teachers&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. pp. 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and went against the Christian morality of his upbringing, for instance embracing sex both with girls whom he met and by visiting female prostitutes, including one from whom he contracted [[gonorrhea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 24, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===University: 1895–1897===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=right|quote=&quot;For many years I had loathed being called Alick, partly because of the unpleasant sound and sight of the word, partly because it was the name by which my mother called me. Edward did not seem to suit me and the diminutives Ted or Ned were even less appropriate. Alexander was too long and Sandy suggested tow hair and freckles. I had read in some book or other that the most favourable name for becoming famous was one consisting of a [[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]] followed by a [[spondee]], as at the end of a [[hexameter]]: like ''Jeremy Taylor''. Aleister Crowley fulfilled these conditions and Aleister is the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] form of Alexander. To adopt it would satisfy my romantic ideals. The atrocious spelling A-L-E-I-S-T-E-R was suggested as the correct form by Cousin Gregor, who ought to have known better. In any case, A-L-A-I-S-D-A-I-R makes a very bad dactyl. For these reasons I saddled myself with my present [[nom-de-guerre]]&amp;mdash;I can't say that I feel sure that I facilitated the process of becoming famous. I should doubtless have done so, whatever name I had chosen.&quot;|source=Aleister Crowley, on his name change.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cro89|Crowley 1989]]. p. .&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1895 Crowley, who soon adopted the new name of Aleister over his birth name of Edward, began a three year course at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was entered for the [[Moral Science]] [[Tripos]] studying philosophy, but with approval from his personal tutor he switched to English literature, which was not then a part of the curriculum offered.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cro89|Crowley 1989]]. p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boo00|Booth 2000]]. p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley largely spent his time at university engaged in his pastimes, one of which was mountaineering; he went on holiday to the Alps to do so every year from 1894 to 1898, and various other mountaineers who knew him at this time recognized him as &quot;a promising climber, although somewhat erratic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Symonds|1997|p=13.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of his hobbies was writing poetry, which he had been doing since the age of ten, and in 1898 he privately published one hundred copies of one of his poems, ''Aceldama'', but it was not a particular success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Symonds|1997|pp=14–15.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, that same year he published a string of other poems, the most notable of which was ''White Stains'', a piece of erotica that had to be printed abroad as a safety measure in case it caused trouble with the British authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Symonds|1997|p=15.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this work, according to biographer Lawrence Sutin, &quot;deserves a place in any wide-ranging anthology of gay poetry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sutin|2000|p=46.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third hobby of his was the game of [[chess]], and he joined the university's chess club, where, he later stated, he beat the president in his first year and practiced two hours a day towards becoming a champion, but he eventually gave this idea up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowley|1929|p=140.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. pp. 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

At university, he also maintained a vigorous sex life, which was largely conducted with prostitutes and girls he picked up at local pubs and cigar shops, but eventually he took part in [[homosexuality|same-sex]] activities in which he played a passive role during anal sex.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boo00|Booth 2000]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This was despite the fact that homosexual acts were illegal and punishable with imprisonment at that time. In 1897, Crowley met a man named Herbert Charles Pollitt, the president of the [[Cambridge University Footlights Dramatic Club]], and the two subsequently entered into a relationship but broke up because Pollitt did not share Crowley's increasing interest in the esoteric.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. pp. 41-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley himself later stated that &quot;I told him frankly that I had given my life to religion and that he did not fit into the scheme. I see now how imbecile I was, how hideously wrong and weak it is to reject any part of one's personality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, quoted in [[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in December 1896 that he had his first significant [[religious experience|mystical experience]], of which he would later claim that &quot;this philosophy was born in me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Symonds|1997|p=14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His later biographer, Lawrence Sutin, believed that this was the result of Crowley's first homosexual experience, which brought him &quot;an encounter with an [[immanence|immanent deity]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sutin|2000|p=38.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this experience, Crowley began to read up on the subject of [[occultism]] and [[mysticism]], and by the next year he had begun reading books by [[alchemy|alchemists]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magicians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot;&gt;The Magical Diaries of Aleister Crowley (Tunisia 1923): Edited by Stephen Skinner; page 10&lt;/ref&gt; In October a brief illness triggered considerations of mortality and &quot;the futility of all human endeavour,&quot; or at least the futility of the diplomatic career that Crowley had previously considered,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sutin|2000|pp=37–39.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead, he decided to devote his life to the occult. In 1897 he left Cambridge, not having taken any degree at all despite a [[British undergraduate degree classification|&quot;first class&quot;]] showing in his spring 1897 exams and consistent &quot;second class honours&quot; results before that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sutin|2000|pp=35–36.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Golden Dawn: 1898–1899===
{{Main|Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:YoungAC.jpg|thumb|left|Aleister Crowley as a young man.]] --&gt;

In 1898, Crowley was staying in [[Zermatt]], Switzerland, where he met the chemist Julian L. Baker, and the two began talking about their common interest in alchemy. Upon their return to England, Baker introduced Crowley to [[George Cecil Jones]], a member of the occult society known as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]. Crowley was subsequently initiated into the Outer Order of the Golden Dawn on 18 November 1898 by the group's leader, [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]]. The ceremony itself took place at Mark Masons Hall in London, where Crowley accepted his motto and magical name of '''Frater Perdurabo''', meaning &quot;I shall endure to the end.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. p. 52-55.&lt;/ref&gt; At around this time, he moved from the elegant accommodation at the Hotel Cecil to his own luxury flat at 67–69 Chancery Lane. There, Crowley would prepare two different rooms: one for the practice of [[White Magic]] and the other one for [[Black Magic]]. He soon invited a Golden Dawn associate, [[Allan Bennett]], to live with him, and Bennett became his personal tutor, teaching him more about ceremonial magic and the ritual usage of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. pp. 64-66.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1900, Bennett left for Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka) to study [[Buddhism]],&lt;ref name=IAO131&gt;IAO131 [http://www.geocities.com/hdbq111/JoTS/JoTS1-1.pdf Thelema &amp; Buddhism] in ''Journal of Thelemic Studies'', Vol. 1, No. 1, Autumn 2007, pp. 18–32. [http://www.webcitation.org/5kmWKeCKS Archived] 2009-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst in 1899 Crowley acquired [[Boleskine House]] in [[Foyers]] on the shore of [[Loch Ness]] in Scotland. He subsequently developed a love of Scottish culture, describing himself as the &quot;Laird of Boleskine&quot; and took to wearing traditional highland dress, even during visits back to London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sym97|Symonds 1997]]. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a schism had developed in the Golden Dawn, with MacGregor Mathers, the organisation's leader, being ousted by a group of members who were unhappy with his autocratic rule. Crowley had previously approached this group of rebels, asking to be initiated into the further orders of the Golden Dawn, but they had declined him. Unfazed, he went directly to Mathers, who still held the post of chief and who agreed to initiate him into the Second Order.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. pp. 73-75.&lt;/ref&gt; Now loyal to Mathers, Crowley (with the help of his then mistress and fellow initiate Elaine Simpson) attempted to help crush the rebellion and unsuccessfully tried to seize a London temple space known as the Vault of [[Christian Rosenkreutz|Rosenkreutz]] from the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. pp. 76-79.&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley had also developed personal feuds with some of the Golden Dawn's members; he disliked the poet [[W.B. Yeats]], who had been one of the rebels, because Yeats had not been particularly favourable towards one of his own poems, ''Jephthat''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sym97|Symonds 1997]]. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; He also disliked [[Arthur Edward Waite]], who would rouse the anger of his fellows at the Golden Dawn with his [[pedantry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Owen |first=Alex |title=The Place of Enchantment: British Occultism and the Culture of the Modern |page=62 |year=2004 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0226642017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley voiced the view that Waite was a pretentious bore through searing critiques of Waite's writings and editorials of other authors' writings. In his periodical ''[[The Equinox]]'', Crowley titled one diatribe, &quot;Wisdom While You Waite&quot;, and his mock-obituary on the passing of Waite bore the title &quot;Dead Waite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sword of Wisdom: MacGregor Mathers and the Golden Dawn |last=Colquhoun |first=Ithell |authorlink=Ithell Colquhoun |year=1975 |publisher=G.P.Putham's Sons |location=New York |isbn=0854350926 |pages=231–233 |url=http://www.kheper.net/topics/Hermeticism/Waite.html |accessdate=2010-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico, India and Paris: 1900–1903===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AleisterCrowley's mountain party.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The first Europeans ever to attempt to climb [[K2]]. Crowley, here bearded, is the third from the left on the upper row.]] --&gt;

In 1900, Crowley travelled to Mexico via the United States on a whim, taking a local woman as his mistress, and with his good friend [[Oscar Eckenstein]] proceeded to climb several mountains, including [[Iztaccihuatl]], [[Popocatepetl]] and even [[Colima (volcano)|Colima]], the latter of which they had to abandon owing to a volcanic eruption.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 83-89.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Eckenstein revealed mystical leanings of his own and told Crowley that he needed to improve the control of his mind, recommending the Indian practice of [[raja yoga]] in order to do so. Crowley had continued his magical experimentation on his own after leaving Mathers and the Golden Dawn, and his writings suggest that he developed the magical word ''[[Abrahadabra]]'' during this time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. pp. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving Mexico, a country that he would always remain fond of, Crowley visited San Francisco, Hawaii, Japan, Hong Kong and Ceylon, where he met up with Allan Bennett and devoted himself further to yoga, from which he claimed to have achieved the spiritual state of ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]]''. It was during this visit that Bennett decided to become a Buddhist monk in the [[Theravada]] tradition, travelling to Burma, whilst Crowley went on to India, studying various [[Hinduism|Hindu]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 93-98.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, he was joined in India by Eckenstein and several other mountaineers; Guy Knowles, H. Pfannl, V.&amp;nbsp;Wesseley, and Dr Jules Jacot-Guillarmod. Together the Eckenstein-Crowley expedition attempted to climb the mountain [[K2]], which at that time no other Europeans had attempted.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} On the journey, Crowley was afflicted with [[influenza]], [[malaria]], and [[snow blindness]], whilst other expedition members were similarly struck with illness. They reached an altitude of {{convert|20000|ft|m}} before deciding to turn back.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 98-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 Crowley wed [[Rose Edith Kelly]], the sister of his friend [[Gerald Festus Kelly]], in a &quot;marriage of convenience&quot;. However, soon after their marriage, Crowley actually fell in love with her and set about to successfully prove his affections.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 119-123.&lt;/ref&gt; A painter, Gerald Kelly was a good friend of [[W. Somerset Maugham]], who after briefly meeting Crowley would later use him as a model for the protagonist of his novel ''[[The Magician (Maugham novel)|The Magician]]'', published 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;Routledge&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Curtis |first1=Anthony |last2=Whitehead |first2=John |title=W.

===Egypt and ''The Book of the Law'': 1904===
{{Main|The Book of the Law}}
In 1904, Crowley and his new wife Rose traveled to [[Egypt]] using the pseudonym of Prince and Princess Chioa Khan, titles which Crowley claimed had been bestowed upon him by an eastern [[potentate]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Crowley's own account, Rose, who was pregnant, had become somewhat delusional whilst in the country, regularly informing him that &quot;they are waiting for you&quot;, but not providing him with any further information as to who &quot;they&quot; were. It was on 18 March, after Crowley sought the aid of the Egyptian god [[Thoth]] in a magical rite, that she actually revealed who &quot;they&quot; were – the ancient Egyptian god [[Horus]] and his alleged messenger. She then led him to a nearby museum in [[Cairo]] where she showed him a seventh century BCE mortuary [[stele]] known as the [[Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu]] (it later came to be revered in Thelema as the &quot;Stele of Revealing&quot;); Crowley was astounded for the exhibit's number was 666, the [[number of the beast]] in Christian mythology.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 124-126.&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley took this all to be a sign from a divine entity and on 20 March began performing ritual invocations of the god Horus in his rented room. It was after this invocation that Rose, or as he now referred to her, Ouarda the Seeress, informed him that &quot;the Equinox of the Gods had come&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sym97|Symonds 1997]]. pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;

It was on 8 April, when the couple were still staying in Cairo, that Crowley first heard a disembodied voice talking to him, claiming that it was coming from a being known as [[Aiwass]], the true nature of whom Crowley never understood. Crowley's disciple and later secretary [[Israel Regardie]] believed that this voice came from Crowley's [[subconscious]], but opinions among Thelemites differ widely.&lt;ref name=&quot;EIUC&quot;&gt;Wilson, R. A. with Miriam Joan Hill, ''Everything is Under Control: Conspiracies, cults and cover-ups'', HarperPerennial 1998. ISBN 0-06-273417-2. Kenneth Grant vs [[Israel Regardie]] p. 134. Grant's alien claim &quot;widely shared in occult circles,&quot; p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Aiwass claimed to be a messenger from the god Horus, who was also referred to by him as Hoor-Paar-Kraat. Crowley wrote down everything the voice told him over the course of the next three days, and subsequently titled it ''Liber AL vel Legis'' or ''[[The Book of the Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley (2004:7–9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 127-129.&lt;/ref&gt; The god's commands explained that a new [[Aeon (Thelema)|Aeon]] for mankind had begun, and that Crowley would serve as its [[Prophet, seer, and revelator|prophet]]. As a supreme moral law, it declared &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law&quot;, and that people should learn to live in tune with their &quot;[[True Will]]&quot;. Although this event would prove to be a cornerstone in Crowley's life, being the origin of the religion of [[Thelema]], at the time he was unsure what to think about the whole situation. He was &quot;dumbfounded about what to do with ''The Book of the Law''&quot; and eventually decided to ignore the instructions that it commanded him to perform, which included taking the Stele of Revealing from the museum, fortifying his own island and translating the Book into all the world's languages. Instead he simply sent typescripts of the work to several occultists whom he knew, and then &quot;put aside the book with relief.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kangchenjunga and China: 1905-1906 ===
Returning to [[Boleskine House|Boleskine]], Crowley came to believe that his friend [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]], had become so jealous of his progression as a ceremonial magician that he had begun using magic against him, and the relationship between the two broke down.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 July 1905, Rose gave birth to Crowley's first child, a daughter, whom he named Nuit Ma Ahathoor Hecate Sappho Jezebel Lilith, although she would commonly be referred to simply by her last name.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; He also founded a publishing company, naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in parody of the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]], and through this released more of his own poetry, including ''The Sword of Song''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 131-133.&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst his poetry often received strong reviews (either positive or negative), it never sold well, and attempting to gain more publicity, he issued a reward of £100 for whomever could write the best essay on the topic of his work. The winner of this would prove to be [[J.F.C. Fuller]] (1878–1966), a British Army officer and military historian, whose essay, ''The Star in the West'', heralded Crowley's poetry as some of the greatest ever written.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 136-137, 139, 168-169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowley decided to climb another of the world's greatest mountains, and for this chose [[Kangchenjunga]] in the [[Himalayas]], widely thought of as &quot;the most treacherous mountain in the world&quot; by climbers at the time. Assembling a team consisting of Dr Jacot-Guillarmod, a veteran of the K2 climb, as well as several other continental Europeans including Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, the group travelled to British India to undertake the task. Throughout the expedition, there was much argument between Crowley and the others who felt that he was reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley's control, with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley's warnings that it was too dangerous. Crowley was proved right as Pache and several porters were subsequently killed in an accident.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 138-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning from this expedition, he met up with Rose and Lilith in [[Kolkata]] before being forced to leave India after shooting dead a native who had tried to mug him.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 151-152.&lt;/ref&gt; Travelling to China, Crowley soon fell down a forty foot cliff; finding himself unscathed, he believed that he was being protected for some prophetic purpose, and underwent a religious experience that he felt bestowed on him the rank of Exempt Adept, the highest grade of the Second Order of the Golden Dawn. Devoting himself fully to spiritual and magical work, he began studying the ''[[Goetia]]'', and recited the [[grimoire]]'s preliminary invocation daily in order to try to get in contact with his [[Holy Guardian Angel]]. The Crowleys spent the next few months travelling around China, but it was decided that in March 1906, they would return to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 153-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose took Lilith with her and set off for Europe via India, whilst Crowley himself decided to travel back via the United States, where he hoped he would be able to get support for a second expedition to Kangchenjunga. Before departing, Crowley visited his friend [[Elaine Simpson]] in Shanghai, a fellow occultist who had been his colleague in the Golden Dawn. She was fascinated by ''The Book of the Law'' and the prophetic message that it contained, something he had been ignoring, and together they performed a ritual to invoke Aiwass once more. The ritual proved successful, and Aiwass provided Crowley with the message that he should &quot;Return to Egypt, with same surroundings. There I will give thee signs.&quot; Nonetheless, Crowley ignored the advice of Aiwass, instead heading off to America. Stopping off at the Japanese port of [[Kobe]] along the way, Crowley had a vision which he interpreted as meaning that the great spiritual beings known as the [[Secret Chiefs]] had admitted him into the Third Order of the Golden Dawn. Subsequently arriving in America, he found no support for his proposed mountaineering expedition, and so set sail to return to Britain, arriving there in June 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 155-156.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The A∴A∴ and the Holy Books of Thelema: 1907–1909===
Upon arrival at Britain, Crowley learned that his daughter Lilith had died of [[typhoid]] in [[Rangoon]] and that his wife had begun suffering from alcoholism. Heartbroken, his health began to suffer, and he underwent a series of surgical operations. He began having a short-lived sexual affair with Vera &quot;Lola&quot; Stepp, an actress that he would devote some of his poetry to, whilst Rose gave birth to his second daughter, Lola Zaza,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 159-160.&lt;/ref&gt; for whom Crowley devised a special ritual of thanksgiving.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. pp. 171-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote=&quot;By the burning of the incense was the Word revealed, and by the distant drug.&lt;br&gt;O meal and honey and oil!

Believing that he was now amongst the highest level of spiritual adepts, Crowley began to think about founding his own magical society. In this he was supported by his friend and fellow occultist [[George Cecil Jones]]. The pair began to practice rituals together at Jones' home in [[Coulsdon]], and for the [[autumn equinox]] on 22 September 1907 developed a new ceremony based upon the Golden Dawn initiatory rite, for which Crowley composed a verse liturgy entitled &quot;Liber 671&quot;, and later dubbed &quot;Liber Pyramidos&quot;. The pair repeated this ritual again on 9 October, when they had made some alterations to it. In Crowley's eyes, this ritual would prove to be one of the &quot;greatest events of his career&quot; during which he &quot;attained the knowledge and conversation of his holy guardian angel&quot; and &quot;entered the trance of ''[[samadhi]]'', union with [[godhead]].&quot; He therefore finally succeeded with the aim of his [[Abramelin the Mage|Abramelin]] operation - as set out in the grimoire known as ''[[The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage]]'' - which he had been working on for months.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 157-160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. pp. 173-174.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his spiritual attainment Crowley came to believe that he could finally enter into conversation with his Holy Guardian Angel, the entity known as [[Aiwass]], and as a result of this, on 30 October 1907 penned &quot;Liber VII&quot;, a text that he believed to have been dictated to him by Aiwass through [[automatic writing]]. Following ''The Book of the Law'', which had been received in 1904, &quot;Liber VII&quot; would prove to be the second book in a series of [[Holy Books of Thelema]]. Over the next few days, he also received a further Holy Book, &quot;Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, Crowley, Jones and [[J.F.C. Fuller]] decided to found a new magical order as a successor to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which would be known as the [[A∴A∴]], the Argenteum Astrum or the Silver Star.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 172-173.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the order's foundation, Crowley continued to write down more received Thelemic Holy Books during the last two months of the year, including &quot;Liber LXVI&quot;, &quot;Liber Arcanorum&quot;, &quot;Liber Porta Lucis, Sub Figura X&quot;, &quot;Liber Tau&quot;, &quot;Liber Trigrammaton&quot; and &quot;Liber DCCCXIII vel Ararita&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 173-175.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, effectively separated from his wife Rose by this point, Crowley entered into a romantic and sexual affair with [[Ada Leverson]] (1862–1933), an author and friend of [[Oscar Wilde]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 173-174.&lt;/ref&gt; This affair was brief, and in February 1908, Crowley was reunited with his wife as she had overcome her alcoholism, and together the couple travelled to [[Eastbourne]] for a holiday. Rose however relapsed and Crowley, who disliked her when drunk, fled to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, when doctors stated that Rose required institutionalisation for her alcoholism, Crowley finally decided that it was time to get a divorce, but because he didn't want the proceedings to reflect badly upon her, he agreed that she could divorce him for infidelity, thereby meaning that any bad appearances would instead be reflected upon him, and he remained her friend following the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 182-183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trying to gain more members for his A∴A∴, Crowley decided to begin publishing a biannual journal, ''[[The Equinox]]'', which was billed as &quot;The Review of Scientific Illuminism&quot;. Starting with a first issue in 1909, ''The Equinox'' containing pieces by Crowley, Fuller and a young poet Crowley had met in 1907 named [[Victor Benjamin Neuburg|Victor Neuburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon other occultists had joined the order, including solicitor Richard Noel Warren, artist [[Austin Osman Spare]], Horace Sheridan-Bickers, author George Raffalovich, Francis Henry Everard Joseph Fielding, engineer Herbert Edward Inman, Kenneth Ward and [[Charles Stansfeld Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. pp. 185-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Victor Neuburg and Algeria: 1910-1911 ===
In 1907, Crowley had been introduced to a Jewish Londoner named [[Victor Benjamin Neuburg|Victor Neuburg]], a poet who was interested in the esoteric.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kac10|Kaczynski 2010]]. p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris during October 1908, he again produced Samadhi by the use of ritual and this time did so without hashish. He published an account of this success in order to show that his method worked and that one could achieve great mystical results without living as a hermit. On 30 December 1908, Aleister Crowley using the pseudonym Oliver Haddo made accusations of plagiarism against [[Somerset Maugham]], author of the novel ''[[The Magician (Maugham novel)|The Magician]]''. Crowley's article appeared in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]]'', edited then by [[Frank Harris]] who admired Crowley and who would later write the famous work ''[[My Life and Loves]]''. Admittedly, Maugham did model the character of his magician Oliver Haddo after Crowley himself and Crowley confessed Maugham acquiesced privately on the question of plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sutin |title=Do what thou wilt |page=190 |quote=But Crowley could not leave ''The Magician'' unavenged |isbn=0312288972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, Aleister and Rose divorced, largely due to her [[alcoholism]]. She was subsequently admitted to an [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylum]] suffering from alcoholic dementia. Meanwhile, Crowley soon moved on and took a woman named [[Leila Waddell]] as his lover or &quot;[[Babalon|Scarlet Woman]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Symonds|1997|pp=132–133.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, Crowley performed his series of dramatic rites, the [[Rites of Eleusis]], with [[A∴A∴]] members [[Leila Waddell|Leila Waddell (Laylah)]] and [[Victor Benjamin Neuburg]].

=== Ordo Templi Orientis: 1912–1913===
{{Main|Ordo Templi Orientis}}
According to Crowley, [[Theodor Reuss]] called on him in 1912 to accuse him of publishing [[Ordo Templi Orientis|O.T.O.]] secrets, which Crowley dismissed on the grounds of having never attained the grade in which these secrets were given (IXth Degree). Reuss opened up Crowley's latest book, ''[[The Book of Lies (Crowley)|The Book of Lies]]'', and showed Crowley the passage. This sparked a long conversation which led to Crowley assuming the Xth Degree of O.T.O. and becoming Grand Master of the English-speaking section of O.T.O. called ''Mysteria Mystica Maxima''.&lt;ref&gt;King, Magical World, pages 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowley would eventually introduce the practice of male homosexual [[sex magick]] into O.T.O. as one of the highest degrees of the Order for he believed it to be the most powerful formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newcomb |first=Jason |title=Sexual Sorcery: a complete guide to Sex Magick |page=42 |year=2005 |publisher=Weiser |isbn=1578633302 |quote=...more powerful than heterosexual or lesbian acts }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley placed the new degree above the Tenth Degree – not to be confused with any title [[A∴A∴#Initiatory structure|in his own Order]] – and numbered it the Eleventh Degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lachman |first=Gary |title=Turn off your mind: the mystic sixties and the dark side of the Age of Aquarius |page=227 |publisher=The Disinformation Co. |isbn=0971394230}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a protest from some members of O.T.O. in Germany and the rest of continental Europe that occasioned a persistent rift with Crowley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sutin |title=Do what thou wilt |page=228 |quote=Crowley also added a new degree of his own devising – an XI° magical working utilizing anal sex which was, in practice, primarily homosexual. |isbn=0312288972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1913, producer Crowley introduced Leila Waddell in ''The Ragged Ragtime Girls'' [[follies]] [[review]] at the Old Tivoli in London where it enjoyed a brief run. In July 1913, the production enjoyed a six-week run in Moscow where Crowley met a young Hungarian girl named Anny Ringler. Crowley went on to practice sado-masochistic sex with Ringler. According to Crowley, &quot;...&amp;nbsp;She had passed beyond the region where pleasure had meaning for her. She could only feel through pain, and my own means of making her happy was to inflict physical cruelties as she directed. The kind of relation was altogether new to me; and it was because of this, intensified as it was by the environment of the self-torturing soul of Russia, that I became inspired to create by the next six weeks.&quot; While in Moscow, Crowley would see Anny for an hour and then he would write poetry. During this summer in Moscow, Crowley would write two of his most memorable works, the ''Hymn to Pan'' and the [[Gnostic Mass]] or ''Ecclesiae Gnosticae Catholicae Canon Missae''. The ''Hymn to Pan'' would be read at his funeral thirty four years later. Certain Thelemites regularly perform the Gnostic Mass to this day. It symbolizes the act of sex as a magical or religious ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sutin |title=Do what thou wilt |pages=232–236 |quote=Once arrived in Moscow, Crowley was entranced by the beauty of the city... |isbn=0312288972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning to London in the autumn of 1913, Crowley published the tenth and final number of volume one of ''The Equinox''. In December 1913 in Paris, Crowley would engage [[Victor Benjamin Neuburg]] in ''The Paris Working''. The first ritual took place on New Year's Eve 1914. In a period of seven weeks, Crowley and Neuburg performed a total of twenty four rituals which they recorded in the 'holy' or partially holy book formally entitled ''Opus [[Lutetia]]num''.&lt;ref&gt;The material AC considered holy &quot;is inextricably imbedded in the Class '''B''' text, often without the benefit of quotation marks.&quot; ''The Holy Books of Thelema'' intro to 1984 ed, p xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Around eight months later Neuburg had a nervous breakdown. Afterward, Crowley and Neuburg would never see each other again.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States: 1914–1918===
[[File:Crowley unicursal hexagram.svg|thumb|Aleister Crowley’s rendition of the [[Unicursal Hexagram]].]]
During his time in the U.S., Crowley practiced the task of [[A∴A∴#Magister Templi|a Magister Templi in the A∴A∴]] as he conceived it, namely interpreting every phenomenon as a particular dealing of &quot;God&quot; with his soul.&lt;ref&gt;''Liber ABA'' Part II gives this task.&lt;/ref&gt; He began to see various women he met as officers in his ongoing initiation, associating them with priests wearing animal masks in Egyptian ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin p 251.&lt;/ref&gt; A meditation during his relationship with one of these woman, the poet [[Jeanne Robert Foster]], led him to claim the title of [[Magus]], also referring to the system of the A∴A∴.

In June 1915, Crowley met Jeanne Robert Foster in the company of her friend Hellen Hollis, a journalist; Crowley would have affairs with both women. Foster was a famous New York fashion model, journalist, editor, poet and married. Crowley's plan with Foster was to produce his first son; but in spite of a series of magical operations she did not get pregnant. By the end of 1915, the affair would be over.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin, Do What Thou Wilt, pp. 251–254&lt;/ref&gt; During a trip to Vancouver in 1915, Crowley met Wilfred Smith, Frater 132 of the Vancouver Lodge of O.T.O., and in 1930 granted him permission to establish Agape Lodge in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Knowlton |first1=Janice |last2=Newton |first2=Michael |title=Daddy was the Black Dahlia killer |page=129 |quote=... Smith got things rolling in Hollywood by luring celebrities to special invitation-only rituals at which &quot;[[sex magick]]&quot; was one of the major attractions. |year=1995 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0671880842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same trip in 1915, Crowley stopped over at [[Parke Davis]] in Detroit for some [[mescaline]].&lt;ref&gt;Sutin, Do What Thou Wilt, pp. 252–253&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1916, Crowley had an illicit liaison with Alice Richardson, the wife of [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]], one of the greatest art historians of the day. On the stage, Richardson was known as Ratan Devi, mezzo-soprano interpreter of East Indian music. Richardson became pregnant but on a voyage back to England, in mid-1916, she had a miscarriage. Just before his affair with Ratan Devi, Crowley was practicing sex magick with Gerda Maria von Kothek, a German prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sutin |first=Lawrence |title=Do What Thou Wilt: a life of Aleister Crowley |page=256 |year=2000 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0312252434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two periods of magical experimentation followed. In June 1916, he began the first of these at the [[New Hampshire]] cottage of [[Evangeline Adams]], having ghostwritten most of her two books on astrology.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin p257.&lt;/ref&gt; His diaries at first show discontent at the gap between his view of the grade of Magus and his view of himself: &quot;It is no good making up my mind to do anything material; for I have no means. But this would vanish if I could make up my mind.&quot; Despite his objections to sacrificing a living animal, he resolved to crucify a frog as part of a rehearsal of the life of Jesus in the Gospels (afterward declaring it his willing familiar), &quot;with the idea ... that some supreme violation of all the laws of my being would break down my Karma or dissolve the spell that seems to bind me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sutin pp260, 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Slightly more than a month later, having taken ether ([[ether|ethyl oxide]]), he had a vision of the universe from a modern scientific cosmology that he frequently referred to in later writings.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin p258.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowley began another period of magical work on an island in the [[Hudson River]] after buying large amounts of red paint instead of food. Having painted &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot; on the cliffs at both sides of the island, he received gifts from curious visitors. Here at the island he had visions of seeming past lives, though he refused to endorse any theory of what they meant beyond linking them to his unconscious. Towards the end of his stay, he had a shocking experience he linked to &quot;the Chinese wisdom&quot; which made even Thelema appear insignificant.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin pp271, 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he continued in his work. Before leaving the country he formed a sexual and magical relationship with [[Leah Hirsig]], whom he had met earlier, and with her help began painting canvases with more creativity and passion.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin p275&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard B. Spence writes in his 2008 book ''Secret Agent 666: Aleister Crowley, British Intelligence and the Occult'' that Crowley could have been a lifelong agent for [[British Intelligence]]. While this may have already been the case during his many travels to [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]], Switzerland, Asia, Mexico and [[North Africa]] that had started in his student days, he could have been involved with this line of work during his life in America during the [[First World War]], under a cover of being a German propaganda agent and a supporter of [[Irish independence]]. Crowley's mission might have been to gather information about the German intelligence network, the Irish independent activists and produce aberrant propaganda, aiming at compromising the German and Irish ideals. As an [[agent provocateur]] he could have played some role in provoking the sinking of the [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']], thereby bringing the United States closer to active involvement in the war alongside the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Spence | first=Richard B. | title=Secret Agent 666: Aleister Crowley, British Intelligence and the Occult | year=2008 | publisher=Feral House | location=Port Townsend | isbn=978-1-932595-33-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also used German magazines ''The Fatherland'' and ''The International'' as outlets for his other writings. The question of whether Crowley was a spy has always been subject to debate, but Spence uncovered a document from the [[US Army]]'s old [[Military Intelligence Division]] supporting Crowley's own claim to having been a spy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Aleister Crowley was an employee of the British Government ... in this country on official business of which the British Consul, New York City has full cognizance.&lt;ref&gt;Spence p.6, quoting US National Archives, Record Group 165, Military Intelligence Division file 10012-112, &quot;General Summary&quot;, Intelligence Officer, West Point, New York, 23 September 1918&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Abbey of Thelema: 1920–1923===
[[File:Thelema Abbey 2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Abbey of Thelema]]]]

{{Main|Abbey of Thelema}}
Soon after moving from West 9th St. in Greenwich Village New York City with their newborn daughter Anne Leah nicknamed Poupée (born February 1920 and died in a hospital in Palermo 14 October 1920), Crowley, along with [[Leah Hirsig]], founded the [[Abbey of Thelema]] in [[Cefalù]] ([[Palermo]]), [[Sicily]] on 14 April 1920, the day the lease for the villa Santa Barbara was signed by Sir Alastor de Kerval (Crowley) and Contessa Lea Harcourt (Leah Hirsig). The Crowleys arrived in Cefalu on 1 April 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin, ''Do What Thou Wilt'', pp.279–280&lt;/ref&gt; During their stay at the abbey Hirsig was known as Soror Alostrael, Crowley's Scarlet Woman, the name Crowley used for his female sex magick practitioners in reference to the consort of the Beast of the Apocalypse whose number is 666.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levenda |first=Peter |title=Unholy alliance: a history of Nazi involvement with the occult |page=132 |quote=Perhaps the most famous to Crowley's enthusiasts was the ghostly Leah Hirzig, the younger sister of the Swiss-German Alma Hirzig,... |year=2002 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=0826414090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the abbey was borrowed from [[Rabelais]]'s satire [[Gargantua]],&lt;ref&gt;Nature of the Beast by Colin Wilson; page 73&lt;/ref&gt; where the &quot;[[Abbey of Thélème]]&quot; is described as a sort of anti-monastery where the lives of the inhabitants were &quot;spent not in laws, statutes, or rules, but according to their own free will and pleasure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rabelais, F. ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'' Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This idealistic [[utopia]] was to be the model of Crowley's [[commune]], while also being a type of magical school, giving it the designation &quot;Collegium ad Spiritum Sanctum,&quot; The College of the Holy Spirit. The general programme was in line with the A∴A∴ course of training, and included daily adorations to the Sun, a study of Crowley's writings, regular yogic and ritual practices (which were to be recorded), as well as general domestic labour. The object, naturally, was for students to devote themselves to the [[Great Work]] of discovering and manifesting their [[True Will]]s. Two women, Hirsig and Shumway (her magical name was Sister Cypris after Aphrodite), were both carrying Crowley's seed. Hirsig had a two-year old son named Hansi and Shumway had a three-year old boy named Howard; they were not Crowley's but he nicknamed them Dionysus and Hermes respectively. After Poupée died, Hirsig had a miscarriage but Shumway gave birth to a daughter, Astarte Lulu Panthea. Hirsig suspected Shumway's Black Magic foul play and what Crowley found when reading Shumway's magical diary (everybody had to keep one while at the abbey for reasons explained in Liber E) appalled him. Shumway was banished from the abbey and the Beast lamented the death of his children. However, Shumway was soon back in the abbey again to take care of her offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sutin |first=Laurence |title=Do What Thou Wilt: a life of Aleister Crowley |page=285 |year=2000 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0312252434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s Fascist government expelled Crowley from the country at the end of April 1923.

===After the Abbey: 1923–1947===
In February 1924, Crowley visited [[Gurdjieff]]'s [[Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man]]. He did not meet the founder on that occasion, but called Gurdjieff a &quot;tip-top man&quot; in his diary.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Heard more sense and insight than I've done in years.&quot; Quoted in Sutin, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley privately criticized some of the Institute's practices and teachings, but doubted that what he heard from disciple Pindar reflected the master's true position. Some claim that on a later visit he met Gurdjieff—who firmly repudiated Crowley.&lt;ref&gt;James Webb, ''The Harmonious Circle'', p. 315. Quoted in [http://www.lumen.org/intros/intro20.html Introduction to Gnosis #20, online version]. Retrieved 20 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Sutin expresses skepticism,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;If this brutal banishment did occur, then it is remarkable that Crowley, who harbored animus toward so many rival teachers, never did so toward Gurdjieff.&quot; Sutin p.318.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gurdjieff's student C.S. Nott tells a different version. Nott perceives Crowley as a black or at least ignorant magician and says his teacher &quot;kept a sharp watch&quot; on the visitor, but mentions no open confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;Teachings of Gurdjieff: A Pupil's Journal&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pessoachess.jpg|left|thumb|350px|Aleister Crowley and [[Fernando Pessoa]] in Lisbon, September 1930.]]

On 16 August 1929, Crowley married Maria de Miramar, a [[Nicaraguan]], while in [[Leipzig]]. They separated by 1930, but they were never divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelemapedia.org/index.php/Maria_de_Miramar |title=The Encyclopedia of Thelema &amp; Magick &amp;#124; Maria de Miramar |publisher=Thelemapedia |date= |accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1931, de Miramar was admitted to the Colney Hatch Mental Hospital in [[New Southgate]] where she remained until her death thirty years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sutin |first=Lawrence |title=Do what thou wilt: a life of Aleister Crowley |page=359 |year=2000 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0312252434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1930 Crowley was in [[Lisbon]] to meet the poet [[Fernando Pessoa]], who translated into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] his poem &quot;Hymn To Pan&quot;. With the assistance of [[Fernando Pessoa|Pessoa]], he faked his own death at a notorious rock formation on the shore called [[Boca do Inferno]] (Mouth of Hell). In fact Crowley left the country and enjoyed the newspaper reports of his death – reappearing three weeks later at an exhibition in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Influence of Aleister Crowley on Fernando Pessoa's Esoteric Writings&quot; in Gnostics 3: Ésotérisme, Gnoses &amp; Imaginaire Symbolique (Leuven, Belgium: Peeters, 2001) pp.693–711.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Crowley was declared [[bankrupt]] after losing a court case in which he sued the artist [[Nina Hamnett]] for calling him a black magician in her 1932 book, ''Laughing Torso''. In addressing the jury, Mr. Justice Swift said:
{{quote|I have been over forty years engaged in the administration of the law in one capacity or another. I thought that I knew of every conceivable form of wickedness. I thought that everything which was vicious and bad had been produced at one time or another before me. I have learnt in this case that we can always learn something more if we live long enough. I have never heard such dreadful, horrible, blasphemous and abominable stuff as that which has been produced by the man (Crowley) who describes himself to you as the greatest living poet.|Mr. Justice Swift}}

However, Patricia &quot;Deirdre&quot; MacAlpine approached Crowley on the day of the verdict and offered to bear him a child, whom he named Aleister Atatürk. She sought no mystical or religious role in Crowley's life and rarely saw him after the birth, &quot;an arrangement that suited them both.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sutin, pp 373–374.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1939, [[Dion Fortune]] and Aleister Crowley met publicly for the first time. Fortune had already used Crowley as a model for the black magician Hugo Astley in her 1935 novel ''The Winged Bull''.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin, ''Do what thou wilt'', p. 407&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], [[Ian Fleming]] and others proposed a disinformation plot in which Crowley would have helped an [[MI5]] agent supply [[Nazism|Nazi]] official [[Rudolf Hess]] with faked horoscopes. They could then pass along false information about an alleged pro-German circle in Britain. The government abandoned this plan when Hess flew to Scotland, crashing his plane on the moors near [[Eaglesham]], and was captured. Fleming then suggested using Crowley as an interrogator to determine the influence of astrology on other Nazi leaders, but his superiors rejected this plan. At some point, Fleming also suggested that Britain could use [[Enochian]] as a code in order to plant evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin, pp. 388–389&lt;/ref&gt;
It is claimed that Ian Fleming was also Crowley's controller when it came to information and dis-information sent to Germany during the war, in that Crowley was a German agent who was turned into a double agent for Britain, controlled by Ian Fleming (the future creator of [[James Bond]]).

On 21 March 1944, Crowley undertook what he considered his crowning achievement, the publication of ''[[The Book of Thoth (Crowley)|The Book of Thoth]]'', limited to 200 numbered and signed copies bound in Morocco leather and printed on pre-wartime paper. Crowley sold ₤1,500 worth of the edition in less than three months.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin '''Do what thou wilt'', pp, 400–401&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1944, Crowley moved from 93 Jermyn St. to Bell Inn at Aston Clinton, Bucks. Daphne Harris was the landlady.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin ''Do what thou wilt'', p. 402&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[Image:Crowley gentleman.jpg|thumb|right|An older Aleister Crowley]]

In January 1945, Crowley moved to Netherwood, a [[Hastings]] boarding house where in the first three months he was visited twice by Dion Fortune; she died of [[leukemia]] in January 1946. On 14 March 1945, in a letter Fortune wrote to Crowley, she declares: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;The acknowledgement I made in the introduction of ''The Mystical Qabalah'' of my indebtness to your work, which seemed to me to be no more than common literary honesty, has been used as a rod for my back by people who look on you as Antichrist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sutin ''Do what thou wilt'', pp. 407–408&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowley died at Netherwood on 1 December 1947 at the age of 72. According to one biographer the cause of death was a [[respiratory infection]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Send&quot;&gt;Sutin, pp. 417–419&lt;/ref&gt; He had become addicted to heroin after being prescribed morphine for his [[asthma]] and [[bronchitis]] many years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin pp 411, 416, initial prescription p 277.&lt;/ref&gt; He and his last doctor died within 24 hours of each other; newspapers would claim, in differing accounts, that Dr. Thomson had refused to continue his [[opiate]] prescription and that Crowley had put a curse on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=4 December 1947 | title=Daily Express}} and {{cite news | date=31 May 1969 | title=The Winnipeg Free Press}}. See also Sutin p 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer Lawrence Sutin passes on various stories about Crowley's death and last words. [[Frieda Harris]] supposedly reported him saying, &quot;I am perplexed,&quot; though she did not see him at the very end. According to [[John Symonds]], a Mr. Rowe witnessed Crowley's death along with a nurse, and reported his last words as &quot;Sometimes I hate myself.&quot; Biographer [[Gerald Suster]] accepted the version of events he received from a &quot;Mr W.H.&quot; who worked at the house, in which Crowley dies pacing in his living room.&lt;ref name=&quot;Send&quot;/&gt; Supposedly Mr W.H. heard a crash while polishing furniture on the floor below, and entered Crowley's rooms to find him dead on the floor.

Patricia &quot;Deirdre&quot; MacAlpine, who visited Crowley with their son and her three other children, denied all this and reports a sudden gust of wind and peal of thunder at the (otherwise quiet) moment of his death. According to MacAlpine, Crowley remained bedridden for the last few days of his life, but was in light spirits and conversational. Readings at the cremation service in nearby [[Brighton]] included one of his own works, ''Hymn to Pan'', and newspapers referred to the service as a [[black mass]]. The Brighton council subsequently resolved to take all the necessary steps to prevent such an incident from occurring again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Send&quot;/&gt;

==Beliefs and viewpoints==
===Thelema===
{{Thelema}}
{{Main|Thelema|Thelemic mysticism}}
Thelema is the mystical [[cosmology]] Crowley announced in 1904 and expanded upon for the remainder of his life. The diversity of his writings illustrate his difficulty in classifying Thelema from any one vantage. It can be considered a form of magical [[philosophy]], religious [[tradition]]alism, [[humanistic]] [[positivism]], and/or an elitist [[meritocracy]].

The chief [[precept]] of Thelema, derived from the works of [[François Rabelais]], is the sovereignty of Will: &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.&quot; Crowley's idea of ''will'', however, is not simply the individual's desires or wishes, but also incorporates a sense of the person's destiny or greater purpose: what he termed &quot;[[True Will]]&quot;.

The second precept of Thelema is &quot;Love is the law, love under will&quot;—and Crowley's meaning of &quot;Love&quot; is as complex as that of &quot;Will.&quot; It is frequently sexual: Crowley's system, like elements of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]] before him, sees the dichotomy and tension between the male and female as fundamental to existence, and sexual &quot;magick&quot; and metaphor form a significant part of Thelemic ritual. However, Love is also discussed as the Union of Opposites, which Crowley thought was the key to [[Gnosis|enlightenment]].

===Freemasonry===
He had also claimed to be a [[Freemason]],&lt;ref&gt;Sutin:Do What Thou Wilt (p. 83)&lt;/ref&gt; but the organizations he joined are not considered [[Regular Masonic jurisdictions|regular]] by Masonic bodies in the Anglo-American tradition.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Starr M P 2004, &quot;Aleister Crowley: freemason!&quot;, Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon, http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/aqc/crowley.html , BC&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowley claimed the following Masonic degrees:

*33° of the Scottish Rite in Mexico from Don Jesus Medina.
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Don Jesus Medina, a descendant of the great duke of Armada fame, and one of the highest chiefs of Scottish Rite free-masonry. My cabbalistic knowledge being already profound by current standards, he thought me worthy of the highest initiation in his power to confer; special powers were obtained in view of my limited sojourn, and I was pushed rapidly through and admitted to the thirty-third and last degree before I left the country.” ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley]]'' pp.&amp;nbsp;202–203.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*3° In France by the Anglo-Saxon Lodge No. 343, a Lodge chartered in 1899 by the Grande Loge de France, a body not at the time recognized by the United Grand Lodge of England, on 29 June 1904.

*33° of the irregular 'Cerneau' Scottish Rite from John Yarker

*90°/95° of the Rite of Memphis/Misraim from John Yarker.

The [[United Grand Lodge of England]], whose recognition is generally considered the standard for Masonic validity, did not recognize any of the above bodies as being true Freemasonry, thus Crowley never was an “official” Freemason within the common understanding of the term.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Crowley quickly realized that the post-Yarker era meant change. He was not rebellious by reflex, at least where old British institutions were concerned. He undoubtedly believed [[Ordo Templi Orientis|O.T.O.]] had authority from Yarker to work the Ancient and Primitive Rite's equivalent to the Craft degrees in England, but once made aware of the issue of regularity when having his own French Masonic credentials declined, he was not defiant and on his own made changes to the [[Ordo Templi Orientis|O.T.O.]] to avoid conflict. He inserted notices into the last number of The Equinox to the effect that the [[Ordo Templi Orientis|O.T.O.]] did not infringe upon the just privileges of the [[United Grand Lodge of England|Grand Lodge Of England]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;During WWI Crowley worked slightly revised English Craft rituals in America, but despite the absence of a central Grand Lodge, he met with objections from masonic authorities. He then rewrote the [[Ordo Templi Orientis|O.T.O.]] rituals for I° – III° so that they no longer resembled Craft masonry degrees in language, theme or intent.&lt;ref&gt;Frater Superior [[Hymenaeus Beta]] The Magical Link Vol. IX No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Science and Magic===
Crowley endeavored to use the [[scientific method]] to study what people at the time called spiritual experiences, making &quot;The Method of Science, the Aim of Religion&quot; the catchphrase of his magazine ''The Equinox''. By this he meant that religious experiences should not be taken at [[face value]], but critiqued and experimented with in order to arrive at their underlying mystical or neurological meaning.
&lt;blockquote&gt;''In this connection there was also the point that I was anxious to prove that spiritual progress did not depend on religious or moral codes, but was like any other science. Magick would yield its secrets to the infidel and the [[libertine]], just as one does not have to be a churchwarden in order to discover a new kind of orchid. There are, of course, certain virtues necessary to the Magician; but they are of the same order as those which make a successful chemist.''&lt;ref&gt;''Confessions'' Ch. 64 para. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He frequently expressed views about sex that were radical for his time, and published numerous poems and tracts combining religious themes with sexual imagery both heterosexual and homosexual, as well as [[pederastic]]. One of his most notorious poetry collections, titled &quot;[[White Stains]]&quot; (1898), was published in [[Amsterdam]] in 1898 and dealt specifically with sexually explicit subject matter. However, most of the hundred copies printed for the initial release were later seized and destroyed by British customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/crowley_a_lit.html |title=&gt;&gt; literature &gt;&gt; Crowley, Aleister |publisher=Glbtq.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowley's magical and initiatory system has amongst its innermost reaches a set of teachings on sex magick. [[Sex magick]] is the use of the sex act—or the energies, passions or arousal states it evokes—as a point upon which to focus the will or magical desire for effects in the non-sexual world. In the view of [[Allen Greenfield]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Scarlet Letter Vol V'' no 2, December 1998, [http://www.scarletwoman.org/scarletletter/v5n2/v5n2_hermetic.html web version]. Retrieved 16 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley was inspired by [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]], an American [[Abolitionist]], [[Spiritualist]] medium, and author of the mid-19th century who wrote (in ''Eulis!'', 1874) of using the &quot;nuptive moment&quot; ([[orgasm]]) as the time to make a &quot;[[prayer]]&quot; for events to occur.

Crowley often introduced new terminology for spiritual and magickal practices and theory. In ''[[The Book of the Law]]'' and ''[[The Vision and the Voice]]'', the Aramaic magickal formula ''[[Abracadabra]]'' was changed to ''[[Abrahadabra]]'', which he called the new formula of the [[Aeon (Thelema)|Aeon]]. He also famously spelled [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] in the archaic manner, as ''[[Magick (Aleister Crowley)|magick]]'', to differentiate &quot;the true science of the Magi from all its counterfeits.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Crowley, ''Magick, Book 4'', p.47)&lt;/ref&gt;

He urged his students to learn to control their own mental and behavioural habits, to the point of switching political views and personalities at will. For control of speech (symbolised as the [[unicorn]]) he recommended to choose a commonly used word, letter, or pronouns and adjectives of the first person (such as the word &quot;I&quot;), and avoid using it for a week or more. Should they say the word he instructed them to cut themselves with a blade on each occasion to serve as warning or reminder. Later the student could move on to the &quot;Horse&quot; of action and the &quot;Ox&quot; of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Liber III vel Jugorum&lt;/ref&gt; (These symbols derive from the cabala of Crowley's book ''777''.) Crowley has also been labeled by some [[anthropologists]] as a practitioner of [[neoshamanism]] and revivalist of [[shamanism|shamanistic]] philosophies in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=vQgrfZQLmT4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Shamans/Neo-Shamans:+Ecstasies,+Alternative+Archaeologies+and+Contemporary+Pagans#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Shamans/neo-Shamans: ecstasy, alternative archaeologies, and contemporary pagans By Robert J. Wallis]. Retrieved 9 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Crowley enjoyed being a figure of controversy and frequently deliberately provoked it among his peers and in the media. Author and Crowley expert [[Lon Milo Duquette]] wrote in his 1993 work ''The Magick of Aleister Crowley'' that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Crowley clothed many of his teachings in the thin veil of sensational titillation. By doing so he assured himself that one, his works would only be appreciated by the few individuals capable of doing so, and two, his works would continue to generate interest and be published by and for the benefit of both his admirers and his enemies long after death. He did not—I repeat not—perform or advocate human sacrifice. He was often guilty, however, of the crime of poor judgment.

Like all of us, Crowley had many flaws and shortcomings. The greatest of those, in my opinion, was his inability to understand that everyone else in the world was not as educated and clever as he. It is clear, even in his earliest works, he often took fiendish delight in terrifying those who were either too lazy, too bigoted, or too slow-witted to understand him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=DuQuette|first=Lon Milo |title=The Magick of Aleister Crowley |publisher=[[Weiser Books]] |isbn=1-57863-299-4 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Leila Waddell Headshot.jpg|thumb|[[Leila Waddell|Leila Waddell (Laylah)]], Crowley's muse during the writing of [[The Book of Lies (Crowley)|The Book of Lies]]]]
In this vein many of Crowley's more audacious and outright shocking writings were often thinly veiled attempts to communicate methods of [[Sexual Magic|sexual magick]], often using words like &quot;blood&quot;, &quot;death&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; to replace &quot;[[semen]]&quot;, &quot;ecstasy&quot; and &quot;[[ejaculation]]&quot; in the yet puritanical sexual environment of late 19th/early 20th century England. Take for instance the highly repeated quote from his thickly veiled ''[[Magick (Book 4)|Book Four]]'': &quot;It would be unwise to condemn as irrational the practice of devouring the heart and liver of an adversary while yet warm. For the highest [[spirituality|spiritual]] working one must choose that victim which contains the greatest and purest force; a male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MUURder!&quot;&gt;&quot;Of the Bloody Sacrifice and Matters Cognate.&quot; ''[[Magick (Book 4)|Magick Book 4 Part III, Magick in Theory and Practice]]'', Chapter 12. [[Samuel Weiser]] edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Robert Anton Wilson]], in his 1977 ''The Final Secret of the Illuminati'' (aka ''[[Cosmic Trigger]] Volume One''), interpreted the child as a reference to genes in sperm. Crowley added in a footnote to the text on sacrifice, &quot;the intelligence and innocence of that male child are the perfect understanding of the Magician, his one aim, without lust of result.&quot;

In the &quot;New Comment&quot; to [[The Book of the Law]], &quot;the Beast 666 adviseth that all children shall be accustomed from infancy to witness every type of sexual act, as also the process of birth, lest falsehood fog, and mystery stupefy, their minds ... Politeness has forbidden any direct reference to the subject of sex to secure no happier result than to allow [[Sigmund Freud]] and others to prove that our every thought, speech, and gesture, conscious or unconscious, is an indirect reference!&quot;

===Spiritual and recreational use of drugs===
Crowley was a habitual drug user and also maintained a meticulous record of his drug-induced experiences with [[opium]], [[cocaine]], [[hashish]], [[Religious and spiritual use of cannabis|cannabis]], [[alcohol]], [[Diethyl ether|ether]], [[mescaline]], morphine, and [[heroin]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Confessions of Aleister Crowley: An Autohagiography&quot; by Aleister Crowley ([[Arkana Publishing]], 1989); &quot;Do What Thou Wilt: A Life of Aleister Crowley&quot; by Lawrence Sutin. ([[St. Martin's Press]], 2000); &quot;The Magical Diaries of Aleister Crowley&quot; edited by Stephen Skinner ([[Samuel Weiser|Weiser]], 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allan Bennett]], Crowley's mentor, was said to have &quot;instructed Crowley in the magical use of drugs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Owen |first=Alex |title=The Place of Enchantment: British Occultism and the Culture of the Modern |edition=Hardcover |date=2004-04-14 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |isbn=978-0-226-64201-7 |page=192 |chapter=Aleister Crowley in the Desert |chapterurl=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/642011.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cairo revelation from Aiwass/Aiwaz specifically recommended indulgence in &quot;strange drugs&quot;. While in Paris during the 1920s, Crowley experimented with psychedelic substances, specifically ''[[Anhalonium lewinii]]'', an obsolete scientific name for the [[mescaline]]-bearing cactus [[peyote]] and initiated the writers [[Katherine Mansfield]] and [[Theodore Dreiser]] in its use.&lt;ref&gt;Confessions, pp. 386 and 768.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1930, Crowley dined with [[Aldous Huxley]] in Berlin, and to this day rumours persist that he introduced Huxley to peyote on that occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other drug use===
Crowley developed a [[drug addiction]] after a London doctor prescribed heroin for his asthma and bronchitis.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Do What Thou Wilt: A Life of Aleister Crowley&quot; by Lawrence Sutin. (St. Martin's Press, 2000) ch. 7, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; His life as an addict influenced his 1922 novel, ''[[Diary of a Drug Fiend]]'', but the fiction presented a hopeful outcome of rehabilitation and recovery by means of magical techniques and the exercise of True Will. He overcame his addiction to heroin during this period (chronicled in ''Liber XVIII - The Fountain of Hyacinth'') but began taking it once more late in his life, again on doctor's prescription for his respiratory difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;[&quot;Do What Thou Wilt: A Life of Aleister Crowley&quot; by Lawrence Sutin. (St. Martin's Press, 2000)] p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racism===
Biographer Lawrence Sutin stated that &quot;blatant bigotry is a persistent minor element in Crowley's writings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. p. 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt; He also calls Crowley &quot;a spoiled scion of a wealthy Victorian family who embodied many of the worst [[John Bull]] racial and social prejudices of his upper-class contemporaries,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. p. 02.&lt;/ref&gt; noting that, &quot;Crowley embodied the contradiction that writhed within many Western intellectuals of the time: deeply held racist viewpoints courtesy of their culture, coupled with a fascination with people of colour.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sut00|Sutin 2000]]. p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowley's published expressions of [[antisemitism]] were disturbing enough to later editors of his works that one of them, [[Israel Regardie]], who had also been a student of Crowley, attempted to suppress them. In ''[[777 and Other Qabalistic Writings of Aleister Crowley]]'' (Samuel Weiser, 1975), Regardie, who was Jewish, explained his complete removal of Crowley's antisemitic commentary on the [[Kabbalah]] in the sixth unnumbered page of his editorial introduction: &quot;I am ... omitting Crowley's Preface to the book. It is a nasty, malicious piece of writing, and does not do justice to the system with which he is dealing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''777 and Other Qabalistic Writings of Aleister Crowley'' edited by Israel Regardie, (Samuel Weiser, 1975), sixth unnumbered page of the editorial introduction&lt;/ref&gt; What Regardie had removed was Crowley's &quot;Preface to Sepher Sephiroth&quot;, originally published in ''Equinox 1:8.'' Written in 1911,&lt;ref&gt;''777 and Other Qabalistic Writings of Aleister Crowley'' edited by [[Israel Regardie]], ([[Samuel Weiser]], 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; which contained a statement of Crowley's belief in the [[blood libel against Jews|blood libel against the Jews]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;seph&quot;&gt;''Equinox 1:8''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Human sacrifices are today still practised by the Jews of Eastern Europe, as is set forth at length by [[Sir Richard Burton]] in the MS. which the wealthy Jews of England have compassed heaven and earth to suppress,&lt;ref&gt;The MS Crowley referred to in this passage was &quot;Human Sacrifice among the Sephardine or Eastern Jews&quot; by Sir Richard Francis Burton; it was thought so inflammatory and damaging to the author's reputation that it was never published, and in her will Burton's widow [[Isabel Burton|Isabel]] asked for it to be destroyed to protect her husband's name. References here [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1372818.stm BBC News] and here [http://www.fpp.co.uk/BoD/origins/BurtonMS.html FPP.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; and evidenced by the ever-recurring [[Pogrom#In the Russian Empire|Pogroms]] against which so senseless an outcry is made by those who live among those degenerate Jews who are at least not cannibals.}}

Crowley rhetorically asked how a system of value such as Qabala could come from what &quot;the general position of the ethnologist&quot; called &quot;an entirely barbarous race, devoid of any spiritual pursuit,&quot; and &quot;polytheists&quot; to boot.&lt;ref name=&quot;seph&quot; /&gt; As Crowley himself practiced polytheism, some read these remarks as deliberate irony.&lt;ref name=&quot;dubhumor&quot;&gt;For example, by Bill Heidrick in note on Crowley's introduction to ''Sepher Sephiroth'', retrieved from [http://hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib500.html Hermetic.com], 26 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowley repeated his claim that Jews in Eastern Europe practice ritual child-murder in at least one later work as well, namely the section on mysticism in ''Book Four'' or ''Magick.'' Here he uses quotation marks for &quot;ritual murder&quot; and for &quot;Christian&quot; children.&lt;ref&gt;''Book Four Part I, Mysticism.'' Preliminary Remarks, fn. Samuel Weiser edition&lt;/ref&gt;

An article at ''The Cauldron: A Pagan Forum'' makes the following claim while speaking of the previously mentioned remark&lt;ref name=&quot;MUURder!&quot; /&gt; elsewhere in ''Magick'':

{{quote|At first glance Crowley seems to be advocating an atrocity, the sacrifice of a child, the bugaboo of witchhunters and anti-Semites everywhere. But in fact he is claiming that the historical legend of child sacrifice, used to persecute so many &quot;witches&quot; and Jews, veils a sexual formula of self-sacrifice. In a secret document of the [[O.T.O.|IX*]], the &quot;blood libel&quot; against the Jews – the story that they celebrate covert rituals employing the blood of sacrificed children – is taken as a statement that certain sects of the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hassidim]] possess this secret. The early Christians were accused of such practices by the Roman establishment, and the [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica|Gnostic Catholic Church]] considers this to be evidence of a continuity of the sexual secret from the Gnostics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecauldron.com/crowleytantra.php Crowley and Tantric Magick: The Beast Demystified]. Retrieved 18 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Crowley studied and promoted the mystical and magical teachings of some of the same ethnic groups he attacked, in particular Indian [[yoga]], Jewish [[Kabbalah]] and [[goetia]], and the Chinese [[I Ching]]. Also, in ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley|Confessions]]'' Chapter 86,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/confess/chapter86.html |title=The Confessions of Aleister Crowley |publisher=Hermetic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a private diary which Lawrence Sutin quotes in ''Do What Thou Wilt'' chapter 7, Crowley recorded a memory of a &quot;past life&quot; as the Chinese Taoist writer Ko Hsuan. In another remembered life, Crowley said, he took part in a &quot;Council of Masters&quot; that included many from Asia. He has this to say about the virtues of &quot;Eurasians&quot; and then Jews:

{{quote|I do not believe that their universally admitted baseness is due to a mixture of blood or the presumable peculiarity of their parents; but that they are forced into vileness by the attitude of both their white and coloured neighbours. A similar case is presented by the Jew, who really does only too often possess the bad qualities for which he is disliked; but they are not proper to his race. No people can show finer specimens of humanity. The Hebrew poets and prophets are sublime. The Jewish soldier is courageous, the Jewish rich man generous. The race possesses imagination, romance, loyalty, probity and humanity in an exceptional degree.&lt;br /&gt;
But the Jew has been persecuted so relentlessly that his survival has depended on the development of his worst qualities; avarice, servility, falseness, cunning and the rest. Even the highest-class Eurasians such as [[Ananda Coomaraswamy|Ananda Koomaraswamy]] suffer acutely from the shame of being considered outcast. The irrationality and injustice of their neighbours heightens the feeling and it breeds the very abominations which the snobbish inhumanity of their fellow-men expects of them.&lt;ref&gt;''Confessions'' chap. 54&lt;/ref&gt;}}

All these remarks must necessarily be contrasted with Crowley's explicit philosophical instructions in his last book ''Magick Without Tears''. Chapter 73, which is titled &quot;'Monsters', Niggers, Jews, etc,&quot; and which states his essentially individualistic and anti-racialist views:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

... you say, &quot;Every man and every woman is a star.&quot; does need some attention to the definition of &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman.&quot; What is the position, you say, of &quot;monsters&quot;? And men of &quot;inferior&quot; races, like the [[Veddah]], [[Hottentot]] and the Australian [[Blackfellow]]? There must be a line somewhere, and will I please draw it?

...

Not only does it seem to me the only conceivable way of reconciling this and similar passages with &quot;Every man and every woman is a star.&quot; to assert the sovereignty of the individual, and to deny the right-to-exist to &quot;class-consciousness,&quot; &quot;crowd-psychology,&quot; and so to mob-rule and Lynch-Law, but also the only practicable plan whereby we may each one of us settle down peaceably to mind his own business, to pursue his True Will, and to accomplish the Great Work.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The &quot;Thelemic&quot; philosophical position which he taught in this volume (which is a series of letters of direct personal instruction to a student of Magick) is clearly an anti-racist one. Even in private comments on ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Crowley said that his own preferred &quot;master class&quot; was above all distinctions of race.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on Women===
Biographer [[Lawrence Sutin]] stated that Crowley &quot;largely accepted the notion, implicitly embodied in Victorian sexology, of women as secondary social beings in terms of intellect and sensibility.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sutin, ch. 1, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Occult scholar Tim Maroney compared him to other figures and movements of the time and suggests that some others might have shown more respect for women.&lt;ref&gt;''Facts and Phallacies'' by Tim Maroney (1998) (Originally published in The Scarlet Letter, Volume V, Number 2). Retrieved from [http://tim.maroney.org/Essays/Facts_and_Phallacies.html Maroney.org], 8 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Another biographer, Martin Booth, while describing Crowley's misogyny, asserts that in other ways he was pro-feminist who thought women were badly served by the law. He considered abortion to be tantamount to murder and thought little of a society that condoned it, believing that women, when left to choose outside of prevailing social influences, would never want to end a pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Magick Life&quot;, Martin Booth, p400, Coronet, ISBN 0-340-71806-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowley stated that women, except &quot;a few rare individuals,&quot; care most about having children and will conspire against their husbands if they lack children to whom to devote themselves.&lt;ref&gt;(Crowley ''Magick Without Tears'' p. 254); {{cite book|author=Aleister Crowley|title=[[Magick Without Tears]]|isbn=978-0-941404-17-4|year=1982|publisher=Falcon Press|location=Phoenix, AZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Confessions'', Crowley says he learned this from his first marriage.&lt;ref&gt;(Crowley ''Confessions'' p.415); {{cite book| author=Aleister Crowley| title=The Confessions of Aleister Crowley: An Autohagiography| isbn=978-0-14-019189-9| year=1989| publisher=Arkana| location=London }} Gender Bias: &quot;There is yet a further point. My marriage taught me many lessons, and this not the least: when women are not devoted to children – a few rare individuals are capable of other interests – they take a morbid pleasure in conspiring against a husband, especially if he be a father. They take advantage of his preoccupation with his work in the world to conceive and execute every kind of criminally cunning abomination. The belief in witchcraft was not all superstition; its psychological roots were sound. Women who are thwarted in their natural instincts turn inevitably to all kinds of malignant mischief, from slander to domestic destruction.&quot; – Chapter 50&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that their intentions were to force a man to abandon his life's work for their interests. He found women &quot;tolerable&quot;, he wrote, only when they served the sole role of helping a man in his life's work. However, he said that they were incapable of actually understanding the nature of this work itself.&lt;ref&gt;(Crowley ''Confessions'' pp. 95)&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that women did not have individuality and were solely guided by their habits or [[Impulse (psychology)|impulse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;(Crowley ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley]]'' pp. 96–7)&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect Crowley displayed the attitude to women conventional for a male of his time.

Nevertheless, when he sought what he called the supreme magical-mystical attainment, Crowley asked [[Leah Hirsig]] to direct his ordeals, marking the first time since the schism in the Golden Dawn that another person verifiably took charge of his initiation.&lt;ref&gt;(Sutin ''Do What Thou Wilt'' pp. 282–290)&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hierophant]] section of ''[[The Book of Thoth (Crowley)|The Book of Thoth]]'', Crowley interprets a verse from [[The Book of the Law]] that speaks of &quot;the woman girt with a sword; she represents the Scarlet Woman in the hierarchy of the new Aeon.(...)This woman represents [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] as she now is in this new aeon; no longer the mere vehicle of her male counterpart, but armed and militant.&quot;

In his Commentaries on ''The Book of the Law'' Crowley stated what he considered to be the correct Thelemic position towards women:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We of Thelema say that &quot;Every man and every woman is a star.&quot; We do not fool and flatter women; we do not despise and abuse them. To us, a woman is herself, absolute, original, independent, free, self-justified, exactly as a man is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher=Red Wheel/Weiser| isbn=0877288887| last=Crowley| first=Aleister| others=[[Hymenaeus Beta|Hymenaeus.

==Writings==
{{Main|Works of Aleister Crowley}}
{{double image|right|Moonchild.gif|120|777.gif|120|Crowley wrote in a wide variety of genres: here are copies of his novel ''[[Moonchild (novel)|Moonchild]]'' (1917) and his list of magical correspondences, ''777'' (1909).}}
Aleister Crowley was a highly prolific writer, who published works on a wide variety of topics, including his religion of Thelema, mysticism, ceremonial magic, as well as non-occult topics like politics, philosophy and culture. Widely seen as his most important work was ''[[The Book of the Law]]'' (1904), the central text of the Thelemite religion, although he claimed that he himself was not its writer, but merely its scribe for the angelic being [[Aiwass]]. This was just one of many books that he believed that he had channelled from a spiritual being, which collectively came to be termed ''[[The Holy Books of Thelema]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cro83|Crowley 1983]].&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote books on ceremonial magick, namely ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'' (1912), ''[[The Vision and the Voice]]'' and ''[[777 and other Qabalistic writings]]'', and edited a copy of the [[grimoire]] known as ''[[The Goetia: The Lesser Key of Solomon the King]]''. Another of his important works was a book on [[mysticism]], ''[[The Book of Lies (Crowley)|The Book of Lies]]'' (1912), whilst another was a collection of different essays entitled ''[[Little Essays Toward Truth]]'' (1938). He also penned an [[autobiography]], entitled ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley]]'' (1929). Throughout his lifetime he wrote many letters and meticulously kept diaries, some of which were posthumously published as ''[[Magick Without Tears]]''. During his lifetime he also edited and produced a series of publications in book form called ''[[The Equinox]]'' (subtitled &quot;The Review of Scientific Illuminism&quot;), which served as the voice of his magical order, the [[Argenteum Astrum|A∴A∴]]. Although the entire set is influential and remains one of the definitive works on [[occultism]], some of the more notable issues are &quot;[[The Blue Equinox]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Equinox of the Gods (Crowley)|The Equinox of the Gods]]&quot;, &quot;[[Eight Lectures on Yoga]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Book of Thoth (Crowley)|The Book of Thoth]]&quot; and &quot;[[Liber Aleph]]&quot;.

Crowley also wrote fiction, including plays and later novels, most of which have not received significant notice outside of occult circles. His most notable fictional works include ''[[Moonchild (novel)|Moonchild]]'' (1917), ''[[Diary of a Drug Fiend]]'' (1922) and ''[[The Stratagem and other Stories]]'' (1929). He also self-published much of his poetry, including the erotic ''[[White Stains]]'' (1898) and ''[[Clouds without Water]]'' (1909), although perhaps his best known poem was his ode to the ancient god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], ''Hymn to Pan'' (1929).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paganlibrary.com/music_poetry/crowleys_pan_invocation.php |title='&amp;#39;Hymn to Pan'&amp;#39; |publisher=Paganlibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Crowley's poetry can be seen through the fact that three of his compositions, &quot;The Quest&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/236/314.html |title=The Quest |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Neophyte&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/236/315.html |title=The Neophyte |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;The Rose and the Cross&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/236/316.html |title=The Rose and the Cross |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; were included in the 1917 collection ''[[The Oxford Book of English Mystical Verse]]'', however [[The Oxford Companion to English Literature]] entry on him describes him as a &quot;bad but prolific poet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, Margaret. ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature''. Oxford University Press, 1985, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and influence==
Crowley has remained an influential figure, both amongst occultists and in [[popular culture]], particularly that of Britain, but also of other parts of the world.

===Occult===
After Crowley's death, various of his colleagues and fellow Thelemites continued with his work. One of his British disciples, [[Kenneth Grant]], subsequently founded the [[Typhonian Order|Typhonian O.T.O.]] in the 1950s. In America, his followers also continued, one of the most prominent of whom was [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]], the influential rocket scientist. Parsons performed what he described as the [[Babalon Working]] in 1946, and subsequently claimed to have been taught the fourth part of the ''Book of the Law''. Parsons would also later work with and influence [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the later founder of [[Scientology]].

Crowley inspired and influenced a number of later [[List of Old Malvernians|Malvernians]] including Major-General [[J. F. C. Fuller|John Fuller]], the inventor of artificial moonlight, and [[Cecil Williamson]], the neo-pagan witch.

One of Crowley's acquaintances in the last months of his life was [[Gerald Gardner]], who was initiated into O.T.O. by Crowley and subsequently went on to found the [[Neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]].  Various scholars on early Wiccan history, such as [[Ronald Hutton]], [[Philip Heselton]] and [[Leo Ruickbie]] concur that witchcraft's early rituals, as devised by Gardner, contained much from Crowley's writings such as the [[Gnostic Mass]]. The third degree initiation ceremony in Gardnerian Wicca (including the [[Great Rite]]) is derived almost completely from the Gnostic Mass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eocto.org/article/101] Ecclesia Ordinis Caelestis Templum Olympicus - Thelemic Origins of Wicca&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Gardner liked Crowley's writings because he believed that they &quot;breathed the very spirit of [[paganism]].&quot;{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Crowley was also an influence on both the late [[1960's counterculture]] and the [[New Age]] movement.

===Popular culture===

Fictionalised accounts of Crowley or characters based upon him have been included in a number of literary works, published both during his life and after. The writer [[W. Somerset Maugham]] used him as the model for the character in his novel ''[[The Magician (Maugham novel)|The Magician]]'', published in 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;Routledge&quot;/&gt; Crowley was flattered by Maugham's fictionalised depiction of himself, stating that &quot;he had done more than justice to the qualities of which I was proud... ''The Magician'' was, in fact, an appreciation of my genius such as I had never dreamed of inspiring.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Symonds|1997|p=132.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Dennis Wheatley]]'s popular thriller ''[[The Devil Rides Out]]'', the Satanic cult leader Mocata is inspired by Crowley, and in turn the deceased Satanist Adrian Marcato referred to in [[Ira Levin]]'s ''[[Rosemary's Baby]]'' is likewise a Crowley-like figure. Long after his death Crowley was still being used for similar purposes, appearing as a main character in [[Robert Anton Wilson]]'s 1981 novel ''[[Masks of the Illuminati]]''. Additionally, the acclaimed [[comic book]] author [[Alan Moore]], himself a practitioner of [[ceremonial magic]], has also included Crowley in several of his works. In Moore's ''[[From Hell]]'', he appears in a cameo as a young boy declaring that magic is real, whilst in the series ''[[Promethea]]'' he appears several times existing in a realm of the imagination called the Immateria. Moore has also discussed Crowley's associations with the [[Highbury]] area of London in his recorded magical working, ''The Highbury Working''.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle-White 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Other comic book writers have also made use of him, with [[Pat Mills]] and [[Olivier Ledroit]] portraying him as a reincarnated [[vampire]] in their series ''[[Requiem Chevalier Vampire]]''. Crowley also is referenced in the [[Batman]] comic [[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth]] where the character [[Amadeus Arkham]] meets with him, discuss the symbolism of Egyptian tarot, and they play chess. He has also appeared in Japanese media, such as ''[[D.Gray-Man]]'' and ''[[Toaru Majutsu no Index]]'', as well as the [[hentai]] series ''[[Bible Black]]'', where he has a fictional daughter named Jody Crowley who continues her father's search for the [[Babalon|Scarlet Woman]]. He is also depicted in the Original PlayStation game ''[[Nightmare Creatures]]'' as a powerful demonic resurrection of himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theofantastique.com/2010/08/03/video-games-zombies-at-my-neighbors-and-nightmare-creatures/ |title=Video games: Zombies Ate My Neighbours, and Nightmare Creatures |last=Morehead |first=John W. |date=August 3, 2010 |work=Theofantastique: a meeting place for myth, imagination and mystery in pop culture |publisher=Wordpress |accessdate=2010-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowley has been an influence for a string of popular musicians throughout the 20th century. The hugely popular band [[The Beatles]] included him as one of [[List of images on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|the many figures]] on the cover sleeve of their 1967 album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', where he is situated between [[Sri Yukteswar Giri]] and [[Mae West]]. A more intent interest in Crowley was held by [[Jimmy Page]], the guitarist and co-founder of 1970s rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. Despite not describing himself as a Thelemite or being a member of the Ordo Templi Orientis, Page was still fascinated by Crowley, and owned some of his clothing, manuscripts and ritual objects, and during the 1970s bought [[Boleskine House]], which also appears in the band's movie ''[[The Song Remains the Same (film)|The Song Remains the Same]]''. The later rock musician [[Ozzy Osbourne]] released a song titled &quot;[[Mr. Crowley]]&quot; on his solo album ''[[Blizzard of Ozz]]'', whilst a comparison of Crowley and Osbourne in the context of their media portrayals can be found in the ''Journal of Religion and Popular Culture.''&lt;ref&gt;Christopher M. Moreman, &quot;Devil Music and the Great Beast: Ozzy Osbourne, Aleister Crowley, and the Christian Right,&quot; ''Journal of Religion and Popular Culture'' 5 (2003), [http://www.usask.ca/relst/jrpc/art5-devilmusic.html University of Saskatchewan]&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley has also been a favorite of Swiss Avant-Garde metal band Celtic Frost. In fact, the song [[Os Abysmi Vel Daath]] from Monotheist is based partially on some of his writings.

Crowley has also had an influence in [[film|cinema]]; in particular, he was a major influence and inspiration to the work on the radical [[avant garde]] underground film-maker [[Kenneth Anger]], especially his Magick Lantern Cycle series of works. One of Anger's works is a film of Crowley's paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kenneth Anger: celluloid sorcery and psychadelic Satanism |first=Mark |last=Pilkington |magazine=Bizzare Magazine |date=2007-05-15 |url=http://www.bizarremag.com/entertainment/movies/68/kenneth_anger.html |accessdate=2010-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 he gave a lecture on the subject of Crowley.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Anger|Anger, Kenneth]]. 2009. ''Do What Thou Wilt: Kenneth Anger and Aleister Crowley and the Occult''. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV89WCXgFhI Youtube.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Dickinson]], singer with [[Iron Maiden]], wrote the screenplay of ''[[Chemical Wedding (film)|Chemical Wedding]]'' (released in America on DVD as ''Crowley''),&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0974536|Chemical Wedding}}&lt;/ref&gt; which features [[Simon Callow]] as Oliver Haddo, the name taken from the Magician-villain character in the [[Somerset Maugham]] book &quot;The Magician&quot;, who was in turn inspired by Maugham's meeting with Crowley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/Blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=79442 |title=Roadrunner Records |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date= |accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian historian of esotericism [[Giordano Berti]], in his book ''Tarocchi di Aleister Crowley'' (1998) quotes a number of literary works and films inspired by Crowley's life and legends. Some of the films are ''The Magician'' (1926) by [[Rex Ingram (director)|Rex Ingram]], based upon the eponymous book written by [[William Somerset Maugham]] (1908); ''[[Night of the Demon]]'' (1957) by [[Jacques Tourneur]], based on the story &quot;Casting the Runes&quot; by [[M. R. James]]; and ''The Devils Rides Out'' (1968) by [[Terence Fisher]], from the eponymous thriller by [[Dennis Wheatley]]. Also: &quot;Dance To The Music of Time&quot; by [[Anthony Powell]], &quot;Black Easter&quot; by [[James Blish]], and &quot;The Winged Bull&quot; by [[Dion Fortune]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berti |first1=Giordano |authorlink1=Giordano Berti |last2=Negrini |first2=Roberto |last3=Tebani |first3=Rodrigo |title=I Tarocchi di Aleister Crowley |trans_title=The Tarot of Aleister Crowley |year=1998 |publisher=Lo Scarabeo |location=Torino |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His name was used for two characters in American horror/adventure/fantasy series, [[Supernatural (tv series)|Supernatural]], one being the self-proclaimed 'King of the Crossroads' Crowley, originally a Scotsman, and Alistair, the demon who tormented [[Dean Winchester]] whilst Dean was in [[Hell]].

Aleister Crowley is also referenced in the Canadian-produced comedy/horror TV series ''[[Todd and the Book of Pure Evil]]''. Todd, Curtis, Jenny, and Hannah are students at Crowley High, the only high school in a small town secretly founded by Satanists.

[[File:The Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch High Resolution.jpg|thumb|350px|[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]] by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], depicting [[paradise]] and [[hell]]]]

The '''afterlife''' (also referred to as '''life after death''', the '''Hereafter''', the '''Next World''', or the '''Other Side''') is the belief that a part of, or essence of, an individual which carries with it and confers personal identity survives [[death|the death of the body]] of this world and this lifetime, by natural or supernatural means. In some popular views, this continued existence often takes place in a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] realm, and in other popular views, the individual may be reborn into this world and begin the life cycle over again. In this latter view, such rebirths and deaths may take place over and over again continuously until the individual gains entry to a spiritual realm. Major views on the afterlife derive from [[religion]], [[esotericism]] and [[metaphysics]].

The dead are usually believed to go to a specific [[Plane (esotericism)|plane of existence]] after death (other than [[eternal oblivion]]), typically believed to be determined by a [[god]] or divine judge, based on their [[orthopraxy|actions]] or [[orthodoxy|beliefs]] during physical life. In contrast, the term ''afterlife'' refers to another life in which only the &quot;essence&quot; of the being is preserved, and &quot;[[reincarnation]]&quot; is another life on Earth or possibly within the same universe.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Types of views on the afterlife==
There are two different types of views on the afterlife{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

*The first type is based on observations and conjecture made by humans or instruments (for example a radio or a voice recorder, which are used in [[electronic voice phenomena]], or EVP). These observations come from [[reincarnation research]], [[near death experience]]s, [[out-of-body experience]]s, [[astral projection]], EVP, [[mediumship]], various forms of photography and so forth. Academic inquiry into such phenomena can be broken down roughly into two categories: psychical research generally focuses on case studies, interviews, and field reports, while [[parapsychology]] relates to strictly laboratory research.

*The second type is based on a form of faith, usually faith in the stories that are told by ancestors or faith in [[religious texts|religious books]] like the [[Bible]], the [[Qur'an]], the [[Talmud]], the [[Vedas]], the [[Tripitaka]] etc. This article is mainly about this second type.

==The afterlife in different metaphysical models==
:''See the [[list of philosophical questions]] for information.''

In metaphysical models, [[theists]] generally believe some sort of afterlife awaits people when they die. Members of some generally non-theistic religions such as [[Buddhism]], tend to believe in an afterlife, but without reference to a God.  The [[Sadducees]] were an ancient Jewish sect that generally believed that there was a God but no afterlife.

Many religions, whether they believe in the soul's existence in another world like Christianity, Islam and many [[Paganism|pagan]] belief systems, or in reincarnation like many forms of Hinduism and Buddhism, believe that one's status in the afterlife is a reward or punishment for their conduct during life.

[[Agnosticism|Agnostics]] generally hold the position that, like the existence of a God, the existence of other metaphysical phenomena such as the existence of souls or life after death is not verifiable and therefore remains unknown or unknowable.

[[Atheism|Atheists]] and [[Secular Humanism|Secular Humanists]] may not believe in any afterlife.

===Reincarnation===
{{main|Reincarnation}}
Reincarnation refers to an afterlife concept found among Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs [[Rosicrucian]]s, [[Spiritism|Spiritists]], and Wiccans. Reincarnation is also a belief described in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] Judaism as gilgul neshamot (Reincarnation of Souls).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.projectmind.org/exoteric/souls.html&lt;/ref&gt; In reincarnation, spiritual development continues after death as the deceased begins another earthly life in the [[Physical plane|physical world]], acquiring a superior grade of consciousness and [[altruism]] by means of successive reincarnations. This succession leads toward an eventual [[salvation|liberation]].

One consequence of the Hindu and Spiritist beliefs is that our current lives are also an afterlife. According to those beliefs events in our current life are consequences of actions taken in previous lives, or Karma.

Rosicrucians,&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Heindel]], The Rosicrucian Christianity Lectures ([http://www.rosicrucian.com/rcl/rcleng01.htm#lecture1 The Riddle of Life and Death]), 1908, ISBN 0-911274-84-7&lt;/ref&gt; in the same way of those who have had [[near-death experiences]], speak of a [[life review]] period occurring immediately after death and before entering the afterlife's [[Plane (esotericism)|planes of existence]] (before the [[silver cord]] is broken), followed by a [[Last Judgment#Esoteric Christian tradition|judgment]], more akin to a Final Review or End Report over one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Max Heindel, [http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/death5.htm Death and Life in Purgatory] - [http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/death6.htm Life and Activity in Heaven]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Wicca]]ns, though not all, profess a belief in an afterlife called [[the Summerland]], a peaceful and sunny place where the souls of the newly dead are sent.  Here, souls rest, recuperate from life, and reflect on the experiences they had during their lives.  After a period of rest, the souls are reincarnated, and the memory of their previous lives is erased.
[[Shi'a Muslim]]s believe to [[Raj'a]] that can be understood as a limited reincarnation.

===Heaven &amp; Hell===

In [[Abrahamic religion]]s the view is generally held that one goes to [[hell]] or [[heaven]] depending on your deeds on Earth,&lt;ref&gt;Heaven and Hell: My Life in the Eagles (1974-2001)&lt;/ref&gt; or [[predestination]] and [[Unconditional election]].

===Limbo or purgatory===

In the Roman Catholic Church [[limbo]] is the abode of unbaptized but innocent or righteous souls, as those of infants or virtuous individuals who lived before the coming of Christ. In other [[Christian]] denominations it has been described as an intermediate place or state of confinement in oblivion and neglect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/limbo&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of [[purgatory]] is associated particularly with the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]] (in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern sui juris churches or rites]] it is a doctrine, though often without using the name &quot;Purgatory&quot;); [[Anglican]]s of the [[Anglo-Catholic]] tradition generally also hold to the belief. [[John Wesley]], the founder of [[Methodism]], believed in an [[intermediate state]] between death and the final judgment and in the possibility of &quot;continuing to grow in holiness there&quot;, but Methodism does not officially affirm this belief and denies the possibility of helping by prayer any who may be in that state.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Campbell, Methodist Doctrine: The Essentials (Abingdon 1999), quoted in [http://www.umportal.org/article.asp?id=5101 Feature article by ''United Methodist Reporter'' Managing Editor Robin Russell] and in [http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=4746355&amp;content_id=%7B94F6F768-0EA6-4C1B-B6B6-0C88EC04E8A2%7D&amp;notoc=1 FAQ Belief: What happens immediately after a person dies?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Egypt===
The afterlife played an important role in [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], and its belief system is one of the earliest known. When the body died, parts of its soul known as ''ka'' (body double) and the ''ba'' (personality) would go to the Kingdom of the Dead. While the soul dwelt in the [[Aaru|Fields of Aaru]], [[Osiris]] demanded work as restitution for the protection he provided. Statues were placed in the tombs to serve as substitutes for the deceased.

Arriving at one's reward in afterlife was a demanding ordeal, requiring a sin-free heart and the ability to recite the spells, passwords, and formulae of the [[Book of the Dead]]. In the Hall of Two Truths, the deceased's heart was weighed against the ''Shu'' feather of truth and justice taken from the headdress of the goddess [[Ma'at]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bard| first = Katheryn | title = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt | publisher = Routledge | year = 1999| isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the heart was lighter than the feather, they could pass on, but if it were heavier they would be devoured by the demon [[Ammit]].

Egyptians also believed that being mummified was the only way to have an afterlife. Only if the corpse had been properly [[Embalming|embalmed]] and entombed in a [[mastaba]], could the [[Resurrection of the Dead|dead live again]] in the Fields of Yalu and accompany the Sun on its daily ride. Due to the dangers the afterlife posed, the Book of the Dead was placed in the tomb with the body as well as food, jewelry, and 'curses'. They also used the &quot;opening of the mouth&quot;.

Ancient Egyptian civilization was based on religion; their belief in the rebirth after death became their driving force behind their funeral practices. Death was simply a temporary interruption, rather than complete cessation, of life, and that eternal life could be ensured by means like piety to the gods, preservation of the physical form through Mummification, and the provision of statuary and other funerary equipment. Each human consisted of the physical body, the 'ka', the 'ba', and the 'akh'. The Name and Shadow were also living entities. To enjoy the afterlife, all these elements had to be sustained and protected from harm.

On March 30, 2010, a spokesman for the Egyptian Culture Ministry claimed it had unearthed a large red granite door in Luxor with inscriptions by User,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/articles/door-to-afterlife-found-in-egyptian-tomb|title=Door to Afterlife found in Egyptian tomb |publisher=www.meeja.com.au |date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2008-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a powerful adviser to the [[18th dynasty]] Queen [[Hatshepsut]] who ruled between 1479 BC and 1458 BC, the longest of any woman. It believes the false door is a 'door to the Afterlife'. According to the archaeologists, the door was reused in a  structure in [[Roman Egypt]].

===Ancient Greek and Roman===
The Greek god [[Hades]] is known in [[Greek mythology]] as the king of the [[underworld]], a place where souls live after death. The Greek god [[Hermes]], the messenger of the gods, would take the dead soul of a person to the underworld (sometimes called Hades or the House of Hades). Hermes would leave the soul on the banks of the River [[Styx]], the river between life and death. [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], also known as the ferry-man, would take the soul across the river to Hades, if the soul had gold (The family of the dead soul would put coins under the dead body's tongue). Once crossed, the soul would be judged by [[Aeacus]], [[Rhadamanthus]], and King [[Minos]]. The soul would be sent to [[Elysium]], [[Tartarus]], [[Asphodel Fields]], or the [[Fields of Punishment]]. The Elysium Fields were for the ones that were good and sinned minimally. It was green (plants), happy, and the sun always shined. Tartarus was for the people that defied the gods, did nothing but sin, or were [[monster]]s. The Asphodel Fields simply existed. Those whose sins equalled their goodness, lived and did nothing in life, or were not judged. The Fields of Punishment were for people that had sinned often, but not so much as to be deserving of Tartarus. In Tartarus, the soul would get punished (dipped in [[lava]], burned at stake, the rack, etc.). Some heroes of Greek legend are allowed to visit the underworld. The Romans had a similar belief system about the afterlife, with Hades becoming known as [[Pluto]]. In the ancient Greek myth about [[Hercules]], he needs to travel to the underworld to capture [[Cerberus]] as [[Labours of Hercules|one of his tasks]].

[[Dream of Scipio]], written by [[Cicero]], describes what seems to be an out of body experience, of the soul traveling high above the Earth, looking down at the small planet, from far away.

In book 6 of  [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]], the hero, [[Aeneas]], travels to the underworld to see his father.  By the river Styx, he sees the souls of those not given a proper burial, forced to wait by the river until someone buries them.  While down there, along with the dead, he is shown the place where the wrongly convicted reside, the fields of sorrow where those who committed suicide and now regret it reside, including Aeneas' former lover, the warriors and shades, tartarus (where the titans and powerful non-mortal enemies of the Olympians reside) where he can hear the groans of the imprisoned, the palace of [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], and the fields of Elysium where the descendants of the divine and bravest heroes reside.  He sees the river of forgetfulness, Lethe, which the dead must drink to forget their life and begin anew.  Lastly, his father shows him all of the future heroes of Rome who will live if Aeneas fulfills his destiny in founding the city.

===Norse religion===
The [[Poetic Edda|Poetic]] and [[Prose Edda]]s, the oldest sources for information on the Norse concept of the afterlife, vary in their description of the several realms that are described as falling under this topic. The most well-known are:
*[[Valhalla]]: (lit. &quot;Hall of the Slain&quot; i.e. &quot;the Chosen Ones&quot;) This heavenly abode, somewhat analogous to the Greek Elysium, is reserved for those brave warriors who die heroically in battle.
*[[Hel (realm)|Hel]]: (lit. &quot;The Covered Hall&quot;) This abode is somewhat like [[Hades]] from Ancient Greek religion: there, something not unlike the [[Asphodel Meadows]] can be found, and people who have neither excelled in that which is good nor excelled in that which is bad can expect to go there after they die and be reunited with their loved ones.
*[[Niflhel]]: (lit. &quot;The Dark&quot; or &quot;Misty Hel&quot;) This realm is roughly analogous to Greek [[Tartarus]]. It is the deeper level beneath Hel, and those who break oaths, abduct and rape women, and commit other vile things will be sent there to be among their kind to suffer harsh punishments.

==Abrahamic religions==
===Judaism===
{{main|Jewish Eschatology}}

====Resurrection====
Writing that would later be incorporated into the [[Hebrew Bible]] names [[Sheol]] as the place of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Stephen. Understanding the Bible.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian writer's traditional re-interpretation is as follows:

The Hebrew word Sheol can mean many things,i.e. Grave, resort, place of waiting, place of healing etc. It can also mean deep ) when the earth opens up and destroys the rebellious Korah, Dathan and Abiram and their 250 followers ({{niv|Numbers|16:31-33|Numbers 16:31-33}}). One might take this as implying that Sheol is literally underground, although it is as easily read literally, as signifying an earthquake or split in the earth.{{fcn}}

[[Solomon]] states in the book of [[Ecclesiastes]]:
&quot;For what happens to the sons of men also happens to animals; one thing befalls them: as one dies, so dies the other. Surely, they all have one breath; man has no advantage over animals, for all is vanity. All go to one place: all are from the dust, and all return to dust. Who knows the spirit of the sons of men, which goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, which goes down to the earth?&quot; ([[Ecclesiastes|Ecc.]] 3:19-21 [[New King James Version|NKJV]])

&quot;But for him who is joined to all the living there is hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion. For the living know that they will die; But the dead know nothing, And they have no more reward, For the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, their hatred, and their envy have now perished; Nevermore will they have a share in anything done under the sun.&quot; (Ecc. 9:4-6 NKJV)

Similarly Psalms 146:2-4 (NKJV) states:
&quot;Do not put your trust in princes, Nor in a son of man, in whom there is no help. His spirit departs, he returns to his earth; In that very day his plans perish.&quot;

In the book of Job it is stated:
&quot;But man dies and is laid away; indeed he breathes his last and where is he?... So man lies down and does not rise. Till the heavens are no more, they will not awake nor be roused from their sleep... If a man dies, shall he live again?&quot; (Job 14:10,12,14a NKJV)

The Talmud offers a number of thoughts relating to the afterlife. After death, the soul is brought for judgment. Those who have led pristine lives enter immediately into the &quot;[[Olam Haba]]&quot; or World to Come. Most do not enter the World to Come immediately, but now experience a period of review of their earthly actions and they are made aware of what they have done wrong. Some view this period as being a &quot;re-schooling&quot;, with the soul gaining wisdom as one's errors are reviewed. Others view this period to include punishment for past wrongs. At the end of this period, approximately one year, the soul then takes its place in the World to Come. Although punishments are made part of certain Jewish conceptions of the afterlife, the concept of &quot;eternal damnation&quot;, so prevalent in other religions, is not a central tenet of the Jewish afterlife.  According to the Talmud, eternal punishment is reserved for a much smaller group of malicious and evil leaders, either whose deeds go way beyond norms, or who lead large groups of people to evil.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/tsa/tsa37.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0011_0_10049.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the Talmud, completed by A.D. 500, non-Jews who are purely evil cease to exist in any realm when they die. However, authorities agree that virtuous gentiles are given a share in the world-to-come.
The [[Book of Enoch]] describes Sheol as divided into four compartments for four types of the dead: the faithful saints who await resurrection in [[Paradise]], the merely virtuous who await their reward, the wicked who await punishment, and the wicked who have already been punished and will not be resurrected on Judgment Day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Emerson Fosdick|Fosdick, Harry Emerson]]. A guide to understanding the Bible. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 1956. page 276.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that the Book of Enoch is considered apocryphal by most denominations of Christianity and all denominations of Judaism.

The book of [[2 Maccabees]] gives a clear account of the dead awaiting a future resurrection and judgment, plus prayers and offerings for the dead to remove the burden of sin.

[[Maimonides]] describes the [[Olam Haba]] (&quot;World to Come&quot;) in spiritual terms, relegating the prophesied physical resurrection to the status of a future miracle, unrelated to the afterlife or the Messianic era. According to Maimonides, an afterlife continues for the soul of every human being, a soul now separated from the body in which it was &quot;housed&quot; during its earthly existence.

The [[Zohar]] describes [[Gehenna]] not as a place of punishment for the wicked but as a place of spiritual purification for souls.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/06-Jewish-Thought/section-9.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism Rejection of Resurrection=====
[[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] reject Resurrection.  Accordingly, they have [[Amidah#Modern changes by liberal denominations|modified]] the text to read ''m'chayei hakol'' (&quot;who gives life to all&quot;). In the new prayer book released by the Reform Judaism movement, they have returned the traditional prayer for the resurrection of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/103652.html Reform set to introduce new siddur]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abrahamic reincarnation====
While ancient Greek philosophers like [[Plato]] attempted to prove the existence of reincarnation through philosophical proofs, Jewish mystics who believed in reincarnation simply accepted it as a divine reality.

Although there is no reference to reincarnation in the Talmud or any prior writings,&lt;ref&gt;Saadia Gaon in Emunoth ve-Deoth Section vi&lt;/ref&gt; according to rabbis such as Rabbi Avraham Arieh Trugman, reincarnation is recognized as being part and parcel of Jewish tradition. Rabbi Trugman explains that it is through oral tradition that the meanings of the Torah, its commandments and stories, are known and understood. The classic work of Jewish mysticism whose origins date back 2000 years,&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube.com&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM8dn68vgD8&lt;/ref&gt; the Zohar, is quoted liberally in all Jewish learning; in the Zohar the idea of reincarnation is mentioned repeatedly. Rabbi Trugman states that in the last five centuries the concept of reincarnation, which until then had been a much hidden tradition within Judaism, was given open exposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube.com&quot;/&gt;

Rabbi Shraga Simmons commented that within the Bible itself, the idea [of reincarnation] is intimated in Deut. 25:5-10, Deut. 33:6 and Isaiah 22:14, 65:6.&lt;ref&gt;http://judaism.about.com/library/3_askrabbi_o/bl_simmons_reincarnation.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Yirmiyahu Ullman wrote that reincarnation is an &quot;ancient, mainstream belief in Judaism.&quot; The Zohar, written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai close to two thousand years ago, makes frequent and lengthy references to reincarnation. Onkelos, a righteous convert and authoritative commentator of the same period, explained the verse, &quot;Let Reuben live and not die...&quot; (Deuteronomy 33:6) to mean that Reuben should merit the World to Come directly, and not have to die again as result of being reincarnated. The great Torah scholar, commentator and kabbalist, Nachmanides (Ramban 1195-1270), attributed Job's suffering to reincarnation, as hinted in Job's saying &quot;God does all these things twice or three times with a man, to bring back his soul from the pit to...the light of the living' (Job 33:29,30).&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://ohr.edu/yhiy/article.php/1077&lt;/ref&gt;

Reincarnation, called ''[[gilgul]]'', became popular in folk belief, and is found in much [[Yiddish]] literature among [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. Among a few kabbalists, it was posited that some human souls could end up being reincarnated into non-human bodies. These ideas were found in a number of Kabbalistic works from the 13th century, and also among many mystics in the late 16th century. [[Martin Buber]]'s early collection of stories of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]'s life includes several that refer to people reincarnating in successive lives.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Buber, &quot;Legende des Baalschem&quot; in ''Die Chassidischen Bücher'', Hellerau 1928, especially ''Die niedergestiegene Seele''&lt;/ref&gt;

Among well known (generally non-kabbalist or anti-kabbalist) Rabbis who rejected the idea of reincarnation are Saadia Gaon, [[David Kimhi]], [[Hasdai Crescas]], Yedayah Bedershi (early 14th century), [[Joseph Albo]], [[Abraham ibn Daud]], the [[Asher ben Jehiel|Rosh]] and [[Leon de Modena]]. [[Saadia Gaon]], in [[Emunoth ve-Deoth]] (Hebrew: &quot;beliefs and opinions&quot;) concludes Section VI with a refutation of the doctrine of metempsychosis (reincarnation). While refuting reincarnation, the Saadia Gaon further states that Jews who hold to reincarnation have adopted non-Jewish beliefs. By no means do all Jews today believe in reincarnation, but belief in reincarnation is not uncommon among many Jews, including Orthodox. Most Orthodox siddurim (prayerbooks) have a prayer asking for forgiveness for one's sins that one may have committed in this gilgul or a previous one.&lt;ref&gt;New World Encyclopedia: Reincarnation http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Reincarnation&lt;/ref&gt;

Other well-known rabbis who are reincarnationists include Rabbi Yonassan Gershom, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, Talmud scholar Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, Rabbi DovBer Pinson, Rabbi David M. Wexelman, Rabbi Zalman Schachter,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sytekcom.com/rooster/bta-faq1.html&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. Reincarnation is cited by authoritative biblical commentators, including Ramban (Nachmanides), Menachem Recanti and Rabbenu Bachya.

Among the many volumes of the holy Rabbi Yitzchak Luria (known as the &quot;Ari&quot;), most of which come downfrom the pen of his primary disciple, Rabbi Chaim Vital, are profound insights explaining issues related to reincarnation. His Shaar HaGilgulim, &quot;The Gates of Reincarnation&quot;, is a book devoted exclusively to the subject of reincarnation in Judaism.

===Christianity===
{{main|Christian eschatology}}
[[Mainstream Christianity]] professes belief in the [[Nicene Creed]], and [[English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use]] include the phrase: &quot;We look for the [[resurrection of the dead]], and the life of the [[world to come]]&quot;. ''Christian eschatology'' is concerned with [[death]], an [[intermediate state]], [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]], [[Hell]], the [[Second Coming of Christ]], the ''resurrection of the dead'', a [[rapture]], a [[tribulation]], the [[Millennium]], [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]], the [[last judgment]], a new heaven and a [[The New Earth|new earth]], and the ultimate consummation of all of God's purposes. [[eschatology|Eschatological]] passages are found in many places, especially [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Olivet discourse|Matthew 24]], [[The Sheep and the Goats|Matthew 25]], and the [[Book of Revelation]].

====In Scripture====
When questioned by the [[Sadducees]] about the [[resurrection of the dead]] (in a context relating to who ones spouse would be if one had been married several times in life), [[Jesus]] said that marriage will be irrelevant after the resurrection as the resurrected will be (at least in this respect) like the angels in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2022:23-33;&amp;version=47; Matthew 22:23-33]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus also maintained that the time would come when the dead would hear the voice of the [[Son of God]], and all who were in the tombs would come out, the faithful to the resurrection of life, and the unfaithful to the resurrection of [[divine Judgment|judgment]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.cc/john/5-29.htm; John 5:29]&lt;/ref&gt;.  According to the [[Gospel of Matthew]], at the death of Jesus tombs were opened, and at [[Resurrection of Jesus|his resurrection]] many [[saints]] who had died emerged from their tombs and went into &quot;the holy city&quot;, presumably [[New Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2027:50-54;&amp;version=47; Matthew 27:50-54]&lt;/ref&gt; No other New Testament account includes this event.

'''The Last Day''': Jesus compared the [[Kingdom of God|kingdom of heaven]], over which He rules, to a net which was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind. When it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into vessels but threw away the bad. So it will be at the close of the age also known as the Last Day. The angels will separate the evil from the [[righteous]] and throw them into [[Hell in Christian beliefs|the furnace of unquenchable fire]]. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their [[God the Father|Father]].

====The Early Church: 1st century====
[[Image:Domenico Beccafumi 056.jpg|right|thumb|[[Domenico Beccafumi]]'s ''Inferno'':  a Christian vision of hell]]
The author of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] recounts the story of [[Lazarus and Dives|Lazarus and the rich man]], which shows people in Hades awaiting the resurrection either in comfort or torment. The author of the [[Book of Revelation]] writes about God and the angels versus [[Satan]] and [[demons]] in an epic battle at the end of times when all souls are judged.  There is mention of ghostly bodies of past prophets, and the [[transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]].

====The Early Church: 2nd and 3rd century====
The non-canonical [[Acts of Paul and Thecla]] speak of the efficacy of prayer for the dead, so that they might be &quot;translated to a state of happiness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/thecla.html Acts of Paul and Thecla] 8:5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hippolytus of Rome]] pictures Hades as a place where the righteous dead, awaiting in the [[bosom of Abraham]] their resurrection, rejoice at their future prospect, while the unrighteous are tormented at the sight of the &quot;[[Lake of fire|lake of unquenchable fire]]&quot; into which they are destined to be cast.

====The Early Church: 4th and 5th century====
Gregory of Nyssa discusses the long-before believed possibility of purification of souls after death.&lt;ref&gt;He wrote that a person &quot;may afterward in a quite different manner be very much interested in what is better, when, ''after his departure out of the body'', he gains knowledge of the difference between virtue and vice and finds that he is not able to partake of divinity until he has been ''purged of the filthy contagion in his soul by the purifying fire''&quot; (emphases added) - Sermon on the Dead, AD 382, quoted in [http://www.catholic.com/library/Roots_of_Purgatory.asp The Roots of Purgatory]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] counters [[Pelagius]], arguing that [[original sin]] means that the unbaptized go to hell, including infants, albeit with less suffering than is experienced by those guilty of actual sins.

====Medieval Christianity====
Pope Gregory I repeats the concept, articulated over a century earlier by [[Gregory of Nyssa]] that the saved suffer purification after death, in connection with which he wrote of &quot;purgatorial flames&quot;.
The noun &quot;purgatorium&quot; (Latin: place of cleansing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/purgatory|&quot;purgatory.&quot;] The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Columbia University Press., 2003. Answers.com 06 Jun. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;) is used for the first time to describe a state of painful purification of the saved after life. The same word in adjectival form (''purgatorius -a -um'', cleansing), which appears also in non-religious writing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2339625 Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; was already used by Christians such as Augustine of Hippo and [[Pope Gregory I]] to refer to an after-death cleansing.

====Swedenborg and the Enlightenment====
During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], theologians and philosophers presented various philosophies and beliefs. A notable example is [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] who wrote some 18 theological works which describe in detail the nature of the afterlife according to his claimed spiritual experiences, the most famous of which is [[Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg)|''Heaven and Hell'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/HH.html Swedenborg, E. ‘’Heaven and its Wonders and Hell. From Things Heard and Seen’’ (Swedenborg Foundation, 1946)]&lt;/ref&gt; His report of life there covers a wide range of topics, such as [[marriage]] in heaven (where all [[angels]] are married), children in heaven (where they are raised by angel parents), [[time]] and [[space]] in heaven (there are none), the after-death awakening process in the World of Spirits (a place halfway between Heaven and Hell and where people first wake up after death), the allowance of a free will choice between Heaven or Hell (as opposed to being sent to either one by God), the [[eternity]] of Hell (one could leave but would never want to), and that all angels or devils were once people on earth.

On the other hand, the enlightenment produced more rationalist philosophies such as [[deism]]. Many deist freethinkers held that belief in an afterlife with reward and punishment was a necessity of reason and good moral

====Seventh-day Adventists====
The Seventh-day Adventist Church, teaches that the first death, or death brought about by living on a planet with sinful conditions (sickness, old age, accident, etc.) is a sleep of the soul.  Adventists believe that the body + the breath of God = a living soul.  Like Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists use key phrases from the Bible, such as &quot;For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten&quot; (Eccl. 9:5 KJV).  Adventists also point to the fact that the wage of sin is death and God alone is [[immortality|immortal]].  Adventists believe God will grant eternal life to the redeemed who are resurrected at Jesus' second coming.  Until then, all those who have died are &quot;asleep.&quot;  When Jesus the Christ, who is the Word and the Bread of Life, comes a second time, the righteous will be raised incorruptible and will be taken in the clouds to meet their Lord.  The righteous will live in heaven for a thousand years (the millennium) where they will sit with God in judgment over the unredeemed and the fallen angels.  During the time the redeemed are in heaven, the Earth will be devoid of human and animal inhabitation.  Only the fallen angels will be left alive. The second resurrection is of the unrighteous, when Jesus brings the New Jerusalem down from heaven to relocate to Earth.  Jesus will call to life all those who are unrighteous.  Satan and his angels will convince the unrighteous to surround the city, but hell fire and brimstone will fall from heaven and consume them, thus cleansing Earth of all sin.  The universe will be then free from sin forever.  This is called the second death.  On the new earth God will provide an eternal home for all the redeemed and a perfect environment for everlasting life, where Eden will be restored.  The great controversy will be ended and sin will be no more.  God will reign in perfect harmony forever.(Rom. 6:23; 1 Tim. 6:15, 16; Eccl. 9:5, 6; Ps. 146:3, 4; John 11:11-14; Col. 3:4; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; 1 Thess. 4:13-17; John 5:28, 29; Rev. 20:1-10; Rev. 20; 1 Cor. 6:2, 3; Jer. 4:23-26; Rev. 21:1-5; Mal. 4:1; Eze. 28:18, 19; 2 Peter 3:13; Isa. 35; 65:17-25; Matt. 5:5; Rev. 21:1-7; 22:1-5; 11:15.)&lt;ref&gt;White, E.G. (1858). ''The great controversy''. Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald Publishing Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Afterlife in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormonism)====
[[Joseph F. Smith]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] presents an elaborate vision of the Afterlife. It is revealed as the scene of an extensive missionary effort by righteous spirits to redeem those still in darkness - a spirit prison or &quot;hell&quot; where the spirits of the dead remain until judgment. It is divided into two parts: Spirit Prison and Paradise. Together these are also known as the Spirit World (also Abraham's Bosom; see Luke 16:19-25). They believe that Christ visited spirit prison (1 Peter 3:18-20) and opened the gate for those who repent to cross over to Paradise. ''&quot;--- what Jesus’ immortal spirit did after His death and before His Resurrection is a mystery to all but the Latter-day Saints ---&quot; (Elder Spencer J. Condie, Liahona, -Church magazine – July, 2003)  &quot;- - - unto the wicked he did not go, and among the ungodly and the unrepentant - -  his voice was not raised. - -  But behold, from among the righteous, He organized His forces and appointed messengers ...&quot; (D&amp;C 138:20, 30–32). &quot;Christ opened the doors of hell to missionary work among the dead ...&quot; (H. Donl Peterson, “I Have a Question,” Ensign, Apr. 1986, 36–38).'' This is similar to the [[Harrowing of Hell]] doctrine of some mainstream Christian faiths. ''(citation needed)'' Both Spirit Prison and Paradise are temporary according to Latter-day Saint beliefs. After the resurrection, spirits are assigned &quot;permanently&quot; to three degrees of heavenly glory––Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial––(1 Cor 15:44-42; Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76) or are cast with Satan into Outer Darkness. (See Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76.)

====Salvation, faith and merit from ancient to modern Christianity====
Most Christians deny that entry into Heaven can be properly earned, rather it is a gift that is solely God's to give through his unmerited grace. This belief follows the theology of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]]: ''For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God, not by works, so that no one can boast.'' The [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]], [[Thomist]], [[Martin Luther|Lutheran]], and [[Calvinist]] theological traditions all emphasize the necessity of God's undeserved grace for salvation, and reject so-called [[Pelagianism]], which would make man earn salvation through good works. Not all Christian sects accept this doctrine, leading many controversies on grace and [[free will]], and the idea of [[predestination]]. In particular, the belief that heaven is a reward for good behavior is a common folk belief in Christian societies, even among members of churches which reject that belief.

Christian theologians [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] wrote that the saved in heaven will delight in the suffering of the damned. Hell, however, does not fit modern, humanitarian concepts of punishment because it cannot deter the unbeliever nor rehabilitate the damned, this however, does not affect the Christian belief which places Biblical teaching above the ideas of society. Some Christian believers have come to downplay the punishment of hell. [[Universalists]] teach that salvation is for all. Jehovah's Witnesses and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], though they have among the strictest rules on how to conduct their lives, teach that sinners are destroyed rather than tortured forever. John 3:16 says that only those that accept Jesus will be given eternal life, so the people that do not accept him cannot burn in hell for eternity because Jesus has not given them eternal life, instead it says they will perish.

====The dead as Angels in Heaven====
In American pop culture depictions of Heaven, particularly in vintage cartoons such as those by [[Looney Toons]] in the mid-20th century, the [[Soul (spirit)|souls]] of virtuous people ascend to Heaven and are converted into [[angels]]. However, this is not in accordance with the orthodox Christian theology. Christianity depicts a sharp distinction between ''angels'', divine beings created by God before the creation of humanity and are used as messengers, and ''saints'', the souls of humans who have received immortality from the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ of Nazareth, who dwell in Heaven [[Beatific Vision|with God]].

====Universalists====
Some sects, such as the Universalists, believe in [[universalism]] which holds that all people will eventually be rewarded according to their good or bad deeds, but they themselves will be saved regardless.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=1Cr&amp;c=3&amp;v=15&amp;t=KJV#comm/13&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] occasionally use the terms &quot;afterlife&quot; and &quot;hereafter&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Hereafter—Where Will It Be?&quot;, ''The Watchtower, January 1, 2000, page 3, [http://www.watchtower.org/e/20001001/article_01.htm Read online]&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to any hope for the dead, but they understand [[Ecclesiastes]] [http://watchtower.org/e/bible/ec/chapter_009.htm#bk5 9:5] to preclude common views of afterlife:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they any more have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jehovah's Witnesses believe that death is the price for sinning.&lt;ref&gt;''Reasoning From the Scriptures'' pp 168-175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watchtower.org/library/w/2002/7/15/article_02.htm Jehovah's Witnesses website on Hell]&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals judged by God to be wicked, such as in the [[Great Flood]] or at [[Armageddon]], are given no hope of an afterlife. After Armageddon there will be a resurrection in the flesh&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2024:15;&amp;version=9; Acts 24:15 KJV]&lt;/ref&gt; of &quot;both righteous and unrighteous&quot; dead (but not the &quot;wicked&quot;), based on Acts 24:15. Survivors of Armageddon and those who are resurrected are then to gradually restore earth to a paradise.&lt;ref&gt;''Insight on the Scriptures'' vol. 2 pp 574-6&lt;/ref&gt; After Armageddon, unrepentant sinners  are punished with eternal death (non-existence).

====Modern Orthodox Christianity====
The beliefs typical to modern Orthodox Christian Churches have not diverted from the old Orthodox Christian Churches. This is the teaching that, &quot;after the soul leaves the body, it journeys to the abode of the dead ([[Hades in Christianity|Hades]]). There are exceptions, such as the [[Theotokos]] (the virgin [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]), who was borne by the angels directly into heaven. As for the rest, we must remain in this condition of waiting. Because some have a prevision of the glory to come and others foretaste their suffering, the state of waiting is called &quot;[[Particular Judgment]]&quot;. [[Second Coming of Christ|When Christ returns]], the soul rejoins its risen body to be judged by Him in the [[Last judgment]]. The 'good and faithful servant' will inherit eternal life, the unfaithful with the unbeliever will spend eternity in hell. Their sins and their unbelief will torture them as fire.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Azkoul [http://www.ocf.org/OrthodoxPage/reading/ortho_cath.html ''What Are the Differences Between Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Catholic Church====
The Catholic conception of the afterlife teaches after the body dies, the soul is judged, the righteous and free of sin enter Heaven. However, those who die in unrepented [[mortal sin]] go to hell. In the 1990s, the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] defined hell not as punishment imposed on the sinner but rather as the sinner's self-exclusion from God. Unlike other Christian groups, the Catholic Church teaches that those who die in a state of grace, but still carry [[venial sin]] go to a place called [[Purgatory]] where they undergo purification to enter Heaven.

===Islam===
{{Main|Barzakh|Akhirah}}
The Islamic belief in the afterlife as stated in the [[Qur'an]] is descriptive. The [[Islam]]ic word for Paradise is [[jannah]] and  Hell is [[jahannam]]. [[Jannah]] and [[Jahannam]] both have different levels. [[Jannah]] possesses 8 gates while [[Jahannam]] possess 7 deep terrible layers. Individuals will arrive at both everlasting homes during [[Judgment Day]], which commences after the Angel [[Israfel]] blows the trumpet the second time. Their level of comfort while in the grave depends wholly on their level of [[Iman]] or faith in the one [[God]], or [[Allah]], equivalent in Arabic. In order for one to achieve proper, firm and healthy [[Iman]] one must practice righteous deeds or else his level of [[Iman]] chokes and shrinks and eventually can wither away if one does not practice [[Islam]] long enough, hence the depth of practicing Islam is good deeds. One may also acquire [[Tasbih]] and recite the names of Allah in such manner as &quot;SubahannAllah&quot; or [[Glory]] be to [[Allah]] in [[Arabic]] over and over again to acquire good deeds. The levels in [[Jannah]] are 100 &lt;ref&gt;Saheeh Al-Bukhari&lt;/ref&gt; and 7 (?) for [[Jahannam]].

Islam teaches that the purpose of Man's entire creation is to worship the Creator of the Heavens and Earth - [[Allah]] (God in Arabic) alone that includes being kind to other human beings and life including bugs, Trees by not oppressing them.  Islam teaches that the life we live on Earth is nothing but a test for us and to determine each individual's ultimate abode be it punishment or [[Jannah]] in the afterlife, which is eternal and everlasting.

In the 20th century, discussions about the afterlife address the interconnection between human action and divine judgment, the need for moral rectitude, and the eternal consequences of human action in this life and world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e61?_hi=2&amp;_pos=1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{Main|Bahá'í teachings}}

The teachings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] state that the nature of the afterlife is beyond the nature of those living, just as an unborn fetus cannot understand the nature of the world outside of the [[womb]]. The [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í writings]] state that the soul is immortal and after death it will continue to progress until it attains [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|God's presence]]. In Bahá'í belief, souls in the afterlife will continue to retain their individuality and consciousness and will be able to recognize and communicate spiritually with other souls who they have made deep profound friendships with, such as their [[Marriage|spouses]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Peter | year = 2008 | title = An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith | publisher = Cambridge University Press | place = Cambridge | isbn=0-521-86251-5 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahá'í writings also state there are distinctions between souls in the afterlife, and that souls will recognize the worth of their own deeds and understand the consequences of their actions. It is explained that those souls that have turned toward God will experience gladness, while those who have lived in error will become aware of the opportunities they have lost. Also, in the Baha'i view, souls will be able to recognize the accomplishments of the souls that have reached the same level as themselves, but not those that have achieved a rank higher than them.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSmith&quot;/&gt;

==Indian religions==
===Hinduism===
[[Upanishads]] describe reincarnation, or [[punarjanma]] (see also: [[samsara]]). The [[Bhagavat Gita]], an important book for Hinduism, talks extensively about the afterlife. Here, the Lord [[Krishna]] says that just as a man discards his old clothes and wears new ones; similarly the soul discards the old body and takes on a new one. In Hinduism, the belief is that the body is but a shell, the soul inside is immutable and indestructible and takes on different lives in a cycle of birth and death. The end of this cycle is called &quot;Mukthi&quot; (Sanskrit: मुक्ति) and merging finally with God is &quot;[[Moksha]]&quot; (Sanskrit: मोक्ष) or salvation.

[[Garuda Purana]], a book solely deals with what happens to a person after death. The God of Death Yama sends his representatives to collect the soul from a person's body whenever he is due for death and they take the soul to Yama. A record of each person's timings &amp; deeds performed by him is kept in a ledger by Yama's assistant &quot;Chitragupta&quot;.

According to the Garuda Purana, a soul after leaving the body, travels through a very long &amp; dark tunnel towards South. This is why an oil lamp is lit and kept beside the head of the corpse, to light the dark tunnel and allow the soul to travel comfortably.

The soul, called &quot;[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]&quot; leaves the body and reincarnates itself according to the deeds or Karma performed by one in last birth. Re-birth would be in form of animals or other lower creatures if one performed bad Karmas and in human form in a good family with joyous lifetime if the person was good in last birth. In between the two births a human is also required to either face punishments for bad Karmas in &quot;naraka&quot; or hell or enjoy for the good karmas in &quot;svarga&quot; or heaven for good deeds. Whenever his or her punishments or rewards are over he or she is sent back to earth, also known as &quot;Mrityulok&quot; or World of Death. A person is merged with the God or ultimate power when he discharges only &amp; only good Karmas in last birth and the same is called as &quot;Moksha&quot; or &quot;Nirvana&quot;, which is the ultimate goal of a true Hindu.Atma (Soul) merges into &quot;Parmatma&quot; or the greatest soul.According to Bhagwadgita an &quot;Atma&quot; or soul never dies, what dies is the body only made of five elements - Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Sky. Soul is believed to be indestructible.None of the five elements can harm or influence it.Hinduism through Garuda Purana also describes in detail various types of &quot;Narkas&quot; or Hells where a person after death is punished for his bad Karmas and dealt with accordingly.

Hindus also believe in 'Karma'. 'Karma' is the accumulated sums of one's good or bad deeds. According to [[Hinduism]] the basic concept of Karma is 'As you sow, you shall reap'. So, if a person has lived a good life, they will be rewarded in the afterlife. Similarly their sum of bad deeds will be mirrored in their next life. Good 'Karma' brings good rewards and bad 'karmas' lead to bad results. There is no judgment here. People accumulate karma through their actions and even thoughts. In Bhagavad Gita when Arjuna hesitates to kill his kith and kin the lord reprimands him saying thus &quot;Do you believe that you are the doer of the action.  No. You are merely an instrument in MY hands.  Do you believe that the people in front of you are living? Dear Arjuna, they are already dead. As a kshatriya (warrior class) it is your duty to protect your people and land. If you fail to do your duty, then you are not adhering to dharmic principles.&quot;

===Buddhism===
Buddhists maintain that [[rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] takes place without an unchanging [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]] or soul passing from one form to another. The type of rebirth will be conditioned by the moral tone of the person's actions (kamma or [[karma]]). For example, where a person has committed harmful actions of body, speech and mind based on greed, hatred and delusion, rebirth in a lower realm, i.e. an animal, a [[ghost]] or a hell realm, is to be expected. On the other hand, where a person has performed skillful actions based on generosity, loving-kindness ([[metta]]), compassion and wisdom, rebirth in a happy realm, i.e. human or one of the many heavenly realms, can be expected.

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the [[Bardo Thodol|Tibetan Book of the Dead]] explains the intermediate state of humans between death and reincarnation. The deceased will find the bright light of wisdom, which shows a straightforward path to move upward and leave the cycle of reincarnation. There are various reasons why the deceased do not follow that light. Some had no briefing about the intermediate state in the former life. Others only used to follow their basic instincts like animals. And some have fear, which results from foul deeds in the former life or from insistent haughtiness. In the intermediate state the awareness is very flexible, so it is important to be virtuous, adopt a positive attitude, and avoid negative ideas. Ideas which are rising from subconsciousness can cause extreme tempers and cowing visions. In this situation they have to understand, that these manifestations are just reflections of the inner thoughts. No one can really hurt them, because they have no more material body. The deceased get help from different [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]s who show them the path to the bright light. The ones who do not follow the path after all will get hints for a better reincarnation. They have to release the things and beings on which or whom they still hang from the life before. It is recommended to choose a family where the parents trust in the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] and to reincarnate with the will to care for the welfare of all beings.

&quot;Life is cosmic energy of the universe and after death it merges in universe again and as the time comes to find the suitable  place for the entity died in the life condition it gets born. There are 10 life states of any life: Hell, hunger, anger, animality, rapture, humanity, learning, realization, bodhisatva and buddhahood. The life dies in which life condition it reborn in the same life condition.&quot;

===Sikhism===
[[Sikhs]] also believe in reincarnation. They believe that the soul belongs to the spiritual universe which has its origins in God. It is like a see-saw, the amount of good done in life will store up blessings, thus uniting with God. It needs to be clarified whether the ideal is union or link with 'Waheguru' (God) or merger in God (Hindu belief). Before the creation of the world, God was all by Himself, in a Self-absorbed state. In that state, God's Will, Naam or Attributes were not expressed, since they have relevance only in the created world. At next stage, universe was created. Since then God's Naam and Will have become expressed and creative functioning in the universe goes on. The suggested merger in God (Hindu belief)in this state involves virtually a reversion to the first state of God being Self-absorbed. This reversal would evidently be counter to the expressed Creative Will of God. So Sikhs believe in union as opposed to merger. A soul may need to live many lives before it is one with God. But there is more to it than this; there are four classes that are included in this belief. Above these four classes is God ''&quot;[[Waheguru]]&quot;'' and the soul can choose to stay with him it wishes, or take another step and go to its people and serve them. Below these four classes are non-humans such as plants and viruses. Souls move up and down according to their deeds, a good life and death moves them up to a higher class and a bad life and death results in going down a class.

==Zoroastrianism==
Zoroastrianism states that the ''urvan'', the disembodied spirit, lingers on earth for three days before departing downward to the kingdom of the dead that is ruled by Yima. For the three days that it rests on Earth, righteous souls sit at the head of their body, chanting the Ustavaiti Gathas with joy, while a wicked person sits at the head of the corpse, wails and recites the [[Yasna]]. Zoroastrianism states that for the righteous souls, a beautiful maiden, which is the personification of the soul's good thoughts, words and deeds, appears. For a wicked person, a very old, ugly, naked hag appears. After three nights, the soul of the wicked is taken by the demon [[Vizaresa]] (Vīzarəša), to Chinvat bridge, and is made to go to darkness ([[hell]]).

[[Jamshid|Yima]] is believed to have been the first [[king]] on earth to rule, as well as the first man to die. Inside of Yima's realm, the [[spirits]] live a shadowy existence, and are dependent on their own descendants which are still living on Earth. Their descendants are to satisfy their hunger and clothe them, through rituals done on earth.

Rituals which are done on the first three days are vital and important, as they protect the soul from evil powers and give it strength to reach the underworld. After three days, the soul crosses [[Chinvat bridge]] which is the [[Final Judgment]] of the soul. Rashnu and [[Sraosha]] are present at the final judgment. The list is expanded sometimes, and include [[Bahman|Vahman]] and [[Ahura Mazda|Ormazd]]. [[Rashnu]] is the [[yazata]] who holds the scales of justice. If the good deeds of the person outweigh the bad, the soul is worthy of paradise. If the bad deeds outweigh the good, the bridge narrows down to the width of a blade-edge, and a horrid hag pulls the soul in her arms, and takes it down to hell with her.

[[Misvan Gatu]] is the 'place of the mixed ones' where the souls lead a gray existence, lacking both joy and sorrow. A soul goes here if his/her good deeds and bad deeds are equal, and Rashnu's scale is equal.

==The Afterlife In Modern Studies==
Scientists, in general, either describe the universe and human beings without reference to a soul or to an afterlife, or tend to remain mute on the issue.  However, some studies deal directly with these issues in the belief that they can be proven or disproven, by using either the scientific method or other means.  

===Parapsychology===
{{Main|Parapsychology}}
{{See also|Near-death studies|Near death experience}}
A study conducted in 1901 by physician [[Duncan MacDougall (doctor)|Duncan MacDougall]] sought to measure the weight lost by a human when the soul &quot;departed the body&quot; upon death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Roach | first = Mary | title = Spook – Science Tackles the Afterlife | publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Co. | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-393-05962-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacDougall weighed dying patients in an attempt to prove that the soul was material, tangible and thus measurable. Although MacDougall's results varied considerably from &quot;21 grams&quot;, for some people this figure has become synonymous with the measure of a soul's mass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/religion/soulweight.asp Urban Legends] - Reference Page (Soul man).&lt;/ref&gt;  The title of the 2003 movie ''[[21 Grams]]'' is a reference to MacDougall's findings.

The [[Society for Psychical Research]] was founded in 1882 with the express intention of investigating phenomena relating to Spiritualism and the afterlife. Its members continue to conduct scientific research on the paranormal to this day. Some of the earliest attempts to apply [[scientific method]]s to the study of phenomena relating to an afterlife were conducted by this organization. Its earliest members included noted scientists like [[William Crookes]], and philosophers such as [[Henry Sidgwick]] and William James.

[[Joseph B. Rhine|J. B. Rhine]], who was critical in the early foundations of parapsychology as a laboratory science, was committed to finding scientific evidence for the spiritual existence of humans. Scientists who have worked in this area include [[Raymond Moody]], [[Susan Blackmore]], [[Charles Tart]], [[William James]], [[Ian Stevenson]], [[Michael Persinger]] and Pim van Lommel among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://profezie3m.altervista.org/archivio/TheLancet_NDE.htm Near-death experience in survivors of cardiac arrest: a prospective study in the Netherlands]&lt;/ref&gt;

After 25 years of parapsychological research, [[Susan Blackmore]] came to the conclusion that there is no empirical evidence for an afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Chapters/Kurtz.htm Skeptical Odysseys: Personal Accounts by the World’s Leading Paranormal Inquirers pp 85-94]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kurtz | first = Paul | title = Skeptical Odysseys: Personal Accounts by the World's Leading Paranormal Inquirers | publisher = Prometheus Books | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-57392-884-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, such as [[Francis Crick]] in 1994, have attempted a ‘scientific search for the soul’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Crick | first = Francis | title = The Astonishing Hypothesis – the Scientific Search for the Soul | publisher = Touchstone Books | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-684-80158-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Tipler]] has argued that [[physics]] can explain immortality, though such arguments are not [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] and thus do not qualify, in [[Karl Popper]]'s views, as science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tipler | first = Franl, J. | title = The Physics of Immortality – Modern Cosmology, God and the Resurrection of the Dead | publisher = Anchor | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-385-46799-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tart conducted research into [[out-of-body experiences]], or OBEs, that indicated the possibility that a person might be able to perceive targets at a distance removed from the physical body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.near-death.com/tart.html Charles Tart - out-of-body experiences and consciousness research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Later investigations have both corroborated and failed to corroborate &quot;out-of-body&quot; experiences transcending the confines of the brain.&lt;ref name=RingLawrence&gt;&quot;Further evidence for veridical perception during near-death experiences&quot;, Ring and Lawrence, Journal of Near-Death Studies Vol 11, Issue 4, p223-9.&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, a hospital placed an LED marquee above its patients’ beds which displayed a hidden message that could only be read if one were looking down from above. {{As of|2001}}, no one who claimed near-death experience or out-of-body experience within that hospital had reported having seen the hidden message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Alper | first = Matthew | title = The &quot;God&quot; Part of the Brain - a Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God | publisher = Rogue Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-9660367-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Penny Sartori, an intensive care nurse from [[Swansea]], published a book about near death experiences following 10 years of research. Sartori says that people who went through out-of-body experiences felt as if they floated above themselves and were able to accurately recount what had happened in the room even though their bodily eyes were closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7463606.stm | accessdate = 6 August 2008 | work=BBC News | title=Nurse writes book on near-death | date=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigation of the afterlife also includes the study of (among others) cases of [[haunting]], apparitions of the deceased (including, in some cases, information conveyed by those same apparitions), instrumental trans-communication (recording of paranormal voices on tape), and mediumship.&lt;ref&gt;David Fontana (2005): Is there an afterlife. A comprehensive overview of the evidence.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===

There is still the position, based on the philosophical question of [[Personal identity (philosophy)|personal identity]], termed [[open individualism]], and in some ways similar to the old belief of [[monopsychism]], that concludes that individual existence is illusory, and our consciousness continues existing after death in other conscious beings. Positions regarding existence after death was supported by some notable physicists such as [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and [[Freeman Dyson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolak | first = Daniel | title = I Am You: The Metaphysical Foundations for Global Ethics | publisher = Springer | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-4020-2999-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain problems arise with the idea of a particular person continuing after death. Van Inwagen, in his argument regarding resurrection, notes that the materialist must have some sort of physical continuity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/.../van-inwagen-peter/.../Resurrection.doc|work=&quot;I Look for the Resurrection of the Dead and the Life of the World to Come&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Hick also raises some questions regarding personal identity in his book, &quot;Death and Eternal Life,&quot; using an interesting example of a person ceasing to exist in one place while an exact replica appears in another. If the replica had all the same experiences, traits, and physical appearances of the first person, we would all attribute the same identity to the second, according to Hick.

'''Astrometry''' is the branch of [[astronomy]] that relates to precise measurements and explanations of the positions and movements of [[star]]s and other celestial bodies. Although once thought of as an esoteric field with little useful application for the future,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} the information obtained by astrometric measurements is now very important in contemporary research into the [[kinematics]] and physical origin of our [[Solar System]] and our [[Galaxy]], the [[Milky Way]].

==History==

The history of astrometry is linked to the history of [[star catalogue]]s, which gave astronomers reference points for objects in the sky so they could track their movements. This can be dated back to [[Hipparchus]], who around 190 BC used the catalogue of his predecessors [[Timocharis]] and [[Aristillus]] to discover the earth’s [[precession]]. In doing so, he also developed the brightness scale still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;Walter, Hans G. (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  Hipparchus compiled a catalogue with at least 850 stars and their positions.&lt;ref&gt;p. 109, ''Star maps: history, artistry, and cartography'', Nick Kanas, Springer, 2007, ISBN 0387716688.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hipparchus's successor, [[Ptolemy]], included a catalogue of 1,022 stars in his work the ''[[Almagest]]'', giving their location, coordinates, and brightness.&lt;ref&gt;p. 110, Kanas 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi]] carried out observations on the stars and described their positions, [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]]s and [[star color]], and gave drawings for each constellation, in his ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]''.   [[Ibn Yunus]] observed more than 10,000 entries for the sun's position for many years using a large [[astrolabe]] with a diameter of nearly 1.4 metres. His observations on [[eclipse]]s were still used centuries later in [[Simon Newcomb]]'s investigations on the motion of the moon, while his other observations inspired [[Laplace]]'s ''Obliquity of the Ecliptic'' and ''Inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn''.{{Clarify|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1895AJ.....15..113L Great Inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 15th century, the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] astronomer [[Ulugh Beg]] compiled the ''[[Zij-i-Sultani]]'', in which he catalogued 1,019 stars.  Like the earlier catalogs of Hipparchus and Ptolemy, Ulugh Beg's catalogue is estimated to have been precise to within approximately 20 [[minutes of arc]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 49, &quot;Astrometry&quot;, ''History of astronomy: an encyclopedia'', John Lankford, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997, ISBN 081530322X.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, [[Tycho Brahe]] used improved instruments, including large [[mural instrument]]s, to measure star positions more accurately than previously, with a precision of 15–35 [[Minute_of_arc#Symbols and abbreviations|arcsec]].&lt;ref&gt;pp. 2–3, ''Fundamentals of astrometry'', Jean Kovalevsky and P. Kenneth Seidelmann, Cambridge University Press, 2004, ISBN 0521642167.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]] measured the [[right ascension]] of the stars at the [[Istanbul observatory of Taqi al-Din]] using the &quot;observational clock&quot; he invented.&lt;ref name=Tekeli&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | first = Sevim | last = Tekeli | title = Taqi al-Din | year = 1997 | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures | publisher = [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] | isbn = 0792340663 | url = http://www.springer.com/philosophy/philosophy+of+sciences/book/978-1-4020-4425-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When telescopes became commonplace, [[setting circles]] sped measurements

[[James Bradley]] first tried to measure [[stellar parallax]]es in 1729. The stellar movement proved too insignificant for his [[telescope]], but he instead discovered the [[aberration of light]] and the [[nutation]] of the Earth’s axis. His cataloguing of 3222 stars was refined in 1807 by [[Friedrich Bessel]], the father of modern astrometry. He made the first measurement of stellar parallax: 0.3 [[Minute_of_arc#Symbols and abbreviations|arcsec]] for the [[binary star]] [[61 Cygni]].

Being very difficult to measure, only about 60 stellar parallaxes had been obtained by the end of the 19th century, mostly by use of the [[filar micrometer]].  [[Astrograph]]s using astronomical [[photographic plate]]s sped the process in the early 20th century.  Automated plate-measuring machines&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1107461 CERN paper on plate measuring machine] USNO StarScan&lt;/ref&gt; and more sophisticated computer technology of the 1960s allowed more efficient compilation of [[star catalogue]]s. In the 1980s, [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs) replaced photographic plates and reduced optical uncertainties to one milliarcsecond.  This technology made astrometry less expensive, opening the field to an amateur audience.

In 1989, the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Hipparcos]] satellite took astrometry into orbit, where it could be less affected by mechanical forces of the Earth and optical distortions from its atmosphere. Operated from 1989 to 1993, Hipparcos measured large and small angles on the sky with much greater precision than any previous optical telescopes. During its 4-year run, the positions, parallaxes, and [[proper motions]] of 118,218 stars were determined with an unprecedented degree of accuracy. A new “[[Hipparcos Catalogue|Tycho catalog]]” drew together a database of 1,058,332 to within 20-30 [[Minute_of_arc#Symbols and abbreviations|mas]] (milliarcseconds). Additional catalogues were compiled for the 23,882 double/multiple stars and 11,597 variable stars also analyzed during the Hipparcos mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Today, the catalogue most often used is [[Star catalogue#USNO-B1.0|USNO-B1.0]], an all-sky catalogue that tracks proper motions, positions, magnitudes and other characteristics for over one billion stellar objects. During the past 50 years, 7,435 [[Schmidt camera]] plates were used to complete several sky surveys that make the data in USNO-B1.0 accurate to within 0.2 arcsec.&lt;ref&gt;Kovalevsky, Jean (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Apart from the fundamental function of providing [[astronomer]]s with a [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] to report their observations in, astrometry is also fundamental for fields like [[celestial mechanics]], [[stellar dynamics]] and [[galactic astronomy]]. In [[observational astronomy]], astrometric techniques help identify stellar objects by their unique motions. It is instrumental for keeping [[time]], in that [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] is basically the [[International Atomic Time|atomic time]] synchronized to [[Earth]]'s rotation by means of exact observations. Astrometry is also involved in creating the [[cosmic distance ladder]] because it is used to establish [[parallax]] distance estimates for stars in the [[Milky Way]].

[[Image:Solar system barycenter.svg|thumb|right|200px|Motion of [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycenter]] of solar system relative to the Sun.]]
Astrometry has also been used to support claims of [[Methods_of_detecting_extrasolar_planets#Astrometry|extrasolar planet detection]] by measuring the displacement the proposed planets cause in their parent star's apparent position on the sky, due to their mutual orbit around the center of mass of the system.  Although, as of 2009, none of the extrasolar planets detected by ground-based astrometry has been verified in subsequent studies, astrometry is expected to be more accurate in space missions that are not affected by the distorting effects of the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Nature  462, 705 (2009) 8 December 2009 doi:10.1038/462705a&lt;/ref&gt; NASA's planned [[Space Interferometry Mission]] ([[SIM PlanetQuest]]) will utilize astrometric techniques to detect [[terrestrial planets]] orbiting 200 or so of the nearest [[Solar analog|solar-type stars]], and the European Space Agency's GAIA (due to launch in 2012), which will be applying astrometric techniques in its stellar census.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaSC/120377_index_0_m.html] ESA - Space Science - Gaia overview&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrometric measurements are used by [[astrophysicist]]s to constrain certain models in [[celestial mechanics]].  By measuring the velocities of [[pulsar]]s, it is possible to put a limit on the [[asymmetry]] of [[supernova]] explosions. Also, astrometric results are used to determine the distribution of [[dark matter]] in the galaxy.

Astronomers use astrometric techniques for the tracking of [[near-Earth objects]]. Astrometry is responsible for the detection of many record-breaking solar system objects. To find such objects astrometrically, astronomers use telescopes to survey the sky and large-area cameras to take pictures at various determined intervals. By studying these images, they can detect solar system objects by their movements relative to the background stars, which remain fixed. Once a movement per unit time is observed, astronomers compensate for the amount of parallax caused by the earth’s motion during this time and the heliocentric distance to this object is calculated. Then, using this distance and other photographs, more information about the object, such as parallax, proper motion, and the semimajor axis of its orbit, can be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Statistics ==

A fundamental aspect of astrometry is error correction. Various factors introduce errors into the measurement of stellar positions, including atmospheric conditions, imperfections in the instruments and errors by the observer or the measuring instruments. Many of these errors can be reduced by various techniques, such as through instrument improvements and compensations to the data. The results are then [[Error analysis|analyzed]] using [[statistics|statistical methods]] to compute data estimates and error ranges.

{{Ancient Greek religion}}

In [[Greek mythology]] '''Athena''' or '''Athene''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|n|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|n|iː}}; [[Attic Greek|Attic]]: {{polytonic|Ἀθηνᾶ}}, ''Athēnā'' or {{polytonic|Ἀθηναία}}, ''Athēnaia''; [[Epic Greek|Epic]]: {{Polytonic|Ἀθηναίη}}, ''Athēnaiē''; [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]]: {{polytonic|Ἀθήνη}}, ''Athēnē''; [[Doric Greek|Doric]]: {{polytonic|Ἀθάνα}}, ''Athana''), also referred to as '''Pallas Athena/Athene''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|p|æ|l|ə|s}}; Παλλὰς Ἀθηνᾶ; Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη), is the goddess of wisdom, civilization, warfare, strength, strategy, female arts, crafts, justice and skill. [[Minerva]], Athena's Roman incarnation, embodies similar attributes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deacy, Susan 2001&quot;&gt;Deacy, Susan, and Alexandra Villing. ''Athena in the Classical World''. Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Athena is also a shrewd companion of [[hero]]es and the [[goddess]] of [[hero]]ic endeavour. She is the [[virgin]] patron of [[Athens]]. The Athenians built the [[Parthenon]] on the Acropolis of her namesake city, Athens, in her honour (Athena Parthenos).&lt;ref name=&quot;Deacy, Susan 2001&quot;/&gt;

Athena's veneration as the patron of Athens seems to have existed from the earliest times, and was so persistent that archaic myths about her were recast to adapt to cultural changes. In her role as a protector of the city (''[[polis]]''), many people throughout the Greek world worshiped Athena as ''Athena Polias'' (Ἀθηνᾶ Πολιάς &quot;Athena of the city&quot;). [[Athens]] and Athena bear etymologically connected names.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Whether the goddess was named after the city or the city after the goddess is an ancient dispute&quot; (Burkert 1985:139)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin traditions==
The Greek philosopher [[Plato]] (429–347 BC) identified her with the [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] deity [[Neith]], the war goddess and huntress deity of the Egyptians since the ancient Pre-Dynastic period, who was also identified with [[weaving]]. This is sensible, as some Greeks identified Athena's birthplace, in certain mythological renditions, as being beside Libya's Triton River.&lt;ref&gt;Aeschylus ''Eumenides''. 292–293. Cf. the tradition that she was the daughter of Neilos: see, e.g. Clement of Alexandria ''Protr.'' 2.28.2; Cicero, ''[[De Natura Deorum]]''. 3.59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Classicist Martin Bernal created the &quot;Black Athena Theory&quot; to explain this associated origin by claiming that the conception of [[Neith]] was brought to Greece from Egypt, along with &quot;an enormous number of features of civilization and culture in the third and second millennia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;M. . Bernal, ''Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization'' (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1987), 21, 51–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patroness==
Athena as the goddess of philosophy became an aspect of the cult in Classical Greece during the late 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''Greek Religion'' 1985:VII &quot;Philosophical Religion&quot; treats these transformations.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the patroness of various [[crafts]], especially [[weaving]], as ''Athena Ergane''; the metalwork of weapons also fell under her patronage. She led battles (''[[Athena Promachos]]'' or the warrior maiden ''Athena Parthenos'')&lt;ref name=&quot;C.J. Herrington 1955&quot;&gt;C.J. Herrington, ''Athena Parthenos and Athena Polias''. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; as the disciplined, strategic side of war, in contrast to her brother [[Ares]], the patron of violence, bloodlust and slaughter — &quot;the raw force of war&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Darmon.&quot;Athena and Ares&quot;. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Athena's wisdom includes the cunning intelligence (''metis'') of such figures as [[Odysseus]]. Not only was this version of Athena the opposite of Ares in combat, it was also the polar opposite of the serene earth goddess version of the deity, ''Athena Polias''.&lt;ref name=&quot;C.J. Herrington 1955&quot;/&gt;

Athena appears in Greek mythology as the patron and helper of many heroes, including [[Odysseus]], [[Jason]], and [[Heracles]]. In [[Classical Greek]] myths, she never consorts with a lover, nor does she ever marry,&lt;ref&gt;S. Goldhill. ''Reading Greek Tragedy''(Aesch.Eum.737). Cambrdige: Cambridge University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; earning the title ''Athena Parthenos''. A remnant of archaic myth depicts her as the adoptive mother of [[Erechtheus]]/[[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]] by the foiled rape by [[Hephaestus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 3.14.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Other variants relate that the serpent who accompanied Athena, also called Erichthonius, was born to [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] when the rape failed and the semen landed on Gaia, impregnating her, and that Gaia gave him to Athena after bearing him.

Though Athena was a goddess of war strategy, she disliked fighting without purpose and preferred to use wisdom to settle predicaments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loewen&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Loewen|first=Nancy|title=Athena|isbn=0736800484}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess only encouraged fighting for a reasonable cause or to resolve conflict. As patron of Athens she fought in the Trojan war on the side of the Achaeans.&lt;!--any citation for the following psychology? not just because she lost the beauty contest, but because she wanted to punish the Trojans for abducting Helen.--&gt;

==Mythology== 
===Birth===
[[File:NAMA Diosa Hera.JPG|thumb|upright|Image from the [[temple of Athena]] at [[Mycenae]], c. 625 BC ([[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]])]]
In ''The Greek Myths'' (8.a, ff.), Robert Graves narrates early myths about the birth of Athena, &quot;coming to Greece by way of Crete&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Graves notes Cretan pottery finds that &quot;suggest a Libyan immigration into Crete as early as 4000 B.C.&quot; (Graves 1960:45).&lt;/ref&gt; Hesiod (c. 700 BC) relates that Athena was a [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenous]] daughter of [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], ''wisdom'' or ''knowledge'', a [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]].  Other variants relate that, although Metis was of an earlier generation of the Titans, Zeus became her consort when his cult gained dominance. In order to avoid a prophecy made when that change occurred, that any offspring of his union with Metis would be greater than he, Zeus swallowed Metis to prevent her from having offspring, but she already was pregnant with Athena. Metis gave birth to Athena and nurtured her inside Zeus until Zeus complained of headaches and called for Hephaestus to split open his head with his smithing tools. Athena burst forth from his forehead fully armed with weapons given by her mother. She famously wields the [[thunderbolt]] and the [[Aegis]], which she and [[Zeus]] share exclusively.

Plato, in ''[[Cratylus]]'' (407B)  gave the etymology of her name as signifying &quot;the mind of god&quot;, ''theou noesis''. The Christian apologist of the 2nd century [[Justin Martyr]] takes issue with those pagans who erect at springs images of [[Persephone|Kore]], whom he interprets as Athena:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;They said that Athena was the daughter of Zeus not from intercourse, but when the god had in mind the making of a world through a word (''[[logos]]'') his first thought was Athena&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Justin, ''Apology'' 64.5. quoted in Robert McQueen Grant, ''Gods and the One God'', vol 1 :155, who observes that it is [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] &quot;who similarly identifies Athena with &quot;forethought&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Milton's ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' interprets this myth as a model for the birth of Sin from the head of Satan.&lt;ref&gt;B.Spaanstra-Polak,&quot;The Birth of Athena: An Emblematic Representation&quot;-''Album Amicorum J.G. van Gelder'', ed. J.Bruyn, J. Emmens, et al. The Hague:Martinus Nijhoff, 1973.293-305.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Olympian version===
[[File:Amphora birth Athena Louvre F32.jpg|thumb|leftr|After he swallowed her pregnant mother, [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], Athena is &quot;born&quot; from Zeus' forehead as he grasps the clothing of [[Eileithyia]] on the right —[[black-figure pottery|black-figured]] [[amphora]], 550–525 BC, Louvre.]]

Although at Mycenaean [[Knossos]] Athena appears before Zeus does—in [[Linear B]], as ''a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja'', &quot;Mistress Athena&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Knossos tablet V 52 ([[John Chadwick]], ''The Mycenaean World'' [Cambridge] 1976:88 fig 37.) ''Athana Potnia'' does not appear at Mycenaean [[Pylos]], where the mistress goddess is ''ma-te-re te-i-ja'', ''Mater [[Theia]], literally &quot;Mother Goddess&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;—in the Classical [[Olympian gods|Olympian pantheon]], Athena was remade as the favorite daughter of Zeus, born fully armed from his forehead.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Ellen Harrison's famous characterisation of this myth-element as, &quot;a desperate theological expedient to rid an earth-born Kore of her matriarchal conditions&quot; has never been refuted (Harrison 1922:302).&lt;/ref&gt;  The story of her birth comes in several versions. In the one most commonly cited, Zeus lay with Metis, the goddess of crafty thought and wisdom, but he immediately feared the consequences. It had been prophesied that Metis would bear children more powerful than the sire,&lt;ref&gt;Compare the prophecy concerning [[Thetis]].&lt;/ref&gt; even Zeus himself. In order to forestall these dire consequences, after lying with Metis, Zeus &quot;put her away inside his own belly;&quot; he &quot;swallowed her down all of a sudden.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'' 890ff and 924ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was too late: Metis had already conceived.

Eventually Zeus experienced an enormous headache; [[Prometheus]], [[Hephaestus]], [[Hermes]], [[Ares]],or [[Palaemon]] (depending on the sources examined) cleaved Zeus's head with the double-headed [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[axe]], the ''[[labrys]]''. Athena leaped from Zeus's head, fully grown and armed, with a shout— &quot;and pealed to the broad sky her clarion cry of war. And Ouranos trembled to hear, and Mother Gaia...&quot; ([[Pindar]], ''Seventh Olympian Ode''). Plato, in the ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'', attributes the cult of Athena to the culture of [[Crete]], introduced, he thought, from Libya during the dawn of Greek culture.

Classical myths thereafter note that [[Hera]] was so annoyed at Zeus producing a child that she conceived and bore [[Hephaestus]] by [[parthenogenesis|herself]].

===Other origin tales===
Fragments attributed by the Christian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] to the semi-legendary [[Phoenicia]]n historian [[Sanchuniathon]], which Eusebius thought had been written before the [[Trojan war]], make Athena instead the daughter of [[Cronus]], a king of [[Byblos]] who visited 'the inhabitable world' and bequeathed [[Attica]] to Athena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/af/af01.htm |title='&amp;#39;Sacred Texts: Ancient Fragments'&amp;#39;, ed. and trans. I. P. Cory, 1832: &quot;The Theology of the Phœnicians from Sanchoniatho&quot; |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanchuniathon's account would make Athena the sister of Zeus and Hera, not Zeus' daughter.

===Pallas Athena===
The major competing tradition regarding Athena's parentage involves some of her more mysterious [[epithet]]s: Pallas, as in Ancient Greek {{polytonic|Παλλάς Άθήνη}} (also Pallantias) and Tritogeneia (also Trito, Tritonis, Tritoneia, Tritogenes). A distant archaic separate entity named [[Pallas]] is invoked —whether male or female does not seem to have been remembered by literate Greeks — as Athena's father, sister, foster sister, companion, or opponent in battle. Pallas is often a nymph, a daughter of Triton(a sea god), and a childhood friend of Athena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NymphePallas.html Theoi.com: Pallas]&lt;/ref&gt;  In every case, Athena kills Pallas, accidentally, and thereby gains the name for herself. In one telling, they practice the arts of war together until one day they have a falling out. As Pallas is about to strike Athena, Zeus intervenes. With Pallas stunned by a blow from Zeus, Athena takes advantage and kills her. Distraught over what she has done, Athena takes the name Pallas for herself.

When Pallas is Athena's father the events, including her birth, are located near a body of water named Triton or [[Lake Tritonis|Tritonis]]. When Pallas is Athena's sister or foster-sister, Athena's father or foster-father is [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]], the son and herald of [[Poseidon]]. But Athena may be called the daughter of Poseidon and a nymph named Tritonis, without involving Pallas. Likewise, Pallas may be Athena's father or opponent, without involving Triton.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Robert, ''The Greek Myths I'', &quot;The Birth of Athena&quot;, 8.a., p. 51. The story comes from [[Libya]]n (modern [[Berber people|Berbers]]) where the Greek Athena and the Egyptian [[Neith]] blend into one deity. The story is not often referenced because some of the details are contradicted by other, better-documented theories. Frazer, vol. 2 p.41&lt;/ref&gt; On this topic, Walter Burkert says &quot;she is the Pallas of Athens, ''Pallas Athenaie'', just as Hera of Argos is ''Here Argeie''.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; For the Athenians, Burkert notes, Athena was simply &quot;the Goddess&quot;, ''he thea'', certainly an ancient title.

===''Athena Parthenos'': Virgin Athena===
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:RiddleAthena.jpg|thumb|The modern ''Athena Parthenos'', a replica of the statue that stood in her temple on the [[Acropolis]], including the Nike in her hand and the serpent, Erichthonius, behind her shield which stands in the replicated [[Parthenon]] in [[Centennial Park (Nashville)|Centennial Park]], [[Nashville]] [[Tennessee]]]] --&gt;

Athena never had a consort or lover and was thus known as ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'', &quot;Virgin Athena&quot;. Her most famous temple, the [[Parthenon]], on the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]] in [[Athens]] takes its name from this title. It was not merely an observation of her virginity, but a recognition of her role as enforcer of rules of sexual modesty and ritual mystery. Even beyond recognition, the Athenians allotted the goddess value based on this pureness of virginity as it upheld a rudiment of female behavior in the patriarchal society. Kerenyi's study and theory of Athena accredits her virginal toponym to be a result of the relationship to her father Zeus and a vital, cohesive piece of her character throughout the ages.&lt;ref&gt;K.Kerenyi,''Die Jungfrau und Mutter der griechischen Religion. Eine Studie uber Pallas Athene''.Zurich:Rhein Verlag, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; This role is expressed in a number of stories about Athena. [[Marinus]] reports that when Christians removed the statue of the Goddess from the [[Parthenon]], a beautiful woman appeared in a dream to [[Proclus]], a devotee of Athena, and announced that the ''&quot;Athenian Lady&quot;'' wished to dwell with him.&lt;ref&gt;Marinus of Samaria, ''&quot;The Life of Proclus or Concerning Happiness&quot;'', Translated by Kenneth S. Guthrie (1925), pp.15–55:30, retrieved 21 May 2007.[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/marinus_01_life_of_proclus.htm Marinus, ''Life of Proclus'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Erichthonius====
[[File:Gandharan Athena.jpg|thumb|Athena in the art of [[Gandhara]], [[India]].]]
[[Hephaestus]] attempted to [[rape]] Athena, but she eluded him. His [[semen]] fell to the earth and impregnated Gaia, and [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]] was born from the Earth, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. Athena then raised the baby as a foster mother.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, [[Bibliotheke]]'' 3.14.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Athena puts the infant Erichthonius in a small box (''cista'') which she entrusts to the care of three sisters, [[Herse]], [[Pandrosus]], and [[Aglaulus, daughter of Cecrops|Aglaulus]] of Athens. The goddess does not tell them what the box contains, but warns them not to open it until she returns. One or two sisters opens the ''cista'' to reveal Erichthonius, in the form (or embrace) of a [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]. The serpent, or insanity induced by the sight, drives Herse and Aglaulus to throw themselves off the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]].&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Robert, ''The Greek Myths I'', &quot;The Nature and Deeds of Athena&quot; 25.d.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jane Harrison (''Prolegomena'') finds this to be a simple cautionary tale directed at young girls carrying the ''cista'' in the [[Thesmophoria]] rituals, to discourage them from opening it outside the proper context.

&lt;!-- Her role as the virgin mother of [[Erichthonius]] was a relic of an archaic myth of the patron goddess of ''Athenai'' that preceded her placement among the Olympian pantheon. --&gt;
Another version of the myth of the Athenian maidens is told in ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' by the Roman poet [[Ovid]] (43 BC – 17 AD); in this late variant [[Hermes]] falls in love with Herse. Herse, Aglaulus, and Pandrosus go to the temple to offer sacrifices to Athena. Hermes demands help from Aglaulus to seduce Herse. Aglaulus demands money in exchange. Hermes gives her the money the sisters have already offered to Athena. As punishment for Aglaulus's greed, Athena asks the goddess Envy to make Aglaulus jealous of Herse. When Hermes arrives to seduce Herse, Aglaulus stands in his way instead of helping him as she had agreed. He turns her to stone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'', X. Aglaura, Book II, 708–751; XI. The Envy, Book II, 752–832.&lt;/ref&gt;

With this mythic origin, Erichthonius became the founder-[[king of Athens]], and many beneficial changes to Athenian culture were ascribed to him. During this time, Athena frequently protected him.

====Medusa and Tiresias====
In a late myth, [[Medusa]], unlike her two sister-Gorgons, came to be thought of by the Classical Greeks during the 5th century as mortal and extremely beautiful, but she lay with Poseidon in the temple of Athena and Hephasteus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/bogan/medusamyth.htm |title= Medusa in Myth and Literary History |accessdate= 2010-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon discovering the desecration of her temple, Athena changed Medusa's form to match that of her sister Gorgons as punishment. Medusa's hair turned into snakes, her lower body was transformed also, and meeting her gaze would turn any living man to stone. In the earliest of myths there is but one [[Gorgon]] and the only snakes were two wrapped around her waist as a belt.

In one version of the [[Tiresias]] myth, Tiresias stumbled upon Athena bathing, and he was struck blind by her to ensure he would never again see what man was not intended to see. But having lost his eyesight, he was given a special gift - to be able to understand the language of the birds (and thus to foretell the future).

===Lady of Athens===
Athena competed with [[Poseidon]] to be the patron deity of Athens, which was yet unnamed, in a version of one [[founding myth]]. They agreed that each would give the Athenians one gift and that the Athenians would choose the gift they preferred. Poseidon struck the ground with his [[trident]] and a spring sprang up; this gave them a means of trade and water —Athens at its height was a significant sea power, defeating the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] fleet at the [[Battle of Salamis]]— but the water was salty and not very good for drinking. Athena, however, offered them the first domesticated [[olive tree]]. The Athenians (or their king, [[Cecrops]]) accepted the olive tree and with it the patronage of Athena, for the olive tree brought wood, oil, and food. [[Robert Graves]] was of the opinion that &quot;Poseidon's attempts to take possession of certain cities are political myths&quot; which reflect the conflict between matriarchal and patriarchal religions.&lt;ref&gt;Graves 1960:16.3p 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other sites of cult====
Athena also was the patron goddess of several other Greek cities, notably Sparta, where the archaic cult of [[Athena Alea]] had its sanctuaries in the surrounding villages of [[Alea, Greece|Alea]], [[Mantineia]] and, notably, [[Tegea]]. Tegea was an important religious center of ancient Greece,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This sanctuary had been respected from early days by all the [[Peloponnesian]]s, and afforded peculiar safety to its suppliants&quot; (Pausanias, ''Description of Greece''  iii.5.6)&lt;/ref&gt; containing the Temple of [[Athena Alea]]. The ''temenos'' was founded by [[Aleus]], [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was informed.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' viii.4.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Votive bronzes at the site from the Geometric and Archaic periods take the forms of horses and deer; there are [[sealstone]] and [[fibula]]e. In the Archaic period the nine villages that underlie Tegea banded together in a [[synoecism]] to form one city.&lt;ref&gt;Compare the origin of [[Sparta]].&lt;/ref&gt; Tegea was listed in [[Homer]]'s [[Catalogue of Ships]] as one of the cities that contributed ships and men for the [[War of Troy|Achaean assault on Troy]].

[[File:Athena type Velletri.jpg|right|thumb|upright|''Helmeted Athena'', of the [[Athena of Velletri|Velletri type]]; a Roman copy (first century) of a [[Art in Ancient Greece|Greek]] original by [[Kresilas]], ''c.'' 430 BC.]]
&lt;!--Another interesting and arguable reason for why the Athenians chose Athena's olive tree over Poseidon's horses and spring was because Poseidon was known to be a very difficult deity to please and often wrought havoc even upon his cities. Athena was a better choice because of her less violent personality and the Athenians did not wish to have to encounter Poseidon's wrath in future. Poseidon and Athena may also be viewed as foils for one another; Athena girding order and civility in approaching conflicts and Poseidon unleashing rage without moderation. Poseidon lords over the horses and lets them run rampant while Athena produces the bridle and chariot so that the horse may be tamed.&lt;ref&gt;M.Detienne,&quot;Athena and the Mastery of the Horse&quot;,History of Religions(161-184).Hassocks:Harvester Press,1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Civilization needed the tranquility and resourcefulness of Athena much more than a uninhibited temper.

===Counselor===
Later myths of the Classical Greeks relate that Athena guided [[Perseus (mythology)|Perseus]] in his quest to behead [[Medusa (mythology)|Medusa]]. She instructed [[Heracles]] to skin the [[Nemean Lion]] by using its own claws to cut through its thick hide. She also helped Heracles to defeat the [[Stymphalian Birds]], and to navigate the underworld so as to capture [[Cerberus]].

In [[The Odyssey]], [[Odysseus]]' cunning and shrewd nature quickly won Athena's favour. In the realistic epic mode, however, she largely is confined to aiding him only from ''afar'', as by implanting thoughts in his head during his journey home from Troy. Her guiding actions reinforce her role as the &quot;protectress of heroes&quot; or as mythologian [[Walter Friedrich Otto]] dubbed her the &quot;goddess of nearness&quot; due to her mentoring and motherly probing.&lt;ref&gt;W.F.Otto,''Die Gotter Griechenlands(55-77)''.Bonn:F.Cohen,1929&lt;/ref&gt; It is not until he washes up on the shore of an island where [[Nausicaa]] is washing her clothes that Athena arrives personally to provide more tangible assistance. She appears in Nausicaa's dreams to ensure that the princess rescues Odysseus and plays a role in his eventual escort to Ithaca.

Athena appears in disguise to Odysseus upon his arrival, initially lying and telling him that Penelope, his wife, has remarried and that he is believed to be dead; but Odysseus lies back to her, employing skillful prevarications to protect himself.&lt;ref&gt;Trahman in ''Phoenix'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  Impressed by his resolve and shrewdness, she reveals herself and tells him what he needs to know in order to win back his kingdom. She disguises him as an elderly man or beggar so that he cannot be noticed by the suitors or Penelope, and helps him to defeat the suitors. She also plays a role in ending the resultant feud against the suitors' relatives, although she seems strange to readers. She instructs Laertes to throw his spear and to kill the father of Antinous, Eupeithes. But she must have forgotten her task of bringing peace to Ithaca and wiping the thought of slaughter from the suitors' families, because she suddenly told them to stop fighting.

===Roman fable of Arachne===
The [[fable]] of [[Arachne]] is a late Roman addition to Classical [[Greek mythology]]&lt;ref&gt;The Arachne narrative is in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' (vi.5-54 and 129-145) and mentioned in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Georgics]]'', iv, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; but does not appear in the myth repertoire of the Attic vase-painters. Arachne's name simply means ''spider'' (αράχνη). Arachne was the daughter of a famous dyer in [[Tyrian purple]] in Hypaipa of [[Lydia]], and a weaving student of Athena. She became so conceited of her skill as a weaver that she began claiming that her skill was greater than that of Athena herself.

Athena gave Arachne a chance to redeem herself by assuming the form of an old woman and warning Arachne not to offend the deities. Arachne scoffed and wished for a weaving contest, so she could prove her skill.

Athena wove the scene of her victory over [[Poseidon]] that had inspired her patronage of Athens. According to Ovid's Latin narrative, Arachne's tapestry featured twenty-one episodes of the infidelity of the deities, including [[Zeus]] being unfaithful with [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]], with [[Europa (mythical)|Europa]], and with [[Danaë]]. Athena admitted that Arachne's work was flawless, but was outraged at Arachne's offensive choice of subjects that displayed the failings and transgressions of the deities. Finally, losing her temper, Athena destroyed Arachne's tapestry and loom, striking it with her shuttle. Athena then struck Arachne with her staff, which changed her into a spider. In some versions, the destruction of her loom leads Arachne to hang herself in despair; Athena takes pity on her, and transforms her into a spider.

The fable suggests that the origin of weaving lay in imitation of spiders and that it was considered to have been perfected first in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]].&lt;!--no citation required: this is merely the superficial reading--&gt;

==Cult and attributes==
[[File:Athena ciste.jpg|thumb|alt=Athena with the cista|Helmeted Athena with the ''cista'' and Erichthonius in his serpent form. Roman, first century ([[Louvre Museum]]).]]
Athena's [[epithet]]s include {{polytonic|Άτρυτώνη}}, ''Atrytone'' (= the unwearying), {{polytonic|Παρθένος}}, ''Parthénos'' (= virgin), and {{polytonic|Ή Πρόμαχος}}, ''Promachos'' (the First Fighter, i. e. ''she who fights in front'').

In poetry from Homer, an oral tradition of the eighth or 7th century BC, onward, Athena's most common [[epithets in Homer|epithet]] is ''glaukopis'' (γλαυκώπις), which usually is translated as, ''bright-eyed'' or ''with gleaming eyes''.&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, 1940, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', ISBN 0-19-864226-1, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3D%236935 online version] at the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; The word is a combination of ''glaukos'' (γλαύκος, meaning ''gleaming'', ''silvery'', and later, ''bluish-green'' or ''gray'') and ''ops'' (ώψ, ''eye'', or sometimes, ''face''). It is interesting to note that ''glaux'' (γλαύξ, &quot;owl&quot;) is from the same root, presumably because of the bird's own distinctive eyes. The bird which sees well in the night is closely associated with the goddess of [[wisdom]]: in archaic images, Athena is frequently depicted with an owl perched on her head. This pairing evolved in tangent so that even in present day the owl is upheld as a symbol of perspicacity and erudition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deacy, Susan 2001&quot;/&gt;  Unsurprisingly, the owl became a sort of Athenian mascot. The [[olive]] tree is likewise sacred to her. In earlier times, Athena may well have been a [[bird goddess]], similar to the unknown goddess depicted with owls, wings, and bird talons on the [[Burney relief]], a Mesopotamian terracotta relief of the early second millennium BC.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Other epithets include: '''Aethyta''' under which she was worshiped in [[Megara]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], i. 5. § 3; 41. § 6&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''aithyia'' ({{polytonic|αίθυια}}) signifies a ''diver'', and figuratively, a ''ship'', so the name must reference Athena teaching the art of shipbuilding or navigation.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tzetzes]], ''ad Lycophr.'', ''l.c.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Schmitz |first=Leonhard |contribution=Aethyta |editor-last=Smith |editor-first = William |title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |volume=1 |page=51 |place=Boston, MA |year=1867 |contribution-url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0060.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a temple at Phrixa in [[Elis]], which was reportedly built by Clymenus, she was known as '''Cydonia'''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The various Athena subgroups, or cults, all branching from the central goddess herself often proctored various initiation rites of Grecian youth. For example, the passage into citizenship by young men and for women the elevation to the status of citizen wife. Her various cults were portals of a uniform socialization, even beyond mainland Greece.&lt;ref&gt;P.Schmitt,&quot;Athena Apatouria et la ceinture: Les aspects feminis des apatouries a Athenes&quot;in ''Annales:Economies, Societies, Civilisations''(1059-1073).London:Thames and Hudson,2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epithets==
In the ''[[Iliad]]'' (4.514), the [[Homeric Hymns]], and in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', Athena is given the curious epithet ''Tritogeneia.''  The meaning of this term is unclear. It seems to mean &quot;[[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]-born&quot;, perhaps indicating that the sea-deity was her parent according to some early myths,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Kerenyi suggests that &quot;Tritogeneia did not mean that she came into the world on any particular river or lake, but that she was born of the water itself; for the name Triton seems to be associated with water generally.&quot; (Kerenyi, p. 128).&lt;/ref&gt; In Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' Athena is occasionally referred to as &quot;Tritonia.&quot;

Another possible meaning may be ''triple-born'' or ''third-born'', which may refer to a triad or to her status as the third daughter of Zeus or the fact she was born from Metis, Zeus, and herself; various legends list her as being the first child after Artemis and Apollo, though other legends{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} identify her as Zeus' first child. The latter would have to be drawn from Classical myths, however, rather than earlier ones.

In her role as judge at [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes']] trial on the murder of his mother, [[Clytemnestra]] (which he won), Athena won the epithet ''Athena Areia''.
[[File:Peplos scene BM EV.JPG|thumb|left|A new ''[[peplos]] was woven for Athena and ceremonially brought to dress her [[cult image]] ([[British Museum]]).]]

Other epithets were [[Ageleia]] and [[Itonia]].

[[File:Ac.parthenon5.jpg|thumb|The Parthenon, Temple of Athena Parthenos.]]
Athena was given many other cult titles. She had the epithet ''Athena Ergane'' as the patron of craftsmen and artisans. With the epithet ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'' (&quot;virgin&quot;) she was especially worshipped in the festivals of the [[Panathenaea]] and [[Pamboeotia]] where both militaristic and athletic displays took place.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson,Noel.''Festivals and Legends:The Formation of Greek Cities in the Light of Public Ritual.''Toronto:University of Toronto Press,1992.&lt;/ref&gt; With the epithet ''Athena Promachos'' she led in battle. With the epithet ''Athena Polias'' (&quot;of the city&quot;), Athena was the protector of not only Athens but also of many other cities, including [[Argos]], [[Sparta]], [[Gortyn]], [[Lindos]], and [[Larisa]].

She was given the epithet ''[[Hippeia|Athena Hippeia]]'' or ''Athena Hippia'', ''horse'' as the inventor of the [[chariot]], and was worshipped under this title at Athens, [[Tegea]] and [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. As Athena Hippeia she was given an alternative parentage: [[Poseidon]] and [[Polyphe]], daughter of [[Oceanus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NymphePolyphe.html |title=POLYPHE: Oceanid nymph of Rhodes in the Aegean; Greek mythology |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Cult/AthenaTitles.html |title=TITLES OF ATHENA: Ancient Greek religion |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each of these cities her temple frequently was the major temple on the acropolis.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Athena often was equated with [[Aphaea]], a local goddess of the island of [[Aegina]], located near [[Athens]], once Aegina was under Athenian's power. The Greek historian [[Plutarch]] (46 AD–120 AD) also refers to an instance during the Parthenon's construction of her being called ''Athena [[Hygieia]]'' (&quot;healer&quot;):
{{quote|A strange accident happened in the course of building, which showed that the goddess was not averse to the work, but was aiding and co-operating to bring it to perfection. One of the artificers, the quickest and the handiest workman among them all, with a slip of his foot fell down from a great height, and lay in a miserable condition, the physicians having no hope of his recovery. When [[Pericles]] was in distress about this, the goddess [Athena] appeared to him at night in a dream, and ordered a course of treatment, which he applied, and in a short time and with great ease cured the man. And upon this occasion it was that he set up a brass statue of Athena Hygeia, in the citadel near the altar, which they say was there before. But it was [[Phidias]] who wrought the goddess's image in gold, and he has his name inscribed on the pedestal as the workman of it.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pericles'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pericles*.html#13 13.8]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In classical times the [[Plynteria]], or “Feast of Adorning”, was observed every May, it was a festival lasting five days. During this period the Priestesses of Athena, or “Plyntrides”, performed a cleansing ritual within “the Erecththeum”, the personal sanctuary of the goddess. Here Athena's statue was undressed, her clothes washed, and body purified.

In [[Arcadia]], she was assimilated with the ancient goddess Alea and worshiped as [[Athena Alea]].

==In Classical art==
[[File:PallasGiustiniani.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The ''[[Athena Giustiniani]]'', a Roman copy of a Greek statue of Pallas Athena with her serpent, Erichthonius.]]
[[File:AttalusICorrected.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Athena depicted on a coin of [[Attalus I]], ruler of [[Pergamon]] —c. 200 BC.]]
[[Image:StonePaletteMythologicalScene.jpg|thumb|Mythological scene with Athena (left) and [[Herakles]] (right), on a [[stone palette]] of the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], [[India]].]]
&lt;br /&gt;
Classically, Athena is portrayed wearing a full- length [[chiton (costume) | chiton]], sometimes girdled with serpents, and sometimes in armor, with her helmet raised high on the forehead to reveal the image of [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]. Her shield bears at its centre the ''[[gorgoneion]]'', the head of the [[gorgon]], as does her aegis. It is in this standing posture that she was depicted in [[Phidias]]'s famous lost [[Chryselephantine|gold and ivory]] statue of her, 36 m tall, the ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'' in the [[Parthenon]]. Athena also often is depicted with an [[owl]] sitting on one of her shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;The owl's role as a symbol of wisdom originates in this association with Athena.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Mourning Athena]]'' is a relief sculpture that dates around 460 BC and portrays a weary Athena resting on a staff.&lt;!--better interpretation?--&gt;
In earlier, archaic portraits of Athena in [[Black-figure pottery]], the goddess retains some of her Minoan-Mycenaean character, such as great bird wings although this is not true of archaic sculpture such as those of [[Aphaean Athena]], where Athena has subsumed an earlier, invisibly numinous —''[[Aphaea]]''— goddess with Cretan connections in her ''mythos''.

Other commonly received and repeated types of Athena in sculpture may be found in [[:Category:Athena types|this list]].

Apart from her attributes, there seems to be a relative consensus in late sculpture from the Classical period, the 5th century onward, as to what Athena looked like. Most noticeable in the face is perhaps the full round strong, masculine chin with a high nose that has a high bridge as a natural extension of the forehead. The eyes typically are somewhat deeply set. The unsmiling lips are usually full, but the mouth is depicted fairly narrow, usually just slightly wider than the nose. The neck is somewhat long. The net result is a serene, serious, somewhat aloof, and very masculine beauty.

==Name, etymology, and origin==
Athena had a special relationship with [[Athens]], as is shown by the etymological connection of the names of the goddess and the city. The citizens of Athens built a statue of Athena as a temple to the goddess, which had piercing eyes, a helmet on her head, attired with an [[aegis]] or [[cuirass]], and an extremely long spear. It also had a crystal shield with the head of the Gorgon on it. A large snake accompanied her and she held the goddess of victory in her hand.


[[File:Bust Athena Velletri Glyptothek Munich 213.jpg|thumb|right|Bust of Athena in the [[Glyptothek]]]]
Athena is associated with [[Athens]], a plural name because it was the place where she presided over her sisterhood, the ''Athenai'', in earliest times: [[Mycenae]] was the city where the Goddess was called Mykene, and Mycenae is named in the plural for the sisterhood of females who tended her there. At [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] she was called Thebe, and the city again a plural, Thebae (or Thebes, where the &quot;s&quot; is the plural formation). Similarly, at Athens she was called Athena, and the city Athenae (or Athens, again a plural).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ruck and Staples 1994:24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether her name is attested in [[Eteocretan]] or not will have to wait for decipherment of [[Linear A]].

Günther Neumann has suggested that Athena's name is possibly of [[Lydian language|Lydian]] origin;&lt;ref&gt;Günther Neumann, &quot;Der lydische Name der Athena. Neulesung der lydischen Inschrift Nr. 40&quot; ''Kadmos'' '''6''' (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; it may be a compound word derived in part from [[Tyrrhenian languages|Tyrrhenian]] &quot;ati&quot;, meaning ''mother'' and the name of the [[Hurrian]] goddess &quot;[[Hannahannah]]&quot; shortened in various places to &quot;Ana&quot; {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}. In [[Mycenaean Greek]], at [[Knossos]] a single inscription ''A-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja'' ''/Athana potniya/'' appears in the [[Linear B]] tablets from the Late Minoan II-era &quot;Room of the Chariot Tablets&quot;; these comprise the earliest Linear B archive anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Kn V 52 (text 208 in Ventris and Chadwick).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=797 |title=Palaeolexicon, Word study tool of ancient languages |publisher=Palaeolexicon.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Athana potniya'' often is translated ''Mistress Athena'', it literally means &quot;the ''potnia'' of At(h)ana&quot;, which perhaps, means ''the Lady of Athens'';&lt;ref&gt;Palaima, p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt; Any connection to the city of Athens in the Knossos inscription is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; We also find ''A-ta-no-dju-wa-ja'' ''/Athana diwya/'', the final part being the Linear B spelling of what we know from Ancient Greek as ''Diwia'' (Mycenaean ''di-u-ja'' or ''di-wi-ja''): '''''divine''''' Athena also was a weaver and the deity of crafts (see ''[[dyeus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Ventris and Chadwick [page missing]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his dialogue ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', the Greek philosopher [[Plato]], 428/427 BC – 348/347 BC, gives the etymology of Athena's name, based on the view of the ancient Athenians:

{{quote|That is a graver matter, and there, my friend, the modern interpreters of Homer may, I think, assist in explaining the view of the ancients. For most of these in their explanations of the poet, assert that he meant by Athena &quot;mind&quot; [''[[nous]]''] and &quot;intelligence&quot; [''dianoia''], and the maker of names appears to have had a singular notion about her; and indeed calls her by a still higher title, &quot;divine intelligence&quot; [''Thou noesis''], as though he would say: This is she who has the mind better than others. Nor shall we be far wrong in supposing that the author of it wished to identify this Goddess with moral intelligence [''en ethei noesin''], and therefore gave her the name ethonoe; which, however, either he or his successors have altered into what they thought a nicer form, and called her Athena''.|Plato, ''Cratylus'', 407b}}

Thus for Plato her name was to be derived from Greek Ἀθεονόα, ''Atheonóa'' —which the later Greeks rationalised as from the deity's (''theos'') mind (''nous'').

The Greek historian, [[Herodotus]] (c. 484–425 BC), noted that the Egyptian citizens of [[Sais]] in Egypt worshipped a goddess whose Egyptian name was [[Neith]];&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''The citizens have a deity for their foundress; she is called in the Egyptian tongue Neith, and is asserted by them to be the same whom the Hellenes call Athena; they are great lovers of the Athenians, and say that they are in some way related to them&quot;''. ('' [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 21e)&lt;/ref&gt; and they identified her with Athena. (''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 21e), (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 2:170–175).

Some authors{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} believe that, in early times, Athena was either an [[owl]] herself or a [[bird goddess]] in general: in Book 3 of the [[Odyssey]], she takes the form of a [[Sea eagle (bird)|sea-eagle]]. These authors argue that she dropped her prophylactic owl-mask before she lost her wings. &quot;Athena, by the time she appears in art,&quot; Jane Ellen Harrison had remarked, &quot;has completely shed her animal form, has reduced the shapes she once wore of snake and bird to attributes, but occasionally in [[Black figure pottery|black-figure vase-paintings]] she still appears with wings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison 1922:306. ([http://people.uncw.edu/kozloffm/Winged_Athena.jpg Harrison 1922:307 fig. 84: detail of a cup in the Faina collection]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Greek authors{{who|date=April 2010}} have derived natural symbols from the etymological roots of Athena's names to be aether, air, earth, and moon. This was one of the primary developments of scholarly exploration in the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;Johrens.Athenahymnus,438-452.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-classical culture==
[[File:Pallas Athene.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A neoclassical variant of ''[[Athena Promachos]]'' stands in front of the [[Austrian Parliament Building]] in Vienna.]]

A brief summary of Athena's evolution of myriad motifs after her dominance in Greece may be seen as follows: The rise of Christianity in Greece ended the worship of Greek deities and polytheism in general, but she resurfaced in the Middle Ages as a defender of sagacity and virtue so that her masculine warrior status was still intact. (She may be found on some family crests of nobility.) During the Renaissance she donned the mantle of patron of the arts and human endeavor and finally although not ultimately, Athena personified the miracles of freedom and republic during the French Revolution. (A statue of the goddess was centered on the Place de la Revolution in Paris.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Deacy, Susan 2001&quot;/&gt;

For over a century [[Parthenon (Nashville)|a full-scale replica of the Parthenon]] has stood in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], which is known as ''the Athens of the South''. In 1990, a gilded 41 feet (12.5 m) tall [[Athena Parthenos|replica of Phidias' statue]] of Athena Parthenos was added. The state [[seal of California]] features an image of Athena (or Minerva) kneeling next to a brown grizzly bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=97 |title=Symbols of the Seal of California |publisher=LearnCalifornia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athena is a natural patron of universities: she is the symbol of the [[Darmstadt University of Technology]], in Germany, and the [[Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro|Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]], in Brazil. Her image can be found in the shields of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters and the Faculty of Sciences of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], where her owl is the symbol of the Faculty of Chemistry.  At [[Bryn Mawr College]] in Pennsylvania a statue of Athena (a replica of the original bronze one in the arts and archaeology library) resides in the Great Hall. It is traditional at exam time for students to leave offerings to the goddess with a note asking for good luck, or to repent for accidentally breaking any of the college's numerous other traditions. Athena's owl also serves as the mascot of the college, and one of the college hymns is &quot;Pallas Athena&quot;. Pallas Athena is the tutelary goddess of the international social fraternity [[Phi Delta Theta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pdt&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phideltatheta.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=122 |title=Phi Delta Theta International - Symbols |accessdate=2008-06-07 |publisher=phideltatheta.org |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her owl is also a symbol of the fraternity.&lt;ref name=&quot;pdt&quot;/&gt;  

The title character in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s &quot;[[The Raven]]&quot; famously sits upon &quot;a Bust&lt;!--Bust in original--&gt; of Pallas&quot;.

She is the symbol of the United States Women's Navy and was depicted on their Unit Crest. A medal awarded to women who served in the Women Army Auxiliary Corps from 10 July 1942 to 31 August 1943, and to the Women Army Corps from 1 September 1943 to 2 September 1945 featured Athena on the front.

Athena's Helmet is the central feature on the [[United States Military Academy]] [[commons:File:U.S. Military Academy COA.png|crest]].

Athena is reported as a source of influence for feminist theologians such as [[Carol P. Christ]].

[[Jean Boucher (artist)|Jean Boucher]]'s statue of the seated skeptical thinker [[Ernest Renan]], shown to the left, caused great controversy when it was installed in Tréguier, [[Brittany]] in 1902. Renan's 1862 biography of Jesus had denied his divinity, and he had written the &quot;[http://www.lexilogos.com/document/renan/acropolis.htm Prayer on the Acropolis]&quot; addressed to the goddess Athena. The statue was placed in the square fronted by the cathedral. Renan's head was turned away from the building, while Athena, beside him, was depicted raising her arm, which was interpreted as indicating a challenge to the church during an anti-clerical phase in French official culture. The installation was accompanied by a mass protest from local Roman Catholics and a religious service against the growth of [[skepticism]] and [[secularism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeanboucher.net/?d=monuments&amp;p=monuments |title=Musee Virtuel Jean Boucher |publisher=Jeanboucher.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2005 Austria 10 Euro 60 Years Second Republic front.jpg|thumb|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2005 coinage|Euro coin commemorating 60 Years of the Second Republic of Austria]], featuring [[Athena Promachos]].]]
Athena has been used numerous times as a symbol of a republic by different countries and appears on currency as she did on the ancient [[drachma]] of Athens.
Athena (Minerva) is the subject of the $50 1915-S Panama-Pacific [[commemorative coin]]. At 2.5 troy oz (78 g) gold, this is the largest (by [[weight]]) coin ever produced by the [[United States Mint|U.S. Mint]]. This was the first $50 coin issued by the U.S. Mint and no higher was produced until the production of the $100 platinum coins in 1997. Of course, in terms of face-value in adjusted dollars, the 1915 is the highest denomination ever issued by the U.S. Mint.

Athena was depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the Greek 100 [[Greek drachma|drachmas]] banknote of 1978-2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en Bank of Greece]. Drachma Banknotes &amp; Coins: [http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en/Banknotes/banknote_selection.asp?Value=100 100 drachmas]. – Retrieved on 27 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent example is the [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2005 coinage|60 Years of the Second Republic commemorative coin]] issued by Austria in 2005. Athena is depicted in the obverse of the coin, representing the Austrian Republic.

She appears briefly in Disney's [[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]], but has a more dominant role in the television series.

[[Athena (Marvel Comics)|Athena]] is an active character in [[Marvel Comics]]' main continuity, the [[Marvel Universe]], most recently in the [[Incredible Hercules]] series. She acts as a guide to [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and his sidekick, boy genius [[Amadeus Cho]].

Athena appears in [[Rick Riordan]]'s [[Percy Jackson and the Olympians]] book series. Her daughter, born from her head as she was from Zeus's, [[demigod]] [[Annabeth Chase (Percy Jackson)|Annabeth Chase]] is one of the principal characters. Annabeth's father found her (Annabeth) lying in a golden cradle at the doorstep.

The Roman name for Athena is Minerva.

==Masculinity and feminism==
Athena had an &quot;androgynous compromise&quot; that allowed her traits and what she stood for to be attributed to male and female rulers alike over the course of history (such as Marie de Medici, Anne of Austria, Christina of Sweden, and Catherine the Great).&lt;ref&gt;F.Zeitlin,&quot;The Dynamics of Misogyny:Myth and Mythmaking in the Oresteia&quot;,''Arethusa''15(1978), 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

J.J. Bachofen advocated that Athena was originally a maternal figure stable in her security and poise but was caught up and perverted by a patriarchal society; this was especially the case in Athens. The goddess adapted but could very easily be seen as a god. He viewed it as &quot;motherless paternity in the place of fatherless maternity&quot; where once altered, Athena's character was to be crystallized as that of a patriarch.&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Bachofen.&quot;Mother Right:An investigation of religious and juridicial character of matriarchy in the ancient world&quot;,''Myth, Religion and Mother Right''.London:Routledge and Kegan Paul,1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas Bachofen saw the switch to paternity on Athena's behalf as an increase of power, Freud on the contrary perceived Athena as an &quot;original mother goddess divested of her power&quot;. In this interpretation, Athena was demoted to be only Zeus's daughter, never allowed the expression of motherhood. Still more different from Bachofen's perspective is the lack of role permanency in Freud's view: Freud held that time and differing cultures would mold Athena to stand for what was necessary to them.&lt;ref&gt;Shearer,''Athene'',224-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game''''' is a [[role-playing game]] created and written by [[Erick Wujcik]], set in the [[fictional universe]] created by author [[Roger Zelazny]] for his ''[[Chronicles of Amber]]''. The game is unusual in that no [[dice]] are used in resolving conflicts or player actions; instead a simple [[diceless role-playing game|diceless]] system of comparative ability, and narrative description of the action by the players and [[gamemaster]], is used to determine how situations are resolved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pyr&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pyramid Pick: Amber|journal=[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]| url=http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/login/article.html?id=370| date=1993-08-01| last=Blankenship| first=Loyd|volume=#2|accessdate=2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HG&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

''Amber DRPG'' was created in the 1980s, and is much more focused on relationships and roleplaying than most of the roleplaying games of that era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pyr&quot; /&gt; Most ''Amber'' characters are members of the two ruling classes in the ''Amber'' [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]], and are much more advanced in matters of strength, endurance, psyche, warfare and sorcery than ordinary beings. This often means that the only individuals who are capable of opposing a character are from his or her family, a fact that leads to much suspicion and intrigue.

==History==
The original 256-page game book&lt;ref name=&quot;amberdrpg&quot;&gt;Erick Wujcik ''Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game'' (Phage Press, 1991) ISBN 1-880494-00-0&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1991 by [[Phage Press]], covering material from the first five novels (the &quot;[[The Chronicles of Amber#The Corwin Cycle|Corwin Cycle]]&quot;) and some details - sorcery and the [[Logrus]] - from the remaining five novels (the &quot;[[The Chronicles of Amber#The Merlin Cycle|Merlin Cycle]]&quot;), in order to allow players to roleplay characters from the Courts of Chaos. Some details were changed slightly to allow more player choice - for example, players can be full Trump Artists without having walked the Pattern or the Logrus, which [[Merlin (The Chronicles of Amber)|Merlin]] says is impossible; and players' [[psychic]] abilities are far greater than those shown in the books.

[[Image:Shadow Knight.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of ''Shadow Knight'']]
A 256-page companion volume, ''Shadow Knight'',&lt;ref name=&quot;shadowknight&quot;&gt;Erick Wujcik ''Shadow Knight'' (Phage Press, 1993) ISBN 1-880494-01-9&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1993. This supplemental [[Rulebook|rule book]] includes the remaining elements from the Merlin novels, such as Broken Patterns, and allows players to create Constructs such as Merlin's Ghostwheel. The book presents the second series of novels not as additions to the series' [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] but as an example of a [[Campaign (role-playing games)|roleplaying campaign]] with Merlin, Luke, Julia, Jurt and Coral as the PCs. The remainder of the book is a collection of essays on the game, statistics for the new characters and an update of the older ones in light of their appearance in the second series, and (perhaps most usefully for GMs) plot summaries of each of the ten books. The book includes some material from [[Amber Short Stories|the short story The Salesman's Tale]], and some unpublished material cut from [[Prince of Chaos]], notably Coral's pregnancy by Merlin.

Both books were translated and released by French publisher [[Jeux Descartes]] in 1994 and 1995.

A third book, ''Rebma'', was promised. Cover art was commissioned&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hickman's [http://www.therpgsite.com/showthread.php?t=14836 ''Rebma'' cover art]&lt;/ref&gt; and pre-orders were taken, but it never arrived. Wujcik also expressed a desire to create a book giving greater detail to the Courts of Chaos.&lt;ref name=&quot;pyramid&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Shadow Knight (Preview) and Interview with Erick Wujcik |url=http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=640|accessdate=2006-05-29|journal=[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]|volume=#6|last=Blankenship|first=Loyd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publishing rights to the ''Amber DRPG'' games were acquired in 2004 by [[Guardians of Order]], who took over sales of the game and announced their intention to release a new edition of the game. However, no new edition was released before Guardians of Order went out of business in 2006. The two existing books are now [[out-of-print]], but they have been made available as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] downloads.&lt;ref name=&quot;pdf&quot;&gt;[http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=28_156 ''Amber DRPG'' books] at DriveThruRPG&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007 a new publishing company, headed by Edwin Voskamp and Eric Todd, was formed with the express purpose of bringing ''Amber DRPG'' back into print. The new company is named ''Diceless by Design''.&lt;ref name=&quot;dicelessbydesign&quot;&gt;[http://www.dicelessbydesign.com Diceless By Design]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==
{{main|The Chronicles of Amber}}
The game is set in the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]] described in Zelazny's ''Chronicles of Amber''. The first book assumes that gamemasters will set their campaigns after the Patternfall war; that is, after the end of the fifth book in the series, ''[[The Courts of Chaos]]'', but uses material from the following books to describe those parts of Zelazny's cosmology that were featured there in more detail. The ''Amber'' multiverse consists of '''Amber''', a city at one pole of the universe wherein is found [[the Pattern]], the symbol of [[:wikt:order|Order]]; The '''Courts of Chaos''', an assembly of worlds at the other pole where can be found [[the Logrus]], the manifestation of [[Chaos]], and the Abyss, the source or end of all reality; and '''Shadow''', the collection of all possible [[universe]]s (shadows) between and around them. Inhabitants of either pole can use one or both of the Pattern and the Logrus to travel through Shadow.

It is assumed that players will portray the children of the main characters from the books - the ruling family of Amber, known as the Elder Amberites - or a resident of the Courts. However, since some feel that being the children of the main characters is too limiting, it is fairly common to either start with King Oberon's death ''before'' the book begins and roleplay the Elder Amberites as they vie for the throne; or to populate Amber from scratch with a different set of Elder Amberites. The former option is one presented in the book; the latter is known in the Amber community as an &quot;[[Amethyst]]&quot; game. A third option is to have the players portray [[Corwin (The Chronicles of Amber)|Corwin]]'s children, in an Amber-like city built around Corwin's pattern; this is sometimes called an &quot;[[Argent]]&quot; game, since one of Corwin's [[Heraldry|heraldic]] colours is [[Silver]].

==System==
===Attributes===
Characters in ''Amber DRPG'' are represented by four [[attribute (role-playing games)|attributes]]: ''Psyche'', ''Strength'', ''Endurance'' and ''Warfare''.
*'''Psyche''' is used for feats of willpower or magic.
*'''Strength''' is used for feats of strength or [[Hand to hand combat|unarmed combat]].
*'''Endurance''' is used for feats of endurance.
*'''Warfare''' is used for armed combat, from duelling to commanding armies
The attributes run from -25 (normal human level), through -10 (normal level for a denizen of the Courts of Chaos) and 0 (normal level for an inhabitant of Amber), upwards without limit. Scores above 0 are &quot;ranked&quot;, with the highest score being ranked 1st, the next-highest 2nd, and so on. The character with 1st rank in each attribute is considered &quot;superior&quot; in that attribute, being considered to be substantially better than the character with 2nd rank even if the difference in scores is small.

====The Attribute Auction====
A character's ability scores are purchased during [[character creation]] in an [[auction]]; players get 100 [[character point]]s, and bid on each attribute in turn. The character who bids the most for an attribute is &quot;ranked&quot; first and is considered superior to all other characters in that attribute. Unlike conventional auctions, bids are non-refundable; if one player bids 65 for psyche and another wins with a bid of 66, then the character with 66 is &quot;superior&quot; to the character with 65 even though there is only one bid difference. Instead, lower bidding characters are ranked in ascending order according to how much they have bid, the characters becoming progressively weaker in that attribute as they pay less for it. After the auction, players can secretly pay extra points to raise their ranks, but they can only pay to raise their scores to an existing rank. Further, a character with a bid-for rank is considered to have a slight advantage over character with a bought-up rank.

The Auction simulates a 'history' of competition between the descendants of Oberon for [[player character]]s who have not had dozens of decades to get to know each other. Through the competitive Auction, characters may begin the game vying for standings. The auction serves to introduce some unpredictability into character creation without the need to resort to dice, cards, or other randomizing devices. A player may intend, for example, to create a character who is a strong mighty warrior, but being &quot;outplayed&quot; in the auction may result in lower attribute scores than anticipated, therefore necessitating a change of character concept. Since a player cannot control another players bids, and since all bids are non-refundable, the auction involves a considerable amount of strategizing and prioritization by players. A willingness to spend as many points as possible on an attribute may improve your chances of a high ranking, but too reckless a spending strategy could leave a player with few points to spend on powers, and objects. In a hotly contested auction, such as for the important attribute of warfare, the most valuable skill is the ability to force ones opponents to back down. With two, or more, equally determined players this can result in a &quot;bidding war&quot; where the attribute is driven up by increments to large sums. An alternative strategy is to try and cow other players into submission with a high opening bid. Most players bid low amounts between one and ten points in an initial bid in order to feel out the competition and to save points for other uses. A high enough opening bid could signal a players determination to be first ranked in that attribute, thereby dissuading others from competing.

====Psyche in ''Amber DRPG'' compared to the ''Chronicles''====
Characters with high psyche are presented as having strong [[telepathic]] abilities, being able to [[hypnotise]] and even mentally dominate any character with lesser psyche with whom they can make eye-contact. This is likely due to three scenes in the ''Chronicles'': first, when Eric paralyzes Corwin with an attack across the Trump and refuses to desist because one or the other would be dominated; second, when [[Corwin (The Chronicles of Amber)|Corwin]] faces the demon Strygalldwir, it is able to wrestle mentally with him when their gazes meet; and third, when Fiona is able to keep Brand immobile in the final battle at the Courts of Chaos.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatbookofamber&quot;&gt;Roger Zelazny ''The Great Book of Amber'' ([[Eos Press]], 1999) ISBN 0-380-80906-0&lt;/ref&gt; However, in general, the books only feature mental battles when there is some reason for mind-to-mind contact (for example, Trump contact) and magic or Trump is involved in all three of the above conflicts, so it is not clear whether Zelazny intended his characters to have such a power; the combination of Brand's &quot;living trump&quot; powers and his high Psyche (as presented in the roleplaying game) would have guaranteed him victory over Corwin. ''Shadow Knight'' does address this inconsistency somewhat, by presenting the &quot;living trump&quot; abilities as somewhat limited.

===Powers===
Characters in ''Amber DRPG'' have access to the powers seen in the ''Chronicles of Amber'': ''Pattern'', ''Logrus'', ''Shape-shifting'', ''Trump'', and ''magic''.

*'''Pattern:''' A character who has walked the pattern can walk in shadow to any possible universe, and while there can manipulate probability.

*'''Logrus:''' A character who has mastered the Logrus can send out Logrus tendrils and pull themselves or objects through shadow.

*'''Shape-shifting:''' Shape-shifters can alter their physical form and abilities.

*'''Trump:''' Trump Artists can create Trumps, a sort of [[tarot]] card which allows mental communication and travel. The book features Trump portraits of each of the elder Amberites. The trump picture of Corwin is executed in a subtly different style - and has features very similar to Roger Zelazny's.

*'''Magic:''' Three types of magic are detailed: '''Power Words''', with a quick, small effect; '''Sorcery''', with pre-prepared spells as in many other game systems; and '''Conjuration''', the creation of small objects. Each of the first three powers is available in an advanced form.

===Artifacts, Personal shadows and Constructs===
While a character with Pattern, Logrus or Conjuration can acquire virtually any object, players can choose to spend character points to obtain objects with particular virtues - unbreakability, or a mind of their own. Since they have paid points for the items, they are a part of the character's legend, and cannot lightly be destroyed. Similarly, a character can find any possible universe, but they can spend character points to know of or inhabit shadows which are (in some sense) &quot;real&quot; and therefore useful. The expansion, ''Shadow Knight'', adds Constructs - artifacts with connections to shadows.

===Stuff===
Unspent character points become '''good stuff''' - a good luck for the character. Players are also allowed to overspend (in moderation), with the points becoming '''bad stuff''' - bad luck which the Gamemaster should inflict on the character. Stuff governs how non-player characters perceive and respond to the character: characters with good stuff will often receive friendly or helpful reactions, while characters with bad stuff are often treated with suspicion or hostility.

As well as representing luck, stuff can be seen as representing a character's [[alignment (role-playing games)|outlook on the universe]]: characters with good stuff seeing the multiverse as a cheerful place, while characters with bad stuff see it as hostile.

===Conflict resolution===
In any given fair conflict between two characters, the character with the higher score in the relevant attribute will eventually win. The key words here are ''fair'' and ''eventually'' - if characters' ranks are close, and the weaker character has obtained some advantage, then the weaker character can escape defeat or perhaps prevail. Close ranks result in longer contests while greater difference between ranks result in fast resolution. Alternatively, if characters' attribute ranks are close, the weaker character can try to change the relevant attribute by changing the nature of the conflict. For example, if two characters are wrestling the relevant attribute is Strength; a character could reveal a weapon, changing it to Warfare; they could try to overcome the other character's mind using a power, changing it to Psyche; or they could concentrate their strength on defense, changing it to Endurance. If there is a substantial difference between characters' ranks, the conflict is generally over before the weaker character can react.

===The 'Golden Rule'===
''Amber DRPG'' advises gamemasters to change rules as they see fit - even to the point of adding or removing powers or attributes.

==='Powered by Erick Wujcik's Diceless Roleplaying'===
''Rite Publishing'' has recently (May 2010) secured a license from Diceless by Design to use the rules system in the creation of a new product to be written by industry and system veteran Jason Durall. The project uses the patronage business model and is called &quot;Lords of Gossamer and Shadow&quot;. The project is still pending completion as of Mar 2011.

==Community==
Despite the game's [[out-of-print]] status, a thriving [[fan convention|convention]] scene exists supporting the game. Amber conventions, known as ''Ambercons'', are held yearly in [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] ([[United States]]), [[Milton Keynes]] (England) and [[Modena, Italy]]. Additionally, Phage Press published 12 volumes of a dedicated ''Amber DRPG'' magazine called ''Amberzine''. Some ''Amberzine'' issues are still available from Phage Press.

[[File:Steel wire rope.png|thumb|[[Steel]] is a metal alloy whose major component is [[iron]], with [[carbon]] content between 0.02% and 2.14% by mass.]]

An '''alloy''' is a [[metal]]lic [[solid solution]] composed of two or more [[chemical element|elements]]. Complete solid solution alloys give single solid [[phase (matter)|phase]] microstructure, while partial solutions give two or more phases that may or may not be [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] in distribution, depending on thermal (heat treatment) history. Alloys usually have different properties from those of the component elements.

Alloy constituents are usually measured by mass.

==Theory==
Alloying a metal is done by combining it with one or more other metals or non-metals that often enhances its properties. For example, [[steel]] is stronger than [[iron]], its primary element. The physical properties, such as [[density]], [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], [[Young's modulus]], and [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]], of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its elements, but engineering properties such as [[tensile strength]]&lt;ref&gt;Adelbert Phillo Mills, (1922) ''Materials of Construction: Their Manufacture and Properties'', John Wiley &amp; sons, inc, originally published by the University of Wisconsin, Madison&lt;/ref&gt; and [[shear strength]] may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials. This is sometimes due to the sizes of the [[atom]]s in the alloy, since larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms, and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors, helping the alloy resist deformation. Sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element occur. For example, impurities in semi-conducting [[ferromagnetic]] alloys lead to different properties, as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl, Tian Abrie and Nakamura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hogan|first1=C.|title=Density of States of an Insulating Ferromagnetic Alloy|journal=Physical Review|volume=188|issue=2|pages=870|year=1969|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.188.870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=X.|last2=Suhl|first2=H.|title=Spin-wave-related period doublings and chaos under transverse pumping|journal=Physical Review A|volume=32|pages=2530–2533|year=1985|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.32.2530|pmid=9896377|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some alloys are made by melting and mixing two or more metals. [[Bronze]], an alloy of [[copper]] and [[tin]], was the first alloy discovered, during the [[prehistory|prehistoric]] period now known as the [[bronze age]]; it was harder than pure copper and originally used to make tools and weapons, but was later superseded by metals and alloys with better properties. In later times bronze has been used for [[ornament (architecture)|ornaments]], [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s, [[statue]]s, and [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]]. [[Brass]] is an alloy made from [[copper]] and [[zinc]]. 

Unlike pure metals, most alloys do not have a single [[melting point]], but a melting range in which the material is a mixture of [[solid]] and [[liquid]] phases. The temperature at which melting begins is called the [[solidus (chemistry)|solidus]], and the temperature when melting is just complete is called the [[liquidus]]. However, for most alloys there is a particular proportion of constituents (in rare cases two)—the [[eutectic]] mixture—which gives the alloy a unique melting point.

==Terminology==
The term alloy is used to describe a mixture of atoms in which the primary constituent is a metal. The primary metal is called the ''base'' or the ''matrix''. If there is a mixture of only two types of atoms, not counting impurities, such as a [[copper-nickel]] alloy, then it is called a ''binary alloy.'' If there are three different types of atoms forming the mixture, such as iron, nickel and chromium, then it is called a ''ternary alloy.'' An alloy with four constituents is a ''quaternary alloy,'' while a five-part alloy is termed a ''quinary alloy.'' Since the percentage of each constituent can be varied, with any mixture the entire range of possible variations is called a ''system''. In this respect, all of the various forms of an alloy containing only two constituents, like iron and carbon, is called a ''binary system,'' while all of the different alloy combinations possible with a ternary alloy, such as alloys of iron, carbon and chromium, is called a ''ternary system''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bauccio (2005) ''ASM metals reference book'', ASM International 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

When a molten metal is mixed with another substance, there are two different mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form, called ''atom exchange'' and the ''interstitial mechanism''. The relative size of each atom in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur. When the atoms are relatively similar in size, the atom exchange method usually happens, where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are replaced with atoms of the other constituent. With the interstitial mechanism, one atom is usually much smaller than the other, and so cannot successfully replace an atom in the crystals of the base metal. The smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms in the crystal matrix, called the ''interstices''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jon L. Dossett Page 1-14&quot;&gt;Jon L. Dossett, Howard E. Boyer (2006) ''Practical heat treating'', ASM International, pp. 1-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Alloys are often made in order to alter the mechanical properties of the base metal, to induce [[hardness]], [[toughness]], [[ductility]], or other desired properties. While most metals and alloys can be [[work hardening|work hardened]] by inducing defects in their crystal structure, caused by [[plastic deformation]], some alloys can also have their properties altered by [[heat treatment]]. Nearly all metals can be softened by [[annealing]], which repairs the crystal defects, but not as many can be hardened by controlled heating and cooling. Many alloys of [[aluminum]], [[copper]], [[magnesium]], [[titanium]], and [[nickel]] can be strengthened to some degree by some method of heat treatment, but few respond to this to the same degree that [[steel]] does.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jon L. Dossett Page 1-14&quot;/&gt; 

At a certain temperature, the base metal of steel, iron, undergoes a change in the arrangement of the atoms in its crystal matrix, called [[allotropy]]. This allows the small carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the crystal. When this happens, the carbon atoms are said to be in ''solution,'' or mixed with the iron. If the iron is cooled slowly, the carbon atoms will be forced out of solution, into the spaces between the crystals. If the steel is cooled quickly, the carbon atoms become trapped in solution, causing the iron crystals to deform when the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state, inducing great hardness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jon L. Dossett Page 1-14&quot;/&gt; 

In practice, some alloys are used so predominantly with respect to their base metals that the name of the primary constituent is also used as the name of the alloy. For example, 14 [[Karat (purity)|karat]] [[gold]] is an alloy of gold with other elements. Similarly, the [[silver]] used in [[jewelry]] and the [[aluminium]] used as a structural building material are also alloys.

The term &quot;alloy&quot; is sometimes used in everyday speech as a synonym for a particular alloy. For example, automobile wheels made of an [[aluminium alloy]] are commonly referred to as simply &quot;alloy wheels&quot;, although in point of fact steels and most other metals in practical use are also alloys.

[[File:Meteorite and a meteoritic iron hatchet.JPG|thumb|A meteorite is shown below a hatchet that was forged from meteoric iron.]]
[[File:Bronzebeile.JPG|right|thumb| Bronze axe 1100&amp;nbsp;BC]]
The use of alloys by humans started with the use of [[Iron meteorite|meteoric iron]], a naturally occurring alloy of [[nickel]] and [[iron]]. As no metallurgic processes were used to separate iron from nickel, the alloy was used as it was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In many cultures it was shaped by cold hammering into knives and arrowheads. They were often used as anvils. Meteoric iron was very rare and valuable, and difficult for ancient people to work.&lt;ref&gt;Vagn Fabritius Buchwald ''Iron and steel in ancient times'', Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab 2005 pp. 13–22&lt;/ref&gt;

Iron is usually found as [[iron ore]] on Earth, except for one deposit of native iron in [[Greenland]], which was used by the [[Inuit]] people. Native [[copper]], however, was found worldwide, along with [[silver]], [[gold]] and [[platinum]], which were also used to make tools, jewelry, and other objects since Neolithic times. Copper was the hardest of these metals, and the most widely distributed. It became one of the most important metals to the ancients. Eventually, humans learned to [[smelting|smelt]] metals such as copper and [[tin]] from [[ore]], and, around 2500 BC, began alloying the two metals to form [[bronze]], which is much harder than its ingredients. Tin was rare, however, being found mostly in Great Britain. In the Middle East, people began alloying copper with [[zinc]] to form [[brass]].&lt;ref&gt;Vagn Fabritius Buchwald ''Iron and steel in ancient times'', Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab 2005 pp. 39–41&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient civilizations made use of the information contained in modern [[alloy constitution diagram]]s, taking into account the mixture and the various properties it produced, such as [[hardness]], [[toughness]] and [[melting point]], under various conditions of [[temperature]] and [[work hardening]].&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

The first known smelting of iron began in [[Anatolia]], around 1800 BC Called the bloomery process, it produced very soft but [[ductile]] [[wrought iron]] and, by 800 BC, the technology had spread to Europe. [[Pig iron]], a very hard but brittle alloy of iron and [[carbon]], was being produced in [[China]] as early as 1200 BC, but did not arrive in Europe until the Middle Ages. These metals found little practical use until the introduction of [[crucible steel]] around 300 BC. These steels were of poor quality, and the introduction of [[pattern welding]], around the 1st century AD, sought to balance the extreme properties of the alloys by laminating them, to create a tougher metal.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;Cyril Smith  (1960) ''History of metallography'', MIT Press, ISBN 0262691205 pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] had been smelted from [[cinnabar]] for thousands of years. Mercury dissolves many metals, such as gold, silver, and tin, to form [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]]s, (an alloy in a soft paste, or liquid form at ambient temperature). Amalgams have been used since 200 BC in China for plating objects with precious metals, called [[gilding]], such as [[armor]] and [[mirror]]s. The ancient Romans often used mercury-tin amalgams for gilding their armor. The amalgam was applied as a paste and then heated until the mercury vaporized, leaving the gold, silver, or tin behind.&lt;ref&gt;George Rapp (2009) [http://books.google.com/books?id=ed0yC98aAKYC&amp;pg=PA180 ''Archaeomineralogy''], Springer, p. 180 ISBN 3540785930&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury was often used in mining, to extract precious metals like gold and silver from their ores.&lt;ref&gt;Harry A. Miskimin (1977) [http://books.google.com/books?id=QE04AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA31 ''The economy of later Renaissance Europe, 1460–1600''], Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0521292085, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ancient civilizations alloyed metals for purely aesthetic purposes. In ancient [[Egypt]] and [[Mycenae]], gold was often alloyed with copper to produce red-gold, or iron to produce a bright burgundy-gold. Silver was often found alloyed with gold. These metals were also used to strengthen each other, for more practical purposes. Quite often, precious metals were alloyed with less valuable substances as a means to deceive buyers.&lt;ref&gt;Paul T. Nicholson, Ian Shaw (2000) [http://books.google.com/books?id=Vj7A9jJrZP0C&amp;pg=PA164 ''Ancient Egyptian materials and technology''], Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0521452570 pp. 164–167&lt;/ref&gt; Around 250 BC, [[Archimedes]] was commissioned by the king to find a way to check the purity of the gold in a crown, leading to the famous bath-house shouting of &quot;Eureka!&quot; upon the discovery of [[Archimedes principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Kay (2008) [http://books.google.com/books?id=xCtAV_MCD1EC&amp;pg=PA45 ''Practical Hydraulics''], Taylor and Francis, ISBN 0415351154 p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

While the use of iron started to become more widespread around 1200 BC, mainly due to interruptions in the trade routes for tin, the metal is much softer than bronze. However, very small amounts of [[steel]], (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability to modify the hardness of steel by [[heat treatment]] had been known since 1100 BC, and the rare material was valued for use in tool and weapon making. Since the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to fully melt iron, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of [[blister steel]] during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the penetration of carbon was not very deep, so the alloy was not very homogenous. In 1740, [[Benjamin Huntsman]] began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of [[tool steel]]. Huntsman's process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=&quot;George Adam Roberts Page 2-3&quot;&gt;George Adam Roberts, George Krauss, Richard Kennedy, Richard L. Kennedy (1998) [http://books.google.com/books?id=ScphevR_eP8C&amp;pg=PA2 ''Tool steels''], ASM International, ISBN 0871705990 pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the introduction of the blast furnace to Europe in the Middle Ages, pig iron was able to be produced in much higher volumes than wrought iron. Since pig iron could be melted, people began to develop processes of reducing the carbon in the [[liquid]] pig iron in order to create steel. [[Puddling (metallurgy)|Puddling]] was introduced during the 1700s, where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air, to remove the carbon by [[oxidation]]. In 1858, [[Sir Henry Bessemer]] developed a process of steel making by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content. The [[Bessemer process]] was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel.&lt;ref name=&quot;George Adam Roberts Page 2-3&quot;/&gt; Once the Bessemer process began to gain widespread use, other alloys of steel began to follow, such as [[mangalloy]], an alloy of steel and [[manganese]], which exhibits extreme hardness and toughness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keytometals.com/Articles/Art69.htm Cast steel: Austenitic Manganese Steels]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=October 2009}}

'''Articles of faith''' are sets of beliefs usually found in [[creed]]s, sometimes numbered, and often beginning with &quot;We believe...&quot;, which attempt to more or less define the fundamental [[theology]] of a given [[religion]], and especially in the  [[Christian Church]].

==Articles of the apostles==
The earliest articles of faith were said to have been composed in the first century by the apostles themselves and sung publicly while on mission (see [[Old Roman Symbol]]).

==Articles of Nicea==
The [[Nicene Creed]] and the shorter [[Apostles' Creed]] are articles, or professions of Faith said by members of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Communion]].

The Nicene Creed is predominantly recited during the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] while the Apostles' is typically used for other occasions, healings, etc. It strongly asserts belief in the [[Holy Trinity]], the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]], the [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]], the [[passion of Christ]], the [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]], the judgement of the living.

==Articles of Chalcedon==
The articles of the [[Chalcedonian Creed]] reaffirm belief in the [[dyophysitism]] of Christ : two natures, one co-substantial person.

==The Thirty Nine Articles==

The [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] are the historic defining statements of [[Anglicanism]] doctrine.

==Other articles and creeds==
The confession of faith of Westminster is one of many evangelical creeds that give articles of faith based on [[sola scriptura]] rather than on the living experience of the Church. Many evangelical creeds will restate traditional [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] or [[Arminianism|Arminian]] theology, such as belief in biblical [[inerrancy]] and [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]].

==Latter Day Saint movement==
{{main|Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)}}
Within the [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|sects]] of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the ''Articles of Faith'' are a list composed by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] as part of an 1842 [[The Wentworth Letter|letter]] sent to [[John Wentworth (mayor)|&quot;Long&quot; John Wentworth]], editor of the ''[[Chicago Democrat]]''.

==Islam==
{{main|Islamic theology|Iman (concept)}}
There are six traditional articles of faith among Muslims:
# [[Tawhid|One God]]
# [[Angels#Islamic_views|Angels]]
# [[Prophet#The_Islamic_concept_of_prophet|Prophets]]
# [[Islamic holy books|Scriptures]]
# [[Last Judgment|The Day of Judgment]] and the [[Akhirah]] or [[afterlife]]
# [[Predestination in Islam|Predestination]]

In Sahih [[Al-Muslim]] and [[Al-Bukhari]], Prophet [[Muhammad]] explains, &quot;It (Al-Iman/faith) is to affirm your faith in God, [[Angels in Islam|His angels]], His Books [[Prophets of Islam|His Messengers]] and the Last Day, and to believe in the Divine Destiny whether it be good or bad.&quot;

[[Prophets of Islam|Prophets]] in here refer to previous prophets such as Adam, Abraham, Noah, Moses, Jacob, David, Solomon and so on all the way until Jesus and Muhammed.

The word &quot;scriptures&quot; refers to the original scriptures that were given to certain prophets. Moses received the Torah ([[Tawrat]]), David received the Psalms ([[Zabur]]), Jesus inspired the Gospels ([[Injil]]), and Muhammed received the [[Qur'an]].

==Judaism==
{{main|Jewish principles of faith|Maimonides#The 13 principles of faith}}
There is not a formal creed within Judaism, though one has become especially authoritative. Although controversial at its time though today considered mostly normative, the [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides' 13 principles of faith|13 principles]] laid out by the 12th century Spanish Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] are formalized in the prayerbook following daily morning services. Each principle preceded by &quot;''Ani Ma'amin B'emunah Shleymah''&quot;, &quot;I believe with perfect faith that...&quot;  These principles are reflected in the hymn [[Yigdal]].

==Sikh==
The [[Sikhism|Sikh]] articles of faith are the [[Five K's]]:
#K'esh: Unshorn hair
#Kan'ga: Wooden comb
#Kir'pan: Sword for protection
#Ka'ra: Iron bangle
#Kashe'ra: Garments under clothing

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Capitalization|date=May 2011}}Throughout history, forms of [[art]] have gone through periodic abrupt changes called '''artistic revolutions'''.  Movements have come to an end to be replaced by a new movement markedly different in striking ways.  See also [[cultural movement]]s.

== Artistic revolution and cultural/political revolutions ==

The role of [[fine art]] has been to simultaneously express values of the current culture while also offering criticism, balance, or alternatives to any such values that are proving no longer useful. So as times change, art changes. If changes were abrupt they were deemed revolutions. The best artists have predated society's changes due not to any prescenience, but because sensitive perceptivity is part of their 'talent' of seeing.

Artists have had to 'see' issues clearly in order to satisfy their current clients, yet not offend potential patrons. For example, paintings glorified aristocracy in the early 17th century when leadership was needed to nationalize small political groupings, but later as leadership became oppressive, satirization increased and subjects were less concerned with leaders and more with more common plights of mankind.

In its origins and its first golden age, no art owes quite as much to state power as French painting does. It was in the age of absolute monarchy launched by Louix XIV in the 17th century that the likes of Poussin and Le Brun put France in the forefront of European art. Versailles found its stately mirror in the powerful idea of classicism – a painting style, enduring in later artists like Ingres, whose austerity and grandeur express the authority of a world where Jove is very much in his throne.&lt;ref&gt;jonathanjonesblog&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of revoutionary art in conjunction with cultural/political movements:

*[[Trotskyist]] &amp; [[Diego Rivera]]
*[[Black Panther Party]] &amp; [[Emory Douglas]]
*Cuban [[Poster art]]
*[[Social realism]] &amp; [[Ben Shahn]]
*[[Feminist art]] &amp; the [[Guerrilla Girls]]
*[[Industrial Workers of the World]] &amp; [[Woody Guthrie]]
* [http://revolutionarytides.stanford.edu/main.html Revolutionary Tides]

== Artistic revolution of style ==

[http://www.art-head-start.com/3d/squid/revolution300.jpg Here] is an example of an Artistic Revolution Piece

But not all artistic revolutions were political. Revolutions of style have also abruptly changed the art of a culture. For example, when the careful, even tedious, art techniques of French neo-classicism became oppressive to artists living in more exuberant times, a stylistic revolution known as &quot;[[Impressionism]]&quot; vitalized brush strokes and color. [[Edgar Degas]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] burst onto the French culture, effecting a revolution with a style that has become commonplace today.

An artistic revolution can be begun by a single artist, but unless that artist gains some understanding, he becomes an iconoclast. The first [[Abstract Expressionists]] were considered madmen to give up their brushes and rely on the sheer force of energy to leave an image, but then the import of atomic bombs, all atomic energy, became realized, and art found no better way of expressing its power.  [[Jackson Pollock]] is the artist best known for starting that revolution.

== Artistic Movements ==

[[Art in ancient Greece|ANCIENT &amp; CLASSICAL ART]]&lt;br /&gt;
KEY DATES: 15000 BC / 400 BC-200AD / 350 AD-450AD&lt;br /&gt;
Ancient - There are few remaining examples with early art often favouring drawing over colour. Work has been found recently in tombs, Egyptian frescoes, pottery and metalwork.&lt;br /&gt;
Classical - Relating to or from ancient Roman or Greek architecture and art. Mainly concerned with geometry and symmetry rather than individual expression.&lt;br /&gt;
Byzantine - A religious art characterised by large domes, rounded arches and mosaics from the eastern Roman Empire in the 4th Century.&lt;ref&gt;www.artmovements.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gothic architecture|MEDIEVAL &amp; GOTHIC]]&lt;br /&gt;
KEY DATES: 400AD&lt;br /&gt;
Medieval - A highly religious art beginning in the 5th Century in Western Europe. It was characterised by iconographic paintings illustrating scenes from the bible.&lt;br /&gt;
Gothic - This style prevailed between the 12th century and the 16th century in Europe. Mainly an architectural movement, Gothic was characterised by its detailed ornamentation most noticeably the pointed archways and elaborate rib vaulting.&lt;br /&gt;
First developed in France, Gothic was intended as a solution to the inadequacies of Romanesque architecture. It allowed for cathedrals to be built with thinner walls and it became possible to introduce stained glass windows instead of traditional mosaic decorations. Some of the finest examples of the style include the cathedrals of Chartres, Reims and Amiens. The term was also used to describe sculpture and painting that demonstrated a greater degree of naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;www.artmovements.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renaissance|RENAISSANCE]]&lt;br /&gt;
KEY DATES: 1300s&lt;br /&gt;
This movement began in Italy in the 14th century and the term, literally meaning rebirth, describes the revival of interest in the artistic achievements of the Classical world. Initially in a literary revival Renaissance was determined to move away from the religion-dominated Middle Ages and to turn its attention to the plight of the individual man in society. It was a time when individual expression and worldly experience became two of the main themes of Renaissance art. The movement owed a lot to the increasing sophistication of society, characterised by political stability, economic growth and cosmopolitanism. Education blossomed at this time, with libraries and academies allowing more thorough research to be conducted into the culture of the antique world. In addition, the arts benefited from the patronage of such influential groups as the Medici family of Florence, the Sforza family of Milan and Popes Julius II and Leo X. The works of Petrarch first displayed the new interest in the intellectual values of the Classical world in the early 14th century and the romance of this era as rediscovered in the Renaissance period can be seen expressed by Boccaccio. Leonardo da Vinci was the archetypal Renaissance man representing the humanistic values of the period in his art, science and writing. Michelangelo and Raphael were also vital figures in this movement, producing works regarded for centuries as embodying the classical notion of perfection. Renaissance architects included Alberti, Brunelleschi and Bramante.Many of these artists came from Florence and it remained an important centre for the Renaissance into the 16th century eventually to be overtaken by Rome and Venice. Some of the ideas of the Italian Renaissance did spread to other parts of Europe, for example to the German artist Albrecht Dürer of the 'Northern Renaissance'. But by the 1500s Mannerism had overtaken the Renaissance and it was this style that caught on in Europe. &lt;br /&gt;
REPRESENTATIVE ARTISTS:&lt;br /&gt;
Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, Raphael, Titian, Michelangelo Buonarroti&lt;ref&gt;www.artmovements.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Mannerism|MANNERISM]]&lt;br /&gt;
KEY DATES: 1520-1600&lt;br /&gt;
Artists of the Early Renaissance and the High Renaissance developed their characteristic styles from the observation of nature and the formulation of a pictorial science. When Mannerism matured after 1520(The year Raphael died), all the representational problems had been solved. A body of knowledge was there to be learned. Instead of nature as their teacher, Mannerist artists took art. While Renaissance artists sought nature to find their style, the Mannerists looked first for a style and found a manner.In Mannerist paintings, compositions can have no focal point, space can be ambiguous, figures can be characterized by an athletic bending and twisting with distortions, exaggerations, an elastic elongation of the limbs, bizarre posturing on one hand, graceful posturing on the other hand, and a rendering of the heads as uniformly small and oval. The composition is jammed by clashing colors, which is unlike what we've seen in the balanced, natural, and dramatic colors of the High Renaissance. Mannerist artwork seeks instability and restlessness. There is also a fondness for allegories that have lascivious undertones. &lt;br /&gt;
REPRESENTATIVE ARTISTS:&lt;br /&gt;
Andrea del Sarto, Jacopo da Pontormo, Correggio&lt;ref&gt;www.artmovements.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Baroque|BAROQUE]]&lt;br /&gt;
KEY DATES: 1600s&lt;br /&gt;
Baroque Art emerged in Europe around 1600, as an reaction against the intricate and formulaic Mannerist style which dominated the Late Renaissance. Baroque Art is less complex, more realistic and more emotionally affecting than Mannerism.&lt;br /&gt;
This movement was encouraged by the Catholic Church, the most important patron of the arts at that time, as a return to tradition and spirituality.&lt;br /&gt;
One of the great periods of art history, Baroque Art was developed by Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, and Gianlorenzo Bernini, among others. This was also the age of Rubens, Rembrandt, Velázquez, and Vermeer.&lt;br /&gt;
In the 18th century, Baroque Art was replaced by the more elegant and elaborate Rococo style.&lt;br /&gt;
REPRESENTATIVE ARTISTS:&lt;br /&gt;
Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Gianlorenzo Bernini, Rubens, Rembrandt, Nicolas Poussin&lt;ref&gt;www.artmovements.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Rococo|ROCOCO]]&lt;br /&gt;
KEY DATES: 1700s&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout the 18th century in France, a new wealthy and influential middle-class was beginning to rise, even though the royalty and nobility continued to be patrons of the arts. Upon the death of Louis XIV and the abandonment of Versailles, the Paris high society became the purveyors of style. This style, primarily used in interior decoration, came to be called Rococo. The term Rococo was derived from the French word &quot;rocaille&quot;, which means pebbles and refers to the stones and shells use to decorate the interiors of caves. Therefore, shell forms became the principal motif in Rococo. The society women competed for the best and most elaborate decorations for their houses. Hence the Rococo style was highly dominated by the feminine taste and influence.&lt;br /&gt;
Francois Boucher was the 18th century painter and engraver whose works are regarded as the perfect expression of French taste in the Rococo period. Trained by his father who was a lace designer, Boucher won fame with his sensuous and light-hearted mythological paintings and landscapes. He executed important works for both the Queen of France and Mme. de Pompadour, Louis XV's mistress, who was considered the most powerful woman in France at the time. Boucher was Mme. de Pompadour's favorite artist and was commissioned by her for numerous paintings and decorations. Boucher also became the principal designer for the royal porcelain factory and the director of the Gobelins tapestry factory. The Vulcan Presenting Venus with Arms for Aeneas is a template for a tapestry made by this factory. &lt;br /&gt;
Characterized by elegant and refined yet playful subject matters, Boucher's style became the epitome of the court of Louis XV. His style consisted of delicate colors and gentle forms painted within a frivolous subject matter. His works typically utilized delightful and decorative designs to illustrate graceful stories with Arcadian shepherds, goddesses and cupids playing against a pink and blue sky. These works mirrored the frolicsome, artificial and ornamented decadence of the French aristocracy of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
The Rococo is sometimes considered a final phase of the Baroque period.&lt;br /&gt;
REPRESENTATIVE ARTISTS:&lt;br /&gt;
Francois Boucher, William Hogarth, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Angelica Kauffmann, Giovanni Antonio Canaletto, Velázquez Vermeer&lt;ref&gt;www.artmovements.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Neoclassicism|NEO-CLASSICAL]]&lt;br /&gt;
KEY DATES: 1750-1880&lt;br /&gt;
A nineteenth century French art style and movement that originated as a reaction to the Baroque. It sought to revive the ideals of ancient Greek and Roman art. Neoclassic artists used classical forms to express their ideas about courage, sacrifice, and love of country. David and Canova are examples of neo-classicists.&lt;br /&gt;
REPRESENTATIVE ARTISTS:&lt;br /&gt;
Jacques-Louis David, Sir Henry Raeburn, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Thomas Gainsborough, Antonio Canova, Arnold Bocklin&lt;ref&gt;www.artmovements.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Romanticism|ROMANTICISM]]&lt;br /&gt;
KEY DATES: 1800-1880&lt;br /&gt;
Romanticism was basically a reaction against Neoclassicism, it is a deeply-felt style which is individualistic, beautiful, exotic, and emotionally wrought.&lt;br /&gt;
Although Romanticism and Neoclassicism were philosophically opposed, they were the dominant European styles for generations, and many artists were affected to a greater or lesser degree by both. Artists might work in both styles at different times or even mix the styles, creating an intellectually Romantic work using a Neoclassical visual style, for example.&lt;br /&gt;
Great artists closely associated with Romanticism include J.M.W. Turner, Caspar David Friedrich, John Constable, and William Blake.&lt;br /&gt;
In the United States, the leading Romantic movement was the Hudson River School of dramatic landscape painting.&lt;br /&gt;
Obvious successors of Romanticism include the Pre-Raphaelite movement and the Symbolists. But Impressionism, and through it almost all of 20th century art, is also firmly rooted in the Romantic tradition. &lt;br /&gt;
REPRESENTATIVE ARTISTS:&lt;br /&gt;
George Stubbs, William Blake, John Martin, Francisco Goya, Sir Thomas Lawrence, John Constable, Eugene Delacroix, Sir Edwin landseer, Caspar David Friedrich, JMW Turner&lt;ref&gt;www.artmovements.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>robot Removing: [[de:Agrarismus]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Agrarianism''' and '''agrarian''' have two meanings. One refers to a [[social philosophy]] or  [[political philosophy]] which stresses the moral superiority of a rural life based on [[farming]], as opposed to the supposed corruption of city life, with its banks and factories. [[Thomas Jefferson]] was a famous representative agrarian.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Govan, &quot;Agrarian and Agrarianism: A Study in the Use and Abuse of Words,&quot; ''Journal of Southern History'', Vol. 30#1  (Feb., 1964), pp. 35-47 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2205372 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;agrarianism&quot; also means radical proposals for land redistribution, specifically the distribution of land from the rich to the poor or landless. This terminology is common in many countries, and originated from the &quot;Lex Sempronia Agraria&quot; or &quot;agrarian laws&quot; of Rome in 133 BC, imposed by [[Tiberius Gracchus]], that seized the lands of the rich and distributed them to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Scullard, ''From the Gracchi to Nero: A History of Rome from 133 B.C. to A.D. 68'' (1963) ch 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In societies influenced by [[Confucianism]], the farmer was considered an esteemed productive member of society, whereas merchants who made money were looked down upon.
In eighteenth- and nineteenth-century England, the word identified any land reform movement that sought to redistribute cultivated lands equally. Today, the word has largely shed this radical political meaning. Instead, agrarianism points to a collection of political, philosophical, and literary ideas that together tend to describe farm life in ideal terms{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

== Philosophy ==
In the introduction to his 1969 book ''Agrarianism in American Literature'', [[M. Thomas Inge]] defines agrarianism by the following basic tenets:

*Cultivation of the soil provides direct contact with nature; through the contact with nature, the agrarian acquires the virtues of &quot;honor, manliness, [[self-sufficiency|self-reliance]], courage, moral integrity, and hospitality&quot; and follows the example of God when creating order out of chaos.

*The farmer &quot;has a sense of identity, a sense of historical and religious tradition, a feeling of belonging to a concrete family, place, and region, which are psychologically and culturally beneficial.&quot; The harmony of this life checks the encroachments of a fragmented, alienated modern society that has grown to inhuman scale.

*In contrast, farming offers more independence and [[self-sufficiency]]. It has a solid, stable position in the world order. But urban life, [[capitalism]], and technology destroy independence and dignity while fostering vice and weakness.  The agricultural community can provide checks and balances against the imbalances of modern society by its fellowship of labor and cooperation with other agrarians, while obeying the rhythms of nature.

== History ==
Borrowing from the French [[Physiocrats]] the idea that all wealth originates with the land, making farming the only truly productive enterprise, agrarianism claims that agriculture is the foundation of all other professions. Philosophically, agrarianism reflects the ideas of [[John Locke]], who declared in his Second Treatise of Civil Government (1690) that those who work land are its rightful owners. His labor theory of value influenced the thinking of [[Thomas Jefferson]], who in turn shaped the way many nineteenth-century American homesteaders understood ownership of their farms.  Jefferson wrote in 1785 in a letter to [[John Jay]] that

{{quote|Cultivators of the earth are the most valuable citizens. They are the most vigorous, the most independent, the most virtuous, &amp; they are tied to their country &amp; wedded to its liberty &amp; interests by the most lasting bonds.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson: [[s:Letter to John Jay - August 23, 1785|Letter to John Jay August 23, 1785]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Richard Hofstadter]] has traced the sentimental attachment to the rural way of life which is &quot;a kind of homage that Americans have paid to the fancied innocence of their origins. Hofstadter notes that to call this a &quot;myth&quot; is not to imply that the idea is simply false. Rather the ''myth'' so effectively an agrarian ethos that it profoundly influences people's  ways of perceiving values and hence their behavior. He emphasizes the importance of the agrarian myth in American politics and life even after industrialization had revolutionized the American economy and life. He stresses the significance of the writings of  Jefferson and his followers in the South, such as [[John Taylor of Caroline]] in the development of agricultural fundamentalism.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hofstadter, '' The Age of Reform'' (1955)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, agrarianism felt the influence of the European [[Romanticism]] movement. Romantics focused attention on the individual and described nature as a spiritual force.  At a time when pristine wilderness was becoming scarce in many parts of Europe, what constitutes “nature” was confused with the last remnants of wilderness—cultivated fields, managed woodlands, and cultivated livestock and crops. As someone in constant contact with (this watered-down version of) “nature”, the farmer was positioned to experience moments that transcend the mundane material world.  In doing so, these thinkers managed to redefine nature in man's image, accommodating [[enclosure]] with a new “domesticated” version of nature.

In the 1910s and 1920s, agrarianism garnered significant popular attention, but was eclipsed in the  postwar period. It has been revived somewhat in conjunction with the [[environmentalism|environmental movement]], and has been drawing an increasing number of adherents.

In 1930 the [[Southern Agrarians]] wrote in the &quot;Introduction: A Statement of Principles&quot; to their book ''I'll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition'' that

{{quote|All the articles bear in the same sense upon the book's title-subject: all tend to support a Southern way of life against what may be called the American or prevailing way; and all as much as agree that the best terms in which to represent the distinction are contained in the phrase, Agrarian ''versus'' Industrial. ... Opposed to the industrial society is the agrarian, which does not stand in particular need of definition. An agrarian society is hardly one that has no use at all for industries, for professional vocations, for scholars and artists, and for the life of cities. Technically, perhaps, an agrarian society is one in which agriculture is the leading vocation, whether for wealth, for pleasure, or for prestige-a form of labor that is pursued with intelligence and leisure, and that becomes the model to which the other forms approach as well as they may. But an agrarian regime will be secured readily enough where the superfluous industries are not allowed to rise against it. The theory of agrarianism is that the culture of the soil is the best and most sensitive of vocations, and that therefore it should have the economic preference and enlist the maximum number of workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA01/White/anthology/agrarian.html I'll Take My Stand, Introduction: A Statement Of Principles], Southern Agrarians&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Recent agrarian thinkers are sometimes referred to as neo-Agrarian and include the likes of [[Wendell Berry]] and [[Gene Logsdon]]. They are characterized by seeing the world through an agricultural lens.  Although much of Inge's principles, above, still apply to the New Agrarianism, the affiliation with a particular religion and patriarchal tendency have subsided to some degree.

===Europe===
In Russia the intellectuals of the &quot;Populists&quot; ([[Narodnaya Volya]]&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah  Berlin, &quot;The Populists' Moral Condemnation of Russia Political and Social Systems,&quot; in Arthur E. Adams, ed. ''Problems of European Civilization: Imperial Russia after 1861'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;) and, later, the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] developed a theoretical basis for a peasant movement, building a  rich, well-developed humanistic ideology which influenced eastern Europe, especially the Balkans. It never attained the international visibility among peasants that socialism did among the urban workers.&lt;ref&gt;Hannu Immonen, ''The Agrarian Program of the Russian Socialist Revolutionary Party, 1900–1911'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar social movements ==
Agrarianism is not identical with the [[back-to-the-land movement]], but it can be helpful to think of it in those terms.  Agrarianism concentrates on the fundamental goods of the earth, communities of more limited economic and political scale than in modern society, and on simple living—even when this shift involves questioning the &quot;progressive&quot; character of some recent social and economic developments. Thus agrarianism is not [[industrial farming]], with its specialization on products and industrial scale.

== Agrarian theorists ==
The name &quot;agrarian&quot; is properly applied to figures from [[Horace]] and [[Virgil]] in ancient Rome. European theorists include  [[Pyotr Stolypin]] (1862–1911) and [[Alexander Chayanov]]&lt;ref&gt;Frank Bourgholtzer,  &quot;Aleksandr Chayanov And Russian Berlin,&quot; ''Journal of Peasant Studies,'' July 1999, Vol. 26 Issue 4, pp 13-53&lt;/ref&gt; (1888–1939) in Russia; [[Adolf Wagner]] (1835–1917), and Karl Oldenberg in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth D. Barkin, &quot;Conflict and Concord in Wilhelmian Social Thought,&quot; ''Central European History'' March 1972, Vol. 5 Issue 1, pp 55-71&lt;/ref&gt; and and [[Bolesław Limanowski]] (1835-1835) in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;K. J. Cottam, &quot;Boleslaw Limanowski, A Polish Theoretician Of Agrarian Socialism,&quot; ''Slavonic and East European Review,'' Jan 1973, Vol. 51 Issue 122, pp 58-74&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canadians ===
The most important Canadian theorist on Agranian politics was an American immigrant, [[Henry Wise Wood]], president of the [[United Farmers of Alberta]] (UFA) during that movement's time as the governing party of the province (1921–1935).  He, like many Canadian farmers of the era, conceived of farmers as a distinct social class in the midst of a [[class struggle]] against [[capitalists]] who owned the [[List of Canadian banks|banks]], [[list of Canadian railways|railways]], and [[grain trade|grain trading companies]] which profited from the efforts of farmers.  His solution was a kind of [[corporatism]] called &quot;group government&quot;.  In this scheme, people would be represented in government by a party or organization that defended the interests of their particular occupation or industry, not a particular ideology.  On the basis of this philosophy the UFA, as the representative of the farmers as a class, ran candidates only in rural area and not in the cities.  Instead they urged their urban sympathizers to vote for [[Labour candidates and parties in Canada|Labour]] candidates, as the representatives of the urban working class.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=ArchivedFeatures&amp;Params=A1142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008689&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of farmer-labour co-operation became common throughout [[Western Canada]], leading to the creation of the short-lived [[Progressive Party of Canada]] in the 1920s, and the more durable [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Farmer-Labour-Socialist)]] in Calgary, Alberta, in 1935, precursor to Canada's modern-day social democratic party, the [[New Democratic Party]].

===Americans===
In American history important spokesmen included [[Benjamin Franklin]], Thomas Jefferson, [[J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur]] (1735–1813), and [[John Taylor of Caroline]] (1753–1824)in the early national period.  In the mid-19th century important leaders included [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]] like [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803–1882) and [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862). After 1890 came philosopher [[Josiah Royce]] (1855–1916), botanist [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] (1858–1954), the [[Southern Agrarians]] of the 1920s and 1930s, novelist [[John Steinbeck]] (1902–1968), historian [[A. Whitney Griswold]] (1906–1963), environmentalist [[Aldo Leopold]] (1887–1948), [[Ralph Borsodi]] (1886–1977), and present-day authors [[Wendell Berry]] (b. 1934), [[Gene Logsdon]] (b. 1932), and [[Allan C. Carlson]] (b. 1949).

==Agrarian parties==
{{Main|List of agrarian parties}}
Peasant parties first appeared across Eastern Europe between 1860 and 1910, when  commercialized agriculture and world market forces disrupted traditional rural society, and the railway and growing literacy  facilitated the work of roving organizers. Agrarian parties advocated land reforms to redistribute land on large estates among those who work it. They also wanted village cooperatives to keep the profit from crop sales in local hands, and credit institutions to underwrite needed improvements.  Many peasant parties were also nationalist parties, because peasants often worked their land for the benefit of landlords of different ethnicity.

Peasant parties rarely had any power before World War I, but some became influential in the interwar era, especially in Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. For a while in the 1920s and 1930s there was a '''Green International''' ([[International Agrarian Bureau]]) based on the peasant parties in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Serbia. It functioned primarily as an information center that spread the ideas of agrarianism and combating socialism on the left and landlords on the right, and never launched any significant activities.

===Bulgaria===
In [[History of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]] (BZNS) was organized in 1899 to resist taxes and build cooperatives. BZNS came to power in 1919 and introduces many economic, social, and legal reforms. However conservative forces  crushed BZNS in a 1923 coup and assassinated  its  leader, [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]] (1879–1923). BZNS was made into a Communist puppet group until 1989, when it reorganized as a genuine party.

===Czechoslovakia===
In Czechoslovakia the [[Republican Party of Agricultural and Smallholder People]] often power in parliament as a partner in the five-party pětka coalition. The party's leader [[Antonin Svehla]] (1873–1933) was prime minister several times. The party was banned in 1945.

===Romania===
In [[History of Romania|Romania]], in 1919 older  parties from Transylvania, Moldavia and Wallachia merged to become the National Peasant Party. Iuliu Maniu (1873–1953) was prime minister with  an agrarian cabinet from 1928 to 1930, but the [[Great Depression]] made proposed reforms impossible.  The Communists  dissolved the party in 1947, but it reformed in 1989 after Communism collapsed.

===Serbia===
In Serbia [[Nikola Pašić]] (1845–1926) and his Radical Party dominated Serbian politics after 1903; they also monopolized power in Yugoslavia from 1918 to 1929; during the dictatorship of the 1930s, it furnished the prime minister.

===Poland===
In Poland [[Bolesław Limanowski]] thought deeply about Agrarianism and worked out an eclectic program that fit Polish conditions. His practical experience as a farm manager combined with socialist, &quot;single-tax,&quot; and Slavic communal ideas shaped his world view. He proposed a form of agrarian socialism with large state farms to counteract the inefficiency of very small holdings. In independent Poland he advocated expropriation of gentry estates. His observation of with peasant individualism convinced him that Poland should combine voluntary collectivism and individual possession of the leased land. His pragmatism left room even for private peasant ownership, despite his Marxism.&lt;ref&gt;Cottam, &quot;Boleslaw Limanowski, A Polish Theoretician of Agrarian Socialism,&quot; Slavonic and East European Review, Jan 1973, Vol. 51 Issue 122, pp 58-74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In Australia, the Country Party from the 1920s to the 1970s, promulgated its version of agrarianism, which it called [[National Party of Australia#Countrymindedness|&quot;Countrymindedness&quot;]].  The goal was to enhance the status of the graziers (operators of big sheep ranches) and small farmers, and justified subsidies for them.&lt;ref&gt;Rae Wear, &quot;Countrymindedness Revisited,&quot; (Australian Political Science Association, 1990) [http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/wear.rtf  online edition ]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Angle Symbol.svg|120px|thumb|right|∠, the angle symbol]]

In [[geometry]], an '''angle''' is the figure formed by two [[Ray (geometry)|rays]] sharing a common [[endpoint]], called the [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] of the angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{springer|id=A/a012500|title=Angle|year=2001|last=Sidorov|first=L.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnitude of the angle is the &quot;amount of rotation&quot; that separates the two rays, and can be measured by considering the length of circular arc swept out when one ray is rotated about the vertex to coincide with the other (see &quot;Measuring angles&quot;, below). Where there is no possibility of confusion, the term &quot;angle&quot; is used interchangeably for both the geometric configuration itself and for its angular magnitude (which is simply a numerical quantity).

The word ''angle'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''angulus'', meaning &quot;a corner&quot;. The word ''angulus'' is a diminutive, of which the primitive form, ''angus'', does not occur in Latin. [[Cognate]] words are the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{polytonic|ἀγκύλος}} ''(ankylοs)'', meaning &quot;crooked, curved,&quot; and the [[English language|English]] word &quot;[[ankle]]&quot;. Both are connected with the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*ank-'', meaning &quot;to bend&quot; or &quot;bow&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Slocum|first=Jonathan|year=2007
|url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/X/P0089.html
|title=Preliminary Indo-European lexicon&amp;nbsp;— Pokorny PIE data
|accessdate=2 Feb., 2010|publisher=[[Linguistics Research Center at UT Austin|University of Texas research department: linguistics research center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Note: ἀγκύλος rather than ἀνκύλος is correct, the γκ is a digraph pronounced [ŋk].--&gt;

[[Euclid]] defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each other. According to [[Proclus]] an angle must be either a quality or a quantity, or a relationship. The first concept was used by [[Eudemus]], who regarded an angle as a deviation from a [[straight line]]; the second by [[Carpus of Antioch]], who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines; Euclid adopted the third concept, although his definitions of right, acute, and obtuse angles are certainly quantitative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}; {{harvnb|Heiberg|1908|pp=177-178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This paragraph is quoted from EB1911, but its source seems to be Heath.--&gt;

==Measuring angles==&lt;!-- linked from [[Degree (angle)]] --&gt;
Two angles are sometimes called congruent if there exists an isometry that transforms one of the angles into the other angle. The size of an angle is normally characterized by the smallest positive rotation that maps one of the rays into the other. Two angles are congruent if and only if they correspond to the same (smallest positive) rotation. Thus an angle as two rays is characterized by an angle of rotation.  To avoid confusion when no isometry exists between particular representations of angles, angles that Euclid called &quot;equal&quot; are described as &quot;equal in measure&quot;.

In many geometrical situations, angles that differ by an exact multiple of a full circle are effectively equivalent (it makes no difference how many times a line is rotated through a full circle because it always ends up in the same place). However, this is not always the case. For example, when tracing a curve such as a [[spiral]] using [[polar coordinates]], an extra full turn gives rise to a quite different point on the curve.

[[Image:Angle measure.svg|right|thumb|The angle &lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt; is the quotient of &lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;.]]

In order to measure an angle &lt;var&gt;[[theta|θ]]&lt;/var&gt;, a [[circular arc]] centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn, e.g. with a pair of [[Compasses (drafting)|compasses]]. The length of the arc &lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt; is then divided by the radius of the circle &lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;, and possibly multiplied by a scaling constant &lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt; (which depends on the units of measurement that are chosen):

:&lt;math&gt; \theta = k \frac{s}{r}. &lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt; thus defined is independent of the size of the circle: if the length of the radius is changed then the arc length changes in the same proportion, so the ratio ''s''/''r'' is unaltered.

===Units===
In [[dimensional analysis]], angles are considered to be dimensionless.  There are several units used to measure angles, depending on the choice of the constant &lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt; in the formula above. Of these units, treated in more detail below, the ''degree'' and the ''radian'' are by far the most common.

With the notable exception of the radian, most units of angular measurement are defined such that one full circle (i.e. one ''[[Turn (geometry)|turn]]'') is equal to ''n'' units, for some whole number ''n''. For example, in the case of degrees, {{nowrap|1= ''n'' = 360.}} A full circle of ''n'' units is obtained by setting {{nowrap|1= ''k'' = ''n''/(2π)}} in the formula above. (Proof. The formula above can be rewritten as {{nowrap|1= ''k'' = θ''r''/''s''.}} One full circle, for which {{nowrap|1= θ = ''n''}} units, corresponds to an arc equal in length to the circle's [[circumference]], which is 2π''r'', so {{nowrap|1= ''s'' = 2π''r''}}. Substituting ''n'' for θ and 2π''r'' for ''s'' in the formula, results in {{nowrap|1= ''k'' = ''nr''/(2π''r'') = ''n''/(2π).}})

*The '''[[degree (angle)|degree]]''', denoted by a small superscript circle (°), is 1/360 of a full circle, so one full circle is 360°. One advantage of this old [[sexagesimal]] subunit is that many angles common in simple geometry are measured as a whole number of degrees. Fractions of a degree may be written in normal decimal notation (e.g. 3.5° for three and a half degrees), but the following sexagesimal subunits of the &quot;degree-minute-second&quot; system are also in use, especially for [[Geographic coordinate system|geographical coordinates]] and in [[astronomy]] and [[ballistics]]:
** The '''[[minute of arc]]''' (or '''MOA''', '''arcminute''', or just '''minute''') is 1/60 of a degree. It is denoted by a single prime (&amp;nbsp;′&amp;nbsp;). For example, 3°&amp;nbsp;30′ is equal to 3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;30/60 degrees, or 3.5 degrees. A mixed format with decimal fractions is also sometimes used, e.g. 3°&amp;nbsp;5.72′ = 3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5.72/60 degrees. A [[nautical mile]] was historically defined as a minute of arc along a [[great circle]] of the Earth.
** The '''[[second of arc]]''' (or '''arcsecond''', or just '''second''') is 1/60 of a minute of arc and 1/3600 of a degree. It is denoted by a double prime (&amp;nbsp;″&amp;nbsp;). For example, 3°&amp;nbsp;7′&amp;nbsp;30″ is equal to 3 + 7/60 + 30/3600 degrees, or 3.125&amp;nbsp;degrees.

[[Image:Angle radian.svg|right|thumb|&lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt; = &lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;/&lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt; rad = 1 rad.]]
*The '''angle of the [[equilateral triangle]]''' is 1/6 of a full circle. It was the unit used by the [[Babylonia]]ns{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, and is especially easy to construct with ruler and compasses. The degree, minute of arc and second of arc are [[sexagesimal]] subunits of the Babylonian unit. 1 Babylonian unit = 60° = ''π''/3&amp;nbsp;rad ≈ 1.047197551&amp;nbsp;rad.
*The '''[[radian]]''' is the angle subtended by an arc of a circle that has the same length as the circle's radius (&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt; = 1 in the formula given earlier). One full circle is 2''π'' radians, and one radian is 180/''π'' degrees, or about 57.2958 degrees. The radian is abbreviated ''rad'', though this symbol is often omitted in mathematical texts, where radians are assumed unless specified otherwise. When radians are used angles are considered as dimensionless. The radian is used in virtually all mathematical work beyond simple practical geometry, due, for example, to the pleasing and &quot;natural&quot; properties that the [[trigonometric function]]s display when their arguments are in radians. The radian is the (derived) unit of angular measurement in the [[SI]] system.
*The '''[[angular mil|mil]]''' is ''approximately'' equal to a [[milliradian]]. There are several definitions.
*The '''[[Turn (geometry)|turn]]''' (or '''full circle''', '''revolution''', '''rotation''', or '''cycle''') is one full circle. A turn can be subdivided in centiturns and milliturns. A turn is abbreviated &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; or ''rev'' or ''rot'' depending on the application, but just ''r'' in ''[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]'' (revolutions per minute). 1 turn = 360° = 2''π'' rad  = 400 gon = 4 right angles.
*The '''point''', used in [[navigation]], is 1/32 of a ''[[Turn (geometry)|turn]]''. 1&amp;nbsp;point = 1/8 of a right angle = 11.25° = 12.5&amp;nbsp;gon. Each point is subdivided in four quarter-points so that 1 [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] equals 128 quarter-points.
*The '''binary degree''', also known as the '''[[binary radian]]''' (or '''brad'''), is 1/256 of a [[Turn (geometry)|turn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080628051746/http://www.oopic.com/pgchap15.htm ooPIC Programmer's Guide (archived)] ''www.oopic.com''&lt;/ref&gt; The binary degree is used in computing so that an angle can be efficiently represented in a single [[byte]] (albeit to limited precision). Other measures of angle used in computing may be based on dividing one whole turn into 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; equal parts for other values of ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnhar/archive/2010/01/04/angles-integers-and-modulo-arithmetic.aspx Angles, integers, and modulo arithmetic] Shawn Hargreaves ''blogs.msdn.com''&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''quadrant'' is 1/4 of a ''[[Turn (geometry)|turn]]'', i.e. a '''[[right angle]]'''. It is the unit used in [[Euclid's Elements]]. 1 quad. = 90° = ''π''/2&amp;nbsp;rad = 1/4 turn= 100&amp;nbsp;gon. In German speaking languages the symbol &lt;sup&gt;∟&lt;/sup&gt; has been used to denote a quadrant.
*[[Eratosthenes]] used a unit of 6° so that a whole [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] was divided in 60 units.
*The [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]] sometimes used the unit pechus of about 2° or 2½°.
*The '''[[grad (angle)|grad]]''', also called '''grade''', '''gradian''', or '''gon''' is 1/400 of a ''[[Turn (geometry)|turn]]'', so one full circle is 400 grads and a [[right angle]] is 100 grads. It is a decimal subunit of the quadrant. A [[kilometre]] was historically defined as a [[centi]]-gon of arc along a great circle of the Earth, so the kilometre is the decimal analog to the [[sexagesimal]] nautical mile. The gon is used mostly in [[triangulation]].
*The astronomical '''[[hour angle]]''' is 1/24 of a full circle. Since this system is amenable to measuring objects that cycle once per day (such as the relative position of stars), the sexagesimal subunits are called '''minute of time''' and '''second of time'''.  Note that these are distinct from, and 15 times larger than, minutes and seconds of arc. 1&amp;nbsp;hour = 15° = ''π''/12&amp;nbsp;rad = 1/6&amp;nbsp;quad. = 1/24 turn ≈ 16.667&amp;nbsp;gon.

===Positive and negative angles===
In mathematics, the angle from the first to the second coordinate axis of a coordinate system is considered as positive. Therefore angles given a sign are '''positive angles''' if measured [[Clockwise and counterclockwise|anticlockwise]], and '''negative angles''' if measured [[Clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise]], from a given line. If no line is specified, it can be assumed to be the first coordinate axis ([[x-axis]]) in the [[Cartesian plane]]. In many geometrical situations a negative angle of −''θ'' is effectively equivalent to a positive angle of &quot;one full turn less ''θ''&quot;. For example, a clockwise rotation of 45° (that is, an angle of −45°) is often effectively equivalent to an anticlockwise rotation of 360°&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;45° (that is, an angle of 315°).

In three dimensional geometry, &quot;clockwise&quot; and &quot;anticlockwise&quot; have no absolute meaning, so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined relative to some reference, which is typically a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] passing through the angle's vertex and perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie.

In [[navigation]], [[bearing (navigation)|bearings]] are measured from north, increasing clockwise, so a bearing of 45 degrees is north-east. Negative bearings are not used in navigation, so north-west is 315 degrees.

===Alternative ways of measuring the size of an angle===
There are several alternatives to measuring the size of an angle by the corresponding angle of rotation.
The '''[[grade (slope)|grade of a slope]]''', or '''gradient''' is equal to the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] of the angle, or sometimes the [[sine]]. Gradients are often expressed as a percentage. For very small values (less than 5%), the grade of a slope is approximately the measure of an angle in radians.

In [[rational geometry]] the ''spread'' between two lines is defined at the square of sine of the angle between the lines. Since the sine of an angle and the sine of its supplementary angle are the same any angle of rotation that maps one of the lines into the other leads to the same value of the spread between the lines.

===Astronomical approximations===
Astronomers measure angular separation of objects in degrees from their point of observation.
* 1° is approximately the width of a little finger at arm's length.
* 10° is approximately the width of a closed fist at arm's length.
* 20° is approximately the width of a handspan at arm's length.

These measurements clearly depend on the individual subject, and the above should be treated as rough approximations only.

==Identifying angles==
In mathematical expressions, it is common to use [[Greek letter]]s (&lt;var&gt;α&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;β&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;γ&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;φ&lt;/var&gt;, ...) to serve as [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] standing for the size of some angle. (To avoid confusion with its other meaning, the symbol [[Pi|π]] is typically not used for this purpose.) Lower case roman letters (a, b, c, ...) are also used. See the figures in this article for examples.

In geometric figures, angles may also be identified by the labels attached to the three points that define them. For example, the angle at vertex A enclosed by the rays AB and AC (i.e. the lines from point A to point B and point A to point C) is denoted ∠BAC or BÂC. Sometimes, where there is no risk of confusion, the angle may be referred to simply by its vertex (&quot;angle A&quot;).

Potentially, an angle denoted, say, ∠BAC might refer to any of four angles: the clockwise angle from B to C, the anticlockwise angle from B to C, the clockwise angle from C to B, or the anticlockwise angle from C to B, where the direction in which the angle is measured determines its sign (see [[#Positive and negative angles|Positive and negative angles]]). However, in many geometrical situations it is obvious from context that the positive angle less than or equal to 180 degrees is meant, and no ambiguity arises. Otherwise, a convention may be adopted so that ∠BAC always refers to the anticlockwise (positive) angle from B to C, and ∠CAB to the anticlockwise (positive) angle from C to B.

*An angle equal to 1/4 turn (90° or ''[[pi|π]]''/2 radians) is called a '''[[right angle]]'''.
*:Two lines that form a right angle are said to be '''[[perpendicular]]''' or '''[[orthogonality|orthogonal]]'''.
*Angles equal to 1/2 turn (180° or two right angles) are called '''straight angles'''.
*Angles that are not right angles or a multiple of a right angle are called '''oblique angles'''.
*Angles smaller than a right angle (less than 90°) are called '''acute angles''' (&quot;acute&quot; meaning &quot;sharp&quot;).
*Angles larger than a right angle and smaller than a straight angle (between 90° and 180°) are called '''obtuse angles''' (&quot;obtuse&quot; meaning &quot;blunt&quot;).
*Angles larger than a straight angle but less than 1 turn (between 180° and 360°) are called '''reflex angles'''.
*Angles that have the same measure (i.e. the same magnitude) are said to be '''[[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]]'''. Following this definition for congruent angles, an angle is defined by its measure and is not dependent upon the lengths of the sides of the angle (e.g. all ''right angles'' are ''congruent'').
*Two angles opposite each other, formed by two intersecting straight lines that form an &quot;X&quot;-like shape, are called '''[[Vertical (angles)|vertical angles]]''' or '''opposite angles''' or '''vertically opposite angles'''. These angles are equal in measure.
*Angles that share a common vertex and edge but do not share any interior points are called '''[[adjacent angles]]'''.
*Two angles that sum to one right angle (90°) are called '''[[complementary angle]]s'''.
*:The difference between an angle and a right angle is termed the '''complement''' of the angle.
*Two angles that sum to a straight angle (180°) are called '''[[supplementary angle]]s'''.
*:The difference between an angle and a straight angle (180°) is termed the '''supplement''' of the angle.
*Two angles that sum to one turn (360°) are called '''explementary angles''' or '''conjugate angles'''.
*An angle that is part of a [[simple polygon]] is called an '''[[interior angle]]''' if it lies on the inside of that simple polygon. A [[Convex and concave polygons|concave]] simple polygon has at least one interior angle that exceeds 180°.
*:In [[Euclidean geometry]], the measures of the interior angles of a [[triangle (geometry)|triangle]] add up to ''π'' radians, or 180°, or 1/2 turn; the measures of the interior angles of a simple [[quadrilateral]] add up to 2''π'' radians, or 360°, or 1 turn. In general, the measures of the interior angles of a [[polygon|simple polygon]] with ''n'' sides add up to [(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''π''] radians, or [(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;180]°, or (''2n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;4) right angles, or (''n/2''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) turn.
*The angle supplementary to the interior angle is called the '''[[exterior angle]]'''. It measures the amount of rotation one has to make at this vertex to trace out the polygon. If the corresponding interior angle is a reflex angle, the exterior angle should be considered [[Negative number|negative]]. Even in a non-simple polygon it may be possible to define the exterior angle, but one will have to pick an [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] (or [[surface]]) to decide the sign of the exterior angle measure.
*:In Euclidean geometry, the sum of the exterior angles of a simple polygon will be one full turn (360°).
*Some authors use the name '''exterior angle''' of a simple polygon to simply mean the explementary (''not'' supplementary!) of the interior angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |urlname=ExteriorAngle |title=Exterior Angle}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conflicts with the above usage.
*The angle between two [[Plane (mathematics)|planes]] (such as two adjacent faces of a [[polyhedron]]) is called a '''[[dihedral angle]]'''. It may be defined as the acute angle between two lines [[Surface normal|normal]] to the planes.
*The angle between a plane and an intersecting straight line is equal to ninety degrees minus the angle between the intersecting line and the line that goes through the point of intersection and is normal to the plane.
*If a straight [[transversal line]] intersects two [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines, corresponding (as well as alternate) angles at the two points of intersection are equal in size; [[adjacent angles]] are [[supplementary angles|supplementary]] (that is, their measures add to ''π'' radians, or 180°).
*A '''reference angle''' is the acute version of any angle determined by repeatedly subtracting or adding 180 degrees, and subracting the result from 180 degrees if necessary, until a value between 0 degrees and 90 degrees is obtained. For example, an angle of 30 degrees has a reference angle of 30 degrees, and an angle of 150 degrees also has a reference angle of 30 degrees (180-150). An angle of 750 degrees has a reference angle of 30 degrees (750-720).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mathwords.com/r/reference_angle.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==A formal definition==
===Using trigonometric functions===
A Euclidean angle is completely determined by the corresponding [[right triangle]]. In particular, if &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is a Euclidean angle, it is true that

:&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta = \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

for two numbers ''x'' and ''y''. So an angle in the Euclidean plane can be legitimately given by two numbers ''x'' and ''y''.

To the ratio ''y''/''x'' there correspond two angles in the geometric range 0 &amp;lt; θ &amp;lt; 2π, since

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta } = \frac{\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}}{\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}} = \frac{y}{x} =  \frac{-y}{-x} = \frac{\sin (\theta + \pi)}{\cos (\theta + \pi) }. &lt;/math&gt;

==Angles between curves==
[[Image:Curve angles.svg|thumb|right|The angle between the two curves at P is defined as the angle between the tangents &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt; at &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt;]]
The angle between a line and a [[curve]] (mixed angle) or between two intersecting curves (curvilinear angle) is defined to be the angle between the [[tangent]]s at the point of intersection. Various names (now rarely, if ever, used) have been given to particular cases:—''amphicyrtic'' (Gr. ''{{polytonic|ἀμφί}}'', on both sides, ''κυρτός'', convex) or ''cissoidal'' (Gr. ''κισσός'', ivy), biconvex; ''xystroidal'' or ''sistroidal'' (Gr. ''ξυστρίς'', a tool for scraping), concavo-convex; ''amphicoelic'' (Gr. ''κοίλη'', a hollow) or ''angulus lunularis'', biconcave.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}; {{harvnb|Heiberg|1908|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Again, most of this paragraph is from EB1911 with Heath used as its source. --&gt;

==Dot product and generalisation==
In the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean plane]], the angle θ between two [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] '''u''' and '''v''' is related to their [[dot product]] and their lengths by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \cos(\theta)\ \|\mathbf{u}\|\ \|\mathbf{v}\|.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula supplies an easy method to find the angle between two planes (or curved surfaces) from their [[normal vector]]s and between [[skew lines]] from their vector equations.

==Inner product==
To define angles in an abstract real [[inner product space]], we replace the Euclidean dot product ( '''·''' ) by the inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\rangle = \cos(\theta)\ \|\mathbf{u}\|\ \|\mathbf{v}\|.&lt;/math&gt;

In a complex [[inner product space]], the expression for the cosine above may give non-real values, so it is replaced with

:&lt;math&gt;Re(\langle\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\rangle) = \cos(\theta)\ \|\mathbf{u}\|\ \|\mathbf{v}\|.&lt;/math&gt;

or, more commonly, using the absolute value, with

:&lt;math&gt; |\langle\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\rangle| = \cos(\theta)\ \|\mathbf{u}\|\ \|\mathbf{v}\|.&lt;/math&gt;

The latter definition ignores the direction of the vectors and thus describes the angle between one-dimensional subspaces &lt;math&gt;span(\mathbf{u})&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;span(\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt; spanned by the vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; correspondingly.

==Angles between subspaces==
The definition of the angle between one-dimensional subspaces &lt;math&gt;span(\mathbf{u})&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;span(\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt; |\langle\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\rangle| = \cos(\theta)\ \|\mathbf{u}\|\ \|\mathbf{v}\|&lt;/math&gt;

in a [[Hilbert space]] can be extended to subspaces of any finite dimensions. Given two subspaces &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U},\mathcal{W}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dim}(\mathcal{U}):=k\leq \operatorname{dim}(\mathcal{W}):=l&lt;/math&gt;, this leads to a definition of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; angles called canonical or [[principal angles]] between subspaces.

==Angles in Riemannian geometry==
In [[Riemannian geometry]], the [[metric tensor]] is used to define the angle between two [[tangent]]s. Where ''U'' and ''V'' are tangent vectors and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; are the components of the metric tensor ''G'',

:&lt;math&gt;
\cos \theta = \frac{g_{ij}U^iV^j}
{\sqrt{ \left| g_{ij}U^iU^j \right| \left| g_{ij}V^iV^j \right|}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Angles in geography and astronomy==
In [[geography]], the location of any point on the Earth can be identified using a '''[[geographic coordinate system]]'''. This system specifies the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of any location in terms of angles subtended at the centre of the Earth, using the [[equator]] and (usually) the [[Greenwich meridian]] as references.

In [[astronomy]], a given point on the [[celestial sphere]] (that is, the apparent position of an astronomical object) can be identified using any of several '''[[astronomical coordinate systems]]''', where the references vary according to the particular system. Astronomers measure the '''angular separation''' of two [[star]]s by imagining two lines through the centre of the [[Earth]], each intersecting one of the stars. The angle between those lines can be measured, and is the angular separation between the two stars.

Astronomers also measure the '''apparent size''' of objects as an [[angular diameter]]. For example, the [[full moon]] has an angular diameter of approximately 0.5°, when viewed from Earth. One could say, &quot;The Moon subtends an angle of half a degree.&quot; The [[small-angle formula]] can be used to convert such an angular measurement into a distance/size ratio.

'''Acoustics''' is the interdisciplinary science that deals with the study of all [[mechanical wave]]s in gases, liquids, and solids including [[vibration]], [[sound]], [[ultrasound]] and [[infrasound]]. A scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an [[acoustician]] while someone working in the field of acoustics technology may be called an [[Acoustical engineering|acoustical engineer]]. The application of acoustics can be seen in almost all aspects of modern society with the most obvious being the audio and noise control industries.  

[[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world, and [[speech]] is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and culture.  So it is no surprise that the science of acoustics spreads across so many facets of our society—music, medicine, architecture, industrial production, warfare and more.  Art, craft, science and technology have provoked one another to advance the whole, as in many other fields of knowledge.  [[Robert Bruce Lindsay|Lindsay's]] 'Wheel of Acoustics' is a well accepted overview of the various fields in acoustics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://www.physics.byu.edu/research/acoustics/what_is_acoustics.aspx |title=What is acoustics? |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word &quot;acoustic&quot; is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''ἀκουστικός'' (''akoustikos''), meaning &quot;of or for hearing, ready to hear&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%233396 Akoustikos] Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and that from ''ἀκουστός'' (''akoustos''), &quot;heard, audible&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%233397 Akoustos] Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn derives from the verb ''ἀκούω'' (''akouo''), &quot;I hear&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%233399 Akouo] Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Latin synonym is &quot;sonic&quot;, after which the term '''sonics''' used to be a synonym for acoustics&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=xNQrAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=catacoustics+sonics&amp;dq=catacoustics+sonics&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dCJ_TOO9BJH2tgPo94WSCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; and later a branch of acoustics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=1po8AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=sonics&amp;dq=sonics&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qiF_TMfRHYqisQPjhLH1Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA]&lt;/ref&gt; After acousticians had extended their studies to [[frequencies]] above and below the audible range, it became conventional to identify these frequency ranges as &quot;ultrasonic&quot; and &quot;infrasonic&quot; respectively, while letting the word &quot;acoustic&quot; refer to the entire frequency range without limit.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==History of acoustics==
=== Early research in acoustics ===

[[Image:Harmonic partials on strings.svg|thumb|250px|The [[Fundamental frequency|fundamental]] and the first 6 [[overtone]]s of a vibrating string.  The earliest records of the study of this phenomenon are attributed to the philosopher [[Pythagoras]] in the 6th century BC.]]

In the 6th century BC, the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Pythagoras]] wanted to know why some intervals seemed more beautiful than others, and he found answers in terms of numerical ratios representing the [[harmonic]] [[overtone series]] on a string.  He is reputed to have observed that when the lengths of vibrating strings are expressible as ratios of integers (e.g. 2 to 3, 3 to 4), the tones produced will be harmonious.  If, for example, a string sounds the note C when plucked, a string twice as long will sound the same note an octave lower.  The tones in between are then given by 16:9 for D, 8:5 for E, 3:2 for F, 4:3 for G, 6:5 for A, and 16:15 for B, in ascending order.&lt;ref&gt;C. Boyer and U. Merzbach. ''A History of Mathematics.'' Wiley 1991, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aristotle]] (384-322 BC) understood that sound consisted of contractions and expansions of the air &quot;falling upon and striking the air which is next to it...&quot;, a very good expression of the nature of [[wave]] motion.  In about 20 BC, the Roman architect and engineer [[Vitruvius]] wrote a treatise on the acoustic properties of theatres including discussion of interference, echoes, and reverberation—the beginnings of [[architectural acoustics]].&lt;ref&gt;ACOUSTICS, Bruce Lindsay, Dowden - Hutchingon Books Publishers, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amman Roman theatre.jpg|thumb|350px|Principles of acoustics were applied since ancient times : [[Roman theatre (structure)|Roman theatre]] in the city of [[Amman]].]]

The physical understanding of acoustical processes advanced rapidly during and after the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Mainly [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642) but also [[Marin Mersenne]] (1588–1648), independently, discovered the complete laws of vibrating strings (completing what Pythagoras and Pythagoreans had started 2000 years earlier).  Galileo wrote &quot;Waves are produced by the [[vibration]]s of a sonorous body, which spread through the air, bringing to the tympanum of the [[ear]] a stimulus which the mind interprets as sound&quot;, a remarkable statement that points to the beginnings of physiological and psychological acoustics.  Experimental measurements of the [[speed of sound]] in air were carried out successfully between 1630 and 1680 by a number of investigators, prominently Mersenne.  Meanwhile Newton (1642–1727) derived the relationship for wave velocity in solids, a cornerstone of physical acoustics ([[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]], 1687).

=== The Age of Enlightenment and onward ===

The eighteenth century saw major advances in acoustics as mathematicians applied the new techniques of calculus to elaborate theories of sound wave propagation. In the nineteenth century the major figures of mathematical acoustics were [[Helmholtz]] in Germany, who consolidated the field of physiological acoustics, and [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] in England, who combined the previous knowledge with his own copious contributions to the field in his monumental work &quot;The Theory of Sound&quot;.  Also in the 19th century, Wheatstone, Ohm, and Henry developed the analogy between electricity and acoustics.

The twentieth century saw a burgeoning of technological applications of the large body of scientific knowledge that was by then in place. The first such application was Sabine’s groundbreaking work in architectural acoustics, and many others followed. Underwater acoustics was used for detecting submarines in the first World War.  [[Sound recording]] and the telephone played important roles in a global transformation of society.  Sound measurement and analysis reached new levels of accuracy and sophistication through the use of electronics and computing.  The ultrasonic frequency range enabled wholly new kinds of application in medicine and industry.  New kinds of transducers (generators and receivers of acoustic energy) were invented and put to use.

The study of acoustics revolves around the generation, propagation and reception of mechanical waves and vibrations.

::[[File:Cause-effect diagram for acoustics.svg|med| The fundamental acoustical process]]

The steps shown in the above diagram can be found in any acoustical event or process. There are many kinds of cause, both natural and volitional. There are many kinds of transduction process that convert energy from some other form into acoustic energy, producing the acoustic wave. There is one fundamental equation that describes acoustic wave propagation, but the phenomena that emerge from it are varied and often complex. The wave carries energy throughout the propagating medium. Eventually this energy is transduced again into other forms, in ways that again may be natural and/or volitionally contrived. The final effect may be purely physical or it may reach far into the biological or volitional domains. The five basic steps are found equally well whether we are talking about an [[earthquake]], a submarine using sonar to locate its foe, or a band playing in a rock concert.

The central stage in the acoustical process is wave propagation. This falls within the domain of physical acoustics. In [[fluids]], sound propagates primarily as a pressure wave. In solids, mechanical waves can take many forms including [[longitudinal waves]], [[transverse waves]] and [[surface waves]].

Acoustics looks first at the pressure levels and frequencies in the sound wave. Transduction processes are also of special importance.

=== Wave propagation: pressure levels ===
{{Main|Sound pressure}}

[[Image:Oh No Girl Spectrogram 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Spectrogram]] of a young girl saying &quot;oh, no&quot;]]
In fluids such as air and water, sound waves propagate as disturbances in the ambient pressure level.  While this disturbance is usually small, it is still noticeable to the human ear.  The smallest sound that a person can hear, known as the [[Absolute threshold of hearing|threshold of hearing]], is nine orders of magnitude smaller than the ambient pressure.  The loudness of these disturbances is called the [[sound pressure level]] (SPL), and is measured on a logarithmic scale in decibels.

=== Wave propagation: frequency ===

Physicists and acoustic engineers tend to discuss sound pressure levels in terms of frequencies, partly because this is how our [[ears]] interpret sound. What we experience as &quot;higher pitched&quot; or &quot;lower pitched&quot; sounds are pressure vibrations having a higher or lower number of cycles per second. In a common technique of acoustic measurement, acoustic signals are sampled in time, and then presented in more meaningful forms such as octave bands or time frequency plots. Both these popular methods are used to analyze sound and better understand the acoustic phenomenon.

The entire spectrum can be divided into three sections:  audio, ultrasonic, and infrasonic.  The audio range falls between 20 [[Hertz|Hz]] and 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz.  This range is important because its frequencies can be detected by the human ear.  This range has a number of applications, including speech communication and music.  The ultrasonic range refers to the very high frequencies: 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz and higher.  This range has shorter wavelengths which allows better resolution in imaging technologies.  Medical applications such as ultrasonography and elastography rely on the ultrasonic frequency range.  On the other end of the spectrum, the lowest frequencies are known as the infrasonic range.  These frequencies can be used to study geological phenomena such as earthquakes.

Analytic instruments such as the [[Spectrum analyzer]] facilitate visualization and measurement of acoustic signals and their properties.  The [[Spectrogram]] produced by such an instrument is a graphical display of the time varying pressure level and frequency profiles which give a specific acoustic signal its defining character.

=== Transduction in acoustics ===

[[Image:3.5 Inch Speaker.jpg|thumb|200px|An inexpensive low fidelity 3.5&amp;nbsp;inch '''driver''', typically found in small radios]]
A [[transducer]] is a device for converting one form of energy into another.  In an acoustical context, this usually means converting sound energy into electrical energy (or vice versa).  For nearly all acoustic applications, some type of acoustic transducer is necessary.  Acoustic transducers include [[loudspeakers]], [[microphones]], [[hydrophones]] and [[sonar]] projectors. These devices convert an electric signal to or from a sound pressure wave. The most widely used transduction principles are [[electromagnetism]], [[electrostatics]] and [[piezoelectricity]].

The transducers in most common [[loudspeaker]]s (e.g. [[woofer]]s and [[tweeter]]s), are electromagnetic  devices that generate waves using a suspended diaphragm driven by an electromagnetic [[voice coil]], sending off pressure waves. [[Electret microphone]]s and [[condenser microphone]]s employ electrostatics. As the sound wave strikes the microphone's diaphragm, it moves and induces a voltage change. The ultrasonic systems used in [[medical ultrasonography]] employ piezoelectric transducers. These are made from special ceramics in which elastic vibrations and electrical fields are interlinked through a property of the material itself.

      <comment>/* Significant atomic physicists */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Atomic physics''' (or '''atom physics''') is the field of [[physics]] that studies atoms as an isolated system of [[electron]]s and an [[atomic nuclei|atomic nucleus]]. It is primarily concerned with the [[Electron configuration|arrangement of electrons around the nucleus]] and
the processes by which these arrangements change. This includes [[ions]] as well as neutral atoms and, unless otherwise stated, for the purposes of this discussion it should be assumed that the term ''atom'' includes ions.

The term ''atomic physics'' is often associated with [[nuclear power]] and [[nuclear bomb]]s, due to the [[synonym]]ous use of ''atomic'' and ''nuclear'' in [[standard English]]. However, physicists distinguish between atomic physics—which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons, and [[nuclear physics]]—which considers [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] alone.

As with many scientific fields, strict delineation can be highly contrived and atomic physics is often considered in the wider context of ''[[atomic, molecular, and optical physics]]''. Physics research groups are usually so classified.

==Isolated atoms==
Atomic physics always considers atoms in '''isolation'''. Atomic models will consist of a single nucleus which may be surrounded by one or more bound electrons. It is '''not''' concerned with the formation of [[molecule]]s (although much of the physics is identical) nor does it examine atoms in a [[solid state physics|solid state]] as [[condensed matter]]. It '''is''' concerned with processes such as [[ionization]] and [[excited state|excitation]] by photons or collisions with atomic particles.

While modelling atoms in isolation may not seem realistic, if one considers atoms in a [[gas]] or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] then the time-scales for atom-atom interactions are huge in comparison to the atomic processes that we are concerned with. This means that the individual atoms can be treated as if each were in isolation because for the vast majority of the time they are.  By this consideration atomic physics provides the underlying theory in [[plasma (physics)|plasma physics]] and [[atmospheric physics]]
even though both deal with huge numbers of atoms.

==Electronic configuration==
Electrons form notional [[Electron shells|shells]] around the nucleus. These are naturally in a [[ground state]] but can be excited
by the absorption of energy from light ([[photon]]s), magnetic fields, or interaction with a colliding particle (typically other electrons).

Electrons that populate a shell are said to be in a [[bound state]].  The energy necessary to remove an electron from its shell (taking it to infinity) is called the [[binding energy]].  Any quantity of energy absorbed by the electron in excess of this amount is converted to [[kinetic energy]] according to the [[conservation of energy]].  The atom is said to have undergone the process of [[ionization]].

In the event the electron absorbs a quantity of energy less than the binding energy, it will transition to an [[excited state]]. After a statistically sufficient quantity of time, an electron in an excited state will undergo a transition to a lower state.  The change in energy between the two energy levels must be accounted for (conservation of energy).  In a neutral atom, the system will emit a photon of the difference in energy.  However, if the excited atom has been previously ionized, particularly if one of its inner shell electrons has been removed, a phenomenon known as the [[Auger effect]] may take place where the quantity of energy is transferred to one of the bound electrons causing it to go into the continuum.  This allows one to multiply ionize an atom with a single photon.

There are rather strict [[selection rules]] as to the electronic configurations that can be reached by excitation by light—however there are no such rules for excitation by collision processes.

==History and developments==
The majority of fields in physics can be divided between theoretical work and experimental work,
and atomic physics is no exception. It is usually the case, but not always, that progress goes
in alternate cycles from an experimental observation, through to a theoretical explanation
followed by some predictions which may or may not be confirmed by experiment, and so on. Of course, the current state of technology at any given time can put limitations on what can be achieved experimentally and theoretically so it may take considerable time for theory to be refined.

{{Main|Atomic theory}}
One of the earliest steps towards atomic physics was the recognition that matter was composed
of ''atoms'', in the modern sense of the basic unit of a [[chemical element]]. This theory was developed by the British chemist and physicist [[John Dalton]] in the 18th century. At this stage, it wasn't clear what atoms were although they could be described and classified by their properties (in bulk) in a [[periodic table]].

{{Main|Basics of quantum mechanics}}
The true beginning of atomic physics is marked by the discovery of [[spectral line]]s and attempts to describe the phenomenon, most notably by [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]]. The study of these lines led to the [[Bohr atom model]] and to the birth of [[quantum mechanics]]. In seeking to explain atomic spectra an entirely new mathematical model of matter was revealed. As far as atoms and their electron shells were concerned, not only did this yield a better overall description, i.e. the [[atomic orbital model]], but it also provided a new theoretical basis for [[chemistry]]
([[quantum chemistry]]) and [[spectroscopy]].

Since the [[World War II|Second World War]], both theoretical and experimental fields have advanced at a rapid pace. This can be attributed to progress in computing technology which has allowed larger and more sophisticated models of atomic structure and associated collision processes.  Similar technological advances in accelerators, detectors, magnetic field generation and [[laser]]s have greatly assisted experimental work.

'''American Sign Language''', or '''ASL''', for a time also called '''Ameslan''', is the dominant [[sign language]] of [[Deaf American]]s, including [[Deaf community|deaf communities]] in the [[United States]], in the English-speaking parts of [[Canada]], and in some regions of [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yourdictionary.com/dictionary-articles/american-sign-language-worksheets.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although the United Kingdom and the United States share [[English language|English]] as a common language, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) is quite unlike ASL, and the two languages are not mutually intelligible. ASL is instead related to [[French Sign Language]]. 

Besides North America, ASL is also used, sometimes alongside indigenous sign languages, in the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[El Salvador]], [[Haiti]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ghana]], [[Togo]], [[Benin]], [[Nigeria]], [[Chad]], [[Gabon]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[Central African Republic]], [[Mauritania]], [[Kenya]], [[Madagascar]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Barbados]], [[Bolivia]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], Mauritania, and [[Jamaica]]. Like other sign languages, its [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] are distinct from any [[spoken language]], including English.

==Population==
It is frequently, and wrongly, stated that ASL is the third- or fourth-most-spoken language in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.gallaudet.edu/Library/Deaf_Research_Help/Frequently_Asked_Questions_%28FAQs%29/Sign_Language/ASL_Ranking_and_Number_of_Speakers.html&lt;/ref&gt; These figures misquote a survey that actually concluded that ASL speakers constituted the third-largest population requiring an interpreter in court in 1972; several other languages were more widely spoken, but many of their speakers were bilingual in English.&lt;ref name=ASLusers/&gt;

The 1972 survey was incomplete, and there has been no sound estimate since. It only surveyed deaf people on whether they signed &quot;well&quot;, it did not distinguish ASL from other sign languages, and it did not investigate how many hearing people among their friends and family, such as their children, might also sign. The 1972 data has been used to extrapolate an estimate that there were, ''at most,'' 500,000 home signers, both deaf and hearing, in the United States at the time, with an unknown percentage being ASL signers. The US population grew by 50% between then and 2010, and education for the deaf, including access to ASL, greatly improved. However, the number of profoundly deaf people in the country (approx. 2 million in the year 2000), a figure commonly given as the upper bound in ASL estimates, cannot be used, as the majority became deaf after age 65 and are unlikely to use ASL well, if at all.&lt;ref name=ASLusers/&gt;

==History of ASL==
[[Image:Sign language interpreter.jpg|thumb|A sign language interpreter at a presentation]]

{{Expert-subject|Languages|date=September 2008}}

In the United States, as elsewhere in the world, hearing families with deaf children have historically employed ad-hoc [[home sign]], idiosyncratic systems of hand gesture that do not amount to full [[language]], for rudimentary communication. There were however exceptions, such as the community of [[Martha's Vineyard]], where a large percentage of the population was deaf and the entire hearing population was able to sign a true sign language. Elsewhere the development of sign language required the emergence of deaf schools, which brought large numbers of deaf children together. The story of ASL begins with deaf education, Martha's Vinyard, and a local minister, [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]], who was enlisted by a father to educate his deaf daughter, [[Alice Cogswell]].

===Prior sign languages===
====France====
The French had a natural sign language, which is often referred to as [[Old French Sign Language]] (OFSL). OFSL was the language of a large community of Deaf people living in Paris. This language was passed down from deaf person to deaf person, and may be the oldest sign language of Europe. The Abbé [[Charles-Michel de l'Épée]] was the first to acknowledge that signed language could be used to educate the deaf.

An oft-repeated deaf folk tale explains Épée's role in the origin of LSF (and later, ASL): While visiting a parishioner, Épee met two deaf daughters conversing with each other using OFSL. The mother explained that her daughters were being educated privately by means of pictures. Épée was inspired by these deaf children and in 1771 established the first educational institution for the deaf.&lt;ref name=&quot;padden&quot;&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; He created a series of grammatical signs to represent French grammatical markers (called &quot;methodical signs&quot;) and taught those to his students so that they might learn grammatical French. At Épée's school, a large group of Deaf children lived together for the first time in France and it is this generation of native speakers which most likely developed OFSL into a full language. The combination of OFSL, methodical signs, and possibly other influences came together and evolved into French Sign Language, LSF, or langue des signes françaises.

====United States====
Little is known of sign languages in the United States before 1817. It is said that since there was little contact between communities in early America, home sign language was likely used most widely. However, a deaf community on [[Martha’s Vineyard]] in the late 17th century used [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language|a natural sign language]]. From 1690 to the mid-20th century there was a high rate of genetic deafness on Martha’s Vineyard caused by the [[founder effect]]. It afforded almost everyone frequent contact with sign language. It was said that 1 out of 155 people on the island was deaf, compared with 1 out of 5700 people in the rest of America during that time. The ancestry of the Martha's Vineyard deaf community could be linked to The [[Weald]], a small area in England, by way of [[Scituate]], Massachusetts.

====Plains Indians====
In 1541, 1688, 1740, 1805, and 1828 were reports that the [[Plains Indians]] developed a sign language to communicate between tribes of different languages. This sign language is believed to have developed in the lower [[Rio Grande]] prior to the Europeans settling and to have spread northward and become what is known as [[Plains Indian Sign Language]] (PISL). There is no evidence to show that it influenced the development of American Sign Language. By 1885, PISL had an estimated 110,000 users of various tribal dialects, but today it has only a small fraction of that number. It was not a language strictly for deaf people but an integral part of the language along with spoken components. It was also a commom language between tribes who had different spoken elements.&lt;ref&gt;Farnell, Brenda. ''Do You See What I Mean?  Plains Indian Sign Talk and the Embodiment of Action.'' University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln and London. 1995, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth of American Sign Language and American School for the Deaf===
In 1815, a Protestant minister, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, left his home in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]] to visit Europe. Dr. Mason Cogswell had asked Gallaudet to investigate methods of teaching his deaf daughter, Alice Cogswell. While in England, Gallaudet hit a roadblock when directors of the [[Thomas Braidwood|Braidwood Schools]], who taught the oral method, refused to share their methods of teaching. Nevertheless, while in [[London]], Gallaudet met with [[Abbé Sicard]], director of the Royal Institution for the Deaf in [[Paris]], and two of his students, one of whom was [[Laurent Clerc]]. Sicard invited Gallaudet to visit the school in Paris. He did not go immediately, but instead traveled to [[Edinburgh, Scotland|Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] where he again met the directors of Braidwood. They again refused to teach him their methods. Gallaudet then traveled to Paris and learned the educational methods of the Royal Institution for the Deaf with sign language, a combination of Old French Sign Language and the signs developed by Abbé de l’Épée.
Gallaudet persuaded Clerc to return with him to Connecticut and become a teacher for the deaf. Gallaudet and Clerc opened the Connecticut Asylum for the Education and Instruction of Deaf and Dumb Persons (now called [[American School for the Deaf]]) in April 1817. Deaf students were taught French signs and brought in signs of their own, such as those from Martha’s Vineyard. Thus, it was at this school that all these influences would intermingle and become what is now known as American Sign Language.

===Growth and standardization===
[[Image:ASL convention.jpg|thumb|American Sign Language Convention of March 2008 in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]]]]
Interestingly, because of the early influence of the sign language of France upon the school, the vocabularies of ASL and modern French Sign Language are approximately 60% shared, whereas ASL and British Sign Language, for example, are almost completely dissimilar. 

From its synthesis at this first public school for the deaf in North America, the language went on to grow. Many of the graduates of this school went on to found schools of their own in many other states, thus spreading the methods of Gallaudet and Clerc and serving to expand and standardize the language; as with most languages, though there are regional variations.

===Oralism vs. Manualism===
After being strongly established in the United States there was a bitter fight between those who supported [[Manualism and oralism|oralism over manualism]] in the late 19th century. Many notable individuals of high standing contributed to this debate, such as [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. The oralists won many battles and for a long time the use of sign was suppressed: socially and pedagogically. ASL was discouraged in schools for the deaf in many parts of the country at this time. Deaf teachers often were forced out of teaching to prevent deaf students from being exposed to sign language. Deaf children who did not progress adequately in oral programs were labeled &quot;oral failures&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cochlearwar.com/history/opposing_approaches.html History of ASL]&lt;/ref&gt; Many did not consider sign language to be a legitimate language. This was changed by [[William Stokoe]], a professor of English at [[Gallaudet University]] hired in 1955. He immediately became fascinated by ASL and began serious study of it. Eventually, through publication in linguistics journals of articles containing detailed linguistic analysis of ASL, he was able to convince the scientific mainstream that ASL was indeed a &quot;language&quot; on a par with any other.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===The modern language===
The language continues to grow, adding new signs for changes in culture and technology. For example, there is a [[wikt:Open8@Finger-TipUp-Open8@CenterChesthigh-TipUp Twist-Twist|sign for ''INTERNET'']] and a one for [[Video blogging|Video blog]] (the L hands, touching at thumb tips, rotate up from palm down to palm forward). Hip-hop has been signed on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1945421&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistics==
[[Image:ASL family.jpg|thumb|Two men and a woman signing.]]

ASL is a [[natural language]], as proven to the satisfaction of the linguistic community by William Stokoe, and contains [[phonology]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[semantics]], syntax and [[pragmatics]] just like [[spoken languages]]. Like other sign languages, it is a ''manual language'' and a ''[[visual language]]'': information is encoded not in sounds but with the shape and movement of the hands and other parts of the body, and with [[facial expressions]], including [[mouthing]]. Sign languages are commonly misunderstood as being gestural, but while [[gesture]] is used in sign languages just as it is in spoken languages (and indeed home sign ''is'' largely gestural), a sign ''language'' is fundamentally different from gesture in what it conveys and how it conveys it.

===Iconicity===
A common misconception is that signs are [[iconicity|iconically]] self-explanatory, that they are a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are [[pantomime]]. While it is true that sign languages typically have a higher degree of iconicity than do spoken languages (called [[mimesis]] or [[onomatopoeia]]), and pantomime does play a much extended role in sign languages compared to spoken language, most signs are in fact as arbitrary as non-mimetic words in spoken language. A large number of signs originated in mimesis or pantomime, but have become so abbreviated that their iconic origin is completely obscured. And even signs which are still transparently mimetic, such as the sign YOU (pointing at one's interlocutor), are typically used as if they were completely arbitrary. For example, children may make the mistake of using the spoken word &quot;you&quot; to refer to themselves, since others use that word to address them. Children acquiring ASL make similar mistakes; that is, they may point at others to mean themselves, indicating that even something as seemingly explicit as pointing is processed as an arbitrary sign in ASL. 

Klima and Bellugi{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} devised three categories of explicitness in signs: 
* Transparent: Non-signers can usually correctly guess the meaning
* Translucent: Meaning makes sense to non-signers once it is explained
* Opaque: Meaning has no apparent relation to the sign itself

The majority of signs are opaque, and non-signers cannot understand fluent sign language any better than they can an unknown spoken language.

===Grammar===
{{main|American Sign Language grammar}}

ASL grammar is completely unrelated to that of English. It lacks the inflections of English, such as [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[grammatical number|number]], and does not have [[grammatical article|articles]] such as &quot;the&quot;, but its spatial mode of expression has enabled it to develop an elaborate system of [[grammatical aspect]] that is absent from English. ASL grammar was obscured for much of its history by the practice of glossing it rather than transcribing it (see [[#Writing systems|Writing systems]] below), a practice which conveyed little of its grammar apart from word order.

== Dialects ==
ASL has many regional and subcultural dialects and accents. 
:&quot;Just as there are accents in speech, there are regional accents in sign. People from the South sign slower than people in the North&amp;mdash;even people from northern and southern Indiana have different styles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Lou Ann. (1987). A Loss for Words: The Story of Deafness in a Family. New York: HarperPerennial. p. 31. ISBN 0-06-091425-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional lexical variation===
The most obvious regional difference is in local signs. For example, there are more than six signs for BIRTHDAY in ASL, just as in English one can say &quot;couch&quot; and &quot;sofa&quot;, or &quot;soda&quot; and &quot;pop&quot;, to mean the same thing. As in English, such variants can reveal where a signer grew up or went to school.

===Black American Sign Language===
Black American Sign Language developed in [[racial segregation|segregated schools]] in the [[Southern United States]]. Much like [[African American Vernacular English]] versus standard English, it differs in vocabulary and grammatical structure from other varieties of ASL. It is considered a dialect of American Sign Language, with its own rules of grammar and a distinctive vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara F. Grimes and Joseph Evans Grimes.''Ethnologue''. page 361 (2000, Summer Institute of Linguistics International, ISBN 155671103)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fingerspelling==
[[File:ABC pict.png|thumb|240px|right|The American manual alphabet. Most of the letters are shown as the viewer would see them, but some (C, D, G, H, K, P, Q, and to a lesser extent F, O, X) are shown from the side for clarity.]]

{{main|Fingerspelling}}

In ASL, fingerspelling in the [[American manual alphabet]] is used primarily for spelling out names or English terms which do not have established signs. However, it is also used for emphasis (for example, fingerspelling #YES is more emphatic than signing YES), for clarity, and for instruction. 

Besides fingerspelling entire English words, ASL frequently incorporates the first letter of an English word into an equivalent ASL sign to distinguish related English concepts which do not otherwise have separate signs. For example, two hands tracing a circle is the sign for a group of people. Several kinds of groups can be specified by hand shape: when made with a 'C' hand shape, the sign means '''''c'''lass'', when made with an 'F' hand shape, [[wikt:9@RadialHand-PalmForward-9@CenterChesthigh-PalmForward RoundHoriz-RoundHoriz 9@UlnarHand-PalmBack-9@CenterChesthigh-PalmBack|'''''f'''amily'']]. Such signs are called [[initialized sign]]s. Only a small number of common signs are disambiguated through initialization in this way. However, a number of other signs incorporate a letter from English. The sign for ''elevator'', for example, is made by moving an 'E' hand shape up and down the extended index finger of the other hand, but there in no related sign with a different letter. 

With initialized signs, several otherwise non-phonemic hand shapes become distinctive. For example, outside fingerspelling there is but a single fist hand shape: the position of the thumb is irrelevant. However, within fingerspelling and initialisms, the position of the thumb on the fist distinguishes the letters A and S. Initialized signs which rely on such otherwise subphonemic distinctions tend not to be stable in the long run, but they may eventually create new distinctions in the language.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} For example, due to signs such as 'elevator', which require the 'E' hand shape, some argue that the 'E' hand shape has become phonemically distinct from the more relaxed clawed-hand shape that it was previously conflated with. 

In some cases, the fingerspelling of common English words has become [[lexicalization|lexicalized]], producing a class of signs known as ''loan signs'' or ''borrowed signs''. Over time, the sequence of letters may contract and become more fluid, at times to such an extent that they are no longer recognized as having originated in fingerspelling. Loan signs are usually glossed as the English word in all capital letters preceded by the pound sign (#). Loan signs are sometimes used for emphasis (like the loan sign #YES substituting for the sign YES), but sometimes are the only sign for a word, as in #NO. #NO is the most common loan sign. In this sign, the first two fingers are held together, as in the letters N, U, or H, and tapped twice against the tip of the thumb. (The tapping may be repeated for emphasis.) This movement is an abbreviation of fingerspelling N-O-N-O. Other common loan signs are #BACK, #BUS, #CAR, #JOB, #PIZZA, #YES, and #DOG. A [[typographic ligature|ligature]] of I-L-Y for &quot;I love you&quot; is very frequent, to the extent of becoming a greeting.

==Writing systems==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
[[File:ASL in Stokoe notation.png|right|thumb|The phrase &quot;American Sign Language&quot; in ASL, transcribed in Stokoe notation]]
[[File:ASL.png|110px|right|thumb|The phrase &quot;American Sign Language&quot; in ASL, transcribed in Sutton SignWriting]]

For much of its history, ASL was not written. It was instead [[Gloss#Glossing_signed_languages|glossed]] with English words written in all capital letters. However, there is no one-to-one correspondence between words in ASL and English, and the inflectional modulation of ASL signs—a dominant part of the grammar—is lost.

Since in spoken languages the elements of sound are for the most part produced linearly in time (that is, in a word like ''cat'' the ''a'' sound comes after the ''c'' sound, and the ''t'' sound comes after that), they can generally be easily written in a linear (one-dimensional) writing system such as an [[alphabet]]. There are only a few aspects which are produced simultaneously, such as tone in some languages, or [[vowel harmony|vowel]] and [[consonant harmony]], and which are therefore not straightforward to write with an alphabet. In sign languages, however, several channels operate simultaneously—hand shape, often with the two hands operating independently, hand location, hand motion, facial expression, mouthing—making an alphabetic script more complicated than just stringing letters together in the order sounds are produced. 

In the 1960s linguist William Stokoe created the first writing system for a sign language, the so-called [[Stokoe notation]], which he designed specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, with a letter or [[diacritic]] for every [[phonemic]] (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation of facial expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text. Stokoe used it for his 1965 ''A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles'', the first dictionary with entries in ASL—that is, the first dictionary which one could use to look up a sign without first knowing its conventional gloss in English. 

The usage of Stokoe's system is currently restricted to academic circles. A few candidates for written ASL have appeared in recent years, such as [[SignWriting|Sutton SignWriting]], Sign Script, and Si5s. None have reached widespread usage yet, but the door is open for future acceptance.

==ASL and Baby Sign==
{{main|Baby Sign}}

In recent years, researchers have shown that exposure to sign language has a positive impact on the socialization of hearing children. When infants are taught to sign, parents are able to converse with them at a [[Child development|developmental stage]] when they are not yet capable of producing vocal speech, which requires fine control of both breathing and the vocal tract.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} The ability of a child to actively communicate earlier than would otherwise be possible appears to accelerate language development and to decrease the frustrations of communication.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Many parents use a collection of simplified or ''[[ad hoc]]'' signs called &quot;baby sign.&quot; However, parents can learn to recognize their baby's approximations of adult ASL signs, just as they will later learn to recognize their approximations of oral language, so teaching an infant ASL is also possible. Typically, young children will make an ASL sign in the correct location and use the correct hand motion, but may be able only to approximate the hand shape, for example, using one finger instead of three in signing ''water''. Deaf children from deaf families will often &quot;babble&quot; in sign, just as their hearing counterparts [[babble]] in speech, making nonsensical hand gestures.

ASL has come a long way from its condemned days of banned use to being viewed as a grammatical language, which is the main form of communication in American Deaf culture.  Many parents today purchase “Baby Signs” DVD’s and books which incorporate ASL signs for infant and toddler communication.  “Baby Signs” was invented by Dr. Linda Acredolo and Dr. Susan Goodwyn in the early 1980s, and has become one of the newest trends in child development. 

However, there is an interesting contrast between the belief that exposure of signs to a hearing infant will aid them in language development. Whereas a Deaf infant at times must show the inability to learn a spoken language before they are taught sign language. This thought had originated due to the idea that sign language hinders the development of a spoken language in Deaf children (Mayberry, 2008).

{{Wiktionary|  applet}}

In [[computing]], an '''applet''' is any small [[application (computing)|application]] that performs one specific task that runs within the scope of a larger [[program (computing)|program]], often as a [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/applet?view=uk &quot;AskOxford: applet&quot;], Oxford Dictionaries.  Accessed on Jul 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;answers.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/applet &quot;applet: Definition from Answers.com&quot;], Answers.com.  Accessed on July 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  An applet typically also refers to [[Java applet]]s, i.e., programs written in the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language that are included in a [[web page]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abinomics.com/glossary/technology/a/Applet/ Applet | Abinomics.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Applet'' was first used in 1993 by the application [[AppleScript]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Applet as a standalone application==
Provided that an applet is hosted by an [[operating system]], it can function as any other normal software application but is small in size and performs only a small set of tasks.  Examples of applications often classified as applets are all of the accessories bundled in [[Microsoft Windows]] (such as [[Windows Notepad]] or [[Microsoft Paint]]). Applets are not full-featured application programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;answers.com&quot;/&gt;

==Applet as an extension of other software==
In some cases, an applet does not run independently.  These applets must run either in a [[Container (data structure)|container]] provided by a host program, through a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]], or a variety of other applications including mobile devices that support the applet programming model.

=== Web-based Applets ===
Applets are used to provide interactive features to web applications that cannot be provided by [[HTML]] alone. They can capture [[Mouse (computing)|mouse input]] and also have controls like [[Button (computing)|buttons]] or [[check box]]es. In response to the user action an applet can change the provided graphic content. This makes applets well suitable for demonstration, visualization, and teaching. There are online applet collections for studying various subjects, from physics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.falstad.com/mathphysics.html Paul Falstad online applet portal]&lt;/ref&gt; to heart physiology.&lt;ref name='hear'&gt;[http://thevirtualheart.org/CAPindex.html The virtual hearth]&lt;/ref&gt; Applets are also used to create online game collections that allow players to compete against live opponents in real-time.

An applet can also be a text area only, providing, for instance, a cross platform [[command-line interface]] to some remote system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcraft.com/jcterm/ Jraft.com]&lt;/ref&gt; If needed, an applet can leave the dedicated area and run as a separate window. However, applets have very little control over web page content outside the applet dedicated area, so they are less useful for improving the site appearance in general (while applets like [[news ticker]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.objectplanet.com/newsticker/ ObjectPlanet.com], an applet that works as news ticker&lt;/ref&gt; or [[WYSIWYG]] editors&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sferyx.com/ Sferyx.com], a company that produces applets acting as [[WYSWYG]] editor.&lt;/ref&gt; are also known). Applets can also play media in formats that are not natively supported by the browser&lt;ref&gt;[[Cortado (software)|Cortado applet to play ogg format]]&lt;/ref&gt;

HTML pages may embed parameters that are passed to the applet. Hence the same applet may appear differently depending on the parameters that were passed. 

Examples of Web-based Applets include:

* [[QuickTime|QuickTime movies]] 
* [[SWF|Flash movies]]
* [[Windows Media Player]] applets, used to display embedded video files in [[Internet Explorer]] (and other [[Web browser|browsers]] that support the plugin)
* [[3D modeling]] display applets, used to rotate and zoom a model
* [[Browser game]]s can be applet-based, though some may develop into fully functional applications that require installation.

===Applet vs. Subroutine===
A larger application distinguishes its applets through several features:{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

* Applets execute only on the &quot;client&quot; platform environment of a system, as contrasted from &quot;[[Java Servlet|servlet]]&quot;. As such, an applet provides functionality or performance beyond the default capabilities of its container (the browser).
* The container restricts applets' capabilities.
* Applets are written in a language different from the scripting or [[HTML]] language that invokes it. The applet is written in a compiled language, whereas the scripting language of the container is an interpreted language, hence the greater performance or functionality of the applet. Unlike a &quot;subroutine&quot;, a complete web component can be implemented as an applet.

==Java Applet==
{{Main|Java Applet}}

Java Applets can provide web applications with interactive features that cannot be provided by [[HTML]]. Since Java's [[bytecode]] is platform-independent, Java applets can be executed by browsers running under many platforms, including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Unix]], [[Mac OS]], and [[Linux]].  When a Java technology-enabled [[web browser]] processes a page that contains an applet, the applet's [[code]] is transferred to the client's system and executed by the browser's [[Java Virtual Machine]] (JVM).&lt;ref&gt;[http://java.sun.com/applets/ &quot;Applets&quot;], Sun Developer Network.  Accessed on July 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; An HTML page references an applet either via the deprecated &lt;APPLET&gt; tag or via its replacement, the &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_applet.asp &quot;HTML applet tag&quot;], W3Schools.  Access on July 21, 2009
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security==
Recent developments in the coding of applications including mobile and [[embedded system]]s have led to the awareness of the security of applets.

===Open Platform Applets===
Applets in an [[open platform]] environment should provide secure interactions between different applications.  A compositional approach can be used to provide security for [[open platform]] applets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Compositional&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=C80822F801CF3C52523CC038B29E97E0?doi=10.1.1.16.1254&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf

|accessdate=2010-04-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Advanced compositional verification methods have been developed for secure applet interactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Compositional&quot;/&gt;

===Java Applets===
A [[Java applet]] contains different security models:  [[Java_applet#Unsigned|unsigned Java applet security]], [[Java_applet#Signed|signed Java applet security]], and [[Java_applet#Self_signed|self signed Java applet security]].

===Web-based Applets===
In an applet-enabled [[web browser]], many methods can be used to provide applet security for malicious applets.  A malicious applet can infect a computer system in many ways, including denial of service, invasion of privacy, and annoyance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Controlling&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical solution for malicious applets is to make the web browser to monitor applets' activities. This will result in a web browser that will enable the manual or automatic stopping of malicious applets.  To illustrate this method, AppletGuard was used to observe and control any applet in a browser successfully.&lt;ref name=&quot;Controlling&quot;/&gt;

{{Speculative fiction}}
'''Alternate history''' or '''alternative history'''&lt;ref&gt;''Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2007) notes the preferred usage of &quot;Alternate History&quot; as well as its primacy in coinage, &quot;Alternate History&quot; was coined in 1954 and &quot;Alternative History&quot; was first used in 1977, pp.4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[genre]] of fiction consisting of stories that are set in worlds in which [[history]] has diverged from the actual history of the world. It can be variously seen as a sub-genre of [[literary fiction]], [[science fiction]], and [[historical fiction]]; different alternate history works may use tropes from any or all of these genres. It is sometimes abbreviated '''AH'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/Alternate+History+(fiction+genre) |title=AH |accessdate=2 January 2009 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another occasionally used term for the genre is &quot;allohistory&quot; (literally &quot;other history&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-all1.htm Allohistory] Michael Quinion, World Wide Words. 2002-05-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1950s, this type of fiction has to a large extent merged with science fictional [[trope (literature)|trope]]s involving cross-time travel between alternate histories or psychic awareness of the existence of &quot;our&quot; universe by the people in another; or ordinary voyaging uptime (into the past) or downtime (into the future) that results in history splitting into two or more time-lines. Cross-time, time-splitting and alternate history themes have become so closely interwoven that it is impossible to discuss them fully apart from one another. &quot;Alternate History&quot; looks at &quot;what if&quot; scenarios from some of history's most pivotal turning points and presents a completely different version, sometimes based on science and fact, but often based on conjecture. The exploration of how the world would look today if various changes occurred and what these alternate worlds would be like forms the basis of this vast subject matter.

In [[French (language)|French]], [[Italian (language)|Italian]], [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]] and [[German (language)|German]], alternate history novels are called ''uchronie''. This [[neologism]] is based on the prefix ''u-'' (as in the word ''[[utopia]]'', a place that does not exist) and the Greek for time, ''chronos''. An ''uchronie'', then, is defined as a time that does not exist, a &quot;non-time.&quot; This term apparently also inspired the name of the alternate history book list, ''uchronia.net''.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.uchronia.net/intro.html &quot;www.uchronia.net&quot;] (Retrieved 2010-09-03).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
In writing an alternate history, the author makes the conscious choice to change something in our past. According to [[Steven H Silver]], alternate history requires three things: 1) the story must have a [[point of divergence]] from the history of our world prior to the time at which the author is writing, 2) a change that would alter history as it is known, and 3) an examination of the ramifications of that change.&lt;ref name=SHS&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Steven H Silver]] | title=Uchronicle | url=http://www.helixsf.com/uchronicle/uchronicle0706.htm | work= | publisher=''Helix'' | date= | accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several genres of fiction have been confused as alternate histories. Science fiction set in what was the future but is now the past, like [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]] or [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] '', are not alternate history because the author has not made the conscious choice to change the past.&lt;ref name=SHS /&gt; [[Secret history]], works that document things that are not known to have happened historically but would not have changed history had they happened, is also not to be confused with alternate history.&lt;ref name=SHS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Evelyn C. Leeper]] | title=Alternate History 101 | url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/4824/ah101.htm | work= | publisher= | date=August 13, 2001 | accessdate=2009-05-26|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kmXXAhDa|archivedate=2009-10-25|deadurl=yes}} Another copy of the foregoing may be found at 'http://www.leepers.us/evelyn/ah101.htm' (retrieved 2010-09-03), and a different definition of &quot;secret history&quot; by the same writer may be found at 'http://www.leepers.us/evelyn/reviews/borges.htm' (retrieved 2010-09-03).&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternate history is related to but distinct from [[counterfactual history]]—the term used by some professional historians when using thoroughly researched and carefully reasoned speculations on &quot;what might have happened if...&quot; as a tool of academic historical research.&lt;ref name=counterfact&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Martin Bunzl]] | title=Counterfactual History: A User's Guide| url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/109.3/bunzl.html | work= | publisher=''American Historical Review'' | date= June 2004 | accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of alternate history literature ==
=== Antiquity and Medieval ===
The earliest example of an alternate history is Book IX, sections 17–19, of [[Livy]]'s [[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|''Ab Urbe condita'']]. Livy contemplated an alternative 4th century BCE in which [[Alexander the Great]] expanded his empire westward instead of eastward; Livy asked, &quot;What would have been the results for [[Roman Empire|Rome]] if she had been engaged in war with Alexander?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy09.html ''Ab Urbe Condita''] Titus Livius, Book 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;roads&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Dozois | first = Gardner | authorlink = Gardner Dozois | coauthors = [[Stanley Schmidt]] | title = Roads Not Taken: Tales of Alternate History | publisher = Del Rey | year = 1998 | location = New York | pages = 1–5 | isbn = 0-345-42194-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Turtledove | first = Harry | authorlink = Harry Turtledove | coauthors = [[Martin H.

In the late 11th century, [[Al-Ghazali]] discussed the possibility of alternate timelines and [[World History|world histories]] in ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''. In his defense of the Islamic [[Ash'ari]] doctrine of a [[Islamic creationism|created universe]] that is [[Temporal finitism|temporally finite]], against the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] doctrine of an eternal universe, Al-Ghazali proposed the [[Modal realism|modal]] theory of [[possible world]]s, arguing that their current world is the [[best of all possible worlds]] from among all the alternate timelines and world histories that God could have possibly created. His theory parallels that of [[Duns Scotus]] in the 14th century. While it is uncertain whether Al-Ghazali had any influence on Scotus, they both may have derived their theory from their readings of [[Avicenna]]'s ''Metaphysics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Possible Worlds in the Tahâfut al-Falâsifa: Al-Ghazâlî on Creation and Contingency|author=Taneli Kukkonen|journal=[[Journal of the History of Philosophy]]|volume=38|issue=4|year=2000|pages=479–502|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|doi=10.1353/hph.2005.0033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joanot Martorell]]'s 1490 [[Epic poetry|epic]] [[Romance (genre)|romance]] [[Tirant lo Blanch|''Tirant lo Blanc'']], written when the loss of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] was still a recent and traumatic memory to Christian Europe, tells the story of the valiant knight Tirant The White from Brittany who gets to the embattled remnant of the [[Byzantine Empire]], becomes a [[Megas Doux|Megaduke]] and commander of its armies, and manages to fight off the invading Ottoman armies of [[Mehmet II]], save the city from Islamic conquest, and even chase the Turks deeper into lands they had conquered before.

=== 19th century ===
One of the earliest works of alternate history published in large quantities for the reception of a popular audience may be the French [[Louis Geoffroy]]'s ''Histoire de la Monarchie universelle: Napoléon et la conquête du monde (1812–1832)'' (History of the Universal Monarchy: Napoleon And The Conquest Of The World) (1836), which imagines [[Napoleon]]'s [[First French Empire]] victorious in the [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1811 and in an invasion of England in 1814, later unifying the world under Bonaparte's rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;roads&quot; /&gt;

In the [[English language]], the first known complete alternate history is [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s [[short story]] &quot;[[P.'s Correspondence]]&quot;, published in 1845. It recounts the tale of a man who is considered &quot;a madman&quot; due to his perceiving a different 1845, a reality in which long-dead famous people are still alive such as the poets [[Robert Burns|Burns]], [[Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], and [[John Keats|Keats]], the actor [[Edmund Kean]], the British politician [[George Canning]] and even [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]].

The first novel-length alternate history in English would seem to be [[Castello Holford]]'s ''[[Aristopia]]'' (1895). While not as nationalistic as [[Louis Geoffroy]]'s ''Napoléon et la conquête du monde, 1812–1823'', ''Aristopia'' is another attempt to portray a utopian society. In ''Aristopia'', the earliest settlers in [[Virginia]] discover a reef made of solid [[gold]] and are able to build a [[Utopia]]n society in [[North America]].

=== Early 20th century and the era of the pulps===
A number of alternate history stories and novels appeared in the late 19th century and early 20th century (see, for example, [[Charles Petrie|Charles Petrie's]] ''If: A Jacobite Fantasy'' [1926]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacobite.ca/essays/if.htm &quot;If: A Jacobite Fantasy&quot; by Charles Petrie]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, British historian [[Sir John Squire]] collected a series of essays from some of the leading historians of the period in the anthology ''[[If It Had Happened Otherwise]]''. In this work, scholars from major universities as well as important non-university-based authors turned their attention to such questions as &quot;If the Moors in Spain Had Won&quot; and &quot;If [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] Had Had an Atom of Firmness&quot;. The essays range from serious scholarly efforts to [[Hendrik Willem van Loon]]'s fanciful and satiric portrayal of an independent 20th century Dutch city state on the island of [[Manhattan]]. Among the authors included were [[Hilaire Belloc]], [[André Maurois]], and [[Winston Churchill]].

One of the entries in Squire's volume was Churchill's &quot;If Lee Had Not&lt;!-- Please do not remove the word &quot;Not,&quot; it is part of the story's title --&gt; Won the Battle of Gettysburg&quot;, written from the viewpoint of a historian in a world where the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] had won the American Civil War, considering what would have happened if the North had been victorious (in other words, a character from an alternate world imagining a world more like the real one we live in, although not necessarily getting all the details right). This kind of speculative work, which posts from the point of view of an alternate history is variously known as a &quot;[[recursive alternate history]]&quot;, a &quot;double-blind what-if&quot; or an &quot;alternate-alternate history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=674 Churchill...and War]. The Churchill Centre.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of alternate history from this period (and arguably the first to explicitly posit [[Time travel in fiction|cross-time travel]] from one universe to another as anything more than a visionary experience) is [[H.G. Wells]]' ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923) in which several Englishmen are transferred via an accidental encounter with a cross-time machine into an alternate universe featuring a seemingly pacifistic and utopian Britain. When the Englishmen, led by a satiric figure based on Winston Churchill, try to seize power, the utopians simply point a ray gun at them and send them on to someone else's universe. Wells describes a [[multiverse]] of alternative worlds, complete with the paratime travel machines that would later become popular with U.S. pulp writers, but since his hero experiences only a single alternate world this story is not very different from conventional alternate history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200221.txt ''Men like Gods on Project Gutenberg'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1930s would see alternate history move into a new arena. The December 1933 issue of ''[[Astounding (magazine)|Astounding]]'' published [[Nat Schachner]]'s &quot;Ancestral Voices,&quot; quickly followed by [[Murray Leinster]]'s &quot;[[Sidewise in Time]]&quot;. While earlier alternate histories examined reasonably straightforward divergences, Leinster attempted something completely different. In his &quot;world gone mad&quot;, pieces of Earth traded places with their analogs from different timelines. The story follows Professor Minott and his students from a fictitious Robinson College as they wander through analogues of worlds that followed a different history.

A somewhat similar approach was taken by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] in his 1941 novelette [[Elsewhen]]. A professor trains his mind to move his body across timelines. He then hypnotizes his students so they can explore more of them. Eventually each settles in the reality most suitable for him or her. Some of the worlds they visit are mundane, some very odd, and others follow science fiction or fantasy conventions.

[[World War II]] produced alternate history for [[propaganda]]: both British&lt;ref&gt;Gavriel D. Rosenfeld, ''The World Hitler Never Made'', p39 ISBN 0-521-84706-0&lt;/ref&gt; and American&lt;ref&gt;Gavriel D. Rosenfeld, ''The World Hitler Never Made'', p97-99 ISBN 0-521-84706-0&lt;/ref&gt; authors wrote works depicting Nazi invasions of their respective countries as cautionary tales.

==== Time travel as a means of creating historical divergences ====
The period around the second World War also saw the publication of the [[time travel]] novel ''[[Lest Darkness Fall]]'' by [[L. Sprague de Camp]] where an American academic travels to the [[Italy]] of the [[Ostrogoths]] at the time of the Byzantine invasion led by [[Belisarius]]. De Camp's work is concerned with the historical changes wrought by his time traveler, Martin Padway, thereby making the work an alternate history. Padway is depicted as making permanent changes and implicitly forming a new time branch.

Time travel as the cause of a point of divergence (creating two histories where before there was one, or simply replacing the future that existed before the time traveling event) has continued to be a popular theme: in ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'', by [[Ward Moore]], the protagonist, who lives in an alternate history in which the South won the Civil War, travels through time and brings about a Union victory in the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].

When a story's assumptions about the nature of time travel lead to the complete replacement of the visited time's future rather than just the creation of an additional time line, the device of a &quot;time patrol&quot; is often used. Such an agency has the grim task of saving civilization every day, every hour, with patrol members—depicted most notably in [[Poul Anderson]]'s [[Poul Anderson#Time Patrol|&quot;Time Patrol&quot;]]—racing uptime and downtime to preserve the &quot;correct&quot; history. This is eventually revealed to be the one in which humanity transforms itself into a benevolent super-species that, amongst other achievements, creates time travel to ensure its own existence.

This can lead to terrible moral dilemmas. In ''[[Delenda Est]],'' the interference of time-travelling outlaws causes [[Carthage]] to win the [[Second Punic War]] and destroy [[Rome]]. As a result, there is a completely different 20th century—&quot;not better or worse, just completely different&quot;. The hero, Patrol Agent Manse Everard, must return to that period, fight the outlaws and change history back, restoring his (and our) familiar history—but only at the price of totally destroying the world that has taken its place, and which is equally deserving of existence. The stakes are the highest imaginable: billions of lives balanced against other billions of lives, for one man to decide. &quot;Risking your neck in order to negate a world full of people like yourself&quot; is how the hero describes what he eventually undertakes.

A more recent example is ''[[Making History (novel)|Making History]]'' by [[Stephen Fry]], in which a time machine is used to alter history so that [[Adolf Hitler]] was never born. A different leader rose to prominence in Nazi Germany, taking advantage of the economic downturn. This leader turns out to be more intelligent, charismatic and ruthless than Hitler. The outcome of this new leader results in Nazi success in World War II, the extermination of the entire Jewish population, a cold war between Germany and the US, and the prevention of post-war attitude changes that led to the decriminalization of homosexuality and the discrediting of racial segregation.

=== Cross-time stories ===
H.G. Wells' &quot;cross-time&quot;/&quot;many universes&quot; variant (see above) was fully developed by De Camp in his 1940 short story &quot;[[The Wheels of If]]&quot; (''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown Fantasy Fiction]]'', October 1940), in which the hero is repeatedly shifted from one alternate history to another, each more remote from our own than the last.

This subgenre was used early on for purposes far removed from quasi-academic examination of alternative outcomes to historical events. [[Fredric Brown]] employed it to satirize the science fiction pulps and their adolescent readers—and fears of foreign invasion—in the classic ''[[What Mad Universe]]'' (1949). In [[Clifford D. Simak]]'s ''[[Ring Around the Sun (novel)|Ring Around the Sun]]'' (1953), the hero ends up in an alternate earth of thick forests in which humanity never developed but where a band of mutants is establishing a colony; the story line appears to frame the author's anxieties regarding [[McCarthyism]] and the [[Cold War]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Also in the late 1940s and the 1950s, however, writers such as [[H. Beam Piper]], [[Sam Merwin, Jr.]] and [[Andre Norton]] wrote thrillers set in a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]] in which all alternate histories are co-existent and travel between them occurs via a technology involving portals and/or paratime capsules. These authors established the convention of a secret paratime trading empire that exploits and/or protects worlds lacking the paratime technology via a network of [[James Bond]]-style secret agents (Piper called them the &quot;[[Paratime series|paratime police]]&quot;).

This concept provided a convenient framing for packing a smorgasbord of historical alternatives (and even of timeline &quot;branches&quot;) into a single novel, either via the hero chasing or being chased by the villain(s) through multiple worlds or (less artfully) via discussions between the paratime cops and their superiors (or between paratime agents and new recruits) regarding the histories of such worlds.

The paratime theme is sometimes used without the police; [[Poul Anderson]] dreamed up the Old Phoenix tavern as a nexus between alternate histories. A character from a modern American alternate history ''Operation Chaos'' can thus appear in the English Civil War setting of ''A Midsummer's Tempest''. In this context, the distinction between an alternate history and a parallel universe with some points in common but no common history may not be feasible, as the writer may not provide enough information to distinguish.

Paratime thrillers published in recent decades often cite the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] (first formulated by [[Hugh Everett|Hugh Everett III]] in 1957) to account for the differing worlds. Some science fiction writers interpret the splitting of worlds to depend on human decision-making and free will, while others rely on the [[butterfly effect]] from [[chaos theory]] to amplify random differences at the atomic or subatomic level into a [[macroscopic]] divergence at some specific point in history; either way, science fiction writers usually have all changes flow from a particular historical point of divergence (often abbreviated 'POD' by fans of the genre). Prior to Everett, science-fiction writers drew on higher dimensions and the speculations of [[P. D. Ouspensky]] to explain their characters' cross-time journeys.

While many justifications for alternate histories involve a multiverse, the &quot;many world&quot; theory would naturally involve many worlds, in fact a continually exploding array of universes. In quantum theory, new worlds would proliferate with every quantum event, and even if the writer uses human decisions, every decision that could be made differently would result in a different timeline. A writer's fictional multiverse may, in fact, preclude some decisions as humanly impossible, as when, in ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'', [[Terry Pratchett]] depicts a character informing Vimes that while anything that can happen, has happened, nevertheless there is no history whatsoever in which Vimes has ever murdered his wife. When the writer explicitly maintains that ''all'' possible decisions are made in all possible ways, one possible conclusion is that the characters were neither brave, nor clever, nor skilled, but simply lucky enough to happen on the universe in which they did not choose the cowardly route, take the stupid action, fumble the crucial activity, etc.; few writers focus on this idea, although it has been explored in stories such as Larry Niven's ''All the Myriad Ways'', where the reality of all possible universes leads to an epidemic of suicide and crime because people conclude their choices have no moral import.

In any case, even if it is true that every possible outcome occurs in some world, it can still be argued that traits such as bravery and intelligence might still affect the relative frequency of worlds in which better or worse outcomes occurred (even if the total number of worlds with each type of outcome is infinite, it is still possible to assign a different [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] to different infinite sets). The physicist [[David Deutsch]], a strong advocate of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, has argued along these lines, saying that &quot;By making good choices, doing the right thing, we thicken the stack of universes in which versions of us live reasonable lives. When you succeed, all the copies of you who made the same decision succeed too. What you do for the better increases the portion of the multiverse where good things happen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0268.html &quot;Taming the Multiverse&quot;]. 2001-06-14.&lt;/ref&gt; This view is perhaps somewhat too abstract to be explored directly in science fiction stories, but a few writers have tried, such as [[Greg Egan]] in his short story ''The Infinite Assassin'', where an agent is trying to contain reality-scrambling &quot;whirlpools&quot; that form around users of a certain drug, and the agent is constantly trying to maximize the consistency of behavior among his alternate selves, attempting to compensate for events and thoughts he experiences but he guesses are of low measure relative to those experienced by most of his other selves.

Many writers—perhaps the majority—avoid the discussion entirely. In one novel of this type, H. Beam Piper's ''[[Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen]]'', a Pennsylvania State Police officer, who knows how to make gunpowder, is transported from our world to an alternate universe where the recipe for gunpowder is a tightly held secret and saves a country that is about to be conquered by its neighbors. The paratime patrol members are warned against going into the timelines immediately surrounding it, where the country ''will'' be overrun, but the book never depicts the slaughter of the innocent thus entailed, remaining solely in the timeline where the country is saved.

The cross-time theme was further developed in the 1960s by [[Keith Laumer]] in the first three volumes of his ''Imperium'' sequence, which would be completed in ''Zone Yellow'' (1990). Piper's politically more sophisticated variant was adopted and adapted by [[Michael Kurland]] and [[Jack Chalker]] in the 1980s; Chalker's ''[[G.O.D. Inc]]'' trilogy (1987–89), featuring paratime detectives Sam and Brandy Horowitz, marks the first attempt at merging the paratime thriller with the police procedural{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. Kurland's ''[[Perchance (novel)|Perchance]]'' (1988), the first volume of the never-completed &quot;Chronicles of Elsewhen&quot;, presents a multiverse of secretive cross-time societies that utilize a variety of means for cross-time travel, ranging from high-tech capsules to mutant powers. Harry Turtledove has launched the [[Crosstime Traffic]] series for teenagers featuring a variant of H. Beam Piper's paratime trading empire.

The concept of a cross-time version of a world war, involving rival paratime empires, was developed in [[Fritz Leiber]]'s Change War series, starting with the [[Hugo Award]] winning ''[[The Big Time]]'' (1958); followed by [[Richard C. Meredith]]'s ''Timeliner'' trilogy in the 1970s, [[Michael McCollum]]'s ''A Greater Infinity'' (1982) and [[John Barnes (author)|John Barnes']] ''Timeline Wars'' trilogy in the 1990s.

Such &quot;paratime&quot; stories may include speculation that the laws of nature can vary from one universe to the next, providing a science fictional explanation—or veneer—for what is normally fantasy. [[Aaron Allston]]'s ''Doc Sidhe'' and ''Sidhe Devil'' take place between our world, the &quot;grim world&quot; and an alternate &quot;fair world&quot; where the Sidhe retreated to. Although technology is clearly present in both worlds, and the &quot;fair world&quot; parallels our history, about fifty years out of step, there is functional magic in the fair world. Even with such explanation, the more explicitly the alternate world resembles a normal fantasy world, the more likely the story is to be labeled fantasy, as in Poul Anderson's &quot;House Rule&quot; and &quot;Loser's Night.&quot;

In both science fiction and fantasy, whether a given parallel universe is an alternate history may not be clear. The writer might allude to a POD only to explain the existence and make no use of the concept, or may present the universe without explanation to its existence.

=== Major writers explore alternate histories ===
In 1962, [[Philip K. Dick]] published ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'', an alternate history in which [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Imperial Japan]] won [[World War II]]. This book contained an example of &quot;alternate-alternate&quot; history, in that one of its characters is the author of a book in which the Allies won the war.

It was followed by [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle]]'' (1969), a story of incest that takes place within an alternate North America settled in part by Czarist Russia, and that borrows from Dick's idea of &quot;alternate-alternate&quot; history (the world of Nabokov's hero is wracked by rumors of a &quot;counter-earth&quot; that apparently is ours). Some critics believe that the references to a counter-earth suggest that the world portrayed in ''Ada'' is a delusion in the mind of the hero (another favorite theme of Dick's novels). Strikingly, the characters in ''Ada'' seem to acknowledge their own world as the copy or negative version, calling it &quot;Anti-Terra&quot; while its mythical twin is the real &quot;Terra.&quot; Not only history but science has followed a divergent path on Anti-Terra: it boasts all the same technology as our world, but all based on water instead of electricity. When a character in ''Ada'' makes a long-distance call, all the toilets in the house flush at once to provide hydraulic power.

[[Isaac Asimov]]'s short story ''[[What If--]]'' is about a couple who can explore alternate realities by means of a television-like device. This idea can also be found in Asimov's 1955 novel ''[[The End of Eternity]]''. In that novel, the &quot;Eternals&quot; can change the realities of the world, without people being aware of it.

[[Guido Morselli]] described the defeat of Italy (and subsequently France) in [[World War I]] in his 1975 novel ''Past Conditional'' (''Contro-passato prossimo'') where the static Alpine frontline which divided Italy from Austria during that war collapses when the Germans and the Austrians forsake trench warfare and adopt blitzkrieg twenty years in advance.

[[Kingsley Amis]] set his 1976 novel ''[[The Alteration]]'' in the twentieth century, but major events in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] did not take place, and Protestantism is limited to the breakaway Republic of [[New England]]. [[Martin Luther]] was reconciled to the Roman Catholic Church and later became [[List of fictional clergy and religious figures|Pope Germanian I]].

''[[The Plot Against America]]'' (2004) by [[Philip Roth]] looks at an America where [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] is defeated in 1940 in his bid for a third term as President of the United States, and [[Charles Lindbergh]] is elected, leading to increasing [[fascism]] and [[anti-Semitism]] in the U.S.

[[Michael Chabon]], also generally not an author of speculative fiction, contributed to the genre with his 2007 novel ''[[The Yiddish Policemen's Union]]''. This book explores a world in which the [[State of Israel]] was destroyed in its infancy and many of the world's [[Jews]] instead live in a small strip of [[Alaska]] set aside by the US government for Jewish settlement. The story follows a Jewish detective solving a murder case in the [[Yiddish]]-speaking city of [[Sitka]]. Stylistically, Chabon borrows heavily from the [[Hardboiled|noir]] and [[detective fiction]] genres, while exploring social issues related to Jewish history and culture.

=== Contemporary alternate history in popular literature ===
The late 1980s and the 1990s saw a boom in popular-fiction versions of alternate history, fueled by the emergence of the prolific alternate history author [[Harry Turtledove]], as well as the development of the [[steampunk]] genre and two series of anthologies—the ''What Might Have Been'' series edited by [[Gregory Benford]] and the ''Alternate ...'' series edited by [[Mike Resnick]]. This period also saw alternate history works by [[S.M. Stirling]], [[Kim Stanley Robinson]], [[Harry Harrison]], [[Howard Waldrop]] and others.

Since the late 1990s, Harry Turtledove has been the most prolific practitioner of alternate history and has been given the title &quot;Master of Alternate History&quot; by some.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6548135.html Master of Alternate History]&quot; by Melissa Mia Hall, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', 4/7/2008.&lt;/ref&gt; His books include those of [[Timeline 191]] (a.k.a. Southern Victory), in which [[Confederate States of America]] won the [[American Civil War]], and the [[Worldwar series]], in which aliens invaded Earth during [[World War II]]. Other stories by Turtledove include ''[[A Different Flesh]]'', in which [[Americas|America]] was not colonized from [[Asia]] during the last [[ice age]]; ''[[In the Presence of Mine Enemies]]'', in which the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] won World War II; and ''[[Ruled Britannia]]'', in which the [[Spanish Armada]] succeeded in conquering Britain in the [[Elizabethan era]], with [[William Shakespeare]] being given the task of writing the play that will motivate the Britons to rise up against their [[Spain|Spanish]] conquerors. He also co-authored a book with actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]] ''[[The Two Georges]]'', in which the United Kingdom retained the American colonies, with [[George Washington]] and [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] making peace. He did a two-volume series in which the Japanese not only [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombed Pearl Harbor]] but also invaded and occupied the Hawaiian Islands.

Perhaps the most incessantly explored theme in popular alternate history focuses on worlds in which the Nazis won World War Two. In some versions, the Nazis and/or [[Axis Powers]] conquer the entire world; in others, they conquer most of the world but a &quot;Fortress America&quot; exists under siege; while in others, there is a Nazi/Japanese [[Cold War]] comparable to the US/Soviet equivalent in 'our' timeline. ''[[Fatherland (novel)|Fatherland]]'' (1992) by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]], set in Europe following the Nazi victory, has been widely praised for portraying a more believable society and series of events than most other novels set in a world after a Nazi victory.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Several writers have posited points of departure for such a world but then have injected time splitters from the future or paratime travel for instance [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]]'s ''[[The Proteus Operation]]''. [[Norman Spinrad]] wrote ''[[The Iron Dream]]'' in 1972, which is intended to be a science fiction novel written by [[Adolf Hitler]] after fleeing from Europe to North America in the 1920s. In [[Jo Walton]]'s &quot;Small Change&quot; series, the United Kingdom made peace with Hitler before the involvement of the United States in World War II, and fascism slowly strangled the UK. Former House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] and [[William R. Forstchen]] have written a novel, ''[[1945 (Gingrich novel)|1945]]'', in which the U.S. defeated [[Japan]] but not [[Germany]] in World War II, resulting in a Cold War with Germany rather than the Soviet Union. Gingrich and Fortschen neglected to write the promised sequel; instead, they wrote a trilogy about the American Civil War, starting with ''[[Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War]]'', in which the Confederates win a victory at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Also from that general era, [[Martin Cruz Smith]], in his first novel, posited an independent American Indian nation following the defeat of Custer in ''The Indians Won'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Wroe, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2005/mar/26/featuresreviews.guardianreview15 Profile: Martin Cruz Smith], ''The Guardian'', 26 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' in 1981, [[L. Neil Smith]] wrote several novels that postulated the disintegration of the U.S. Federal Government during the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] and the creation of a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] utopia.

A recent time traveling splitter variant involves entire communities being shifted elsewhere to become the unwitting creators of new time branches. These communities are transported from the present (or the near-future) to the past or to another time-line via a natural disaster, the action of technologically advanced aliens, or a human experiment gone wrong. [[S. M. Stirling]] wrote the ''[[Island in the Sea of Time]]'' trilogy, in which [[Nantucket]] Island and all its modern inhabitants are transported to [[Bronze Age]] times to become the world's first superpower. In [[Eric Flint]]'s [[1632 series]], a small town in [[West Virginia]] is transported to 17th century central Europe and drastically changes the course of the [[Thirty Years' War]], which was then underway. [[John Birmingham]]'s [[Axis of Time]] trilogy deals with the culture shock when a United Nations naval task force from 2021 finds itself back in 1942 helping the Allies against the [[Empire of Japan]] and the Germans (and doing almost as much harm as good in spite of its advanced weapons). Similarly, [[Robert Charles Wilson]]'s ''[[Mysterium (novel)|Mysterium]]'' depicts a failed U.S. government experiment which transports a small American town into an alternative version of the U.S. run by believers in a form of Christianity known as [[Gnosticism]], who are engaged in a bitter war with the &quot;Spanish&quot; in Mexico. (The chief scientist at the laboratory where the experiment occurred is described as a Gnostic, and references to Christian Gnosticism appear repeatedly in the book.)

=== Alternate history in the contemporary fantasy genre ===
Many fantasies and science fantasies are set in a world that has a history somewhat similar to our own world, but with magic added. Some posit points of divergence, but some also feature magic altering history all along. One example of a universe that is in part historically recognizable but also obeys different physical laws is Poul Anderson's ''[[Three Hearts and Three Lions]]'' in which the [[Matter of France]] is history, and the fairy folk are real and powerful. A partly familiar European history for which the author provides a point of divergence is [[Randall Garrett]]'s &quot;[[Lord Darcy (fiction)|Lord Darcy]]&quot; series: a monk systemizing magic rather than science, so the use of [[Digitalis|foxglove]] to treat heart disease is called superstition.

''[[Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell]]'' takes place in an alternative version of England where a separate Kingdom ruled by the Raven King and founded on magic existed in Northumbria for over 300 years. In [[Patricia Wrede]]'s Regency fantasies, Great Britain has a Royal Society of Wizards, and in Poul Anderson's ''[[A Midsummer Tempest]]'' William Shakespeare is remembered as the Great Historian, with the novel itself taking place in the era of [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], with an alternate outcome for the [[English Civil War]] and an earlier [[Industrial Revolution]].

''[[The Tales of Alvin Maker]]'' series by [[Orson Scott Card]] (a parallel to the life of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]) takes place in an alternate America, beginning in the early 19th century. Prior to that time, a POD occurred: England, under the control of Oliver Cromwell, had banished &quot;makers&quot;, or anyone else demonstrating &quot;knacks&quot; (an ability to perform seemingly supernatural feats) to the North American continent. Thus the early American colonists embraced as perfectly ordinary these gifts, and counted on them as a part of their daily lives. The political divisions of the continent is considerably altered, with two large English colonies bookending a smaller &quot;American&quot; nation, one aligned with England, and the other governed by exiled [[Cavaliers]]. Actual historical figures are seen in a much different light: Ben Franklin is revered as the continent's finest &quot;maker&quot;, George Washington was executed at the hands of an English army, and &quot;Tom&quot; Jefferson is the first president of &quot;Apallachee&quot;, the result of a compromise between the Continentals and the British.

On the other hand, when the &quot;Old Ones&quot; still manifest themselves in England in [[Keith Roberts]]'s ''[[Pavane (novel)|Pavane]]'', which takes place in a technologically backward world after a Spanish assassination of Elizabeth I allowed the Spanish Armada to conquer England, the possibility that the fairies were real but retreated from modern advances makes the POD possible: the fairies really were present all along, in a secret history. Again, in the English Renaissance fantasy ''Armor of Light'' by [[Melissa Scott (writer)|Melissa Scott]] and Lisa A. Barnett, the magic used in the book, by Dr. [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and others, actually was practiced in the Renaissance; positing a secret history of effective magic makes this an alternate history with a POD, Sir [[Philip Sidney]]'s surviving the Battle of Zutphen, and shortly there after saving the life of [[Christopher Marlowe]].

Many works of fantasy posit a world in which known practitioners of magic were able to make it function, and where the consequences of such reality would not, in fact, disturb history to such an extent as to make it plainly alternate history. Many ambiguous alternate/secret histories are set in Renaissance or pre-Renaissance times, and may explicitly include a &quot;retreat&quot; from the world, which would explain the current absence of such phenomena.

When the magical version of our world's history is set in contemporary times, the distinction becomes clear between alternate history on the one hand and [[contemporary fantasy]], using in effect a form of secret history (as when [[Josepha Sherman]]'s ''Son of Darkness'' has an elf living in New York City, in disguise) on the other. In works such as [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''Magic, Incorporated'' where a construction company can use magic to rig up stands at a sporting event and Poul Anderson's ''[[Operation Chaos (novel)|Operation Chaos]]'' and its sequel ''[[Operation Luna]]'', where djinns are serious weapons of war—with atomic bombs—the use of magic throughout the United States and other modern countries makes it clear that this is not secret history—although references in ''Operation Chaos'' to [[degaussing]] the effects of cold iron make it possible that it is the result of a POD. The sequel clarifies this as the result of a collaboration of Einstein and Planck in 1901, resulting in the theory of &quot;rheatics&quot;. [[Henry Moseley]] applies this theory to &quot;degauss the effects of cold iron and release the goetic forces.&quot; This results in the suppression of [[ferromagnetism]] and the reemergence of magic and magical creatures.

Alternate history shades off into other [[fantasy subgenres]] when the use of actual, though altered, history and geography decreases, although a culture may still be clearly the original source; [[Barry Hughart]]'s ''[[Bridge of Birds]]'' and its sequels take place in a [[fantasy world]], albeit one clearly based on China, and with allusions to actual Chinese history, such as [[Empress Wu of Zhou|the Empress Wu]]. [[Richard Garfinkle]]'s ''[[Celestial Matters]]'' incorporates ancient Chinese physics and Greek [[Aristotelian physics]], using them as if factual.

A fantasy version of the paratime police was developed by children's writer [[Diana Wynne Jones]] in her ''[[Chrestomanci]]'' quartet (1977–1988), with wizards taking the place of high tech secret agents. Among the novels in this series, ''[[Witch Week]]'' stands out for its vivid depiction of a history alternate to that of Chrestomanci's own world rather than our own (and yet with a specific POD that turned it away from the &quot;normal&quot; history of most worlds visited by the wizard).

Terry Pratchett's works includes several references to alternate histories of ''[[Discworld]]''. ''[[Men At Arms]]'' observes that in millions of universes, Edward d'Eath became an obsessive recluse rather than the instigator of the plot that he is in the novel. In ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'', Vimes accidentally picks up a pocket organizer that should have gone down another leg of the Trousers of Time, and so can hear the organizer reporting on the deaths that would have occurred had his decision gone otherwise. Indeed, Discworld contains an equivalent of the Time Patrol in its [[History Monks]]. ''Night Watch'' revolves around a repair of history after a time traveler's murder of an important figure in Vimes's past. ''[[Thief of Time]]'' presents them functioning as a full-scale Time Patrol, ensuring that history occurs at all.

== Alternate history in other media ==
===Radio===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
In 1953, the [[NBC#Radio|NBC radio network]] aired a show called ''[[Stroke of Fate]]'' that posited different point of divergence creating an alternate time-line for each episode and dramatized the results along with commentary from various historians. Episodes included changes in the American Civil War, Alexander the Great surviving his illness, an alternate fate for [[James Wolfe]] at [[Quebec City]], no [[Julius Caesar]] assassination, a different outcome of [[Aaron Burr]]'s duel amongst other stories. All episodes have been preserved.

The idea of an alternate history was used for satiric and comedic effect in the BBC Radio comedy ''[[Married (radio series)|Married]]''. The protagonist, a confirmed bachelor, awakes one morning in a world where he has a wife and two children, and people familiar to him are radically changed. One historical divergence in this world, exploited mostly for comedy, was the decision of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] not to abdicate in 1936. His heirs were a King Richard and a King John, the latter of whom was openly homosexual.

===Films===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
Several films have been made that exploit the concepts of alternate history, most notably [[Kevin Brownlow]]'s ''[[It Happened Here]]'' (1966), depicting a Nazi-occupied Britain. Other alternate history films include the HBO TV movie ''[[Fatherland (novel)#Film, TV or theatrical adaptations|Fatherland]]'' (1994), set in the 1960s in a world where Germany won World War II, based on [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]'s novel of the same name. Although foretelling a world where Germany is poised to be defeated in World War II, [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Inglorious Bastards (2009 film)|Inglourious Basterds]]'' offers a satirical revenge fantasy where a plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler succeeds.

Alternate histories in film are sometimes presented as [[mockumentaries]] to provide [[verisimilitude (literature)|verisimilitude]] to fictional events, including ''[[C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America]]'' (2004), a satirical look at the history of an America where the South won the Civil War.

Other examples of cinematic alternate history are: ''[[2009 Lost Memories]]'' (2002), a Korean film supposing that [[Hirobumi Ito]] was not assassinated by [[An Jung-geun]] in Harbin, China, in 1909; and ''[[Timequest (film)|Timequest]]'' (2002), in which a time traveler prevents the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]], resulting in an altered subsequent history.

In [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|''Super Mario Bros.'' (1993)]], 65 million years ago, a meteorite crashed into the Earth, and in doing so ripped the universe into two parallel dimensions. In this world a human-like race evolved from dinosaurs rather than the mammals. 

A few movies about alternative universes focus on individuals rather than historical events, for example, [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', and more recently the [[Back to the Future trilogy|''Back to the Future'' series of films]], ''Blind Chance'', ''[[Sliding Doors]]'', ''[[Run Lola Run]]'', ''[[Me Myself I (film)|Me Myself I]]'', ''[[The Butterfly Effect]]'', ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'', ''[[Frequency (film)|Frequency]]'' and ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]''.

===Television===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
Several TV series also exploit the concept of alternate history. The science fiction [[television show]] ''[[Sliders]]'' presented alternate histories under the science-inspired guise of quantum-navigating the [[Multiverse (science)|multiverse]]. The vast majority of alternate Americas in most episodes are nasty [[dystopias]], although sometimes this is not evident at first.

In ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', the characters time travel to 1977 past and attempt to create an alternate history. However, while the only intended ramifications were for Flight 815 to land in Los Angeles, instead, it is revealed that their actions were the cause of the crash, ultimately.

Other non-alternate history television shows have explored the concept. ''[[Star Trek]]'' has used the theme several times. Examples include: [[Star Trek: The Original Series|TOS]]—&quot;[[The City on the Edge of Forever]]&quot; (alternate World War II outcome); [[Star Trek: The Animated Series|Animated Series]]—&quot;[[Yesteryear (Star Trek: The Animated Series)|Yesteryear]]&quot;; [[Star Trek: The Next Generation|NG]]—&quot;[[Yesterday's Enterprise]]&quot;, and [[Star trek enterprise|Enterprise]]'s &quot;[[Storm Front (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Storm Front]]&quot; Also, the universe of &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;, while in the original episode was just implied to be a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]], was in later episodes (of DS9 and Enterprise) shown to have an alternate history.

The British TV series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' had a few episodes that involved an alternate Earth where [[Pete Tyler]], father of [[Rose Tyler]], was alive, successful, and rich, unlike the Pete Tyler on the original Earth, who died when Rose was a baby and had been unsuccessful in business. [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Tenth Doctor]], Rose, and [[Mickey Smith]] visited the alternate Earth by accident in &quot;[[Rise of the Cybermen]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Age of Steel]]&quot;. The second season finale &quot;[[Army of Ghosts]]&quot; and &quot;[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]&quot; also involved travel to the same alternate Earth, and the series four episode &quot;[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]&quot; showed an alternate history where the Tenth Doctor has been killed during [[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|the Racnoss attack]]. During the [[Third Doctor]]'s tenure he visited an alternative Earth with a fascist-style British Government (and fascist counterparts of his friends/companions [[Liz Shaw]], [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]] and [[Sergeant Benton]]) in [[Inferno (Doctor Who)|Inferno]].

In the seventies SF children's series ''[[The Tomorrow People]]'', &quot;A Stitch in Time&quot; (1974) depicted an attempted historical change by [[time travel]]lers from an alternate-universe [[Roman Empire]] that developed [[steam engines]] in the first century, never fell as a result, had a 1,500-year technological head-start over our own world and by its &quot;20th century,&quot; controlled a galactic empire.

In the ''[[Twilight Zone]]'' episode &quot;[[The Parallel]],&quot; an astronaut is transported to an alternate Earth where history plays out differently, but no-one believes him when he discovers this.

Various [[anime]] productions have also used the genre:
*''[[Zipang (anime)|Zipang]]'' (based on a [[manga]] of the same name), involves a modern [[Aegis combat system|Aegis]] class destroyer of the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] being thrown back in time to the [[Battle of Midway]] in 1942. The presence of the ship and its crew, their advanced technology and knowledge of the future, change the course of World War II and create an alternate timeline.

*''[[Konpeki no Kantai]]'' (lit. Deep Blue Fleet) depicts a hyper-advanced Japanese navy defeating the [[United States]] in [[World War II]]. Subsequently, Japan, Britain and the United States join forces to defeat [[Nazi Germany]].

===Role-playing games===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
The dramatic possibilities of alternate history provide a diverse genre for exploration in [[role-playing game]]s. [[List of role-playing games by genre#Period adventure.2Falternate history genres|Many games]] use an alternate historical background for their campaigns. In particular, the fourth edition of ''[[GURPS]]'' uses a setting containing multiple different alternate histories as its default campaign setting, with the supplement ''[[GURPS Infinite Worlds]]'' detailing a large number of alternate worlds included in the setting, many of them carryovers from the third-edition ''GURPS'' supplements ''[[GURPS Alternate Earths]]'' and ''[[GURPS Alternate Earths II]]''.

===Video games===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
For the same reasons that this genre is explored by role-playing games, alternate history is also an intriguing backdrop for the storylines of many [[video game]]s. A famous example of an alternate history game is ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert]]''. Released in 1996, the game presents a point of divergence in 1946 where [[Albert Einstein]] goes back in time to prevent World War II from ever taking place by erasing [[Adolf Hitler]] from time after he is released from [[Landsberg Prison]] in 1924. He is successful in his mission, but in the process allows [[Joseph Stalin]] and the [[Soviet Union]] to become powerful enough—as a direct result of not having a strong rival dictator like Hitler to keep his power in check—to launch a massive campaign to conquer Europe, sparking an alternate (and ultimately costlier) version of the Second World War and, eventually, World War III not once but twice: [[Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2|one]] where the USSR invades the continental US in the 1970s, and a [[Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3|second]] where a small group of Soviet leaders, attempting to preempt their defeat, go back in time and eliminate Einstein but end up in a conflict with both the West and a third Japanese side.

In the ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization Series]]'', the player guides a civilization from prehistory to the present day, creating radically altered versions of history on a long time-scale. Several scenarios recreate a particular period which becomes the &quot;point of divergence&quot; in an alternate history shaped by the player's actions. Popular examples in ''[[Civilization IV|Sid Meier's Civilization IV]]'' include ''Desert War'', set in the Mediterranean theater of [[World War II]] and featuring scripted events tied to possible outcomes of battles; ''Broken Star'', set in a hypothetical Russian civil war in 2010; and ''[[Rhye's and Fall of Civilization]]'', an 'Earth simulator' designed to mirror a history as closely as possible but incorporating unpredictable elements to provide realistic alternate settings.

In the [[Total War (series)|Total War series]], campaigns begin with a (roughly) historically accurate map, economy, and military. However, depending on randomized progression in the campaign and the decisions and skill of the player, history can diverge greatly (e.g. The Holy Roman Empire conquering Constantinople in the Middle Ages, the Western Roman Empire continuing on beyond its collapse in 480).

''[[Crimson Skies]]'' is one example of an alternate history spawning multiple interpretations in multiple genres. The stories and games in ''Crimson Skies'' take place in an alternate 1930s [[United States]], where the nation crumbled into many hostile states following the effects of the [[Great Depression]], the [[World War I|Great War]], and [[Prohibition]]. With the road and railway system destroyed, commerce took to the skies. Great cargo [[zeppelin]]s escorted by fighter squadrons are the targets of many ruthless air pirates and enemy countries. This world has featured in a board game, a PC game, an [[Xbox]] game, a collectible miniature game and various promotional novels, comics and short stories.

The game ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare]]'' shows an alternative history in which Russia was in civil war between Loyalists and Ultranationalists, with the Ultranationalists ultimately winning. This is continued in the second game of the series when a group of Ultranationalist terrorists frame the United States for a massacre, leading to Russia launching a surprise invasion of the United States. The game ''[[Freedom Fighters (video game)|Freedom Fighters]]'' portrays a situation similar to that of the movie ''[[Red Dawn]]'' and ''Red Alert 2'', though less comically than the latter. The point of divergence is during [[World War II]], where the [[Soviet Union]] develops an atomic bomb first and uses it on [[Berlin]]. With the balance of power and influence tipped in Russia's favor, history diverges; brief summaries at the beginning of the game inform the player of the Communist bloc's complete takeover of Europe by 1953, a different ending to the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and the spread of Soviet influence into South America and Mexico. The plot of the game revolves around a Soviet invasion of the United States and the resistance fighting in New York City.

Similarly, the 2007 video game ''[[World in Conflict]]'' is set in 1989, with the [[Soviet Union]] on the verge of collapse. The point of divergence is several months before the opening of the game, when [[Warsaw Pact]] forces staged a desperate invasion of Western Europe. As the game begins, a Soviet invasion force lands in [[Seattle]], taking advantage of the fact that most of the US military is in Europe. The game is divided into three parts: the first focuses on the fighting retreat from Seattle towards Fort Teller in the [[Cascade Mountains]]; the second is a flashback to the recent fighting in Europe, which culminated in a Soviet attack on [[Manhattan]]; the third chronicles the fight to retake Seattle before a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] fleet arrives, which could force the US President to destroy the invaders with a nuclear strike.

''[[Turning Point: Fall of Liberty]]'', released in February 2008, is an alternate history [[first person shooter]] where [[Winston Churchill]] died in 1931 from being hit by a taxi cab. Because of this, [[Great Britain]] lacks the charismatic leader needed to keep the country together and [[Nazi Germany]] successfully conquers Great Britain via ''[[Operation Sealion]]''. Germany later conquers the rest of Europe and North Africa while mass-producing their [[wunderwaffe]]. The [[Axis powers|Axis]] launch a surprise invasion of an isolationist United States in 1953, which forces the country to surrender and submit to a puppet government. The game's main character is a member of a resistance force against the Germans.

Another alternate history game involving Nazis is ''[[War Front: Turning Point]]'' in which Adolf Hitler died during the early days of World War II and thus, a much more effective leadership rose to power. Under the command of a new Führer (who is referred to as &quot;Chancellor&quot;, and his real name is never revealed), [[Operation Sealion]] succeeds and the Nazis successfully conquer Britain, sparking a cold war between the Allied Powers and Germany.

Another example of alternate history is the ''[[Resistance (series)|Resistance series]]'' of first-person shooter games. The point of divergence is in the years following World War I, where an isolationist Russian Empire - and later, Western Europe - is conquered by an alien race called the Chimera. The aliens later invade the United States.

The [[Fallout (series)|Fallout Series]] of computer role-playing games is set in a divergent America, where history after World War II diverges from the real world to follow a [[retro-futuristic]] timeline. For example, [[fusion power]] was invented quite soon after the end of the war, but the [[transistor]] was either delayed or never was developed. The result was a future that has a 1950s 'World of Tomorrow' feel to it, with extremely high technology such as [[artificial intelligence]] implemented with [[thermionic valves]] and other technologies now considered obsolete.

''[[Iron Storm (video game)|Iron Storm]]'' is a first person shooter set in 1964, where the [[World War I|Great War]] still continues and international corporations sell stocks as if &quot;betting&quot; on an outcome. Since profits are so great, they continually press for stalemate to keep the conflict in an ongoing cycle of minor advances and losses.

===Comic books===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
Alternate history has also appeared in comic books. An early example is ''[[Captain Confederacy]]'', which is set in a world where the Confederate States of America won its independence and has created a [[Captain America]]-type superhero for propaganda purposes.

Influential comic writers have also used an alternate history as the background to their story. [[Alan Moore]]'s 1986 comic series ''[[Watchmen]]'' is set in an alternate United States that not only has costumed adventurers as commonplace fixtures within American society, but also contains other alternate history elements including an American &quot;victory&quot; in the [[Vietnam War]] and [[Richard Nixon]] serving five terms as president. [[Warren Ellis]]'s 2001 comic [[limited series|mini-series]] ''[[Ministry of Space]]'' features a British space program that had its foundation in the United Kingdom's recovery of scientists and technology at the German rocket installations in [[Peenemünde]] ahead of the US Army and the Soviets.

There have also been alternative history [[webcomics]] like ''[[Roswell, Texas (comics)|Roswell, Texas]]'', which diverges when [[Davy Crockett]] survived the [[Alamo]], leading to the expansion of Texas.

[[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics|DC]] have their own titles where they can tell alternative stories based on their own characters (''[[What If (comics)|What If...?]]'' and ''[[Elseworlds]]'', respectively). Most set the stories in different times or base them on different genres with some based on a divergence in their fictional history.

However, some are genuine alternate histories, with ''[[Batman: Holy Terror]]'' based on the premise that [[Oliver Cromwell]] lived for another decade. Some of the newer [[DC Multiverse]] alternate Earths could be legitimately described as alternate histories. On Earth-9, the emergence of metahumans led to a limited nuclear exchange (&quot;the Cuban War&quot;) in 1962, leading to the destruction of [[Florida]] and [[Cuba]], US intervention during the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968 and the survival of the USSR into the nineties (see [[Tangent Comics]].). On Earth-10, Nazi Germany won the Second World War. On Earth-17, the United States and USSR fought a thermonuclear World War III in 1986, with some human survivors. On Earth-30, the [[Soviet Union]] won the [[Cold War]] due to the technological boost provided by [[Superman]], whose vehicle landed in the [[Ukraine]], instead of Kansas (see ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'').

In 2009, [[Bryan Talbot]] created ''[[Grandville (comics)|Grandville]]'', a [[graphic novel]] set in a world mostly populated by [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals, in which France won the [[Napoleonic Wars]], invaded Britain and [[guillotine]]d the [[British Royal Family]]. ''Grandville'' also features elements of [[steampunk]].

In 1978, &quot;The Sentinels&quot;, one of the first serials in UK girls' comic ''[[Misty (comics)|Misty]]'', featured an alternate world where [[Nazi Germany]] conquered Britain in 1940. The alternate world was connected with the mainstream world via two apartment blocks called &quot;The Sentinels&quot;. People kept stumbling in from both sides, causing terror over unexplained disappearances and worse, mix-ups over parallel world doubles. This culminated in the Gestapo mistakenly arresting a man from the mainstream world and people from both worlds uniting for the rescue mission.

===Web comics===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
In ''[[MS Paint Adventures]]'', specifically ''Homestuck'', the idea of alternate histories is widely explored. There is one main timeline, known as &quot;winning&quot; or &quot;alpha&quot; timeline, and other, &quot;doomed&quot; or &quot;alternate&quot; timelines, created by the characters with the time travel technologies. One interesting twist in the idea is that any people who made it into the alpha timeline from a doomed timeline are bound to die in a short period of time. The time travel and alternate histories usually get so confusing they are just referred to as &quot;weird time shit.&quot;

An '''atomic orbital''' is a [[mathematical function]] that describes the wave-like behavior of either one electron or a pair of electrons in an atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book|author= Milton Orchin,Roger S. Macomber, Allan Pinhas, and R.

The term may also refer to the physical region defined by the function where the electron is likely to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Daintith, J. |title=Oxford Dictionary of Chemistry|location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-19-860918-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Within a physical context atomic orbitals are the basic building blocks of the '''electron cloud model''' (alternatively referred to as the wave mechanics model or atomic orbital model), a modern framework for describing the placement of [[electron]]s in an atom. In this model, the atom consists of a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] surrounded by orbiting electrons. These electrons exist in atomic orbitals, which are a set of [[quantum]] states of the negatively charged electrons trapped in the [[electrical field]] generated by the positively charged nucleus. The electron cloud model can only be described by [[quantum mechanics]], in which the electrons are most accurately described as standing waves surrounding the nucleus.

Atomic orbitals are typically described as “hydrogen-like” (meaning one-electron) [[wave function]]s over space, categorized by ''n'', ''l'', and ''m'' [[quantum numbers]], which correspond to the electrons' energy, angular momentum, and an angular momentum direction, respectively. Each orbital is defined by a different set of quantum numbers and contains a maximum of two electrons. The simple names '''s orbital''', '''p orbital''', '''d orbital''' and '''f orbital''' refer to orbitals with angular momentum quantum number ''l'' = 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively. These names indicate the orbital shape and are used to describe the [[electron configuration]]s. They are derived from the characteristics of their spectroscopic lines: '''s'''harp, '''p'''rincipal, '''d'''iffuse, and '''f'''undamental, the rest being named in alphabetical order (omitting j).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The wavefunction for the electron cloud of a complex atom may be seen as being built up (in approximation) in an [[electron configuration]] that is a sum of simpler hydrogen-like atomic orbitals. In such a configuration, pairs of electrons are arranged in simple repeating patterns of increasing odd numbers (1,3,5,7..), each of which represents a set of electron pairs with a given energy and angular momentum. The repeating ''periodicity'' of the blocks of 2, 6, 10, and 14 elements in the [[periodic table]] arises naturally from the total number of electrons which occupy a complete set of '''s''', '''p''', '''d''' and '''f''' atomic orbitals, respectively.

== Introduction ==
With the development of quantum mechanics, it was found that the orbiting electrons around a nucleus could not be fully described as particles, but needed to be explained by the wave-particle duality. In this sense, the electrons have the following properties:

=== Wave-like properties ===
The electrons do not orbit the nucleus in the sense of a planet orbiting the sun, but instead exist as standing waves. The lowest possible energy an electron can take is therefore analogous to the fundamental frequency of a wave on a string. Higher energy states are then similar to harmonics of the fundamental frequency.

The electrons are never in a single point location, although the probability of interacting with the electron at a single point can be found from the wavefunction of the electron.

=== Particle-like properties ===
There is always an integer number of electrons orbiting the nucleus.

Electrons jump between orbitals in a particle-like fashion. For example, if a single photon strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon.

The electrons retain particle like-properties such as: each wave state has the same electrical charge as the electron particle. Each wave state has a single discrete spin (spin up or spin down).

===Visualizing Atomic Orbitals Intuitively===

Despite the obvious analogy to planets revolving around the Sun, electrons cannot be described as solid particles. In addition, atomic orbitals do not closely resemble a planet's elliptical path in ordinary atoms. A more accurate analogy might be that of a large and often oddly-shaped &quot;atmosphere&quot; (the electron), distributed around a relatively tiny planet (the atomic nucleus). One difference is that some of an atom's electrons have zero angular momentum, so they cannot in any sense be thought of as moving &quot;around&quot; the nucleus, as a planet does. Other electrons do have varying amounts of angular momentum.

Atomic orbitals exactly describe the shape of this &quot;atmosphere&quot; only when a single electron is present in an atom. When more electrons are added to a single atom, the additional electrons tend to more evenly fill in a volume of space around the nucleus so that the resulting collection (sometimes termed the atom’s “electron cloud” &lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book| title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics -The Definitive Edition, Vol 1 lect 6| page=11| year=2006| publisher= Pearson PLC, Addison Wesley|isbn =0-8053-9046-4| author= Feynman, Richard; Leighton; Sands}}&lt;/ref&gt;) tends toward a generally spherical zone of probability describing where the atom’s electrons will be found.

==History==
{{main|Atomic theory}}

The term &quot;orbital&quot; was coined by [[Robert Mulliken]] in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

However, the idea that electrons might revolve around a compact nucleus with definite angular momentum was convincingly argued at least 19 years earlier by [[Niels Bohr]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Early Models===

With [[J.J. Thomson]]'s discovery of the electron in 1897,&lt;ref name=&quot;referenceC&quot;&gt;J.J. Thomson (1897)&quot;Cathode rays&quot;, ''Philosophical Magazine'', 44, 293&lt;/ref&gt; it became clear that atoms were not the smallest building blocks of nature, but were rather composite particles. The newly discovered structure within atoms tempted many to imagine how the atom's constituent parts might interact with each other. Thomson theorized that multiple electrons revolved in orbit-like rings within a positively-charged jelly-like substance,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 |journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]] Series 6
 |volume=7 |issue=39 |pages=
 |format=extract of paper
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and between the electron's discovery and 1909, this &quot;[[plum pudding model]]&quot; was the most widely-accepted explanation of atomic structure.

Shortly after Thomson's discovery, [[Hantaro Nagaoka]], a Japanese physicist, predicted a different model for electronic structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nagaoka 1904 445–455&quot;/&gt; Unlike the plum pudding model, the positive charge in Nagaoka's &quot;Saturnian Model&quot; was concentrated into a central core, pulling the electrons into circular orbits reminiscent of Saturn's rings. Few people took notice of Nakaoga's work at the time,&lt;ref&gt;

and Nagaoka himself recognized a fundamental snag in the theory even at its conception, namely that a classical charged object cannot sustain orbital motion because it is accelerating and therefore loses energy due to radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===The Bohr Atom===

In 1909 [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered that the positive half of atoms was tightly condensed into a nucleus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Geiger H. &amp; Marsden E.| title=On a Diffuse Reflection of the α-Particles | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series A | year=1909 | volume=82 | pages=495&amp;ndash;500 | url=http://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/GM-1909.html| doi=10.1098/rspa.1909.0054 |bibcode = 1909RSPSA..82..495G }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and it became clear that the plum pudding model could not explain atomic behavior. About this time, [[Niels Bohr]] stepped into the fray and introduced a new model of the atom, wherein electrons orbited the nucleus with classical periods, but were only permitted to have discrete values angular momentum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last=Bohr | first=Niels
| title=On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules
| journal=Philosophical Magazine | year=1913
| volume=26 | issue=1 | pages=476 |url=http://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/Bohr/Bohr-1913a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bohr model]] of the atom both fixed the problem of energy loss and laid intuitive groundwork for much of modern quantum mechanics.

[[Image:Bohr-atom-PAR.svg|thumb|The Rutherford Bohr model of the hydrogen atom.]]
After the discovery of the [[photoelectric effect]], the connection between the structure of electrons in atoms and the [[Emission spectra|emission]] and [[absorption spectra]] of atoms became an increasingly useful tool in the understanding of electrons in atoms. The most prominent feature of emission and absorption spectra was that these spectra contained discrete lines. The significance of the [[Bohr model]] was that it related the lines in emission and absorption spectra to the energy differences between the orbits that electrons could take around an atom. This was achieved by giving the electrons some kind of wave-like properties. In particular, electrons were assumed to have a [[wavelength]] (a property that had previously been discovered, but not entirely understood). The Bohr model was therefore not only a significant step towards the understanding of electrons in atoms, but also a significant step towards the development of the wave/particle duality of [[quantum mechanics]].

The premise of the model was that electrons had a wavelength, which was a function of its momentum, and therefore an orbiting electron would need to orbit at a multiple of the wavelength. The Bohr model was thus a classical model with an additional constraint provided by the 'wavelength' argument. In our current understanding of physics, this 'wavelength' argument is known to be an element of quantum mechanics, and for that reason the Bohr model is called a semi-classical model.

The Bohr model was able to explain the emission and absorption spectra of [[Hydrogen]]. The energies of electrons in the n=1, 2, 3, etc. states in the Bohr model match those of current physics. However, this did not explain similarities between different atoms, as expressed by the periodic table, such as the fact that helium (2 electrons), neon (10 electrons), and argon (18 electrons) exhibit similar chemical behavior. Modern physics explains this by noting that the n=1 state holds 2 electrons, the n=2 state holds 8 electrons, and the n=3 state holds 8 electrons (in argon). In the end, this was solved by the discovery of modern quantum mechanics and the [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]].

===Modern Conceptions and Connections to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle===

Immediately after [[Heisenberg]] discovered his [[Uncertainty principle|uncertainty relation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

it was noted by [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] that the existence of any sort of [[wave packet]] implies uncertainty in the wave frequency and wavelength, since a spread of frequencies is needed to create the packet itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In quantum mechanics, where all particle momenta are associated with waves, it is the formation of such a wave packet which localizes the wave, and thus the particle, in space. In states where a quantum mechanical particle is bound, it must be localized as a wave packet, and the existence of the packet and its minimum size implies a spread and minimal value in particle wavelength, and thus also momentum and energy. In quantum mechanics, as a particle is localized to a smaller region in space, the associated compressed wave packet requires a larger and larger range of momenta, and thus larger kinetic energy. Thus, the binding energy to contain or trap a particle in a smaller region of space, increases without bound, as the region of space grows smaller. Particles cannot be restricted to a geometric point in space, since this would require an infinite particle momentum.  

In chemistry, [[Schrödinger]], [[Pauling]], [[Robert S. Mulliken|Mulliken]] and others noted that the consequence of Heisenberg's relation was that the electron, as a wave packet, could not be considered to have an exact location in its orbital. [[Max Born]] suggested that the electron's position needed to be described by a [[probability distribution]] which was connected with finding the electron at some point in the wave-function which described its associated wave packet. The new quantum mechanics did not give exact results, but only the probabilities for the occurrence of a variety of possible such results. Heisenberg held that the path of a moving particle has no meaning if we cannot observe it, as we cannot with electrons in an atom. 

In the quantum picture of Heisenberg, Schrödinger and others, the Bohr atom number ''n'' for each orbital became known as an ''n-sphere'' in a three dimensional atom and was pictured as the mean energy of the probability cloud of the electron's wave packet which surrounded the atom.

==Orbital names==
Orbitals are given names in the form:
:&lt;math&gt;X \, \mathrm{type}^y \ &lt;/math&gt;
where ''X'' is the energy level corresponding to the [[principal quantum number]] ''n'', '''type''' is a lower-case letter denoting the shape or [[subshell]] of the orbital and it corresponds to the [[angular quantum number]] ''l'', and ''y'' is the number of electrons in that orbital.

For example, the orbital 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (pronounced &quot;one ess two&quot;) has two electrons and is the lowest energy level (''n'' = 1) and has an angular quantum number of ''l'' = 0. In [[X-ray notation]], the ''principal quantum number'' is given a letter associated with it. For {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}}, the letters associated with those numbers are ''K'', ''L'', ''M'', ''N'', ''O'', ... respectively.

==Formal quantum mechanical definition==
In [[quantum mechanics]], the state of an atom, i.e. the [[eigenstate]]s of the atomic [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], is expanded (see [[configuration interaction]] expansion and [[basis set (chemistry)|basis set]]) into [[linear combination]]s of anti-symmetrized products ([[Slater determinant]]s) of one-electron functions. The spatial components of these one-electron functions are called '''atomic orbitals'''. (When one considers also their [[spin (physics)|spin]] component, one speaks of '''atomic spin orbitals'''.)

In [[atomic physics]], the [[atomic spectral line]]s correspond to transitions ([[Atomic electron transition|quantum leap]]s) between [[quantum state]]s of an atom. These states are labelled by a set of [[quantum number]]s summarized in the [[term symbol]] and usually associated to particular electron configurations, i.e. by occupations schemes of '''atomic orbitals''' (e.g. 1''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; for the ground state of [[neon]] -- term symbol: &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).

This notation means that the corresponding Slater determinants have a clear higher weight in the [[configuration interaction]] expansion. The atomic orbital concept is therefore a key concept for visualizing the excitation process associated to a given [[Atomic electron transition|transition]]. For example, one can say for a given transition that it corresponds to the excitation of an electron from an occupied orbital to a given unoccupied orbital. Nevertheless one has to keep in mind that electrons are [[fermion]]s ruled by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] and cannot be distinguished from the other electrons in the atom. Moreover, it sometimes happens that the configuration interaction expansion converges very slowly and that one cannot speak about simple one-determinantal wave function at all. This is the case when [[electron correlation]] is large.

Fundamentally, an atomic orbital is a one-electron wavefunction, even though most electrons do not exist in one-electron atoms, and so the one-electron view is an approximation. When thinking about orbitals, we are often given an orbital vision which (even if it is not spelled out) is heavily influenced by this [[Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock]] approximation, which is one way to reduce the complexities of [[molecular orbital theory]].

==Hydrogen-like atoms==
{{Main|Hydrogen-like atom}}

The simplest atomic orbitals are those that occur in an atom with a single electron, such as the [[hydrogen atom]]. In this case the atomic orbitals are the eigenstates of the [[hydrogen]] Hamiltonian.{{Clarify|date=November 2008}} They can be obtained analytically (see [[hydrogen atom]]). An atom of any other element [[ion]]ized down to a single electron is very similar to hydrogen, and the orbitals take the same form.

For atoms with two or more electrons, the governing equations can only be solved with the use of methods of iterative approximation. Orbitals of multi-electron atoms are ''qualitatively'' similar to those of hydrogen, and in the simplest models, they are taken to have the same form. For more rigorous and precise analysis, the numerical approximations must be used.

A given (hydrogen-like) atomic orbital is identified by unique values of three quantum numbers: [[Principal quantum number|''n'']], [[Azimuthal quantum number|''l'']], and [[magnetic quantum number|''m&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'']]. The rules restricting the values of the quantum numbers, and their energies (see below), explain the electron configuration of the atoms and the [[periodic table]].

The stationary states ([[quantum state]]s) of the hydrogen-like atoms are its atomic orbital. However, in general, an electron's behavior is not fully described by a single orbital. Electron states are best represented by time-depending &quot;mixtures&quot; ([[linear combination]]s) of multiple orbitals. See [[Linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method]].

The quantum number ''n'' first appeared in the [[Bohr model]] where it determines the radius of each circular electron orbit. In modern quantum mechanics however, ''n'' determines the mean distance of the electron from the nucleus; all electrons with the same value of ''n'' lie at the same average distance. For this reason, orbitals with the same value of ''n'' are said to comprise a &quot;[[electron shell|shell]]&quot;. Orbitals with the same value of ''n'' and also the same value of ''l'' are even more closely related, and are said to comprise a &quot;[[electron subshell|subshell]]&quot;.

==Quantum numbers==
Because of the quantum mechanical nature of the electrons around a nucleus, they cannot be described by a location and momentum. Instead, they are described by a set of quantum numbers that encompasses both the particle-like nature and the wave-like nature of the electrons. An atomic orbital is uniquely identified by the values of the three quantum numbers, and each set of the three quantum numbers corresponds to exactly one orbital, but the quantum numbers only occur in certain combinations of values. The quantum numbers, together with the rules governing their possible values, are as follows:

The [[principal quantum number]], ''n'', describes the energy of the electron and is always a [[positive integer]]. In fact, it can be any positive integer, but for reasons discussed below, large numbers are seldom encountered. Each atom has, in general, many orbitals associated with each value of ''n''; these orbitals together are sometimes called ''[[electron shells]]''.

The [[azimuthal quantum number]], &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, describes the orbital angular momentum of each electron and is a non-negative integer. Within a shell where ''n'' is some integer ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; ranges across all (integer) values satisfying the relation &lt;math&gt;0 \le \ell \le n_0-1&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, the ''n'' = 1 shell has only orbitals with &lt;math&gt;\ell=0&lt;/math&gt;, and the ''n'' = 2 shell has only orbitals with &lt;math&gt;\ell=0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\ell=1&lt;/math&gt;. The set of orbitals associated with a particular value of &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes collectively called a ''subshell''.

The [[magnetic quantum number]], &lt;math&gt;m_\ell&lt;/math&gt;, describes the magnetic moment of an electron in an arbitrary direction, and is also always an integer. Within a subshell where &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is some integer &lt;math&gt;\ell_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m_\ell&lt;/math&gt; ranges thus: &lt;math&gt;-\ell_0 \le m_\ell \le \ell_0&lt;/math&gt;.

The above results may be summarized in the following table. Each cell represents a subshell, and lists the values of &lt;math&gt;m_\ell&lt;/math&gt; available in that subshell. Empty cells represent subshells that do not exist.

Subshells are usually identified by their &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;- and &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;-values. &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is represented by its numerical value, but &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is represented by a letter as follows: 0 is represented by 's', 1 by 'p', 2 by 'd', 3 by 'f', and 4 by 'g'. For instance, one may speak of the subshell with &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell=0&lt;/math&gt; as a '2s subshell'.

Each electron also has a [[spin quantum number]], '''s''', which describes the spin of each electron (spin up or spin down). The number '''s''' can be +{{frac|1|2}} or -{{frac|1|2}}.

The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] states that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state: every electron in an atom must have a unique combination of quantum numbers.

==The shapes of orbitals==
[[File:HydrogenOrbitalsN6L0M0.png|thumb|Cross-section of computed hydrogen atom orbital (''ψ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for the 6s (''n''=6, ''l''=0, ''m''=0) orbital. Note that s orbitals, though spherically symmetrical, have radially placed wave-nodes for ''n'' &gt; 1. However, only s orbitals invariably have a center anti-node; the other types never do.]]
Any discussion of the shapes of electron orbitals is necessarily imprecise, because a given electron, regardless of which orbital it occupies, can at any moment be found at any distance from the nucleus and in any direction due to the [[uncertainty principle]].

However, the electron is much more likely to be found in certain regions of the atom than in others. Given this, a boundary surface can be drawn so that the electron has a high probability to be found somewhere within the surface, and all regions outside the surface have low values. The precise placement of the surface is arbitrary, but any reasonably compact determination must follow a pattern specified by the behavior of |''ψ''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the square of the [[absolute value]] (also called magnitude or modulus) of the complex-valued [[wavefunction]]. This boundary surface is sometimes what is meant when the &quot;shape&quot; of an orbital is referred to. Sometimes the ''ψ'' function will be graphed to show its phases, rather than the |''ψ''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which shows probability density but has no phases (which have been lost in the process of taking the absolute value, since ''ψ'' is a complex number). |''ψ''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbital graphs tend to have less spherical, thinner lobes than ''ψ'' graphs, but have the same number of lobes in the same places, and otherwise are recognizable. This article, in order to show wave function phases, shows mostly ''ψ'' graphs.

Generally speaking, the number ''n'' determines the size and energy of the orbital for a given nucleus: as ''n'' increases, the size of the orbital increases. However, in comparing different elements, the higher nuclear charge, ''Z'', of heavier elements causes their orbitals to contract by comparison to lighter ones, so that the overall size of the whole atom remains very roughly constant, even as the number of electrons in heavier elements (higher ''Z'') increases.

Also in general terms, &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; determines an orbital's shape, and &lt;math&gt;m_\ell&lt;/math&gt; its orientation. However, since some orbitals are described by equations in [[complex number]]s, the shape sometimes depends on &lt;math&gt;m_\ell&lt;/math&gt; also.

The single s-orbitals (&lt;math&gt;\ell=0&lt;/math&gt;) are shaped like spheres. For ''n'' = 1 the sphere is &quot;solid&quot; (it is most dense at the center and fades exponentially outwardly), but for ''n'' = 2 or more, each single s-orbital is composed of spherically symmetric surfaces which are nested shells (i.e., the &quot;wave-structure&quot; is radial, following a sinusoidal radial component as well). See illustration of a cross-section of these nested shells, at right. The s-orbitals for all ''n'' numbers are the only orbitals with an anti-node (a region of high wave function density) at the center of the nucleus. All other orbitals (p, d, f, etc.) have angular momentum, and thus avoid the nucleus (having a wave node ''at'' the nucleus).

The three p-orbitals for ''n'' = 2 have the form of two [[ellipsoid]]s with a [[point of tangency]] at the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (the two-lobed shape is sometimes referred to as a &quot;[[dumbbell]]&quot;). The three p-orbitals in each [[Electron shell|shell]] are oriented at right angles to each other, as determined by their respective linear combination of values of &lt;math&gt;m_\ell&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:D orbitals.svg|thumb|250px|The five d orbitals in ''ψ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; form, with a combination diagram showing how they fit together to fill space around an atomic nucleus.]]
Four of the five d-orbitals for ''n'' = 3 look similar, each with four pear-shaped lobes, each lobe tangent to two others, and the centers of all four lying in one plane, between a pair of axes. Three of these planes are the xy-, xz-, and yz-planes, and the fourth has the centres on the x and y axes. The fifth and final d-orbital consists of three regions of high probability density: a [[torus]] with two pear-shaped regions placed symmetrically on its z axis.

There are seven f-orbitals, each with shapes more complex than those of the d-orbitals.

For each s, p, d, f and g set of orbitals, the set of orbitals which composes it forms a spherically symmetrical set of shapes. For non-s orbitals, which have lobes, the lobes point in directions so as to fill space as symmetrically as possible for number of lobes which exist for a set of orientations. For example, the three p orbitals have six lobes which are oriented to each of the six primary directions of 3-D space; for the 5 d orbitals, there are a total of 18 lobes, in which again six point in primary directions, and the 12 additional lobes fill the 12 gaps which exist between each pairs of these 6 primary axes.

Additionally, as is the case with the s orbitals, individual p, d, f and g orbitals with ''n'' values higher than the lowest possible value, exhibit an additional radial node structure which is reminiscent of harmonic waves of the same type, as compared with the lowest (or fundamental) mode of the wave. As with s orbitals, this phenomenon provides p, d, f, and g orbitals at the next higher possible value of ''n'' (for example, 3p orbitals vs. the fundamental 2p), an additional node in each lobe. Still higher values of ''n'' further increase the number of radial nodes, for each type of orbital.

The shapes of atomic orbitals in one-electron atom are related to 3-dimensional [[spherical harmonics]]. These shapes are not unique, and any linear combination is valid, like a transformatiom to [[cubic harmonic]]s, in fact it is possible to generate sets where all the d's are the same shape, just like the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; are the same shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1021/ed045p45 | title = The five equivalent d orbitals | year = 1968 | last1 = Powell | first1 = Richard E. | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | volume = 45| issue = 1 | pages = 45|bibcode = 1968JChEd..45...45P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi =10.1063/1.1750628 | title =Directed Valence | year =1940 | last1 =Kimball | first1 =George E. | journal =The Journal of Chemical Physics | volume =8| issue =2 | pages =188|bibcode = 1940JChPh...8..188K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbitals table===
This table shows all orbital configurations for the real hydrogen-like wave functions up to 7s, and therefore covers the simple electronic configuration for all elements in the periodic table up to [[radium]]. ''ψ'' graphs are shown with '''-''' and '''+''' [[wave function]] phases shown in two different colors (arbitrarily red and blue). The ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; orbital is the same as the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''0''&lt;/sub&gt; orbital, but the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; are formed by taking linear
combinations of the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''+1''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''-1''&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals (which is why they are listed under the m=±1 label). Also, the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''+1''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''-1''&lt;/sub&gt; are not
the same shape as the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''0''&lt;/sub&gt;, since they are pure [[spherical harmonics]].

===Understanding why atomic orbitals take these shapes===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
The shapes of atomic orbitals can be understood qualitatively by considering the analogous case of [[Vibrations of a circular drum|standing waves on a circular drum]]. The many modes of the vibrating disk form the shape of atomic orbitals. It follows that the shapes of atomic orbitals are a direct consequence of the wave nature of the electrons.

A number of modes are shown below together with their quantum numbers. The analogous wave functions of the hydrogen atom are also indicated.

==Orbital energy==
{{main|electron shell}}
In atoms with a single electron ([[hydrogen-like atom]]s), the energy of an orbital (and, consequently, of any electrons in the orbital) is determined exclusively by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; orbital has the lowest possible energy in the atom. Each successively higher value of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; has a higher level of energy, but the difference decreases as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; increases. For high &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the level of energy becomes so high that the electron can easily escape from the atom. In single electron atoms, all levels with different &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; within a given &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are (to a good approximation) degenerate, and have the same energy. [This approximation is broken to a slight extent by the effect of the magnetic field of the nucleus, and by [[quantum electrodynamics]] effects. The latter induce tiny binding energy differences especially for '''s''' electrons that go nearer the nucleus, since these feel a very slightly different nuclear charge, even in one-electron atoms. See [[Lamb shift]].]

In atoms with multiple electrons, the energy of an electron depends not only on the intrinsic properties of its orbital, but also on its interactions with the other electrons. These interactions depend on the detail of its spatial probability distribution, and so the [[energy level]]s of orbitals depend not only on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; but also on &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;. Higher values of &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; are associated with higher values of energy; for instance, the 2''p'' state is higher than the 2''s'' state. When &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; = 2, the increase in energy of the orbital becomes so large as to push the energy of orbital above the energy of the ''s''-orbital in the next higher shell; when &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; = 3 the energy is pushed into the shell two steps higher. The filling of the 3d orbitals does not occur until the 4s orbitals have been filled. 

The increase in energy for subshells of increasing angular momentum in larger atoms is due to electron-electron interaction effects, and it is specifically related to the ability of low angular momentum electrons to penetrate more effectively toward the nucleus, where they are subject to less screening from the charge of intervening electrons. Thus, in atoms of higher atomic number, the &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; of electrons becomes more and more of a determining factor in their energy, and the principal quantum numbers &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of electrons becomes less and less important in their energy placement.

The energy sequence of the first 24 subshells (e.g., 1s, 2p, 3d, etc.) is given in the following table. Each cell represents a subshell with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; given by its row and column indices, respectively. The number in the cell is the subshell's position in the sequence. For a linear listing of the subshells in terms of increasing energies in multielectron atoms, see the section below.

==Electron placement and the periodic table==
[[Image:Electron orbitals.svg|right|thumb|350px| [[Electron]] atomic and [[molecular orbital|molecular]] orbitals. The chart of orbitals ('''left''') is arranged by increasing energy (see [[Madelung rule]]). ''Note that atomic orbits are functions of three variables (two angles, and the distance from the nucleus, r). These images are faithful to the angular component of the orbital, but not entirely representative of the orbital as a whole.'']]

{{main|electron configuration|electron shell}}

Several rules govern the placement of electrons in orbitals (''[[electron configuration]]''). The first dictates that no two electrons in an atom may have the same set of values of quantum numbers (this is the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]). These quantum numbers include the three that define orbitals, as well as [[Spin quantum number|''s'']], or [[spin quantum number]]. Thus, two electrons may occupy a single orbital, so long as they have different values of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. However, ''only'' two electrons, because of their spin, can be associated with each orbital.

Additionally, an electron always tends to fall to the lowest possible energy state. It is possible for it to occupy any orbital so long as it does not violate the Pauli exclusion principle, but if lower-energy orbitals are available, this condition is unstable. The electron will eventually lose energy (by releasing a [[photon]]) and drop into the lower orbital. Thus, electrons fill orbitals in the order specified by the energy sequence given above.

This behavior is responsible for the structure of the [[periodic table]]. The table may be divided into several rows (called 'periods'), numbered starting with 1 at the top. The presently known elements occupy seven periods. If a certain period has number &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, it consists of elements whose outermost electrons fall in the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th shell. [[Niels Bohr]] was the first to propose (1923) that the [[Periodic table|periodicity]] in the properties of the elements might be explained by the periodic filling of the electron energy levels, resulting in the electronic structure of the atom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bohr&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bohr | first = Niels | authorlink = Niels Bohr | title = Über die Anwendung der Quantumtheorie auf den Atombau. I. | journal = [[Zeitschrift für Physik|Z. Phys.]] | year = 1923 | volume = 13 | page = 117|bibcode = 1923ZPhy...13..117B |doi = 10.1007/BF01328209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The periodic table may also be divided into several numbered rectangular '[[Periodic table block|blocks]]'. The elements belonging to a given block have this common feature: their highest-energy electrons all belong to the same &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;-state (but the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; associated with that &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;-state depends upon the period). For instance, the leftmost two columns constitute the 's-block'. The outermost electrons of Li and Be respectively belong to the 2s subshell, and those of Na and Mg to the 3s subshell.

The following is the order for filling the &quot;subshell&quot; orbitals, which also gives the order of the &quot;blocks&quot; in the periodic table:

:'''1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p'''

The &quot;periodic&quot; nature of this filling of orbitals is more obvious if the order is given with increasing principle quantum numbers starting new rows, and repeating each subshell is given as many times as required for each pair of electrons it may contain:
&lt;center&gt;
{|
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;
1s                                   
2s                          2p, 2p, 2p
3s                          3p, 3p, 3p
4s      3d, 3d, 3d, 3d, 3d, 4p, 4p, 4p
5s      4d, 4d, 4d, 4d, 4d, 5p, 5p, 5p
6s (4f) 5d, 5d, 5d, 5d, 5d, 6p, 6p, 6p
7s (5f) 6d, 6d, 6d, 6d, 6d, 7p, 7p, 7p
&lt;/pre&gt;
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The number of electrons in a neutral atom increases with the [[atomic number]]. The electrons in the outermost shell, or ''[[valence electron]]s'', tend to be responsible for an element's chemical behavior. Elements that contain the same number of valence electrons can be grouped together and display similar chemical properties.

===Relativistic effects===
{{Main|Relativistic quantum chemistry}}

For elements with high atomic number Z, the effects of relativity become more pronounced, and especially so for ''s'' electrons, which move at relativistic velocities as they penetrate the screening electrons near the core of high Z atoms. This relativistic increase in momentum for high speed electrons causes a corresponding decrease in wavelength and contraction of 6s orbitals relative to 5d orbitals (by comparison to corresponding ''s'' and ''d'' electrons in lighter elements in the same column of the periodic table); this results in 6s valence electrons becoming lowered in energy.

Examples of significant physical outcomes of this effect include the lowered melting temperature of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] (which results from 6s electrons not being available for metal bonding) and the golden color of [[gold]] and [[caesium]] (which results from narrowing of 6s to 5d transition energy to the point that visible light begins to be absorbed). See [http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtut/atomic/qprimer/#Q26].

In the [[Bohr Model]], an &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; electron has a velocity given by &lt;math&gt;v = Z \alpha c&lt;/math&gt;, where ''Z'' is the atomic number, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[fine-structure constant]], and ''c'' is the speed of light. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, therefore, any atom with an atomic number greater than 137 would require its 1s electrons to be traveling faster than the speed of light. Even in the [[Dirac equation]], which accounts for relativistic effects, the wavefunction of the electron for atoms with '''Z &gt; 137''' is oscillatory and [[unbounded]]. The significance of element 137, also known as [[untriseptium]], was first pointed out by the physicist [[Richard Feynman]]. Element 137 is sometimes informally called [[feynmanium]] (symbol Fy). However, Feynman's approximation fails to predict the exact critical value of Z due to the non-point-charge nature of the nucleus and very small orbital radius of inner electrons, resulting in a potential seen by inner electrons which is effectively less than '''Z'''. The critical '''Z''' value which makes the atom unstable with regard to high-field breakdown of the vacuum and production of electron-positron pairs, does not occur until '''Z''' is about 173. These conditions are not seen except transiently in collisions of very heavy nuclei such as lead or uranium in accelerators, where such electron-positron production from these effects has been claimed to be observed. See [[Extension of the periodic table beyond the seventh period]].

== Transitions between orbitals ==
Under quantum mechanics, each quantum state has a well-defined energy. When applied to atomic orbitals, this means that each state has a specific energy, and that if an electron is to move between states, the energy difference is also very fixed.

Consider two states of the Hydrogen atom:

State 1) n=1, l=0, m&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;=0 and s=+{{frac|1|2}}

State 2) n=2, l=0, m&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;=0 and s=+{{frac|1|2}}

By quantum theory, state 1 has a fixed energy of E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and state 2 has a fixed energy of E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Now, what would happen if an electron in state 1 were to move to state 2? For this to happen, the electron would need to gain an energy of exactly E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. If the electron receives energy that is less than or greater than this value, it cannot jump from state 1 to state 2. Now, suppose we irradiate the atom with a broad-spectrum of light. Photons that reach the atom that have an energy of exactly E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; will be absorbed by the electron in state 1, and that electron will jump to state 2. However, photons that are greater or lower in energy cannot be absorbed by the electron, because the electron can only jump to one of the orbitals, it cannot jump to a state between orbitals. The result is that only photons of a specific frequency will be absorbed by the atom. This creates a line in the spectrum, known as an absorption line, which corresponds to the energy difference between states 1 and 2.

The atomic orbital model thus predicts line spectra, which are observed experimentally. This is one of the main validations of the atomic orbital model.

The atomic orbital model is nevertheless an approximation to the full quantum theory, which only recognizes many electron states. The predictions of line spectra are qualitatively useful but are not quantitatively accurate for atoms and ions other than those containing only one electron.

[[Image:Molecular structures of the 21 proteinogenic amino acids.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|right|alt=Table of Amino Acids.|The 21 amino acids found in [[eukaryotes]], grouped according to their side-chains' [[pKa]]s and charge at [[pH#Living systems|physiological pH 7.4]]]]

'''Amino acids''' ({{IPA-en|əˈmiːnoʊ ..., əˈmaɪnoʊ ..., ˈæmɪnoʊ ...|pron}}) are [[molecule]]s containing an [[amine]] group, a [[carboxylic acid]] group and a side-chain that varies between different amino acids. The key elements of an amino acid are [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]]. They are particularly important in biochemistry, where the term usually refers to ''alpha-amino acids''.

An alpha-amino acid has the generic [[Chemical formula|formula]]  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NCHRCOOH, where R is an organic [[substituent]];&lt;ref&gt;Proline is an exception to this general formula. It lacks the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group because of the cyclization of the side-chain and is known as an imino acid; it falls under the category of special structured amino acids.&lt;/ref&gt; the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (the [[alpha carbon|α–carbon]]). Other types of amino acid exist when the amino group is attached to a different carbon atom; for example, in gamma-amino acids (such as [[gamma-amino-butyric acid]]) the carbon atom to which the amino group attaches is separated from the carboxylate group by two other carbon atoms. The various alpha-amino acids differ in which [[side-chain]] (R-group) is attached to their alpha carbon, and can vary in size from just one [[hydrogen]] atom in [[glycine]] to a large [[heterocycle|heterocyclic group]] in [[tryptophan]].

Amino acids are critical to life, and have many functions in [[metabolism]]. One particularly important function is to serve as the building blocks of [[protein]]s, which are linear chains of amino acids. Amino acids can be linked together in varying sequences to form a vast variety of proteins.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIGMS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://publications.nigms.nih.gov/structlife/chapter1.html | title = The Structures of Life | publisher = National Institute of General Medical Sciences | accessdate = 2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Twenty-two amino acids are naturally incorporated into polypeptides and are called proteinogenic or standard amino acids. Of these, 20 are encoded by the universal genetic code. Eight standard amino acids are called &quot;essential&quot; for humans because they cannot be created from other [[chemical compound|compounds]] by the human body, and so must be taken in as food.

Due to their central role in biochemistry, amino acids are important in [[nutrition]] and are commonly used in [[food technology]] and [[industry]]. In industry, applications include the production of [[biodegradable plastic]]s, [[drug]]s, and [[asymmetric catalysis|chiral catalysts]].

==History==
The first few amino acids were discovered in the early 19th century. In 1806, the French chemists [[Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin]] and [[Pierre Jean Robiquet]] isolated a compound in [[asparagus]] that proved to be [[asparagine]], the first amino acid to be discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The discovery of a new plant principle in Asparagus sativus |author=Vauquelin LN, Robiquet PJ |journal=Annales de Chimie |year=1806 |volume=57 |pages=88–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anfinsen&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Protein Chemistry |author=Anfinsen CB, Edsall JT, Richards FM |year=1972 |pages=99, 103 |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-12-034226-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another amino acid that was discovered in the early 19th century was [[cystine]], in 1810,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On cystic oxide, a new species of urinary calculus |author=Wollaston WH |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |year=1810 |volume=100|issue=0 |pages=223–30 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1810.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its monomer, [[cysteine]], was discovered much later, in 1884.&lt;ref name=Anfinsen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Über cystin und cystein |author=Baumann E |journal=Z Physiol Chemie |year=1884 |volume=8 |issue=4|pages=299–305 | url=http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/library/data/lit16533 | accessdate=28 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glycine]] and [[leucine]] were also discovered around this time, in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Sur la conversion des matières animales en nouvelles substances par le moyen de l'acide sulfurique |author=Braconnot HM |journal=Ann Chim Phys Ser 2 |year=1820 |volume=13 |pages=113–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of the term ''amino acid'' in the English language is from [[1898]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=amino | publisher = www.etymonline.com | title = etymonline.com entry for ''amino'' | accessdate = 2010-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General structure==
{{further|[[Proteinogenic amino acid]]}}
[[Image:Lysine fisher struct num.png|thumb|right|[[Lysine]] with the carbon atoms in the side-chain labeled|alt=Lysine contains six carbon atoms. The central carbon atom connected to the amino and carboxyl groups is labeled alpha. The four carbon atoms in its linear side-chain are labeled from beta (closest to the central carbon), gamma, delta, through to the epsilon carbon at the end of the chain and furthest from the central carbon.]]
In the structure shown at the top of the page, '''R''' represents a [[side-chain]] specific to each amino acid. The [[carbon]] atom next to the [[carboxyl group]] is called the [[alpha carbon|α–carbon]] and amino acids with a side-chain bonded to this carbon are referred to as ''alpha amino acids''. These are the most common form found in nature. In the alpha amino acids, the α–carbon is a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] carbon atom, with the exception of [[glycine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Creighton&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Creighton |first=Thomas H. |title=Proteins: structures and molecular properties |publisher=W.

Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=1993 |chapter=Chapter 1 |isbn=978-0-7167-7030-5 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In amino acids that have a carbon chain attached to the α–carbon (such as [[lysine]], shown to the right) the carbons are labeled in order as α, β, γ, δ, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/AminoAcid/AA1n2.html | title = Nomenclature and Symbolism for Amino Acids and Peptides | publisher = IUPAC-IUB Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature | year = 1983 | accessdate = 2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some amino acids, the amine group is attached to the β or γ-carbon, and these are therefore referred to as ''beta'' or ''gamma amino acids''.

Amino acids are usually classified by the [[chemical property|properties]] of their side-chain into four groups. The side-chain can make an amino acid a [[weak acid]] or a [[weak base|weak]] [[basic (chemistry)|base]], and a [[hydrophile]] if the side-chain is [[polar molecule|polar]] or a [[hydrophobe]] if it is [[nonpolar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Creighton&quot; /&gt; The [[chemical structure]]s of the 22 standard amino acids, along with their chemical properties, are described more fully in the article on these [[proteinogenic amino acid]]s.

The phrase &quot;[[branched-chain amino acids]]&quot; or BCAA refers to the amino acids having [[aliphatic]] side-chains that are non-linear; these are [[leucine]], [[isoleucine]], and [[valine]]. [[Proline]] is the only [[proteinogenic]] amino acid whose side-group links to the α-amino group and, thus, is also the only proteinogenic amino acid containing a secondary amine at this position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creighton&quot; /&gt; In chemical terms, proline is, therefore, an [[imino acid]], since it lacks a [[amine|primary amino group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Isomerism===
Of the standard α-amino acids, all but [[glycine]] can exist in either of two [[optical isomerism|optical isomers]], called &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; amino acids, which are mirror images of each other (''see also [[Chirality (chemistry)|Chirality]]''). While &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids represent all of the amino acids found in [[protein]]s during translation in the ribosome, &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids are found in some proteins produced by enzyme [[posttranslational modification]]s after translation and translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum, as in exotic sea-dwelling organisms such as [[cone snail]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pisarewicz K, Mora D, Pflueger FC, Fields GB, Marí F |title=Polypeptide chains containing D-gamma-hydroxyvaline |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=127 |issue=17 |pages=6207–15 |year=2005 |month=May |pmid=15853325 |doi=10.1021/ja050088m}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also abundant components of the [[peptidoglycan]] [[cell wall]]s of [[bacteria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=van Heijenoort J |title=Formation of the glycan chains in the synthesis of bacterial peptidoglycan |journal=Glycobiology |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=25R–36R |year=2001 |month=March |pmid=11320055 |doi=10.1093/glycob/11.3.25R}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-serine may act as a [[neurotransmitter]] in the [[brain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wolosker H, Dumin E, Balan L, Foltyn VN |title=D-amino acids in the brain: D-serine in neurotransmission and neurodegeneration |journal=The FEBS Journal |volume=275 |issue=14 |pages=3514–26 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18564180 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06515.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; convention for amino acid configuration refers not to the optical activity of the amino acid itself, but rather to the optical activity of the isomer of [[glyceraldehyde]] from which that amino acid can, in theory, be synthesized (&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glyceraldehyde is dextrorotary; &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-glyceraldehyde is levorotary).
In alternative fashion, the [[Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules|''(S)'' and ''(R)'' designators]] are used to indicate the absolute [[stereochemistry]]. Almost all of the [[proteinogenic amino acid|amino acids in proteins]] are ''(S)'' at the α carbon, with cysteine being ''(R)'' and glycine non-chiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Hatem | first = Salama Mohamed Ali | year = 2006 | url = http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2006/3038/index.html | title = Gas chromatographic determination of Amino Acid Enantiomers in tobacco and bottled wines | publisher = University of Giessen | accessdate = 2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cysteine is unusual since it has a [[sulfur]] atom at the second position in its side-chain, which has a larger [[atomic mass]] than the groups attached to the first carbon, which is attached to the α-carbon in the other standard amino acids, thus the ''(R)'' instead of ''(S)''.

It is also shown in the ionized form, after the carboxyl group has lost a hydrogen atom, which introduces a negative charge, and the amino group has gained a hydrogen, which introduces a positive charge.| An amino acid in its (1) unionized and (2) zwitterionic forms]]

===Zwitterions===
The  amine and carboxylic acid functional groups found in amino acids allow them to have [[Amphoterism|amphiprotic]] properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creighton&quot; /&gt; Carboxylic acid groups (-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H) can be deprotonated to become negative carboxylates (-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ), and α-amino groups (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-) can be protonated to become positive α-ammonium groups (&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-). At pH values greater than the [[pKa]] of the carboxylic acid group (mean for the 20 common amino acids is about 2.2, see the table of amino acid structures above), the negative carboxylate ion predominates. At pH values lower than the pKa of the α-ammonium group (mean for the 20 common α-amino acids is about 9.4), the nitrogen is predominantly protonated as a positively charged α-ammonium group. Thus, at pH between 2.2 and 9.4, the predominant form adopted by α-amino acids contains a negative carboxylate and a positive α-ammonium group, as shown in structure (2) on the right, so has net zero charge. This molecular state is known as a [[zwitterion]], from the German '''Zwitter''' meaning ''hermaphrodite'' or ''hybrid''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Simmons, William J.; Gerhard Meisenberg |title=Principles of medical biochemistry |publisher=Mosby Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-323-02942-6 |oclc= |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below pH 2.2, the predominant form will have a neutral carboxylic acid group and a positive α-ammonium ion (net charge +1), and above pH 9.4, a negative carboxylate and neutral α-amino group (net charge -1). The fully neutral form (structure (1) on the right) is a very minor species in aqueous solution throughout the pH range (less than 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;). Amino acids also exist as zwitterions in the solid phase, and crystallize with salt-like properties unlike typical organic acids or amines.

===Isoelectric point===

At pH values between the two pKa values, the zwitterion predominates, but coexists in [[dynamic equilibrium]] with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the exact midpoint between the two pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Fennema OR |title=Food Chemistry 3rd Ed |publisher=CRC Press |location= |pages=327–8 |isbn=0-8247-9691-8 |oclc= |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This pH is known as the [[isoelectric point]] pI, so pI = ½(pKa&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + pKa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side-chains, the pKa of the side-chain is involved. Thus for Asp, Glu with negative side-chains, pI = ½(pKa&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + pKa&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;), where pKa&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the side-chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side-chain with pKa&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the side-chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive side-chains, pI = ½(pKa&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; + pKa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isolectric point and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar side-chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.

==Occurrence and functions in biochemistry==

One circle is magnified, to show the general structure of an amino acid. This is a simplified model of the repeating structure of protein, illustrating how amino acids are joined together in these molecules. | A [[polypeptide]] is an unbranched chain of amino acids.]]

===Standard amino acids===
{{See also|Protein primary structure|Posttranslational modification}}

Amino acids are the structural units that make up proteins. They join together to form short [[polymer]] chains called [[peptide]]s or longer chains called either [[polypeptides]] or [[protein]]s. These polymers are linear and unbranched, with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids. The process of making proteins is called ''[[translation (biology)|translation]]'' and involves the step-by-step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a [[ribozyme]] that is called a [[ribosome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Rodnina MV, Beringer M, Wintermeyer W |title=How ribosomes make peptide bonds |journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=20–6 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17157507 |doi=10.1016/j.tibs.2006.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order in which the amino acids are added is read through the [[genetic code]] from an [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] template, which is a [[RNA]] copy of one of the organism's [[gene]]s.

Twenty-two amino acids are naturally incorporated into polypeptides and are called [[proteinogenic]] or natural amino acids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creighton&quot; /&gt;  Of these, 20 are encoded by the universal [[genetic code]].  The remaining 2, [[selenocysteine]] and [[pyrrolysine]], are incorporated into proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms.  [[Selenocysteine]] is incorporated when the mRNA being translated includes a [[SECIS element]], which causes the UGA codon to encode selenocysteine instead of a [[stop codon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Driscoll DM, Copeland PR |title=Mechanism and regulation of selenoprotein synthesis |journal=Annual Review of Nutrition |volume=23 |issue= 1|pages=17–40 |year=2003 |pmid=12524431 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.23.011702.073318}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pyrrolysine]] is used by some [[methanogen]]ic [[archaea]] in enzymes that they use to produce [[methane]].

===Non-standard amino acids===
Aside from the 22 standard amino acids, there are many other amino acids that are called ''non-proteinogenic'' or ''non-standard''. Those either are not found in proteins (for example [[carnitine]], [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]]), or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery (for example, [[hydroxyproline]] and [[selenomethionine]]).

Non-standard amino acids that are found in proteins are formed by [[post-translational modification]], which is modification after translation during protein synthesis.  These modifications are often essential for the function or regulation of a protein; for example, the [[carboxylation]] of [[glutamate]] allows for better binding of [[calcium in biology|calcium cations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Vermeer C |title=Gamma-carboxyglutamate-containing proteins and the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase |journal=The Biochemical Journal |volume=266 |issue=3 |pages=625–36 |year=1990 |month=March |pmid=2183788 |pmc=1131186}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[hydroxylation]] of [[proline]] is critical for maintaining [[collagen|connective tissues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bhattacharjee A, Bansal M |title=Collagen structure: the Madras triple helix and the current scenario |journal=IUBMB Life |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=161–72 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=16036578 |doi=10.1080/15216540500090710}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the formation of [[hypusine]] in the [[Eukaryotic initiation factor|translation initiation factor]] [[EIF5A]], through modification of a lysine residue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Park MH |title=The post-translational synthesis of a polyamine-derived amino acid, hypusine, in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) |journal=Journal of Biochemistry |volume=139 |issue=2 |pages=161–9 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16452303 |pmc=2494880 |doi=10.1093/jb/mvj034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such modifications can also determine the localization of the protein, e.g., the addition of long hydrophobic groups can cause a protein to bind to a [[phospholipid]] membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Blenis J, Resh MD |title=Subcellular localization specified by protein acylation and phosphorylation |journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=984–9 |year=1993 |month=December |pmid=8129952 |doi=10.1016/0955-0674(93)90081-Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Beta alanine comparison.png|thumb|250px|right|alt=Comparison of the structures of alanine and beta alanine.

Some nonstandard amino acids are not found in proteins. Examples include [[lanthionine]], [[2-aminoisobutyric acid]], [[dehydroalanine]], and the neurotransmitter [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]]. Nonstandard amino acids often occur as intermediates in the [[metabolic pathway]]s for standard amino acids — for example, [[ornithine]] and [[citrulline]] occur in the [[urea cycle]], part of amino acid [[catabolism]] (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Curis E, Nicolis I, Moinard C, ''et al.'' |title=Almost all about citrulline in mammals |journal=Amino Acids |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=177–205 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16082501 |doi=10.1007/s00726-005-0235-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rare exception to the dominance of α-amino acids in biology is the β-amino acid [[beta alanine]] (3-aminopropanoic acid), which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of [[pantothenic acid]] (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), a component of [[coenzyme A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Coxon KM, Chakauya E, Ottenhof HH, ''et al.'' |title=Pantothenate biosynthesis in higher plants |journal=Biochemical Society Transactions |volume=33 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=743–6 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16042590 |doi=10.1042/BST0330743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In human nutrition===
{{further|[[Protein in nutrition]] and [[Amino acid synthesis]]}}

When taken up into the human body from the diet, the 22 standard amino acids either are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to [[urea]] and [[carbon dioxide]] as a source of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sakami W, Harrington H |title=Amino acid metabolism |journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry |volume=32 |issue= 1|pages=355–98 |year=1963 |pmid=14144484 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.32.070163.002035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a [[transaminase]], the amino group is then fed into the [[urea cycle]].

Pyrrolysine trait is restricted to several microbes, and only one organism has both Pyl and Sec. Of the 22 standard amino acids, 8 are called [[essential amino acid]]s because the [[human body]] cannot [[biosynthesis|synthesize]] them from other [[chemical compound|compounds]] at the level needed for normal growth, so they must be obtained from food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Young VR |title=Adult amino acid requirements: the case for a major revision in current recommendations |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=124 |issue=8 Suppl |pages=1517S–1523S |year=1994 |month=August |pmid=8064412 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8064412}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[cysteine]], [[taurine]], [[tyrosine]], [[histidine]], and [[arginine]] are semiessential amino-acids in children, because the metabolic pathways that synthesize these amino acids are not fully developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Imura K, Okada A |title=Amino acid metabolism in pediatric patients |journal=Nutrition |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=143–8 |year=1998 |month=January |pmid=9437700 |doi=10.1016/S0899-9007(97)00230-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lourenço R, Camilo ME |title=Taurine: a conditionally essential amino acid in humans?

===Non-protein functions===
{{further|[[Amino acid neurotransmitter]]}}

In humans, non-protein amino acids also have important roles as [[metabolic intermediate]]s, such as in the biosynthesis of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]]. Many amino acids are used to synthesize other molecules, for example:

* [[Phenylalanine]] is a precursor of various [[phenylpropanoid]]s, which are important in plant metabolism.

However, not all of the functions of other abundant non-standard amino acids are known. For example, [[taurine]] is a major amino acid in muscle and brain tissues, but, although many functions have been proposed, its precise role in the body has not been determined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brosnan&quot; /&gt;

Amino acids are used for a variety of applications in industry, but their main use is as additives to [[Compound feed|animal feed]]. This is necessary, since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such as [[soybean]]s, either have low levels or lack some of the [[essential amino acid]]s: Lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds.&lt;ref name=Leuchtenberger2005&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Leuchtenberger W, Huthmacher K, Drauz K |title=Biotechnological production of amino acids and derivatives: current status and prospects |journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16195792 |doi=10.1007/s00253-005-0155-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[food industry]] is also a major consumer of amino acids, in particular, [[glutamic acid]], which is used as a [[flavor enhancer]],&lt;ref name=Garattini&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Garattini S |title=Glutamic acid, twenty years later |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=130 |issue=4S Suppl |pages=901S–9S |year=2000 |month=April |pmid=10736350 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10736350}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aspartame]] (aspartyl-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester) as a low-calorie [[artificial sweetener]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Stegink LD |title=The aspartame story: a model for the clinical testing of a food additive |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=46 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=204–15 |year=1987 |month=July |pmid=3300262 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3300262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining production of amino acids is used in the synthesis of [[drug]]s and [[cosmetics]].&lt;ref name=Leuchtenberger2005/&gt;

==Reactions==
As amino acids have both a primary [[amine]] group and a primary [[carboxyl]] group, these chemicals can undergo most of the reactions associated with these functional groups. These include [[nucleophilic addition]], [[amide|amide bond]] formation and [[Alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution|imine formation]] for the amine group and [[esterification]], [[amide|amide bond]] formation and [[decarboxylation]] for the carboxylic acid group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Elmore, Donald Trevor; Barrett, G.

===Chemical synthesis===
{{Main|Peptide synthesis}}
Several methods exist to synthesize amino acids. One of the oldest methods begins with the [[Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky halogenation|bromination]] at the α-carbon of a carboxyic acid. Nucleophilic substitution with [[ammonia]] then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=McMurry |first=John |title=Organic chemistry |publisher=Brooks/Cole |location=Pacific Grove, CA, USA |year=1996 |page=1064 |isbn=0-534-23832-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In alternative fashion, the [[Strecker amino acid synthesis]] involves the treatment of an aldehyde with [[potassium cyanide]] and ammonia, this produces an α-amino nitrile as an intermediate. Hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a α-amino acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Adolph |last1=Strecker |authorlink1=Adolph Strecker |title=Ueber die künstliche Bildung der Milchsäure und einen neuen, dem Glycocoll homologen Körper |journal=Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie |year=1850 |volume=75 |issue=1 |doi=10.1002/jlac.18500750103  |pages=27–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using ammonia or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids, while substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Adolph |last1=Strecker |authorlink1=Adolph Strecker |title=Ueber einen neuen aus Aldehyd - Ammoniak und Blausäure entstehenden Körper |journal=Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie |year=1854 |volume=91 |issue=3 |doi=10.1002/jlac.18540910309 |pages=349–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, using [[ketone]]s, instead of aldehydes, gives α,α-disubstituted amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Masumoto S, Usuda H, Suzuki M, Kanai M, Shibasaki M |title=Catalytic enantioselective Strecker reaction of ketoimines |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=125 |issue=19 |pages=5634–5 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12733893 |doi=10.1021/ja034980}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical synthesis gives [[racemic mixture]]s of α-amino acids as products, but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis |first=F.

At the current time, the most-adopted method is an [[automated]] synthesis on a solid support (e.g., [[polystyrene]] beads), using [[protecting group]]s (e.g., [[Fmoc chloride|Fmoc]] and [[Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate|t-Boc]]) and activating groups (e.g., [[dicyclohexylcarbodiimide|DCC]] and [[diisopropylcarbodiimide|DIC]]).

===Peptide bond formation===
{{Details|Peptide bond}}
[[Image:Peptidformationball.svg|thumbnail|right|400px|The condensation of two amino acids to form a [[peptide bond]]|alt=Two amino acids are shown next to each other. One loses a hydrogen and oxygen from its carboxyl group (COOH) and the other loses a hydrogen from its amino group (NH2). This reaction produces a molecule of water (H2O) and two amino acids joined by a peptide bond (-CO-NH-). The two joined amino acids are called a dipeptide.]]

As both the amine and carboxylic acid groups of amino acids can react to form amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This [[polymerization]] of amino acids is what creates proteins.  This [[condensation reaction]] yields the newly formed [[peptide bond]] and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a [[transfer RNA]] molecule through an [[ester]] bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-dependent reaction carried out by an [[aminoacyl tRNA synthetase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ibba M, Söll D |title=The renaissance of aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=382–7 |year=2001 |month=May |pmid=11375928 |pmc=1083889 |doi=10.1093/embo-reports/kve095 |doi_brokendate=2010-02-18 |url=http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v2/n5/full/embor420.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the [[ribosome]], which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lengyel P, Söll D |title=Mechanism of protein biosynthesis |journal=Bacteriological Reviews |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=264–301 |year=1969 |month=June |pmid=4896351 |pmc=378322 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=4896351}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving towards their C-terminus.

However, not all peptide bonds are formed in this way. In a few cases, peptides are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide [[glutathione]] is an essential part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wu G, Fang YZ, Yang S, Lupton JR, Turner ND |title=Glutathione metabolism and its implications for health |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=134 |issue=3 |pages=489–92 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=14988435 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14988435}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first step [[gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase]] condenses [[cysteine]] and [[glutamic acid]] through a peptide bond formed between the side-chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side-chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with [[glycine]] by [[glutathione synthetase]] to form glutathione.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Meister A |title=Glutathione metabolism and its selective modification |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=263 |issue=33 |pages=17205–8 |year=1988 |month=November |pmid=3053703 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3053703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemistry, peptides are synthesized by a variety of reactions. One of the most-used in [[peptide synthesis|solid-phase peptide synthesis]] uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units. These are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain, which is attached to a solid resin support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Louis A. |last1=Carpino |year=1992 |title=1-Hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole.

===Biosynthesis and catabolism===
In plants, nitrogen is first assimilated into organic compounds in the form of glutamate, formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. In order to form other amino acids, the plant uses [[transaminase]]s to move the amino group to another alpha-keto carboxylic acid. For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jones, Russell Celyn; Buchanan, Bob B.; Gruissem, Wilhelm |title=Biochemistry &amp; molecular biology of plants |publisher=American Society of Plant Physiologists |location=Rockville, Md |year=2000 |pages=371–2 |isbn=0-943088-39-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis, too. Transaminases are also involved in breaking down amino acids. Degrading an amino acid often involves moving its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. In many vertebrates, the amino group is then removed through the [[urea cycle]] and is excreted in the form of [[urea]]. However, amino acid degradation can produce [[uric acid]] or ammonia instead. For example, [[serine dehydratase]] converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Stryer, Lubert; Berg, Jeremy Mark; Tymoczko, John L. |title=Biochemistry |publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=2002 |pages=639–49 |isbn=0-7167-4684-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonstandard amino acids are usually formed through modifications to standard amino acids. For example, [[homocysteine]] is formed through the [[transsulfuration pathway]] or by the demethylation of methionine via the intermediate metabolite [[S-adenosyl methionine]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Brosnan&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Brosnan JT, Brosnan ME |title=The sulfur-containing amino acids: an overview |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=136 |issue=6 Suppl |pages=1636S–1640S |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16702333 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16702333}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[hydroxyproline]] is made by a [[posttranslational modification]] of [[proline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kivirikko KI, Pihlajaniemi T |title=Collagen hydroxylases and the protein disulfide isomerase subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylases |journal=Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology |volume=72 |issue= |pages=325–98 |year=1998 |pmid=9559057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Microorganism]]s and plants can synthesize many uncommon amino acids. For example, some microbes make [[2-aminoisobutyric acid]] and [[lanthionine]], which is a sulfide-bridged derivative of alanine.  Both of these amino acids are found in peptidic [[lantibiotics]] such as [[alamethicin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Whitmore L, Wallace BA |title=Analysis of peptaibol sequence composition: implications for in vivo synthesis and channel formation |journal=European Biophysics Journal |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=233–7 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=14534753 |doi=10.1007/s00249-003-0348-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in plants, [[1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid]] is a small disubstituted cyclic amino acid that is a key intermediate in the production of the plant hormone [[ethylene#Ethylene as a plant hormone|ethylene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Alexander L, Grierson D |title=Ethylene biosynthesis and action in tomato: a model for climacteric fruit ripening |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=53 |issue=377 |pages=2039–55 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12324528 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erf072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physicochemical properties of amino acids==
The 20 amino acids encoded directly by the genetic code can be divided into several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, [[hydrophile|hydrophilicity]] or [[hydrophobe|hydrophobicity]], size, and functional groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Creighton&quot; /&gt; These properties are important for [[protein structure]] and [[protein–protein interaction]]s. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried in the middle of the protein, whereas hydrophilic side-chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent. The [[integral membrane protein]]s tend to have outer rings of exposed [[hydrophobic]] amino acids that anchor them into the [[lipid bilayer]]. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some [[peripheral membrane protein]]s have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. In similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to positively-charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like [[glutamate]] and [[aspartate]], while proteins binding to negatively-charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like [[lysine]] and [[arginine]]. There are different [[hydrophobicity scale]]s of amino acid residues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Dan W. |last1=Urry |title=The change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association: Derivation and evaluation by means of inverse temperature transitions |journal=Chemical Physics Letters |volume=399 |issue=1–3 |pages=177–83 |year=2004 |doi=10.1016/S0009-2614(04)01565-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some amino acids have special properties such as [[cysteine]], that can form covalent [[disulfide bond]]s to other cysteine residues, [[proline]] that forms [[cyclic compound|a cycle]] to the polypeptide backbone, and [[glycine]] that is more flexible than other amino acids.

Many proteins undergo a range of [[posttranslational modification]]s, when additional chemical groups are attached to the amino acids in proteins. Some  modifications can produce hydrophobic [[lipoprotein]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Magee T, Seabra MC |title=Fatty acylation and prenylation of proteins: what's hot in fat |journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=190–6 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15780596 |doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2005.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; or hydrophilic [[glycoprotein]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pilobello KT, Mahal LK |title=Deciphering the glycocode: the complexity and analytical challenge of glycomics |journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Biology |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=300–5 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17500024 |doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2007.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid [[palmitic acid]] to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Smotrys JE, Linder ME |title=Palmitoylation of intracellular signaling proteins: regulation and function |journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry |volume=73 |issue= 1|pages=559–87 |year=2004 |pmid=15189153 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.073954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unk''' is sometimes used instead of '''Xaa''', but is less standard.

In addition, many non-standard amino acids have a specific code. For example, several peptide drugs, such as [[Bortezomib]] and [[MG132]], are [[peptide synthesis|artificially synthesized]] and retain their [[protecting group]]s, which have specific codes. Bortezomib is [[pyrazinoic acid|Pyz]]-Phe-boroLeu, and MG132 is [[Carboxybenzyl|Z]]-Leu-Leu-Leu-al. To aid in the analysis of protein structure, [[Photo-reactive amino acid analog|photocrosslinking amino acid analogues]] are available. These include photoleucine ('''pLeu''') and photomethionine ('''pMet''').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Suchanek M, Radzikowska A, Thiele C |title=Photo-leucine and photo-methionine allow identification of protein-protein interactions in living cells |journal=Nature Methods |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=261–7 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15782218 |doi=10.1038/nmeth752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alan Mathison Turing''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|t|jʊər|ɪ|ŋ}} {{Respell|TEWR|ing}}; 23 June 1912&amp;nbsp;– 7 June 1954), was an English [[mathematician]], [[logician]], [[cryptanalyst]] and [[computer scientist]]. He was highly influential in the development of [[computer science]], providing a formalization of the concepts of &quot;[[algorithm]]&quot; and &quot;computation&quot; with the [[Turing machine]], which played a significant role in the creation of the modern [[computer]].&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt; Turing is widely considered to be the father of computer science and artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Homer, Steven and Alan L. |title=Computability and Complexity Theory|url=http://books.google.com/?id=r5kOgS1IB-8C&amp;pg=PA35|publisher=Springer via Google Books limited view|pages=35|isbn=0-3879-5055-9|accessdate=2011-05-13|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II|the Second World War]], Turing worked for the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS)|Government Code and Cypher School]] at [[Bletchley Park]], Britain's [[cryptanalysis|codebreaking]] centre. For a time he was head of [[Hut 8]], the section responsible for German naval [[cryptanalysis]]. He devised a number of techniques for breaking German [[cipher]]s, including the method of the [[bombe]], an [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] machine that could find settings for the [[Enigma machine]]. After the war he worked at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]], where he created one of the first designs for a stored-program computer, the [[Automatic Computing Engine|ACE]].

Towards the end of his life Turing became interested in [[mathematical biology]]. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of [[morphogenesis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last= Turing | first= A. M. | title = The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal = Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society of London, series B | volume = 237 | pages = 37–72 | year = 1952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he predicted [[Chemical clock|oscillating]] [[chemical reaction]]s such as the [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]], which were first observed in the 1960s.

Turing's homosexuality resulted in a criminal prosecution in 1952, when homosexual acts were still illegal in the United Kingdom. He accepted treatment with female hormones ([[chemical castration]]) as an alternative to prison. He died in 1954, several weeks before his 42nd birthday, from [[cyanide]] poisoning. An inquest determined it was suicide; his mother and some others believed his death was accidental. On 10&amp;nbsp;September 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for the way in which Turing was treated after the war.&lt;ref name = &quot;PM-apology&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8249792.stm | title = PM apology after Turing petition | date = 11 September 2009 | work = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood and youth==
Alan Turing was conceived in [[British Raj|India]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Hodges1983P5&quot; &gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Julius Mathison Turing, was a member of the [[Indian Civil Service]]. Julius and wife Ethel Sara Stoney (1881–1976, daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the Madras Railways) wanted Alan to be brought up in England, so they returned to [[Maida Vale]],&lt;ref name=&quot;englishheritaget&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.001002006005/chooseLetter/T | title = London Blue Plaques | accessdate = 10 February 2007 | work = English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; London, where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a [[blue plaque]] on the outside of the building,&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|381}}&lt;/ref&gt; later the [[Colonnade Hotel (London)|Colonnade Hotel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodges1983P5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;turingorguk&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/memorial.html | title=The Alan Turing Internet Scrapbook | accessdate=26 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an elder brother, John. His father's civil service commission was still active, and during Turing's childhood years his parents travelled between [[Hastings]], England&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and India, leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple.  Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius he was to later prominently display.&lt;ref name=toolbox&gt;{{Cite web|title=Alan Turing&amp;nbsp;– Towards a Digital Mind: Part 1 |first=G. James |last=Jones |date=11 December 2001 |url=http://www.systemtoolbox.com/article.php?history_id=3 |accessdate=27 July 2007 |work=System Toolbox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a day school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards on Sea, at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on, as did many of his subsequent educators. In 1926, at the age of 14, he went on to [[Sherborne School]], a famous [[independent school]] in the [[market town]] of [[Sherborne]] in [[Dorset]]. His first day of term coincided with the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|General Strike]] in Britain, but so determined was he to attend his first day that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied more than {{convert|60|mi|km}} from [[Southampton]] to school, stopping overnight at an inn.&lt;ref name=metamagical&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metamagical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern |first=Douglas R. |last=Hofstadter |year=1985 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-04566-9 |oclc=230812136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KingsCollegeChapel.jpg|thumb|[[King's College, Cambridge]], where the computer room is named after Turing, who became a student there in 1931 and a Fellow in 1935]]
Turing's natural inclination toward mathematics and science did not earn him respect with some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the [[classics]]. His headmaster wrote to his parents: &quot;I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at Public School, he must aim at becoming ''educated''. If he is to be solely a ''Scientific Specialist'', he is wasting his time at a Public School&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having even studied elementary [[calculus]]. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered [[Albert Einstein]]'s work; not only did he grasp it, but he extrapolated Einstein's questioning of [[Newton's laws of motion]] from a text in which this was never made explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing's hopes and ambitions at school were raised by the close friendship he developed with  a slightly older fellow student, Christopher Morcom, who was Turing's first love interest. Morcom died suddenly only a few weeks into their last term at Sherborne, from complications of [[bovine tuberculosis]], contracted after drinking infected cow's milk as a boy.&lt;ref name=teuscher&gt;** {{Cite book|last=Teuscher |first=Christof (ed.) |authorlink=Christof Teuscher |title=Alan Turing: Life and Legacy of a Great Thinker |year=2004 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]] |isbn=3-540-20020-7 |oclc=53434737 62339998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing's religious faith was shattered and he became an atheist. He adopted the conviction that all phenomena, including the workings of the human brain, must be [[materialism|materialistic]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gray, [http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/turing.html Alan Turing]{{dead link|date=December 2010}} Time Magazine's Most Important People of the Century, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; but he still believed in the survival of the spirit after death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/spirit.html The Inspiration of Life and Death, 1928–1932] Alan Turing Scrapbook&lt;/ref&gt;

==University and work on computability==
[[File:Alan Turing Memorial Closer.jpg|thumb|Alan Turing memorial statue in [[Whitworth Gardens|Sackville Park]], Manchester]]
After Sherborne, Turing went to study at [[King's College, Cambridge]]. He was an undergraduate there from 1931 to 1934, graduating with first-class honours in [[Mathematics]], and in 1935 was elected a [[fellow]] at King's on the strength of a dissertation on the [[central limit theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;See Section 3 of John Aldrich, &quot;England and Continental Probability in the Inter-War Years&quot;, Journal Electronique d'Histoire des Probabilités et de la Statistique, vol. 5/2  [http://www.jehps.net/decembre2009.html Decembre 2009] Journal Electronique d'Histoire des Probabilités et de la Statistique&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, German mathematician, [[David Hilbert]] had called attention to the entscheidungsproblem (decision problem). In his momentous paper &quot;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]''&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last= Turing | first= A. M. |year=1936 | publication-date = 1936–37 | title = On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem | periodical = Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society | series = 2 | volume = 42 | pages = 230–65 | doi= 10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230 | url = http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/activities/ieg/e-library/sources/tp2-ie.pdf}} (and {{Cite news| last = Turing | first = A.M. | publication-date = 1937 | title = On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem: A correction | periodical = Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society | series = 2 | volume = 43 | pages = 544–6 | doi = 10.1112/plms/s2-43.6.544 | year = 1938 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Turing reformulated [[Kurt Gödel]]'s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with what became known as [[Turing machine]]s, formal and simple devices. He proved that some such machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an [[algorithm]]. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the ''Entscheidungsproblem'' by first showing that the [[halting problem]] for Turing machines is [[Decision problem|undecidable]]: it is not possible to decide, in general, algorithmically whether a given Turing machine will ever halt. While his proof was published subsequent to [[Alonzo Church|Alonzo Church's]] equivalent proof in respect to his [[lambda calculus]], Turing was unaware of Church's work at the time.

In his memoirs Turing wrote that he was disappointed about the reception of this 1936 paper and that only two people had reacted&amp;nbsp;– these being Heinrich Scholz and [[R. B. Braithwaite|Richard Bevan Braithwaite]].

Turing's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive. It was also novel in its notion of a 'Universal (Turing) Machine', the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other machine.  Or in other words, is provably capable of computing anything that is computable.  Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in [[computation|theory of computation]], the simplest [[Turing machine examples|example]] being a 2 state 3 symbol Turing machine discovered by [[Stephen Wolfram]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/10/college-kid-pro/ College Kid Proves That Wolfram's Turing Machine is the Simplest Universal Computer] Wired 24 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper also introduces the notion of [[definable number]]s.

From September 1936 to July 1938 he spent most of his time at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], New Jersey, studying under [[Alonzo Church]]. As well as his pure mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1938 he obtained his Ph.D. from Princeton; his dissertation introduced the notion of relative computing, where Turing machines are augmented with so-called [[oracle machine|oracles]], allowing a study of problems that cannot be solved by a Turing machine.

Back in Cambridge, he attended lectures by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] about the [[foundations of mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two argued and disagreed, with Turing defending [[Philosophy of mathematics#Formalism|formalism]] and Wittgenstein arguing that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths but rather invents them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also started to work part-time with the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS)]].

==Cryptanalysis==
[[File:Turing flat.jpg|thumb|Two cottages in the stable yard at [[Bletchley Park]]. Turing worked here from 1939 to 1940, when he moved to Hut 8.]]
During the Second World War, Turing was a main participant in the efforts at [[Bletchley Park]] to break German ciphers. Building on cryptanalysis work carried out in Poland by [[Marian Rejewski]], [[Jerzy Różycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]] from [[Cipher Bureau]] before the war, he contributed several insights into breaking both the [[Enigma machine]] and the [[Lorenz SZ 40/42]] (a [[Teleprinter]] (Teletype) cipher attachment codenamed ''Tunny'' by the British), and was, for a time, head of [[Hut 8]], the section responsible for reading German naval signals.

From September 1938, Turing had been working part-time (notionally for the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|British Foreign Office]]) with the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GCCS), the British code breaking organisation. He worked on the problem of the German Enigma machine, and collaborated with [[Dilly Knox]], a senior [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCCS]] codebreaker.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Copeland]], &quot;Colossus and the Dawning of the Computer Age&quot;, p. 352 in ''Action This Day'', 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  On 4 September 1939, the day after the UK declared war on Germany, Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of GCCS.&lt;ref name=Copeland2006p378&gt;Copeland, 2006 p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Turing was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for his wartime services, but his work remained secret for many years.

Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. [[I.J. Good|Jack Good]], a cryptanalyst who worked with him, is quoted by Ronald Lewin as having said of Turing: &lt;blockquote&gt;in the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever, and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off. His bicycle had a fault: the chain would come off at regular intervals. Instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand. Another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewin|1978|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While working at Bletchley, Turing, a talented long-distance runner, occasionally ran the {{convert|40|mi}} to London when he was needed for high-level meetings.&lt;ref&gt;''Bodyguard of Lies'', by [[Anthony Cave Brown]], 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turing–Welchman bombe===
Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park,&lt;ref name=Copeland2006p378 /&gt; Turing had specified an electromechanical machine which could help break Enigma faster than [[bomba (cryptography)|bomba]] from 1938, the [[bombe]], named after and building upon the original Polish-designed bomba. The bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician [[Gordon Welchman]], became one of the primary tools, and the major automated one, used to attack Enigma-protected message traffic.
[[File:Bombe-rebuild.jpg|thumbnail|A complete and working replica of a bombe at [[Bletchley Park]]]]

Jack Good opined: &lt;blockquote&gt;Turing's most important contribution, I ''think'', was of part of the design of the bombe, the cryptanalytic machine. He had the idea that you could use, in effect, a theorem in logic which sounds to the untrained ear rather absurd; namely that from a contradiction, you can deduce ''everything.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1155383/episodes &quot;The Men Who Cracked Enigma&quot;], Episode 4 in the UKTV History Channel documentary series [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1157073/ &quot;Heroes of World War II&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The bombe searched for possibly correct settings used for an Enigma message (i.e., rotor order, rotor settings, etc.), and used a suitable ''[[crib (cryptanalysis)|crib]]'': a fragment of probable [[plaintext]]. For each possible setting of the rotors (which had of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; states, or 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; for the four-rotor U-boat variant),&lt;ref&gt;Professor Jack Good in &quot;The Men Who Cracked Enigma&quot;, 2003: with his caveat: &quot;if my memory is correct&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib, implemented electrically. The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred, and ruled out that setting, moving onto the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. Turing's bombe was first installed on 18 March 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war.&lt;ref name=codebreaker&gt;{{Cite web|title=Alan Turing, Codebreaker and Computer Pioneer |last=Copeland |first=Jack |coauthors=Diane Proudfoot |month=May | year=2004 |url=http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/codebreaker.html |accessdate=27 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hut 8 and Naval Enigma===
[[File:AlanTuring-Bletchley.jpg|thumbnail|Statue of Turing by [[Stephen Kettle]] at [[Bletchley Park]], commissioned by the American philanthropist [[Sidney E Frank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bletchley Park Unveils Statue Commemorating Alan Turing |url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/docview.rhtm/454075 |accessdate=30 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma &quot;because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself&quot;.&lt;ref name=MahonP14&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1939, Turing solved the essential part of the naval [[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator]] system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services.&lt;ref name=MahonP14 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|pp=184–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same night that he solved the naval indicator system, he conceived the idea of ''[[Banburismus]]'', a sequential statistical technique (what [[Abraham Wald]] later called [[Sequential analysis|Sequential Analysis]]) to assist in breaking naval Enigma, &quot;though I was not sure that it would work in practice, and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken&quot;.&lt;ref name=MahonP14 /&gt;  For this he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the ''[[Ban (information)|Ban]]''. Banburismus could rule out certain orders of the Enigma rotors, substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes.

In 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 co-worker Joan Clarke, a fellow mathematician, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly &quot;unfazed&quot; by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|pp=176–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed ''[[Turingery]]'' (or jokingly ''[[Turingismus]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use against the [[Lorenz cipher]] messages produced by the Germans' new Geheimschreiber machine (''secret writer''). This was codenamed ''Tunny '' at Bletchley Park. He also introduced the Tunny team to [[Tommy Flowers]] who, under the guidance of [[Max Newman]], went on to build the [[Colossus computer]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer, which replaced a simpler prior machine (the [[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)|Heath Robinson]]) and whose superior speed allowed the brute-force decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the daily changing cyphers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; A frequent misconception is that Turing was a key figure in the design of Colossus; this was not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|pp=382,383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked with U.S. Navy cryptanalysts on Naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington, and assisted at [[Bell Labs]] with the development of [[secure speech]] devices. He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence, [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8, although Alexander had been ''de facto'' head for some time—Turing having little interest in the day-to-day running of the section. Turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.

Alexander wrote as follows about his contribution: &lt;blockquote&gt;There should be no question in anyone's mind that Turing's work was the biggest factor in Hut 8's success. In the early days he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the Hut but he also shared with Welchman and Keen the chief credit for the invention of the Bombe. It is always difficult to say that anyone is absolutely indispensable but if anyone was indispensable to Hut 8 it was Turing. The pioneer's work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make everything seem easy and many of us in Hut 8 felt that the magnitude of Turing's contribution was never fully realised by the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Harvnb | Alexander | circa 1945 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the latter part of the war he moved to work at [[Hanslope#Hanslope Park|Hanslope Park]], where he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable [[secure voice]] communications machine codenamed ''[[Delilah (secure speech)|Delilah]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was intended for different applications, lacking capability for use with long-distance radio transmissions, and in any case, Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though Turing demonstrated it to officials by encrypting/decrypting a recording of a [[Winston Churchill]] speech, Delilah was not adopted for use. Turing also consulted with [[Bell Labs]] on the development of [[SIGSALY]], a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war.

==Early computers and the Turing test==
From 1945 to 1947 Turing lived in Church Street, Hampton&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|1619}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he worked on the design of the [[ACE (computer)|ACE]] (Automatic Computing Engine) at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]]. He presented a paper on 19 February 1946, which was the first detailed design of a [[stored-program computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ACE was a feasible design, the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year. While he was at Cambridge, the [[Pilot ACE]] was built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10&amp;nbsp;May 1950.

In 1948, he was appointed [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in the [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester|Mathematics Department]] at [[Victoria University of Manchester|Manchester]] (now part of [[The University of Manchester]]). In 1949, he became Deputy Director of the computing laboratory at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]], and worked on software for one of the earliest [[Von Neumann architecture|stored-program]] computers—the [[Manchester Mark 1]]. During this time he continued to do more abstract work, and in &quot;[[Computing machinery and intelligence]]&quot; (Mind, October 1950), Turing addressed the problem of [[artificial intelligence]], and proposed an experiment which became known as the [[Turing test]], an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called &quot;intelligent&quot;. The idea was that a computer could be said to &quot;think&quot; if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stevan Harnad|Harnad, Stevan]] (2008)  [http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/7741 The Annotation Game: On Turing (1950) on Computing, Machinery and Intelligence]. In: Epstein, Robert &amp; Peters, Grace (Eds.) ''Parsing the Turing Test: Philosophical and Methodological Issues in the Quest for the Thinking Computer''. Springer&lt;/ref&gt; In the paper, Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind, it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child's mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A [[Turing test#Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA|reversed]] form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet; the [[CAPTCHA]] test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer.

In 1948, Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, [[D. G. Champernowne]], began writing a [[chess]] program for a computer that did not yet exist. In 1952, lacking a computer powerful enough to execute the program, Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer, taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1356927 Alan Turing vs Alick Glennie (1952) &quot;Turing Test&quot;] Chessgames.com&lt;/ref&gt; The program lost to Turing's colleague [[Alick Glennie]], although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne's wife.

His [[Turing Test]] was a significant and characteristically provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding [[artificial intelligence]], which continues after more than half a century.&lt;ref&gt;Saygin, A.P., Cicekli, I., &amp; Akman, V. (2000) Turing Test: 50 years later. Minds and Machines, Vol. 10, pp&amp;nbsp;463–518.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also invented the [[LU decomposition]] method used today for solving an equations matrix in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intusoft.com/nlhtm/nl71.htm SPICE 1 2 3 and beyond&amp;nbsp;... Intusoft Newsletter, August 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pattern formation and mathematical biology==
Turing worked from 1952 until his death in 1954 on [[mathematical biology]], specifically [[morphogenesis]]. He published one paper on the subject called ''[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]'' in 1952, putting forth the Turing hypothesis of pattern formation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061128093244.htm &quot;Control Mechanism For Biological Pattern Formation Decoded&quot;] ''ScienceDaily'', 30 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; His central interest in the field was understanding [[Leonardo of Pisa|Fibonacci]] [[phyllotaxis]], the existence of [[Fibonacci number]]s in plant structures. He used [[reaction–diffusion equations]] which are central to the field of [[pattern formation]]. Later papers went unpublished until 1992 when ''Collected Works of A.M. Turing'' was published. His contribution is considered a seminal piece of work in this field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swintons.net/deodands/archives/000087.html Turing's Last, Lost work]{{dead link|date=December 2010}} Swintons&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction for indecency==
In January 1952, Turing met Arnold Murray outside a cinema in Manchester. After a lunch date, Turing invited Murray to spend the weekend with him at his house, an invitation which Murray accepted although he did not show up. The pair met again in Manchester the following Monday, when Murray agreed to accompany Turing to the latter's house. A few weeks later Murray visited Turing's house again, and apparently spent the night there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Murray helped an accomplice to break into his house, Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation, Turing acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were illegal in the United Kingdom at that time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=458}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so both were charged with gross indecency under [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885#Section 11|Section 11]] of the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]], the same crime for which [[Oscar Wilde]] had been convicted more than fifty years earlier.&lt;ref name=LeavittP268&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing was given a choice between imprisonment or probation conditional on his agreement to undergo [[hormone|hormonal]] [[chemical castration|treatment]] designed to reduce [[libido]]. He accepted [[chemical castration]] via [[oestrogen]] hormone injections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/turing_a,2.html Turing, Alan (1912–1954)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance, and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for [[GCHQ]]. His British passport was not revoked, though he was denied entry to the United States after his conviction.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  At the time, there was acute public anxiety about spies and homosexual entrapment by Soviet agents,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the recent exposure of the first two members of the [[Cambridge Five]], [[Guy Burgess]] and [[Donald Duart Maclean|Donald Maclean]], as [[KGB]] [[double agent]]s. Turing was never accused of [[espionage]] but, as with all who had worked at [[Bletchley Park]], was prevented from discussing his war work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 8 June 1954, Turing's cleaner found him dead; he had died the previous day. A [[post-mortem]] examination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. When his body was discovered an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=488}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was delivered. An [[inquest]] determined that he had committed suicide, and he was cremated at [[Woking Crematorium]] on 12&amp;nbsp;June 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=529}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing's mother argued strenuously that the ingestion was accidental, caused by her son's careless storage of laboratory chemicals. Biographer [[Andrew Hodges]] suggests that Turing may have killed himself in an ambiguous way quite deliberately, to give his mother some [[plausible deniability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=488, 489}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the 1937 film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'', his favourite [[fairy tale]], pointing out that he took &quot;an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Witch immerses her apple in the poisonous brew.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1966, the [[Turing Award]] has been given annually by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] to a person for technical contributions to the computing community. It is widely considered to be the computing world's highest honour, equivalent to the [[Nobel Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/press-room/news-releases-2007/turingaward/|title=ACM'S Turing Award Prize Raised To $250,000|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] press release|date=27 July 2007|accessdate=16 October 2008|author=Steven Geringer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Breaking the Code]]'' is a 1986 play by [[Hugh Whitemore]] about Alan Turing. The play ran in [[West End theatre|London's West End]] beginning in November 1986 and on Broadway from 15 November 1987 to 10 April 1988. There was also a 1996 BBC television production. In all cases, [[Derek Jacobi]] played Turing. The Broadway production was nominated for three [[Tony Award]]s including Best Actor in a Play, Best Featured Actor in a Play, and Best Direction of a Play, and for two [[Drama Desk Award]]s, for Best Actor and Best Featured Actor. Turing was one of four mathematicians examined in the 2008 BBC documentary entitled &quot;Dangerous Knowledge&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/dangerous-knowledge.shtml|title=Dangerous Knowledge|publisher=BBC Four|date=11 June 2008|accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 1998, on what would have been Turing's 86th birthday, [[Andrew Hodges]], his biographer, unveiled an official [[English Heritage]] [[Blue Plaque]] at his birthplace and childhood home in Warrington Crescent, London, later the Colonnade hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.turing.org.uk/bio/oration.html | title=Unveiling the official Blue Plaque on Alan Turing's Birthplace | accessdate=26 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.blueplaque.com/detail.php?plaque_id=348 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071013143212/http://www.blueplaque.com/detail.php?plaque_id=348 | archivedate=13 October 2007 | title=About this Plaque&amp;nbsp;– Alan Turing | accessdate=25 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To mark the 50th anniversary of his death, a memorial plaque was unveiled on 7 June 2004 at his former residence, Hollymeade, in [[Wilmslow]], Cheshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|3276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 2000, [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] issued a set of [[postage stamp|stamps]] to celebrate the greatest achievements of the twentieth century, one of which carries a recognisable portrait of Turing against a background of repeated 0s and 1s, and is captioned: &quot;1937: Alan Turing's theory of digital computing&quot;.

On 28 October 2004, a bronze statue of Alan Turing sculpted by [[John W Mills]] was unveiled at the [[University of Surrey]] in Guildford, marking the 50th anniversary of Turing's death; it portrays him carrying his books across the campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;univsurrey&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.surrey.ac.uk/press/oct2004/281004a/ |title=The Earl of Wessex unveils statue of Alan Turing |accessdate=10 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Princeton Alumni Weekly named Turing the second most significant alumnus in the history of [[Princeton University]], second only to President [[James Madison]].

A 1.5-ton, life-size statue of Turing was unveiled on 19 June 2007 at Bletchley Park. Built from approximately half a million pieces of Welsh [[slate]], it was sculpted by [[Stephen Kettle]], having been commissioned by the late American billionaire [[Sidney Frank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/docview.rhtm/454075/article.html Bletchley Park Unveils Statue Commemorating Alan Turing], Bletchley Park press release, 20 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing has been honoured in various ways in Manchester, the city where he worked towards the end of his life. In 1994, a stretch of the [[A6010 road]] (the [[Manchester]] city intermediate ring road) was named Alan Turing Way. A bridge carrying this road was widened, and carries the name Alan Turing Bridge. A [[Alan Turing Memorial|statue of Turing]] was unveiled in [[Manchester]] on 23 June 2001. It is in [[Sackville Park]], between the [[University of Manchester]] building on Whitworth Street and the [[Canal Street, Manchester|Canal Street]] [[gay village]]. The memorial statue, depicts the &quot;father of Computer Science&quot; sitting on a bench at a central position in the park. The statue was unveiled on Turing's birthday.

Turing is shown holding an apple—a symbol classically used to represent forbidden love, the object that inspired [[Isaac Newton]]'s theory of gravitation, and the means of Turing's own death.  The cast bronze bench carries in relief the text 'Alan Mathison Turing 1912–1954', and the motto 'Founder of Computer Science' as it would appear if encoded by an [[Enigma machine]]: 'IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ'.

A plinth at the statue's feet says 'Father of computer science, mathematician, logician, wartime codebreaker, victim of prejudice'. There is also a [[Bertrand Russell]] quotation saying 'Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture.' The sculptor buried his old [[Amstrad]] computer, which was an early popular home computer, under the plinth, as a tribute to &quot;the godfather of all modern computers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerburied&quot;&gt;see {{Cite news | title = Computer buried in tribute to genius | publisher = Manchester Evening News| date = 15 June 2001 | url = http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/27/27595_computer_buried_in_tribute_to_genius.html | accessdate = 23 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, ''Time Magazine'' named Turing as one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 Most Important People of the 20th Century]] for his role in the creation of the modern computer, and stated: &quot;The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine.&quot;&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{Cite web| title =Alan Turing&amp;nbsp;– Time 100 People of the Century |url=http://205.188.238.181/time/time100/scientist/profile/turing.html |publisher=''[[Time Magazine]]'' |quote=The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Turing was ranked twenty-first on the ''BBC'' nationwide poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2208671.stm | title = 100 great British heroes | date = 21 August 2002 | work = BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The logo of [[Apple Inc.|Apple computer]] is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to Alan Turing, with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html |title=Logos that became legends: Icons from the world of advertising|work= The Independent |publisher=www.independent.co.uk |accessdate=14 September 2009 | location=London | date=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the designer of the logo&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://creativebits.org/interview/interview_rob_janoff_designer_apple_logo | title = Interview with Rob Janoff, designer of the Apple logo | publisher = creativebits| accessdate = 14 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the company deny that there is any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, actor/playwright Jade Esteban Estrada portrayed Turing in the solo musical, &quot;ICONS: The Lesbian and Gay History of the World, Vol. 4.&quot;

Turing is mentioned several times in the DLC for the 2K Games &quot;Bioshock 2&quot; He is mentioned several times by the voice actor who portrays C.M. Porter. There is also a telegram in Porter's office requesting he come to London and work with Turing.

Turing is featured in the [[Neal Stephenson]] novel &quot;[[Cryptonomicon]].&quot;

In February 2011, Turing's papers from the Second World War were bought for the nation with an 11th-hour bid by the [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]], allowing them to stay at Bletchley Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/feb/25/turing-papers-auction-bid-bletchley Turing papers to stay in UK after 11th-hour auction bid at guardian.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government apology===
In August 2009, [[John Graham-Cumming]] started a petition urging the British Government to posthumously apologise to Alan Turing for prosecuting him as a homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thousands call for Turing apology |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8226509.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=31&amp;nbsp;August 2009 |accessdate=31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Petition seeks apology for Enigma code-breaker Turing | url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/09/01/alan.turing.petition/index.html | publisher = CNN | date = 01&amp;nbsp;September 2009 | accessdate = 1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition received thousands of signatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMapology&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The petition was only open to UK citizens.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] acknowledged the petition, releasing a statement on 10 September 2009 apologising and describing Turing's treatment as &quot;appalling&quot;:&lt;ref name = &quot;PM-apology&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PMapology&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title = Treatment of Alan Turing was &quot;appalling&quot; | url = http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20571 | publisher = Prime Minister's Office| date = 10 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thousands of people have come together to demand justice for Alan Turing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated. While Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can't put the clock back, his treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what happened to him&amp;nbsp;... So on behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan's work I am very proud to say: we're sorry, you deserved so much better.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMapology&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Tributes by universities===
[[File:Alan Turing Building 1.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Alan Turing Building]] at the University of Manchester]]

*The [[EISTI|École Internationale des Sciences du Traitement de l'Information]] has named its recently acquired third building &quot;Turing&quot;.
*The [[University of Ghent]] has one of its main computer rooms (in a building used mostly by mathematicians and computing scientists) named for Alan Turing.
*The [[University of Oregon]] has a bust of Turing on the side of the Deschutes Hall, the computer science building.

===Centenary commemoration===

To mark the 100th anniversary of Turing's birth, the Turing Centenary Advisory Committee, working with [[The University of Manchester]] faculty members and a broad spectrum of people from Cambridge and Bletchley Park, are planning a year of international events in 2012. Events are scheduled in many countries around the world including [[Cambodia]], [[Brazil]] and [[China]]. The keystone events will be a three-day conference in Manchester, UK in June examining Turing's mathematical and code-breaking achievements, and a Turing Centenary Conference in Cambridge organised by King's College and the association Computability in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/feb/23/northerner-alan-turing-centenary-celebrations?cat=uk&amp;type=article The Northerner: Alan Turing, computer pioneer, has centenary marked by a year of celebrations]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|the geometric quantity}}

[[File:Area.svg|right|thumb|The combined area of these three [[shapes]] is between 15 and 16 [[square (geometry)|squares]].]]
'''Area''' is a [[quantity]] that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional [[surface]] or [[shape]] in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]].  Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of [[paint]] necessary to cover the surface with a single coat.  It is the two-dimensional analog of the [[length]] of a [[plane curve|curve]] (a one-dimensional concept) or the [[volume]] of a [[solid geometry|solid]] (a three-dimensional concept).

The area of a shape can be measured by comparing the shape to [[square (geometry)|square]]s of a fixed size.  In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the standard unit of area is the [[square metre]] (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which is the area of a square whose sides are one [[metre]] long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/11/12/ Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]&lt;/ref&gt;  A shape with an area of three square metres would have the same area as three such squares.  In [[mathematics]], the [[unit square]] is defined to have area one, and the area of any other shape or surface is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]] [[real number]].

There are several well-known [[formula]]s for the areas of simple shapes such as [[triangle]]s, [[rectangle]]s, and [[circle]]s.  Using these formulas, the area of any [[polygon]] can be found by [[Polygon triangulation|dividing the polygon into triangles]].&lt;ref name= bkos&gt;{{Citation|author = [[Mark de Berg]], [[Marc van Kreveld]], [[Mark Overmars]], and [[Otfried Schwarzkopf]] | year = 2000 | title = Computational Geometry | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]] | edition = 2nd revised | isbn = 3-540-65620-0}} Chapter 3: Polygon Triangulation: pp.45–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  For shapes with curved boundary, [[calculus]] is usually required to compute the area.  Indeed, the problem of determining the area of plane figures was a major motivation for the [[History of calculus|historical development of calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of the Calculus and Its Conceptual Development |publisher=Dover |year=1959 |isbn=486606094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a solid shape such as a [[sphere]], [[Cone (geometry)|cone]], or [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], the area of its boundary surface is called the [[surface area]].  Formulas for the surface areas of simple shapes were computed by the [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greeks]], but computing the surface area of a more complicated shape usually requires [[multivariable calculus]].

Area plays a important role in modern mathematics.  In addition to its obvious importance in [[geometry]] and calculus, area is related to the definition of [[determinant]]s in [[linear algebra]], and is a basic property of surfaces in [[differential geometry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;doCarmo&quot;&gt;do Carmo, Manfredo. Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces. Prentice-Hall, 1976. Page 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[analysis]], the area of a subset of the plane is defined using [[Lebesgue measure]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudin&quot;&gt;Walter Rudin, ''Real and Complex Analysis'', McGraw-Hill, 1966, ISBN 0-07-100276-6.&lt;/ref&gt; though not every subset is measurable.  In general, area in higher mathematics is seen as a special case of [[volume]] for two-dimensional regions.

==Units==
[[Image:SquareMeterQuadrat.JPG|thumb|right|A square metre [[quadrat]] made of PVC pipe.]]
Every [[unit of length]] has a corresponding unit of area, namely the area of a square with the given side length.  Thus areas can be measure in [[square metre]]s (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), square centimetres (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), square millimetres (mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[square kilometre]]s (km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[square foot|square feet]] (ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[square yard]]s (yd&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[square mile]]s (mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and so forth.  Algebraically, these units can be thought of as the [[square (algebra)|squares]] of the corresponding length units.

The SI unit of area is the square metre, which is considered an [[SI derived unit]].

===Conversions===
[[Image:Area conversion - square mm in a square cm.png|thumb|right|320px|Although there are 10 mm in 1 cm, there are 100 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.]]
The conversion between two square units is the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the conversion between the corresponding length units.  For example, since
:1 [[foot (unit)|foot]] = 12 [[inch]]es,
the relationship between square feet and square inches is
:1 square foot = 144 square inches,
where 144 = 12&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 12 × 12.  Similarly:
* 1 square kilometer = [[million|1,000,000]] square meters
* 1 square meter = [[10000 (number)|10,000]] square centimetres = 1,000,000 square millimetres
* 1 square centimetre = [[100 (number)|100]] square millimetres
* 1 square yard = [[9 (number)|9]] square feet
* 1 square mile = 3,097,600 square yards = 27,878,400 square feet
In addition,
* 1 square inch = 6.4516 square centimetres
* 1 square foot = {{gaps|0.092|903|04}} square metres
* 1 square yard = {{gaps|0.836|127|36}} square metres
* 1 square mile = {{gaps|2.589|988|110|336}} square kilometres

===Other units===
{{See also|Category:Units of area}}
There are several other common units for area.  The [[are (unit)|are]] was the original unit of area in the [[metric system]], with
*1 are = 100 square metres
Though the are has fallen out of use, the [[hectare]] is still commonly used to measure land:
*1 hectare = 100 ares = 10,000 square metres = 0.01 square kilometres
Other uncommon metric units of area include the [[tetrad]], the [[hectad]], and the [[myriad]].

The [[acre]] is also commonly used to measure land areas, where
*1 acre = 4,840 square yards = 43,560 square feet.
An acre is approximately 40% of a hectare.

==Basic area formulae==
===Rectangles===
[[Image:RectangleLengthWidth.svg|thumb|right|180px|The area of this rectangle is&amp;nbsp;{{math|''lw''}}.]]
The most basic area formula is the formula for the area of a [[rectangle]].  Given a rectangle with length {{math|''l''}} and {{math|''w''}}, the formula for the area is
:{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} ''lw''}} &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;(rectangle).&lt;/big&gt;
That is, the area of the rectangle is the length multiplied by the width.  As a special case, the area of a square with side length {{math|''s''}} is given by the formula
:{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;(square).&lt;/big&gt;

The formula for the area of a rectangle follows directly from the basic properties of area, and is sometimes taken as a [[definition]] or [[axiom]].  On the other hand, if [[geometry]] is developed before [[arithmetic]], this formula can be used to define [[multiplication]] of [[real number]]s.

[[Image:ParallelogramArea.svg|thumb|left|180px|Equal area figures.]]

===Dissection formulae===
Most other simple formulae for area follow from the method of [[dissection (geometry)|dissection]].  
This involves cutting a shape into pieces, whose areas must [[addition|sum]] to the area of the original shape.

For example, any [[parallelogram]] can be subdivided into a [[trapezoid]] and a [[right triangle]], as shown in figure to the left.  If the triangle is moved to the other side of the trapezoid, then the resulting figure is a rectangle.  It follows that the area of the parallelogram is the same as the area of the rectangle:
:{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} ''bh''}} &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;(parallelogram).&lt;/big&gt;
[[Image:TriangleArea.svg|thumb|right|180px|Two equal triangles.]]However, the same parallelogram can also be cut along a [[diagonal]] into two [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] triangles, as shown in the figure to the right.  It follows that the area of each triangle is half the area of the parallelogram:
:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{1}{2}bh&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;(triangle).&lt;/big&gt;
Similar arguments can be used to find area formulae for the [[trapezoid]] and the [[rhombus]], as well as more complicated [[polygon]]s.

===Circles===
[[Image:CircleArea.svg|thumb|right|A circle can be divided into [[sector]]s which rearrange to form an approximate [[parallelogram]].]]
{{main|Area of a circle}}
The formula for the area of a [[circle]] is based on a similar method.  Given a circle of radius {{math|''r''}}, it is possible to partition the circle into [[sector]]s, as shown in the figure to the right.  Each sector is approximately triangular in shape, and the sectors can be rearranged to form and approximate parallelogram.  The height of this parallelogram is {{math|''r''}}, and the width is half the [[circumference]] of the circle, or {{math|''πr''}}.  Thus, the total area of the circle is {{math|''r'' × ''πr''}}, or {{math|''πr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}:
:{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} ''πr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;(circle).&lt;/big&gt;
Though the dissection used in this formula is only approximate, the error becomes smaller and smaller as the circle is partitioned into more and more sectors.  The [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of the areas of the approximate parallelograms is exactly {{math|''πr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which is the area of the circle.

This argument is actually a simple application of the ideas of [[calculus]].  In ancient times, the [[method of exhaustion]] was used in a similar way to find the area of the circle, and this method is now recognized as a precursor to [[integral calculus]].  Using modern methods, the area of a circle can be computed using a [[definite integral]]:
:&lt;math&gt;A \;=\; \int_{-r}^r 2\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\,dx \;=\; \pi r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

===Surface area===
[[Image:Archimedes sphere and cylinder.svg|right|thumb|180px|[[Archimedes]] showed that the surface area and volume of a [[sphere]] is exactly 2/3 of the area and volume of the surrounding [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] surface.]]
Most basic formulae for [[surface area]] can be obtained by cutting surfaces and flattening them out.  For example, if the side surface of a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] (or any [[prism (geometry)|prism]]) is cut lengthwise, the surface can be flattened out into a rectangle.  Similarly, if a cut is made along the side of a [[cone (geometry)|cone]], the side surface can be flattened out into a [[sector]] of a circle, and the resulting area computed.

The formula for the surface area of a [[sphere]] is more difficult: because the surface of a sphere has nonzero [[Gaussian curvature]], it cannot be flattened out.  The formula for the surface area of a sphere was first obtained by [[Archimedes]] in his work ''[[On the Sphere and Cylinder]]''.  The formula is
:{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} 4''πr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;(sphere).&lt;/big&gt;
where {{math|''r''}} is the radius of the sphere.  As with the formula for the area of a circle, any derivation of this formula inherently uses methods similar to [[calculus]].

==Additional formulae==
===Areas of 2-dimensional figures===
*a [[triangle (geometry)|triangle]]: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac12Bh&lt;/math&gt; (where ''B'' is any side, and ''h'' is the distance from the line on which ''B'' lies to the other vertex of the triangle). This formula can be used if the height ''h'' is known.  If the lengths of the three sides are known then ''[[Heron's formula]]'' can be used: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}&lt;/math&gt;(where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are the sides of the triangle, and &lt;math&gt;s = \tfrac12(a + b + c)&lt;/math&gt; is half of its perimeter) If an angle and its two included sides are given, then area=absinC where C is the given angle and a and b are its included sides. If the triangle is graphed on a coordinate plane, a matrix can be used and is simplified to the ''absolute value of (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+ x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+ x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;- x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) all divided by 2''. This formula is also known as the [[shoelace formula]] and is an easy way to solve for the area of a coordinate triangle by substituting the 3 points, ''(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) (x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,y &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).'' The shoelace formula can also be used to find the areas of other polygons when their vertices are known. Another approach for a coordinate triangle is to use [[Infinitesimal calculus]] to find the area.
*a [[simple polygon]] constructed on a grid of equal-distanced points (i.e., points with [[integer]] coordinates) such that all the polygon's vertices are grid points: &lt;math&gt;i + \frac{b}{2} - 1&lt;/math&gt;, where ''i'' is the number of grid points inside the polygon and ''b'' is the number of boundary points. This result is known as [[Pick's theorem]].

===Area in calculus===
[[File:Areabetweentwographs.svg|thumb|287px|The area between two graphs can be evaluated by calculating the difference between the integrals of the two functions]]
*the area between the [[graph of a function|graph]]s of two functions is [[equality (mathematics)|equal]] to the [[integral]] of one [[function (mathematics)|function]], ''f''(''x''), [[subtraction|minus]] the integral of the other function, ''g''(''x'').
*an area bounded by a function ''r'' = ''r''(θ) expressed in [[polar coordinates]] is &lt;math&gt; {1 \over 2} \int_0^{2\pi} r^2 \, d\theta &lt;/math&gt;.
*the area enclosed by a [[parametric curve]] &lt;math&gt;\vec u(t) = (x(t), y(t)) &lt;/math&gt; with endpoints &lt;math&gt; \vec u(t_0) = \vec u(t_1) &lt;/math&gt; is given by the [[line integral]]s
::&lt;math&gt; \oint_{t_0}^{t_1} x \dot y \, dt  = - \oint_{t_0}^{t_1} y \dot x \, dt  =  {1 \over 2} \oint_{t_0}^{t_1} (x \dot y - y \dot x) \, dt &lt;/math&gt;
(see [[Green's theorem]])
:or the ''z''-component of

::&lt;math&gt;{1 \over 2} \oint_{t_0}^{t_1} \vec u \times \dot{\vec u} \, dt.&lt;/math&gt;

===Surface area of 3-dimensional figures===
*[[cube (geometry)|cube]]: &lt;math&gt;6s^2&lt;/math&gt;, where ''s'' is the length of the top side
*[[rectangular box]]: &lt;math&gt;2 (\ell w + \ell  h + w h)&lt;/math&gt; the length divided by height
*[[Cone (geometry)|cone]]: &lt;math&gt;\pi r\left(r + \sqrt{r^2 + h^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''r'' is the radius of the circular base, and ''h'' is the height. That can also be rewritten as &lt;math&gt;\pi r^2 + \pi r l &lt;/math&gt; where ''r'' is the radius and ''l'' is the slant height of the cone. &lt;math&gt;\pi r^2 &lt;/math&gt; is the base area while &lt;math&gt;\pi r l &lt;/math&gt; is the lateral surface area of the cone.
*[[Prism (geometry)|prism]]: 2 × Area of Base + Perimeter of Base × Height

====General formula====
The general formula for the surface area of the graph of a continuously differentiable function &lt;math&gt;z=f(x,y),&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in D\subset\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is a region in the xy-plane with the smooth boundary:
: &lt;math&gt; A=\iint_D\sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)^2+1}\,dx\,dy. &lt;/math&gt;
Even more general formula for the area of the graph of a [[parametric surface]] in the vector form &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r}(u,v),&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is a continuously differentiable vector function of &lt;math&gt;(u,v)\in D\subset\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt; A=\iint_D \left|\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial u}\times\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial v}\right|\,du\,dv. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;doCarmo&quot;/&gt;

==Minimization==
Given a wire contour, the surface of least area spanning (&quot;filling&quot;) it is a [[minimal surface]].  Familiar examples include [[soap bubble]]s.

The question of the [[filling area conjecture|filling area]] of the [[Riemannian circle]] remains open.

{{Unit of length|m=149597870700}}
An '''astronomical unit''' (abbreviated as '''AU''', '''au''', '''a.u.''', or '''ua.''') is a [[unit of measurement|unit]] of [[length]] equal to about 149,597,870.7&amp;nbsp;kilometers&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=IAU WG on NSFA Current Best Estimates|url=http://maia.usno.navy.mil/NSFA/CBE.html|accessdate = 25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (92,955,807.27&amp;nbsp;[[mile]]s) or approximately the mean [[Earth]]–[[Sun]] distance.

The symbol '''ua''' is recommended by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]],&lt;ref name=SIbrochure&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[international standard]] [[ISO 80000]], while '''au''' is recommended by the [[International Astronomical Union]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The IAU Style Manual (1989): The Preparation of Astronomical Papers and Reports|url=http://www.iau.org/static/publications/stylemanual1989.pdf|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is more common in [[Anglosphere]] countries. In general, capital letters are only used for the symbols of units which are named after individual scientists{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, while '''au''' or '''a.u.''' can also mean [[atomic unit]] or even [[arbitrary unit]]; however, the use of '''AU''' to refer to the astronomical unit is widespread.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the ''[[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]]'', the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'', and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[astronomical constant]] whose value is one astronomical unit is referred to as '''unit distance''' and given the symbol ''A''.

==Definition==
{{See also|Earth's orbit}}
The AU was originally defined as the length of the [[semi-major axis]] of the Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun. In 1976 the International Astronomical Union revised the definition of the AU for greater precision, defining it as that length for which the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]] (''k'') takes the value {{nowrap|0.017 202 098 95}} when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length, mass and time.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU76&quot;&gt;Resolution No. 10 of the [http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1976_French.pdf XVIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union], Grenoble, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Trümper&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title= Astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology.

It is approximately equal to the mean Earth–Sun distance.

==Modern determinations==
Precise measurements of the relative positions of the [[Solar System#Inner planets|inner planets]] can be made by [[radar]] and by [[telemetry]] from [[space probe]]s. As with all radar measurements, these rely on measuring the time taken for light to be reflected from an object. These measured positions are then compared with those calculated by the laws of [[celestial mechanics]]: the calculated positions are often referred to as an [[ephemeris]], and are usually calculated in astronomical units. The comparison gives the [[speed of light]] in astronomical units, which is {{nowrap|173.144 632 6847(69)}}&amp;nbsp;AU/d ([[Barycentric Dynamical Time|TDB]]).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecK/2009/Astronomical_Constants_2009.pdf 2009 Selected Astronomical Constants]&quot; in {{citation|title=The Astronomical Almanac Online|url=http://asa.usno.navy.mil/|publisher=[[United States Naval Observatory|USNO]]–[[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office|UKHO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the speed of light in metres per second (''c''&lt;sub&gt;SI&lt;/sub&gt;) is fixed in the [[International System of Units]], this measurement of the speed of light in AU/d (''c''&lt;sub&gt;AU&lt;/sub&gt;) also determines the value of the astronomical unit in metres (''A''):
:&lt;math&gt;A = 86\,400 \frac{c_{\rm SI}}{c_{\rm AU}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The best current (2009) estimate of the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) for the value of the astronomical unit in metres is ''A''&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|149 597 870 700(3)}}&amp;nbsp;m, based on a comparison of [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]] and [[Russian Academy of Sciences|IAA–RAS]] ephemerides.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitjeva09&quot;&gt;{{citation|last1=Pitjeva|first1=E.

==Usage==
By definition, the astronomical unit is dependent on the [[heliocentric gravitational constant]], that is the product of the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' and the solar mass ''M''&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt;. Neither ''G'' nor ''M''&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt; can be measured to high accuracy in SI units, but the value of their product is known very precisely from observing the relative positions of planets ([[Kepler's Third Law]] expressed in terms of Newtonian gravitation). Only the product is required to calculate planetary positions for an ephemeris, which explains why ephemerides are calculated in astronomical units and not in SI units.

The calculation of ephemerides also requires a consideration of the effects of [[general relativity]]. In particular, time intervals measured on the surface of the Earth ([[terrestrial time]], TT) are not constant when compared to the motions of the planets: the terrestrial second (TT) appears to be longer in Northern Hemisphere winter and shorter in Northern Hemisphere summer when compared to the &quot;planetary second&quot; (conventionally measured in [[barycentric dynamical time]], TDB). This is because the distance between the Earth and the Sun is not fixed (it varies between {{nowrap|0.983&amp;thinsp;289&amp;thinsp;8912}}&amp;nbsp;AU and {{nowrap|1.016&amp;thinsp;710&amp;thinsp;3335}}&amp;nbsp;AU) and, when the Earth is closer to the Sun ([[perihelion]]), the Sun's gravitational field is stronger and the Earth is moving faster along its [[Earth's orbit|orbital path]]. As the metre is defined in terms of the second, and the speed of light is constant for all observers, the terrestrial metre appears to change in length compared to the &quot;planetary metre&quot; on a periodic basis.

The metre is defined to be a unit of [[proper length]], but the SI definition does not specify the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] to be used in determining it. Indeed, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) notes that &quot;its definition applies only within a spatial extent sufficiently small that the effects of the non-uniformity of the gravitational field can be ignored.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|pages=166–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the metre is undefined for the purposes of measuring distances within the solar system. The 1976 definition of the astronomical unit is incomplete, in particular because it does not specify the [[frame of reference]] in which time is to be measured, but has proved practical for the calculation of ephemerides: a fuller definition that is consistent with general relativity has been proposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huang&quot;&gt;{{citation|author=Huang, T.-Y.; Han, C.-H.; Yi, Z.-H.; Xu, B.-X.|year=1995|title=What is the astronomical unit of length?|bibcode=1995A&amp;A...298..629H|journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics|Astron. Astrophys.]]|volume=298|pages=629–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to [[Archimedes]] in the ''[[Sand Reckoner]]'', [[Aristarchus of Samos]] estimated the distance to the Sun to be 10,000 times the earth's radius.&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, A. G. (2011) [http://www.jscimath.org/uploads/J2011157AG.pdf?CFID=3212927&amp;CFTOKEN=77052312&amp;jsessionid=84308eb496f88615f6613f41702e68121911 'Aristarchos of Samos the Polymath'], ''Journal of Scientific and Mathematical Research.''&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it has been historically assumed that [[Aristarchus of Samos]] estimated the distance to the Sun to be between 18 and 20 times the [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|distance to the moon]], whereas the true ratio is about 389. The latter estimate was based on the angle between the [[Lunar phase|half moon]] and the Sun, which he estimated as 87°.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Van Helden|first=Albert|title=Measuring the Universe: Cosmic Dimensions from Aristarchus to Halley|place=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1985|pages=5–9|isbn=0-226-84882-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The true value is roughly 89.85°.)

According to [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in the ''[[Preparation for the Gospel|Praeparatio Evangelica]]'', [[Eratosthenes]] found the distance to the sun to be &quot;σταδιων μυριαδας τετρακοσιας και οκτωκισμυριας&quot; (literally &quot;of ''stadia'' [[myriad]]s 400 and 80000&quot;). This has been translated either as 4,080,000 ''[[stadion (unit of length)|stadia]]'' (1903 translation by [[Edwin Hamilton Gifford]]), or as 804,000,000 ''stadia'' (edition of [[Édouard des Places]], dated 1974-1991). Using the Greek stadium of 185 to 190 metres,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Engels|first=Donald|year=1985|title=The Length of Eratosthenes' Stade|journal=Am. J. Philol.|volume=106|issue=3|pages=298–311|doi=10.2307/295030|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|jstor=295030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Edward|last=Gulbekian|year=1987|title=The origin and value of the stadion unit used by Eratosthenes in the third century B.C.|journal=Arch.

According to the conjectural reconstructions of [[Noel Swerdlow]] and [[G. J. Toomer]], this was derived from his assumption of a &quot;least perceptible&quot; solar parallax of 7 arc minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1007/BF00329826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[China|Chinese]] mathematical treatise, the ''[[Zhou Bi Suan Jing|Zhoubi suanjing]]'' (ca. 1st century BCE), shows how the distance to the sun can be computed geometrically, using the different lengths of the noontime shadows observed at three places 1000 [[Li (length)|li]] apart and the assumption that the Earth is flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=G.

In the 2nd century CE, [[Ptolemy]] estimated the mean distance of the sun as 1,210 times the [[Earth radius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Bernard R.|last=Goldstein|title=The Arabic Version of Ptolemy's ''Planetary Hypotheses''|journal=Trans. Am. Phil. Soc.|volume=57|issue=4|year=1967|pages=9–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=van Helden|first=Albert|title=Measuring the Universe: Cosmic Dimensions from Aristarchus to Halley|place=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1985|pages=15–27|isbn=0-226-84882-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To determine this value, Ptolemy started by measuring the Moon's parallax, finding what amounted to a horizontal lunar parallax of 1° 26′, which was much too large.  He then derived a maximum lunar distance of 64 1/6 Earth radii.  Because of cancelling errors in his parallax figure, his theory of the Moon's orbit, and other factors, this figure was approximately correct.&lt;ref name=vh1619&gt;pp. 16–19, van Helden 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 251, ''Ptolemy's Almagest'',
translated and annotated by G. J. Toomer, London: Duckworth, 1984, ISBN 0-7156-1588-2&lt;/ref&gt;  He then measured the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon and concluded that the apparent diameter of the Sun was equal to the apparent diameter of the Moon at the Moon's greatest distance, and from records of lunar eclipses, he estimated this apparent diameter, as well as the apparent diameter of the shadow cone of the Earth traversed by the Moon during a lunar eclipse.  Given these data, the distance of the Sun from the Earth can be trigonometrically computed to be 1,210 Earth radii.  This gives a ratio of solar to lunar distance of approximately 19, matching Aristarchus's figure.  Although Ptolemy's procedure is theoretically workable, it is very sensitive to small changes in the data, so much so that changing a measurement by a few percent can make the solar distance infinite.&lt;ref name=vh1619 /&gt;

After Greek astronomy was transmitted to the medieval Islamic world, astronomers made some changes to Ptolemy's cosmological model, but did not greatly change his estimate of the Earth-Sun distance.  For example, in his introduction to Ptolemaic astronomy, [[al-Farghānī]] gave a mean solar distance of 1,170 Earth radii, while in his ''[[zij]]'', [[al-Battānī]] used a mean solar distance of 1,108 Earth radii.  Subsequent astronomers, such as [[al-Bīrūnī]], used similar values.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 29–33, van Helden 1985&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in Europe, [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] and [[Tycho Brahe]] also used comparable figures (1,142 Earth radii and 1,150 Earth radii), and so Ptolemy's approximate Earth-Sun distance survived through the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 41–53, van Helden 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Kepler]] was the first to realize that Ptolemy's estimate must be significantly too low (according to Kepler, at least by a factor of three) in his ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'' (1627). [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] allowed astronomers to calculate the relative distances of the planets from the Sun, and rekindled interest in measuring the absolute value for the Earth (which could then be applied to the other planets). The invention of the [[telescope]] allowed far more accurate measurements of angles than is possible with the naked eye. Flemish astronomer [[Godefroy Wendelin]] repeated Aristarchus' measurements in 1635, and found that Ptolemy's value was too low by a factor of at least eleven.

A somewhat more accurate estimate can be obtained by observing the [[transit of Venus]]. By measuring the transit in two different locations, one can accurately calculate the [[parallax]] of Venus and from the relative distance of the Earth and Venus from the Sun, the [[solar parallax]] ''α'' (which cannot be measured directly&lt;ref name=&quot;Weaver&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Weaver|first=Harold F.|title=The Solar Parallax|bibcode=1943ASPL....4..144W|year=1943|journal=Astron. Soc. Pacific Leaflets|volume=4|pages=144–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Jeremiah Horrocks]] had attempted to produce an estimate based on his observation of the 1639 transit (published in 1662), giving a solar parallax of 15 [[arcsecond]]s, similar to Wendelin's figure. The solar parallax is related to the Earth–Sun distance as measured in [[Earth radius|Earth radii]] by
:&lt;math&gt;A = {1\over{\tan\alpha}}.&lt;/math&gt;
The smaller the solar parallax, the greater the distance between the Sun and the Earth: a solar parallax of 15&quot; is equivalent to an Earth–Sun distance of 13,750 Earth radii.

[[Christiaan Huygens]] believed the distance was even greater: by comparing the apparent sizes of Venus and [[Mars]], he estimated a value of about 24,000 Earth radii,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Goldstein|first=S. J., Jr.|title=Christiaan Huygens' Measurement of the Distance to the Sun|bibcode=1985Obs...105...32G|journal=Observatory|year=1985|volume=105|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; equivalent to a solar parallax of 8.6&quot;. Although Huygens' estimate is remarkably close to modern values, it is often discounted by historians of astronomy because of the many unproven (and incorrect) assumptions he had to make for his method to work; the accuracy of his value seems to based more on luck than good measurement, with his various errors cancelling each other out.

[[File:Venustransit 2004-06-08 07-44.jpg|thumb|right|Transits of Venus across the face of the Sun were, for a long time, the best method of measuring the astronomical unit, despite the difficulties (here, the so called &quot;[[black drop effect]]&quot;) and the rarity of observations.]]
[[Jean Richer]] and [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] measured the parallax of Mars between [[Paris]] and [[Cayenne]] in [[French Guiana]] when Mars was at its closest to Earth in 1672. They arrived at a figure for the solar parallax of 9½&quot;, equivalent to an Earth–Sun distance of about 22,000 Earth radii. They were also the first astronomers to have access to an accurate and reliable value for the radius of the Earth, which had been measured by their colleague [[Jean Picard]] in 1669 as 3,269 thousand ''[[toise]]s''. Another colleague, [[Ole Rømer]], discovered the finite [[speed of light]] in 1676: the speed was so great that it was usually quoted as the time required for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth, or &quot;light time per unit distance&quot;, a convention that is still followed by astronomers today.

A better method for observing Venus transits was devised by [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] and published in his ''[[Optica Promata]]'' (1663). It was strongly advocated by [[Edmond Halley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Halley|first=E.|authorlink=Edmond Halley|year=1716|title=A new Method of determining the Parallax of the Sun, or his Distance from the Earth|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc.

Transits of Venus occur in pairs, but less than one pair every century, and observing the transits in 1761 and 1769 was an unprecedented international scientific operation. Despite the [[Seven Years' War]], dozens of astronomers were dispatched to observing points around the world at great expense and personal danger: several of them died in the endeavour.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Pogge|first=Richard|title=How Far to the Sun?

Another method involved determining the constant of [[aberration of light|aberration]], and [[Simon Newcomb]] gave great weight to this method when deriving his widely accepted value of 8.80″ for the solar parallax (close to the modern value of 8.794143″), although Newcomb also used data from the transits of Venus. Newcomb also collaborated with [[Albert Abraham Michelson|A.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Michelson]] to measure the speed of light with Earth-based equipment; combined with the constant of aberration (which is related to the light time per unit distance) this gave the first direct measurement of the Earth–Sun distance in kilometres. Newcomb's value for the solar parallax (and for the constant of aberration and the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]) were incorporated into the first international system of [[astronomical constant]]s in 1896,&lt;ref&gt;Conférence internationale des étoiles fondamentales, Paris, 18–21 May 1896&lt;/ref&gt; which remained in place for the calculation of [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] until 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Resolution No. 4 of the [http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1964_French.pdf XIIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union], Hamburg, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;astronomical unit&quot; appears first to have been used in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astronomical%20unit astronomical unit] Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct radar measurements of the distances to Venus and Mars became available in the early 1960s. Along with improved measurements of the speed of light, these showed that Newcomb's values for the solar parallax and the constant of aberration were inconsistent with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Mikhailov|first=A. A.|year=1964|title=The Constant of Aberration and the Solar Parallax|bibcode=1964SvA.....7..737M|journal=Sov. Astron.|volume=7|issue=6|pages=737–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments==
[[Image:Stellarparallax parsec1.svg|thumb|right|The astronomical distance unit [[parsec]] uses the AU as a baseline and an angle of one [[arcsecond]] for [[parallax]]. 1 AU and 1 pc not to scale. (See also [[stellar parallax]])]]
The unit distance ''A'' (the value of the astronomical unit in metres) can be expressed in term of other [[astronomical constant]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;A^3 = \frac{D^2}{G M_\odot k^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''G'' is the [[Newtonian gravitational constant]], ''M''&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[solar mass]], ''k'' is the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]] and ''D'' is the time period of one day.
The Sun is constantly losing mass by radiating away energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Noedlinger, Peter D.|arxiv=0801.3807|title=Solar Mass Loss, the Astronomical Unit, and the Scale of the Solar System|journal=[[Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy|Celest. Mech. Dynam. Astron.]]|bibcode = 2008arXiv0801.3807N }}&lt;/ref&gt; so the orbits of the planets are steadily expanding outward from the Sun. This has led to calls to abandon the astronomical unit as a unit of measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn13286-astronomical-unit-may-need-to-be-redefined.html?feedId=online-news_rss20|title=AU may need to be redefined|newspaper=New Scientist|date=6 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have also been calls to redefine the astronomical unit in terms of a fixed number of metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Capitaine|first1=N|last2=Guinot|first2=B|eprint=0812.2970|title=The astronomical units|year=2008|version=v1|class=astro-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[speed of light]] has an exact defined value in SI units and the Gaussian gravitational constant ''k'' is fixed in the [[astronomical system of units]], measuring the light time per unit distance is exactly equivalent to measuring the product ''GM''&lt;sub&gt;☉&lt;/sub&gt; in SI units. Hence, it is possible to construct ephemerides entirely in SI units, which is increasingly becoming the norm.

A 2004 analysis of radiometric measurements in the inner Solar System suggested that the [[secular variation|secular increase]] in the unit distance was much larger than can be accounted for by solar radiation, +15±4&amp;nbsp;metres per century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Krasinsky, G. A.; Brumberg, V. A.|title=Secular increase of astronomical unit from analysis of the major planet motions, and its interpretation|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g5051650115444k9/|journal=Celest. Mech. Dynam.

Another explanation for the earth recession rate could be solar tidal friction.  The moon's recession rate is governed by similar tidal friction with the earth.  Takaho Miura of Hirosaki University in Japan suggests this possibility in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Why is the earth moving away from the sun?|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17228-why-is-the-earth-moving-away-from-the-sun.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later estimates based on both radiometric and angular observations lowered this estimate to +7±2&amp;nbsp;metres per century,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Standish, E.

Union|pages=163–79|doi=10.1017/S1743921305001365|volume=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is still far larger than can be accounted for by solar radiation and current theories of gravitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Lammerzahl|first1=C|last2=Preuss|first2=O|last3=Dittus|first3=H|eprint=gr-qc/0604052|title=Is the physics within the Solar System really understood?|year=2006|version=v1|class=gr-qc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possible variation in the gravitational constant based on radiometric measurements is of the order of parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; per century, or lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Pitjeva, E.

{{Refimprove|date=May 2008}}
An '''artist''' is a person engaged in one or more of any of a broad spectrum of activities related to creating [[art]], practicing the [[arts]] and/or demonstrating an art.  The common usage in both everyday [[speech]] and academic [[discourse]] is a practitioner in the [[visual art]]s only.  The term is often used in the [[entertainment]] business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for [[actor]]s).  &quot;Artiste&quot; (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context.  Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is certainly valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like [[criticism]].

==Dictionary definitions==
Wiktionary defines the noun 'artist' (Singular: artist; Plural: artists) as follows: 
# A person who creates art.
# A person who creates art as an [[wikt:occupation|occupation]].
# A person who is skilled at some activity.
The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines the older broad meanings of the term &quot;artist&quot;:

:* A learned person or Master of Arts
:* One who pursues a practical science, traditionally medicine, astrology, alchemy, chemistry
:* A follower of a pursuit in which skill comes by study or practice
:* A follower of a manual art, such as a mechanic
:* One who makes their [[craft]] a fine art
:* One who cultivates one of the [[fine arts]] – traditionally the arts presided over by the [[muses]]

A definition of Artist from Princeton.edu: creative person (a person whose creative work shows sensitivity and imagination).

==History of the term==
Although the Greek word &quot;techně&quot; is often mistranslated as &quot;art,&quot; it actually implies mastery of any sort of craft. The Latin-derived form of the word is &quot;tecnicus&quot;, from which the English words [[wikt:technique|technique]], [[technology]], [[wikt:technical|technical]] are derived.

In Greek culture each of the nine [[Muse]]s oversaw a different field of human creation:
* [[Calliope]] (the 'beautiful of speech'): chief of the muses and muse of [[epic poetry|epic or heroic poetry]]
* [[Clio]] (the 'glorious one'): muse of [[history]]
* [[Erato]] (the 'amorous one'): muse of [[love poetry|love or erotic poetry]], lyrics, and marriage songs
* [[Euterpe]] (the 'well-pleasing'): muse of music and [[lyric poetry]]
* [[Melpomene]] (the 'chanting one'): muse of [[tragedy]]
* [[Polyhymnia]] or Polymnia (the '[singer] of many [[hymn]]s'): muse of [[sacred|sacred song]], [[oratory]], [[Lyrics|lyric]], [[singing]] and [[rhetoric]]
* [[Terpsichore]] (the '[one who] delights in dance'): muse of [[choral]] song and dance
* [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] (the 'blossoming one'): muse of [[comedy]] and [[bucolic poetry]]
* [[Urania]] (the 'celestial one'): muse of [[astronomy]]

No muse was identified with the visual arts of painting and sculpture. In ancient Greece sculptors and painters were held in low regard, somewhere between freemen and slaves, their work regarded as mere manual labour.&lt;ref&gt;''In Our Time: The Artist'' [[BBC Radio 4]], TX 28th March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The word art is derived from the Latin &quot;ars&quot;, which, although literally defined means, &quot;[[skill]] method&quot; or &quot;technique&quot;, holds a connotation of [[beauty]].

During the Middle Ages the word ''artist'' already existed in some countries such as [[Italy]], but the meaning was something resembling ''craftsman'', while the word ''artesan'' was still unknown. An artist was someone able to do a work better than others, so the skilled excellency was underlined, rather than the activity field. In this period some &quot;artisanal&quot; products (such as textiles) were much more precious and expensive than paintings or sculptures.

The first division into major and minor arts dates back to [[Leon Battista Alberti]]'s works (''[[De re aedificatoria]], De statua, De pictura''), focusing the importance of intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills (even if in other forms of art there was a [[project]] behind).&lt;ref&gt;P.Galloni, ''Il sacro artefice. Mitologie degli artigiani medievali'', Laterza, [[Bari]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Academy|Academies]] in Europe (second half of 16th century) the gap between fine and applied arts was definitely set.

Many contemporary definitions of &quot;artist&quot; and &quot;art&quot; are highly contingent on [[culture]], resisting aesthetic prescription, in much the same way that the features constituting beauty and the beautiful, cannot be standardized easily without corruption into [[kitsch]].

== Modern theory of art ==
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

==The present day concept of an 'artist'==
''Artist'' is a descriptive term applied to a person who engages in an activity deemed to be an art. An artist also may be defined unofficially as &quot;a person who expresses him- or herself through a medium&quot;. The word is also used in a qualitative sense of, a person [[creativity|creative]] in, [[innovation|innovative]] in, or adept at, an artistic practice.

Most often, the term describes those who create within a context of the fine arts or '[[high culture]]', activities such as [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[acting]], [[dancing]], [[writing]], [[filmmaking]], [[photography]], and [[music]]—people who use imagination, talent, or skill to create works that may be judged to have an [[aesthetic]] value. [[Art history|Art historians]] and [[Art critic|critics]] define artists as those who produce art within a recognized or recognizable discipline.  Contrasting terms for highly-skilled workers in media in the [[applied arts]] or [[decorative arts]] include [[artisan]], [[Master craftsman|craftsman]], and specialized terms such as [[potter]], [[goldsmith]] or [[glassblower]].  Fine arts artists such as painters succeeded in the [[Renaissance]] in raising their status, formerly similar to these workers, to a decisively higher level, but in the 20th century the distinction became rather less relevant {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

The term may be also used loosely or metaphorically to denote highly skilled people in any non-&quot;art&quot; activities, as well— law, medicine, mechanics, or mathematics, for example.

Often, discussions on the subject focus on the differences among &quot;artist&quot; and &quot;[[technician]]&quot;, &quot;[[entertainer]]&quot; and &quot;[[artisan]]&quot;, &quot;[[fine arts|fine art]]&quot; and &quot;[[applied art]]&quot;, or what constitutes art and what does not. The [[French language|French]] word ''artiste'' (which in French, simply means &quot;artist&quot;) has been imported into the [[English language]] where it means a performer (frequently in [[Music Hall]] or [[Vaudeville]]). Use of the word &quot;artiste&quot; can also be a pejorative term.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth G. Wilson. [http://books.google.com/books?id=L2ChiO2yEZ0C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=artist++uncomplimentary+%22artiste%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=hxsr0c9Db2&amp;sig=e66MaUj3vzQQJmsA2N9zdp3GMFo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result The Columbia guide to standard American English].&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word 'artiste' has thus, a narrower range of meaning than the word 'artiste' in French.

Please resist the temptation to add your favorite artist or artform to this list. It is intended to illustrate the breadth of the concept, not to list every possible artform and movement. It should contain only the most significant directions and mention one artist who may be considered iconic in this domain. For all practical purposes it appears to be complete.

[[Image:Actaeon Caserta.jpg|thumb|300px|Actaeon, sculpture group in the cascade at [[Caserta Palace|Caserta]]]] 
'''Actaeon''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|æ|k|ˈ|t|iː|ən}}; Greek: {{polytonic|Άκταίων}}), in [[Greek mythology]], son of the priestly herdsman [[Aristaeus]] and [[Autonoe]] in [[Boeotia]], was a famous [[Thebes, Greece|Theban]] [[Greek hero cult|hero]].&lt;ref&gt;Through his mother he was a member of the ruling House of [[Cadmus]].&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Achilles]] in a later generation, he was trained by the centaur [[Chiron]].

He fell to the fatal wrath of [[Artemis]],&lt;ref&gt;Later his myth was attached to her Roman counterpart [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].&lt;/ref&gt; but the surviving details of his transgression vary: &quot;the only certainty is in what Aktaion suffered, his [[Pathos|πάθος]], and what Artemis did: the hunter became the hunted; he was transformed into a [[stag]], and his raging hounds, struck with a 'wolf's frenzy' ([[Lyssa|λύσσα]]), tore him apart as they would a stag.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''Homo Necans'' (1972), translated by Peter Bing (University of California Press) 1983, p 111.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the iconic motif by which Actaeon is recognized, both in ancient art and in Renaissance and post-Renaissance depictions.

==The plot==
Among others, John Heath has observed, &quot;The unalterable [[mytheme|kernel of the tale]] was a hunter's transformation into a deer and his death in the jaws of his hunting dogs. But authors were free to suggest different motives for his death.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heath, &quot;The Failure of Orpheus&quot;, ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' '''124''' (1994:163-196) p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;   In the version that was offered by the [[Hellenistic]] poet [[Callimachus]],&lt;ref&gt;Callimachus, ''Hymn v''.&lt;/ref&gt; which has become the standard setting, Artemis was bathing in the woods&lt;ref&gt;Callimachus gives no site: a glen in the foothills of [[Mount Kithaeron]] near Boeotian [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]], is the site according to [[Euripides]], ''[[Bacchae]]'' 1290-92, a spring sanctuary near [[Plataea]] is specified elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt; when the hunter Actaeon stumbled across her, thus seeing her naked. He stopped and stared, amazed at her ravishing beauty. Once seen, Artemis punished Actaeon: she forbade him speech — if he tried to speak, he would be changed into a [[Deer (mythology)|stag]] — for the unlucky profanation of her virginity's mystery. Upon hearing the call of his hunting party, he cried out to them and immediately was changed into a stag. His own hounds then turned upon him and tore him to pieces, not recognizing him. An element of the earlier myth made Actaeon the familiar hunting companion of Artemis, no stranger. In an embroidered extension of the myth, the hounds were so upset with their master's death, that [[Chiron]] made a statue so lifelike that the hounds thought it was Actaeon.&lt;ref&gt;Fragmentary sources for the narrative of Actaeon's hounds are noted in Lamar Ronald Lacy, &quot;Aktaion and a Lost 'Bath of Artemis'&quot; ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''110''' (1990:26–42) p. 30 note 32, p. 31 note 37.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Tizian 001.jpg|thumb|left|''Actaeon Surprising Diana (Artemis) in the bath'', [[Titian]], 1556-59, for [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] ([[National Gallery of Scotland]]).]]
There are various other versions of his transgression: ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheke]]'' states that his offense was that he was a rival of [[Zeus]] for [[Semele]], his mother's sister,&lt;ref&gt;Thus potentially endangering the future birth of [[Dionysus]], had he been successful. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] referred (9.2.3) to a lost poem by [[Stesichoros]] also expressing this motif. The progressive destruction of the House of Cadmus to make way for the advent of Dionysus can be followed in the myths of its individual members: Actaeon, [[Semele]], [[Ino]] and [[Melicertes]], and [[Pentheus]].&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in [[Euripides]]' ''Bacchae'' he has boasted that he is a better hunter than Artemis:&lt;ref&gt;This [[mytheme]] would link him with [[Agamemnon]] and [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]] (Lacy 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Further materials, including fragments that belong with the Hesiodic ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'' and at least four Attic tragedies, including a ''Toxotides''  of [[Aeschylus]], have been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Lacy 1990, emphasizing that the central core is lost, covers the literary fragments, pp 26-27 and copious notes.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus Siculus]] (4.81.4), in a variant of Actaeon's ''[[hubris]]'' that has been largely ignored, has it that Actaeon wanted to marry Artemis. Other authors say the hounds were Artemis' own; some lost elaborations of the myth seem to have given them all names and narrated their wanderings after his loss. 

[[Image:LeBaindeDianeClouet.jpg|thumb|right|In [[François Clouet]]'s ''Bath of Diana'' (1558-59) Actaeon's passing on horseback at left and mauling as a stag at right is incidental to the three female nudes.]]

According to the Latin version of the story told by the Roman [[Ovid]]&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' iii.131; see also pseudo-Apollodorus' ''Bibliotheke'' iii. 4&lt;/ref&gt; having accidentally seen Diana (Artemis) on [[Mount Cithaeron]] while she was bathing, he was changed by her into a stag, and pursued and killed by his fifty hounds.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} This version also appears in Callimachus' Fifth Hymn, as a mythical parallel to the blinding of [[Tiresias]] after he sees Athena bathing.
&lt;!--a confusion with Aristaeus, apparently:His statue was often set up on rocks and mountains as a protection against excessive heat. The myth itself probably represents the destruction of vegetation during the fifty [[Dog Days]].--&gt;
The literary testimony of Actaeon's myth is largely lost, but Lamar Ronald Lacy,&lt;ref&gt;Lacy,  &quot;Aktaion and a Lost 'Bath of Artemis'&quot; ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''110''' (1990:26-42).&lt;/ref&gt; deconstructing the [[Mytheme|myth elements]] in what survives and supplementing it by iconographic evidence in late vase-painting, made a plausible reconstruction of an ancient Actaeon myth that Greek poets may have inherited and subjected to expansion and dismemberment. His reconstruction opposes a too-pat consensus that has an archaic Actaeon aspiring to [[Semele]],&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias (ix.2.3) reports that &quot;[[Stesichorus of Himera]] says that the goddess cast a deer-skin round Actaeon to make sure that his hounds would kill him, so as to prevent his taking Semele to wife&quot;; the lines of Stesichorus have not survived.&lt;/ref&gt; a classical Actaeon boasting of his hunting prowess and a Hellenistic Actaeon glimpsing Artemis' bath.&lt;ref&gt;Lacy 1990:27f.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacy identifies the site of Actaeon's transgression as a spring sacred to Artemis at [[Plataea]] where Actaeon was a '' [[Greek hero cult|hero archegetes]]'' (&quot;hero-founder&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Aristeides''11.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The righteous hunter, the companion of Artemis, seeing her bathing naked at the spring, was moved to try to make himself her consort, as [[Diodorus Siculus]] noted, and was punished, in part for transgressing the hunter's &quot;ritually enforced deference to Artemis&quot; (Lacy 1990:42).

==Names of the dogs who devoured Actaeon==

;According to Hyginus
Dogs: Melampus, Ichnobates, [Echnobas], Pamphagos, Dorceus, Oribasus, Nebrophonus, Laelap, Theron, Pterelas, Hylaeus, Nape, Ladon, Poemenis, [Therodanapis], Aura, Lacon, Harpyia, Aello, Dromas, Thous Canache, Cyprius, Sticcte, Labros, Arcas, Agriodus, Tigris, Hylactor, Alce, Harpalus, Lycisca, Melaneus, Lachne, Leucon.&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus fabulae 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Bitches: Melanchaetes, Agre, theridamas, Oreistrophos.&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus fabulae 181&lt;/ref&gt;

;Authors other than Hyginus
Dogs: Acamas, Syrus, Leon, Stilbon, Agrius, Charops, Aethon, Corus, Boreas, Draco, Eudromus, Dromius, Zephyrus, Lampus, Haemon, Cyllopodes, Harpalicus, Machimus, Ichneus, Melampus, Ocydromus, Borax, Ocythous, Pachylus, Obrimus;&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus fabulae 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Bitches: Argo, Arethusa, Urania, Theriope, Dinomache, Dioxippe, Echione, Gorgo, Cyllo, Harpyia, Lynceste, Leaena, Lacaena, Ocyptete, Ocydrome, Oxyrhoe, Orias, *Sagnos, Theriphone, *Volatos, *Chediaetros.&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus fabulae 181&lt;/ref&gt;

==The &quot;bed of Actaeon&quot;==
In the second century CE, the traveller [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was shown a spring on the road in [[Attica]] leading to [[Plataea]] from [[Eleutherae]], just beyond [[Megara]] &quot;and a little farther on a rock. It is called the bed of Actaeon, for it is said that he slept thereon when weary with hunting, and that into this spring he looked while Artemis was bathing in it.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias ix.2.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Actaeon.jpg|thumb|left|''Actaeon'' by [[Titian]]]]

==Parallels in Akkadian and Ugarit poems==
In the standard version of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] (tablet vi) there is a parallel, in the series of examples [[Gilgamesh]] gives [[Ishtar]] of her mistreatment of her serial lovers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;You loved the herdsman, shepherd and chief shepherd&lt;br&gt;
Who was always heaping up the glowing ashes for you,&lt;br&gt;
And cooked ewe-lambs for you every day.&lt;br&gt;
But you hit him and turned him into a wolf,&lt;br&gt;
His own herd-boys hunt him down&lt;br&gt;
And his dogs tear at his haunches.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Gilgamesh VI&quot; in ''Myths from Mesopotamia... a new translation by Stephanie Dalley'', rev. ed.2000:79; note 60, p. 129: &quot;This metamorphosis has been compare to the Greek myth of Actaeon.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Actaeon, torn apart by dogs incited by Artemis, finds another Near Eastern parallel in the [[Ugarit]]ic hero [[Aqht]], torn apart by eagles incited by [[Anath]] who wanted his hunting bow.&lt;ref&gt;The comparison is made in Michael C. Astour, ''Hellenosemitica: an ethnic and cultural study of West Semitic  impact on Mycenaean Greece'' (Leiden:Brill, 1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

The virginal Artemis of classical times is not directly comparable to Ishtar of the many lovers, but the [[mytheme]] of Artemis shooting [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]], was linked to her punishment of Actaeon by T.C.W. Stinton;&lt;ref&gt;Stinton &quot;Euripides and the Judgement of Paris&quot; (London, 1965:45 note 14) reprinted in Stinton, ''Collected Papers on Greek Tragedy (London, 1990:51 note 14).&lt;/ref&gt; the Greek context of the mortal's reproach to the amorous goddess is translated to the episode of [[Anchises]] and [[Aphrodite]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daphnis]] too was a herdsman loved by a goddess and punished by her: see [[Theocritus]]' First Idyll.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Griffin, &quot;Theocritus, the Iliad, and the East&quot;, ''The American Journal of Philology'' '''113'''.2 (Summer 1992:189-211) esp. pp 205f.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anglicanism}}
'''Anglicanism''' is a tradition within [[Christianity]] comprising churches with historical connections to the [[Church of England]] or similar beliefs, worship and church structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;cofe&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/faith/anglican/ | title=What it means to be an Anglican | publisher=Church of England | accessdate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Anglican'' originates in ''ecclesia anglicana'', a medieval Latin phrase dating to at least 1246 meaning ''the English Church''. Adherents of Anglicanism are called ''Anglicans''. The great majority of Anglicans are members of churches which are part of the international [[Anglican Communion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;acomm&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.anglicancommunion.org/ | title=The Anglican Communion official website – homepage | accessdate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, a number of churches outside of the Anglican Communion which also consider themselves to be in the Anglican tradition, most notably those referred to as [[Continuing Anglican]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usachurches.org/denomination/continuing-anglican.htm. Retrieved 9 November 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The faith of Anglicans is founded in the scriptures, the traditions of the apostolic church, the [[apostolic succession]] – &quot;historic episcopate&quot; and the early Church Fathers.&lt;ref name=&quot;cofe&quot; /&gt; Anglicanism forms one of the branches of [[Western Christianity]]; having definitively declared its independence from the [[Pope|Roman pontiff]] at the time of the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]], in what has been otherwise termed the British monachism.&lt;ref name=&quot;CtS&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Green |first=Jonathon |authorlink=Jonathon Green |title=Chasing the Sun: Dictionary Makers and the Dictionaries They Made|year=1996 |edition=1st USA |publisher=[[Henry Holt (publisher)|Henry Holt]] |location=New York, USA |isbn=0-8050-3466-8 |pages=58–59 |chapter=Chapter 2: The Middle Ages}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BMTDF&quot;&gt;[[Thomas Dudley Fosbroke]] (1802), &quot;British Monachism,&quot; 2 Volumes.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid 16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary [[Reformed]] [[Protestantism]]; but by the end of the century, the retention in Anglicanism of many traditional liturgical forms and of the episcopate was already seen as unacceptable by those promoting the most developed Protestant principles. In the first half of the 17th century the Church of England and associated episcopal churches in Ireland and in England's American colonies were presented by some Anglican divines as comprising a distinct Christian tradition, with theologies, structures and forms of worship representing a middle ground, or ''via media'', between Reformed Protestantism and Roman Catholicism; a perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of Anglican identity, and expressed in the description &quot;Catholic and Reformed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The History of the Church of England&quot;; http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/history , Official Church of England website&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[American Revolution]], Anglican congregations in the United States and [[Canada]] were each reconstituted into an independent church with their own bishops and self-governing structures; which, through the expansion of the [[British Empire]] and the activity of [[Christian missions]], was adopted as the model for many newly formed churches, especially in [[Africa]], [[Australasia]] and the regions of the [[Pacific]]. In the 19th century the term ''Anglicanism'' was coined to describe the common religious tradition of these churches; as also that of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], which, though originating earlier within the [[Church of Scotland]], had come to be recognised as sharing this common identity.

The degree of distinction between Reformed and western Catholic tendencies within the Anglican tradition is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the ''[[Anglican Communion]]''. Unique to ''Anglicanism'' is the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', the collection of services that worshippers in most Anglican churches used for centuries. While it has since undergone many revisions and Anglican churches in different countries have developed other service books, the ''Prayer Book'' is still acknowledged as one of the ties that bind the ''Anglican Communion'' together. There is no single ''Anglican Church'' with universal juridical authority, since each national or regional church has full autonomy. As the name suggests, the ''Anglican Communion'' is an association of those churches in [[full communion]] with the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC&quot;&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church by F. L. Cross (Editor), E. A. Livingstone (Editor) Oxford University Press, USA; 3 edition p.65 (13 March 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; With over eighty&lt;ref name=&quot;acomm&quot; /&gt; million members the Anglican Communion is the third largest Christian communion in the world, after the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

==Terminology==
{{details|Christian Church|the universal Church of which Anglicanism is a part}}

The word ''Anglicanism'' is a [[neologism]] from the 19th century; constructed from the older word ''Anglican''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC&quot; /&gt; The word refers to the teachings and rites of Christians throughout the world in communion with the [[Episcopal see|see]] of [[Diocese of Canterbury|Canterbury]]. It has come to be used to refer to the claim of those Churches to a unique religious and theological tradition apart from all other Christian churches, be they Orthodox, Roman Catholic, or [[Protestantism|Protestant]]; and is entirely distinct from the allegiance of some of these churches to the [[British Crown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC&quot; /&gt;

The word ''Anglican'' originates in {{lang|la|''ecclesia anglicana''}}, a [[Medieval Latin]] phrase dating to at least 1246 meaning &quot;the [[England|English]] Church&quot;.&lt;ref name=cat&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Anglicanism}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an adjective, ''Anglican'' is used to describe the people, institutions, and churches as well as the liturgical traditions and theological concepts developed by the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC&quot; /&gt; As a noun, an ''Anglican'' is a member of a Church in the [[Anglican Communion]]. The word is also used by followers of dissenting groups which have left the communion or have been founded separately from it, though the Anglican Communion considers this to be misuse.&lt;ref name=gro&gt;[http://www.anglicanjournal.com/sexuality-debate/055/article/group-drops-name ''Anglican Journal'' article &quot;Group drops name&quot;(1&amp;nbsp;May 2006)]{{dead link|date=December 2010}} Retrieved 23 January 2007 {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term ''Anglican'' is found referring to the Church of England as far back as the 16th century, its use did not become general until the latter half of the 19th century. In British parliamentary legislation referring to the English [[Established Church]], it is described as the ''Protestant Episcopal Church'', thereby distinguishing it from the counterpart established ''[[Church of Scotland|Protestant Presbyterian Church]]'' in Scotland. [[High Church]]men, who objected to the term ''Protestant'', initially promoted the form ''Reformed Episcopal Church''; and it remains the case that word ''[[Episcopal (disambiguation)|Episcopal]]'' is preferred in the title of [[Episcopal Church (United States)|The Episcopal Church]] (the province of the Anglican Communion covering the United States) and the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]]. Outside of the British Isles, however, the term ''Anglican Church'' came to be preferred; as it distinguished these churches from others that claimed an [[episcopal polity]]; although some churches, in particular the Scottish Episcopal Church, the [[Church of Ireland]] and the [[Church in Wales]] continue to use the term only with reservations.

===Definition===
{{Christianity|expand-catholic=yes}}
Anglicanism, in its structures, theology, and forms of worship, is commonly understood as a distinct Christian tradition representing a middle ground between what are perceived to be the extremes of the claims of 16th century Roman Catholicism and the [[Calvinism]] of that era and its contemporary offshoots, and as such, is often referred to as being a ''via media'' (or ''middle way'') between these traditions. The faith of Anglicans is founded in the [[Scriptures]] and the [[Gospels]], the traditions of the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostolic]] Church, the [[historical episcopate]], the [[first seven ecumenical councils]], and the early [[Church Fathers]]. Anglicans understand the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s as &quot;containing all things necessary for salvation&quot; and as being the rule and ultimate standard of faith. Anglicans understand the [[Apostles' Creed]] as the baptismal symbol, and the [[Nicene Creed]] as the sufficient [[statement of faith|statement of the Christian faith]].

[[File:Rochester cathedral stained glass 2.jpg||thumb|left|Jesus depicted in a stained glass window in [[Rochester Cathedral]], Kent.]]

Anglicans believe the catholic and apostolic faith is revealed in Holy Scripture and the catholic creeds, and interpret these in light of the Christian tradition of the historic Church, scholarship, reason, and experience.

Anglicans celebrate the traditional sacraments, with special emphasis being given to the [[Holy Eucharist]], also called Holy Communion, the Lord's Supper or the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. The Eucharist is central to worship for most Anglicans as a communal offering of prayer and praise in which the life, death and resurrection of [[Jesus Christ]] are proclaimed through prayer, reading of the Bible, singing, and the offering of the bread and wine, giving God thanks over them for the innumerable benefits obtained through the passion of Christ, the breaking of the bread, and reception of the body and blood of Christ as instituted at the [[Last Supper]]. While many Anglicans celebrate the Eucharist in similar ways to the predominant western Catholic tradition, a considerable degree of liturgical freedom is permitted, and worship styles range from the simple to elaborate. 

Unique to Anglicanism is the [[Book of Common Prayer]] (BCP), the collection of services that worshippers in most Anglican churches used for centuries. It was called ''common prayer'' originally because it was intended for use in all Church of England churches which had previously followed differing local liturgies. The term was kept when the church became international because all Anglicans used to share in its use around the world. In 1549, the first Book of Common Prayer was compiled by [[Thomas Cranmer]], who was then [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Whilst it has since undergone many revisions and Anglican churches in different countries have developed other service books, the Prayer Book is still acknowledged as one of the ties that bind the Anglican Communion together.

==Anglican identity==
===Development===
{{See also|History of the Anglican Communion}}

By the [[Elizabethan Settlement]], the Churches of England and Ireland had been established through legislation in their respective [[British Parliament|Parliaments]]; and assumed allegiance and loyalty to the British Crown in all their members. However, from the first, the Elizabethan Church began to develop distinct religious traditions; assimilating some of the theology of [[Reformed churches]] with the services in the [[Book of Common Prayer]], under the leadership and organisation of a continuing episcopate;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Edwards |first=David L. |title=Christian England (Volume 2): From the Reformation to the 18th Century |year=1983 |publisher=Collins |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over the years these traditions themselves came to command adherence and loyalty. Potentially this would create a crisis of identity, were secular and religious loyalties to conflict – and such a crisis indeed occurred in 1776 with the [[American Declaration of Independence]], most of whose signatories were, at least nominally, Anglican.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Edwards |first=David L. |title=Christian England (Volume 3): From the 18th Century to the First World War |year=1984 |publisher=Collins |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these American Patriots, even the forms of Anglican services were in doubt, since the Prayer Book rites of [[Matins]], [[Evensong]] and Holy Communion, all included specific prayers for the British Royal Family. Consequently, the conclusion of the [[American Revolutionary War|War of Independence]] resulted in the creation of two new Anglican churches, [[The Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] in those States that had achieved independence; and [[Anglican Church of Canada|The Church of England in Canada]] in those North American colonies remaining under British control and to which many Loyalist churchmen had migrated. Reluctantly, legislation was passed in the British Parliament (the Consecration of Bishops Abroad Act 1786) to allow bishops to be consecrated for an American church outside of allegiance to the British Crown (whereas no bishoprics had ever been established in the former American colonies).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Edwards |first=David L. |title=Christian England (Volume 3): From the 18th Century to the First World War |year=1984 |publisher=Collins |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both in the United States and in Canada, the new Anglican churches developed novel models of self-government, collective decision-making, and self-supported financing; that would be consistent with separation of religious and secular identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Edwards |first=David L .|title=Christian England (Volume 3): From the 18th Century to the First World War |year=1984 |publisher=Collins |page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following century, two further factors acted to accelerate the development of a distinct Anglican identity. From 1828 and 1829, [[Dissenters]] and Roman Catholics could be elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Edwards |first=David L. |title=Christian England (Volume 3): From the 18th Century to the First World War |year=1984 |publisher=Collins |pages=113, 124}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consequently ceased to be a body drawn purely from the established churches of Scotland, England and Ireland; but which nevertheless, over the following ten years, engaged in extensive reforming legislation affecting the interests of the established United Church of England and Ireland. The propriety of this legislation was bitterly contested by the [[Oxford Movement]] (Tractarians),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Edwards |first=David L. |title=Christian England (Volume 3): From the 18th Century to the First World War |year=1984 |publisher=Collins |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in response developed a vision of Anglicanism as religious tradition deriving ultimately from the [[Ecumenical Councils]] of the patristic church. Those within the Church of England opposed to the Tractarians, and to their revived ritual practices, introduced a stream of Parliamentary Bills aimed to control innovations in worship;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chadwick |first=Owen |title=The Victorian Church, Part Two 1860–1901 |publisher=Black |page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this only made the dilemma more acute, with consequent continual litigation in the secular and ecclesiastical courts.

Over the same period Anglican churches engaged vigorously in [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missions]], resulting in the creation, by the end of the century, of over ninety colonial bishoprics;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Edwards |first=David L. |title=Christian England (Volume 3): From the 18th Century to the First World War |year=1984 |publisher=Collins |page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gradually coalesced into new self-governing churches on the Canadian and American models. However, the case of [[John William Colenso]] [[Bishop of Natal]], reinstated in 1865 by the English [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] over the heads of the Church in South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Edwards |first=David L. |title=Christian England (Volume 3): From the 18th Century to the First World War |year=1984 |publisher=Collins |page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated acutely that the extension of episcopacy had to be accompanied by a recognised Anglican ecclesiology of ecclesiastical authority, distinct from secular power.

Consequently, at the instigation of the bishops of Canada and South Africa, the first [[Lambeth Conference]] was called in 1867;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Edwards |first=David L. |title=Christian England (Volume 3): From the 18th Century to the First World War |year=1984 |publisher=Collins |page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be followed by further conferences in 1878 and 1888, and thereafter at ten year intervals. The various papers and declarations of successive Lambeth Conferences, have served to frame the continued Anglican debate on identity, especially as relating to the possibility of ecumenical discussion with other churches. This ecumenical aspiration became much more of a possibility, as other denominational groups rapidly followed the example of the Anglican Communion in founding their own transnational alliances: the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches|Alliance of Reformed Churches]], the [[World Methodist Council|Ecumenical Methodist Council]], the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches|International Congregational Council]], and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].

===Theories===
In their rejection of absolute parliamentary authority, the [[Oxford Movement|Tractarians]] – and in particular [[John Henry Newman]] – looked back to the writings of 17th century Anglican divines, finding in these texts the idea of the English church as a ''via media'' between the Protestant and Catholic traditions.&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris |first=Jeremy N. |year=2003 |month=Fall |title=Newman and Maurice on the Via Media of the Anglican Church: Contrasts and Affinities |journal=Anglican Theological Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was associated – especially in the writings of [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]] – with the theory of Anglicanism as one of three &quot;[[Branch Theory|branches]]&quot; (alongside the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches) historically arising out of the common tradition of the earliest [[Ecumenical Councils]]. Newman himself subsequently rejected the theory of the ''via media'', as essentially historicist and static; and hence unable to accommodate any dynamic development within the church.&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt; Nevertheless, the aspiration to ground Anglican identity in the writings of the 17th century divines, and in faithfulness to the traditions of the [[Church Fathers]] reflects a continuing theme of Anglican ecclesiology, most recently in the writings of [[Henry Robert McAdoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=McAdoo |first=Henry Robert |authorlink=Henry Robert McAdoo |title=Anglican Heritage: Theology and Spirituality |publisher=Canterbury Press |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tractarian formulation of the theory of the ''via media'' was essentially a party platform, and not acceptable to Anglicans outside the confines of the [[Oxford Movement]]. However, the theory of the ''via media'' was reworked in the ecclesiological writings of [[Frederick Denison Maurice]], in a more dynamic form that became widely influential. Both Maurice and Newman saw the Church of England of their day as sorely deficient in faith; but whereas Newman had looked back to a distant past when the light of faith might have appeared to burn brighter, Maurice looked forward to the possibility of a brighter revelation of faith in the future. Maurice saw the Protestant and Catholic strands within the Church of England as contrary but complementary, both maintaining elements of the true church, but incomplete without the other; such that a true catholic and evangelical church might come into being by a union of opposites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sykes |first=Stephen. W. |authorlink=Stephen Sykes |title=The Integrity of Anglicanism |publisher=Mowbray |year=1978 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to Maurice's perspective, is his belief that the collective elements of family, nation and church represent a divine order of structures through which God unfolds his continuing work of creation. Hence, for Maurice, the Protestant tradition has maintained the elements of national distinction which are amongst the marks of the true universal church, but which have been lost within Roman Catholicism in the internationalism of centralised Papal Authority. Within the coming universal church that Maurice foresaw, national churches would each maintain the six signs of Catholicity: baptism, Eucharist, the creeds, Scripture, an episcopally ordered ministry, and a fixed liturgy (which could take a variety of forms in accordance with divinely ordained distinctions in national characteristics).&lt;ref name=Morris /&gt; Not surprisingly, this vision of a becoming universal church as a congregation of autonomous national churches, proved highly congenial in Anglican circles; and Maurice's six signs were adapted to form the [[Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral]] of 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Woodhouse-Hawkins |first=M. |editor=Wright, J. Robert |title=Quadrilateral at One Hundred |year=1988 |publisher=Mowbray |location=London |chapter=Maurice, Huntington, and the Quadrilateral: an Exploration in Historical Theology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter decades of the 20th century, Maurice's theory, and the various strands of Anglican thought that derived from it, have been criticised by [[Stephen Sykes]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sykes |first=Stephen. W. |authorlink=Stephen Sykes |title=The Integrity of Anglicanism |publisher=Mowbray |year=1978 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; who argues that the terms ''Protestant'' and ''Catholic'' as used in these approaches are synthetic constructs denoting ecclesiastic identities unacceptable to those to whom the labels are applied. Hence, the Roman Catholic Church does not regard itself as a party or strand within the universal church – but rather identifies itself as the universal church. Moreover, Sykes criticises the proposition, implicit in theories of ''via media'', that there is no distinctive body of Anglican doctrine, other than those of the universal church; accusing this of being an excuse not to undertake systematic doctrine at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sykes |first=Stephen. W. |authorlink=Stephen Sykes |title=The Integrity of Anglicanism |publisher=Mowbray |year=1978 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrariwise, Sykes notes a high degree of commonality in Anglican liturgical forms, and in the doctrinal understandings expressed within those liturgies. He proposes that Anglican identity might rather be found within a shared consistent pattern of prescriptive liturgies, established and maintained through canon law, and embodying both a historic deposit of formal statements of doctrine, and also framing the regular reading and proclamation of scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sykes |first=Stephen. W. |authorlink=Stephen Sykes |title=The Integrity of Anglicanism |publisher=Mowbray |year=1978|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sykes nevertheless agrees with those heirs of Maurice who emphasise the incompleteness of Anglicanism as a positive feature, and quotes with qualified approval the words of [[Michael Ramsay]]:

{{quote|For while the Anglican church is vindicated by its place in history, with a strikingly balanced witness to Gospel and Church and sound learning, its greater vindication lies in its pointing through its own history to something of which it is a fragment. Its credentials are its incompleteness, with the tension and the travail of its soul. It is clumsy and untidy, it baffles neatness and logic. For it is not sent to commend itself as ‘the best type of Christianity,’ but by its very brokenness to point to the universal Church wherein all have died.|&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ramsay |first=Micheal |authorlink=Michael Ramsay |title=The Gospel and the Catholic Church |publisher=Longmans |year=1936 |page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Doctrine==
{{Main|Anglican doctrine}}

===Catholic and Reformed===
In the time of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] the nature of Anglicanism was based on questions of jurisdiction – specifically, the belief of the Crown that [[national church]]es should be autonomous – rather than theological disagreement. The effort was to create a national church in legal continuity with its traditions, but inclusive of certain doctrinal and liturgical beliefs of the [[Protestant Reformers|Reformers]]. The result has been a movement with a distinctive self-image among Christian movements. The question often arises as to whether the Anglican Communion should be identified as a [[Protestant]] or [[Catholic]] church, or perhaps as a distinct branch of Christianity altogether.

The distinction between Reformed and Catholic, and the coherence of the two, is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican Churches and throughout the Anglican Communion by members themselves. Since the [[Oxford Movement]] of the mid-19th century, many Churches of the Communion have revived and extended liturgical and pastoral practices similar to Roman Catholic theology. This extends beyond the ceremony of [[High Church]] services to even more theologically significant territory, such as sacramental theology (see [[Anglican sacraments]]). While [[Anglo-Catholic]] practices, particularly liturgical ones, have resurfaced and become more common within the tradition over the last century, there remain many places where practices and beliefs remain on the more Reformed or Evangelical side (see [[Sydney Anglicanism]]).

===Guiding principles===
[[File:Hooker-Statue.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]] (1554–1600), one of the most influential figures in shaping Anglican theology and self-identity.]]

For 'High Church' Anglicans, doctrine is neither established by a [[magisterium]], nor derived from the theology of an [[eponymous]] founder (such as [[Calvinism]]), nor summed up in a confession of faith beyond the ecumenical [[creeds]] (such as the [[Lutheran]] [[Book of Concord]]). For them, the earliest Anglican theological documents are its prayer books, which they see as the products of profound theological reflection, compromise, and synthesis. They emphasise the [[Book of Common Prayer]] as a key expression of Anglican doctrine. The principle of looking to the prayer books as a guide to the parameters of belief and practice is called by the Latin name ''[[lex orandi, lex credendi]]'' (&quot;the law of prayer is the law of belief&quot;). Within the prayer books are the fundamentals of Anglican doctrine: The [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles']] and [[Nicene Creed]]s, the [[Athanasian Creed]] (rarely recited today), the scriptures (via the lectionary), the sacraments, daily prayer, the [[catechism]], and apostolic succession in the context of the historic threefold ministry. For some 'Low Church' Anglicans, the 16th-century [[Reformed]] Thirty-Nine Articles form the basis of doctrine.

'''Specific Anglican Beliefs'''

The [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] initially played a significant role in Anglican doctrine and practice. Following the passing of the 1604 Canons, all Anglican clergy had to formally subscribe to the Articles. Today, however, the articles are no longer binding, but are seen as a historical document that has played a significant role in the shaping of Anglican identity. The degree to which each of the Articles has remained influential varies. On the doctrine of [[Justification (theology)|justification]], for example, there is a wide range of beliefs within the [[Anglican Communion]], with some [[Anglo-Catholics]] arguing for a faith with good works and the Sacraments. At the same time, however, some [[Evangelical]] Anglicans ascribe to the [[Reformed]] emphasis on [[Sola fide]] in their doctrine of justification (see [[Sydney Anglicanism]].) Still, other Anglicans adopt a nuanced view of justification, taking elements from the early [[Church Fathers]], [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]] and [[latitudinarian]] thought. Arguably, the most influential of the original Articles has been Article VI on the ''sufficiency of Scripture,'' which states that ''Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation.'' This article has informed Anglican biblical [[exegesis]] and [[hermeneutics]] since earliest times.

Anglicans look for authority in their &quot;standard divines&quot; (see below). Historically, the most influential of these – apart from Cranmer – has been the 16th century cleric and theologian [[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]] who after 1660 was increasingly portrayed as the founding father of Anglicanism. Hooker's description of Anglican authority as being derived primarily from Scripture, informed by reason (the intellect and the experience of God) and tradition (the practices and beliefs of the historical church), has influenced Anglican self-identity and doctrinal reflection perhaps more powerfully than any other formula. The analogy of the &quot;three-legged stool&quot; of [[Bible|scripture]], [[reason]], and [[Sacred Tradition|tradition]] is often incorrectly attributed to Hooker. Rather Hooker's description is a hierarchy of authority, with scripture as foundational, and reason and tradition as vitally important, but secondary, authorities.

Finally, the extension of Anglicanism into non-English cultures, the growing diversity of prayer books, and the increasing interest in ecumenical dialogue, has led to further reflection on the parameters of the Anglican identity. Many Anglicans look to the [[Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral]] of 1888 as the &quot;''sine qua non''&quot; of Communal identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;lec&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sydnor |first=William |title=Looking at the Episcopal Church |publisher=Morehouse Publishing |year=1980 |location=USA |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; In brief, the Quadrilateral's four points are the Holy Scriptures, as containing all things necessary to salvation; the Creeds (specifically, the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds), as the sufficient statement of Christian faith; the dominical sacraments of [[Baptism]] and [[Holy Communion]]; and the historic [[episcopalian church governance|episcopate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lec&quot; /&gt;

===Anglican divines===
{{See also|John Donne|George Herbert|William Laud}} [[File:William Laud.jpg|left|thumb|[[William Laud]]]]
Within the Anglican tradition, divines are theological writers whose works have been considered standards for faith, doctrine, worship, and spirituality. While there is no authoritative list of these Anglican divines, there are some whose names would likely be found on most lists – those who are commemorated in [[Calendar of saints (Anglican)|lesser feasts]] of the Church, and those whose works are frequently [[anthology|anthologised]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Booty |first=John |chapter=Standard Divines |title=The Study of Anglicanism |page=163 ff. |isbn=080063151X |year=1998 |publisher=SPCK/Fortress Press |location=[London] |oclc=46883122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The corpus produced by Anglican divines is diverse. What they have in common is a commitment to the faith as conveyed by Scripture and the Book of Common Prayer, thus regarding prayer and theology in a manner akin to that of the [[Apostolic Fathers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Booty |first=John |chapter=Standard Divines |title=The Study of Anglicanism |page=163 |isbn=080063151X |year=1998 |publisher=SPCK/Fortress Press |location=[London] |oclc=46883122}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the whole, Anglican divines view the [[via media]] of Anglicanism, not as a compromise, but &quot;a positive position, witnessing to the universality of God and God's kingdom working through the fallible, earthly ''ecclesia Anglicana''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Booty |first=John |chapter=Standard Divines |title=The Study of Anglicanism |page=164 |isbn=080063151X |year=1998 |publisher=SPCK/Fortress Press |location=[London] |oclc=46883122}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theologians regard Scripture as interpreted through tradition and reason as authoritative in matters concerning salvation. Reason and tradition, indeed, is extant in and presupposed by Scripture, thus implying co-operation between God and humanity, God and nature, and between the sacred and secular. Faith is thus regarded as [[incarnation]]al, and authority as dispersed.

Among the early Anglican divines of the 16th and 17th centuries, the names of Thomas Cranmer, [[John Jewel]], Richard Hooker, [[Lancelot Andrewes]], and [[Jeremy Taylor]] predominate. The influential character of Hooker's ''[[Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity]]'' cannot be overestimated. Published in 1593 and subsequently, Hooker's eight volume work is primarily a treatise on Church-state relations, but it deals comprehensively with issues of [[biblical interpretation]], [[soteriology]], [[ethics]], and [[sanctification]]. Throughout the work, Hooker makes clear that theology involves prayer and is concerned with ultimate issues, and that theology is relevant to the social mission of the church.

[[File:Christ Church Cathedral Oxford interior 20070801 Copyright Kaihsu Tai.jpg|right|thumb|Inside [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford]]]]
The 18th century saw the rise of two important movements in Anglicanism: [[Cambridge Platonists|Cambridge Platonism]], with its mystical understanding of reason as the &quot;candle of the Lord,&quot; and the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Revivalism|Revival]], with its emphasis on the personal experience of the [[Holy Spirit]]. The Cambridge Platonist movement evolved into a school called [[Latitudinarianism]], which emphasised reason as the barometer of discernment and took a stance of indifference towards doctrinal and ecclesiological differences. The Evangelical Revival, influenced by such figures as [[John Wesley]] and [[Charles Simeon]], re-emphasised the importance of [[Sola fide|justification through faith]] and the consequent importance of personal conversion. Some in this movement, such as Wesley and [[George Whitefield]], took the message to the [[United States]], influencing the [[First Great Awakening]], and created an Anglo-American movement called [[Methodism]] that would eventually break away, structurally, from the Anglican churches after the American Revolution.

By the 19th century, there was a renewed emphasis on the teachings of the earlier Anglican divines: Theologians such as [[John Keble]], [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]], and [[John Henry Newman]] had widespread influence in the realm of polemics, homiletics, and theological and devotional works, not least because they largely repudiated the Old High Church tradition and replaced it with a dynamic appeal to antiquity which looked beyond the Reformers and Anglican formularies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nockles |first=P.&amp;nbsp;B. |title=The Oxford Movement in Context – Anglican High Churchmanship, 1760–1857 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1994 |pages=7–8, 113, 125, 127 |isbn=0521381622 |oclc=185319963 224404167 28183241 59808939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work is largely credited with the development of the [[Oxford Movement]], which sought to reassert Catholic identity and practice in the Anglican Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bio/249.html Accessed 9 November 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; Through such works as ''[[The Kingdom of Christ]]'', [[Frederick Denison Maurice]] played a pivotal role in inaugurating another movement, [[Christian socialism]]. In this, Maurice transformed Hooker's emphasis on the [[incarnation]]al nature of Anglican spirituality to an imperative for social justice. In the 19th century, Anglican biblical scholarship began to assume a distinct character, represented by the so-called &quot;Cambridge triumvirate&quot; of [[Joseph Lightfoot]], [[Fenton John Anthony Hort|F. J. A. Hort]], and [[Brooke Foss Westcott]]. Their orientation is best summed up by Lightfoot's observation that &quot;Life which Christ is and which Christ communicates, the life which fills our whole beings as we realise its capacities, is active fellowship with God.&quot;

The 20th century is marked by figures such as [[Charles Gore]], with his emphasis on natural revelation, [[William Temple (archbishop)|William Temple]]'s focus on Christianity and society, [[John A.T. Robinson|J.A.T. Robinson]]'s provocative discussions of deism and theism, Darwell Stone's and [[E. L. Mascall]]'s Thomism and defence of Catholic orthodoxy, and [[Kenneth E. Kirk|Kenneth Kirk]]'s Moral Theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=A. |last=Nichols |title=The Panther and the Hind – A Theological History of Anglicanism |publisher=Clark |year=1993 |pages=dedication page and p. 128 |isbn=0567292320|oclc=27933866 60104275 65896424 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside England, one sees such figures as [[William Porcher DuBose]], [[William Meade]], and [[Charles Henry Brent]] in the United States. More recently, theologians such as [
