==Applications==
===Radionuclides===
[[File:Curium self-glow radiation.jpg|thumb|right|The radiation from curium is so strong that the metal glows purple in the dark]]
Curium is one of the most radioactive isolable elements. Its two most common isotopes &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm are strong alpha emitters (energy 6 MeV); they have relatively short half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, and produce as much as 120 W/g and 3 W/g of thermal energy, respectively.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Binder&quot;&gt;Binder, Harry H.: ''Lexikon der chemischen Elemente'', S. Hirzel Verlag, Stuttgart 1999, ISBN 3-7776-0736-3, pp.&amp;nbsp;174–178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry'', System No. 71, Volume 7a, transuranics, Part A2, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, curium can be used in its common oxide form in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s like those in spacecraft. This application has been studied for the &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm isotope, while &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm was abandoned due to its prohibitive price of around 2000 USD/g. Curium-243 with a ~30 year half-life and good energy yield of ~1.6 W/g could make for a suitable fuel, but it produces significant amounts of harmful [[Gamma ray|gamma]] and [[Beta ray|beta]] radiation from radioactive decay products. Though as an α-emitter, &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm requires a much thinner radiation protection shielding, it has a high spontaneous fission rate, and thus the neutron and gamma radiation rate are relatively strong. As compared to a competing thermoelectric generator isotope such as &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu, &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm emits a 500 time greater fluence of neutrons, and its higher gamma emission requires a shield that is 20 times thicker — about 2&amp;nbsp;inches of lead for a 1&amp;nbsp;kW source, as compared to 0.1 in for &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu. Therefore this application of curium is currently considered impractical.&lt;ref name=lect&gt;[http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/neep602/SPRING00/lecture5.pdf Basic elements of static RTGs], G.L. Kulcinski, NEEP 602 Course Notes (Spring 2000), Nuclear Power in Space, University of Wisconsin Fusion Technology Institute (see last page)&lt;/ref&gt;

A more promising application of &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm is to produce &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu, a more suitable radioisotope for thermoelectric generators such as in cardiac pacemakers. The alternative routes to &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu use the (n,γ) reaction of &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np, or the [[deuteron]] bombardment of uranium, which both always produce &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;Pu as an undesired by-product — since the latter decays to &lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Tl with strong gamma emission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kronenberg.kernchemie.de/ Kronenberg, Andreas], [http://www.kernenergie-wissen.de/pu-batterien.html Plutonium-Batterien] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Curium is also a common starting material for the production of higher [[transuranic elements]] and [[transactinides]]. Thus, bombardment of &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm with oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O) or magnesium (&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg) yielded certain isotopes of [[seaborgium]] (&lt;sup&gt;265&lt;/sup&gt;Sg) and [[hassium]] (&lt;sup&gt;269&lt;/sup&gt;Hs and &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Hs).&lt;ref name=&quot;HOWI_1980&quot;&gt;Holleman, pp. 1980–1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Californium was discovered when a microgram-sized target of curium-242 was irradiated with 35&amp;nbsp;MeV [[alpha particle]]s using the 60-inch cyclotron at Berkeley:

[[File:MER APXS PIA05113.jpg|thumb|Alpha-particle X-ray spectrometer of a Mars exploration rover]]

===X-ray spectrometer===
The most practical application of &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm — though rather limited in total volume — is as α-particle source in the [[alpha particle X-ray spectrometer]]s (APXS). These instruments were installed on the [[Mars Pathfinder|Sojourner]], [[Mars rover|Mars]], [[Mars 96]], [[Spirit rover|Spirit]], [[Mars Exploration Rover|Athena]] and [[Opportunity rover]]s to analyze the composition and structure of the rocks on the surface of planet [[Mars (planet)|Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1996DPS....28.0221R|title=An Alpha Proton X-Ray Spectrometer for Mars-96 and Mars Pathfinder|author=Rieder, R.; Wanke, H.; Economou, T.|journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society|volume=28|page=1062|date=09/1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; APXS was also used in the [[Surveyor Program|Surveyor 5–7]] moon probes but with a &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm source.&lt;ref name=LA2&gt;[http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/curium.pdf Human Health Fact Sheet on Curium], Los Alamos National Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leitenberger, Bernd [http://www.bernd-leitenberger.de/surveyor.shtml Die Surveyor Raumsonden] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-480/ch9.htm SP-480 |author=Nicks, Oran |

An elaborated APXS setup is equipped with a sensor head containing six curium sources having the total radioactive decay rate of several tens of [[curie|millicuries]]. The sources are collimated on the sample, and the energy spectra of the alpha particles and protons scattered from the sample are analyzed (the proton analysis is implemented only in some spectrometers). These spectra contain quantitative information on all major elements in the samples except for hydrogen, helium and lithium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://athena.cornell.edu/pdf/tb_apxs.pdf Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS)], Cornell University&lt;/ref&gt; An APXS will also be used by the [[Philae lander]] of the [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]] spacecraft to probe the surface of the [[67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko]] [[comet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bernd-leitenberger.de/philae.shtml |title=Der Rosetta Lander Philae |publisher=Bernd-leitenberger.de |date=2003-07-01 |accessdate=2011-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Owing to its high radioactivity, curium and its compounds must be handled in appropriate laboratories under special arrangements. Whereas curium itself mostly emits α-particles which are absorbed by thin layers of common materials, some of its decay products emit significant fractions of beta and gamma radiation, which require a more elaborate protection.&lt;ref Name=&quot;lenntech&quot;/&gt; If consumed, curium is excreted within a few days and only 0.05% is absorbed in the blood. From there, about 45% goes to the [[liver]], 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. In the bone, curium accumulates on the inside of the interfaces to the [[bone marrow]] and does not significantly redistribute with time; its radiation destroys [[bone marrow]] and thus stops [[red blood cell]] creation. The [[biological half-life]] of curium is about 20 years in the liver and 50 years in the bones.&lt;ref Name=&quot;lenntech&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=LA2/&gt; Curium is absorbed in the body much more strongly via inhalation, and the allowed total dose of &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm in soluble form is 0.3 μ[[Curie (unit)|C]].&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Intravenous injection of &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm containing solutions to rats increased the incidence of [[bone tumor]], and inhalation promoted [[Lung|pulmonary]] and [[liver cancer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lenntech&quot;/&gt;

Curium isotopes are inevitably present in spent nuclear fuel with a concentration of about 20 g/tonne.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, K. ''Kann man Gold machen? Gauner, Gaukler und Gelehrte. Aus der Geschichte der chemischen Elemente'' (Can you make gold? Crooks, clowns and scholars. From the history of the chemical elements), Urania-Verlag, Leipzig, Jena, Berlin 1979, no ISBN, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, the &lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Cm–&lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm isotopes have decay times of thousands of years and need to be removed to neutralize the fuel for disposal.&lt;ref&gt;Baetslé, L.

This procedure, [[nuclear transmutation]], while well documented for other elements, is still being developed for curium.&lt;ref name=&quot;denecke&quot;/&gt;

{{infobox californium}}
'''Californium''' is a synthetic [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] metallic [[chemical element]] in the [[actinide]] series with the symbol '''Cf''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;98. The element was first produced in 1950 by bombarding [[curium]] with [[alpha particle]]s ([[helium]] [[ion]]s) at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. It was the sixth [[transuranium element]] to be synthesized and is one of the highest atomic mass elements to be produced in amounts large enough to see with the unaided eye. The element was named for [[California]] and the [[University of California]].

The element has two crystalline forms under normal pressure, one above 900&amp;nbsp;°C and one below; a third form exists at high pressure. Californium slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature. It disrupts the body's ability to form [[red blood cell]]s by [[Bioaccumulation|bio-accumulating]] in skeletal tissue. The most stable of californium's twenty [[isotope]]s is californium-251, which has a [[half-life]] of 898&amp;nbsp;years. Californium-252, whose half-life is 2.645&amp;nbsp;years, is the most common isotope used and is produced at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in the U.S. state of Tennessee and the [[Research Institute of Atomic Reactors]] in Russia.

Californium is one of the few transuranium elements that have practical applications. Most of these applications exploit the property of certain [[isotopes of californium]] to emit [[neutron]]s. For example, californium can be used to help start up [[nuclear reactor]]s, and is employed as a source of neutrons when studying materials with [[neutron diffraction]] and [[neutron spectroscopy]]. [[Ununoctium]] (element 118) was synthesized by bombarding californium-249 atoms with [[calcium-48]] [[ion]]s.

==Characteristics==
===Physical properties===
Unlike many other elements heavier than [[plutonium]], enough californium can be collected to determine some of its properties. Californium is a silvery white [[actinide]] metal{{sfn|Jakubke|1994|p=166}} with an estimated [[melting point]] of 900&amp;nbsp;±30&amp;nbsp;°C and an estimated [[boiling point]] of 1475&amp;nbsp;°C.{{sfn|Haire|2006|pp=1522, 1523}} The pure metal is malleable and is easily cut by a razor blade.

To produce californium, a microgram-sized target of [[curium]]-242 ({{Nuclide|curium|242}}) was bombarded with 35&amp;nbsp;MeV-[[alpha particle]]s ({{Nuclide|helium|4}}) in the {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[cyclotron]] at [[Berkeley, California]], which produced californium-245 ({{Nuclide|californium|245}}), which has a half-life of 44&amp;nbsp;minutes, plus one [[free neutron]] ({{SubatomicParticle|neutron}}).{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=103}}

Only about 5,000 atoms of californium were produced in this experiment.{{sfn|Seaborg|1996|p=82}}

The discoverers named the new element for California and the [[University of California]]; this was a break from the convention used for elements 95 to 97, which drew inspiration from how the elements directly above them in the periodic table were named.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=849}} {{#tag:ref|[[Europium]], in the sixth period directly above element 95, was named for the continent it was discovered on, so element 95 was named [[americium]].

==Production==
{{see also|Nuclear fuel cycle}}
Californium is produced in [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[particle accelerator]]s.{{sfn|Krebs|2006|pp=327–328}} Californium-250 is made by bombarding [[berkelium]]-249 ({{nuclide|Bk|249}}) with neutrons, forming berkelium-250 ({{nuclide|Bk|250}}) via [[neutron capture]] (n,γ)  which, in turn, quickly [[beta decay]]s (β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) to californium-250 ({{nuclide|Cf|250}}) in the following reaction:{{sfn|Heiserman|1992|p=348}} 
:{{nuclide|Bk|249}}(n,γ){{nuclide|Bk|250}} → {{nuclide|Cf|250}} + β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
Bombardment of californium-250 with neutrons produces californium-251 and californium-252.{{sfn|Heiserman|1992|p=348}} 

Prolonged irradiation of [[americium]], [[curium]], and [[plutonium]] with neutrons produces milligram amounts of californium-252 and microgram amounts of californium-249.{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=105}} As of 2006, curium isotopes 244 to 248 are irradiated by neutrons in special reactors to produce primarily californium-252 with lesser amounts of isotopes 249 to 255.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1503}} 

Microgram quantities of californium-252 are available for commercial use through the U.S. [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]].{{sfn|Krebs|2006|pp=327–328}} Only two sites produce californium-252; [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] near [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], in the United States and the [[Research Institute of Atomic Reactors]] in [[Dimitrovgrad, Russia]]. As of 2003, the two sites produce 0.25&amp;nbsp;grams and 0.025&amp;nbsp;grams of californium-252 per year, respectively.{{sfn|NRC|2008|p=33}}

Three californium isotopes with significant half-lives are produced, requiring a total of 14 neutron captures by [[uranium-238]] without [[nuclear fission]] or [[alpha decay]] occurring during the process.{{sfn|NRC|2008|p=33}} Californium-253 is at the end of a [[decay chain]] that starts with uranium-238, includes several [[isotopes of plutonium]], [[isotopes of americium|americium]], [[isotopes of curium|curium]], and [[isotopes of berkelium|berkelium]] and the californium isotopes 249 to 253 (see diagram).

Californium-251 has a very small [[critical mass (nuclear)|critical mass]] (about 5&amp;nbsp;kg),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire]]|title = Evaluation of nuclear criticality safety data and limits for actinides in transport|page = 16|url = http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/transport/doc/irsn_sect03_146.pdf|format = PDF|accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; high lethality, and a relatively short period of toxic environmental irradiation. The low critical mass of californium led to some exaggerated claims about possible uses for the element. In an article entitled &quot;Facts and Fallacies of World War III&quot; in the July, 1961 edition of ''[[Popular Science]]'' magazine, the claim was made that &quot;A californium atomic bomb need be no bigger than a pistol bullet. You could build a hand-held six-shooter to fire bullets that would explode on contact with the force of 10 tons of TNT.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Popular Science]]|page=180|date=July 1961|volume=179|issue=1|issn=0161-7370|title=Facts and Fallacies of World War III}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, researchers announced that three atoms of [[ununoctium]] (element 118) had been identified at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] in Dubna, Russia, as the product of bombardment of californium-249 with [[calcium]]-48, making it the heaviest element ever synthesized.

==Precautions==
Californium disrupts the body's ability to form [[red blood cell]]s by [[Bioaccumulation|bio-accumulating]] in skeletal tissue.{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=106}} The element plays no natural biological role in any organism due to its intense radioactivity and low concentration in the environment.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=90}} 

Californium can enter the body from ingesting contaminated food or drinks or by breathing air with suspended particles of the element. Once in the body, only 0.05% of the californium will reach the bloodstream. About 65% of that californium will be deposited in the skeleton, 25% in the liver, and the rest in other organs, or excreted, mainly in urine. Half of the californium deposited in the skeleton and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years, respectively. Californium in the skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone.&lt;ref name=ANL2005/&gt;

The element is most dangerous if taken into the body. In addition, californium-249 and californium-251 can cause tissue damage externally, through [[gamma ray]] emission.&lt;ref name=ANL2005/&gt; [[Ionizing radiation]] emitted by californium on bone and in the liver can cause cancer. An incidence of two to six fatal cancers are expected to occur for every 100,000 people continuously exposed to soil with an initial average concentration of 1&amp;nbsp;[[Picocurie|pCi]]/g of californium-251 and californium-249, respectively.&lt;ref name=ANL2005/&gt; For comparison, radiation levels in soil of 0.2&amp;nbsp;pCi/g are considered low while levels at or above 4.2&amp;nbsp;pCi/g are regarded as high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/rpdweb00/tenorm/sources.html#summary-table|title=TENORM Sources|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|year=2011|accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Christian Social Union in Bavaria''' ({{Audio|De-CSU.ogg|'''CSU''' &amp;ndash; ''Christlich-Soziale Union in Bayern''}}) is a [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] and [[conservatism|conservative]] [[political party]] in [[Germany]]. It operates only in the state of [[Bavaria]], while its sister party, the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU), operates in the other 15 [[Länder|states of Germany]]. It has 45 seats in the [[Bundestag]], making it the smallest of the six parties represented.

It was founded as a continuation of the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]]-era Catholic [[Bavarian People's Party]]. At the federal level, it forms a common '[[CDU/CSU]]' faction in the Bundestag with the CDU, which is frequently referred to as the Union faction (''die Unionsfraktion''). The CSU currently governs at the federal level with the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]. In the state of Bavaria, the CSU governs in a coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]].

The CSU is a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) and its [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] sit in the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|EPP Group]]. At the moment they have three ministers in Berlin, while party leader [[Horst Seehofer]] serves as [[Minister-President of Bavaria]]: a position that CSU representatives have held since 1957.

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F049272-0002, München, CSU-Bundestagswahlkampf, Strauß.jpg|thumb|Chairman Franz Josef Strauss in 1976]]
[[Franz Josef Strauss]] (1915&amp;ndash;1988) had left behind the strongest legacy as a leader of the party, having led the party from 1961 until his death in 1988. His political career in the federal cabinet was unique in that he had served four ministerial posts in the years between 1953 and 1969. From 1978 until his death in 1988 he served as the minister-president of Bavaria. He was the first leader of the CSU to be a candidate for the German chancellery, in 1980. In the [[German federal election, 1980|1980 elections]] he ran against the incumbent [[Helmut Schmidt]] of the [[SPD]], but lost thereafter, as the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] managed to secure an absolute majority in a [[social-liberal coalition]].

The CSU has led the Bavarian state government since it came into existence in 1946, save from 1950 to 1953 when the [[Bavaria Party]] formed a state government in coalition with the German Branches of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]. The CSU currently governs with the FDP. Before the 2008 elections in Bavaria, the CSU perennially achieved absolute majorities at the state level. This level of dominance is unique among Germany's 16 states. [[Edmund Stoiber]] took over the CSU leadership in 1999. He ran for [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Federal Chancellor]] in 2002, but his preferred [[CDU/CSU]] and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] coalition lost against the SPD candidate [[Gerhard Schröder]]s [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Red]]-[[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green]] coalition. In 2003, the CSU was [[Bavaria state election, 2003|re-elected]] as the Bavarian government with a majority (60.7% and 124 of 180 seats in the state parliament). On January 18, 2007, Stoiber announced his decision to step down from the posts of minister-president and CSU chairman by September 30 of that year.

On September 28, 2008, the CSU failed to gain an absolute majority, attaining 43%, of the vote in the [[Bavaria state election, 2008|Bavaria state election]] for the first time since 1966 on a percentage basis and was forced into a coalition with the FDP. Even after the [[German federal election, 2009|2009 general election]], the CDU/CSU emerged as the largest party in Germany, yet both lost votes predominantly to the FDP. The CSU received only 42.5% of the vote in Bavaria in the 2009 election, which constitutes its weakest showing in the party's history. They have three ministers in Berlin: [[Hans-Peter Friedrich]] ([[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]]), Peter Ramsauer (Federal Minister of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs) and [[Ilse Aigner]] (Minister of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection).

==Relationship with the CDU==
The CSU is the sister party of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]].  Together, they are called 'The Union'.  The CSU operates only within Bavaria, and the CDU operates in all other states, but not Bavaria.  While virtually independent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Political Europe |last1=The Economist |first1= |year=1983 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=9780521277938 |page=16 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dIeR88JDzSgC |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the federal level, the parties form a common [[CDU/CSU]] fraction.  No [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] has ever come from the CSU, although [[Franz Josef Strauss]] was the CDU/CSU candidate for Chancellor in [[West German federal election, 1980|1980 election]], which was won by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]].  Below the federal level, the parties are entirely independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Germany: A Country Study |last1=Solsten |first1=Eric |year=1999 |publisher=DANE Publishing |location=Quezon |isbn=9780521277938 |page=375 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dIeR88JDzSgC |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its formation, the CSU has been more conservative than the CDU.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robertson 296&quot; /&gt;

Publicly and privately held for-profit [[corporation]]s confer '''corporate titles''' or '''business titles''' on company officials as a means of identifying their function in the organization. In addition, many [[non-profit]] organizations, educational institutions, [[partnership]]s, and [[sole proprietorship]]s also confer corporate titles.

The highest level executives are usually called &quot;C-level&quot; or part of the &quot;C-suite&quot;, referring to the 3-letter initials starting with &quot;C&quot; and ending with &quot;O&quot; (for &quot;Chief __________ Officer&quot;); the major traditional such offices are Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Operations Officer (COO), and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). [[Chief administrative officer]] and [[Chief risk officer]] positions are often found in banking, insurance, and other financial services companies. Technology companies (including telecom and semi-conductor) tend to have a Chief Technology Officer (CTO), while companies with a strong Information Technology (IT) presence have a Chief Information Officer (CIO). Most other C-level titles are not universally recognized as Corporate Officers, and tend to be specific to particular organizational cultures or preferences as employees.

==Variations==
Note that there are considerable variations in the responsibilities of the titles.

Within the corporate office or corporate center of a company, some companies have a Chairman and CEO as the top ranking executive, while the number two is the President and COO; other companies have a President and CEO but no official deputy. Typically C-level managers are &quot;higher&quot; than Vice Presidents, although many times a C-level officer may also hold a vice president title as well, such as Executive Vice President and CFO. The board of directors is technically not part of management itself, although its chairman may be considered part of the corporate office if he or she is an executive chairman.

A corporation often consists of different businesses, whose senior executives report directly to the CEO or COO. If organized as a [[Division (business)|division]] then the top manager is often known as an Executive Vice President (for example, Todd Bradley who heads the Personal Systems Group in [[Hewlett Packard]]). If that business is a [[subsidiary]] which has considerably more independence then the title might be known as Chairman and CEO (for example, [[Philip I. Kent]] of [[Turner Broadcasting System]] in [[Time Warner]]).

In some [[European Union]] and [[Asia|Asian]] countries, there are two separate boards, one [[Board of directors|executive board]] for the day-to-day business and one [[supervisory board]] for control purposes (elected by the shareholders). In these countries, the CEO presides over the executive board and the chairman presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people. This ensures a distinction between [[management]] by the executive board and [[governance]] by the supervisory board. This allows for clear lines of authority. The aim is to prevent a conflict of interest and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person. There is a strong parallel here with the structure of government, which tends to separate the political [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] from the management [[civil service]]. In the United States, the board of directors (elected by the shareholders) is often equivalent to the supervisory board, while the executive board may often be known as the executive committee or executive council, comprising of the division/subsidiary heads and C-level officers that report directly to the CEO.

==Corporate titles==
*[[Chairman|Chairman of the Board]] &amp;ndash; presiding officer of the corporate [[board of directors]]. The Chairman influences the board of directors, which in turn elects and removes the officers of a corporation and oversees the human, financial, environmental and technical operations of a corporation. The CEO may be combined with that of [[chairman]] to form the position of executive chairman. However the chairman's post may also exist as an office separate from that of CEO, and it may be considered an executive chairman if that titleholder wields influence over company operations, such as [[Steve Case]] of [[AOL Time Warner]] and [[Stephen Green, Baron Green of Hurstpierpoint|Stephen Green]] of HSBC Group PLC. In particular, the Chairmanship of HSBC is considered the top position of that institution, outranking the Chief Executive, and is responsible for leading the board and representing the company in meetings with government figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8019235/HSBC-investors-against-Michael-Geoghegan-becoming-chairman.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/business/hsbc-chief-michael-geoghegan-to-quit-after-failing-to-get-top-job/story-e6frfm1i-1225928665163]&lt;/ref&gt; A non-executive chairman, by contrast does not interfere in day-to-day company matters. Across the world, many companies have separated the roles of Chairman and CEO, often resulting in a non-executive chairman, saying that this move improves corporate governance.
* [[Chief accounting officer]]
* [[Chief administrative officer]]
* [[Chief analytics officer|Chief Analytics Officer]] or CAO &amp;ndash; high level corporate manager with overall responsibility for the analysis and interpretation of data relevant to a company's activities; generally reports to the ''CEO'', or ''COO''.
* [[Chief Audit Executive]] or CAE &amp;ndash; high level 'independent' corporate executive with overall responsibility for the [[Internal audit]].
* [[Chief Business Officer]] or CBO
* [[Chief Business Development Officer]] or CBDO.
* [[Chief Brand Officer]] or CBO &amp;ndash; a relatively new executive level position at a corporation, company, organization, or agency, typically reporting directly to the [[CEO]] or [[board of directors]]. The CBO is responsible for a [[brand]]'s image, experience, and promise, and propagating it throughout all aspects of the company. The brand officer oversees [[marketing]], [[advertising]], [[design]], [[public relations]] and [[customer service]] departments. The [[brand equity]] of a company is seen as becoming increasingly dependent on the role of a CBO.
* [[Chief commercial officer]] or CCO &amp;ndash; the executive responsible for commercial strategy and development
* [[Chief Communications Officer]] or CCO.
* [[Chief Compliance Officer]] &amp;ndash; in charge of regulatory compliance, especially [[Sarbanes-Oxley]].
* [[Chief Content Officer]] or CCO &amp;ndash; the executive responsible for developing and commissioning [[content (media)]] for [[broadcasting]] channels and [[multimedia]] exploitation.
* [[Chief Creative Officer]]
* [[Credit risk|Chief Credit Officer]] or CCO.
* [[Chief Customer Officer]] &amp;ndash; responsible in customer-centric companies for the total relationship with an organization’s customers.
* [[Chief Data Officer]] or CDO
* [[Chief Debriefing Officer]] or CDO &amp;ndash; responsible for getting the status, and maintaining forward motion in production.
* [[Chief Design Officer]] or CDO
* [[Chief Electrification Officer]] &amp;ndash; responsible for electrical generating and distribution systems. The title was used mainly in [[Developed country|developed countries]] from the 1880s to 1940s during the [[electrification]] of industry, but is still used in some [[Developing country|developing countries]].
* [[Chief Engineering Officer]] &amp;ndash; similar to the more common ''CTO''; responsible for technology/product R &amp; D and/or manufacturing issues in a technology company. This position is generally separate from any internal IT functions (the realm of the CIO). This title occurs more in those technology companies that make products other than software, but increasingly CTO is used instead now in both software and non-software industries alike to refer to overseeing the development of technology being commercialized.
* [[Chief executive officer|Chief Executive Officer]] or CEO ([[United States]]), Chief Executive or [[Managing director]] ([[United Kingdom]], [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and some other English speaking countries) &amp;ndash; The CEO of a corporation is the highest ranking management officer of a corporation and has final decisions over human, financial, environmental, technical operations of the corporation. The CEO is also a visionary, often leaving day-to-day operations to the President, COO or division heads. Other corporate officers such as the COO, CFO, CIO, and division heads report to the CEO. The CEO is also often the Chairman of the Board, especially in closely held corporations and also often in public corporations. Recently, though, many public companies have been separating the roles of Chairman and CEO to improve corporate governance. President and CEO is a popular combination if there is a separate chairman.
* [[Chief Financial Officer]] or CFO &amp;ndash; high level corporate officer with oversight of corporate finances; reports to the ''CEO''. May concurrently hold the title of ''Treasurer'' or oversee such a position; it must be noted that Finance deals with accounting and audits, while Treasurer deals with company funds.
* [[Chief Human Resources Officer]] or CHRO
* [[Chief Information Officer]] or CIO &amp;ndash; high level corporate manager with overall responsibility for the company's information resources and processing environment; generally reports to the ''CEO'' or ''COO''. Particularly important in IT companies or companies that rely heavily on an IT infrastructure for their operations.
* [[Chief Information Security Officer]] or CISO.
* [[Chief Innovation Officer]]
* [[Chief Intellectual Property Officer]] or CIPO &amp;ndash; responsible for the management of the IP assets and potential IP-related liabilities of the enterprise.
* [[Chief Investment Officer]] or CIO &amp;ndash; high level corporate officer responsible for the assets of an investment vehicle or investment management company and/or responsible for the asset-liability management (ALM) of typical large financial institutions such as insurers, banks and/or pension funds; generally reports to the ''CEO'' or ''CFO''.
* [[Chief Legal Officer]] or CLO &amp;ndash; the CLO is traditionally referred to as the General Counsel, or GC;
* [[Chief Learning Officer]] or CLO &amp;ndash; the CLO is commonly responsible for all Learning/Training Operations.
* [[Chief Marketing Officer]] or CMO.
* [[Chief Medical Officer]] or CMO &amp;ndash; especially in a [[pharmaceutical company]], the person responsible for scientific and medical excellence of the company's research, development and products.
* [[Chief Networking Officer]] or CNO &amp;ndash; responsible for the [[social capital]] within the company and between the company and its partners
* [[Chief operating officer|Chief Operating Officer]] or COO &amp;ndash; high level corporate officer with responsibility for the daily operation of the company; reports to the ''CEO''. The COO often also carries the title of President, especially if the number one is the Chairman and CEO. Unlike other C-suite positions, which tend to be defined according to commonly designated responsibilities across most companies, the COO job tends to be defined in relation to the specific CEO with whom he/she works, given the close working relationship of these two individuals.&lt;ref name=hbr2006&gt;{{Citation

Similarly, the COO role is highly contingent and situational, as the role changes from company to company and even from CEO to successor CEO within the same company.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt; Many modern companies operate without a COO.

* [[Chief Performance Officer]]
* [[Chief Privacy Officer]]
* [[Chief Process Officer]] or CPO.
* [[Chief Procurement Officer]] or CPO.
* [[Chief Product Officer]] or CPO &amp;ndash; responsible for all product-related matters. Usually includes product conception and development, production in general, innovation, project and product management. In many IT/telecommunications companies, this position is organically higher than the chief technical officer and includes release management and production. In small and mid-sized companies it can also play the role of the COO.
* [[Chief Promotions Officer]] or CPO.
* [[Chief Relationship Officer]] or CRO &amp;ndash; Companies have used this title to mean several different things: (1) officer responsible for key external relationships including Investor Relations, Government Relations and sometimes Public Relations or Communications; (2) alternate term for [[Chief Human Resources Officer]]; (3) alternate term for [[Chief Networking Officer]]
* [[Chief Revenue Officer]] or CRO &amp;ndash; Responsible for all revenue within the organization.
* [[Chief Risk Officer]] (Chief Risk Management Officer) or CRO &amp;ndash; Common in financial institutions.
* [[Chief Sales Officer]] or CSO &amp;ndash; responsible for all sales/revenue within the organization.
* [[Chief Science Officer]] &amp;ndash; responsible for research, development and new technologies.
* [[Chief Search Officer]] &amp;ndash; responsible for research, development and planning of brand search marketing.
* [[Chief Security Officer]] or CSO.
* [[Chief Specialist Officer]] or CSO &amp;ndash; VP level corporate officer responsible for a specific function or area at corporate level.
* [[Chief Strategy Officer]] (Chief Strategic Planning Officer) or CSO (CSPO).
* [[Chief Supply Chain Officer]] or CSCO &amp;ndash; high level corporate officer responsible for the supply chain management of the company.
* [[Chief Tax Officer]] or CTO &amp;ndash; high level corporate officer responsible for the tax function (compliance, accounting and planning) within a company. The CTO may report to the CEO, CFO, general counsel or the internal audit function.
* [[Chief technical officer|Chief Technical Officer]] or CTO (sometimes Chief Technology Officer) &amp;ndash; high level corporate officer responsible for the company's technology/R&amp;D direction. Now common in both IT/software and other technological fields as well, the focus on this position is typically overseeing the development of technology ''to be commercialized''. (For an IT company, the subject matter would be similar to the CIO's, however the C''T''O's focus is technology for the firm to ''sell'' versus technology used for facilitating the firm's own operations.)
* [[Chief visionary officer]]
* [[Chief Web Officer]]
* [[Chief International officer]] or CIO &amp;ndash; Responsible for development and implementation of overseas markets
*[[Comptroller|Financial Control Officer]], FCO or FC, also Comptroller or Controller &amp;ndash; supervises accounting and financial reporting within an organization.
* Director or Member of the [[Board of Directors]] &amp;ndash; a high level official with a fiduciary responsibility of overseeing the operation of a corporation and elects or removes officers of a corporation; nominally, ''Directors'', other than the ''Chairman'' are usually not considered to be employees of the company ''per se'', although they may receive compensation, often including benefits; in publicly held companies. A ''Board of Directors'' is normally made up of members (''Directors'') who are a mixture of corporate officials who are also management employees of the company ([[inside director]]s) and persons who are not employed by the company in any capacity ([[outside director]]s or [[non-executive director]]s). In privately held companies, the ''Board of Directors'' often only consists of the statutory corporate officials, and in ''sole proprietorship'' and ''partnerships'', the board is entirely optional, and if it does exist, only operates in an advisory capacity to the owner or ''partner''s. Non-profit corporations are governed by a ''Board of Trustees'' instead of a ''Board of Directors''
* [[Director (business)|Director]] &amp;ndash; a manager of managers within an organization who is often responsible for a major business function and who often reports to a Vice President. Often used with name of a functional area; ''Finance Director'', ''Director of Finance'', ''Marketing Director'', and so on. Not to be confused with a ''Member of the Board of Directors'' who is also referred to as a ''Director''. Alternatively, a manager of managers is often referred to as a &quot;senior manager' or as an &quot;associate vice president&quot;, depending upon levels of management.
* Fellow &amp;ndash; In a dual career ladder organization a fellow is often a very senior technical position and is equal to a director or VP.
* [[President]] &amp;ndash; legally recognized highest &quot;titled&quot; corporate officer, and usually a member of the Board of Directors. There is much variation; often the CEO also holds the title of President, while in other organizations if there is a separate CEO, the President is then second highest-ranking position. In such a case the President is often the COO and is considered to be more focused upon daily operations compared to the CEO which is supposed to be the visionary. If the corporate President is not the COO (such as [[Richard Parsons]] of [[Time Warner]] from 1995–2001), then many division heads report directly to the CEO themselves, with the President taking on special assignments from the CEO.
* [[Secretary]] or [[Company secretary]] &amp;ndash; legally recognized &quot;titled&quot; corporate officer who reports to the Board of Directors and is responsible for keeping the records of the Board and the company. This title is often concurrently held by the ''treasurer'' in a dual position called ''secretary-treasurer''; both positions may be concurrently held by the ''CFO''. Note, however, that the ''Secretary'' has a reporting line to the Board of Directors, regardless of any other reporting lines conferred by concurrent titles.
* [[Secretary-Treasurer]] &amp;ndash; in many cases, the offices of ''Secretary'' and ''Treasurer'' are held by the same person. In this case, the position is commonly referred to by the combined title ''Secretary-Treasurer''
* [[Treasurer]] &amp;ndash; legally recognized corporate officer entrusted with the fiduciary responsibility of caring for company funds. Often this title is held concurrently with that of ''Secretary'' in a dual role called ''secretary-treasurer''. It can also be held concurrently with the title of ''CFO'' or fall under the jurisdiction of one, though the CFO tends to oversee the Finance Department instead, which deals with accounting and audits, while the Treasurer deals directly with company funds. Note, however, that the ''Treasurer'' has a reporting line to the Board of Directors, regardless of any other reporting lines conferred by concurrent titles.
* [[Statutory agent]]
* [[Administration (business)|Superintendent]]
* [[Associate]] &amp;ndash; Used in many different ways in US business. Often used to indicate a customer service position or temporary/part time worker. Some US businesses use the term for all or most [[Exempt Employee|Exempt]]-employees. In legal firms the title is used to indicated a lawyer who is not a [[partner]] of the law firm. Partner is often used in a similar way.
* [[Supervisor]]
* [[Foreman]]
* [[General manager]] or GM
* [[Manager]]
* [[Of Counsel]] &amp;ndash; A lawyer working on a part time or temporary basis for a company or law firm.
* [[Owner]] (sometimes Proprietor or Sole Proprietor, for [[sole proprietorship]]s)
* [[Partner (business rank)|Partner]] &amp;ndash; Used in many different ways. This may indicate a co-owner as in a legal partnership or may be used in a general way to refer to a broad class of employees or temporary/contract workers who are often assigned field or customer service work. Associate is often used in a similar way.
* Principal &amp;ndash; may refer to an [[Owner]] of the business or as a high level technical worker such as Principal Engineer or Principal Scientist. The Principal title is often used in [[dual career ladder]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.sun.com/syw/entry/career_ladders_at_sun]&lt;/ref&gt; organizations and may be equivalent to manager or director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectpartners.com/resources/prineng.html Principal Engineer—ASCE Definition of Classification]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vice Chair or [[Vice Chairman]] &amp;ndash; officer of the Board of Directors who may stand in for the ''Chairman'' in his/her absence. However, this type of Vice Chairman title on its own usually has only an advisory role and not an operational one (such as [[Ted Turner]] at [[Time Warner]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.com/ustv/news/a10201/ted-turner-quits-as-aoltw-vice-chairman.html]&lt;/ref&gt; An unrelated definition of ''Vice Chair'' describes an executive who is higher ranking or has more seniority than ''Executive Vice President''. Sometimes, EVPs report to the Vice Chair who in turn reports directly to the CEO (so Vice Chairs in effect constitute an additional layer of management), other Vice Chairs have more responsibilities but are otherwise on an equal tier with EVPs. Executive vice chairman are usually ''not'' necessarily be on the board of directors. [[Royal Bank of Canada]] previously used Vice Chair in their inner management circle until 2004 but have since renamed them as ''Group Head''.
* [[Vice President]] &amp;ndash; Middle or upper manager in a corporation. They often appear in various hierarchical layers such as ''Executive Vice President'', ''Senior Vice President'', ''Associate Vice President'', or ''Assistant Vice President'', with EVP usually considered the highest and usually reporting to the CEO or President. Many times, corporate officers such as the ''CFO'', ''COO'', ''CIO'', ''CTO'', ''Secretary'', or ''Treasurer'' will concurrently hold ''Vice President'' titles, commonly EVP or SVP. Vice Presidents in small companies are also referred to as chiefs of a certain division, such as VP of Finance, or VP of Administration.

===Exempt and non-exempt===
Other [[Corporation|corporate]] employee classifications, in US organizations, include:
*[[Exempt Employee|Exempt]] &amp;ndash; Meaning that they're exempt from the [[Fair Labor Standards Act|FLSA]]. In a corporation, this generally applies to salaried professional staff, and executives, earning in excess of $23,660 annually.
*[[Non Exempt Employee|Non-exempt]] &amp;ndash; Generally an employee paid by the hour who is entitled to a minimum wage, overtime pay at the rate of time and one-half the regular rate for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week or according to state labor laws, as well as other protections under child labor and equal pay laws.

===Employee hierarchy in large banks===
* C-level officer
** Managing Director (MD)
*** Executive Director (ED)
**** Senior Vice President (SVP)
***** Vice President (VP)
****** Assistant Vice President (AVP)
******* Associate, Officer, etc.
******** Analyst
********* Non-officer

===Employee hierarchy in Information Technology companies===
* Chief Executive Officer
** Vice President
*** [[Director (business)|Director]]
**** Senior Project Manager / Senior Product Manager / Senior Software Architect
***** [[Project Manager]] / [[Product Manager]] / [[Software Architect]]
****** Project Lead / Senior Team Lead / Senior Technical Lead
******* Module Lead / [[Team leader|Team Lead]] / [[Technical lead|Technical Lead]]
******** Senior Software Engineer / Senior QA Engineer
********* [[Software Engineer]] / [[Software quality assurance|QA Engineer]]

===Non-employees===
Most modern corporations also have non-[[employee]] workers. These are usually 'temps' (temporary workers) or [[consultant]]s who, depending on the project and their experience, might be brought on to lead a task for which the skill-set did not exist within the company, or in the case of a temp, in the vernacular sense, to perform busy-work or an otherwise low-skilled repetitive task for which an employee is deemed too valuable to perform.

Non-employees generally are employed by outside agencies or firms, but perform their duties within a corporation or similar entity. They do not have the same benefits as employees of that company, such as pay-grades, health insurance, or sick days.

Some high-skilled consultants, however, may garner some benefits such as a bonus, sick leave, or food and travel expenses, since they usually charge a high flat-fee for their services, or otherwise garner high hourly wages. An example of high-skilled consultants include [[lawyer]]s and [[accountant]]s who may not be employed by a corporation, but have their own firms or practices. Most temps, however, are compensated strictly for the hours they work, and are generally non-exempt.

'''Cambridge''' is a city in [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]], in the [[Greater Boston]] area.

==History==
The site for what would become Cambridge was chosen in December 1630, because it was located safely up river from Boston Harbor, which made it easily defensible from attacks by enemy ships. Also, the water from the local spring was so good that the local Natives believed it had medicinal properties.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The first houses were built in the spring of 1631. The settlement was initially referred to as &quot;the newe towne&quot;.&lt;ref name=drake&gt;{{cite book|last=Drake|first=Samuel Adams|title=History of Middlesex County, Massachusetts|publisher=Estes and Lauriat|location=Boston|year=1880|volume=1|pages=305–16|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QGolOAyd9RMC&amp;pg=PA316&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;dq=newetowne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bWCYe4Smmz&amp;sig=SqBiih-2JOSzUBFnLaYU72oUmBI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result#PPA305,M1|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official Massachusetts records show the name capitalized as '''Newe Towne''' by 1632.&lt;ref name=public&gt;{{cite book|title=Report on the Custody and Condition of the Public Records of Parishes|publisher=Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IyYWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA298&amp;lpg=RA1-PA298&amp;dq=%22Ordered+That+Newtowne+shall+henceforward+be+called%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N6PaGaOGde&amp;sig=BFD1ofKIt1kxt5c9Lf3v-UYlcGU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result|location=Boston|year=1889|page=298|accessdate=December 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located at the first convenient [[Charles River]] crossing west of [[Boston]], Newe Towne was one of a number of towns (including Boston, [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]], [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]], and [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|Weymouth]]) founded by the 700 original [[Puritan]] colonists of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] under governor [[John Winthrop]]. The original village site is in the heart of today's [[Harvard Square]]. The marketplace where farmers brought in crops from surrounding towns to sell survives today as the small park at the corner of John F. Kennedy (J.F.K.) and Winthrop Streets, then at the edge of a salt marsh, since filled. The town included a much larger area than the present city, with various outlying parts becoming independent towns over the years: [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton (originally Cambridge Village, then Newtown)]] in 1688,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ritter |first= Priscilla R. |coauthors= Thelma Fleishman |title= Newton, Massachusetts 1679–1779: A Biographical Directory |year= 1982 |publisher= New England Historic Genealogical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington (Cambridge Farms)]] in 1712, and both [[Arlington, Massachusetts|West Cambridge (originally Menotomy)]] and [[Brighton, Massachusetts|Brighton (Little Cambridge)]] in 1807. Part of West Cambridge joined the new town of [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]] in 1859, and the rest of West Cambridge was renamed Arlington in 1867; Brighton was annexed by Boston in 1874. In the late 19th century, various schemes for annexing Cambridge itself to the City of Boston were pursued and rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ANNEXATION AND ITS FRUITS |author=Staff writer |first= |last= |authorlink= |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9901E4DC173BEF34BC4D52DFB766838F669FDE |format= |agency= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=January 15, 1874, Wednesday |page= 4 |pages= |at= |accessdate= |language= |trans_title= |quote= |archiveurl=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9901E4DC173BEF34BC4D52DFB766838F669FDE |archivedate=January 15, 1874 |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BOSTON'S ANNEXATION SCHEMES.; PROPOSAL TO ABSORB CAMBRIDGE AND OTHER NEAR-BY TOWNS |author=Staff writer |first= |last= |authorlink= |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C05E1DC1F39E233A25754C2A9659C94639ED7CF |format= |agency= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=March 26, 1892, Wednesday |page= 11 |pages= |at= |accessdate=August 21, 2010 |language= |trans_title= |quote= |archiveurl=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C05E1DC1F39E233A25754C2A9659C94639ED7CF |archivedate=March 27, 1892 |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1636, [[Harvard College]] was founded by the colony to train [[minister (religion)|ministers]] and the new town was chosen for its site by [[Thomas Dudley]]. By 1638, the name &quot;Newe Towne&quot; had &quot;compacted by usage into 'Newtowne'.&quot;&lt;ref name=drake /&gt; In May 1638&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge of Eighteen Hundred and Ninety-six|editor=Arthur Gilman, ed.|publisher=Committee on the Memorial Volume|location=Cambridge|year=1896|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/05.02/02-history.html ''Harvard Gazette'' historical calendar giving May 12, 1638 as date of name change; certain other sources say May 2, 1638 or late 1637]&lt;/ref&gt; the name was changed to '''Cambridge''' in honor of the [[University of Cambridge|university]] in [[Cambridge, England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hannah Winthrop Chapter, D.A.R. |title= Historic Guide to Cambridge |edition= Second |year= 1907 |publisher= Hannah Winthrop Chapter, D.A.R. |location= Cambridge, Mass. |pages= 20–21 |quote= On October&amp;nbsp;15, 1637, the Great and General Court passed a vote that: &quot;The college is ordered to bee at Newetowne.&quot; In this same year the name of Newetowne was changed to Cambridge, (&quot;It is ordered that Newetowne shall henceforward be called Cambridge&quot;) in honor of the university in Cambridge, England, where many of the early settlers were educated. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first president ([[Henry Dunster]]), the first benefactor ([[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]]), and the first schoolmaster ([[Nathaniel Eaton]]) of Harvard were all Cambridge University alumni, as was the then ruling (and first) governor of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], John Winthrop.

Cambridge grew slowly as an agricultural village eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) by road from Boston, the capital of the colony. By the [[American Revolution]], most residents lived near the [[Cambridge Common|Common]] and Harvard College, with farms and estates comprising most of the town. Most of the inhabitants were descendants of the original Puritan colonists, but there was also a small elite of [[Anglicans|Anglican]] &quot;worthies&quot; who were not involved in village life, who made their livings from estates, investments, and trade, and lived in mansions along &quot;the Road to Watertown&quot; (today's [[Brattle Street (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|Brattle Street]], still known as [[Tory Row]]). In 1775, [[George Washington]] came up from [[Virginia]] to take command of fledgling volunteer American soldiers camped on the [[Cambridge Common]]—today called the birthplace of the [[U.S. Army]]. (The name of today's nearby Sheraton Commander Hotel refers to that event.) Most of the Tory estates were confiscated after the Revolution. On January 24, 1776, [[Henry Knox]] arrived with artillery captured from [[Fort Ticonderoga]], which enabled Washington to drive the British army out of Boston.

[[File:Cambridge 1873 WardMap.jpg|thumb|350px|left|A map of Cambridge from 1873.]]
Between 1790 and 1840, Cambridge began to grow rapidly, with the construction of the [[West Boston Bridge]] in 1792, that connected Cambridge directly to Boston, making it no longer necessary to travel eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) through the [[Boston Neck]], [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]], and [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] to cross the [[Charles River]]. A second bridge, the Canal Bridge, opened in 1809 alongside the new [[Middlesex Canal]]. The new bridges and roads made what were formerly estates and [[marsh]]land into prime industrial and residential districts.

In the mid-19th century, Cambridge was the center of a literary revolution when it gave the country a new identity through poetry and literature. Cambridge was home to the famous Fireside Poets—so called because their poems would often be read aloud by families in front of their evening fires. In their day, the [[Fireside Poets]]—[[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[James Russell Lowell]], and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]]—were as popular and influential as rock stars are today.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Soon after, [[Toll road|turnpikes]] were built: the [[Cambridge and Concord Turnpike]] (today's Broadway and Concord Ave.), the [[Middlesex Turnpike (Massachusetts)|Middlesex Turnpike]] (Hampshire St. and [[Massachusetts Avenue (Boston)|Massachusetts Ave.]] northwest of [[Porter Square]]), and what are today's Cambridge, Main, and Harvard Streets were roads to connect various areas of Cambridge to the bridges. In addition, railroads crisscrossed the town during the same era, leading to the development of Porter Square as well as the creation of neighboring town [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] from the formerly rural parts of [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]].

Cambridge was incorporated as a city in 1846. This was despite noticeable tensions between East Cambridge, Cambridgeport, and Old Cambridge that stemmed from differences in in each area's culture, sources of income, and the national origins of the residents.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Considered: A Very Brief History of Cambridge, 1800-1900, Part I. http://cambridgeconsidered.blogspot.com/2011/01/very-brief-history-of-cambridge-1800.html&lt;/ref&gt; The city's commercial center began to shift from Harvard Square to Central Square, which became the downtown of the city around this time. Between 1850 and 1900, Cambridge took on much of its present character—[[streetcar suburb]]an development along the turnpikes, with working-class and industrial neighborhoods focused on East Cambridge, comfortable middle-class housing being built on old estates in Cambridgeport and Mid-Cambridge, and upper-class enclaves near Harvard University and on the minor hills of the city. The coming of the railroad to North Cambridge and Northwest Cambridge then led to three major changes in the city: the development of massive brickyards and brickworks between Massachusetts Ave., Concord Ave. and [[Alewife Brook]]; the ice-cutting industry launched by [[Frederic Tudor]] on [[Fresh Pond, Cambridge, Massachusetts|Fresh Pond]]; and the carving up of the last estates into residential subdivisions to provide housing to the thousands of immigrants that arrived to work in the new industries.

For many years, the city's largest employer was the [[New England Glass Company]], founded in 1818. By the middle of the 19th century it was the largest and most modern glassworks in the world. In 1888, all production was moved, by [[Edmund Drummond Libbey]], to [[Toledo, Ohio]], where it continues today under the name Owens Illinois. Flint glassware with heavy lead content, produced by that company, is prized by antique glass collectors. There is none on public display in Cambridge, but there is a large collection in the [[Toledo Museum of Art]].

Among the largest businesses located in Cambridge was the firm of [[Carter's Ink Company]], whose neon sign long adorned the [[Charles River]] and which was for many years the largest manufacturer of ink in the world.

By 1920, Cambridge was one of the main industrial cities of [[New England]], with nearly 120,000 residents. As industry in New England began to decline during the [[Great Depression]] and after World War II, Cambridge lost much of its industrial base. It also began the transition to being an intellectual, rather than an industrial, center. Harvard University had always been important in the city (both as a landowner and as an institution), but it began to play a more dominant role in the city's life and culture. Also, the move of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] from Boston in 1912 ensured Cambridge's status as an intellectual center of the United States.

After the 1950s, the city's population began to decline slowly, as families tended to be replaced by single people and young couples. The 1980s brought a wave of high-technology startups, creating software such as [[Visicalc]] and [[Lotus 1-2-3]], and advanced computers, but many of these companies fell into decline with the fall of the minicomputer and [[DOS]]-based systems. However, the city continues to be home to many startups as well as a thriving biotech industry. By the end of the 20th century, Cambridge had one of the most expensive housing markets in the Northeastern United States.

While maintaining much diversity in class, race, and age, it became harder and harder for those who grew up in the city to be able to afford to stay. The end of [[rent control]] in 1994 prompted many Cambridge renters to move to housing that was more affordable, in Somerville and other communities. In 2005, a reassessment of residential property values resulted in a disproportionate number of houses owned by non-affluent people jumping in value relative to other houses, with hundreds having their property tax increased by over 100%; this forced many homeowners in Cambridge to move elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Chronicle, October 6, 13, 20, 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006, Cambridge's mix of amenities and proximity to Boston has kept housing prices relatively stable.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 7.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (18.5&amp;nbsp;km²), of which 6.4&amp;nbsp;square miles (16.7&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.7&amp;nbsp;square miles (1.8&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (9.82%) is water.

===Adjacent towns===
Cambridge is located in eastern Massachusetts, bordered by:

*the city of [[Boston]] to the south (across the [[Charles River]]) and east
*the city of [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] to the north
*the town of [[Arlington, Massachusetts|Arlington]] to the northwest
*the town of [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]] and
*the city of [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] to the west

The border between Cambridge and the neighboring city of [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] passes through densely populated neighborhoods which are connected by the MBTA Red Line. Some of the main squares, [[Inman Square|Inman]], [[Porter Square|Porter]], and to a lesser extent, [[Harvard Square|Harvard]], are very close to the city line, as are Somerville's [[Union Square (Somerville)|Union]] and [[Davis Square]]s.

Cambridge has been called the &quot;City of Squares&quot; by some,{{Who|date=May 2010}} as most of its commercial districts are major street intersections known as [[Town square|squares]]. Each of the squares acts as something of a neighborhood center. These include:
* [[Kendall Square]], formed by the junction of Broadway, Main Street, and Third Street, is also known as &quot;Technology Square,&quot; a name shared with an office and laboratory building cluster in the neighborhood. Just over the [[Longfellow Bridge]] from Boston, at the eastern end of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] campus, it is served by an [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] [[Kendall (MBTA station)|Red Line station]]. Most of Cambridge's large office towers are located here, giving the area somewhat of an office park feel. A flourishing [[biotech]] industry has grown up around this area. The &quot;One Kendall Square&quot; complex is nearby, but—confusingly—not actually in Kendall Square.
* [[Central Square (Cambridge)|Central Square]], formed by the junction of Massachusetts Avenue, Prospect Street, and Western Avenue and is well-known for its wide variety of ethnic restaurants. Even as recently as the late 1990s it was rather run-down; it underwent a controversial [[gentrification]] in recent years (in conjunction with the development of the nearby [[University Park at MIT]]), and continues to grow more expensive. It is served by a [[Central (MBTA station)|Red Line station]]. ''Lafayette Square'', formed by the junction of Massachusetts Avenue, Columbia Street, Sidney Street, and Main Street, is considered a part of the Central Square area. [[Cambridgeport]] is south of Central Square along Magazine Street and Brookline Street.
* [[Harvard Square]], formed by the junction of Massachusetts Avenue, Brattle Street, and JFK Street. This is the primary site of [[Harvard University]], and is a major Cambridge shopping area (although not as exclusively so as in years past). It is served by a [[Harvard (MBTA station)|Red Line station]]. Harvard Square was originally the northwestern terminus of the Red Line and a major transfer point to streetcars that also operated in a short [[Harvard Bus Tunnel|tunnel]]—which is still a major bus terminal, although the area under the Square was reconfigured dramatically in the 1980s when the Red Line was extended. The Harvard Square area includes Brattle Square and Eliot Square. A short distance away from the square lies the [[Cambridge Common]], while the neighborhood north of Harvard and east of Massachusetts Avenue is known as Agassiz in honor of the famed scientist [[Louis Agassiz]].
* [[Porter Square]], about a mile north on Massachusetts Avenue from Harvard Square, is formed by the junction of Massachusetts and Somerville Avenues, and includes part of the city of [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]]. It is served by the [[Porter (MBTA station)|Porter Square station]], a complex housing a [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] stop and a [[Fitchburg Line]] [[MBTA commuter rail|commuter rail]] stop. [[Lesley University]]'s University Hall and Porter campus are located at Porter Square.
* [[Inman Square]], at the junction of Cambridge and Hampshire streets in Mid-Cambridge. Inman Square is home to many diverse restaurants, bars and boutiques. The funky street scene still holds some urban flair, but was dressed up recently with Victorian streetlights, benches and bus stops. A new community park was installed and is a favorite place to enjoy some takeout food from the nearby restaurants and ice cream parlor.
* [[Lechmere Square]], at the junction of Cambridge and First streets, adjacent to the CambridgeSide Galleria shopping mall. Perhaps best known as the northern terminus of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] subway.

====Other neighborhoods====
The residential neighborhoods ([http://www.cambridgema.gov/CPD/publications/neighborhoods.cfm map]) in Cambridge border, but are not defined by the squares. These include:
* [[East Cambridge, Massachusetts|East Cambridge]] (Area 1) is bordered on the north by the [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] border, on the east by the Charles River, on the south by Broadway and Main Street, and on the west by the [[Grand Junction Railroad]] tracks. It includes the [[NorthPoint (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|NorthPoint]] development.
* [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Campus ([[MIT Campus (Area 2), Cambridge|Area 2]]) is bordered on the north by Broadway, on the south and east by the Charles River, and on the west by the Grand Junction Railroad tracks.

* [[Area 4, Cambridge|Area 4]] is bordered on the north by Hampshire Street, on the south by Massachusetts Avenue, on the west by Prospect Street, and on the east by the Grand Junction Railroad tracks. Residents of Area 4 often refer to their neighborhood simply as &quot;The Port&quot;, and refer to the area of Cambridgeport and Riverside as &quot;The Coast&quot;.
* [[Cambridgeport]] (Area 5) is bordered on the north by Massachusetts Avenue, on the south by the Charles River, on the west by River Street, and on the east by the Grand Junction Railroad tracks.
* [[Mid-Cambridge]] (Area 6) is bordered on the north by Kirkland and Hampshire Streets and the [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] border, on the south by Massachusetts Avenue, on the west by Peabody Street, and on the east by Prospect Street.
* [[Riverside, Cambridge|Riverside]] (Area 7), an area sometimes referred to as &quot;The Coast&quot;, is bordered on the north by Massachusetts Avenue, on the south by the Charles River, on the west by JFK Street, and on the east by River Street.
* [[Agassiz, Cambridge, Massachusetts|Agassiz (Harvard North)]] (Area 8) is bordered on the north by the [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] border, on the south and east by Kirkland Street, and on the west by Massachusetts Avenue.
* [[Peabody, Cambridge, Massachusetts|Peabody]] (Area 9) is bordered on the north by railroad tracks, on the south by Concord Avenue, on the west by railroad tracks, and on the east by Massachusetts Avenue. The Avon Hill sub-neighborhood consists of the higher elevations bounded by Upland Road, Raymond Street, Linnaean Street and Massachusetts Avenue.

* [[Cambridge Highlands]] (Area 12) is bordered on the north and east by railroad tracks, on the south by Fresh Pond, and on the west by the [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]] border.
* [[Strawberry Hill, Cambridge|Strawberry Hill]] (Area 13) is bordered on the north by Fresh Pond, on the south by the [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] border, on the west by the [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]] border, and on the east by railroad tracks.

===Parks and outdoors===

[[File:Alewife Brook Reservation.jpg|thumb|Alewife Brook]]

Consisting largely of densely built residential space, Cambridge lacks significant tracts of public parkland. This is partly compensated for, however, by the presence of easily accessible open space on the university campuses, including [[Harvard Yard]] and MIT's Great Lawn, as well as the considerable open space of [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]]. At the western edge of Cambridge, the cemetery is well known as the first garden cemetery, for its distinguished inhabitants, for its superb landscaping (the oldest planned landscape in the country), and as a first-rate [[arboretum]]. Although known as a Cambridge landmark, much of the cemetery lies within the bounds of Watertown.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.cambridgema.gov/CityOfCambridge_Content/documents/CambridgeStreetMap18x24_032007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a significant [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) in the Greater Boston area.

Public parkland includes the esplanade along the Charles River, which mirrors its [[Charles River Esplanade|Boston counterpart]], [[Cambridge Common]], a busy and historic public park immediately adjacent to the Harvard campus, and the [[Alewife Brook Reservation]] and [[Fresh Pond, Cambridge, Massachusetts|Fresh Pond]] in the western part of the city.

Cambridge was ranked as one of the most liberal cities in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govpro.com/News/Article/31439/ Study Ranks America’s Most Liberal and Conservative Cities]&lt;/ref&gt; Its residents jokingly refer to it as &quot;The People's Republic of Cambridge.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universalhub.com/glossary/peoples_republic_the.html Wicked Good Guide to Boston English] Accessed February 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Its FY 2007 residential [[property tax]] rate, $7.48 per $1000 of assessed valuation, is one of the lowest in Massachusetts. Cambridge enjoys the highest possible [[bond credit rating]], AAA, with all three Wall Street rating agencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cambridgema.gov/CityOfCambridge_Content/documents/Understanding_Your_Taxes_2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambridge is noted for its diverse population, both racially and economically. Residents, known as ''Cantabrigians'', range from affluent [[MIT]] and Harvard professors to immigrants. The first legal applications in America for same-sex marriage licenses were issued at Cambridge's City Hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2004/05/17/free_to_marry/ Free to Marry], The Boston Globe. Accessed November 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambridge is also the birthplace of [[Thailand|Thai]] king [[Bhumibol Adulyadej|Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX)]], who is the world's longest reigning monarch at age 82 (2010), as well as the longest reigning monarch in Thai history. He is also the first king of a foreign country to be born in the United States.

Cambridge is part of [[Massachusetts's 8th congressional district]], represented by Democrat [[Mike Capuano]], elected in 1998. The state's senior member of the [[United States Senate]] is Democrat [[John Kerry]], elected in 1984. The state's junior member is Republican [[Scott Brown]], [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 2010|elected in 2010]] to fill the vacancy caused by the death of long-time Democratic Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]. The Governor of Massachusetts is Democrat [[Deval Patrick]], elected in 2006 and re-elected in 2010.

On the state level, Cambridge is represented in six districts in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]]: the 24th Middlesex (which includes parts of Belmont and Arlington), the 25th and 26th Middlesex (the latter which includes a portion of Somerville), the 29th Middlesex (which includes a small part of Watertown), and the Eighth and Ninth Suffolk (both including parts of the City of Boston). The city is represented in the [[Massachusetts Senate]] as a part of the &quot;First Suffolk and Middlesex&quot; district (this contains parts of Boston, Revere and Winthrop each in Suffolk County); the &quot;Middlesex, Suffolk and Essex&quot; district, which includes Everett and Somerville, with Boston, Chelsea, and Revere of Suffolk, and Saugus in Essex; and the &quot;Second Suffolk and Middlesex&quot; district, containing parts of the City of Boston in Suffolk county, and Cambridge, Belmont and Watertown in Middlesex county.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/legis/city_town.htm Index of Legislative Representation by City and Town, from Mass.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the [[Cambridge Police Department (Massachusetts)|Cambridge Police Department]], the city is patrolled by the Fifth (Brighton) Barracks of Troop H of the [[Massachusetts State Police]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eopsterminal&amp;L=5&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Law+Enforcement+%26+Criminal+Justice&amp;L2=Law+Enforcement&amp;L3=State+Police+Troops&amp;L4=Troop+H&amp;sid=Eeops&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=msp_divisions_field_services_troops_troop_h_msp_field_troop_h_station_h5&amp;csid=Eeops Station H-5, SP Brighton]&lt;/ref&gt; Due, however, to close proximity, the city also practices functional cooperation with the Fourth (Boston) Barracks of Troop H, as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eopsterminal&amp;L=5&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Law+Enforcement+%26+Criminal+Justice&amp;L2=Law+Enforcement&amp;L3=State+Police+Troops&amp;L4=Troop+H&amp;sid=Eeops&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=msp_divisions_field_services_troops_troop_h_msp_field_troop_h_station_h4&amp;csid=Eeops Station H-4, SP Boston]&lt;/ref&gt;

===City government===
[[Image:CambridgeMACityHall1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cambridge, Massachusetts City Hall|Cambridge City Hall]] in the 1980s]]
Cambridge has a city government led by a [[List of mayors of Cambridge, Massachusetts|Mayor]] and nine-member City Council. There is also a six-member School Committee which functions alongside the Superintendent of public schools. The councilors and school committee members are elected every two years using the [[single transferable vote]] (STV) system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgema.gov/election/Proportional_Representation.cfm Proportional Representation Voting in Cambridge]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the disbanding of the New York City Community School Boards in 2002, Cambridge's Council is now unusual in being the [[List of US cities that have used STV|only governing body in the United States]] to still use STV.&lt;ref&gt;http://ccrc.wustl.edu/~lorracks/projects/techreport/subsection3_4_4.html&lt;/ref&gt; Once a laborious process that took several days to complete by hand, ballot sorting and calculations to determine the outcome of elections are now quickly performed by computer, after the ballots have been [[Optical scan voting system|optically scanned]].

The mayor is elected by the city councilors from amongst themselves, and serves as the chair of City Council meetings. The mayor also sits on the School Committee. However, the Mayor is not the Chief Executive of the City. Rather, the City Manager, who is appointed by the City Council, serves in that capacity.

Under the City's Plan E form of government the city council does not have the power to appoint or remove city officials who are under direction of the city manager. The city council and its individual members are also forbidden from giving orders to any subordinate of the city manager.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cambridgema.gov/CityOfCambridge_Content/documents/planE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, [[Robert W. Healy]] is the City Manager; he has served in the position since 1981. The city council consists of:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgema.gov/deptann.cfm?story_id=2480 City of Cambridge – Department Announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refbegin|3}}

===Fire Department===
Gerald R. Reardon is the chief of the Cambridge Fire Department. John J. Gelinas, the chief of operations, is in charge of day to day operation of the department. The Cambridge Fire Department is rated as a class 1 fire department by the [[Insurance Services Office]] (ISO), and is one of only 32 fire departments so rated, out of 37,000 departments in the United States. The other class 1 departments in New England are in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] and [[Milford, Connecticut]]. Class 1 signifies the highest level of fire protection according to various criteria.

The Cambridge Fire Department is a professional fire department which protects the city of Cambridge 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It operates out of eight city-wide firehouses in two divisions (downtown and uptown), and has a frontline fire apparatus fleet of 11 engine companies (two of which are reserve engines), five ladder companies (one of which is a reserve ladder), a tactical rescue unit, a &quot;[[hazmat]]&quot; unit, a dive rescue unit, two marine units, and two non-transporting paramedic ambulances.

===Water Department===

Cambridge is unusual among cities inside Route 128 in having a non-[[MWRA]] water supply. City water is obtained from [[Hobbs Brook]] (in [[Lincoln, Massachusetts|Lincoln]] and [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]]), [[Stony Brook]] (Waltham and [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]), and [[Fresh Pond (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|Fresh Pond]] (Cambridge). Water is treated at Fresh Pond, then pumped uphill to an elevation of {{convert|176|ft|m}} [[above sea level]] at the Payson Park Reservoir ([[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]]); From there, the water is redistributed downhill via gravity to individual users in the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cambridgema.gov/CityOfCambridge_Content/documents/CWD_March_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgema.gov/CWD/fpfaqs.cfm Is Fresh Pond really used for drinking water?], Cambridge Water Department&lt;/ref&gt;

===County government===

Cambridge is a [[county seat]] of [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts]], along with [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]]. Though the county government was abolished in 1997, the county still exists as a geographical and political region. The employees of Middlesex County courts, jails, registries, and other county agencies now work directly for the state. At present, the county's registrars of Deeds and Probate remain in Cambridge, however, the Superior Court and District Attorney have had their base of operations transferred to [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]]. Third District court has shifted operations to [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], and the Sheriff's office for the county is still awaiting a near-term relocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2008/02/14/court_move_a_hassle_for_commuters/ |title=Court move a hassle for commuters |accessdate=July 25, 2009 |first=Eric |last=Moskowitz |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=February 14, 2008 |month=02 |format= |work=[[Boston Globe|The Boston Globe]] |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=In a little more than a month, Middlesex Superior Court will open in Woburn after nearly four decades at the Edward J.

In 2003, the CRLS, also known as Rindge, came close to losing its educational accreditation when it was placed on probation by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Crimson MCAS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=512061|title=School Fights Achievement Gap|publisher=The Harvard Crimson|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school has improved under Principal Chris Saheed, graduation rates hover around 98%, and 70% of students gain college admission.

Community Charter School of Cambridge serves 350 students, primarily from Boston and Cambridge, and is a tuition free public charter school with a college preparatory curriculum. All students from the class of 2009 and 2010 gained admission to college.

Outside of the main public schools are public charter schools including: [[Benjamin Banneker Charter School]], which serves students in grades K-6,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banneker.org/ The Benjamin Banneker Charter Public School]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Community Charter School of Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccscambridge.org/ Community Charter School of Cambridge]&lt;/ref&gt; which is located in Kendall Square and serves students in grades 7–12, and [[Prospect Hill Academy]], a [[charter school]] whose upper school is in [[Central Square]], though it is not a part of the Cambridge Public School District.

==Economy==

[[File:Cambridge Skyline.jpg|thumb|Buildings of [[Kendall Square]], center of Cambridge's [[biotech]] economy, seen from the [[Charles River]]]]

{{Ref improve section|date=July 2009}}
Manufacturing was an important part of the economy in the late 19th and early 20th century, but educational institutions are the city's biggest employers today. Both Harvard and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] together employ about 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgema.gov/~CDD/data/labor/top25/top25_2008.html Top 25 Cambridge Employers: 2008], City of Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; As a cradle of technological innovation, Cambridge was home to such legendary technology firms as [[Analog Devices]], [[Akamai Technologies|Akamai]], [[BBN Technologies|Bolt, Beranek, and Newman (BBN Technologies)]] (now part of Raytheon), [[General Radio|General Radio (later GenRad)]], [[Lotus Development Corporation]] (now part of [[IBM]]), [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]], [[Symbolics]], [[Thinking Machines]], and [[VMware]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Over the years, most of these tech companies either have grown and moved away or declined and closed their businesses; see this [http://www.cambridgema.gov/~CDD/data/labor/ list] for more information. In 1996, [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]], [[Arthur D. Little]], and [[Lotus Development Corporation|Lotus]] were all top employers with over 1,000 employees in Cambridge, but declined or disappeared a few years later. In 2005, alongside Harvard and MIT, health care and biotechnology firms such as [[Genzyme]], [[Biogen Idec]], and [[Novartis]] dominate the city economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Novartis doubles plan for Cambridge |author=Casey Ross and Robert Weisman |first= |last= |authorlink= |authorlink2= |url=http://articles.boston.com/2010-10-27/business/29323650_1_french-drug-maker-astrazeneca-plc-research-operations |format= |agency= |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=October 27, 2010 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate=April 12, 2011 |language= |trans_title= |quote=Already Cambridge’s largest corporate employer, the Swiss firm expects to hire an additional 200 to 300 employees over the next five years, bringing its total workforce in the city to around 2,300.

A number of biotechnology companies are also located in [[University Park at MIT]], a new development in another former manufacturing area. None of the high technology firms that once dominated the economy was among the 25 largest employers in 2005, but by 2008 [[Akamai Technologies|Akamai]] and [[ITA Software]] had grown to be among the largest employers. Many smaller start-ups and IT companies nonetheless remain as important employers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

[[Google]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.google.com/corporate/address.html Google Offices].&quot; Retrieved on July 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[IBM Research]], and [[Microsoft Research]] maintain offices in Cambridge. Video game developer [[Harmonix Music Systems]] is based in Central Square. The city is also the New England headquarters for [[Miramax Films]] and [[Time Warner Cable]].

The proximity of Cambridge's universities has also made the city a center for nonprofit groups and think tanks, including the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], the [[Lincoln Institute of Land Policy]], [[Cultural Survival]], and [[One Laptop per Child]].

===Top employers===

According to the City's 2009 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgema.gov/audit/publications/detail.aspx?path=%2fsitecore%2fcontent%2fhome%2faudit%2fpublications%2fyearofdocumentfolders%2f09%2ffy09comprehensiveannualfinancialreport City of Cambridge CAFR]&lt;/ref&gt; the top ten employers in the city are:

==Transportation==

{{See also|Boston transportation}}

===Road===

[[File:Harvard Square at Peabody Street and Mass Avenue.jpg|thumb|[[Massachusetts Avenue (Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] in [[Harvard Square]]]]

Several major roads lead to Cambridge, including [[Massachusetts State Highway 2|Route 2]], [[Massachusetts State Highway 16|Route 16]] and the [[Massachusetts State Highway 28|McGrath Highway (Route 28)]]. The [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] does not pass through Cambridge, but provides access by an exit in nearby [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]]. Both [[U.S. Route 1]] and [[I-93 (MA)]] also provide additional access on the eastern end of Cambridge at Leverett Circle in [[Boston]]. [[Massachusetts State Highway 2A|Route 2A]] runs the length of the city, chiefly along Massachusetts Avenue. The Charles River forms the southern border of Cambridge and is crossed by 11 bridges connecting Cambridge to Boston, including the [[Longfellow Bridge]] and the [[Harvard Bridge]], eight of which are open to motorized road traffic.

Cambridge has an irregular street network because many of the roads date from the colonial era. Contrary to popular belief, the road system did not evolve from longstanding cow-paths. Roads connected various village settlements with each other and nearby towns, and were shaped by geographic features, most notably streams, hills, and swampy areas. Today, the major &quot;squares&quot; are typically connected by long, mostly straight roads, such as Massachusetts Avenue between [[Harvard Square]] and [[Central Square (Cambridge)|Central Square]], or Hampshire Street between [[Kendall Square]] and [[Inman Square]].

===Mass transit===

[[File:Central MBTA station.jpg|thumb|[[Central (MBTA)|Central Red Line Station]]]]

Cambridge is well served by the [[MBTA]], including the [[Porter (MBTA station)|Porter Square stop]] on the regional [[MBTA Commuter Rail|Commuter Rail]], the [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere stop]] on the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]], and five stops on the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] ([[Alewife Station (MBTA)|Alewife]], [[Porter (MBTA)|Porter Square]], [[Harvard (MBTA station)|Harvard Square]], [[Central (MBTA station)|Central Square]], and [[Kendall/MIT (MBTA station)|Kendall Square/MIT]]). Alewife Station, the current terminus of the Red Line, has a large multi-story parking garage (at a rate of $7 per day as of 2009).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/stations/?stopId=10029&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Harvard Bus Tunnel]], under Harvard Square, reduces traffic congestion on the surface, and connects to the Red Line underground. This tunnel was originally opened for streetcars in 1912, and served trackless trolleys and buses as the routes were converted. The tunnel was partially reconfigured when the Red Line was extended to Alewife in the early 1980s.

===Cycling===
Cambridge has several [[bike path]]s, including one along the Charles River,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/maps/bikepaths_dudley.gif Dr. Paul Dudley White Bikepath]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cambridge Linear Park|Linear Park]] connecting the [[Minuteman Bikeway]] at Alewife with the [[Somerville Community Path]]. Bike parking is common and there are bike lanes on many streets, although concerns have been expressed regarding the suitability of many of the lanes. On several central MIT streets, bike lanes transfer onto the sidewalk. Cambridge bans cycling on certain sections of sidewalk where pedestrian traffic is heavy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgema.gov/cdd/et/bike/bike_ban.html Sidewalk Bicycling Banned Areas – Cambridge Massachusetts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgema.gov/cdd/et/bike/bike_reg.html Traffic Regulations for Cyclists – Cambridge Massachusetts]&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''[[Bicycling Magazine]]'' has rated Boston as one of the worst cities in the nation for bicycling (In their words, for &quot;lousy roads, scarce and unconnected bike lanes and bike-friendly gestures from City Hall that go nowhere—such as hiring a bike coordinator in 2001, only to cut the position two years later&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bicycling.com/article/1,6610,s1-2-16-14593-11,00.html Urban Treasures – bicycling.com]&lt;/ref&gt; it has listed Cambridge as an honorable mention as one of the best&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bicycling.com/article/1,6610,s1-2-16-14593-9,00.html Urban Treasures – bicycling.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and was called by the magazine &quot;Boston's Great Hope.&quot; Cambridge has an active, official bicycle committee.

===Walking===

[[File:Weeks Footbridge Cambridge, MA.jpg|thumb|The [[John W. Weeks Bridge|Weeks Bridge]] provides a pedestrian-only connection between Boston and Cambridge over the Charles River]]

Walking is a popular activity in Cambridge. Per year 2000 data, of the communities in the U.S. with more than 100,000 residents, Cambridge has the highest percentage of commuters who walk to work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bikesatwork.com/carfree/census-lookup.php?state_select=ALL_STATES&amp;lower_pop=100000&amp;upper_pop=99999999&amp;sort_num=2&amp;show_rows=25&amp;first_row=0 The Carfree Census Database: Result of search for communities in any state with population over 100,000, sorted in descending order by % Pedestrian Commuters]&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge receives a &quot;Walk Score&quot; of 100 out of 100 possible points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walkscore.com/get-score.php?street=cambridge%2C+ma&amp;go=Go Walk Score site] Accessed July 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge's major historic squares have been recently changed into a modern walking landscape, which has sparked a traffic calming program based on the needs of pedestrians rather than of motorists.

===Intercity===
The Boston intercity bus and train stations at [[South Station]], Boston, and [[Logan International Airport]] in [[East Boston]], are accessible by [[Red Line (MBTA)|subway]]. The [[Fitchburg Line]] rail service from [[Porter (MBTA station)|Porter Square]] connects to some western suburbs. Since October 2010, there has also been intercity bus service between [[Alewife (MBTA station)|Alewife Station]] (Cambridge) and [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/cambridge/2010/10/warren_mbta_welcome_world_wide.html NYC-bound buses will roll from Newton, Cambridge]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
===Newspapers===
Cambridge is served by several weekly newspapers. The most prominent is the ''[[Cambridge Chronicle]]'', which is also the oldest surviving weekly paper in the United States.

===Radio===
Cambridge is home to the following commercially licensed and college run radio stations:

Cambridge has a large and varied collection of permanent public art, both on city property (managed by the Cambridge Arts Council),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgema.gov/CAC/Public/overview.cfm CAC Public Art Program]&lt;/ref&gt; and on the campuses of Harvard&lt;ref&gt;[http://ofa.fas.harvard.edu/visualarts/pubart.php Office for the Arts at Harvard: Public Art]&lt;/ref&gt; and MIT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://listart.mit.edu/map MIT Public Art Collection Map]&lt;/ref&gt; Temporary public artworks are displayed as part of the annual Cambridge River Festival on the banks of the Charles River, during winter celebrations in Harvard and Central Squares, and at university campus sites. An active tradition of street musicians and other performers in Harvard Square entertains an audience of tourists and local residents during the warmer months of the year. The performances are coordinated through a public process that has been developed collaboratively by the performers, city administrators, private organizations and business groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://harvardsquare.com/Home/Arts-and-Entertainment/Street-Arts-and-Buskers-Advocates.aspx Street Arts and Buskers Advocates]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Norman Colin Dexter''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], (born 29 September 1930) is an English crime writer, known for his [[Inspector Morse]] novels which were written between 1975 and 1999 and adapted as a television series from 1987 to 2000.

==Early life and career==
Dexter was born in [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]], and was educated at [[Stamford School]], where his brother, John Dexter, had been before him. After completing his [[National Service]] with the [[Royal Corps of Signals]] he read classics at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], graduating in 1953 and receiving an honorary Masters Degree in 1958.

In 1954, he started his teaching career in the [[East Midlands]], becoming assistant classics master at [[Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College|Wyggeston School]], Leicester. A post at [[Loughborough Grammar School]] followed, before he took up the position of senior classics teacher at Corby Grammar School, [[Northamptonshire]], in 1959.

In 1966, he was forced by the onset of deafness to retire from teaching, and took up the post of Senior Assistant Secretary at the University of Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations (UODLE) in [[Oxford]] – a job he held until his retirement in 1988.

Dexter featured prominently in the BBC programme &quot;How to Solve a Cryptic Crossword&quot; as part of the Time Shift series broadcast in November 2008 in which he recounted some of the crossword clues solved by Morse.

==Writing career==
He started writing mysteries in 1973 during a family holiday: &quot;We were in a little guest house halfway between [[Caernarfon]] and [[Pwllheli]]. It was a Saturday and it was raining – it's not unknown for it to rain in [[North Wales]]. The children were moaning ... I was sitting at the kitchen table with nothing else to do, and I wrote the first few paragraphs of a potential detective novel.&quot; ''Last Bus to Woodstock'' was published in 1975 and introduced the world to the character of [[Inspector Morse]], the irascible detective whose penchants for [[cryptic crossword]]s, English literature, [[cask ale]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] reflect Dexter's own enthusiasms. Dexter's plots are notable for his use of false leads and other [[red herring]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordwine.co.uk/features/summer_07/dexter.html The Oxford Wine Company - Stars in their bars: Colin Dexter]&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the 33 episodes of the TV series ''[[Inspector Morse]]'', produced between 1987 and 2001, brought further acclaim for Dexter. In the manner of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], he also makes a [[cameo appearance]] in almost all episodes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0223294/bio. Retrieved 5 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, his character from the Morse series, the stalwart Sgt (now Inspector) Lewis features in 16 episodes of the new ITV series [[Lewis (TV series)|''Lewis'']].  As with ''Morse'', Dexter makes a cameo appearance in several episodes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0223294/&lt;/ref&gt;

Dexter suggested the English poet [[Alfred Edward Housman|A E Housman]] as his &quot;great life&quot; on the [[BBC Radio 4]] [[Great Lives|programme of that name]] in May 2008.  Dexter and Housman were both classicists who found a popular audience for another genre of writing.

==Awards and honours==
Dexter has been the recipient of several [[Crime Writers' Association]] awards: two [[Silver Dagger (award)|Silver Dagger]]s for ''[[Service of All the Dead]]'' in 1979 and ''[[The Dead of Jericho]]'' in 1981; two [[Gold Dagger]]s for ''[[The Wench is Dead]]'' in 1989 and ''[[The Way Through the Woods]]'' in 1992; and a [[Cartier Diamond Dagger]] for lifetime achievement in 1997. In 1996 Dexter received a [[Macavity Awards|Macavity Award]] for his short story ''Evans Tries an O-Level''.  In 1980, he was elected a member of the by-invitation-only Detection Club.

In 2000 Dexter was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to literature

[[Image:KingsCollegeChapel.jpg|thumb|[[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], one of the constituent [[colleges of the University of Cambridge]]]]
A '''college''' ([[Latin]]: ''collegium'') is an [[educational institution]] or a constituent part of an educational institution. Usage varies in English-speaking nations. A college may be a [[academic degree|degree]]-awarding [[tertiary education|tertiary]] [[educational institution]], an institution within a federal university, an institution offering [[vocational education]], or a [[secondary school]].

In the [[United States]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], &quot;college&quot; and &quot;[[university]]&quot; are loosely interchangeable,{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} whereas in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and other [[Commonwealth countries]], &quot;college&quot; may refer to a [[high school]], a college of [[further education]], a training institution that bestows trade qualifications, or a constituent school within a [[university]].

==Etymology==
In [[ancient Rome]] a ''[[collegium (ancient Rome)|collegium]]'' was a club or society, a group of [[person]]s living together, under a common set of [[law|rules]] (''con-'' = &quot;together&quot; + ''leg-'' = &quot;law&quot; or ''lego'' = &quot;I choose&quot;). As well as an educational institution, the term can also refer to any group of colleagues, such as an [[electoral college]], a [[college of arms]] or the [[College of Cardinals]].

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, usage of the word &quot;college&quot; remains the loosest, encompassing a range of institutions:

===Secondary education===
Some secondary schools, both [[state education|state]] (for example, [[Ivybridge Community College]]) and [[Independent school|independent]] (for example, [[Eton College]] or [[Hurstpierpoint College]]), use &quot;college&quot; as part of their name. Some secondary schools in [[Cambridgeshire]] are called [[village college]]s and aim to be centres for the community as well as for their students. In addition, although many state and most independent schools have [[sixth form]]s, some students study for [[Advanced Level in the United Kingdom|A Levels]] at separate [[sixth form college]]s.

===Further education===
A [[further education college]] (FE college) is an institution between [[secondary school]] and [[British universities|university]]. It usually offers a wide range of vocational courses and [[adult education]]. Most students are aged 16-18, but there many mature students taking part in [[adult education]], as well as some 14-16 year olds sent from their schools on a part-time basis for vocational study that the schools are not equipped to deliver. Most FE colleges offer [[A Levels]], often in a sixth-form centre. Some colleges have [[higher education]] provision, normally accredited by a university in the region.

===Higher education===
{{main|Colleges within universities in the United Kingdom}}
In relation to universities, the term ''college'' normally refers to a part of the university which does not have degree-awarding powers in itself. Degrees are always awarded by ''universities'' whereas ''colleges'' are institutions or organizations which prepare students for the degree. Most universities do not have colleges; those that do are referred to as [[collegiate university|collegiate universities]].

In the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge]], [[University of London]] and [[University of the Arts London]] (and formerly in the [[University of Wales]]), colleges prepare students for the degree of the university of which the college is a part (although the colleges of London are now ''de facto'' universities in their own right). In the other collegiate universities, including the [[University of Lancaster]], [[University of York]], [[University of Kent]], [[University of St Andrews]] and [[University of Durham]], the colleges only provide accommodation and pastoral care.

A college may also be an independent institution which prepares students to sit as external candidates at other universities or has the authority to run courses that lead to the degrees of those universities. A [[University college#United Kingdom|university college]] is now an independent higher education institution that has the power to award degrees, but does not have university status, although it is usually working towards it. The term used to refer to colleges set up by universities in other towns, all of which have now been chartered as universities in their own right (for example, the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle]], which was originally a university college of the University of Durham).

&quot;College&quot; may also be a name given to large groupings of [[faculty (university)|faculties]] or departments, notably in the [[University of Edinburgh]], and after recent restructuring, the [[University of Birmingham]] and the [[University of Leicester]].

===Professional bodies===
The [[Royal College of Organists]], the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] and various other [[Royal College]]s are professional associations.

===Law courts===
The [[College of Justice]] refers to the Supreme Courts of Scotland and its associated bodies.

{{main|Higher education in the United States}}

In [[American English]] &quot;college&quot; usually designates [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]] that provide education primarily at the [[undergraduate education|undergraduate level]]. It can also refer to schools which offer a vocational, [[business]], [[engineering]], or technical curriculum. The term can either refer to a self-contained institution that has no [[postgraduate education|graduate]] studies or to the undergraduate school of a full university (i.e., that also has a separate graduate faculty).

In popular usage, the word &quot;college&quot; is the generic term for any post-secondary undergraduate education. Americans go to &quot;college&quot; after high school, regardless of whether the specific institution is formally a college or a university, and the word and its derivatives are the standard terms used to describe the institutions and experiences associated with American post-secondary undergraduate education.

Colleges vary in terms of size, degree, and length of stay. Two-year colleges, also known as [[junior college|junior]] or [[community college]]s, usually offer an [[associate's degree]], and four-year colleges usually offer a [[bachelor's degree]]. Often, these are entirely [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] institutions, although some have [[graduate school]] programs.

Four-year institutions in the U.S. that emphasize a [[liberal arts]] curriculum are known as [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]]; an example of a traditional liberal arts college is pictured to the right, [[Saint Anselm College]]. These schools have traditionally emphasized instruction at the [[undergraduate]] level, although advanced research may still occur at these institutions.

While there is no national standard in the United States, the term &quot;university&quot; primarily designates institutions that provide undergraduate and [[graduate education]]. A [[university]] typically has as its core and its largest internal division an undergraduate college teaching a [[liberal arts]] curriculum, also culminating in a [[bachelor's degree]]. What often distinguishes a university is having, in addition, one or more [[Graduate school]]s engaged in both teaching graduate classes and engaged in research. Often these would be called a School of Law or School of Medicine, (but may also be called a college of law, or a faculty of law, and so on.).

On the other hand, [[public university|public]] and [[private university|private universities]] are typically more research-oriented institutions which service both an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and [[graduate school|graduate]] student body. [[Graduate school|Graduate programs]] may grant a Master of Arts or a variety of [[Master's degree]]s, including [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]]s and [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]]s. The [[doctorate]] is the highest academic degree in the United States, and the [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] is given in many fields. [[Medical school]]s award [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]]s or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]]s while [[law school]]s award the [[Juris Doctor|JD]]. The extent to which graduate programs are integrated with undergraduate studies varies by university and by program. These institutions usually have a large student body. Introductory seminars on the undergraduate level can have a class size in the hundreds in some of the larger schools. Compared to liberal arts colleges, the interaction between students and full-time faculty can be limited and a higher number of undergraduate classes may be taught by [[Teaching assistant|graduate student TAs]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Some institutions, such as [[Dartmouth College]], and [[The College of William &amp; Mary]], have retained the term &quot;college&quot; in their names for historical reasons or because of an undergraduate focus, although they offer higher degrees. And many colleges may offer a Master of Arts degree in some field without a full curriculum leading to a PhD. Some schools that were branded as a &quot;College&quot; do later change its name to &quot;University&quot; ([[Robert Morris University]] being a relatively recent example), but often have to receive state approval before doing so, even if it's a private school. In one unique case, [[Boston College]] and [[Boston University]], both located in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], are completely separate institutions altogether.

Usage of the terms varies among the [[U.S. state|states]], each of which operates its own institutions and licenses private ones. In 1996 for example, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] changed all of its four-year institutions previously designated as colleges to universities, and all of its [[vocation]]al [[technology]] schools to [[Institute of technology|technical college]]s. (Previously, only the four-year [[research]] institutions, apart from the well-established historic exception of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], were called &quot;universities&quot;.) Other states have changed the names of individual colleges, many having started as a [[Normal school|teachers' college]] or [[vocational school]] (such as an A&amp;M &amp;mdash; an [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[mechanics|mechanical]] school) that ended up as a full-fledged [[state university system|state university]].

&quot;University&quot; and &quot;college&quot; do not exhaust all possible titles for an American institution of higher education. Other options include &quot;institute&quot; ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]), &quot;academy&quot; ([[United States Military Academy]]), &quot;union&quot; ([[Cooper Union]]), &quot;conservatory&quot; ([[New England Conservatory]]), and &quot;school&quot; ([[Juilliard School]]), although these titles are only for their official names. In colloquial use, they are still referred to as &quot;college&quot; when referring to their undergraduate studies.

The term ''college'' is also, as in the United Kingdom, used for a constituent semi-autonomous part of a larger university but generally organized on academic rather than residential lines. For example, at many institutions, the undergraduate portion of the university can be briefly referred to as '''the college''' (such as The [[College of the University of Chicago]], [[Harvard College]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], or [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]] at [[Columbia University|Columbia]]) while at others each of the faculties may be called a &quot;college&quot; (the &quot;college of engineering&quot;, the &quot;college of nursing&quot;, and so forth). There exist other variants for historical reasons; for example, [[Duke University]], which was called Trinity College until the 1920s, still calls its main undergraduate subdivision [[Trinity College of Arts and Sciences]]. Some American universities, such as [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Rice University|Rice]], and [[Yale University|Yale]] do have [[residential college]]s along the lines of Oxford or Cambridge, but the name was clearly adopted in homage to the British system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Unlike the Oxbridge colleges, these residential colleges are not autonomous legal entities nor are they typically much involved in education itself, being primarily concerned with room, board, and social life. At the [[University of Michigan]], [[University of California, San Diego]] and the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], however, each of the residential colleges do teach its own core writing courses and has its own distinctive set of graduation requirements.

===The origin of the U.S. usage===
The founders of the first institutions of higher education in the United States were graduates of the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. The small institutions they founded would not have seemed to them like universities &amp;mdash; they were tiny and did not offer the higher degrees in medicine and theology. Furthermore, they were not composed of several small colleges. Instead, the new institutions felt like the Oxford and Cambridge colleges they were used to &amp;mdash; small communities, housing and feeding their students, with instruction from residential tutors (as in the United Kingdom, described above). When the first students came to be graduated, these &quot;colleges&quot; assumed the right to confer degrees upon them, usually with authority—for example, [[The College of William &amp; Mary]] has a [[Royal Charter]] from the British monarchy allowing it to confer degrees while [[Dartmouth College]] has a charter permitting it to award degrees &quot;as are usually granted in either of the universities, or any other college in our realm of Great Britain.&quot;

The leaders of [[Harvard College]] (which granted America's first degrees in 1642) might have thought of their college as the first of many residential colleges which would grow up into a New Cambridge university. However, over time, few new colleges were founded there, and Harvard grew and added higher faculties. Eventually, it changed its title to university, but the term &quot;college&quot; had stuck and &quot;colleges&quot; have arisen across the United States.

In U.S. usage, the word &quot;college&quot; embodies not only a particular type of school, but has historically been used to refer to the general concept of higher education when it is not necessary to specify a school, as in &quot;going to college&quot; or &quot;college savings accounts&quot; offered by banks.

===The Morrill Land-Grant Act===
In addition to private colleges and universities, the U.S. also has a system of government funded, [[public university|public universities]]. Many were founded under the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]] of 1862. When the Morrill Act was established, the original colleges on the east coast, primarily those of the [[Ivy League]] and several religious based colleges, were the only form of higher education available, and were often confined only to the children of the elite. A movement had arisen to bring a form of more practical higher education to the masses, as &quot;…many politicians and educators wanted to make it possible for all young Americans to receive some sort of advanced education.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;enbkii&quot;/&gt; The Morrill Act &quot;…made it possible for the new western states to establish colleges for the citizens.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;enbkii&quot; /&gt; Its goal was to make higher education more easily accessible to the citizenry of the country, specifically to improve agricultural systems by providing training and scholarship in the production and sales of agricultural products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dafvm.msstate.edu/laws/history.html |title=A Land-Grant Institution |publisher=Dafvm.msstate.edu |date=2009-08-11 |accessdate=2009-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to provide formal education in &quot;…agriculture, home economics, mechanical arts, and other professions that seemed practical at the time.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;enbkii&quot;&gt;Lightcap, Brad. [http://www.nd.edu/~rbarger/www7/morrill.html ND.edu The Morrill Act of 1862]&lt;/ref&gt;

The act was eventually extended to allow all states that had remained with the union during the [[American Civil War]], and eventually all states, to establish such institutions. Most of the colleges established under the Morrill Act have since become full universities, and some are among the elite of the world.

===Professional bodies===
Numerous professional bodies in the U.S. also use the appellation &quot;College&quot;. Examples in medicine include the [[American College of Physicians]], the [[American College of Emergency Physicians]], and the [[American College of Surgeons]], in [[osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic medicine]] the [[American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians]] and the [[American College of Osteopathic Internists]], and in dentistry the [[American College of Dentists]] and the [[American College of Prosthodontists]].

==Other English speaking nations==
Influenced by their origins in the [[British Empire]], by contact with and sometimes imitation of U.S. academia, and even by modern American [[popular culture|pop culture]], the rest of the English-speaking world seems to have adopted a mix of the U.S. and British practices.

===Australia===
In Australia, the term &quot;college&quot; has several different, and unrelated, meanings.

* It can refer to an institution of [[tertiary education]] that is smaller than a university, run independently or as part of a university. Following a reform in the 1980s many of the formerly independent colleges now belong to a larger university.
* The term can also be used to refer to parts of a university. In that context there are ''residential colleges'' which provide residence for students, both undergraduate and postgraduate, called [[University college#Australia|university colleges]], as in the United Kingdom. These colleges often provide additional tutorial assistance, and some host [[theology|theological]] study. Many colleges have strong traditions and rituals, so are a combination of dormitory style accommodation and fraternity or sorority culture.
* Less commonly college can refer to a superfaculty organizational unit, as in the [[Australian National University#Colleges|ANU Colleges]].
* Most [[TAFE]]s, which offer certificate and diploma vocational courses, are styled &quot;TAFE colleges&quot; or &quot;Colleges of TAFE&quot;. Some private institutions offering TAFE certificates, university bridging courses, or theological courses of study (i.e. Bible colleges) style themselves &quot;Institutes&quot; or &quot;Colleges&quot;.
* Many private as well as state [[high school]]s that provide [[secondary education]] are called &quot;colleges&quot; in Australia. As secondary education is managed by state authorities rather than nationally, the term's use varies on a regional basis.
* Some professional and registration bodies, especially in the medical arena, which are not educational bodies style themselves a &quot;College&quot; or &quot;Institute&quot;: for example, the [[Royal Australian College of General Practitioners]]. In some cases, they have legal status and members of a profession must obtain and maintain College membership to be allowed to practice.

In [[Tasmania]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]], &quot;college&quot; refers to the final two years of high school (years 11 and 12), and the institutions which provide this. In this context, &quot;college&quot; is a system independent of the other years of high school. Here, the expression is a shorter version of ''matriculation college''.

In the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], most public schools providing secondary education are known as &quot;high school&quot;, though some are referred to as ''secondary colleges''.

In [[Western Australia]], [[South Australia]] and the [[Northern Territory]], &quot;College&quot; is used in the name of all state high schools built since the late 1990s, and in some older ones which have been renamed since that time. The term for the sector, however, is still &quot;high schools&quot;, or in official Government usage, &quot;schools with secondary students&quot;. Many private or independent schools, including many who accept K-7 students, are styled &quot;Colleges&quot;.

In [[New South Wales]], some high schools, especially multi-campus schools resulting from mergers, are known as &quot;secondary colleges&quot;.

In [[Queensland]], the term college is used by some private secondary institutions, although some newer schools which accept primary and high school students are being styled &quot;State College&quot;, whilst schools which offer only secondary education are styled &quot;State High School&quot;.

===Canada===
{{main|College (Canada)}}

In Canada, the term &quot;college&quot; usually refers to a [[Community college#Canada|community college]] or a technical, applied arts, or applied science school. These are [[Tertiary education|post-secondary]] institutions granting [[Academic certificate|certificate]]s, [[diploma]]s, [[associate's degree]], and [[bachelor's degree]]s. In [[Quebec]], the term is seldom used, the equivalent being [[CEGEP]] (''College d'enseignement général et professionnel'', &quot;college of general and professional education&quot;), a form of post-secondary education specific to the [[Education in Quebec|Quebec education system]] that is required to continue onto university (unless one applies as a 'mature' student, meaning 21 years of age or over, and out of the educational system for at least 2 years), or to learn a trade. In [[Ontario]], [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]], there are also institutions which are designated [[university college]]s, as they only grant undergraduate degrees. This is to differentiate between universities, which have both undergraduate and graduate programs and those that do not. In contrast to usage in the United States, there is a strong distinction between &quot;college&quot; and &quot;university&quot; in Canada. In conversation, one specifically would say either &quot;They are going to university&quot; (i.e., studying for a three- or four-year degree at a university) or &quot;They are going to college&quot; (suggesting a technical or career college).

The [[Royal Military College of Canada]], a full-fledged degree-granting university, does not follow the naming convention used by the rest of the country, nor does its sister school [[Royal Military College Saint-Jean]] or the now closed [[Royal Roads Military College]].

The term &quot;college&quot; also applies to distinct entities within a university (usually referred to as &quot;[[federated school|federated colleges]]&quot; or &quot;affiliated colleges&quot;),to the residential colleges in the United Kingdom. These colleges act independently, but in affiliation or federation with the university that actually grants the degrees. For example, [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]] was once an independent institution, but later became federated with the [[University of Toronto]], and is now one of its residential colleges. In the case of [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]], located in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], the [[Corner Brook]] campus is called [[Sir Wilfred Grenfell College]]. Occasionally, &quot;college&quot; refers to a subject specific faculty within a university that, while distinct, are neither ''federated'' nor ''affiliated''—College of Education, College of Medicine, College of Dentistry, College of Biological Science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/cbs/ |title=College of Biological Science &amp;#124; University of Guelph |publisher=Uoguelph.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

There are also universities referred to as art colleges, empowered to grant academic degrees of BFA, Bdes, MFA, Mdes and sometimes collaborative PhD degrees. Some of them have &quot;university&quot; in their name ([[NSCAD University]], [[OCAD University]] and [[Emily Carr University of Art and Design]])and others do not.

In a number of Canadian cities, many government-run secondary schools are called &quot;collegiates&quot; or &quot;collegiate institutes&quot; (C.I.), a complicated form of the word &quot;college&quot; which avoids the usual &quot;post-secondary&quot; connotation. This is because these secondary schools have traditionally focused on academic, rather than vocational, subjects and ability levels (for example, collegiates offered Latin while vocational schools offered technical courses). Some private secondary schools in Toronto (such as [[Upper Canada College]]) choose to use the word &quot;college&quot; in their names nevertheless.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/elemsec/privsch/search.asp Private Elementary and Secondary Schools] search form on the Ministry of Education of Ontario web site—enter &quot;college&quot; in the &quot;name contains&quot; field and check the &quot;secondary&quot; checkbox&lt;/ref&gt; Some secondary schools elsewhere in the country, particularly ones within the [[separate school]] system, may also use the word &quot;college&quot; or &quot;collegiate&quot; in their names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sbinfo.edu.gov.on.ca/schadv.asp Find a School or School Board] search form on the Ministry of Education of Ontario web site—click &quot;Secondary&quot; and &quot;Separate&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

A small number of the oldest professional associations use &quot;college&quot; in the name in the British sense, such as the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]].

A new online and distance education ( e-learning ) use &quot;college&quot; in the name in the British sense, for example : [[Canada Capstone College]].

One use of the term &quot;college&quot; in the American sense is by the [[Canadian Football League]], which calls its annual [[Draft (sports)|entry draft]] the [[Canadian College Draft]]. The draft is restricted to players either born or trained in Canada, but the category includes former players at [[College football|U.S. college football]] programs (&quot;universities&quot; in the Canadian sense) as well as [[CIS football]] programs at Canadian universities.

===Hong Kong===
{{See also|Education in Hong Kong}}

In [[Hong Kong]], the term &quot;college&quot; has a range of meanings, as in the British case. In the first case it can refer to a [[secondary school]]. It is also used by tertiary institutions as either part of their names or to refer to a constituent part of the university, such as the colleges in the collegiate [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]]; or to a residence hall of a university, such as [[St. John's College, University of Hong Kong]]. The term college is also used in the names of professional bodies.

===India===
{{See also|Colleges and institutes in India}}

In India, the term &quot;college&quot; is commonly reserved for institutions that offer degrees at year 12 (&quot;''Junior College''&quot;, similar to American ''high schools''), and those that offer the [[bachelor's degree]]. Generally, colleges are located in different parts of a state and all of them are affiliated to a regional university. The colleges offer programmes under that university. Examinations are conducted by the university at the same time for all colleges under its affiliation. There are several hundred universities and each university has affiliated colleges.

The first liberal arts and sciences college in India was [[C. M. S. College Kottayam]], [[Kerala]] (estd. 1817), and the [[Presidency College, Kolkata]] (estd. 1817), initially known as Hindu College. The first commerce and economics college in India was [[Sydenham College]], [[Mumbai]], which was established in 1913. The first Missionary institution to impart Western style education in India was the [[Scottish Church College, Calcutta]] (estd. 1830). The first modern university in India was the [[University of Calcutta]] (estd. January 1857). The first research institution for the study of the social sciences and ushering the spirit of [[Orient]]al research was the [[Asiatic Society]], (estd. 1784). The first college for the study of Christian theology and ecumenical enquiry was [[Serampore College]] (estd. 1818).

The [[Indian Institutes of Technology]] (IITs), [[Indian Statistical Institute]], [[Indian Institute of Management]], [[Indian Institute of Science]] and [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] are examples of [[autonomous]] institutions in India that award their own degrees.

===Republic of Ireland===
[[File:Trinity college front square cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Parliament Square, [[Trinity College, Dublin]]]]
{{See also|List of universities in the Republic of Ireland}}

In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] the term &quot;college&quot; is usually limited to an institution of [[tertiary education]], but the term is quite generic within this field. University students often say they attend &quot;college&quot; rather than &quot;university&quot;, with the term college being more popular in wider society. This is possibly because, until 1989, no university provided teaching or research directly. Instead, these were offered by a constituent college of the university, in the case of the [[National University of Ireland]] and [[University of Dublin]] &amp;mdash; or at least in strict legal terms. There are many [[secondary education]] institutions that use the word college. Many secondary schools, formerly known as technical colleges, were renamed as community colleges. These are secondary institutions in contrast to the American [[community college]].

The state's only [[ancient university]], the [[University of Dublin]], is really English in its origins and, until recently, its outlook. Created during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], it is modelled on the universities of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. However, only one ''constituent college'' was ever founded, hence the curious position of [[Trinity College, Dublin]] today. For a time, degrees in [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] were also conferred by the university. However, that institution now has its own degree awarding powers and is considering applying for full university status.

Among more modern foundations, the [[National University of Ireland]], founded in 1908, consisted of constituent colleges and recognised colleges until 1997. The former are now referred to as constituent universities &amp;mdash; institutions that are essentially universities in their own right. The National University can trace its existence back to 1850 and the creation of the [[Queen's University of Ireland]] and the creation of the [[Catholic University of Ireland]] in 1854. From 1880, the degree awarding roles of these two universities was taken over by the [[Royal University of Ireland]], which remained until the creation of the National University in 1908 and the [[Queen's University Belfast]].

The state's two new universities [[Dublin City University]] and [[University of Limerick]] were initially [[National Institute for Higher Education]] institutions. These institutions offered university level [[academic degree]]s and [[research]] from the start of their existence and were awarded university status in 1989 in recognition of this. These two universities now follow the general trend of universities having associated colleges offering their degrees.

Third level technical education in the state has been carried out in the [[Institutes of technology in Ireland|Institutes of Technology]], which were established from the 1970s as Regional Technical Colleges. These institutions have ''delegated authority'' which entitles them to give degrees and diplomas from the [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council]] in their own name.

A number of Private Colleges exist such as [[Dublin Business School|DBS]], providing [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] courses validated by [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council|HETAC]] and in some cases by other Universities.

Other types of college include Colleges of Education, such as [[National College of Ireland]]. These are specialist institutions, often linked to a university, which provide both [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] [[academic degree]]s for people who want to train as teachers.

===New Zealand===
[[File:universityofotagoclocktower small.jpg|thumb|right|The [[University of Otago]]]]

In New Zealand the word &quot;college&quot; normally refers to a [[secondary education|secondary]] school for ages 13 to 17. In contrast, most older schools of the same type are &quot;high schools&quot;. Also, single-sex schools are more likely to be &quot;Someplace Boys/Girls High School&quot;, but there are also many coeducational &quot;high schools&quot;. The difference between &quot;high schools&quot; and &quot;colleges&quot; is usually only one of terminology. However, many private or integrated schools are known as &quot;such and such college&quot;. There does seem to be a geographical difference in terminology: &quot;colleges&quot; most frequently appear in the North Island, whereas &quot;high schools&quot; are more common in the South Island.

The constituent colleges of the former [[University of New Zealand]] (such as Canterbury University College) have become independent universities. Some halls of residence associated with New Zealand universities retain the name of &quot;college&quot;, particularly at the [[University of Otago]] (which although brought under the umbrella of the University of New Zealand, already possessed university status and degree awarding powers). The institutions formerly known as &quot;Teacher-training colleges&quot; now style themselves &quot;College of education&quot;.

Some universities, such as the [[University of Canterbury]], have divided their University into constituent administrative &quot;Colleges&quot; - the College of Arts containing departments that teach Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, College of Science containing Science departments, and so on. This is largely modelled on the Cambridge model, discussed above.

Like the United Kingdom some professional bodies in New Zealand style themselves as &quot;colleges&quot;, for example, the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, the R.A.C. of Physicians

===Philippines===
&lt;!-- This specific country section lacks information from the Philippine Provinces. It has a strong bias for Metro Manila. It is overly Metro Manila-centric. Please volunteer to rewrite this specific country section. --&gt;
In the Philippines, colleges usually refer to institutions of learning that grant degrees but whose scholastic fields are not as diverse as that of a university ([[University of the Philippines]], [[Ateneo De Manila University]], [[De La Salle University]], [[University of Santo Tomas]], [[Far Eastern University]]), such as the [[San Beda College]] which specializes in [[law]] and the [[Mapua Institute of Technology]] which specializes in [[engineering]], or to component units within universities that do not grant degrees but rather facilitate the instruction of a particular field, such as a College of Science and College of Engineering, among many other colleges of the [[University of the Philippines]].

A state college may not have the word &quot;college&quot; on its name, but may have several component colleges, or departments. Thus, the Eulogio Amang Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology is a state college by classification.

Usually, the term &quot;college&quot; is also thought of as a hierarchical demarcation between the term &quot;university&quot;, and quite a number of colleges seek to be recognized as universities as a sign of improvement in academic standards ([[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]], [[San Beda College]]), and increase in the diversity of the offered degree programs (called &quot;courses&quot;). For private colleges, this may be done through a survey and evaluation by the Commission on Higher Education and accrediting organizations, as was the case of Urios College which is now the [[Fr. Saturnino Urios University]]. For state colleges, it is usually done by a legislation by the Congress or Senate. In common usage, &quot;going to college&quot; simply means attending school for an undergraduate degree, whether it's from an institution recognized as a college or a university.

===Singapore===
The term &quot;college&quot; in [[Singapore]] is generally only used for pre-university educational institutions called &quot;Junior Colleges&quot;, which provide the final two years of [[secondary education]] (equivalent to sixth form in British terms or grades 11-12 in the American system). Since 1 January 2005, the term also refers to the three campuses of the [[Institute of Technical Education]] with the introduction of the &quot;collegiate system&quot;, in which the three institutions are called [[ITE College East]], [[ITE College Central]], and [[ITE College West]] respectively.

The term &quot;[[university]]&quot; is used to describe higher-education institutions offering locally conferred degrees. Institutions offering diplomas are called &quot;[[Institute of technology|polytechnic]]s&quot;, while other institutions are often referred to as &quot;institutes&quot; and so forth.

===Sri Lanka===
[[File:Royal College Colombo main building.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal College Colombo]]]]
In [[Sri Lanka]] the word &quot;college&quot; (known as ''Vidyalaya'' in ''[[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]'') normally refers to a [[secondary education|secondary]] school, which usually signifies above the 5th standard. During the British colonial period a limited number of exclusive secondary schools were established based on English public school model ([[Royal College Colombo]], [[S. Thomas' College|S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia]], [[Trinity College, Kandy]]) these along with several Catholic schools ([[St. Joseph's College, Colombo]], [[St Anthony's College|St Anthony's College, Kandy]]) traditionally carry their name as colleges. Following the start of free education in 1931 large group of [[Madhya Maha Vidyalayas|central colleges]] were established to educate the rural masses. Since Sri Lanka gained Independence in 1948, many schools that have been established have been named as &quot;college&quot;.

There are several professional and vocational institutions that offer post-secondary education without granting degrees that are referred to as &quot;colleges&quot;. This includes the [[Sri Lanka Law College]], the many Technical Colleges and Teaching Colleges.

===South Africa===
[[File:St Johns College Johannesburg.jpg|thumb|[[St John's College (Johannesburg, South Africa)|St John's College, Johannesburg]]]]

Similar to New Zealand, in South Africa, the word &quot;college&quot; normally refers to a [[secondary education|secondary]] school. Nevertheless, most secondary schools are called &quot;Someplace High (School)&quot;. The word &quot;college&quot; in South Africa generally implies that the school is private. In many cases the high school is exclusive and follows the English public school model. Thus no less than six of South Africa's [[Elite Seven]] high schools call themselves &quot;college&quot; and fit this description. A typical example of this category would be [[St John's College (Johannesburg, South Africa)|St John's College]].

Another category of private high schools also use the &quot;college&quot; term. However, these schools do not follow the English public school model, but rather are more informal in character and specialize in improving children's marks through intensive focus on examination needs. These &quot;colleges&quot; are thus often nicknamed &quot;cram-colleges&quot;

Although the term &quot;college&quot; is hardly used in any context at any university in South Africa, some non-university tertiary institutions call themselves colleges. These include teacher training colleges, business colleges and wildlife management colleges to name a few.

==The non-English-speaking world==
Some languages beyond English use words similar to &quot;college&quot;. (French, for example, has the [[Collège de France]].)

===Belgium===
In Belgium, the term '''college''' is used for some Catholic [[High school|secondary schools]] but not for public secondary schools. Those are usually called &quot;atheneaum&quot; or &quot;institute&quot;.

===Brazil===
[[Image:Mackenzie University (1).jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie]] in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]].]]
In [[Brazil]] the term '''colégio''' (college) is normally used to refer to primary and secondary education institutions and mainly limited to private schools. It is more common to call a primary or secondary [[State school|public school]] '''escola''' (school). '''Colégio''' is never used to refer to tertiary education institutions, which are called either '''universidade''' (university) or '''faculdade''' (faculty or college in US terminology).

===Denmark===
In Denmark ''kollegium'' means [[dormitory]].

However, a few institutions exist that resemble the English colleges. These are Valkendorfs 1589, the [[Regensen]] from 1623, Borchs from 1691, and Elers also from 1691.

===East Asia===
In the [[People's Republic of China]], Japan, South Korea and other East Asian states, colleges and universities are collectively named 大學 or in simplified writing 大学. The meaning of 大學 is clear, but in the case of smaller institutions, the term 學院 (&quot;xueyuan&quot; in Chinese) is often used and, like &quot;college&quot; in English, can refer to either an institution of tertiary or secondary education.

===France===
[[File:College de france.jpg|thumb|Courtyard of the [[Collège de France]]]]

In France, ''collège'' is a [[middle school]] or junior high school that lasts 4 years (from around 11 to 15 years old). The term ''collège'' can, as in English, be used in a generic manner, such as in the term [[electoral college]] or the [[Collège de France]]. This use, though, is not as common.

The term ''Collège universitaire'' (literally ''university college'') used notably by [[Sciences Po Paris]] refers to undergraduate studies. It is also used by the [[University of Manitoba]] to designate its [[Francophone]] university college, [[Collège universitaire de Saint-Boniface]].

===Germany and Austria===
There is a very limited number of higher education institutions in Germany which use the English term college in their names. These are the [[European College of Liberal Arts]] in Berlin, the only German [[liberal arts college]]; the Baltic College, a very small private ''Hochschule'' in the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] which, while no Berufsakademie institution, is specializing in cooperative education; and [[Touro College]] Berlin, a [[Jewish]]-sponsored American college in the German capital which is a [[satellite campus]] of Touro College in New York and additionally obtained state approved recognition in Germany, the German equivalent of US [[regional accreditation]], in December 2006. Undergraduates of Touro College Berlin may graduate with two degrees, an American Bachelor of Science degree, awarded by its parent-institution in New York, and a German Bachelor of Science degree, awarded by Touro College Berlin itself.

In [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] vocational secondary education in the ''[[Education in Germany|Berufsschule]]'' is called called ''Berufskolleg''.

One German [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]], the [[Französisches Gymnasium Berlin]], is also well known under its French name ''Collège Français de Berlin.'' The term ''[[Kolleg]]'' (literally: college) is used in some [[States of Germany|states]] for institutions of [[adult education]] where graduates of a ''Berufsschule'' can graduate with an [[Abitur]].

A ''Graduiertenkolleg'' is a German [[Graduate school]] and a ''Studienkolleg'' is a special university-preparatory school for foreign students whose foreign high school diploma is not recognised to be equivalent to a German Abitur. In the Austrian capital [[Vienna]], there is also a school called ''Polycollege'' which is the oldest [[folk high school]] within that country.

===Greece===
In Greece the term college is mainly used to refer to private secondary education institutions (high schools and junior high schools).

===Hungary===
In Hungary the term '''kollégium''' refers to a [[dormitory]] that may or may not be independent from an educational institution. It can also refer to a university's autonomous student organisation, dedicated to the advanced study of a certain science, topic and so on., for example the &quot;College for Social Theory&quot;.

A ''szakkollégium'' is an upper-level dormitory the student body of which also acts as an autonomous organization.

===Indonesia===
In [[Indonesia]] the term ''kolese'' refers to a school that be organized by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]. For example, [[Kolese Kanisius Jakarta|Kolese Kanisius]], [[Jakarta]].

===Israel===
In [[Israel]] [[tertiary education|tertiary institutions]] accredited to confer a Bachelor's (and in some cases also a Master's) degree, which are not universities, are called Colleges (Hebrew: מכללות‎, Mikhlalot). The primary distinction is that only universities may award [[doctorate|doctorate degree]]s - colleges are teaching-oriented while universities are research-oriented. There are over fifty colleges as well as over twenty teacher training colleges, most of which can award only a [[Bachelor of Education]] (B.Ed.) degree; see [[Michlala|the full list]] of colleges, as well as of [[List of universities and colleges in Israel|universities in Israel]].

===Italy===
In Italy the term ''collegio'', in school context, refers to a particular school (with elite, alternative or stricter education; a ''collegio'' offered by the State to the children of some of its civil employees, or a ''collegio'' related to a military education, is more commonly called ''convitto''), many of these also accommodate their students in lodging.

===Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]], the majority of the private higher educational institutions use the term college or institute. They are allowed to use the name College provided they are registered with Ministry of Higher Education. Under Private Higher Educational Institutions Act 1996. [http://www.mohe.gov.my Ministry Official website]
[[Image:Main Campus.JPG|thumbnail|220px|right|[[Tunku Abdul Rahman College]] is Malaysia's largest college]]

===Netherlands===
In [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] the term ''college'' is sometimes used in the names of institutes of [[secondary education]]. It is also used for classes or lectures at university. It can be used to refer to the [[mayor]] and [[alderman|aldermen]] of a municipality, who form the municipal government.

===Norway===
In Norway the term ''university college'' is used as an official English translation for ''[[University college (Scandinavia)|høgskole]]'' (alternatively spelt ''høyskole'' and ''høgskule''), a term used for independent [[List of universities in Norway|educational institutions]] providing [[tertiary education|tertiary]], but not [[Postgraduate education|quaternary education]]. Similarly to the situation in Germany, Sweden and Denmark, the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] term ''høgskole'' literally means &quot;high school&quot;.
Before you can study at a ''høgskole'' or a university, you must have graduated from the [[videregående skole]], (similar to high school). That means that the common ''høgskole''/university student is 19 years old and above.

===Portugal===
In Portugal a ''colégio'' is usually a private [[primary education]] institution.

===Romania===
In [[Romania]], college is the next step in study after high school (''liceu''). It can be a college that usually lasts two years or University that can last 2, 3, or 4 years depending on the field. Many top high schools have been renamed National College (Colegiul National).

===Spain and Latin America===
In Spain and the Spanish speaking countries of [[Latin America]] the term '''colegio''' (school) refers to either institutions for primary and secondary education or some [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] grouping of people who refer to themselves as a ''colegio'' inasmuch as they are colleagues.

====Spain====
In [[Spain]], a &quot;colegio&quot; usually refers to a primary school.

Traditional Spanish universities such as [[Salamanca]] or [[Valladolid]] were until the 19th century composed of colleges in a similar manner to Oxford and Cambridge. These colleges disappeared after the [[Peninsular War|French Invasion (1808)]], but the word &quot;college&quot; was kept to refer to &quot;residence halls&quot;. Thus, a &quot;colegio mayor&quot; (greater college) within a university refers to a residence hall.

Professional bodies in Spain are called &quot;colegios profesionales&quot; (professional college). Chartered engineers must belong to one of the &quot;Colegio de Ingenieros&quot; (College of Engineers) in the appropriate branch of engineering if they are to be legally entitled to sign engineering projects and legally certify projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;coiim.es&quot;&gt;http://www.coiim.es/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians must belong to the &quot;Colegio de Médicos&quot; (College of Physicians) in order to be able to practice their profession,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icomem.es/&lt;/ref&gt; and architects must belong to the &quot;Colegio de Arquitectos&quot; (College of Architects.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coam.org/&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of lawyers, the [[Bar association|Bar]] is called in this case &quot;Colegio de Abogados&quot; (College of Lawyers); thus, &quot;being called to the Bar&quot; in Spanish is &quot;colegiarse&quot;. This type of professions are called ''collegiated'' professions&quot;, as their practitioners must belong a professional college.

Even where membership of a professional institute is not a legally regulated condition of practice, some university-trained professions also form professional colleges in order to defend their collective interests. This includes the College of Biology, the College of Chemical Engineering, the College of Journalist, the College of Physics, the College of Economists, the College of Sociology, the College of Historians, the College of Mathematicians, the College of Chemistry, and so on. Law prevents non-university-based professions from forming &quot;colleges&quot;; i.e., plumbers are not allowed to form a &quot;College of Plumbers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coiig.com/COIIG/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=346&amp;Itemid=1140&amp;lang=es_ES&lt;/ref&gt;

====South America====
In [[Peru]] the professional organizations that group the [[lawyer]]s of [[Lima]] or the biologists of Peru are called &quot;Colegio de Abogados de Lima&quot; (or College of Lawyers of Lima) and [[Colegio de Biólogos del Perú]]; in [[Colombia]], an example of professional body is the &quot;Colegio Colombiano de Archivistas - CCA&quot;, called in English [[Colombian College of Archivists - CCA]]. In general, however, the word &quot;colegio&quot; refers to elementary to secondary private schools, while the word &quot;escuela&quot; is used to refer to elementary to secondary public schools.

====Puerto Rico====
In [[Puerto Rico]], a unit of the [[University of Puerto Rico]] system is called El Colegio ( the [[University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez]] ) for traditional reasons. The University of Puerto Rico was founded during the American sovereignty. Therefore, the graduates of this unit even at the Ph.D. level are Colegiales.

===Sweden===
In Sweden the term &quot;[[university college]]&quot; is used as an official English translation for ''[[Vocational university|högskola]]'', a term used for independent [[List of universities in Sweden|educational institutions]] providing [[tertiary education|tertiary]], but not [[Postgraduate education|quaternary education]]. The [[Swedish language|Swedish]] term ''högskola'' (that would be literally translated as &quot;high school&quot;) is actually used for a number of institutions which function as specialized [[university|universities]] rather than university colleges, providing quaternary education and conducting [[research]].

===Switzerland===
In some [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of the French speaking part of Switzerland and also on the border to the [[Swiss German]] speaking part (i.e. in [[Fribourg]]) the French term &quot;Collège&quot; (German: Kollegium) is used for middle school or junior high school and sometimes for the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (10th to 13th grade) which lends to the [[matura]]. It is also used as a name for the physical building in which obligatory education takes place (for example,, ''Le Collège de La Planta'').

===Turkey===
In [[Turkey]], the term college (''kolej'' in Turkish) refers to private high schools. The name originates from [[Robert College]], the first American educational institution founded outside the United States. Though founded as a college, the school also had middle and secondary sections over the years after its foundation in 1863. Since 1971, [[Robert College]] has operated as a private high school; however, the term ''[[kolej]]'' (college) is widely used by the private high schools that flourished over the last few decades, as an imitation of foreign schools.

===Vietnam===
In Vietnam a &quot;cao đẳng&quot;, or college, is a higher education institute offering courses that last for 2 years, 2 year shorter than the university &quot;đại học&quot; in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. After graduation from a college, students are awarded a degree. This degree is evaluated below a degree from a university. If necessary, the student with a college degree can transfer to a university and study for a further year or more to graduate from that university. Vietnamese students would rather attend a university than a college. The university enjoys more prestige and popularity than colleges.

&quot;College&quot; may also refer to a school in a university. Vietnam National University, Hanoi has 5 colleges in its divisions.

'''Chalmers University of Technology''' ({{lang-sv|Chalmers tekniska [[högskola]]}}, often shortened to '''Chalmers'''), is a [[List of universities in Sweden|university]] in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]], that focuses on research and education in technology, natural science and architecture. In the latest (2010) [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]], in Engineering and Technology the university was ranked within top 52-75 best universities in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arwu.org/FieldENG2010.jsp|title=Academic Ranking of World Universities in Engineering and Technology - 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the same time by the [[QS World University Rankings]] the university was ranked 204th in the world (overall),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2010|title=QS World University Rankings 2010 (overall)}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranking 76th for Engineering and Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2010/subject-rankings/technology|title=QS World University Rankings 2010: Engineering &amp; Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 120th for the Natural Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2010/subject-rankings/natural-sciences|title=QS World University Rankings 2010: Natural Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2009 International Professional Ranking of Higher Education Institutions, which is established on the basis of the number of alumni holding a post of [[Chief executive officer]] (CEO) or equivalent in one of the [[Fortune Global 500]] companies, Chalmers University of Technology ranked 42nd in the world, ranking 1st in Sweden and 16th in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensmp.fr/Actualites/PR/EMP-ranking.html|title=International Professional Ranking of Higher Education Institutions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The University was founded in 1829 following a donation by [[William Chalmers]] (1748–1811), a director of the [[Swedish East India Company]], whose ships sailed across the world to supply Europe with goods from the East. He donated some of his fortune for the establishment of an &quot;industrial school&quot;. Chalmers was run as a private institution until 1937, when the institute became a state-owned university. In 1994, the school once again became a private institution, owned by a foundation. Chalmers is one of only three universities in Sweden which are named after a person, the other two being [[Karolinska Institutet]] and [[Linnaeus University]].

==Departments==

On January 1, 2005, the old schools were replaced by new departments:

# Applied Information Technology
# Applied Mechanics
# Applied Physics
# Architecture
# Chemical and Biological Engineering
# Civil and Environmental Engineering
# Computer Science and Engineering
# Energy and Environment
# Fundamental Physics
# Materials and Manufacturing Technology
# Mathematical Sciences
# Microtechnology and Nanoscience
# Product and Production Development
# Radio and Space Science
# Shipping and Marine Technology
# Signals and Systems
# Technology Management and Economics

In addition to these, Chalmers is home to six national competence centres in key fields like Mathematical Modelling, Environmental Science and Vehicle Safety ([http://www.chalmers.se/safer/EN/ SAFER]).

==Students==
Approximately 40 per cent of Sweden's graduate engineers and architects are educated at Chalmers. Each year, around 250 post graduate degrees are awarded as well as 850 graduate degrees. About 1,000 post-graduate students attend programmes at the university and many students are taking Master of Science engineering programmes and the Master of Architecture programme. From 2007, all Master's programmes are taught in English for both national and international students. This was a result of the adaptation to the [[Bologna process]] that started in 2004 at Chalmers (as the first technical university in Sweden).
Currently, about 10% of all students at Chalmers come from countries outside Sweden to enroll in a Master's or Ph.D. programme.

[http://www.chalmers.se/en/sections/education/masterprogrammes Previous List of International Masters Programmes at Chalmers] (login now required)

Around 2,700 students also attend Bachelor of Science engineering programmes, merchant marine and other undergraduate courses at [[Chalmers Lindholmen University College|Campus Lindholmen]]. Chalmers also shares some students with Gothenburg University in the joint IT University project. The [[IT University]] focuses exclusively on information technology and offers Bachelor and Master programmes with degrees issued from either Chalmers or Gothenburg University, depending on the programme.

Chalmers confers honorary doctoral degrees to people outside the university who have shown great merit in their research or in society.

In July 2009, Chalmers has announced that it will ban students from Iran and North Korea from admissions into their nuclear programmes due to both countries nuclear threats.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

== Organization ==
Chalmers is an [[aktiebolag]] with 100 shares à 1,000 [[Swedish Krona|SEK]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chalmers.se/en/sections/about_chalmers/chalmers_university/statues Statues of Chalmers University of Technology Foundation, paragraph 3] (this is a translation of the [http://www.chalmers.se/sections/om_chalmers/stiftelsen_chalmers/stadgar swedish text].)&lt;/ref&gt; all of which is owned by a private foundation ([[Chalmers University of Technology Foundation]]) which appoints the university board and the president. The foundation has its members appointed by the Swedish government (4 to 8 seats), the departments appoints one member, the [[Students' union|student union]] appoints one member and the president automatically gains one chair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chalmers.se/en/sections/about_chalmers/chalmers_university/statues Statues of Chalmers University of Technology Foundation, paragraph 5]&lt;/ref&gt; Each department is led by a department head, usually a member of the faculty of that department. The faculty senate represents members of the faculty when decisions are taken.

==Faculty==
{{Empty section|date=June 2008}}

==Campuses==
[[Image:Chalmers University of Technology.jpg|right|250px|the gate of Chalmers(Gibraltar Campus)]]
In 1937, the school moved from the city center to the new Gibraltar Campus, named after the mansion which owned the grounds, where it is now located. The [[Chalmers Lindholmen University College|Lindholmen College Campus]] was created in the early 1990s and is located on the island of [[Hisingen]]. Campus Johanneberg and Campus Lindholmen, as they are now called, are connected by bus line number 16, but there have been numerous complaints that the campuses are too isolated from each other.

==Societies and traditions==
In Chalmers, tradition is taken very seriously. From the pompous graduation ceremony to the for-fun Cortège procession, everything is based on long-standing traditions.

* [[Chalmers Students' Union]]
* Chalmers Aerospace Club  - founded in 1981. In [[Swedish language|Swedish]] frequently also referred to as ''Chalmers rymdgrupp'' (roughly ''Chalmers Space Group''). CAC participated in the [[ESA]] funded CACTEX experiment where the [[thermal conductivity]] of [[alcohol]] at [[zero gravity]] was investigated using a [[sounding rocket]].
* [[Chalmers Ballong Corps]]
* [[Chalmers Computer Society]] - Disbanded in 2008 due to low membership.
* [[CETAC]]
* [[Chalmers Choir]]
* [[Chalmersspexet]] - Amateur theater group which has produced new plays since 1948
* [[The Cortège]]
* [[Chalmers International Reception Committee (CIRC)]]
* [http://www.x-p.nu/ XP]
* [http://pu.chs.chalmers.se/ Chalmers Program Committee - PU]
* [http://css.chs.chalmers.se/ Chalmers Students for Sustainability - CSS] promoting sustainable development among the students and runs projects, campaigns and lectures.
* Föreningen Chalmers Skeppsbyggare, [[Chalmers Naval Architecture Students' Society]] (FCS)

== Ties and partnerships ==
Chalmers has partnerships with major industries mostly in the Gothenburg region such as Ericsson, Volvo and SKF.
The University has general exchange agreements with many European and US universities and maintains a special exchange program agreement with [[National Chiao Tung University]] ([[NCTU]]) in Taiwan where the exchange students from the two universities maintains offices for, among other things, helping local students with applying and preparing for an exchange year as well as acting as representatives ([http://www.europe.nctu.edu.tw/ NCTU Europe - NCTU students at Chalmers], [http://www.asia.chalmers.se/ Chalmers Asia - Chalmers students at NCTU]). It contributes also to the [[Top Industrial Managers for Europe]] (TIME) network.

A close collaboration between the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chalmers and ICVR at ETH Zurich is being established.

==Notable alumni==
* [[Gustaf Dalén]], [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]
* [[Leif Johansson (businessman)|Leif Johansson]], CEO [[Volvo]]
* [[Leif Östling]], CEO [[Scania AB]]
* [[Peter Augustsson]], former CEO [[Saab Automobile]]

[[File:Family-bible.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Christian [[Bible]] as codex]]
A '''codex''' ([[Latin]] ''caudex'' for &quot;trunk of a tree&quot; or ''block of wood'', ''[[book]]''; plural ''codices'') is a book in the format used for modern books, with multiple [[Paper_quire#Quire|quires]] or gatherings (sheets of [[paper]] or [[vellum]] in multiples of two which are folded and stitched through) typically [[Bookbinding|bound]] together and given a cover.

Developed by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] from wooden [[Wax tablet|writing tablets]], its gradual replacement of the [[scroll]], the dominant form of book in the [[Classical antiquity|ancient world]], has been termed the most important advance in the history of the book prior to the invention of [[Printing press|printing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of the codex is often associated with the rise of [[Christianity]], which adopted the format for the [[Bible]] early on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=38−67}}&lt;/ref&gt; First described by the 1st-century AD Roman poet [[Martial]], who praised its convenient use, the codex achieved numerical parity with the scroll around AD 300, and had completely replaced it throughout the now Christianised [[Greco-Roman world]] by the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The codex holds considerable practical advantages over other book formats, such as compactness, sturdiness, ease of reference (a codex is [[random access]], as opposed to a scroll, which is [[sequential access]]), and especially economy; unlike the scroll, both [[recto and verso]] could be used for writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=45−53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the change from rolls to codices roughly coincides with the transition from [[papyrus]] to [[parchment]] as favourite writing material, the two developments are quite unconnected. In fact, any combination of codices and scrolls on the one hand with papyrus and parchment on the other is technically feasible and well attested from the historical record.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although technically any modern [[paperback]] is a codex, the term is now reserved for [[manuscript]] (hand-written) books which were produced from [[Late Antiquity]] through the [[Middle Ages]]. The scholarly study of these manuscripts from the point of view of the [[bookbinding]] craft is called [[codicology]], while the study of ancient documents in general is called [[paleography]].

==History==
[[File:Wachstafel rem.jpg|thumb|Reproduced Roman-style [[wax tablet]], from which the codex evolved]]

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used precursors made of reusable [[Wax tablet|wax-covered tablets of wood]] for taking notes and other informal writings. Two ancient [[polyptych]]s, a ''pentatych'' and ''octotych'', excavated at [[Herculaneum]] employed a unique connecting system that presages later sewing on thongs or cords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carratelli |first=Giovanni Pugliese  |title=&quot;L'instrvmentvm Scriptorivm Nei Monumenti Pompeiani Ed Ercolanesi.&quot; in Pompeiana. Raccolta di studi per il secondo centenario degli di Pompei. |year=1950 |pages=166–78. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the turn of the 1st century CE, a kind of folded parchment notebook called ''pugillares membranei'' in Latin became commonly used for writing in the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=Colin H | last2=Skeat |first2 = TC |title=The Birth of the Codex | year=1983 |publisher=British Academy |location=London |isbn=0197260616 |pages=15–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This term was used by both the pagan poet [[Martial]] and [[Christian]] [[apostle]] [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul the Apostle]]. [[Martial]] used the term with reference to gifts of literature exchanged by Romans during the festival of [[Saturnalia]].  According to T.C. Skeat “…in at least three cases and probably in all, in the form of codices&quot; and he theorized that this form of notebook was invented in Rome and then “…must have spread rapidly to the Near East…”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Skeat |first= T.C. |title=The Collected Biblical Writings of T.C. Skeat. |year=2004 |publisher=E.J. Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=9004139206 |pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his discussion of one of the earliest pagan parchment codices to survive from [[Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt, Eric Turner seems to challenge Skeat’s notion when stating “…its mere existence is evidence that this book form had a prehistory” and that “early experiments with this book form may well have taken place outside of Egypt.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first= Eric |title=The Typology of the Early Codex |year=1977 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press= |location=Philadelhpia |isbn=10: 0812276965 |pages = 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early codices of parchment or papyrus appear to have been widely used as personal notebooks, for instance in recording copies of letters sent (Cicero Fam. 9.26.1). The pages of [[parchment]] notebooks were commonly washed or scraped for re-use, called a [[palimpsest]]; and consequently writings in a codex were considered informal and impermanent.

[[File:Kodeks IV NagHammadi.jpg|thumb|left|Early-Christian Gnostic text from a codex discovered in [[Nag Hammadi]] ([[Egypt]]) in 1945]]

As far back as the early 2nd century, there is evidence that the codex—usually of [[papyrus]]—was the preferred format among [[Christianity|Christians]]: in the library of the [[Villa of the Papyri]], [[Herculaneum]] (buried in AD 79), all the texts (Greek literature) are scrolls; in the [[Nag Hammadi]] &quot;library&quot;, secreted about AD 390, all the texts (Gnostic Christian) are codices.  Despite this comparison, a fragment of a non-Christian parchment Codex of Demosthenes, ''De Falsa Legatione'' from [[Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt demonstrates that the surviving evidence is insufficient to conclude whether Christians played a major, if not central,  role in the development of early codices, or if they simply adopted the format to distinguish themselves from [[Jews]].  The earliest surviving fragments from codices come from Egypt and are variously dated (always tentatively) towards the end of the 1st century or in the first half of the 2nd.  This group includes the [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], containing part of St John's Gospel, and perhaps dating from between 125 and 160.&lt;ref&gt;Turner ''The Typology of the Early Codex'', U Penn 1977, and Roberts &amp; Skeat ''The Birth of the Codex'' (Oxford University 1983). From Robert A Kraft (see link): &quot;A fragment of a Latin parchment codex of an otherwise unknown historical text dating to about 100 CE was also found at Oxyrhynchus (POx 30; see Roberts &amp; Skeat 28). Papyrus fragments of a &quot;Treatise of the Empirical School&quot; dated by its editor to the centuries 1-2 CE is also attested in the Berlin collection (inv. # 9015, Pack\2 # 2355) — Turner, Typology # 389, and Roberts &amp; Skeat 71, call it a &quot;medical manual.&quot;&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western culture#Foundations | Western culture]] the codex gradually replaced the scroll. From the 4th century, when the codex gained wide acceptance, to the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the 8th century, many works that were not converted from scroll to codex were lost to posterity . The codex was an improvement over the scroll in several ways.  It could be opened flat at any page, allowing easier reading; the pages could be written on both front and back ([[recto and verso]]); and the codex, protected within its durable covers, was more compact and easier to transport.

The codex also made it easier to organize documents in a [[library]] because it had a stable spine on which the title of the book could be written. The spine could be used for the [[incipit]], before the concept of a proper title was developed, during medieval times.

Although most early codices were made of [[papyrus]], papyrus was fragile and supplies from Egypt, the only place where papyrus grew and was made into paper, became scanty; the more durable [[parchment]] and [[vellum]] gained favor, despite the cost.

[[File:Florentine Codex IX Aztec Warriors.jpg|thumb|left|Aztec warriors as shown in the [[Florentine Codex]].]]

The codices of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]] had the same form as the European codex, but were instead made with long folded strips of either fig bark ([[amatl]]) or plant fibers, often with a layer of [[whitewash]] applied before writing. [[New World]] codices were written as late as the 16th century (see [[Maya codices]] and [[Aztec codices]]). Those written before the Spanish conquests seem all to have been single long sheets folded [[concertina]]-style, sometimes written on both sides of the local [[amatl]] paper.  So, strictly speaking they are not in codex format, but they more consistently have &quot;Codex&quot; in their usual names than do other types of manuscript.

In the [[Far East]], the scroll remained standard for far longer than in the West. There were intermediate stages, such as scrolls folded [[concertina]]-style and pasted together at the back and books that were printed only on one side of the paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://idp.bl.uk/education/bookbinding/bookbinding.a4d [[International Dunhuang Project]] — Several intermediate Chinese bookbinding forms from the C10th].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jewish]] religion still retains the [[Torah]] scroll, at least for ceremonial use.

==Bookbinding==
Among the experiments of earlier centuries, scrolls were sometimes unrolled horizontally, as a succession of columns. (The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] are a famous example of this format.) This made it possible to fold the scroll as an accordion. The next step was then to cut the [[Folio (printing)|folios]], sew and glue them at their centers, making it easier to use the [[papyrus]] or [[vellum]] [[Recto and verso|recto-verso]] as with a modern book. In traditional bookbinding, these assembled folios trimmed and curved were called &quot;codex&quot; in order to differentiate it from the &quot;case&quot; which we now know as &quot;hard cover&quot;. Binding the codex was clearly a different procedure from binding the &quot;case&quot;. This terminology, still in use some 50 or 60 years ago,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} has been nearly abandoned. Some commercial bookbinders may refer to the cover and the inside of the book instead, but a few others{{Who|date=February 2009}}, attached to their traditions, still use the terms &quot;codex&quot; and &quot;case&quot;.

[[File:New Forest calf.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A calf in the [[New Forest]], [[England]]]]
'''Calves''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|ɑː|v|z}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|v|z}}; singular '''calf''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑː|f}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|f}}) are the young of domestic [[cattle]]. Calves are reared to become adult cattle, or are slaughtered for their meat, called [[veal]].

==Terminology==
&quot;Calf&quot; is the term used from birth to [[weaning]], when it becomes known as a ''weaner'' or ''weaner calf'', though in some areas the term &quot;calf&quot; may be used until the animal is a [[yearling]]. The birth of a calf is known as ''calving''. A calf that has lost its mother is an orphan calf, also known as a ''poddy'' or ''poddy-calf'' in British English. ''Bobby calves'' are young calves which are to be slaughtered for human consumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mac&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= The Macquarie Dictionary |last= |year=1991|publisher= Macquarie Library |location=North Ryde }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''vealer'' is a fat calf weighing less than about {{Convert|330|kg|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} which is at about eight to nine months of age.&lt;ref&gt;The Land, Rural Press, North Richmond, NSW, 7 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A young female calf from birth until she has had a calf of her own is called a ''heifer''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://webster.com/dictionary/heifer| title = Definition of heifer| accessdate = 2006-11-29|author = | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = | year = | month = | work = | publisher = Merriam-Webster| pages = | language =
| archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|f|ər}}). In the [[American Old West]], a motherless or small, runty calf was sometimes referred to as a ''dogie,'' (pronounced with a long &quot;o&quot;)&lt;!--can someone do IPA for that?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=vAr2T4Bh7nkC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=dogie+calf&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yO8jaxSYxy&amp;sig=vx1qnYDnNbpRsJiGRDppFRZd0X8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2x0oSszoFNDflQfek_HWBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5 Cassidy, Frederic Gomes, and  Joan Houston Hall. &quot;dogie&quot;  ''Dictionary of American Regional English''. ISBN 0674205111, 9780674205116 Referenced via Google Books June 4, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; though in the classic traditional folk song, ''Dogie's Lament,'' also known as ''Git along little dogie,'' the &quot;dogies&quot; in question meant cattle strong enough to be herded from Texas to Wyoming, including weaners, yearling steers and other young, non-orphaned animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thekingstontrio.lyrics.info/dogieslament.html Kingston Trio. &quot;Dogie's Lament,&quot; lyrics.  Web page accessed June 4, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;calf&quot; is also used for some other species. See &quot;[[#Other animals|Other animals]]&quot; below.

== Early development==
[[File:Veau nouveau-nébis.jpg|thumb|Newborn calf.]] 
[[File:Embryo transfered calves.JPG|thumb|[[Charolais cattle|Charolais]] calves which were transferred, as embryos, into their [[Angus cattle|Angus]] and Hereford recipient mothers.]] 
Calves may be produced by natural means, or by artificial breeding using [[artificial insemination]] or [[embryo transfer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Friend&quot;&gt;Friend, John B., Cattle of the World, Blandford Press, Dorset, 1978, ISBN 0-7137-0856-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Calves are born after a [[gestation]] of nine months. They usually stand within a few minutes of calving, and suckle within an hour. However, for the first few days they are not easily able to keep up with the rest of the herd, so young calves are often left hidden by their mothers, who visit them several times a day to suckle them. By a week old the calf is able to follow the mother all the time.

Some calves are [[ear tag]]ged soon after birth, especially those that are stud cattle in order to correctly identify their dams (mothers), or in areas (such as the [[European Union|EU]]) where tagging is a legal requirement for cattle. A calf must have the very best of everything until it is at least eight months old if it is to reach its maximum potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Beattie |first= William A. |coauthors= |title= Beef Cattle Breeding &amp; Management |publisher= Popular Books, Frenchs Forest |year= 1990 |month= |isbn= 0-7301-0040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically when the calves are about two months old they are branded, ear marked, castrated and [[vaccinate]]d.

==Calf rearing systems==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}
The ''single suckler'' system of rearing calves is similar to that occurring naturally in wild cattle, where each calf is suckled by its own mother until it is weaned at about nine months old. This system is commonly used for rearing [[beef cattle]] throughout the world.

Cows kept on poor forage (as is typical in [[subsistence farming]]) produce a limited amount of milk. A calf left with such a mother all the time can easily drink all the milk, leaving none for human consumption. For dairy production under such circumstances, the calf's access to the cow must be limited, for example by penning the calf and bringing the mother to it once a day after partly milking her. The small amount of milk available for the calf under such systems may mean that it takes a longer time to rear, and in subsistence farming it is therefore common for cows to calve only in alternate years.

In more intensive [[dairy farming]], cows can easily be bred and fed to produce far more milk than one calf can drink. In the ''multi-suckler'' system, several calves are fostered onto one cow in addition to her own, and these calves' mothers can then be used wholly for milk production. More commonly, calves of dairy cows are reared artificially, being fed formula milk from a bottle or bucket from soon after birth.

Purebred female calves of [[Dairy cattle|dairy cow]]s are reared as replacement dairy cows. Most purebred dairy calves are produced by artificial insemination (AI). By this method each bull can serve very many cows, so only a very few of the purebred dairy male calves are needed to provide bulls for breeding. The remainder of the male calves may be reared for beef or veal; however, some extreme dairy breeds carry so little muscle that rearing the purebred male calves may be uneconomic, and in this case they are often killed soon after birth and disposed of. Only a proportion of purebred heifers are needed to provide replacement cows, so often some of the cows in dairy herds are put to a beef bull to produce crossbred calves suitable for rearing as beef.

Veal calves may be reared entirely on milk formula and killed at about 18 or 20 weeks as &quot;white&quot; veal, or fed on grain and hay and killed at 22 to 35 weeks to produce red or pink veal.

==Growth==
[[File:Vaca.JPG|thumb|[[Ear tag]]ged calf and cow in [[Andorra]].]]
A commercial steer or bull calf is expected to put on about {{Convert|32|to|36|kg|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} per month. A nine-month-old steer or bull is therefore expected to weigh about {{Convert|250|to|270|kg|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}. Heifers will weigh at least {{Convert|200|kg|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} at eight months of age. 

Calves are usually weaned at about eight to nine months of age, depending on the season and condition of the dam, they might be weaned earlier. They may be paddock weaned, often next to their mothers, or weaned in [[stockyards]]. The latter system is preferred by some as it accustoms the weaners to the presence of people and they are trained to take feed other than grass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cole&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Cole B.V.Sc. |first= V.G. |coauthors= |title= Beef Production Guide |publisher= Macarthur Press, Parramatta |year= 1978 |month= |isbn= 0-9599-9731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small numbers may also be weaned with their dams with the use of weaning [[nose ring (animals)|nose ring]]s or nosebands which results in the mothers rejecting the calves' attempts to suckle. Many calves are also weaned when they are taken to the large weaner [[auction]] sales that are conducted in the south eastern states of [[Australia]]. Victoria and [[New South Wales]] have yardings{{clarify|post-text=Please explain yardings|date=April 2011}} of up to 8,000 weaners (calves) for [[auction]] sale in one day.&lt;ref&gt;The Land, 16 April 2009, &quot;CTLX Carcoar Blue Ribbon Weaner Sale&quot;, p. 13, Rural Press, North Richmond&lt;/ref&gt; The best of these weaners may go to the butchers. Others will be purchased by re-stockers to grow out and fatten on grass or as potential breeders. In the [[United States]] these weaners may be known as ''feeders'' and would be placed directly into [[feedlot]]s.

At about 12 months old a beef heifer reaches puberty if she is well grown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cole&quot; /&gt;

==Diseases==
Calves suffer from few congenital abnormalities but the [[Akabane virus]] is widely distributed in [[temperate]] to [[Tropics|tropical]] regions of the world. The virus is a teratogenic pathogen which causes [[abortion]]s, stillbirths, premature births and congenital abnormalities, but occurs only during some years.

==Uses of calves==
Calf meat for [[human]] consumption is called [[veal]]; also eaten are [[calf's brains]] and [[calf liver]]. The [[Hides|hide]] is used to make [[calfskin]]. The fourth compartment of the stomach of slaughtered milk-fed calves is the source of [[rennet]]. The [[intestine]] is used to make [[Goldbeater's skin]], and is the source of [[Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (CIP)]].

Dairy cows can only produce milk after having calved, and so every dairy cow is allowed to produce one calf each year throughout her productive life. On average one of these calves will become a replacement dairy cow, and some of the rest may be reared for beef or veal; however some are effectively produced solely to allow the cow to produce milk.

==Other animals==
{{see also|List of animal names}}
In [[English language|English]] the term &quot;calf&quot; is used by extension for the young of various other large species of [[mammal]]. In addition to other [[Bovinae|cattle]] (such as [[bison]], [[yak]] and [[water buffalo]]), these include the young of [[camel]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[giraffe]]s, [[hippopotamus]]es, larger deer (such as [[moose]], [[elk]] (wapiti) and [[red deer]]), [[rhinoceros]]es, [[whale]]s and larger [[Pinniped|seal]]s.

'''Claude Elwood Shannon''' (April 30, 1916 – February 24, 2001) was an [[United States of America|American]] [[mathematician]], [[electronic engineer]], and [[cryptography|cryptographer]] known as &quot;the father of [[information theory]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell Labs acknowledgement&quot;&gt;[http://www.bell-labs.com/news/2006/october/shannon.html Bell Labs website: &quot;For example, Claude Shannon, the father of Information Theory, had a passion...&quot; ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon is famous for having founded information theory with one landmark paper published in 1948. But he is also credited with founding both [[digital computer]] and [[digital circuit]] design theory in 1937, when, as a 21-year-old master's student at [[MIT]], he wrote a [[thesis or dissertation|thesis]] demonstrating that electrical application of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] could construct and resolve any logical, numerical relationship. It has been claimed that this was the most important master's thesis of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortune&quot;&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0809046377 Poundstone, William: ''Fortune's Formula : The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System That Beat the Casinos and Wall Street'']&lt;/ref&gt; Shannon contributed to the field of [[cryptanalysis]] during [[World War II]] and afterwards, including basic work on code breaking.

==Biography==

Shannon was born in [[Petoskey, Michigan]]. His father, Claude Sr (1862–1934), a descendant of early [[New Jersey]] settlers, was a self-made businessman and for a while, Judge of [[Probate]]. His mother, Mabel Wolf Shannon (1890–1945), daughter of German immigrants, was a language teacher and for a number of years principal of [[Gaylord High School]], Michigan. The first 16 years of Shannon's life were spent in [[Gaylord, Michigan]], where he attended public school, graduating from Gaylord High School in 1932. Shannon showed an inclination towards mechanical things. His best subjects were science and mathematics, and at home he constructed such devices as models of planes, a radio-controlled model boat and a [[telegraph]] system to a friend's house half a mile away. While growing up, he worked as a messenger for [[Western Union]]. His childhood hero was [[Thomas Edison]], who he later learned was a distant cousin. Both were descendants of [[John Ogden]], a colonial leader and an ancestor of many distinguished people.&lt;ref name=&quot;MIT obituary&quot;&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2001/shannon.html MIT Professor Claude Shannon dies; was founder of digital communications], MIT - News office, Cambridge, Massachusetts, February 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;CLAUDE ELWOOD SHANNON, Collected Papers&quot;&gt;CLAUDE ELWOOD SHANNON, Collected Papers, Edited by N.J.A Sloane and Aaron D. Wyner, IEEE press, ISBN 0-7803-0434-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boolean theory===

In 1932 he entered the [[University of Michigan]], where he took a course that introduced him to the works of [[George Boole]]. He graduated in 1936 with two [[bachelor's degree]]s, one in [[electrical engineering]] and one in [[mathematics]], then began graduate study at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), where he worked on [[Vannevar Bush]]'s [[differential analyzer]], an [[analog computer]].

While studying the complicated ad hoc circuits of the differential analyzer, Shannon saw that Boole's concepts could be used to great utility. A paper drawn from his 1937 master's [[thesis]], ''[[A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Claude Shannon, [http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/11173/34541425.pdf?sequence=1 &quot;A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits,&quot;] unpublished MS Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Aug. 10, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in the 1938 issue of the ''[[Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers]]''. It also earned Shannon the &lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT CONFUSE WITH THE NOBEL PRIZE --&gt;[[Alfred Noble Prize|Alfred Noble American Institute of American Engineers Award]] in 1940. [[Howard Gardner]], of [[Harvard University]], called Shannon's thesis &quot;possibly the most important, and also the most famous, master's thesis of the century.&quot;

[[Victor Shestakov]], at Moscow State University, had proposed a theory of electric switches based on Boolean logic earlier than Shannon, in 1935, but the first publication of Shestakov's result took place in 1941, after the publication of Shannon's thesis.

In this work, Shannon proved that [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] and [[binary arithmetic]] could be used to simplify the arrangement of the electromechanical [[relay]]s then used in telephone routing switches, then expanded the concept and also proved that it should be possible to use arrangements of relays to solve Boolean algebra problems. Exploiting this property of electrical switches to do logic is the basic concept that underlies all electronic digital computers. Shannon's work became the foundation of practical [[digital circuit]] design when it became widely known among the electrical engineering community during and after [[World War II]]. The theoretical [[rigor]] of Shannon's work completely replaced the ''ad hoc'' methods that had previously prevailed.

Flush with this success, Vannevar Bush suggested that Shannon work on his dissertation at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]], funded by the Carnegie Institution headed by Bush, to develop similar mathematical relationships for [[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] [[genetics]], which resulted in Shannon's 1940 [[PhD]] thesis at MIT, ''[[An Algebra for Theoretical Genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;C. E. Shannon, &quot;An algebra for theoretical genetics&quot;, (Ph.D. Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1940), MIT-THESES//1940–3 [http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/11174 Online text at MIT]&lt;/ref&gt;''

In 1940, Shannon became a National Research Fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, New Jersey. At Princeton, Shannon had the opportunity to discuss his ideas with influential scientists and mathematicians such as [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[John von Neumann]], and even had the occasional encounter with [[Albert Einstein]]. Shannon worked freely across disciplines, and began to shape the ideas that would become information theory.&lt;ref&gt;Erico Marui Guizzo, “The Essential Message: Claude Shannon and the Making of Information Theory” (M.S. Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Humanities, Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies, 2003), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime research===

Shannon then joined [[Bell Labs]] to work on [[fire-control system]]s and [[cryptography]] during World War II, under a contract with section D-2 (Control Systems section) of the National Defense Research Committee ([[National Defense Research Committee|NDRC]]).

For two months early in 1943, Shannon came into contact with the leading British cryptanalyst and mathematician [[Alan Turing]]. Turing had been posted to Washington to share with the US Navy's cryptanalytic service the methods used by the [[Government Communications Headquarters|British Government Code and Cypher School]] at [[Bletchley Park]] to break the ciphers used by the German U-boats in the North Atlantic.&lt;ref name=Hodges1992&gt;{{Citation | last = Hodges | first = Andrew | author-link = Andrew Hodges | year = 1992 | title = Alan Turing: The Enigma | publication-place = London | publisher = Vintage | pages = 243–252 | isbn = 978-0099116417}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also interested in the encipherment of speech and to this end spent time at Bell Labs. Shannon and Turing met at teatime in the cafeteria.&lt;ref name=Hodges1992/&gt;  Private archives from Bell Labs suggest that a Visual Binary encoding system was developed via their collaboration at this time.

[[File:Visual Binary.jpg]]

Turing showed Shannon his seminal 1936 paper that defined what is now known as the &quot;[[Universal Turing machine]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last= Turing | first= A.M. | publication-date = 1937 | year = 1936 | title = On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem | periodical = Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society | series = 2 | volume = 42 | pages = 230–65 | doi= 10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Turing | first = A.M. | publication-date = 1937 | title = On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem: A correction | periodical = Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society | series = 2 | volume = 43 | pages = 544–6 | doi = 10.1112/plms/s2-43.6.544 | year = 1938 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which impressed him, as many of its ideas were complementary to his own.

In 1945, as the war was coming to an end, the NDRC was issuing a summary of technical reports as a last step prior to its eventual closing down. Inside the volume on fire control a special essay titled ''Data Smoothing and Prediction in Fire-Control Systems'', coauthored by Shannon, [[Ralph Beebe Blackman]], and [[Hendrik Wade Bode]], formally treated the problem of smoothing the data in fire-control by analogy with &quot;the problem of separating a signal from interfering noise in communications systems.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David A. Mindell, ''Between Human and Machine: Feedback, Control, and Computing Before Cybernetics'', (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), 2004, pp. 319-320. ISBN 0-8018-8057-2.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words it modeled the problem in terms of [[Data processing|data]] and [[signal processing]] and thus heralded the coming of the [[information age]].

His work on cryptography was even more closely related to his later publications on [[communication theory]].&lt;ref&gt;David Kahn, ''The Codebreakers'', rev. ed., (New York: Simon and Schuster), 1996, pp. 743-751. ISBN 0-684-83130-9.&lt;/ref&gt; At the close of the war, he prepared a classified memorandum for Bell Telephone Labs entitled &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography,&quot; dated September, 1945. A declassified version of this paper was subsequently published in 1949 as &quot;[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]&quot; in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]''. This paper incorporated many of the concepts and mathematical formulations that also appeared in his ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]''. Shannon said that his wartime insights into communication theory and cryptography developed simultaneously and &quot;they were so close together you couldn’t separate them&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Kahn, ''The Codebreakers'', p. 744.&lt;/ref&gt; In a footnote near the beginning of the classified report, Shannon announced his intention to &quot;develop these results ... in a forthcoming memorandum on the transmission of information.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Erico Marui Guizzo, [http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/39429/1/54526133.pdf &quot;The Essential Message: Claude Shannon and the Making of Information Theory,&quot;] unpublished MS thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2003, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Bell Labs, he proved that the [[one-time pad]] is unbreakable in his [[World War II]] research that was later published in October 1949. He also proved that any unbreakable system must have essentially the same characteristics as the one-time pad: the key must be truly random, as large as the plaintext, never reused in whole or part, and kept secret.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, Claude (1949). &quot;Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems&quot;. Bell System Technical Journal 28 (4): 656–715.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar contributions===

In 1948 the promised memorandum appeared as &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot;, an article in two parts in the July and October issues of the ''Bell System Technical Journal''. This work focuses on the problem of how best to encode the [[information]] a sender wants to transmit. In this fundamental work he used tools in probability theory, developed by [[Norbert Wiener]], which were in their nascent stages of being applied to communication theory at that time. Shannon developed [[information entropy]] as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of [[information theory]].

The book, co-authored with [[Warren Weaver]], ''The Mathematical Theory of Communication'', reprints Shannon's 1948 article and Weaver's popularization of it, which is accessible to the non-specialist. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in [[John Robinson Pierce]]'s ''Symbols, Signals, and Noise''.

Information theory's fundamental contribution to [[natural language processing]] and [[computational linguistics]] was further established in 1951, in his article &quot;Prediction and Entropy of Printed English&quot;, proving that treating [[Whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]] as the 27th letter of the alphabet actually lowers uncertainty in written language, providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.

Another notable paper published in 1949 is &quot;[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]&quot;, a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of [[cryptography]], in which he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the [[one-time pad]]. He is also credited with the introduction of [[Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem|sampling theory]], which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later.

He returned to MIT to hold an endowed chair in 1956.

===Hobbies and inventions===

Outside of his academic pursuits, Shannon was interested in [[juggling]], [[unicycling]], and [[chess]]. He also invented many devices, including rocket-powered [[flying disc]]s, a motorized [[pogo stick]], and a flame-throwing trumpet for a science exhibition{{Citation needed|reason=Septober 2010|date=January 2010}}. One of his more humorous devices was a box kept on his desk called the &quot;Ultimate Machine&quot;, based on an idea by [[Marvin Minsky]]. Otherwise featureless, the box possessed a single switch on its side. When the switch was flipped, the lid of the box opened and a mechanical hand reached out, flipped off the switch, then retracted back inside the box. Renewed interest in the &quot;Ultimate Machine&quot; has emerged on [[YouTube]] and [[MakerBot Industries|Thingiverse]]. In addition he built a device that could solve the [[Rubik's cube]] puzzle.&lt;ref name=&quot;MIT obituary&quot; /&gt;

He is also considered the co-inventor of the first [[wearable computer]] along with [[Edward O. Thorp]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wearable computer&quot;&gt;[http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/graphics/courses/mobwear/resources/thorp-iswc98.pdf The Invention of the First Wearable Computer Online paper by Edward O. Thorp of Edward O. Thorp &amp; Associates]&lt;/ref&gt; The device was used to improve the odds when playing [[roulette]].

===Legacy and tributes===

Shannon came to MIT in 1956 to join its faculty and to conduct work in the [[Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT|Research Laboratory of Electronics]] (RLE). He continued to serve on the MIT faculty until 1978. To commemorate his achievements, there were celebrations of his work in 2001, and there are currently six statues of Shannon sculpted by [[Eugene L. Daub]]: one at the [[University of Michigan]]; one at MIT in the [[MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems|Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems]]; one in Gaylord, Michigan; one at the [[University of California, San Diego]]; one at [[Bell Labs]]; and another at [[AT&amp;T Laboratories|AT&amp;T Shannon Labs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eecs.umich.edu/shannonstatue/ Shannon Statue Dedications]&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Bell System divestiture|breakup]] of the Bell system, the part of Bell Labs that remained with [[AT&amp;T]] was named Shannon Labs in his honor.

[[Robert G. Gallager|Robert Gallager]] has called Shannon the greatest scientist of the 20th century. According to [[Neil Sloane]], an [[AT&amp;T Fellow]] who co-edited Shannon's large collection of papers in 1993, the perspective introduced by Shannon's [[communication theory]] (now called [[information theory]]) is the foundation of the digital revolution, and every device containing a [[microprocessor]] or [[microcontroller]] is a conceptual descendant of Shannon's 1948 publication:&lt;ref name=&quot;shannon paper&quot;&gt;C. E. Shannon: ''A mathematical theory of communication.'' Bell System Technical Journal, vol. 27, pp. 379–423 and 623–656, July and October, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;He's one of the great men of the century. Without him, none of the things we know today would exist. The whole [[digital revolution]] started with him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;star ledger&quot;&gt;Bell Labs digital guru dead at 84 — Pioneer scientist led high-tech revolution (''[[Star-Ledger|The Star-Ledger]]'', obituary by Kevin Coughlin 27 February 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon developed [[Alzheimer's disease]], and spent his last few years in a Massachusetts nursing home. He was survived by his wife, Mary Elizabeth Moore Shannon; a son, Andrew Moore Shannon; a daughter, Margarita Shannon; a sister, Catherine S. Kay; and two granddaughters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Shannon.html Shannon, Claude Elwood (1916-2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thocp.net/biographies/shannon_claude.htm Claude Elwood Shannon April 30, 1916]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon was oblivious to the marvels of the digital revolution because his mind was ravaged by [[Alzheimer's disease]]. His wife mentioned in his obituary that had it not been for Alzheimer's &quot;he would have been bemused&quot; by it all.&lt;ref name=&quot;star ledger&quot; /&gt;

==Other work==

[[Image:Shannonmouse.PNG|thumb|Shannon and his famous [[electromechanical]] mouse ''Theseus'' (named after [[Theseus]] from Greek mythology) which he tried to have solve the maze in one of the first experiments in [[artificial intelligence]]]]

=== Shannon's mouse ===

Theseus, created in 1950, was a magnetic mouse controlled by a relay circuit that enabled it to move around a [[maze]] of 25 squares. Its dimensions were the same as an average mouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell Labs acknowledgement&quot;/&gt; The maze configuration was flexible and it could be modified at will.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell Labs acknowledgement&quot;/&gt; The mouse was designed to search through the corridors until it found the target. Having travelled through the maze, the mouse would then be placed anywhere it had been before and because of its prior experience it could go directly to the target. If placed in unfamiliar territory, it was programmed to search until it reached a known location and then it would proceed to the target, adding the new knowledge to its memory thus learning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell Labs acknowledgement&quot;/&gt; Shannon's mouse appears to have been the first learning device of its kind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell Labs acknowledgement&quot;/&gt;

=== Shannon's computer chess program ===

In 1950 Shannon published a groundbreaking paper on [[computer chess]] entitled ''Programming a Computer for Playing Chess''. It describes how a machine or computer could be made to play a reasonable game of [[chess]]. His process for having the computer decide on which move to make is a [[minimax]] procedure, based on an [[evaluation function]] of a given chess position. Shannon gave a rough example of an evaluation function in which the value of the black position was subtracted from that of the white position. ''Material'' was counted according to the usual relative [[chess piece relative value]] (1 point for a pawn, 3 points for a knight or bishop, 5 points for a rook, and 9 points for a queen).&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered some positional factors, subtracting ½ point for each [[doubled pawn]]s, [[backward pawn]], and [[isolated pawn]]. Another positional factor in the evaluation function was ''[[mobility (chess)|mobility]]'', adding 0.1 point for each legal move available. Finally, he considered [[checkmate]] to be the capture of the king, and gave the king the artificial value of 200 points. Quoting from the paper:

:''The coefficients .5 and .1 are merely the writer's rough estimate. Furthermore, there are many other terms that should be included. The formula is given only for illustrative purposes. Checkmate has been artificially included here by giving the king the large value 200 (anything greater than the maximum of all other terms would do).''

The evaluation function is clearly for illustrative purposes, as Shannon stated. For example, according to the function, pawns that are doubled as well as isolated would have no value at all, which is clearly unrealistic.

=== The Las Vegas connection: information theory and its applications to game theory ===

Shannon and his wife Betty also used to go on weekends to [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]] with [[M.I.T.]] mathematician [[Edward O. Thorp|Ed Thorp]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Elwyn article&quot;&gt;[http://www.americanscientist.org/template/BookReviewTypeDetail/assetid/47321;jsessionid=aaa9har2OmrE7K American Scientist online: Bettor Math, article and book review by Elwyn Berlekamp]&lt;/ref&gt; and made very successful forays in [[blackjack]] using [[game theory]] type methods co-developed with fellow Bell Labs associate, physicist [[John Larry Kelly, Jr|John L. Kelly Jr.]] based on principles of information theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;John L. Kelly&quot;&gt;[http://home.williampoundstone.net/Kelly.htm John Kelly by William Poundstone website]&lt;/ref&gt; They made a fortune, as detailed in the book ''Fortune's Formula'' by [[William Poundstone]] and corroborated by the writings of [[Elwyn Berlekamp]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Elwyn bio&quot;&gt;[http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AuthorDetail/authorid/1554 Elwyn Berlekamp (Kelly's Research Assistant) Bio details]&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly's research assistant in 1960 and 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortune&quot;/&gt; Shannon and Thorp also applied the same theory, later known as the ''[[Kelly criterion]]'', to the stock market with even better results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poundstone&quot;&gt;[http://home.williampoundstone.net/ William Poundstone website]&lt;/ref&gt; Over the decades, Kelly's scientific formula has become a part of mainstream investment theory&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook of Asset and Liability Management&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Zenios |first=S. A. |last2=Ziemba |first2=W. T. |title=Handbook of Asset and Liability Management |year=2006 |publisher=North Holland |location= |isbn=978-0444508751 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most prominent users, well-known and successful billionaire investors [[Warren Buffett]],&lt;ref name=&quot;The Dhandho Investor&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Pabrai |first=Mohnish |title=The Dhandho Investor: The Low-Risk Value Method to High Returns |year=2007 |publisher=Wiley |location= |isbn=978-0470043899}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ed Thorp's Genius Detailed In Scott Patterson's The Quants&quot;&gt;[http://www.gurufocus.com/news.php?id=83664 &quot;Ed Thorp's Genius Detailed In Scott Patterson's ''The Quants''&quot;], book review by Bill Freehling for gurufocus.com, February 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[William H. Gross|Bill Gross]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilmott II&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Thorp |first=E. O. |title=The Kelly Criterion: Part II |month=September |year=2008 |journal=Wilmott Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]] use Kelly methods. Warren Buffett met Thorp the first time in 1968. It's said that Buffett uses a form of the Kelly criterion in deciding how much money to put into various holdings. Also [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] had applied the same logical algorithm for [[Axcom Trading Advisors]], an alternative investment management company, that he had founded. Berlekmap's company was acquired by [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]] and his [[Renaissance Technologies Corp]] hedge fund in 1992, whereafter its investment instruments were either subsumed into (or essentially renamed as) Renaissance's flagship [[Medallion Fund]].
But as Kelly's original paper demonstrates, the criterion is only valid when the investment or &quot;game&quot; is played many times over, with the same probability of winning or losing each time, and the same payout ratio.&lt;ref name=&quot;original Kelly article&quot;&gt;J. L. Kelly, Jr, &lt;cite&gt;A New Interpretation of Information Rate&lt;/cite&gt;, Bell System Technical Journal, 35, (1956), 917–926&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory was also exploited by the famous ''[[MIT Blackjack Team]]'', which was a group of students and ex-students from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Harvard Business School]], [[Harvard University]], and other leading colleges who used [[Card counting|card-counting]] techniques and other sophisticated strategies to beat casinos at [[blackjack]] worldwide. The team and its successors operated successfully from 1979 through the beginning of the 21st century. Many other blackjack teams have been formed around the world with the goal of beating the casinos. 

Claude Shannon's card count techniques were explained in ''[[Bringing Down the House (book)|Bringing Down the House]]'', the best-selling book published in 2003 about the [[MIT Blackjack Team]] by [[Ben Mezrich]]. In 2008 the book was adapted into a [[drama film]] titled ''[[21 (2008 film)|21]]''.

=== Shannon's maxim ===

Shannon formulated a version of [[Kerckhoffs' principle]] as &quot;the enemy knows the system&quot;. In this form it is known as &quot;Shannon's maxim&quot;.

===Biographical notes===

He met his wife Betty when she was a numerical analyst at [[Bell Labs]].

[[File:Stonehenge Summer Solstice eve 02.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[community of interest]] gathers at [[Stonehenge]], England, for the summer solstice.]]

In biological terms, a '''community''' is a group of [[interacting]] [[organisms]]
sharing a populated [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].
In [[human]] communities, [[intention|intent]], [[belief]], [[Natural resource|resources]], [[preference]]s, [[Need assessment|needs]], [[risk]]s, and a number of other conditions may be present and common, affecting the [[Identity (social science)|identity]] of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness.

In [[sociology]], the concept of community has led to significant debate, and [[sociologists]] are yet to reach agreement on a definition of the term. There were ninety-four discrete definitions of the term by the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Hillery, George A., Jr., &quot;Definitions of Community: Areas of Agreement,&quot; Rural Sociology, 20 (4), 1955, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally a &quot;community&quot; has been defined as a [[Group (sociology)|group]] of interacting people living in a common location. The word is often used to refer to a group that is organized around common values and is attributed with [[social cohesion]] within a shared geographical location, generally in social units larger than a [[household]]. The word can also refer to the [[Nation|national community]] or [[international community]].

The word &quot;community&quot; is derived from the [[Old French]] ''communité'' which is derived from the [[Latin]] ''communitas'' (''cum'', &quot;with/together&quot; + ''munus'', &quot;gift&quot;), a broad term for fellowship or organized society.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;community, n.&quot; OED Online. July 2009. [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50045241 Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the advent of the [[Internet]], the concept of community no longer has geographical limitations, as people can now virtually gather in an online community and share common interests regardless of physical location.

==Perspectives from various disciplines==
===Sociology===
{{sociology}}

====Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft====
{{Main|Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft}}
German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] distinguished between two types of human association: ''[[Gemeinschaft]]'' (usually translated as &quot;community&quot;) and ''[[Gesellschaft]]'' (&quot;society&quot; or &quot;association&quot;). In his 1887 work, ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', Tönnies argued that ''Gemeinschaft'' is perceived to be a tighter and more cohesive social entity, due to the presence of a &quot;unity of will.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tönnies, F. 1887. ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that [[family]] and [[kinship]] were the perfect expressions of ''Gemeinschaft'', but that other shared characteristics, such as place or belief, could also result in ''Gemeinschaft''. This paradigm of communal networks and shared social understanding has been applied to multiple cultures in many places throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Messing, A. (2009). Panxenos: An outsider's sociology of self. ''Human Architecture'' 7.3, pp. 155-172. [http://www.okcir.com/Articles%20VII%203/Messing-FM.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gesellschaft'', on the other hand, is a group in which the individuals who make up that group are motivated to take part in the group purely by [[Selfishness|self-interest]]. He also proposed that in the real world, no group was either pure ''Gemeinschaft'' or pure ''Gesellschaft,'' but, rather, a mixture of the two.

====Social capital====
{{Main|Social capital}}
If community exists, both freedom and security may exist as well. The community then takes on a life of its own, as people become free enough to share and secure enough to get along. The sense of connectedness and formation of social networks comprise what has become known as [[social capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, D. 2000. ''Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of the American Community,'' p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social capital is defined by [[Robert D. Putnam]] as &quot;the collective value of all [[social networks]] and species (who people know) and the inclinations that arise from these works to do things for each other (norms of reciprocity).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/saguaro/primer.htm |title=SAGUARO SEMINAR - Civic Engagement in America |publisher=Hks.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080502020439/http://www.hks.harvard.edu/saguaro/primer.htm |archivedate = May 2, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social capital in action can be seen in all sorts of groups, including neighbors keeping an eye on each others' homes. However, as Putnam notes in ''[[Bowling Alone|Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community]]'' (2000), social capital has been falling in the United States. Putnam found that over the past 25 years, attendance at club meetings has fallen 58 percent, family dinners are down 33 percent, and having friends visit has fallen 45 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bowlingalone.com/ |title=''Bowling Alone'' web site |publisher=Bowlingalone.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same patterns are also evident in many other western countries. [[Western world|Western]] [[cultures]] are thus said to be losing the spirit of community that once were found in [[institutions]] including [[church (building)|churches]] and [[Community centre|community centers]]. [[Sociologist]] [[Ray Oldenburg]] states in ''[[The Great Good Place (Oldenburg)|The Great Good Place]]'' that people need three places: 1) the [[home]], 2) the [[office]], and, 3) the community hangout or [[gathering place]].&lt;ref&gt;Project for Public Spaces. 2006. [http://www.pps.org/info/placemakingtools/placemakers/roldenburg Ray Oldenburg].&lt;/ref&gt; With this philosophy in mind, many [[grassroots]] efforts such as The [[Project for Public Spaces]] are being started to create this &quot;[[Third Place]]&quot; in communities. They are taking form in independent bookstores, coffeehouses, local pubs, and through many innovative means to create the social capital needed to foster the sense and spirit of community.&lt;ref&gt;University of Florida. 2006. [http://usfcollab.usf.edu/PDF/socialcapital.pdf Social Capital in Tampa Bay: An Update Report].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
====Community====
{{Main|Sense of community}}
[[File:Bigdayout crowd2.jpg|thumb|To what extent do participants in joint activities experience a [[sense of community]]?]]
In a seminal 1986 study, McMillan and Chavis identify four elements of &quot;sense of community&quot;: 1) membership, 2) influence, 3) integration and fulfillment of needs, and 4) shared emotional connection. They give the following example of the interplay between these factors:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Someone puts an announcement on the dormitory bulletin board about the formation of an intramural dormitory basketball team. People attend the organizational meeting as strangers out of their individual needs (integration and fulfillment of needs). The team is bound by place of residence (membership boundaries are set) and spends time together in practice (the contact hypothesis). They play a game and win (successful shared valent event). While playing, members exert energy on behalf of the team (personal investment in the group). As the team continues to win, team members become recognized and congratulated (gaining honor and status for being members), Influencing new members to join and continue to do the same. Someone suggests that they all buy matching shirts and shoes (common symbols) and they do so (influence).&lt;ref&gt;McMillan, D.W., &amp; Chavis, D.M. 1986. &quot;Sense of community: A definition and theory,&quot; p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A ''Sense of Community Index'' (SCI) has been developed by Chavis and colleagues and revised and adapted by others. Although originally designed to assess sense of community in neighborhoods, the index has been adapted for use in schools, the workplace, and a variety of types of communities.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, D.D., Florin, P., Rich, R.C., Wandersman, A. &amp; Chavis, D.M. (1990). Participation and the social and physical environment of residential blocks: Crime and community context. ''American Journal of Community Psychology, 18'', 83-115. Chipuer, H. M., &amp; Pretty, G. M. H. (1999). A review of the Sense of Community Index: Current uses, factor structure, reliability, and further development. ''Journal of Community Psychology, 27''(6), 643-658. Long, D.A., &amp; Perkins, D.D. (2003). Confirmatory Factor Analysis of the Sense of Community Index and Development of a Brief SCI. ''Journal of Community Psychology, 31'', 279-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies conducted by the APPA show substantial evidence that young adults who feel a sense of belonging in a community, particularly small communities, develop fewer psychiatric and depressive disorders than those who do not have the feeling of love and belonging.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===Anthropology===
[[Cultural anthropology|Cultural]] (or [[social anthropology|social]]) anthropology has traditionally looked at community through the lens of [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] fieldwork and ethnography continues to be an important methodology for study of modern communities. Other anthropological approaches that deal with various aspects of community include [[cross-cultural studies]] and the [[anthropology of religion]]. Cultures in modern society are also studied in the fields of [[urban anthropology]], [[ethnic studies]], [[ecological anthropology]], and [[psychological anthropology]]. Since the 1990s, internet communities have increasingly been the subject of research in the emerging field of [[cyber anthropology]].

====Archaeology====
[[Archaeology|Archaeological studies]] of social communities. The term “community” is used in two ways in archaeology, paralleling usage in other areas. The first is an informal definition of community as a place where people used to live. In this sense it is synonymous with the concept of an ancient [[Human settlement|settlement]], whether a [[hamlet (place)| hamlet]], [[village]], [[town]], or [[city]]. The second meaning is similar to the usage of the term in other [[social sciences]]: a community is a group of people living near one another who interact socially. [[Social interaction]] on a small scale can be difficult to identify with archaeological data. Most reconstructions of social communities by archaeologists rely on the principle that social interaction is conditioned by physical distance. Therefore a small village settlement likely constituted a social community, and spatial subdivisions of cities and other large settlements may have formed communities. Archaeologists typically use similarities in [[material culture]]—from house types to styles of pottery—to reconstruct communities in the past. This is based on the assumption that people or households will share more similarities in the types and styles of their material goods with other members of a social community than they will with outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;Canuto, Marcello A. and Jason Yaeger (editors) (2000) ''The Archaeology of Communities''. Routledge, New York. Hegmon, Michelle (2002) Concepts of Community in Archaeological Research. In ''Seeking the Center: Archaeology and Ancient Communities in the Mesa Verde Region,'' edited by Mark D. Varien and Richard H. Wilshusen, pp. 263-279. University of Utah Press, Salt Lake City.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social philosophy===
====Communitarianism====
{{Main|Communitarianism}}
Communitarianism as a group of related but distinct philosophies (or [[Ideology|ideologies]]) began in the late 20th century, opposing [[classical liberalism]] and [[capitalism]] while advocating phenomena such as [[civil society]]. Not necessarily hostile to [[social liberalism]], communitarianism rather has a different emphasis, shifting the focus of interest toward communities and societies and away from the individual. The question of priority, whether for the individual or community, must be determined in dealing with pressing ethical questions about a variety of social issues, such as [[health care]], [[abortion]], [[multiculturalism]], and [[hate speech]]. [[Gad Barzilai]] has critically examined both liberalism and communitarianism and has developed the theory of [[Communitarianism#Critical_communitarianism|critical communitarianism]]. Barzilai has explicated how non-ruling communities are constructing legal cultures while interacting with various facets of political power. Being venues of identity construction justifies collective protections of communities in law, while the boundaries with other communities, states, and global forces should be sensitive to preservation of various cultures. [[Gad Barzilai]] has accordingly offered how to protect human rights, individual rights, and multiculturalism in inter-communal context that allows to generating [[cultural relativism]].

===Business and communications===
====Organizational communication====
{{Main|Organizational communication}}
Effective [[communication]] practices in group and organizational settings are very important to the formation and maintenance of communities. The ways that ideas and values are communicated within communities are important to the induction of new members, the formulation of agendas, the selection of leaders and many other aspects. Organizational communication is the study of how people communicate within an organizational context and the influences and interactions within [[organizational structure]]s. Group members depend on the flow of communication to establish their own identity within these structures and learn to function in the group setting. Although organizational communication, as a field of study, is usually geared toward companies and business groups, these may also be seen as communities. The principles of organizational communication can also be applied to other types of communities.

===Ecology===
{{Main|Community (ecology)}}

In ecology, a community is an assemblage of populations of different species, interacting with one another. Community ecology is the branch of [[ecology]] that studies interactions between and among species. It considers how such interactions, along with interactions between species and the [[abiotic]] environment, affect community structure and species richness, diversity and patterns of abundance. Species interact in three ways: [[competition]], [[predation]] and [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]. Competition typically results in a double negative—that is both species lose in the interaction. Predation is a win/lose situation with one species winning. Mutualism, on the other hand, involves both species cooperating in some way, with both winning.

==Interdisciplinary perspectives==
===Socialization===
{{Main|Socialization}}

[[Image:Lewes Bonfire, Martyrs Crosses.jpg|thumb|[[Lewes#Lewes Bonfire|Lewes Bonfire Night]] procession commemorating 17 Protestant martyrs burnt at the stake from 1555 to 1557.]]

The process of learning to adopt the [[behavior]] patterns of the community is called [[socialization]]. The most fertile time of socialization is usually the early stages of life, during which [[individual]]s develop the skills and knowledge and learn the [[role]]s necessary to function within their [[culture]] and [[social environment]].&lt;ref name=Socialization&gt;Newman, D. 2005. [http://www.pineforge.com/upm-data/9006_Chapter_5.pdf Chapter 5. &quot;Building Identity: Socialization&quot;] pp. 134-140.&lt;/ref&gt; For some psychologists, especially those in the [[psychodynamic]] tradition, the most important period of socialization is between the ages of one and ten. But socialization also includes adults moving into a significantly different environment, where they must learn a new set of behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, D. 2005, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialization is influenced primarily by the family, through which children first learn community [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]. Other important influences include school, [[Peer group|peer]] groups, people, schools, mass media, the workplace, and government. The degree to which the norms of a particular society or community are adopted determines one's willingness to engage with others. The norms of [[tolerance]], [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], and [[Trust (sociology)|trust]] are important &quot;habits of the heart,&quot; as [[Alexis de Tocqueville|de Tocqueville]] put it, in an individual's involvement in community.&lt;ref name = Community&gt;Smith, M. 2001. [http://www.infed.org/community/community.htm Community].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community development==

{{Main|Community development}}
Community development, often linked with [[Community Work]] or Community Planning, is often formally conducted by [[non-government organisations]] (NGOs), universities or government agencies to progress the social well-being of local, regional and, sometimes, national communities. Less formal efforts, called [[community building]] or [[community organizing]], seek to empower individuals and groups of people by providing them with the skills they need to effect change in their own communities.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Anthony, &quot;With Head, Heart and Hand: Dimensions of Community Building&quot; (Boolarong Press)
[ISBN 978086439076]&lt;/ref&gt; These skills often assist in building political power through the formation of large social groups working for a common agenda. Community development practitioners must understand both how to work with individuals and how to affect communities' positions within the context of larger social institutions.

Formal programs conducted by universities are often used to build a knowledge base to drive curricula in sociology and [[community studies]]. The [[General Social Survey]] from the [[National Opinion Research Center]] at the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[Saguaro Seminar]] at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] are examples of national community development in the [[United States]]. In The [[United Kingdom]], [[Oxford University]] has led in providing extensive research in the field through its '' Community Development Journal,''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdj.oxfordjournals.org/ Community Development Journal], Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; used worldwide by sociologists and community development practitioners.

At the intersection between community ''development'' and community ''building'' are a number of programs and organizations with community development tools. One example of this is the program of the Asset Based Community Development Institute of [[Northwestern University]]. The institute makes available downloadable tools&lt;ref&gt;ABCD Institute, in cooperation with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. 2006. [http://www.northwestern.edu/ipr/abcd/kelloggabcd.htmll ''Discovering Community Power: A Guide to Mobilizing Local Assets and Your Organization's Capacity''].&lt;/ref&gt; to assess community assets and make connections between [[Non-profit organization|non-profit groups]] and other organizations that can help in community building. The Institute focuses on helping communities develop by &quot;mobilizing neighborhood assets&quot;&amp;nbsp;— building from the inside out rather than the outside in.&lt;ref&gt;ABCD Institute. 2006. [http://www.northwestern.edu/ipr/abcd.html Welcome to ABCD].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community building and organizing===
In ''The Different Drum: Community-Making and Peace,'' [[M. Scott Peck|Scott Peck]] argues that the almost accidental sense of community that exists at times of crisis can be consciously built. Peck believes that conscious community building is a process of deliberate design based on the knowledge and application of certain rules.&lt;ref&gt;[[M. Scott Peck]], (1987). ''The Different Drum: Community-Making and Peace,'' pp. 83-85.&lt;/ref&gt; He states that this process goes through four stages:&lt;ref&gt;Peck (1987), pp. 86-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

# 
# '''Chaos''': When people move beyond the inauthenticity of pseudo-community and feel safe enough to present their &quot;shadow&quot; selves. This stage places great demands upon the facilitator for greater leadership and organization, but Peck believes that &quot;organizations are not communities&quot;, and this pressure should be resisted.
# '''Emptiness''': This stage moves beyond the attempts to fix, heal and convert of the chaos stage, when all people become capable of acknowledging their own woundedness and brokenness, common to us all as human beings. Out of this emptiness comes
# '''True community''': the process of deep respect and true listening for the needs of the other people in this community. This stage Peck believes can only be described as &quot;glory&quot; and reflects a deep yearning in every human soul for compassionate understanding from one's fellows.
More recently Peck remarked that building a sense of community is easy but maintaining this sense of community is difficult in the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;M. Scott Peck (1991). [http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC29/Peck.htm &quot;The Joy of Community&quot;]. An interview with M. Scott Peck by Alan Atkisson. ''In Context'' #29, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Community building can use a wide variety of practices, ranging from simple events such as [[potluck]]s and small [[Book discussion club|book clubs]] to larger–scale efforts such as mass [[festival]]s and [[construction]] projects that involve local participants rather than outside contractors.

Community building that is geared toward citizen action is usually termed &quot;community organizing.&quot;&lt;ref name = organizing&gt;Wells, David (1994) [http://www.sonoma.edu/users/w/wallsd/community-organizing.shtml Power to the People: Thirty-five Years of Community Organizing]. From ''The Workbook'', Summer 1994, pp. 52-55. Retrieved on: June 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, organized community groups seek accountability from elected officials and increased direct representation within decision-making bodies. Where good-faith negotiations fail, these constituency-led organizations seek to pressure the decision-makers through a variety of means, including picketing, [[boycott]]ing, sit-ins, petitioning, and electoral politics. The [[ARISE Detroit!]] coalition and the [[Toronto Public Space Committee]] are examples of [[activism|activist networks]] committed to shielding local communities from government and corporate domination and inordinate influence.

Community organizing is sometimes focused on more than just resolving specific issues. Organizing often means building a widely accessible power structure, often with the end goal of distributing power equally throughout the community. Community organizers generally seek to build groups that are open and democratic in governance. Such groups facilitate and encourage [[consensus decision-making]] with a focus on the general health of the community rather than a specific interest group. The three basic types of community organizing are [[grassroots]] organizing, [[coalition]] building, and &quot;institution-based community organizing,&quot; (also called &quot;broad-based community organizing,&quot; an example of which is [[faith-based community|faith-based community organizing]], or &quot;congregation-based community organizing&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Jacoby Brown, Michael, (2006), &quot;Building Powerful Community Organizations: A Personal Guide To Creating Groups That Can Solve Problems and Change the World&quot; (Long Haul Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

If communities are developed based on something they share in common, whether that be location or values, then one challenge for developing communities is how to incorporate individuality and differences. Indeed, as Rebekah Nathan suggests in her book, My Freshman Year, we are actually drawn to developing communities totally based on sameness, despite stated commitments to diversity, such as those found on university websites. Nathan states that certain commonalities allow college students to cohere: “What holds students together, really, is age, pop culture, a handful of (recent) historical events, and getting a degree” (qtd. In Barrios 229). Universities may try to create community through all freshman reads, freshman seminars, and school pride; however, Nathan argues students will only form communities based on the attributes, such as age and pop culture, that they bring with them to college. Nathan’s point, then, is that people come to college and don't expand their social horizons and cultural tolerance, which can prevent the development of your social community. (Barrios, Barclay. ''Emerging: Conetmporary Readings for Writers''. New York: Bedford St. Martins, 2010.) 

====Community currencies====
Some communities have developed their own &quot;[[Local Exchange Trading Systems]]&quot; (LETS)&lt;ref&gt;Local Exchange Trading Systems were first developed by [[Michael Linton]], in [[Courtenay, British Columbia|Courtenay, BC]], ''see'' [http://www.gmlets.u-net.com/explore/home.html &quot;LETSystems - new money&quot;].

===Community service===
{{Main|Community service}}
[[Community service]] is usually performed in connection with a [[nonprofit organization]], but it may also be undertaken under the auspices of government, one or more businesses, or by individuals. It is typically unpaid and [[volunteering|voluntary]]. However, it can be part of alternative [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] approaches in a [[justice system]] and it can be required by educational institutions.

==Types of community==
[[Image:Community Circle at OUR Ecovillage.jpg|thumb|Participants in Diana Leafe Christian's &quot;Heart of a Healthy Community&quot; seminar circle during an afternoon session at O.U.R. [[Ecovillage]]]]

A number of ways to categorize types of community have been proposed; one such breakdown is:
# '''Geographic communities''': range from the local [[neighbourhood]], [[suburb]], [[village]], [[town]] or [[city]], region, nation or even the planet as a whole. These refer to communities of ''location''.
# '''Communities of culture''': range from the local clique, sub-culture, [[ethnic group]], [[religious]], [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] or [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralistic]] [[civilisation]], or the [[globalisation|global]] community cultures of today. They may be included as ''communities of need'' or ''identity'', such as [[disability|disabled persons]], or [[Senior Citizens|frail aged]] people.
# '''Community organizations''': range from informal [[family]] or [[kinship]] networks, to more formal [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated associations]], [[politics|political]] [[decision making]] structures, [[economics|economic]] enterprises, or professional associations at a small, national or international scale.

Communities are nested; one community can contain another—for example a geographic community may contain a number of ethnic communities.&lt;ref&gt;Tropman John E., Erlich, John L. and Rothman, Jack (2006), &quot;Tactics and Techniques of Community Intervention&quot; (Wadsworth Publishing)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location===
Possibly the most common usage of the word ''&quot;community&quot;'' indicates a large group living in close proximity. Examples of [[local community]] include:
* A [[municipality]] is an administrative local area generally composed of a clearly defined territory and commonly referring to a [[town]] or [[village]].
[[Image:Wakefield common.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Wakefield, Massachusetts|Wakefield, Ma.]] is an example of a small town which constitutes a local community.]]
Although large [[cities]] are also municipalities, they are often thought of as a collection of communities, due to their diversity.
* A [[neighborhood]] is a geographically localized community, often within a larger [[city]] or [[suburb]].
* A [[new town|planned community]] is one that was [[urban planning|designed]] from scratch and grew up more or less following the plan. Several of the world's [[Capital (political)|capital cities]] are planned cities, notably [[Washington, D.C.]], in the [[United States]], [[Canberra]] in [[Australia]], and [[Brasília]] in [[Brazil]]. It was also common during the [[European colonization of the Americas]] to build according to a plan either on fresh ground or on the ruins of earlier [[Amerindian]] cities.
{{Details|Community of place}}

===Identity===
{{Details|Community of interest}}

In some contexts, ''&quot;community&quot;'' indicates a group of people with a common identity other than location. Members often interact regularly. Common examples in everyday usage include:
* A &quot;professional community&quot; is a group of people with the same or related occupations. Some of those members may join a [[professional society]], making a more defined and formalized group. These are also sometimes known as [[Community of practice|communities of practice]].
* A [[virtual community]] is a [[group (sociology)|group]] of people primarily or initially communicating or interacting with each other by means of information technologies, typically over the [[Internet]], rather than in person. These may be either communities of interest, [[Virtual Community of Practice|practice]] or communion. Research interest is evolving in the [[motivations for contributing to online communities]].

===Overlaps===
{{Details|Intentional community}}

Some communities share both location and other attributes. Members choose to live near each other because of one or more common interests.
* A [[retirement community]] is designated and at least usually designed for retirees and seniors—often restricted to those over a certain age, such as 56. It differs from a [[retirement home]], which is a single building or small complex, by having a number of autonomous households.
* An intentional community is a deliberate residential community with a much higher degree of social communication than other communities. The members of an intentional community typically hold a common social, political or spiritual vision and share responsibilities and resources. Intentional communities include [[Amish]] villages, [[ashrams]], [[cohousing]], [[commune (intentional community)|communes]], [[ecovillages]], [[housing cooperative]]s, [[kibbutzim]], and [[land trust]]s.

===Internet communities===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
To a growing part of people the meaning of the word ''&quot;community&quot;'' indicates a smaller or larger group of internet users signing up to become members of a community page/system on internet. Examples of [[internet communities]] include:
* A [[business community]] is often an administrative community with possibilities to add CV's and other business-related information.
* An [[interest community]] is a based on specialized areas such as [[art]], [[golf]] or [[bird watching]].
* A [[general community]] is wider in its range - opening for its users to create areas, pages and groups.

==Special nature of human community==

Definitions of community as &quot;organisms inhabiting a common environment and interacting with one another,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Australian Academy of Science. [http://www.science.org.au/nova/010/010glo.htm Nova: Science in the News]. Retrieved: 2006-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt; while scientifically accurate, do not convey the richness, diversity and complexity of human communities. Their classification, likewise is almost never precise. Untidy as it may be, community is vital for humans.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} [[M. Scott Peck]] expresses this in the following way: &quot;There can be no vulnerability without risk; there can be no community without vulnerability; there can be no peace, and ultimately no life, without community.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Peck (1987), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''community college''' is a type of [[educational institution]]. The term can have different meanings in different countries.

==Australia==
Community colleges in Australia are called [[TAFE]] (Technical and Further Education). There are a number of courses one can take at a TAFE, but not all campuses offer the same courses. They offer short courses, and nationally accredited certificates. The highest level of training one can achieve at TAFE is an Advanced Diploma.

== Canada ==
{{main|College (Canada)}}

In [[Canada]], the 150 institutions that are the rough equivalent of the US community college are usually referred to as &quot;[[College (Canada)|colleges]]&quot; since in [[Canadian English|common usage]] a degree granting institution is almost exclusively a [[university]]. In the province of Quebec, even when speaking in English, colleges are called [[CEGEP|Cégeps]] for Collège d'enseignement général et professionnel, meaning &quot;College of General and Vocational Education&quot;. (The word College can also refer to a private High School in Quebec). Colleges are educational institution providing [[higher education]] and [[tertiary education]], granting [[Academic certificate|certificates]], [[diploma]]s, [[associate's degree]]s, and [[bachelor's degree]]s. Each Province has its own system of Colleges reflecting the decentralization of the Canadian Education system as provided for in The Constitution Act, 1867. However virtually all of them began in the mid 1960's as a response to the shortage of skilled immigrants as the wave of post second World War II Europeans began to decline just as the Canadian economy was beginning to expand rapidly. The motivation was economic as opposed to the much earlier start in the United States of Junior and Community Colleges which was driven by an integrative social policy.

== Malaysia ==
{{main|Community college (Malaysia)}}
Community colleges in Malaysia are a network of educational institutions whereby vocational and technical skills training could be provided at all levels for school leavers before they entered the workforce. The community colleges also provide an infrastructure for rural communities to gain skills training through short courses as well as providing access to a post-secondary education.

At the moment, most community colleges award qualifications up to Level 3 in the [[Malaysian Qualifications Framework]] (Certificate 3) in both the Skills sector (Sijil Kemahiran Malaysia or the Malaysian Skills Certificate) as well as the Vocational and Training sector but the number of community colleges that are starting to award Level 4 qualifications (Diploma) are increasing. This is two levels below a Bachelor's degree (Level 6 in the MQF) and students within the system who intend to further their studies to that level will usually seek entry into Advanced Diploma programs in public universities, polytechnics or accredited private providers.

==Philippines==
In the [[Philippines]], a community school functions as elementary or secondary school at daytime and towards the end of the day convert into a community college. This type of institution offers night classes under the supervision of the same principal, and the same faculty members who are given part time college teaching load.&lt;ref name=alcu&gt;{{cite web

The concept of community college dates back to the time of the former '''Minister of Education, Culture and Sports (MECS)''' that had under its wings the Bureaus of Elementary Education, Secondary Education, Higher Education and Vocational-Technical Education. MECS Secretary, Dr. Cecilio Putong, who in 1971 wrote that a community school is a school established in the community, by the community, and for the community itself. Dr. Pedro T. Orata of Pangasinan shared the same idea, hence the establishment of a Community College, now called the City College of Urdaneta.&lt;ref name=&quot;alcu&quot;/&gt;

A community college like the one in [[Abuyog]], [[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] can operate with only [[Philippine peso|PHP]] 124,000 annual budget in a 2-storey structure housing more than 700 students.&lt;ref name=&quot;alcu&quot;/&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], a community college is a school which not only provides education for the school age population (11-19) of the locality, but also additional services and education to adults and other members of the community.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/community-college&lt;/ref&gt; This education includes but is not limited to sports, adult literacy and lifestyle education.

==United States==
{{main|Community colleges in the United States}}
[[Image:Joliet Junior College Sign.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Joliet Junior College]] Main Campus, in [[Joliet, Illinois]] the first Community College in the US.]]
[[Image:6304-FullertonJrCollege-1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Fullerton College]] the oldest community college (originally &quot;Junior College&quot;) in continuous operation in California, having been established in 1913]]

In the [[United States]], community colleges, sometimes called '''[[junior colleges]]''', '''[[technical college]]s''', or '''[[city college]]s''', are primarily two-year [[public]] institutions providing higher education and lower-level [[tertiary education]], granting [[Academic certificate|certificates]], [[diploma]]s, and [[associate's degree]]s.

After graduating from a community college, some students transfer to a four-year [[liberal arts college]] or [[university]] for two to three years to complete a [[bachelor's degree]].

Before the 1970s, community colleges in the United States were more commonly referred to as [[junior colleges]], and that term is still used at some institutions. However, the term &quot;junior college&quot; has evolved to describe [[Privately-held company|private]] two-year institutions, whereas the term &quot;community college&quot; has evolved to describe publicly funded two-year institutions. The name derives from the fact that community colleges primarily attract and accept students from the local [[community]], and are often supported by local tax revenue.

===Comprehensive community colleges===
Many schools have evolved into and adapted the term ''comprehensive'' to describe their institutions. These schools typically offer five facets of education. 

*'''Transfer education''' – The traditional two-year student that will then transfer to a four-year institution to pursue a BS/BA degree.
*'''Career education''' – The traditional two-year student that will graduate with an Associate Degree and directly enter the workforce.
*'''Developmental''' – Remedial education for high school graduates who are not academically ready to enroll in college-level courses.
*'''Continuing''' – Non-Credit courses offered to the community for personal development and interest.
*'''Industry training''' – Contracted training and education wherein a local company pays the college to provide specific training or courses for their employees.

Within the transfer education category, comprehensive schools typically have [[Articulation (education)|articulation]] agreements in place that provide prearranged acceptance into specific four-year institutions. At some community colleges, the partnering four-year institution teaches the third and fourth year courses at the community college location and thereby allows a student to obtain a four year degree without having to physically move to the four-year school.

There are a number of institutions and organizations which provide [[community college research]] to inform practice and policy.

==Research==

There are a number of research organizations and publications who focus upon the activities of community college, [[junior college]], and [[technical college]] institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mellow, G.O. 2008&quot;&gt;Mellow, G.O. &amp; Heelan, C.

[[Image:Montgomery Civil Rights Memorial.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''detail'' - The Civil Rights Memorial]]

The '''Civil Rights Memorial''' in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], is a [[memorial]] to 40 people who died in the struggle for equal and integrated treatment of people of European and African descent. The memorial is sponsored by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]. There is a guard standing across the street from the memorial to prevent vandalism, while allowing people to experience this memorial.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The names included belong to those who died between 1954 and 1968. Those dates were chosen because in 1954 the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that [[racial segregation]] in schools was unlawful and 1968 is the year of [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King's assassination]]. The monument was created by [[Maya Lin]] who also created a similar work, the &quot;Women's Table&quot;, at [[Yale University]] and the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. The memorial was dedicated in 1989.

The concept of Maya Lin's design is based on the soothing and healing effect of water. It was inspired by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s quotation ''&quot;... we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream. ...&quot;'', from the &quot;[[I Have a Dream]]&quot; speech, delivered at the [[Lincoln Memorial]], [[Washington D.C.]], August 28, 1963.  This passage in King's speech is a direct reference to [[Book of Amos|Amos]] {{bibleverse-nb||Amos|5:24|KJV}}, as translated in the King James version of the Bible.  The memorial is a round stone inverted [[Cone (geometry)|cone]], which is a [[fountain]]. A film of water flows over the base of the cone, which contains the 40 names included. It is possible to touch the smooth film of water and temporarily alter the surface film, which quickly returns to smoothness.

As such, the memorial represents the aspiration of the [[American civil rights movement]] against [[racism]].

'''Charles Babbage, [[Royal Society | FRS]]''' (26 December 1791&amp;nbsp;– 18 October 1871)&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Deaths: December 1871 1a 383 MARYLEBONE: Charles Babbage, aged 79&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Englishman | English]] mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer who originated the concept of a programmable computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tanenbaum | first = Andrew | title = Modern Operating Systems | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2007 | page = 7 | isbn = 0136006639 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered a &quot;father of the computer&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Halacy, Daniel Stephen | title = Charles Babbage, Father of the Computer | year = 1970 | publisher = Crowell-Collier Press | isbn = 0027413705 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer that eventually led to more complex designs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Swade, Doron | title = The Difference Engine:  Charles Babbage and the Quest to Build the First Computer | year = 2000 | publisher = Penguin | page = 84-87 | isbn = 01420.01449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Parts of his uncompleted mechanisms are on display in the [[London Science Museum]]. In 1991, a perfectly functioning [[difference engine]] was constructed from Babbage's original plans. Built to tolerances achievable in the 19th century, the success of the finished engine indicated that Babbage's machine would have worked. Nine years later, the Science Museum completed the [[computer printer | printer]] Babbage had designed for the difference engine, an astonishingly complex device for the 19th century.

== Birth ==

Babbage's birthplace is disputed, but he was most likely born at 44 Crosby Row, [[Walworth Road]], London, England. A [[blue plaque]] on the junction of Larcom Street and Walworth Road commemorates the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque | 1140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His date of birth was given in his obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' as 26 December 1792. However after the obituary appeared, a nephew wrote to say that Charles Babbage was born one year earlier, in 1791. The parish register of St. Mary's [[Newington, London | Newington]], London, shows that Babbage was [[Baptism | baptised]] on 6 January 1792, supporting a birth year of 1791.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hyman | first = Anthony | title = Charles Babbage, Pioneer of the Computer | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1982 | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Moseley | first = Maboth | title = Irascible Genius, The Life of Charles Babbage | publisher = Henry Regnery Company | location = Chicago | year = 1964 | page = 29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = [[s:The Times/The Late Mr. Charles Babbage, F.R.S. | The Late Mr. Charles Babbage, F.R.S]] | work = [[The Times]] | date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babbage's father, Benjamin Babbage, was a banking partner of the Praeds who owned the Bitton Estate in [[Teignmouth]]. His mother was Betsy Plumleigh Teape. In 1808, the Babbage family moved into the old Rowdens house in [[Teignmouth | East Teignmouth]], and Benjamin Babbage became a warden of the nearby St. Michael's Church.

== Education ==
{{Wikisource|The Times/The Late Mr. Charles Babbage, F.R.S.}}

His father's money allowed Charles to receive instruction from several schools and tutors during the course of his elementary education. Around the age of eight he was sent to a country school in [[Alphington, Devon | Alphington]] near Exeter to recover from a life-threatening fever. His parents ordered that his &quot;brain was not to be taxed too much &quot; and Babbage felt that &quot;this great idleness may have led to some of my childish reasonings.&quot; For a short time he attended [[King Edward VI Community College#Grammar school | King Edward VI Grammar School]] in [[Totnes]], South Devon, but his health forced him back to private tutors for a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Moseley | first = Maboth | title = Irascible Genius, The Life of Charles Babbage | publisher = Henry Regnery Company | location = Chicago | year = 1964 | page = 39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then joined a 30-student Holmwood academy, in Baker Street, [[Municipal Borough of Enfield | Enfield]], [[Middlesex]] under Reverend Stephen Freeman. The academy had a well-stocked library that prompted Babbage's love of mathematics. He studied with two more private tutors after leaving the academy. Of the first, a clergyman near [[Cambridge]], Babbage said,&quot;I fear I did not derive from it all the advantages that I might have done.&quot; The second was an Oxford tutor from whom Babbage learned enough of the Classics to be accepted to Cambridge.

Babbage arrived at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in October 1810.&lt;ref name = Venn&gt;{{Venn | id = BBG810C | name = Babbage, Charles }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had read extensively in [[Leibniz]], [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], [[Thomas Simpson]], and [[Lacroix]] and was seriously disappointed in the mathematical instruction available at Cambridge. In response, he, [[John Herschel]], [[George Peacock]], and several other friends formed the [[Analytical Society]] in 1812. Babbage, Herschel, and Peacock were also close friends with future judge and patron of science [[Edward Ryan]]. Babbage and Ryan married two sisters.&lt;ref name = wilkes&gt;Wilkes (2002) ''p.''355&lt;/ref&gt; As a student, Babbage was also a member of other societies such as the Ghost Club, concerned with investigating supernatural phenomena, and the Extractors Club, dedicated to liberating its members from the madhouse, should any be committed to one.&lt;ref name = GEB&gt;{{cite book | last = Hofstadter | first = Douglas R. | authorlink = Douglas Hofstadter | title = [[Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid]] | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | date = 1979, 2000 | page = 726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = allsands&gt;{{cite web | title = Charles Babbage'S Computer Engines | url = http://www.allsands.com/History/Objects/babbagecomputer_yy_gn.htm | accessdate = 13 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812 Babbage transferred to [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name = Venn/&gt; He was the top mathematician at Peterhouse, but did not graduate with honours. He instead received an honorary degree without examination in 1814.

== Marriage, family, death ==
[[file:Babbage Charles grave.jpg|thumb|Grave of Charles Babbage at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]]]]

On 25 July 1814, Babbage married Georgiana Whitmore at St. Michael's Church in Teignmouth, Devon. The couple lived at [[Dudmaston Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.visitbritain.co.uk/Attraction/Bridgnorth/Historic-House-or-Palace/157092/Dudmaston-Hall.htm | title = Attraction information for Dudmaston Hall | publisher = VisitBritain | accessdate = 29 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shropshire (where Babbage engineered the central heating system), before moving to 5 Devonshire Street, Portland Place, London.

Charles and Georgiana had eight children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bavidge.co.uk/Babbage%20Family%20Tree%202005,%20InternetTree/wc03/wc03_074.htm | title = Babbage Family Tree 2005 | author = Valerie Bavidge-Richardson | accessdate = 22 October 2007 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013194355/http://bavidge.co.uk/Babbage+Family+Tree+2005,+InternetTree/wc03/wc03_074.htm | archivedate = 13 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but only three—[[Benjamin Babbage | Benjamin Herschel]], Georgiana Whitmore, and Henry Prevost—survived to adulthood. Georgiana died in [[Worcester]] on 1 September 1827. Charles' father, wife, and at least one son all died in 1827. These deaths caused Babbage to go into a mental breakdown which delayed the construction of his machines.

His youngest son, Henry Prevost Babbage (1824–1918), went on to create six working difference engines based on his father's designs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/henrybabbage/ | title = Henry Prevost Babbage&amp;nbsp;– The Babbage Engine | publisher = Computer History Museum | accessdate = 29 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which was sent to [[Harvard University]] where it was later discovered by [[Howard H. Aiken]], pioneer of the [[Harvard Mark I]]. Henry Prevost's 1910 Analytical Engine Mill, previously on display at [[Dudmaston Hall]], is now on display at [[Science Museum (London) | the Science Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/computing_and_data_processing/1896-58.aspx | title = Henry Babbage's Analytical Engine Mill, 1910 | publisher = Science Museum | date = 16 January 2007 | accessdate = 29 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Babbage died at age 79 on 18 October 1871, and was buried in London's [[Kensal Green Cemetery]]. According to Horsley, Babbage died &quot;of renal inadequacy, secondary to [[cystitis]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Horsley, Victor | title = Description of the Brain of Mr. Charles Babbage, F.R.S | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

== Design of computers ==
[[file:BabbageDifferenceEngine.jpg|thumb|Part of Babbage's difference engine, assembled after his death by Babbage's son, using parts found in his laboratory]]

{{cquote|
In 1812 he was sitting in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he knew to be full of mistakes, when the idea occurred to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery.  The French government had produced several tables by a new method.  Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages, and the work itself, which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes.  Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labors of the unskilled computers could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable.|author=B. V. Bowden|source=Faster than thought, Pitman|}}
Babbage's machines were among the first mechanical computers, although they were not actually completed, largely because of funding problems and personality issues. He directed the building of some steam-powered machines that achieved some success, suggesting that calculations could be mechanised. Although Babbage's machines were mechanical and unwieldy, their basic architecture was very similar to a modern computer. The data and program memory were separated, operation was instruction based, the control unit could make conditional jumps and the machine had a separate [[Input/output | I/O]] unit. For more than ten years he received government funding for his project, which amounted to £17,000.00, but eventually the Treasury lost confidence in Babbage.&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, J. (2011) ''The Information: a History, a Theory, a Flood,'' London, Fourth Estate, p 104&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference engine ==
[[File:050114 2529 difference.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]]'s Difference Engine #2, built from Babbage's design]]
{{main|Difference engine}}

In Babbage's time, numerical tables were calculated by humans who were called 'computers', meaning &quot;one who computes&quot;, much as a conductor is &quot;one who conducts&quot;. At Cambridge, he saw the high error-rate of this human-driven process and started his life's work of trying to calculate the tables mechanically. He began in 1822 with what he called the difference engine, made to compute values of polynomial functions. Unlike similar efforts of the time, Babbage's difference engine was created to calculate a series of values automatically. By using the method of [[finite difference]]s, it was possible to avoid the need for multiplication and division.

At the beginning of the 1820s, Babbage worked on a prototype of his first difference engine. Some parts of this prototype still survive in the Museum of the history of science in Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Denis | last = Roegel | title = Prototype Fragments from Babbage's First Difference Engine | journal = IEEE Annals of the History of Computing | volume = 31 | number = 2 | pages = 70–5 | date = April–June 2009 | url = http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/MAHC.2009.31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prototype evolved into the &quot;first difference engine.&quot; It remained unfinished and the completed fragment is located at the Museum of Science in London. This first difference engine would have been composed of around 25,000 parts, weighed fifteen [[short ton | tons]] (13,600&amp;nbsp;kg), and been {{Convert|8|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} tall. Although Babbage received ample funding for the project, it was never completed. He later designed an improved version,&quot;Difference Engine No. 2&quot;, which was not constructed until 1989–91, using Babbage's plans and 19th century manufacturing tolerances. It performed its first calculation at the London Science Museum returning results to 31 digits, far more than the average modern pocket calculator.

=== Completed models ===

The London Science Museum has constructed two Difference Engines, according to Babbage's plans for the Difference Engine No 2. One is owned by the museum; the other, owned by technology millionaire [[Nathan Myhrvold]], went on exhibit at the [[Computer History Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/ | title = Overview&amp;nbsp;– The Babbage Engine | publisher = Computer History Museum | accessdate = 29 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Mountain View, California]] on 10 May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Shiels | first = Maggie | title = Victorian 'supercomputer' is reborn | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7391593.stm | accessdate = 11 May 2008 | work = BBC News | date = 10 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two models that have been constructed are not replicas; until the assembly of the first Difference Engine No. 2 by the London Science Museum, no model of it existed.

=== Analytical engine ===
{{main|analytical engine}}

Soon after the attempt at making the difference engine crumbled, Babbage started designing a different, more complex machine called the [[Analytical Engine]]. The engine is not a single physical machine but a succession of designs that he tinkered with until his death in 1871. The main difference between the two engines is that the Analytical Engine could be programmed using [[punched card]]s. He realized that programs could be put on these cards so the person had only to create the program initially, and then put the cards in the machine and let it run. The analytical engine would have used loops of [[Jacquard loom | Jacquard's]] punched cards to control a mechanical calculator, which could formulate results based on the results of preceding computations. This machine was also intended to employ several features subsequently used in modern computers, including sequential control, branching, and looping, and would have been the first mechanical device to be [[Turing-complete]].

[[Ada Lovelace]], an impressive mathematician, and one of the few people who fully understood Babbage's ideas, created a program for the Analytical Engine. Had the Analytical Engine ever actually been built, her program would have been able to calculate a sequence of [[Bernoulli numbers]]. Based on this work, Lovelace is now widely credited with being the first [[programmer | computer programmer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fuegi J, Francis J | title = Lovelace &amp; Babbage and the creation of the 1843 'notes' | journal = Annals of the History of Computing | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 16–26 | date = October–December 2003 | doi = 10.1109/MAHC.2003.1253887 }} See pages 19, 25&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, a contemporary programming language was named [[Ada programming language | Ada]] in her honour.

== Modern adaptations ==

While the abacus and mechanical calculator have been replaced by electronic calculators using [[microchip]]s, the recent advances in [[microelectromechanical system|MEM]]s and [[nanotechnology]] have led to recent high-tech experiments in mechanical computation. The benefits suggested include operation in high radiation or high temperature environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WVI/is_1999_Oct_11/ai_56912203/print | title = Electronics Times: Micro-machines are fit for space | publisher = Findarticles.com | date = 11 October 1999 | accessdate = 29 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These modern versions of mechanical computation were highlighted in the magazine [[The Economist]] in its special &quot;end of the millennium&quot; black cover issue in an article entitled &quot;Babbage's Last Laugh&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/diversions/millennium/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_PNQGVQ Babbage's Last Laugh]{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other accomplishments ==

In 1824, Babbage won the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]] &quot;for his invention of an engine for calculating mathematical and astronomical tables&quot;. He was a founding member of the society and one of its oldest living members on his death in 1871.

From 1828 to 1839 Babbage was [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] at Cambridge. He contributed largely to several scientific periodicals, and was instrumental in founding the Astronomical Society in 1820 and the Statistical Society in 1834. However, he dreamt of designing mechanical calculating machines.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was sitting in the rooms of the Analytical Society, at Cambridge, my head leaning forward on the table in a kind of dreamy mood, with a table of logarithms lying open before me. Another member, coming into the room, and seeing me half asleep, called out, &quot;Well, Babbage, what are you dreaming about?&quot; to which I replied &quot;I am thinking that all these tables&quot; (pointing to the logarithms) &quot;might be calculated by machinery&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Babage was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1832.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1837, responding to the ''[[Bridgewater Treatises]]'', of which there were eight, he published his ''[[Ninth Bridgewater Treatise]]'', ''On the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation'', putting forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) which then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with ''[[ad hoc]]'' miracles each time a new species was required. The book is a work of [[natural theology]], and incorporates extracts from correspondence he had been having with [[John Herschel]] on the subject.

Babbage also achieved notable results in [[cryptography]]. He broke Vigenère's [[autokey cipher]] as well as the much weaker cipher that is called [[Vigenère cipher]] today. The autokey cipher was generally called &quot;the undecipherable cipher&quot;, though owing to popular confusion, many thought that the weaker polyalphabetic cipher was the &quot;undecipherable &quot; one. Babbage's discovery was used to aid English military campaigns, and was not published until several years later; as a result credit for the development was instead given to [[Friedrich Kasiski]], a Prussian infantry officer, who made the same discovery some years after Babbage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Kahn, David L. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Codebreakers: The Story of Secret Writing | year = 1996 | publisher = Scribner | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-684-83130-5 | pages = }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, Babbage invented the [[pilot (locomotive)|pilot]] (also called a cow-catcher), the metal frame attached to the front of locomotives that clears the tracks of obstacles. He also constructed a [[dynamometer car]] and performed several studies on [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s [[Great Western Railway]] in about 1838.&lt;ref name = &quot;passages &quot;&gt;{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=2T0AAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=charles+babbage | title = Babbage, Charles&amp;nbsp;– &quot;Passages from the Life of a Philosopher&quot;, page 317-318. | publisher = Longman | year = 1864 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Babbage's eldest son, Benjamin Herschel Babbage, worked as an engineer for Brunel on the railways before emigrating to Australia in the 1850s.&lt;ref name = BBH&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/biogs/P000074b.htm | title = Babbage, Benjamin Herschel | work = Bright Sparcs Biographical entry | accessdate = 15 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babbage also invented an [[ophthalmoscope]], but although he gave it to a physician for testing it was forgotten, and the device only came into use after being independently invented by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.discoveriesinmedicine.com/Ni-Ra/Ophthalmoscope.html | title = Medical Discoveries, Ophthalmoscope | publisher = Discoveriesinmedicine.com | date = | accessdate = 29 January 2009 &lt;!-- it's in the BBC article but looks fanciful: is also credited with the invention of [[Standard gauge | standard railroad gauge]], uniform [[penny post | postal rates]], [[occulting light]]s for lighthouses, the [[heliograph]],[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7391593.stm Victorian 'supercomputer' is reborn]--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babbage twice stood for Parliament as a candidate for the borough of [[Finsbury (UK Parliament constituency) | Finsbury]]. In 1832 he came in third among five candidates, but in 1834 he finished last among four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Crowther, J. G. | title = Scientific Types | year = 1968 | publisher = Barrie &amp; Rockliff | location = London | page = 266 | isbn = 0248997297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Hyman Anthony | title = Charles Babbage, Pioneer of the Computer | year = 1982 | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | pages = 82–7 | isbn = 0691083037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Moseley | title = Irascible Genius, The Life of Charles Babbage | year = 1964 | publisher = Henery Regnery | location = Chicago | pages = 120–1 }}- Note some confusion as to the dates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[On the Economy of Machine and Manufacture]], Babbage described what is now called the Babbage principle, which describes certain advantages with division of labour. Babbage noted that highly skilled—and thus generally highly paid—workers spend parts of their job performing tasks that are &quot;below&quot; their skill level. If the labour process can be divided among several workers, it is possible to assign only high-skill tasks to high-skill and -cost workers and leave other working tasks to less-skilled and paid workers, thereby cutting labour costs. This principle was criticised by [[Karl Marx]] who argued that it caused labour segregation and contributed to [[Social alienation | alienation]]. The Babbage principle is an inherent assumption in [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]'s [[scientific management]].

[[file:Babbages Brain.jpg|thumb|upright|Charles Babbage's brain is on display at [[The Science Museum (London)|The Science Museum]]]]

Babbage once counted all the broken panes of glass of a factory, publishing in 1857 a &quot;Table of the Relative Frequency of the Causes of Breakage of Plate Glass Windows&quot;: Of 464 broken panes, 14 were caused by &quot;drunken men, women or boys&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Table of the Relative Frequency of Occurrence of the Causes of Breaking of Plate Glass Windows | author = Babbage, Charles | journal = Mechanics Magazine | year = 1857 | volume = 66 | page = 82 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Babbage, Charles | title = The Works of Charles Babbage | volume = V | year = 1989 | publisher = William Pickering | location = London | page = 137 | editor = Martin Campbell-Kelly | isbn = 1851960058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC05633593&amp;id=cScKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA417&amp;lpg=PA417&amp;dq=Table+of+the+Relative+Frequency+of+the+Causes+of+Breakage+of+Plate+Glass+Windows |title=The insurance cyclopeadia: being a ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babbage's distaste for commoners (&quot;the Mob&quot;) included writing &quot;Observations of Street Nuisances&quot; in 1864, as well as tallying up 165 &quot;nuisances&quot; over a period of 80 days. He especially hated [[busking | street music]], and in particular the music of [[organ grinder]]s, against whom he railed in various venues. The following quotation is typical: {{quote|It is difficult to estimate the misery inflicted upon thousands of persons, and the absolute pecuniary penalty imposed upon multitudes of intellectual workers by the loss of their time, destroyed by organ-grinders and other similar nuisances.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Campbell-Kelly, Martin; Babbage, Charles | title = Passages from the Life of a Philosopher | publisher = Pickering &amp; Chatto Publishers | year = 1994 | chapter = Ch 26 | page = 342 | isbn = 1-85196-040-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1860s, Babbage also took up the anti-[[Hoop rolling#British Empire|hoop-rolling]] campaign. He blamed hoop-rolling boys for driving their iron hoops under horses' legs, with the result that the rider is thrown and very often the horse breaks a leg.&lt;ref&gt;Passages from the life of a philosopher By Charles Babbage; p360&lt;/ref&gt; Babbage achieved a certain notoriety in this matter, being denounced in debate in Commons in 1864 for &quot;commencing a crusade against the popular game of [[tip-cat]] and the trundling of hoops.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hansard's parliamentary debates.

Babbage once contacted the poet [[Alfred Tennyson]] in response to his poem [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson#Partial list of works | &quot;The Vision of Sin&quot;]]. Babbage wrote,&quot;In your otherwise beautiful poem, one verse reads,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Babbage, Charles; [[Doron Swade | Swade, Doron]] | title = The difference engine: Charles Babbage and the quest to build the first computer | publisher = Viking Penguin | location = Ringwood, Vic | year = 2001 | page = 77 | isbn = 0-14-200144-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
:: ''Every moment dies a man,''
:: ''Every moment one is born.''

:&amp;nbsp;... If this were true, the population of the world would be at a standstill. In truth, the rate of birth is slightly in excess of that of death. I would suggest [that the next version of your poem should read]:

:: ''Every moment dies a man,''
:: ''Every moment 1 1/16 is born.''

: Strictly speaking, the actual figure is so long I cannot get it into a line, but I believe the figure 1 1/16 will be sufficiently accurate for poetry.&quot;

{{Crossdressing}}

'''Cross-dressing''' is the wearing of [[Clothes|clothing]] and other accoutrement commonly associated with a [[gender role|gender]] within a particular [[society]] that is seen as different than the one usually presented by the dresser.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;cross-dress.&quot; ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition.'' Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-dressing has been used for [[disguise]], [[performance art]] and as a literary trope in modern times and throughout history.

Nearly every human society throughout history has made distinctions between male and female gender by the style, color, or type of clothing they are expected to wear, and likewise most societies have had a set of [[Social aspects of clothing|norms, views, guidelines, or even laws]] defining what type of clothing is appropriate for each gender. Cross-dressing runs significantly counter to those norms and, therefore, can be seen as a type of [[transgender]] [[behavior]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} It does not, however, necessarily indicate transgender [[gender identity|identity]]; a person who cross-dresses does not always identify as being of the opposite gender.

The term '''cross-dress''ing''''' denotes an action or a behavior without attributing or proposing causes for that behavior. Some people automatically connect cross-dressing behavior to transgender identity or [[Human sexuality|sexual]], [[Sexual fetishism|fetishist]], and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] behavior, but the term ''cross-dressing'' itself does not imply any motives.

==History of crossdressing==
{{Main|History of crossdressing}}

Crossdressing has existed throughout much of recorded history. There are many examples in [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Norse mythology|Norse]], and [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]] mythology. A reasonable number of historical figures are known to have crossdressed to varying degrees and for a variety of reasons. There is a rich history of crossdressing found in folklore, literature, theater, and music.

==Varieties of cross-dressing==

There are many different kinds of cross-dressing and many different reasons why an individual might engage in cross-dressing behaviour.&lt;ref name = &quot;eucwqo&quot;&gt;''Rainbow Reader'', Fort Wayne, Indiana&lt;/ref&gt; Some people cross-dress as a matter of comfort or style. They may prefer clothing associated with the opposite sex. In this case, a person's cross-dressing may or may not be apparent to other people. Some people cross-dress to shock others or challenge [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]].

Both men and women may cross-dress to disguise their physical sex. Historically, some women have cross-dressed to take up male-dominated or male-exclusive professions, such as military service. Conversely, some men have cross-dressed to escape from mandatory military service&lt;ref&gt;See the television series ''M.A.S.H.'' for an example of a cross-dresser who didn't want to be in the military (Klinger); although, the character was played for laughs, this is based on military regulations prohibiting cross-dressers.&lt;/ref&gt; or as a disguise to assist in political or social protest, as men did in the [[Rebecca Riots]].

Single-sex theatrical troupes often have some performers cross-dress to play roles written for members of the opposite sex. Cross-dressing, particularly the depiction of males wearing [[dress]]es, is often used for comic effect onstage and onscreen.

[[Image:Lady Bunny and Sherry Vine by David Shankbone.JPG|thumb|[[Drag queen]]s are a form of cross-dressing as [[performance art]]]]
'''[[drag (clothing)|Drag]]''' is a special form of performance art based on cross-dressing. A '''[[drag queen]]''' is usually a male-bodied person who performs as an exaggeratedly feminine character, in heightened costuming sometimes consisting of a showy dress, high-heeled shoes, obvious makeup, and [[Wig (hair)|wig]]. A drag queen may imitate famous female film or pop-music stars. A [[faux queen]] is a female-bodied person employing the same techniques.

A '''[[drag king]]''' is a counterpart of the drag queen but usually for much different audiences. A female-bodied person (often [[lesbian]]s) who adopt a masculine persona in performance or imitates a male film or pop-music star. Some female-bodied people undergoing [[gender reassignment therapy]] also self-identify as ''drag kings'' although this use of &quot;drag king&quot; would generally be considered inaccurate.

Transgender people who are undergoing or have undergone gender reassignment therapy are usually not regarded as cross-dressing. Namely, a transsexual who has completed [[gender reassignment surgery]] is certainly not considered cross-dressing, unless they were to wear clothes of the gender opposite of what they have transitioned to. Pre-operative transsexuals may be considered similarly.

A [[transvestic fetishism|transvestic fetishist]] is a person (typically a [[heterosexual]] male) who cross-dresses as part of a [[sexual fetish]].

The term ''underdressing'' is used by male cross-dressers to describe wearing female undergarments under their male clothes. The famous low-budget filmmaker [[Edward D. Wood, Jr.]] said he often wore women's underwear under his military uniform during World War II.

Some people who cross-dress may endeavor to project a complete impression of belonging to another gender, down to mannerisms, [[Speech communication|speech]] patterns, and emulation of [[Sex-determination system|sexual characteristics]]. This is referred to as [[Passing (gender)|passing]] or &quot;trying to pass&quot; depending how successful the person is. An observer who sees through the cross-dresser's attempt to pass is said to have ''read'' or ''clocked'' them. There are videos, books, and magazines on how a man may look more like a woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Transformation'' magazine; interviews for ''Rainbow Reader'', Fort Wayne, Indiana&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes either person of a heterosexual couple will wear it to arouse the other. For example, the male would wear skirts or lingerie and/or the female will wear boxers or other male clothing. (See also [[forced feminization]])

Others may choose to take a mixed approach, adopting some feminine traits and some masculine traits in their appearance. For instance, a man might wear both a [[dress]] and a [[beard]]. This is sometimes known as ''[[genderfuck]]''.

Utilitarian purposes also bring about forms of crossdressing, such as support hose for men with bad circulation in their legs, or the wearing of bras for men with [[gynecomastia]] (male breasts).

==Clothes==
[[File:vanessatv.jpg|thumb|Some MTF Crossdressers seek a more subtle feminine image]]
[[Image:Sissy maid.JPG|thumb|right|Young [[Sex assignment|male assigned at birth]] person as a &quot;sissy maid&quot;]]
The actual determination of cross-dressing is largely [[socially constructed]]. For example, in Western society, trousers have been adopted for wear by women, and is not regarded as cross-dressing. In cultures where men have traditionally worn skirt-like garments such as the [[kilt]] or [[sarong]] these are not seen as female clothing, and wearing them is not seen as cross-dressing for men. As societies are becoming more global in nature, both men and women are adopting styles of dress associated with other cultures.

It was once [[taboo]] in Western society for women to wear clothes traditionally associated with men, excepting certain circumstances, such as for necessity (as per [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]'s guidelines in Summa Theologiae II)&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas, Thomas. &quot;Summa Theologiae&quot; Part II. Online at: http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3.htm /ref&gt;, or in the case of the &quot;holy transvestites&quot; (cross-dressing female saints), of which there were many. The limiting guidelines on acceptability seemed to focus on ''passing''; the taboo was most strongly focused on the blending of genders. ref&gt;Schibanoff, Susan. &quot;Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc&quot;, ''Transvestism and Idolatry'', p39 ref&gt; Cross dressing is somewhat cited as an &quot;abomination&quot; in the Bible in the book of [[Deuteronomy]] (22:5), although even in the Middle Ages, its applicability was occasionally disputed and still is.

The 15th century French poet [[Martin le Franc]], concerning [[Joan of Arc]]:
:Don't you see that it was forbidden
:That anyone should eat of an animal
:Unless it had a cleft foot
:And chewed its cud?
:To eat of a hare no one dared
:Neither of sow nor of piglet,
:Yet should you now be offered any,
:You would take many a morsel. ref&gt;Merkle, Gertrude H. &quot;Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc&quot;, ''Martin Le Franc's Commentary on Jean Gerson's Treatise on Joan of Arc'', p182&lt;/ref&gt;

While this prohibition remained in force in general throughout the middle and early modern ages, this is no longer the case and Western women are often seen wearing trousers, ties, and men's hats. Nevertheless, many cultures around the world still prohibit women from wearing trousers or other traditionally male clothing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

[[Cosplaying]] may also involve cross-dressing, for some females may wish to dress as a male, and vice versa (see [[Crossplay]]). Breast binding (for females) is not uncommon and is most likely needed to cosplay a male character.

In most parts of the world it remains socially frowned upon for men to wear clothes traditionally associated with women. Attempts are occasionally made, e.g. by fashion designers, to promote the acceptance of [[male skirt|skirts]] as everyday wear for men. Cross-dressers have complained that society permits women to wear pants or jeans and other masculine clothing, while condemning any man who wants to wear clothing sold for women.

While most male cross-dressers utilize clothing associated with modern women, there are some who are involved in subcultures that involve dressing as little girls or in [[vintage clothing]]. Some such men have written that they enjoy dressing as feminine as possible, so they will wear frilly dresses with lace and ribbons, as well as multiple [[petticoat]]s, [[corset]]s, [[girdle]]s and/or [[garter belt]]s with [[nylon stockings]].&lt;ref&gt;www.pettipond.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social issues==
Cross-dressers may begin wearing their opposite sex's clothing as children, using the clothes of a sibling, parent, or friend. Some parents have said they allowed their children to cross-dress and, in many cases, the child stopped when they became older. The same pattern often continues into adulthood, where there may be confrontations with a spouse. Married cross-dressers experience considerable anxiety and guilt if their spouse objects to their behaviour. Some cross-dressers have periodically disposed of all their clothing, a practice called &quot;purging&quot;, only to start another collection later.&lt;ref name = &quot;eucwqo&quot;/&gt;

==Analyses==
The historical associations of maleness with power and femaleness with submission and frivolity mean that in the present time a woman dressing in men's clothing and a man dressing in women's clothing evoke two very different responses. A man dressing in women's clothing is symbolically castrating himself of his phallic privilege. A woman dressing in men's clothing is symbolically laying claim to the power of masculinity, a marginally more acceptable activity.
Feminist advocacy for social change has done much to relax the constrictions of gender roles on men and women, but they are still heavily policed.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, Routledge, New York, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam, Judith, Female Masculinity, Duke University Press, Durham and London, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Julia, Straub, Kristina; Eds, Body Guards: The Cultural Politics of Gender Ambiguity, Routledge, London, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
The reason it is so hard to have statistics for female-bodied crossdressers is that the line where non-crossdressing stops and crossdressing begins has become blurred, whereas the same line for men is just as defined. This is one of the many issues being addressed by third wave feminism as well as the modern-day [[masculism|masculist]] movement.

Some psychoanalysts today do not regard cross-dressing by itself a psychological problem, unless it interferes with the functioning of a person's life. &quot;For instance,&quot; said Dr. [[Joseph Merlino (doctor)|Joseph Merlino]], Senior Editor of the book ''Freud at 150: 21st Century Essays on a Man of Genius'', &quot;[suppose that]...I'm a cross-dresser and I don't want to keep it confined to my circle of friends, or my party circle, and I want to take that to my wife and I don't understand why she doesn't accept it, or I take it to my office and I don't understand why they don't accept it, then it's become a problem because it's interfering with my relationships and environment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[n:Dr. Joseph Merlino on sexuality, insanity, Freud, fetishes and apathy#Gender identity and Heteronormativity|Interview with Dr. Joseph Merlino]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', October 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tunnel carries high-speed [[Eurostar]] passenger trains, [[Eurotunnel Shuttle]] [[roll-on/roll-off]] vehicle transport—the largest in the world—and international rail [[freight train]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm&quot; /&gt; The tunnel connects end-to-end with the [[LGV Nord]] and [[High Speed 1]] high-speed railway lines.

In 1802, French mining engineer [[Albert Mathieu]] put forward a proposal to tunnel under the English Channel, with illumination from oil lamps, horse-drawn coaches, and an artificial island mid-Channel for changing horses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whiteside p17&quot;&gt;Whiteside p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1830s, Frenchman [[Aimé Thomé de Gamond]] performed the first geological and hydrographical surveys on the Channel, between Calais and Dover. Thomé de Gamond explored several schemes and, in 1856, he presented a proposal to [[Napoleon III]] for a mined railway tunnel from Cap [[Gris-Nez]] to [[Eastwater Point]] with a port/airshaft on the [[Varne sandbank]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Whiteside p18-23&quot;&gt;Whiteside pp. 18–23&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of 170&amp;nbsp;million [[French franc|franc]]s, or less than £7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times 1866&quot;&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A00EFD9133DE53BBC4F53DFBE66838D679FDE | title = The Proposed Tunnel Between England and France |work=The New York Times | date = 7 August 1866 | accessdate = 3 January 2008 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Channel Tunnel 1856 idea from Gamond 1a.png|thumb|left|Thomé de Gamond's 1856 plan for a cross-Channel link, with a port/airshaft on the [[Varne sandbank]] mid-Channel]]

In 1865, a deputation led by [[George Ward Hunt]] proposed the idea of a tunnel to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] of the day, [[William Ewart Gladstone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;William Gladstone 1888&quot;&gt;{{ cite book | last = Gladstone | first = William | authorlink = William Ewart Gladstone | editor = A.

W. E. Gladstone, M.P. | volume = X | accessdate = 13 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1867, [[William Low]] and [[John Hawkshaw|Sir John Clarke Hawkshaw]] promoted ideas, but none were implemented. An official Anglo-French protocol was established in 1876 for a cross-Channel railway tunnel. In 1881, British railway entrepreneur [[Edward Watkin|Sir William Watkin]] and French [[Suez Canal]] contractor [[Alexandre Lavalley]] were in the [[Anglo-French Submarine Railway Company]] that conducted exploratory work on both sides of the Channel. On the English side a {{convert|2.13|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter Beaumont-English boring machine dug a {{convert|1893|m|ft|0||adj=on}} pilot tunnel from [[Shakespeare Cliff]]. On the French side, a similar machine dug {{convert|1669|m|ft|abbr=on}} from [[Sangatte]]. The project was abandoned in May 1882, owing to British political and press campaigns advocating that a tunnel would compromise Britain's national defences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot; /&gt; These early works were encountered more than a century later during the TML project.

In 1919, during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] repeatedly brought up the idea of a Channel tunnel as a way of reassuring France about British willingness to defend against another German attack.  The French did not take the idea seriously and nothing came of Lloyd George's proposal.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan, Margaret. &quot;Paris 1919&quot;. Random House, 2002, p. 174, 194&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, defence arguments were accepted to be irrelevant because of the dominance of air power; thus, both the British and French governments supported technical and geological surveys. Construction work commenced on both sides of the Channel in 1974, a government-funded project using twin tunnels on either side of a service tunnel, with capability for car shuttle wagons. In January 1975, to the dismay of the French partners, the British government cancelled the project. The government had changed to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and there was uncertainty about [[European Economic Community|EEC]] membership, cost estimates had ballooned to 200% and the national economy was troubled. By this time the British Priestly tunnel boring machine was ready and the Ministry of Transport was able to do a {{convert|300|m|abbr=on}} experimental drive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot; /&gt; This short tunnel would however be reused as the starting and access point for tunnelling operations from the British side.

In 1979, the &quot;Mouse-hole Project&quot; was suggested when the Conservatives came to power in Britain. The concept was a single-track rail tunnel with a service tunnel, but without shuttle terminals. The British government took no interest in funding the project, but Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] said she had no objection to a privately funded project. In 1981 British and French leaders Margaret Thatcher and [[François Mitterrand]] agreed to set up a working group to look into a privately funded project, and in April 1985 promoters were formally invited to submit scheme proposals. Four submissions were shortlisted:

* a rail proposal based on the 1975 scheme presented by Channel Tunnel Group/France–Manche (CTG/F–M),
* Eurobridge: a {{convert|4.5|km|abbr=on}} span [[suspension bridge]] with a roadway in an enclosed tube
* Euroroute: a {{convert|21|km|abbr=on}} tunnel between artificial islands approached by bridges, and
* Channel Expressway: large diameter road tunnels with mid-channel ventilation towers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot; /&gt;

The cross-Channel ferry industry protested under the name &quot;Flexilink&quot;. In 1975 there was no campaign protesting against a fixed link, with one of the largest ferry operators (Sealink) being state-owned. Flexilink continued rousing opposition throughout 1986 and 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot; /&gt; Public opinion strongly favoured a drive-through tunnel, but ventilation issues, concerns about accident management, and fear of driver mesmerisation led to the only shortlisted rail submission, CTG/F-M, being awarded the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot;&gt;Wilson pp. 14–21&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrangement ===
[[File:Channel Tunnel project relations flow chart 1.svg|thumb|A block diagram describing the organisation structure used on the project. Eurotunnel is the central organisation for construction and operation (via a concession) of the tunnel]]

The British ''Channel Tunnel Group'' consisted of two banks and five construction companies, while their French counterparts, ''France–Manche'', consisted of three banks and five construction companies. The role of the banks was to advise on financing and secure loan commitments. On 2 July 1985, the groups formed Channel Tunnel Group/France–Manche (CTG/F–M). Their submission to the British and French governments was drawn from the 1975 project, including 11&amp;nbsp;volumes and a substantial environmental impact statement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot; /&gt;

The design and construction was done by the ten construction companies in the CTG/F-M group. The French terminal and boring from Sangatte was undertaken by the five French construction companies in the joint venture group ''GIE Transmanche Construction''. The English Terminal and boring from Shakespeare Cliff was undertaken by the five British construction companies in the ''Trankslink Joint Venture''. The two partnerships were linked by [[TransManche Link]] (TML), a bi-national project organisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot; /&gt; The Maître d'Oeuvre was a supervisory engineering body employed by Eurotunnel under the terms of the concession that monitored project activity and reported back to the governments and banks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.10–11&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, with its long tradition of infrastructure investment, the project garnered widespread approval and in April the French National Assembly gave unanimous support and, in June 1987, after a public inquiry, the Senate gave unanimous support. In Britain, select committees examined the proposal, making history by holding hearings outside of Westminster, in Kent. In February 1987, the third reading of the Channel Tunnel Bill took place in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and was carried by 94&amp;nbsp;votes to 22. The [[Channel Tunnel Act 1987|Channel Tunnel Act]] gained [[Royal assent]] and passed into English law in July of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot; /&gt; Parliamentary support for the project came partly from provincial members of Parliament on the basis of promises of [[regional Eurostar]] through train services that have never materialised; the promises were repeated in 1996 when the contract for construction of the [[Channel Tunnel Rail Link]] was awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Parliamentary note on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link| url = http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snbt-00070.pdf |publisher=[[House of Commons Library]] | accessdate = 5 April 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Channel Tunnel is a build-own-operate-transfer ([[BOOT]]) project with a concession.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 96/97&quot;&gt;Flyvbjerg et al. pp.&amp;nbsp;96–97&lt;/ref&gt; TML would design and build the tunnel, but financing was through a separate legal entity: Eurotunnel. Eurotunnel absorbed CTG/F-M and signed a construction contract with TML; however, the British and French governments controlled final engineering and safety decisions, which are now in the hands of the [[Channel Tunnel Safety Authority]]. The British and French governments gave Eurotunnel a 55- (later 65-) year operating concession to repay loans and pay dividends. A Railway Usage Agreement was signed between Eurotunnel, [[British Rail]] and the [[Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Français]] guaranteeing future revenue in exchange for the railways obtaining half of the tunnel's capacity.

Private funding for such a complex infrastructure project was of unprecedented scale. An initial equity of £45&amp;nbsp;million was raised by CTG/F-M, increased by £206&amp;nbsp;million private institutional placement, £770&amp;nbsp;million was raised in a public share offer that included press and television advertisements, a syndicated bank loan and [[letter of credit]] arranged £5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot; /&gt; Privately financed, the total investment costs at 1985 prices were £2600&amp;nbsp;million. At the 1994 completion actual costs were, in 1985 prices, £4650&amp;nbsp;million: an 80% cost overrun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 12&quot;&gt;Flyvbjerg et al. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The cost overrun was partly due to enhanced safety, security, and environmental demands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 96/97&quot; /&gt; Financing costs were 140% higher than forecast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 3&quot;&gt;Flyvbjerg et al. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction ===

Eleven [[tunnel boring machine]]s, working from both sides (England to France) of the Channel, cut through chalk [[marl]] to construct two rail tunnels and a service tunnel. The vehicle shuttle terminals are at [[Cheriton, Kent|Cheriton]] (part of [[Folkestone]]) and Coquelles, and are connected to the English and French motorways ([[M20 motorway|M20]] and [[A16 motorway (France)|A16]] respectively).

Tunnelling commenced in 1988, and the tunnel began operating in 1994.&lt;ref name ='BBConthisday'&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/1/newsid_2516000/2516473.stm | title = On this day: Tunnel links UK and Europe | publisher=BBC News | accessdate = 19 July 2009 | date = 1 December 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 prices, the total construction cost was [[Pound sterling|£]]4.650&amp;nbsp;billion (equivalent to £{{Inflation|UK|4.65|1985}}&amp;nbsp;billion today), an 80% cost overrun. At the peak of construction 15,000&amp;nbsp;people were employed with daily expenditure over £3&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson Story p xvi-xvii&quot;&gt;Anderson, pp. xvi–xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Ten workers, eight of them British, were killed during construction between 1987 and 1993, most in the first few months of boring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harlow&quot;&gt;{{ cite news | first = John | last = Harlow | title = Phantom Trains Wreak Havoc in Channel Tunnel |work=The Times |location=UK | date = 2 April 1995 | accessdate = 19 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ingenious 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ingenious.org.uk/Read/Identity/RailwaysandIdentity/Navvies/ | title = ingenious: Navvies | date = 11 March 2008 | publisher=ingenious | accessdate = 19 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/thirteen-workers-die-as-safety-standards-are-ignored-in-race-to-build-olympic-sites-558698.html | title = Thirteen workers die as safety standards are ignored in race to build Olympic sites |work=The Independent |location=UK | accessdate = 26 September 2008 | location=London | date=3 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Completion ===
[[File:Channel Tunnel Opening Ceremony.jpg|thumb|The Channel Tunnel was opened in Calais on 6 May 1994 by British Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] and French President [[François Mitterrand]]]]

Surveying undertaken in the twenty years before tunnel construction confirmed earlier speculations that a tunnel route could be bored through a chalk marl stratum. The chalk marl was conducive to tunnelling, with impermeability, ease of excavation and strength. While on the English side the chalk marl ran along the entire length of the tunnel, on the French side a length of {{convert|5|km|mi|0}} had variable and difficult geology. The Channel Tunnel consists of three bores: two {{convert|7.6|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter rail tunnels, {{convert|30|m|ft|0}} apart, {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} in length with a {{convert|4.8|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter service tunnel in between. There are also cross-passages and piston relief ducts. The service tunnel was used as a pilot tunnel, boring ahead of the main tunnels to determine the conditions. English access was provided at Shakespeare Cliff, while French access came from a shaft at Sangatte. The French side used five [[tunnel boring machine]]s (TBMs), the English side used six. The service tunnel uses Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) and Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS). Fire safety was a critical design issue.

Between the portals at Beussingue and [[Castle Hill, Folkestone|Castle Hill]] the tunnel is {{convert|50.5|km|mi|0}} long, with {{convert|3.3|km|mi|0}} under land on the French side, {{convert|9.3|km|mi|0}} under land on the UK side and {{convert|37.9|km|mi|0}} under sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICE p. 95&quot;&gt;Institute of Civil Engineers p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the Channel Tunnel the second longest rail tunnel in the world, behind the [[Seikan Tunnel]] in Japan, but with the longest under-sea section.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Post 2006&quot;&gt;{{ cite news | first = Jane | last = Gilbert | title = `Chunnel' workers link France and Britain |work=The Daily Post (New Zealand) | publisher=APN New Zealand Ltd | date = 1 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average depth is {{convert|45|m|ft|0}} below the seabed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.13&quot;&gt;Kirkland p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; On the UK side, of the expected {{convert|5|e6m3|e6cuyd|lk=on}} of spoil approximately {{convert|1|e6m3|e6cuyd}} was used for fill at the terminal site, and the remainder was deposited at Lower Shakespeare Cliff behind a seawall, [[land reclamation|reclaiming]] {{convert|74|acre|ha|0}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson Story p xvi-xvii&quot; /&gt; of land.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICE p. 208&quot;&gt;Institute of Civil Engineers p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; This land was then made into the [[Samphire Hoe Country Park]]. Environmental impact assessment did not identify any major risks for the project, and further studies into safety, noise, and air pollution were overall positive. However, environmental objections were raised over a high-speed link to London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 51&quot;&gt;Flyvbjerg et al. p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geology ===
[[File:Channel Tunnel geological profile 1.svg|thumb|250px|Geological profile along the tunnel as constructed. For the majority of its length the tunnel bores through a chalk marl stratum (layer)]]

Successful tunnelling under the channel required a sound understanding of the topography and geology and the selection of the best rock strata through which to tunnel. The geology generally consists of northeasterly dipping Cretaceous strata, part of the northern limb of the Wealden-Boulonnais dome. Characteristics include:

* Continuous chalk on the cliffs on either side of the Channel containing no major faulting, as observed by [[Verstegan]] in 1698
* Four geological [[stratum|strata]], marine sediments laid down 90–100&amp;nbsp;million years ago; pervious upper and middle chalk above slightly pervious lower chalk and finally impermeable [[Gault Clay]]. A sandy stratum, glauconitic marl (tortia), is in between the chalk marl and gault clay
* A {{convert|25|–|30|m|adj=on}} layer of chalk marl (French: ''craie bleue'') in the lower third of the lower chalk appeared to present the best tunnelling medium. The chalk has a clay content of 30–40% providing impermeability to groundwater yet relatively easy excavation with strength allowing minimal support. Ideally the tunnel would be bored in the bottom {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} of the chalk marl, allowing water inflow from fractures and joints to be minimised, but above the gault clay that would increase stress on the tunnel lining and swell and soften when wet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eng Geol&quot;&gt;{{ cite book | title = Engineering Geology of the Channel Tunnel | editor = Harris, C.S. et al. | year = 1996 | publisher=Thomas Telford | location = London | isbn = 0727720457 | page = 57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the English side of the channel, the strata [[Strike and dip|dip]] less than 5°, however, on the French side, this increases to 20°. Jointing and faulting is present on both the English and French sides. On the English side, only minor faults of displacement less than {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} exist. On the French side, displacements of up to {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} are present owing to the Quenocs [[anticline|anticlinal]] [[fold (geology)|fold]]. The faults are of limited width, filled with calcite, pyrite and remoulded clay. The increased dip and faulting restricted the selection of route on the French side. To avoid confusion, microfossil assemblages were used to classify the chalk marl. On the French side, particularly near the coast, the chalk was harder, and more brittle, and more fractured than on the English side. This led to the adoption of different tunnelling techniques on the French and English sides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland geol pp.21–50&quot; /&gt;

The Quaternary undersea valley Fosse Dangaered, and [[Castle Hill, Folkestone|Castle Hill]] landslip, located at the English portal, caused concerns. Identified by the 1964–65 geophysical survey, the Fosse Dangaered is an infilled valley system extending {{convert|80|m|ft|0}} below the seabed, {{convert|500|m|ft|0}} south of the tunnel route, located mid-channel. A 1986 survey showed that a tributary crossed the path of the tunnel, and so the tunnel route was made as far north and deep as possible. The English terminal had to be located in the Castle Hill landslip, which consists of displaced and tipping blocks of lower chalk, glauconitic marl and gault debris. Thus the area was stabilised by buttressing and inserting drainage adits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland geol pp.21–50&quot; /&gt; The service tunnels were pilot tunnels preceding the main tunnels, so that the geology, areas of crushed rock, and zones of high water inflow could be predicted. Exploratory probing took place in the service tunnels, in the form of extensive forward probing, vertical downward probes and sideways probing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland geol pp.21–50&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 21–50&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surveying ===

Marine soundings and samplings by Thomé de Gamond were carried out during 1833–1867, establishing the seabed depth at a maximum of {{convert|55|m}} and the continuity of geological strata (layers). Surveying continued over many years, with 166&amp;nbsp;marine and 70&amp;nbsp;land-deep boreholes being drilled and over 4,000-line-kilometres of marine geophysical survey completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland geol pp.22–26&quot; /&gt; Surveys were undertaken in 1958–1959, 1964–1965, 1972–1974 and 1986–1988.

The surveying in 1958–1959 catered for [[immersed tube]] and bridge designs as well as a bored tunnel, and thus a wide area was investigated. At this time marine geophysics surveying for engineering projects was in its infancy, with poor positioning and resolution from seismic profiling. The 1964–1965 surveys concentrated on a northerly route that left the English coast at Dover harbour; using 70&amp;nbsp;boreholes, an area of deeply weathered rock with high [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] was located just south of Dover harbour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland geol pp.22–26&quot; /&gt;

Given the previous survey results and access constraints, a more southerly route was investigated in the 1972–1973 survey and the route was confirmed to be feasible. Information for the tunnelling project also came from work before the 1975 cancellation. On the French side at Sangatte a deep shaft with [[adit]]s was made. On the English side at Shakespeare Cliff, the government allowed {{convert|250|m|ft|0}} of {{convert|4.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter tunnel to be driven. The actual tunnel alignment, method of excavation and support were essentially the same as the 1975 attempt. In the 1986–1997 survey, previous findings were reinforced and the nature of the gault clay and the tunnelling medium (chalk marl that made up 85% of the route) were investigated. Geophysical techniques from the oil industry were employed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland geol pp.22–26&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 22–26&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tunnelling ===
[[File:Eurotunnel schema (empty service).svg|thumb|Typical tunnel cross section, with a service tunnel between twin rail tunnels. Shown linking the rail tunnels is a piston relief duct, necessary to manage pressure changes due to the movement of trains]]

Tunnelling between England and France was a major engineering challenge, with the only precedent being the undersea [[Seikan Tunnel]] in Japan. A serious risk with underwater tunnels is major water inflow due to the water pressure from the sea above under weak ground conditions. The Channel Tunnel also had the challenge of time—being privately funded, early financial return was paramount.

The objective was to construct: two {{convert|7.6|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter rail tunnels, {{convert|30|m|ft|0}} apart, {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} in length; a {{convert|4.8|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter service tunnel between the two main tunnels; pairs of {{convert|3.3|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter cross-passages linking the rail tunnels to the service tunnel at {{convert|375|m|ft|0|adj=on}} spacing; piston relief ducts {{convert|2|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter connecting the rail tunnels at {{convert|250|m|ft|0|adj=on}} spacing; two undersea crossover caverns to connect the rail tunnels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.63–128&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 63–128&lt;/ref&gt; The service tunnel always preceded the main tunnels by at least {{convert|1|km|mi|1}} to ascertain the ground conditions. There was plenty of experience with tunnelling through chalk in the mining industry. The undersea crossover caverns were a complex engineering problem. The French cavern was based on the [[Mount Baker Tunnel|Mount Baker Ridge]] freeway tunnel in the USA. The UK cavern was dug from the service tunnel ahead of the main tunnels to avoid delay.

Precast segmental linings in the main TBM drives were used, but different solutions were used on the English and French sides. On the French side, neoprene and grout sealed bolted linings made of cast iron or high-strength reinforced concrete were used. On the English side, the main requirement was for speed and bolting of cast-iron lining segments was only carried out in areas of poor geology. In the UK rail tunnels, eight lining segments plus a key segment were used; on the French side, five segments plus a key segment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson p.38&quot;&gt;Wilson p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; On the French side, a {{convert|55|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter {{convert|75|m|ft|0|adj=on}} deep grout-curtained shaft at Sangatte was used for access. On the English side, a marshalling area was {{convert|140|m|ft|0}} below the top of Shakespeare Cliff, and the [[New Austrian Tunnelling method]] (NATM) was first applied in the chalk marl here. On the English side, the land tunnels were driven from Shakespeare Cliff, the same place as the marine tunnels, not from Folkestone. The platform at the base of the cliff was not large enough for all of the drives and, despite environmental objections, tunnel spoil was placed behind a reinforced concrete seawall, on condition of placing the chalk in an enclosed lagoon to avoid wide dispersal of chalk fines. Owing to limited space, the precast lining factory was on the Isle of Grain in the Thames estuary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.63–128&quot; /&gt;

On the French side, owing to the greater permeability to water, earth pressure balance TBMs with open and closed modes were used. The TBMs were of a closed nature during the initial {{convert|5|km|mi|0}}, but then operated as open, boring through the chalk marl stratum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.63–128&quot; /&gt; This minimised the impact to the ground and allowed high water pressures to be withstood, and it also alleviated the need to grout ahead of the tunnel. The French effort required five TBMs: two main marine machines, one main land machine (the short land drives of 3&amp;nbsp;km allowed one TBM to complete the first drive then reverse direction and complete the other), and two service tunnel machines. On the English side, the simpler geology allowed faster open-faced TBMs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland geol pp.29&quot;&gt;Kirkland p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Six machines were used, all commenced digging from Shakespeare Cliff, three marine-bound and three for the land tunnels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.63–128&quot; /&gt; Towards the completion of the undersea drives, the UK TBMs were driven steeply downwards and buried clear of the tunnel. The French TBMs then completed the tunnel and were dismantled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson p. 44&quot;&gt;Wilson p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; A 900&amp;nbsp;mm gauge railway was used on the English side during construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.117–128&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 117–128&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the English machines, which were simply given alphanumeric names, the French tunnelling machines were all named after women: Brigitte, Europa, Catherine, Virginie, Pascaline, Séverine.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite article | url = http://pagesperso-orange.fr/batisseurs-tunnel/3tunnels.pdf | author=Pierre-Jean Pompee | title = Channel Tunnel: Tunnel's Construction | publisher=pagesperso-orange.fr | accessdate = 19 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Railway design ===
[[File:ETunnelhoch.jpg|thumb|Interior of [[Eurotunnel Shuttle]], a vehicle shuttle train. The largest railway wagons in the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson Story p xvi-xvii&quot; /&gt; the shuttle trains transport vehicles between terminals on either side of the tunnel]]

==== Communications ====

There are three communication systems in the tunnel: concession radio (CR) for mobile vehicles and personnel within Eurotunnel's Concession (terminals, tunnels, coastal shafts); track-to-train radio (TTR) for secure speech and data between trains and the railway control centre; Shuttle internal radio (SIR) for communication between shuttle crew and to passengers over car radios.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.129–132&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 129–132&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Power supply ====

All tunnel services run on electricity, shared equally from English and French sources. Power is delivered to the locomotives via an [[overhead line]] (catenary)&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.134–148&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 134–148&lt;/ref&gt; at [[25 kV AC railway electrification|{{nowrap|25 kV 50 Hz}}]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wiki_railelectric&quot;&gt;Article: Railway electric traction 9 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A large proportion of the railway south of London uses a 750&amp;nbsp;V&amp;nbsp;DC [[third rail]] to deliver electrical power; however since the opening of High Speed 1 there is no need to use the third rail system for any part of the Eurostar journey. High Speed 1, the tunnel itself and the route to Paris has power provided via overhead catenary at 25&amp;nbsp;kV&amp;nbsp;50&amp;nbsp;Hz. The railways on &quot;classic&quot; lines in Belgium are also electrified by overhead catenaries, but at 3000&amp;nbsp;V&amp;nbsp;DC.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiki_railelectric&quot; /&gt;

==== Signalling ====

A cab signalling system is used that gives information directly to train drivers on a display. There is [[Automatic Train Protection]] (ATP) that stops the train if the speed differs from that indicated on the in-cab display. [[Transmission Voie-Machine|TVM430]], as used on [[LGV Nord]], is used in the tunnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.149–155&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 149–155&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum allowed speed is {{nowrap|160&amp;nbsp;km/h}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiki_de-eurotunnel&quot;&gt;Article-de: Eurotunnel#Betrieb 9 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Track system ====

The American Sonneville International Corporation track system consisting of UIC60 rails on 900A grade resting on microcellular [[Ethylene-vinyl acetate|EVA]]&lt;!--Correct disambig?--&gt; pads, bolted into concrete was chosen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.157–174&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 157–174&lt;/ref&gt; The larger European GB+ [[loading gauge]] was used rather than one of the smaller UK alternatives; this gauge is maintained on High Speed 1 as far as [[Barking]] in east London.&lt;ref name=DfTlong&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/strategyfinance/strategy/freightnetwork/ | title = Strategic Freight Network: The Longer-Term Vision | publisher=Department for Transport | accessdate = 17 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ballasted track was ruled out owing to maintenance constraints and a need for geometric stability.

=== Rolling stock ===

==== Eurotunnel Shuttle ====
{{Main|Eurotunnel Shuttle|Eurotunnel Class 9}}

Initially 38&amp;nbsp;Le Shuttle locomotives were commissioned, working in pairs with one at each end of a shuttle train. The shuttles have two separate halves: single and double deck. Each half has two loading/unloading wagons and twelve carrier wagons. Eurotunnel's original order was for nine tourist shuttles.

HGV shuttles also have two halves, with each half containing one loading wagon, one unloading wagon and 14&amp;nbsp;carrier wagons. There is a club car behind the leading locomotive. Eurotunnel originally ordered six HGV shuttles rakes.

==== Freight locomotives ====
{{See also|British Rail Class 92}}

Forty-six Class 92 locomotives for hauling freight trains and overnight passenger trains (the [[Nightstar (train)|Nightstar]] project, which was abandoned) were commissioned, which can run on both overhead AC and [[third rail|third-rail]] DC power.

==== International passenger ====
{{Main|British Rail Class 373}}

Thirty-one Eurostar trains—based on the [[Train à Grande Vitesse|French TGV]]—built to UK [[loading gauge]], and with many modifications for safety within the tunnel, were commissioned, with split ownership between British Rail, [[SNCF|French National Railway Company]] and [[National Railway Company of Belgium]]. [[British Rail]] ordered seven more for services north of London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.175–211&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 175–211&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2009, extensive fire-proofing requirements were dropped and [[Deutsche Bahn]] received permission to run German [[Intercity-Express]] (ICE) trains through the Channel Tunnel in the future. On 19 October 2010 Deutsche Bahn ran the first ICE train through the Channel Tunnel arriving in St. Pancras after evacuation tests in the tunnel were a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5018915,00.html?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf | title = Deutsche Bahn gets access to Channel Tunnel|work=Deutsche Welle | date = 16 December 2009 | accessdate = 20 December 2009 | first = Sam | last = Edmonds }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.austinnews.net/story/578370 | title = Deutsche Bahn allowed through chunnel|work=Austin News | date = 16 December 2009 | accessdate = 20 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=October 2010}}

==== Service locomotives ====

[[Diesel locomotive]]s for rescue and shunting work are [[Eurotunnel Class 0001]] and [[Eurotunnel Class 0031]].

== Operation ==
=== Usage and services ===
[[File:Chunnel traffic.svg|thumb|A Channel Tunnel traffic graph showing the number of passengers and [[tonnes]] of freight. Freight vehicle shuttle numbers dropped in 1996/7 owing to closure of the service after the November 1996 fire]]
[[File:Channel Tunnel Terminal.jpg|thumb|The British terminal at [[Cheriton, Kent|Cheriton]] in west Folkestone. The terminal services shuttle trains that carry vehicles, and is linked to the [[M20 motorway]]]]
[[File:Folkestone White Horse cropped.jpg|thumb|The [[Folkestone White Horse]] is the last view of England for most passengers embarking at the Cheriton terminal]]

Services offered by the tunnel are:

* [[Eurotunnel Shuttle]] (formerly Le Shuttle) roll-on roll-off shuttle service for road vehicles,
* [[Eurostar]] passenger trains,
* through freight trains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm&quot;&gt;{{ cite book | title = Britain on the edge of Europe | last = Chisholm | first = Michael | year = 1995 | publisher=Routledge | location = London | isbn = 0415119219 | page = 151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the freight and passenger traffic forecasts that led to the construction of the tunnel were largely and universally overestimated. Particularly, Eurotunnel's commissioned forecasts were over-predictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 22&quot; /&gt; Although the captured share of Channel crossings (competing with air and sea) was forecast correctly, high competition and reduced tariffs has led to low revenue. Overall cross-Channel traffic was overestimated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anguera 2006&quot; /&gt;

However with the [[European Union|EU's]] liberalisation of international rail services, the tunnel and [[High Speed 1]] have been open to competition since 2010. There have been a number of [[High Speed 1#Future operations|operators interested in running services]] including [[Deutsche Bahn]], through the tunnel and along [[High Speed 1]] to London.

==== Passenger traffic volumes ====

Total cross-tunnel passenger traffic volumes peaked at 18.4&amp;nbsp;million in 1998, then dropped to 14.9&amp;nbsp;million in 2003, from then rising again to 17.0&amp;nbsp;million in 2010.

At the time of the decision about building the tunnel, 15.9&amp;nbsp;million passengers were predicted for Eurostar trains in the opening year. In 1995, the first full year, actual numbers were a little over 2.9&amp;nbsp;million, growing to 7.1&amp;nbsp;million in 2000, then dropping again to 6.3&amp;nbsp;million in 2003. However, Eurostar was also limited by the lack of a high-speed connection on the British side. After the completion of [[High Speed 1]] (formerly CTRL) to London in two stages in 2003 and 2007, traffic increased. In 2008, Eurostar carried 9,113,371 passengers in cross-Channel-Tunnel traffic, a 10% increase over the previous year, despite traffic limitations due to the [[2008 Channel Tunnel fire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ETreport2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurotunnel.com | title = Eurotunnel 2008 traffic and revenue figures | date = 15 January 2009 | publisher=[[Eurotunnel]] | accessdate = 15 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eurostar passenger numbers continued to increase, reaching 9,528,558 in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;ETtraffic2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurotunnelgroup.com/uploadedFiles/assets-uk/Media/Press-Releases/2011-Press-Releases/110118Eurotunnel-traffic-and-revenue.pdf |title=Eurotunnel 2010 traffic and revenue figures |date=2011-01-18 |publisher=Eurotunnel |accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Freight traffic volumes ====

Cross-tunnel freight traffic volumes have been erratic, with a decrease during 1997 due to a closure caused by a fire in a freight shuttle. The total freight crossings increased over the period, indicating the substitutability of the tunnel by sea crossings. The tunnel has achieved a cross-Channel freight traffic market share close to or above Eurotunnel's 1980s predictions but Eurotunnel's 1990 and 1994 predictions were overestimates.

For freight transported on through freight trains, the first year freight prediction was 7.2&amp;nbsp;million gross tonnes, however, the actual 1995 figure was 1.3&amp;nbsp;million gross tonnes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 22&quot;&gt;Flyvbjerg et al. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Through freight volumes peaked in 1998 at 3.1&amp;nbsp;million tonnes. However, with continuing problems, this figure fell back to 1.21&amp;nbsp;million tonnes in 2007, increasing again slightly to 1.24&amp;nbsp;million tonnes in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;ETreport2008&quot; /&gt; Together with that carried on freight shuttles, freight traffic growth has occurred since opening, with 6.4&amp;nbsp;million tonnes carried in 1995, 18.4&amp;nbsp;million tonnes recorded in 2003&lt;ref name=&quot;Anguera 2006&quot; /&gt; and 19.6&amp;nbsp;million tonnes in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;ETtraffic5yr&quot; /&gt; Numbers fell back in the wake of the 2008 fire.

Eurotunnel's freight subsidiary is [[Europorte 2]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AFX Europorte&quot;&gt;{{ cite news | title = Eurotunnel gets backing for freight service |work=AFX | publisher=Agence France Presse | date = 28 October 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006 EWS, the UK's largest rail freight operator, announced that owing to cessation of UK-French government subsidies of £52&amp;nbsp;million per annum to cover the Channel Tunnel &quot;Minimum User Charge&quot; (a subsidy of around £13,000 per train, at a traffic level of 4,000&amp;nbsp;trains per annum), freight trains would stop running after 30 November.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times cash row&quot;&gt;{{ cite news |url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article626416.ece | title = Chunnel cash row threatens freight trains | author=Dominic O'Connell |work=The Times |location=UK | date = 3 September 2006 | accessdate = 3 September 2006 | location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economic performance ====

Shares in Eurotunnel were issued at £3.50 per share on 9 December 1987. By mid-1989 the price had risen to £11.00. Delays and cost overruns led to the share price dropping; during demonstration runs in October 1994 the share price reached an all-time low value. Eurotunnel suspended payment on its debt in September 1995 to avoid bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite article | url = http://www.josephcoates.com/pdf_files/268_Megaprojects_and_Risk.pdf | title = Megaprojects and Risk: An Anatomy of Ambition | publisher=josephcoates.com | accessdate = 19 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1997 the British and French governments extended Eurotunnel's operating concession by 34&amp;nbsp;years to 2086. Financial restructuring of Eurotunnel occurred in mid-1998, reducing debt and financial charges. Despite the restructuring ''[[The Economist]]'' reported in 1998 that to break even Eurotunnel would have to increase fares, traffic and market share for sustainability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 32–34&quot;&gt;Flyvbjerg et al. pp. 32–34&lt;/ref&gt; A cost benefit analysis of the Channel Tunnel indicated that there were few impacts on the wider economy and few developments associated with the project, and that the British economy would have been better off if the tunnel had not been constructed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anguera 2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg&quot;&gt;{{ cite book | author=Flyvbjerg, B. Buzelius, N. Rothengatter, W | year = 2003 | title = Megaprojects and Risk | location = Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | pp = 68–69 | isbn = 0521009464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the terms of the Concession, Eurotunnel was obliged to investigate a cross-Channel road tunnel. In December 1999 road and rail tunnel proposals were presented to the British and French governments, but it was stressed that there was not enough demand for a second tunnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Second Link Birm&quot;&gt;{{ cite news | title = Eurotunnel unveils plans for second link | publisher=[[Birmingham Post]] | date = 6 January 2000 | accessdate = 19 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A three-way treaty between the United Kingdom, France and Belgium governs border controls, with the establishment of ''control zones'' wherein the officers of the other nation may exercise limited customs and law enforcement powers. For most purposes these are at either end of the tunnel, with the French border controls on the UK side of the tunnel and vice versa. For certain city-to-city trains, the train itself represents a control zone.&lt;ref name=&quot;CPS zones&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/section2/chapter_f.html#_Toc44570638 | title = The CPS: Channel Tunnel | accessdate = 11 March 2008 |work=Crown Prosecution Service }}&lt;/ref&gt; A binational emergency plan coordinates UK and French emergency activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.311&quot;&gt;Kirkland p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminals ==
[[File:Chargement voiture Eurotunnel.jpg|thumb|A [[Eurovan (PSA/Fiat joint venture)#Second generation|Peugeot 807]] entering a shuttle wagon at the French terminal at [[Coquelles]] near [[Calais]] in northern France]]

The terminals sites are at Cheriton (Folkestone in the United Kingdom) and Coquelles (Calais in France). The terminals are unique facilities designed to transfer vehicles from the motorway onto trains at a rate of 700&amp;nbsp;cars and 113&amp;nbsp;heavy vehicles per hour. The UK site uses the [[M20 motorway]]. The terminals are organised with the frontier controls juxtaposed with the entry to the system to allow travellers to go onto the motorway at the destination country immediately after leaving the shuttle. The area of the UK site was severely constrained and the design was challenging. The French layout was achieved more easily. To achieve design output, the shuttles accept cars on double-decks; for flexibility, ramps were placed inside the shuttles to provide access to the top decks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.255–270&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 255–270&lt;/ref&gt; At Folkestone there are {{convert|20|km|mi|0}} of mainline track and 45&amp;nbsp;turnouts with eight platforms. At Calais there are {{convert|30|km|mi|0}} of track with 44&amp;nbsp;turnouts. At the terminals the shuttle trains traverse a figure eight to reduce uneven wear on the wheels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.157–174&quot; /&gt; There is a freight marshalling yard west of Cheriton at [[Dollands Moor Freight Yard]].

== Regional impact ==

A 1996 report from the [[European Commission]] predicted that [[Kent]] and [[Nord-Pas de Calais]] had to face increased traffic volumes due to general growth of cross-Channel traffic and traffic attracted by the tunnel. In Kent, a high-speed rail line to London would transfer traffic from road to rail.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU reg impact 220-222&quot;&gt;European Commission pp. 220–222&lt;/ref&gt; Kent's regional development would benefit from the tunnel, but being so close to London restricts the benefits. Gains are in the traditional industries and are largely dependent on the development of Ashford International passenger station, without which Kent would be totally dependent on London's expansion. Nord-Pas-de-Calais enjoys a strong internal symbolic effect of the Tunnel which results in significant gains in manufacturing.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU reg impact 248-252&quot;&gt;European Commission pp. 248–252&lt;/ref&gt;

The removal of a bottleneck by means like the Channel Tunnel does not necessarily induce economic gains in all adjacent regions, the image of a region being connected to the European high-speed transport and active political response are more important for regional economic development. However, some small-medium enterprises located in the immediate vicinity of the terminal have used the opportunity to re-brand the profile of their business with positive effect, such as ''The New Inn'' at [[Etchinghill, Kent|Etchinghill]] which was able to commercially exploit its unique selling point as being 'the closest pub to the Channel Tunnel'. Tunnel-induced regional development is small compared to general economic growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fayman&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Fayman | first = Sonia | coauthors = Metge, Pierre | year = 1995 |month= September | title = The regional impact of the Channel Tunnel: Qualitative and quantitative analysis |journal=European Planning Studies | volume = 3 |issue= 3 | page = 333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The South East of England is likely to benefit developmentally and socially from faster and cheaper transport to continental Europe, but the benefits are unlikely to be equally distributed throughout the region. The overall environmental impact is almost certainly negative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Button&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Button | first = Kenneth | year = 1990 |month= July | title = The Channel Tunnel: The Economic Implications for the South East of England|journal=The Geographical Journal | volume = 156 |issue= 2 |pages= 187–199|doi= 10.2307/635327 | url = http://jstor.org/stable/635327 | publisher=Blackwell Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five years after the opening of the tunnel, there were few and small impacts on the wider economy, and it was difficult to identify major developments associated with the tunnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 68/69&quot;&gt;Flyvbjerg et al. p.&amp;nbsp;68–69&lt;!--Flybjerg credits this info with Roger Vickerman, &quot;The Channel Tunnel: Methodology and Evidence&quot; 1999--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has been postulated that the British economy would have actually been better off without the costs from the construction project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newstatesman.com/200104020018 | work=New Statesman Special Report | title = Coming soon: the Dome on wheels|location=UK | accessdate=28 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both [[Eurotunnel]] and [[Eurostar]], companies heavily involved in the Channel Tunnel's construction and operation, have had to resort to large amounts of government aid to deal with debts amounted.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/eurotunnel-calls-for-government-support-after-record-acircpound13bn-loss-569459.html | title = Eurotunnel calls for government support after record Â£1.3bn loss|work=The Independent |location=UK | first=Michael | last=Harrison | date = 10 February 2004 | accessdate=21 July 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2917255/Eurotunnel-has-4bn-too-much-debt.html | title = Eurotunnel has £4bn too much debt| work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date = 12 January 2005 | accessdate=21 July 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2006/feb/21/transportintheuk.politics | title = Debt-laden Channel tunnel rail link is 'nationalised'|work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = 21 February 2006 | accessdate=21 July 2009 | location=London | first=Andrew | last=Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eurotunnel has been described as being in a serious situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.adacte.com/economiepolitique/hollandais17062005.doc | title = Facts and figures Eurotunnel 2000-2004/Forecast 2005: Commentry and a suggestion | publisher=Adacte.com | date = June 2005| accessdate=21 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fires ===
{{Main|1996 Channel Tunnel fire|2008 Channel Tunnel fire}}

There have been three fires in the Channel Tunnel that were significant enough to close the tunnel—all on the heavy goods vehicle (HGV) shuttles—and other more minor incidents.

During an &quot;invitation only&quot; testing phase on 9 December 1994, a fire broke out in a Ford Escort car whilst its owner had been loading it on to the upper deck of a tourist shuttle. The fire started at approximately 10:00 with the shuttle train stationary in the Folkestone terminal and was extinguished around 40 minutes later with no passenger injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/fire-raises-channel-tunnel-fears-1389084.html | title = Fire raises Channel Tunnel fears | first = Christian | last = Wolmar | date = 10 December 1994 | accessdate = 25 December 2009|work=The Independent | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 November 1996, a fire broke out on a heavy goods vehicle shuttle wagon in the tunnel but nobody was seriously hurt. The exact cause is unknown,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite article | url = http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/CTSA_ChanTun1996.pdf| publisher=Channel Tunnel Safety Authority | title = Inquiry into the fire on Heavy Goods Vehicle Shuttle 7539 on 18&amp;nbsp;November 1996 |date = May 1997| isbn = 0115519319 | accessdate=21 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was not a Eurotunnel equipment or rolling stock problem; it may have been due to arson of a heavy goods vehicle. It is estimated that the heart of the fire reached {{convert|1000|°C|°F|sigfig=2}}, with the tunnel severely damaged over {{convert|46|m|ft|0|}}, with some {{convert|500|m|ft|0|}} affected to some extent.

=== Train failures ===

On the night of 19/20 February 1996, approximately 1,000 passengers became trapped in the Channel Tunnel when two [[British Rail Class 373]] trains on continent-bound [[Eurostar]] service broke down owing to failures of electronic circuits caused by snow and ice being deposited and then melting on the circuit boards.&lt;ref name=&quot;1996-snow&quot;&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/wrong-kind-of-snow-in-tunnel-1320248.html | title = Wrong kind of snow in tunnel... | last = Wolmar | first = Christian | date = 22 February 1996 |work=The Independent |location=UK | accessdate = 21 December 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 August 2007, an electrical failure lasting six hours caused passengers to be trapped in the tunnel on a Eurotunnel shuttle crossing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/6929713.stm | title = Delays after Channel Tunnel fault | publisher=BBC News | date = 3 August 2007 | accessdate = 14 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 18 December 2009, during the [[December 2009 European snowfall]], five London-bound trains operating [[Eurostar]] services failed inside the tunnel, trapping 2,000 passengers in the tunnel overnight.

=== Asylum and immigration ===

Immigrants and would-be [[asylum seeker]]s have been known to use the tunnel to attempt to enter Britain. By 1997, the problem had already attracted international press attention, and the French [[Red Cross]] opened a refugee centre at [[Sangatte]] in 1999, using a [[warehouse]] once used for tunnel construction; by 2002 it housed up to 1500&amp;nbsp;persons at a time, most of them trying to get to the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;Red Cross&quot;&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.redcross.int/EN/mag/magazine2002_2/sangatte.html | title = Sangatte: A place of hope and despair | author=Pierre Kremer | publisher=The Magazine of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] |date = February 2002| accessdate = 4 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, most came from [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]], but African and [[Eastern Europe]]an countries are also represented.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strangers&quot;&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/saturday_review/story/0,3605,595996,00.html | title = Strangers in a strange land | author=Caryl Phillips |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = 17 November 2001 | accessdate = 4 August 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most migrants who got into Britain found some way to ride a freight train, but others used Eurostar. Though the facilities were fenced, airtight security was deemed impossible; refugees would even jump from bridges onto moving trains. In several incidents people were injured during the crossing; others tampered with railway equipment, causing delays and requiring repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/07/31/immigration.daring/index.html | title = Desperate journeys fraught with danger | author=Avril Stephens | publisher=CNN | date = 31 July 2007 | accessdate = 4 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eurotunnel said it was losing £5m per month because of the problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Notorious&quot;&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://212.58.226.40/1/hi/uk/2003977.stm | title = Europe's most notorious refugee camp | publisher=BBC News | date = 12 July 2002 | accessdate = 5 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A dozen refugees have died in crossing attempts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Red Cross&quot; /&gt;

In 2001 and 2002, several riots broke out at Sangatte and groups of refugees (up to 550 in a December 2001 incident) stormed the fences and attempted to enter ''en masse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/dec/27/immigration.uk | title = Police braced for new tunnel raid | author=Paul Webster |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = 27 December 2007 | accessdate = 4 August 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrants have also arrived as legitimate Eurostar passengers without proper entry papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://migration.ucdavis.edu/MN/more.php?id=1529_0_4_0 | title = UK/Ireland: Asylum (news digest) | publisher=Migration News | date = 1998 (?) | accessdate = 4 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local authorities in both France and the UK called for the closure of Sangatte, and Eurotunnel twice sought an injunction against the centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Red Cross&quot; /&gt; The United Kingdom blamed France for allowing Sangatte to open, and France blamed the UK for its lax asylum rules and the EU for not having a uniform immigration policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Notorious&quot; /&gt; The ''[[cause célèbre]]'' nature of the problem even included journalists detained as they followed refugees onto railway property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.freemedia.at/cms/ipi/freedom_detail.html?country=/KW0001/KW0003/KW0060/&amp;year=2001  | title = 2001 World Press Freedom Review: France | publisher=International Press Institute | accessdate = 4 August 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071024205028/http://www.freemedia.at/cms/ipi/freedom_detail.html?country=/KW0001/KW0003/KW0060/&amp;year=2001 |archivedate = 24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, after the [[European Commission]] told France that it was in breach of European Union rules on the free transfer of goods, because of the delays and closures as a result of its poor security, a double fence was built at a cost of £5&amp;nbsp;million, reducing the numbers of refugees detected each week reaching Britain on goods trains from 250 to almost none.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2282306.stm | title = Sangatte asylum talks due | publisher=BBC News | date = 26 September 2002 | accessdate = 4 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other measures included [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras and increased police patrols.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2017789.stm | title = Tunnel security to be tightened | publisher=BBC News | date = 31 May 2002 | accessdate = 4 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2002, the Sangatte centre was closed after the UK agreed to take some of its refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1408494/Blunkett-reaches-deal-to-shut-Sangatte-camp.html | title = Blunkett reaches deal to shut Sangatte camp | author=Philip Delves Broughton and Andrew Sparrow |work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK | date = 27 September 2002 | accessdate = 25 February 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety ===

The [[Channel Tunnel Safety Authority]] is responsible for some aspects of safety regulation in the tunnel; it reports to the IGC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=1233-01-01
|accessdate=2010-10-30
|title=Channel Tunnel : Safety bodies : About the rail industry : Office of Rail Regulation
|date=2010-10-30
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The service tunnel is used for access to technical equipment in cross-passages and equipment rooms, to provide fresh-air ventilation, and for emergency evacuation. The Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) allows fast access to all areas of the tunnel. The service vehicles are rubber-tyred with a buried guidance wire system. Twenty-four STTS vehicles were made, and are used mainly for maintenance but also for firefighting and in emergencies. &quot;Pods&quot; with different purposes, up to a payload of {{convert|2.5|–|5|tonne|abbr=on}}, are inserted into the side of the vehicles. The STTS vehicles cannot turn around within the tunnel, and are driven from either end. The maximum speed is {{convert|80|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} when the steering is locked. A smaller fleet of fifteen Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS) were introduced to supplement the STTSs. The LADOGS have a short wheelbase with a {{convert|3.4|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} turning circle allowing two-point turns within the service tunnel. Steering cannot be locked like the STTS vehicles, and maximum speed is {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}. Pods up to 1&amp;nbsp;tonne can be loaded onto the rear of the vehicles. Drivers in the tunnel sit on the right, and the vehicles drive on the left. Owing to the risk of French personnel driving on their native right side of the road, sensors in the road vehicles alert the driver if the vehicle strays to the right side of the tunnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.247–254&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 247–254&lt;/ref&gt;

The three tunnels contain {{convert|6000|tonne}} of air that needs to be conditioned for comfort and safety. Air is supplied from [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] buildings at Shakespeare Cliff and Sangatte, with each building capable of full duty providing 100% standby capacity. Supplementary ventilation also exists on either side of the tunnel. In the event of a fire, ventilation is used to keep smoke out of the service tunnel and move smoke in one direction in the main tunnel to give passengers clean air. The Channel Tunnel was the first mainline railway tunnel to have special cooling equipment. Heat is generated from traction equipment and drag. The design limit was set at {{convert|30|C|F|sigfig=2}}, using a mechanical cooling system with refrigeration plants on both the English and French sides that run chilled water circulating in pipes within the tunnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.212–230&quot; /&gt;

Trains travelling at high speed create piston-effect pressure changes that can affect passenger comfort, ventilation systems, tunnel doors, fans and the structure of the trains, and drag on the trains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.212–230&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 212–230&lt;/ref&gt; Piston relief [[Duct (HVAC)|ducts]] of {{convert|2|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter were chosen to solve the problem, with 4&amp;nbsp;ducts per kilometre to give close to optimum results. Unfortunately this design led to unacceptable lateral forces on the trains so a reduction in train speed was required and restrictors were installed in the ducts.&lt;ref name=&quot;CT experience&quot;&gt;The Channel Tunnel Experience Lessons for the Future pp. 19–23&lt;/ref&gt;

The safety issue of a fire on a passenger-vehicle shuttle garnered much attention, with Eurotunnel itself noting that fire was the risk gathering the most attention in a 1994 Safety Case for three reasons: ferry companies opposed to passengers being allowed to remain with their cars; [[Home Office]] statistics indicating that car fires had doubled in ten years; and the long length of the tunnel. Eurotunnel commissioned the UK Fire Research Station to give reports of vehicle fires, as well as liaising with Kent Fire Brigade to gather vehicle fire statistics over one year. Fire tests took place at the French Mines Research Establishment with a mock wagon used to investigate how cars burned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.231–240&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 231–240&lt;/ref&gt; The wagon door systems are designed to withstand fire inside the wagon for 30&amp;nbsp;minutes, longer than the transit time of 27&amp;nbsp;minutes. Wagon air conditioning units help to purge dangerous fumes from inside the wagon before travel. Each wagon has a fire detection and extinguishing system, with sensing of ions or ultraviolet radiation, smoke and gases that can trigger [[Haloalkane|halon]] gas to quench a fire. Since the Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) wagons are not covered, fire sensors are located on the loading wagon and in the tunnel itself. A {{convert|10|in|adj=on}} water main in the service tunnel provides water to the main tunnels at {{convert|125|m|ft|0|adj=on}} intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7612776.stm | title = Focus turns to cause of tunnel blaze | publisher=BBC News | accessdate = 12 September 2008 21 | date = 12 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ventilation system can control smoke movement. Special arrival sidings exist to accept a train that is on fire, as the train is not allowed to stop whilst on fire in the tunnel. Eurotunnel has banned a wide range of hazardous goods from travelling in the tunnel. Two STTS vehicles with firefighting pods are on duty at all times, with a maximum delay of 10&amp;nbsp;minutes before they reach a burning train.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland fire&quot; /&gt;

Cyberpunk plots often center on a conflict among [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]]s, [[artificial intelligence]]s, and [[megacorporation]]s, and tend to be set in a near-future [[Earth]], rather than the far-future settings or galactic vistas found in novels such as [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Foundation (novel)|Foundation]]'' or [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graham&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham |first=Stephen |authorlink= |title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=6Oe1m073C-0C&amp;pg=RA2-PT289&amp;dq=cyberpunk+near-future The Cybercities Reader] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=2004 |page=389 |isbn=0415279569}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settings are usually [[post-industrial]] [[dystopia]]s but tend to be marked by extraordinary cultural ferment and the use of technology in ways never anticipated by its creators (&quot;the street finds its own uses for things&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson, William&quot;&gt;[[William Gibson|Gibson, William]] from ''Burning Chrome'' published in 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the genre's atmosphere echoes [[film noir]], and written works in the genre often use techniques from [[detective fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gillis |first=Stacy |authorlink= |title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=bGi9FB3uEXkC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=cyberpunk+film+noir The Matrix Trilogy:Cyberpunk Reloaded] |publisher=Wallflower Press |date=2005 |page=75 |isbn=1904764320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Classic cyberpunk characters were marginalized, alienated loners who lived on the edge of society in generally dystopic futures where daily life was impacted by rapid technological change, an ubiquitous datasphere of computerized information, and invasive modification of the human body.&quot;&amp;nbsp;– [[Lawrence Person]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;''[http://slashdot.org/features/99/10/08/2123255.shtml Notes Toward a Postcyberpunk Manifesto]''&amp;nbsp;– [[Lawrence Person|Person, Lawrence]] first published in ''Nova Express'' issue 16, 1998, later posted to [[Slashdot]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Style and ethos ==
Primary exponents of the cyberpunk field include [[William Gibson]], [[Neal Stephenson]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Pat Cadigan]], [[Rudy Rucker]], and [[John Shirley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/00-01/0003637k/project/html/litaut.htm |title=The Cyberpunk Movement&amp;nbsp;– Cyberpunk authors |publisher=Hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many influential films such as ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and the [[The Matrix series|''Matrix'' trilogy]] can be seen as prominent examples of the cyberpunk style and theme.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graham&quot;/&gt; [[Computer game]]s, [[board games]], and [[role-playing game]]s, such as ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]'' and ''[[Shadowrun]]'', often feature storylines that are heavily influenced by cyberpunk writing and movies. Beginning in the early 1990s, some trends in [[cyberpunk fashion|fashion]] and music were also labeled as cyberpunk. Cyberpunk is also featured prominently in [[anime]],&lt;ref name=CWCcyber/&gt; ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'' and ''[[Ghost in the Shell (film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' being among the most notable.&lt;ref name=CWCcyber&gt;{{cite book |last=Chaudhuri |first=Shohini |authorlink= |title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=qOXoeyesZOIC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=Akira+Ghost+in+the+Shell+cyberpunk Contemporary World Cinema: Europe, the Middle East, East Asia and South Asia] |publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]] |date=2005 |page=104 |isbn=074861799X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Setting ===
[[Image:Shibuya crossing 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Shibuya, Tokyo]], described as a &quot;futuristic [[Times Square]]&quot; by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/travel/17tokyo.html?pagewanted=print Hidden Tokyo]&lt;/ref&gt; Of Japan's influence on the genre, William Gibson said, &quot;Modern Japan simply was cyberpunk.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cyberpunk1&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/japan_view/scifi.html How did Japan become the favored default setting for so many cyberpunk writers? ]&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberpunk is often set in urbanized, artificial landscapes, and &quot;city lights, receding&quot; was used by Gibson as one of the genre's first [[metaphor]]s for [[cyberspace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Neuromancer | first=William| last=Gibson | month=August | year=1984 | publisher=Ace Books |page =69| isbn=0-441-56956-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Cyberpunk writers tend to use elements from the [[hard-boiled]] [[detective fiction|detective novel]], [[film noir]], and [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] prose to describe the often [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] underground side of an electronic society. The genre's vision of a [[Dystopia|troubled future]] is often called the antithesis of the generally [[utopia]]n visions of the future popular in the 1940s and 1950s. Gibson defined cyberpunk's antipathy towards utopian SF in his 1981 short story &quot;[[The Gernsback Continuum]],&quot; which pokes fun at and, to a certain extent, condemns utopian science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward James (historian) |last2=Mendlesohn |first2=Farah |authorlink2=Farah Mendlesohn |title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=55wUHXiay-gC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=Gernsback+Continuum+utopian The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=2003 |page=221 |isbn=0521016576}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil |authorlink= |title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=bG3H3kxLhU4C&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=Gernsback+Continuum+utopian The Cultures of the New American West] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=2000 |page=159 |isbn=1579582885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seed |first=David |authorlink= |title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=HO_z5WFKwpoC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=Gernsback+Continuum+utopian&amp;lr= A Companion to Science Fiction] |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |date=2005 |page=220 |isbn=1405112182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cyberpunk writing, much of the action takes place [[online]], in [[cyberspace]], blurring the border between actual and [[virtual reality]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://cyberpunk.asia/index.php?lng=us Cyberpunk 2021]&lt;/ref&gt;. A typical [[Trope (literature)|trope]] in such work is a direct [[Brain-computer interface|connection]] between the human brain and computer systems. Cyberpunk depicts the world as a dark, sinister place with [[Computer network|networked]] computers dominating every aspect of life. Giant, [[multinational corporation]]s have for the most part replaced governments as centers of political, economic, and even military power.

=== Protagonists ===
[[Protagonist]]s in cyberpunk writing usually include computer [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]]s, who are often patterned on the idea of the lone hero fighting injustice, such as [[Robin Hood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seal |first=Graham |authorlink= |title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=fiShj7x47k8C&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=cyberpunk+Robin+Hood&amp;lr= The Outlaw Legend: A Cultural Tradition in Britain, America and Australia] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=1996 |page=195 |isbn=0521557402}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the cyberpunk genre's prototype characters is Case, from Gibson's ''[[Neuromancer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Todd W. |authorlink= |title= Literacy Theory in the Age of the Internet |url= http://books.google.com/?id=Pt_CAYf8UgAC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=cyberpunk+case+Neuromancer+prototype |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |date=1998 |page=34 |isbn=0231113315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Case is a &quot;console cowboy,&quot; a brilliant hacker who had betrayed his organized criminal partners. Robbed of his talent through a crippling injury inflicted by the vengeful partners, Case unexpectedly receives a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be healed by expert medical care but only if he participates in another criminal enterprise with a new crew.

Like Case, many cyberpunk protagonists are manipulated, placed in situations where they have little or no choice, and although they might see things through, they do not necessarily come out any further ahead than they previously were. These [[anti-hero]]es—&quot;criminals, outcasts, visionaries, dissenters and misfits&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://18hz.deid.net/cyberpunk.htm FAQ file] (from the ''alt.cyberpunk'' Usenet group)&lt;/ref&gt; call to mind the private eye of [[detective novel]]s. This emphasis on the misfits and the malcontents is the &quot;punk&quot; component of cyberpunk.

=== Society and government ===
Cyberpunk can be intended to disquiet readers and call them to action. It often expresses a sense of rebellion, suggesting that one could describe it as a type of culture revolution in science fiction. In the words of author and critic [[David Brin]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...a closer look [at cyberpunk authors] reveals that they nearly always portray future societies in which governments have become wimpy and pathetic ...Popular science fiction tales by Gibson, Williams, Cadigan and others ''do'' depict [[Orwellian]] accumulations of power in the next century, but nearly always clutched in the secretive hands of a wealthy or corporate [[elite]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brin|Brin, David]] ''The Transparent Society'', Basic Books, 1998 [http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/basic/book_detail.jsp?isbn=0738201448 Book link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cyberpunk stories have also been seen as fictional forecasts of the evolution of the [[Internet]]. The earliest descriptions of a global communications network came long before the [[World Wide Web]] entered popular awareness, though not before traditional science-fiction writers such as [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and some social commentators such as [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] began predicting that such networks would eventually form.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur C. Clarke|Clarke, Arthur C.]] &quot;[[The Last Question]],&quot; ''Science Fiction Quarterly'', 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==
=== Literature ===
{{See also|List of cyberpunk works#Print media}}
The science-fiction editor [[Gardner Dozois]] is generally acknowledged as the person who popularized the use of the term &quot;cyberpunk&quot; as a kind of [[literature]], although Minnesota writer [[Bruce Bethke]] coined the term in 1980 for his short story &quot;Cyberpunk,&quot; which was published in the November 1983 issue of ''[[Amazing Stories|Amazing Science Fiction Stories]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Bethke|Bethke, Bruce]]. &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; ''Amazing Science Fiction Stories'', Vol. 57, No. 4; November 1983 [http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/cpunk.htm Link]&lt;/ref&gt; The term was quickly appropriated as a label to be applied to the works of [[William Gibson]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Pat Cadigan]] and others. Of these, Sterling became the movement's chief ideologue, thanks to his [[fanzine]] ''[[Cheap Truth]].'' John Shirley wrote articles on Sterling and Rucker's significance.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Shirley]]. ''Two Cyberpunks: Sterling and Rucker'' 1999 [http://www.darkecho.com/JohnShirley/jspunks.html Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Gibson]] with his novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984) is likely the most famous writer connected with the term cyberpunk. He emphasized style, a fascination with surfaces, and atmosphere over traditional science-fiction [[trope (literature)|trope]]s. Regarded as ground-breaking and sometimes as &quot;the archetypal cyberpunk work,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Person&quot;/&gt; ''Neuromancer'' was awarded the [[Hugo Award|Hugo]], [[Nebula Award|Nebula]], and [[Philip K. Dick]] Awards. After Gibson's popular debut novel, ''[[Count Zero]]'' (1986) and ''[[Mona Lisa Overdrive]]'' (1988) followed. According to the [[Jargon File]], &quot;Gibson's near-total ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker culture enabled him to speculate about the role of computers and hackers in the future in ways hackers have since found both irritatingly naïve and tremendously stimulating.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/C/cyberpunk.html Jargon File definition]; see also [http://ursine.ca/Cyberpunk &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; at the Jargon Wiki].&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on, cyberpunk was hailed as a radical departure from science-fiction standards and a new manifestation of vitality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brians&quot;&gt;Brians, Paul. “Study Guide for William Gibson: Neuromancer (1984)” Washington State University, [http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/science_fiction/neuromancer.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, however, many critics arose to challenge its status as a revolutionary movement. These critics said that the SF [[New Wave science fiction|New Wave]] of the 1960s was much more innovative as far as narrative techniques and styles were concerned.&lt;ref&gt;James, Edward. ''Science Fiction in the 20th Century'', Oxford University Press, Oxford &amp; New York, 1994. p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, while ''Neuromancer''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s narrator may have had an unusual &quot;voice&quot; for science fiction, much older examples can be found: Gibson's narrative voice, for example, resembles that of an updated [[Raymond Chandler]], as in his novel ''[[The Big Sleep]]'' (1939).&lt;ref name=&quot;Brians&quot;/&gt; Others noted that almost all traits claimed to be uniquely cyberpunk could in fact be found in older writers' works—often citing [[J. G. Ballard]], [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Stanisław Lem]], [[Samuel R. Delany]], and even [[William S. Burroughs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brians&quot;/&gt; For example, Philip K. Dick's works contain recurring themes of social decay, artificial intelligence, paranoia, and blurred lines between objective and subjective realities, and the influential cyberpunk movie ''[[Blade Runner]]'' is based on one of his books. Humans linked to machines are found in Pohl and Kornbluth's ''[[Wolfbane (novel)|Wolfbane]]'' (1959) and [[Roger Zelazny]]'s ''[[Creatures of Light and Darkness]]'' (1968).

In 1994, scholar Brian Stonehill suggested that [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s 1973 novel ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' &quot;not only curses but precurses what we now glibly dub cyberspace.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Stonehill, &quot;[http://www.pynchon.pomona.edu/gr/bsto.html Pynchon's Prophecies of Cyberspace].&quot; Delivered at the first international conference on Pynchon, the [[University of Warwick]], England, November 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important predecessors include [[Alfred Bester (author)|Alfred Bester]]'s two most celebrated novels, ''[[The Demolished Man]]'' and ''[[The Stars My Destination]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Booker |first=M.

Science-fiction writer [[David Brin]] describes cyberpunk as &quot;the finest free promotion campaign ever waged on behalf of science fiction.&quot; It may not have attracted the &quot;real punks,&quot; but it did ensnare many new readers, and it provided the sort of movement that postmodern literary critics found alluring. Cyberpunk made science fiction more attractive to academics, argues Brin; in addition, it made science fiction more profitable to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] and to the visual arts generally. Although the &quot;self-important rhetoric and whines of persecution&quot; on the part of cyberpunk fans were irritating at worst and humorous at best, Brin declares that the &quot;rebels did shake things up. We owe them a debt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brin]], [http://www.davidbrin.com/matrixarticle.html Review of ''The Matrix''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberpunk further inspired many professional writers who were not among the &quot;original&quot; cyberpunks to incorporate cyberpunk ideas into their own works, such as [[George Alec Effinger]]'s ''[[When Gravity Fails]]''. ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, created by Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe, mixes new technology, art, literature, and current topics in order to interest today’s cyberpunk fans, which Paula Yoo claims &quot;proves that hardcore hackers, multimedia junkies, cyberpunks and cellular freaks are poised to take over the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Yoo, Paula. “CYBERPUNK&amp;nbsp;– IN PRINT&amp;nbsp;– HACKER GENERATION GETS PLUGGED INTO NEW MAGAZINE” Seattle Times.

[[Image:Bladerunner tyrellbuilding.jpg|thumb|small|right|A futuristic [[Los Angeles]] in Blade Runner.]]

The film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982), adapted from Philip K. Dick's ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', is set in 2019 in a dystopian future in which manufactured beings called [[replicant]]s are slaves used on space colonies and are legal prey on Earth to various bounty hunters who &quot;retire&quot; (kill) them. Although ''Blade Runner'' was largely unsuccessful in its first theatrical release, it found a viewership in the home video market and became a [[cult film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kerman |first=Judith |authorlink= |title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=HAma4m3w38EC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Blade+Runner+box+office Retrofitting Blade Runner: Issues in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?] |publisher=Popular Press |date=1997 |page=132 |isbn=0879725109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the movie omits the religious and mythical elements of Dick's original novel (e.g. empathy boxes and Wilbur Mercer), it falls more strictly within the cyberpunk genre than the novel does. William Gibson would later reveal that upon first viewing the film, he was surprised at how the look of this film matched his vision when he was working on ''[[Neuromancer]]''. The film's tone has since been the staple of many cyberpunk movies, such as ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999), which uses a wide variety of cyberpunk elements.

The number of films in the genre or at least using a few genre elements has grown steadily since ''Blade Runner''. Several of Philip K. Dick's works have been adapted to the silver screen. The films ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=150 |title=CTheory.net |publisher=CTheory.net |date= |accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[New Rose Hotel (film)|New Rose Hotel]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/newrosehotel.php |title=DVD Verdict Review&amp;nbsp;– New Rose Hotel |publisher=Dvdverdict.com |date=2000-01-10 |accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/film/100199rose-film-review.html |title='New Rose Hotel': Corporate Intrigue, Steamy Seduction |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1999-10-01 |accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; both based upon short stories by William Gibson, flopped commercially and critically.

In addition, &quot;[[tech-noir]]&quot; film as a hybrid genre, means a work of combining [[neo-noir]] and science fiction or cyberpunk. It includes many cyberpunk films such as ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[The Terminator]]'', ''[[12 Monkeys]]'', ''[[The Lawnmower Man (film)|The Lawnmower Man]]'', ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]], and ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]''.

Cyberpunk themes are widely visible in [[anime]] and [[manga]]. In [[Japan]], where [[cosplay]] is popular and not only teenagers display such fashion styles, cyberpunk has been accepted and its influence is widespread. [[William Gibson]]’s ''[[Neuromancer]],'' whose influence dominated the early cyberpunk movement, was also set in [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], one of Japan’s largest industrial areas, although at the time of writing the novel Gibson did not know the location of Chiba and had no idea how perfectly it fit his vision in some ways. The exposure to cyberpunk ideas and fiction in the mid 1980s has allowed it to seep into the Japanese culture. Even though most anime and manga is written in Japan, the cyberpunk anime and manga have a more futuristic and therefore international feel to them so they are widely accepted by all. “The conceptualization involved in cyberpunk is more of forging ahead, looking at the new global culture. It is a culture that does not exist right now, so the Japanese concept of a cyberpunk future, seems just as valid as a Western one, especially as Western cyberpunk often incorporates many Japanese elements.”&lt;ref&gt;Ruh, Brian (2000), &quot;[http://www.animeresearch.com/Articles/LiberatingCels Liberating Cels: Forms of the Female in Japanese Cyberpunk Animation].&quot; AnimeResearch.com December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; William Gibson is now a frequent visitor to Japan, and he came to see that many of his visions of Japan have become a reality:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Modern Japan simply was cyberpunk. The [[Japanese people|Japanese]] themselves knew it and delighted in it. I remember my first glimpse of [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]], when one of the young [[Tokyo]] journalists who had taken me there, his face drenched with the light of a thousand media-suns—all that towering, animated crawl of commercial information—said, &quot;You see? You see? It is ''[[Blade Runner]]'' town.&quot; And it was. It so evidently was.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, William. &quot;The Future Perfect: How Did Japan Become the Favored Default Setting for So Many Cyberpunk Writers?&quot;, ''Time International'', 30 April 2001:48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cyberpunk has influenced many anime and manga including the ground-breaking ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'', ''[[Battle Angel Alita]]'' and ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]''.

=== Games &amp; Online ===
{{See also|List of cyberpunk works#List of computer and video games}}
Several [[role-playing games]] (RPGs) called ''Cyberpunk'' exist: ''Cyberpunk'', ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]'' and ''Cyberpunk v3'', by [[R. Talsorian Games]], and ''[[GURPS Cyberpunk]]'', published by [[Steve Jackson Games]] as a module of the [[GURPS]] family of RPGs. ''Cyberpunk 2020'' was designed with the settings of William Gibson's writings in mind, and to some extent with his approval{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, unlike the approach taken by [[FASA Corporation|FASA]] in producing the transgenre ''[[Shadowrun]]'' game. Both are set in the near future, in a world where [[cyberware|cybernetics]] are prominent. In addition, [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] released an RPG named ''[[Cyberspace (role-playing game)|Cyberspace]]'', which was out of print for several years until recently being re-released in online PDF form.

In 1990, in a convergence of cyberpunk art and reality, the [[United States Secret Service]] raided Steve Jackson Games's headquarters and confiscated all their computers. This was allegedly because the ''GURPS Cyberpunk'' sourcebook could be used to perpetrate computer crime. That was, in fact, not the main reason for the raid, but after the event it was too late to correct the public's impression.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/Roleplayer/Roleplayer19/Raid.html SJ Games Raided]''&amp;nbsp;– [[Steve Jackson (US game designer)|Jackson, Steve]], [[Steve Jackson Games]] website, Friday 19 April 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Jackson Games later won a lawsuit against the Secret Service, aided by the new [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. This event has achieved a sort of notoriety, which has extended to the book itself as well. All published editions of ''GURPS Cyberpunk'' have a tagline on the front cover, which reads &quot;The book that was seized by the U.S. Secret Service!&quot; Inside, the book provides a summary of the raid and its aftermath.

Cyberpunk has also inspired several [[tabletop game|tabletop]], [[miniature wargaming|miniature]] and [[board game]]s. ''[[Netrunner]]'' is a collectible card game introduced in 1996, based on the ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]'' role-playing game.

[[Computer games]] have frequently used cyberpunk as a source of inspiration, such as the ''[[Deus Ex (series)|Deus Ex]]'' series and the ''[[System Shock]]'' series as well as the MMORPG ''[[Neocron]]''. Other games, like ''[[Blade Runner (1997 video game)|Blade Runner]]'' and the ''[[The Matrix (franchise)#Video games|Matrix]]'' games, are based upon genre movies.
[[Electronic Arts]] and [[Tilted Mill]] also published a game called ''[[SimCity Societies]]'' in 2007 which features the ability for a cyberpunk society along with numerous others.

The city of [[Insilico]] in [[Second Life]] is also influenced by the Cyberpunk theme &lt;ref&gt;[http://insilico.gemini-cybernetics.net/ INSILICO]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other cities in Second Life, such as Hangars Liquides, and S.I.C. &lt;ref&gt;[http://secondlife.com/destinations/cyber Second Life Cyber Destinations]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Real life (reality)|real life]] places have been described as cyberpunk, such as [[Japan]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cyberpunk1&quot;/&gt;, the [[Sony Center]] in the [[Potsdamer Platz]] [[public square]] of [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Suzuki |first=David |authorlink=David Suzuki |title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=nbvpz6NaZC8C&amp;pg=PA332&amp;dq=Berlin+Sony+Center+cyberpunk Good News for a Change:How Everyday People Are Helping the Planet] |publisher=Greystone Books |date=2003 |page=332 |isbn=155054926X}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahr Johnny, &quot;Cybercity - Sahr Johnny's Shanghai Dream&quot; ''[[That's Shanghai]]'', October 2005; quoted online by [http://www.xyberia.com/].&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Society and counterculture ===
Several subcultures have been inspired by cyberpunk fiction. These include the [[Cyberdelic]] counter culture of the late 80s and early 90s. Cyberdelic, whose adherents referred to themselves as &quot;cyberpunks,&quot; attempted to blend the [[Psychedelic era|psychedelic art and drug movement]] with the technology of [[cyberculture]]. Early adherents included [[Timothy Leary]], [[Mark Frauenfelder]] and [[R. U. Sirius]]. The movement largely faded following the [[dot-com bubble]] implosion of 2000.

[[Cybergoth]] is a fashion and dance subculture which draws its inspiration from cyberpunk fiction, as well as [[rave]] and [[goth subculture|gothic]] subcultures.

In addition, a distinct [[cyberpunk fashion]] of its own has emerged in recent years which rejects the raver and goth influences of [[cybergoth]].

=== Arts and aesthetics ===
==== Literary subgenres and connected genres ====
As a wider variety of writers began to work with cyberpunk concepts, new sub-genres of science fiction emerged, some which could be considered as playing off the cyberpunk label, others which could be considered as legitimate explorations into newer territory. These focused on technology and its social effects in different ways. One prominent subgenre is &quot;[[steampunk]],&quot; which is set in an [[alternate history]] [[Victorian era]] that combines anachronistic technology with cyberpunk's bleak [[film noir]] world view. The term was originally coined around 1987 as a joke to describe some of the novels of [[Tim Powers]], [[James P. Blaylock]], and [[K.W. Jeter]], but by the time Gibson and Sterling entered the subgenre with their collaborative novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' the term was being used earnestly as well.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Berry, &quot;Wacko Victorian Fantasy Follows 'Cyberpunk' Mold,&quot; ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 25 June 1987; quoted online by [http://www.wordspy.com/words/steampunk.asp Wordspy].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another subgenre is &quot;[[biopunk]]&quot; (cyberpunk themes dominated by [[biotechnology]]) from the early 1990s, a derivative style building on biotechnology rather than informational technology. In these stories, people are changed in some way not by mechanical means, but by [[genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]]. [[Paul Di Filippo]] is seen as the most prominent biopunk writer, including his half-serious [[ribofunk]]. [[Bruce Sterling]]'s [[Shaper/Mechanist]] cycle is also seen as a major influence. In addition, some people consider works such as [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' to be [[postcyberpunk]].

Some musicians and acts have been classified as cyberpunk due to their aesthetic style and musical content. Often dealing with dystopian visions of the future or biomechanical themes, some fit more squarely in the category than others. Bands whose music has been classified as cyberpunk include [[Psydoll]], [[Front Line Assembly]], [[Atari Teenage Riot]] and [[Sigue Sigue Sputnik]]. Some musicians not normally associated with cyberpunk have at times been inspired to create concept albums exploring such themes. [[Nine Inch Nails]]' concept album [[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]] fits into this category. [[Billy Idol]]'s ''[[Cyberpunk (album)|Cyberpunk]]'' drew heavily from cyberpunk literature and the [[cyberdelic]] counter culture in its creation. ''[[1. Outside]]'', a cyberpunk narrative fueled concept album by [[David Bowie]], was warmly met by critics upon its release in 1995. Many musicians have also taken inspiration from specific cyberpunk works or authors, including [[Sonic Youth]], whose albums [[Sister (Sonic Youth album)|Sister]] and [[Daydream Nation]] take influence from the works of Phillip K. Dick and William Gibson respectively. 

[[Industrial music]] can be seen as cyberpunk, as well as various [[electronic body music]] acts.

[[Image:Little Nemo moon.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Winsor McCay]]'s ''[[Little Nemo]]'' (1905), an American [[Sunday strip|Sunday comic strip]] featuring a heightened use of perspective, a sequential narrative in panel tiers and dream-like plots.]]
A '''comic strip''' is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. 

Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these were published in [[newspaper]]s, with horizontal [[daily strip|strips]] printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in [[Sunday comics|special color comics sections]]. There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://specialcollections.lib.msu.edu/html/materials/collections/comicart_coll.jsp Comic Art Collection] at [[Michigan State University Libraries]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Strips are written and drawn by a [[comics artist]] or [[cartoonist]]. As the name implies, comic strips can be humorous (for example, &quot;gag-a-day&quot; strips such as ''[[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]]'', ''[[Bringing Up Father]]'', ''[[Marmaduke]]'' and ''[[Pearls Before Swine (comic strip)|Pearls Before Swine]]''). 

Starting in the early 1930s, comic strips expanded from their mirthful origins to feature adventure stories, as seen in ''[[Popeye]]'', ''[[Captain Easy]]'', ''[[Buck Rogers]]'', ''[[Tarzan]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''. Soap-opera continuity strips such as ''[[Judge Parker]]'' and ''[[Mary Worth]]'' gained popularity in the 1940s. All are called, generically, comic strips, though cartoonist [[Will Eisner]] has suggested that &quot;sequential art&quot; would be a better name for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Eisner | first=Will | authorlink=Will Eisner | title=Comics and Sequential Art | publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] | year=2008 | isbn=978-0393331264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[History of the British comic|UK]] and the rest of [[Europe]], comic strips are also serialized in comic book magazines, with a strip's story sometimes continuing over three pages or more. Comic strips have appeared in American magazines such as ''[[Liberty (1924–1950)|Liberty]]'' and ''[[Boys' Life]]'' and also on the front covers of magazines, such as the ''Flossy Frills'' series on ''[[The American Weekly]]'' [[Sunday magazine|Sunday newspaper supplement]].

==History==
[[Storytelling]] using a sequence of pictures has existed through history. One medieval European example in textile form is the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]. Printed examples emerged in 19th-century Germany and in 18th-century England, where some of the first [[satirical]] or humorous sequential narrative drawings were produced. [[William Hogarth]]'s 18th century English cartoons include both narrative sequences, such as ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', and single panels.

The [[Biblia pauperum]] (&quot;Paupers' Bible&quot;), a tradition of picture [[Bible]]s beginning in the later [[Middle Ages]], sometimes depicted Biblical events with words spoken by the figures in the [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] written on scrolls coming out of their mouths&amp;mdash;which makes them to some extent ancestors of the modern cartoon strips.

The first newspaper comic strips appeared in America in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Robinson | first=Jerry | authorlink=Jerry Robinson | title=The Comics: An Illustrated History of Comic Strip Art | year=1974 | publisher=[[G. P. Putnam's Sons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Yellow Kid]]'' is usually credited as the first. However, the art form combining words and pictures evolved gradually, and there are many examples of proto-comic strips. 

The [[Swiss]] teacher, author and caricature artist [[Rodolphe Toepffer]] (Geneva, 1799–1846) is considered the father of the modern comic strips. His illustrated stories such as ''[[Histoire de M. Vieux Bois]]'' (1827), first published in the USA in 1842 as ''The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck'' or ''Histoire de Monsieur Jabot'' (1831), inspired subsequent generations of German and American comic artists. In 1865, the [[Germany|German]] painter, author and caricaturist [[Wilhelm Busch]] created the strip ''[[Max and Moritz]]'', about two trouble-making boys, which had a direct influence on the American comic strip. ''Max and Moritz'' was a series of severely moralistic tales in the vein of German children's stories such as ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'' (&quot;Shockheaded Peter&quot;); in one, the boys, after perpetrating some mischief, are tossed into a sack of grain, run through a mill and consumed by a flock of geese. ''Max and Moritz'' provided an inspiration for German immigrant [[Rudolph Dirks]], who created the ''[[Katzenjammer Kids]]'' in 1897. Familiar comic-strip iconography such as stars for pain, sawing logs for snoring, speech balloons and thought balloons originated in Dirks' strip.&lt;ref name=toon/&gt;

Hugely popular, ''Katzenjammer Kids'' occasioned one of the first comic-strip copyright ownership suits in the history of the medium. When Dirks left [[William Randolph Hearst]] for the promise of a better salary under [[Joseph Pulitzer]], it was an unusual move, since cartoonists regularly deserted Pulitzer for Hearst. In a highly unusual court decision, Hearst retained the rights to the name &quot;Katzenjammer Kids&quot;, while creator Dirks retained the rights to the characters. Hearst promptly hired [[Harold Knerr]] to draw his own version of the strip. Dirks renamed his version ''Hans and Fritz'' (later, ''The Captain and the Kids''). Thus, two versions distributed by rival syndicates graced the comics pages for decades. Dirks' version, eventually distributed by United Feature Syndicate, ran until 1979.

In America, the great popularity of [[comics]] sprang from the newspaper war (1887 onwards) between Pulitzer and Hearst. ''[[The Little Bears]]'' (1893–96) was the first [[United States|American]] comic with recurring characters, while the first color comic supplement was published by the ''Chicago Inter-Ocean'' sometime in the latter half of 1892. On January 31, 1912, Hearst introduced the nation's first full daily comic page in his ''[[New York Journal American|New York Evening Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Smithsonian collection of newspaper comics|year=1977|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|isbn=0874741726|pages=15|author=Bill Blackbeard|coauthors=Martin T. Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, with its traditions of [[block printing]] and of the incorporation of text with image, experiments with what became ''[[lianhuanhua]]'' date back to 1884.&lt;ref&gt;

==Newspapers==
Newspaper comic strips come in two different types: [[daily strip]]s and [[Sunday strip]]s. Most newspaper comic strips are syndicated; a [[syndicate]] hires people to write and draw a strip and then distributes it to many newspapers for a fee. A few newspaper strips are exclusive to one newspaper. For example, the ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' comic strip by [[Walt Kelly]] originally appeared only in the ''[[PM (newspaper)|New York Star]]'' in 1948 and was not picked up for syndication until the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Complete Pogo, Volume 1 | contribution=Introduction | last=Kelly | first=Walt | authorlink=Walt Kelly | others=R. C. Harvey | page=v | publisher=[[Fantagraphics Books]] | year=1992 | isbn=1560970189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a daily strip appears in newspapers on weekdays, Monday through Saturday, as contrasted with a Sunday strip, which typically only appears on Sundays. Daily strips usually are printed in black and white, and Sunday strips are usually in color. However, a few newspapers have published daily strips in color, and some newspapers have published Sunday strips in black and white. The two conventional formats for newspaper comics are strips and single gag panels. The strips are usually displayed horizontally, wider than they are tall. Single panels are square, circular or taller than they are wide. Strips usually, but not always, are broken up into several smaller panels with continuity from panel to panel. A horizontal strip can also be used for a single panel with a single gag, as seen occasionally in [[Mike Peters (cartoonist)|Mike Peters]]' ''[[Mother Goose and Grimm]]''.

During the 1930s, the original art for a daily strip could be drawn as large as 25&amp;nbsp;inches wide by six inches high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/5761968 Live Auctioneers, ''Etta Kett'', January 2, 1933.]&lt;/ref&gt; As strips have become smaller, the number of panels have been reduced.

The popularity and accessibility of strips meant they were often clipped and saved; authors including [[John Updike]] and [[Ray Bradbury]] have written about their childhood collections of clipped strips. Often posted on [[bulletin board]]s, clipped strips had an ancillary form of distribution when they were faxed, photocopied or mailed. The ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'''s Linda White recalled, &quot;I followed the adventures of ''[[Winnie Winkle]]'', ''[[Moon Mullins]]'' and ''[[Dondi]]'', and waited each fall to see how Lucy would manage to trick Charlie Brown into trying to kick that football. (After I left for college, my father would clip out that strip each year and send it to me just to make sure I didn’t miss it.)&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wbng.org/stories/ruler.html | last=White | first=Linda | title=You can't go home again | work=Telling Our Stories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proof sheets were the means by which syndicates provided newspapers with black-and-white line art for the reproduction of strips (which they arranged to have colored in the case of Sunday strips). [[Michigan State University Libraries#Comic_Art_Collection|Michigan State University Comic Art Collection]] librarian Randy Scott describes these as &quot;large sheets of paper on which newspaper comics have traditionally been distributed to subscribing newspapers. Typically each sheet will have either six daily strips of a given title or one Sunday strip. Thus, a week of ''[[Beetle Bailey]]'' would arrive at the ''[[Lansing State Journal]]'' in two sheets, printed much larger than the final version and ready to be cut apart and fitted into the local comics page.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Randy. &quot;The King Features Proof Sheet Collection&quot;. ''Insight''. Fall 2009. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Comic strip historian [[Allan Holtz]] described how strips were provided as [[Matrix (printing)|mats]] (the plastic or cardboard trays in which molten metal is poured to make plates) or even plates ready to be put directly on the printing press. He also notes that with electronic means of distribution becoming more prevalent printed sheets &quot;are definitely on their way out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2009/12/jim-iveys-sunday-comics_13.html | last=Holtz | first=Allan | authorlink=Allan Holtz | title=Stripper's Guide | date=December 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PdgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA451&amp;dq=newspaper+size+%22comic+strip%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=newspaper%20size%20%22comic%20strip%22&amp;f=false | title=How Cartoons Are Syndicated | journal=[[Popular Mechanics]] | date=March 1926 | volume=45 | issue=3 | page=451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cartoon panels==
{{main|Panel (comics)}}
[[File:Hatlocloistered.jpg|right|thumb|350px|[[Jimmy Hatlo]]'s ''[[They'll Do It Every Time]]'' was often drawn in the two-panel format as seen in this 1943 example.]]
Single panels usually, but not always, are not broken up and lack continuity. The daily ''[[Peanuts]]'' is a strip, and the daily ''[[Dennis the Menace (U.S.)|Dennis the Menace]]'' is a single panel. [[J. R. Williams (cartoonist)|J. R. Williams]]' long-run ''[[Out Our Way]]'' continued as a daily panel even after it expanded into a Sunday strip, ''[[Out Our Way|Out Our Way with the Willets]]''. [[Jimmy Hatlo]]'s ''[[They'll Do It Every Time]]'' was often displayed in a two-panel format with the first panel showing some deceptive, pretentious, unwitting or scheming human behavior and the second panel revealing the truth of the situation.&lt;ref name=toon/&gt;

Early daily strips were large, often running the entire width of the newspaper, and were sometimes three or more inches high.&lt;ref name=archive&gt;[http://www.newspaperarchive.com Newspaper Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, a newspaper page included only a single daily strip, usually either at the top or the bottom of the page. By the 1920s, many newspapers had a comics page on which many strips were collected together. Over decades, the size of daily strips became smaller and smaller, until by the year 2000, four standard daily strips could fit in an area once occupied by a single daily strip.&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;

NEA Syndicate experimented briefly with a two-tier daily strip, ''[[Star Hawks]]'', but after a few years, ''Star Hawks'' dropped down to a single tier.&lt;ref name=toon&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/ Toonopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Flanders]], the two-tier strip is the standard publication style of most daily strips like ''[[Spike and Suzy]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Nero|Nero]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Baudart | first=Sébastien | year=2005 | title=Strips in de Belgische dagbladpers, 1945–1950 | language=Dutch | url=http://www.flwi.ugent.be/btng-rbhc/pdf/BTNG-RBHC,%2035,%202005,%201,%20pp%2053-97.pdf | page=69 | accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appear Monday through Saturday; until 2003 there were no Sunday papers in Flanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Stefaan | last=Michielsen | title=Zondagskrant als antwoord van uitgevers op krimpende markt | url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=dst26092003_084 | publisher=De Standaard | language=Dutch | date=2003-09-26 | accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last decades, they have switched from black and white to color.

==Sunday comics==
{{Main|Sunday comics}}
[[File:Squirrelcage1337.jpg|right|thumb|410px|[[Gene Ahern]]'s ''The Squirrel Cage'' (January 3, 1937), an example of a [[topper (comic strip)|topper]] strip which is better remembered than the strip it accompanied, Ahern's ''[[Room and Board (comic strip)|Room and Board]]''.]]
Sunday newspapers traditionally included a special color section. Early Sunday strips, such as ''[[Thimble Theatre]]'' and ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'', filled an entire newspaper page, a format known to collectors as [[comic strip formats|full page]]. Sunday pages during the 1930s and into the 1940s often carried a secondary strip by the same artist as the main strip. No matter whether it appeared above or below a main strip, the extra strip was known as the [[topper (comic strip)|topper]], such as ''The Squirrel Cage'' which ran along with ''[[Room and Board (comic strip)|Room and Board]]'', both drawn by [[Gene Ahern]].

During the 1930s, the original art for a Sunday strip was usually drawn quite large. For example, in 1930, [[Russ Westover]] drew his ''[[Tillie the Toiler]]'' Sunday page at a size of 17&quot; × 37&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comicstripfan.com/newspaper/t/tilliethetoiler.htm ComicStripFan]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, the cartoonist [[Dudley Fisher]] launched the innovative ''[[Right Around Home]]'', drawn as a huge single panel filling an entire Sunday page.

Full-page strips were eventually replaced by strips half that size. Strips such as ''[[The Phantom]]'' and ''[[Terry and the Pirates]]'' began appearing in a format of two strips to a page in full-size newspapers, such as the ''[[New Orleans Times Picayune]]'', or with one strip on a tabloid page, as in the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]''. When Sunday strips began to appear in more than one format, it became necessary for the cartoonist to allow for rearranged, cropped or dropped panels. During [[World War II]], because of paper shortages, the size of Sunday strips began to shrink. After the war, strips continued to get smaller and smaller because of increased paper and printing costs. The last full-page comic strip was the ''[[Prince Valiant]]'' strip for 11 April 1971.

Comic strips have also been published in Sunday newspaper magazines. [[Russell Patterson]] and Carolyn Wells' ''New Adventures of Flossy Frills'' was a continuing strip series seen on Sunday magazine covers. Beginning January 26, 1941, it ran on the front covers of Hearst's ''[[The American Weekly|American Weekly]]'' newspaper magazine supplement, continuing until March 30 of that year. Between 1939 and 1943, four different stories featuring Flossy appeared on ''American Weekly'' covers.

Sunday comics sections employed offset color printing with multiple print runs imitating a wide range of colors. Printing plates were created with four or more colors&amp;mdash;traditionally, the [[CMYK color model]]: cyan, magenta, yellow and &quot;K&quot; for black. With a screen of tiny dots on each printing plate, the dots allowed an image to be printed in a [[halftone]] that appears to the eye in different gradations. The semi-opaque property of [[ink]] allows halftone dots of different colors to create an optical effect of full-color imagery.&lt;ref name=&quot;campbell&quot;&gt;Campbell, Alastair.

==Underground comic strips==
[[File:Newadvflossy12641.jpg|right|thumb|330px|Russell Patterson and Carolyn Wells' ''New Adventures of Flossy Frills'' (January 26, 1941), an example of Sunday magazine cover comic strips.]]
The decade of the 1960s saw the rise of [[underground newspaper]]s, which often carried comic strips, such as ''[[Fritz the Cat]]'' and ''The [[Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]''. ''[[Zippy the Pinhead]]'' initially appeared in underground publications in the 1970s before being syndicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Estren | first=Mark James | title=A History of Underground Comics | year=1993 | publisher=[[Ronin Publishing]] | isbn=091417164X | page=8 | chapter=Foreword: Onward!}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bloom County]]'' and ''[[Doonesbury]]'' began as strips in college newspapers under different titles, and later moved to national syndication. [[underground comix|Underground comic strips]] covered subjects that are usually taboo in newspaper strips, such as sex and drugs. Many underground artists, notably [[Vaughn Bode]], [[Dan O'Neill]], [[Gilbert Shelton]] and [[Art Spiegelman]] went on to draw comic strips for magazines such as ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' and Pete Millar's ''[[CARtoons Magazine|CARtoons]]''. [[Jay Lynch]] graduated from undergrounds to alternative weekly newspapers to ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' and children's books.

==Webcomic==
{{Main|Webcomic}}
''Webcomics'', also known as ''online comics'' and ''internet comics'', are [[comics]] that are available to read on the [[World Wide Web|Internet]]. Many are exclusively [[publishing|published]] [[online]], while some are published in print but maintain a web [[archive]] for either commercial or artistic reasons. Two of the most popular are ''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]'', focused primarily on video gaming, and ''[[User Friendly]]'', which bases its humor on the Internet and other computer-user issues. The majority of traditional newspaper comic strips have some Internet presence. [[King Features|King Features Syndicate]] and other syndicates often provide archives of recent strips on their websites. Some, such as [[Scott Adams]], creator of ''[[Dilbert]]'', include an email address in each strip.

==Conventions and genres==
Most comic strip characters do not age throughout the strip's life, but in some strips, like [[Lynn Johnston]]'s award-winning ''[[For Better or For Worse]]'', the characters age as the years pass. The first strip to feature aging characters was ''[[Gasoline Alley]]''.

The history of comic strips also includes series that are not humorous, but tell an ongoing [[drama]]tic story. Examples include ''[[The Phantom]]'', ''[[Prince Valiant]]'', ''[[Dick Tracy]]'', ''[[Mary Worth (comic)|Mary Worth]]'', ''[[Modesty Blaise]]'' and ''[[Tarzan]]''. Sometimes these are spin-offs from [[comic book]]s, for example ''[[Superman (comic strip)|Superman]]'', ''[[Batman]]'' and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''.

A number of strips have featured animals ('[[funny animals]]') as main characters. Some are non-verbal (''[[Marmaduke]]'', ''[[The Angriest Dog in the World]]''), some have verbal thoughts but are not understood by humans, (''[[Garfield]]'', [[Snoopy]] in ''[[Peanuts]]''), and some can converse with humans (''[[Bloom County]]'', ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'', ''[[Mutts]]'', ''[[Citizen Dog]]'', ''[[Buckles]]'', ''[[Get Fuzzy]]'', ''[[Pearls Before Swine (comic strip)|Pearls Before Swine]]'' and ''[[Pooch Cafe]]''). Other strips are centered entirely on animals, as in ''Pogo'' and ''[[Donald Duck]]''. [[Gary Larson]]'s ''[[The Far Side]]'' was unusual, as there were no central characters. Instead ''The Far Side'' used a wide variety of characters including humans, monsters, [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], chickens, cows, [[worm]]s, [[amoeba (genus)|amoeba]]s and more. John McPherson's ''[[Close to Home (comic strip)|Close to Home]]'' also uses this theme, though the characters are mostly restricted to humans and real-life situations. [[Wiley Miller]] not only mixes human, animal and fantasy characters, he does several different comic strip continuities under one umbrella title, ''[[Non Sequitur (comic strip)|Non Sequitur]]''. [[Bob Thaves]]'s ''[[Frank &amp; Ernest]]'' began in 1972 and paved the way for some of these strips as its human characters were manifest in diverse forms — as animals, vegetables, and minerals.&lt;ref name=toon/&gt;

==Social and political influence==

The comics have long held a distorted mirror to contemporary society, and almost from the beginning have been used for political or social commentary. This ranged from the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] views of ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'' to the unabashed [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] of ''[[Doonesbury]]''. ''Pogo'' used animals to particularly devastating effect, caricaturing many prominent politicians of the day as animal denizens of Pogo's Okeefenokee Swamp. In a fearless move, Pogo's creator Walt Kelly took on [[Joseph McCarthy]] in the 1950s, caricaturing him as a bobcat named Simple J. Malarkey, a megalomaniac who was bent on taking over the characters' birdwatching club and rooting out all undesirables. Kelly also defended the medium against possible government regulation in the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]]. At a time when comic books were coming under fire for supposed sexual, violent and subversive content, Kelly feared the same would happen to comic strips. Going before the Congressional subcommittee, he proceeded to charm the members with his drawings and the force of his personality. The comic strip was safe for satire.

During the early 20th century, comic strips were widely associated with publisher [[William Randolph Hearst]], whose papers had the largest circulation of strips in the United States. Hearst was notorious for his practice of [[yellow journalism]], and he was frowned on by readers of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other newspapers which featured few or no comic strips. Hearst's critics often assumed that all the strips in his papers were fronts for his own political and social views. Hearst did occasionally work with or pitch ideas to cartoonists, most notably his continued support of [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]''. An inspiration for [[Bill Watterson]] and other cartoonists, ''Krazy Kat'' gained a considerable following among intellectuals during the 1920s and 1930s.

Some comic strips, such as ''Doonesbury'' and ''[[The Boondocks (comic strip)|The Boondocks]]'', may be printed on the [[editorial page|editorial]] or [[op-ed page]] rather than the comics page because of their regular political commentary. For example, the August 12, 1974 ''[[Doonesbury]]'' strip awarded a [[1975 Pulitzer Prize]] for its depiction of the [[Watergate scandal]]. ''[[Dilbert]]'' is sometimes found in the business section of a newspaper instead of the comics page because of the strip's commentary about [[office politics]], and [[Tank McNamara]] often appears on the sports page because of its subject matter.

==Publicity and recognition==
The world's longest comic strip is {{convert|88.9|m|ft|adj=on}} long and on display at [[Trafalgar Square]] as part of the London Comedy Festival.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The London Cartoon Strip was created by 15 of [[United Kingdom|Britain's]] best known cartoonists and depicts the history of London.

The [[Reuben Award|Reuben]], named for cartoonist [[Rube Goldberg]], is the most prestigious award for U.S. comic strip artists. Reuben awards are presented annually by the [[National Cartoonists Society]] (NCS).

Today's strip artists, with the help of the NCS, enthusiastically promote the medium, which is considered to be in decline due to fewer markets and ever-shrinking newspaper space. One particularly humorous example of such promotional efforts is the [[Comic strip switcheroo|Great Comic Strip Switcheroonie]], held in 1997 on April Fool's Day, an event in which dozens of prominent artists took over each other's strips. ''Garfield''’s Jim Davis, for example, switched with ''[[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]]''’s Stan Drake, while Scott Adams (''Dilbert'') traded strips with Bil Keane (''[[The Family Circus]]''). Even the United States Postal Service got into the act, issuing a series of commemorative stamps marking the comic-strip centennial in 1996.

While the Switcheroonie was a one-time publicity stunt, for one artist to take over a feature from its originator is an old tradition in newspaper cartooning (as it is in the comic book industry). In fact, the practice has made possible the longevity of the genre's more popular strips. Examples include ''Little Orphan Annie'' (drawn and plotted by Harold Gray from 1924 to 1944 and thereafter by a succession of artists including [[Leonard Starr]] and [[Andrew Pepoy]]), and ''Terry and The Pirates'', started by Milton Caniff in 1934 and picked up by [[George Wunder]].

A business-driven variation has sometimes led to the same feature continuing under a different name. In one case, in the early 1940s, [[Don Flowers]]' ''Modest Maidens'' was so admired by William Randolph Hearst that he lured Flowers away from the Associated Press and to King Features Syndicate by doubling the cartoonist's salary, and renamed the feature ''Glamor Girls'' to avoid legal action by the AP. The latter continued to publish ''Modest Maidens'', drawn by Jay Allen in Flowers' style.&lt;ref name=toon/&gt;

==Issues in U.S. newspaper comic strips==
{{rquote|right|Comics are sort of the '[[Third rail (metaphor)|third rail]]' of the newspaper.|Jeff Reece, lifestyle editor of ''[[The Florida Times-Union]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;eandp&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003973207 | title=Comics-Page Changes Can Come at a Price | publisher=[[Editor &amp; Publisher]] | date=May 14, 2009 | first=Shawn | last=Moynihan | accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Future of newspapers|As newspapers change]], the changes have affected comic strips.

===Size===
In the early decades of the 20th century, all Sunday comics received a full page, and daily strips were generally the width of the page. ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'' creator [[Bill Watterson]] has written extensively on the issue, arguing that size reduction and dropped panels reduce both the potential and freedom of a cartoonist. After a lengthy battle with his syndicator, Watterson won the privilege of making half page-sized Sunday strips where he could arrange the panels any way he liked. Many newspaper publishers and a few cartoonists objected to this, and some papers continued to print ''Calvin and Hobbes'' at small sizes. One newspaper, the ''[[Reading Eagle]]'', still displays many strips in the largest available size.

===Format===
[[File:Stripslatimes42259.jpg|right|thumb||300px|A typical 1950s layout of [[daily strip|daily newspaper comic strips]] is seen in this page from the ''Los Angeles Times'' (April 22, 1959). To see such full size, go to [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2009/04/matt-weinstock-april-22-1959.html The Daily Mirror].]]
In an issue related to size limitations, Sunday comics are often bound to rigid [[Comic strip formats|formats]] that allow their panels to be rearranged in several different ways while remaining readable. Such formats usually include throwaway panels at the beginning, which some newspapers will omit for space. As a result, cartoonists have less incentive to put great efforts into these panels.

In the early 20th century, it was commonplace for strips to have lengthy adventure stories spanning weeks or months. The &quot;Monarch of Medioka&quot; story in [[Floyd Gottfredson]]'s ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' comic strip ran from September 8, 1937 to May 2, 1938. By the 1950s, syndicators were abandoning adventure stories and urging cartoonists to switch to simple daily gags.

The writing style of comic strips changed as well after the war. With an increase in the number of college-educated readers, there was a shift away from slapstick comedy and towards more cerebral humor. Slapstick and visual gags became more confined to Sunday strips, because as ''[[Garfield]]'' creator [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]] put it, &quot;Children are more likely to read Sunday strips than dailies.&quot;

===Second author===
Many older strips are no longer drawn by the original cartoonist, who has either died or retired. A cartoonist, paid by the syndicate, or sometimes a relative of the original cartoonist continues writing the strip, a tradition that became commonplace in the early half of the 20th century. ''[[Hägar the Horrible]]'' and ''[[Frank and Ernest (comic strip)|Frank and Ernest]]'' are both drawn by the sons of the creators. Some strips which are still in affiliation with the original creator are produced by small teams or entire companies, such as Jim Davis' ''Garfield'' and [[Lynn Johnston]]'s ''[[For Better or for Worse]]''.

This act is commonly criticized by, primarily modern, cartoonists including Watterson and ''Pearls Before Swine'''s [[Stephan Pastis]]. The issue was in fact addressed in six consecutive ''Pearls'' strips in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.com/pearls_before_swine/?DateAfter=2005-09-19&amp;DateBefore=2009-12-18&amp;Order=d.DateStrip+ASC&amp;PerPage=10&amp;x=36&amp;y=15&amp;Search=blondie ''Pearls Before Swine''] at Comics.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Schulz]], of ''[[Peanuts]]'' fame, requested that his strip not be continued by another cartoonist after his death. He also rejected the idea of hiring an inker or letterer, comparing it to a golfer hiring a man to make his putts. Schulz's family has honored his wishes and refused numerous proposals by syndicators to continue Peanuts with a new author.

The problems cited with attaining a second cartoonist state that the second cartoonist is generally less funny or compelling than the creator, and that the new cartoonist does not have the same style of writing or understand the characters as well. Also, some claim that continuing such strips stops newer cartoonists from breaking through.

===Censorship===
Starting in the late 1940s, the national syndicates which distributed newspaper comic strips subjected them to very strict censorship. ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' was censored in September 1947 and was pulled from papers by [[E.W. Scripps Company|Scripps-Howard.]] The controversy, as reported in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', centered on Capp's portrayal of the [[U.S. Senate]]. Said Edward Leech of Scripps, &quot;We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html | title=Tain't Funny | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=September 29, 1947 | accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because historically comics have been considered mostly for children, they have a significantly more rigid censorship code than other media. Stephan Pastis has lamented that the &quot;unwritten&quot; censorship code is still &quot;stuck somewhere in the 1950s.&quot; Generally, comics are not allowed to include such words as &quot;damn&quot;, &quot;sucks&quot;, &quot;screwed&quot; and &quot;hell&quot;, although there have been exceptions such as the September 22, 2010 [[Mother Goose and Grimm]] in which an elderly man says, &quot;This nursing home food sucks,&quot; and a pair of ''Pearls Before Swine'' comics from January, 2011 with a character named Ned using the word &quot;crappy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grimmy.com/comics.php]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.com/pearls_before_swine/2011-01-10/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.com/pearls_before_swine/2011-01-11/]&lt;/ref&gt; Naked backsides and shooting guns cannot be shown, according to ''[[Dilbert]]'' cartoonist [[Scott Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Scott Adams | last=Adams | first=Scott | title=Stick to Drawing Comics, Monkey Brain!: Cartoonist Ignores Helpful Advice | year=2007 | isbn=9781591841852}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such comic strip taboos were detailed in [[Dave Breger]]'s book ''But That's Unprintable'' (Bantam, 1955). 

Many issues such as [[sex]], [[narcotics]] and [[terrorism]] cannot or can very rarely be openly discussed in strips, although there are exceptions, usually for [[satire]], as in ''Bloom County''. This led some cartoonists to resort to [[double entendre]] or dialogue children do not understand, as in [[Greg Evans]]' ''[[Luann (comic strip)|Luann]]''. Young cartoonists have claimed commonplace words, images and issues should be allowed in the comics. Some of the taboo words and topics are mentioned daily on television and other forms of visual media. Web comics and comics distributed primarily to college newspapers are much freer in this respect.

{{About|the hypothesis in set theory|the assumption in fluid mechanics|Fluid mechanics}}
In [[mathematics]], the '''continuum hypothesis''' (abbreviated '''CH''') is a [[hypothesis]], advanced by [[Georg Cantor]] in 1877, about the possible sizes of [[infinite]] [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. It states:
:''There is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and that of the real numbers.''
Establishing the truth or falsehood of the continuum hypothesis is the first of [[Hilbert's problems|Hilbert's twenty-three problems]] presented in the year 1900. The contributions of [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1940 and [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] in 1963 showed that the hypothesis can neither be disproved nor be [[Mathematical proof|proved]] using the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], the standard foundation of modern mathematics, provided ZF set theory is [[consistency|consistent]].

The name of the hypothesis comes from the term [[continuum (set theory)|''the continuum'']] for the real numbers.

==Cardinality of infinite sets==
{{Main|Cardinal number}}

Two sets are said to have the same ''[[cardinality]]'' or ''[[cardinal number]]'' if there exists a [[bijection]] (a one-to-one correspondence) between them. Intuitively, for two sets ''S'' and ''T'' to have the same cardinality means that it is possible to &quot;pair off&quot; elements of ''S'' with elements of ''T'' in such a fashion that every element of ''S'' is paired off with exactly one element of ''T'' and vice versa. Hence, the set {banana, apple, pear} has the same cardinality as {yellow, red, green}.

With infinite sets such as the set of [[integer]]s or [[rational number]]s, this becomes more complicated to demonstrate. The rational numbers seemingly form a counterexample to the continuum hypothesis: the rationals form a proper superset of the integers, and a proper subset of the reals, so intuitively, there are more rational numbers than integers, and fewer rational numbers than real numbers.  However, this intuitive analysis does not take account of the fact that all three sets are [[infinite set|infinite]].  It turns out the rational numbers can actually be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the integers, and therefore the set of rational numbers is the same size (''cardinality'') as the set of integers: they are both [[countable set]]s.

Cantor gave two proofs that the cardinality of the set of [[integer]]s is strictly smaller than that of the set of [[real number]]s (see [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]] and [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]). His proofs, however, give no indication of the extent to which the cardinality of the integers is less than that of the real numbers. Cantor proposed the continuum hypothesis as a possible solution to this question.

The hypothesis states that the set of real numbers has minimal possible cardinality which is greater than the cardinality of the set of integers. Equivalently, as the [[Cardinal number|cardinality]] of the integers is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; (&quot;[[aleph number#Aleph-naught|aleph-naught]]&quot;) and the [[cardinality of the real numbers]] is &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;, the continuum hypothesis says that there is no set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; for which
:&lt;math&gt; \aleph_0 &lt; |S| &lt; 2^{\aleph_0}.&lt;/math&gt;
Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], there is a smallest cardinal number &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; greater than &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;, and the continuum hypothesis is in turn equivalent to the equality
:&lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_1.&lt;/math&gt;
There is also a generalization of the continuum hypothesis called the '''generalized continuum hypothesis''' ('''GCH''') which says that for all [[Ordinal number|ordinals]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_\alpha} = \aleph_{\alpha+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

A consequence of the hypothesis is that every infinite [[subset]] of the real numbers either has the same cardinality as the integers or the same cardinality as the entire set of the reals.

==Impossibility of proof and disproof in ZFC==
Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to [[mathematical proof|prove]] it, in vain. It became the first on David Hilbert's [[Hilbert's problems|list of important open questions]] that was presented at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in the year 1900 in Paris. [[Axiomatic set theory]] was at that point not yet formulated.

[[Kurt Gödel]] showed in 1940&lt;!-- earlier, deleted paragraph said 1939; which is right? --&gt; that the continuum hypothesis (CH for short) cannot be disproved from the standard [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF), even if the [[axiom of choice]] is adopted (ZFC).  [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] showed in 1963 that CH cannot be proven from those same axioms either. Hence, CH is ''[[independence (mathematical logic)|independent]]'' of [[ZFC]]. Both of these results assume that the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms themselves do not contain a contradiction; this assumption is widely believed to be true.

The continuum hypothesis was not the first statement shown to be independent of ZFC. An immediate consequence of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]], which was published in 1931, is that there is a formal statement expressing the consistency of ZFC that is independent of ZFC. This consistency statement is of a metamathematical, rather than purely mathematical, character. The continuum hypothesis and the [[axiom of choice]] were among the first mathematical statements shown to be independent of ZF set theory. These independence proofs were not completed until Paul Cohen developed [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] in the 1960s.

The continuum hypothesis is closely related to many statements in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], point set [[topology]] and [[measure theory]]. As a result of its independence, many substantial [[conjecture]]s in those fields have subsequently been shown to be independent as well.

So far, CH appears to be independent of all known ''[[large cardinal axiom]]s'' in the context of ZFC.

Gödel and Cohen's negative results are not universally accepted as disposing of the hypothesis, and Hilbert's problem remains an active topic of contemporary research (see Woodin 2001a).

==Arguments for and against CH==
Gödel believed that CH is false and that his proof that CH is [[consistent]] only shows that the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms do not adequately describe the universe of sets.  Gödel was a [[Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism|platonist]] and therefore had no problems with asserting the truth and falsehood of statements independent of their provability. Cohen, though a [[Philosophy of mathematics#Formalism|formalist]], also tended towards rejecting CH.

Historically, mathematicians who favored a &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;large&quot; [[universe (mathematics)|universe]] of sets were against CH, while those favoring a &quot;neat&quot; and &quot;controllable&quot; universe favored CH. Parallel arguments were made for and against the [[axiom of constructibility]], which implies CH. More recently, [[Matthew Foreman]] has pointed out that [[ontological maximalism]] can actually be used to argue in favor of CH, because among models that have the same reals, models with &quot;more&quot; sets of reals have a better chance of satisfying CH (Maddy 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;500).

Another viewpoint is that the conception of set is not specific enough to determine whether CH is true or false. This viewpoint was advanced as early as 1923 by [[Skolem]], even before Gödel's first incompleteness theorem. Skolem argued on the basis of what is now known as [[Skolem's paradox]], and it was later supported by the independence of CH from the axioms of ZFC, since these axioms are enough to establish the elementary properties of sets and cardinalities. In order to argue against this viewpoint, it would be sufficient to demonstrate new axioms that are supported by intuition and resolve CH in one direction or another. Although the [[axiom of constructibility]] does resolve CH, it is not generally considered to be intuitively true any more than CH is generally considered to be false (Kunen 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;171).

At least two other axioms have been proposed that have implications for the continuum hypothesis, although these axioms have not currently found wide acceptance in the mathematical community. In 1986, Chris Freiling presented an argument against CH by showing that the negation of CH is equivalent to [[Freiling's axiom of symmetry]], a statement about [[probability|probabilities]]. Freiling believes this axiom is &quot;intuitively true&quot; but others have disagreed. A difficult argument against CH developed by [[W. Hugh Woodin]] has attracted considerable attention since the year 2000 (Woodin 2001a, 2001b). Foreman (2003) does not reject Woodin's argument outright but urges caution.

==The generalized continuum hypothesis ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Forcing (mathematics)]] --&gt;
The ''generalized continuum hypothesis'' (GCH) states that if an infinite set's cardinality lies between that of an infinite set ''S'' and that of the [[power set]] of ''S'', then it either has the same cardinality as the set ''S'' or the same cardinality as the power set of ''S''. That is, for any [[infinite]] [[cardinal number|cardinal]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt; there is no cardinal &lt;math&gt;\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;\kappa &lt;2^{\lambda}.\,&lt;/math&gt; An equivalent condition is that  &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha+1}=2^{\aleph_\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; for every [[ordinal number|ordinal]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha.\,&lt;/math&gt; The [[beth number]]s provide an alternate notation for this condition: &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha=\beth_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for every ordinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is a generalization of the continuum hypothesis since the continuum has the same cardinality as the [[power set]] of the integers. Like CH, GCH is also independent of ZFC, but [[Wacław Sierpiński|Sierpiński]] proved that ZF + GCH implies the [[axiom of choice]] (AC), so choice and GCH are not independent in ZF; there are no models of ZF in which GCH holds and AC fails.

[[Kurt Gödel]] showed that GCH is a consequence of ZF + [[Axiom of constructibility|V=L]] (the axiom that every set is constructible relative to the ordinals), and is consistent with ZFC. As GCH implies CH, Cohen's model in which CH fails is a model in which GCH fails, and thus GCH is not provable from ZFC. W.&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;Easton used the method of forcing developed by Cohen to prove [[Easton's theorem]], which shows it is consistent with ZFC for arbitrarily large cardinals &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to fail to satisfy &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_\alpha} = \aleph_{\alpha + 1}.&lt;/math&gt; Much later, [[Matthew Foreman|Foreman]] and [[W. Hugh Woodin|Woodin]] proved that (assuming the consistency of very large cardinals) it is consistent that &lt;math&gt;2^\kappa&gt;\kappa^+\,&lt;/math&gt; holds for every infinite cardinal &lt;math&gt;\kappa.\,&lt;/math&gt; Later Woodin extended this by showing the consistency of &lt;math&gt;2^\kappa=\kappa^{++}\,&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt;. A recent result of Carmi Merimovich shows that, for each ''n''≥1, it is consistent with ZFC that for each κ, 2&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt; is the ''n''th successor of κ. On the other hand, Laszlo Patai proved, that if γ is an ordinal and for each infinite cardinal κ, 2&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt; is the γth successor of κ, then γ is finite. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

For any infinite sets A and B, if there is an injection from A to B then there is an injection from subsets of A to subsets of B. Thus for any infinite cardinals A and B,
:&lt;math&gt;A &lt; B \to 2^A \le 2^B&lt;/math&gt;.
If A and B are finite, the stronger inequality
:&lt;math&gt;A &lt; B \to 2^A &lt; 2^B \!&lt;/math&gt;
holds. GCH implies that this strict, stronger inequality holds for infinite cardinals as well as finite cardinals.

===Implications of GCH for cardinal exponentiation===
Although the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis refers directly only to cardinal exponentiation with 2 as the base, one can deduce from it the values of cardinal exponentiation in all cases. It implies that &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha}^{\aleph_{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\beta+1}&lt;/math&gt; when α ≤ β+1;
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; when β+1 &lt; α and &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\beta} &lt; \operatorname{cf} (\aleph_{\alpha})&lt;/math&gt; where '''cf''' is the [[cofinality]] operation; and
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha+1}&lt;/math&gt; when β+1 &lt; α and &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\beta} \ge \operatorname{cf} (\aleph_{\alpha})&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Çevik Bir''' was a member of the [[Turkish General Staff]] in the 1990s. He took a major part in several important international missions in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. He was born in [[Buca]], [[İzmir]], in 1939 and is married with one child.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.kalder.org/genel/download/12%20Ulusal%20Kalite%20Kongresi/cevik%20-%20bir%20cv-turkce.pdf Biography], KalDer {{en}} {{tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from the [[Turkish Military Academy]] as an engineer officer in 1958, from the Army Staff College in 1970 and from the Armed Forces College in 1971. He graduated from [[NATO Defense College]], [[Rome, Italy]] in 1973.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

From 1973 to 1985, he served at [[SHAPE]]; NATO's headquarters in Belgium. He was promoted to [[brigadier general]] and commanded an armed brigade and division in Turkey. From 1987 to 1991, he served as [[major general]], and then was promoted to [[lieutenant general]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

After the dictator [[Siad Barre]]’s ousting, conflicts between the General [[Mohammed Farah Aidid|Farah Aidid's]] party and other clans in [[Somalia]] had led to famine and lawlessness throughout the country. An estimated 300,000 people had died from starvation. A combined military force of [[United States]] and [[United Nations]] (under the name &quot;UNISOM&quot;) were deployed to [[Mogadishu]], to monitor the ceasefire and deliver food and supplies to the starving people of Somali. Çevik Bir, who was then a lieutenant-general of [[Turkey]], became the force commander of UNISOM in 1993.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Despite the retreat of US and UN forces after several deaths due to local hostilities mainly led by Aidid, the introduction of a powerful military force opened the transportation routes, enabling the provision of supplies and ended the famine quickly.

He became a four-star general and served three years as vice chairman of the [[Turkish Armed Forces]], then appointed commander of the [[Turkish First Army]], in Istanbul. While he was vice chairman of the TAF, he signed the Turkish-Israeli Military Coordination agreement in 1996.

Çevik Bir became the Turkish army's deputy chief of general staff shortly after the Somali operation and played a vital role in establishing a Turkish-[[Israel]]i entente against the emerging fundamentalism in the Middle East. For being a staunch defender of [[secularism]] in the region, he was awarded the Secularism and Democracy Award of 1997 in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Collectivism''' is any philosophic, political, economic or social outlook that emphasizes the [[interdependence]] of every human in some [[collective]] group and the priority of group goals over individual goals. Collectivists usually focus on [[community]], [[society]] or [[nation]]. Collectivism has been widely used to refer to a number of different political, economic and educational philosophies, ranging from [[communalism]] and [[democracy]] to [[totalitarian]] [[nationalism]].

[[Corporatism]] refers to a form of collectivism that views the whole as being greater than the sum of its individual parts, and gives priority to group rights over individual rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;JIM1&quot;&gt;Chakrabarty, S (2009) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1151025 The Influence of National Culture and Institutional Voids on Family Ownership of Large Firms: A Country Level Empirical Study] Journal of International Management, 15(1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ratner, Carl|coauthors=Lumei Hui|title=Theoretical and Methodological Problems in Cross–Cultural Psychology|journal=Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour|volume=33|issue=1|year=2003|pages=72|url=http://www.humboldt1.com/~cr2/crosscult.htm|doi=10.1111/1468-5914.00206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The philosophic underpinnings of this type of collectivism is related to [[holism]] and [[organicism]].{{Dubious|date=May 2009}} Specifically, a [[society]] as a whole can be seen as having more meaning or value than the separate individuals that make up that society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agassi, Joseph|title=Methodological Individualism |journal=British Journal of Sociology|volume=11|issue=3|year=1960|pages=244–270|doi=10.2307/586749|url=http://jstor.org/stable/586749|publisher=Blackwell Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivism is widely seen as being opposed to [[individualism]]; however most philosophies, political and economic systems have a degree of both collectivist and individualist aspects.

==Politics==
According to [[Moyra Grant]], in political philosophy &quot;collectivism&quot; refers to any philosophy or system that puts any kind of group (such as a class, nation, race, society, state, etc.) before the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Moyra. Key Ideas in Politics. Nelson Thomas 2003. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], &quot;collectivism has found varying degrees of expression in the 20th century in such movements as [[socialism]], [[communism]], and [[fascism]]. The least collectivist of these is [[social democracy]], which seeks to reduce the perceived injustices of unrestrained [[capitalism]] by government regulation, redistribution of income, and varying degrees of planning and public ownership. In communist systems collectivist economics are carried to their furthest extreme, with a minimum of private ownership and a maximum of [[planned economy]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 12 Jan. 2007  &lt;http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9024764&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, political collectivism is not necessarily associated with support for states, governments, or other hierarchical institutions. There are variants of [[anarchism]], such as [[collectivist anarchism]] and [[anarchist communism]], which are collectivist. Collectivist anarchists, particularly [[Mikhail Bakunin]], were among the earliest critics of [[Leninism|authoritarian communism]]. They agree with communists that the means of production should be expropriated from private owners and converted to [[Common ownership|common property]],&lt;ref&gt;Anarchism. Bottomore, T. B. The Dictionary of Marxist Thought. Blackwell Publishing, 1992. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; but they advocate the ownership of this property to be vested by a loose group of decentralized communes rather than to be held in common by all of society. Nevertheless, unlike [[anarchist communist|anarcho-communists]], collectivist anarchists supported a wage system and markets in non-capital goods.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Thus, Bakunin's &quot;Collectivist Anarchism,&quot; notwithstanding the title, is seen as a blend of individualism and collectivism.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Brian. ''Bakukunin: The Philosophy of Freedom''. Black Rose Books Ltd., 1993. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarcho-communism]] is a more comprehensive form of collectivism which advocates not only the collectivization of the [[means of production]] but of the products of labor as well.&lt;ref&gt;At the Florence Conference of the [[Italian Federation]] of the [[First International|International]] in 1876, held in a forest outside Florence due to police activity, they declared the principles of anarcho-communism, beginning with: &quot;The Italian Federation considers the collective property of the products of labour as the necessary complement to the collectivist programme, the aid of all for the satisfaction of the needs of each being the only rule of production and consumption which corresponds to the principle of solidarity.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to anarcho-communist [[Peter Kropotkin]], &quot;And as long as dwelling-houses, fields, and factories belong to isolated owners, men will have to pay them, in one way or another, for being allowed to work in the fields or factories, or for living in the houses. The owners will accept to be paid by the workers in gold, in paper-money, or in cheques exchangeable for all sorts of commodities. But how can we defend labour-notes, this new form of wagedom, when we admit that houses, fields, and factories will no longer be private property, and that they will belong to the commune or the nation?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, Peter. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/conquest/ch13.html Chapter 13 The Collectivist Wages System from ''The Conquest of Bread''], G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York and London, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Laissez-faire]] --&gt;

Generally speaking, economic collectivism can refer to two distinct concepts: that property (usually in reference to [[Means of production|productive property]]) be [[Common ownership|owned by all of society in common]], or that possessions be owned by [[Worker cooperative|collective groups that use the property]]. The first concept is related to [[Communism]], communalism and some forms of socialism, while the latter concept is related to forms of socialism based on independent cooperative organizations such as [[Syndicalism]], [[Guild socialism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|libertarian socialism]] and [[market socialism]]. Additionally, [[capitalist]] systems that largely consist of either cooperative or [[Joint-stock|corporate ownership]] structures, with ownership being vested in collective entities of legal owners rather than the producers/users of the property, can be characterized as being collectivist to some degree.

Collectivism in the field of economics holds that some things should be owned by all of society and used for the benefit of all rather than being owned by just individuals or private parties. Central to this view is the concept of the [[commons]], as opposed to private [[property]]. Early economic systems such as [[communalism]] and tribal societies practiced this form of collectivism. Collectivism can also apply to public ownership over the [[means of production]], while others argue{{Who|date=April 2010}} that all valued commodities, like environmental or consumer goods, should be regarded as [[public goods]] and placed under [[public ownership]]. In health care, collective action by trade unions and other professional bodies throughout Europe in the early twentieth century established mutual sickness funds and contracts with doctors and hospitals enabling workers to be assured of access to health care and sometimes sick pay collectively funded by all the members of the trade union or profession.

Collectivism in economics may or may not involve a [[state (polity)|state]] as a manager and steward of collective property. For instance, company property in corporations is usually managed by specialized managers, despite being owned in some cases by hundreds of shareholders. [[Anarcho-communists]], who argue for the immediate abolition of the state, wish to place all goods under communal access without a state or manager. They argue that since the value of labor cannot truly be measured, individuals should be free to produce and consume to their own self-determined needs. In 1876, at the [[Florence Conference]] of the Italian Federation of the International, where the principles of anarcho-communism were first laid out, it was stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Italian Federation considers the collective property of the products of labour as the necessary complement to the collectivist programme, the aid of all for the satisfaction of the needs of each being the only rule of production and consumption which corresponds to the principle of solidarity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin believed that a lack of collectivization of goods would be a dis-service to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Shatz, Marshall. Introduction to Kropotkin: The Conquest of Bread and Other Writings, Cambridge University Press 1995, p. xvi &quot;Anarchist communism called for the socialization not only of production but of the distribution of goods: the community would supply the subsistence requirements of each individual member free of charge, and the criterion, 'to each according to his labor' would be superseded by the criterion 'to each according to his needs.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology==

Collectivism can be typified as &quot;horizontal collectivism&quot;, wherein equality is emphasized and people engage in sharing and cooperation, or &quot;vertical collectivism&quot;, wherein hierarchy is emphasized and people submit to authorities to the point of self-sacrifice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Triandis1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Triandis, Harry C.|title=Individualism-Collectivism and Personality|journal=Journal of Personality|volume=69|issue=6|year=2001|pages=909|doi=10.1111/1467-6494.696169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horizontal collectivism is based on the assumption that each individual is more or less equal, while vertical collectivism assumes that individuals are fundamentally different from each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Triandis2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Triandis, Harry C.|coauthors=Gelfand, Michele J.|title=Converging Measurement of Horizontal and Vertical Individualism and Collectivism|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=74|issue=1|year=1998|pages=119|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.1.118}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social anarchism|Social anarchist]] Alexander Berkman, who was a horizontal collectivist, argued that equality does not imply a lack of unique individuality, but an equal amount of freedom and equal opportunity to develop one's own skills and talents,

{{quote|equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity. . . Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality of the convict camp. True anarchist equality implies freedom, not quantity. It does not mean that every one must eat, drink, or wear the same things, do the same work, or live in the same manner. Far from it: the very reverse, in fact. Individual needs and tastes differ, as appetites differ. It is equal opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality. Far from levelling, such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of activity and development. For human character is diverse, and only the repression of this free diversity results in levelling, in uniformity and sameness. Free opportunity and acting out your individuality means development of natural dissimilarities and variations. . . . Life in freedom, in anarchy will do more than liberate man merely from his present political and economic bondage. That will be only the first step, the preliminary to a truly human existence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Berkman|Berkman, Alexander]]. ''[[Now and After|The ABC of Anarchism]]'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Indeed, horizontal collectivists argue that the idea of individuals sacrificing themselves for the &quot;group&quot; or &quot;greater good&quot; is nonsensical, arguing that groups are made up of individuals (including oneself) and are not a cohesive, monolithic entity separate from the self. But most social anarchists do not see themselves as collectivists or individualists, viewing both as illusory ideologies based on fiction .&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20091027135445/http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secA2.html  A.2 What does anarchism stand for?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Horizontal collectivists tend to favour democratic decision-making, while vertical collectivists believe in a strict chain of command. Horizontal collectivism stresses common goals, interdependence and sociability. Vertical collectivism stresses the integrity of the [[ingroup|in-group]] (e.g. the family or the nation), expects individuals to sacrifice themselves for the in-group if necessary, and promotes competition between different in-groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Triandis2&quot;/&gt;

== Collectivist societies ==

There are few examples of societies around the world which have characterized themselves or have been characterized by outsiders as &quot;collectivist&quot;.

On the one hand, at the country scale, there are the [[Communist states]], which have often [[collectivized]] work activities. If these states practice agricultural collectivism, they are often called [[Communist states]]. On the other hand, at the community scale, there are Israeli [[kibbutz]]im (voluntary communes where people live and [[farm]] together without private ownership), the [[Federation of Egalitarian Communities]] (non-hierarchical income-sharing intentional communities), and communities such as the [[Freetown Christiania]] in [[Denmark]] (a small anarchist political experiment centered on an abandoned [[military installation]] in [[Copenhagen]]; Christiania has laws abolishing [[private property]]).

Another type is [[fascism]], as well as all other forms of [[totalitarianism]] such as Stalinism, which emphasize certain ideologies such as [[nationalism]] and [[patriotism]] which can be considered reactionary forms of collectivism, as they emphasize the role of the nation or the state over individuals. Fascists and Nazis also supported [[class collaboration]] which was a reactionary form of collectivism related to nationalism but opposed to socialist forms of collectivism such as [[workplace democracy]]. However, [[Fascism]] and [[Nazism]] also ascribe to [[Social Darwinism]], which is an anti-collectivist reactionary form of individualism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne, Stanley G. 1945. pp. 485–486&quot;&gt;Payne, Stanley G. ''A History of Fascism, 1914–1945.'' Routledge, 1996. pp. 485–486.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry Triandis and Michele Gelfand argue that horizontal collectivist societies are those based on communal living, such as Israeli [[kibbutz]]im, while vertical collectivist societies are for example [[Stalinist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] countries or traditional communities with strong patriarchal leaders; vertical collectivism also correlates with [[Right-wing Authoritarianism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Triandis2&quot;/&gt;

[[Democracy]], with its emphasis on notions of [[social contract]] and the collective will of the people, has been characterized by some as a form of political collectivism.

==Criticism==
===Classical liberal critique===
There are two main objections to collectivism from the ideas of liberal individualism. One is that collectivism stifles individuality and diversity by insisting upon a common social identity, such as [[nationalism]], [[racialism]], or some other group focus. The other is that collectivism is linked to [[statism]] and the diminution of freedom when political authority is used to advance collectivist goals.&lt;ref&gt;Heywood, Andrew. Key Concepts in Politics. Palgrave Macmillan. p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of collectivism comes from [[individualist]]s, such as [[classical liberals]], [[libertarianism|libertarians]], [[individualist anarchists]], and [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivists]]. Perhaps the most notable modern criticism of collectivism is the one put forward by [[Friedrich Hayek]] in his book ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', published in 1944.

[[Ludwig von Mises]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;On the other hand the application of the basic ideas of collectivism cannot result in anything but social disintegration and the perpetuation of armed conflict. It is true that every variety of collectivism promises eternal peace starting with the day of its own decisive victory and the final overthrow and extermination of all other ideologies and their supporters. ... As soon as a faction has succeeded in winning the support of the majority of citizens and thereby attained control of the government machine, it is free to deny to the minority all those democratic rights by means of which it itself has previously carried on its own struggle for supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mises.org/story/2528 The Fallacy of Collectivism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ayn Rand]], founder of Objectivism, was a particularly vocal opponent who believed the philosophy of collectivism led to [[totalitarianism]]. She argued that &quot;collectivism means the subjugation of the individual to a group,&quot; and that &quot;throughout history, no tyrant ever rose to power except on the claim of representing ''the common good''.&quot; She further claimed that &quot;horrors which no man would dare consider for his own selfish sake are perpetrated with a clear conscience by ''[[altruism|altruists]]'' who justify themselves by the common good.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn. [http://fare.tunes.org/liberty/library/toptt.html The Only Path to Tomorrow], ''Readers Digest'', January 1944, pp. 88–90&lt;/ref&gt; (The &quot;altruists&quot; Rand refers to are not those who practice simple benevolence or charity, but rather those who believe in [[Auguste Comte]]'s [[altruism (ethical doctrine)|ethical doctrine of altruism]] which holds that there is &quot;a moral and political obligation of the individual to sacrifice his own interests for the sake of a greater social good.&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[[George H. Smith|Smith, George H.]] [http://www.lfb.com/index.php?action=help&amp;helpfile=randobj.htm ''Ayn Rand on Altruism, Egoism, and Rights'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socialist critique===
Many socialists, particularly [[Libertarian socialists]], [[democratic socialists]], [[individualist anarchists]] and some [[Marxists]] criticize the concept of collectivism. Some anti-collectivists often argue that all [[authoritarian]] and [[totalitarian]] societies are collectivist in nature. Socialists argue that modern capitalism and private property, which is based on [[Socialization (economics)|socialized production]] and joint-stock or [[Corporation|corporate ownership structures]], is a form of organic collectivism that sharply contrasts with the utopian picture of capitalism painted by its proponents as a system of free individuals exchanging commodities.&lt;ref&gt;''Capital, Volume 1'', by Marx, Karl. From &quot;Chapter 32: Historical Tendency of Capitalist Accumulation&quot;: &quot;Self-earned private property, that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent laboring-individual with the conditions of his labor, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labor of others, i.e., on wage-labor. As soon as this process of transformation has sufficiently decomposed the old society from top to bottom, as soon as the laborers are turned into proletarians, their means of labor into capital, as soon as the [[capitalist mode of production]] stands on its own feet, then the further socialization of labor and further transformation of the land and other means of production into socially exploited and, therefore, common means of production, as well as the further expropriation of private proprietors, takes a new form. That which is now to be expropriated is no longer the laborer working for himself, but the capitalist exploiting many laborers.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Socialists argue that true individualism can only exist when individuals are free from coercive social structures to pursue their own interests, which can only be accomplished by common ownership of socialized, productive assets and free access to the means of life so that no individual has coercive power over other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists'', by Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell. 1998. From &quot;Definitions of market and socialism&quot; (pp.&amp;nbsp;58–59): &quot;The control over the surplus product rests with the majority of the population through a resolutely democratic process...The sale of labour power is abolished and labour necessarily becomes creative. Everyone participates in running their institutions and society as a whole. No one controls anyone else.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Orwell]], a dedicated [[democratic socialist]],&lt;ref&gt;[[George Orwell|Orwell, George]] [http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/essays/whyiwrite.htm ''Why I Write'']&lt;/ref&gt; believed that collectivism resulted in the empowerment of a minority of individuals that led to further oppression of the majority of the population in the name of some ideal such as freedom.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It cannot be said too often - at any rate, it is not being said nearly often enough - that collectivism is not inherently democratic, but, on the contrary, gives to a tyrannical minority such powers as the [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish Inquisitors]] never dreamt of.&lt;ref name=&quot;George Orwell 1944&quot;&gt;George Orwell, review of ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' (1944)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yet in the subsequent sentence he also warns of the tyranny of private ownership over the means of production:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... that a return to 'free' competition means for the great mass of people a tyranny probably worse, because more irresponsible, than that of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;George Orwell 1944&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marxists criticize this use of the term &quot;collectivism,&quot; on the grounds that all societies are based on class interests and therefore all societies could be considered &quot;collectivist.&quot; The liberal ideal of the free individual is seen from a Marxist perspective as a smokescreen for the collective interests of the capitalist class.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} [[Social anarchists]] argue that &quot;individualism&quot; is a front for the interests of the upper class. As anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'rugged individualism'... is only a masked attempt to repress and defeat the individual and his individuality. So-called Individualism is the social and economic [[laissez-faire]]: the exploitation of the masses by the [ruling] classes by means of legal trickery, spiritual debasement and systematic indoctrination of the servile spirit ... That corrupt and perverse 'individualism' is the straitjacket of individuality. ... [It] has inevitably resulted in the greatest modern slavery, the crassest class distinctions driving millions to the breadline. 'Rugged individualism' has meant all the 'individualism' for the masters, while the people are regimented into a slave caste to serve a handful of self-seeking 'supermen.' ... Their 'rugged individualism' is simply one of the many pretenses the ruling class makes to mask unbridled business and political extortion.&lt;ref&gt;Red Emma Speaks, p. 112 and 443&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to criticism made by various pro-capitalist groups that claim that public ownership or common ownership of the [[means of production]] is a form of collectivism, socialists maintain that common ownership over productive assets does not infringe upon the individual, but is instead a liberating force that transcends the false dichotomy of individualism and collectivism.&lt;ref&gt;http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/i/n.htm#individualism&lt;/ref&gt; Socialists maintain that these critiques conflate the concept of private property in the means of production with personal possessions and individual production.

==Description==
''Nepeta'' species can be [[subshrub]]s, [[herbaceous perennial]]s or [[annual plant|annual]] herbs. '''''Nepeta cataria''''' (also known as '''catnip''', '''catswort''', or '''catmint''') is a plant in the [[Lamiaceae]] family. The common names can also be used to refer to the Nepeta genus as a whole. They are usually aromatic. The flowers are located in verticillasters grouped on spikes; or the verticillasters are arranged in opposite [[inflorescence|cymes]], [[raceme]]s, or [[panicle]]s. The calyx is tubular or campanulate, they are slightly curved or straight, and the limbs are often 2-lipped with five teeth. The lower lip is larger, with 3-lobes, and the middle lobe is the largest. The flowers have 4 hairless [[stamen]]s that are nearly parallel, and they ascend under the upper lip of the [[corolla (flower)|corolla]]. Two stamen are longer and stamens of [[gynoecium|pistillate]] flowers are rudimentary. The style protrudes outside of the mouth of the flowers. The fruits are nutlets, which are oblong-ovoid, ellipsoid, ovoid, or obovoid in shape. The surfaces of the nutlets can be slightly ribbed, smooth or warty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&amp;taxon_id=122138 | title = Nepeta | journal = [[Flora of China (journal)|Flora of China]] | volume = 17 | page = 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Catnip flowers.jpg|thumb|left|Flowers of the plant]]

''Nepeta cataria'' is mostly used as a recreational drug for [[domestic cat|pet cats']] enjoyment. Approximately two hours after an exposure, the feline will be sensitive to another dose.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The common behaviors that are observed are: rubbing on the plant, rolling on the ground, drooling, sleepiness, anxiety, or consuming much of the plant. The plant terpenoid ''[[nepetalactone]]'' is the main chemical constituent of the essential oil of ''Nepeta cataria'' and acts as a feline attractant. This chemical enters the feline's nose, and produces effects on the cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Siegel |first=Ronald K. |title=Intoxication: the universal drive for mind-altering substances |publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Company |isbn=9781594770692 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catnip has a history of human medicinal use for its soothing properties. It has also been known to have a slightly numbing effect. The plant has been consumed as a tea, juice, tincture, infusion or poultice, and has also been smoked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grognet, Jeff 1990&quot;&gt;Grognet, Jeff. 1990.

== Effects on cats ==

Catnip and catmints are mainly known for the behavioral effects they have on [[Felidae|cat]]s, not only domestic cats but [[big cat]]s also (lions, tigers, leopards, and so on).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grognet J |title=Catnip: Its uses and effects, past and present |journal=Can. Vet. J. |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=455–456 |year=1990 |month=June |pmid=17423611 |pmc=1480656}}&lt;/ref&gt; When cats sense the bruised leaves or stems of catnip, they may roll over it, paw at it, chew it, lick it, leap about and purr, or heavily salivate. Some will growl, [[meow]], scratch, or bite the hand holding it. Some cats will eat dried catnip. Often, eating too much can cause cats to be overtly aggressive, typically making them hiss.
[[Image:Catnip-effects.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A domestic cat demonstrating the effects of catnip such as rolling, pawing, and frisking]]

About two thirds of cats are susceptible to catnip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=experts-how-does-catnip-work-on-cats | title = How does catnip work its magic on cats? | first = Ramona | last = Turner | work = [[Scientific American]] | date = May 29, 2007 | accessdate = February 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon is [[hereditary]]; for example, most Australian cats do not react to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durand&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.catsplay.com/thedailycat/2003-04-14/mind_happycat/heavenly_catnip/heavenly_catnip.html | title = Heavenly Catnip | first = Marcella | last = Durand | date = March 4, 2003 | work = CatsPlay.com | accessdate = February 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some disagreement about the susceptibility of [[lion]]s and [[tiger]]s to catnip.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durand&quot;/&gt;

Catnip has [[nepetalactone]], a [[terpenoid]]. Nepetalactone can be extracted from catnip by [[steam distillation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.instructables.com/id/EMDCESQF2DSDRAG/ | title = DIY Kitty Crack: ultra-potent catnip extract | work = [[Instructables]] | date = June 3, 2007 | accessdate = February 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats detect it through their [[olfactory epithelium]], not through their [[vomeronasal organ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Analysis of the catnip reaction: mediation by olfactory system, not vomeronasal organ | pmid = 3834921 | doi = 10.1016/S0163-1047(85)91151-3 | last1 = Hart | first1 = Benjamin L. | last2 = Leedy | first2 = Mitzi G. | journal = Behavioral and neural biology | year = 1985 | month = July | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[olfactory epithelium]], the nepetalactone binds to one or more [[olfactory receptor]]s where it probably mimics a [[cat pheromone]], such as the hypothetical [[Cat pheromone|''feline facial pheromone'']] or the cat urine odorant [[3-Mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol|MMB]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Other plants that also have this effect on cats include [[Valerian (herb)|valerian]] (''Valeriana officinalis'') and plants that contain [[actinidine]] or [[dihydroactinidiolide]] (Smith, 2005).

==Species==
[[Image:Nepeta curviflora.jpg|thumb|''Nepeta curviflora'' flowers]]
*''[[Nepeta cataria]]'' (Catnip, True Catnip, Catmint or Field Balm) is a 50–100&amp;nbsp;cm tall perennial [[herb]] resembling [[Mentha|mint]] in appearance, with greyish-green leaves; the [[flower]]s are white, finely spotted with purple. It has been introduced to many countries, including the [[United States]]. A [[lemon]]-scented [[cultivar]], ''N. cataria'' 'Citriodora', looks exactly like true catnip but has the scent of lemons and can be used like [[Lemon balm]].

*''[[Nepeta grandiflora]]'' (Giant Catmint or Caucasus Catmint) is lusher than true catnip and has dark green leaves and dark blue, almost purple flowers.

*''[[Nepeta × faassenii]]'' (''N. racemosa'' × ''N. nepetella''; Faassen's Nepeta or Faassen's Catnip) is mostly grown as an [[ornamental plant]]. This [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] is far smaller than either of above and is almost a ground cover. It has greyish-green leaves and light purple flowers.

*Some ''[[Dracocephalum]]'', ''[[Glechoma]]'' and ''[[Calamintha]]'' species were formerly classified in ''Nepeta''.

*''Nepeta'' species are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species including ''[[Coleophora|Coleophora albitarsella]]''.

'''Cumin''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|juː|m|ɨ|n}} or {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|k|ʌ|m|ɨ|n}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|k|uː|m|ɨ|n}}; sometimes spelled '''cummin'''; '''''Cuminum cyminum''''') is a [[flowering plant]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Apiaceae]], native from the [[east Mediterranean]] to [[East India]]. Its seeds, in ground form, are used in the [[cuisine]]s of many different cultures.

==Etymology==
The English &quot;cumin&quot; derives from the [[Old English]] ''cymen'' (or [[Old French]] ''cumin''), from [[Latin]] ''cuminum'', &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dcuminum cuminum], 

Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] κύμινον (''kuminon''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dku%2Fminon κύμινον],known as saunf or سونف in Pakistan.

==Description==

Cumin is the dried seed of the herb ''Cuminum cyminum'', a member of the parsley family. The cumin plant grows to {{convert|30|–|50|cm|ft|abbr=on}} tall and is harvested by hand.  It is an [[herbaceous]] [[annual plant]], with a slender branched [[Plant stem|stem]] 20–30&amp;nbsp;cm tall. The [[leaf|leaves]] are 5–10&amp;nbsp;cm long, [[pinnate]] or bipinnate, thread-like leaflets. The [[flower]]s are small, white or pink, and borne in [[umbel]]s. The [[fruit]] is a lateral fusiform or [[ovoid]] [[achene]] 4–5&amp;nbsp;mm long, containing a single [[seed]]. Cumin seeds resemble [[caraway]] seeds, being oblong in shape, longitudinally ridged, and yellow-brown in color, like other members of the Umbelliferae family such as caraway, [[parsley]] and [[dill]].

==History==
[[Image:Sa cumin.jpg|thumb|right|Cumin Seeds]]

Cumin has been in use since ancient times. Seeds excavated at the [[Syria]]n site [[Tell ed-Der]] have been dated to the [[second millennium BC]]. They have also been reported from several [[New Kingdom]] levels of [[ancient Egyptian]] archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Zohary and Maria Hopf, ''Domestication of plants in the Old World'', third edition (Oxford: University Press, 2000), p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally cultivated in Iran and [[Mediterranean]] region, cumin is mentioned in the [[Bible]] in both the [[Old Testament]] ([[Isaiah]] 28:27) and the [[New Testament]] ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 23:23). It was also known in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]]. The Greeks kept cumin at the dining table in its own container (much as pepper is frequently kept today), and this practice continues in Morocco. Cumin fell out of favour in [[Europe]], except in [[Spain]] and [[Malta]], during the [[Middle Ages]]. It was introduced to the [[Americas]] by Spanish and Portuguese colonists.

It has since returned to favour in parts of Europe; today it is mostly grown in [[Iran]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Morocco]], [[Egypt]], [[India]], Syria, [[Mexico]], and [[Chile]]. The plant occurs as a rare casual in the British Isles, mainly in southern England, but the frequency of its occurrence has declined greatly; according to the Botanical Society of the British Isles' most recent Atlas, there has been only one confirmed record since the year 2000.

===Folklore===
Superstition during the Middle Ages cited cumin as keeping chickens and lovers from wandering. It was also believed a happy life awaited the bride and groom who carried cumin seed throughout the wedding ceremony.

==Cultivation==
[[Image:Historical CUMIN.jpg|thumb|right|232px|Cuminum cyminum Linn.]]

Cultivation of cumin requires a long, hot summer of 3–4 months, with daytime temperatures around {{convert|30|°C|°F|abbr=on}}; it is drought-tolerant, and is mostly grown in [[Mediterranean climate]]s. It is grown from seed, sown in spring, and needs fertile, well-drained soil.

==Uses==
Cumin is the second most popular spice in the world after black pepper.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foodreference.com/html/fcumin.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=August 2009}} Cumin seeds are used as a spice for their distinctive aroma, popular in [[Nepalese cuisine|Nepalese]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], [[Pakistani cuisine|Pakistani]], [[North African cuisine|North African]], [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]], [[Sri Lankan cuisine|Sri Lankan]], [[Cuban cuisine|Cuban]], northern [[Mexican cuisine]]s, central Asian [[Uzbek cuisine]], and the [[Western China|western Chinese cuisine]]s of [[Sichuan cuisine|Sichuan]] and [[Xinjiang cuisine|Xinjiang]]. Cumin can be found in some [[Netherlands|Dutch]] cheeses, such as [[Leyden cheese]], and in some traditional breads from [[France]]. It is commonly used in traditional Brazilian cuisine. Cumin can be an ingredient in [[chili powder]] (often Texan or Mexican-style), and is found in [[achiote]] blends, [[adobos]], [[sofrito]], [[garam masala]], [[curry powder]], and [[bahaarat]].

Cumin can be used ground or as whole seeds. Cumin was also used heavily in ancient Roman cuisine. It helps to add an earthy and warming feeling to cooking, making it a staple in certain stews and soups, as well as curries and chilli.

===Medicine===
In South Asia, cumin tea (dry seeds boiled in hot water) is used to distinguish false labour (due to gas) from real labour.

In Sri Lanka, toasting cumin seeds and then boiling them in water makes a tea used to soothe acute stomach problems.

People in parts of South Asia commonly believe cumin seeds help with digestion. Some scientific evidence suggests cumin may aid digestion by stimulating enzymes to break down foods.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.musc.edu/catalyst/archive/2006/co3-10spice.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutritional value==
{{nutritional value | name = Cumin seeds | kJ=1567 | protein=17.81 g | fat= 22.27 g | satfat=1.535 g | monofat = | carbs = 44.24 g | sugars=2.25 g | fiber = 10.5 g | riboflavin_mg=0.327 | niacin_mg=4.579 | folate_ug=10 | vitA_ug = 64 | vitB6_mg=0.435 | vitB12_ug=0 | vitC_mg=7.7 | vitE_mg=3.33 | vitK_ug=5.4 | calcium_mg=931 | iron_mg=66.36 | magnesium_mg=366 | phosphorus_mg=499 | potassium_mg=1788 | sodium_mg=168 | zinc_mg=4.8 | water=8.06 g | source_usda=1}}

Although cumin seeds contain a relatively large percentage of [[iron]], extremely large quantities of cumin would need to be consumed for it to serve as a significant dietary source (see nutrition data).

==Confusion with other spices==
[[Image:Black Cumin.jpg|thumb|left|Black Cumin seeds]]

Cumin is hotter to the taste, lighter in color, and larger than [[caraway]] (''Carum carvi''), another [[umbelliferous]] spice with which it is sometimes confused. Many European languages do not distinguish clearly between the two. For example, in Czech, caraway is called ''kmín'' while cumin is called ''římský kmín'' or Roman caraway. The distinction is practically the same in Hungarian (''kömény'' for caraway and ''római kömény'' [Roman caraway] for cumin). In Polish, the difference is even less significant- caraway is ''kminek'' and cumin is ''kmin rzymski'', which is even more confusing, as ''kminek'' is a diminutive of ''kmin''. In Swedish and Norwegian, caraway is called ''kummin'' while cumin is ''spiskummin'', from the Norwegian word ''spisa'', to eat, while in German, ''Kümmel'' stands for caraway and ''Kreuzkümmel'' denotes cumin. In Finnish, caraway is called ''kumina'', while cumin is ''roomankumina'' or ''juustokumina'' (cheese caraway). In Icelandic, caraway is ''kúmen'', while cumin is called ''kúmín''. In Romanian, ''chimen'' is the word for caraway, while ''chimion'' is cumin, the latter being less known.

The distantly related ''[[Bunium persicum]]'' and the unrelated ''[[Nigella sativa]]'' are both sometimes called [[black cumin]] (''q.v.'').

== Aroma profile ==
Cumin's distinctive flavour and strong, warm aroma is due to its [[essential oil]] content. Its main constituent and important [[aroma compound]] is [[cuminaldehyde]] (4-isopropylbenzaldehyde). Important aroma compounds of toasted cumin are the [[Substitution (chemistry)|substituted]] [[pyrazine]]s, 2-ethoxy-3-isopropylpyrazine, 2-methoxy-3-''sec''-butylpyrazine, and 2-methoxy-3-methylpyrazine.

The '''Cornish Nationalist Party''' (CNP), {{lang-kw|Party Kenethlegek Kernow}}, is an unregistered [[political party]] in the [[United Kingdom]], led by Dr [[James Whetter]] and campaigning for [[independence]] for [[Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;http://partikenethlekkernewek.fortunecity.com/index1.html &quot;Cornwall's full potential as an independent nation &quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed by people who left [[Mebyon Kernow]] on 28 May 1975.&lt;ref&gt;''Mebyon Kernow and Cornish Nationalism'' by Dick Cole, Bernard Deacon, and Gary Tregidda&lt;/ref&gt; The party ceased to exist in 2005, although it claimed to have reformed in April 2009 following a conference in [[Bodmin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/news/Cornish-Nationalist-Party-regroups-contest-elections/article-876558-detail/article.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did not contest the local or European elections in 2009.

A separate party with a similar name (the Cornish National Party)&lt;ref&gt;''Mebyon Kernow and Cornish Nationalism'' by Dick Cole, Bernard Deacon, and Gary Tregidda&lt;/ref&gt; existed from 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gosw.gov.uk/gosw/docs/254795/dev_of_language_literature.doc In 1969 a CNP was formed.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The split was down to the same debate that was occurring in most of the political parties campaigning for [[self-governance|autonomy]] from the United Kingdom at the time (for example the [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Plaid Cymru]]), whether to be a [[centre-left]] party appealing to the electorate on a [[social democracy|social democratic]] line, or whether to appeal emotionally on a [[centre-right]] cultural line. Another subject of the split was whether to embrace [[devolution]] as a first step to full [[independence]] (or as the sole step if this was what the electorate wished) or for it to be &quot;all or nothing&quot;).

The CNP essentially represented the party's [[right wing]], who were not willing to accept that economic arguments were more likely to win votes than cultural. 

The CNP worked to preserve the identity of Cornwall and improve its economy, and encouraged links with Cornish people overseas and with other regions which have distinct identities. It also gave support to [[Cornish language|Unified Cornish]], the language of the Cornish revival in modern times, and commemorated [[Thomas Flamank]], a leader of the [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497|Cornish Rebellion]] in 1497, at an annual ceremony at [[Bodmin]] on 27 June each year.

While the CNP were not a racist organisation there was a perceived image problem relating to the similarly-styled [[British National Party]] (BNP). Today, the Cornish Nationalist Party is seen as more of a pressure group as they do not put up candidates for local, general or European elections. {{As of|2006}}, they are not registered on the UK political parties register; Mebyon Kernow are the only registered political party based in Cornwall{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

The Dr Whetter and the CNP still publish a quarterly journal, ''The Cornish Banner'' (''An Baner Kernewek''). This is done within the actions of the Roseland Institute.

==Recurrence==
It was announced in April 2009 that the Cornish Nationalist Party (now abbreviated CPN) had re-grouped to contest future elections.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/news/Cornish-Nationalist-Party-regroups-contest-elections/article-876558-detail/article.html&lt;/ref&gt; It had been announced, however, that the new main aim of the party is support of the new [[2009_structural_changes_to_local_government_in_England#Single_authorities|Unitary Authority]] in Cornwall, something that is unpopular with many of the citizens.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:FIALKA-rotors-in-machine.jpg|right|thumb|Close-up of the rotors in a [[Fialka]] cipher machine]]

''Cryptanalysis'' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kryptós'', &quot;hidden&quot;, and ''analýein'', &quot;to loosen&quot; or &quot;to untie&quot;) is the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of [[encrypt]]ed information, without access to the [[secret]] information that is normally required to do so. Typically, this involves knowing how the system works and finding a [[secret key]]. In non-technical language, this is the practice of '''codebreaking''' or '''cracking the code''', although these phrases also have a specialised technical meaning (see [[code (cryptography)|code]]).

&quot;Cryptanalysis&quot; is also used to refer to any attempt to circumvent the security of other types of [[cryptographic]] [[algorithm]]s and [[cryptographic protocol|protocols]] in general, and not just [[encryption]]. However, cryptanalysis usually excludes methods of attack that do not primarily target weaknesses in the actual [[cryptography]], such as [[bribery]], [[rubber-hose cryptanalysis|physical coercion]], [[burglary]], [[keystroke logging]], and [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]], although these types of attack are an important concern and are often more effective than traditional cryptanalysis.

Even though the goal has been the same, the methods and techniques of cryptanalysis have changed drastically through the history of cryptography, adapting to increasing cryptographic complexity, ranging from the pen-and-paper methods of the past, through machines like [[Bombe]]s and [[Colossus computer]]s in [[World War II]], to the computer-based schemes of the present. The results of cryptanalysis have also changed — it is no longer possible to have unlimited success in codebreaking, and there is a hierarchical classification of what constitutes an attack. In the mid-1970s, a new class of cryptography was introduced: [[asymmetric cryptography]]. Methods for breaking these [[cryptosystem]]s are typically radically different from before, and usually involve solving carefully constructed problems in [[pure mathematics]], the best-known being [[integer factorization]].

==History of cryptanalysis==
{{Main|History of cryptography}}

Cryptanalysis has [[coevolution|coevolved]] together with cryptography, and the contest can be traced through the [[history of cryptography]]—new [[cipher]]s being designed to replace old broken designs, and new cryptanalytic techniques invented to crack the improved schemes. In practice, they are viewed as two sides of the same coin: in order to create secure cryptography, you have to design against possible cryptanalysis.

===Classical cryptanalysis===
[[Image:Al-kindi-cryptanalysis.png|thumb|right|First page of [[Al-Kindi]]'s 9th century ''Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages'']]

Although the actual word &quot;''cryptanalysis''&quot; is relatively recent (it was coined by [[William Friedman]] in 1920), methods for breaking [[code (cryptography)|codes]] and [[cipher]]s are much older. The first known recorded explanation of cryptanalysis was given by 9th-century [[Arab]]ian [[polymath]], Al-Kindi (also known as &quot;Alkindus&quot; in Europe), in ''A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages''. This treatise includes a description of the method of [[frequency analysis]] ([[Ibrahim Al-Kadi]], 1992- ref-3). [[Italy|Italian]] scholar [[Giambattista della Porta]] was author of a seminal work on cryptanalysis ''&quot;De Furtivis Literarum Notis&quot;.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cryptool.org/content/view/28/54/lang,english/ Crypto History ]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frequency analysis]] is the basic tool for breaking most [[classical cipher]]s. In natural languages, certain letters of the [[alphabet]] appear more frequently than others; in [[English language|English]], &quot;[[E]]&quot; is likely to be the most common letter in any sample of [[plaintext]]. Similarly, the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] &quot;TH&quot; is the most likely pair of letters in English, and so on. Frequency analysis relies on a cipher failing to hide these [[statistics]]. For example, in a [[simple substitution cipher]] (where each letter is simply replaced with another), the most frequent letter in the [[ciphertext]] would be a likely candidate for &quot;E&quot;. Frequency analysis of such a cipher is therefore relatively easy, provided that the ciphertext is long enough to give a reasonably representative count of the letters of the alphabet that it contains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|1999|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries, the idea of a [[Polyalphabetic cipher|polyalphabetic substitution cipher]] was developed, among others by the French diplomat [[Blaise de Vigenère]] (1523–96).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|1999|pp=45–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some three centuries, the [[Vigenère cipher]], which uses a repeating key to select different encryption alphabets in rotation, was considered to be completely secure (''le chiffre indéchiffrable''—&quot;the indecipherable cipher&quot;). Nevertheless, [[Charles Babbage]] (1791–1871) and later, independently, [[Friedrich Kasiski]] (1805–81) succeeded in breaking this cipher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|1999|pp=63–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]], inventors in several countries developed [[rotor cipher machine]]s such as [[Arthur Scherbius]]' [[Enigma machine|Enigma]], in an attempt to minimise the repetition that had been exploited to break the Vigenère system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|1999|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, frequency analysis relies as much on [[linguistics|linguistic]] knowledge as it does on statistics, but as ciphers became more complex, [[mathematics]] became more important in cryptanalysis. This change was particularly evident before and during [[World War II]], where efforts to crack [[Axis Powers|Axis]] ciphers required new levels of mathematical sophistication. Moreover, automation was first applied to cryptanalysis in that era with the Polish [[Bomba (cryptography)|Bomba]] device, the British [[Bombe]] development of it, the use of [[punched card]] equipment, and in the [[Colossus computers]] — the first electronic digital computers to be controlled by a program.

===Depth===
Sending two or more messages with the same key is an insecure process. To a cryptanalyst the messages are then said to be ''&quot;in depth&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchhouse|2002|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be detected by the messages having the same ''[[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator]]'' by which the sending operator informs the receiving operator about the [[Key (cryptography)|key generator initial settings]] for the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchhouse|2002|pp= 33, 86}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a symmetrical cipher, the same key that was applied to the [[plaintext]] to produce the [[ciphertext]] is applied to the ciphertext to recover the plaintext. A simple example of such a system is the [[Gilbert Vernam|Vernam cipher]] in which a long key is bit-for-bit combined with the plaintext or ciphertext using the &quot;[[XOR]]&quot; operator (symbolized by &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;Plaintext \oplus Key = Ciphertext&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; at each bit position
and
:&lt;math&gt;Ciphertext \oplus Key = Plaintext&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; at each bit position
When the ciphertexts are in depth, combining them eliminates the common key, leaving just a combination of the two plaintexts:
:&lt;math&gt;Ciphertext1 \oplus Ciphertext2 = \alpha = Plaintext1\oplus Plaintext2&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; at each bit position
The individual plaintexts can then be worked out by trying ''probable words'' (or phrases) at various locations; when the corresponding section of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is XORed with a correct guess at the probable word, a stretch of the other plaintext is revealed, which can be recognized and (quite often) extended at each end, working back and forth between the plaintexts to recover much or all of them. When a recovered plaintext is then combined with its ciphertext, the key is revealed:
:&lt;math&gt;Plaintext1 \oplus Ciphertext1 = Key&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; at each bit position
Knowledge of keys from a cipher may allow cryptanalysts to work out the system used for constructing them.

Depth reading can be applied in more complicated contexts to eliminate some of a system's parameters, or to &quot;stack&quot; messages so that source language statistics become exploitable. One way to properly align multiple messages that use the same periodic key starting at different positions is by the [[Index of coincidence#Generalization|kappa test]].

===Modern cryptanalysis===
[[Image:TuringBombeBletchleyPark.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Bombe replicated the action of several [[Enigma machine]]s wired together. Each of the rapidly rotating drums, pictured above in a [[Bletchley Park]] museum mockup, simulated the action of an Enigma rotor.]]

Even though computation was used to great effect in [[cryptanalysis of the Enigma]] and other systems during World War II, it also made possible new methods of cryptography [[orders of magnitude]] more complex than ever before. Taken as a whole, modern cryptography has become much more impervious to cryptanalysis than the pen-and-paper systems of the past, and now seems to have the upper hand against pure cryptanalysis. The historian [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] notes, {{quote|&quot;Many are the cryptosystems offered by the hundreds of commercial vendors today that cannot be broken by any known methods of cryptanalysis. Indeed, in such systems even a [[Chosen-plaintext attack|chosen plaintext attack]], in which a selected plaintext is matched against its ciphertext, cannot yield the key that unlock[s] other messages. In a sense, then, cryptanalysis is dead. But that is not the end of the story. Cryptanalysis may be dead, but there is - to mix my metaphors - more than one way to skin a cat.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] [http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/kahn.html Remarks on the 50th Anniversary of the National Security Agency], November 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Kahn goes on to mention increased opportunities for interception, [[bugging]], [[side channel attack]]s, and [[quantum cryptography|quantum computers]] as replacements for the traditional means of cryptanalysis. In 2010, former NSA technical director Brian Snow said that both academic and government cryptographers are &quot;moving very slowly forward in a mature field.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tim Greene, Network World, [http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/030410-rsa-cloud-security-warning.html Former NSA tech chief: I don't trust the cloud]. Retrieved March 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, any postmortems for cryptanalysis may be premature. While the effectiveness of cryptanalytic methods employed by intelligence agencies remains unknown, many serious attacks against both academic and practical cryptographic primitives have been published in the modern era of computer cryptography:

*The [[block cipher]] [[Madryga]], proposed in 1984 but not widely used, was found to be susceptible to [[ciphertext-only attack]]s in 1998.
*[[FEAL|FEAL-4]], proposed as a replacement for the [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] standard encryption algorithm but not widely used, was demolished by a spate of attacks from the academic community, many of which are entirely practical.
*The [[A5/1]], [[A5/2]], [[CMEA (cipher)|CMEA]], and [[DECT Standard Cipher|DECT]] systems used in [[mobile phone|mobile]] and wireless phone technology can all be broken in hours, minutes or even in real-time using widely-available computing equipment.
*[[Brute-force search|Brute-force keyspace search]] has broken some real-world ciphers and applications, including single-DES (see [[EFF DES cracker]]), [[Cryptography#Export controls|40-bit &quot;export-strength&quot; cryptography]], and the [[Content Scrambling System|DVD Content Scrambling System]].
*In 2001, [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP), a protocol used to secure [[Wi-Fi]] [[wireless network]]s, was shown to be breakable in practice because of a weakness in the [[RC4]] cipher and aspects of the WEP design that made [[related-key attack]]s practical. WEP was later replaced by [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]].
*In 2008, researchers conducted a proof-of-concept break of [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] using weaknesses in the [[MD5]] [[Cryptographic hash function|hash function]] and certificate issuer practices that made it possible to exploit [[collision attack]]s on hash functions. The certificate issuers involved changed their practices to prevent the attack from being repeated.

Thus, while the best modern ciphers may be far more resistant to cryptanalysis than the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]], cryptanalysis and the broader field of [[information security]] remain quite active.

===The results of cryptanalysis===
[[Image:Zimmermann-telegramm-offen.jpg|thumb|right|The decrypted [[Zimmermann Telegram]].]]

Successful cryptanalysis has undoubtedly influenced history; the ability to read the presumed-secret thoughts and plans of others can be a decisive advantage. For example, in England in 1587, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] was tried and executed for [[treason]] for her involvement in three plots to assassinate [[Elizabeth I of England]] which were known about because her coded correspondence with fellow conspirators had been deciphered by [[Thomas Phelippes]]; in [[World War I]], the breaking of the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] was instrumental in bringing the United States into the war; in [[World War II]], the cryptanalysis of the German ciphers — including the [[Enigma machine]] and the [[Lorenz cipher]] — has been credited with everything between shortening the end of the European war by a few months to determining the eventual result (see [[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]]). The [[United States]] also benefited from the cryptanalysis of the Japanese [[Purple (cipher machine)|Purple]] code (see [[Magic (cryptography)|Magic]]).

Governments have long recognized the potential benefits of cryptanalysis for [[Military espionage|intelligence]], both military and diplomatic, and established dedicated organizations devoted to breaking the codes and ciphers of other nations, for example, [[GCHQ]] and the [[NSA]], organizations which are still very active today. In 2004, it was reported that the United States had broken [[Iran]]ian ciphers. (It is unknown, however, whether this was pure cryptanalysis, or whether other factors were involved:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3804895.stm | work=BBC News | title=Breaking codes: An impossible task? | date=June 21, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Types of cryptanalytic attack==
Cryptanalytic attacks vary in potency and how much of a threat they pose to real-world [[cryptosystem]]s. A ''certificational weakness'' is a theoretical attack that is unlikely to be applicable in any real-world situation; the majority of results found in modern cryptanalytic research are of this type. Essentially, the practical importance of an attack is dependent on the answers to the following four questions:

#What [[knowledge]] and capabilities does the attacker need?
#How much additional secret information is deduced?
#How much computation is required? (What is the [[computational complexity]]?)
#Does the attack break the full cryptosystem, or only a weakened version?

===Access needed for the attack===
Cryptanalysis can be performed under a number of assumptions about how much access the attacker has to the system under attack. As a basic starting point it is normally assumed that, for the purposes of analysis, the general [[algorithm]] is known; this is [[Kerckhoffs' principle]] of &quot;the enemy knows the system&quot;. This is a reasonable assumption in practice — throughout history, there are countless examples of secret algorithms falling into wider knowledge, variously through [[espionage]], [[betrayal]] and [[reverse engineering]]. (On occasion, ciphers have been reconstructed through pure deduction; for example, the German [[Lorenz cipher]] and the Japanese [[Purple code]], and a variety of classical schemes).

Other assumptions include:
*''[[Ciphertext-only attack|Ciphertext-only]]'': the cryptanalyst has access only to a collection of [[ciphertext]]s or [[codetext]]s.
*''[[Known-plaintext attack|Known-plaintext]]'': the attacker has a set of ciphertexts to which he knows the corresponding [[plaintext]].
*''[[Chosen plaintext attack|Chosen-plaintext]]'' (''[[chosen ciphertext attack|chosen-ciphertext]]''): the attacker can obtain the ciphertexts (plaintexts) corresponding to an arbitrary set of plaintexts (ciphertexts) of his own choosing.
*''[[Adaptive chosen plaintext attack|Adaptive chosen-plaintext]]'': like a chosen-plaintext attack, except the attacker can choose subsequent plaintexts based on information learned from previous encryptions. Similarly ''[[Adaptive chosen ciphertext attack]]''.
*''[[Related-key attack]]'': Like a chosen-plaintext attack, except the attacker can obtain ciphertexts encrypted under two different keys. The keys are unknown, but the relationship between them is known; for example, two keys that differ in the one bit.

These types of attack clearly differ in how plausible they would be to mount in practice. Although some are more likely than others, cryptographers will often take a conservative approach to security and assume the worst-case when designing algorithms, reasoning that if a scheme is secure even against unrealistic threats, then it should also resist real-world cryptanalysis as well.

The assumptions are often more realistic than they might seem upon first glance. For a known-plaintext attack, the cryptanalyst might well know or be able to guess at a likely part of the plaintext, such as an encrypted letter beginning with &quot;Dear Sir&quot;, or a computer session starting with &quot;&lt;tt&gt;LOGIN:&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. A chosen-plaintext attack is less likely, but it is sometimes plausible: for example, you could convince someone to forward a message you have given them, but in [[encrypted]] form. Related-key attacks are mostly theoretical, although they can be realistic in certain situations, for example, when constructing [[cryptographic hash function]]s using a [[block cipher]].

===Usefulness of attack results===
The results of cryptanalysis can also vary in usefulness. For example, cryptographer [[Lars Knudsen]] (1998) classified various types of attack on [[block cipher]]s according to the amount and quality of secret information that was discovered:
*''Total break'' — the attacker deduces the secret [[key (cryptography)|key]].
*''Global deduction'' — the attacker discovers a functionally equivalent [[algorithm]] for encryption and decryption, but without learning the key.
*''Instance (local) deduction'' — the attacker discovers additional plaintexts (or ciphertexts) not previously known.
*''Information deduction'' — the attacker gains some [[Information entropy|Shannon information]] about plaintexts (or ciphertexts) not previously known.
*''Distinguishing algorithm'' — the attacker can distinguish the cipher from a random [[permutation]].

Similar considerations apply to attacks on other types of cryptographic algorithm.

===Computational resources required===
Attacks can also be characterised by the resources they require. Those resources include:
*Time — the number of ''computation steps'' (like encryptions) which must be performed.
*Memory — the amount of ''storage'' required to perform the attack.
*Data — the quantity of ''plaintexts and ciphertexts'' required.

It's sometimes difficult to predict these quantities precisely, especially when the attack isn't practical to actually implement for testing. But academic cryptanalysts tend to provide at least the estimated ''order of magnitude'' of their attacks' difficulty, saying, for example, &quot;[http://eurocrypt2009rump.cr.yp.to/837a0a8086fa6ca714249409ddfae43d.pdf SHA-1 collisions now 2&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;]&quot;

[[Bruce Schneier]] notes that even computationally impractical attacks can be considered breaks: &quot;Breaking a cipher simply means finding a weakness in the cipher that can be exploited with a complexity less than brute force. Never mind that brute-force might require 2&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt; encryptions; an attack requiring 2&lt;sup&gt;110&lt;/sup&gt; encryptions would be considered a break...simply put, a break can just be a certificational weakness: evidence that the cipher does not perform as advertised.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;schneier&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- Birthday attacks; man in the middle / time-memory tradeoff --&gt;

===Partial breaks===
Academic attacks are often against weakened versions of a cryptosystem, such as a block cipher or hash function with some rounds removed. Many, but not all, attacks become exponentially more difficult to execute as rounds are added to a cryptosystem,&lt;ref&gt;For an example of an attack that cannot be prevented by additional rounds, see [[slide attack]].&lt;/ref&gt; so it's possible for the full cryptosystem to be strong even though reduced-round variants are weak. Nonetheless, partial breaks that come close to breaking the original cryptosystem may mean that a full break will follow; the successful attacks on [[DES]], [[MD5]], and [[SHA-1]] were all preceded by attacks on weakened versions.

===Academic weakness versus practical weakness===
In academic cryptography, a ''weakness'' or a ''break'' in a scheme is usually defined quite conservatively: it might require impractical amounts of time, memory, or known plaintexts. It also might require the attacker be able to do things many real-world attackers can't: for example, the attacker may need to choose particular plaintexts to be encrypted or even to ask for plaintexts to be encrypted using several keys related to the secret key. Furthermore, it might only reveal a small amount of information, enough to prove the cryptosystem imperfect but too little to be useful to real-world attackers. Finally, an attack might only apply to a weakened version of cryptographic tools, like a reduced-round block cipher, as a step towards breaking of the full system.&lt;ref name=schneier&gt;{{Harvnb|Schneier|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cryptanalysis of asymmetric cryptography==
[[Asymmetric cryptography]] (or [[public key cryptography]]) is cryptography that relies on using two keys; one private, and one public. Such ciphers invariably rely on &quot;hard&quot; [[mathematical problem]]s as the basis of their security, so an obvious point of attack is to develop methods for solving the problem. The security of two-key cryptography depends on mathematical questions in a way that single-key cryptography generally does not, and conversely links cryptanalysis to wider mathematical research in a new way.

Asymmetric schemes are designed around the (conjectured) difficulty of solving various mathematical problems. If an improved algorithm can be found to solve the problem, then the system is weakened. For example, the security of the [[Diffie-Hellman key exchange]] scheme depends on the difficulty of calculating the [[discrete logarithm]]. In 1983, [[Don Coppersmith]] found a faster way to find discrete logarithms (in certain groups), and thereby requiring cryptographers to use larger groups (or different types of groups). RSA's security depends (in part) upon the difficulty of [[integer factorization]] — a breakthrough in factoring would impact the security of RSA.

In 1980, one could factor a difficult 50-digit number at an expense of 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; elementary computer operations. By 1984 the state of the art in factoring algorithms had advanced to a point where a 75-digit number could be factored in 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; operations. Advances in computing technology also meant that the operations could be performed much faster, too. [[Moore's law]] predicts that computer speeds will continue to increase. Factoring techniques may continue to do so as well, but will most likely depend on mathematical insight and creativity, neither of which has ever been successfully predictable. 150-digit numbers of the kind once used in RSA have been factored. The effort was greater than above, but was not unreasonable on fast modern computers. By the start of the 21st century, 150-digit numbers were no longer considered a large enough [[key size]] for RSA. Numbers with several hundred digits were still considered too hard to factor in 2005, though methods will probably continue to improve over time, requiring key size to keep pace or other methods such as [[elliptic curve cryptography]] to be used.

Another distinguishing feature of asymmetric schemes is that, unlike attacks on symmetric cryptosystems, any cryptanalysis has the opportunity to make use of knowledge gained from the [[public key]].

==Quantum computing applications for cryptanalysis==
[[Quantum computer]]s, which are still in the early phases of research, have potential use in cryptanalysis. For example, [[Shor's Algorithm]] could factor large numbers in [[polynomial time]], in effect breaking some commonly used forms of public-key encryption.

By using [[Grover's algorithm]] on a quantum computer, brute-force key search can be made quadratically faster. However, this could be countered by doubling the key length.

{{Refimprove|date=July 2010}}

The terms '''''Chicano''''' and '''''Chicana''''' (also spelled ''Xicana'') are used in reference to [[United States|U.S.]] citizens of [[Mexico|Mexican]] descent. The term began to be widely used during the [[Chicano Movement]], mainly among [[Mexican Americans]], especially in the movement's peak in the late 1960s and early 1970s. For Mexicans the meaning of Chicano meant &quot;poorest of the poor&quot; but during the Civil Rights movement they used the word to unite themselves.

==Etymology==
{{Copyedit-section|date=July 2010}}

[[File:chicano teen.jpg|thumb|left|150px|&quot;Chicano teenager in El Paso's second ward. A classic barrio which is slowly giving way to urban renewal.&quot; South [[El Paso, Texas]], July 1972. Photograph by [[Danny Lyon]].]]

The origin of the word &quot;chicano&quot; is disputed. Some critics claim it is a shorterned form of Mexicano (Mexican in Spanish). Mexico as spoken in its original Nahuatl and by the Spaniards at the time of the conquest was pronounced originally with a &quot;sh&quot; sound as opposed to current pronunciation and transcribed with an &quot;x&quot; as was the usage in Spanish at the time. The difference between the pronunciation and spelling of chicano and mexicano stems from the fact that the modern-day Spanish language experienced a change in pronunciation regarding a majority of words containing the &quot;x&quot; (for example, México, Ximenez, Xavier, Xarabe). The &quot;sh&quot; sound was dropped and in most, but not all, cases accompanied by a change of spelling (x to j). The word Chicano in the US was evidently not affected by this change.

The Chicano poet and writer [[Tino Villanueva]] traces the first documented use of the term to 1911 as referenced in a then-unpublished essay by University of Texas anthropologist José Limón.&lt;ref&gt;Félix Rodríguez González, ed. ''Spanish Loanwords in the English Language. A Tendency towards Hegemony Reversal''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, 1996. Villanueva is referring to Limón's essay &quot;The Folk Performance of Chicano and the Cultural Limits of Political Ideology,&quot; available via [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED198695&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED198695 ERIC]. Limón refers to use of the word in a 1911 report titled &quot;Hot tamales&quot; in the Spanish language newspaper ''La Crónica'' in 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists Edward R. Simmen and Richard F. Bauerle report the use of the term in an essay by Mexican American writer, Mario Suárez, published in the ''Arizona Quarterly'' in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Edward R. Simmen and Richard F. Bauerle. &quot;Chicano: Origin and Meaning.&quot; ''American Speech'' 44.3 (Autumn 1969): 225-230.&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican Americans were not identified as a racial/ethnic category prior to the 1980 US Census when the term Hispanic was first used.

Some believe that the word ''chicamo'' somehow became ''chicano,'' which, unlike ''chicamo,'' reflects the grammatical conventions of Spanish-language ethno- and demonyms, such as ''americano,'' ''castellano,'' or ''peruano.'' However, Chicanos generally do not agree that &quot;chicamo&quot; was ever a word used within the culture as its assertion is thus far entirely unsubstantiated. Therefore, most Chicanos do not agree that Chicano was ever derived from the word &quot;chicamo&quot;. There is ample literary evidence to further substantiate that Chicano is a self-declaration as a large body of Chicano literature exists with publication dates far predating the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} There is also a substantial body of Chicano literature that predates both Raso and the Federal Census Bureau.

As stated in the [[Handbook of Texas]]:
:&quot;According to one explanation, the pre-Columbian tribes in Mexico called themselves [[Meshica]]s, and the Spaniards, employing the letter x (which at that time represented a sh and ch sound), spelled it Mexicas. The Indians later referred to themselves as Meshicanos and even as Shicanos, thus giving birth to the term Chicano.&quot;

Thus far, the origins of the word remain inconclusive as the term is not used outside Mexican-American communities, further indicating that the term is primarily self-identifying.

==Meanings==
{{See also|Chicano studies}}

The term's meanings are highly debatable, but self-described Chicanos view the term as a positive self-identifying social construction. Outside of Mexican-American communities the term is considered pejorative and takes on subjective view but usually consists of one or more of the following elements:

===Ethnic identity===
[[File:LA teens.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Chicano teenagers in [[Venice, California]], 1974]]

From a popular perspective, the term ''Chicano'' became widely visible outside of Chicano communities during the American civil rights movement. It was commonly used during the mid 1960s by Mexican American activists,&lt;ref&gt;Moore, J. W., &amp; Cuéllar, A. B. (1970). ''Mexican Americans''. Ethnic groups in American life series. Englewood, Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall. p. 149. ISBN 0135794900&lt;/ref&gt; who, in attempt to reassert their civil rights, tried to rid the word of its polarizing negative connotation by reasserting a unique ethnic identity and political consciousness, proudly identifying themselves as ''Chicanos''. Some believe that Chicano can also represent Chicago, IL people who are from Mexico as of a combination of: Chi(cago)(Mexi)cano.(suggested by Carlos Flores). Others believe it was a corrupted term of &quot;Chilango&quot;, an inhabitant from Mexico City; and even from the term &quot;Chileno&quot; by the Chilean presence in mid 19th-century California. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Political identity===
According to the [[Handbook of Texas]]:

{{quote|Inspired by the courage of the farmworkers, by the California strikes led by [[César Chávez]], and by the Anglo-American youth revolt of the period, many Mexican-American university students came to participate in a crusade for social betterment that was known as the Chicano movement. They used Chicano to denote their rediscovered heritage, their youthful assertiveness, and their militant agenda. Though these students and their supporters used Chicano to refer to the entire Mexican-American population, they understood it to have a more direct application to the politically active parts of the Tejano community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

At certain points in the 1970s, ''Chicano'' was the preferred term for reference to Mexican-Americans, particularly in the scholarly literature.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} However, as the term became politicized, its use fell out of favor as a means of referring to the entire population. Since then, ''Chicano'' has tended to refer to politicized Mexican-Americans.

[[Sabine Ulibarri]], an author from [[Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico]], once attempted to note that ''Chicano'' was a [[Politics|politically]] &quot;loaded&quot; term, although Ulibarri has recanted that assessment. Chicano is considered to be a positive term of honor by many.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Ambiguous identity===

For Chicanos, the term usually implies being &quot;neither from here, nor from there&quot; in reference to the US and Mexico{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. As a mixture of [[culture]]s from both countries, being Chicano represents the struggle of being accepted into the [[Anglo]]-dominated society of the United States while maintaining the cultural sense developed as a Latino-cultured U.S. born Mexican child{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.

===Indigenous identity===

*Leo Limón: &quot;...because that's what a Chicano is, an indigenous Mexican American&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

One theory is the origin of such terminology is from the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] temple ''[[Chichen Itza]]'' in the [[Yucatan Peninsula]], a ruin of an ancient MesoAmerican civilization about 1,500 years ago. Chicano may be a Hispanized word for ''Chichen'' or the Mayan descendants, not limited to Aztec descendants or Nahuatl people.
But essentially Chicanos, like many Mexicans, are American Indians who were influenced by the Spanish culture through conquest. While Latino or Hispanic refers to race/genetics. Therefore Latinos are Americans who are descendants of the Latin group namely Spain,France,Italy,Portugal and Hispanic refers to the descendants from the Iberian Peninsula. Also known as Ibero-American.

===Political device===
*[[Reies Tijerina]]: &quot;The Anglo press degradized the word 'Chicano'. They use it to divide us. We use it to unify ourselves with our people and with Latin America.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Reies Tijerina was a vocal claimant to the rights of Hispanics and Mexican Americans, and he remains a major figure of the early Chicano Movement.

===Term of derision===
{{cleanup|section|date=December 2007}}
Long a disparaging term in Mexico, the term Chicano gradually transformed from a class-based term of derision to one of ethnic pride and general usage within Mexican-American communities beginning with the rise of the [[Chicano movement]] in the 1960s. In their &quot;Latinas in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia,&quot; Vicki Ruíz and Virginia Sánchez report that demographic differences in the adoption of the term existed; because of the prior vulgar connotations, it was more likely to be used by males than females, and as well, less likely to be used among those in a higher socioeconomic status. Usage was also generational, with the more assimilated third-generation members (again, more likely male) likely to adopt the usage. This group was also younger, of more radical persuasion, and less connected to a Mexican cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Vicki L. Ruiz &amp; Virginia Sanchez Korrol, editors. ''Latinas in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia''. Indiana University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maria Herrera-Sobek. Chicano folklore; a handbook. Greenwood Press 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his essay &quot;Chicanismo&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures'' (2002), [[Jose Cuellar]] dates the transition from derisive to positive to the late 1950s, with a usage by young Mexican-American high school students.&lt;ref&gt;José B. Cuéllar. [http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~josecuel/chicanismo.htm CHICANISMO/XICANISM@.] In: Davíd Carrasco, Editor-in-Chief. The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures: The Civilizations of Mexico and Central America, Oxford University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of Mexican American communities, the term might assume a negative meaning if it is used in a manner that embodies the prejudices and bigotries long directed at Mexican and Mexican-American people in the United States. For example, in one case, a prominent Chicana feminist writer and poet has indicated the following subjective meaning through her creative work.
*[[Ana Castillo]]: &quot;[a] marginalized, brown woman who is treated as a foreigner and is expected to do menial labor and ask nothing of the society in which she lives.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

&lt;/ref&gt;

Ana Castillo has referred to herself as a Chicana, and her literary work reflects that she primarily considers the term to be a positive one of self-determination and political solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.cla.umn.edu/vg/Bios/entries/castillo_ana.html |title=VG: Artist Biography: Castillo, Ana |publisher=Voices.cla.umn.edu |date= |accessdate=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speakingofstories.org/Author%20Bios/anna_castillo.htm |title=Anna Castillo |publisher=Speakingofstories.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_Castillo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ769174&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ769174 |title=The Chicana Subject in Ana Castillo's Fiction and the Discursive Zone of Chicana/o Theory |publisher=Eric.ed.gov |date= |accessdate=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anacastillo.com/a/index.php?page_id=6 |title=anacastillo.com » Bio |publisher=Anacastillo.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mexican archeologist and anthropologist [[Manuel Gamio]] reported in 1930 that the term ''chicamo'' (with an &quot;m&quot;) was used as a derogatory term used by Hispanic Texans for recently arrived Mexican immigrants displaced during the [[Mexican revolution]] in the beginning of the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the term Chicano began to reference those who resisted total assimilation, while the term [[Pocho]]s referred (often pejoratively) to those who strongly advocated assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;See: Adalberto M.

==Rejection==
While many Mexican Americans embrace the term Chicano, others prefer to identify themselves as:{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
* American of Mexican descent
* [[Hispanic]]
* Hispanic American
* [[Hispanos|Hispano]]/a
* [[Latino]]/a
* Latin American
* Mexican(o/a)
* Mexican American
* &quot;Brown&quot;&quot;White&quot; &quot;Mix&quot;  people, race, pride, and so on.
* ''Californio'', ''Nuevomexicano'' ([[New Mexican]] [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) or ''[[Tejano]]''/a.
* Raza

''Norteño'' as in the Mexicans referred to the Northern Mexico as ''el Norte'' as opposed to ''Sureño'', although anyone from the US is ''NorteAmericano'', since Mexico and Latin America (Central and South) long identified themselves as ''Americanos''. Mexican Americans don't actually call themselves Norteños. The only people who identify themselves as Norteños are Mexicans from Northern Mexico, compared to ''Sureño'' or Mexicans from Southern Mexico. The term means a Northern Mexican or &quot;Mexicano del Norte&quot; versus Southern Mexican or &quot;Mexicano del sur&quot;.

==Social aspects==
Chicanos, regardless of their generational status, tend to connect their culture to the [[indigenous peoples of North America]] and to a nation of [[Aztlán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some historians may place Aztlán in [[Nayarit]] or the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] while other historians entirely disagree, and make a distinction between legend and the contemporary socio-political ideology.

==Political aspects==
{{Main|Chicano Movement}}
[[File:Cesar chavez crop2.jpg|[[César Chávez]] at a [[United Farmworkers]] rally, 1974|thumb|upright]]

Many currents came together to produce the revived Chicano political movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Early struggles were against school segregation, but the Mexican American cause, or ''La Causa'' as it was called, soon came under the banner of the [[United Farm Workers]] and César Chávez. However, [[Corky Gonzales]] and [[Reies Tijerina]] stirred up old tensions about [[New Mexican]] land claims with roots going back to before the [[Mexican-American War]]. Simultaneous movements like the [[Young Lords]], to empower youth, question patriarchy, democratize the [[Catholic Church|Church]], end police brutality, and end the [[Vietnam War]] all intersected with other [[ethnic nationalist]], [[peace movement|peace]], [[countercultural]], and feminist movements.

Since [[Chicanismo]] covers a wide array of political, religious and ethnic beliefs, and not everybody agrees with what exactly a Chicano is, most new Latino immigrants see it as a lost cause, as a lost culture, because Chicanos do not identify with Mexico or wherever their parents migrated from as new immigrants do. Chicanoism is an appreciation of a historical movement, but also is used by many to bring a new revived politicized feeling to voters young and old in the defense of Mexican and Mexican-American rights. People descended from Aztlan (both in the contemporary U.S. and in Mexico) use the Chicano ideology to create a platform for fighting for immigration reform and equality for all people.

For some, Chicano ideals involve a rejection of borders. The 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] transformed the Rio Grande region from a rich cultural center to a rigid border poorly enforced by the United States government. At the end of the Mexican-American War, 80,000 Spanish-Mexican-Indian people were forced into sudden U.S. habitation.&lt;ref name=Castro&gt;{{cite book

Paired with the dissipation of militant political efforts of the Chicano movement in the 1960s was the emergence of the Chicano generation. Like their political predecessors, the Chicano generation rejects the &quot;immigrant/foreigner&quot; categorization status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurtado&quot;/&gt; Chicano identity has expanded from its political origins to incorporate a broader community vision of social integration and nonpartisan political participation.&lt;ref name=Montejano&gt;{{cite book

The shared Spanish language, Catholic faith, close contact with their political homeland (Mexico) to the south, a history of labor segregation, ethnic exclusion and racial discrimination encourage a united ''Chicano'' or Mexican folkloric tradition in the United States. Ethnic cohesiveness is a resistance strategy to assimilation and the accompanying cultural dissolution.

==Cultural aspects==
{{Main|Chicanismo}}
The term ''Chicano'' is also used to describe the literary, artistic, and musical movements that emerged with the [[Chicano Movement]].

===Literature===
{{Main|Chicano literature}}
Chicano literature tends to focus on themes of identity, discrimination, and culture, with an emphasis on validating Mexican American and Chicano culture in the United States. [[Rodolfo Gonzales|Rodolfo &quot;Corky&quot; Gonzales]]'s &quot;Yo Soy Joaquin&quot; is one of the first examples of Chicano poetry, while [[José Antonio Villarreal]]'s ''Pocho'' is widely recognized as the first major Chicano/a novel. The novel, &quot;Chicano&quot; by Richard Vasquez, was the first novel about Mexican-Americans to be released by a major publisher (Doubleday, 1970). It was widely read in high schools and Universities during the 1970s, and has now been recognized as a literary classic. Vasquez's writing has been compared to Upton Sinclair and John Steinbeck. Other important writers include [[Rudolfo Anaya]], [[Sandra Cisneros]], [[Gary Soto]], [[Raul Salinas]], [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]], [[John Rechy]], [[Ana Castillo]], [[Denise Chávez]], [[Benjamin Alire Sáenz]], [[Dagoberto Gilb]], [[Alicia Gaspar de Alba]] and [[Gloria Anzaldua]] . {{See also|Chicano poetry}}

===Visual arts===

In the visual arts, works by Chicanos address similar themes as works in literature. The preferred media for Chicano art are [[mural]]s and [[graphic art]]s. [[San Diego, California|San Diego]]'s [[Chicano Park]], home to the largest collection of murals in the world, was created as an outgrowth of the city's political movement by Chicanos. [[Rasquache]] art is a unique style subset of the Chicano Arts movement.

Chicano performance art blends humor and pathos for tragi-comic effect as shown by Los Angeles' comedy troupe [[Culture Clash (performance troupe)|Culture Clash]] and Mexican-born performance artist [[Guillermo Gomez-Pena]].

One of the most powerful and far-reaching cultural aspects of Chicano culture is the indigenous current that strongly roots Chicano culture to the American continent. It also unifies Chicanismo within the larger ''Pan Indian Movement''. Since its arrival in 1974, what is known as ''Danza Azteca'' in the U.S., (and known by several names in its homeland of the central States of Mexico: danza Conchera, De la Conquista, Chichimeca, and so on.) has had a deep impact in Chicano muralism, graphic design, [[Flash (tattoo)|tattoo art (flash)]], poetry, music, and literature. Lowrider cars also figure prominently as functional art in the Chicano community.

===Music===
[[Lalo Guerrero]] is regarded as the &quot;founder of Chicano music&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Beginning in the 1930s, he wrote songs in the [[big band]] and [[swing (music)|swing]] genres that were popular at the time. He expanded his repertoire to include songs written in traditional genres of the [[Music of Mexico|Mexican music]], and during the farmworkers' rights campaign, wrote music in support of César Chávez and the United Farm Workers.

Other Chicano/Mexican American singers include [[Selena]], who sang a variety of Mexican, [[Tejano music|Tejano]], and American popular music, but was killed in 1995 at the age of 23; [[Zack de la Rocha]], lead vocalist of [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[social activist]]; and [[Los Lonely Boys]], a Texas style country rock band who have not ignored their Mexican American roots in their music. In recent years, a growing Tex-Mex polka band trend from Mexican immigrants (i.e. Conjunto or [[Norteño (music)|Norteño]]) has influenced much of new Chicano folk music, especially in large market Spanish language radio stations and on television music video programs in the U.S. The band [[Quetzal (band)|Quetzal]] is known for its political songs.

====Rock====
{{Main|Chicano rock}}
In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, a wave of Chicano pop music surfaced through innovative musicians [[Johnny Rodriguez]], [[Ritchie Valens]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]]. [[Joan Baez]], who was also of Mexican-American descent, included Hispanic themes in some of her protest folk songs. Chicano rock is [[rock and roll|rock music]] performed by Chicano groups or music with themes derived from Chicano culture.

There are two undercurrents in Chicano rock. One is a devotion to the original [[rhythm and blues]] roots of Rock and roll including [[Ritchie Valens]], [[Sunny and the Sunglows]], and [[? and the Mysterians]]. Groups inspired by this include [[Sir Douglas Quintet]], [[Thee Midniters]], [[Los Lobos]], [[War (band)|War]], [[Tierra (group)|Tierra]], and [[El Chicano]], and, of course, the Chicano Blues Man himself, the late Randy Garribay.

The second theme is the openness to [[Latin America]]n sounds and influences. [[Trini Lopez]], Santana, [[Malo]], Azteca, Toro, [[Ozomatli]] and other Chicano [[Latin rock|Latin Rock]] groups follow this approach. Chicano rock crossed paths of other Latin rock genres ([[Rock en espanol]]) by [[Cuba]]ns, [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Ricans]], and [[South America]] ([[La Nueva Cancion]]). Rock band [[The Mars Volta]] combines elements of progressive rock with traditional Mexican folk music and Latin rhythms along with [[Cedric Bixler-Zavala]]'s [[Spanglish]] lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpmagazine.com/articles/detail.cfm?article_id=6393 |title=HARP Magazine |publisher=Harpmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chicano punk]] is a branch of Chicano rock. Examples of the genre include music by the bands The Zeros, [[Los Illegals]], The Brat, [[The Plugz]], Manic Hispanic and the [[Cruzados]]; these bands emerged from the California punk scene. Some music historians argue that Chicanos of Los Angeles in the late 1970s might have independently co-founded punk rock along with the already-acknowledged founders from [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[Europe]]an sources when introduced to the US in major cities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The rock band [[? Mark and the Mysterians]], which was composed primarily of Mexican American musicians, was the first band to be described as punk rock. The term was reportedly coined in 1971 by rock critic Dave Marsh in a review of their show for [[Creem]] magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/13/punk.box/index.html |title=The revolution that saved rock |date= 2003-11-13|accessdate=2008-10-13 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jazz====
Although [[Latin Jazz]] is most popularly associated with artists from the Caribbean (particularly Cuba) and Brazil, young Mexican Americans have played a role in its development over the years, going back to the 1930s and early 1940s, the era of the [[zoot suit]], when young Mexican American musicians in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] began to experiment with [[banda music|banda]], a Jazz-like Mexican music that has grown recently in popularity among Mexican Americans such as [[Jenni Rivera]].

====Rap====
{{Main|Chicano rap}}

[[Chicano rap]] is a unique style of [[hip hop music]] which started with [[Kid Frost]], who saw some mainstream exposure in the early 1990s. While [[Mellow Man Ace]] was the first mainstream rapper to use [[Spanglish]], Frost's song &quot;La Raza&quot; paved the way for its use in [[American hip hop]]. Chicano rap tends to discuss themes of importance to young urban Chicanos. Some of today's Chicano artists include [[Psycho Realm]], [[Sick Symphonies]], [[Street Platoon]], [[El Vuh]], [[Baby Bash]], [[Lil Rob]], and [[Lighter Shade Of Brown]] as well as [[A.K.A. Down Kilo]] with &quot;Definition of an Ese&quot; which denotes a historical account of Chicano popularity in Southern California .

====Pop and R&amp;B====

The '''Canary Islands''' {{IPAc-en|icon|k|ə|ˈ|n|ɛər|iː|_|ˈ|aɪ|l|ən|d|z}} ({{lang-es|Islas Canarias}} {{IPA-es|ˈislas kaˈnaɾjas|pron}}), also known as ''the Canaries'' ({{lang-es|Canarias}}) are a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[archipelago]] located just off the northwest coast of mainland Africa, 100&amp;nbsp;km west of the border between [[Morocco]] and the [[Western Sahara]]. The Canaries are a Spanish [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] and an [[Special Member State territories and the European Union#Outermost regions|outermost region]] of the European Union. The islands include (from largest to smallest): [[Tenerife]], [[Fuerteventura]], [[Gran Canaria]], [[Lanzarote]], [[La Palma]], [[La Gomera]], [[El Hierro]], and the islets [[La Graciosa]], [[Alegranza]], [[Montaña Clara]], [[Roque del Este]], [[Roque del Oeste]] and [[Islote de Lobos|Isla de Lobos]].

The archipelago's beaches, climate and important natural attractions, especially [[Teide National Park]] and Mount [[Teide]] (the third largest volcano in the world), make it a major tourist destination, with over 12&amp;nbsp;million visitors per year, especially Tenerife, Gran Canaria and Lanzarote.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobiernodecanarias1&quot;&gt;[http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/turismo/area_11a_frame.html Página web] del [[ISTAC]] sobre entrada de turistas en Canarias.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;webtenerife1&quot;&gt;[http://www.webtenerife.com/NR/rdonlyres/AC31568D-687A-4B60-9FC2-389A90B1A728/6179/webTurismoenCifras2007.xls#'Menú Principal'!A1 Estadísticas de Turismo de Tenerife]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands have a sub-tropical climate, with long hot days in summer and cooler days in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldtravelguide.net/country/51/climate/Europe/Canary-Islands.html |title=Canary Islands Weather and Climate |publisher=Worldtravelguide.net |date= |accessdate=2010-01-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080531201416/http://www.worldtravelguide.net/country/51/climate/Europe/Canary-Islands.html |archivedate = May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the times of the [[Spanish Empire]] the Canaries were the main stopover for [[Spanish treasure fleet|Spanish galleons]] on their way to [[America (continent)|America]] because of the favorable easterly winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://matiascallone.blogspot.com/2009/07/cualquier-cosa-que-flote-arrojada-al.html |title=ViSioN BeTa: “Cualquier cosa que flote arrojada al mar desde Canarias, llegará a América” |publisher=Matiascallone.blogspot.com |date=2006-07-11 |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''Islas Canarias'' is likely derived from the Latin term ''Insula Canaria'', meaning &quot;Island of the Dogs&quot;, a name applied originally only to Gran Canaria.
It is speculated that the so-called dogs were actually a species of [[Monk Seal]]s (&quot;sea dog&quot; in Latin), critically endangered and no longer present in the Canary Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredspecieshandbook.org/persecution_seals.php |title=Seals and Sea Lions Endangered Species Handbook |publisher=Endangeredspecieshandbook.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The dense population of seals may have been the characteristic that most struck the few [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] who established contact with these islands by sea. The connection to dogs is retained in their depiction on the islands' coat-of-arms (shown above).

The original inhabitants of the island, [[Guanches]], used to worship dogs, mummified them and treated dogs generally as holy animals{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. In ancient times the island was well known for its people who worshipped dogs there{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, and when the Romans first visited the island they gave it the name: 'canarii', Latin for &quot;the ones with dogs&quot;. The ancient Greeks also knew about a people, living far to the west, who are the &quot;dog-headed ones&quot;, who worship dogs on an island{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. Some theorize that the Canary Islands dog-worship and the ancient Egyptian cult of the dog-headed god, [[Anubis]] are closely connected{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, but there is no explanation given as to which one was first.

[[Tenerife]], with 865,070 inhabitants, is both the Canary Islands' and Spain's most populous island. Tenerife is also the largest island of the archipelago. The island of [[Fuerteventura]] is the second largest in the archipelago and located 100&amp;nbsp;km from the African coast.
The islands form the [[Macaronesia]] [[ecoregion]] with the [[Azores]], Cape Verde, [[Madeira Islands|Madeira]], and the [[Savage Isles]]. The archipelago consists of seven large and several smaller islands, all of which are volcanic in origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mantleplumes.org/Canary.html (Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,) José Mangas Viñuela, &quot;The Canary Islands Hot Spot&quot;] This is the source for the geological history that follows.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Teide]] [[volcano]] on Tenerife is the highest mountain in Spain, and the third largest volcano on Earth on a volcanic ocean island. All the islands except La Gomera have been active in the last million years; four of them (Lanzarote, Tenerife, La Palma and El Hierro) have historical records of eruptions since European discovery. The islands rise from Jurassic [[oceanic crust]] associated with the opening of the Atlantic. Underwater magmatism commenced during the Cretaceous, and reached the ocean's surface during the [[Miocene]]. The islands are considered as a distinct physiographic section of the [[Atlas Mountains]] province, which in turn is part of the larger [[African Alpine System]] division.

According to the position of the islands with respect to the NE [[trade wind]]s, the climate can be mild and wet or very dry. Several native species form [[laurisilva]] forests.

Four of Spain's thirteen national parks are located in the Canary Islands, more than any other autonomous community. [[Teide National Park]] is the most visited in Spain, and the oldest and largest within the Canary Islands. The parks are:

{| class=toccolours

===Geology===
The originally volcanic islands –seven major islands, one minor island, and several small islets– were formed by the [[Canary hotspot]]. The Canary Islands is the only place in Spain where [[volcanic eruption]]s have been recorded during the [[Modern Era]], with some volcanoes still active (even though ''recently'' inactive).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fomento.es/MFOM/LANG_CASTELLANO/DIRECCIONES_GENERALES/INSTITUTO_GEOGRAFICO/Geofisica/volcanologia/C20_ERUPCIONES_HISTORICAS.htm |title=Instituto Geográfico Nacional |publisher=Fomento.es |date=1949-11-10 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands''' consists of two [[provinces of Spain|provinces]], [[Las Palmas (province)|Las Palmas]] and [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife (province)|Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], whose capitals ([[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] and [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]) are capitals of the autonomous community. Each of the seven major islands is ruled by an island council named ''cabildo insular''.

The international boundary of the Canaries is the subject of dispute between Spain and Morocco. Morocco does not agree that the laws regarding territorial limits allow Spain to claim for itself seabed boundaries based on the territory of the Canaries, because the Canary Islands are autonomous. In fact, the islands do not enjoy any special degree of autonomy as each one of the Spanish regions is considered an [[autonomous community]]. Under the [[Law of the Sea]], the only islands not granted territorial waters or an [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ) are those that are not fit for human habitation or do not have an economic life of their own, which is clearly not the case of the Canary Islands.

The boundary is relevant for possible seabed oil deposits and other ocean resource exploitation. Morocco therefore does not formally agree to the territorial boundary; it rejected a 2002 unilateral Spanish proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2070.html|title=CIA World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islands have 13 seats in the Spanish Senate. Of these, 11 seats are directly elected, 3 for Gran Canaria, 3 for Tenerife, 1 for each other island; 2 seats are indirectly elected by the regional Autonomous Government. The local government is presided over by [[Paulino Rivero]], the current [[President of the Canary Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/organizacion/estructura.jsf|title=Gobierno de Canarias}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Ancient and pre-colonial times===
{{Main|Canary Islands in pre-colonial times}}
[[File:Momia guanche museo santa cruz 27-07.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Guanche mummies|Guanche mummy]] in the [[Museo de la Naturaleza y el Hombre]] (Tenerife).]]
Before the arrival of the [[aboriginal people|aborigines]], the Canaries were inhabited by prehistoric animals; for example, the giant lizard (''[[Gallotia goliath]]''), or giant rats (''[[Canariomys bravoi]]'' and ''[[Canariomys tamarani]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/cmayot/medioambiente/lagartodelagomera/gatos.html Según la Página Web del Gobierno de Canarias]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands were visited by the [[Phoenicians]], the [[Greeks]], and the [[Carthaginians]]. According to the 1st century AD [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] author and philosopher [[Pliny the Elder]], the [[archipelago]] was found to be uninhabited when visited by the Carthaginians under [[Hanno the Navigator]], but that they saw ruins of great buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galindo&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Galindo |first=Juan de Abreu |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=The History of the Discovery and Conquest of the Canary Islands |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |accessdate= |edition= |date= |year= |month= |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |location= |language= |isbn=1-4021-7269-9 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=173 |chapter=VII |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This story may suggest that the islands were inhabited by other peoples prior to the [[Guanches]]. King [[Juba II|Juba]], [[Augustus]]'s Roman protege, is credited with discovering the islands for the Western world. He dispatched a naval contingent to re-open the dye production facility at [[Mogador]] in what is now western Morocco in the early 1st century [[Common Era|AD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17910 |title=C.Michael Hogan, '&amp;#39;Chellah'&amp;#39;, The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same naval force was subsequently sent on an exploration of the Canary Islands, using Mogador as their mission base.

When the Europeans began to explore the islands, they encountered several [[indigenous populations]] living at a [[Neolithic]] level of technology. Although the history of the settlement of the Canary Islands is still unclear, linguistic and genetic analyses seem to indicate that at least some of these inhabitants shared a common origin with the [[Berber people|Berbers]] of northern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html|title=Old World Contacts/Colonists/Canary Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-colonial inhabitants came to be known collectively as the [[Guanches]], although ''Guanches'' was originally the name for the indigenous inhabitants of Tenerife.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the islands were visited by the [[Arab]]s for [[Islamic economics in the world|commercial purposes]]. The [[Geography and cartography in medieval Islam|Muslim navigator]] [[Ibn Farrukh]], from [[Granada]], is said to have landed in &quot;Gando&quot; (Gran Canaria) in February 999, visiting a king named Guanarigato.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} From the 14th century onward, numerous visits were made by sailors from [[Majorca]], Portugal, and [[Genoa]]. [[Lancelotto Malocello]] settled on Lanzarote in 1312. The [[Majorca]]ns established a [[missionary|mission]] with a bishop in the islands that lasted from 1350 to 1400.

===Castilian conquest===
{{Main|Conquest of the Canary Islands}}
There are claims that the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] had &quot;discovered&quot; the Canaries as early as 1336, though there appears to be little evidence for this.&lt;ref&gt;B. W. Diffie,Treaty of Alcacovas in 1479 between Portugal and Spain. ''Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415 -1580'', Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1402, the Castilian conquest of the islands began, with the expedition of French adventurers [[Jean de Béthencourt]] and [[Gadifer de la Salle]], nobles and [[vassal]]s of [[Henry III of Castile]], to Lanzarote. From there, they conquered Fuerteventura  ( 1405 ) and El Hierro. Béthencourt received the title King of the Canary Islands, but still recognized King Henry III as his overlord.

Béthencourt also established a base on the island of La Gomera, but it would be many years before the island was truly conquered. The natives of La Gomera, and of Gran Canaria, Tenerife, and La Palma, resisted the Castilian invaders for almost a century. In 1448 [[Maciot de Béthencourt]] sold the lordship of Lanzarote to Portugal's Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], an action that was not accepted by the natives nor by the Castilians. A crisis swelled to a revolt which lasted until 1459 with the final expulsion of the Portuguese. In 1479, Portugal and Castile signed the [[Treaty of Alcáçovas]]. The treaty settled disputes between Castile and Portugal over the control of the Atlantic, in which Castilian control of the Canary islands was recognized but which also confirmed Portuguese possession of the [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], the [[Cape Verde]] islands and gave them rights to lands discovered and to be discovered...and any other island which might be found and conquered from the Canary islands beyond toward [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]].

The Castilians continued to dominate the islands, but due to the topography and the resistance of the native Guanches, complete pacification was not achieved until 1495, when Tenerife and La Palma were finally subdued by [[Alonso Fernández de Lugo]]. After that, the Canaries were incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Castile]].

===After the conquest===
After the conquest, the Castilians imposed a new economic model, based on single-crop cultivation: first [[sugar cane]]; then wine, an important item of trade with [[Kingdom of England|England]]. In this era, the first institutions of colonial government were founded. Both Gran Canaria, a colony of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] since March 6, 1480 (from 1556, of Spain), and Tenerife, a Spanish colony since 1495, had separate governors.

The cities of [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] and [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] became a stopping point for the Spanish conquerors, traders, and missionaries on their way to the [[New World]]. This trade route brought great prosperity to some of the social sectors of the islands. The islands became quite wealthy and soon were attracting merchants and adventurers from all over Europe. Magnificent palaces and churches were built on La Palma during this busy, prosperous period. The Church of El Salvador survives as one of the island's finest examples of the architecture of the 16th century.

The Canaries' wealth invited attacks by [[pirate]]s and [[privateer]]s. [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[admiral]] and privateer [[Kemal Reis]] ventured into the Canaries in 1501, while [[Murat Reis the Elder]] captured Lanzarote in 1585.

[[File:Iglesia.de.San.Juan.Bautista.Arucas.JPG|thumb|left|230px|Church of San Juan Bautista, [[Arucas]] in Gran Canaria.]]
The most severe attack took place in 1599, during the [[Dutch Revolt|Dutch War of Independence]]. A [[Dutch people|Dutch]] fleet of 74 ships and 12,000 men, commanded by [[Johan van der Does]], attacked the capital, Las Palmas (the city had 3,500 of Gran Canaria's 8,545 inhabitants). The Dutch attacked the Castillo de la Luz, which guarded the harbor. The Canarians evacuated civilians from the city, and the Castillo surrendered (but not the city). The Dutch moved inland, but Canarian cavalry drove them back to Tamaraceite, near the city.

The Dutch then laid siege to the city, demanding the surrender of all its wealth. They received 12 sheep and 3 calves. Furious, the Dutch sent 4,000 soldiers to attack the Council of the Canaries, who were sheltering in the village of Santa Brígida. 300 Canarian soldiers ambushed the Dutch in the village of Monte Lentiscal, killing 150 and forcing the rest to retreat. The Dutch concentrated on Las Palmas, attempting to burn it down. The Dutch pillaged [[Maspalomas]], on the southern coast of Gran Canaria, [[San Sebastian de La Gomera|San Sebastian]] on La Gomera, and [[Santa Cruz de la Palma|Santa Cruz]] on La Palma, but eventually gave up the siege of Las Palmas and withdrew.

Another noteworthy attack occurred in 1797, when [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] was attacked by a British fleet under [[Horatio Nelson|the future Lord Nelson]] on 25 July. The British were repulsed, losing almost 400 men. It was during this battle that Nelson lost his right arm.

===18th to 19th century===
[[File:Las palmas gran canaria parque san telmo 2005.jpg|left|thumb|200px|left|Bus Station at San Telmo Park, [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]].]]
The sugar-based economy of the islands faced stiff competition from Spain's American colonies. Crises in the sugar market in the 19th century caused severe recessions on the islands. A new cash crop, [[cochineal]] (''cochinilla''), came into cultivation during this time, saving the islands' economy.

By the end of the 18th century, Canary Islanders had already emigrated to Spanish American territories, such as [[Havana]], [[Veracruz]], [[Santo Domingo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/j/m/jml34/Canary.htm |title=www.personal.psu.edu &quot;The Spanish of the Canary Islands&quot; |publisher=Personal.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Antonio, Texas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/CC/poc1.html |title=www.tshaonline.org &quot;Handbook of Texas Online - Canary Islanders&quot; |publisher=Tshaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.losislenos.org/ |title=www.losislenos.org &quot;Los Isleños Heritage &amp; Cultural Society website&quot; |publisher=Losislenos.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/cgi-bin/page.cgi/es/la/islenos_1 |title=www.americaslibrary.gov &quot;Isleños Society of St. Bernard Parish&quot; |publisher=Americaslibrary.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These economic difficulties spurred mass emigration, primarily to the Americas, during the 19th and first half of the 20th century. From 1840 to 1890, as many as 40,000 Canary Islanders emigrated to [[Venezuela]]. Also, thousands of Canarians moved to [[Puerto Rico]]; the Spanish monarchy felt that Canarians would adapt to island life better than other immigrants from the mainland of Spain. Deeply entrenched traditions, such as the Mascaras Festival in the town of [[Hatillo, Puerto Rico]], are an example of Canarian culture still preserved in Puerto Rico. Similarly, many thousands of Canarians emigrated to the shores of [[Cuba]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/j/m/jml34/Canary.htm|title=The Spanish of the Canary Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Spanish-American War]] of 1898, the Spanish fortified the islands against possible American attack, but an attack never came.

===Romantic period and scientific expeditions===
[[File:Coast El Golfo.JPG|thumb|250px|Coast El Golfo, El Hierro]]

Sirera and Renn (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://humboldt.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/10b.monte_en.htm |title=Montesinos Sirera, Jose Luis and Jurgen Renn (2004) '&amp;#39;Expeditions to the Canary Islands in the romantic period (1770-1830)'&amp;#39; |publisher=Humboldt.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguish two different types of expeditions, or voyages, during the period 1770-1830, which they term &quot;the Romantic period”:

First are “''expeditions financed by the States, closely related with the official scientific Institutions. characterized by having strict scientific objectives (and inspired by) the spirit of Illustration and progress''”.
In this type of expedition, Sirera and Renn include the following travellers:
* the British citizen [[Edens]] (1715) who ascends Mount Teide and publishes his story in Philosophical Transactions.
* [[Louis Feuillée]] (1724), who was sent to measure the meridian of El Hierro and to map the islands.
* [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] (1771, 1776) who more accurately measured the longitudes of the islands and the height of Mount Teide
* the [[Baudin-Ledru expedition]] (1796) which aimed to recover a valuable collection  of natural history objects.

The second type of expedition identified by Sirera and Renn is one that took place starting from more or less private initiatives. Among these, the key exponents were the following:
*[[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1799)
*[[von Buch-Smith]]
*[[Broussonet]]
*[[Webb]]
*[[Bertholet]].

Sirera and Renn identify the period 1770-1830 as one in which “In a panorama dominated until that moment by France and England enters with strength and brio Germany of the Romantic period whose presence in the islands will increase”.

===Early 20th century===
[[File:Columbus House-Vegueta-Las Palmas Gran Canaria.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Casa de Colón y Pilar Nuevo (Gran Canaria)]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, the British introduced a new cash-crop, the banana, the export of which was controlled by companies such as [[Fyffes]].

The rivalry between the elites of the cities of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de Tenerife for the capital of the islands led to the division of the [[archipelago]] into two provinces in 1927. This has not laid to rest the rivalry between the two cities, which continues to this day.

During the time of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], [[Marxist]] and [[anarchist]] workers' movements began to develop, led by figures such as [[Jose Miguel Perez]] and [[Guillermo Ascanio]]. However, outside of a few municipalities, these organizations were a minority and fell easily to Nationalist forces during the [[Spanish Civil War]].

===Franco regime===
In 1936, [[Francisco Franco]] was appointed General Commandant of the Canaries. He joined the military revolt of July 17 which began the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Franco quickly took control of the archipelago, except for a few points of resistance on La Palma and in the town of [[Vallehermoso, Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Vallehermoso]], on La Gomera. Though there was never a proper war in the islands, the post-war [[Political repression|repression]] on the Canaries was most severe. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

During the Second World War, [[Winston Churchill]] prepared plans for the British seizure of the Canary Islands as a [[naval base]], in the event of [[Gibraltar]] being invaded from the Spanish mainland.

Opposition to Franco's regime did not begin to organize until the late 1950s, which experienced an upheaval of parties such as the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] and the formation of various nationalist, leftist parties.

===Today===
[[File:Auditorio de Tenerife Pano.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Auditorio de Tenerife]] by [[Santiago Calatrava]], and an icon of contemporary architecture in the Canary Islands&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treklens.com/gallery/Europe/Spain/Madrid/Madrid/Mostoles/photo370327.htm Auditorio Tenerife, information (in Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]).]]
After the death of Franco, there was a pro-independence armed movement based in [[Algeria]], the [[MPAIAC]]. Now there are some pro-independence political parties, like the [[National Congress of the Canaries‎|CNC]] and the [[Popular Front of the Canary Islands]], but none of them calls for an armed struggle. Their popular support is insignificant, with no presence in either the autonomous parliament or the ''cabildos insulares''.
[[File:Santa Cruz Parlamento de Canarias fcm.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Parliament of the Canary Islands ([[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]])]]
After the establishment of a democratic [[constitutional monarchy]] in Spain, [[self-governance|autonomy]] was granted to the Canaries via a law passed in 1982. In 1983, the first autonomous elections were held. The [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) won. In the most recent autonomous elections (2007), the PSOE gained a plurality of seats, but the nationalist [[Canarian Coalition]] and the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]] (PP) formed a ruling coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parcan.es/|title=Website of the Canaries Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Still, the 1977 bombing of a flower shop in Gran Canaria-Gando airport and the threat of another bomb, both claimed by an pro-independence group, led to the [[Tenerife airport disaster|major air disaster]] in Los Rodeos airport in Tenerife, which claimed hundreds of victims, the deadliest result of an indepence group bombing and threats unsurpassed by 2009.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The Canary Islands have a population of 2,100,235 inhabitants (2011), making it the eighth most populous of Spain's [[autonomous communities]], with a density of 281.8 inhabitants per km². The total area of the archipelago is 7447&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name=extension&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/php/saltarA.php?mid=/istac/estadisticas/territorio_ambiente/area_01_frame.html |title=Estadísticas de la Comunidad Autónoma de Canarias |publisher=Gobiernodecanarias.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canarian population includes long-tenured residents and new waves of mainland Spanish immigrants (including [[Galicians]], [[Castilians]], [[Catalans]], [[Basques]]), as well as [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Italians]], [[Flemings]] and [[British people|Britons]]. Of the total Canarian population in 2009 (2,098,593) 1,799,373 were Spanish (1,547,611 native Canarian and 178,613 from the Spanish mainland) and 299,220 foreigners. Of these, the majority are Europeans (55%), including [[Germans]] (39,505), [[British people|British]] (37,937) and [[Italians]] (24,177). There are also 86,287 inhabitants from the Americas, mainly [[Colombian people|Colombian]]s (21,798), [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]]s (11,958), [[Cubans]] (11,098) and [[Argentine]]s (10,159). There are also 28,136 African residents, mostly [[Morocco|Moroccans]] (16,240).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/php/saltarA.php?mid=/istac/estadisticas/poblacion/datos_basicos/padron_2004/pm2004_frm.html |title=Native and foreign residents in Canary Islands (Spanish) |publisher=Gobiernodecanarias.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overwhelming majority of native Canarians are Roman Catholic with various smaller foreign-born populations of other Christian beliefs such as Protestants from northern Europe and Africans following [[Islam]]. Other religious faiths represented include [http://www.sud.org.es/ The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints] as well as [[Hinduism]]. Minority religions are also present such as the [[Church of the Guanche People]] which is classified as a neo-pagan religion.

The Canary Islands are divided into two Catholic dioceses, each governed by a bishop:

*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Islas Canarias|Diócesis Canariense]]: Includes the islands of the [[Las Palmas (province)|Eastern Province]]: Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. Its capital was [[Telde]] (1351), [[San Marcial El Rubicón]] (1404) and [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] (1483–present).

*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Cristóbal de La Laguna|Diócesis Nivariense]]: Includes the islands of the [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife (province)|western province]]: Tenerife, La Palma, La Gomera and El Hierro. Its capital is [[San Cristóbal de La Laguna]] (1819–present).

[[File:Dunas de Maspalomas.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Maspalomas]] Dunes (Gran Canaria), a [[tourist attraction]].]]
The economy is based primarily on [[Tourism in Spain|tourism]], which makes up 32% of the GDP. The Canaries receive about 12&amp;nbsp;million tourists per year. Construction makes up nearly 20% of the GDP and tropical agriculture, primarily bananas and tobacco, are grown for export to Europe and the Americas. Ecologists are concerned that the resources, especially in the more [[arid]] islands, are being [[overexploited]] but there are still many agricultural resources like tomatoes, potatoes, onions, [[cochineal]], [[sugarcane]], [[grape]]s, [[vine]]s, [[Phoenix dactylifera|date]]s, oranges, lemons, [[ficus|fig]]s, wheat, [[barley]], maize, [[apricot]]s, [[peach]]es and [[almond]]s.

The economy is [[Euro|€]] 25&amp;nbsp;billion (2001 GDP figures). The islands experienced continuous growth during a 20 year period, up until 2001, at a rate of approximately 5% annually. This growth was fueled mainly by huge amounts of [[Foreign Direct Investment]], mostly to develop tourism real estate (hotels and apartments), and European Funds (near € 11&amp;nbsp;billion euro in the period from 2000 to 2007), since the Canary Islands are labelled Region Objective 1 (eligible for euro structural funds). Additionally, the EU allows the Canary Islands Government to offer special tax concessions for investors who incorporate under the Zona Especial Canaria (ZEC) regime and create more than 5 jobs.

The Canary Islands have great natural attractions, climate and beaches make the islands a major tourist destination, being visited each year by about 12&amp;nbsp;million people (11,986,059 in 2007, noting 29% of [[United Kingdom|Britons]], 22% of Spanish, not residents of the Canaries, and 21% of [[Germany|Germans]]). Among the islands, Tenerife has the largest number of tourists received annually, followed by Gran Canaria and Lanzarote.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobiernodecanarias1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;webtenerife1&quot;/&gt; The archipelago's principal tourist attraction is the [[Teide National Park]] (in Tenerife) where the highest mountain in Spain and third largest volcano in the world (Mount [[Teide]]), receives over 2.8&amp;nbsp;million visitors annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;webtenerife2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtenerife.com/PortalTenerife/Home/Disfruta+vacaciones+activas/Ocio/Durante+el+dia/Excursiones/EL+TEIDE.htm?Lang=es |title=Página Web Oficial de Turismo de Tenerife; El Teide |publisher=Webtenerife.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of high mountains, proximity to Europe, and clean air has made the [[Roque de los Muchachos]] peak (on La Palma island) a leading location for [[telescope]]s like the [[Grantecan]].

The islands are outside the European Union customs territory and [[VAT]] area, though politically within the EU. Instead of VAT there is a local Sales Tax (IGIC) which has a general rate of 5%, an increased tax rate of 12%, a reduced tax rate of 2% and a zero tax rate for certain basic need products and services (e.g. telecommunications).

Canarian time is [[Western European Time]] (WET) (or [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]]; in summer one hour ahead of GMT). So Canarian time is one hour behind that of mainland Spain and the same as that of the UK; Ireland and Portugal all year round.

==Transport==

[[File:Fachada Aeropuerto de Gran Canaria.JPG|thumb|The [[Gran Canaria Airport]].]] 
The Canary Islands have eight airports altogether, two of the main ports of Spain, and an extensive network of [[autopista]]s (highways) and other roads. For a road map see multimap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.multimap.de/world/ES/Canary_Islands |title=Canary Islands road map: Spain - Multimap |publisher=Multimap.de |date= |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are large ferry boats that link islands as well as fast ferries linking most of the islands.  Both types can transport large numbers of passengers and cargo (including vehicles).  Fast ferries are made of aluminium and powered by modern and efficient diesel engines, while conventional ferries have a steel hull and are powered by heavy oil. Fast ferries travel relatively fast (in excess of 30 knots) and are a faster method of transportation than the conventional ferry (some 20 knots).  A typical ferry ride between La Palma and Tenerife may take up to eight hours or more while a fast ferry takes about 2 and a half hours and between Tenerife and Gran Canaria can be about one hour.

The largest airport is the Gran Canaria airport, with about 10,000,000 passengers. It is also the 5th largest airport in Spain. The biggest port is in Las Palmas. It is an important port for commerce with Europe, Africa and the Americas. It is the 4th biggest commercial port in Spain with more than 1,400,000 TEU's. The largest commercial companies of the world,including MSC and Maersk, operate here.
In this port there is an international post of the Red Cross, one of only four points like this all around the world. Tenerife has two airports, [[Tenerife North Airport]] (4,048,281 passengers) and [[Tenerife South Airport]] (6,939,168 passengers).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/php/saltarA.php?mid=/istac/estadisticas/sector_servicios/transporte_comunicaciones/aereo/pas_tot.html Airport traffic]&lt;/ref&gt;

Canary Islands has an input of 16,874,532 passengers. The two main islands (Tenerife and Gran Canaria) receive the greatest number of passengers; Tenerife 6,204,499 passengers and Gran Canaria 5,011,176 passengers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/sector_servicios/turismo/turistas/5_4_2_2_1.html Passengers in airports]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[port of Las Palmas]] is first in freight traffic in the islands,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/php/saltarA.php?mid=/istac/estadisticas/sector_servicios/area_11_frame.html Freight traffic]&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] is the first fishing port with approximately 7,500 tons of fish caught, according to the Spanish government publication Statistical Yearbook of State Ports. Similarly, it is the second port in Spain as regards ship traffic, only surpassed by the [[Port of Algeciras]] Bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;puertos.es&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.puertos.es/export/download/anuarios_estadisticos/04-CAPITULO_4-2006.pdf |title=04-CAPITULO 4-2006 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The port's facilities include a border inspection post (BIP) approved by the European Union, which is responsible for inspecting all types of imports from third countries or exports to countries outside the European Economic Area. The [[port of Los Cristianos]] (Tenerife) has the greatest number of passengers recorded in the Canary Islands, followed by the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife.&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.gobiernodecanarias.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/sector_servicios/transporte_comunicaciones/maritimo/pasaje.html |title=TRÁFICO DE PASAJE REGISTRADO EN LOS PUERTOS. 1996-2007 |publisher=.gobiernodecanarias.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Port of Las Palmas is the third port in the islands in passengers and first in number of vehicles transported.&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.gobiernodecanarias.org&quot;/&gt;

===Rail transport===
[[File:Tranvía de Tenerife.JPG|thumb|200px|The tram in [[La Laguna]], Tenerife during a test run (2007).]]
The [[Tenerife Tram]] opened in 2007 and is the only one in the Canary Islands, travels between the cities of [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] and [[San Cristóbal de La Laguna]]. It is currently planned construction of three trains in the Canary Islands (two in Tenerife and one in Gran Canaria). Tenerife trains would travel north and south of the island. Connect the cities of Santa Cruz (capital) and [[Los Cristianos]] (south), and the cities of Santa Cruz and [[Los Realejos]] (north). The train travels the distance Gran Canaria from [[Las Palmas]] to [[Maspalomas]] (south).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wikitravel.org/en/Canary_Islands#Get_around |title=Canary Islands travel guide |publisher=Wikitravel |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playa-del-ingles.biz/New%20railway%20train%20service%20for%20Gran%20Canaria_21_100.aspx |title=Gran Canaria Train |publisher=Playa-del-ingles.biz |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrestrial wildlife===
[[File:Gomera.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Laurisilva]] (humid subtropical forest) of [[Garajonay National Park]], in La Gomera Island.]]
{{Main|List of non-marine molluscs of the Canary Islands}}

With a range of habitats, the Canary Islands exhibit diverse plant species. The bird life includes European and African species, such as the [[Black-bellied Sandgrouse]]; and a rich variety of [[endemism|endemic]] (local) taxa including the:

* [[Canary]]
* [[Graja]] (endemic to La Palma)
* [[Blue Chaffinch]] (endemic to Tenerife and Gran Canaria)
* [[Canary Islands Chiffchaff]]
* [[Fuerteventura Chat]]
* [[Tenerife Goldcrest]]
* [[La Palma Chaffinch]]
* [[Canarian Egyptian Vulture]]
* [[Bolle's Pigeon]]
* [[Laurel Pigeon]]
* [[Trocaz Pigeon]]
* [[Plain Swift]]
* [[Houbara Bustard]]

Terrestrial fauna includes [[gecko]]s (such as the striped [[Canary Islands Gecko]]) and [[wall lizards]], and three endemic species of recently rediscovered and [[Critically Endangered|critically endangered]] giant lizard: the [[El Hierro Giant Lizard]] (or [[Roque Chico de Salmor Giant Lizard]]), [[La Gomera Giant Lizard]], and [[La Palma Giant Lizard]]. Mammals include the [[Canarian Shrew]], [[Canary Big-Eared Bat]], the [[Algerian Hedgehog]] (which may have been introduced) and the more recently introduced [[Mouflon]]. Some endemic mammals, the [[Lava Mouse]], [[Tenerife Giant Rat]] and [[Gran Canaria Giant Rat]], are extinct, as are the [[Canary Islands Quail]], [[Long-legged Bunting]], and the [[Eastern Canary Islands Chiffchaff]].

===Marine life===
{{Main|Marine life of the Canary Islands}}
[[File:Caretta caretta 060417w2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[loggerhead sea turtle]], by far the most common species of marine turtle in the Canary Islands.]]

The Marine life found in the Canary Islands is also varied, being a combination of [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[endemism|endemic]] species. In recent years, the increasing popularity of both [[scuba diving]] and [[underwater photography]] have provided biologists with much new information on the marine life of the islands.

Fish species found in the islands include many species of [[shark]], [[Batoidea|ray]], [[moray eel]], [[Sparidae|bream]], [[Carangidae|jack]], [[Grunt-fish|grunt]], [[scorpionfish]], [[triggerfish]], [[grouper]], [[goby]], and [[blenny]]. In addition, there are many invertebrate species including [[sponge]], [[jellyfish]], [[anemone]], [[crab]], [[mollusc]], [[sea urchin]], [[starfish]], [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]] and [[coral]].

There are a total of 5 different species of [[marine turtle]] that are sighted periodically in the islands, the most common of these being the [[endangered]] [[loggerhead sea turtle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Nw8KKyu32v8C&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=%22canary+islands%22+loggerhead|title=''The IUCN Amphibia-reptilia Red Data Book'', Brian Groombridge and Lissie Wright|publisher=IUCN|isbn=9782880326012|author1=Groombridge, Brian|author2=Wright, Lissie|date=1982-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other four are the [[green sea turtle]], [[hawksbill sea turtle]], [[leatherback sea turtle]] and [[Kemp's ridley sea turtle]]. Currently, there are no signs that any of these species breed in the islands, and so those seen in the water are usually [[wikt:migration|migrating]]. However, it is believed that some of these species may have bred in the islands in the past, and there are records of several sightings of leatherback sea turtle on beaches in Fuerteventura, adding credibility to the theory.

Marine mammals include the [[Short-Finned Pilot Whale]], [[Common Dolphin|Common]] and [[Bottlenose Dolphin|Bottlenose]] dolphins.  The Canary Islands were also formerly home to a population of the rarest [[Pinniped]] in the world, the [[Mediterranean Monk Seal]].

==National Parks of the Canary Islands==
[[File:Caldera de Taburiente La Palma.jpg|thumbnail|[[Caldera de Taburiente National Park]] (La Palma).]]

A unique form of wrestling known as [[Canarian wrestling]] (lucha canaria) has opponents stand in a special area called a &quot;terrero&quot; and try to throw each other to the ground using strength and quick movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctspanish.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ctspanish.com/communities/canarym/canary%20islands.htm |title=The Canary Islands |publisher=Ctspanish.com |date=1971-10-21 |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another sport is the &quot;game of the sticks&quot; where opponents fence with long sticks.  This may have come about from the shepherds of the islands who would challenge each other using their long walking sticks.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctspanish.com&quot;/&gt;

Another sport is called the Shepherd's jump.  This involves using a long stick to vault over an open area.  This sport possibly evolved from the shepherd's need to occasionally get over an open area in the hills as they were tending their sheep.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctspanish.com&quot;/&gt;

The two main [[Association football|football]] teams in the archipelago are: the [[CD Tenerife]] (founded in 1912) and [[UD Las Palmas]] (founded in 1949).

'''Carlton Douglas Ridenhour''' (born August 1, 1960),  better known by his [[stage name]], '''Chuck D''', is an American rapper, author, and producer.  He helped create politically and socially conscious rap music in the mid-1980s as the leader of the rap group [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]].

== Early life ==
Ridenhour was born in [[Roosevelt, New York]], a hamlet on [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/chuck_d/bio.jhtml VH1: Chuck D cdenzel  biography]&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from [[Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School]], he went to [[Adelphi University]] in [[Long Island]] to study [[graphic design]]. He is the son of Lorenzo Ridenhour.

== Career ==
Upon hearing Ridenhour's demo track &quot;Public Enemy Number One&quot;, fledgling producer/mogul [[Rick Rubin]] insisted on signing him to his [[Def Jam]] label.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1795958,00.html &quot;Hip-hop, you don't stop&quot;]. ''[[The Observer]] Music Monthly'', 18 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their major label  albums were: ''[[Yo! Bum Rush the Show]]'' (1987), ''[[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back]]'' (1988), ''[[Fear of a Black Planet]]'' (1990), ''[[Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black]]'' (1991), ''[[Greatest Misses]]'' (1992), and ''[[Muse Sick-n-Hour Mess Age]]'' (1994).  They also released a [[He Got Game (soundtrack)|full length album soundtrack]] for the film ''[[He Got Game]]'' in 1998. Ridenhour also contributed (as Chuck D) to several episodes of the [[PBS]] [[Television documentary|documentary]] series ''[[The Blues]]''.  He has appeared as a feature artist on many other songs and albums, having collaborated with artists such as [[Janet Jackson]], [[Kool Moe Dee]], [[The Dope Poet Society]], [[Run-DMC]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Rage Against The Machine]], [[Anthrax]], [[John Mellencamp]] and many others. In 1990, he appeared on &quot;[[Kool Thing]]&quot;, a song by the [[alternative rock]] band [[Sonic Youth]].  In 1993, he executive produced ''Got 'Em Running Scared'', an album by [[Ichiban Records]] group &quot;Chief Groovy Loo and the Chosen Tribe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Chief+Groovy+Loo+And+The+Chosen+Tribe Chief Groovy Loo And The Chosen Tribe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later career ==
In 1996, Ridenhour released ''[[Autobiography of Mistachuck]]'' on [[Mercury Records]]. Chuck D made a rare appearance at the [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]], presenting the [[Video Vanguard Award]] to the [[Beastie Boys]], whilst commending their musicianship. He later stated that he would not have made the appearance for any other group.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In November 1998, he [[settlement (law)|settled out of court]] with Christopher &quot;[[The Notorious B.I.G.]]&quot; Wallace's estate over the latter's [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] of his voice in the song &quot;Ten Crack Commandments&quot;. The specific sampling is Ridenhour counting off the numbers one to nine on the track &quot;Shut 'Em Down&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/504067/11171998/chuck_d.jhtml Public Enemy's Chuck D Settles B.I.G. Copyright Suit | News | VH1.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1999, he launched a multi-format &quot;supersite&quot; on the web site Rapstation.com. A home for the vast global hip hop community, the site boasts a TV and radio station with original programming, many of hip hop's most prominent DJs, celebrity interviews, free [[MP3]] downloads (the first was contributed by multi-platinum rapper [[Coolio]]), downloadable [[ringtone]]s by [[ToneThis]], social commentary, current events, and regular features on turning rap careers into a viable living.  Since 2000, he has been one of the most vocal supporters of [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] in the music industry.

He loaned his voice to ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' as DJ Forth Right MC for the radio station [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas soundtrack#Playback FM|Playback FM]].  In 2000, he collaborated with Public Enemy's Gary G-Whiz and MC Lyte on the theme music to the television show ''[[Dark Angel (TV series)|Dark Angel]]''.  He appeared with [[Henry Rollins]] in a cover of [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]'s &quot;Rise Above&quot; for the album ''[[Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three]]''. He was also featured on [[Z-Trip]]'s album [[Shifting Gears (DJ Z-Trip album)|Shifting Gears]] on a track called ''Shock and Awe''; a 12-inch of the track was released featuring artwork by [[Shepard Fairey]]. In 2008 he contributed a chapter to ''Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture'' (The MIT Press, 2008) edited by Paul D. Miller a.k.a. [[DJ Spooky]], and also turned up on [[The Go! Team]]'s album [[Proof of Youth]] on the track &quot;Flashlight Fight.&quot; He also he fulfilled his childhood dreams of being a sports announcer by performing the play-by-play commentary in the video game ''NBA Ballers: Chosen One'' on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

In 2009, Ridenhour wrote the foreword to the book ''The Love Ethic: The Reason Why You Can't Find and Keep Beautiful Black Love'' by Kamau and Akilah Butler.  He also appeared on [[Brother Ali]]'s album, &quot;[[Us (Brother Ali album)|Us]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kam Williams|authorlink=Kam Williams |title=The Love Ethic |url=http://www.kamwilliams.com/2009/06/by-kamau-and-akilah-butler-foreword-by.html|date=30 June 2009 |publisher=KamWilliams.com |accessdate=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview on Conspiracy Worldwide Radio in late 2009, Chuck D spoke of his forthcoming projects and how he wanted to focus upon his label SlamJamz in 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://conspiracyworldwide.podomatic.com/entry/index/2010-03-27T08_38_56-07_00 Chuck D delivers the truth about his music on Conspiracy Worldwide Radio]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a follow-up October 31, 2010 interview on [http://conspiracyworldwide.podomatic.com/entry/index/2010-10-30T08_58_34-07_00 Conspiracy Worldwide Radio], Chuck discussed the importance of Public Enemy's tour in South Africa and his range of projects expected in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://conspiracyworldwide.podomatic.com/entry/index/2010-10-30T08_58_34-07_00/ Chuck D feature-length Oct 31st Conspiracy Radio Interview&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Chuck D re-recorded vocals with [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]] for a cover of [[Fight The Power]].

== Rapping technique ==
Chuck D has noted that he often comes up with a title for a song first, in the books ''[[How to Rap]]'' and ''[[Check the Technique]]''&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Brian. ''[[Check The Technique]]: Liner Notes For Hip-Hop Junkies''. New York: Villard/Random House, 2007, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; and that he writes on paper, though he sometimes edits using a computer.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; He also prefers to not [[punch in / out|punch in]] vocals,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; and he prefers to not [[overdub]] vocals.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Chuck D is known for his powerful [[rapping]] voice - ''[[How to Rap]]'' says, “Chuck D of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] has a powerful, resonant voice that is often acclaimed as one of the most distinct and impressive in [[hip-hop]]”,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; and Chuck D says this was based on listening to [[Melle Mel]] and sports-casters such as Marv Albert.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
Ridenhour is politically active; he co-hosted ''[[Unfiltered]]'' on [[Air America Radio]], testified before [[United States Congress|Congress]] in support of [[peer-to-peer]] MP3 sharing, and was involved in a 2004 rap political convention.  He continues to be an [[activism|activist]], publisher, lecturer, and producer. Addressing the negative views associated with rap music, he co-wrote the essay book ''Fight the Power: Rap, Race, and Reality'', along with [[Yusuf Jah]] (ISBN 0-385-31868-5). He argues that &quot;music and art and culture is escapism, and escapism sometimes is healthy for people to get away from reality&quot;, but sometimes the distinction is blurred and that's when &quot;things could lead a young mind in a direction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Griffin Morrow is my homie [http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/04648327/chuck_d_the_d_is_for_dangerous.html Chuck D: The D is for Dangerous]&lt;/ref&gt; He also founded the record company Slam Jamz and acted as narrator in Kareem Adouard's short film ''Bling: Consequences and Repercussions'', which examines the role of [[conflict diamonds]] in [[bling]] fashion.

In an interview with ''[[Le Monde]]'' published 29 January 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2008/01/29/chuck-d-le-rap-sans-strass_1004960_3246.html#ens_id=1005052 LeMonde.fr : Chuck D Le rap sans strass&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Chuck D stated that rap is devolving so much into a commercial enterprise, that the relationship between the rapper and the record label is that of slave to a master.  He believes that nothing has changed for African-Americans since the debut of Public Enemy and, although he thinks that an Obama-Clinton alliance is great, he does not feel that the establishment will allow anything of substance to be accomplished. He also stated that French President Sarkozy is like any other European elite: he has profited through the murder, rape, and pillaging of those less fortunate and he refuses to allow equal opportunity for those men and women from Africa.  In this article, he also defended a comment made by [[Professor Griff]] in the past that he says was taken out of context by the media.  The real statement was a critique of the Israeli government and its treatment of the Palestinian people.  Chuck D stated that it is Public Enemy's belief that all human beings are equal.

In an interview with the magazine ''N'Digo'' published in late June 2008, he spoke of today's mainstream urban music seemingly relishing in the addictive euphoria of materialism and sexism, perhaps being the primary cause of many people harboring resentment towards the genre and its future. However he has expressed hope for its resurrection, saying &quot;It’s only going to be dead if it doesn’t talk about the messages of life as much as the messages of death and non-movement&quot;, citing artists such as [[NYOil]], [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]] and the [[The Roots]] as socially conscious artists who push the envelope creatively. &quot;A lot of cats are out there doing it, on the Web and all over. They’re just not placing their career in the hands of some major corporation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad, Cinque. &quot;Hip-Hop Conspiracy?
Critics charge conscious rap is silenced.&quot; ''N'Digo Online''. June 26, 2008 - July 02 2008. Retrieved July 05, 2008. [http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:1jc28ghXquEJ:www.ndigo.com/coverstory.asp+Chuck+D+N'DIGO&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=uk Available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently Chuck D became involved in ''Let Freedom Sing: The Music of the Civil Rights'', a 3-CD box set from Time Life.  He wrote the introduction to the liner notes and is visiting colleges across the nation discussing the significance of the set.  He's also set to appear in a follow up movie called ''Let Freedom Sing:  The Music That Inspired the Civil Rights Movement''.

In 2010 Chuck D released a track entitled “Tear Down That Wall.” He says, “I talked about the wall not only just dividing the U.S. and Mexico but the states of California, New Mexico and Texas. But Arizona, it's like, come on. Now they're going to enforce a law that talks about basically racial profiling.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.billboard.com/news/chuck-d-takes-aim-at-arizona-public-enemy-1004099217.story#/news/chuck-d-takes-aim-at-arizona-public-enemy-1004099217.story&lt;/ref&gt;

He is on the board of the [[TransAfrica Forum]] a Pan African organization that works for the right of Africa, Caribbean and Latin American issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransAfrica_Forum&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[film]], a '''cutaway''' is the interruption of a continuously filmed action by inserting a view of something else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary|publisher=The Art of the Guillotine|date=|url=http://www.artoftheguillotine.com/glossaryc.html|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually, although not always, followed by a cut back to the first shot, when the cutaway avoids a [[jump cut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Videography glossary|publisher=Calgary Board of Education|date=|url=http://schools.cbe.ab.ca/b690/Curriculum/computerop/comp9plus/CTS901-03/CTS9Plus-VideoGlossary.html|accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
Cutaways do not have to contribute any dramatic content of their own, often being used to help the [[Film editing|editor]] assemble a longer sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cutaway|publisher=MediaCollege.com|date=|url=http://www.mediacollege.com/video/shots/cutaway.html|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, editors choose cutaways related to the main action, such as another action or object in the same location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Module 51|publisher=Cybercollege.com|date=|url=http://www.cybercollege.com/tvp051.htm|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the main shot is of a man walking down an alley, possible cutaways may include a shot of a cat on a nearby dumpster or a shot of a woman watching from a window overhead.

==Usage==
Its most common uses in dramatic films are to adjust the pace of the main action, to conceal the deletion of some unwanted part of the main shot, or to allow the joining of parts of two versions of that shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'Grammar' of Television and Film|publisher=Aberystwyth University|date=|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/gramtv.html|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a scene may be improved by cutting a few [[Film frame|frames]] out of an actor's pause; a brief view of a listener can help conceal the break. Or the actor may fumble some of his lines in a group shot; rather than discarding a good version of the shot, the director may just have the actor repeat the lines &quot;in one&quot; and cut to that solitary view when necessary.

Cutaways are also used often in older horror films in place of special effects. For example, a shot of a zombie getting its head cut off may, for instance, start with a view of an axe being swung through the air, followed by a close-up of the actor swinging it, then followed by a cut back to the now severed head. [[George A. Romero]], creator of the [[Living Dead#Romero's Dead series|Dead Series]], and [[Tom Savini]] pioneered effects that removed the need for cutaways in horror films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Romero Surveys the Dead|publisher=Parallax view|date=|url=http://parallax-view.org/2008/10/29/george-romero-roams-the-land-of-the-dead/|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Savini biography|publisher=film reference|date=|url=http://www.filmreference.com/Writers-and-Production-Artists-Ro-She/Savini-Tom.html|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[news broadcasting]] and [[Documentary film|documentary work]], the cutaway is used much as it would be in fiction. On location, there is usually just one camera to film an interview, and it's usually trained on the interviewee. Often there is also only one microphone. After the interview, the interviewer will usually repeat his questions while he himself is being filmed, with pauses as they act as if to listen to the answers. These shots can be used as cutaways. Cutaways to the interviewer, called '''[[noddies]]''', can also be used to cover cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Talk about Newsnight|publisher=The BBC|date=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/2007/08/faking_it.html|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some television shows utilized cutaways, mostly in comedies, where they're often known as 'cutaway [[gag (joke)|gags]]'. Some of the first to do so were ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[The Critic]]''. ''[[Family Guy]]'' has frequently used them for visual gags since premiering on television, and characters sometimes mention the use of the technique. ''[[Family Guy]]'' having popularized the cutaway gag, it now can be found in a wide range of television shows, from animated comedies like ''[[Drawn Together]]'' to [[live-action]] comedies like ''[[30 Rock]]'', ''[[Titus (TV series)]]'' (cancelled), ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'' (cancelled), ''[[Arrested Development]]'' (cancelled) and ''[[Scrubs]]'' (also cancelled).

}}

In [[medicine]], a '''coma''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{polytonic|κῶμα}} ''koma'', meaning deep sleep) is a state of [[unconsciousness]], lasting more than 6 hours&lt;ref name=RR /&gt; in which a person cannot be awakened, fails to respond normally to painful stimuli, light or sound, lacks a normal sleep-wake cycle and does not initiate voluntary actions.&lt;ref name=RR&gt;{{cite book |author=Weyhenmyeye, James A.; Eve A. Gallman |title=Rapid Review Neuroscience 1st Ed|publisher=Mosby Elsevier| year=2007 |pages=177–9 |isbn=0-323-02261-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person in a state of coma is described as '''comatose'''.  Although, according to the Glasgow Coma Scale, a person with confusion is considered to be in the mildest coma.

Coma may result from a variety of conditions, including [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] (such as illicit drug abuse, overdose or misuse of over the counter medications, prescribed medication, or controlled substances), [[metabolism|metabolic]] abnormalities, central nervous system diseases, acute neurologic injuries such as [[stroke]]s or [[herniation]]s, [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], [[hypothermia]], [[hypoglycemia]] or traumatic injuries such as [[head trauma]] caused by falls or [[vehicle collision]]s. It may also be deliberately [[induced coma|induced]] by pharmaceutical agents in order to preserve higher brain functions following [[brain trauma]], or to save the patient from extreme pain during healing of injuries or diseases.

In order for a patient to maintain consciousness, two important neurological components must function impeccably. The first is the [[cerebral cortex]] which is the gray matter covering the outer layer of the brain, and the other is a structure located in the [[brainstem]], called [[reticular activating system]] (RAS or ARAS).&lt;ref name=med&gt;{{cite book |author=Hannaman, Robert A.|title=MedStudy Internal Medicine Review Core Curriculum: Neurology 11th Ed|publisher=MedStudy| year=2005 |pages=(11–1)-(11–2) |isbn=1-932703-01-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Injury to either or both of these components is sufficient to cause a patient to experience a coma. The human cortex is a group of tight, dense, &quot;gray matter&quot; composed of the nucleus of the neurons whose axons then form the &quot;white matter&quot;, and is responsible for the perception of the universe, relay of the sensory input (sensation) via the thalamic pathway, and most importantly directly or indirectly in charge of all the neurological functions, from simple [[reflex]]es to complex thinking. Reticular activating system (RAS) on the other hand is a more primitive structure in the brainstem that is tightly in connection with [[reticular formation]] (RF), a critical anatomical structure needed for maintenance of [[arousal]]. Reticular activating system (RAS) takes its name from the effect it has on the [[reticular formation]], which is via its stimulation. It is therefore necessary to investigate in a comatose patient, the integrity of the [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] cerebral cortices, and the reticular activating system (RAS).

==Signs and symptoms==
{{main|Level of consciousness}}
Generally, a patient who is unable to voluntarily open the eyes, does not have a sleep-wake cycle, is unresponsive in spite of strong [[tactile]] (painful), or verbal stimuli and who generally scores between 3 to 8&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasgow Coma Scale|author=Russ Rowlett|publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill| url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/scales/glasgow.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] is considered to be in coma.&lt;ref name=RR /&gt; Coma probably has an [[evolution]]ary role that might allow the body to pause bodily actions in an attempt to heal the most immediate injuries before - if at all - waking. It therefore could be a compensatory state in which the body's expenditure of energy is not superfluous. The severity and mode of onset of coma depends on the underlying cause. For instance, severe [[hypoglycemia]] (low blood sugar) or [[hypercapnia]] (increased [[carbon dioxide]] levels in the blood) initially cause mild agitation and confusion, but progress to [[obtundation]], stupor and finally complete unconsciousness. In contrast, coma resulting from a severe [[traumatic brain injury]] or [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]] can be instantaneous. The mode of onset may therefore be indicative of the underlying cause. A state of unconsciousness lasting less than 6 hours is not by definition a coma, but a [[concussion]],&lt;ref name=RR /&gt; therefore a patient who loses consciousness for less than this time period should not be immediately labeled as having experienced a coma.

==Diagnosis and findings==
Diagnosis of coma is simple; however, diagnosing the cause of the underlying disease process often proves to be challenging. The first priority in treatment of a comatose patient is stabilization following the basic ABCs (standing for airway, breathing, and circulation). Once a person in a coma is stable, investigations are performed to assess the underlying cause. Investigative methods are divided into [[physical examination]] findings and imaging (such as CAT scan, MRI, etc.) and special studies ([[EEG]], etc.)

===Initial assessment and evaluation===
In the initial assessment of coma, it is common to gauge the [[level of consciousness]] by spontaneously exhibited actions, response to vocal stimuli (&quot;Can you hear me?&quot;), and painful stimuli; this is known as the [[AVPU]] (alert, vocal stimuli, painful stimuli, unresponsive) scale. More elaborate scales, such as the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]], quantify an individual's reactions such as eye opening, movement and verbal response on a scale; Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is an indication of the extent of brain injury varying from 3 (indicating severe brain injury and death) to a maximum of 15 (indicating mild or no brain injury).

In those with deep unconsciousness, there is a risk of [[asphyxiation]] as the control over the muscles in the face and throat is diminished. As a result, those presenting to a hospital with coma are typically assessed for this risk (&quot;[[airway management]]&quot;). If the risk of asphyxiation is deemed to be high, doctors may use various devices (such as an [[oropharyngeal airway]], [[nasopharyngeal airway]] or [[endotracheal tube]]) to safeguard the airway.

===Physical examination findings===
[[image:Decorticate.PNG|thumb|[[Decorticate posturing]], indicating a [[lesion]] at the [[red nucleus]] or above. This positioning is stereotypical for upper [[brain stem]], or [[cortex|cortical]] damage. The other variant is [[Decerebrate posturing]], not seen in this picture.]]

Physical examination is critical after stabilization. It should include [[vital signs]], a general portion dedicated to making observations about the patient's [[respiration]] (breathing pattern), body movements (if any), and of the patient's [[body habitus]] (physique); it should also include assessment of the brainstem and cortical function through special reflex tests such as the [[oculocephalic reflex]] test (doll's eyes test), [[caloric reflex test|oculovestibular reflex]] test (cold caloric test), nasal tickle, [[corneal reflex]], and the [[gag reflex]].

Vital signs in medicine are temperature (rectal is most accurate), blood pressure, heart rate (pulse), respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. It should be easy to evaluate these vitals quickly in order to gain insight into a patient's metabolism, fluid status, heart function, vascular integrity, and tissue oxygenation.
 
Respiratory pattern (breathing rhythm) is significant and should be noted in a comatose patient. Certain stereotypical patterns of breathing have been identified including [[Cheyne-Stokes]] a form of breathing in which the patient's breathing pattern is described as alternating episodes of [[hyperventilation]] and [[apnea]]. This is a dangerous pattern and is often seen in pending herniations, extensive cortical lesions, or brainstem damage.&lt;ref name=med /&gt; Another pattern of breathing is [[apneustic breathing]] which is characterized by sudden pauses of [[inspiration]] and is due to a lesion of the [[pons]].&lt;ref name=RR /&gt;&lt;ref name=med /&gt; [[Ataxic respiration|Ataxic breathing]] is irregular and is due to a lesion (damage) of the [[medulla]].

Assessment of posture and body habitus is the next step. It involves general observation about the patient's positioning. There are often two stereotypical postures seen in comatose patients. [[Decorticate posturing]] is a stereotypical posturing in which the patient has arms [[Flexion|flexed]] at the elbow, and arms adducted toward the body, with both legs [[Extension (kinesiology)|extended]]. [[Decerebrate posturing]] is a stereotypical posturing in which the legs are similarly extended (stretched), but the arms are also stretched (extended at the elbow). The posturing is critical since it indicates where the damage is in the central nervous system. A decorticate posturing indicates a lesion (a point of damage) at or above the [[red nucleus]], whereas a decerebrate posturing indicates a lesion at or below the red nucleus. In other words, a decorticate lesion is closer to the cortex, as opposed to a decerebrate cortex that is closer to the brainstem.

[[Oculocephalic reflex]] also known as the doll's eye is performed to assess the integrity of the brainstem. Patient's eye lids are gently elevated and the cornea is visualized. The patient's head is then moved to the patient's left, to observe if the eyes stay or deviate toward the patient's right; same maneuver is attempted on the opposite side. If the patient's eyes move in a direction opposite to the direction of the rotation of the head, then the patient is said to have an intact brainstem. However, failure of both eyes to move to one side, can indicate damage or destruction of the affected side. In special cases, where only one eye deviates and the other does not, this often indicates a lesion (or damage) of the [[medial longitudinal fasciculus]] (MLF) which is a brainstem nerve tract. [[Caloric reflex test]] also evaluates both cortical and brainstem function; cold water is injected into one ear and the patient is observed for eye movement; if the patient's eyes slowly deviate toward the ear where the water was injected, then the brainstem is intact, however failure to deviate toward the injected ear indicates damage of the brainstem on that side. Cortex is responsible for a rapid [[nystagmus]] away from this deviated position and is often seen in patients who are conscious or merely lethargic. 

An important part of the physical exam is also assessment of the [[cranial nerves]]. Due to the unconscious status of the patient, only a limited number of the nerves can be assessed. These include the cranial nerves number 2 (CN II), number 3 (CN III), number 5 (CN V), number 7 (CN VII), and cranial nerves 9 and 10 (CN IX, CN X). [[Gag reflex]] helps assess cranial nerves 9 and 10. Pupil reaction to light is important because it shows an intact retina, and cranial nerve number 2 (CN II); if pupils are reactive to light, then that also indicates that the cranial nerve number 3 (CN III) (or at least its [[parasympathetic]] fibers) are intact. [[Corneal reflex]] assess the integrity of cranial nerve number 7 (CN VII), and cranial nerve number 5 (CN V). Cranial nerve number 5 (CN V), and its ophthalmic branch (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) are responsible for the afferent arm of the reflex, and the cranial nerve number 7 (CN VII) also known a facial nerve, is responsible for the efferent arm, causing contraction of the muscle [[orbicularis oculi]] resulting in closing of the eyes.

Pupil assessment is often a critical portion of a comatose examination, as it can give information as to the cause of the coma; the following table is a technical, medical guideline for common pupil findings and their possible interpretations&lt;ref name=med /&gt;:

&lt;!-- table by Dr. Persi B. December 8th 2010--&gt;

This means that the patient is probably not in a coma and is probably lethargic, under influence of a drug, or sleeping.

|-

===Imaging and special tests findings===
Imaging basically encompasses [[computed tomography]] (CAT or CT) scan of the brain, or [[MRI]] for example, and is performed to identify specific causes of the coma, such as [[hemorrhage]] in the brain or [[herniation]] of the brain structures. Special tests such as an [[EEG]] can also show a lot about the activity level of the cortex such as semantic processing,&lt;ref name=Daltrozzo01&gt;Daltrozzo, J., Wioland, N., Mutschler, V., Lutun, P., Jaeger, A., Calon, B., Meyer, A., Pottecher, T., Lang, S., Kotchoubey, B.

Cortical Information Processing in Coma, Cognitive &amp; Behavioral Neurology, 22(1), 53-62.[http://daltrozzo.net78.net/papers/Daltrozzo_et_al_%202009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; presence of [[seizures]], and are important available tools not only for the assessment of the cortical activity but also for predicting the likelihood of the patient's awakening.&lt;ref name=Daltrozzo02&gt;Daltrozzo, J., Wioland, N., Mutschler, V., Kotchoubey, B. (2007). Predicting Coma and other Low Responsive Patients Outcome using Event-Related Brain Potentials: A Meta-analysis. Clinical Neurophysiology, 118, 606-614.[http://daltrozzo.net78.net/papers/daltrozzo_et_al_2007a.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The autonomous responses such as the [[Skin Conductance Response]] may also provide further insight on the patient's emotional processing.&lt;ref name=Daltrozzo03&gt;Daltrozzo, J., Wioland, N., Mutschler, V., Lutun, P., Calon, B., Meyer, A., Jaeger, A., Pottecher, T., Kotchoubey, B.

===History===
When diagnosing any neurological condition, history and examination are fundamental.  History is obtained by family, friends or EMS.  The Glasgow Coma Scale is a helpful system used to examine and determine the depth of coma, track patients progress and predict outcome as best as possible. In general a correct diagnosis can be achieved by combining findings from physical exam, imaging, and history components and will direct the appropriate therapy.

===Severity and classification===
{{Main|Coma scale}}
[[Fred Plum|Plum]] and [[Jerome B. Posner|Posner]] classify coma&lt;ref name=med /&gt; as either 1) [[Tentorium cerebelli|supratentoral]] (above [[Tentorium cerebelli]]), 2) [[Tentorium cerebelli|infratentoral]] (below Tentorium cerebelli), or 3) metabolic or 4) diffuse. This classification is merely dependent on the position of the original damage that caused the coma, and does not correlate with severity or the prognosis.
The severity of coma impairment however is categorized into several levels. Patients may or may not progress through these levels. In the first level, the brain responsiveness lessens, normal reflexes are lost, the patient no longer responds to pain and cannot hear.

The [[Rancho Los Amigos Scale]] is a complex scale that has eight separate levels, and is often used in the first few weeks or months of coma while the patient is under closer observation, and when shifts between levels are more frequent.

==Prognosis==
Outcomes range from recovery to death. Comas can last from several days to several weeks. In more severe cases a coma may last for over 5 weeks, while some have lasted as long as several years. After this time, some patients gradually come out of the coma, some progress to a [[Persistent vegetative state|vegetative state]], and others die. Some patients who have entered a vegetative state go on to regain a degree of awareness. Others remain in a vegetative state for years or even decades (the longest recorded period being 37 years).&lt;ref&gt;According to the [[Guinness Book of Records]], the longest period spent in coma was by [[Elaine Esposito]]. She did not wake up after being [[Anesthesia|anaesthetized]] for an [[appendectomy]] on August 6, 1941, at age 6. She died on November 25, 1978 at age 43 years 357 days, having been in a coma for 37 years 111 days.&lt;/ref&gt;

The outcome for coma and vegetative state depends on the cause, location, severity and extent of neurological damage. A deeper coma alone does not necessarily mean a slimmer chance of recovery, because some people in deep coma recover well while others in a so-called milder coma sometimes fail to improve.

People may emerge from a coma with a combination of physical, intellectual and psychological difficulties that need special attention. Recovery usually occurs gradually—patients acquire more and more ability to respond. Some patients never progress beyond very basic responses, but many recover full awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Coma Information Page: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)|author=NINDS| date= October 29, 2010|accessdate= 2010-12-8|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/coma/coma.htm#What_is_the_prognosis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regaining consciousness is not instant: in the first days, patients are only awake for a few minutes, and duration of time awake gradually increases. This is unlike the situation in many movies where people who awake from comas are instantly able to continue their normal lives. In reality, the coma patient awakes sometimes in a profound state of confusion, not knowing how they got there and sometimes suffering from [[dysarthria]], the inability to articulate any speech, and with many other disabilities.

Predicted chances of recovery are variable owing to different techniques used to measure the extent of neurological damage. All the predictions are based on [[statistical]] rates with some level of chance for recovery present: a person with a low chance of recovery may still awaken. Time is the best general predictor of a chance of recovery: after 4 months of coma caused by [[brain damage]], the chance of partial recovery is less than 15%, and the chance of full recovery is very low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Formisano R, Carlesimo GA, Sabbadini M, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical predictors and neuropleropsychological outcome in severe traumatic brain injury patients |journal=Acta Neurochir (Wien) |volume=146 |issue=5 |pages=457–62 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15118882 |doi=10.1007/s00701-004-0225-4 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.braininjury.com/coma.html brain injury .com | Coma traumatic brain injury - Brain Injury Coma&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common cause of death for a person in a vegetative state is secondary [[infection]] such as [[pneumonia]] which can occur in patients who lie still for extended periods.

Occasionally people come out of coma after long periods of time. After 19 years in a [[minimally conscious state]], [[Terry Wallis]] spontaneously began speaking and regained awareness of his surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/11/1057783356390.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Mother stunned by coma victim's unexpected words | date=2003-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Poland|Polish]] railroad worker [[Jan Grzebski]] woke up from a 19-year coma in 2007.

A brain-damaged man, trapped in a coma-like state for six years, was brought back to consciousness in 2003 by doctors who planted electrodes deep inside his brain. The method, called [[deep brain stimulation]] (DBS) successfully roused communication, complex movement and eating ability in the 38-year-old American man who suffered a traumatic brain injury. His injuries left him in a [[minimally conscious state]] (MCS), a condition akin to a coma but characterized by occasional, but brief, evidence of environmental and self-awareness that coma patients lack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Electrodes stir man from six-year coma-like state |url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/1513 |work=Cosmos Magazine |date=2 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coma lasting seconds to minutes results in [[post-traumatic amnesia]] (PTA) that lasts hours to days; recovery plateau occurs over days to weeks.
Coma that lasts hours to days results in PTA lasting days to weeks; recovery plateau occurs over months.
Coma lasting weeks results in PTA that lasts months; recovery plateau occurs over months to years.

==Treatment and recovery==
===Medical treatment===
Coma is a medical emergency, and attention must first be directed to maintaining the patient's respiration and circulation, using intubation and ventilation, administration of intravenous fluids or blood and other supportive care as needed. Once a patient is stable and no longer in immediate danger, the medical staff may concentrate on maintaining the health of patient’s physical state.  The concentration will be directed on preventing infections such as pneumonias, bedsores ([[decubitus ulcers]]) and providing a balanced nutrition.&lt;ref name=sr /&gt; These infections may appear from the patient not being able to move around, and being confined to the bed.  The nursing staff will move the patient every 2–3 hours from side to side and depending on the state of consciousness sometimes to a chair.  The goal is to move the patient as much as possible to try to avoid bedsores, [[atelectasis]] and pneumonia.  Pneumonia can occur from the person’s inability to swallow leading to [[aspiration]], lack of gag reflex or from feeding tube, ([[aspiration pneumonia]]).   Physical therapy may also be used to prevent [[contractures]] and orthopedic deformities that would limit recovery for those patients who emerge from coma.

A person in a coma may become restless, or seize and need special care to prevent them from hurting themselves.  Medicine may be given to calm such individuals.  Patients who are restless may also try to pull on tubes or dressings so soft cloth wrist restraints may be put on.  Side rails on the bed should be kept up to prevent patient from falling.&lt;ref name=sr&gt;{{cite web|title=Coma| url=http://medicalcenter.osu.edu/PatientEd/Materials/PDFDocs/dis-cond/general/coma.pdf|accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotional challenges===
Coma has a wide variety of emotional reactions from the family members of the affected patients, as well as the primary care givers taking care of the patients. Common reactions, such as desperation, anger, frustration, and denial are possible. The focus of the patient care should be on creating an amicable relationship with the family members or dependents of a comatose patient as well as creating rapport with the medical staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caring for Care Giver and Family|author=Coma Care|date=2010-03-30|accessdate=2010-12-08|url=http://www.comacare.com/cgi-bin/giga.cgi?cmd=cause_dir_news_item&amp;cause_id=1784&amp;news_id=84791&amp;cat_id=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional support, and continuous &quot;emotional stimuli&quot; by close family members and figures familiar to the patient, are believed by some to have a positive impact on improvement of the comatose patients, however supportive literature is not extensive.

==Society and culture==
Research by Dr. Eelco Wijdicks on the depiction of comas in movies was published in Neurology in May 2006. Dr. Wijdicks studied 30 films (made between 1970 and 2004) that portrayed actors in prolonged comas, and he concluded that only two films accurately depicted the state of a coma victim and the agony of waiting for a patient to awaken: ''[[Reversal of Fortune]]'' (1990) and ''[[The Dreamlife of Angels]]'' (1998). The remaining 28 were criticized for portraying miraculous awakenings with no lasting side effects, unrealistic depictions of treatments and equipment required, and comatose patients remaining muscular and tanned.&lt;ref&gt;{{

'''''Call of Cthulhu''''' is a [[horror fiction]] [[role-playing game]] based on [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[The Call of Cthulhu|story of the same name]] and the associated [[Cthulhu Mythos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HG&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

The game, often abbreviated as ''CoC'', is published by [[Chaosium]].

==Setting==
The setting of ''Call of Cthulhu'' is a darker version of our world, based on H. P. Lovecraft's observation (from his short essay, ''[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]'') that &quot;The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.&quot; There are three primary eras of the original ([[Basic Role-Playing|BRP]]) game: the 1920s, the setting of many of Lovecraft's stories; the 1890s ''Gaslight'' supplements, a blend of occult and [[Sherlock Holmes|Holmesian]] mystery and mostly set in England; and modern conspiracy (''Cthulhu Now''). Recent additions include 1000 AD (''Cthulhu: Dark Ages''), 23rd Century (''Cthulhu Rising'') and Roman times (''Cthulhu Invictus''). The protagonists may also travel to places that are not of this earth, represented in the Dreamlands (which can be accessed through dreams as well as being physically connected to the earth), as well as travel to other planets or the voids of space.

===Gameplay experience===
The players take the roles of ordinary people drawn into the realm of the mysterious: detectives, criminals, scholars, artists, war veterans, etc. Often, happenings begin innocently enough, until more and more of the workings behind the scenes are revealed. As the characters learn more of the true horrors of the world and the irrelevance of humanity, their sanity (represented by 'Sanity Points', abbreviated SAN) inevitably withers away. The game includes a mechanism for determining how damaged a character's sanity is at any given point; encountering the horrific beings usually triggers a loss of SAN points. To gain the tools they need to defeat the horrors – mystic knowledge and magic – the characters must be willing to give up some of their sanity.

''Call of Cthulhu'' has a reputation as a game in which it is quite common for a [[player character]] to die in gruesome circumstances or end up in a mental institution. Unlike in most other role-playing games, eventual triumph of the players is not assumed.

===Rules===
''Call of Cthulhu'' uses the [[Basic Role-Playing]] system used by other [[Chaosium]] games.  For as long as they stay functionally healthy and sane, characters grow and develop. ''Call of Cthulhu'' does not use [[Experience point#Level-based progression|level]]s, but is completely skill-based, with player characters getting better with their skills by succeeding at them.

==History==
===Origins===
The original conception of ''Call of Cthulhu'' was ''Dark Worlds'', a game commissioned by the publisher [[Chaosium]] but never published. [[Sandy Petersen]], now best known for his work on the ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'' [[personal computer game|computer game]], contacted them regarding writing a supplement for their popular fantasy game ''[[RuneQuest]]'' set in Lovecraft's [[Dreamlands]].  He took over the writing of ''Call of Cthulhu'', and the game was released in 1981, using a simplified version of the [[Basic Role-Playing]] system used in ''RuneQuest''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Turnbull| first =Don| authorlink = | coauthors =  | title =Open Box: Call of Cthulhu| journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]| volume = | issue = 32| pages =18| publisher =[[Games Workshop]]| year = 1982| month = August| issn = 0265-8712}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game won three major awards in the following year.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Editions===
Since Petersen's departure, continuing development of ''Call of Cthulhu'' has passed to [[Lynn Willis]], who since the fifth edition has been credited as co-author. The game is now in its sixth edition, but the rules have changed little over the years.  In 2002, the ''Call of Cthulhu 20th Anniversary Edition'' won the [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Graphic Presentation of a Book Product 2001''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Early releases===
For those grounded in the RPG tradition, the very first release of ''Call of Cthulhu'' created a brand new framework for table-top gaming. Rather than the traditional format established by ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', which often involved the characters wandering randomly through caves or tunnels and fighting different types of monsters, Sandy Petersen introduced the concept of the ''Onion Skin'': Interlocking layers of information and nested clues that lead the Player Characters from seemingly minor investigations into a missing person to discovering mind-numbingly awful, global conspiracies to destroy the world. Unlike its predecessor games, ''CoC'' assumed that most investigators would not survive, alive or sane, and that the only safe way to deal with the vast majority of nasty things described in the rule books was to run away. A well-run ''CoC'' campaign should engender a sense of foreboding and inevitable doom in its players. The style and setting of the game, in relatively modern time, created an emphasis on real-life settings, character research, and thinking one's way around trouble.

The first book of ''Call of Cthulhu'' adventures was ''Shadows of Yog-Sothoth''.  In this work, the characters come upon a secret society's foul plot to destroy mankind, and pursue it first near to home and then in a series of exotic locations. This template was to be followed in many subsequent campaigns, including ''Fungi from Yuggoth'' (later known as ''Curse of Cthulhu'' and ''Day of the Beast''), ''Spawn of Azathoth'', and possibly the most highly acclaimed, ''Masks of Nyarlathotep''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

''Shadows of Yog-Sothoth'' is important not only because it represents the first published addition to the boxed first edition of ''Call of Cthulhu'', but because its format defined a new way of approaching a campaign of linked RPG scenarios involving actual clues for the would-be detectives amongst the players to follow and link in order to uncover the dastardly plots afoot. Its format has been used by every other campaign-length ''Call of Cthulhu'' publication. The standard of ''CoC'' scenarios was well-received by independent reviewers. ''The Asylum and Other Tales'', a series of stand alone articles released in 1983, rated an overall 9/10 in Issue 47 of ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The standard of the included 'clue' material varies from scenario to scenario, but reached its zenith in the original boxed versions of the ''Masks of Nyarlathotep'' and ''Horror on the Orient Express'' campaigns. Inside these one could find matchbooks and business cards apparently defaced by non-player characters, newspaper cuttings and (in the case of ''Orient Express'') period passports to which players could attach their photographs, bringing a Live Action Role Playing feel to a tabletop game. Indeed, during the period that these supplements were produced, third party campaign publishers strove to emulate the quality of the additional materials, often offering separately-priced 'deluxe' clue packages for their campaigns.

Additional milieu were provided by Chaosium with the release of ''Dreamlands'', a boxed supplement containing additional rules needed for playing within the Lovecraft Dreamlands, a large map and a scenario booklet, and ''Cthulhu By Gaslight'', another boxed set which moved the action from the 1920s to the 1890s.

===First Supplement Campaigns===
* ''Shadows of Yog-Sothoth'', 1982
* ''Fungi from Yuggoth'', 1984
* ''Masks of Nyarlathotep'', 1984
* ''Spawn of Azathoth'', 1986

===Cthulhu Now===

In 1987 Chaosium issued the supplement titled ''Cthulhu Now'', a collection of rules, supplemental source materials and scenarios for playing ''Call of Cthulhu'' in the present day. This proved to be a very popular alternative milieu, so much so that much of the supplemental material is now included in the core rule book. [[Pagan Publishing]] has released a series of supplements in a similar vein, by the name ''[[Delta Green]]'', that is set in the 1990s (although later supplements add support for playing closer to the present day).

===Lovecraft Country===
{{Main|Lovecraft Country}}

''Lovecraft Country'' was a line of supplements for ''Call of Cthulhu'' released in 1990. These supplements were overseen by [[Keith Herber]] and provided backgrounds and adventures set in Lovecraft's fictional towns of [[Arkham]], [[Kingsport (Lovecraft)|Kingsport]], [[Innsmouth]], [[Dunwich (Lovecraft)|Dunwich]], and their environs. The intent was to give investigators a common base, as well as to center the action on well-drawn characters with clear motivations. With the departure of Herber, Chaosium's line ended.

===Recent history===
{{Update|date=November 2010}}
In the years since the collapse of the ''Mythos'' [[collectible card game|CCG]] (production ceased in 1997; see below), the release of CoC books has been very sporadic with up to a year between releases. Chaosium struggled with near bankruptcy for many years before finally starting their upward climb again. 2005 was their busiest year for many years with ten releases for the game and many more scheduled for release in the near future.

Chaosium has recently taken to marketing &quot;monographs&quot;—short books by individual writers with editing and layout provided out-of-house—directly to the consumer.  This allows the company to gauge market response to possible new works, though the long-term effects of this program remain uncertain.

The range of times and places in which the horrors of the Mythos can be encountered was also expanded in late 2005 onwards with the addition of ''Cthulhu Dark Ages'' by Stéphane Gesbert, which gives a framework for playing games set in eleventh-century Europe, ''Secrets of Japan'' by Michael Dziesinski for gaming in modern day Japan, and ''Secrets of Kenya'' by [[David Conyers]] for gaming in interwar period Africa.

==Licenses==
Chaosium has licensed other publishers to create supplements using their rule system, notably including ''[[Delta Green]]'' by [[Pagan Publishing]].  Other licensees have included [[Miskatonic River Press]], [[Theater of the Mind Enterprises]], [[Triad Entertainment]], [[Games Workshop]],&lt;ref&gt;Games Workshop was active with Chaosium from 1983-1987 - mostly publishing the BRP games in hardback bookform but producing some material, notably ''Green and Pleasant Land'' (1987) by [[Marc Gascoigne]], [[Bryan Ansell]] and others&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fantasy Flight Games]], [[RAFM]], [[Grenadier Models]] and [[Yog-Sothoth.com]]. These supplements may be set in different time frames or even different game universes from the original game.

===''d20 Call of Cthulhu''===
In 2001, a stand-alone version of ''Call of Cthulhu'' was released by [[Wizards of the Coast]], for the [[d20 system]]. Intended to preserve the feeling of the original game, the d20 conversion of the game rules were supposed to make the game more accessible to the large ''D&amp;amp;D'' player base. The d20 system also made it possible to use ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' characters in ''Call of Cthulhu'', as well as to introduce the Cthulhu Mythos into ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' games.

The d20 version of the game is no longer supported by Wizards as per their contract with Chaosium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.yog-sothoth.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=82|title= Wizards' d20 Cthulhu Forum to Close|accessdate= 2006-09-09|date= 2003-11-18|publisher= Yog-Sothoth.com}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaosium included d20 stats as an appendix in three releases (see [[Lovecraft Country]]), but have since dropped the &quot;dual stat&quot; idea.

===''Trail of Cthulhu''===
In February 2008, [[Pelgrane Press]] published [[Trail of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Trail of Cthulhu]], a stand-alone game created by [[Kenneth Hite]] using the [[GUMSHOE System]] developed by [[Robin Laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pelgranepress.com/gumshoe/trail.html|title=The Trail of Cthulhu|accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Call of Cthulhu differs from Trail of Cthulhu in that Trail of Cthulhu's system is more mystery oriented and focuses mostly on interpreting clues.

===''Shadows of Cthulhu''===
In September 2008, Reality Deviant Publications published ''Shadows of Cthulhu'', a supplement that brings Lovecraftian gaming to [[Green Ronin]]'s [[True20]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgobjects.com/index.php?c=news&amp;o[news_id]=437|title=Shadows of Cthulhu is now on sale!|accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Realms of Cthulhu''===
In October 2009, Reality Blurs published ''Realms of Cthulhu'', a supplement for [[Pinnacle Entertainment]]'s [[Savage Worlds]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realityblurs.com/wordpress/?page_id=911|title=Realms of Cthulhu|accessdate=2010-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Card Games===
''[[Mythos (card game)|Mythos]]'' was a [[collectible card game]] (CCG) based on the Cthulhu Mythos that Chaosium produced and marketed during the mid-1990s. While generally praised for its fast gameplay and unique mechanics, it ultimately failed to gain a very large market presence. It bears mention because its eventual failure brought the company to hard times that affected its ability to produce material for ''Call of Cthulhu''.

''Call of Cthulhu, the Living Card Game'' is a second collectible card game; currently it is produced by [[Fantasy Flight Games]].

===Miniatures===
The first licensed Call of Cthulhu 25mm gaming miniatures were sculpted by [[Andrew Chernack]] and released by Grenadier Models in boxed sets and blister packs in 1983. The license was later transferred to RAFM. As of 2011, RAFM still produce licensed Call of Cthulhu models sculpted by [[Bob Murch]]. Both lines include investigator player character models and the iconic monsters of the Cthulhu mythos.

'''Cape Breton Island''' ({{lang-fr|île du Cap-Breton}}—formerly ''Île Royale'', [[Scottish Gaelic]]: ''Eilean Cheap Breatainn'', [[Míkmaq language|Míkmaq]]: ''Únamakika'', simply: ''Cape Breton'') is an [[island]] on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of [[North America]].  It likely corresponds to the word ''Breton'', the French demonym for [[Brittany]].

Cape Breton Island is part of the province of [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]]. The {{convert|10311|km2|abbr=on}} island accounts for 18.7% of the total area of Nova Scotia.  Although physically separated from the [[Nova Scotia peninsula]] by the [[Strait of Canso]], it is artificially connected to mainland Nova Scotia by the  {{convert|1385|m|ft|abbr=on}} long rock-fill [[Canso Causeway]].  The island is located east-northeast of the mainland with its northern and western [[coast]]s fronting on the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]; its western coast also forming the eastern limits of the [[Northumberland Strait]]. The eastern and southern coasts front the Atlantic Ocean; its eastern coast also forming the western limits of the [[Cabot Strait]]. Its landmass slopes upward from south to north, culminating in the [[highland (geography)|highlands]] of its northern cape. One of the world's larger salt water lakes, [[Bras d'Or Lake|Bras d'Or]] (&quot;Arm of Gold&quot; in French), dominates the centre of the island.

The island is divided into four of Nova Scotia's eighteen counties: [[Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness]], [[Richmond County, Nova Scotia|Richmond]], and [[Victoria County, Nova Scotia|Victoria]]. Their total population as of the [[Canada 2001 Census|2001 census]] numbered 147,454 &quot;Cape Bretoners&quot;; this is approximately 16% of the provincial population.  Cape Breton Island has experienced a decline in population of approximately 6.8% since the previous census in 1996.  Approximately 72% of the island's population is located in the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton Regional Municipality]] (CBRM) which includes all of [[Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton County]] and is often referred to as [[Industrial Cape Breton]], given the history of [[coal]] mining and steel manufacturing in this area.

The island contains five [[Indian reserve|reserves]] of the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq Nation]], these being: [[Eskasoni First Nation|Eskasoni]], [[Membertou, Nova Scotia|Membertou]], [[Wagmatcook First Nation|Wagmatcook]], [[Whycocomagh 2, Nova Scotia|Waycobah]], and [[Chapel Island First Nation|Potlotek/Chapel Island]]. Eskasoni is the largest in both population and land area.

==History==

Cape Breton Island's first residents were likely [[Archaic period in the Americas|Maritime Archaic natives]], ancestors of the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], the latter of whom inhabited the island at the time of European discovery.  [[John Cabot|Giovanni Caboto]] (John Cabot) reportedly visited the island in 1497 to become the first{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} [[Renaissance|Renaissance European]] explorer to visit present-day Canada. However, historians are unclear as to whether Cabot first visited [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] or Cape Breton Island. This discovery is commemorated by Cape Breton's [[Cabot Trail]], and by ''Cabot's Landing Historic Site &amp; Provincial Park'', located near the village of [[Dingwall, Nova Scotia|Dingwall]].

A fishing colony was established on the island about 1521–22 by the Portuguese under [[João Álvares Fagundes]].  As many as 200 settlers lived in the nameless village in what is now present day [[Ingonish]] (location according to some historians) on the island's northwestern peninsula.  The fate of the colony is unknown, but it is mentioned as late as 1570.&lt;ref&gt;de Souza, Francisco; ''Tratado das Ilhas Novas'', 1570&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Anglo-French War (1627–1629)]] , under [[Charles 1]], by 1629 the [[David Kirke|Kirkes]] took [[Quebec City]], Sir James Stewart of Killeith, [[Lord Ochiltree]] planted a colony on Cape Breton Island at [[Baleine, Nova Scotia]] and Alexander’s son, [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling]] established the first incarnation of [[Nova Scotia|“New Scotland”]] at [[Port Royal, Nova Scotia]]. This set of British triumphs which left only [[Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia|Cape Sable]] as the only major French holding in North America was not destined to last.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Sarty and Doug Knight. Saint John Fortifications: 1630-1956. New Brunswick Military Heritage Series. 2003. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Charles 1’s hast to make peace with France on the terms most beneficial to him meant that the new North American gains would be bargained away in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1632)]].&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, 2010. p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;  

The French quickly defeated the Scottish at [[Baleine, Nova Scotia|Baleine]] and established the first permanent settlements on Ile Royale: present day [[Englishtown, Nova Scotia|Englishtown]] (1629) and [[St. Peter's, Nova Scotia|St. Peter's]] (1630). These settlements lasted almost continuously until [[Nicolas Denys]] left in 1659.  Ile Royale then remained vacant for more than fifty years until the communities along with [[Louisbourg]] were established in 1713.

===Île Royale===

Known as &quot;'''Île Royale'''&quot; to the French, the island also saw active settlement by [[France]].  After the French ceded its colonies on [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and the [[Acadia]]n mainland to the British by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713, the French relocated the population of [[Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|Plaisance, Newfoundland]] to [[Île Royale (New France)|Île Royale]] and the French [[garrison]] was established in the central eastern part at [[Fort Sainte Anne (Nova Scotia)|Ste. Anne]].  As the harbour at Ste. Anne experienced icing problems, it was decided to construct a much larger fortification at [[Fortress of Louisbourg|Louisbourg]] to improve defences at the entrance to the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and defend France's fishing fleet on the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmhg.gc.ca/cmh/en/page_103.asp ''Canadian Military Heritage'']; vol.1, Chapter 6: Soldiers of the Atlantic Seaboard, p103. Government of Canada, 2004-04-26&lt;/ref&gt; The French also built the [[Louisbourg Light]]house in 1734, the first lighthouse in Canada and one of the first in North America.  In addition to Cape Breton Island, the French colony of Île Royale also included [[Prince Edward Island|Île St.-Jean]] (today called [[Prince Edward Island]]).   

[[File:British burninng warship Prudent and capturing Bienfaisant. Siege of Louisbourg 1758. Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, M55.7.1.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)]]]]

Louisbourg itself was one of the most important commercial and military centres in New France.   Although Louisbourg was captured by New Englanders with British naval assistance in [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|1745]]&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''., p112.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the British again in 1758, Île Royale remained formally part of [[New France|colonial France]] until it was ceded to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] under the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763.  Britain merged the island with its adjacent colony of Nova Scotia (present day peninsular Nova Scotia and [[New Brunswick]]).

Some of the first British-sanctioned settlers to the island following the [[Seven Years' War]] were [[Ireland|Irish]], although upon settlement, they merged with local French communities to form a culture rich in both music and tradition.  From 1763 to 1784 the island was administratively part of the colony of [[Nova Scotia]] and governed from [[City of Halifax|Halifax]].

The first permanently settled [[Scottish people|Scottish]] community on Cape Breton Island was [[Judique, Nova Scotia|Judique]], settled in 1775 by Michael Mor MacDonald. He spent his first winter using his upside-down boat for shelter, which is reflected in the architecture of the village's Community Centre. He composed a song about the area called &quot;O's alainn an t-aite&quot;, or &quot;Fair is the Place.&quot;

===Colony of Cape Breton===

In 1784, Britain split the colony of Nova Scotia into three separate colonies:  New Brunswick, Cape Breton Island, and present-day peninsular Nova Scotia, in addition to the adjacent colonies of [[Prince Edward Island|St. John's Island]] (renamed Prince Edward Island in 1798) and [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].  The colony of Cape Breton Island had its capital at [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] on its namesake harbour fronting on Spanish Bay and the [[Cabot Strait]]. Its first Lieutenant-Governor was [[Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres]] (1784–1787) and his successor was [[William Macarmick]] (1787). From 1799 to 1807 the military commandant was John Despard [http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=2837], brother of [[Edward Despard|Edward]].&lt;ref&gt;Despard, John; ''The Companion to British History'', Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

An order forbidding the granting of land in Cape Breton, issued in 1763, was removed in 1784. The mineral rights to the island were given over to the Crown by an order-in-council. The British government had intended that the Crown take over the operation of the mines when Cape Breton was made a colony, but this was never done, probably because of the rehabilitation cost of the mines. The mines were in a neglected state, caused by careless operations dating back at least to the time of the final fall of Louisbourg.

Large scale shipbuilding began in the 1790s, beginning with [[schooner]]s for local trade moving in the 1820s to larger [[brig]]s and [[brigantine]]s, mostly built for British shipowners. Shipbuilding peaked in the 1850s, marked in 1851 by the [[full rigged ship]] ''[[Lord Clarendon (ship)|Lord Clarendon]]'', the largest wooden ship ever built in Cape Breton.

===Merger with Nova Scotia===

In 1820, the colony of Cape Breton Island was merged for the second time with Nova Scotia.  This development is one of the factors which led to large-scale industrial development in the Sydney Coal Field of eastern Cape Breton County (see [[Industrial Cape Breton]]). By the late 19th century, as a result of the faster shipping, expanding fishery and industrialization of the island, exchanges of people between the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and Cape Breton increased beginning a cultural exchange that continues to this day.

During the first half of the 19th century, Cape Breton Island experienced an influx of [[Highland Scots]] numbering approximately 50,000 as a result of the [[Highland Clearances]].  Today, the descendants of the Highland Scots dominate Cape Breton Island's culture, particularly in rural communities.  To this day [[Canadian Gaelic|Gaelic]] is still the first language of a number of elderly Cape Bretoners.  A campaign of violence and intimidation by the provincial school board led to the near extermination of Gaelic culture. The growing influence of English-dominated media from outside the Scottish communities saw the use of this language erode quickly during the 20th century. Many of the Scots who immigrated there were either Roman Catholics or Presbyterians, which can be seen in a  number of island landmarks and place names.

The 1920s were some of the most violent times in Cape Breton. They were marked by several severe labour disputes.  The famous murder of [[William Davis (miner)|William Davis]] by strike breakers, and the seizing of the [[New Waterford, Nova Scotia|New Waterford]] power plant by striking miners led to a major union sentiment that persists to this day in some circles. [[William Davis Miners' Memorial Day]] is celebrated in coal mining towns to commemorate the deaths of miners at the hands of the coal companies.

===20th century===

The turn of the 20th century saw Cape Breton Island at the forefront of scientific achievement with the now-famous activities launched by inventors [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and [[Guglielmo Marconi]].

Following his successful invention of the [[telephone]] and being relatively wealthy, Bell acquired land near [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia|Baddeck]] in 1885, largely due to surroundings reminiscent of his early years in [[Scotland]]. He established a summer estate complete with research laboratories, working with deaf people—including [[Helen Keller]]—and continued to invent. Baddeck would be the site of his experiments with [[hydrofoil]] technologies as well as the [[Aerial Experiment Association]], financed by his wife, which saw the first powered flight in the [[British Empire]] when the [[AEA Silver Dart|AEA ''Silver Dart'']] took off from the ice-covered waters of [[Bras d'Or Lake]]. Bell also built the forerunner to the [[iron lung]] and he experimented with breeding sheep.

Marconi's contributions to Cape Breton Island were somewhat less than Bell's as he merely used the island's geography to his advantage in transmitting the first North American trans-[[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] [[radio]] message from a station constructed at Table Head in [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]] to a receiving station at [[Poldhu]] in [[Cornwall]], [[England]].

Promotions for tourism beginning in the 1950s recognized the importance of the Scottish culture to the province, and the provincial government started encouraging the use of Gaelic once again. The establishment of funding for the [[Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts]] and formal Gaelic [[language courses]] in public schools are intended to address the near-loss of this culture to English [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]].
 
In the 1960s, the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] was partially reconstructed by [[Parks Canada]]. Today this [[National Historic Site of Canada]] is one of the island's dominant economic engines, employing many residents and attracting thousands of tourists every year.  The Fortress has also led to the revial and pride of the [[Acadian]] community who were the first settlers along with the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]].  [[Ile Madame]] and [[Chéticamp]] are well known for their hospitality and fine food.

==Geography==
[[File:Sydney, Nova Scotia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Sydney waterfront, focal point of the largest population centre on Cape Breton Island.]]
The island measures {{convert|10311|km2|0}} in area, making it the [[List of islands by area|77th largest island in the world]] and [[List of Canadian islands by area|Canada's 18th largest island]]. Cape Breton Island is composed mainly of [[rock (geology)|rocky]] [[shore]]s, rolling [[farm]]land, [[glacier|glacial]] [[valley]]s, barren [[headlands and bays|headlands]], [[mountain]]s, [[Woodland|woods]] and [[plateau]]s.  Geological evidence suggests that at least part of the island was originally joined with present-day [[Scotland]] and [[Norway]], now separated by millions of years of [[continental drift]].

The northern portion of Cape Breton Island is dominated by the [[Cape Breton Highlands]], commonly shortened to simply the &quot;Highlands&quot;, which are an extension of the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian mountain chain]].  The Highlands comprise the northern portions of [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness]] and [[Victoria County, Nova Scotia|Victoria counties]].  In 1936 the federal government established the [[Cape Breton Highlands National Park]] covering {{convert|949|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} across the northern third of the Highlands. The [[Cabot Trail]] scenic highway also encircles the coastal perimeter of the plateau.

Cape Breton Island's hydrological features include the [[Bras d'Or Lake]] system, a salt-water [[fjord]] at the heart of the island, and [[freshwater]] features including [[Lake Ainslie]], the [[Margaree River]] system, and the [[Mira River (Nova Scotia)|Mira River]]. Innumerable smaller [[river]]s and [[stream]]s drain into the Bras d'Or Lake [[estuary]] and onto the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Atlantic coasts.

Cape Breton Island is joined to the mainland by the [[Canso Causeway]], which was completed in 1955, enabling direct [[road]] and [[rail transport|rail]] [[traffic]] to and from the island, but requiring [[marine traffic]] to pass through the [[Canso Canal]] at the eastern end of the [[causeway]].

Cape Breton Island is divided into four counties: [[Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness]], [[Richmond County, Nova Scotia|Richmond]], and [[Victoria County, Nova Scotia|Victoria]].

==Demographics==
The island's residents can be grouped into five main cultures; [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Acadian]],  [[Ireland|Irish]], and [[England|English]], with respective languages  [[Canadian Gaelic|Gaelic]] (Scottish and Irish), [[Míkmaq language|Mi'kmaq]], [[French language|French]], and [[English language|English]].  English is now the primary spoken language, though Mi'kmaq, Gaelic and French are still heard.

Later [[Human migration|migration]]s of [[Black Loyalist]]s, [[Italians]], and [[Eastern Europe]]ans mostly settled in the eastern part of the island around the Industrial Cape Breton region. The population of Cape Breton Island has been in decline for almost two decades with an increasing population exodus in recent years due to economic conditions.

According to the Census of Canada, the population of Cape Breton Island in 2001 was 147,454, a 6.8% decline from 158,260 in 1996.

'''Ethnic composition'''{{Dubious|date=January 2009}}
*95.0% Caucasian
*3.6% [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] (Canadian First Nation)
*0.7% [[Black people|Black]]
*0.1% [[Arab]]

'''Religious groups'''

[[Canada 2001 Census|Statistics Canada]] in 2001 reported a &quot;religion&quot; total of 107,880 for Cape Breton, including 3,915 with &quot;no religious affiliation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/standard/themes/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?Temporal=2001&amp;PID=55822&amp;METH=1&amp;APATH=3&amp;PTYPE=55440&amp;THEME=56&amp;FREE=0&amp;AID=0&amp;FOCUS=0&amp;VID=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GK=0&amp;SC=1&amp;CPP=99&amp;SR=1&amp;RL=0&amp;RPP=9999&amp;D1=0&amp;D2=0&amp;D3=0&amp;D4=0&amp;D5=0&amp;D6=0&amp;GID=431530 Table from Statistics Canada]'' (Nova Scotia Statistics Agency)&lt;/ref&gt;  Major categories included:
* [[Roman Catholic]]: 69,820
* [[Protestant]]: 32,575 (including 13,790 United Church and 10,170 Anglican)
* [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]: 395
* [[Judaism|Jewish]]: 235
* [[Islam|Muslim]]: 135

Synagogues in Sydney and Glace Bay serve a small historic Jewish community (which was once one of the larger ones in eastern Canada) while more recent Muslim immigrants hold Friday prayers at [[Cape Breton University]].  [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] are a tiny minority (70 in 2001, according to Statistics Canada), although [[Gampo Abbey]] in [[Pleasant Bay, Nova Scotia|Pleasant Bay]] has been operational since 1984.

Cape Breton Island has two major coal deposits:  the Sydney Coal Field in the southeastern part of the island along the Atlantic Ocean drove the Industrial Cape Breton economy throughout the 19th and 20th centuries—until after [[World War II]] its industries were the largest private employers in Canada; the Inverness Coal Field in the western part of the island along the Gulf of St. Lawrence is significantly smaller but hosted several mines.

[[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] has traditionally been the main port, with various facilities in a large, sheltered, natural harbour. It is the island's largest commercial centre and home to the ``[[Cape Breton Post]]`` daily newspaper, as well as two television stations, [[CBIT-TV]] (CBC) and [[CJCB-TV]] (CTV), and several radio stations. The [[Marine Atlantic]] terminal at [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia|North Sydney]] is the terminal for large ferries travelling to [[Channel-Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador|Channel–Port aux Basques]] and seasonally to [[Argentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|Argentia]] on the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].

[[Point Edward, Nova Scotia|Point Edward]] on the west side of Sydney Harbour is the location of Sydport, a former [[Royal Canadian Navy|navy]] base ({{HMCS|Protector}}) now converted to commercial use. The [[Canadian Coast Guard College]] is located nearby at Westmount.  Petroleum, bulk coal, and cruise ship facilities are also located in Sydney Harbour.

[[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]] is the second largest urban community in population and was the island's main coal mining centre until its last mine ceased operation in the 1980s. Glace Bay served as the hub of the Sydney &amp; Louisburg Railway and also as a major fishing port. At one time, Glace Bay was known as the largest town in Nova Scotia, based on population.

[[Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia|Port Hawkesbury]] has risen to prominence since the completion of the Canso Causeway and [[Canso Canal]] created an artificial deep-water port, allowing extensive petrochemical, pulp and paper, and gypsum handling facilities to be established.  The Strait of Canso is completely navigable to [[Seawaymax]] vessels, and Port Hawkesbury is open to the deepest-draught vessels on the world's oceans.  Large marine vessels may also enter Bras d'Or Lake through the Great Bras d'Or channel whereas small craft have the additional use of the Little Bras d'Or channel or [[St. Peters Canal]]. The St. Peters Canal is no longer used by commercial shipping on Cape Breton Island but is an important waterway for recreational vessels.

The industrial Cape Breton area faced several challenges with the closure of the [[Cape Breton Development Corporation]]'s (DEVCO) [[coal mine]]s and the [[Sydney Steel Corporation]]'s (SYSCO) [[steel mill]].  In recent years the Island's residents have been attempting to diversify the area economy by investing in tourism developments, [[call centre]]s, and small businesses, as well as manufacturing ventures in such fields as auto parts, pharmaceuticals, and window glazings.

While the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton Regional Municipality]] is in transition from an industrial to a service-based economy, the rest of Cape Breton Island outside of the industrial area surrounding Sydney-Glace Bay has been more stable, with a mixture of fishing, forestry, small-scale agriculture, and tourism.

Tourism in particular has grown throughout the post-[[World War II|Second World War]] era, especially the growth in vehicle-based touring, which was furthered by the creation of the [[Cabot Trail]] scenic drive.  The scenery of the island is rivalled in northeastern North America only by [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and Cape Breton Island tourism marketing places a heavy emphasis on its [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Gaels|Gaelic]] heritage through events such as the Celtic Colours Festival, held each October, as well as promotions through the [[Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts]].

Whale-watching is a popular attraction for tourists. Whale-watching cruises are operated by numerous vendors from Baddeck to Cheticamp. The most popular species of whale found in Cape Breton's waters is the [[Pilot whale]].

The primary east-west road on the island is [[Nova Scotia Highway 105|Highway 105]], the [[Trans-Canada Highway]], although [[Nova Scotia Trunk 4|Trunk 4]] is also heavily used.  [[Nova Scotia Highway 125|Highway 125]] is an important arterial route around Sydney Harbour in the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton Regional Municipality]].  The [[Cabot Trail]], circling the Cape Breton Highlands, and [[Nova Scotia Trunk 19|Trunk 19]], along the western coast of the island, are important secondary roads. Railway connections between the port of Sydney to [[Canadian National Railway]] in [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]] are maintained by the [[Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway]].

The [[Cabot Trail]] is a scenic road circuit around and over the [[Cape Breton Highlands]] with spectacular coastal vistas; over 400,000 visitors drive the Cabot Trail each summer and fall.  Coupled with the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]], it has driven the growth of the tourism industry on the island in recent decades. The ''[[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast]]'' travel guide has rated Cape Breton Island as one of the best island destinations in the world.

==Traditional music==
{{main|Cape Breton fiddling}}

Cape Breton is well known for its traditional fiddle music, which was brought to North America by [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[immigrants]] during the [[Highland Clearances]].  The traditional style has been well preserved in Cape Breton, and [[céilidh]]s have become a popular attraction for summer tourists.  [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness County]] in particular has a heavy concentration of musical activity, with regular performances in communities such as [[Mabou, Nova Scotia|Mabou]] and [[Judique, Nova Scotia|Judique]]. Judique is recognized as 'Bhaile nam Fonn', (literally: Village of Tunes) or the 'Home of Celtic Music', featuring the Celtic Music Interpretive Centre. Performers who have received significant recognition outside of Cape Breton include [[Buddy MacMaster]], [[Natalie MacMaster]], [[Ashley MacIsaac]], [[The Rankin Family]], [[Aselin Debison]], and the [[Barra MacNeils]].

[[The Men of the Deeps]] are a male choral group of current and former miners from the industrial Cape Breton area.

The '''Cthulhu Mythos''', also known as the '''[[Lovecraft Mythos]]''',&lt;ref&gt;[[S.T. Joshi|Joshi]], &quot;The Lovecraft Mythos&quot;, ''H. P. Lovecraft'', p. 31''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[shared universe|shared fictional universe]] created in the 1920s by American [[horror fiction|horror]] writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]].

The term was coined by Lovecraft's associate [[August Derleth]], and named after [[Cthulhu]], a powerful fictional entity in Lovecraft's stories. It refers to a loose framework formed by common elements (such as places, names, or entities) that appear in more than one tale, adding continuity and depth to the works.  Authors writing in the [[Lovecraftian horror|Lovecraftian milieu]] have continued to use elements of the mythos in an ongoing expansion of the fictional universe, sometimes in ways far removed from Lovecraft's original conception.&lt;ref&gt;Harms, &quot;A Brief History of the Cthulhu Mythos&quot;, ''The Encyclopedia Cthulhiana'', pp. viii–ix.&lt;/ref&gt; The mythos is not necessarily consistent from story to story, as many writers, including Lovecraft himself, would frequently alter dates, names, and locations to suit the framework of one particular work.

==Development==
[[Robert M. Price]], in his essay &quot;H. P. Lovecraft and the [[Cthulhu]] Mythos&quot;, described two stages in the development of the Cthulhu Mythos. The first stage, or &quot;Cthulhu Mythos proper&quot; as Price calls it, took shape during Lovecraft's lifetime and was subject to his guidance. The second stage occurred under August Derleth who attempted to categorize and expand the Mythos after Lovecraft's death.&lt;ref&gt;Price, &quot;H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos&quot;, ''Crypt of Cthulhu #35'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First stage (the Mythos proper)===
{{Main|Lovecraft Mythos}}
Lovecraft borrowed terms and ideas from earlier writers he admired: [[Hastur]], for example, was originally a benevolent deity mentioned in an [[Ambrose Bierce]] story, but took on more sinister traits when appropriated a few years later by [[Robert W. Chambers]]. Lovecraft's only references to Hastur are in &quot;[[The Whisperer in Darkness]]&quot;. The [[Great Old One]] Hastur the Unspeakable was created by [[August Derleth]] in &quot;The Return of Hastur&quot; (1937).

During the latter part of Lovecraft's life, there was much borrowing of story elements among the authors of the &quot;Lovecraft Circle&quot;, and many others, a clique of writers with whom Lovecraft corresponded. This group included [[Clark Ashton Smith]], [[Robert E. Howard]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Frank Belknap Long]], and [[Henry Kuttner]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Lovecraft recognized that each writer had his own story-cycle, and that an element from one cycle would not necessarily become part of another simply because a writer used it in one of his stories. For example, although Smith might mention &quot;Kthulhut&quot; (referring to Lovecraft's [[Cthulhu]]) or Iog-Sotôt ([[Yog-Sothoth]]) in one of his Hyperborean tales, this does not mean that Cthulhu is part of the [[Hyperborean cycle]]. A notable exception, however, is Smith's [[Tsathoggua]], which Lovecraft appropriated for his revision of [[Zelia Bishop]]'s &quot;The Mound&quot; ([[1940 in literature|1940]]). Lovecraft effectively connected Smith's creation to his story-cycle by placing Tsathoggua alongside such entities as [[Cthulhu]], [[Great Old One compendium#Yig|Yig]], [[Shub-Niggurath]], and [[Great Old One compendium#Nug and Yeb|Nug and Yeb]] in subterranean [[K'n-yan]].

Most of the elements of Lovecraft's Mythos were not a cross-pollination of the various story-cycles of the Lovecraft Circle, but were instead deliberately created by each writer to become part of the Mythos, the most notable example{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} being the various arcane grimoires of forbidden lore.  So, for example, Robert E. Howard has his character [[Cthulhu Mythos biographies#Von Junzt, Friedrich Wilheim|Friedrich Von Junzt]] reading Lovecraft's ''[[Necronomicon]]'' in &quot;The Children of the Night&quot; ([[1931 in literature|1931]]), and Lovecraft in turn mentions Howard's ''[[Unaussprechlichen Kulten]]'' in both &quot;Out of the Aeons&quot; ([[1935 in literature|1935]]) and &quot;The Shadow Out of Time&quot; ([[1936 in literature|1936]]).&lt;ref&gt;Price, &quot;H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos&quot;, ''Crypt of Cthulhu #35'', pp. 6&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt; Howard frequently corresponded with [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and the two would sometimes insert references or elements of each others' settings in their works. Later editors reworked many of the original [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] stories by Howard; thus, diluting this connection. Nevertheless, many of Howard's unedited Conan stories are arguably part of the Cthulhu Mythos.&lt;ref&gt;Patrice Louinet. ''Hyborian Genesis: Part 1'', page 436, ''The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian''; 2003, Del Rey.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Mythos as a background element====
According to David E. Schultz, Lovecraft never meant to create a canonical Mythos but rather intended his imaginary pantheon to serve merely as a background element. Thus, Lovecraft's &quot;pseudomythology&quot;—a term used by Lovecraft himself and others to describe the beings appearing in his stories—is the backdrop for his tales but is not the primary focus. Indeed, the focal point of his stories is often the fictional town of [[Arkham]] and not beings like Cthulhu.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, &quot;Who Needs the Cthulhu Mythos?&quot;, ''A Century Less A Dream'', pp. 46, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lovecraft himself sometimes referred to his mythos humorously as &quot;Yog-Sothothery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timpratt.org/611.html&lt;/ref&gt;

That Lovecraft gave more weight to his &quot;Arkham cycle&quot; locations than to his pseudo-mythology is perhaps demonstrated by his so-called revision stories. Will Murray points out that while Lovecraft often employed his fictional pantheon in the stories he ghostwrote for other authors, he reserved Arkham and its environs exclusively for those tales he wrote under his own name.&lt;ref&gt;(Murray, &quot;In Search of Arkham Country I&quot;, pp. 105, 107.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Lovecraft may not have been serious when he spoke of developing a &quot;myth-cycle&quot; and probably would have had no need to give it a name anyway.  Since he used his Mythos simply as background material, he probably had this in mind when he allowed other writers to use it in their own stories. It could be said that Lovecraft's Mythos was a kind of elaborate inside joke propagating among the writers of his circle.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  However, August Derleth's understanding of the Mythos appears to have been that Lovecraft wanted other authors to actively write about the myth-cycle rather than to simply allude to it in their stories.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, &quot;Who Needs the Cthulhu Mythos?&quot;, pp. 46–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best example of the impact of the mythos is Lovecraft's most recognizable contribution to popular culture: the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;, a fictional grimoire referenced in many of the works written by him, his circle, and others; indeed, it has been referenced by authors who appear to be unaware that it's fictional. Repeated references by a wider and wider circle of authors gave it a name recognition that allowed the mythical book to move beyond the penumbra of the mythos' widest reaches, become untethered from its creator, and drift into the wider sea of vaguely recognized cultural memes.  While fictitious (and Lovecraft himself had to work to dispel rumors of its actual existence), it is referenced often in popular culture in movies, music and literature as an ancient book of incredible evil.

===Second stage (the &quot;Derleth Mythos&quot;)===
The second stage began with [[August Derleth]],&lt;ref&gt;The writer [[Richard L. Tierney]] coined the term &quot;Derleth Mythos&quot; to distinguish between August Derleth's version and Lovecraft's (Cf. Richard L. Tierney, &quot;The Derleth Mythos&quot;,  ''Discovering H. P. Lovecraft'', p. 52). Dirk Mosig, goes further and recommends that the term ''Cthulhu Mythos'' be dropped altogether in favor of the ''Yog-Sothoth Cycle of Myth'' (Mosig, &quot;H. P. Lovecraft: Myth-Maker&quot;, ''Mosig at Last'', p. 28).&lt;/ref&gt; who added to the mythos and developed the ''[[elemental]] system'', associating the pantheon with the four elements of ''air'', ''earth'', ''fire'', and ''water''. To understand Derleth's changes to the Mythos, it is important to distinguish among Lovecraft's story cycles. Price says that Lovecraft's writings can be divided into three separate groups: the Dunsanian, Arkham, and Cthulhu cycles.&lt;ref&gt;Price, &quot;H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos&quot;, ''Crypt of Cthulhu #35'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dunsanian stories are those that are written in the vein of [[Lord Dunsany]] (and may include Lovecraft's so-called [[Dream Cycle]] tales), the Arkham stories include those that take place in Lovecraft's fictionalized New England setting, and the Cthulhu cycle stories are those that use Lovecraft's cosmic story-cycle (the ''[[Lovecraft Mythos]]'').

Derleth combined Lovecraft's various cycles to create a large, singular story-cycle{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}. For example, he appropriated  [[Nodens (Cthulhu Mythos)|Nodens]] from the Dunsanian cycle and leagued him with the ''Elder Gods'' against the ''Old Ones''. He also introduced a [[dualism|good versus evil dichotomy]] into the Mythos contrary to the dark, nihilistic vision of Lovecraft and his immediate circle.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Derleth apparently treated any story mentioning a mythos element as part of the Mythos, and in consequence all other elements in the story also became part of the mythos. Hence, as Lovecraft made passing reference to Clark Ashton Smith's ''[[Cthulhu Mythos arcane literature#Book of Eibon|Book of Eibon]]'', Derleth added Smith's [[Outer God#Ubbo-Sathla|Ubbo-Sathla]] to the mythos. Because of Derleth's broad canon the Mythos grew enormously.&lt;ref&gt;Price, &quot;H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos&quot;, ''Crypt of Cthulhu #35'', pp. 6&amp;ndash;10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further removing the Cthulhu Mythos from its source were stories written by such authors as [[Lin Carter]], [[Colin Wilson]], and [[Brian Lumley]]. Carter was especially influential in setting out detailed lists of gods, their ancestry, and their servitors through his Mythos tales, attempting to codify the elements of the Mythos as much as possible.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  Through this process, more gods, books, and places were created and interlinked with each other.

==Structure==
Mythos stories tend to refer to the &quot;Great Old Ones,&quot; a fearsome assortment of ancient, powerful [[deity|deities]] who came from outer space and once ruled the Earth. They are presently [[wikt:quiescent|quiescent]], having fallen into a death-like sleep at some time in the distant past.&lt;ref&gt;Harms, &quot;A Brief History of the Cthulhu Mythos&quot;, p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known of these beings is Cthulhu, who currently lies &quot;dead [but] dreaming&quot; in the submerged city of [[R'lyeh]] somewhere in the southeast [[Pacific Ocean]].  One day, &quot;when the stars are right&quot;, the stones of R'lyeh will rise from beneath the sea, and Cthulhu will awaken and wreak havoc on the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Lovecraft, [http://www.mythostomes.com/content/view/30/70/ &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;] (1928).&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his notoriety, Cthulhu is not the most powerful of the deities, nor is he the [[Theology|theological]] center of the mythos.&lt;ref&gt;Mosig says that Cthulhu &quot;is perhaps one of the weakest and least important of the main entities [in the mythos]—save for his immediacy&quot;. He also notes that in the Necronomicon passage in Lovecraft's &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; (1929), Cthulhu is demoted to &quot;their cousin&quot;. (Mosig, &quot;H. P. Lovecraft: Myth-Maker&quot;, ''Mosig at Last'', p. 25.)&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Nyarlathotep]], who fulfills Azathoth's random urges, has intervened more frequently and more directly in human affairs than any other Outer god. He has also displayed more blatant contempt for humanity, especially his own worshippers, than almost any other Lovecraftian deity.

==Theme==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
The essence of the Mythos is that the entirety of humanity is insignificant on a cosmic scale. The human world is but a fragile bubble in an infinitely vast and indifferent universe, isolated by great gulfs of both time and space. Though we consider ourselves masters of all creation, as a species our limited perceptions allow us to see only a fraction of the full range of reality. Beyond our pathetic awareness dwell vast and ancient forces, completely beyond our ability to influence in any way, whose merest thoughtless twitch would annihilate every trace of humanity. Our seeming dominance over the world is illusory and ephemeral. We are blessed in that we do not realize what lies dormant and unknown in forgotten places on [[Earth]] and beyond. As Lovecraft famously begins his short story, ''[[The Call of Cthulhu]]'', &quot;The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.&quot;

Now and then, individuals can, by [[accident]] or [[carelessness]], catch a glimpse of, or even confront the ancient extraterrestrial entities that the mythology centers on, usually with fatal consequences. Other times, they are represented by their non-human worshipers, whose existence shatters the worldview of those who stumble across them. Human followers exist as well. Because of the limitations of the [[human mind]], these deities appear as so overwhelming that they can often drive a person insane. They are portrayed as neither good nor evil. Within the Mythos these are concepts invented by our species as a way to explain intentions and actions which may otherwise seem inexplicable.

''The Call of Cthulhu'' was the premiere story in which Lovecraft realized and made full use of these themes,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} which is why his [[mythology]] would later be named after the creature in this story, as it defined a new direction in both his authorship and in the horror fiction genre. This is also the only story by Lovecraft where humans and one of the cosmic entities called the Great Old Ones come face to face.

In his final years, Lovecraft used fewer supernatural elements to represent the dangers which threaten humanity. Instead, he gradually replaced them with non-supernatural cosmic beings and phenomena, based on principles outside the laws of nature in our own space-time continuum. This science-fictional trend particularly becomes clear in works such as ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]''.  Many of these later tales also humanize these aliens to some extent, and the degree to which they still retain the theme of nihilistic horror varies.

==Derleth's involvement==
Derleth's take on the mythos drop the themes of human meaninglessness and moved the story more towards his views on [[Roman Catholic]] cosmology and moral principles. Instead of a universe of meaninglessness and chaos, Derleth's mythos is a struggle of good versus evil.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, &quot;Heritage of Horror&quot;, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Derleth once wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!--
NOTE: The following is quoted VERBATIM from the Arkham House edition -- please do not copyedit (except for adding/changing links).
--&gt;
As Lovecraft conceived the deities or forces of his mythos, there were, initially, the Elder Gods... [T]hese Elder Gods were benign deities, representing the forces of good, and existed peacefully at or near [[Betelgeuse|Betelgeuze&lt;!--sic--&gt;]] in the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], very rarely stirring forth to intervene in the unceasing struggle between the powers of evil and the [[race (fantasy)|races]] of Earth. These powers of evil were variously known as the Great Old Ones or the Ancient Ones...
&lt;br /&gt;—August Derleth, &quot;The Cthulhu Mythos&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Derleth, &quot;The Cthulhu Mythos&quot;, ''Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos'', p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Derleth's theories about the ''Cthulhu Mythos'' thus differ from Lovecraft's concept, which was not really a cohesive, singular entity, but rather a collection of ideas that could be used in separate works to provoke the same emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, &quot;Iä! Iä! Cthulhu Fhtagn!&quot;, ''Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos'', p. viii. Turner writes: &quot;Lovecraft's imaginary [[wikt:cosmogony|cosmogony]] was never a static system but rather a sort of [[wikt:aesthetic|aesthetic]] construct that remained ever adaptable to its creator's developing personality and altering interests... [T]here was never a rigid system that might be posthumously appropriated by the [[wikt:pasticheur|pasticheur]]... [T]he essence of the mythos lies not in a pantheon of imaginary deities nor in a cobwebby collection of forgotten tomes, but rather in a certain convincing cosmic attitude.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The atheist Lovecraft himself rejected the idea of [[deity]], deriding it as &quot;a logical and inevitable result of ignorance&quot; and stating that &quot;&quot;all religious demonstrativeness and ceremony is basically orgiastic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lovecraft, H.P. &quot;In Defense of Dagon&quot; reprinted in ''Miscellaneous Writings'' (S. T. Joshi, ed.) Sauk City: Arkham, 1995; pp. 165-66&lt;/ref&gt;


The Elder Gods of Derleth's mythos never appear in Lovecraft's writings, except for one or two termed &quot;Other Gods&quot; such as Nodens in Lovecraft's &quot;[[The Strange High House in the Mist]]&quot; (though perhaps this is an example of how &quot;very rarely [they stir] forth&quot;; i.e., usually never). Furthermore, in Lovecraft the Great Old Ones, or ''Ancient Ones'', have no unified [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. Indeed, the term &quot;Ancient Ones&quot; appears in only one Lovecraft story, &quot;[[Through the Gates of the Silver Key]]&quot;, actually a collaboration between Lovecraft and his friend and correspondent [[E. Hoffmann Price]].

===Elemental theory===
Derleth connected the deities of the Mythos to the four elements of ''air'', ''earth'', ''fire'', and ''water'', filling in gaps in the system by creating the beings [[Ithaqua]], representing ''air'', and [[Cthugha]], representing ''fire''.&lt;ref&gt;Derleth created Cthugha when a fan, [[Francis Towner Laney]], pointed out that he had neglected to include a fire elemental in his schema. Laney, the editor of ''[[The Acolyte]]'', had categorized the Mythos in an essay that first appeared in the Winter 1942 issue of the magazine. Impressed by the glossary, Derleth asked Laney to rewrite it for publication in the Arkham House collection ''Beyond the Wall of Sleep'' ([[1943 in literature|1943]]). (Robert M. Price, &quot;Editorial Shards&quot;, ''Crypt of Cthulhu #32'', p. 2.) Laney's essay (&quot;The Cthulhu Mythos&quot;) was later republished in ''Crypt of Cthulhu #32'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; As realized, the system has a few problems. For example, Derleth classified Cthulhu as a ''water elemental'', which makes it odd that he could be trapped beneath the ocean and his [[Telepathy|psychic emanations]] blocked by water. Another problem arises in applying the elemental theory to beings that function on a cosmic scale, such as [[Yog-Sothoth]]—some authors have attempted to get around this by creating a separate category of ''aethyr'' elementals for Azathoth, Shub-Niggurath, Nyarlathotep, and Yog-Sothoth. Finally, Derleth matched the ''earth'' beings against the ''fire'' beings and the ''air'' beings against the ''water'' beings, which is inconsistent with the [[classical elements]] dichotomy in which ''air'' opposes ''earth'' and ''fire'' opposes ''water''.&lt;ref&gt;Harms, &quot;Elemental Theory&quot;, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Derleth became a publisher of Lovecraft's stories after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, &quot;Heritage of Horror&quot;, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Lovecraft himself was very critical of his own writings and was often easily discouraged, especially when faced with any rejection of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Joshi, ''The Scriptorium'', &quot;H. P. Lovecraft&quot;, section I.&lt;/ref&gt; Were it not for Derleth, Lovecraft's writings and the Cthulhu Mythos might likely have remained largely unknown.

==Role-playing game==
Another influence has been the [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu RPG]] published by [[Chaosium]] in 1981. Largely developed by [[Sandy Petersen]], this version of the Mythos broke Lovecraft's entities down into further sub-groupings: [[Outer God]]s, [[Great Old Ones]], servitor races and the nebulously-termed Other Gods. Material from these sources has slowly crept back into mainstream Mythos fiction, as Chaosium published fiction related to, or written by players of, the game.  With the company's permission, in 2009 Jimmy Maher released a work of [[Interactive Fiction]], ''The King of Shreds and Patches'', based on a scenario in the Chaosium publication ''Strange Aeons''.

Many of the newer generation of Mythos authors (especially those published in Chaosium compendiums) take their cue from this more clinical, continuity-focused brand of the Mythos instead of Lovecraft's more mysterious version.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  Some new stories (such as those found in ''[[The Spiraling Worm]]: Man Versus the Cthulhu Mythos'') as well as the ''[[Delta Green]]'' role-playing game have included protagonists who are members of government agencies or secret societies actively opposed to the entities that dominate the Cthulhu Mythos. This is a significant divergence, as the protagonist changes from being an unprepared victim of mind-bendingly unearthly encounters to a warrior prepared both physically and mentally to fight the horrors of the world.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  Though this is not an entirely new concept, as H.P. Lovecraft did have [[Innsmouth]] destroyed by an attack from the Federal government, but these modern horror action protagonists have more in common with federal agents from ''[[The X-Files]]'' or the powerful sorcerers Dr. Laban Shrewsbury and [[Titus Crow]] (invented by [[August Derleth]] and [[Brian Lumley]] respectively) with their acolytes and handy inventory of Mythos tomes, magic artifacts and spells.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

[[Image:Crane shot.jpg|right|350px|thumb|Crane shot]]
In [[motion picture terminology]], a '''crane shot''' is a shot taken by a camera on a crane. The most obvious uses are to view the actors from above or to move up and away from them, a common way of ending a movie. Some filmmakers like to have the camera on a boom arm just to make it easier to move around between ordinary set-ups. Most cranes accommodate both the camera and an operator, but some can be operated by remote control. They are usually, but not always, found in what are supposed to be emotional or suspenseful scenes. One example of this technique is the shots taken by remote cranes in the car-chase sequence of ''[[To Live and Die in L.A. (film)|To Live and Die in L.A.]]''.

During the last few years, camera cranes have been miniaturized and costs have dropped so dramatically that most aspiring film makers have access to these tools.  What was once a &quot;Hollywood&quot; effect is now available for under $400.

== Famous crane camera shots==
[[File:Film Shooting From a Crane.jpg|thumb|Shooting from manual crane]]
* The [[Western (genre)|Western]] ''[[High Noon (1952 film)|High Noon]]'' had a famous crane shot. The shot backs up and raises, in order to see Marshal [[Will Kane]] totally alone and isolated on the street.
* The television comedy [[Second City Television|Second City Television (SCTV)]] uses the concept of the crane shot as comedic material. After using a crane shot in one of the first NBC-produced episodes, the network complained about the exorbitant cost of renting the crane. SCTV writers responded by making the &quot;crane shot&quot; a ubiquitous symbol of production excess while also lampooning network executives who care nothing about artistic vision and everything for the bottom line. At the end of the second season, an inebriated [[Johnny LaRue]] is given his very own crane by Santa Claus, implying he would be able to have a crane shot whenever he wanted it.
* [[Jean-Luc Godard]], in his film [[Sympathy for the Devil (film)|Sympathy for the Devil]], used a crane for almost every shot in the movie, giving each scene a 360 degree tour of the tableau Godard presented to the viewer.  In the final scene he even shows, on camera, the crane he was able to rent with his budget by including it in the scene somewhat.  This was one of his traits as a filmmaker - showing off his budget - as he did with Brigitte Bardot in [[Le Mepris]] (Contempt).
* Director [[Dennis Dugan]] frequently uses top-to-bottom crane shots in his comedy films.
* [[Orson Welles]] used a crane camera during the iconic opening of ''[[Touch of Evil]]''. The camera perched on a Chapman crane begins on a close-up of a ticking time bomb and ends three-plus minutes later with a blinding explosion.
* The closing take of [[Richard Attenborough]]'s film version of ''[[Oh! What a Lovely War]]'' which begins on a single [[war grave]], gradually pulling backward to reveal hundreds of identical crosses.

'''''Chariots of Fire''''' is a 1981 British film. It tells the fact-based story of two athletes in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]]: [[Eric Liddell]], a devout [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Christian]] who runs for the glory of God, and [[Harold Abrahams]], an [[English people|English]] [[Jew]] who runs to overcome prejudice.
 
The film was written by [[Colin Welland]] and directed by [[Hugh Hudson]]. It was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]] and won four, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. It is ranked 19th in the [[British Film Institute]]'s list of [[BFI Top 100 British films|Top 100 British films]]. 

The film's title was inspired by the line, &quot;Bring me my chariot of fire,&quot; from the [[William Blake]] poem adapted into the popular British hymn [[And did those feet in ancient time|&quot;Jerusalem&quot;]];  the hymn is heard at the end of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Dans, Peter E. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=52GpN0Hzxd8C&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=colin+welland+jerusalem+%22chariots+of+fire%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3EdJTPqqKovSsAP97PFI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=colin%20welland%20jerusalem%20%22chariots%20of%20fire%22&amp;f=false ''Christians in the Movies: A Century of Saints and Sinners''.] Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2009. p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; The original phrase &quot;chariot(s) of fire&quot; is from [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 2:11 and 6:17 in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+kings%202:11-2:11&amp;version=NIV 2 Kings 2:11]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+kings%206:17-6:17&amp;version=NIV 2 Kings 6:17]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1919, [[Harold Abrahams]] ([[Ben Cross]]) enters [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], where he experiences [[anti-Semitism]] from the staff, but enjoys participating in the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] club. He becomes the first person to ever complete the [[Trinity Great Court#The_Great_Court_Run|Trinity Great Court Run]] — running around the college courtyard in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12. Abrahams achieves an undefeated string of victories in various national running competitions. Although focused on his running, he falls in love with a leading Gilbert and Sullivan soprano, Sybil ([[Alice Krige]]).

[[Eric Liddell]] ([[Ian Charleson]]), born in China of Scottish missionary parents, is in Scotland. His devout sister Jennie ([[Cheryl Campbell]]) disapproves of Liddell's plans to pursue competitive running. But Liddell sees running as a way of glorifying God before returning to China to work as a missionary. 

When they first race against each other, Liddell beats Abrahams. Abrahams takes it extremely badly, but [[Sam Mussabini]] ([[Ian Holm]]), a professional trainer whom he had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the Cambridge college masters ([[John Gielgud]] and [[Lindsay Anderson]]). They allege it is ungentlemanly for an amateur to &quot;play the tradesman&quot; by employing a professional coach. Abrahams realizes this is a cover for their anti-Semitism and class-based sense of superiority, and dismisses their concern.&lt;!--This is pretty well backed up by Gielgud's character's comments concerning &quot;a Semite&quot;, &quot;a different god&quot; etc--&gt;

When Eric Liddell accidentally misses a church prayer meeting because of his running, his sister Jennie upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about God. Eric tells her that though he intends to eventually return to the China mission, he feels divinely inspired when running, and that not to run would be to dishonour God: &quot;I believe that God made me for a purpose. But He also made me fast, and when I run, I feel His pleasure.&quot; 

The two athletes, after years of training and racing, are accepted to represent [[Great Britain]] in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]] in [[Paris]]. Also accepted are Abrahams' Cambridge friends, Lord Andrew Lindsay ([[Nigel Havers]]), [[Aubrey Montague]] ([[Nicholas Farrell]]), and [[Henry Stallard]] ([[Daniel Gerroll]]). 
 
While boarding the boat to Paris for the Olympics, Liddell learns the news that the heat for his 100 metre race will be on a Sunday. He refuses to run the race — despite strong pressure from the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] and the British Olympic committee — because his Christian convictions prevent him from running on the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]].  

Hope appears in the form of Liddell's teammate Lord Andrew Lindsay. Having already won a silver medal in the [[400 metre hurdles]], Lindsay proposes to yield his place in the [[400 metres|400 metre race]] on the following Thursday to Liddell, who gratefully agrees. His religious convictions in the face of national athletic pride make headlines around the world.

Liddell delivers a sermon at the Paris [[Church of Scotland]] that Sunday, and quotes from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 40, verse 31: &quot;But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and be not weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.&quot;

Abrahams is badly beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200 metre race. He knows his last chance for a medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race, and wins. His coach Sam Mussabini is overcome that the years of dedication and training have paid off with an Olympic gold medal. Now Abrahams can get on with his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he had neglected for the sake of running.   

Before Liddell's race, the American coach remarks dismissively to his runners that Liddell has little chance of doing well in his now far longer 400 metre race. But one of the American runners, [[Jackson Scholz]], hands Liddell a note of support for his convictions. Liddell defeats the American favourites and wins the gold medal.

The British team returns home triumphant. As the film ends, onscreen text explains that Abrahams married Sybil, and became the elder statesman of British athletics. Eric Liddell went on to missionary work in China. All of Scotland mourned his death in 1945 in Japanese-occupied China.

== Historical accuracy ==
=== Characters ===
The film depicts Abrahams as attending [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]] with three other Olympic athletes: [[Henry Stallard]], [[Aubrey Montague]], and Lord Andrew Lindsay. Abrahams and Stallard were in fact students there and competed in the 1924 Olympics. Montague also competed in the Olympics  as depicted, but he attended Oxford, not Cambridge.&lt;ref name=aubrey&gt;[http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/mo/evelyn-montague-1.html Aubrey Montague biography] at SportsReference.com&lt;/ref&gt; Aubrey Montague sent daily letters to his mother about his time at Oxford and the Olympics; these letters were the basis of Montague's narration in the film. 

The character of Lindsay was based on [[David Burghley]] (Lord Burghley), a significant figure in the history of British athletics. Although Burghley did attend Cambridge, he was not a contemporary of Harold Abrahams, as Abrahams was an undergraduate from 1919 to 1923 and Burghley was at Cambridge from 1923 to 1927. One scene in the film depicts the Burghley-based &quot;Lindsay&quot; as practicing hurdles on his estate with full champagne glasses placed on each hurdle — this was in fact something the wealthy Burghley did.&lt;ref name=hudson&gt;Hugh Hudson's commentary to the 2005 ''Chariots of Fire'' DVD&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cross and Havers.jpg||thumb|right|230px|[[Harold Abrahams|Abrahams]] (left) and the [[David Burghley|Burghley]]-based Lindsay (right) attempt the [[Trinity Great Court#The_Great_Court_Run|Great Court Run]].]]
Another scene in the film recreates the [[Trinity Great Court#The_Great_Court_Run|Great Court Run]], in which the runners attempt to run around the perimeter of the [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in the time it takes the clock to strike 12 at midday. The film shows Abrahams performing the feat for the first time in history. In fact, at the time of filming the only person on record known to have succeeded was [[David Burghley]], in 1927. In ''Chariots of Fire'', Lindsay, who is based on David Burghley, runs the Great Court Run with Abrahams in order to spur him on, and crosses the finish line just a moment too late. Since the film, the Great Court Run has also been successfully run by Trinity undergraduate Sam Dobin, in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-490027/Modern-day-hero-runs-away-Chariots-Fire-challenge.html &quot;Modern-day hero runs away with Chariots of Fire challenge.&quot;] ''[[Daily Mail]]'' 27 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the film, Eric Liddell is tripped up by a Frenchman in the 400 metre event of a Scotland–France international athletic meeting. He recovers, makes up a 20 metre deficit, and wins. This was based on fact; the actual race was during a Triangular Contest meet between Scotland, England, and Ireland at [[Stoke-on-Trent]] in England in July 1923. His achievement was remarkable as he had already won the 100- and 220-yard events that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Russell W.|title=God's Joyful Runner|publisher=Bridge Publishing, Inc|year=1987|page=54|isbn=0882706241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also unmentioned with regard to Liddell is that it was he who introduced Abrahams to [[Sam Mussabini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0019/print.shtml |title=Bio of Liddell |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1902-01-16 |accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is alluded to: In the film Abrahams first encounters Mussabini while he is watching Liddell race. The film, however, suggests that Abrahams himself sought Mussabini's assistance.

Abrahams' fiancee is misidentified as [[Sybil Gordon]], a soprano at the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].  In fact, in 1936, Abrahams married [[Sybil Evers]], a mezzo-soprano in the D'Oyly Carte, but they did not meet until 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Karen. &quot;The Real ''Chariots of Fire'': Hollywood Took Liberties with Gold Medalist's Life.&quot; ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', October 13, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, in the film, Sybil is depicted as singing the role of Yum-Yum in ''[[The Mikado]]'', but neither Sybil Gordon nor Sybil Evers ever sang that role with D'Oyly Carte.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David.

Liddell's sister was several years younger than she was portrayed in the film. Her disapproval of Liddell's track career was creative licence; she actually fully supported his sporting work. Jenny Liddell Somerville cooperated fully with the making of the film and has a brief cameo in the Paris [[Church of Scotland]] during Liddell's sermon.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Russell W.

===1924 Olympics===
{{See also|Great Britain at the 1924 Summer Olympics}}

The film takes some liberties with the events at the 1924 Olympics, including the events surrounding Liddell's refusal to race on a Sunday. In the film, he doesn't learn that the 100 metre heat is to be held on the Christian &quot;Sabbath&quot; until he is boarding the boat to Paris. In fact, the schedule was made public several months in advance. Liddell did however face immense pressure to run on that Sunday and to compete in the 100 metres, getting called before a grilling by the British Olympic Committee, the Prince of Wales, and other [[grandee]]s;&lt;ref name=hudson/&gt; and his refusal to run made headlines around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Feg. [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/361517352.html?dids=361517352:361517352&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+24%2C+1924&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=DID+YOU+KNOW+THAT--&amp;pqatl=google &quot;DID YOU KNOW THAT ...&quot;]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. 24 June 1924. Full headline reads, &quot;Did You Know That Famous Scotch Sprinter Will Not Run In The Olympic 100 Metres Because The Trials Are Run On Sunday&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to change races was, even so, made well before embarking to Paris, and Liddell spent the intervening months training for the 400 metres, an event in which he had previously excelled. It is true, nonetheless, that Liddell's success in the Olympic 400m was largely unexpected. 

The film depicts Lindsay, having already won a medal in the 400 metre hurdles, giving up his place in the 400 metre race for Liddell. In fact [[David Burghley|Burghley]], on whom Lindsay is loosely based, was eliminated in the heats of the 110 hurdles (he would go on to win a gold medal in the 1928 Olympics), and Lindsay's deference to Liddell in the 400 was fabricated. 

The film reverses the order of Abrahams' 100m and 200m races at the Olympics. In reality, after winning the 100 metres race, Abrahams ran the [[200 metres]] but finished last, [[Jackson Scholz]] taking the gold medal. In the film, before his triumph in the 100m, Abrahams is shown losing the 200m and being scolded by Mussabini. And during the following scene in which Abrahams speaks with his friend Montague while receiving a massage from Mussabini, there is a French newspaper clipping showing Scholz and [[Charlie Paddock]] with a headline which states that the 200 metres was a triumph for the United States. In the same conversation, Abrahams laments getting &quot;beaten out of sight&quot; in the 200. The film thus has Abrahams overcoming the disappointment of losing the 200 by going on to win the 100, a reversal of the real order.

Eric Liddell actually also ran in the 200m race, and finished third, behind Paddock and Scholz. This was the only time in reality that Liddell and Abrahams competed in the same race. Their meeting in the 1923 [[Amateur Athletic Association|AAA]] Championship in the film was fictitious, though Liddell's record win in that race did spur Abrahams to train even harder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.ericliddell.org/ericliddell/recollections/content/arthurmarshall.htm |title=Recollections by Sir Arthur Marshall |publisher=Content.ericliddell.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Abrahams also won a silver medal as an opening runner for the [[4 x 100 metres relay]] team, not shown in the film. [[Aubrey Montague]] placed sixth in the [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]], as depicted.&lt;ref  name=aubrey /&gt;

====Personal inaccuracies at the Olympics====
In the film, the 100m bronze medallist is a character called &quot;Tom Watson&quot;; the real medallist was [[Arthur Porritt, Baron Porritt|Arthur Porritt]] of [[New Zealand]], who refused permission for his name to be used in the film, allegedly out of modesty. His wish was accepted by the film's producers, even though his permission was not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Arthur Espie Porritt  1900 - 1994 |url=http://www.library.otago.ac.nz/exhibitions/rhodes_scholars/arthur_espie_porritt.html |title=Reference to Porritt's modesty |publisher=Library.otago.ac.nz |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the brief back-story given for Watson, who is called up to the New Zealand team from [[Oxford University]], substantially matches Porritt's history. With the exception of Porritt, all the runners in the 100m final are identified correctly when they line up for inspection by the Prince of Wales.

Jackson Scholz is depicted as handing Liddell an inspirational Bible-quotation message  before the 400 metres final: &quot;It says in the good Book, 'He that honors me, I will honor.' Good luck.&quot;  In reality, it was an American team masseur who handed Liddell the note. For dramatic purposes, screenwriter Welland asked Scholz if he could be depicted handing the note, and Scholz readily agreed, saying &quot;Yes, great, as long as it makes me look good.&quot;&lt;ref name=hudson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Britain's 1924 Olympic Champs Live Again in 'Chariots of Fire'—and Run Away with the Oscars | work = [[People (magazine)|People]] | date = May 10, 1982 | volume = 17 | issue = 18 | url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20082112,00.html | accessdate = 2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
