Mumy has garnered praise from science fiction fandom for his portrayal of these two characters.

In 1996, he was a writer and co-creator of the show ''[[Space Cases]]'', a [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] television show with themes similar to ''[[Lost in Space]]''.

He played a [[Starfleet]] member in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode &quot;[[The Siege of AR-558 (DS9 episode)|The Siege of AR-558]]&quot; (November 1998).

Mumy has released a number of solo [[Compact disc|CD]]s, including ''Dying to Be Heard'', ''In the Current'', ''Pandora's Box'', ''After Dreams Come True'', ''Los Angeles Times'', and ''Ghosts'', as well as nine albums with partner [[Robert Haimer]] as [[Barnes and Barnes]]. Their most famous hit is the song &quot;[[Fish Heads (song)|Fish Heads]]&quot;, which was named as one of the top 100 videos of all time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. The Jenerators are a blues-rock band based in Los Angeles, CA featuring Tom Hebenstreit on vocals, electric guitars and keyboards; Bill Mumy on vocals, acoustic and electric guitars, harmonica, keyboards, and percussion; Gary Stockdale on vocals and bass; [[Miguel Ferrer]] on vocals, percussion and drums; David Jolliffe on guitar, percussion and vocals and Chris Ross on drums and percussion.

=== Friendship with Jonathan Harris ===
At age 11, in 1965, Mumy began working with [[Jonathan Harris]] on ''[[Lost in Space]]'', and the two became close friends, both on and off set. He would also spend time with Harris's family, while not working on &quot;Space&quot; or taking a hiatus from the show. In 1996, it was mentioned that Mumy was also reunited with Harris, again, at a [[Walt Disney]] convention in [[Orlando, Florida]]. Mumy worked again with Harris on the 1998 retrospective special ''Lost In Space: Forever'', where they reprised their roles in a scene written by Mumy (with Harris re-writing his lines). This was done one year after the rest of the cast (including both Mumy &amp; Harris) appeared inside [[TV Guide]] and said that the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] had planned to do a ''Lost in Space'' marathon while promoting a new movie. Harris was to appear in the planned TV movie, ''Lost in Space: The Journey Home'', but died before production started in 2002 and the production was cancelled. Mumy read the [[eulogy]] at Harris' funeral and was asked to narrate his longtime friend's life on [[A&amp;E Biography|A&amp;E ''Biography'']] that same year. According to a 2010 interview on ''Blog Talk Radio'''s, ''Lessons Learned'', Rick Tocquigny, when asked if Mumy was a Jonathan Harris fan, before Mumy's first meeting with Harris on ''Lost in Space'', he said at age 5, he was too young to watch his mentor's show ''[[The Third Man]]'' which was probably late at night, but was old enough to watch ''[[The Bill Dana Show]]'' (which also starred Harris's real-life best friend [[Don Adams]]). After that, he watched [[rerun]]s of ''The Third Man'', and he was a Jonathan Harris fan, growing up (when he was actually a fan of [[Guy Williams]]'s, ''[[Zorro (TV series)|Zorro]]'', who played his future TV father - John Robinson).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blogtalkradio.com/lifelessonsnetwork/2010/09/22/bill-mumy-of-lost-in-space-fame-shares-his-life-lessons&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal life ===
Unlike many child actors, Mumy entered the profession at his own insistence, and his parents took pains to make sure he matured properly in his job. His father, who was a cattle rancher, carefully invested his son's income, and thereby avoided problems encountered by other child actors of his period.

He currently lives in [[Hollywood Hills]], California, with his wife, Eileen, and their two child-actor children, Seth and [[Liliana Mumy|Liliana]].

The '''House of Bonaparte''' is an imperial and royal European [[dynasty]] founded by [[Napoleon I|Napoleon I of France]] in 1804, a French military leader who rose to notability out of the [[French Revolution]] and transformed the [[First French Republic|French Republic]] into the [[First French Empire]] within five years of his ''coup d'état''. Napoleon turned the ''[[Grande Armée]]'' against every major European power and dominated continental Europe through a series of military victories. He installed members of his family on the thrones of client states, founding the dynasty.

Throughout its history, the dynasty, as well as being [[Emperor of France|Emperors of the French]], held various other titles and territories including; their ancestral nation the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], [[Kingdom of Spain]], [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], [[Kingdom of Holland]] and the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. The dynasty was in a position of power for around a decade until the [[Napoleonic Wars]] began to take their toll. Making very powerful enemies such as [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], United Kingdom, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], as well as royalist (particularly [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]]) restorational movements in France, Spain, the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Two Sicilies]] and [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]], the dynasty eventually collapsed under its own weight.

Between the years 1852 and 1870 there was a [[Second French Empire]], again a member of the Bonaparte dynasty would rule; [[Napoleon III of France]] the son of [[Louis Bonaparte]]. However after tensions relating to Prussia, the dynasty was again ousted from the imperial throne. Since that time there has been a series of pretenders, supporters of the Bonaparte family's claim to the throne of France are known as [[Bonapartists]]. Current head [[Jean-Christophe Napoléon]] is ironically from a Bourbon mother.

==Bonaparte family==
The Bonaparte family were from minor [[Italian nobility]] who held most of their property in the hill town of [[San Miniato]] near [[Florence, Italy]]. The Bonapartes came from a [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] stock of [[Lombardy|Lombard]] origin. The name derives from [[Italian language|Italian]], ''bona'' (''buona'') &quot;good&quot; and ''parte'' &quot;solution&quot; or &quot;match&quot; (a name bestowed as an expression of satisfaction at a newborn’s arrival).

After settling in Florence the family enjoyed a relationship with the then ruling [[Medici]] family. [[Jacopo Bonaparte]] was a friend and advisor to [[Medici]] [[Pope Clement VII]]. Jacopo was also a witness to and wrote an account of the [[sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome]], which is one of the most important historical documents recounting that event.&lt;ref&gt;Jacopo Bonaparte: ''Sac de Rome''. Écrit EN 1527 par Jacques Bonaparte. Témoin oculaire, hrsgg. by Bonaparte, Napoléon Louis, Florenz 1850&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Jacopo's nephews, Pier-Antonio Bonaparte and Giovanni Bonaparte, however, took part in the 1527 Medici rebellion, after which they were banished from Florence and later were restored by [[Alessandro de' Medici]]. Jacopo's brother Benedetto Bonaparte maintained political neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua F. Drake]], ''The Part-books of a Florentine Ex-Patriate: new light on Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Ms. Magl. XIX 164–7'', [[Early Music]] (OUP), Vol. 33, no. 4 (Oct. 2005), pp. 639–646. [http://em.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/4/639]&lt;/ref&gt;

The family later separated into two branches: Bonaparte-Sarzana, ''Nobili di [[Sarzana]]'' had been compelled to leave Florence due to the defeat of the [[Ghibellines]] and later when [[Francesco Bonaparte]] came to Corsica in 16th century and the island was in [[Genoa|Genoese]] possession.

The Bonaparte tomb lies in the Church of San Francesco in San Miniato.

==Bonaparte arms==
[[Image:Buonaparte.svg|thumb|150px|left|The original coat of arms of the Bonaparte family.]]
The arms of the Bonaparte family were: ''Gules two bends sinister between two mullets or''. In 1804 Napoleon changed the arms to ''Azure an imperial eagle or''. The change applied to all members of his family except for his brother Lucien, and the son of Jerome's first marriage.

==Napoleon I==
[[Image:Jacques-Louis David 008.jpg|thumb|right|''General Bonaparte ''(1801), by Jacques-Louis David.]]

[[Napoleon I]] is the most prominent name associated with the Bonaparte family because he conquered much of the Western world during the early part of the 19th century. He was elected as first consul of France on November 10, 1799 with the help of his brother, [[Lucien Bonaparte]], and president of the [[Council of Five Hundred]] at [[Saint-Cloud]]. He was crowned [[Emperor]] of the French and ruled from 1804–1814, 1815.

Following his conquest of most of [[Western Europe]], the first Napoleon made his elder brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] (1768–1844) king first of [[Naples]] (1806–1808) and then of Spain (1808–1813), his third brother [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis]] (1778–1846) king of Holland (1806–1810) (subsequently forcing his abdication after his failure to subordinate Dutch interests to those of France) and his youngest brother [[Jérôme Bonaparte]] (1784–1860) king of [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]], the short-lived realm created from some of the states of northwestern Germany (1807–1813).

Napoleon's son [[Napoléon II of France|Napoleon François Charles Joseph]] (1811–1832) was created king of Rome (1811–1814) and was later styled Napoleon II by loyalists of the dynasty, though he only ruled for two weeks after his father's abdication. Charles Louis Napoléon (1808–1873), son of Louis Napoléon, was president of France in 1848–1852 and emperor in 1852–1870, reigning as [[Napoléon III of France|Napoléon III]]; his son, [[Eugène Bonaparte]] (1856–1879), styled the [[Prince Imperial]], died fighting the [[Zulu people|Zulu]]s in [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]], South Africa. With his death, the family lost much of its remaining political appeal, though claimants continue to assert their right to the imperial title. A political movement for Corsican independence surfaced in the 1990s which included a Bonapartist restoration in its programme.

==Current descendants==
The headship of the family is in dispute between [[Charles Napoléon]], born 1950, great-great-grandson of [[Jérôme Bonaparte]] by his second marriage; and his son [[Jean-Christophe Napoléon|Jean-Christophe]] (born 1986) who was appointed heir in the will of his grandfather [[Prince Louis Napoléon]]. The only other male member of the family is the brother of Charles, [[Jerome Xavier Bonaparte|Prince Jérôme]], (born 1957), unmarried. There are no remaining descendants in male line from any other of Napoleon's brothers. There are, however, numerous descendants of Napoleon's illegitimate, but recognized son [[Walewski]] from his union with [[Marie, Countess Walewski]]. Of these include the Wattier family and its union with the Bonaparte family. The later descendants were the Peschongs and Herrs. A descendant of Napoleon's sister Caroline Bonaparte is actor [[René Auberjonois (actor)|René Auberjonois]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''β sheet''' (also '''β-pleated sheet''') is the second form of regular [[secondary structure]] in [[protein]]s, only somewhat less common than [[alpha helix]].  Beta sheets consist of '''beta strands''' connected laterally by at least two or three backbone [[hydrogen bond]]s, forming a generally twisted, pleated sheet.  A beta strand (also '''β strand''') is a stretch of [[peptide|polypeptide]] chain typically 3 to 10 [[amino acid]]s long with backbone in an almost fully extended conformation.  The higher-level association of β sheets has been implicated in formation of the protein aggregates and fibrils observed in many human diseases, notably the [[amyloidosis|amyloidoses]] such as [[Alzheimer's disease]].

==Nomenclature==
In the most common usage, ''β strand'' refers to a single continuous stretch of amino acids adopting an extended conformation and involved in backbone [[hydrogen bond]]s to at least one other strand; by contrast, a ''β sheet'' refers to an ''assembly'' of at least two such β strands that are hydrogen-bonded (or ''H-bonded'') to each other.

==History==
The first β sheet structure was proposed by [[William Astbury]] in the 1930s.  He proposed the idea of hydrogen bonding between the [[peptide bond]]s of parallel or antiparallel extended β strands.  However, Astbury did not have the necessary data on the bond geometry of the amino acids in order to build accurate models, especially since he did not then know that the [[peptide bond]] was planar.  A refined version was proposed by [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Robert Corey]] in 1951.

===Geometry===
The majority of β strands are arranged adjacent to other strands and form an extensive [[hydrogen bond]] network with their neighbors in which the [[amine|N-H]] groups in the backbone of one strand establish [[hydrogen bond]]s with the [[carbonyl|C=O]] groups in the backbone of the adjacent strands. In the fully extended β strand, successive side chains point straight up, then straight down, then straight up, etc. Adjacent β strands in a β sheet are aligned so that their C&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; atoms are adjacent and their side chains point in the same direction.  The &quot;pleated&quot; appearance of β strands arises from tetrahedral chemical bonding at the C&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; atom; for example, if a side chain points straight up, then the bond to the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C^{\prime}}&lt;/math&gt; must point slightly downwards, since its bond angle is approximately 109.5°.  The pleating causes the distance between &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C^{\alpha}}_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C^{\alpha}_{i+2}}&lt;/math&gt; to be approximately 6 [[ångström|Å]], rather than the 7.6 Å (2 × 3.8 Å) expected from two fully extended [[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]] [[peptide bond|peptide]] [[virtual bond]]s.  The &quot;sideways&quot; distance between adjacent C&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; atoms in [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen-bonded]] β strands is roughly 5 Å 
[[Image:Ramachandran plot general 100K.jpg |thumb|left|200px| Ramachandran (φ,ψ) plot of about 100,000 high-resolution datapoints, showing the broad, favorable region around the conformation typical for β-sheet residues.]]
However, β strands are rarely perfectly extended; rather, they exhibit a twist due to the [[chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] of their component amino acids. The energetically preferred [[dihedral angle]]s near (φ, ψ) = (–135°, 135°) (broadly, the upper left region of the [[Ramachandran plot]]) diverge significantly from the fully extended conformation (φ, ψ) = (–180°, 180°).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biochemistry |last=Voet |first=Donald |authorlink= |coauthors=Voet, Judith G. |year=2004 |edition=3rd |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=047119350X |page= |pages=227–231 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The twist is often associated with alternating fluctuations in the [[dihedral angle]]s to prevent the individual β strands in a larger sheet from splaying apart.  A good example of a strongly twisted β-hairpin can be seen in the protein [[BPTI]].

The side chains point outwards from the folds of the pleats, roughly perpendicularly to the plane of the sheet; successive residues point outwards on alternating faces of the sheet.

===Hydrogen bonding patterns===
Because peptide chains have a directionality conferred by their [[N-terminal end|N-terminus]] and [[C-terminal end|C-terminus]], β strands too can be said to be directional.  They are usually represented in protein topology diagrams by an arrow pointing toward the C-terminus. Adjacent β strands can form [[hydrogen bond]]s in antiparallel, parallel, or mixed arrangements.

In an antiparallel arrangement, the successive β strands alternate directions so that the N-terminus of one strand is adjacent to the C-terminus of the next.  This is the arrangement that produces the strongest inter-strand stability because it allows the inter-strand hydrogen bonds between carbonyls and amines to be planar, which is their preferred orientation.  The peptide backbone dihedral angles (φ, ψ) are about (–140°, 135°) in antiparallel sheets.  In this case, if two atoms &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C^{\alpha}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C^{\alpha}_{j}}&lt;/math&gt; are adjacent in two [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen-bonded]] β strands, then they form two mutual backbone hydrogen bonds to each other's flanking [[peptide bond|peptide groups]]; this is known as a '''close pair''' of hydrogen bonds.

In a parallel arrangement, all of the N-termini of successive strands are oriented in the same direction; this orientation may be slightly less stable because it introduces nonplanarity in the inter-strand hydrogen bonding pattern.  The dihedral angles (φ, ψ) are about (–120°, 115°) in parallel sheets.  It is rare to find less than five interacting parallel strands in a motif, suggesting that a smaller number of strands may be unstable, however it is also fundamentally more difficult for parallel β-sheets to form because strands with N and C termini aligned necessarily must be very distant in sequence. There is also evidence that parallel β-sheet may be more stable since small amyloidogenic sequences appear to generally aggregate into β-sheet fibrils composed of primarily parallel β-sheet strands, where one would expect anti-parallel fibrils if anti-parallel was more stable.

In parallel β-sheet structure, if two atoms &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C^{\alpha}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C^{\alpha}_{j}}&lt;/math&gt; are adjacent in two [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen-bonded]] β strands, then they do ''not'' hydrogen bond to each other; rather, one residue forms hydrogen bonds to the residues that flank the other (but not vice versa).  For example, residue &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; may form hydrogen bonds to residues &lt;math&gt;j-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j+1&lt;/math&gt;; this is known as a ''wide pair'' of hydrogen bonds.  By contrast, residue &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; may hydrogen-bond to different residues altogether, or to none at all.

Finally, an individual strand may exhibit a mixed bonding pattern, with a parallel strand on one side and an antiparallel strand on the other. Such arrangements are less common than a random distribution of orientations would suggest, suggesting that this pattern is less stable than the anti-parallel arrangement, however bioinformatic analysis always struggles with extracting structural thermodynamics since there are always numerous other structural features present in whole proteins. Also proteins are inherently constrained by folding kinetics as well as folding thermodynamics, so one must always be careful in concluding stability from bioinformatic analysis.

The [[hydrogen bond]]ing of β strands need not be perfect, but can exhibit localized disruptions known as [[beta bulge]]s.

The hydrogen bonds lie roughly in the plane of the sheet, with the [[peptide bond|peptide]] [[carbonyl]] groups pointing in alternating directions with successive residues; for comparison, successive carbonyls point in the ''same'' direction in the [[alpha helix]].

===Amino acid propensities===
Large aromatic residues (Tyr, Phe and Trp) and β-branched amino acids (Thr, Val, Ile) are favored to be found in β strands in the ''middle'' of β sheets.  Interestingly, different types of residues (such as Pro) are likely to be found in the ''edge'' strands in β sheets, presumably to avoid the &quot;edge-to-edge&quot; association between proteins that might lead to [[aggregation]] and [[amyloid]] formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Richardson, J.S., and Richardson, D.C. |year= 2002 |title=Natural β-Sheet Proteins Use Negative Design to Avoid Edge-to-Edge Aggregation |journal=Proc.

==Common structural motifs==
[[Image:Beta hairpin.png|thumb|right|130px|Representation of a [[beta hairpin]]]]
[[Image:Anthrax toxin protein key motif.svg|left|thumb|200px|Greek-key motif in protein structure.]]
A very simple [[structural motif]] involving β sheets is the [[beta hairpin|β hairpin]], in which two antiparallel strands are linked by a short loop of two to five residues, of which one is frequently a [[glycine]] or a [[proline]], both of which can assume the unusual dihedral-angle conformations required for a tight [[turn (biochemistry)|turn]]. However, individual strands can also be linked in more elaborate ways with long loops that may contain [[alpha helix|alpha helices]] or even entire protein domains.

===Greek key motif===
The Greek key motif consists of four adjacent antiparallel strands and their linking loops. It consists of three antiparallel strands connected by hairpins, while the fourth is adjacent to the first and linked to the third by a longer loop. This type of structure forms easily during the protein folding process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://swissmodel.expasy.org/course/text/chapter4.htm Tertiary Protein Structure and Folds: section 4.3.2.1]. From [http://swissmodel.expasy.org/course/ Principles of Protein Structure, Comparative Protein Modelling, and Visualisation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8506258&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hutchinson EG, Thornton JM | title = The Greek key motif: extraction, classification and analysis | journal = Protein Eng. | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 233–45 | year = 1993 | month = April | pmid = 8506258 | doi = 10.1093/protein/6.3.233 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after a pattern common to Greek ornamental artwork (see [[meander (art)]]).


===The β-&amp;alpha;-β motif===
Due to the chirality of their component amino acids, all strands exhibit a &quot;right-handed&quot; twist evident in most higher-order β sheet structures. In particular, the linking loop between two parallel strands almost always has a right-handed crossover chirality, which is strongly favored by the inherent twist of the sheet. This linking loop frequently contains a helical region, in which case it is called a [[beta-alpha-beta|β-α-β]] motif. A closely related motif called a β-α-β-α motif forms the basic component of the most commonly observed protein [[tertiary structure]], the [[TIM barrel]].

===β-meander motif===
A simple [[structural motif|supersecondary]] protein topology composed of 2 or more consecutive antiparallel β-strands linked together by [[beta hairpin|hairpin]] loops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/data/scop.b.c.bbf.html SCOP: Fold: WW domain-like&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/PPS2/course/section9/sss/super2.html PPS '96 - Super Secondary Structure&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  This motif is common in β-sheets and can be found in several structural architectures including [[beta barrel|β-barrels]] and [[beta propeller|β-propellers]].

===Psi-loop motif===
The psi-loop, Ψ-loop, motif consists of two antiparallel strands with one strand in between that is connected to both by hydrogen bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hutchinson |first=E. |authorlink= |coauthors=Thornton, J. |year=1996 |month= |title=PROMOTIF—A program to identify and analyze structural motifs in proteins |journal=Protein Science |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=212–220 |pmid=8745398 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmc=2143354 |doi=10.1002/pro.5560050204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are four possible strand topologies for single Ψ-loops as cited by Hutchinson ''et al.'' (1990).  This motif is rare as the process resulting in its formation seems unlikely to occur during protein folding. The Ψ-loop was first identified in the [[aspartic acid protease|aspartic protease]] family.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2281084&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hutchinson EG, Thornton JM | title = HERA--a program to draw schematic diagrams of protein secondary structures | journal = Proteins | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 203–12 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2281084 | doi = 10.1002/prot.340080303 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural architectures of proteins with beta-sheets==
Beta-sheets are present in [[All-β proteins|all-β]], [[Α+β proteins|α+β]] and [[Α/β proteins|α/β]] domains according to [http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/ Structural Classification of Proteins] and in many [[peptide]]s or small proteins with poorly defined overall architecture.  [[All-β proteins|All-β domains]] may form [[beta barrel|β barrels]], [[beta sandwich|β sandwiches]], [[beta prism|β prisms]], [[Beta-propeller domain|β propellers]], and [[Beta helix|β-helices]].

==Structural topology==
The '''topology''' of a β sheet describes the order of [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen-bonded]] β strands along the backbone. For example, the [[flavodoxin fold]] has a five-stranded, parallel β sheet with topology 21345; thus, the edge strands are β strand 2 and β strand 5 along the backbone.  Spelled out explicitly, β strand 2 is H-bonded to β strand 1, which is H-bonded to β strand 3, which is H-bonded to β strand 4, which is H-bonded to β strand 5, the other edge strand. In the same system, the Greek key motif described above has a 4123 topology.  The [[secondary structure]] of a β sheet can be described roughly by giving the number of strands, their topology, and whether their [[hydrogen bond]]s are parallel or antiparallel.

β sheets can be ''open'', meaning that they have two edge strands (as in the [[flavodoxin fold]] or the [[immunoglobulin fold]]) or they can be ''closed [[beta-barrel|beta barrel]]s'' (such as the [[TIM barrel]]).  [[beta-barrel|β-Barrels]] are often described by their ''stagger'' or ''shear''.  Some open β sheets are very curved and fold over on themselves (as in the [[SH3 domain]]) or form horseshoe shapes (as in the [[ribonuclease inhibitor]]).  Open β sheets can assemble face-to-face (such as the [[beta-propeller domain]] or [[immunoglobulin fold]]) or edge-to-edge, forming one big β sheet.
== Dynamic features==

Beta-sheets in proteins may carry out [[low-frequency collective motion in proteins and DNA|low-frequency]] accordion-like motion as observed by the [[Raman spectroscopy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7115900&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Painter PC, Mosher LE, Rhoads C | title = Low-frequency modes in the Raman spectra of proteins | journal = Biopolymers | volume = 21 | issue = 7 | pages = 1469–72 | year = 1982 | month = July | pmid = 7115900 | doi = 10.1002/bip.360210715 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and analyzed with the quasi-continuum model.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid4052563&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chou KC | title = Low-frequency motions in protein molecules.

==Parallel β helices==
[[Image:1QRE_L3betaHelix.jpg |thumb|right|200px| End-view ribbon schematic of a 3-sided, lefthanded β helix protein (PDB file 1QRE).]]
A [[beta helix|β helix]] is formed from repeating structural units consisting of two or three short β strands linked by short loops. These units &quot;stack&quot; atop one another in a helical fashion so that successive repetitions of the same strand hydrogen-bond with each other in a parallel orientation. See the [[beta helix]] article for further information.&lt;br&gt;
In lefthanded β helices, the strands themselves are quite straight and untwisted; the resulting helical surfaces are nearly flat, forming a regular [[triangular prism]] shape, as shown for the 1QRE archaeal carbonic anhydrase at right. Other examples are the lipid A synthesis enzyme [[LpxA]] and insect antifreeze proteins with a regular array of Thr sidechains on one face that mimic the structure of ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liou, Y.C. et al.|title=Mimicry of ice structure by surface hydroxyls and water of a beta-helix antifreeze protein |journal=Nature |year=2000|volume=406|pages=322–324|doi= 10.1038/35018604 |pmid=10917536 |issue=6793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Pectate_lyase_R3betaHelix.jpg |thumb|left|200px| End-view ribbon schematic of a 3-sided, righthanded β helix protein (PDB file 2PEC).]]
Righthanded β helices, typified by the [[pectate lyase]] enzyme shown at left or [[P22 phage]] tailspike protein, have a less regular cross-section, longer and indented on one of the sides; of the three linker loops, one is consistently just two residues long and the others are variable, often elaborated to form a binding or active site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Protein Structure |last=Branden |first=Carl |authorlink= |coauthors=Tooze, John |year=1999 |publisher=Garland |location=New York |isbn=0815323050 |pages=20–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
A two-sided β helix (right-handed) is found in some bacterial [[metalloprotease]]s; its two loops are each six residues long and bind stabilizing calcium ions to maintain the integrity of the structure, using the backbone and the Asp side chain oxygens of a GGXGXD sequence motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bauman, U. et al.| title=Three-dimensional structure of the alkaline protease of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: a two-domain protein with a calcium binding parallel beta roll motif| journal=EMBO Journal |year=1993|volume=12|pages=3357–3364 |pmid=8253063 |issue=9 |pmc=413609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fold is called a beta-roll in the SCOP classification.&lt;br&gt;

==β sheets in pathology==
Some proteins that are disordered or helical as monomers, such as amyloid β (see [[amyloid plaque]]) can form β-sheet-rich oligomeric structures associated with pathological states.  The amyloid β protein's oligomeric form is implicated as a cause of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]].  Its structure has yet to be determined in full, but recent data suggest that it may resemble an unusual two-strand β helix.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15944695&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nelson R, Sawaya MR, Balbirnie M, Madsen AØ, Riekel C, Grothe R, Eisenberg D | title = Structure of the cross-beta spine of amyloid-like fibrils | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7043 | pages = 773–8 | year = 2005 | month = June | pmid = 15944695 | pmc = 1479801 | doi = 10.1038/nature03680 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The side chains from the amino acid residues found in a β sheet structure may also be arranged such that many of the adjacent sidechains on one side of the sheet are hydrophobic, while many of those adjacent to each other on the alternate side of the sheet are polar or charged (hydrophilic),&lt;ref&gt;SHUGUANG ZHANG, TODD HOLME, CURTIS LOCKSHIN, AND ALEXANDER RICH. PNAS April 15, 1993 vol. 90 no. 8 3334-3338&lt;/ref&gt; which can be useful if the sheet is to form a boundary between polar/watery and nonpolar/greasy environments.

The [[mineral]] '''beryl''' is a [[beryllium]] [[aluminium]] [[Silicate minerals#Cyclosilicates|cyclosilicate]] with the [[chemical formula]] Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;nowiki&gt;SiO&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] [[crystal]]s of beryl may be very small or range to several meters in size. Terminated crystals are relatively rare. Pure beryl is colorless, but it is frequently tinted by impurities; possible colors are green, blue, yellow, red, and white.

==Etymology==
The name beryl is derived (via [[Latin]]: ''beryllus'', [[Old French]]: ''beryl'', and [[Middle English]]: beril) from [[Greek language|Greek]] βήρυλλος ''beryllos'' which referred to a &quot;precious blue-green color-of-sea-water stone&quot;&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt; and originated from [[Prakrit]] veruliya (वॆरुलिय‌) and [[Pali]] veḷuriya (वेलुरिय); veḷiru (भेलिरु) or, viḷar (भिलर्), &quot;to become pale&quot;; ultimately from [[Sanskrit]] वैडूर्य vaidurya-, which is of [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] origin, maybe from the name of [[Belur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=beryl Beryl], Online Etymology Dictionary. Retrieved on 2011-04-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later adopted for the mineral beryl more exclusively.&lt;ref name=Webmineral/&gt; The Late Latin word ''berillus'' was abbreviated as ''brill-'' which produced the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''brillare'' meaning &quot;shine&quot;, the [[French language|French]] word ''brille'' meaning &quot;shine&quot; and the [[English language|English]] word ''brilliance.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soul-hunter.com/sailormoon/myth/beryl.php the oracle :: bssm encyclopaedia]. Soul-hunter.com. Retrieved on 2011-04-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deposits==
Beryl of various colors is found most commonly in [[granite|granitic]] [[pegmatite]]s, but also occurs in [[mica]] [[schist]]s in the [[Urals|Ural Mountains]], and [[limestone]] in [[Colombia]]. Beryl is often associated with [[tin]] and [[tungsten]] ore bodies. Beryl is found in [[Europe]] in [[Norway]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]] (especially morganite), and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], as well as [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]], [[Russia]], [[South Africa]], the [[United States]], and [[Zambia]]. U.S. beryl locations are in [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Idaho]], [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Dakota]] and [[Utah]].

[[New England]]'s [[pegmatites]] have produced some of the largest beryls found, including one massive crystal from the [[Bumpus Quarry]] in [[Albany, Maine]] with dimensions 5.5 m by 1.2 m (18&amp;nbsp;ft by 4&amp;nbsp;ft) with a mass of around 18 [[Tonne|metric tons]]; it is New Hampshire's state mineral. As of 1999, the largest known crystal of any mineral in the world is a crystal of beryl from Madagascar, 18 meters long and 3.5 meters in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;G. Cressey and I. F. Mercer, ''Crystals'', London, Natural History Museum, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
===Aquamarine and maxixe===
[[File:AguamarinhaEZ.jpg|left|Aquamarine|thumb]]
Aquamarine (from {{lang-la|aqua marina}}, &quot;water of the sea&quot;) is a blue or [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]] variety of beryl. It occurs at most localities which yield ordinary beryl, some of the finest coming from [[Russia]]. The gem-gravel [[Placer mining|placer]] deposits of [[Sri Lanka]] contain aquamarine. Clear yellow beryl, such as that occurring in [[Brazil]], is sometimes called '''aquamarine chrysolite'''. When [[corundum]] presents the bluish tint of typical aquamarine, it is often termed Oriental aquamarine. The deep blue version of aquamarine is called ''maxixe''. Its color fades to white when exposed to sunlight or is subjected to heat treatment, though the color returns with irradiation. 

The pale blue color of aquamarine is attributed to Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions produce golden-yellow color, and when both Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; are present, the color is a darker blue as in maxixe. Decoloration of maxixe by light or heat thus may be due to the charge transfer Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=color&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.caltech.edu/FILES/Visible/BERYL/Index.htm| title = Color in the Beryl group| accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ibragim&gt;{{cite journal| doi =10.1134/S0020168509020101| title =Correlations between admixtures and color centers created upon irradiation of natural beryl crystals| year =2009| author =Ibragimova, E.

In the [[United States]], aquamarines can be found at the summit of [[Mount Antero|Mt. Antero]] in the [[Sawatch Range]] in central [[Colorado]]. In [[Wyoming]], aquamarine has been discovered in the [[Big Horn Mountains]], near [[Powder River]] Pass. In [[Brazil]], there are mines in the states of [[Minas Gerais]], [[Espírito Santo]], and [[Bahia]], and minorly in [[Rio Grande do Norte]]. The Mines of [[Colombia]], [[Zambia]], [[Madagascar]], [[Malawi]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]] also produce aquamarine.

The biggest aquamarine ever mined was found at the city of Marambaia, Minas Gerais, Brazil, in 1910. It weighed over 110&amp;nbsp;kg, and its dimensions were {{convert|48.5|cm|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|42|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter.

A trapiche emerald exhibits a &quot;star&quot; pattern; it has raylike spokes of dark carbon impurities that give the emerald a [[Asterism (gemmology)|six-pointed radial pattern]]. It is named for the ''trapiche'', a grinding wheel used to process [[sugarcane]] in the region. Colombian emeralds are generally the most prized due to their transparency and fire. Some of the most rare emeralds come from three main emerald mining areas in Colombia: Muzo, Coscuez, and Chivor. Fine emeralds are also found in other countries, such as [[Zambia]], [[Brazil]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Madagascar]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Russia]]. In the US, emeralds can be found in [[Hiddenite, North Carolina]]. In 1998, emeralds were discovered in the [[Yukon]].

Emerald is a rare and valuable gemstone and, as such, it has provided the [[incentive]] for developing synthetic emeralds. Both hydrothermal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi =10.1016/0960-8974(91)90008-Z| title =Hydrothermal growth of gem stones and their characterization| year =1991| author =Hosaka, M| journal =Progress in Crystal Growth and Characterization of Materials| volume =21| page =71}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''flux-growth'' synthetics have been produced. The first commercially successful emerald synthesis process was that of Carroll Chatham. The other large producer of flux emeralds was Pierre Gilson Sr., which has been on the market since 1964. Gilson's emeralds are usually grown on natural colorless beryl seeds which become coated on both sides. Growth occurs at the rate of 1&amp;nbsp;mm per month, a typical seven-month growth run producing emerald crystals of 7&amp;nbsp;mm of thickness.&lt;ref&gt;Nassau, K., 1980, ''Gems Made By Man,'' Gemological Institute of America, ISBN 0873110161&lt;/ref&gt; The green color of emeralds is attributed to presence of Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.&lt;ref name=ibragim/&gt;&lt;ref name=viana1/&gt;&lt;ref name=blak/&gt;

===Golden beryl and heliodor===
[[File:Pierre-img 0591.jpg|thumb|Golden beryl]]

''Golden beryl'' can range in colors from pale yellow to a brilliant gold. Unlike [[emerald]], golden beryl has very few flaws. The term &quot;golden beryl&quot; is sometimes synonymous with ''heliodor'' (from Greek ''hēlios – ἥλιος'' &quot;sun&quot; + ''dōron – δῶρον'' &quot;gift&quot;) but golden beryl refers to pure yellow or golden yellow shades, while heliodor refers to the greenish-yellow shades. The golden yellow color is attributed to Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.&lt;ref name=color/&gt;&lt;ref name=ibragim/&gt; Both golden beryl and heliodor are used as gems. Probably the largest cut golden beryl is the flawless 2054 [[Carat (unit)|carat]] stone on display in the [[National Museum of Natural History#Hall of Geology, Gems, and Minerals|Hall of Gems]], [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page=77|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MPZK8ILOSR0C&amp;pg=PA77| title = Gemstones| author = Arthur Thomas| publisher = New Holland Publishers| isbn = 1845376021| year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goshenite===
[[File:Zrost beryli, Namibia3.jpg|thumb|left|Goshenite]]
Colorless beryl is called ''goshenite''. The name originates from [[Goshen, Massachusetts]] where it was originally discovered. Since all these color varieties are caused by impurities and pure beryl is colorless, it might be tempting to assume that goshenite is the purest variety of beryl. However, there are several elements that can act as inhibitors to color in beryl and so this assumption may not always be true. The name goshenite has been said to be on its way to extinction and yet it is still commonly used in the gemstone markets. Goshenite is found to some extent in almost all beryl localities. In the past, goshenite was used for manufacturing eyeglasses and lenses owing to its transparency. Nowadays, it is most commonly used for gemstone purposes and also considered as a source of beryllium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galleries.com/minerals/gemstone/goshenit/goshenit.htm| title = Goshenite, the colorless variety of beryl| accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opticalmineralogy.com/the-silicates-mineral-class/goshenite-gem/| title = Goshenite gem| accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gem value of goshenite is relatively low. However, goshenite can be colored yellow, green, pink, blue and in intermediate colors by irradiating it with high-energy particles. The resulting color depends on the content of Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Fe, and Co impurities.&lt;ref name=ibragim/&gt;

===Morganite===
[[File:Morganite (Brésil).jpg|100px|thumb|Morganite]]
Morganite, also known as &quot;pink beryl&quot;, &quot;rose beryl&quot;, &quot;pink emerald&quot;, and &quot;cesian beryl&quot;, is a rare light pink to rose-colored [[Gemstone|gem]]-quality variety of beryl. Orange/yellow varieties of morganite can also be found, and color banding is common. It can be routinely heat treated to remove patches of yellow and is occasionally treated by irradiation to improve its color. The pink color of morganite is attributed to Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.&lt;ref name=color/&gt;
 
Pink beryl of fine color and good sizes was first discovered on an island on the coast of Madagascar in 1910.&lt;ref name=&quot;query.nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E0DE4DD1339E433A25755C0A9649D946196D6CF | work=The New York Times | title=GEM NAMED FOR MORGAN.; Newly Discovered Pink Beryl Is to be Known as Morganite | date=1910-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also known, with other gemstone minerals, such as [[tourmaline]] and [[kunzite]], at [[Pala, California]]. In December 1910,the New York Academy of Sciences named the pink variety of beryl &quot;morganite&quot; after financier [[J. P. Morgan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;query.nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;

On October 7, 1989, one of the largest gem morganite specimens ever uncovered, eventually called &quot;The Rose of Maine,&quot; was found at the Bennett Quarry in Buckfield, [[Maine]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3672/is_/ai_n8728364 Mineralogy of the Bennett pegmatite, Oxford County, Maine], article, Citation of discovered and destruction of the Rose of Maine (see bottom paragraph of first page)&lt;/ref&gt; The crystal, originally somewhat orange in hue, was {{convert|23|cm|0|abbr=on}} long and about {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}} across, and weighed (along with its matrix) just over 50&amp;nbsp;lbs (23&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;[http://maine.gov/doc/nrimc/mgs/explore/minerals/guide/chapter5/bennett-3.htm The Rose of Maine], image, The Rose of Maine at the site of its discovery&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beryl-tu03b.jpg|left|thumb|Red beryl]]

===Red beryl===

Red beryl (also known as &quot;red emerald&quot; or &quot;scarlet emerald&quot;) is a red variety of beryl. It was first described in 1904 for an occurrence, its [[Type locality (geology)|type locality]], at Maynard's Claim (Pismire Knolls), Thomas Range, [[Juab County, Utah|Juab County]], Utah, USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-690.html MinDat – Red beryl]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.utah.gov/surveynotes/gladasked/gladberyl.htm Carl Ege, Utah Geological Survey]&lt;/ref&gt; The old synonym bixbite is deprecated from the [[CIBJO]], because of the risk of confusion with the mineral [[bixbyite]] (also named after the mineralogist [[Maynard Bixby]]). The dark red color of bixbite is attributed to Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.&lt;ref name=color/&gt;

Red beryl is very rare and has only been reported from a handful of locations including: [[Wah Wah Mountains]], [[Beaver County, Utah]]; [[Black Range|Paramount Canyon]], [[Sierra County, New Mexico]]; [[Black Range|Round Mountain]], [[Sierra County, New Mexico]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Mindat&quot;&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-690.html Mindat Red Beryl Page]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Juab County, Utah]]. The greatest concentration of gem-grade red beryl comes from the Violet Claim in the Wah Wah Mountains of mid-western Utah, discovered in 1958 by Lamar Hodges, of [[Fillmore, Utah]], while he was prospecting for [[uranium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Red Emerald History | url=http://www.redemerald.com/history.html | date=2007-11-21 | accessdate=2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prices for top quality natural red beryl can be as high as $10,000 per carat for faceted stones. Red beryl has been known to be confused with [[pezzottaite]], also known as raspberry beryl or &quot;raspberyl&quot;, a gemstone that has been found in Madagascar and now Afghanistan – although cut gems of the two varieties can be distinguished from their difference in [[refractive index]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gemstoneslist.com/bixbite.html &quot;Bixbite&quot; – The Gemstone List]&lt;/ref&gt; 

While gem beryls are ordinarily found in pegmatites and certain metamorphic rocks, bixbite occurs in [[topaz]]-bearing [[rhyolite]]s. It formed by crystallizing under low pressure and high temperature from a pneumatolitic phase along fractures or within near-surface [[miarolitic cavities]] of the rhyolite. Associated minerals include [[bixbyite]], [[quartz]], [[orthoclase]], [[topaz]], [[spessartine]], [[pseudobrookite]] and [[hematite]]. The red color is thought to be from [[manganese]] substituting for [[aluminium]] in the beryl structure.

Located in northwest Switzerland on the river [[Rhine]], Basel functions as a major industrial centre for the chemical and [[pharmaceutical industry]]. The Basel region, culturally extending into German [[Baden-Württemberg]] and French [[Alsace]], reflects the heritage of its three [[Sovereign state|state]]s in the [[New Latin|modern Latin]] name: &quot;Regio TriRhena&quot;. It has the oldest [[University of Basel|university]] of the Swiss Confederation (1460). Basel is [[German language|German-speaking]]. The local variant of the [[Swiss German]] dialects is called [[Basel German]].

Basel is among the most important cultural centres of Switzerland. The city comprises a large number of theatres and [[Museums in Basel|many museums]], including the [[Kunstmuseum Basel|Museum of Fine Arts]], the world's oldest art collection accessible to the public. In addition the [[Theater Basel]] was chosen in 1999 as the best stage for German-language performances and in 2009 &amp; 2010 as &quot;Opera of the Year&quot; by German Opera Magazine &quot;Opernwelt&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basel-virtuell.ch/en/culture Basel: culture pure] basel-virtuell.ch.

==History==
===Early history===
During the days of the [[Roman Empire]], the settlement of [[Augusta Raurica]] was founded 10 or 20 kilometres upstream of present Basel, and a castle was built on the hill overlooking the river where the Basel Münster now stands. But even older [[Celts|Celt]]ic settlements (including a [[vitrified fort]]) have been discovered recently in the area predating the Roman castle. The city's position on the [[Rhine]] long emphasised its importance: Basel for many centuries possessed the only bridge over the river &quot;between [[Lake Constance]] and the sea&quot;{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}.

The town of Basel was called ''Basilea'' or ''Basilia'' in [[Latin]] (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''Basileia'', ''Βασιλεια'' meaning ''kingship'') and this name is documented from 374 AD.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia Americana'', Grolier Incorporated 1999, p.308,&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the donation of the Abbey Moutier-Grandvalto and all its possessions to Bishop Adalbero II in 999 till the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], Basel was ruled by [[Prince-Bishop|prince-bishop]]s (see [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Basel|Bishop of Basel]],&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopaedia Britannica'', [[Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopaedia Britannica]], 1993, p.659&lt;/ref&gt; whose memory is preserved in the [[crosier]] shown on the Basel [[coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] – see above).

===Prince-Bishopric of Basel===
{{main| Prince-Bishopric of Basel }}
In 1019 the construction of the cathedral of Basel (known locally as the ''Münster'') began under [[List of German monarchs|German Emperor]] [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Heinrich II]].&lt;ref&gt;Franz Kugler, ''[[Kleine Schriften]] und Studien zur Kunstgeschichte'', 1853, p. 486&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1225–1226 the Bridge over the Rhine was constructed by [[Bishop]] Heinrich von Thun and lesser Basel (Kleinbasel) founded as a beachhead to protect the bridge.

In 1356 the [[1356 Basel earthquake|Basel earthquake]] destroyed much of the city along with a [[Rötteln Castle|number of castles]] in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.

In 1412 (or earlier) the well-known guesthouse ''Zum Goldenen Sternen'' was established.
Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century [[Council of Florence|Council of Basel]] (1431–1449), including the 1439 election of [[antipope]] [[Antipope Felix V|Felix V]].
In 1459 Pope [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]] endowed the [[University of Basel]] where such notables as [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] of [[Rotterdam]] and [[Paracelsus]] later taught. At the same time the new craft of [[printing press|printing]] was [[Global spread of the printing press|introduced to Basel]] by apprentices of [[Johann Gutenberg]].

The Schwabe publishing house was founded in 1488 by Johannes Petri and is the oldest publishing house still in business. [[Johann Froben]] also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus.&lt;ref&gt;Josef Nadler, ''Literaturgeschichte der deutschen Schweiz'', Grethlein 1932&lt;/ref&gt; In 1495, Basel was incorporated in the Upper Rhenish [[Imperial Circle]]; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes. In 1500 the construction of the [[Basel Münster]] was finished.

===As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy===
[[File:Merian Basel 1642.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Map of Basel in 1642.]]
In 1501 Basel joined the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederation]] as its eleventh canton,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Strupp, ''Wörterbuch Des Völkerrechts'', De Gruyter 1960, p.225&lt;/ref&gt; separating ''de facto''  from the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and began the construction of the city council building. The bishop's seat remained in Basel until 1529, when the city became Protestant under [[Johannes Oecolampadius|Oecolampadius]]. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms.  The first edition of ''Christianae religionis institutio'' (''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'' – [[John Calvin]]'s great exposition of [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Rudolph Elton, Harold Fullard, Henry Clifford Darby, Charles Loch Mowat, ''[[The New Cambridge Modern History]]'', 1990, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1543 ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'', the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by [[Andreas Vesalius]] (1514–1564).&lt;ref&gt;''The Illustrations from the Works of Andreas Vesalius of Brussels'', Courier Dover Publications 1973, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

There are indications [[Joachim Meyer]], author of the influential 16th century [[martial arts]] text ''Kunst des Fechten'' (&quot;The Art of Fencing&quot;) came from Basel. In 1662 the ''Amerbaschsches Kabinett'' was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.

===Modern history===
In 1792 the [[Rauracian Republic|Republic of Rauracia]], a revolutionary [[French client republic]], was created. It lasted until 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Zschokke, Emil Zschokke, ''The History of Switzerland, for the Swiss People'', S. Low, Son &amp; Co. 1855, p.253&lt;/ref&gt; After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of Basel-Landschaft.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Türler, Marcel Godet, Victor Attinger, ''Historisch-biographisches Lexikon der Schweiz'', 1934, p.307&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 1874 Switzerland's first zoo (the [[Zoo Basel]]) opened its doors in the south of the city towards [[Binningen]].

==Basel as international meeting place==
Basel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The [[Treaty of Basel (1499)]] ended the [[Swabian War]]. Two years later Basel joined the [[Switzerland|Swiss Confederation]]. The [[Peace of Basel]] in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the [[First Coalition]] against France during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. In more recent times, the [[World Zionist Organization]] held its first congress in Basel on September 3, 1897. Because of the [[Balkan Wars]], the [[Second International]] held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the [[Basel Convention]] was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of [[hazardous waste]] from wealthy to [[developing country|developing nations]] for disposal.

==Geography==
Basel has an area, {{as of|2009|lc=on}}, of {{km2 to mi2|23.91}}.  Of this area, {{km2 to mi2|0.95|abbr=yes}} or 4.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while {{km2 to mi2|0.88|abbr=yes}} or 3.7% is forested.

==Transportation==
Basel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of [[continental Europe]] from [[North Sea|the North Sea]] by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transportation of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.

===Port===
[[File:Rhine Rhein Basel 2006 871.JPG|thumb|200px|The [[Rhine]] in Basel]]
Basel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the [[Rhine]] and connect to ocean-going ships at the port of [[Rotterdam]].

===Air transport===
[[EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg]] is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland. Contrary to popular belief, the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; there was a customs point at the middle of the airport so that people could &quot;emigrate&quot; to the other side of the airport.

===Railway===
[[File:Basle Bahnhof Trainstation Switzerland.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Basel SBB railway station|Basel Bahnhof SBB]], self proclaimed &quot;world's first international train station.&quot;]]
Basel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations — those of the German, French and Swiss networks — lie within the city (although the Swiss ([[Basel SBB railway station|Basel SBB]]) and French ([[Basel SBB railway station|Bâle SNCF]]) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). [[Basel Badischer Bahnhof]] is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the [[Basel Regional S-Bahn]]. The largest goods railway complex of the country {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the [[LGV Est|TGV-Est]] line, opened in June 2007, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to 3½ hours. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Roads===
Basel is located on the [[A3 motorway (Switzerland)|A3 motorway]].

Within the city limits, five bridges connect greater and lesser Basel, from upstream to downstream:
* Schwarzwaldbrücke (built 1972)
* Wettsteinbrücke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)
* Mittlere Brücke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)
* Johanniterbrücke (built 1967)
* Dreirosenbrücke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)

===Ferries===
A somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of ferry boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of 20 or 30 metres. To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45° from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.

===Public transport===
[[File:Basel - Straßenbahn - Netzplan 2009.png|thumb|Basel tram network]]
[[File:Basel tram summer 2008.JPG|thumb|Basel tram]]
Basel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large [[Basel Trams|tram network]]. The green-colored local [[light rail|trams]] and buses are operated by the BVB ([http://www.bvb-basel.ch/ Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe]). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the BLT [[Baselland Transport]], and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The trams are powered by [[overhead lines]], and the bus fleet consists of conventional fuel-powered vehicles. (Most buses are natural gas powered) The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring [[Alsace]] region in [[France]] and [[Baden]] region in [[Germany]]. The [[Basel Regional S-Bahn]], the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by [[SBB]], [[SNCF]] and [[DB]].

===Border crossings===
Basel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland and has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the [[Schengen Area]] on December 12, 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join [[European Union|the EU]] customs regime and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.

:According to the BIS, &quot;The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/about/origins.htm|title=Origins|publisher=Bank for International Settlements|accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The red sandstone [[Basel Münster|Münster]], one of the foremost late-Romanesque/early Gothic buildings in the Upper Rhine, was badly damaged in the great earthquake of 1356, rebuilt in the fourteenth and 15th century, extensively reconstructed in the mid-nineteenth century and further restored in the late twentieth century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} A memorial to [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] lies inside the Münster. The City Hall from the 16th century is located on the Market Square and is decorated with fine murals on the outer walls and on the walls of the inner court.

Basel is also host to an array of buildings by internationally renowned architects. These include the [[Beyeler Foundation]] by [[Renzo Piano]], or the [[Vitra (furniture)|Vitra]] complex in nearby Weil am Rhein, composed of buildings by architects such as [[Zaha Hadid]] (fire station), [[Frank Gehry]] ([[Vitra Design Museum|design museum]]), [[Álvaro Siza Vieira|Alvaro Siza Vieira]] (factory building) and [[Tadao Ando]] (conference centre). Basel also features buildings by [[Mario Botta]] (Jean Tinguely Museum and Bank of International settlements) and [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]] (whose architectural practice is in Basel, and who are best known as the architects of [[Tate Modern]] in London). The city received the [[Wakker Prize]] in 1996.

==Energy==
Basel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve [[energy|energy use]] in Switzerland by 2050. In order to research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a '[[2000-watt society|2000 Watt society]]', a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These including demonstration buildings constructed to ''[[Minergie|MINERGIE]]'' or ''[[Passive house|Passivhaus]]'' standards, [[electricity]] generation from [[renewable energy]] sources,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/front/detail/swissinfo.html?siteSect=105&amp;sid=7407138 Geothermal project shakes Basel again]&lt;/ref&gt; and vehicles using [[natural gas]], [[hydrogen economy|hydrogen]] and [[biogas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basel.ch/en/basel/urban_development/2000_watt_society The Basel pilot region of the 2000 Watt Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:La Suisse secourant Strasbourg.JPG|thumb|right|200px|&quot;Switzerland protecting Strasbourg&quot; by [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi|Bartoldi]]]]
Basel has a thriving cultural life. (In 1997, it contended to become the &quot;[[European Capital of Culture]]&quot;, though the honor went instead to [[Thessaloniki]]) Basel is the home of the [[Schola Cantorum Basiliensis]], founded in 1933, a worldwide centre for research on and performance of music from the Medieval through the Baroque eras. [[Theater Basel]] presents a busy schedule of [[play (theatre)|play]]s in addition to being home to the city's [[opera]] and [[ballet]] companies.  Basel is home to the largest orchestra in Switzerland, the [[Sinfonieorchester Basel]]. It is also  the home of the Kammerorchester Basel, which is recording the complete symphonies of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] for the [[Sony]] label led by its music director [[Giovanni Antonini]]. The baroque orchestras La Cetra and Capriccio Basel are also based in Basel. In May 2004, the fifth [[European Festival of Youth Choirs]] (Europäisches Jugendchorfestival, or EJCF) choir festival opened: this Basel tradition started in 1992. Host of this festival is the local [[Basel Boys Choir]].

===Events===
The [[carnival]] of the city of Basel (''[[Carnival of Basel|Basler Fasnacht]]'') is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, despite the fact that it starts at four in the morning (''Morgestraich'') and lasts for exactly 72 hours, taking in various parades. Basel is also host to the [[Basel Tattoo]] and a number of fairs.

===Media===
''[[Basler Zeitung]]'' (&quot;Baz&quot;) is the local newspaper.

===Cuisine===
There are a number of culinary specialties originating in Basel, including ''[[Basler Läckerli]]'' cookies and ''[[Mässmogge]]'' candies.

===Zoo===
[[File:ZolliAntelopeHouse2.JPG|200px|thumb|left|the [[Antelope]] House at [[Zoo Basel]]]]
''[[Zoo Basel]]'' is, with nearly 1.7 million visitors per year, the most visited tourist attraction in Basel and the second most visited tourist attraction with a fee in Switzerland.&lt;ref name=&quot;visitors&quot;&gt;[http://www.20min.ch/news/basel/story/25637966 {{De icon}} Zolli beliebt]. [[20 Minuten|20min.ch]], published 2009-2-23&lt;/ref&gt;  

Established in 1874, Zoo Basel is Switzerland's oldest and, by animals, largest zoo in Switzerland. Through its history, Zoo Basel has had several breeding successes, such as the first worldwide [[Indian rhinoceros]] birth&lt;ref name=&quot;Panzernashornhaus&quot;&gt;[http://www.zoobasel.ch/aktuell/detail.php?NEWSID=37 {{De icon}} Eröffnung des Panzernashornhauses].

These and other achievements lead [[Forbes]] Travel to rank Zoo Basel as one of the fifteen best zoos in the world in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes&quot;&gt;[http://www.getlisty.com/preview/worlds-best-zoos/ {{En icon}} Forbes Travel]. GetListy, retrieved 2010-3-26&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel.  Evidence of this are the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's  in-official name: locals lovingly call &quot;their&quot; zoo &quot;''Zolli''&quot; by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.

===Museums===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of museums]] --&gt;

[[File:Tinguely Museum Basel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Tinguely Museum]]]]
The [[Museums in Basel|Basel museums]] cover a broad and diverse spectrum of [[collection (museum)|collections]] with a marked concentration in the [[fine art]]s. They house numerous holdings of international significance. The over three dozen institutions yield an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other cities of similar size and draw over one million visitors annually.

Constituting an essential component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museum collection was first created back in 1661 and represents the oldest public collection in continuous existence. Since the late 1980s, various private collections have been made accessible to the public in new purpose-built structures that have been recognized as acclaimed examples of [[avant-garde]] museum [[architecture]].

The '''Black Russian''' is a [[cocktail]] of [[vodka]] and [[coffee liqueur]] (usually three parts vodka to two parts coffee liqueur, per the [[Kahlúa]] bottle's label, or five parts vodka to two parts coffee liqueur, per [[IBA Official Cocktail|IBA]] specified ingredients) and sometimes mixed with Cola. When topped with Cola, it is referred to as a Dirty Black Russian, as opposed to Clean when without it. Traditionally the drink is made by pouring the vodka over [[ice cube]]s or cracked ice in an [[old-fashioned glass]], followed by the coffee liqueur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = SpiritDrinks.com - Black Russian | publisher = SpiritDrinks | url = http://www.spiritdrinks.com/cocktails/Black_Russian.asp | accessdate = July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This combination first appeared in 1949, and is ascribed to Gustave Tops, a [[Demographics of Belgium|Belgian]] [[Bartender|barman]], who created it at the [[Hotel Metropole, Brussels|Hotel Metropole]] in [[Brussels]] in honor of [[Perle Mesta]], then [[United States|U.S.]] [[ambassador]] to [[Luxembourg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sicard&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | last = Sicard | first = Cheri | title = Featured Cocktails - Black Russian and White Russian | publisher = FabulousFoods.com | date = August 6, 2007 | url = http://www.fabulousfoods.com/index.php?option=com_resource&amp;controller=article&amp;article=21219&amp;category_id=237&amp;Itemid=177 | accessdate = June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cocktail owes its name to the use of vodka, a stereotypical Russian spirit, and the blackness of the coffee liqueur.

==Variations==
* A variation is the '''Tall Black Russian''', which is prepared in the same manner as the Black Russian, but served in a taller glass and topped up with [[Cola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Tall Black Russian | publisher = Fluid Trade | url = http://www.fluidtrade.co.uk/cocktailview.aspx?CocktailID=303&amp;x=0 | accessdate = June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Black Magic''', a sour twist on the Black Russian, can be made by adding a dash of lemon juice and a [[lemon twist]] garnish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Black Magic | publisher = in-the-spirit.co.uk | url = http://www.in-the-spirit.co.uk/cocktails/view_cocktail.php?id=35 | accessdate = June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When finished with a head of [[Guinness]] stout, the result is called an '''Irish Russian''' or a '''Smooth Black Russian'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;sicard&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Smooth Black Russian recipe| publisher = DrinksMixer.com | url = http://www.drinksmixer.com/drink2057.html | accessdate = June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bunnies &amp; Burrows''''' (''B&amp;B'') is a [[role-playing game]] (RPG) inspired by the novel ''[[Watership Down]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GURPS&quot;&gt;''GURPS Bunnies &amp; Burrows'' (1992), [[Steve Jackson Games]], ISBN 9781556342370&lt;/ref&gt; Published by [[Fantasy Games Unlimited]] in [[1976 in games|1976]], the game centered on intelligent [[rabbits]]. It introduced several innovations to role-playing game design, being the first game to allow players to have non-[[humanoid]] roles, and the first to have detailed [[martial arts]] and skill systems. Fantasy Games Unlimited published a second edition of the game in 1982, and the game was modified and republished by [[Steve Jackson Games]] as an official [[List of GURPS books|''GURPS'' supplement]] in 1992.

As [[rabbit]]s, [[player character]]s are faced with dangers mirroring those in the real world. The only true &quot;[[monster]]s&quot; in the game are humans, but there are many predators and natural hazards. The characters' position in the [[food chain]] promotes an emphasis on role-playing and problem solving over combat.

==History==

Originally published by [[Fantasy Games Unlimited]] in 1976, only two years after the first role-playing game ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' was published,&lt;ref name=&quot;sos&quot;/&gt; this edition is now long out of print. The game was inspired by [[Richard Adams]]' fantasy novel ''[[Watership Down]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Magill | first = Frank Northen | year = 1983 | title = Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature | publisher = [[Salem Press]] | isbn = 0893564508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the players were given the opportunity to take on the role of rabbits.&lt;ref name=&quot;sos&quot;/&gt; As such, the game emphasized role-playing over combat for, according to [[Steffan O'Sullivan]], &quot;You're playing a rabbit, after all – how much combat do you want to do?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sos&quot;/&gt; The poor production values provided a barrier to the acceptance of the game. The art, by Charles Loving, was &quot;sketchy and of poor quality&quot;, while the document as a whole gave the appearance of having been [[Typewriter|typewritten]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rpgnet1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_4598.html |title=Bunnies and Burrows |accessdate=2007-09-11 |author=Jason Morningstar |date=2001-08-07 |work= |publisher=[[RPGnet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Building on this first edition, in 1979, B. Dennis Sustare wrote ''&quot;Different Worlds Present the World of Druid's Valley: A Bunnies &amp; Burrows Campaign&quot;'' in ''[[Different Worlds]]'', a magazine published by [[Chaosium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nobleknight.com/ProductDetailSearch.asp_Q_ProductID_E_4939_A_InventoryID_E_2147574686_A_ProductLineID_E__A_ManufacturerID_E__A_CategoryID_E__A_GenreID_E_ |title= #3 &quot;Blackmoor, Bunnies &amp; Burrows Campaign&quot;|accessdate=2008-09-03 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Noble Knight Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; It detailed how to combine the world of ''Bunnies &amp; Burrows'' with other [[fantasy world]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sustare |first=B.

Maxfield, in ''Pegasus'', a magazine published by [[Judges Guild]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nobleknight.com/ProductDetailSearch.asp_Q_ProductID_E_3549_A_InventoryID_E_2147508749_A_ProductLineID_E__A_ManufacturerID_E__A_CategoryID_E__A_GenreID_E_ |title= #6 &quot;Traveller - Beastmaster Safari Ship, Gorean Chess&quot;|accessdate=2008-09-03 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Noble Knight Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A second edition of ''Bunnies &amp; Burrows'' was printed in 1982 by Fantasy Games Unlimited,&lt;ref name=&quot;pnp1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showbook&amp;bookid=2217 |title=Bunnies &amp; Burrows, 2nd Ed.

{{quote|
The original game was very innovative for its time (less than two years after the first published RPG). Not only could you play non-humanoids for the first time, but it was the first role-playing game to have detailed martial arts rules, the first attempt at a skill system, and the first RPG to appeal as widely to women as to men&lt;ref name=&quot;sos&quot; /&gt;
}}

''Bunnies &amp; Burrows'' was the first role-playing game to allow for non-humanoid play.&lt;ref name=&quot;sos&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/bunny.html|title=Bunnies &amp; Burrows|accessdate=2007-09-11|author=Steffan O'Sullivan|date=1998-06-20|publisher=SOS' Gameviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ptgptb3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ptgptb.org/0003/news3.html |title=RPG News |accessdate=2007-09-11 |author= |date=Issue 3, June 1998 |work= |publisher=Places to Go, People to Be}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it was also the first role-playing game to have detailed martial arts rules (known as &quot;''Bun Fu''&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;rpgnet2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12907.phtml |title=Review of GURPS Bunnies &amp; Burrows |accessdate=2007-09-11 |author=Lev Lafayette |date=2007-04-16 |work= |publisher=[[RPGnet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first attempt at a skill system.&lt;ref name=&quot;sos&quot;/&gt; For its time, the game was considered &quot;light years&quot; ahead of the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|Original ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;rpgnet1&quot;/&gt;

[[Player (game)|Players]] of ''Bunnies &amp; Burrows'' take the role of [[rabbit]]s as their [[player characters]]. Interaction with many different animal species is part of normal gameplay. [[Human]]s, whose thought processes and motivations are completely [[Alien (signifier)|alien]], are the only monster to be encountered.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollsite&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://translate.google.com/translate?sourceid=navclient&amp;hl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2eroliste%2ecom%2fdetail%2ejsp%3fid%3d8166 |title=Bunnies &amp; Burrows (French) |accessdate=2007-09-11 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Rollsite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bunnies &amp; Burrows'' has the advantage of offering players an intuitive grasp of relative dangers and appropriate actions not possible in [[Fictional universe|game worlds]] that are substantially fictional. For example, a player is told their character is confronted with a [[fox]]. There is an immediate intuition on the amount of peril a rabbit is facing. Although player characters are substantially weaker than many of the dangers they face, the game is one of the first to encourage problem solving and outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollsite&quot;/&gt;

The mechanics of the [[role-playing game system]] were created specifically for ''Bunnies &amp; Burrows'', common at the time of its original publishing. It features eight [[statistic (role-playing games)|abilities]] and eight [[character class|classes]]. The task resolution system is based on rolls of [[percentile dice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rollsite&quot;/&gt; Although newer systems have updated game mechanics significantly, the ideas presented in ''Bunnies &amp; Burrows'' created the framework for modern role-playing games.&lt;ref name=&quot;played&quot;/&gt;

''GURPS Bunnies &amp; Burrows'' uses the [[GURPS|''GURPS'' system]] common in all ''GURPS'' products.&lt;ref name=&quot;sjg&quot;/&gt; Steffan O'Sullivan, who wrote ''GURPS Bunnies &amp; Burrows'' notes, &quot;The game has also been published as a GURPS supplement, but I usually play it in [[Fudge (role-playing game system)|Fudge]] these days - the simpler rules seem to work better for this genre in particular. I've also run it in Sherpa, which is oddly evocative of the original rules.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/bunny.html &quot;Bunnies &amp; Burrows&quot;], remarks by [[Steffan O'Sullivan]], June 20, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Although the game had &quot;incredible role-playing potential&quot;, the concept of role-playing rabbits can be viewed as bizarre, and as such at least one commentator believes that &quot;most people thought it was stupid&quot; when it was first released.&lt;ref name=&quot;Astinus&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Astinus | url = http://ptgptb.org/0003/hist3.html | title = The History of Roleplaying | accessdate = 2008-09-12 | date = June, 1998 |work = Places to Go, People to Be  | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is mirrored by Lev Lafayette, who, when describing his first exposure to the game, says &quot;Oh, how we laughed. 'Who on earth would want to roleplay a rabbit?', we mocked. 'What's the point? You can't do anything!'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rpgnet2&quot; /&gt; In spite of these first impressions, the game has generally received positive reviews: Lafayette, for example, goes on to say that it is &quot;really hard to fault ''GURPS Bunnies &amp; Burrows''&quot;, as it is educational, realistic, whimsical and clever,&lt;ref name=&quot;rpgnet2&quot; /&gt; while the game has also been described as a &quot;work of genius&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Astinus&quot; /&gt;  Due to its unique setting, the game remains popular in the [[furry]] community and is frequently played at [[furry convention]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

'''Bundaberg Rum''' is a dark rum produced in [[Bundaberg, Queensland|Bundaberg]], Australia, often referred to as &quot;Bundy&quot;.

The Bundaberg Distilling Company owns its own [[cola]]-producing facility, which supplies the cola for its [[Alcopop|ready-to-drink]] Bundaberg Rum and Cola products. 

==History==

Bundaberg Rum originated because the local sugar mills had a problem with what to do with the waste [[molasses]] after the sugar was extracted (it was heavy, difficult to transport and the costs of converting it to stock feed were rarely worth the effort). Sugar men first began to think of the profits that could be made from distilling. The vital meeting was held at the Royal Hotel on 1 August 1885, W M C Hickson served as the chairman, and other notables in attendance included all the big sugar mill owners of that time, W G Farquhar, F L Nott, S McDougall, T Penny, S H Bravo and A H Young, all to become the first directors of the Company. They started with a capital of 5,000 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;Information from 'Bundy A Centenary History' by Keith Dunstan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bundaberg rum was first produced in 1888, production ceased from 1907 to 1914 and from 1936 to 1939 after fires, the second of which caused rum from the factory to spill into the nearby [[Burnett River]].&lt;ref&gt;Julia Robinson. Voices of Queensland: words from the sunshine state. Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

H T Christsen Pty Ltd operated their own Bundaberg Rum bottling plant in Bourbong Street, Bundaberg at the rear of their large grocery and hardware business in the centre of town. The spirit was sold at UP and OP strength from their business. Spokesperson for the original family, Mr Rod Patch, recalls the origins of the shape of the current &quot;Bundy Bottle&quot;. It originated from the Bushells Coffee Chicory bottle that Bundaberg folks sold to his grandfather at the firm for one penny a bottle, after which they were washed and filled with the famous spirit. The shape remains the same but the capacity has been increased to the current 700ml. Patch's great grandfather, Hans Truval Christsen, a  Danish immigrant from Copenhagen and his son Frederick Christsen had an employment policy of employing staff from the Salvation Army faith in the rum bottling process as they were less likely to be tempted to sample the spirit. The Christsen family supported settlement farming families through hard times and these good deeds were acknowledged with the naming of Christsen Park at Bargara Beach.

In 1961, the company introduced the [[polar bear]] as its unusual choice of mascot, to imply that the rum could ward off the coldest chill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bundabergrum.com.au/flash/home.htm |title=Bundaberg Rum website – history section |accessdate=26 March 2008 |work=Bundaberg Rum website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Bundaberg Rum company and [[Distillation|distillery]] were sold to British company [[Diageo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diageo.com/en-row/NewsAndMedia/PressReleases/2000/Diageo+acquires+Bundaberg+Rum+from+Bundaberg+Sugar+Group+Ltd.htm Diago Press Release – Diageo acquires Bundaberg Rum from Bundaberg Sugar Group Ltd] via Diageo website ''6 December 2000''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distillery==
The Bundaberg Rum distillery is open to visitors for tours of the facility.  There is also a museum and offers free samples of Bundaberg Rum products for visitors.

==Sponsorship==
Bundaberg Rum is a major sponsor of the Australian &quot;[[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]]&quot; [[rugby union]] team and also sponsors the '''Bundaberg Rum Rugby Series'''.  Bundaberg is also a sponsor of the [[New South Wales Waratahs|NSW Waratahs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nswrugby.com.au/SponsorsPartners/SponsorsPartnersOverview.aspx Sponsors &amp; Partners – NSW Rugby]&lt;/ref&gt; Bundaberg Rum sponsored the rugby league [[ANZAC Test]] (also known as the ''Bundaberg Rum Test'') till 2009. Bundaberg Rum signed a 5 year deal with the [[National Rugby League|NRL]] to be the '''&quot;Official Spirit of the NRL&quot;'''.  They are also the naming-rights sponsor of NRL Monday Night Football.

Previously Bundaberg Rum had sponsored a stadium in [[Cairns, Australia]] which was formally known as Bundaberg Rum Stadium but has been renamed to [[Cazaly's Stadium]].

==Advertisering==

Bundaberg Rum has also been criticised for targeting its advertising towards young people and boys, through television commercials during [[National Rugby League|NRL]] broadcasts, and other promotions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/stories/s720116.htm ABC Radio National, 3 Nov 2002 Program: Background briefing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caan.adf.org.au/newsletter.asp?ContentId=t20060612 Community Alcohol Action Network (CAAN) 'Grogwatch']&lt;/ref&gt; The Bundaberg Rum Bear advertisements have been cited as one of the favourite ads among Australia's youth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bandt.com.au/news/4f/0c029c4f.asp B&amp;T Magazine, 20 December 2004 Story: &quot;Young adults are a paradox for marketers&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre]] in Australia criticised the sponsorship of sport by alcohol companies, quoted ''&quot;it's a message that young people get, that sports and alcohol go together.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/11/1057783360914.html The Sydney Morning Herald, 12 July 2003 Story: &quot;Alcohol ads wet whistle of youth sport clubs&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associations with aggressive drinkers==
Bundaberg Rum has been labelled the drink for [[yobbo]]s,&lt;ref name = &quot;yob1&quot;&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Bundaberg-denies-rum-jungle-claim/2005/03/07/1110160750608.html Bundaberg denies rum jungle claim] – [[The Age]], 8 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; after some bars reported that ''&quot;bundy drinkers are a lot louder, and more disruptive than other patrons.&quot;'' In 2005, four bars in [[Brisbane]] banned the rum products, claiming it makes drinkers aggressive and attracts the wrong crowd.&lt;ref name = &quot;yob1&quot;/&gt; ''&quot;They will abuse bar staff, half a dozen a night, normally [[gang]]s of [[bloke]]s, the marketing is directed at [[yobbo]]s,&quot;'' one bar owner told ''The Age'' newspaper.&lt;ref name = &quot;yob2&quot;&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Bundy-drinkers-not-yobs/2005/03/07/1110160748101.html Bundy drinkers 'not yobs'] – [[The Age]], 7 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The Bundaberg Rum Distillery admitted it was aware its brand had a reputation of being associated with aggression, and said it may change its advertising to dispel its &quot;yobbo&quot; image.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bundy_Fights&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bandt.com.au/news/ca/0c02daca.asp |title=Bundy fights yobbo claims |accessdate=27 March 2008 |author= |last=Ryan |first=Rosemary |date=15 March 2005 |publisher=B&amp;T Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ben Nevis ''' ({{lang-gd|Beinn Nibheis}}, {{IPA-gd|peˈɲivəʃ|pron}}) is the highest mountain in the [[United Kingdom]] and the whole of the [[British Isles]]. It is located at the western end of the [[Grampian Mountains (Scotland)|Grampian Mountains]] in the [[Lochaber]] area of the [[Scottish Highlands]], close to the town of [[Fort William, Highland|Fort William]].

As is common for many [[Scottish mountains]], it is known both to locals and visitors as simply '''the Ben'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ben Nevis, or the 'Ben' as it is fondly known locally|url=http://www.visit-fortwilliam.co.uk/mf_bennevis.html|publisher=Visit Fort William Ltd |accessdate=2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ben Nevis is almost always referred to by climbers as simply The Ben (Ben meaning Mountain)|url=http://www.takeupthechallenge.com/pages/page-nevis-history.htm|publisher=The Ben Nevis Challenge |accessdate=2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attracts an estimated 100,000 ascents a year,&lt;ref name=&quot;JMT&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmt.org/ben-nevis-estate.asp|title=Ben Nevis owned by the John Muir Trust|accessdate=2006-11-05|author=John Muir Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; around three-quarters of which&lt;ref name=&quot;Strategy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nevispartnership.co.uk/pdf/newnevis_strategy_summary.pdf|title=Nevis Strategy|accessdate=2006-11-05|author=The Nevis Working Party|format=PDF|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; are made using the well-constructed Pony Track from [[Glen Nevis]] on the south side of the mountain. For climbers and [[mountaineering|mountaineers]] the main attraction lies in the {{convert|700|m|adj=on}} high cliffs of the north face; among the highest cliffs in the [[United Kingdom]], they harbour some classic [[scrambling|scrambles]] and [[rock climbing|rock climbs]] of all difficulties, and are one of the principal locations in the UK for [[ice climbing]].

The summit, at 1,344 metres (4,409&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level, features the ruins of an [[observatory]], which was permanently staffed between 1883 and 1904. The [[meteorology|meteorological]] data collected during this period are still important for understanding Scottish mountain weather. [[C. T. R. Wilson]] was inspired to invent the [[cloud chamber]] after a period spent working at the observatory.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Ben Nevis&quot; is an [[Anglicisation|anglicism]] of the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] name &quot;Beinn Nibheis&quot;. &quot;Beinn&quot; is the most common Gaelic word for &quot;mountain&quot;, &quot;Nibheis&quot; is variously understood, though the word is commonly translated as &quot;malicious&quot; or &quot;venomous&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butterfield 96&quot;&gt;Butterfield, ''The High Mountains'', p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative interpretation is that &quot;Beinn Nibheis&quot; derives from &quot;beinn nèamh-bhathais&quot;, from &quot;nèamh&quot; &quot;heavens, clouds&quot; and &quot;bathais&quot; &quot;top of a man's head&quot;. A literal translation would therefore be &quot;the mountain with its head in the clouds&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;/&gt; though &quot;mountain of Heaven&quot; is also frequently given.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butterfield 96&quot;/&gt;

== Geography ==
Ben Nevis forms a [[massif]] with its neighbour to the north-east, [[Càrn Mòr Dearg]], to which it is linked by the Càrn Mòr Dearg [[Arête]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;&gt;Ordnance Survey ''Landranger'' 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Both mountains are among the nine in Scotland over {{convert|4000|ft|sig=2}}; [[Aonach Beag]] and [[Aonach Mòr]] also being located on the Nevis massif, with [[Ben Macdui]], [[Braeriach]], [[Cairn Toul]], [[Sgor an Lochain Uaine]] and [[Cairn Gorm]] being located in the [[Cairngorms]].

[[File:Ben Nevis massif.PNG|thumb|left|Western flank of the Nevis massif; from [[Sgùrr Dhòmhnuill]].]]
The western and southern flanks of Ben Nevis rise {{convert|1200|m}} in about {{convert|2|km}} from the floor of Glen Nevis&amp;nbsp;– the longest and steepest hill slope in the UK&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;&gt;W. H. Murray, ''The Companion Guide to the West Highlands of Scotland''&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– with the result that the mountain presents an aspect of massive bulk on this side. To the north, by contrast, cliffs drop some {{convert|600|m}} to Coire Leis. This [[Cirque|corrie]] contains the Charles Inglis Clark Memorial Hut (known as the CIC Hut), a private [[mountain hut]] located at {{convert|680|m}} above sea level, owned by the [[Scottish Mountaineering Club]]&lt;ref name=&quot;CIC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smc.org.uk/Huts/CIC.htm|title= Charles Inglis Clark Memorial Hut (C.I.C.) |accessdate= 2007-11-12 |author= Scottish Mountaineering Club website|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070915100543/http://www.smc.org.uk/Huts/CIC.htm |archivedate = September 15, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used as a base for the many [[climbing]] routes on the mountain's north face.

In addition to the main 1,344 m (4,409&amp;nbsp;ft) summit, Ben Nevis has two subsidiary &quot;tops&quot; listed in [[Munro's Tables]], both of which are called Càrn Dearg (&quot;red hill&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Munros&quot;&gt;{{cite book | name=D.A. Bearhop | year=1997 | title=Munro's Tables | isbn=0-907521-53-3 | publisher=Scottish Mountaineering Club &amp; Trust | author=revised and edited by Derek A. Bearhop.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The higher of these, at {{convert|1221|m}}, is situated to the north-west, and is often mistaken for Ben Nevis itself in views from the Fort William area. The other Càrn Dearg (1,020&amp;nbsp;m) juts out into Glen Nevis on the mountain's south-western side. A lower hill, Meall an t-Suidhe ({{convert|711|m}}), is located further west, forming a saddle with Ben Nevis which contains a small [[loch]], Lochan an t-Suidhe. The popular tourist path from Glen Nevis skirts the side of this hill before ascending Ben Nevis's broad western flank.

=== Geology ===
Ben Nevis consists mainly of [[igneous]] rock from the [[Devonian]] period (around 400 million years ago), [[intrusion|intruded]] into the surrounding metamorphic [[schist]]s; the intrusions take the form of a series of concentric [[ring dike]]s. The innermost of these, known as the Inner Granite, constitutes the southern bulk of the mountain above Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, and also the neighbouring ridge of Càrn Mòr Dearg; Meall an t-Suidhe forms part of the Outer Granite, which is redder in colour. The summit dome itself, together with the steep northern cliffs, are composed of [[andesite]] and [[basaltic]] lavas. The mountain has been extensively shaped by [[glaciation]].&lt;ref&gt;McKirdy, Alan Gordon, John &amp; Crofts, Roger (2007) ''Land of Mountain and Flood: The Geology and Landforms of Scotland''.

=== Climate ===
[[Image:Ben Nevis south face.jpg|thumb|The steep south face of Ben Nevis from [[Sgurr a' Mhàim]]]]
Ben Nevis's altitude, [[oceanic climate|maritime]] location and topography frequently lead to poor weather conditions, which can pose a danger to ill-equipped walkers. According to the observations carried out at the summit observatory from 1883–1904, fog was present on the summit for almost 80% of the time between November and January, and 55% of the time in May and June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meteohistory.org/2004polling%5Fpreprints/docs/abstracts/roy2_poster.pdf|title=The Ben Nevis Meteorological Observatory 1883-1904|accessdate=2006-11-27|author=Marjorie Roy|year=2004|format=PDF |work=|publisher=International Commission on History of Meteorology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average winter temperature was around {{convert|-5|C}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy&quot;/&gt; and the mean monthly temperature for the year was {{convert|-0.5|C}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray 221&quot;&gt;Murray, ''Companion Guide'', p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; In an average year the summit sees 261&amp;nbsp;gales,&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray 221&quot;/&gt; and receives {{convert|4350|mm}} of rainfall, compared to only {{convert|2050|mm}} in nearby Fort William,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Langmuir|year=1995 |title=Mountaincraft and Leadership (Third edition)|publisher=SportScotland, Edinburgh|isbn=1-85060-295-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|840|mm}} in [[Inverness]] and {{convert|580|mm}} [[London]]. Rainfall on Ben Nevis is about twice as high in the winter as it is in the spring and summer. Snow can be found on the mountain almost [[Snow patches in Scotland|all year round]], particularly in the gullies of the north face&amp;nbsp;– with the higher reaches of Observatory Gully holding snow until September most years and sometimes until the new snows of the following season.

== History ==
[[Image:Ben Nevis and Fort William from west.jpg|thumb|right|Ben Nevis and Fort William, seen from across [[Loch Linnhe]].]]
The first recorded ascent of Ben Nevis was made on 17 August 1771 by James Robertson, an [[Edinburgh]] [[botany|botanist]], who was in the region to collect botanical specimens. Another early ascent was in 1774 by John Williams, who provided the first account of the mountain's geological structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Suzanne Miller |year=2004 |title=Ben Nevis Geology |journal=The Edinburgh Geologist |volume=43 |pages=3–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Keats]] climbed the mountain in 1818, comparing the ascent to &quot;mounting ten [[St Paul's Cathedral|St. Pauls]] without the convenience of a staircase&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodgkiss 117&quot;&gt;Hodgkiss, ''The Central Highlands'', p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1847 that Ben Nevis was confirmed by the [[Ordnance Survey]] as the highest mountain in Britain, ahead of its rival [[Ben Macdhui (Scotland)|Ben Macdui]].

The [[#Observatory|summit observatory]] was built in the summer of 1883, and would remain in operation for 21 years. The first [[trail|path]] to the summit was built at the same time as the observatory and was designed to allow [[pony|ponies]] to carry up supplies, with a maximum gradient of one in five.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy&quot;/&gt; The opening of the path and the observatory made the ascent of the Ben increasingly popular, all the more so after the arrival of the [[West Highland Railway]] in Fort William in 1894.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLennan&quot;/&gt; Around this time the first of several proposals was made for a [[rack railway]] to the summit, none of which came to fruition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodgkiss 117&quot;/&gt;

In 2000, the Ben Nevis Estate, comprising all of the south side of the mountain including the summit, was bought by the Scottish conservation charity the [[John Muir Trust]].

== Ascent routes ==
[[Image:Ben Nevis Tourist Route.jpg|thumb|left|The lower part of the Ben Path, maintained at a high standard]]
The 1883 Pony Track to the summit (also known as the ''Ben Path'', the ''Mountain Path'' or the ''Tourist Route'') remains the simplest and most popular route of ascent. It begins at Achintee on the east side of Glen Nevis about 2&amp;nbsp;km (1.5&amp;nbsp;miles) from Fort William town centre, at around 20 metres above [[sea level]]. Bridges from the Visitor Centre and the [[youth hostel]] now allow access from the west side of Glen Nevis.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Butterfield 97&quot;&gt;Butterfield, ''The High Mountains'', p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The path climbs steeply to the saddle by Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe (also known as the 'Halfway Lochan') at 570&amp;nbsp;m, then ascends the remaining 700 metres up the stony west flank of Ben Nevis in a series of zig-zags. It is allegedly well-made and maintained throughout its length, but the loose scree, rocks and pebbles, especially on the path's upper reaches, can be hazardous and slippery. Thanks to the zig-zags, the path is not unusually steep apart from in the initial stages, but inexperienced walkers should be aware that the descent is relatively arduous and wearing on the knees.

[[Image:Carn Mor Dearg arete.jpg|thumb|right|The CMD Arête under deep snow in spring, from the summit of [[Càrn Mòr Dearg]]]]
A route popular with experienced [[hillwalking|hillwalkers]] starts at Torlundy, a few miles north-east of Fort William on the [[A82 road]], and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête (&quot;CMD Arête&quot;) before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a head for heights.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, ''The High Mountains'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; In common with other approaches on this side of the mountain, it has the advantage of giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face, which are hidden from the Pony Track.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butterfield 97&quot;/&gt;

It is also possible to climb Ben Nevis from the Nevis Gorge car park at the head of the road up Glen Nevis, either by the south-east ridge or via the summit of Càrn Dearg (south-west). These routes do not require scrambling, but are shorter and steeper, and tend to be used by experienced hill walkers.

== The summit ==
[[Image:War Memorial, Ben Nevis.jpg|thumb|left|The summit war memorial, October 2006]]
The summit of Ben Nevis comprises a large stony [[plateau]] of about {{convert|40|ha|-1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9078533|title=Ben Nevis|accessdate=2006-11-25|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}} (Subscription required for full access.)&lt;/ref&gt; The highest point is marked with a large, solidly built [[cairn]] atop which sits an Ordnance Survey [[trig point]].

The ruined walls of the observatory are a prominent feature on the summit. An emergency shelter has been built on top of the observatory tower for the benefit of those caught out by bad weather, and, although the base of the tower is slightly lower than the true summit of the mountain, the roof of the shelter overtops the trig point by several feet, making it the highest man-made structure in the UK. A [[war memorial]] to the dead of [[World War II]] is located next to the observatory.

On 17 May 2006, a piano that had been buried under one of the cairns on the peak was uncovered by the John Muir Trust, which owns much of the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1776987,00.html |title=Piano found on Britain's highest mountain |accessdate=2006-06-22 | location=London | date=2006-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/highlands_and_islands/4994552.stm |title=New twist in Nevis music mystery |accessdate=2006-06-22 | date=2006-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piano is believed to have been carried up for charity by removal men from [[Dundee]] over 20&amp;nbsp;years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/4998440.stm |title=Trust names Ben Nevis 'piano men' |accessdate=2006-08-15 | date=2006-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The view from the UK's highest point is extensive. Under ideal conditions, it can extend to over {{convert|190|km}}, including such mountains as the [[Torridon Hills]], [[Morven, Caithness|Morven]] in [[Caithness]], [[Lochnagar]], [[Ben Lomond]], [[Barra Head]] and to [[Knocklayd]] in [[County Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Viewfinder Panoramas: [http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/panoramas/GRW/NEVIS-North.gif North], [http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/panoramas/GRW/Nevis-South.gif South]. Retrieved on 25 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Observatory ===
[[Image:Ben Nevis summit.jpg|thumb|right|The summit plateau. The ruined observatory is in the centre, with the summit cairn to the right.]]
A meteorological observatory on the summit was first proposed by the [[Scottish Meteorological Society]] (SMS) in the late 1870s, at a time when similar observatories were being built around the world to study the weather at high altitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy&quot;/&gt; In the summer of 1881, [[Clement Lindley Wragge]] climbed the mountain daily to make observations (earning the nickname &quot;Inclement Rag&quot;), leading to the opening on 17 October 1883 of a permanent observatory run by the SMS. The building was permanently manned until 1904, when it was closed due to inadequate Government funding. The twenty years' worth of readings still provide the most comprehensive set of data on mountain weather in [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy&quot;/&gt;

In September 1894, C. T. R. Wilson was employed at the observatory for a couple of weeks, as temporary relief for one of the permanent staff. During this period, he witnessed a [[Brocken spectre]] and [[glory (optical phenomenon)|glory]], caused by the sun casting a shadow on cloud below the observer. He subsequently tried to reproduce these phenomena in the laboratory, resulting in his invention of the cloud chamber, used to detect [[ionising radiation]].&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1927/wilson-bio.html |title=C.

== Navigation and safety ==
[[Image:Ben Nevis cornice.jpg|thumb|right|View south-west from the summit in early April. When the cliff edges are [[cornice (climbing)|corniced]], accurate navigation is critical.]]
Ben Nevis's popularity, climate and complex [[topography]] contribute to a high number of [[mountain rescue]] incidents. In 1999, for example, there were 41 rescues and four fatalities on the mountain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strategy&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--Compared to what?--&gt; Some accidents arise over difficulties in [[navigation|navigating]] to or from the summit,&lt;ref name=&quot;MCofS Newsletter&quot;/&gt; especially in poor visibility. The problem stems from the fact that the summit plateau is roughly [[kidney]]-shaped, and surrounded by cliffs on three sides; the danger is particularly accentuated when the main path is obscured by snow. Two precise [[compass]] [[bearing (navigation)|bearings]] taken in succession are necessary to navigate from the summit cairn to the west flank, from where a descent can be made on the Pony Track in relative safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mountaineering Council of Scotland |title=Navigation on Ben Nevis |accessdate=2006-06-21 |url=http://www.mountaineering-scotland.org.uk/leaflets/nevis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team erected two posts on the summit plateau, in order to assist walkers attempting the descent in [[fog]]gy conditions. These posts were subsequently cut down by climbers, sparking controversy in mountaineering circles on the ethics of such additions.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCofS Newsletter&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Mountaineering Council of Scotland |year=1997 |title=Ben Nevis—The Future |journal=Newsletter |volume=33 |url=http://www.mountaineering-scotland.org.uk/nl/33b.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cairns debate&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mountaineering-scotland.org.uk/bendebate/index.html|title= Summit Safety and Ben Nevis Cairns: The MCofS seeks a resolution |accessdate= 2006-10-26 |author= The Mountaineering Council of Scotland |format=also see sub-pages}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argued that cairns and posts are an unnecessary man-made intrusion into the natural landscape, which create a false sense of security and could lessen mountaineers' sense of responsibility for their own safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cairns debate&quot;/&gt; Supporters of navigational aids pointed to the high number of accidents that occurred on the mountain (between 1990 and 1995 alone there were 13 fatalities, although eight of these were due to falls while rock climbing rather than navigational error),&lt;ref name=&quot;MCofS Newsletter&quot;/&gt; the long tradition of placing such aids on the summit, and the potentially life-saving role they could play.  A series of solidly-constructed cairns currently (September 2009) marks the upper reaches of the Pony Track.

== Climbing on Ben Nevis ==
[[Image:Ben N Face annotated.jpg|thumb|left|The north face, with key features marked. The Càrn Dearg Buttress and Castle Ridge are to the right of the photo.]]
The north face of Ben Nevis is riven with buttresses, ridges, towers and pinnacles, and contains many classic scrambles and rock climbs. It is of major importance for British winter climbing, with many of its routes holding snow often until late April. It was one of the first places in Scotland to receive the attention of serious mountaineers, with a descent of [[Tower Ridge]] in 1892 the earliest documented climbing expedition on the Ben.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adby&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry Adby &amp; Stuart Johnston|year=2003|title=The Hillwalker's Guide to Mountaineering|publisher=Cicerone|location=Milnthorpe|isbn=1-85284-393-4|pages=240–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hodgkiss, ''The Central Highlands'', p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; (It was not climbed from bottom to top for another two years). The Scottish Mountaineering Club's Charles Inglis Clark hut was built below the north face in Coire Leis in 1929. Because of its remote location, it is said to be the only genuine [[Mountain hut|alpine hut]] in Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIC&quot;/&gt; It remains popular with climbers, especially in winter.

Tower Ridge is the longest of the north face's four main [[ridges]], with around 600 metres of ascent. It is not technically demanding (its [[grade (climbing)#British|grade]] is Difficult), and most pitches can be tackled unroped by competent climbers, but it is committing and very exposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adby&quot;/&gt; Castle Ridge, the first of the main ridges, is an easier scramble, while Observatory Ridge is graded Very Difficult;&lt;ref&gt;Hodgkiss, ''The Central Highlands'', p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; the latter is the closest ridge to the summit. Between the Tower and Observatory Ridges is Gardyloo Gully, which takes its name from the cry of &quot;''garde à l'eau''&quot; ([[French language|French]] for &quot;watch out for the water&quot;), formerly used in Scottish cities as a warning when householders threw their slops out of a [[tenement]] window into the street. The gully's top wall was the refuse pit for the now-disused summit observatory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;/&gt; The North-east Buttress is the last and bulkiest of these four ridges, and is regarded as the hardest for its combination of technical difficulty and seriousness.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgkiss, ''The Central Highlands'', p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ben Nevis.jpg|thumb|right|The Càrn Dearg Buttress in early April]]
The north face contains dozens of graded rock climbs along its entire length, with particular concentrations on the Càrn Dearg Buttress (below the [[Munro]] top of Càrn Dearg NW) and around the North-east Buttress and Observatory Ridge. Classic rock routes include ''Rubicon Wall'' on Observatory Buttress (Severe)&amp;nbsp;– whose second ascent in 1937, when it was considered the hardest route on the mountain, is described by [[W. H. Murray]] in ''Mountaineering in Scotland''&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Murray [1947] (1962). ''Mountaineering in Scotland''. London: J. M. Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– and, on Càrn Dearg, ''Centurion'' (HVS) and ''Agrippa'' (E5).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodgkiss 130&quot;&gt;Hodgkiss, ''The Central Highlands'', p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Other classic routes were put up by Dr [[J. H. B. Bell]] and others between the Wars; these include Bell's 'Long Climb', at {{convert|1400|ft|m|abbr=on}} reputedly the longest on the mainland. Echo Wall, an extreme and as-yet ungraded climb was completed by [[Dave MacLeod]] in 2008 after two years of preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.alpinist.com/doc/web08x/newswire-echo-wall-macleod |title=MacLeod's Boldest: Echo Wall |publisher=Alpinist.com| accessdate = 2006-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The north face is also one of Scotland's foremost venues for winter mountaineering and ice climbing, and holds snow until quite late in the year; in a good year, routes may remain in winter condition until mid-spring. Most of the possible rock routes are also suitable as winter climbs, including the four main ridges; Tower Ridge, for example, is grade IV on the [[Grade (climbing)#Grade systems for ice climbing|Scottish winter grading system]], having been upgraded in 2009 by the Scottish Mountaineering Club after requests by the local Mountain Rescue Team, there being numerous benightments and incidents every winter season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotclimb.org.uk/bennevis.shtml |title=Climbing on Ben Nevis |publisher=Scottish Climbing Archive | accessdate = 2006-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the most popular ice climb on Ben Nevis&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodgkiss 130&quot;/&gt; is ''The Curtain'' (IV,5) on the left side of the Càrn Dearg Buttress. At the top end of the scale, ''Centurion'' in winter is a grade VIII,8 face climb.

== Ben Nevis Race ==
[[Image:Image29 jpg ben race 1979.jpg|thumb|right|1979 Ben Nevis Race]]
[[Image:Image6 Ben Race 1979.jpg|thumb|right|1979 Ben Nevis Race]]
The history of [[hill running]] on Ben Nevis dates back to 1895. William Swan, a barber from Fort William, made the first recorded timed ascent up the mountain on or around 27 September of that year, when he ran from the old post office in Fort William to the summit and back in 2 hours 41 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLennan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hugh Dan MacLennan |year=1998 |month= November |title=The Ben Race: The supreme test of athletic fitness |journal=The Sports Historian |volume=18 |issue=2 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportsHistorian/1998/sh182j.pdf |accessdate=2009-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following years saw several improvements on Swan's record, but the first competitive race was held on 3 June 1898 under Scottish Amateur Athletic Association rules. Ten competitors ran the course, which started at the Lochiel Arms Hotel in [[Banavie]] and was thus longer than the route from Fort William; the winner was 21-year-old Hugh Kennedy, a gamekeeper at Tor Castle, who finished (coincidentally with Swan's original run) in 2&amp;nbsp;hours 41&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLennan&quot;/&gt;

Regular races were organised until 1903, when two events were held; these were the last for 24&amp;nbsp;years, perhaps due to the closure of the summit observatory the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLennan&quot;/&gt; The first was from [[Achintee]], at the foot of the Pony Track, and finished at the summit; It was won in just over an hour by Ewen MacKenzie, the observatory roadman.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLennan&quot;/&gt; The second race ran from new Fort William post office, and MacKenzie lowered the record to 2&amp;nbsp;hours 10&amp;nbsp;minutes, a record he held for 34&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLennan&quot;/&gt;

The Ben Nevis Race has been run in its current form since 1937. It now takes place on the first Saturday in September every year, with a maximum of 500&amp;nbsp;competitors taking part.&lt;ref name=&quot;FWO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visit-fortwilliam.co.uk/mf_race.html|title=Ben Nevis Race - a brief history|accessdate=2006-11-25|publisher=Fort William Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; It starts and finishes at the [[Claggan Park, Fort William|Claggan Park]] football ground on the outskirts of Fort William, and is {{convert|14|km}} long with {{convert|1340|m}} of ascent.&lt;ref name=&quot;SHR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishhillracing.co.uk/RaceDetails.aspx?RaceID=RA-0098&amp;RaceDate=9%2f2%2f2006|title=Scottish Hill Racing – Ben Nevis Race|accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the seriousness of the mountain environment, entry is restricted to those who have completed three hill races, and runners must carry waterproofs, a hat, gloves and a whistle; anyone who has not reached the summit after two hours is turned back.&lt;ref name=&quot;kopac&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhrrc.org/kopacs_corner/other_races/199803_ben_nevis.html|title=For Sport Alone: The Ben Nevis Race|accessdate=2009=06=02|author=Bob Kopac|publisher=MHRRC Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2010 the records have stood unbroken since 1984, when [[Kenny Stuart]] and Pauline Haworth of [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] Athletic Club won the men's and the women's races with times of 1:25:34 and 1:43:25 respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;SHR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bennevisrace.co.uk/ The Ben Nevis Race].

== Environmental issues ==
[[Image:Allt a' Mhuilinn.JPG|thumb|left|Path to the CIC Hut alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn]]
Ben Nevis's popularity and high profile have led to concerns in recent decades over the impact of humans on the fragile mountain environment. These concerns contributed to the purchase of the Ben Nevis Estate in 2000 by the John Muir Trust, a Scottish charity dedicated to the conservation of wild places. The Estate covers 1,700 hectares of land on the south side of Ben Nevis and the neighbouring mountains of Càrn Mòr Dearg and Aonach Beag, including the summit of Ben Nevis.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMT&quot;/&gt;

The John Muir Trust is one of nine bodies represented on the main board of the Nevis Partnership. Founded in 2003, the Partnership, which also includes representatives from local government, Glen Nevis residents and mountaineering interests, works to &quot;guide future policies and actions to safeguard, manage and where appropriate enhance the environmental qualities and opportunities for visitor enjoyment and appreciation of the Nevis area&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nevis Partnership |url=http://www.nevispartnership.co.uk/ |accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its projects include path repairs and improvements and the development of strategies for visitor management.

One of the Nevis Partnership's more controversial actions has concerned the large number of [[memorial]] [[commemorative plaque|plaques]] placed by individuals, especially around the summit war memorial. Many people believe that the proliferation of such plaques is inappropriate, and in August 2006 the Nevis Partnership declared an intention to eventually remove these plaques (after making efforts to return them to their owners), as part of a wider campaign to clean up the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=The Nevis Partnership| title=Removal of artefacts from Ben Nevis| url=http://www.mountaineering-scotland.org.uk/news/nevis_rel.html| date=2006-08-17| accessdate=2006-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the amount of litter on the Pony Track was highlighted by national media, including [[BBC Radio 5 Live]]. [[Robin Kevan]], a retired social worker from mid-Wales who is known as &quot;Rob the Rubbish&quot; for his efforts to clean up the countryside, then drove to Ben Nevis and cleaned the mountain himself, resulting in much media coverage and a concerted clean-up effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rob the Rubbish |url=http://www.robtherubbish.com/ | accessdate = 2006-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ben Nevis Distillery is a [[single malt Scotch|single malt whisky]] distillery at the foot of the mountain, located by Victoria Bridge to the north of Fort William.

'''Bipolar I disorder''' is a [[mood disorder]] that is characterized by at least one [[manic episode|manic]] or [[mixed episode]]. There may be episodes of [[hypomania]] or [[major depressive episode|major depression]] as well.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} It is a sub-[[diagnosis]] of [[bipolar disorder]], and conforms to the classic concept of manic-depressive illness.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria==
The essential feature of bipolar I disorder is a clinical course that is characterized by the occurrence of one or more manic episodes or mixed episodes. Often individuals have also had one or more [[major depressive episode]]s. Episodes of substance-induced mood disorder due to the direct effects of a [[medication]], or other [[somatic psychology|somatic]] treatments for depression, [[drug abuse]], or [[toxin]] exposure, or of mood disorder due to a general medical condition need to be excluded before a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder can be made. In addition, the episodes must not be better accounted for by [[schizoaffective disorder]] or superimposed on [[schizophrenia]], [[schizophreniform disorder]], [[delusional disorder]], or a [[psychotic disorder]] not otherwise specified.

== Treatment ==
===Medical assessment===
Routine medical assessments are often prescribed to rule-out or identify a somatic cause for bipolar I symptoms. These tests can include [[ultrasound]]s of the head, [[x-ray computed tomography]] (CAT scan), [[electroencephalogram]], [[HIV test]], [[full blood count]], [[thyroid function test]], [[liver function test]], [[urea]] and [[creatinine]] levels and if patient is on [[lithium]], lithium levels are taken. Drug screening includes [[recreational drug]]s, particularly [[cannabinoid]]s, and exposure to toxins.

===Medication===
[[Mood stabilizer]]s
# [[Lithium carbonate]], the mainstay in the management of bipolar disorder, but it has a narrow [[therapeutic range]] and typically requires monitoring
# [[Anticonvulsant]]s, such as [[sodium valproate]], [[carbamazepine]] or [[lamotrigine]]
# [[Antipsychotic]]s, such as [[quetiapine]], [[risperidone]], [[olanzapine]] or [[aripiprazole]]
# [[Electroconvulsive therapy]], a psychiatric treatment in which [[seizure]]s are [[electrically]] induced in [[anesthetized]] patients for [[therapeutic effect]]

Some [[antidepressant]]s have been found to precipitate a manic episode.

===Patient education===
Information on the condition, importance of regular [[sleep]] patterns, routines and eating habits and the importance of [[medication compliance|compliance with medication]] as [[medical prescription|prescribed]]. [[Behavior modification]] through [[mental health counselor|counselling]] can have positive influence to help reduce the effects of risky behavior during the manic phase.

'''Bacardi''' is a family-controlled [[Distilled beverage|spirits]] company, best known as a producer of [[rum]]s, including [[Bacardi Superior]] and [[Bacardi 151]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|publisher=New York Times
|title=Bacardi to Buy Grey Goose,Stirring More Talk of I.P.O.
|author=Andrew Ross Sorkin
|date=June 21, 2004
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company sells in excess of 200 million bottles per year in nearly 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/58/58530.html Bacardi &amp; Company Limited Company Profile] from [[Yahoo!]]&lt;/ref&gt; The company's sales in 2007 were US$5.5 billion, up from $4.9 billion in 2006.

Bacardi is headquartered in [[Hamilton, Bermuda]] and has a 16-member board of directors led by the original founder's great-great grandson, Facundo L. Bacardí. The President Bernard F. Ramírez and Co-President Charles M. Hernández, also play a large part in production and sales.

==Early history==
[[Facundo Bacardí|Facund Bacardí i Massó]], a [[Catalan people|Catalan]] wine merchant, was born in [[Sitges]], [[Catalonia]], ([[Spain]]) in 1814, and emigrated to [[Cuba]] in 1830. During this period, rum was cheaply made and not considered a refined drink, one rarely sold in upscale taverns. Don Facundo began attempting to &quot;tame&quot; rum. After experimenting with several techniques he hit upon filtering the rum through charcoal, which removed impurities. In addition to this, Facundo aged the rum in oak barrels, which had the effect of &quot;mellowing&quot; the drink.

Moving from the experimental stage to a more commercial endeavor, he and his brother José set up shop in a [[Santiago de Cuba]] distillery they bought in [[1862]]; that distillery housed a [[still]] made of [[copper]] and [[cast iron]], and was in a building in whose rafters lived [[Leaf-nosed bat|fruit bats]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bacardilimited.com/heritage_1.html Our heritage: the early years] from the company's corporate website&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1880s and 90s were turbulent times for Cuba and the company. [[Emilio Bacardí]], Don Facundo's eldest son, was repeatedly imprisoned in a Spanish prison for (legitimate) suspicions of running a rebel financing and support network during the [[Cuban War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
|last=Gjelten
|first=Tom
|title=Bacardi and the Long Fight for Cuba
|publisher=Viking
|year=2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emilio's brothers, Facundo and José, and his brother-in-law Henri (Don Enrique) Schueg, remained in Cuba with the difficult task of sustaining the company during a period of war. The women in the family were refugees in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. After the war and the US occupation of Cuba, &quot;The Original [[Cuba Libre]]&quot; and the [[Daiquiri]] were both born with Bacardi rum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.strawberry-daiquiri-recipe.com/strawberry-daiquiri-invention.php
|title=Daiquiri
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1899 [[United States|US]] general [[Leonard Wood]] appointed Emilio Bacardí mayor of [[Santiago de Cuba]].
[[Image:Bacardi Building.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Bacardi Building in Havana, Cuba.]]

In 1912 Gerard Ransom traveled to [[Egypt]] where he purchased a mummy for the future Emilio Bacardí Moreau Municipal Museum in Santiago de Cuba, a mummy still on display.&lt;ref name=Coulombe&gt;{{cite book
|publisher=Citadel Press
|title=Rum
|author=Charles A. Coulombe
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Santiago, his brother Facundo M. Bacardí continued to manage the company along with Schueg, who began the company's international expansion by opening new bottling plants in [[Barcelona]] (1910) and [[New York City]] (1915).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bacardilimited.com/heritage_2.html Bacardi Limited: Our Heritage - Havana and Beyond.]Retrieved 10 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The New York plant was soon shut down due to [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], yet during this time Cuba became a hotspot for US tourists.

In the 1920s, Emilio opened a new distillery in Santiago. During this decade, the [[art deco]] Bacardi building was built in [[Havana]] and the third generation of the Bacardí family was entering the business. Facundo Bacardí invited US-Americans (still subject to Prohibition) to &quot;Come to Cuba and bathe in Bacardi rum.&quot;&lt;ref name=Coulombe /&gt; A new product was introduced: [[Hatuey]] beer.
[[Image:PR BacardiCathedralOfRum.jpg|thumb|The &quot;Cathedral of Rum&quot; at the Bacardi distillery in [[Cataño, Puerto Rico|Cataño]], [[Puerto Rico]], near [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]].]]

Bacardi's transition into an international brand was due mostly to Schueg's &quot;business genius&quot;; Schueg &quot;branded Cuba as the home of rum, and Bacardi as the king of rums&quot; and expanded overseas, first to Mexico (1931), then to Puerto Rico (1936), and then again to the United States (1944).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bacardilimited.com/heritage_3.html Bacardi Limited: Our Heritage - Prohibition and Innovation.]Retrieved 10 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacardi moved after-Prohibition production first to Puerto Rico (which enabled rum to be sold tariff-free in the U.S. after Prohibition), and then to Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;washpost&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/21/AR2008082102222.html Rum and Revolution] an August 2008 review of ''Bacardi and the Long Fight for Cuba'' (ISBN 067001978X) from ''The Washington Post''&lt;/ref&gt; Those changes were accompanied by a new brand name: Ron Bacardi (&quot;Ron&quot; is the Spanish word for rum). Several trademark disputes went to court during this time regarding uses of the Bacardi name on rum produced outside of Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bacardilimited.com/heritage_3.html Bacardi Limited: Our Heritage - Prohibition and Innovation.]Retrieved 10 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II]] years the company was led by Schueg's son-in-law José 'Pepin' Bosch. Pepin founded Bacardi Imports in New York City, and was named Cuba's Minister of the Treasury in 1949.

==Cuban Revolution==
Portuondo and other Bacardí family members initially supported the [[Cuban Revolution|Cuban revolutionaries]], including [[Fidel Castro]] and the broader [[26th of July Movement|M-26-7 movement]]: Bosch personally donated tens of thousands of dollars to the movement, and acted as an intermediary between the revolutionaries and the CIA to assuage the latter's concerns.&lt;ref name=&quot;washpost&quot;/&gt; Family members, employees, and facilities were put to use by the movement and the company supported the revolution publicly with advertisements and parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;washpost&quot;/&gt; But their support turned to opposition as the pro-Soviet [[Che Guevara]] wing{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} of the movement began to dominate and as Castro turned against American interests.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The Bacardí family (and hence the company) maintained a fierce [[opposition to Fidel Castro|opposition to Fidel Castro's]] revolution in Cuba in the 1960s. The Bacardí family and company left Cuba after it became clear that Castro was serious about his pledges for change; in particular, in nationalizing and banning all private property on the island as well as all bank accounts. However, the company had started foreign branches a few years prior to the revolution; the company moved the all important Bacardi international [[trademark]]s out of the country to the Bahamas prior to the revolution as well as constructing a plant in [[Puerto Rico]] after the prohibition era to save in import taxes for rum being imported to the US. This helped the company survive after the communist government nationalized all Bacardi assets in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Bacardi: The Hidden War
|author=Hernando Calvo Ospina
|publisher=Pluto Press
|year=2002
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacardí family members had close ties to the US political elite as well as organisations of state such as the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. The family funded various [[Cuban exile]] organisations such as [[CANF]].

Embittered Bacardi helmsman José Pepin Bosch bought a surplus [[B-26 Marauder|B-26]] bomber with the hopes of bombing Cuban oil refineries (the bold plan was foiled when a picture of the bomber appeared on the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]''). He was also allegedly involved in the CIA plot to assassinate [[Fidel Castro]]; documents uncovered during congressional investigations into [[John F Kennedy]]'s death bring to light a message outlining how he had plans to assassinate Castro, his brother [[Raúl Castro]], and [[Che Guevara]]. The RECE (Cuban Representation in Exile) also receives funding from Bacardi family members.

More recently, Bacardi lawyers were influential in the drafting of the 1996 [[Helms-Burton Act]] which sought to extend the scope of the [[United States embargo against Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/18355/the_helms-burton_act.html The Helms-Burton Act] from thinkquest.org/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 [[Otto Reich]], a lobbyist in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] on behalf of Bacardi Rum, drafted section 211 of the 1999 Omnibus appropriations act, a bill that became known as the Bacardi Act. Section 211 denied trademark protection to Cuban businesses products expropriated after the Cuban revolution, a provision keenly sought by the Bacardi family. The act was aimed primarily at [[Havana Club]] brand in the US, which had been registered by the Cuban government.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Louise Bardach: Cuba Confidential. Penguin books 2002. p.131&lt;/ref&gt; Section 211 has been challenged unsuccessfully by the Cuban government and the European Union in US courts; however, the act has been ruled illegal by the WTO (August 2001). The US Congress has yet to re-examine the matter.

==Bacardi and Cuba today==
Bacardi drinks are not found in Cuba today. The main brand of rum in Cuba is called [[Havana Club]], a formerly private company nationalised by the government. Drinks now made in the former Bacardi distillery are sold in Cuba under the name Caney.

Bacardi, despite having no business tie (in terms of production) to Cuba today, have decided to re-emphasise their Cuban heritage in recent years. This is mainly due to commercial reasons: facing increased competition in the Rum market from the now international brand Havana Club, the company concluded that it was important for sales to associate their rum with Cuba. TV adverts with slogans of 'Welcome to the Latin Quarter' are but one example of this. In 1998, under the distinctive bat logo, the phrase &quot;company founded in Santiago de Cuba in 1862&quot; was added.

Bacardi has faced criticism and legal problems for supposedly attempting to falsely convince consumers they were purchasing rum made in Cuba rather than just marking its heritage. Bacardi adverts in Spain, since 1966, had described a popular combination of rum and coke as &quot;rum and coke&quot;. However, after 1998, it began to describe the drink as [[Cuba Libre]] - literally translated as &quot;free Cuba&quot; which is the original name of the drink and how it's mostly called in Latin America. In this instance, Bacardi faced a legal ruling from the Spanish Association of Advertising Users which forced the company to stop the advert. They concluded that it could &quot;''mislead the viewer as to the true nature of the product''&quot; as the advert contained so many pieces of Caribbean imagery, one might conclude it came from Cuba (Ospina p.&amp;nbsp;79). Bacardi continues to fight a war in the courts with the Cuban government of the rights to trademarks around the world.

The Bacardi legacy lives on in Santiago and Havana through their grand buildings and historic significance. The Bacardi Building (''Edificio Bacardi'') in [[Old Havana]] is regarded as one of the finest [[art deco]] buildings in Latin America.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Brands==
Bacardi has made several acquisitions to diversify away from the eponymous Bacardi rum brand. In 1992 Bacardi acquired [[Martini &amp; Rossi]], the famous Italian producer of [[Martini (vermouth)|Martini vermouth]] and sparkling wines. In 1998 the company acquired [[Dewar's scotch]] and [[Bombay Sapphire]] gin from [[Diageo]] for $2 billion. Bacardi acquired the Cazadores tequila brand in 2001 and in 2004 purchased [[Grey Goose (vodka)|Grey Goose]], a [[France|French]] made [[vodka]], from [[Sidney Frank]] for $2 billion. In 2006 Bacardi purchased [[New Zealand]] vodka brand [[Pacific Dawn|42 Below]]. Other associated brands include the [[Havana Club (Bacardi)|US version of Havana Club]], [[Drambuie]] Scotch whisky liqueur, Disaronno [[Amaretto]], [[Eristoff]] vodka, [[Duo and trio cocktails#B and B|B&amp;B]] and [[Bénédictine]] liqueurs, and the Canadian [[alcopop]] [[Rev (drink)|Rev]].

Despite focusing on the middle and lower end of the price spectrum, some Bacardi rum offerings have achieved a modicum of success at international [[spirit ratings]] competitions. For example, their eight-year añejo rum earned gold medals at the 2008 and 2009 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proof66.com/display.asp?t=rum|title=Proof66.com Website|publisher= |date= |accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacardi is also the only brand to feature the [[Mexican free-tailed bat]] as its icon or logo. This is mostly because the [[Mexican free-tailed bat]] is a great [[sugar cane]] [[pollinator]] and eats insects that damage [[sugar cane]].

==Hemingway connection==
[[Ernest Hemingway]] ordered his [[daiquiris]] with Bacardi White Label rum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author=A. E. Hotchner
|title=Papa Hemingway
|publisher=Random House
|year=1966

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About||the RIC auxiliary force specifically recruited from former British Army officers |Auxiliary Division|other uses|Black and tan (disambiguation)}}

The '''Black and Tans''' ({{lang-ga|Dúchrónaigh}}) was one of two newly recruited bodies, composed largely of British [[World War I]] veterans, employed by the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] as [[Special Constable|Temporary Constable]]s from 1920 to 1921 to suppress revolution in [[Ireland]]. Although it was established to target the [[Irish Republican Army]], it became notorious through its numerous attacks on the Irish civilian population.

However, the term Black and Tans is sometimes used to refer to  the  RIC [[Auxiliary Division]].&lt;ref&gt;p120 [http://www.ndic.edu/press/pdf/5463.pdf ''Improving the law Enforcement-Intelligence Community Relationship''] National Defense Intelligence College, Washington, DC. June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
{{Ref improve section|date=August 2010}}
The late 19th and early 20th centuries in Ireland were dominated by the Irish pursuit of [[Home Rule]] or independence from the United Kingdom. Home Rule — limited self government — was passed by the British parliament in 1914, but postponed because of the outbreak of the First World War. Some [[Irish republicans]] saw Home Rule as being too limited a form of independence. After the [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin in 1916 when armed Irish nationalists staged a rebellion against British rule of Ireland, [[Irish nationalism]] was greatly radicalized and after public outrage at the [[show trial]]s and executions of the rising's leaders and the threatened imposition of conscription on Ireland for the First World War, it was channeled into the revolutionary [[Sinn Féin]] movement. Sinn Féin won 73 out of 105 seats in Ireland at the 1918 general election, and in January 1919 the [[First Dáil]] declared an independent [[Irish Republic]]. In the same month, the [[Irish Volunteers]], or [[Irish Republican Army]], began the guerrilla campaign known as [[Irish War of Independence]], which in 1919 consisted of attacks on the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]]. 

These attacks escalated during 1919 and in September the British administration outlawed the Dáil. Starting work on its next [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|Home Rule Act]], it had to plan for a growing loss of morale in the RIC with an interim solution until the Act was ready. 

In January 1920, the British government started advertising in British cities for men willing to &quot;face a rough and dangerous task&quot;, helping to boost the ranks of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) in policing an increasingly anti-British Ireland. There was no shortage of recruits, many of them unemployed First World War army veterans, and by November 1921 about 9,500 men had joined. This sudden influx of men led to a shortage of RIC uniforms, and the new recruits were issued with [[khaki]] army uniforms (usually only trousers) and dark green RIC or blue [[British police]] surplus tunics, caps and belts.   These uniforms differentiated them from the Army and the Regular RIC, and gave rise to the force's nickname: Christopher O'Sullivan wrote in the ''Limerick Echo'' on 25 March 1920 that, meeting a group of recruits on a train at [[Limerick Junction]], the attire of one reminded him of the [[Scarteen]] [[fox hunting|Hunt]], whose  &quot;Black and Tans&quot; nickname derived from the coloration of its [[Kerry Beagle]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spellissy1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Spellissy|first=Séan|title=The history of Limerick City |accessdate=9 August 2010|date=1998-12|publisher=Celtic Bookshop|isbn=9780953468300 |pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ennis comedian Mike Nono elaborated the joke in Limerick's Theatre Royal, and the nickname soon took hold,&lt;ref name=&quot;Spellissy1998&quot; /&gt; persisting even after the men received full RIC uniforms.

The new recruits received three months' hurried training, and were rapidly posted to RIC barracks, mostly in Dublin, [[Munster]] and eastern [[Connacht]]. The first men arrived on 25 March 1920. The government also raised another unit, the [[Auxiliary Division]] of the constabulary, known as the Auxiliaries or Auxies. This group was made up of ex-army officers. The Black and Tans acted with the Auxiliaries in the government's attempts to break the IRA.

==Conduct in Ireland==
Temporary Constables were paid the relatively good wage of 10 [[shilling]]s (½ a [[Pound stirling#Pre-decimal|pound]]) a day plus full board and lodging. With minimal police training, their main role was to increase the strength of police posts, where they functioned as sentries, guards, escorts for government agents, reinforcement to the regular police, and crowd control, and mounted a determined [[counter-insurgency]] campaign. They and the Auxies became known as ''Tudor's Toughs'' after the police commander, Major-General Sir [[Henry Hugh Tudor]]. They were viewed by [[Irish republicanism|Republicans]] as an army of occupation because of these duties. They soon gained a reputation for brutality,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.guardian.co.uk/fromthearchive/story/0,,1920235,00.html Don't be too tragic about Ireland]'' - The Guardian, October 12, 1921&lt;/ref&gt; as the RIC campaign against the IRA and Sinn Féin members was stepped up and police reprisals for IRA attacks were condoned by the government.

Alexander Will,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policememorial.org.uk/Forces/IRELAND/RIC_Roll.htm RIC Record]&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Forfar]] in Scotland, was the first Temporary Constable to die in the conflict. He was killed during an IRA attack on the RIC barracks in [[Rathmore]], [[County Kerry]], on 11 July 1920. 

The Black and Tans were not subject to strict discipline in their early months in Ireland and as a result, their deaths at the hands of the IRA in 1920 were often repaid with arbitrary reprisals against the civilian population. In the summer of 1920, the Black and Tans burned and sacked many small towns and villages in Ireland, beginning with [[Tuam]] in [[County Galway]] in July 1920 and also including [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]], [[Balbriggan]], [[Knockcroghery]], [[Thurles]] and [[Templemore]] amongst many others. In November 1920, the Tans &quot;besieged&quot; [[Tralee]] in revenge for the IRA abduction and killing of two local RIC men. They closed all the businesses in the town and let no food in for a week. In addition they shot dead three local people. On 14 November, the Tans abducted and murdered a Roman Catholic priest, [[Michael Griffin (Irish priest)|Fr. Michael Griffin]], in [[Galway]]. His body was found in a bog in [[Barna]] a week later. Finally, the Black and Tans sacked [[Cork (city)|Cork]] city, on the night of 11 December 1920, the centre of which was burned out.{{citation}}

In January 1921, the British Labour Commission produced a report on the situation in Ireland which was highly critical of the government's security policy. It said the government, in forming the Black and Tans, had &quot;liberated forces which it is not at present able to dominate&quot;. However, since 29 December 1920, the British government had sanctioned &quot;official reprisals&quot; in Ireland — usually meaning burning property of IRA men and their suspected sympathisers. Taken together with an increased emphasis on discipline in the RIC, this helped to curb the random atrocities the Black and Tans committed since March 1920 for the remainder of the war, if only because reprisals were now directed from above rather than being the result of a spontaneous desire for revenge. (see also [[Chronology of the Irish War of Independence]]).

However, many of the atrocities popularly attributed to the Black and Tans may have been committed by the [[Auxiliary Division]]; and some were committed by Irish RIC men. For instance, [[Tomás Mac Curtain]], the Mayor of Cork, was assassinated in March 1920 by local RIC men and the massacre of 13 civilians at [[Croke Park]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] was also carried out by the RIC although a small detachment of Auxiliaries were also present. However most Republicans did not make a distinction, and &quot;Black and Tans&quot; was often used as a catch-all term for all police and army groups.

The actions of the Black and Tans alienated public opinion in both Ireland and Britain. Their violent tactics encouraged both sides to move towards a peaceful resolution. [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Edward Wood]] MP, a future Foreign Secretary, rejected force and urged the British government to offer the Irish an offer &quot;conceived on the most generous lines&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Smith, 2nd Earl of Birkenhead|Lord Birkenhead]], ''Halifax'' (Hamish Hamilton, 1965), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]] MP, another future Foreign Secretary, was also horrified at the tactics being used. [[Lionel Curtis]], writing in the imperialist journal ''[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]]'', wrote: &quot;If the British Commonwealth can only be preserved by such means, it would become a negation of the principle for which it has stood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Curtis, ''The Round Table'', Vol. XI, No. 43 (June 1921), p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt; The King, senior Anglican bishops, MPs from the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] parties, [[Oswald Mosley]], [[Jan Smuts]], the [[Trades Union Congress]] and parts of the press were increasingly critical of the actions of the Black and Tans. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] said of the British peace offer: &quot;It is not fear of losing more lives that has compelled a reluctant offer from England but it is the shame of any further imposition of agony upon a people that loves liberty above everything else&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence James, ''The Rise and Fall of the British Empire'' (Abacus, 1998), p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

About 7,000 Black and Tans served in Ireland in 1920-22. More than one-third of them died or left the service before they were disbanded along with the rest of the RIC in 1922, an extremely high wastage rate, and well over half received government pensions. A total of 404 members of the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] died in the conflict and more than 600 were wounded but it is not clear how many of these were pre-war RIC men and how many were Black and Tans or Auxiliaries.

Those who returned to civilian life sometimes had problems re-integrating. At least two former Black and Tans were hanged for murder in Britain and another wanted for murder committed suicide before the police could arrest him.&lt;ref&gt;''The Black and Tans'' - Bennet, Richard - 1959, Page 222&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Due to the ferocity of the Tans' behaviour in Ireland and the atrocities committed, feelings continue to run high regarding their actions. &quot;Black and Tan&quot; or &quot;Tan&quot; remains a pejorative term for British in Ireland, and they are still despised by many in Ireland. One of the most famous Irish Republican songs is [[Dominic Behan|Dominic Behan's]] &quot;[[Come out Ye Black and Tans]]&quot;. The Irish War of Independence is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Tan War&quot; or &quot;Black-and-Tan War.&quot; This term was preferred by those who fought on the anti-Treaty side in the [[Irish Civil War]] and is still used by republicans today. The &quot;Cogadh na Saoirse&quot; medal, which was awarded to IRA Volunteers after 1941, bears a ribbon with two vertical stripes in black and tan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishmedals.com/1921.html 1919 - 1921 War of Independence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instructions to Listowel RIC, 19 June 1920==
{{See also|Listowel mutiny}}
On 19 June 1920 [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] [[Gerald Smyth]]  made a speech to the ranks of the [[Listowel]] RIC in which was reported as having said: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now, men, Sinn Fein have had all the sport up to the present, and we are going to have the sport now. The police are not in sufficient strength to do anything to hold their barracks. This is not enough for as long as we remain on the defensive, so long will Sinn Fein have the whip hand. We must take the offensive and beat Sinn Fein at its own tactics...If a police barracks is burned or if the barracks already occupied is not suitable, then the best house in the locality is to be commandeered, the occupants thrown into the gutter. Let them die there&amp;mdash;the more the merrier. Should the order (&quot;Hands Up&quot;) not be immediately obeyed, shoot and shoot with effect. If the persons approaching (a patrol) carry their hands in their pockets, or are in any way suspicious-looking, shoot them down. You may make mistakes occasionally and innocent persons may be shot, but that cannot be helped, and you are bound to get the right parties some time. The more you shoot, the better I will like you, and I assure you no policeman will get into trouble for shooting any man.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Attributed to [[Gerald Bryce Ferguson Smyth|Lt. Col. Smyth]], June 1920&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irish-society.org/Hedgemaster%20Archives/black-tans.htm The Black and Tans]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, A.N.: ''After the Victorians: the decline of Britain in the world.''

ISBN 81-313-0169-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The report in the Irish Bulletin noted that the content of the speech proved too much for many of the RIC men who refused to carry out the order and one officer, Constable Jeremiah Mee, put his gun on the table and called Smyth a murderer. He and 13 others resigned, actively changing sides in the conflict with many joining or assisting the [[Irish Republican Army]]. Mee became a confidant and ally of [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]].

Less than a month after his controversial instruction to the unit Smyth was shot dead by an IRA party led by [[Dan &quot;Sandow&quot; O'Donovan]].

== History ==
When the [[University of Heidelberg]] hired Robert Bunsen in 1852, the authorities promised to build him a new laboratory building.  Heidelberg had just begun to install [[coal-gas]] street lighting, so the new laboratory building was also supplied with gas.  The laboratory required ''heating'' from the gas as well as illumination.  For heating, it was desirable to maximize the temperature and minimize the luminosity.  Previous laboratory lamps left much to be desired regarding economy and simplicity, as well as the quality of the flame for a burner lamp.

While his building was still under construction late in 1854, Bunsen suggested certain design principles to the university’s mechanic, [[Peter Desaga]], and asked him to construct a prototype. (Similar principles had been used in an earlier burner design by [[Michael Faraday]] as well as in a device patented in 1856 by the gas engineer R W Elsner.)  The Bunsen/Desaga design succeeded in generating a hot, sootless, non-luminous flame by mixing the gas with air in a controlled fashion before combustion.  Desaga created slits for air at the bottom of the first cylindrical burner, the flame igniting at the top.  By the time the building opened early in 1855, Desaga had made fifty of the burners for Bunsen's students.  Bunsen published a description two years later, and many of his colleagues soon adopted the design. Bunsen burners are now used in laboratories all around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=34KwmkU4LG0C&amp;pg=PA233 | title = The development of modern chemistry | first1 = Aaron John | last = Ihde | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | year =  1984 | isbn = 9780486642352 | pages = 233–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation==
[[Image:Bunsen burner flame types .jpg|thumb|300px|left|Different flame types of Bunsen burner depending on flow through the throat holes (holes on the side of the Bunsen burner -- not to be confused with the needle valve for gas flow adjustment).1) air hole closed (Safety flame used for when not in use or lighting).2) air hole slightly open.3) air hole half open.4) air hole almost fully open (this is the roaring blue flame).]]
The device in use today safely burns a continuous stream of a flammable [[gas]] such as [[natural gas]] (which is principally [[methane]]) or a [[liquefied petroleum gas]] such as [[propane]], [[butane]], or a mixture of both.

The hose barb is connected to a gas nozzle on the laboratory bench with rubber tubing.  Most laboratory benches are equipped with multiple gas nozzles connected to a central gas source, as well as vacuum, [[nitrogen]], and steam nozzles.  The gas then flows up through the base through a small hole at the bottom of the barrel and is directed upward. There are open slots in the side of the tube bottom to admit air into the stream via the [[Venturi effect]], and the gas burns at the top of the tube once ignited by a flame or spark.  The most common methods of lighting the burner are using a [[match]] or a [[spark lighter]].

The amount of air mixed with the gas stream affects the completeness of the [[combustion]] reaction.  Less air yields an incomplete and thus cooler reaction, while a gas stream well mixed with air provides oxygen in an [[Mole (unit)|equimolar]] amount and thus a complete and hotter reaction.  The air flow can be controlled by opening or closing the slot openings at the base of the barrel, similar in function to the [[Choke valve|choke]] in a [[carburetor]].

If the collar at the bottom of the tube is adjusted so more air can mix with the gas before combustion, the flame will burn hotter, appearing blue as a result.  If the holes are closed, the gas will only mix with ambient air at the point of combustion, that is, only after it has exited the tube at the top.  This reduced mixing produces an incomplete reaction, producing a cooler but brighter yellow  which is often called the &quot;safety flame&quot; or &quot;luminous flame&quot;.  The yellow flame is [[luminosity|luminous]] due to small [[soot]] particles in the flame which are heated to [[incandescence]]. The yellow flame is considered &quot;dirty&quot; because it leaves a layer of carbon on whatever it is heating.  When the burner is regulated to produce a hot, blue flame it can be nearly invisible against some backgrounds. The hottest part of the flame is the tip of the inner flame, while the coolest is the whole inner flame. Increasing the amount of fuel gas flow through the tube by opening the [[needle valve]] will increase the size of the flame.  However, unless the airflow is adjusted as well, the flame temperature will decrease because an increased amount of gas is now mixed with the same amount of air, starving the flame of oxygen.

The burner will often be placed on a suitable [[heatproof mat]] to protect the laboratory bench surface.

==Variants==
Other burners based on the same principle exist. The most important alternatives to Bunsen burner are:
* [[Teclu burner]]; the lower part of its tube is conical, with a round screw nut below its base. The gap, set by the distance between the nut and the end of the tube, regulates the influx of the air in a way similar to the open slots of the Bunsen burner. The Teclu burner provides better mixing of air and fuel and can achieve higher flame temperatures than Bunsen burner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=u-y_sS546R8C|page=46|title= A Text Book of Homoeopathic Pharmacy|publisher= New Central Book Agency|location=Kolkata, India|date= 1994|first1=Mandal Pratim|last1= Partha|first2=B.|last2= Mandal|isbn= 9788173810091}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Meker-Fisher burner|Meker burner]]; the lower part of its tube has more openings with larger total cross-section, admitting more air and facilitating better mixing of air and gas. The tube is wider and its top is covered with a wire grid. The grid separates the flame into an array of smaller flames with a common external envelope, and also prevents [[Oxy-fuel_welding_and_cutting#Flashback|flashback]] to the bottom of the tube, which is a risk at high air-to-fuel ratios and limits the maximum rate of air intake in a conventional Bunsen burner. Flame temperatures of up to {{convert|1100|-|1200|°C|°F}} are achievable. The flame also burns without noise, unlike the Bunsen or Teclu burners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zco6AAAAIAAJ|page=38|title=Domestic Science, Volume 2|first= Charles W. |last=Hale| publisher=Cambridge University Press|location= London|year= 1915|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Evolution of cetaceans}}
Blue whales are [[rorquals]] (family [[Balaenopteridae]]), a family that includes the [[humpback whale]], the [[fin whale]], [[Bryde's whale]], the [[sei whale]] and the [[minke whale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheet&quot; /&gt; The family [[Balaenopteridae]] is believed to have diverged from the other families of the suborder [[Mysticeti]] as long ago as the middle [[Oligocene]]. However, it is not known when the members of those families diverged from each other.

The blue whale is usually classified as one of eight species in the genus ''Balaenoptera''; one authority places it in a separate monotypic genus, ''Sibbaldus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The first published description of the blue whale comes from [[Robert Sibbald]]'s ''Phalainologia Nova'' (1694). In September 1692, Sibbald found a blue whale that had stranded in the [[Firth of Forth]]—a male 78-feet-long—which had &quot;black, horny plates&quot; and &quot;two large apertures approaching a pyramid in shape&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bortolotti/&gt;

Other common names for the blue whale have included '''Sibbald's rorqual''' (after Sibbald, who first described the species), the '''great blue whale''' and the '''great northern rorqual'''. These names have now fallen into disuse. The first known usage of the term '''blue whale''' was in Melville's ''Moby-Dick'', which only mentions it in passing and does not specifically attribute it to the species in question. The name was really derived from the Norwegian '''blåhval''', coined by [[Svend Foyn]] shortly after he had perfected the harpoon gun; the Norwegian scientist [[Georg Sars|G.O. Sars]] adopted it as the Norwegian common name in 1874.&lt;ref name=Bortolotti&gt;{{cite book |last=Bortolotti |first=Dan  |title=Wild Blue: A Natural History of the World’s Largest Animal|year=2008 |publisher=St. Martin's Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and behaviour==
[[Image:Blue whale tail.JPG|thumb|left|A blue whale lifting its tail flukes.]]
[[Image:Blue Whale 001 body bw.jpg|thumb|Adult blue whale]]
The blue whale has a long tapering body that appears stretched in comparison with the stockier build of other whales.&lt;ref name=&quot;des&quot; /&gt; The head is flat and ''U''-shaped and has a prominent ridge running from the [[Blowhole (biology)|blowhole]] to the top of the upper lip.&lt;ref name=&quot;des&quot; /&gt; The front part of the mouth is thick with [[baleen]] plates; around 300 plates (each around one metre (3.2&amp;nbsp;ft) long)&lt;ref name=&quot;des&quot; /&gt; hang from the upper jaw, running 0.5&amp;nbsp;m (1.6&amp;nbsp;ft) back into the mouth. Between 60 and 90 grooves (called ventral pleats) run along the throat parallel to the body length. These pleats assist with evacuating water from the mouth after lunge feeding (see feeding below).

The [[dorsal fin]] is small,&lt;ref name=&quot;des&quot; /&gt; visible only briefly during the dive sequence. Located around three-quarters of the way along the length of the body, it varies in shape from one individual to another; some only have a barely perceptible lump, but others may have prominent and falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsals. When surfacing to breathe, the blue whale raises its shoulder and blowhole out of the water to a greater extent than other large whales, such as the fin or sei whales. Observers can use this trait to differentiate between species at sea. Some blue whales in the North Atlantic and North Pacific raise their tail fluke when diving. When breathing, the whale emits a spectacular vertical single-column spout up to {{convert|12|m|ft}}, typically {{convert|9|m|ft}}. Its [[lung]] capacity is 5,000 litres (1320 U.S. gallons). Blue whales have twin blowholes shielded by a large splashguard.&lt;ref name=&quot;des&quot; /&gt;

The flippers are {{convert|3|-|4|m|ft}} long. The upper sides are grey with a thin white border; the lower sides are white. The head and tail fluke are generally uniformly grey. The whale's upper parts, and sometimes the flippers, are usually mottled. The degree of mottling varies substantially from individual to individual. Some may have a uniform slate-grey color, but others demonstrate a considerable variation of dark blues, greys and blacks, all tightly mottled.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheet&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blue whales can reach speeds of {{convert|50|km/h|mph}} over short bursts, usually when interacting with other whales, but {{convert|20|km/h|mph}} is a more typical traveling speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheet&quot; /&gt; When feeding, they slow down to {{convert|5|km/h|mph}}.

Blue whales most commonly live alone or with one other individual. It is not known how long traveling pairs stay together. In locations where there is a high concentration of food, as many as 50 blue whales have been seen scattered over a small area. However, they do not form the large, close-knit groups seen in other baleen species.

Blue whales are difficult to weigh because of their size. Most blue whales killed by whalers were not weighed whole, but cut up into manageable pieces first. This caused an underestimate of the total weight of the whale, due to the loss of blood and other fluids. Nevertheless, measurements between {{convert|150|-|170|metric ton |short ton}} were recorded of animals up to {{convert|27|m|ft}} in length. The weight of an individual {{convert|30|m|ft}} long is believed by the American [[National Marine Mammal Laboratory]] (NMML) to be in excess of {{convert|180|metric ton|short ton}}. The largest blue whale accurately weighed by NMML scientists to date was a female that weighed {{convert|177|metric ton|short ton}}.&lt;ref name=pop /&gt;

An adult blue whale can eat up to 40 million krill in a day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j16BZVAVoE3Tey_0icx_2Bj6V_XQ  Afp.google.com Hunted, rammed, poisoned, whales may die from heartbreak too]&lt;/ref&gt; The whales always feed in the areas with the highest concentration of krill, sometimes eating up to {{convert|3600|kg|lb}} of krill in a single day.&lt;ref name=&quot;afsc&quot; /&gt; This daily requirement of an adult blue whale is in the region of 1.5 million kilocalories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ross Piper|Piper, Ross]] (2007), ''Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals'', [[Greenwood Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Because krill move, blue whales typically feed at depths of more than {{convert|100|m|ft}} during the day and only surface-feed at night. Dive times are typically 10 minutes when feeding, though dives of up to 20 minutes are common. The longest recorded dive is 36 minutes.&lt;ref name=Sears98&gt;(Sears 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The whale feeds by lunging forward at groups of krill, taking the animals and a large quantity of water into its mouth. The water is then squeezed out through the baleen plates by pressure from the ventral pouch and tongue. Once the mouth is clear of water, the remaining krill, unable to pass through the plates, are swallowed. The blue whale also incidentally consumes small fish, crustaceans and squid caught up with krill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Females typically give birth once every two to three years at the start of the winter after a [[gestation period]] of 10 to 12 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Art&quot; /&gt; The calf weighs about {{convert|2.5|metric ton|short ton}} and is around {{convert|7|m|ft}} in length. Blue whale calves drink 380&amp;ndash;570 litres (100&amp;ndash;150 U.S. gallons) of milk a day. [[Weaning]] takes place for about six months, by which time the calf has doubled in length. Sexual maturity is typically reached at eight to ten years, by which time males are at least {{convert|20|m|ft}} long (or more in the Southern Hemisphere). Females are larger still, reaching sexual maturity at around the age of five, by which they are about {{convert|21|m|ft}} long.

Scientists estimate that blue whales can live for at least 80 years;&lt;ref name = &quot;SearsCal02&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Art&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;npca&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Blue whale strandings are extremely uncommon, and, because of the species' social structure, mass strandings are unheard of.&lt;ref&gt;William Perrin and Joseph Geraci. &quot;Stranding&quot; pp 1192–1197 in ''Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals'' (Perrin, Wursig and Thewissen eds)&lt;/ref&gt; However, when strandings do occur, they can become the focus of public interest. In 1920, a blue whale washed up near [[Bragar]] on the [[Isle of Lewis]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]] of [[Scotland]]. It had been shot by whalers, but the harpoon had failed to explode. As with other mammals, the fundamental instinct of the whale was to try to carry on breathing at all costs, even though this meant beaching to prevent itself from drowning. Two of the whale's bones were erected just off a main road on Lewis and remain a tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Blue whale calls last between ten and thirty seconds. Blue whales off the coast of [[Sri Lanka]] have been repeatedly recorded making &quot;songs&quot; of four notes, lasting about two minutes each, reminiscent of the well-known humpback whale songs. As this phenomenon has not been seen in any other populations, researchers believe it may be unique to the ''B. m. brevicauda'' (pygmy) subspecies.

The reason for vocalization is unknown. Richardson ''et al.'' (1995) discuss six possible reasons:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{Main|History of whaling}}
[[Image:Blue Whale population, Pengo.svg|thumb|400px|Blue whale populations have declined dramatically due to commercial whaling.]]

Blue whales are not easy to catch or kill. Their speed and power meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead targeted [[Sperm whale|sperm]] and [[right whale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.

Soon, blue whales were being hunted in [[Iceland]] (1883), the [[Faroe Islands]] (1894), [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] (1898), and [[Spitsbergen]] (1903). In 1904-05 the first blue whales were taken off [[South Georgia]]. By 1925, with the advent of the stern slipway in factory ships and the use of steam-driven whale catchers, the catch of blue whales, and baleen whales as a whole, in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic began to increase dramatically. In the 1930–31 season, these ships caught 29,400 blue whales in the Antarctic alone. By the end of [[World War II]], populations had been significantly depleted, and, in 1946, the first quotas restricting international trade in whales were introduced, but they were ineffective because of the lack of differentiation between species. Rare species could be hunted on an equal footing with those found in relative abundance.

[[Arthur C. Clarke]], in his 1962 book ''Profiles of the Future'', was the first prominent [[intellectual]] to call attention to the plight of the blue whale. He mentioned its large brain and said, &quot;we do not know the true nature of the entity we are destroying.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur C. Clarke|Clarke, Arthur C.]] ''Profiles of the Future; an Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible''. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population and distribution today===
[[Image:Blauwal01.jpg|thumb|A blue whale set against the backdrop of the [[Azores]]]]
[[Image:Blue whale tail fluke.JPG|thumb|Image of a blue whale's tail fluke with the [[Santa Barbara Channel Islands]] in the background, August 2007]]

Since the introduction of the whaling ban, studies have failed to ascertain whether the [[conservation reliant species|conservation reliant]] global blue whale population is increasing or remaining stable. In the Antarctic, best estimates show a significant increase at 7.3% per year since the end of illegal Soviet whaling, but numbers remain at under 1% of their original levels.&lt;ref name=Ant/&gt; It has also been suggested that Icelandic and Californian populations are increasing but these increases are not statistically significant. The total world population was estimated to be between 5,000 and 12,000 in 2002, although there are high levels of uncertainty in available estimates for many areas.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt;

The [[IUCN Red List]] counts the blue whale as &quot;endangered&quot; as it has since the list's inception. In the [[United States]], the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] lists them as endangered under the [[Endangered Species Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest known concentration, consisting of about 2,800 individuals, is the northeast Pacific population of the northern blue whale (''B. m. musculus'') subspecies that ranges from [[Alaska]] to [[Costa Rica]], but is most commonly seen from California in summer.&lt;ref&gt;Blue Whale (''Balaenoptera musculus''): Eastern North Pacific Stock (''NOAA Stock Reports'', 2009), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Infrequently, this population visits the northwest Pacific between [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] and the northern tip of Japan.

In the North Atlantic, two stocks of ''B. m. musculus'' are recognised. The first is found off [[Greenland]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Nova Scotia]] and the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. This group is estimated to total about 500. The second, more easterly group is spotted from the [[Azores]] in spring to Iceland in July and August; it is presumed the whales follow the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] between the two volcanic islands. Beyond Iceland, blue whales have been spotted as far north as [[Spitsbergen]] and [[Jan Mayen]], though such sightings are rare. Scientists do not know where these whales spend their winters. The total North Atlantic population is estimated to be between 600 and 1,500.

In the Southern Hemisphere, there appear to be two distinct subspecies, ''B. m. intermedia'', the Antarctic blue whale, and the little-studied pygmy blue whale, ''B. m. brevicauda'', found in Indian Ocean waters. The most recent surveys (midpoint 1998) provided an estimate of 2,280 blue whales in the Antarctic.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A fourth subspecies, ''B. m. indica'', was identified by [[Edward Blyth|Blyth]] in 1859 in the northern Indian Ocean, but difficulties in identifying distinguishing features for this subspecies led to it being used a synonym for ''B. m. brevicauda'', the pygmy blue whale. Records for Soviet catches seem to indicate that the female adult size is closer to that of the Pygmy Blue than ''B. m. musculus'', although the populations of ''B. m. indica'' and ''B. m. brevicauda'' appear to be discrete, and the breeding seasons differ by almost six months.&lt;ref name = SHDistribution&gt;{{cite journal

===Threats other than hunting===
[[Image:Blue Whale (Balaenoptera musculus) Mysticeti baleen whale.jpg|thumb|left|A blue whale surfaces off Santa Cruz Island in the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]], near Santa Barbara, CA]]
Due to their enormous size, power and speed, adult blue whales have virtually no natural predators. There is, however, one documented case in ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' of a blue whale being attacked by [[orca]]s off the [[Baja California Peninsula]]; although the orcas were unable to kill the animal outright during their attack, the blue whale sustained massive wounds and probably died as a result of them shortly after the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Blue whales may be wounded, sometimes fatally, after colliding with ocean vessels, as well as becoming trapped or entangled in fishing gear.&lt;ref name=&quot;recplan98&quot;/&gt; The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including [[Marine mammals and sonar|sonar]], drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, which may make it harder for them to communicate.&lt;ref name=&quot;recplan98&quot;/&gt; Human threats to the potential recovery of blue whale populations also include accumulation of [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] (PCB) chemicals within the whale's body.&lt;ref name=&quot;wheelock&quot; /&gt;

With [[global warming]] causing glaciers and permafrost to melt rapidly and allowing a large amount of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be a disruption in the [[thermohaline circulation]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, a disruption in this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around the world, would be likely to have an effect on their migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Natural History Museum#Major specimens and exhibits|Natural History Museum]] in [[London]] contains a famous mounted skeleton and life-size model of a blue whale, which were both the first of their kind in the world, but have since been replicated at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]. Similarly, the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]] has a full-size model in its Milstein Family Hall of Ocean Life. A juvenile blue whale skeleton is installed at the [[New Bedford Whaling Museum]] in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]].

The [[Aquarium of the Pacific]] in [[Long Beach, California]] features a life-size model of a mother blue whale with her calf suspended from the ceiling of its main hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Kustodiev The Bolshevik.jpg|thumb|260px|right||[[Boris Kustodiev]]'s 1920 painting &quot;''Bolshevik''&quot;]]

The '''Bolsheviks''', originally also&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ushakov's Explanatory Dictionary of Russian Language]], article &quot;Большевистский&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; '''Bolshevists'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bolshevist Dictionaries define] the word &quot;Bolshevist&quot; both as a synonym to &quot;Bolshevik&quot; and as an adherent of Bolshevik policies.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ru | большевики, большевик}} (singular) {{IPA-ru|bəlʲʂᵻˈvʲik}}, derived from ''bol'shinstvo'', &quot;majority&quot;) were a [[faction (political)|faction]] of the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP) which split apart from the [[Menshevik]] faction&lt;ref&gt;Derived from ''men'shinstvo'', &quot;minority&quot;, which comes from ''men'she'', &quot;less&quot;. The split occurred at the Second [[Congress of the CPSU|Party Congress]] in 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[2nd Congress of the RSDLP|Second Party Congress]] in 1917. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suny|first=Ronald Grigor|title=The Soviet Experiment|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|isbn=9780195081053|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Bolsheviks were the majority faction in a crucial vote, hence their name. They ultimately became the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;After the split, the Bolshevik party was designated as RSDLP(b) (Russian: РСДРП(б)), where &quot;b&quot; stands for &quot;Bolsheviks&quot;. Shortly after coming to power in November 1917 the party changed its name to the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (РКП(б)) and was generally known as the Communist Party after that point, however, it was not until 1952 that the party formally dropped the word &quot;Bolshevik&quot; from its name. (See [[Congress of the CPSU]] article for the timeline of name changes.)&lt;/ref&gt; The Bolsheviks came to power in [[Russia]] during the [[October Revolution]] phase of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], and founded the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] which would later in 1922 become the chief constituent of the [[Soviet Union]]. 

The Bolsheviks, founded by [[Vladimir Lenin]], were by 1905 a mass organization consisting primarily of workers under a democratic internal [[hierarchy]] governed by the principle of [[democratic centralism]], who considered themselves the leaders of the revolutionary [[proletariat|working class]] of Russia. Their beliefs and practices were often referred to as '''Bolshevism'''. Bolshevik revolutionary leader [[Leon Trotsky]] commonly used the terms &quot;Bolshevism&quot; and &quot;Bolshevist&quot; after his exile from the Soviet Union to differentiate between what he saw as true [[Leninism]] and the regime within the state and the party which arose under [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]].

==History of the split==
In the [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], held in [[Brussels]] and [[London]] during August 1903, Lenin and [[Julius Martov|Martov]] disagreed over the membership rules. Lenin wanted members &quot;who recognise the Party Programme and support it by material means &lt;ref&gt;Robert Service, Lenin a biography, page 154.&lt;/ref&gt; and by personal participation in one of the party's organisations.&quot; [[Julius Martov]] suggested &quot;by regular personal assistance under the direction of one of the party's organisations.&quot;
Lenin advocated limiting party membership to a smaller core of active members, as opposed to &quot;card carriers&quot; who might only be active in party branches from time to time or not at all. This active base would develop the cadre, a core of &quot;[[professional revolutionaries]]&quot;, consisting of loyal communists who would spend the majority of their time organising the party toward a mass revolutionary party capable of leading a [[Proletarian revolution|workers' revolution]] against the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsarist]] autocracy. 

The base of active and experienced members would be the recruiting ground for this professional core. Sympathizers would be left outside and the party would be organised based on the concept of [[democratic centralism]]. Martov, until then a close friend of Lenin, agreed with him that the core of the party should consist of professional revolutionaries, but argued that party membership should be open to sympathizers, revolutionary workers and other [[fellow traveler]]s. 

The two had disagreed on the issue as early as March-May 1903, but it was not until the Congress that their differences became irreconcilable and split the party.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Israel Getzler]]. ''Martov: A Political Biography of a Russian Social Democrat'', Cambridge University Press, 2003 (first edition 1967), ISBN 0-521-52602-7 p.78&lt;/ref&gt; Although at first the disagreement appeared to be minor and inspired by personal conflicts, for example, Lenin's insistence on dropping less active editorial board members from ''[[Iskra]]'' or Martov's support for the Organizing Committee of the Congress which Lenin opposed, the differences quickly grew and the split became irreparable.

===Origins of the name===
The two factions were originally known as &quot;hard&quot; (Lenin's supporters) and &quot;soft&quot; (Martov's supporters). Soon, however, the terminology changed to &quot;Bolsheviks&quot; and &quot;Mensheviks&quot;, from the Russian &quot;bolshinstvo&quot; (majority) and &quot;menshinstvo&quot; (minority), based on the fact that Lenin's supporters narrowly defeated Martov's supporters on the question of party membership. Neither Lenin nor Martov had a firm majority throughout the Congress as delegates left or switched sides. At the end, the Congress was evenly split between the two factions. 

From 1907 on, English language articles sometimes used the term &quot;Maximalist&quot; for &quot;Bolshevik&quot; and &quot;Minimalist&quot; for &quot;Menshevik&quot;, which proved confusing since there was also a &quot;Maximalist&quot; faction within the Russian [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] in 1904–1906 (which after 1906 formed a separate [[Union of Socialists-Revolutionaries Maximalists‎]]) and then again after 1917.&lt;ref&gt;See Étienne Antonelli, ''Bolshevik Russia'', A.A. Knopf, 1920, tr. by Charles A. Carroll, 307pp.: &quot;the term &quot;Maximalist&quot; rather widely used as a translation for &quot;Bolshevik&quot; is historically false.&quot; (p.59)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Composition of the party ===
The average party member was very young. In 1907, 22% of Bolsheviks were under 20, 37% were 20-24 and 16% were 25-29. By 1905, 62% of the members were workers.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Cliff, Lenin and the Revolutionary Party, page 37&lt;/ref&gt; 22% of Bolsheviks were gentry (1.7% of the total population), 38% were uprooted peasants, compared with 19% and 26% for the [[Mensheviks]]. In 1907 78.3% of the Bolsheviks were Russian and 10% were Jewish (34 and 20% for the Mensheviks).
Total membership was 8,400 in 1905, 13,000 in 1906 and 46,100 by 1907 (8,400, 18,000, 38,200 respectively for the Mensheviks). By 1910 both factions together had fewer than 10,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, The Russian Revolution, pages 364-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginning of the 1905 Revolution (1903–1905)===
The two factions were in a state of flux in 1903–1904 with many members changing sides. The founder of Russian Marxism, [[Georgy Plekhanov]], who was at first allied with [[Lenin]] and the Bolsheviks, parted ways with them by 1904. [[Leon Trotsky]] at first supported the Mensheviks, but left them in September 1904 over their insistence on an alliance with Russian liberals and their opposition to a reconciliation with Lenin and the Bolsheviks. He remained a self-described &quot;non-factional social democrat&quot; until August 1917 when he joined Lenin and the Bolsheviks as their positions assembled and he came to believe that Lenin was right on the issue of the party.

All but one members of the Central Committee were arrested in [[Moscow]] in early 1905. The remaining member, with the power of appointing a new one, was won over by the Bolsheviks.&lt;ref&gt;Tim McDaniel, Autocracy, capitalism, and revolution in Russia, page 246&lt;/ref&gt;  

The lines between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks hardened in April 1905 when the Bolsheviks held a Bolsheviks-only meeting in London, which they called the Third Party Congress. The Mensheviks organised a rival conference and the split was thus formalised.

The Bolsheviks played a relatively minor role in the [[1905 Russian Revolution|1905 Revolution]], and were a minority in the [[St. Petersburg Soviet]] of Workers' Deputies led by Trotsky. The less significant Moscow [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]], however, was dominated by the Bolsheviks. These soviets became the model for those formed in 1917.

===The Mensheviks (&quot;The minority&quot;) (1906–1907)===
As the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] progressed, Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and smaller non-Russian social democratic parties operating within the Russian Empire attempted to reunify at the [[4th Congress of the RSDLP|Fourth (Unification) Congress of the RSDLP]] held at [[Folkets hus]], [[Norra Bantorget]] in [[Stockholm]], April 1906. When the Mensheviks struck an alliance with the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Jewish Bund]], the Bolsheviks found themselves in a minority. 

However, all factions retained their respective factional structure and the Bolsheviks formed the [[Bolshevik Center]], the de-facto governing body of the Bolshevik faction within the RSDLP. At the Fifth Congress held in London in May 1907, the Bolsheviks were in the majority, but the two factions continued functioning mostly independently of each other.

===Split between Lenin and Bogdanov (1908–1909)===
With the defeat of the revolution in mid-1907 and the adoption of a new, highly restrictive election law, the Bolsheviks began debating whether to boycott the new parliament known as the [[Third Duma]]. Lenin and his supporters [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]] argued for participating in the Duma while Lenin's deputy philosopher [[Alexander Bogdanov]], [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Mikhail Pokrovsky]] and others argued that the social democratic faction in the Duma should be recalled. 

The latter became known as [[recallists]] (&quot;otzovists&quot; in Russian). A smaller group within the Bolshevik faction demanded that the RSDLP central committee should give its sometimes unruly Duma faction an ultimatum, demanding complete subordination to all party decisions. This group became known as &quot;[[ultimatists]]&quot; and was generally allied with the recallists.

With a majority of Bolshevik leaders either supporting Bogdanov or undecided by mid-1908 when the differences became irreconcilable, Lenin concentrated on undermining Bogdanov's reputation as a philosopher. In 1909 he published a scathing book of criticism entitled ''Materialism and Empiriocriticism'' (1909),&lt;ref&gt;First published in Moscow in May 1909 by Zveno Publishers, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1908/mec/ available online]&lt;/ref&gt; assaulting Bogdanov's position and accusing him of philosophical idealism.&lt;ref&gt;See Alan Woods. ''Bolshevism: The Road to Revolution'', Wellred Publications, 1999, ISBN 1-900007-05-3 [http://www.marxist.com/bolshevism/part3-5.html Part Three: The Period of Reaction] available online&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1909, Bogdanov was defeated at a Bolshevik mini-conference in [[Paris]] organised by the editorial board of the Bolshevik magazine ''[[Proletary]]'' and expelled from the Bolshevik faction.&lt;ref&gt;English language excerpts from the resolution are quoted in ''A Documentary History of Communism in Russia'', ed. Robert V. Daniels, UPNE, 1993, ISBN 0-87451-616-1 p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final attempt at party unity (1910)===
With both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks weakened by splits within their ranks and by [[Tsar]]ist repression, they were tempted to try to re-unite the party. In January 1910, Leninists, recallists and various Menshevik factions held a meeting of the party's Central Committee in Paris. Kamenev and Zinoviev were dubious about the idea, but were willing to give it a try under pressure from &quot;conciliator&quot; Bolsheviks like [[Victor Nogin]]. 

Lenin was firmly opposed to any re-unification, but was outvoted within the Bolshevik leadership. The meeting reached a tentative agreement and one of its provisions made Trotsky's [[Vienna]]-based ''[[Pravda]]'' a party-financed 'central organ'. Kamenev, Trotsky's brother-in-law, was added to the editorial board from the Bolsheviks, but the unification attempts failed in August 1910 when Kamenev resigned from the board amid mutual recriminations.

===Forming a separate party (1912)===
The factions permanently broke off relations in January 1912 after the Bolsheviks organised a Bolsheviks-only [[Prague Party Conference]] and formally expelled Mensheviks and recallists from the party. As a result, they ceased to be a faction in the RSDLP and instead declared themselves an independent party, called '''Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks)''' - or RSDLP(b). Unofficially, the Party has been referred to as the &quot;Bolshevik Party&quot;. Throughout the century, the Party adopted a number of different names. In 1918, RSDLP(b) became '''(All-)Russian Communist Party''' and remained so until 1925. From 1925-52, the name was '''All-Union Communist Party''', and from 1952-91 '''[[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]'''. 

Although the Bolshevik leadership decided to form a separate party, convincing pro-Bolshevik workers within Russia to follow suit proved difficult. When the first meeting of the Fourth Duma was convened in late 1912, only one out of six Bolshevik deputies, [[Matvei Muranov]], (another one, Roman Malinovsky, was later exposed as a [[Okhrana|secret police]] agent) voted to break away from the [[Menshevik]] faction within the Duma on 15 December 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. McKean, ''St. Petersburg Between the Revolutions: workers and revolutionaries, June 1907-February 1917'', New Haven, [[Yale University Press]], 1990, pp. 140-1.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bolshevik leadership eventually prevailed and the Bolsheviks formed their own Duma faction in September 1913.

== Political philosophy ==
The Bolsheviks believed in organising a party in a centralised and disciplined fashion that sought to overthrow the [[Tsar]] through a mass workers' revolution. They believed and succeeded in creating a [[vanguard party]], a mass revolutionary party composed of what they called &quot;the most militant and [[Class consciousness|class-conscious]]&quot; workers capable of leading the masses of Russian workers. 

Although the Bolsheviks were not monolithic, they were characterised by a rigid adherence to the leadership of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|central committee]], based on the principles of [[democratic centralism]]. The Mensheviks favored open party membership and espoused cooperation with the other socialist and some non-socialist groups in Russia. Bolsheviks generally refused to co-operate with [[Liberalism|liberal]] or radical parties, viewing them as &quot;[[bourgeois]]&quot; parties, or even eventually other [[socialist]] organisations, although Lenin sometimes made tactical alliances.

[[Image:1919-Trotsky Lenin Kamenev-Party-Congress.jpg|thumb|Left to right: [[Trotsky]], [[Lenin]], and [[Kamenev]]]]

==From Bolshevism to Communism==
In 1952 at the XIX Party Congress Stalin declared: &quot;There are no more Mensheviks. Why should we call ourselves Bolsheviks? We are not the majority, but the whole party.&quot; According to his suggestion, the Bolshevik party was renamed the Communist Party of Soviet Union. Since that time, the term Bolshevik has been regarded as obsolete, and relevant only to the pre-Revolutionary times, during the Russian Revolution itself and the Russian Civil War which followed.

==Derogatory usage of &quot;Bolshevik&quot;==
During the days of the [[Cold War]] in the [[United Kingdom]], labour union leaders and other leftists were sometimes derisively described as &quot;Bolshie&quot;. The usage is roughly equivalent to the term &quot;[[Commie]]&quot;, &quot;[[Communist|Red]]&quot; or &quot;[[pinko]]&quot; in the [[United States]] during the same period. [[Adolf Hitler]], Joseph Goebbels and other Nazi leaders used it in reference to the worldwide revolutionary movement coordinated by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;(''Collins Mini Dictionary'', 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Thirteen Years' War}}

The '''Battle of Świecino''' (named for the village of [[Świecino]], near Żarnowiec Lake, northern Poland) also called the '''Battle of [[Żarnowiec]]''' or in German '''Battle of Schwetz''', took place on September 17, 1462 during the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]]. The [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Poles]] commanded by [[Piotr Dunin]], consisting of some 2000 mercenaries decisively defeated the [[Teutonic Knights]], having some 2700 mercenaries, commanded by [[Fritz Raweneck]] and [[Kaspar Nostyc]]. Auxiliary forces sent by duke [[Eric II of Pomerania]], ally of the Polish king, did not enter the battle.

==Polish forces==
The Polish forces consisted of the mercenaries hired by the Polish king, [[Casimir IV of Poland|Casimir IV the Jagiellon]] and the Hanseatic city of Danzig ([[Gdańsk]]). His force consisted of some 1000 cavalry, including 112 heavy cavalry, and another 1000 of infantry. These numbers include 1000 cavalry and 400 infantry were mercenaries hired by Polish king, the rest were units from Danzig.

==Teutonic forces==
Most of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic army]], under the command of Fritz Raweneck and Kaspar Nostyc, were mercenary soldiers gathered from the nearby castles Mewe ([[Gniew]]), Stargard ([[Starogard Gdański]]), [[Nowe]], [[Skarszewy]] and [[Kiszewy]]. This army totalled 1000 cavalry and 400 infantry. Raweneck also had the supply chain ([[tabor (formation)|tabors]]), cannons and up to 1300 auxiliary infantry of Pomeranian peasants, used mainly for fortification works.

==Battle==
The battle started in the evening. Adopting a relatively new tactic, Polish units built a fortified camp on the Hussite model consisting of wagons linked by a chain surrounded by a deep ditch ([[Tabor (formation)|tabor]]). Also, units of Raveneck and his subordinate, Kaspar Nostyc (commander from Conitz ([[Chojnice]]) created tabor. Piotr Dunin decided not to wait for the enemy and attacked first, setting infantry with crossbows at left, defended by cavalry between the tabor and the coast of the nearby lake of Rogoźnica. Raveneck placed cavalry in front of his tabor, and infantry behind it, without any strategic plan. The first phase of the battle was started by a charge of Polish heavy cavalry under Paweł Jasieński. Fierce fighting continued for three hours and ended without a clear winner. After a short pause at midday, Teuton units were able to push the Poles back; however, they found themselves under very heavy fire from crossbows of the Polish infantry, which caused huge losses and withdrawal. During this fight Raveneck was wounded. Raveneck stopped his soldiers and tried to attack again, but this charge ended with total defeat - Raveneck died and the rest of the cavalry surrendered or escaped. The Teuton infantry tried to defend at tabor, but its resistance was broken by a sudden attack of Polish cavalry.

==Casualties==
The Teuton army lost around 1000 soldiers, including some 300 cavalrymen. Fifty soldiers were captured. The Teutonic commander was also killed in battle and was buried in the Żarnowiec chapter church.

The Poles lost just 100 soldiers, but 150 later died from wounds. Among the dead on the Polish side was [[Maciej Hagen]] from Danzig ([[Gdańsk]]). Piotr Dunin was twice wounded.

==Aftermath==
The direct result of the battle of Schwetz/Świecino was that the city of Danzig and Pomerania were freed from Teutonic Order danger so that the royal and municipal armed forces could be used elsewhere in the war, mainly to protect the Vistula waterway and to capture the Teutonic held strongholds. This way that Teutonic forces in Prussia, on the rights bank of Vistula were cut off from the supplies form Western Europe.

The psychological significance was that this was the first open field battle won by the royal forces, so it increased the morale of the Polish forces, and lowered the morale of the Teutonic Knights. Many military historians say that the battle of Schwetz/Świecino was the turning point of the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]], leading to the final victory in 1466.

'''Colin Fulcher''' aka '''Barney Bubbles''' (30 July 1942 - 14 November 1983) was a radical English [[graphic artist]], whose work primarily encompassed the disciplines of [[graphic design]], painting and music video direction. He is most renowned for his distinctive contribution to the graphic design associated with the British independent music scene during the 1970s and early 1980s. His symbol-laden and riddle-laden record sleeves were his most visible output.

==Early life==
Colin Fulcher was born in Tranmere Road, [[Whitton, London|Whitton]], [[Middlesex]] in July 1942 and attended Isleworth Grammar.

In 1958 he embarked on a retail display course for a National Diploma in Design (NDD) in the art school of [[Twickenham College of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Reasons To Be Cheerful]]: The Life &amp; Work Of Barney Bubbles, Paul Gorman (Adelita 2008) ISBN 978-0955201738&lt;/ref&gt; During his five years at the college Fulcher received a multi-disciplinary education which included training in cardboard design, display and packaging (exploited later in his record sleeve work).

==Initial career==
After leaving college in 1963, Colin Fulcher started his career as an assistant at design company Michael Tucker + Associates, London,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Life 2010&quot;&gt;[[Reasons To Be Cheerful]]: The Life &amp; Work Of Barney Bubbles, 2nd edition, Paul Gorman (Adelita 2010) ISBN 978-0955201745&lt;/ref&gt; whose clients included [[Pirelli]]. In a rare interview,&lt;ref&gt;[[The Face]]: November 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Bubbles described Tucker's discipline as &quot;very Swiss; very hard; unjustified; very grey. He taught me everything about typography&quot;. Tucker's studio produced the posters for [[Hugh Hudson]]'s 1967 Pirelli-sponsored film The Tortoise &amp; The Hare (for which Fulcher designed the poster lettering on a freelance basis).&lt;ref name=&quot;The Life 2010&quot;/&gt;

In May 1965 Fulcher was recruited by The Conran Group as senior graphic designer alongside such designers as [[Stafford Cliff]], [[Virginia Clive-Smith]] and [[John Muggeridge]]. Here he produced a variety of commercial designs, including the Norman archer logo for [[Strongbow cider]] and items for Conran's new homewares chain [[Habitat]]. Fulcher also established an association with Conran director [[Justin de Blank]] which blossomed when de Blank exited to launch his upmarket provisions company and restaurant business in 1968.

==Transitionary Period==

In 1965-66 Fulcher organised 'happenings' and parties/events under the name ''A1 Good Guyz'' with fellow Twickenham art college students [[David Wills]] and [[Roy Burge]]. 

From 1967 he began changing his name to Barney Bubbles and, with friends, operated a light show for bands such as [[The Gun (band)|The Gun]] and [[Quintessence (English band)|Quintessence]] at underground venues such as [[The Roundhouse]] in Chalk Farm, [[Jim Haynes]]' Drury Lane [[Arts Lab]], The Electric Cinema and Middle Earth. 

With Wills, Bubbles undertook freelance design commissions, including a redesign of ''Motor Racing'' magazine and a recipe book for the ''English Egg Marketing Board''. They also created [[Oz (magazine)|Oz]] magazine issue 12 ''The Tax Dodge Special'' (published May 1968), involving a wider network of friends and associates.

In the summer of 1968 Bubbles visited the west coast of the [[United States]].

==Teenburger Designs==
[[Image:Brinsleyschwarzeponymous.jpg|thumb|right|The original UK LP sleeve of [[Brinsley Schwarz]] � ''[[Brinsley Schwarz]]'' designed by Barney Bubbles]]

Early in 1969 Bubbles took the lease on the three-storey building 307 Portobello Road in Notting Hill Gate, west London. He converted the ground floor retail space into a design studio christened Teenburger Designs. With a business association established with entrepreneurs Edward Molton and Stephen Warwick, and with [[John Muggeridge]] from Conran as a short-lived assistant, he set about working primarily for the music industry. Bubbles' first record sleeve design was [[Quintessence (English band)|Quintessence]]'s 1969 LP ''In Blissful Company''. The gatefold sleeve design uses illustrations by 'Gopala' on the front and back, and contains a monochrome glued-in booklet inside.

Teenburger also provided record sleeve designs for the bands [[Brinsley Schwarz]] and [[Red Dirt]], as well as [[Vertigo Records|Vertigo]] label artists [[Cressida (progressive rock band)|Cressida]], [[Gracious!]] and Dr Z (whose ''Three Parts To My Soul'' LP is particularly noted for its complex and colourful fold-out sleeve).

Between 1970 and 1972 Bubbles also worked as the designer of underground newspaper [[Friends (magazine)|Friends]] (later re-named Frendz).&lt;ref&gt;Days in the Life: Voices from the English Underground, 1961-1971, Jonathon Green (Pimlico 1998) ISBN 978-0712666657&lt;/ref&gt; 

During this period he gained a reputation for his drug consumption,&lt;ref&gt;[[Eye (magazine)|Eye]], June 1992&lt;/ref&gt; particularly LSD, which informed his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]: Greatest Album Covers, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hawkwind (and other 1970s Rock)==
[[Image:In Search of Space - Hawkwind.jpg|thumb|left|The original UK LP sleeve of [[Hawkwind]] � ''[[X in Search of Space]]'' designed by Barney Bubbles]]

On the collapse of Teenburger (as a result of Moulton and Warwick's disappearance) Bubbles formed one of the richest associations of his career with [[Hawkwind]]. 

Responsible for their album sleeves (including ''[[X in Search of Space]]'', ''[[Doremi Fasol Latido]]'' and ''[[Space Ritual]]''), Bubbles engaged in every aspect of realising the group's visual identity: titling releases and designing posters, adverts, stage decoration and performance plans, all of which were adorned with mystical and mock-Teutonic insignia. 

In 1972 Bubbles also produced the triple LP package [[Glastonbury Fayre]] comprising a six-panel fold-out sleeve, two poster inserts, booklet and a cut-out and build miniature pyramid, housed in a clear vinyl bag (with two sleeve variations and three label variations).

During this period (1972–1975), Bubbles designed album sleeves and additional material for such acts as The [[Sutherland Brothers]], [[Kevin Coyne]], [[Edgar Broughton Band]], [[Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers]], [[Quiver (Rock band)|Quiver]], the [[Kursaal Flyers]] and [[Michael Moorcock|Michael Moorcock and the Deep Fix]]. 

In 1976, Bubbles' design relationship with Hawkwind came to an end, rekindled briefly in 1978 for [[Hawklords]], and continued via his friendship with Hawkwind's saxophonist player [[Nik Turner]].

From 1976, Bubbles avoided crediting himself on artwork, working either anonymously or using additional pseudonyms.

==Stiff, Radar and F Beat (and other Punk and New Wave)==
[[Image:Carlenecest.jpg|thumb|right|The original UK LP sleeve of [[Carlene Carter]] � ''[[C'est C Bon]] '' designed by Barney Bubbles]]
Barney Bubbles joined [[Stiff Records]] as designer and art director early in 1977. 

With the label's co-founder [[Jake Riviera]], Bubbles generated a body of creative work which helped secure Stiff's reputation as an exciting new independent label. Bubbles created sleeves for bands including [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Ian Dury]] and [[Wreckless Eric]]. Often these were accompanied by quirky logos (such as the [[Ian Dury#The Blockheads|Blockhead]] 'face' which may have been based on the 40s [[Left Book Club]] ideogram), adverts and promotional items. 

For example, the marketing of [[Elvis Costello]]'s ''[[My Aim Is True]]'' included adverts in three UK music papers from which a poster of Costello could be constructed, and the first 1000 pressings contained a ''Help Us Hype Elvis'' insert which if completed and returned to Stiff ensured a friend would received a free copy (something which generated attention not only from the public, but also from the music press itself).

When Riviera left Stiff in the autumn of 1977, Bubbles joined him at new label [[Radar Records]] and later at Riviera's [[F-Beat Records]]. Bubbles created designs for artists such as [[Elvis Costello]], [[Nick Lowe]], [[Carlene Carter]] and [[Clive Langer]] &amp; The Boxes. 

Meantime, Bubbles also maintained his freelance output, not only continuing to produce designs for Stiff, but also for [[Peter Jenner]] ([[Ian Dury]] and [[Billy Bragg]]'s manager), and others, creating a prodigious output by working for such bands, musicians and performers as [[Vivian Stanshall]], [[Generation X]], [[Big Star]], [[Johnny Moped]], [[Whirlwind]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Clover (band)|Clover]], [[The Sinceros]], [[Roger Chapman]], [[Phillip Goodhand-Tait]], [[Dr. Feelgood]], [[Inner City Unit]] and [[The Psychedelic Furs]]. As a result, Bubbles' work appeared on releases by labels such as Aura, [[Chiswick]], [[Utility]], [[Go! Discs]], [[Epic Records|Epic]], [[Charisma]], [[CBS]], [[Line Records]], [[United Artists Records|United Artists]] and [[Riddle Records]].

Bubbles' signature style emerged as one that was colourful, playful, loaded with geometry, shape, art-history and music-history reference, jokes, cryptograms and symbolism. The over-riding appetite was for going against the grain of accepted design standards. His work is simultaneously complex (loaded with meaning) and simple and direct (in its delivery). 

Examples include:

* [[Elvis Costello]] - ''[[This Year's Model]]''; which was designed to have a deliberate mis-cropping so the entire design was off-register.
* [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] - ''[[Damned Damned Damned]]''; a limited number of which were deliberately printed with a photo of Eddie and the Hot Rods on the back of the album cover, rather than The Damned playing at The Roxy Club. An 'erratum' sticker was put on the back cover apologizing for this 'mistake', and on the front of the LP - on top of the original shrinkwrap - was a red 'food-fight' sticker that says 'Damned Damned', thus completing the LP title when read underneath the band's name.
* Elvis Costello - ''[[Armed Forces (album)|Armed Forces]]''; with an extended back panel consisting of folding flaps, this included postcards which carried the instruction ''DON'T JOIN'' (advice against joining the armed forces, and simultaneously a message that these postcards had been die-cut away from the rest of the sleeve).
* [[Ian Dury and the Blockheads]] - ''[[Do It Yourself (Ian Dury)|Do It Yourself]]''; which was released in 28 sleeve variations, all of which were wallpaper designs supplied by manufacturer [[Crown Wallpaper|Crown]].

==Music promo videos==
As a video director, Barney Bubbles directed several videos. These included [[The Specials]]' &quot;[[Ghost Town]]&quot;, [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]]'s &quot;[[Is That Love]]&quot; and &quot;[[Tempted (Squeeze song)|Tempted]]&quot;, [[Elvis Costello]]'s &quot;[[Clubland]]&quot; and &quot;[[New Lace Sleeves]]&quot; and [[Fun Boy Three]]'s &quot;[[The Lunatics (Have Taken Over the Asylum)]]&quot;. Two promos for punk act [[Johnny Moped]] - &quot;Incendiary Device&quot; and &quot;Darling Let's Have Another Baby&quot; - were never commercially released to broadcasters.

==Other work==
In 1978 Barney Bubbles was responsible for the redesign of weekly music paper the [[NME]], including a new logo design (which is no longer in use).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vinmag.com/online/gbu0-display/nme.html|title=NME The Inside Story|accessdate=16 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080513215310/http://www.vinmag.com/online/gbu0-display/nme.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, [[Derek Boshier]] curated an exhibition entitled Lives at the [[Hayward Gallery]], London. He commissioned Barney Bubbles to design the catalogue and poster. Together with photographer [[Chris Gabrin]], Barney Bubbles exhibited a video and mixed-media installation in the exhibition.

In the early 1980s Barney Bubbles created furniture designs, some of which were featured in [[The Face (magazine)|The Face]], November 1981, and in 1982 he recorded the album ''Ersatz'' with [[Nik Turner]] and other members of [[Inner City Unit]], under the name The Imperial Pompadours.

Barney Bubbles had always painted privately, increasingly so in the early 1980s.

==Death==
Barney Bubbles committed [[suicide]] in London on 14 November 1983. At this period in time he had considerable personal and financial worries. His sleeves were being rejected by musicians such as Elvis Costello, and record companies, and he was being chased by Inland Revenue for unpaid taxes dating back many years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sleep Till Canvey Island 2000&quot;&gt;No Sleep Till Canvey Island: The Great Pub Rock Revolution, Will Birch (Virgin Books 2000, 2003) ISBN 0-7535-0740-4&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered from [[bipolar disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;Carol Clerk.

SAF Publishing Ltd, 2004, ISBN 0946719691&lt;/ref&gt; and experienced increasingly frequent bouts of depression and erratic behaviour, for example, close friends have recounted him lacerating his face with razorblades and making threats to kill.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; He committed suicide on his late parents' wedding anniversary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sleep Till Canvey Island 2000&quot;/&gt;

==Influence and legacy==
The first exhibition examining Barney Bubbles was staged at Artomatic, London in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sleep Till Canvey Island 2000&quot;/&gt; This was curated and designed by the art-design team Rebecca And Mike.&lt;ref&gt;http://showstudio.com/contributors/333&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of [[Paul Gorman]]'s biography ''Reasons to be Cheerful: The Life &amp; Work Of Barney Bubbles'' was published in 2008 and a revised second edition was published in 2010. A US edition is planned for spring 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reasons To Be Cheerful]]: The Life &amp; Work Of Barney Bubbles, Paul Gorman (Adelita 2010) ISBN 978-0955201738&lt;/ref&gt; Gorman also curated the exhibition ''Process: The working practices of Barney Bubbles'' at London gallery Chelsea Space between September 14 and October 23, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/13/arts/13iht-design13.html|title=A Global Celebration of Design | work=The New York Times | first=Alice|last=Rawsthorn|date=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Basic English''', also known as '''Simple English''', is an [[English language|English]]-based  [[controlled language]] created (in essence as a simplified subset of English) by linguist and philosopher [[Charles Kay Ogden]] as an [[international auxiliary language]], and as an aid for teaching [[ESL|English as a Second Language]]. It was presented in Ogden's book ''Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar'' (1930). Capitalised, ''BASIC'' is sometimes taken as an [[acronym]] that stands for ''British American Scientific International Commercial''.&lt;ref&gt;Brutt-Griffler, Evans Davies, English and Ethnicity, Palgrave Macmillan,2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Ogden's Basic, and the concept of a simplified English, gained its greatest publicity just after the Allied victory in the [[Second World War]] as a means for world peace. Although Basic English was not built into a program, similar simplifications have been devised for various international uses. Ogden's associate [[I. A. Richards]] promoted its use in schools in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,886748,00.html Time Magazine. Dec. 31, 1945. ''Education: Globalingo'']&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has influenced the creation of [[Voice of America]]'s [[Special English]] for news broadcasting, and [[Simplified English]], another English-based controlled language designed to write technical manuals.

What survives today of Ogden's Basic English is the basic 850-word list used as the beginner's vocabulary of the English language taught worldwide, especially in [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmond H Weiss ''The Elements of International English Style'', pp. 17-18, M. E. Sharpe, 2005 ISBN 978-0765615725&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design principles ==
Ogden tried to simplify English while keeping it normal for native speakers, by specifying grammar restrictions and a controlled small vocabulary which makes an extensive use of [[Paraphrase|paraphrasis]]. Most notably, Ogden allowed only 18 verbs, which he called &quot;operators&quot;.  His ''General Introduction'' says &quot;There are no 'verbs' in Basic English&quot;, with the underlying assumption that, as noun use in English is very straightforward but verb use/conjugation is not, the elimination of verbs would be a welcome simplification.&lt;ref&gt;A good summary in Bill Templer: ''Towards a People's English: Back to BASIC in EIL'' [http://www.hltmag.co.uk/sep05/mart05.htm#C5 Humanising Language Teaching].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Word lists ==
Ogden's word lists include only word ''roots'', which in practice are extended with the defined set of affixes and the full set of forms allowed for any available word (noun, pronoun, or the limited set of verbs).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ogden.basic-english.org/wordthere.html the list of words which are assumed and not counted] for details.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 850 core words of Basic English are found in Wiktionary's ''[[wikt:Appendix:Basic English word list|Appendix:Basic English word list]]''. This core is theoretically enough for everyday life. However, Ogden prescribed that any student should learn an additional 150 word list for everyday work in some particular field, by adding a word list of 100 words particularly useful in a general field (e.g., science, verse, business, etc.), along with a 50-word list from a more specialised subset of that general field, to make a basic 1000 word vocabulary for everyday work and life.

Moreover, Ogden assumed that any student already should be familiar with (and thus may only review) a core subset of around 350 &quot;international&quot; words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogden.basic-english.org/wordalpi.html Ogden's &quot;International Word&quot; List - Alphabetic]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a first level student should graduate with a core vocabulary of around 1350 words. A realistic general core vocabulary could contain 1500 words (the core 850 words, plus 350 international words, and 300 words for the general fields of trade, economics, and science). A [[:simple:BE 1500|sample 1500 word]] vocabulary is included in the [[:simple:|Simple English Wikipedia]].

Ogden provided lists to extend the general 1500 vocabulary to make a 2000 word list, enough for a &quot;standard&quot; English level.&lt;ref&gt; [http://ogden.basic-english.org/wordalpn.html Ogden's Basic English Next Steps]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogden.basic-english.org/word2000.html Ogden's Basic English Combined Word Lists]&lt;/ref&gt; This 2000 word vocabulary represents &quot;what any learner should know&quot;. At this level students could start to move on their own.

== Rules ==
''Also see [[:simple:Wikipedia:Basic English ordered wordlist|Basic English ordered wordlist]] from [[Wikipedia:Simple English Wikipedia|Simple English Wikipedia]].''

The [[grammar|word use]] of Basic English is similar to full English, but the rules are much simpler, and there are fewer [[wikt:exception|exceptions]]. Not all meanings of each word are allowed.

Ogden's rules of [[grammar]] for Basic English help people use the 850 words to talk about things and events in a normal way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Rules of Grammar | url = http://ogden.basic-english.org/rules.html | date = January 1, 1996 | accessdate = 2009-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Make plurals with an &quot;S&quot; on the end of the word. If there are special ways to make a plural word, such as &quot;ES&quot; and &quot;IES&quot;, use them.
#There are two word endings to change each of the 150 adjectives:  -&quot;ER&quot; and -&quot;EST&quot;.
#There are two word endings to change the verb word endings, -&quot;ING&quot; and -&quot;ED&quot;.
#Make qualifiers from adverbs by adding -&quot;LY&quot;.
#Talk about amounts with &quot;MORE&quot; and &quot;MOST.&quot;  Use and know -&quot;ER&quot; and -&quot;EST.&quot;
#Make opposite adjectives with &quot;UN&quot;-
#Make questions with the opposite word order, and with &quot;DO&quot;.
#Operators and pronouns conjugate as in normal English.
#Make [[Wikipedia:Basic English compound wordlist|combined words]] ([[compound word|compound]]s) from two nouns (for example &quot;milkman&quot;) or a noun and a directive (sundown).
#Measures, numbers, money, days, months, years, clock time, and international words are in English forms.  E.g. Date/Time: 20 May 1972 at 21:00
#Use the words of an industry or science.  For example, in this grammar, some special words are for teaching languages, and not part of Basic English: [[plural]], [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]], [[noun]], [[adjective]], [[adverb]], [[qualifier]], [[verb|operator]], [[pronoun]], and [[directive]].

== Criticism ==
Like all [[international auxiliary language]]s (or IALs), Basic English may be criticised as unavoidably based on personal preferences, and thus, paradoxically, inherently divisive.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Harrison, ''[http://www.rickharrison.com/language/farewell.html Farewell to Auxiliary Languages]''&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, like all natural language based IALs, Basic is subject to criticism as unfairly biased towards the native speaker community.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, a sample quotation from [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0512A&amp;L=AUXLANG&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=2560 the auxlang mailing list archives] and another from noted linguist [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.]].&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teaching aid for [[ESL|English as a Second Language]], Basic English has been criticised for the choice of the core vocabulary and for its grammatical constraints.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, by proponents of Essential World English. See [http://www.langmaker.com/outpost/eswldeng.htm a summary of EWE] for instance and, again, the linguist [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, [[readability]] expert [[Rudolf Flesch]] published an article in [[Harpers]], &quot;How Basic is Basic English?&quot; in which he claimed, &quot;It's not basic, and it's not English.&quot; The basic complaint was that the vocabulary is too restricted, and, as a result, the text ends up being awkward and more difficult than necessary. He also notes that the words in the Basic vocabulary were arbitrarily selected, and there have been no empirical studies showing that it makes language simpler.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flesch&quot;&gt;Flesch, R. F. 1944. &quot;How Basic is Basic English?&quot; ''Harpers,'' March. pp. 339-343.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary references ==
In the novel ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'', published in 1933, [[H.G. Wells]] depicted Basic English as the [[lingua franca]] of a new elite which after a prolonged struggle succeeds in uniting the world and establishing a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[world government]]. In the future world of Wells' vision, virtually all members of humanity know this language.

From 1942 to 1944 [[George Orwell]] was a proponent of Basic English, but in 1945 he became critical of [[universal language]]s. Basic English later inspired his use of [[Newspeak]] in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Illich |first=Ivan |authorlink=Ivan Illich |coauthors=Barry Sanders |title=ABC: The Alphabetization of the Popular Mind |year=1988 |publisher=[[North Point Press]] |location=[[San Francisco]] |language=[[English language]] |isbn=0-86547-291-2 |pages=109 |quote=The satirical force with which Orwell used Newspeak to serve as his portrait of one of those totalitarian ideas that he saw taking root in the minds of intellectuals everywhere can be understood only if we remember that he speaks with shame about a belief that he formerly held... From 1942 to 1944, working as a colleague of William Empson's, he produced a series of broadcasts to India written in Basic English, trying to use its programmed simplicity, as a ''Tribune'' article put it, &quot;as a sort of corrective to the oratory of statesmen and publicists.&quot; Only during the last year of the war did he write &quot;Politics and the English Language,&quot; insisting that the defense of English language has nothing to do with the setting up of a Standard English.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his story &quot;[[Gulf (Heinlein)|Gulf]]&quot;, science fiction writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]] used a [[constructed language]], in which every Basic English word is replaced with a single [[phoneme]], as an appropriate means of communication for a race of genius supermen.&lt;ref&gt;Heinlein, Robert A., &quot;Gulf&quot;, in ''Assignment in Eternity'', published by Signet Science Fiction (New American Library), 1953. Page 52-53: &quot;It was possible to establish a one-to-one relationship with Basic English so that ''one phonetic symbol'' was equivalent to an entire word&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''brass instrument''' is a [[musical instrument]] whose sound is produced by [[Sympathetic resonance|sympathetic vibration]] of air in a tubular [[resonator]] in sympathy with the vibration of the player's lips. Brass instruments are also called ''labrosones'', literally meaning &quot;lip-vibrated instruments&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

There are several factors involved in producing different [[Pitch of brass instruments|pitches on a brass instrument]]: One is alteration of the player's lip tension (or &quot;[[embouchure]]&quot;), and another is air flow. Also, slides (or [[valve]]s) are used to change the length of the tubing, thus changing the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] presented by the instrument to the player.

The view of most scholars (see [[organology]]) is that the term &quot;brass instrument&quot; should be defined by the way the sound is made, as above, and not by whether the instrument is actually made of [[brass]]. Thus, as exceptional cases one finds brass instruments made of wood, like the [[alphorn]], the [[cornett]], the [[Serpent (instrument)|serpent]] and the [[didgeridoo]], while some [[woodwind instrument]]s are made of brass, like the [[saxophone]].

== Families of brass instruments ==
Modern brass instruments generally come in one of two families:
*'''Valved''' brass instruments use a set of valves (typically three or four but as many as seven or more in some cases) operated by the player's fingers that introduce additional tubing, or [[Crook (music)|crooks]], into the instrument, changing its overall length. This family includes all of the modern brass instruments except the [[trombone]]: the [[trumpet]], [[horn (instrument)|horn]] (also called the [[French horn]]), [[euphonium]], and [[tuba]], as well as the [[cornet]], [[flügelhorn]], [[tenor horn|tenor horn (alto horn)]], [[baritone horn]], [[sousaphone]], [[mellophone]], and the old [[saxhorn]]. As valved instruments are predominant among the brasses today, a more thorough discussion of their workings can be found below. The valves are usually piston valves, but can be rotary valves. [[Rotary valves]] are the norm for the [[horn (instrument)|horn]] and are also prevalent on the [[tuba]].

*'''Slide''' brass instruments use a slide to change the length of tubing. The main instruments in this category are the [[trombone]] family, though valve trombones are occasionally used, especially in [[jazz]]. The trombone family's ancestor, the [[sackbut]], and the folk instrument [[Bazooka (instrument)|bazooka]] are also in the slide family.

There are two other families that have, in general, become functionally obsolete for practical purposes. Instruments of both types, however, are sometimes used for [[historically informed performance|period-instrument performances]] of Baroque- or Classical-era pieces. In more modern compositions, they are occasionally used for their intonation or tone color.

*'''Natural''' brass instruments, on which only notes in the instrument's [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] are available. Such instruments include the [[bugle (instrument)|bugle]] and older variants of the [[trumpet]] and [[Horn (instrument)|horn]]. The [[natural trumpet|trumpet was a natural brass instrument]] prior to about 1795, and the [[natural horn|horn before about 1820]]. In the 18th century different-length interchangeable [[Crook (music)|crooks]] were developed which enabled a single instrument to be used for more than one key. Natural instruments are still played for period performances and some ceremonial functions, and are occasionally found in more modern scores, such as those by [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Richard Strauss]].

*'''Keyed or Fingered''' brass instruments used holes along the body of the instrument, which were covered by fingers or by finger-operated pads (keys) in a similar way to a [[woodwind instrument]]. These included the [[cornett]], [[serpent (instrument)|serpent]], [[ophicleide]], [[keyed bugle]] and [[keyed trumpet]]. They are more difficult to play than valved instruments.

=== Bore taper and diameter ===
Brass instruments may also be characterised by two generalizations about geometry of the [[bore (wind instruments)|bore]], that is, the tubing between the mouthpiece and the flaring of the tubing into the [[Bell_(wind)#Parts|bell]]. Those two generalizations are with regard to
* the degree of taper or conicity of the bore and
* the diameter of the bore with respect to its length.

==== Cylindricality vs. conicality ====
While all modern valved and slide brass instruments consist in part of conical and in part of cylindrical tubing, they are divided as follows:

*'''Cylindrical bore''' brass instruments are those in which approximately constant diameter tubing predominates. Cylindrical bore brass instruments are generally perceived as having a brighter, more penetrating tone quality compared to conical bore brass instruments. The [[trumpet]], [[baritone horn]] and all [[trombone]]s are cylindrical bore. In particular, the slide design of the trombone necessitates this.

*'''Conical bore''' brass instruments are those in which tubing of constantly increasing diameter predominates. Conical bore instruments are generally perceived as having a more mellow tone quality than the cylindrical bore brass instruments. The &quot;[[Brass band (British style)|British brass band]]&quot; group of instruments fall into this category. This includes the [[flugelhorn]], [[cornet]], [[alto horn|tenor horn (alto horn)]], [[horn (instrument)|horn]], [[euphonium]] and [[tuba]]. Some conical bore brass instruments are more conical than others. For example, the flugelhorn differs from the cornet by having a higher percentage of its tubing length conical than does the cornet, in addition to possessing a wider bore than the cornet. In the 1910s and 1920s, the [[E.A. Couturier]] company built brass band instruments utilizing a patent for a continuous conical bore without cylindrical portions even for the valves or tuning slide.

==== Whole-tube vs. half-tube ====
The second division, that based on bore diameter in relation to the length,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Bombardon 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica article on the Bombardon]&lt;/ref&gt; determines whether it is the [[fundamental frequency|fundamental tone]] or the first [[overtone]] which is the lowest [[Harmonic series (music)#Harmonic_vs._partial|partial]] practically available to the player:
{{rquote|right|Neither the horns nor the trumpet could produce the 1st note of the harmonic series ... A horn giving the C of an open 8&amp;nbsp;ft organ pipe had to be {{convert|16|ft|0|abbr=on}}. long. Half its length was practically useless ... it was found that if the calibre of tube was sufficiently enlarged in proportion to its length, the instrument could be relied upon to give its fundamental note in all normal circumstances. - Cecil Forsyth, ''Orchestration'', p. 86 &lt;ref name=&quot;Forsyth_Orchestration&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books/download/ORCHESTRATION.pdf?id=m9_CTe8qNWIC&amp;output=pdf ''Orchestration''], Forsyth, Cecil; MacMillan Books, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

*'''Whole-tube''' instruments are ones in which the fundamental tone can be played with ease and precision. Their bore is the larger with relation to the length of the tubing. The [[tuba]] and the [[euphonium]] are instances of whole-tube brass instruments.

*'''Half-tube''' instruments are ones in which the fundamental tone cannot easily or accurately be played. Their bore is the smaller with relation to the length of the tubing. The second partial (first overtone) is the lowest note of each tubing length practical to play on half-tube instruments. The [[trumpet]] and [[Horn (instrument)|horn]] are instances of half-tube brass instruments.

=== Some other brass instruments ===
The instruments in this list fall for various reasons outside the scope of much of the discussion above regarding families of brass instruments.
* [[Alphorn]] ([[wood]])
* [[Conch]] ([[animal shell|shell]])
* [[Didgeridoo]] ([[wood]], [[Australia]])
* [[Natural horn]] (no valves or slides—except tuning crook)
* [[Keyed bugle]] (keyed brass)
* [[Keyed trumpet]] (keyed brass)
* [[Serpent (instrument)|Serpent]] (keyed brass)
* [[Ophicleide]] (keyed brass)
* [[Shofar]] ([[horn (anatomy)|animal horn]])
* [[Vladimirskiy rozhok]] ([[wood]], [[Russia]])
* [[Vuvuzela]] (simple short horn, origins disputed but achieved fame or notoriety through many [[plastic]] examples in the [[2010 World Cup]])

Valves are used to change the length of tubing of a brass instrument allowing the player to reach the notes of various harmonic series. Each valve pressed diverts the air stream through additional tubing, individually or in conjunction with other valves. This lengthens the vibrating air column thus lowering the fundamental tone and associated harmonic series produced by the instrument. Designs exist, although rare, in which this behaviour is reversed, i.e., pressing a valve removes a length of tubing rather than adding one.  One modern example of such an ascending valve is the Yamaha YSL-350C trombone,&lt;ref name=&quot;YSL-350C&quot;/&gt; in which the extra valve tubing is normally engaged to pitch the instrument in Bb, and pressing the thumb lever removes a whole step to pitch the instrument in C.  Valves incidentally require regular [[Valve oil|lubrication]].

A core standard valve layout based on the action of three valves had become almost universal by (at latest) 1864 as witnessed by [[Arban method|Arban's Method]] published in that year. The effect of a particular combination of valves may be seen in the table below. This table is correct for the core 3-valve layout on almost any modern valved brass instrument. The most common four-valve layout is a superset of the well-established 3-valve layout and is noted in the table, despite the exposition of four-valve and also five-valve systems (the latter used on the [[tuba]]) being incomplete in this article.

: * Note that since valves ''lower'' the pitch, a valve which causes a pitch to be too low (flat) creates an interval which is wider than desired, while a valve which causes sharp pitches creates an interval which is narrower than desired.

Deficiencies in the [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] of brass instruments which are independent of the tuning or temperament system in use are inherent in the physics of the most popular valve design, which uses a small number of valves in combination to avoid redundant and heavy lengths of tubing&lt;ref&gt;[http://music.ou.edu/applied/horn/intonation.html Understanding Brass Instrument Intonation], University of Oklahoma Horn Studio&lt;/ref&gt; (this is entirely separate from the slight deficiencies between [[Classical music|Western music's]] dominant [[Equal temperament|equal (even) temperament system]] and the [[Just intonation|just (not equal) temperament]] of the harmonic series itself). Since each lengthening of the tubing has an inversely proportional effect on pitch ([[Pitch of brass instruments]]), while pitch perception is logarithmic, there is no way for a simple, uncompensated addition of length to be correct in every combination when compared with the pitches of the open tubing and the other valves.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/brassacoustics.html#valves&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, given a length of tubing equaling 100&amp;nbsp;inches when open, one may obtain the following tuning discrepancies:

Playing notes using valves (notably 1st + 3rd and 1st + 2nd + 3rd) requires [[#Valve tuning compensation|compensation]] to adjust the tuning appropriately, either by the player's lip-and-breath control, via mechanical assistance of some sort, or, in the case of horns, by the position of the stopping hand in the bell.

=== Valve tuning compensation ===
The additional tubing for each valve usually features a short tuning slide of its own for fine adjustment of the valve's tuning, except when it is too short to make this practicable. For the first and third valves this is often designed to be adjusted as the instrument is played, to account for the deficiencies in the valve system.

In most trumpets and cornets, the compensation must be provided by extending the third valve slide with the third or fourth finger, and the first valve slide with the left hand thumb (see [[#Trigger_or_throw|Trigger or throw]] below). This is used to lower the pitch of the 1-3 and 1-2-3 valve combinations. On the trumpet and cornet, these valve combinations correspond to low D, low C{{music|♯}}, low G, and low F{{music|♯}}, so chromatically, to stay in tune, one must use this method.

In instruments with a fourth valve, such as [[tuba]]s, [[euphonium]]s, [[horn (instrument)|horn]]s, [[piccolo trumpet]]s, etc. that valve lowers the pitch by a perfect fourth; this is used to compensate for the sharpness of the valve combinations 1-3 and 1-2-3 (4 replaces 1-3, 2-4 replaces 1-2-3). All three normal valves may be used in addition to the fourth to increase the instrument's range downwards by a perfect fourth, although with increasingly severe [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] problems.

When four-valved models without any kind of compensation play in the corresponding register, the sharpness becomes so severe that players must finger the note a half-step below the one they are trying to play. This eliminates the note a half-step above their open fundamental.

Manufacturers of low brass instruments may choose one or a combination of four basic approaches to compensate for the tuning difficulties, whose respective merits are subject to debate:

==== Compensation system ====
In the Compensation system, each of the first two (or three) valves has an additional set of tubing extending from the back of the valve. When the third (or fourth) valve is depressed in combination with another one, the air is routed through both the usual set of tubing plus the extra one, so that the pitch is lowered by an appropriate amount. This allows compensating instruments to play with accurate intonation in the octave below their open second partial, which is critical for tubas and euphoniums in much of their repertoire. 

The compensating system was applied to horns to serve a different purpose. It was used to allow a double horn in F and B flat to ease playing difficulties in the high register. In contrast to the system in use in tubas and euphoniums, the default 'side' of the horn is the longer F horn, with secondary lengths of tubing coming into play when the first, second or third valves are pressed; pressing the thumb valve takes these secondary valve slides and the extra length of main tubing out of play to produce a shorter B-flat horn. A later &quot;full double&quot; design has completely separate valve section tubing for the two sides, and is considered superior, although rather heavier in weight.

==== Additional valves ====
Initially, compensated instruments tended to sound stuffy and blow less freely due to the air being doubled back through the main valves. In early designs, this led to sharp bends in the tubing and other obstructions of the air-flow. Some manufacturers therefore preferred adding more 'straight' valves instead, which for example could be pitched a little lower than the 2nd and 1st valves and were intended to be used instead of these in the respective valve combinations. While no longer featured in euphoniums for decades, professional tubas are still built like this, with five valves being the norm on CC- and BB{{music|♭}}-tubas and five or six valves on F-tubas.

Compensating double horns can also suffer from the stuffiness resulting from the air being passed through the valve section twice, but as this really only affects the longer F side, a compensating double can be very useful for a 1st or 3rd horn player, who uses the F side less.

==== Additional sets of slides on each valve ====
Another approach was the addition of two sets of slides for different parts of the range. There used to be euphoniums and tubas built like this, but today, this approach has become highly exotic for all instruments - except [[Horn (instrument)|horn]]s for which it is the norm, usually in a double, sometimes even triple configuration.

==== Trigger or throw ====
'''Triggers''' or '''throws''' are sometimes provided on valved brass instruments to allow during performance the manual lengthening (or, less commonly, shortening) of the main tuning slide, a valve slide, or the main tubing. These mechanisms are used to alter the pitch of notes that are naturally sharp in a specific register of the instrument, or to shift the instrument to another playing range. As such, triggers and throws and are designed for speedy adjustment while playing.

Trigger is used in two senses:

*A trigger can be a mechanical lever that lengthens a slide when pressed in a contrary direction. Triggers are sprung in such a way to that they return the slide to its original position when released.
*The term &quot;trigger&quot; is also used to describe the device lengthening certain brass instruments' main length of tubing to shift its range to another playing range, as is the case with [[#Trombone|certain trombones]].

A throw is a simple metal grip for the player's finger or thumb, attached to a valve slide. The general term &quot;throw&quot; can be used to describe a u-hook, a saddle (u-shaped grips), or a ring (ring-shape grip) in which a player's finger or thumb rests. A player extends their finger or thumb to lengthen a slide, and retracts their finger to return the slide to its original position.

Some examples of instruments that utilize triggers or throws are:

=====Trumpet or cornet=====
Triggers or throws are sometimes found on the first valve slide. They are operated by the player's thumb and are used to adjust a large range of notes using the first valve, most notably the player's written top line F, the A above directly above that, and the B{{music|♭}} above that. Other notes that require the first valve slide, but are not as problematic with out it include the first line E, the F above that, the A above that, and the third line B{{music|♭}}.

Triggers or throws are often found on the third valve slide. They are operated by the player's fourth finger, and are used to adjust the lower D and C{{music|#}}. Trumpets typically use throws, whilst cornets may have a throw or trigger.

=====Trombone=====
[[Trombone]] triggers are primarily but not exclusively&lt;ref name=&quot;YSL-350C&quot;&gt;[http://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/ContentDetail/ModelSeriesDetail.html?CNTID=2265&amp;CTID=242600 Yamaha Catalog YSL-350C] with ascending Bb/C rotor&lt;/ref&gt; installed on the F-trigger, bass, and contrabass trombones&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/List/ModelSeriesListHE.html?CTID=242800 Yamaha Catalog &quot;Professional Trombones&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; to alter the length of tubing, thus making certain ranges and pitches more accessible.

=====Euphoniums=====
A [[euphonium]] occasionally has a trigger on valves other than 2 (especially 3), although many professional quality [[euphoniums]], and indeed other brass band instruments, have a trigger for the main tuning slide.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Besson]] Prestige [http://www.besson.com/en/instruments.php?mode=productDetails&amp;pid=42 euphonium].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Valve mechanism ===
The two major types of valve mechanisms are ''[[rotary valve]]s'' and ''[[piston valve]]s''.  The first piston valve instruments were developed just after the start of the 19th century. The ''Stölzel valve'' (invented by [[Heinrich Stölzel]] in 1814) was an early variety. In the mid 19th century the ''Vienna valve'' was an improved design. However many professional musicians preferred rotary valves for quicker, more reliable action, until better designs of piston valves were mass manufactured towards the end of the 19th century. Since the early decades of the 20th century, piston valves have been the most common on brass instruments except for the orchestral [[Horn (instrument)|horn]] and the [[tuba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.public.asu.edu/~jqerics/about_articles.htm The Early Valved Horn] by John Q. Ericson, Associate Professor of horn at Arizona State University&lt;/ref&gt; See also the article [[Brass Instrument Valves]].

==Sound production in brass instruments==
Because the player of a brass instrument has direct control of the [[prime vibrator]] (the lips), brass instruments exploit the player's ability to select the [[harmonic]] at which the instrument's column of air will vibrate. By making the instrument about twice as long as the equivalent woodwind instrument and starting with the second harmonic, players can get a good range of notes simply by varying the tension of their lips (see [[embouchure]]).

Most brass instruments are fitted with a removable [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]]. Different shapes, sizes and styles of mouthpiece may be used to suit different embouchures, or to more easily produce certain tonal characteristics.  [[Trumpet]]s, [[trombones]], and [[tuba]]s are characteristically fitted with a cupped mouthpiece, while [[horn (instrument)|horns]] are fitted with a conical mouthpiece.

One interesting difference between a [[woodwind instrument]] and a brass instrument is that woodwind instruments are non-directional. This means that the sound produced propagates in all directions with approximately equal volume. Brass instruments, on the other hand, are highly directional, with most of the sound produced traveling straight outward from the bell. This difference makes it significantly more difficult to record a brass instrument accurately. It also plays a major role in some performance situations, such as in marching bands.

==Manufacture==
Brass instruments are made of a lacquered or plated [[metal]]. Traditionally the instruments are normally made of [[brass]], [[Metal polishing|polish]]ed and then [[lacquer]]ed to prevent [[corrosion]]. Some higher quality and higher cost instruments use [[gold]] or [[silver]] plating to prevent corrosion.  A few specialty instruments are made from wood.  

Alternatives to brass include other alloys containing significant amounts of [[copper]] or [[silver]]. These alloys are [[biostatic]] due to the [[oligodynamic effect]], and thus suppress growth of [[mold]]s, [[fungi]] or [[bacteria]]. Brass instruments constructed from [[stainless steel]] or [[aluminum]] have good sound quality but are rapidly colonized by microorganisms and become unpleasant to play.

Most higher quality instruments are designed to prevent or reduce [[galvanic corrosion]] between any steel in the valves and springs, and the brass of the tubing.  This may take the form of desiccant design, to keep the valves dry, [[sacrificial zinc]]s, replaceable valve cores and springs, plastic insulating washers, or nonconductive or noble materials for the valve cores and springs. Some instruments use several such features.

The process of making the large open end of a brass instruments by a process of metal beating. In making the bells (open ends) of brass instruments, for example, trumpets, a person lays out a pattern and shapes [[sheet metal]] into a bell-shape using templates, machine tools, handtools, and blueprints. The maker cuts out the bell blank, using hand or power shears. He hammers the blank over a bell-shaped mandrel, and butts the seam, using a notching tool. The seam is brazed, using a [[oxy-fuel welding and cutting|torch]] and smoothed using a hammer or file. A draw bench or arbor press equipped with expandable lead plug is used to shape and smooth the bell and bell neck over a mandrel. A [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]] is used to spin the bell head and to form a bead at tip of bell head. Previously shaped bell necks are annealed, using a hand torch to soften the metal for further bending. Scratches are removed from the bell using abrasive-coated cloth.

==Ensembles==
Brass instruments are one of the major classical instrument families and are played across a range of [[musical ensemble]]s.

[[Orchestra]]s include a varying number of brass instruments depending on music style and era, typically:
*[[Classical music|Classical]] symphony orchestra:
:*two to five [[trumpet]]s
:*two to eight [[horn (instrument)|horn]]s
:*two [[tenor trombone]]s
:*one [[bass trombone]]
:*one [[tuba]]
*[[Baroque music|Baroque]] orchestras may include valveless trumpets or [[Bugle (instrument)|bugle]]s, or trumpets/cornets playing these parts.
*[[Romantic music|Romantic]], [[20th century classical music|modern]], and [[Contemporary classical music|contemporary]] orchestras may include larger numbers of brass including more exotic instruments.

[[Brass band (British style)|British brass band]]s are made entirely up of brass, mostly conical bore instruments. Typical membership is:
*one [[soprano cornet]]
*five to ten [[cornet]]s
*one [[flugelhorn]]
*three to five [[tenor horn|tenor horns (alto horns)]]
*two [[baritone horn|baritone]]s
*two to three tenor trombones
*one [[bass trombone]]
*two [[euphonium]]s
*two E{{music|flat}} [[tuba]]s
*two B{{music|flat}} [[tuba]]s

[[Brass quintet|quintet]]s are common small brass ensembles, a quintet typically contains:
*two trumpets
*one horn
*one trombone
*one tuba or bass trombone

[[Big Band]]s and other jazz bands commonly contain cylindrical bore brass instruments
*A Big band typically includes:
:*three to five trumpets
:*three or four tenor trombones and sometimes a bass trombone
*Smaller jazz ensembles may include a single trumpet or trombone soloist.

[[Concert band]]s have similar brass instrumentation to an orchestra, typically:
*two to four trumpets or cornets
*two to four horns
*two to three tenor trombones (and occasionally an additional bass trombone)
*one or two baritones or euphoniums
*one or two tubas

[[Banda music|Mexican Bandas]] have:
*three trumpets
*three trombones
*two alto horns, also called &quot;charchetas&quot; and &quot;saxores&quot;
*one sousaphone, called &quot;tuba&quot;

Single brass instruments are also often used to accompany other instruments or ensembles such as an [[organ (instrument)|organ]], or a [[choir]].

''Antisemitism: A Reference Handbook'', ABC-CLIO, 2004, pp. 34–45. &quot;Among the most serious of these [anti-Jewish] manifestations, which reverberate to the present day, were those of the libels: the leveling of false charges against Jews, particularly the ''blood libel'' and the ''libel of desecrating the host''.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldish2008p8&gt;Goldish, Matt. ''Jewish Questions: Responsa on Sephardic Life in the Early Modern Period'', Princeton University Press, 2008, p. 8. &quot;In the period from the twelfth to the twentieth centuries, Jews were regularly charged with blood libel or ritual murder—false claims that Jews kidnapped and murdered Christian children as part of a Jewish religious ritual.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; that religious minorities, usually [[Jew]]s, murder children to use their [[human blood|blood]] in certain aspects of their [[religious ritual]]s and [[religious holiday|holiday]]s.&lt;ref name=JewishEncyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=dundes /&gt;&lt;ref name=zeitlin&gt;Zeitlin, S [http://www.jstor.org/pss/1453766 &quot;The Blood Accusation&quot;] ''Vigiliae Christianae'', Vol. 50, No. 2 (1996), pp. 117-124&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, these claims—alongside those of [[well poisoning]] and [[host desecration]]—have been a major theme in [[History of the Jews in Europe|European persecution of Jews]].&lt;ref name=Chanes2004pp34-35/&gt;

Blood libels typically allege that Jews require human blood for the baking of [[matzo]]s for [[Passover]], although this element was absent in the earliest cases that claimed (the contemporary) Jews reenacted the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]. The accusations often assert that the blood of [[Christian]] children is especially coveted, and, historically, blood libel claims have been made to account for otherwise unexplained deaths of children. In some cases, the alleged victim of [[human sacrifice]] has become venerated as a [[Christian martyr|martyr]], a holy figure around whom a martyr cult might arise. Four of these have been previously [[Canonization|canonized]] as [[saint]]s, namely [[William of Norwich]], [[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]], [[Simon of Trent]] (these were decanonized in the 20th century), and [[Gavriil Belostoksky]] who remains canonized in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

In Jewish lore, blood libels were the impetus for the creation in the 16th century of the [[Golem#The classic narrative|Golem of Prague]] by Rabbi [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/golem.html Angelo S. Rappoport ''The Folklore of the Jews'' (London: Soncino Press, 1937)pp. 195-203]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Walter Laqueur]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Altogether, there have been about 150 recorded cases of blood libel (not to mention thousands of rumors) that resulted in the arrest and killing of Jews throughout history, most of them in the Middle Ages... In almost every case, Jews were murdered, sometimes by a mob, sometimes following torture and a trial.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Laqueur]] (2006): ''The Changing Face of Antisemitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day'', Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-530429-2. p.56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Actual Jewish practices regarding blood and sacrifice==
The supposed torture and human sacrifice alleged in the blood libels run contrary to the teachings of Judaism. God commanded Abraham in the [[Binding of Isaac]] to sacrifice his son, but ultimately provided a ram as a substitute. The [[Ten Commandments]] in the [[Torah]] forbid murder.  In addition, the use of blood (human or otherwise) in cooking is prohibited by the [[Kashrut|kosher dietary laws]] (kashrut).  Blood from slaughtered animals may not be consumed, and must be drained out of the animal and covered with earth. ({{bibleverse||Lev|17:12-13|31}}) According to the book of Leviticus, blood from sacrificed animals may only be placed on the altar of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Great Temple in Jerusalem]] (which no longer existed at the time of the Christian blood libels). Furthermore, consumption of human flesh would violate kashrut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magentzedek.org/?page_id=81 What is Kashrut; ''&quot;Eating blood is forbidden. Blood is blood, whether it comes from a human being or an animal. In prohibiting the consumption of blood, the Torah seems to be concerned that it can excite a blood-lust in human beings and may desensitize us to the suffering of human beings when their blood is spilled.&quot;'']
&lt;/ref&gt;

While animal sacrifice was part of the practice of ancient Judaism, the [[Tanakh]] (Old Testament) and [[Halakha|Jewish teaching]] portray [[human sacrifice]] as one of the evils that separated the pagans of [[Canaan]] from the Hebrews ({{bibleverse||Deut|12:31|31}}, {{bibleverse|2|Kings|16:3|31}}).   Jews were prohibited from engaging in these rituals and were punished for doing so ({{bibleverse||Ex|34:15|31}}, {{bibleverse||Lev|20:2|31}}, {{bibleverse||Deut|18:12|31}}, {{bibleverse||Jer|7:31|31}}).  In fact, ritual cleanliness for priests prohibited even being in the same room as a human corpse ({{bibleverse||Lev|21:11|31}}).&lt;!-- a secondary to support the interpretations of tanakh --&gt;

==Suggested origins of the myth==

Professor Israel Jacob Yuval of the [[Hebrew University]] of Jerusalem published an article in 1993 that argues that blood libel may have originated in the 12th century from Christian views of Jewish behavior during the [[First Crusade]]. Some Jews committed suicide and killed their own children rather than be subjected to forced conversions. Yuval investigated Christian reports of these events and found that they were greatly distorted with claims that if Jews could kill their own children they could also kill Christian children. Yuval rejects the blood libel story as a fantasy of some Christians which could not contain any elements of truth because of the precarious nature of the Jewish minority's existence in Christian Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/827036.html | title = And if it's not good for the Jews? | author = Lily Galili | publisher = Ha'aretz | date = February 18, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''Two Nations in Your Womb: Perceptions of Jews and Christians in Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' by Israel J.

==Notable instances==
{{Ref improve section|date=September 2010}}
There have been many blood libel accusations and trials of Jews, beginning in the 1st century and continuing through modern times.  A few of them are discussed here.

===Antiquity===
The origins of the blood libel are found in the writings of to the Graeco-Egyptian author [[Apion]], who claimed that Jews sacrificed Greek victims in [[Second Temple|their temple]].&lt;ref name=Turvey2008p3&gt;Turvey, Brent E. ''Criminal Profiling: An Introduction to Behavioral Evidence Analysis'', Academic Press, 2008, p. 3. &quot;Its origins are found in a report made by the anti-Semite scholar Apion to the Roman Emperor Caligula in 38 CE&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Apion repeated anti-Jewish slurs and &quot;absurd calumnies&quot; first made by [[Posidonius]] and [[Apollonius Molon]] in the 1st century BCE.&lt;ref name=Feldmanp1996p293&gt;Feldman, Louis H.

===Middle Ages===
Jews of [[Norwich]] were accused of [[ritual murder]] after a boy, [[William of Norwich]], was found dead with stab wounds. The legend was turned into a cult, with William acquiring the status of martyr and crowds of pilgrims bringing wealth to the local church. In 1189, the Jewish deputation attending the coronation of [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] was attacked by the crowd. [[History of the Jews in England#Massacres at London and York (1189–1190)|Massacres of Jews at London and York]] soon followed. On Feb 6 1190, all the Norwich Jews were found slaughtered in their houses, except a few who found refuge in the castle. Jews would later be [[Edict of Expulsion|expelled from all of England]] in 1290 and not allowed to return until 1655. In 1171, [[Blois]] was the site of a blood libel accusation against its Jewish community that led to 31 Jews (by some accounts 40) being burned to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=112387 |title=The Martyrs of Blois |publisher=Chabad.org |date=2006-06-16 |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early blood libel appears in ''Bonum Universale de Apibus'' ii. 29, § 23, by [[Thomas of Cantimpré]] (a monastery near Cambray). Thomas wrote &quot;It is quite certain that the Jews of every province annually decide by lot which congregation or city is to send Christian blood to the other congregations.&quot;
Thomas also believed that since the time when the Jews called out to [[Pontius Pilate]], &quot;His blood be on us, and on our children&quot; ({{bibleverse||Matthew|27:25|NIV}}), they have been afflicted with hemorrhages:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A very learned Jew, who in our day has been converted to the (Christian) faith, informs us that one enjoying the reputation of a prophet among them, toward the close of his life, made the following prediction: 'Be assured that relief from this secret ailment, to which you are exposed, can only be obtained through Christian blood (&quot;''solo sanguine Christiano''&quot;).' This suggestion was followed by the ever-blind and impious Jews, who instituted the custom of annually shedding Christian blood in every province, in order that they might recover from their malady.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thomas added that the Jews had misunderstood the words of their prophet, who by his expression &quot;''solo sanguine Christiano''&quot; had meant not the blood of any Christian, but that of Jesus—the only true remedy for all physical and spiritual suffering.
Thomas did not mention the name of the &quot;very learned&quot; proselyte, but it may have been [[Nicholas Donin]] of [[La Rochelle]], who in 1240 had a disputation on the [[Talmud]] with [[Yechiel of Paris]], and who in 1242 caused the burning of numerous Talmudic manuscripts in Paris. It is known that Thomas was personally acquainted with this Nicholas.

The case of [[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]] is mentioned by [[Chaucer]], and thus has become well-known. A child of eight years, named Hugh, son of a woman named Beatrice, disappeared at [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] on 31 July 1255. His body was discovered on 29 August, covered with filth, in a pit or well belonging to a Jewish man named Copin or Koppin. On being promised by John of Lexington, a judge, who happened to be present, that his life should be spared, Copin is said to have confessed that the boy had been crucified by the Jews, who had assembled at Lincoln for that purpose. [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]], on reaching Lincoln at the beginning of October, refused to carry out the promise of John of Lexington, and had Copin executed and 91 of the Jews of Lincoln seized and sent up to London, where 18 of them were executed. The rest were pardoned at the intercession of the Franciscans (Jacobs, ''Jewish Ideals'', pp.&amp;nbsp;192–224).

At [[Pforzheim]], Baden, the corpse of a seven-year-old girl was found in the river by fishermen. The Jews were suspected, and when they were led to the corpse, blood allegedly began to flow from the wounds; led to it a second time, the face of the child became flushed, and both arms were raised. In addition to these miracles, there was the testimony of the daughter of the wicked woman who had sold the child to the Jews. A regular judicial examination did not take place; it is probable that the above-mentioned &quot;wicked woman&quot; was the murderess. That a judicial murder was then and there committed against the Jews in consequence of the accusation is evident from the manner in which the [[Nuremberg]] &quot;Memorbuch&quot; and the synagogal poems refer to the incident ([[Siegmund Salfeld]], ''Das Martyrologium des Nürnberger Memorbuches'' (1898), pp.&amp;nbsp;15, 128-130). At Weissenburg, a miracle alone decided the charge against the Jews. According to the accusation, the Jews had suspended a child (whose body was found in the Lauter river) by the feet, and had opened every artery in his body to obtain all the blood. Again, supernatural claims were made: the child's wounds were said to have bled for five days afterward, despite its treatment.

At Oberwesel, &quot;miracles&quot; again constituted the only evidence against the Jews. The corpse of the 11-year-old Werner was said to have floated up the Rhine (against the current) as far as Bacharach, emitting radiance, and being invested with healing powers. In consequence, the Jews of Oberwesel and many other adjacent localities were severely persecuted during the years 1286-89. Emperor Rudolph I, to whom the Jews had appealed for protection, issued a public proclamation to the effect that great wrong had been done to the Jews, and that the corpse of Werner was to be burned and the ashes scattered to the winds. The statement was made, in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of [[Konrad Justinger]] of 1423, that at [[Bern]] in 1294 the Jews tortured and murdered a boy called Rudolph. The historical impossibility of this widely credited story was demonstrated by Jakob Stammler, pastor of Bern, in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Katholische Schweizer-Blätter,&quot; Lucerne, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated whether the [[Kindlifresserbrunnen]] (&quot;Child Eater Fountain&quot;) in Bern might refer to the alleged ritual murder of 1294.

[[Image:Judensau Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|From an 18th-century etching from Brückenturm. ''Above'': The murdered body of Simon of Trent. ''Below'': The &quot;[[Judensau]].&quot;]]

[[Simon of Trent]], aged two, disappeared, and his father alleged that he had been kidnapped and murdered by the local Jewish community. Fifteen local Jews were sentenced to death and burned. Simon was regarded as a saint, and was canonized by [[Pope Sixtus V]] in 1588. His status as a saint was removed in 1965 by [[Pope Paul VI]], though his murder is still promoted as a fact by a handful of extremists.

Christopher of Toledo, also known as Christopher of La Guardia or &quot;the [[Holy Child of La Guardia]],&quot; was a four-year-old Christian boy supposedly murdered by two Jews and three [[Converso]]s (converts to Christianity).  In total, eight men were executed.  It is now believed&lt;ref&gt;Reston, James: &quot;Dogs of God: Columbus, the Inquisition, and the defeat of the Moors&quot;, page 207. Doubleday, 2005. ISBN 0-385-50848-4&lt;/ref&gt; that this case was constructed by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] to facilitate the [[Alhambra decree|expulsion of Jews from Spain]].  He was canonized by [[Pope Pius VII]] in 1805. Christopher has since been removed from the canon, though once again, a handful of individuals still claim the validity of this case.
[[Image:Schedel judenfeindlichkeit.jpg|thumb|left| The story of Simon of Trent (1475), by Hartmann Schedels (1493)]]

In a case at Tyrnau (Nagyszombat, today [[Trnava]], [[Slovakia]]), the absurdity, even the impossibility, of the statements forced by torture from women and children shows that the accused preferred death as a means of escape from the torture, and admitted everything that was asked of them. They even said that Jewish men menstruated, and that the latter therefore practiced the drinking of Christian blood as a remedy.

At Bösing (Bazin, today [[Pezinok]], [[Slovakia]]), it was charged that a nine-year-old boy had been bled to death, suffering cruel torture; thirty Jews confessed to the crime and were publicly burned. The true facts of the case were disclosed later, when the child was found alive in Vienna. He had been stolen by the accuser, Count Wolf of Bazin, as a fiendish means of ridding himself of his Jewish creditors at Bazin.

At [[Rinn]], near [[Innsbruck]], a boy named [[Andreas Oxner]] (also known as Anderl von Rinn) was said to have been bought by Jewish merchants and cruelly murdered by them in a forest near the city, his blood being carefully collected in vessels. The accusation of drawing off the blood (without murder) was not made until the beginning of the 17th century, when the cult was founded. The older inscription in the church of Rinn, dating from 1575, is distorted by fabulous embellishments&amp;mdash;for example, that the money paid for the boy to his godfather turned into leaves, and that a lily blossomed upon his grave.  The cult continued until officially prohibited in 1994 by the Bishop of Innsbruck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/rinn.html Medieval Sourcebook: A Blood Libel Cult: Anderl von Rinn, d. 1462] www.fordham.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only child-saint in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] is the six-year-old boy [[Gavriil Belostoksky]] from the village Zverki. According to the legend supported by the church, the boy was kidnapped from his home during the holiday of [[Passover]] while his parents were away. Shutko, who was a Jew from [[Białystok]], was accused in bringing the boy to Białystok, poking him with sharp objects and draining his blood for nine days, then bringing the body back to Zverki and dumping at a local field. A cult developed, and the boy was canonized in 1820. His relics are still the object of pilgrimage. On [[All Saints Day]], July 27, 1997, the Belorussian state TV showed a film alleging the story is true.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vestnik.com/issues/97/0902/win/stonov.htm Is the New in the Post-Soviet Space Only the Forgotten Old?] by Leonid Stonov, International Director of Bureau for the Human Rights and Law-Observance in the Former Soviet Union, the President of the American Association of Jews from the former USSR)&lt;/ref&gt; The revival of the cult in [[Belarus]] was cited as a dangerous expression of antisemitism in international reports on human rights and religious freedoms&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4humanrights.org/by/eng/reports/relig2003.shtml Belarus.

===Modern===
*1840 [[Damascus affair]]: In February, at Damascus, a Catholic monk named Father Thomas and his servant were murdered. The accusation of ritual murder was brought against members of the Jewish community of Damascus

*1840 [[Rhodes blood libel]]: The Jews of [[Rhodes]], during the [[Ottoman Empire]], were accused of murdering a [[Greeks|Greek]] Christian boy. The libel was supported by the local governor and the European consuls posted to Rhodes. Several Jews were arrested and tortured, and the entire Jewish quarter was blockaded for twelve days. An investigation carried out by the central Ottoman government found the Jews to be innocent.

*In March 1879, ten Jewish men from a mountain village were brought to [[Kutaisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to stand trial for the alleged kidnapping and murder of a Christian girl. The case attracted a great deal of attention in Russia (of which Georgia was then a part): &quot;While periodicals as diverse in tendency as ''[[Vestnik Evropy|Herald of Europe]]'' and ''[[Sankt-Peterburgskie Vedomosti|Saint Petersburg Notices]]'' expressed their amazement that medieval prejudice should have found a place in the modern judiciary of a civilized state, ''[[Novoye Vremya (newspaper)|New Times]]'' hinted darkly of strange Jewish sects with unknown practices.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Effie Ambler, ''Russian Journalism and Politics: The Career of Aleksei S. Suvorin, 1861-1881'' (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1972: ISBN 0814314619), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The trial ended in acquittal, and the orientalist [[Daniel Chwolson]] published a refutation of the blood libel.

*1882 [[Tiszaeszlár blood libel]]: The Jews of the village [[Tiszaeszlár]], [[Hungary]] were accused with the ritual murder of a fourteen-year-old Christian girl, Eszter Solymosi. The case was one of the main causes of the rise of antisemitism in the country. The accused persons were eventually acquitted.

*In the 1899 [[Hilsner Affair]], Leopold Hilsner, a Jewish vagabond, was accused of murdering a nineteen-year-old Christian woman, Anežka Hrůzová, with a slash to the throat.  Despite the absurdity of the charge and the relatively progressive nature of society in [[Austria-Hungary]], Hilsner was convicted and sentenced to death.  He was later convicted of an additional unsolved murder, also involving a Christian woman.  In 1901, the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. [[Tomáš Masaryk]], a prominent Austro-Czech philosophy professor and future president of [[Czechoslovakia]], spearheaded Hilsner's defense. He was later blamed by Czech media because of this. In March 1918, Hilsner was pardoned by Austrian emperor [[Karl of Austria|Charles I]].  He was never exonerated, and the true guilty parties were never found.

*The 1903 [[Kishinev pogrom]], an anti-Jewish revolt, started when an anti-Semitic newspaper wrote that a Christian Russian boy, Mikhail Rybachenko, was found murdered in the town of [[Dubăsari|Dubossary]], alleging that the Jews killed him in order to use the blood in preparation of matzo. Around 49 Jews were killed and hundreds were wounded, with over 700 houses being looted and destroyed.

*In the 1910 [[Shiraz blood libel]], the Jews of [[Shiraz]], [[Iran]], were falsely accused of murdering a Muslim girl. The entire Jewish quarter was pillaged; the pogrom left 12 Jews dead and about 50 injured.

*In [[Kiev]], a Jewish factory manager, [[Menahem Mendel Beilis]], was accused of murdering a Christian child and using his blood in [[matzo]]s.  He was acquitted by an all-Christian jury after a sensational trial in 1913.

*In 1928, the Jews of [[Massena (village), New York|Massena]], [[New York]], were falsely accused of kidnapping and killing a Christian girl in the [[Massena blood libel]].

*The 1946 [[Kielce pogrom]] against Holocaust survivors in Poland was sparked by an accusation of blood libel.

*[[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]] of [[Saudi Arabia]] (r. 1964–1975) made accusations against Parisian Jews that took the nature of a blood libel.&lt;ref name = &quot;Berger&quot;&gt;{{cite book

* On October 21, 2002, the [[London]]-based [[Arabic language|Arabic]] paper ''[[Al-Hayat]]'' reported that the book ''The Matzah of Zion'' was undergoing its eighth reprint and was being translated into [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].
* In 2003 a private Syrian film company created a 29-part television series ''[[Ash-Shatat]]'' (&quot;The Diaspora&quot;).  This series originally aired in Lebanon in late 2003 and was broadcast by ''[[Al-Manar]]'', a satellite television network owned by [[Hezbollah]]. This TV series, based on the antisemitic forgery ''The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion'', shows the Jewish people as engaging in a conspiracy to rule the world, and presents Jews as people who murder Christian children, drain their blood and use this blood to bake [[matzah]].
* In early January 2005, some 20 members of the [[Russia]]n [[State Duma]] publicly made a blood libel against the Jewish people. They approached the Prosecutor General’s Office and demanded that Russia &quot;ban all Jewish organizations.”  They accused all Jewish groups of being extremists and of being “anti-Christian and inhumane, which practices extend even to ritual murders.” Alluding to previous antisemitic Russian court decrees that accused the Jews of ritual murder, they wrote that “Many facts of such religious extremism were proven in courts.” The accusation included traditional [[antisemitic canards]], such as “the whole democratic world today is under the financial and political control of international Jewry. And we do not want our Russia to be among such unfree countries”. This demand was published as an open letter to the prosecutor general, in ''Rus Pravoslavnaya'' ({{lang-ru|Русь православная}}, &quot;Orthodox Russia&quot;), a national-conservative newspaper. This group consisted of members of the ultra-nationalist [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia|Liberal Democrats]], the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist faction]], and the nationalist [[Motherland (Russia)|Motherland party]], with some 500 supporters.

==Views of the Catholic Church==
The attitude of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] towards these accusations and the cults venerating children supposedly killed by Jews has varied over time. The papacy generally opposed them, although it had problems in enforcing its opposition.

In 1911, the ''Dictionnaire apologétique de la foi catholique'', an important French Catholic encyclopedia, published an analysis of the blood libel accusations.&lt;ref&gt;English translation [http://counterenlightenment.blogspot.com/2011/04/blood-libel-view-from-1911.html here].&lt;/ref&gt; This may be taken as being broadly representative of educated Catholic opinion in continental Europe at that time. The article noted that the popes had generally refrained from endorsing the blood libel, and it concluded that the accusations were unproven in a general sense, but it left open the possibility that some Jews had committed ritual murders of Christians.  Other contemporary Catholic sources (notably the Jesuit periodical ''Civiltà cattolica'') took a more hostile view.&lt;ref&gt;As shown by David Kertzer in ''The Popes Against the Jews'' (New York, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the accusations are almost entirely discredited in Catholic circles, and the cults associated with them have fallen into disfavour.  For example, Simon of Trent was deleted from the Calendar of Saints in 1965 and does not appear in the current (2000) edition of the Roman Martyrology.

===Papal pronouncements===
*[[Pope Innocent IV]] took action against the blood libel: &quot;5 July 1247 &quot;Mandate to the prelates of Germany and France to annul all measures adopted against the Jews on account of the ritual murder libel, and to prevent accusation of Arabs on similar charges&quot; (The Apostolic See and the Jews, Documents: 492-1404; Simonsohn, Shlomo, p.&amp;nbsp;188-189,193-195,208).  In 1247 he wrote also that &quot;Certain of the clergy, and princes, nobles and great lords of your cities and dioceses have falsely devised certain godless plans against the Jews, unjustly depriving them by force of their property, and appropriating it themselves;...they falsely charge them with dividing up among themselves on the Passover the heart of a murdered boy...In their malice, they ascribe every murder, wherever it chance to occur, to the Jews. And on the ground of these and other fabrications, they are filled with rage against them, rob them of their possessions without any formal accusation, without confession, and without legal trial and conviction, contrary to the privileges granted to them by the Apostolic See...Since it is our pleasure that they shall not be disturbed,...we ordain that ye behave towards them in a friendly and kind manner. Whenever any unjust attacks upon them come under your notice, redress their injuries, and do not suffer them to be visited in the future by similar tribulations&quot; (''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1910), Vol. 8, pp.393-394). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08017a.htm]
*[[Pope Gregory X]] (1271-1276) issued a letter which criticized the practice of blood libels and forbid arrests and persecution of Jews based on a blood libel, ''...unless &amp;ndash;which we do not believe &amp;ndash; they be caught in the commission of the crime.'' .&lt;ref name=&quot;gregx&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/g10-jews.html | title=Medieval Sourcebook: Gregory X: Letter on Jews, (1271-76) - Against the Blood Libel | author=[[Pope Gregory X]] | accessdate=2007-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views of Muslim authorities==
In late 1553 or 1554, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], the reigning [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], issued a [[firman (decree)|firman]] (royal decree) formally denouncing blood libels against the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mansel |first=Phillip |title=Constantinople : City of the World's Desire, 1453–1924|year= 1998|publisher= St. Martin's Griffin |location= New York |isbn= 978-0312187088 |page= 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram published a series of articles by Osam Al-Baz, a senior advisor to then Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]]. Among other things, Osam Al-Baz explained the origins of the blood libel against the Jews. He said that Arabs and Muslims have never been antisemitic, as a group, but accepted that a few Arab writers and media figures attack Jews &quot;on the basis of the racist fallacies and myths that originated in Europe&quot;. He urged people not to succumb to &quot;myths&quot; such as the blood libel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Osama El-Baz |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/619/focus.htm |title=Al-Ahram Weekly Online, January 2–8, 2003 (Issue No. 619) |publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg |date= |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bagpuss''''' is a 1974 UK [[children's television series]], made by [[Peter Firmin]] and [[Oliver Postgate]] through their company [[Smallfilms]]. The title character is &quot;an old, saggy cloth cat, baggy, and a bit loose at the seams&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smallfilms&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.smallfilms.co.uk/bagpuss/intro.htm|title= Bagpuss - The intro|accessdate=2007-11-11 |work= The Smallfilms Treasury}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although only 13 episodes of the show were made, it remains fondly remembered,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7773124.stm|title= Bagpuss - See Emily Play|accessdate=2008-09-12 |work= BBC | date=9 December 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has often been repeated in the UK.

==Format==
Each programme would begin the same way: through a series of [[sepia tone|sepia]] photographs, the viewer is told of a little girl named Emily (played by Emily Firmin, the daughter of illustrator Peter Firmin),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duffy |first=Jonathan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7773124.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Magazine &amp;#124; See Emily play |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-12-09 |accessdate=2009-07-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; who owned a shop. However, it did not sell anything: instead, Emily would find lost and broken things and display them in the window of the shop, so their owners could one day come and collect them. She would leave the object in front of her favourite stuffed toy — the large, saggy, pink and white striped cat named Bagpuss. She would then recite a verse:&lt;ref name=&quot;Smallfilms&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|Bagpuss, dear Bagpuss&lt;br /&gt;Old Fat Furry Catpuss&lt;br /&gt;Wake up and look at this thing that I bring&lt;br /&gt;Wake up, be bright, be golden and light&lt;br /&gt;Bagpuss, oh hear what I sing}}

When Emily had left, Bagpuss would wake up. The programme shifted from sepia to colour [[stop motion]] film, and various toys in the shop would also come to life: Gabriel the [[toad]] (who, unlike most Smallfilms characters, could move by a special device beneath his can without the use of stop motion animation) and a [[rag doll]] called Madeleine. The wooden woodpecker bookend became the drily academic Professor [[Yaffle]] (based on the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], whom Postgate had once met&lt;ref&gt;[[Channel 4]] News, 9 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;), while the mice carved on the side of the &quot;mouse organ&quot; (a small mechanical [[pipe organ]] which played rolls of music) woke up and scurried around, singing in high-pitched voices. [[Sandra Kerr]] and [[John Faulkner (musician)|John Faulkner]] provided the voices of Madeleine and Gabriel respectively, and put together and performed all the proper songs. All the other voices (including the narrator and one out-of-tune mouse) were provided by [[Oliver Postgate]], who also wrote the stories.

The toys would discuss what the new object was; someone (usually Madeleine) would tell a story related to the object (shown in an animated thought-bubble over Bagpuss's head), often with a song, which would be accompanied by Gabriel on the [[banjo]] (which often sounded a lot more like a [[guitar]]), and then the mice, singing in high pitched squeaky harmony as they worked, would mend the broken object.  The newly mended thing would then be put in the shop window, so that whoever had lost it would see it as they went past, and could come in and claim it. Then Bagpuss would start yawning again, and as he fell asleep the colour faded to sepia and they all became toys again.

{{quote|And, of course, when Bagpuss goes to sleep,&lt;br /&gt;All his friends go to sleep too.&lt;br /&gt;The mice were ornaments on the mouse organ.&lt;br /&gt;Gabriel and Madeleine were just dolls.&lt;br /&gt;Professor Yaffle was a carved, wooden [[bookend]] in the shape of a woodpecker.&lt;br /&gt;Even Bagpuss himself, once he was asleep, was just an old, saggy cloth cat,&lt;br /&gt;Baggy, and a bit loose at the seams,&lt;br /&gt;But Emily loved him}}

==Episodes==
The titles of the thirteen episodes each refer in some way to the object Emily found.

==Production==

[[File:BagpussCharacters.jpg|thumb|right|The characters of Bagpuss]]

The programmes were made using [[stop motion|stop-frame animation]]. Bagpuss is an actual cloth cat, but was not intended to be such an electric pink. &quot;It should have been a ginger marmalade cat but the company in [[Folkestone]] dyeing the material made a mistake and it turned out pink and cream. It was the best thing that ever happened,&quot; said Firmin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adscene&quot;&gt;
{{cite news |title= Saggy old cloth cat pulls in the crowds|work= Canterbury Adscene|publisher= Kent Regional News and Media|pages= 4&amp;ndash;5|date= 2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Madeleine the rag doll was made by Firmin's wife, Joan, with an extra long dress to hold their children's nightdresses, but Postgate decided it would serve better as one of the characters.

Gabriel the Toad was the only character in the series who could move freely without the use of stop-frame animation. Scenes featuring him playing the banjo and singing would have taken quite a bit of time, so Peter Firmin created a mechanism that helped him control Gabriel through a hole in his can.

Bagpuss has now retired to the [[Rupert Bear Museum]] in [[Canterbury]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] (part of the [[Museum of Canterbury]]), together with other characters and Emily's shop window.

Most of the stories and songs used in the series are based on folk songs and [[fairy tale]]s from around the world. The round sung by the mice (starting with the words &quot;We will fix it...&quot;) is to the tune of &quot;[[Sumer Is Icumen In|Sumer is icumen in]]&quot;, dating from the [[Middle Ages]].

==Recognition==
In 1987 the [[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]] awarded an [[honorary degree]] to Oliver Postgate. He stated that the degree was really intended for Bagpuss, who was subsequently displayed in academic dress.&lt;ref name=&quot;CANTCHRO&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kent.ac.uk/arts/campus/chronicle.html |title=A Canterbury Chronicle |work=Arts, leisure and public events |publisher=University of Kent |accessdate=2006-11-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930024111/http://www.kent.ac.uk/arts/campus/chronicle.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1999 the series came first place in a BBC poll selecting the nation's favourite children's show.&lt;ref name=&quot;news&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Entertainment: Bagpuss cream of television| publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 1999-01-01| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/246080.stm | accessdate = 2007-09-21 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also came fourth in the 2001 [[Channel 4]] poll The [[100 Greatest Kids' TV shows]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chan4&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Simpsons tops kids' TV poll | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 2001-09-28| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1512890.stm | accessdate = 2007-09-21 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 and 2005 a stage show of ''Bagpuss'' songs toured UK [[folk festival]]s and theatres with original singers [[Sandra Kerr]] and [[John Faulkner (musician)|John Faulkner]], along with Kerr's daughter [[Nancy Kerr]] and her husband, James Fagan.

Bagpuss appears in [[The Official BBC Children in Need Medley]], which was released on 21 November 2009&lt;!-- almost a year after Postgate's death --&gt;&lt;!-- not sure how relevant this is --&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{otheruses4|the mathematical topic|the book of the same name|Naive Set Theory (book)}}

'''Naive set theory''' is one of several theories of sets used in the discussion of the [[foundations of mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;Concerning the origin of the term ''naive set theory'', Jeff Miller has this to say: “''Naïve set theory'' (contrasting with axiomatic set theory) was used occasionally in the 1940s and became an established term in the 1950s. It appears in Hermann Weyl's review of P. A. Schilpp (ed) ''The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell'' in the ''American Mathematical Monthly'', 53., No. 4. (1946), p. 210 and Laszlo Kalmar's review of ''The Paradox of Kleene and Rosser'' in ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'', 11, No. 4. (1946), p. 136. (JSTOR).” [http://jeff560.tripod.com/s.html] The term was later popularized by [[Paul Halmos]]' book, ''Naive Set Theory'' (1960).&lt;/ref&gt; The informal content of this ''naive set theory'' supports both the aspects of [[mathematical set]]s familiar in [[discrete mathematics]] (for example [[Venn diagram]]s and symbolic reasoning about their [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]), and the everyday usage of set theory concepts in most contemporary mathematics. 

Sets are of great importance in [[mathematics]]; in fact, in modern formal treatments, most mathematical objects ([[number]]s, [[relation (mathematics)|relations]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], etc.) are defined in terms of sets. Naive set theory can be seen as a stepping-stone to more formal treatments, and suffices for many purposes.

==Requirements==

In the sense of this article, a '''naive theory''' is a non-formalized theory, that is, a theory that uses a [[natural language]] to describe sets. The words '''and''', '''or''', '''if ... then''', '''not''', '''for some''', '''for every''' are not subject to rigorous definition. It is useful to study sets naively at an early stage of mathematics in order to develop facility for working with them.  Furthermore, a firm grasp of set theoretical concepts from a naive standpoint is important as a first stage in understanding the motivation for the formal axioms of set theory.

This article develops a naive theory. Sets are defined informally and a few of their properties are investigated. Links in this article to specific axioms of set theory describe some of the relationships between the informal discussion here and the formal [[axiomatization]] of set theory, but no attempt is made to justify every statement on such a basis. The first development of [[set theory]] was a naive set theory. It was created at the end of the 19th century by [[Georg Cantor]] as part of his study of [[infinite set]]s.

As it turned out, assuming that one can perform any operation on sets without restriction leads to [[paradox]]es such as [[Russell's paradox]] and [[Berry's paradox]]. Some believe that [[Georg Cantor]]'s set theory was not actually implicated by these [[paradox]]es (see Frápolli 1991); one difficulty in determining this with certainty is that Cantor did not provide an axiomatization of his system. It is undisputed that, by 1900, Cantor was aware of some of the paradoxes and did not believe that they discredited his theory. [[Frege]] did explicitly axiomatize a theory in which the formalized version of naive set theory can be interpreted, and it is this formal theory which [[Bertrand Russell]] actually addressed when he presented his paradox.

[[Axiomatic set theory]] was developed in response to these early attempts to study set theory, with the goal of determining precisely what operations were allowed and when.  Today, when mathematicians talk about &quot;set theory&quot; as a field, they usually mean axiomatic set theory.  Informal applications of set theory in other fields are sometimes referred to as applications of &quot;naive set theory&quot;, but usually are understood to be justifiable in terms of an [[axiomatic system]] (normally the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]]).

A naive set theory is not necessarily inconsistent, if it correctly specifies the sets allowed to be considered. This can be done by the means of definitions, which are implicit axioms. It can be done by systematically making explicit all the axioms, as in the case of the well-known book ''Naive Set Theory'' by [[Paul Halmos]], which is actually a somewhat (not all that) informal presentation of the usual axiomatic [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]]. It is 'naive' in that the language and notations are those of ordinary informal mathematics, and in that it doesn't deal with consistency or completeness of the axiom system.  However, the term ''naive set theory'' is also used in some literature to refer to the set theories studied by Frege and Cantor, rather than to the informal counterparts of modern axiomatic set theory; care is required to tell which sense is intended.

== Sets, membership and equality ==
In naive set theory, a '''set''' is described as a well-defined collection of objects. These objects are called the '''elements''' or '''members''' of the set. Objects can be anything: numbers, people, other sets, etc. For instance, 4 is a member of the set of all even [[integer]]s. Clearly, the set of even numbers is infinitely large; there is no requirement that a set be finite.

If ''x'' is a member of ''A'', then it is also said that ''x'' '''belongs to''' ''A'', or that ''x'' is in ''A''. In this case, we write ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''A''.
(The symbol ∈ is a derivation from the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[epsilon]], &quot;ε&quot;, introduced by [[Peano]] in 1888.)
The symbol ∉ is sometimes used to write ''x''&amp;nbsp;∉&amp;nbsp;''A'', meaning &quot;x is not in A&quot;.

Two sets ''A'' and ''B'' are defined to be '''[[Equality (mathematics)|equal]]''' when they have precisely the same elements, that is, if every element of ''A'' is an element of ''B'' and every element of ''B'' is an element of ''A''. (See [[axiom of extensionality]].) Thus a set is completely determined by its elements; the description is immaterial. For example, the set with elements 2, 3, and 5 is equal to the set of all [[prime number]]s less than 6.
If the sets ''A'' and ''B'' are equal, this is denoted symbolically as ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B'' (as usual).

We also allow for an '''[[empty set]]''', often denoted Ø and sometimes &lt;math&gt;\{\}&lt;/math&gt;: a set without any members at all.
Since a set is determined completely by its elements, there can only be one empty set. (See [[axiom of empty set]].) Note that Ø ≠ {Ø}.

== Specifying sets ==
The simplest way to describe a set is to list its elements between curly braces (known as defining a set ''extensionally''). Thus {1,2} denotes the set whose only elements are 1 and 2.
(See [[axiom of pairing]].)
Note the following points:
*Order of elements is immaterial; for example, {1,2} = {2,1}.
*Repetition ([[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]) of elements is irrelevant; for example, {1,2,2} = {1,1,1,2} = {1,2}.
(These are consequences of the definition of equality in the previous section.)

This notation can be informally abused by saying something like {dogs} to indicate the set of all dogs, but this example would usually be read by mathematicians as &quot;the set containing the single element ''dogs''&quot;.

An extreme (but correct) example of this notation is {}, which denotes the empty set.

We can also use the notation {''x''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''P''(''x'')}, or sometimes {''x''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''P''(''x'')}, to denote the set containing all objects for which the condition ''P'' holds  (known as defining a set ''intensionally'').
For example, {''x''&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;is a real number} denotes the set of [[real number]]s, {''x''&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;has blonde hair} denotes the set of everything with blonde hair, and {''x''&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;is a dog} denotes the set of all dogs.

This notation is called [[set-builder notation]] (or &quot;'''set comprehension'''&quot;, particularly in the context of [[Functional programming]]).
Some variants of set builder notation are:
*{''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;: ''P''(''x'')} denotes the set of all ''x'' ''that are already members of A'' such that the condition ''P'' holds for ''x''. For example, if '''Z''' is the set of [[integer]]s, then {''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''Z'''&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;even} is the set of all [[even and odd numbers|even]] integers. (See [[axiom of specification]].)
*{''F''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''A''} denotes the set of all objects obtained by putting members of the set ''A'' into the formula ''F''. For example,  {2''x''&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''Z'''} is again the set of all even integers. (See [[axiom of replacement]].)
*{''F''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;: ''P''(''x'')} is the most general form of set builder notation. For example, {''x'''s&amp;nbsp;owner&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;is a dog} is the set of all dog owners.

== Subsets ==
Given two sets ''A'' and ''B'' we say that ''A'' is a '''[[subset]]''' of ''B'' if every element of ''A'' is also an element of ''B''.
Notice that in particular, ''B'' is a subset of itself; a subset of ''B'' that isn't equal to ''B'' is called a '''proper subset'''.

If ''A'' is a subset of ''B'', then one can also say that ''B'' is a '''superset''' of ''A'', that ''A'' is '''contained in''' ''B'', or that ''B'' '''contains''' ''A''.
In symbols, ''A''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''B'' means that ''A'' is a subset of ''B'', and ''B''&amp;nbsp;⊇&amp;nbsp;''A'' means that ''B'' is a superset of ''A''.
Some authors use the symbols &quot;⊂&quot; and &quot;⊃&quot; for subsets, and others use these symbols only for ''proper'' subsets. For clarity, one can explicitly use the symbols &quot;&lt;math&gt;\subsetneq&lt;/math&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;math&gt;\supsetneq&lt;/math&gt;&quot; to indicate non-equality.

As an illustration, let '''R''' be the set of real numbers, let '''Z''' be the set of integers, let ''O'' be the set of odd integers, and let ''P'' be the set of current or former [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]].
Then ''O'' is a subset of '''Z''', '''Z''' is a subset of '''R''', and (hence) ''O'' is a subset of '''R''', where in all cases ''subset'' may even be read as ''proper subset''.
Note that not all sets are comparable in this way.
For example, it is not the case either that '''R''' is a subset of ''P'' nor that ''P'' is a subset of '''R'''.

It follows immediately from the definition of equality of sets above that, given two sets ''A'' and ''B'', ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B'' if and only if ''A''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''B'' and ''B''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''A''. In fact this is often given as the definition of equality. Usually when trying to [[mathematical proof|prove]] that two sets are equal, one aims to show these two inclusions. Note that the [[empty set]] is a subset of every set (the statement that all elements of the empty set are also members of any set ''A'' is [[vacuously true]]).

The set of all subsets of a given set ''A'' is called the '''[[power set]]''' of ''A'' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;2^A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt;; the &quot;''P''&quot; is sometimes in a fancy font. If the set ''A'' has ''n'' elements, then &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; will have &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; elements.

== Universal sets and absolute complements ==
In certain contexts we may consider all sets under consideration as being subsets of some given [[universe (mathematics)|universal set]].
For instance, if we are investigating properties of the [[real number]]s '''R''' (and subsets of '''R'''), then we may take '''R''' as our universal set. A universal set is only temporarily defined by the context; there is no such thing as a &quot;universal&quot; universal set, &quot;the set of everything&quot; (see '''[[#Paradoxes|Paradoxes]]''' below).

Given a universal set '''U''' and a subset ''A'' of '''U''', we may define the '''[[complement (set theory)|complement]]''' of ''A'' (in '''U''') as
:''A''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;:= {''x''&amp;nbsp;{{unicode|∈}}&amp;nbsp;'''U'''&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;{{unicode|∉}}&amp;nbsp;''A''}.
In other words, ''A''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; (&quot;''A-complement''&quot;; sometimes simply ''A''', &quot;''A-prime''&quot; ) is the set of all members of '''U''' which are not members of ''A''.
Thus with '''R''', '''Z''' and ''O'' defined as in the section on subsets, if '''Z''' is the universal set, then ''O&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the set of even integers, while if '''R''' is the universal set, then ''O&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the set of all real numbers that are either even integers or not integers at all.

== Unions, intersections, and relative complements ==
Given two sets ''A'' and ''B'', we may construct their '''[[union (set theory)|union]]'''.
This is the set consisting of all objects which are elements of ''A'' or of ''B'' or of both (see [[axiom of union]]). It is denoted by ''A''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;''B''.

The '''[[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]''' of ''A'' and ''B'' is the set of all objects which are both in ''A'' and in ''B''. It is denoted by ''A''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''B''.

Finally, the '''[[complement (set theory)|relative complement]]''' of ''B'' relative to ''A'', also known as the '''set theoretic difference''' of ''A'' and ''B'', is the set of all objects that belong to ''A'' but ''not'' to ''B''. It is written as ''A''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''B'' or ''A''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''B''.
Symbolically, these are respectively
:''A''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;:= {''x''&amp;nbsp;: (''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''A'')&amp;nbsp;[[logical disjunction|or]] (''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''B'')};
:''A''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;:= {''x''&amp;nbsp;: (''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''A'')&amp;nbsp;[[logical conjunction|and]] (''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''B'')}&amp;nbsp;= {''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''B''}&amp;nbsp;= {''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;: ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''A''};
:''A''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;:= {''x''&amp;nbsp;: (''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''A'')&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[negation|not]] (''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''B'') }&amp;nbsp;= {''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;: not (''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''B'')}.

Notice that ''A'' doesn't have to be a subset of ''B'' for ''B''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''A'' to make sense; this is the difference between the relative complement and the absolute complement from the previous section.

To illustrate these ideas, let ''A'' be the set of left-handed people, and let ''B'' be the set of people with blond hair.
Then ''A''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''B'' is the set of all left-handed blond-haired people, while ''A''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;''B'' is the set of all people who are left-handed or blond-haired or both.
''A''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''B'', on the other hand, is the set of all people that are left-handed but not blond-haired, while ''B''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''A'' is the set of all people who have blond hair but aren't left-handed.

Now let ''E'' be the set of all human beings, and let ''F'' be the set of all living things over 1000 years old.
What is ''E''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''F'' in this case?
No living human being is [[Oldest people|over 1000 years old]], so ''E''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''F'' must be the [[empty set]] {}.

For any set ''A'', the power set &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] under the operations of union and intersection.

==Ordered pairs and Cartesian products ==
Intuitively, an '''[[ordered pair]]''' is simply a collection of two objects such that one can be distinguished as the ''first element'' and the other as the ''second element'', and having the fundamental property that, two ordered pairs are equal if and only if their ''first elements'' are equal and their ''second elements'' are equal.

Formally, an ordered pair with '''first coordinate''' ''a'', and '''second coordinate''' ''b'', usually denoted by (''a'', ''b''), can be defined as the set {{''a''},&amp;nbsp;{''a'', ''b''}}.

It follows that, two ordered pairs (''a'',''b'') and (''c'',''d'') are equal if and only if ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'' and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''d''.

Alternatively, an ordered pair can be formally thought of as a set {a,b} with a [[total order]].

(The notation (''a'', ''b'') is also used to denote an [[open interval]] on the [[real number line]], but the context should make it clear which meaning is intended. Otherwise, the notation ]''a'', ''b''[ may be used to denote the open interval whereas (''a'', ''b'') is used for the ordered pair).

If ''A'' and ''B'' are sets, then the '''[[Cartesian product]]''' (or simply '''product''') is defined to be:
:''A''&amp;nbsp;× ''B''&amp;nbsp;= {(''a'',''b'')&amp;nbsp;: ''a'' is in ''A'' and ''b'' is in ''B''}.
That is, ''A''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''B'' is the set of all ordered pairs whose first coordinate is an element of ''A'' and whose second coordinate is an element of ''B''.

We can extend this definition to a set ''A''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''C'' of ordered triples, and more generally to sets of ordered [[n-tuple]]s for any positive integer ''n''.
It is even possible to define infinite [[Cartesian product]]s, but to do this we need a more recondite definition of the product.

Cartesian products were first developed by [[René Descartes]] in the context of [[analytic geometry]].
If '''R''' denotes the set of all [[real number]]s, then '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;:=&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;'''R''' represents the [[Euclidean plane]] and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;:=&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;'''R''' represents three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].

==Some important sets ==
&lt;small&gt;Note: In this section, ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are [[natural number]]s, and r and s are [[real number]]s.&lt;/small&gt;
# [[Natural number]]s are used for counting.  A [[blackboard bold]] capital '''N''' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;) often represents this set.
# [[Integer]]s appear as solutions for ''x'' in equations like ''x'' + ''a'' = ''b''.  A blackboard bold capital '''Z''' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;) often represents this set (from the German ''Zahlen'', meaning ''numbers'').
# [[Rational number]]s appear as solutions to equations like ''a'' + ''bx'' = ''c''.  A blackboard bold capital '''Q''' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;) often represents this set (for ''[[quotient]]'', because R is used for the set of real numbers).
# [[Algebraic number]]s appear as solutions to [[polynomial]] equations (with integer coefficients) and may involve [[Nth root|radicals]] and certain other [[irrational number]]s.  A blackboard bold capital '''A''' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt;) or a '''Q''' with an overline (&lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbb{Q}}&lt;/math&gt;) often represents this set.  The overline denotes the operation of [[algebraic closure]].
# [[Real number]]s represent the &quot;real line&quot; and include all numbers that can be approximated by rationals. These numbers may be rational or algebraic but may also be [[transcendental number]]s, which cannot appear as solutions to polynomial equations with rational coefficients.  A blackboard bold capital '''R''' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;) often represents this set.
# [[Complex number]]s are sums of a real and an imaginary number: ''r'' + ''s''i.  Here both ''r'' and ''s'' can equal zero; thus, the set of real numbers and the set of imaginary numbers are subsets of the set of complex numbers, which form an [[algebraic closure]] for the set of real numbers, meaning that every polynomial with coefficients in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; has at least one [[Root of a function|root]] in this set. A blackboard bold capital '''C''' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;) often represents this set. Note that since a number ''r'' + ''s''i can be identified with a point (''r'', ''s'') in the plane, '''C''' is basically &quot;the same&quot; as the Cartesian product '''R'''×'''R''' (&quot;the same&quot; meaning that any point in one determines a unique point in the other and for the result of calculations it doesn't matter which one is used for the calculation).

== Paradoxes ==
We referred earlier to the need for a formal, axiomatic approach. What problems arise in the treatment we have given? The problems relate to the formation of sets. One's first intuition might be that we can form any set we want, but this view leads to inconsistencies. For any set ''x'' we can ask whether ''x'' is a member of itself. Define
:''Z''&amp;nbsp;= {''x''&amp;nbsp;: ''x'' is not a member of ''x''}.
Now for the problem: is ''Z'' a member of ''Z''? If yes, then by the defining quality of ''Z'', ''Z'' is not a member of itself, i.e., ''Z'' is not a member of ''Z''. This forces us to declare that ''Z'' is not a member of ''Z''. Then ''Z'' is not a member of itself and so, again by definition of ''Z'', ''Z'' is a member of ''Z''.
Thus both options lead us to a contradiction and we have an inconsistent theory. More succinctly, one says that ''Z'' is a member of ''Z'' if and only if ''Z'' is not a member of ''Z''. Axiomatic developments place restrictions on the sort of sets we are allowed to form and thus prevent problems like our set ''Z'' from arising. This particular paradox is [[Russell's paradox]].

The penalty is that one must take more care with one's development, as one must in any rigorous mathematical argument.
In particular, it is problematic to speak of a set of everything, or to be (possibly) a bit less ambitious, even a [[set of all sets]].
In fact, in the standard axiomatisation of set theory, there is no set of all sets.
In areas of mathematics that seem to require a set of all sets (such as [[category theory]]), one can sometimes make do with a universal set so large that all of ordinary mathematics can be done within it (see [[universe (mathematics)|universe]]).
Alternatively, one can make use of [[class (set theory)|proper classes]].
Or, one can use a different axiomatisation of set theory, such as [[W. V. Quine]]'s [[New Foundations]], which allows for a set of all sets and avoids Russell's paradox in another way.

{{phonation}}
'''Breathy voice''' (also called '''murmured voice''', '''soughing''', or '''susurration''') is a [[phonation]] in which the [[vocal cords]] vibrate, as they do in normal (modal) voicing, but are held further apart, so that a larger volume of air escapes between them. This produces an audible noise. A breathy-voiced phonation {{IPA|[ɦ]}} (not actually a [[fricative]], as a literal reading of the IPA chart would suggest) can sometimes be heard as an [[allophone]] of English /h/ between vowels, e.g. in the word ''behind'', for some speakers. A stop with breathy-voiced release (symbolized either as {{IPA|[bʱ], [dʱ], [ɡʱ],}} etc. or as {{IPA|[b̤], [d̤], [ɡ̈],}} etc.) is like [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] in that it delays the onset of full voicing. This is the phonation of the [[Hindi]] &quot;voiced aspirated stops&quot;: ''bh, dh, ḍh, jh,'' and ''gh.'' Breathy-voiced vowels are written {{IPA|[a̤], [e̤],}} etc.

In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], the diacritic for breathy voice is {{IPA diacritic description|0324|COMBINING DIAERESIS BELOW|.}} For glyphs with [[descender]], {{IPA diacritic description|0308|COMBINING DIAERESIS}} is used.

==Methods of production==
There are several ways to produce breathy-voiced sounds like {{IPAblink|ɦ}}. One is to hold the vocal cords apart, so that they are lax as they are for {{IPA|[h]}}, but to increase the volume of airflow so that they vibrate loosely. A second is to bring the vocal cords closer together along their entire length than in voiceless {{IPA|[h]}}, but not as close as in modally voiced sounds such as vowels. This results in an airflow intermediate between {{IPA|[h]}} and vowels, and is the case with English intervocalic /h/. A third is to constrict the glottis, but separate the [[arytenoid cartilage]]s that control one end. This results in the vocal cords being drawn together for voicing in the back, but separated to allow the passage of large volumes of air in the front. This is the situation with Hindi.

==Breathy voice as a phonological property==
A number of languages use breathy voicing in a phonologically contrastive way. [[Indic languages]], such as [[Hindi]], typically have a four-way contrast among plosives and affricates (voiced, breathy voiced, [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]], aspirated) and a two-way contrast among nasals (voiced, breathy voiced). The [[Nguni languages]] in the southern [[Bantu language]]s family, including [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Ndebele language|Ndebele]] and [[Swati language|Swati]], also have contrastive breathy voice. In the case of Xhosa, there is a four-way contrast analogous to Indic in oral [[click consonant|clicks]], and similarly a two-way contrast among nasal clicks, but a three-way contrast among plosives and affricates (breathy voiced, aspirated, and [[ejective consonant|ejective]]), and two-way contrasts among fricatives (voiceless and breathy voiced) and nasals (voiced and breathy voiced).

In some Bantu languages, historically breathy-voiced stops have been phonetically devoiced,&lt;ref&gt;Traill, Anthony, James S. M. Khumalo and Paul Fridjhon (1987). Depressing facts about Zulu. African Studies 46: 255-274.&lt;/ref&gt; but the four-way contrast in the system has been retained. In all five of the southeastern Bantu languages named, the breathy voiced stops (even if they are realised phonetically as devoiced aspirates) have a marked tone-lowering (or tone-depressing) effect on the following [[tautosyllabic]] vowels. For this reason, such stop consonants are frequently referred to in the local linguistic literature as 'depressor' stops.

[[Swati language|Swati]], and even more so [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], display good evidence that breathy voicing can be used as a morphological property independent of any consonant voicing value. For example, in both languages, the standard morphological mechanism for achieving the [[morphosyntactic]] [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] is to simply execute the noun prefix syllable as breathy voiced (or 'depressed').

In [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]], vowels after the [[stressed syllable]] can be pronounced with breathy voice.&lt;ref&gt;Callou, Dinah. Leite, Yonne. &quot;Iniciação à Fonética e à Fonologia&quot;. Jorge Zahar Editor 2001, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[number theory]], '''Bézout's identity''' for two integers ''a'', ''b'' is an expression
: &lt;math&gt; ax+by=d \, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''x'' and ''y'' are integers (called ''Bézout coefficients'' for (''a'',''b'')), which is such that ''d'' is a common [[divisor]] of ''a'' and ''b''. '''Bézout's [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]]''' states that such coefficients exist for every pair of nonzero integers (''a'',''b''), with in addition {{nowrap|''d'' &amp;gt; 0}}, which is then in fact their [[greatest common divisor]] and also the smallest positive integer that can be written in this form for any integers ''x'',''y''. This value of ''d'' is therefore uniquely determined by ''a'' and ''b'', but the Bézout coefficients are not unique. A pair of Bézout coefficients (in fact the ones that are minimal in [[absolute value]]) can be computed by the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]]. The identity, coefficients and lemma are named after the [[French people|French]] [[mathematician]] [[Étienne Bézout]].

In [[abstract algebra]], certain pairs of elements of an [[integral domain]] may also admit such an identity, but this need not be the case for all pairs of nonzero elements. Bézout's lemma does however remain valid in any [[principal ideal domain]].

==History==
[[Étienne Bézout]] (1730–1783) proved this identity for polynomials. However, this statement for integers can be found already in the work of French mathematician [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac]] (1581–1638).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Tignol | first=Jean-Pierre | title=Galois' Theory of Algebraic Equations | publisher=World Scientific| location=Singapore | year=2001 | isbn=981-02-4541-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithm==
The Bézout numbers ''x'' and ''y'' as above can be determined with the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]]. However, they are not unique. If one solution is given by (''x'', ''y''), then there are infinitely many solutions. These are given by
:&lt;math&gt; \left\{ \left(x+\frac{kb}{\gcd(a,b)},\ y-\frac{ka}{\gcd(a,b)}\right) \mid k \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
The greatest common divisor of 12 and 42 is 6. Bézout's identity states that there must exist an integer solution for ''x'' and ''y'' in the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt; 12x + 42y = 6. \, &lt;/math&gt;

One of its solutions is ''x'' = &amp;minus;3 and ''y'' = 1: indeed, we have (&amp;minus;3)·12 + 1·42 = 6. Another solution is ''x'' = 4 and ''y'' = &amp;minus;1.

==Generalizations==
Bézout's identity can be extended to linear combinations of more than two numbers. For any numbers &lt;math&gt;a_1, \ldots, a_n&lt;/math&gt; with greatest common divisor ''d'' there exist integers &lt;math&gt;x_1, \ldots, x_n&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;a_1 x_1 + \cdots + a_n x_n = d.&lt;/math&gt;

The greatest common divisor of &lt;math&gt;a_1, \ldots, a_n&lt;/math&gt; is in fact the smallest positive integer that can be written as a linear combination of &lt;math&gt;a_1, \ldots, a_n&lt;/math&gt;.

Bézout's identity works not only in the [[ring (algebra)|ring]] of integers, but also in any other [[principal ideal domain]] (PID).
That is, if ''R'' is a PID, and ''a'' and ''b'' are elements of ''R'', and ''d'' is a greatest common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'',
then there are elements ''x'' and ''y'' in ''R'' such that ''ax'' + ''by'' = ''d''. The reason: the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] ''Ra''+''Rb'' is principal and indeed is equal to ''Rd''.
An integral domain in which Bézout's identity holds is called a [[Bézout domain]].

==Proof==

A proof of Bézout's lemma can be given using of the fact that the integers form a [[Euclidean domain]] (for the absolute value), as affirmed by the [[Division algorithm#Statement of theorem|defining property]] of Euclidean division of integers, namely that the remainder of a division by a nonzero integer ''b'' has a [[remainder]] strictly less than |''b''|. For given nonzero integers ''a'' and ''b'' there is a nonzero integer {{nowrap|''d'' {{=}} ''as'' + ''bt''}} of minimal absolute among all those of the form ''ax'' + ''by'' with ''x'' and ''y'' integers; one can assume ''d'' &amp;gt; 0 by changing the signs of both ''s'' and ''t'' if necessary. Now the remainder of dividing either ''a'' or ''b'' by ''d'' is also of the form ''ax'' + ''by'' since it is obtained by subtracting a multiple of {{nowrap|''d'' {{=}} ''as'' + ''bt''}} from ''a'' or ''b'', and on the other hand it has to be strictly smaller in absolute value than ''d''. This leaves 0 as only possibility for such a remainder, so ''d'' divides ''a'' and ''b'' exactly.
If ''c'' is another common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'', then ''c'' also divides ''as'' + ''bt'' = ''d'', which means that ''d'' is the greatest common divisor of ''a'' and ''b''; this completes the proof.

'''''Banacek''''' (one of the rotating ''[[NBC Mystery Movie]]'' series) is a short-lived, light-hearted detective [[Television programs|TV series]] starring [[George Peppard]] on [[NBC]] from 1972 to 1974. It alternated in its timeslot with several other shows but was the only one to last beyond its first season. It was later rebroadcast on [[A&amp;E Network]].

The show had a mixture of humor combined with rather intricate plots that never generated strong ratings. Despite this, the show was well received by critics and was picked up for a third season. However, before the third season could start production, Peppard quit the show in order to prevent his ex-wife [[Elizabeth Ashley]] from receiving a larger percentage of his earnings as part of their divorce settlement. 

==Premise==
Peppard played Thomas Banacek, a suave, [[Polish-American]] freelance investigator based in [[Boston]], who solved seemingly impossible thefts (see [[locked room mystery]]). He then collected from the insurance companies 10% of the insured value of the recovered property. One of Banacek's verbal signatures was the quotation of strangely worded yet curiously cogent &quot;[[Poland|Polish]]&quot; proverbs such as:
* If you're not sure that it's potato [[borscht]], there could be children working in the mines.
* Though the hippopotamus has no sting, the wise man would prefer to be sat upon by the bee.
* A wise man never plays leapfrog with a unicorn.
* If a wolf is after your sleigh throw him a raisin cookie—but don't stop to bake him a cake.
* Just because the cat has her kittens in the oven doesn't make them biscuits.

Another recurring gag was for other characters to mispronounce his name, often (particularly in the case of rivals) deliberately. The name &quot;Banaczek&quot; (as pronounced in the show) is actually very rare in Poland. The closest Polish names in common use are Banaszak (bah-NAH-shack) and Banasik (bah-NAH-sheek). In fact, Banáček is a Czech surname.

Also featured were [[Ralph Manza]] as Banacek's chauffeur Jay Drury, [[Murray Matheson]] as rare-bookstore owner and information source Felix Mulholland and [[Christine Belford]] as Carlie Kirkland, Banacek's sometime-lover and always-rival.

The [[United States Navy]]'s '''Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron''', popularly known as the '''Blue Angels''', first performed in 1946&lt;ref name=OFFICIAL&gt;[http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/history.htm History of the Blue Angels], Blue Angels official website.&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently the oldest formal flying aerobatic team. The squadron's six demonstration pilots fly the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18 Hornet]] in more than 70 shows at 34 locations throughout the United States each year, where they still employ many of the same practices and techniques used in their aerial displays in 1946. Since their inception, the &quot;Blues&quot; have flown a variety of different aircraft types for more than 427 million spectators worldwide.

==Mission==
The mission of the Blue Angels is to enhance Navy and Marine Corps recruiting, and credibly represent Navy and Marine Corps aviation to the United States and its Armed Forces to America and other countries as international ambassadors of good will.

==Air show overview==
The Blue Angels show season runs each year from March until November. They perform at military and civilian airfields, and often perform directly over major cities such as [[San Francisco]]'s &quot;[[Fleet Week]]&quot; maritime festival, [[Cleveland]]'s bi-annual Labor Day Air Show, and [[Seattle]]'s annual [[Seafair]] festival.

During the [[aerobatic]] demonstration, the Blue Angels operate six F/A-18 Hornet aircraft, split into the '''Diamond''' (Blue Angels 1 through 4) and the Lead and Opposing '''Solos''' (Blue Angels 5 and 6). Most of the show alternates between [[Aerobatic maneuver|maneuver]]s performed by the Diamond and those performed by the Solos. The Diamond, in tight formation and usually at lower speeds, performs maneuvers such as formation loops, barrel rolls, and transitions from one formation to another. The Solos fly many of their maneuvers just under the [[speed of sound]], showcasing the high performance capabilities of their individual ''Hornets'' through the execution of high-speed passes, slow passes, fast rolls, slow rolls, and very tight turns.  Some of the maneuvers include both solo F/A-18s performing at once, such as opposing passes (toward each other in what appears to be a collision course) and mirror formations (back-to-back. belly-to-belly, or wingtip-to-wingtip, with one jet flying inverted). The Solos join the Diamond near the end of the show for a number of maneuvers in the [[Delta formation]]. 

The parameters of each show must be tailored to local weather: in clear weather the &quot;high&quot; show is performed; in overcast conditions a &quot;low&quot; show is performed, and in limited visibility (weather permitting) the &quot;flat&quot; show is presented. The &quot;high&quot; show requires an {{convert|8000|ft|m|-2|sing=on}} [[Flight ceiling|ceiling]] and visibility of {{convert|3|nmi|km|0}} from the show's centerpoint. &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;flat&quot; ceilings are 3,500 feet (~1 km) and {{convert|1500|ft|m|-1}} respectively.

==Squadron nickname, insignia and paint scheme==
[[File:BlueAngelsFA18.jpg|right|thumb|[[Prandtl-Glauert singularity|Water condensation]] in the [[Strake (aviation)|strake]] vortices of a Hornet during a tight maneuver.]]

When initially formed, the unit was called the Navy Flight Exhibition Team. The squadron was officially redesignated as the United States Navy Flight Demonstration ''Squadron'' in December 1974. The original team adopted the nickname ''Blue Angels'' in 1946, when one of them came across the name of New York City's Blue Angel nightclub in the [[New Yorker Magazine]]. The team introduced themselves as the &quot;Blue Angels&quot; to the public for the first time on July 21, 1946 in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].

The official Blue Angels insignia was designed by then team leader Lt. Cmdr. R.E. &quot;Dusty&quot; Rhodes and approved by [[Chief of Naval Operations]] in 1949. It is nearly identical to the current design. In the cloud in the upper right quadrant, the aircraft were originally shown heading down and to the right. Over the years, the plane silhouettes have changed along with the squadron's aircraft. Additionally, the lower left quadrant, which contains the Chief of Naval Air Training insignia, has occasionally contained only [[Naval Aviator]] wings.

Originally, demonstration aircraft were [[navy blue]] (nearly [[black]]) with [[Gold (color)|gold]] lettering. The current shades of [[blue]] and [[yellow]] were adopted when the team transitioned to the Bearcat in 1946. For a single year in 1949, the team performed in a blinding all-yellow scheme with blue markings.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''War Paint'', p171&lt;/ref&gt; The current paint scheme, including yellow stripe markings along the top of the fuselage, and &quot;U.S. Navy&quot; on the bottom of the wings, was designed by team member [[Robert L. Rasmussen]] in 1957.

==Current aircraft==
The &quot;Blues&quot; F/A-18 aircraft are former fleet aircraft that are nearly combat-ready. According to the Navy, they can be repainted and readied for combat service in just 72 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;ba_faq&quot;&gt;[http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/docs/faq.pdf Blue Angels Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt; Significant modifications to each aircraft include removal of the aircraft gun and replacement with the tank that contains the paraffin-based smoked oil used in demonstrations, installation of inverted fuel pumps to increase the time aircraft can spend inverted without fuel starvation, and outfitting with the control stick spring system that is used to facilitate more precise aircraft control inputs. The standard demonstration configuration is such that the pilot must overcome {{convert|40|lb}} of nose-down stick input to maintain level flight. The Blue Angels do not wear [[G-suit]]s, because the air bladders inside them would repeatedly deflate and inflate, interfering with the control stick between the pilot's legs.

The show narrator flies Blue Angel 7&amp;mdash;a two-seat F/A-18B&amp;mdash;to show sites. The Blue Angels use this jet for backup, and to give demonstration flights to civilians (usually members of the press). The #4 slot pilot often flies the #7 aircraft in Friday &quot;practice&quot; shows.

The Blue Angels use a [[United States Marine Corps]] [[C-130 Hercules|C-130T Hercules]] nicknamed &quot;Fat Albert&quot; for logistics, carrying spare parts, equipment, and to carry support personnel between shows. Starting in 1975, &quot;Bert&quot; was used for [[JATO|Jet Assisted Take Off]] (JATO) and short aerial demonstrations just prior to the main event at selected venues, but the JATO demonstration ended in 2009 due to dwindling supplies of rockets.&lt;ref name=&quot;FA JATO&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Abort Launch: Air shows to do without Fat Albert’s famed JATO|last=McCullough|first=Amy|date=2009-11-09|work=[[Marine Corps Times]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|pages=6|accessdate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Fat Albert Airlines&quot; flies with an all-Marine crew of three officers and five enlisted personnel.

==Team members==
[[File:Voris and 1st Blue Angel team 1946.jpg|thumb|right|The first Blue Angel Flight Demonstration Squadron, 1946&amp;ndash;1947  assembled in front of one of their [[F6F Hellcat]]s (l to r): Lt. Al Taddeo, Solo; Lt. (J.G.) Gale Stouse, Spare; Lt. Cdr. R.M. &quot;Butch&quot; Voris, Flight Leader; Lt. Maurice &quot;Wick&quot; Wickendoll, Right Wing; Lt. Mel Cassidy, Left Wing.]]

All team members, both officer and enlisted, come from the ranks of regular Navy and [[United States Marine Corps]] units. The demonstration pilots and narrator are made up of Navy and USMC [[Naval Aviator]]s. Pilots typically serve two years, and position assignments are made according to team needs, pilot experience levels, and career considerations for members. The team leader (#1) is the Commanding Officer and is always a Navy Commander, who may be promoted to Captain mid-tour depending on if he has been approved for Captain by the selection board. Pilots of numbers 2-7 are Navy Lieutenants or Lieutenant Commanders. There are usually one or two Marines among this group, ranked Captain or Major. The number 7 pilot narrates for a year, and then typically flies Opposing and then Lead Solo the following two years, respectively. The number 3 pilot moves to the number 4 (slot) position for his second year. Blue Angel #4 serves as the demonstration safety officer, due largely to the perspective he is afforded from the slot position within the formation, as well as his status as a second-year demonstration pilot. There are a number of other officers in the squadron, including a [[Naval Flight Officer]], the USMC C-130 pilots, a Maintenance Officer, an Administrative Officer, and a Flight Surgeon.  Enlisted members range from E-4 to E-9, and perform all maintenance, administrative, and support functions. After serving with the &quot;Blues&quot;, members return to fleet assignments.

==Training and weekly routine==
[[File:Blues Support Crew watching Diamond Formation at Show.jpg|thumb|right|The &quot;Blues&quot; support crew watches the team perform in the [[Grumman F9F-2 Panther]] jet fighter.]]

Annual winter training takes place at [[NAF El Centro]], California, where new and returning pilots hone skills learned in the fleet. During winter training, the pilots will fly two practice sessions per day, six days a week, in order to fly the 120 training missions needed to perform the demonstration safely. Separation between the formation of aircraft and their maneuver altitude is gradually reduced over the course of about two months in January and February. The team returns to their home base of [[Pensacola]], Florida in March, and continues to practice throughout the show season. A typical week during the season has practices at NAS Pensacola on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. The team then flies to its show venue for the week on Thursday, conducting &quot;circle and arrival&quot; orientation maneuvers upon arrival. The team flies a &quot;practice&quot; airshow at the show site on Friday. This show is attended by invited guests but is often open to the general public. The main airshows are conducted on Saturdays and Sundays, with the team returning home on Sunday evenings. Mondays are the only regular day off.

==History==
===1940s===
 [[File:F6F-5 Blue Angels NAN10 46.jpg|thumb|[[Grumman F6F Hellcat|Grumman F6F-5 Hellcats]] in 1946]]

On April 24, 1946 [[Chief of Naval Operations]] [[Admiral]] [[Chester Nimitz]] issued a directive ordering the formation of a flight exhibition team to boost Navy morale, demonstrate naval air power, and maintain public interest in naval aviation. However, an underlying mission was to help the Navy generate public and political support for a larger allocation of the shrinking defense budget. In April of that year, Rear Admiral Ralph Davison personally selected [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Roy Marlin Voris|Roy Marlin &quot;Butch&quot; Voris]], a World War II [[fighter ace]], to assemble and train a flight demonstration team, naming him Officer-in-Charge and Flight Leader. Voris selected three fellow instructors to join him (Lt. Maurice &quot;Wick&quot; Wickendoll, Lt. Mel Cassidy, and Lt. Cmdr. Lloyd Barnard, veterans of the War in the Pacific), and they spent countless hours developing the show. The group perfected its initial maneuvers in secret over the Florida [[Everglades]] so that, in Voris' words, &quot;...if anything happened, just the alligators would know.&quot; The team's first demonstration before Navy officials took place on May 10, 1946 and was met with enthusiastic approval.

On June 15 Voris led a trio of [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|Grumman F6F-5 Hellcats]], specially modified to reduce weight and painted sea blue with gold leaf trim, through their inaugural 15-minute-long performance at their [[Florida]] home base, [[Naval Air Station Jacksonville]].&lt;ref name=OFFICIAL/&gt; The team employed an [[T-6 Texan|SNJ Texan]], painted and configured to simulate a [[Japanese Zero]], to simulate aerial combat. This aircraft was later painted yellow and dubbed the &quot;Beetle Bomb&quot;.

The team thrilled spectators with low-flying maneuvers performed in tight formations, and (according to Voris) by &quot;...keeping something in front of the crowds at all times. My objective was to beat the Army Air Corps. If we did that, we'd get all the other side issues. I felt that if we weren't the best, it would be my naval career.&quot; The Blue Angels' first public demonstration also netted the team its first trophy, which sits on display at the team's current home at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]]. 
[[File:F8F-1 Blue Angels 1946.jpg|thumb|left|On August 25, 1946 the Blue Angels switched to the Grumman [[F8F Bearcat|F8F-1 Bearcat]] and introduced the famous &quot;diamond&quot; formation at the World Air Carnival in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].]] 
The team soon became known worldwide for its spectacular aerobatic maneuvers. On August 25, 1946 the squadron upgraded their aircraft to the [[F8F Bearcat|F8F-1 Bearcat]]. 
In 1949, the team acquired a Douglas [[C-47|R4D Sky Train]] for logistics to and from show sites. The team's SNJ was also replaced by a F8F-1 &quot;Bearcat&quot;, painted yellow for the air combat routine. The Blues transitioned to the straight-wing Grumman [[F9F Panther|F9F-2 Panther]] on July 13, 1949, wherein the F8F-1 &quot;Beetle Bomb&quot; was relegated to solo aerobatics before the main show, until it crashed on takeoff at a training show in Pensacola in 1950.

Team headquarters shifted from [[NAS Corpus Christi]], Texas, to [[Naval Air Station Whiting Field|NAAS Whiting Field]], Florida, in the fall of 1949, announced 14 July 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Fort Walton, Florida, &quot;'''Blue Angels' To Pensacola - Navy Flight Exhibition Team Is Transferred''&quot;, Playground News, Thursday 14 July 1949, Volume 4, Number 24, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s===
The &quot;Blues&quot; continued to perform nationwide until the start of the [[Korean War]] in 1950, when (due to a shortage of pilots, and no planes were available) the team was disbanded and its members were ordered to combat duty. Once aboard the aircraft carrier {{USS|Princeton|CV-37|6}} the group formed the core of [[VF-191]] ('''Satan's Kittens''').

The Blue Angels were officially recommissioned on October 25, 1951, and reported to [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi|NAS Corpus Christi]], Texas. Lt. Cdr. Voris was again tasked with assembling the team (he was the first of only two commanding officers to lead them twice). In 1953 the team traded its Sky Train for a Curtiss [[C-46|R5C Commando]]. 

The ''Blues'' remained in Corpus Christi until the winter of 1954, when they relocated to their present home at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]]. It was here they progressed to the swept-wing Grumman [[F9F Cougar|F9F-8 Cougar]]. 

[[File:F9F-8 Blue Angles1 NAN1-57.jpg|thumb|left|F9F-8 ''Cougar'' formation in 1956]]
The first [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] pilot, Capt Chuck Hiett, joined the team and they relocated to their current home of [[NAS Pensacola]] in the winter of 1954. In August 1954, &quot;Blues&quot; leader LCDR Ray Hawkins becomes the first naval aviator to survive an ejection at supersonic speeds when his F9F-6 became uncontrollable on a cross-country flight. 

In Sept 1956, the team added a sixth aircraft to the flight demonstration in the Opposing Solo position, and gave its first performance outside the United States at the International Air Exposition in [[Toronto, Canada]]. It also upgraded its logistics aircraft to the Douglas [[C-54|R5D Skymaster]]. 

[[File:Grumman F11F-1 Tiger Blue Angels.jpg|thumb|Grumman F11F-1 ''Tiger'', 1957-69]]
In January 1957, the team left its winter training facility at [[Naval Air Facility El Centro]], California for a ten year period. For the next ten years, the team would winter at [[NAS Key West]], Florida.  For the 1957 show season, the Blue Angels transitioned to the supersonic Grumman [[F11F Tiger|F11F-1 Tiger]], first flying the short-nosed, and then the long-nosed versions. The first Six-Plane Delta Maneuvers were added in the 1958 season.

===1960s===
In July 1964, the Blue Angels participated in the Aeronaves de Mexico Anniversary Air Show over [[Mexico City]], Mexico, before an estimated crowd of 1.5 million people.

In 1965, the Blue Angels conducted a [[Caribbean]] island tour, flying at five sites. Later that year, they embarked on a European tour to a dozen sites, including the [[Paris Air Show]], where they were the only team to receive a standing ovation.

The ''Blues'' toured Europe again in 1967 touring six sites. In 1968 Skymaster transport aircraft was replaced with a C-121J Constellation. The ''Blues'' transitioned to the two-seat [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4J Phantom II]] in 1969, nearly always keeping the back seat empty for flight demonstrations. The ''Phantom'' was the only plane to be flown by both the &quot;Blues&quot; and the [[United States Air Force]] [[Thunderbirds (squadron)|Thunderbirds]].  That year they also upgraded to the 'Lockheed [[Lockheed Constellation|C-121 Super Constellation]] for logistics.

===1970s===
[[File:Blue Angels F-4Js NAN10-69.jpg|thumb|McDonnell F-4J ''Phantom II''s]]
The ''Blues'' received their first U.S Marine Corps Lockheed [[C-130 Hercules|KC-130F Hercules (Bureau Number 150690)]] in 1970. An all-Marine crew manned it. That year, they went on their first South American tour. In 1971, the team conducted its first Far East Tour, performing at a dozen locations in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Guam, and the Philippines. In 1972, the Blue Angels were awarded the Navy's [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] for the two-year period from March 1, 1970 - December 31, 1971. Another European tour followed in 1973, including air shows in Tehran, Iran, England, France, Spain, Turkey, Greece, and Italy.

In December 1974 the Navy Flight Demonstration Team downsized to the subsonic McDonnell Douglas [[A-4 Skyhawk|A-4F Skyhawk II]] and was reorganized into the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron. This reorganization permitted the establishment of a commanding officer (the flight leader), added support officers, and further redefined the squadron's mission emphasizing the support of recruiting efforts. Commander Tony Less was the squadron's first official commanding officer.&lt;ref name=Blue_Angels_history&gt;[http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/history_iframe.htm History of the Blue Angles]. blueangels.navy.mil.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
On November 8, 1986 the Blue Angels completed their 40th anniversary year during ceremonies unveiling their present aircraft, the McDonnell Douglas [[F/A-18 Hornet]], the first multi-role fighter/attack aircraft. The power and aerodynamics of the Hornet allows them to perform a slow, high [[angle of attack]] &quot;tail sitting&quot; maneuver, and to fly a &quot;dirty&quot; (landing gear down) formation loop, the last of which is not duplicated by the [[U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds|Thunderbirds]]. 

Also in 1986, LCDR [[Donnie Cochran]], joined the Blue Angels as the first [[Black people|African-American]] Naval Aviator to be selected. He would return to lead the team in 1993.

===1990s===

In 1992 the Blue Angels deployed for a month-long European tour, their first in 19 years, conducting shows in Sweden, Finland, Russia (the first foreign flight demonstration team to perform there), Romania, Bulgaria, Italy, the United Kingdom and Spain.  
In 1998, CDR Patrick Driscoll made the first &quot;Blue Jet&quot; landing on a &quot;[[haze gray and underway]]&quot; aircraft carrier, [[USS Harry S. Truman|USS ''Harry S. Truman'']] (CVN-75).

===2000s===
[[File:Blue Angeles flying in formation1.jpg|thumb|right|F/A-18s Performing in San Francisco]]
In 2006, the Blue Angels marked their 60th year of performing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.com/about/navylife/onduty/blueangels/history/ Blue Angels Monumental Moments]&lt;/ref&gt; On October 30, 2008 a spokesman for the team announced that the team would complete its last three performances of the year with five jets instead of six. The change was because one pilot and another officer in the organization had been removed from duty for engaging in an &quot;inappropriate relationship&quot;. The Navy stated that one of the individuals was a man and the other a woman, one a Marine and the other from the Navy, and that Rear Admiral Mark Guadagnini, chief of Naval air training, was reviewing the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pnj.com/article/20081031/SPORTS1001/810310363|title=Blues Angels Pilot, Other Grounded|last=Moon|first=Troy|date=2008-10-31|publisher=[[Pensacola News Journal]]|accessdate=2008-11-04}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the next performance at [[Lackland Air Force Base]] following the announcement the #4 or slot pilot, was absent from the formation.

Fat Albert performed its final JATO demonstration at the 2009 Pensacola Homecoming show, spending their 8 remaining JATO bottles. This demonstration not only was the last JATO performance of the squadron, but also the final JATO profile of the entire US Marine Corps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/docs/pr_20090909.pdf &quot;End of JATO for Blue Angels!&quot;], blueangels.navy.mil, November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Redirect|New Birth}}

In Christianity, '''born again''' refers to a &quot;spiritual rebirth&quot; ([[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]]) of the human soul or spirit, contrasted with the physical birth everyone experiences.  The origin of the term &quot;born again&quot; is the [[New Testament]]: &quot;[[Jesus]] replied, 'Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being ''born again''.'&quot;{{Bibleref2c|John|3:3||Jn 3:3 TNIV}}&lt;ref&gt;or &quot;born from above&quot; according to some other translations&lt;/ref&gt; It is a term associated with [[salvation]] in Christianity.

Throughout most of Christian history, to be &quot;born again&quot; was understood as [[baptismal regeneration|spiritual regeneration]] via the [[sacrament]] of [[baptism]]. This is still the understanding in [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Anglicanism]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. However, beginning with the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], being ''born again''&lt;ref name=&quot;GoodWord&quot;&gt;&quot;born-again.&quot; ''Good Word Guide.'' London: A&amp;C Black, 2007. Credo Reference. 30 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; is predominantly understood by Protestants (Episcopalians and Lutherans are two notable exceptions to this understanding) to be an experience of [[Religious conversion|conversion]] symbolized by water baptism, rooted in commitment to one's personal faith in Jesus Christ for salvation. 

It is believed when a person accepts Jesus as the [[Messiah]] and receives the Holy Spirit, a radical &quot;change of heart&quot; ({{Bibleref2|Ezekiel|36:26|ESV}}) occurs. This change is marked by an aversion to [[sin]] and passion for obedience to the [[Law of Christ|commandments of Jesus Christ]], as outlined in the [[Christian scriptures]]. Many associate the term &quot;born again&quot; with the revelation of a new concept, or an experience of [[Religious conversion|conversion]], defined as mental assent to the acceptance of Jesus Christ as one's personal Saviour, though this experience or mental assent (See [[Gnosticism]]) is not alone sufficient to merit [[Christian salvation]] but rather [[repentance]], the aforementioned &quot;new birth&quot; of the Holy Spirit, and faith in [[Jesus Christ]]'s [[propitiation]] for sins.&lt;ref&gt;fundamentalism. (2010). In ''Encyclopædia Britannica.'' Retrieved September 17, 2010, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following Acts 2:38:&lt;blockquote&gt;And Peter said to them, &quot;Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Acts|2:38}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; this change is believed by some denominations to come from repentance, water baptism, and subsequent receipt of holy spirit. However, other denominations believe, following Romans 10:9: &lt;blockquote&gt;If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. {{Bibleref2c|Romans|10:9|TNIV}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; that confession of Christ as Lord and sincere belief in his resurrection is sufficient for salvation. 


The [[Oxford English Dictionary]], finding examples going back to 1961, defines the adjective ''born-again'' as:&lt;blockquote&gt;Of, pertaining to, or characterized by (an experience of) new birth in Christ or spiritual renewal; of a Christian: placing special emphasis on this experience as a basis for all one's actions, evangelical.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origin==
===Biblical foundation===
Most English Bibles contain three uses of the phrase ''born again''. The first is in the Gospel of John, Chapter 3 ({{Bibleref2|John|3|KJV}}), verse 3, used by Jesus while speaking to [[Nicodemus]], a rabbi of the Jewish sect known as the [[Pharisees]], who is referred to as &quot;a ruler of the Jews&quot;. Nicodemus says that, because of his miracles, Jesus is known &quot;to be a teacher come from God&quot;. Jesus immediately makes the statement (in the King James translation): &quot;Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God&quot;.

Also, in the same Gospel, in verses 7 and 8, Jesus says:&lt;blockquote&gt;Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. / The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The John Gospel was written in Greek, and the Greek word translated as ''again'' is ''ανωΘεν'' (anothen), which could mean ''again'', or ''from above''.

The third and last mention of the phrase is in the First Letter of Peter ({{Bibleref2|Peter|1|KJV}}), verses 22-23. The King James Bible translates this as:&lt;blockquote&gt;Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, [see that ye] love one another with a pure heart fervently: / Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here, the Greek word translated as ''born again'' is ''αναγεγεννημενοι'' (anagegennemenoy).

===Interpretations===
The traditional Jewish understanding of the promise of salvation was that being rooted in &quot;the seed of Abraham&quot; referred to physical lineage from Abraham. Jesus explained to Nicodemus that this doctrine was in error—that every person must have two births—the natural birth of the physical body, the other of the water and the spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Emmons, Samuel B. ''A Bible Dictionary.'' BiblioLife, 2008. ISBN 9780554891088.&lt;/ref&gt; This discourse with Nicodemus established the Christian belief that all human beings—whether Jew or Gentile—must be &quot;born again&quot; of the spiritual seed of Christ. The [[Apostle Peter]] further reinforced this understanding in {{Bibleref2|1Peter|1:23|KJV|1 Peter 1:23}}.{{Or|date=July 2010}} The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' states that &quot;A controversy existed in the primitive church over the interpretation of the expression ''the [[seed of Abraham]]''. It is &lt;nowiki&gt;[the Apostle Paul's]&lt;/nowiki&gt; teaching in one instance that all who are Christ's by faith are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to promise. He is concerned, however, with the fact that the promise is not being fulfilled to the seed of Abraham (referring to the Jews).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Driscoll, James F. &quot;Divine Promise (in Scripture).&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 15 Nov. 2009 &lt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12453a.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Bible]], to be &quot;born again&quot; is associated with terms including new birth, resurrection, new life, new creation, renewing of the mind, dying to sin and living to righteousness, translation from darkness to light, etc.&lt;ref name=Hodge1&gt;Hodge, Charles. &quot;Regeneration.&quot; ''Systematic Theology-Volume III.'' Web: &lt;http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology3.iii.i.i.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus Christ used the &quot;birth&quot; analogy in tracing spiritual newness of life to a divine beginning. Contemporary Christian theologians have provided explanations for &quot;born from above&quot; being a more accurate translation of the original Greek word transliterated ''anōthen.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchgodsword.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=509 ''The New Testament Greek Lexicon.''] July 30, 2009. Online:&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Theologian Frank Stagg]] cites two reasons why the newer translation is significant:
# The emphasis &quot;from ''above''&quot; (implying &quot;from ''Heaven''&quot;) calls attention to the source of the &quot;newness of life.&quot; Stagg writes that the word &quot;again&quot; does not include the ''source'' of the new kind of beginning
# More than personal improvement is needed. &quot;...a new destiny requires a new origin, and the new origin must be from God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. ''Woman in the World of Jesus.'' Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1978. ISBN 0-664-24195-6&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of the term in its more modern use is found in the sermons of [[John Wesley]]. In the sermon printed under the title of ''A New Birth'', he said &quot;none can be holy unless he be born again&quot;, and &quot;except he be born again, none can be happy even in this world. For ... a man should not be happy who is not holy.&quot; Also, &quot;I say, [a man] may be born again and so become an heir of salvation.&quot; Furthermore, although infants who are baptized are born again, for adults it is different:&lt;blockquote&gt;... our church supposes, that all who are baptized in their infancy, are at the same time born again. ... But ... it is sure all of riper years, who are baptized, are not at the same time born again.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley, J., ''The works of  the Reverend John Wesley'', Methodist Episcopal Church, 1831, pp. 405-406.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Public stances==

In recent history, ''born again'' is a term that has been widely associated with the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian renewal since the late 1960s, first in the United States and then later around the world. Associated perhaps initially with [[Jesus movement|Jesus People]] and the Christian counterculture, ''born again'' came to refer to a conversion experience, accepting Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior in order to be saved from Hell and given eternal life with God in Heaven, and was increasingly used as a term to identify devout believers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} By the mid 1970s, ''born again'' Christians were increasingly referred to in the mainstream media as part of the born again movement.

In 1976, Watergate conspirator [[Chuck Colson]]'s book ''Born Again'' gained international notice. TIME magazine named him &quot;One of the 25 Most Influential Evangelicals in America.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101050207/photoessay/5.html The 25 Most Influential Evangelicals in America.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was sufficiently prevalent that during the year's Presidential campaign [[Jimmy Carter]] described himself as ''born again,'' notably in the first ''Playboy'' magazine interview of a U.S. Presidential candidate. Modern musicians Rev. [[Little Richard]] Penniman,&lt;ref name=&quot;whitep83&quot;&gt;White, Charles (2003), p. 83 (see text under photo on opposite page). ''The Life and Times of Little Richard: The Authorised Biography.'' Omnibus Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Farner]], [[Dan Peek]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Bob Dylan]],&lt;ref&gt;Cott (ed.), ''Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews'', 279–285&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kerry Livgren]], [[Dave Hope]], [[Dave Mustaine]], [[Nicko McBrain]], [[Roger McGuinn]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Brian Welch]], [[Keith Farley]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Randy Travis]], [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Lou Gramm]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbn.com/media/player/index.aspx?s=/vod/AL24v2_WS&lt;/ref&gt; were artists whose born again conversions had an impact on modern culture. Others such as [[James Cash Penney]], [[Chick-fil-A]] founder [[S. Truett Cathy|Truett Cathy]], wrestlers [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Sting (wrestler)| wrestler Sting]], [[Jesse McCartney]], [[Charlie Daniels]], [[Kirk Cameron]], and [[Mr. T]] are also mentioned as being born again. Former [[Alabama]] governor and U.S. presidential candidate [[George Wallace]] became born again in the late 1970s, which led him to apologize for his earlier [[segregationist]] views.

===Chuck Colson===
In his book ''Born Again'' (1976 and 2008), former [[Watergate Scandal|Watergate]] conspirator [[Charles Colson|Chuck Colson]] describes his path to faith in conjunction with his criminal imprisonment and played a significant role in solidifying &quot;born again&quot; identity as a cultural construct in the U.S.

He writes that his spiritual experience followed considerable struggle and hesitancy to have a &quot;personal encounter with God.&quot; While this is Colson's testimony of his own encounter with Jesus Christ, it is not to imply that any certain pattern or model must be followed by others seeking a &quot;born again&quot; salvation relationship with Jesus. There is no formula for what to say nor certain experience to be anticipated. It is one's own way of professing faith in [[Christ]] as &quot;savior&quot;, placing the whole of one's trust in Christ for eternal salvation.

{{quotation|...while I sat alone staring at the sea I love, words I had not been certain I could understand or say fell from my lips: &quot;'''Lord Jesus, I believe in You. I accept You. Please come into my life. I commit it to You.'''&quot;  With these few words...came a sureness of mind that matched the depth of feeling in my heart. There came something more: strength and serenity, a wonderful new assurance about life, a fresh perception of myself in the world around me.  In the process, I felt old fears, tensions and animosities training away.  I was coming alive to things I'd never seen before; as if God was filling the  barren void I'd known for so many months, filling it to its brim with a whole new kind of awareness....  I could not possibly in my wildest dreams have imagined what it would involve.  How fortunate it is that God does not allow us to see into the future.|Charles Colson&lt;ref&gt;Colson, Charles W. ''Born Again.'' Chosen Books (Baker Publishing), 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Born-again and politics==
The first born-again President of the USA was [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, JF., ''Changing party coalitions'', Algora Publishing, 2006, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;In the 1980 campaign, all three of the major candidates ... stated that they had been born-again&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Utter, GH. and Tru, JL.,''Conservative Christians and political participation: a reference handbook'', ABC-CLIO, 2004, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 [[Gallup poll]] reported that &quot;Forty-one percent of Americans say they are 'born-again'&quot;. &quot;The percentage of whites who are born-again and identify as [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s is 48%, compared with only 12% of born-again blacks. Almost two-thirds of born-again blacks are [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]s.&quot; Also, &quot;Whites who are born-again, and in particular white born-again Protestants, give [[George W. Bush|Bush]] much higher job approval ratings than do others.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gallup &amp; Gallup, ''The Gallup Poll:Public Opinion 2003, pp. 83-85.''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
===Biblical arguments===
The quotation from the Gospel of John has raised some questions about the meaning and authority of the phrase &quot;born again&quot;. In the chapter, [[Nicodemus]] is puzzled and asks Jesus what he means by saying that &quot;Ye must be born again&quot;. He questions: &quot;How can a man re-enter his mother's womb?&quot; [[Bart D. Ehrman]] says that this confusion is because, in Greek (the language of the gospel) the word ''again'' is ambiguous. It might mean ''again'' or ''a second time'' or ''from above'', which would explain Nicodemus' confusion. However, the Jews at Jesus' time were actually speaking Aramaic, in which language there would not have been a double meaning. Ehrman says that this raises questions about the authority of the dialogue, the meaning of the words, and, therefore, the use of the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart D.

A 19th century source notes that the phrase was not mentioned by the other Gospellers, nor by the Apostles except Peter. &quot;It was not regarded by any of the Evangelists but John of sufficient importance to record.&quot; And, without John, &quot;we should hardly have known that it was necessary for one to be born again.&quot; This suggests that &quot;the text and context was meant to apply to Nicodemus particularly, and not to the world.&quot; Otherwise, it would have been mentioned more often.

The '''Rockwell''' (now part of [[Boeing]]) '''B-1 Lancer'''&lt;ref group=N&gt;The name &quot;Lancer&quot; is only applied to the B-1B version, after the program was revived.&lt;/ref&gt; is a four-engine, [[variable-sweep wing]] [[strategic bomber]] used by the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF). First envisioned in the 1960s as a [[supersonic]] bomber with sufficient [[Range (aircraft)|range]] and payload to replace the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]], it developed primarily into a low-level penetrator with long range and supersonic speed capability.

Designed by [[Rockwell International]], the bomber's development was delayed multiple times over its history, as the theory of strategic balance changed from [[flexible response]] to [[mutually assured destruction]] and back again. The initial B-1A version was developed in the early 1970s, but its production was canceled and only four prototypes were built. In 1980, the B-1 resurfaced as the B-1B version with the focus on low-level penetration bombing. The B-1B entered service with the USAF in 1986.  It began service with the USAF [[Strategic Air Command]] as a nuclear bomber. 

In the 1990s, the B-1B was converted to conventional bombing use. It was first used in combat during [[Bombing of Iraq (December 1998)|Operation Desert Fox]] in 1998 and during the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO action in Kosovo]] the following year. The B-1B continues to support U.S. and [[NATO]] military forces in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. The Lancer is the supersonic component of the USAF's long-range bomber force, along with the subsonic B-52 and [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit]]. The bomber is commonly called the &quot;Bone&quot; (originally from &quot;B-One&quot;). With the retirement of the [[General Dynamics/Grumman EF-111A Raven]] in 1998 and the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]] in 2006, the B-1B is the U.S. military's only active variable-sweep wing aircraft. The B-1B is expected to continue to serve into the 2020s, when it is to supplemented by the [[Next Generation Bomber]].

==Development==
===Background===
In December 1957, the U.S. Air Force selected [[North American Aviation]]'s proposal to replace the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress with the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|B-70 Valkyrie]].&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p12-13&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|pp=12–13.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Valkyrie was a six-engine bomber that could reach [[Mach number|Mach 3]] speeds at high altitude ({{convert|70000|ft|m|abbr=out|sigfig=2|disp=/}})&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p15-7&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|pp=15–17.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid [[interceptor aircraft]], the only effective anti-bomber weapon in the 1950s.&lt;ref name = 'Schwartz p.118'/&gt; Soviet interceptors were unable to intercept the high-flying [[Lockheed U-2]];&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Ben and Leo Janos. ''Skunk Works''. Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Company, 1994. ISBN 0-316-74300-3.&lt;/ref&gt; the Valkyrie was to fly at similar altitudes and much higher speeds.&lt;ref name = 'Schwartz p.118'/&gt; By the late 1950s, however, anti-aircraft [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs) could threaten high-altitude aircraft,&lt;ref name=Jenkins_1999_p21&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|p=21.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as demonstrated by the [[1960 U-2 incident|1960 downing]] of [[Gary Powers]]'s U-2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keesings.com/search?kssp_selected_tab=article&amp;kssp_a_id=17425n01sov &quot;May 1960&amp;nbsp;– The U-2 Incident.&amp;nbsp;– Soviet and American Statements.&quot;] ''Keesing's Record of World Events'', Volume 6, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

The USAF Strategic Air Command (SAC) began moving its bombers to low-level penetration before the U-2 downing. This tactic greatly reduces radar detection distances by use of [[terrain mask#Terrain_masking|terrain masking]].&lt;ref name=Spick_1986_p6-8/&gt; At that time SAMs were ineffective against low-flying aircraft.&lt;ref name=Spick_1986_p6-8&gt;{{harvnb|Spick|1986|pp=6–8.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 'Schwartz p.119'/&gt; Also during this era, low flying aircraft were difficult to detect by higher flying interceptors since their radar systems could not readily pick out opposing aircraft against the radar clutter from ground reflections. Higher drag at low level operations limited the B-70 to subsonic speed while dramatically decreasing its range.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_1999_p21/&gt; The result would be an aircraft with similar speed but less range than the B-52 it was meant to replace. Unsuited for this new role and because of a growing [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM) force, the B-70 bomber program was canceled in 1961 by President [[John F. Kennedy]],&lt;ref name = 'Schwartz p.118'&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1998|p=118.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19950002358_1995102358.pdf &quot;NASA-CR-115702, B-70 Aircraft Study Final Report, Vol. I, p. I-38.&quot;] ''NASA'', 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; and the two XB-70 prototypes were used in a supersonic research program.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p14-6&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|pp=14–16.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although never intended for the low-level role, the B-52's flexibility allowed it to outlast its intended successor as the nature of the air war environment changed. The B-52's large airframe with internal room allowed the addition of improved [[electronic countermeasure]]s suites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|pp=279–280.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Vietnam War]] the concept that all future wars would be nuclear was turned on its head, and the &quot;big belly&quot; modifications increased the B-52's total bomb load to 60,000&amp;nbsp;pounds (27,215&amp;nbsp;kg),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|p=256.}}&lt;/ref&gt; turning it into a powerful tactical aircraft as well. In spite of its flexibility, the B-52 was far from perfect; higher speed would aid even a low-level approach in the strategic role, something the [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|F-111]] took advantage of.&lt;ref name = 'Schwartz p.119'/&gt;

===Design studies and delays===
The first post-B-70 study was known as the ''Subsonic Low Altitude Bomber'' (SLAB), which was completed in 1961. This was followed by the similar ''Extended Range Strike Aircraft'' (ERSA), which added a [[variable-sweep wing]] [[planform]], something in vogue in the aviation industry. ERSA envisioned a relatively small aircraft with a 10,000&amp;nbsp;pounds (4,500&amp;nbsp;kg) payload and a range of 8,750&amp;nbsp;nautical miles (16,200&amp;nbsp;km), with 2,500&amp;nbsp;nmi (4,600&amp;nbsp;km) being flown at low altitudes. In August 1963 the similar ''Low-Altitude Manned Penetrator'' (LAMP) design was completed, which called for an aircraft with a 20,000&amp;nbsp;lb (9,000&amp;nbsp;kg) bomb load and somewhat shorter range of 7,150&amp;nbsp;nmi (13,200&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pace|1998|pp=11–14.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 'Knaack pp.575-6'&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|pp=575–576.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These all culminated in the October 1963 ''Advanced Manned Precision Strike System'' (AMPSS), which led to industry studies at [[Boeing]], [[General Dynamics]], and [[North American Aviation|North American]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casil|2003|p=8.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 'Knaack p.576'&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|p=576.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1964, the USAF had revised its requirements and retitled the project as ''Advanced Manned Strategic Aircraft'' (AMSA), which differed from AMPSS primarily in that it also demanded a high-speed high-altitude capability, albeit slower than the Valkyrie at about Mach 2.&lt;ref name = 'Knaack p.575'&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|p=575.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the lengthy series of design studies, Rockwell engineers joked that the new name actually stood for &quot;America's Most Studied Aircraft&quot;.&lt;ref name=study&gt;Wykes, J. H. [http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&amp;gTable=mtgpaper&amp;gID=62575 &quot;The Evolution of a Strategic Bomber.&quot;] ''AIAA'', May 12–14, 1981. Retrieved: 8 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p23&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|p=23.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arguments that led to the cancellation of the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|B-70 program]] had led some to question the need for a new strategic bomber. The Air Force was adamant about retaining bombers as part of the [[nuclear triad]] concept that included bombers, ICBMs, and [[Submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs) in a combined package that complicated any potential defense. They argued that the bomber was needed to attack hardened military targets and to provide a safe [[counterforce]] option because the bombers could be quickly launched into safe loitering areas where they could not be attacked. However, the introduction of the SLBM mooted the mobility argument, and a newer generation of ICBMs had the accuracy and speed needed to attack any potential target. During this time, ICBMs were seen as a less costly option based on their lower unit cost,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pace|1998|p=10.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but development costs were much higher.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_1999_p21/&gt; [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] preferred ICBMs over bombers for the Air Force portion of the deterrent force&lt;ref name = 'Knaack pp.576-7'&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|pp=576–577.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and felt a new expensive bomber was not needed.&lt;ref name=fas&gt;[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/bomber/b-1a.htm &quot;B-1A page.&quot;] ''fas.org''. Retrieved: 20 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 'Knaack p.576-8'/&gt; McNamara limited the AMSA program to studies and component development beginning in 1964.&lt;ref name = 'Knaack p.576-8'&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|pp=576–578.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Program studies continued; [[IBM]] and [[Autonetics]] were awarded AMSA advanced avionics study contracts in 1968.&lt;ref name = 'Knaack p.576-8'/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p23-6/&gt; McNamara remained opposed to the program in favor of upgrading the existing [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] fleet and adding nearly 300 [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark#FB-111A/F-111G|FB-111]]s for shorter range roles then being filled by the [[Convair B-58 Hustler|B-58]].&lt;ref name = 'Schwartz p.119'&gt;Schwartz 1998, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 'Knaack p.576-8'/&gt; He again vetoed funding for AMSA aircraft development in 1968.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p23-6&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|pp=23–26.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Richard Nixon]] re-established the program after taking office, keeping with his administration's flexible response strategy that required a [[Single Integrated Operations Plan#Counterforce migrates_to deterrence and warfighting|broad range of options short of general nuclear war]].&lt;ref name = 'Knaack p.579'&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|p=579.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon's Secretary of Defense, [[Melvin Laird]], reviewed the programs and decided to lower the numbers of FB-111s, since they lacked the desired range, and recommended that the AMSA design studies be accelerated.&lt;ref name = 'Knaack p.579'/&gt; In April 1969 the program officially became the ''B-1A''.&lt;ref name = 'Schwartz p.119'/&gt;&lt;ref name = 'Knaack p.579'/&gt; This was the first entry in the [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system|new bomber designation series]], first created in 1962. The Air Force issued a request for proposals in November 1969.&lt;ref name=Pace_p22-3/&gt;

Proposals were submitted by Boeing, General Dynamics and North American Rockwell in January 1970.&lt;ref name=Pace_p22-3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kocivar, Ben.

Retrieved: 8 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth prototype, built to production standards, was ordered in the fiscal year 1976 budget. Two hundred forty B-1As were planned to be built, with initial operational capability set for 1979.&lt;ref name = 'Sorrels p.27'&gt;{{harvnb|Sorrels|1983|p=27.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockwell's design featured a number of features common to 1960s U.S. designs. These included the use of variable-sweep wings in order to provide both high lift during takeoff and landing, and low drag during a high-speed dash phase.&lt;ref name = 'lee p.13'/&gt; With the wings set to their widest position the aircraft had considerably better lift and power than the B-52, allowing it to operate from a much wider variety of bases. Penetration of the [[USSR]]'s defenses would take place at supersonic speed, crossing them as quickly as possible before entering into the less defended &quot;heartland&quot; where speeds could be reduced again.&lt;ref name = 'lee p.13'/&gt; The large size and fuel capacity of the design would allow this portion of the flight to be relatively long.

In order to achieve the required Mach 2 performance at high altitudes, the exhaust nozzles and air intake inlets were variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitford|1987|p=136.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, it had been expected that a Mach 1.2 performance could be achieved at low altitude, which required that titanium be used in critical areas in the fuselage and wing structure.

Given that its armament suite was similar to the B-52, the program was increasingly questioned and remained highly controversial.&lt;ref name = 'Knaack p.590'&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|p=590.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Senator [[William Proxmire]] continually derided it in public, arguing it was an outlandishly expensive dinosaur.

When Carter took office in 1977 he ordered a review of the entire program. By this point the projected cost of the program had risen to over $100 million per aircraft, although this was lifetime cost over 20 years. He was informed of the relatively new work on [[stealth aircraft]] that had started in 1975, and he decided that this was a far better avenue of approach than the B-1. [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] officials also stated that the [[AGM-86 ALCM|AGM-86]] Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) launched from the existing B-52 fleet would give the USAF equal capability of penetrating Soviet airspace. With a range of 1,500&amp;nbsp;miles (2,400&amp;nbsp;km), the ALCM could be launched well outside the range of any Soviet defenses and penetrate at low altitude just like a bomber, but in much greater numbers at a lower cost.&lt;ref name = 'Withington p.7'&gt;{{harvnb|Withington|2006|p=7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of B-52s could launch hundreds of ALCMs, saturating the defense. A program to improve the B-52 and develop and deploy the ALCM would cost perhaps 20% of the price to deploy the planned 244 B-1As.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

On 30 June 1977 Carter announced that the B-1A would be canceled in favor of ICBMs, SLBMs, and a fleet of modernized B-52s armed with ALCMs.&lt;ref name = 'Sorrels p.27'/&gt; Carter called it &quot;one of the most difficult decisions that I've made since I've been in office.&quot; No mention of the stealth work was made public with the program being [[top secret]], but today it is known that in early 1978 he authorized the ''Advanced Technology Bomber'' (ATB) project, which eventually led to the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pace p20-27&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pace|1999|pp=20–27.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestically, the reaction to the cancellation was split along partisan lines. The Department of Defense was surprised by the announcement, internal expectations were that the number of B-1s ordered would be cut down to around 150.&lt;ref name = 'Sorrels p.23'&gt;{{harvnb|Sorrels|1983|p=23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congressman [[Robert Dornan]] (R-CA) claimed, &quot;They're breaking out the vodka and caviar in Moscow.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Belcher, Jerry.

Soviet news agency, [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] commented that &quot;the implementation of these militaristic plans has seriously complicated efforts for the limitation of the strategic arms race.&quot;&lt;ref name=time/&gt; Western military leaders were generally happy with the decision. [[NATO]] commander [[Alexander Haig]] described the ALCM as an &quot;attractive alternative&quot; to the B-1. French General Georges Buis stated &quot;The B-1 is a formidable weapon, but not terribly useful. For the price of one bomber, you can have 200 cruise missiles.&quot;&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

Flight tests of the four B-1A prototypes for the B-1A program continued through April 1981. The program included 70 flights totaling 378 hours. A top speed of Mach 2.22 was reached by the second B-1A. Engine testing also continued during this time with the YF101 engines totaling almost 7,600 hours.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p46&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|p=46.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shifting priorities===
It was during this period that the Soviets started to exert themselves in several new theaters of action, in particular through [[Cuba]] during the [[Angolan Civil War]] starting in 1975 and the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in 1979. The U.S. strategy to this point was [[containment]] of [[Communism]] and war in Europe, which almost all military planning had been focused on. These newer actions revealed that the military was simply incapable of supporting any sort of effort outside these narrow confines.&lt;ref name=LRCA&gt;Liggett, Lieutenant Colonel William R.

During the 1980 presidential campaign, [[Ronald Reagan]] campaigned heavily on the platform that Carter was weak on defense, using the cancellation of the B-1 program as a prime example, a theme he continued using into the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, President Ronald.

===B-1B program===
[[File:First B-1, Palmdale.jpg|thumb|First B-1B debuted outside a hangar in [[Palmdale, California]], 1984 |alt= The first B-1B at its roll-out ceremony outside a hangar in [[Palmdale, California]] in 1984]]

On taking office, Reagan was faced with the same decision as Carter before: whether to continue with the B-1 for the short term, or to wait for the development of the ATB, a much more advanced aircraft. Air Force studies suggested that the existing B-52 fleet with ALCM would remain a credible threat until 1985, as it was predicted that 75% of the B-52 force would survive to attack its targets.&lt;ref name=post-b-52&gt;{{citation | last = Mitchell | first = Douglas D | url = http://digital.library.unt.edu/govdocs/crs/data/1982/upl-meta-crs-8615/IB81107_1982May03.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | title = IB81107, &quot;Bomber Options for Replacing B-52s.&quot; | publisher = Library of Congress Congressional Research Service, via Digital Library, UNT | date = 3 May 1982 | accessdate = 8 October 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After this, the introduction of the [[SA-10]] missile, the MiG-31 interceptor and the first Soviet [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AWACS]] systems would make the B-52 increasingly vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;Jumper, John P.

During 1981, budget funds were given to a new study for a bomber for the 1990s time-frame. These studies led to the ''Long-Range Combat Aircraft'' (LRCA) project which compared the B-1, F-111 and ATB as possible solutions. An emphasis was placed on the design being multi-role, as opposed to a purely strategic weapon.&lt;ref name=post-b-52/&gt; At the time it was believed the B-1 could be in operation before the ATB, covering the time period between the B-52's increasing vulnerability and the introduction of the ATB. Reagan decided the best solution was to purchase both the B-1 and ATB (later B-2), and this eventually led to Reagan's 2 October 1981 announcement that 100 aircraft of a new version of the B-1 was being ordered to fill the LRCA role.&lt;ref name = 'lee p.13'/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reagan approves&quot;&gt;Coates, James.

In January 1982 the U.S. Air Force awarded two contracts to Rockwell worth a combined $2.2 billion for the development and production of 100 new B-1 bombers.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p62&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|p=62.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous changes were made to the design to better fit it to real-world missions, resulting in the new ''B-1B''.&lt;ref name = 'Withington p.7'/&gt; These changes included a reduction in maximum speed,&lt;ref name = 'Schwartz p.120'/&gt; which allowed the variable-aspect [[Inlet cone|intake ramp]]s to be replaced by simpler fixed geometry intake ramps in the newer design. This reduced the B version's radar signature; the reduction in [[radar cross-section]] was seen as a good trade off for the speed decrease.&lt;ref name = 'lee p.13'&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2008|p=13.}}&lt;/ref&gt; High subsonic speeds at low altitude became a focus area for the revised design,&lt;ref name = 'Schwartz p.120'/&gt; and low-level speeds were increased from about Mach 0.85 to 0.92.

The B-1B's maximum takeoff weight was increased to 477,000&amp;nbsp;pounds (216,000&amp;nbsp;kg) from the B-1A's 395,000&amp;nbsp;pounds (179,000&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name = 'lee p.13'/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spick_1986_p28/&gt; The weight increase was to allow for takeoff with a full internal fuel load and for external weapons to be carried.

Opposition to the plan was widespread within Congress. Critics pointed out that many of the original problems remained in both areas of performance and expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casil|2003|p=7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular it seemed the B-52 fitted with electronics similar to the B-1B would be equally able to avoid interception, as the speed advantage of the B-1 was now minimal. It also appeared that the &quot;interim&quot; time frame served by the B-1B would be less than a decade, being rendered obsolete shortly after the introduction of a much more capable ATB design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1981/0921/092119.html  &quot;Former defense chief raps B-1 bomber plan.&quot;] ''Christian Science Monitor,'' 21 September 1981.

B-1As #2 and #4 were modified to include B-1B systems. The first one was completed and began B-1B flight testing in March 1983.

===Upgrades===
The B-1 has been upgraded since production, beginning with the &quot;Conventional Mission Upgrade Program&quot; (CMUP) This program added a new [[MIL-STD-1760]] smart-weapons interface to enable the use of precision-guided conventional weapons. CMUP began with Block A, which was the standard B-1B with the capability to deliver non-precision gravity bombs. Block B brought an improved Synthetic Aperture Radar, and some upgrades to the Defensive Countermeasures System and was fielded in 1995.

[[File:Nellis 08 B-1 01.jpg|thumb|left|B-1B nose view with small canards shown |alt= A front view of a B-1B's nose showing its small canards]]

The B-1 has a [[blended wing body]] configuration, with [[variable-sweep wing]], four [[turbofan|turbofan engines]], and triangular fin control surfaces. The wings can sweep from 15 degrees to 67.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). Forward-swept wing settings are used for [[takeoff]], [[landing]]s and high-altitude maximum [[cruise (flight)|cruise]]. Aft-swept wing settings are used in high subsonic and supersonic flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Withington|2006|p=16.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wings of the B-1B originally were cleared for use at settings of 15, 25, 55 and 67.5 degrees. The 45-degree setting was later cleared in 1998–99 timeframe. The B-1's variable-sweep wings and [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] provide it with better takeoff performance, allowing it to use more runways than previous bombers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|p=587.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The length of the aircraft presented a flexing problem due to air turbulence at low altitude. To alleviate this, Rockwell included small triangular fin control surfaces or canards near the nose on the B-1. The B-1's Structural Mode Control System rotates the canards automatically to counteract turbulence and smooth out the ride.&lt;ref&gt;Wykes, J. H. [http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&amp;gTable=mtgpaper&amp;gID=57365 &quot;AIAA-1972-772, B-1 Structural Mode Control System.&quot;] ''American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics'' (AIAA), 9 August 1972.

Unlike the B-1A, the B-1B made no attempt at Mach 2+ speeds. Its maximum speed is Mach 1.25 (about 950&amp;nbsp;mph or 1,530&amp;nbsp;km/h at altitude),&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p60&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|p=60.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its low-level speed increased to Mach 0.92 (700&amp;nbsp;mph, 1,130&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name=BNA_B-1B_specs&gt;{{harvnb|Pace|1998|p=64.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technically, the current version of the aircraft can exceed its speed restriction, but not without risking potential damage to its structure and air intakes. To help lower its radar cross section (RCS), the B-1B uses [[serpentine shape|serpentine]] air [[intake|intake ducts]] and fixed [[intake ramp]]s, which limit its speed compared to the B-1A. Vanes in the intake ducts serve to deflect and shield radar emissions from the highly reflective engine compressor blades.&lt;ref name=Spick_1986_p44-5&gt;{{harvnb|Spick|1986|pp=44–45.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also aiding the B-1's survivability is its relatively low [[radar cross section|radar cross-section]] (RCS).  Although not technically a [[stealth aircraft]] in a comprehensive sense, thanks to the aircraft's structure, serpentine intake paths and use of radar-absorbent material its RCS is about 1/50th that of the B-52 (probably about 26&amp;nbsp;ft² or 2.4&amp;nbsp;m²), although the Lancer is not substantially smaller in mass than the Stratofortress.&lt;ref name = 'Skaarup p.18'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Jim.

==Operational history==
===Strategic Air Command===
The second B-1B, &quot;The Star of Abilene&quot;, was the first B-1B delivered to the USAF [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) in June 1985.  Initial operational capability was reached on 1 October 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pace|1998|pp=62, 69.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly thereafterthe B-1B was placed on limited alert status. During 1987–88, the SAC completed the build up of the B-1B program.  Throughout these years and into 1989, SAC become familiar with the aircraft and how to maintain, employ and fly it. Soon it was declared Fully Operationally Capable (FOC) and was pulling full SIOP Nuclear Alert by 1990. It proved that it excelled in bombing accuracy by consistently having higher bomb scores than the B-52. From 1990 through 1992 the B-1B broke all SAC records for Operational Readiness Inspections (ORI). This culminated in 1992, SAC's last ORI season, when the 384th Bomb Wing at McConnell AFB, KS achieved the highest ORI score in SAC history.  The B-1B and its newer offensive avionics system excelled in bombing accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;SAC history, B-1B Aircrew&lt;/ref&gt;{{vs|date=April 2011}}  However, &quot;growing pains&quot; relevant to all new aircraft persisted through the SAC years. Hydraulic leaks, bird strike modifications, wing glove fires, emux sparkling, aft hatch problems all appeared.&lt;ref&gt;SAC aircraft loss history.&lt;/ref&gt;{{vs|date=April 2011}}

SAC had B-1 Lancers in service from 1986 through 1992, where they were placed on nuclear alert duty.  The B-1 received the official name &quot;Lancer&quot; on 15 March 1990. However, the bomber is more commonly called the &quot;Bone&quot;. The &quot;Bone&quot; nickname appears to stem from an early newspaper article about the aircraft wherein its name was phonetically spelled out as &quot;B-ONE&quot; with the hyphen inadvertently omitted.&lt;ref name= Jenkins_p67&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins 1999|p=67.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One version is that &quot;B One&quot; was spelled out on the flight plan (DD175) paperwork submitted by crews prior to flight.&lt;ref&gt;B-1B Aircrew&lt;/ref&gt;{{vs|date=April 2011}}  Designed for nuclear bombing, the B-1's development of conventional bombing capability was delayed.  By 1990, SAC started training the B-1B aircrews on conventional operations.&lt;ref&gt;B-1B unit flight scheduler notes&lt;/ref&gt;{{vs|date=April 2011}}

In late 1990 engine fires in two Lancers caused the grounding of the fleet. The cause was traced back to problems in the first-stage fan, the aircraft were placed on &quot;limited alert&quot;; in other words, they were grounded unless a nuclear war broke out.  Following inspections and repairs they were returned to duty beginning on 6 February 1991.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p116&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|p=116.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B-1 aircrew logbook entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally designed strictly for nuclear war, the B-1's development as an effective conventional bomber was delayed until the 1990s. By 1991, the B-1 had a fledgling conventional capability, forty of them able to drop the 500&amp;nbsp;lb (230&amp;nbsp;kg) Mk-82 General Purpose (GP) bomb, although mostly from low altitude. Despite being cleared for this role, the problems with the engines precluded their use in [[Operation Desert Storm]].&lt;ref name ='Withington p. 10'/&gt;  B-1s were primarily reserved for strategic nuclear strike missions at this time, providing the role of airborne nuclear deterrent against the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name = 'Withington p. 10'&gt;{{harvnb|Withington|2006|p=10.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The B-52 was more suited to the role of conventional warfare and it was used by coalition forces instead.&lt;ref name ='Withington p. 10'/&gt;

After the de-activation of Strategic Air Command (SAC) and the establishment of the [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC) in 1992, the B-1 developed conventional weapons capability. Part of this development was the start-up of the US Air Force Weapons School B-1 Division.&lt;ref&gt;Ed, Scott.

By the end of the 1990s, with the advent of the &quot;Block D&quot; upgrade, the B-1 boasted a full array of guided and unguided munitions. The B-1B no longer carries nuclear weapons;&lt;ref name = 'lee p.13'/&gt; its nuclear capability was disabled by 1995 with the removal of nuclear arming and fuzing hardware.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p141&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|p=141.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operationally, the B-1 was first used in combat in support of operations against [[Iraq]], during [[Operation Desert Fox]] in December 1998, employing unguided GP weapons.

;B-1A
The B-1A was the original B-1 design with variable engine intakes and Mach 2.2 top speed. Four prototypes were built; no production units were manufactured.&lt;ref name=Complete_Encyclopedia&gt;Donald, David, ed. &quot;Rockwell B-1B&quot;. ''The Complete Encyclopedia of World Aircraft''.

Existing external hardpoints would be modified to allow multiple conventional weapons to be carried, increasing overall loadout. For air-to-air defense, an [[Active Electronically Scanned Array]] (AESA) radar would be added and some existing hardpoints modified to carry air-to-air missiles. If needed the B-1R could escape from unfavorable air-to-air encounters with its Mach 2+ speed.

*In October 1990, while flying a training route in eastern Colorado, B-1B (s/n 86-0128) from the [[384th Bomb Wing]], 28th Bomb Squadron, [[McConnell AFB]], experienced an explosion as the engines reached full power without afterburners. Fire on the aircraft's left was spotted. The #1 engine was shut down and its [[fire extinguisher]] was activated. The accident investigation determined that the engine had suffered catastrophic failure, in which engine blades cut through the engine mounts, causing the engine to detach from the aircraft.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p114/&gt;

*In December 1990, B-1B (s/n 83-0071) from the [[96th Bomb Wing]], 337th Bomb Squadron, Dyess AFB, Texas, experienced a jolt that caused the #3 engine to shut down with its fire extinguisher activating. This event, coupled with the October 1990 engine incident, led to a 50+ day grounding of the B-1Bs not on [[Second strike#Implementation|nuclear alert]] status. The problem was eventually traced back to problems in the first-stage fan, and all B-1Bs were equipped with modified engines.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p114/&gt;

*On 15 September 2005, B-1B (s/n 85-0066) was extensively damaged by fire while landing at [[Andersen Air Force Base]], [[Guam]]. The investigation into the incident concluded that leaking hydraulic fluid and sparks from a wheel being gouged caused a fire to start in the aircraft's right main landing gear as it touched down. The resulting fire damaged the B-1's right wing, engine nacelle, airframe and landing gear, leading to an estimated repair cost of more than $32&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Stemple, Master Sgt. John.

*On 8 May 2006, B-1B (s/n 86-0132) from the [[7th Bomb Wing]], 9th Bomb Squadron, Dyess AFB, Texas, landed &quot;gear-up&quot; during recovery from an 11-hour ferry flight to the island of Diego Garcia. A resulting fire was quickly extinguished and the crew escaped through the top hatch with only a minor back injury to the co-pilot. The Air Force investigation concluded that the pilots disabled the aural tone generator circuit breaker which creates audible warning signals and then &quot;forgot to lower the [[landing gear]]&quot;. The B-1B impacted and slid on the runway, causing approximately $8 million of damage to the aircraft and runway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123027298 &quot;Report: pilot error caused B-1B crash.&quot;] ''Air Combat Command Public Affairs'', USAF, 18 September 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{For|the novel|A Book of Common Prayer}}
{{anglicanism}}

The '''Book of Common Prayer''' is the common title of a number of prayer books of the [[Church of England]] and of other [[Anglican]] churches, used throughout the [[Anglican Communion]]. The first book, published in 1549 {{Harv|Church of England|1957}}, in the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], was a product of the [[English Reformation]] following the break with [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]]. Prayer books, unlike books of prayers, contain the words of structured (or [[liturgical]]) services of worship. The work of 1549 was the first prayer book to contain the forms of service for daily and Sunday worship in English and to do so within a single volume; it included [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|morning prayer]], [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|evening prayer]], the [[Litany]], and [[Holy Communion]]. The book included the other occasional services in full: the orders for [[baptism]], [[confirmation]], [[marriage]], '[[Anointing of the Sick|prayers to be said with the sick]]' and a [[funeral]] service. It set out in full the [[Epistle]] and [[Gospel]] readings for the Sunday Communion Service. Set [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] readings for daily prayer were specified in tabular format as were the set [[Psalms]]; and [[canticles]], mostly biblical, that were provided to be sung between the readings {{Harv|Careless|2003| p=26}}.

The 1549 book was rapidly succeeded by a reformed revision in 1552 under the same editorial hand, that of [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. It never came into use because, on the death of Edward VI, his half-sister [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] restored Roman Catholic worship. On her death, a compromise version, largely 1552 with a few amendments from 1549, was published in 1559. Following the tumultuous events leading to and including the [[English Civil War]], another major revision was published in 1662 {{Harv|Church of England|1662}}. That edition has remained the official prayer book of the Church of England, although in the 21st century, an alternative book called ''[[Common Worship]]'' has largely displaced the ''Book of Common Prayer'' at the main Sunday worship service of most English parish churches.

The ''Book of Common Prayer'' appears in many variants in churches inside and outside the Anglican Communion in over 50 different countries and in over 150 different languages {{Harv|Careless|2003| p=23}}. Again in many parts of the world, more contemporary books have replaced it in regular weekly worship.

Traditional [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]] and [[Presbyterian]] prayer books have borrowed from the ''Book of Common Prayer'', and the marriage and burial rites have found their way into those of other denominations and into the English language. Like the [[Authorized King James Version|Authorized King James]] Bible and the works of [[Shakespeare]], many words and phrases from the ''Book of Common Prayer'' have entered common parlance.

==Full title==
The [[Long title|full name]] of the 1662 ''Book of Common Prayer'' is ''The Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church according to the use of the Church of England together with the Psalter or Psalms of David pointed as they are to be sung or said in churches and the form and manner of making, ordaining, and consecrating of bishops, priests, and deacons''.

== History ==

The forms of parish worship in the late medieval church in England, which followed the Latin [[Roman Rite]], varied according to local practice. These were termed local &quot;use&quot;.  By far the most common found in Southern England was the [[Use of Sarum]]. The rite was not consolidated into a single book. Instead, the forms of service that were to be included in the Book of Common Prayer were drawn from the [[Missal]] (for the Mass), [[Breviary]] for the daily office, Manual (for the occasional services; Baptism, Marriage, Burial etc.), and [[Pontifical]] (for the services appropriate to a [[bishop]]—Confirmation, Ordination) {{Harv|Harrison|Sansom|1982| p=29}}. The work of producing English-language books for use in the liturgy was largely that of [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] at first under the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], only more radically under his son [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. Cranmer was, in his early days, somewhat conservative, an admirer, if a critical one, of [[John Fisher]]. It may have been his visit to Germany in 1532 (where he secretly married) which began the change in his outlook.  Then in 1538, as Henry began diplomatic negotiations with Lutheran princes, Cranmer came face-to-face with a Lutheran embassy {{Harv|MacCulloch (a)|1996| p=215}}. The [[Exhortation and Litany (1544)|Exhortation and Litany]], the earliest English-language service book of the Church of England, was the first overt manifestation of his changing views. It was thus no mere translation from the Latin: its [[Protestant]] character is made clear by the drastic reduction of the place of saints, compressing what had been the major part into three petitions {{Harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=31}}. Published in 1544, it borrowed greatly from [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Litany]] and [[Myles Coverdale]]'s [[New Testament]] and was the only service that might be considered to be &quot;[[Protestant]]&quot; to be finished within the lifetime of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]].

=== Prayer Books of Edward VI ===
[[Image:Book of common prayer 1549.jpg|thumb|250px|Cranmer's Prayer book of 1549.]]
It was not until Henry's death in 1547 and the accession of Edward VI that revision could proceed faster. [[Cranmer]] finished his work on an English [[Eucharist|Communion]] rite in 1548, obeying an order of [[Convocation]] of the previous year that Communion was to be given to the people as both bread and wine. The ordinary Roman Rite of the Mass had made no provision for any congregation present to receive Communion. So, Cranmer composed in English an additional rite of congregational preparation and Communion (based on the form of the Sarum rite for Communion of the Sick), to be undertaken immediately following the Communion, in both kinds, of the priest.

Further developed, and fully translated into English, this Communion service was included, one year later, in 1549, in a full prayer book, set out with a daily office, readings for Sundays and Holy Days, the Communion Service, Public [[Baptism]], of [[Confirmation]], of [[Matrimony]], The Visitation of the Sick, At a Burial and the Ordinal (added in 1550) {{Harv|Gibson|910}}. The Preface to this edition, which contained Cranmer's explanation as to why a new prayer book was necessary, began: &quot;There was never any thing by the wit of man so well devised, or so sure established, which in continuance of time hath not been corrupted.&quot; Although the work is commonly attributed to Cranmer, its detailed origins are obscure {{Harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=45}} {{Harv|MacCulloch (a)|1996| p=414}}. A group of bishops and divines met first at Chertsey and then at Windsor in 1548, drawn from both conservatives and reformers, agreed only &quot;the service of the church ought to be in the mother tongue&quot;{{Harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=47}}. Cranmer collected the material from many sources; even the opening of Preface (above) was borrowed {{Harv|MacCulloch (a)|1996| p=225}}. He borrowed much from German sources, particularly from work commissioned by [[Hermann of Wied|Hermann von Wied]], Archbishop of Cologne; and also from [[Andreas Osiander|Osiander]] (to whom he was related by marriage) {{Harv|MacCulloch (a)|1996| p=414}}. The Church Order of Brandenberg and Nuremberg was partly the work of the latter. Many phrases are characteristic of the German reformer [[Martin Bucer]],  or of the Italian [[Pietro Martire Vermigli|Peter Martyr]], (who was staying with Cranmer at the time of the finalising of drafts), or of his chaplain, [[Thomas Becon]]. However, to Cranmer is 'credited the overall job of editorship and the overarching structure of the book' including the systematic amendment of his materials to remove any idea that human merit contributed to their salvation {{Harv|MacCulloch (a)|1996| p=417}}.

The Communion service of 1549 maintained the format of distinct rites of [[Consecration]] and [[Communion rite|Communion]], that had been introduced the previous year; but with the Latin rite of the Mass (chiefly following the familiar structure in the [[Use of Sarum]]), translated into English.  By outwardly maintaining familiar forms, Cranmer hoped to establish the practice of weekly congregational Communion, and included exhortations to encourage this; and instructions that Communion should never be received by the [[priest]] alone.  This represented a radical change from late medieval practice—whereby the primary focus of congregational worship was taken to be attendance at the consecration, and adoration of the elevated [[Mass (liturgy)|Consecrated Host]].  In late medieval England, congregations only regularly received Communion at [[Easter]]; and otherwise individual lay people might expect to receive Communion only when gravely ill, or in the form of a [[Nuptial Mass]] on being married.

Introduced on Whitsunday 1549, after considerable debate and revision in Parliament—but there is no evidence that it was ever submitted to either Convocation—it was said to have pleased neither reformers nor their opponents, indeed the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Bishop [[Stephen Gardiner|Gardiner]] could say of it was that it &quot;was patient of a catholic interpretation&quot;. It was widely unpopular in the parishes, especially in places such as Devon and Cornwall {{Harv|Duffy (b)|2003| p=131}}. Particularly unpopular was the banning of processions and the sending out of commissioners to enforce the new requirements. There was widespread opposition to the introduction of regular congregational Communion, partly because the extra costs of bread and wine that would fall on the parish; but mainly out of an intense resistance to undertaking in regular worship, a religious practice previously associated with marriage or illness.

[[Image:Book of common prayer 1552.jpg|thumb|left|Cranmer's Prayer book of 1552]]
The book was, from the outset, intended only as a temporary expedient, as Bucer was assured having met Cranmer for the first time in April 1549: 'concessions...made both as a respect for antiquity and to the infirmity of the present age' as he wrote {{Harv|MacCulloch (a)|1996| p=411}}. It kept the appearance of the Mass but abandoned its theology. A. H. Couratin in a set of unpublished Oxford University lectures from 1958 described it as a &quot;bogus Mass&quot;. Both Bucer and Peter Martyr wrote detailed proposals for modification; Bucer's ''Censura'' ran to 28 chapters which influenced Cranmer significantly though he did not follow them slavishly and the new book was duly produced in 1552, making &quot;fully perfect&quot; what was already implicit {{Harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=71}} {{Harv|McCulloch|1996| p=505}}. The policy of incremental reform was now unveiled: more Roman Catholic practices were now excised, as doctrines had in 1549 been subtly changed. Thus, in the [[Eucharist]], gone were the words [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and [[altar]]; the '[[Kyrie|Lord have mercy]]' was interleaved into a recitation of the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] was removed to the end of the service. The Eucharistic prayer was split in two so that Eucharistic bread and wine were shared immediately after the words of institution (This is my Body..This is my blood...in remembrance of me.); while its final element, the Prayer of Oblation, (with its reference to an offering of a 'Sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving'), was transferred, much changed, to a position after the priest and congregation had received Communion, and was made optional with an alternative prayer of thanksgiving provided. The Elevation of the Host had been forbidden in 1549; all manual acts were now omitted. The words at the administration of Communion which, in the prayer book of 1549  described the Eucharistic species as 'The body of our Lorde Jesus Christe...', 'The blood of our Lorde Jesus Christe...' were replaced with the words 'Take, eat, in remembrance that Christ died for thee..' etc. The Peace, at which in the early Church the congregation had exchanged a greeting, was removed altogether. Vestments such as the [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], [[chasuble]] and [[cope]] were no longer to be worn, but only a [[surplice]]. It was the final stage of the reformers' work of removing all elements of sacrificial offering from the Latin Mass; so that it should cease to be seen as a ritual at which the priest, on behalf of the faithful offered Christ's body and blood to God; and might rather be seen as a ritual whereby Christ shared his body and blood, according to a different sacramental theology, with the faithful.

Cranmer recognized that the 1549 rite of Communion had been capable of conservative misinterpretation and misuse, in that the consecration rite might still be undertaken even when no congregational Communion followed.  Consequently, in 1552 he thoroughly integrated Consecration and Communion into a single rite, with congregational preparation preceding the words of institution—such that it would not be possible to mimic the Mass with the priest communicating alone. He appears nevertheless, to have been resigned to being unable for the present to establish in parishes the weekly practice of receiving Communion; so he restructured the service so as to allow  ante-Communion as a distinct rite of worship—following the Communion rite through the readings and offertory, as far as the intercessory &quot;Prayer for the Church Militant&quot;.

Diarmaid MacCulloch suggests that Cranmer's own Eucharistic theology in these years approximated most closely to that of [[Heinrich Bullinger]]; but that he intended the Prayer Book to be acceptable to the widest range of Reformed Eucharistic belief, including the high sacramental theology of [[Bucer]] and [[John Calvin]] {{Harv|MacCulloch (a)|1996| p=615}}. At the same time, however, Cranmer intended that constituent parts of the rites gathered into the Prayer Book should still, so far as possible, be recognizably derived from traditional forms and elements.

In the Baptism service the signing with the cross was moved until after the baptism and the exorcism, the anointing, the putting on of the chrysom robe and the triple immersion were omitted. Most drastic of all was the removal of the Burial service from church: it was to take place at the graveside. In 1549, there had been provision for a Requiem (not so called) and prayers of commendation and committal, the first addressed to the deceased.  All that remained was a single reference to the deceased, giving thanks for their delivery from 'the myseryes of this sinneful world'. This new Order for the Burial of the Dead was a drastically stripped-down memorial service designed to undermine definitively the whole complex of traditional beliefs about Purgatory and intercessory prayer {{Harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=81}} {{Harv|Duffy (a)|1992| pp=472–5}}.

In other respects, however, both the Baptism and Burial services imply a theology of salvation that accords notably less with [[Reformed]] teachings than do the counterpart passages in the [[Articles of Religion]].  In the Burial service, the possibility that a deceased person who has died in the faith may nevertheless not be counted amongst God's [[predestination|elect]], is not entertained.  In the Baptism service the priest explicitly pronounces the baptised infant as being now [[baptismal regeneration|''regenerate'']]. In both cases, conformity with strict Reformed Protestant principles would have resulted in a conditional formulation.  The continued inconsistency between the Articles of Religion and the Prayer Book remained a point of contention for Puritans; and would in the 19th century come close to tearing the Church of England apart, through the course of the [[Gorham judgement]].

Cranmer's work of simplification and revision was also applied to the Daily Offices, which were to become [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning]], and [[Evening Prayer]]; and which he hoped would also serve as a daily form of prayer to be used by the Laity, thus replacing both the late medieval lay observation of the Latin [[Book of Hours|Hours of the Virgin]], and its English equivalent, the ''Primer''. This simplification was anticipated by the work of Cardinal [[Francis Quiñones]], a Spanish [[Franciscan]], in his abortive revision of the Roman Breviary published in 1537 {{Harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=27}}. Cranmer took up Quiñones's principle that everything should be sacrificed to secure continuity in singing the Psalter and reading the Bible. His first draft, produced during Henry's reign, retained the traditional seven distinct [[Canonical hours]] of Office prayer; but in his second draft, while he retained the Latin, he consolidated these into two {{Harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=34}}. The 1549 book then dispensed with the Latin, and with all non-biblical readings; and established a rigorously biblical cycle of readings for Morning and Evening Prayer (set according to the calendar year, rather than the ecclesiastical year) and a Psalter to be read consecutively throughout each month. He provided that the New Testament (other than the [[Book of Revelation]]) be read through three times in a year, while the [[Old Testament]], including the [[Biblical Apocrypha|Apocrypha]] would be read through once. Of the set canticles, only the [[Te Deum]] was retained of the non-biblical material.  In the 1552 Prayer book, this pattern was retained, (as it was in 1559, except that distinct Old and New Testament readings were now specified for Morning and Evening Prayer on Sundays). Following the publication of the 1552 Prayer Book, a revised English Primer was published in 1553; adapting the Offices and Morning and Evening Prayer, and other prayers, for lay domestic piety {{Harv|MacCulloch (a)|1996| p=510}}.

=== The English Prayer Book in the reign of Mary ===

Before the book was in general use, however, Edward VI died. In 1553, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], upon her succession to the throne, restored the old religion. The [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] was re-established, altars, roods and statues were re-instated; an attempt was made to restore the Church to its Roman affiliation. Cranmer was punished for his work in the [[English Reformation]] by being burned at the stake on 21 March 1556.  Nevertheless, the 1552 book was to survive. After Mary's death in 1558, it became the primary source for the Elizabethan Book of Common Prayer, with subtle if significant changes only.

Hundreds of Protestants fled into exile—establishing an English church in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. A bitter, and very public, dispute ensued between those, like [[Edmund Grindal]] and [[Richard Cox (bishop)|Richard Cox]], who wished to preserve in exile the exact form of worship of the 1552 Prayer Book; and those, like [[John Knox]] the pastor of the congregation, who regarded that book as still partially tainted with compromise. Eventually in 1555 the civil authorities expelled Knox and his supporters to [[Geneva]], where they adopted a new Prayer Book ''The Form of Prayers'', that derived chiefly from Calvin's French ''La Forme des Prières'' {{Harv|Maxwell|1965| p=5}}.  Consequently, when the accession of [[Elizabeth I]] re-asserted the dominance of Protestantism in England, there remained a significant body of Reformed believers who were nevertheless hostile to the Book of Common Prayer.  John Knox took ''The Form of Prayers'' with him to [[Scotland]], where it formed the basis of the Scots ''[[Book of Common Order]]''.

=== 1559 Prayer Book ===
[[File:Book of common prayer 1559.jpg|thumb|250px|Prayer book of 1559.]]
Thus, under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], a more permanent enforcement of the Reformed religion was undertaken, and the 1552 book was republished in 1559, scarcely altered {{Harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=94}}.

The alterations, though minor, were however to cast a long shadow. One related to what was worn. Instead of the banning of all vestments save the rochet (for bishops) and the [[surplice]] for parish clergy, it permitted 'such ornaments...as were in use...in the second year of K. Edward VI'. This allowed substantial leeway for more traditionalist clergy to retain at least some of the vestments which they felt were appropriate to liturgical celebration. It was to be the basis of claims in the 19th Century that vestments such as chasubles, albs, and stoles were legal. At the Communion, the words from the 1549 book 'the Body of our Lord Jesus Christ' etc. was combined with the words of Edward's second book, 'Take eat in remembrance.' etc. The instruction to the congregation to kneel at the Communion was retained; but the accompanying [[Black Rubric]] denying any &quot;real and essential presence&quot; of Christ's flesh and blood, was removed {{Harv|MacCulloch (a)|1996| p=527}}. The conservative nature of these changes underlines the fact that Protestantism was by no means universally popular – a fact that the queen herself recognized: her revived [[Act of Supremacy]], giving her the ambiguous title of [[Supreme Governor]] passed without difficulty, but the [[Act of Uniformity 1559]] giving statutory force to the Prayer Book, passed through Parliament by only three votes {{Harv|MacCulloch (a)|1996| p=101}}. It made constitutional history in being imposed by the laity alone, as all the bishops, except those imprisoned by the Queen and unable to attend, voted against it {{Harv|Guy|1988| p=262}}. Convocation had made its position clear by affirming the traditional doctrine of the Eucharist, the authority of the Pope, and the reservation by divine law to ecclesiastics 'of handling and defining concerning the things belonging to faith, sacraments, and discipline ecclesiastical' {{Harv|Clarke|1954| p=182}}.

After the several innovations and reversals, the new forms of worship took time to settle in. Among Cranmer's innovations, retained in the new book was the requirement of weekly communion. In practice, as before the Reformation, many received communion rarely, as little as once a year in some cases; [[George Herbert]] estimated it as no more than six times {{Harv|Marsh|1998| p=50}}. However practice was variable: very high attendance at festivals was in most places the order of the day  and in some places regular communion was very popular, in other places they stayed away or sent &quot;a servant to be the liturgical representative of their household.&quot; {{Harv|Maltby|1998| p=123}} {{Harv|Furlong|2000| p=43}}. Few parish clergy were initially licensed to preach by the bishops; in the absence of a licensed preacher, Sunday services were required to be accompanied by reading one of the [[Book of Homilies|homilies]] written by Cranmer {{Harv|Chapman|2006| p=29}}. George Herbert was however, not alone in his enthusiasm for preaching which he regarded as one of the prime functions of a parish priest {{Harv|Maltby|1998| p=67}}. Music was much simplified; and a radical distinction developed between, on the one hand, parish worship where only the [[metrical psalms]] of Sternhold and Hopkins might be sung; and on the other hand, worship in churches with organs and surviving choral foundations, where the music of [[John Marbeck]] and others was developed into a rich choral tradition {{Harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=125}} {{Harv|Marsh|1998| p=31}}. The whole act of parish worship might take well over two hours; and accordingly, churches were equipped with [[pew]]s in which households could sit together (whereas in the medieval church, men and women had worshipped separately). Diarmaid MacCulloch describes the new act of worship as, &quot;a morning marathon of prayer, scripture reading, and praise, consisting of mattins, litany, and ante-communion, preferably as the matrix for a sermon to proclaim the message of scripture anew week by week.&quot; {{Harv|Furlong|2000| p=43}}.

Many ordinary churchgoers—that is, those who could afford a copy, as it was expensive—would own a copy of the prayer book. Judith Maltby cites a story of parishioners at Flixton in Suffolk who brought their own prayer books to church in order to shame their Vicar into conforming with it: they eventually ousted him {{Harv|Maltby|1998| p=44}}. Between 1549 and 1642, roughly 290 editions of the prayer book were produced {{Harv|Maltby|1998| p=24}}. Before the end of the Civil War and the introduction of the 1662 prayer book, something like a half a million prayer books are estimated to have been in circulation {{Harv|Maltby|1998| p=24}}.

On the queen's death in 1603, this book, substantially the book of 1552, having been regarded as offensive by the likes of Bishop [[Stephen Gardiner]] in the sixteenth century as being a break with the tradition of the Western church, as it was, by the seventeenth century had come to be regarded by some as unduly Catholic. The objections of the English Puritans were; firstly, that it was improper for the lay congregation to take any vocal part in prayer (as in the Litany or Lord's Prayer), other than to say &quot;Amen&quot;; secondly, that no set prayer should exclude the option of an extempore alternative from the Minister; thirdly, that the Minister should have the option to omit part of the set liturgy at his discretion; fourthly, that short [[Collect]]s should be replaced by longer prayers and exhortations; and fifthly, that all surviving &quot;Catholic&quot; ceremonial should be removed {{Harv|Harrison|1982| p=53}}. On the accession of [[James I of England|James I]], following the so-called [[Millenary Petition]], the [[Hampton Court conference]] of 1604—the same meeting of bishops and Puritan divines that initiated the [[Authorized King James Version|Authorized version]] of the Bible—resisted the pressure for change (save to the catechism) {{Harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=138}}. With the defeat of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (1625–1649) in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] the Puritan pressure, exercised through a much-changed Parliament, had increased. Puritan-inspired petitions for the removal of the prayer book and episcopacy '[[Root and Branch|root and branch]]' resulted in local disquiet in many places and eventually the production of locally organized counter petitions. The Parliamentary government had its way but it became clear that the division was not between Catholics and Protestants, but between Puritans and those who valued the Elizabethan settlement. {{Harv|Maltby|1998| p=24}}. The 1559 book was finally outlawed by Parliament in 1645 to be replaced by the [[Directory of Public Worship]], which was more a set of instructions than a prayer book. How widely the Directory was used is not certain; there is some evidence of its having been purchased, in churchwardens' accounts, but not widely. The Prayer Book certainly was used clandestinely in some places, not least because the Directory made no provision at all for burial services. Following the execution of Charles I in 1649 and the establishment of the Commonwealth under Lord Protector [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]], it would not be reinstated until shortly after the restoration of the monarchy to England.

[[John Evelyn]] records in his ''[[John Evelyn's Diary|Diary]]'' taking Communion according to the 1559 Prayer Book rite:

''Christmas Day 1657. I went to London with my wife to celebrate Christmas Day. . . Sermon ended, as [the minister] was giving us the holy sacrament, the chapel was surrounded with soldiers, and all the communicants and assembly surprised and kept prisoners by them, some in the house, others carried away... These wretched miscreants held their muskets against us as we came up to receive the sacred elements, as if they would have shot us at the altar.''

=== Changes Made in Scotland ===
[[Image:Book of common prayer Scotland 1637.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Laud's abortive 1637 Prayer book.]]

In 1557, the Scots Protestant lords had adopted the English Prayer Book of 1552, for reformed worship in Scotland.  However, when [[John Knox]] returned to Scotland in 1559, he continued to use the ''Form of Prayer'' he had created for the English exiles in [[Geneva]], and in 1564, this supplanted the ''Book of Common Prayer'' under the title of the ''[[Book of Common Order]]''.

Following the accession of King [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]] to the throne of England, his son King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], with the assistance of Archbishop Laud sought to impose the prayer book on Scotland {{Harv|Perry|1922}}. The book concerned was not, however, the 1559 book but very much that of 1549,the first book of Edward VI. First used in 1637, it was never accepted, having been [[Jenny Geddes|violently rejected]] by the Scots. Following the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] (including the [[English Civil War]]), the [[Church of Scotland]] was re-established on a [[presbyterianism|presbyterian]] basis but by the Act of Comprehension 1690, the rump of [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalians]] were allowed to hold onto their [[benefice]]s. For liturgy they looked to Laud's book and in 1724 the first of the 'Wee Bookies' was published, containing, for the sake of economy, the central part of the Communion beginning with the Offertory {{Harv|Perry|1922|loc=Chapter 4}}.

Between then and 1764, when a more formal revised version was published, a number of things happened which were to separate the Scottish Episcopal liturgy more firmly from either the English books of 1549 or 1559. First, informal changes were made to the order of the various parts of the service and inserting words indicating a sacrificial intent to the Eucharist; secondly, as a result of Bishop Rattray's researches into the liturgies of St. James and St. Clement, published in 1744, the form of the invocation was changed. These changes were incorporated into the 1764 book which was to be the liturgy of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] (until 1911 when it was revised) but it was to influence the liturgy of the Episcopal Church in the United States.  A completely new revision was finished in 1929, and several alternative orders of the communion service and other services have been prepared since then.

=== 1662 Edition ===
[[Image:Book of common prayer 1662.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Title page of the Prayer book of 1662, printed by [[John Baskerville]] in 1762.]]
The 1662 prayer book was printed only two years after the restoration of the monarchy, following the [[Savoy Conference]] convened by Royal Warrant to review the book of 1559 {{Harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=169}}. Attempts by [[Presbyterians]] led by [[Richard Baxter]] to gain approval for an alternative service book failed. In reply to the [[Presbyterian Exceptions]], some 600 changes were made to the book of 1559, mostly minor; giving the Puritans little of what they wanted, but implementing rather more (though by no means all) of the changes suggested by High Anglicans  {{Harv|Edwards|1983| p=312}}.  Among them was the reference, in the prayer for the Church Militant, to those 'departed this life in thy faith and fear', contradicting the statement at the beginning of the prayer that it was for the church 'militant here in earth'. Secondly, an attempt was made to restore the [[Offertory]]. This was achieved by the insertion of the words 'and oblations' into the prayer for the Church and the revision of the rubric so as to require the monetary offerings to be brought to the Table (instead of being put in the poor box) and the bread and wine placed upon the Table. Previously it had not been clear when and how bread and wine got onto the altar. The so-called manual acts, whereby the priest took the bread and the cup during the prayer of consecration, which had been deleted in 1552, were restored; and an &quot;Amen&quot; was inserted after the words of institution and before the Communion, hence separating the elements of Consecration and Communion that Cranmer had tried to knit together. After the communion, the unused but consecrated bread and wine were to be reverently consumed in church rather than being taken away for the Priest's own use. By such subtle means were Cranmer's purposes further confused, leaving it for generations to argue over the precise theology of the rite. One change made that constituted a concession to the Presbyterian Exceptions, was the updating and re-insertion of the so-called [[Black Rubric]], which had been removed in 1559. This now declared that kneeling in order to receive the communion did not imply adoration of the species of the Eucharist nor 'to any Corporal Presence of Christ's natural Flesh and Blood'—which, said the rubric, were in heaven, not here.

Unable to accept the new book 1,760 ministers were deprived of their livings {{Harv|Procter|Frere|1965| p=201}}. In effect, the 1662 Prayer Book marked the end of a period of just over 100 years, when a common form of liturgy served for almost all Reformed public worship in England; and the start of the continuing division between [[Anglican]]s and [[Nonconformist]]s {{Harv|Edwards|1983| p=313}}.  The actual language of the 1662 revision was little changed from that of Cranmer. With two exceptions, some words and phrases which had become archaic were modernized; secondly, the readings for the [[Epistle]] and [[Gospel]] at the Holy Communion, which had been set out in full since 1549, were now set to the text of the 1611 [[Authorized King James Version|Authorized Version]] of the Bible. The [[Psalter]], which had not been printed out in the 1549, 1552 or 1559 Books—was in 1662 provided in [[Miles Coverdale]]'s translation from the [[Great Bible]] of 1538.

It was this edition which was to be the official ''Book of Common Prayer'', during the growth of the British Empire, and, as a result, has been a great influence on the prayer books of Anglican churches worldwide, [[liturgy|liturgies]] of other denominations in English, and of the [[English language]] as a whole.

=== Further attempts at revision ===
====1662 - 1832====
After the 1662 prayer book, development ceased in England until the twentieth century; that it did was, however, a bit of a close run thing. On the death of Charles II his brother, a Roman Catholic, became [[James II of England|James II]]. James wished to achieve toleration for those of his own Roman Catholic faith, whose practices were still banned. This, however, drew the Presbyterians closer to the Church of England in their common desire to resist 'popery'; talk of reconciliation and liturgical compromise was thus in the air. But with the flight of James in 1688 and the arrival of the Calvinist [[William III of England|William of Orange]] the position of the parties changed. The Presbyterians could achieve toleration of their practices without such a right being given to Roman Catholics and without, therefore, their having to submit to the Church of England, even with a liturgy more acceptable to them. They were now in a much stronger position to demand changes that were ever more radical. John Tillotson, Dean of Canterbury pressed the king to set up a Commission to produce such a revision {{Harv|Fawcett|1973| p=26}}. The so-called ''Liturgy of Comprehension'' of 1689, which was the result, conceded two thirds of the Presbyterian demands of 1661; but when it came to [[Convocation]] the members, now more fearful of William's perceived agenda, did not even discuss it and its contents were, for a long time, not even accessible {{Harv|Fawcett|1973| p=45}}. This work, however, did go on to influence the prayer books of many British colonies.

====1833 - 1906====
[[Image:Pusey.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Edward Bouverie Pusey]], a leader of the Oxford Movement]]
By the 19th century other pressures upon the book of 1662 had arisen. Adherents of the [[Oxford Movement]], begun in 1833, raised questions about the relationship of the Church of England to the apostolic church and thus about its forms of worship. Known as [[Tractarians]] after their production of ''[[Tracts for the Times]]'' on theological issues, they advanced the case for the Church of England being essentially a part of the 'Western Church', of which the Roman Catholic Church was the chief representative. The illegal use of elements of the Roman rite, the use of candles, vestments and incense, practices known as [[Ritualism]], had become widespread and led to the [[Public Worship Regulation Act 1874]] which established a new system of discipline, intending to bring the 'Romanisers' into conformity {{Harv|Carpenter|1933| p=234}}. The Act had no effect on illegal practices: five clergy were imprisoned for contempt of court and after the trial of the much loved Bishop [[Edward King (English bishop)|Edward King]] of Lincoln, it became clear that some revision of the liturgy had to be embarked upon {{Harv|Carpenter|1933| p=246}}.

One branch of the ritualistic movement argued that both 'Romanisers' (by imitating the Church of Rome) and their Evangelical opponents (by imitating Reformed churches) transgressed the Ornaments Rubric of 1559, 'that such Ornaments of the Church, and of the Ministers thereof, at all Times of their Ministration, shall be retained, and be in use, as were in this Church of England, by the Authority of Parliament, in the Second Year of the Reign of King Edward the Sixth'. These adherents of ritualism, among whom were [[Percy Dearmer]] and others, claimed that the Ornaments Rubric prescribed the ritual usages of the [[Sarum Rite]] with the exception of a few minor things already abolished by the early reformation. Following a Royal Commission report in 1906, work began on a new prayer book, work that was to take twenty years.

====1906 - 2000====
In 1927, this proposed prayer book was finished.  It was decided, during development, that the use of the services therein would be decided on by each given congregation, so as to avoid as much conflict as possible with traditionalists.  With these open guidelines the book was granted approval by the Church of England Convocations and Church Assembly in July 1927.  Since the Church of England is a state church, a further step, sending the proposed revision to Parliament, was required. A Resolution under the [[Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919]], directing that the Measure should be presented to His Majesty, was passed in the House of Lords by a large majority. However a similar resolution was defeated in the House of Commons on December 15, 1927 when the MPs [[William Joynson-Hicks, 1st Viscount Brentford|William Joynson-Hicks]] and Rosslyn Mitchell &quot;reached and inflamed all the latent Protestant prejudices in the House&quot;  and argued strongly against it on the grounds that the proposed book was &quot;papistical&quot; and was a restoration of the Roman Mass and implied the doctrine of Transubstantiation.

Early in the year 1928 a second Measure (known as the Prayer Book Measure 1928) was introduced in the Church Assembly, proposing to authorise the use of the Deposited Book with certain amendments thereto which were set out in a Schedule to Measure. This Measure again was approved by large majorities in both the Convocations and the Church Assembly; but a Resolution directing that it should be presented to His Majesty was defeated in the House of Commons on June 14, 1928.  In response to this rejection, the bishops issued a unanimous statement, asserting the Church's right to order its forms of worship, and in 1929 the Upper House of the [[Convocation of Canterbury]] resolved that bishops might approve the use of the 1928 book, notwithstanding the lack of parliamentary authority.  It became common for Prayer Books to print the 1662 and 1928 forms of service in parallel columns, although the legal basis of the revision remained unclear. The 1928 revised forms of Matrimony and Baptism were quite widely adopted, but those of other rites tended not to be; the consequence, in practice, being very wide variation in liturgical practice from parish to parish, with very few churchmen adhering consistently to the strict observation of either the 1662 or the 1928 forms of worship.

The effect of the failure of the 1928 book was salutary: no further attempts were made to change the book, other than those required for the changes to the monarchy. Instead a different process, that of producing an alternative book, led to the publication of Series 1, 2 and 3 in the 1960s, the 1980 [[Alternative Service Book]] and subsequently to the 2000 ''[[Common Worship]]'' series of books. Both differ substantially from the ''Book of Common Prayer,'' though the latter includes in the Order Two form of the Holy Communion a very slight revision of the prayer book service altering only one or two words and allowing the insertion of the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) before Communion. Order One follows the pattern of modern liturgical scholarship.

====2001 - ====
In 2003, a [[Roman Catholic]] adaptation of the BCP was published called the ''[[Book of Divine Worship]]''. It is a compromise of material drawn from the proposed 1928 book, the 1979 [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|ECUSA]] book, and the [[Roman Missal]]. Catholic converts from Anglicanism within the [[Anglican Use]] published it primarily for their use.

==Prayer Book in the Anglican Communion==
With British colonial expansion from the seventeenth century onwards, the Anglican Church was planted across the globe. These churches at first used and then revised the use of the Prayer Book, until they, like their parent, produced prayer books which took into account the developments in liturgical study and practice in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which come under the general heading of the [[Liturgical Movement]].

===Africa===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===Asia===
The '''[[Anglican Church of Korea]]''' has made a 1965 translation of the BCP in Korean and called it &quot;gong-do-gi-do-mun&quot; meaning common prayers. In 1994, the prayers announced &quot;allowed&quot; by the 1982 Bishops Council of the Anglican Church of Korea was published in a second version of the Book of Common Prayers In 2004, the National Anglican Council published the third and the current Book of Common Prayers known as &quot;seoung-gong-hwe gi-do-seo&quot; or the &quot;Anglican Prayers&quot;, including the Daily Masses, Special Masses, Baptism, Confirmation, Funeral Mass, Wedding Mass, Rite of Ordination Mass, and all of the other events the Anglican Church of Korea celebrates.
The Diction of the books have changed from the 1965 version to the 2004 version. For example, the word &quot;God&quot; which used to be &quot;Cheon-joo&quot; was altered to &quot;ha-nu-nim&quot; according to the Public Christian translation. The Bible that the Anglican Church of Korea uses is the 1994 edition called the &quot;gong-dong beon-yuk-seong-seo&quot; or the Common Translation Bible.

====India====
The '''[[Church of South India]]''' was the first modern Episcopal uniting church, consisting as it did, from its foundation in 1947, at the time of Indian independence, of Anglicans, Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians and Reformed Christians. Its liturgy, from the first, combined the free use of Cranmer's language with an adherence to the principles of congregational participation and the centrality of the Eucharist, much in line with the Liturgical Movement. Because it was a minority church of widely differing traditions in a non-Christian culture (except in [[Kerala]], where Christianity has a long history), practice varied wildly.

====The Philippines====

[[File:The Holy Mass taken from the BCP of the ECP.jpg|thumb|left|The Holy Mass, an excerpt from the Book of Common Prayer published by the Episcopal Church in the Philippines]]
As the Philippines is connected to the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]] through the [[Episcopal Church in the Philippines|Episcopal Church in the Philippines]], the main edition of the Book of Common Prayer throughout the Islands is the same as that of the United States. However, with the granting of the full autonomy on 1 May 1990, the [[Philippine Independent Church|Philippine Independent Church]], which is in full communion with the Anglican Communion, has published its own Book of Common Prayer. This is notable for the inclusion of the prayers for the [[Misa de Gallo]], a popular tradition among [[Filipino people|Filipinos]].

Aside from the ''American Book of Common Prayer'' and the newly published Philippine Book of Common Prayer, the Chinese community of Saint Stephen's Pro-Cathedral in the [[Episcopal Church in the Philippines#Dioceses|Diocese of the Central Philippines]] uses the English-Chinese ''Diglot Book of Common Prayers'', published by the Episcopal Church of Southeast Asia.

===Europe===
====Ireland====
William Bedell had undertaken an Irish translation of the Book of Common Prayer in 1606. An Irish translation of the revised prayer book of 1662 was effected by John Richardson (1664–1747) and published in 1712. It has been revised several times, and the present edition has been used since 2004.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}

====Wales====
An Act of Parliament passed in the year 1563, entitled “An Act for the Translating of the Bible and the Divine Service into the Welsh Tongue,” ordered that the Old and New Testament, together with the Book of Common Prayer, were to be translated into [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. A translation by [[Richard Davies (bishop)|Richard Davies]], bishop of [[St David's]] and the scholar [[William Salesbury]] was published in 1567 by [[Humphrey Toy]] as ''Y Llyfr Gweddi Gyffredin''. A new revision — probably by Bishop [[George Griffith (bishop)|George Griffith]] (1601–1666), of [[St Asaph]] - based on the revised English book of 1662, was published in 1664.&lt;ref name=&quot;justus.anglican.org&quot;&gt;http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/Muss-Arnolt/ch7&amp;8.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the creation of the [[Church in Wales]] 1920, the 1662 book (and its Welsh equivalent) was used until 1966, when trials of new services began. The current book was published in 1984, and is currently under revision.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

====Isle of Man====
The first [[Manx language|Manx]] translation of the Book of Common Prayer was made by Bishop John Phillips of [[Sodor and Man]] in 1610. A more successful &quot;New Version&quot; by Bishop Mark Hildesley (1698–1772) was in use until 1824 when English liturgy became universal on the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;justus.anglican.org&quot;/&gt;

====Cornwall====
The failure to translate the first Prayer Book into the [[Cornish language]] and the imposition of English liturgy over the Latin rite in the whole of Cornwall, led to the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] of 1549.&lt;ref&gt;Caraman, Philip (1994) ''The Western Rising 1549: the Prayer Book Rebellion''. Tiverton: Westcountry Books ISBN 189838603X&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceania===
====Australia====
The '''[[Anglican Church of Australia]]''', until 1981 officially known as the ''Church of England in Australia and Tasmania'', became self-governing in 1961. Among other things the General Synod agreed that the Book of Common Prayer was to 'be regarded as the authorised standard of worship and doctrine in this Church ...'. In 1978 ''An Australian Prayer Book''  was produced which sought to adhere to this principle, so that where the Liturgical Committee could not agree on a formulation, the words or expressions of the BCP were to be used {{Harv|The Church of England in Australia Trust Corporation|1978}}. The result was conservative revision.

In 1995 a similar process could be observed as elsewhere with the production of ''A Prayer Book for Australia'' which departed from both the structure and wording of the BCP.  The process was accompanied by numerous objections, notably from the deeply conservatively evangelical [[Sydney Anglicans|Diocese of Sydney]] which noted the loss of BCP wording and of an explicit 'biblical doctrine of substitutionary atonement'. The Diocese of Sydney has developed its own small prayer book, called [[Sunday Services]], to supplement the existing prayer book and preserve the original theology, which the Sydney diocese asserts has been changed.

===North and Central America===
====Canada====
The '''[[Anglican Church of Canada]]''' developed its first Book of Common Prayer separately from the English version in 1918, which received final authorization from General Synod in 1922. The revision of 1959 was much more substantial, bearing a family relationship to that of the abortive 1928 book in England. The language was conservatively modernized, and additional seasonal material was added. As in England, while many prayers were retained the structure of the Communion service was altered: a Prayer of Oblation was added to the Eucharistic prayer after the 'words of institution', thus reflecting the rejection of Cranmer's theology in liturgical developments across the Anglican Communion. More controversially, the Psalter included in the book omitted certain sections, including the entirety of Psalm 58.&lt;ref&gt;According to the [http://www.prayerbook.ca/bcp/psalmstables.html Tables of Proper Psalms], &quot;The following passages in the Psalter as hitherto used are omitted: Psalm 14. 5-7; 55. 16; 58 (all); 68. 21-23; 69. 23-29; 104. 35 (in part); 109. 5-19; 136. 27; 137. 7-9; 140. 9-10; 141. 7-8. The verses are renumbered.&quot; See also the [http://www.prayerbook.ca/bcp/psalter.html Psalter from 1962 Canadian Book of Common Prayer].&lt;/ref&gt; General Synod gave final authorization to the revision in 1962, to coincide with the 300th anniversary of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. A French translation, ''Le Recueil des Prières de la Communauté Chrétienne'', was published in 1967.

After a period of experimentation with the publication of various supplements, the ''[[Book of Alternative Services]]'' was published in 1985. This book (which owes much to Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, and other sources) has widely supplanted the 1959 book, though the latter remains authorized. As in other places, there has been a reaction and the Canadian version of the Book of Common Prayer has found supporters.

====Indigenous languages====
The Book of Common Prayer has also been translated into these North American indigenous languages: Cowitchan, Cree, Haida, Ntlakyapamuk, Slavey, Eskimo-Aleut, Dakota, Delaware, Mohawk, Ojibwe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wohlers | first = Charles | title = The Book of Common Prayer in other Languages | work = The Book of Common Prayer | accessdate = 2008-10-15 | date = 2008-09-23 | url = http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/languages.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ojibwa=====
[[Joseph Gilfillan]] was the chief editor of the 1911 [[Anishinaabe language|Ojibwa]] edition of the Book of Common Prayer entitled ''Iu Wejibuewisi Mamawi Anamiawini Mazinaigun'' (''Iw Wejibwewizi Maamawi-anami'aawini Mazina'igan'') {{Harv|Wohlers|2007 |loc=Chapter 68}}.

====United States of America====
[[Image:BCP1789.jpg|thumbnail|left|200px|The American Prayer book of 1789.]]
The [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] separated itself from the Church of England in 1789, having been established in the United States in 1607. Its prayer book, published in 1790, had as its sources, the 1662 English book and the 1764 Scottish Liturgy (see above) which [[Samuel Seabury (1729–1796)|Bishop Seabury]] of Connecticut had brought over following his consecration in Aberdeen in 1784, containing elements of each {{Harv|Perry|1922}}. The preface to the 1789 Book of Common Prayer says &quot;this Church is far from intending to depart from the Church of England in any essential point of doctrine, discipline, or worship...further than local circumstances require.&quot; There were some notable differences. For example, in the Communion service after the words of institution there follows a Prayer of Oblation from 1549, but into which were inserted the words 'which we now offer unto thee' (in small caps) with reference to the 'holy gifts' An [[epiclesis]] was included, as in the Scottish book, though modified to meet reformist objections. Overall the book was modelled in the English Prayer Book, the Convention having resisted attempts at deletion and revision {{Harv|McGarvey|Gibson|1907}}.

Further revisions occurred in 1892 and 1928, in which minor changes were made, removing, for instance, some of Cranmer's Exhortations and introducing such innovations as prayers for the dead.

In 1979, a more substantial revision was made. There were now two rites for the most common services, the first that kept most of the language of 1928, and the second using only contemporary language (some of it newly composed, and some adapted from the older language). Many changes were made in the rubrics and the shapes of the services, which were generally made for both the traditional and contemporary language versions. However, there was arguably a greater degree of continuity than was the case in England, which may account for the fact that all the books of the series, from 1790 to 1979 retain the same title. The 1979 book owes a good deal to the Liturgical Movement and to the 19th century Catholic revival.  Many [[Anglo-Catholics]] felt alienated by the contemporary language changes to the 1979 BCP and in 1991 The Church of the Good Shepherd in Rosemont, PA published a book entitled, the [[Anglican Service Book]] which is &quot;a traditional language adaptation of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer together with the Psalter or Psalms of David and Additional Devotions.&quot;  Books like this are allowed because of a rubric in the 1979 Prayer Book which allows for the translation of the contemporary language into the traditional language of the 1928 Book of Common Prayer.

Even so, the revision caused some controversy and in 2000, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church issued an apology to those &quot;offended or alienated during the time of liturgical transition to the 1979 Book of Common Prayer.&quot; Use of the 1928 Book of Common Prayer is currently discouraged.  Article X of the Canons of the Episcopal Church provides that &quot;[t]he Book of Common Prayer, as now established or hereafter amended by the authority of this Church, shall be in use in all the Dioceses of this Church,&quot; which, of course, is a reference to the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, but many parishes&lt;ref&gt;http://pbsusa.org/PBLinks.htm&lt;/ref&gt; still use it either regularly or occasionally, for pastoral sensitivity, for doctrinal reasons and for the beauty of its language.

The Prayer Book Cross was erected in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park in 1894 as a gift from the Church of England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightight.com/GGP/mem_images/Mem3P02.html Prayer Book Cross&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Created by [[Ernest Coxhead]], it stands on one of the higher points in Golden Gate Park. It is located between John F. Kennedy Drive and Park Presidio Drive, near Cross Over Drive. This {{convert|57|ft|m|abbr=on}} sandstone cross commemorates the first use of the Book of Common Prayer in California by Sir Francis Drake's chaplain on June 24, 1579.

== Religious influence ==
The ''Book of Common Prayer'' has had a great influence on a number of other denominations.  While theologically different, the language and flow of the service of many other churches owes a great debt to the prayer book. In particular, many Christian prayer books have drawn on the [[Collect]]s for the Sundays of the Churches Year—mostly translated by Cranmer from a wide range of Christian traditions, but including a number of original compositions—which are widely recognized as masterpieces of compressed liturgical construction.

[[John Wesley]], an Anglican priest whose revivalist preaching led to the creation of [[Methodism]] wrote, &quot;I believe there is no Liturgy in the world, either in ancient or modern language, which breathes more of a solid, scriptural, rational piety than the Common Prayer of the Church of England.&quot; Many Methodist churches in England and the United States continued to use a slightly revised version of the book for communion services well into the 20th century. In the [[United Methodist Church]], the liturgy for Eucharistic celebrations is almost identical to what is found in the Book of Common Prayer, as are some of the other liturgies and services.

A unique variant was developed in 1785 in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] when the historic [[King's Chapel]] (founded 1686) left the Episcopal Church and became an independent Unitarian church {{Harv|Kings Chapel|2007}}. To this day, King's Chapel uniquely uses ''The Book of Common Prayer According to the Use in King's Chapel'' in its worship {{Harv|Kings Chapel|2007}}.

In the 1960s, when [[Roman Catholicism]] adopted a [[vernacular]] [[Mass of Paul VI|revised mass]], many translations of the English prayers followed the form of Cranmer's translation.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Literary influence==
Together with the [[Authorized King James Version|Authorized version]] and the works of [[Shakespeare]], the Book of Common Prayer has been one of the three fundamental underpinnings of modern English.  As it has been in regular use for centuries, many phrases from its services have passed into the [[English language]], either as deliberate quotations or as unconscious borrowings. They are used in non-liturgical ways. For example, many authors have used quotes from the prayer book as titles for their books.

Some examples of well-known phrases from the Book of Common Prayer are:
*&quot;Speak now or forever hold your peace&quot; from the [[marriage]] liturgy.
*&quot;Till death us do part&quot;, from the marriage liturgy.
*&quot;Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust&quot; from the [[funeral]] service.
*&quot;From all the deceits of the world, the flesh, and the devil&quot; from the [[litany]].
*&quot;Read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest&quot; from the [[collect]] for the second Sunday of [[Advent]].
*&quot;Evil liver&quot; from the rubrics for Holy Communion.
*&quot;All sorts and conditions of men&quot; from the Order for Morning Prayer.
*&quot;Peace [[in our time]]&quot; from Morning Prayer, Versicles.

The phrase &quot;till death us do part&quot; (&quot;till death us depart&quot; before 1662&lt;ref&gt;James E. Clapp, [http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/?date=20001013 &quot;till death us do part,&quot;] The Mavens' Word of the Day (Oct. 13, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;) has been changed to &quot;till death do us part&quot; in some more recent prayer books, such as the 1962 Canadian Book of Common Prayer.

References and allusions to Prayer Book services in the works of Shakespeare were tracked down and identified by Richmond Noble {{Harv|Noble|1935| p = 82}}. Derision of the Prayer Book or its contents &quot;in any interludes, plays, songs, rhymes, or by other open words&quot; was a criminal offence under the 1559 [[Act of Uniformity 1559|Act of Uniformity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.shaw.ca/reformation/1559uniformity.htm Act of Uniformity, 1559&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently Shakespeare avoids too direct reference; but Noble particularly identifies the reading of the Psalter according to the [[Great Bible]] version specified in the Prayer Book, as the biblical book generating the largest number of Biblical references in Shakespeare's plays.  Noble found a total of 157 allusions to the Psalms in the plays of the [[First Folio]], relating to 62 separate Psalms—all, save one, of which he linked to the version in the Psalter, rather than those in the [[Geneva Bible]] or [[Bishops' Bible]].  In addition, there are a small number of direct allusions to liturgical texts in the Prayer Book; e.g. Henry VIII 3:2 where Wolsey states &quot;Vain Pomp and Glory of this World, I hate ye!&quot;, a clear reference to the rite of Public Baptism; where the Godparents are asked &quot;Doest thou forsake the vaine pompe and glory of the worlde..?&quot;

More recently, [[P.D. James]] used phrases from the ''Book of Common Prayer'' and made them into bestselling titles—''[[Devices and Desires]]'' and ''[[The Children of Men]],'' while [[Alfonso Cuarón]]'s 2006 film ''[[Children of Men]]'' placed the phrase onto cinema marquees worldwide.

==Copyright status==
In most of the world the Book of Common Prayer can be freely reproduced as it is long out of copyright. This is not the case in the [[United Kingdom]] itself.

In the United Kingdom, the British Crown holds the rights to the Book of Common Prayer. The rights fall outside the scope of copyright as defined in [[statute law]]. Instead, they fall under the purview of the [[royal prerogative]] and as such, they are perpetual in subsistence. Publishers are licensed to reproduce the Book of Common Prayer under [[letters patent]]. In [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] the letters patent are held by the [[Queen's Printer]], and in [[Scotland]] by the [[Scottish Bible Board]]. The office of Queen's Printer has been associated with the right to reproduce the Bible for many years, with the earliest known reference coming in 1577. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland the Queen's Printer is [[Cambridge University Press]]. CUP inherited the right of being Queen's Printer when they took over the firm of [[Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode]] in the late 20th century. Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode had been Queen's Printer since 1901. Other letters patent of similar antiquity grant Cambridge University Press and [[Oxford University Press]] the right to produce the Book of Common Prayer independently of the Queen's Printer.

The terms of the letters patent prohibit those other than the holders, or those authorized by the holders from printing, publishing or importing the Book of Common Prayer into the United Kingdom. The protection that the Book of Common Prayer, and the [[Authorized King James Version|Authorized version]], enjoy is the last remnant of the time when the Crown held a monopoly over all printing and publishing in the United Kingdom.

This protection should not be confused with [[Crown copyright]], or copyright in works of the United Kingdom's government; that is part of modern UK copyright law.  Like other copyrights, Crown copyright is time-limited and potentially enforceable worldwide.  The non-copyright Royal Prerogative is perpetual, but applies only to the UK; though many other Royal Prerogatives apply to the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, this one does not.

It is common misconception that the [[Controller of Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] holds letters patent for being Queen's Printer. The Controller of HMSO holds a separate set of letters patent, which cover the office Queen's Printer of Acts of Parliament. The [[Scotland Act 1998]] defines the position of Queen's Printer for Scotland as being held by the Queen's Printer of Acts of Parliament. The Controller of HMSO holds the position of Government Printer for Northern Ireland.

The [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]'s book is always released into the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchpublishing.org/general_convention/pdf_const_2006/Title_II_Worship.pdf Canon II.3.6(b)(2)]&lt;/ref&gt; Trial use and supplemental liturgies are however copyrighted by Church Publishing, the official publishing arm of the church.

[[File:A daisho set of bokuto.jpg|thumb|300 px|A daisho set of bokuto]]

A '''bokken''' ({{lang|ja|木剣}}, ''bok(u)'', &quot;wood&quot;, and ''ken'', &quot;sword&quot;) (or commonly as bokutō {{lang|ja|木刀}} in Japan), is a [[Japan]]ese [[waster|wooden sword]] used for training, usually the size and shape of a ''[[katana]]'', but sometimes shaped like other [[sword]]s, such as the [[wakizashi]] and [[tantō]]. Some ornamental bokken are decorated with mother-of-pearl work and elaborate carvings.

Bokutō should not be confused with [[shinai]], a sword made of bamboo that is used for practice in [[kendo]].

==Usage==
[[Image:Several bokken.jpg|thumb|130px|Various styles of bokken]]
The ''bokken'' is used as an inexpensive and relatively safe substitute for a real sword in several [[martial arts]] such as ''[[kendo]]'',  ''[[aikido]]'' and ''[[kenjutsu]]'', in that it is considerably cheaper, easy to replace, does not demand the care, attention and skill necessary to wield and maintain a live sword both safely for the user and other practitioners nearby – for example regular oiling, sharpening, the usage of specific parts of a blade, spatial awareness, etc...
While it has several advantages over use of a &quot;live&quot; edged weapon, it is still deadly if used incorrectly, and any training with a bokken/bokuto should be done with due care and attention under the supervision of a suitably accredited and experienced teacher. Swords may seem more dramatic in part to the lacerations and puncture wounds they are designed to inflict; injuries occurring from bokken are very similar to those caused by clubs and similar battering weapons; compound fractures, ruptured organs, and other such crush injuries - in some ways a bokken can be more deadly as the injuries caused are often unseen. It is not a sparring weapon, but intended to train in [[kata]] and acclimate the student to the feel of a real sword: for sparring, a bamboo [[shinai]] should be used instead for obvious safety reasons.

In 2003, the [[All Japan Kendo Federation]] (AJKF) introduced a type of practice using ''bokken''. ''Bokuto Ni Yoru Kendo Kihon-waza Keiko-ho'' is a set of basic exercises using a ''bokuto''. This form of practice is intended primarily for kendoka up to ni-dan (2), but is very useful for all kendo students.&lt;ref&gt;''Bokuto Ni Yoru Kendo Kihon-waza Keiko-ho'' 1 June 2003, All Japan Kendo Federation, Tokyo, Japan.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Suburito]]'' are ''bokken'' designed for use in ''[[suburi]]''. ''Suburi'', literally &quot;bare swinging,&quot; are solo cutting exercises. Suburito are thicker and heavier than normal ''bokken'' and users of suburito have to develop both strength and technique. Their weight makes them unsuitable for paired practice or ''kata''.

Bokken are currently issued to the Los Angeles Police Mounted Unit for use as batons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=Holly|title=Mounted Patrols Train for Handling Unrest at Convention|page=N3|accessdate=9 April 2011|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=August 6, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- April 8, 2011 - The August 6, 2000 Daily News cite is only for that the bokken were issued. It does not confirm that they are for use as batons. The Daily News article itself only has &quot;The officers are also trained to use a bokken, a long wooden sword used only by mounted police.&quot; The LAPD's Mounted Unit is currently overseen by Captain Incontro (see http://www.lapdonline.org/metropolitan_division). I contacted him via e-mail and asked if the Wikipedia article claim &quot;Bokken are currently issued to the Los Angeles Police Mounted Unit for use as batons&quot; was true. He replied back with &quot;We do use the bokken.&quot; --&gt;

==History==
{{unreferenced|section|date = August 2010}}

Historically, ''bokken'' are as old as [[Japanese sword]]s, and were used for the training of warriors. The bokken is a wooden training tool for those martial artists interested in learning the use of a sword. In [[Japan]], the sword and the art of its use goes back before the times of written history. There are legends that tell of the mythical period of the gods concerning their use of swords.
 
[[Miyamoto Musashi]], a [[kenjutsu]] master, was renowned for fighting fully armed foes with only one or two bokken. In a famous legend, he defeated [[Sasaki Kojiro]] with a bokken he had carved from an [[oar]] while traveling on a boat to the predetermined island for the duel.

==Types of bokken==
[[Image:Antique straight bokken.jpg|thumb|100px|An antique straight Japanese bokken, 48 inches long]]
The following list is the basic styles of bokken made:

# ''daitō'' or ''tachi'' ([[katana]]-sized), long sword;
# ''shoto'' or ''kodachi'' or ''wakizashi bo'', short sword, ([[wakizashi]]-sized);
# ''tantō bo'' ([[tantō]]-sized); and
# ''[[suburito]]'' can be made in daito and shoto sizes but are meant for solo training. They are much heavier and harder to use, developing greater muscles, increasing skills with 'normal' sized bokken. One famous user of the suburi-sized bokken is [[Miyamoto Musashi]] who used one in his duel against [[Sasaki Kojiro]].

Bokken can be made in any style of weapon required such as [[nagamaki]], [[Nodachi|no-dachi]], [[yari]], [[naginata]], [[kama (weapon)|kama]], etc. The examples above are the most widely-used.

The [[All Japan Kendo Federation]] specify the dimensions of ''bokken'' for use in ''kendo kata''.&lt;ref&gt;Japanese-English Dictionary of Kendo. 1 February 2000, All Japan Kendo Federation, Tokyo, Japan.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tachi: Total length, approx. 102&amp;nbsp;cm; ''tsuka'' (handle) approx. 24&amp;nbsp;cm.
*Kodachi: Total length, approx. 55&amp;nbsp;cm; ''tsuka'' (handle) approx. 14&amp;nbsp;cm.

Additionally, various [[koryu]] (traditional Japanese martial arts) have their own distinct styles of bokken which can vary slightly in length, tip shape, or in whether or not a tsuba (hilt guard) is added.

==Construction==
The quality of the ''bokken'' depends on several factors. The type and quality of the wood and  skill of the craftsman are all critical factors in the manufacture of a good quality bokken. Almost all mass produced bokken are made from porous, loose-grained southeast Asian wood.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} These bokken may be easily broken when used in even light to medium contact drills and are best left for non contact work, such as in [[kata]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Furthermore, the wood is often so porous, that if the [[varnish]] is stripped off the inexpensive bokken, one can see the use of wood fillers to fill the holes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} 

While most species of [[North America]]n [[List of Quercus species#Section Lobatae|red oak]] are unsuitable for construction of bokken, there are some [[Asia]]n species of red oak that have a significantly tighter [[grain]] and will be able to withstand repeated impacts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  

Superior woods, such as American [[white oak]], also known as ''[[Kashi (disambiguation)|Kashi]]'' (not to be confused with Japanese white oak, known as Shiro Kashi, which is an evergreen species and lacks the weaker spring growth rings of the American oaks), have been a proven staple, having a tighter grain than red oak wood. Another choice, [[hickory]] wood, seems to have a very good blend of hardness and impact resistance, while still having a relatively low cost. American made bokkens can also be had often handmade by practicing budoka (student of the bokka). A few of the hardwoods that are used in American bokkens are the walnut, hickory, persimmon, oak and ironwood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essortment.com/all/bokkenmaritala_rmtc.htm The Martial Arts: Bokken]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of exotic hardwoods is not unusual when constructing more expensive bokken. Bokken have been made from [[Brazil]]ian cherrywood ([[Jatoba]]), others from [[purpleheart]], and even from [[lignum vitae]]. Tropical woods are often quite heavy, a feature often desirable in a bokken despite the brittleness of these heavy and hard woods. Many exotic woods are suitable for suburi (solo practice), but not for paired practice where they would come into contact with other bokken.

Some online retailers offer ''bokken'' constructed from polypropylene plastics. The exact applications and benefits of such a weapon vary depending upon the user, as one such model has been demonstrated by its manufacturer to be capable of destroying concrete blocks and loading pallets.

==Bokken in fiction==
{{trivia|date=December 2009}}
''Bokken'' are used in various types of entertainment media including: *In ''manga'', Hiroyuki Takei's  ''[[Shaman King]]'', Ryu possesses a wooden sword and uses it as his main weapon, and for that reason he is also known as Bokuto no Ryu. *In anime ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'' is an example, [[Ikkaku Madarame]] carries a bokken when in his [[gigai]] form as he wasn't allowed to carry a real sword in public. *In television on the series ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', [[Ronon Dex]] and other Atlantis expedition members use bokken for practice and sparring. However, the form practiced is not Japanese. Instead, the style employed by Ronon Dex and others is somewhat free-form, possibly based on a martial arts form in the fictional [[Pegasus galaxy]]. The bokken is more often held with one hand rather than two.  *In books as in ''[[Young Samurai: Way of the Warrior]]'', the bokken is introduced to one of the main characters, Jack, by Yamato as a training sword. It is also featured in the second book, ''[[Young Samurai: The Way of the Sword]]'', where it is used by all of the students at the Niten Ichi Ryū. *In films like ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' the protagonist and several others are seen training with bokken.

'''The Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited''', '''BSA''' was a major industrial combine, a group of businesses manufacturing military and sporting firearms; bicycles; motorcycles; cars; buses and bodies; steel; iron castings; [[hand tool|hand]], [[power tool|power]], and [[machine tool|machine]] tools; coal cleaning and handling plants; sintered metals; and hard chrome process.

At its peak, BSA was the largest motorcycle producer in the world. Loss of sales and poor investments in new products in the motorcycle division, which included [[Triumph Engineering Co Ltd|Triumph Motorcycles]], led to problems for the whole group.

A government organized rescue operation in 1973 led to the takeover of remaining operations by what is now [[Manganese Bronze Holdings]], then owners of [[Norton-Villiers]], and over the following decade further closures and dispersals. The original company, The Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited, remains a subsidiary of Manganese Bronze but its name was changed in 1987.

Manganese Bronze continues to operate former BSA subsidiary [[Carbodies]], now known as LTI Limited, manufacturers of London Taxicabs and the largest wholly British owned car manufacturer.

=History of the BSA industrial group=
BSA began in June 1861 in the [[Gun Quarter, Birmingham]] England founded, specifically to manufacture guns by machinery, by fourteen gunsmiths of the [[Birmingham]] Small Arms Trade Association.  The balance had moved against the Birmingham gunsmiths following the outbreak of the [[Crimean War]] in 1854.  The [[Board of Ordnance]]'s [[Royal Small Arms Factory]] at Enfield had introduced machinery made in the USA. Their greatly increased output had been achieved with reduced reliance on skilled craftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;'' Taylerson, A. W. F., pages 469–472 '' in Blair Claude (editor), 1983, '' Pollard's History of Firearms '' Feltham, ISBN : 0-600-331547&lt;/ref&gt; The War Office provided free access to technical drawings and their facilities at their Enfield factory.

The newly-formed company purchased 25 acres of land at Small Heath Birmingham, built a factory there and made a road on the site calling it Armoury Road.
==Firearms==
BSA's resort to the use of machinery was rewarded in 1863 with an order for 20,000 Turkish infantry rifles. The management of the BSA Company was changed at an Extraordinary Meeting called on September 30, 1863 when the Company was changed from being run by a committee to that of an elected Board of Directors, Joseph Wilson, Samuel Buckley, Isaac Hollis, Charles Playfair, Charles Pryse, Sir John Ratcliffe, Edward Gem, and J.F. Swinburn under the chairmanship of John Dent Goodman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryerson Barry 1980&quot;&gt;Ryerson Barry, 1980, '' The Giants of Small Heath - The History of BSA '' Sparkford, ISBN : 0-85429-255-1&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first War Office contract was not agreed until 1868. In 1879 the factory, without work, was shut for a year. The military arms trade was precarious.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport-Hines R.P.T., 2002, '' Dudley Docker - The Life and Times of a Trade Warrior '', Page 48, Cambridge University Press, ISBN : 0-521-89400-X&lt;/ref&gt; 
==New ventures==
===Bicycles===
The next year BSA branched out into bicycle manufacture. &lt;ref&gt;Davenport-Hines R.P.T., 2002 '' Dudley Docker – The Life and Times of a Trade Warrior '', Page 48, Cambridge University Press, ISBN : 0-521-89400-X&lt;/ref&gt; in 1880 they manufactured the [http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/TRANSPORT/diwheel/diwheel.htm Otto Dicycle], in the 1880s the company began to manufacture [[Safety bicycle]]s on their own account and not until 1905 was the company's first experimental [[motorcycle]] constructed. Bicycle production ceased in 1887 as the company concentrated on producing the [[Lee-Metford]] magazine loading rifle for the War Office which was re-equipping the British Army with it.  The order was for 1,200 rifles per week.
===Bicycle components===
In 1893 BSA commenced making bicycle hubs and continued to supply the bicycle trade with parts up to 1936.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryerson Barry 1980&quot;/&gt;
===Ammunition===
BSA sold its ammunition business in 1897 to Birmingham Metal and Munitions Company Limited part of the Nobel-Dynamite Trust, through [[Kynoch]] a forerunner of [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryerson Barry, 1980, ''The Giants of Small Heath - The History of BSA'', page 16, Sparkford, ISBN : 0-85429-255-1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sparkbrook=== 
In 1906 Frank [[Dudley Docker]] was appointed a director of the Company. By the autumn of that year BSA were in some difficulty. They had purchased the Sparkbrook Royal Small Arms Factory from the War Office, and in return, the War Office undertook to give BSA a quarter of all orders for Lee-Enfield rifles, but the War Office did not honour their undertaking.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport-Hines R.P.T., 2002 '' Dudley Docker - The Life and Times of a Trade Warrior '', page 49, Cambridge University Press, ISBN : 0-521-89400-X&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ensuing financial crisis did not prevent BSA from signing an agreement to amalgamate with another bicycle component manufacturer,  the Eadie Manufacturing Company of [[Redditch]], on 11 February 1907. That decision was ratified by the shareholders of both companies at separate Extraordinary General Meetings held in the Grand Hotel, Birmingham on 27 February 1907. Albert Eadie became a BSA director, a post he held until his death in 1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryerson Barry 1980&quot;/&gt; 
===Motorcycles===
Motor bicycles were added to bicycle products in 1909.
===Motor cars===
====BSA cars====
In an effort to make use of the Sparkbrook factory BSA established a motor-car department there. An independent part of it was occupied by [[Lanchester Motor Company]]. The first prototype automobile was produced in 1907. The following year, marketed under BSA Cycles Ltd, the company sold 150 automobiles and again began producing complete bicycles on its own account. By 1909 it was clear the new motorcar department was unsuccessful, an investigation committee reported to the BSA Board on the many failures of its management and their poor organization of production.

====Daimler vehicles====
Dudley Docker had joined the board in 1906 and was appointed deputy chairman of BSA in 1909. He had made a spectacular financial success of a merger of five large rolling-stock companies in 1902 and become the leader of the period's merger movement. Believing he could buy the missing management skills that could not be found within BSA he started merger talks with [[Daimler Motor Company|The Daimler Motor Company Limited]] of Coventry. Daimler and Rover were then the largest British car producers. Daimler was immensely profitable. After its capital reconstruction in 1904 Daimler's profits were 57% and 150% returns on invested capital in 1905 and 1906. The attraction for Daimler shareholders was the apparent stability of BSA.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport-Hines R.P.T., 2002, '' Dudley Docker – The Life and Times of Trade Warrior '', pages 49–50, Cambridge University Press, ISBN : 0-521-89400-X&lt;/ref&gt;

So in 1910 BSA purchased Daimler with BSA shares but Docker who negotiated the arrangements either ignored or failed in his assessment of their consequences for the new combine. The combine was never adequately balanced or co-ordinated. One of the financial provisions obliged Daimler to pay BSA an annual dividend of £100,000 representing approximately 40% of the actual cash BSA had put into Daimler. This financial burden deprived Daimler of badly need cash to fund development, forcing the Daimler company to borrow money from the [[Midland Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Davenport-Hines R.P.T., 2002, '' Dudley Docker – The Life and Times of a Trade Warrior '', page 51, Cambridge University Press, ISBN : 0-521-89400-X&lt;/ref&gt;

BSA had still not recovered financially from the earlier purchase of Royal Small Arms factory at Sparkbrook  and BSA were not in a position to finance Daimler, nor had either company ample liquid resources. BSA went ahead with motorcycle production in 1910, their first model available for the 1911 season. In 1913 the BSA group were compelled through pressure from the Midland Bank to make a capital issue of 300,000 preference shares. In the short term this was to solve the liquidity issue but further diluted the groups capitalisation.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport-Hines R.P.T., 2002 '' Dudley Docker – The Life and Times of a Trade Warrior '', pages 50–52, Cambridge University Press, ISBN : 0-521-89400-X&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dudley Docker retired as a BSA director in 1912 and installed Lincoln Chandler on the BSA board as his replacement. Dudley Docker liked to draw a comparison between the BSA~Daimler merger he engineered and that of his 1902 merger of [[Metro Cammell|Metropolitan Carriage Wagon &amp; Finance Company]] and [[Patent Shaft]]. However there was not the integration of facilities in the BSA~Daimler case, nor was there a reorganisation of either BSA or Daimler and in view of the earlier criticism contained in the 1909 report of the investigation committee, BSA continued to produce cars of their own using Daimler engines. In 1913 Daimler employed 5,000 workers to manufacture 1,000 vehicles an indication that things were not well.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport-Hines R.P.T., 2002 '' Dudley Docker – The Life and Times of a Trade Warrior '', page 52, Cambridge University Press, ISBN : 0-521-89400-X&lt;/ref&gt;
====Steel bodies====
In 1912, BSA would be one of two automobile manufacturers pioneering the use of all-steel bodies, joining [[Hupmobile]] in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Csere1988p63&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Csere | first = Csaba | authorlink = Csaba Csere | year = 1988 | month = January | title = 10 Best Engineering Breakthroughs | work = Car and Driver | volume = 33 | issue = 7 }}, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War==
During the First World War, the company returned to arms manufacture and greatly expanded its operations. BSA produced [[rifle]]s, [[Lewis gun]]s, [[shell (projectile)|shells]], motorcycles and other vehicles for the war effort.

==Inter-war years==
[[Image:1935-BSA-Motorbikes-.jpg|right|frame|1935 magazine advert for the BSA range of motorcycles and 3-wheeler cars]]
===Motorcycles===
In November 1919 BSA launched their first 50 degree [[V-twin engine|vee-twin]], [[BSA Model E|Model E]], 770cc side valve (6-7&amp;nbsp;hp) motorcycle for the 1920 season.&lt;ref&gt;BSA Cycles Ltd 1920 ''Advertisement Suggestions for BSA Bicycles and Motor Bicycles'', The Birmingham Small Arms Company, no ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; The machine had interchangeable valves, total loss oil system with mechanical pump and an emergency hand one. Retail price was £130. Other features were [[Amal (motorcycle)|Amac]] carburettor, chain drive, choice of [[magneto]] or Magdyno, 7-plate clutch, 3 speed gear box with [[Kick start|kickstarter]] and new type of cantilever fork &lt;ref&gt;Ryerson, Barry 1980 ''The Giants of Small Heath - The History of BSA'', Sparkford, ISBN 0-85429-255-1&lt;/ref&gt;
===Aviation===
During the war Daimler had built enormous numbers of aero engines and aircraft and by the end was building 80 Airco de Havilland bombers a month. In February 1920 BSA amalgamated&lt;ref&gt;Air Transport Combine. Aircraft And B.S.A. Firms Unite ''The Times'', Monday, Mar 01, 1920; pg. 14; Issue 42347&lt;/ref&gt; with what was the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, [[Airco|Aircraft Manufacturing Company (Airco)]], Airco's main plant at Hendon had employed between 7,000 and 8,000 people.&lt;ref name=ObitTT&gt;Mr. G. Holt Thomas. ''The Times'', Friday, Jan 04, 1929; pg. 14; Issue 45092&lt;/ref&gt; The Airco group of companies had turned out a new aircraft every 45 minutes.&lt;ref name=ObitDawes&gt;Mr. G. Holt Thomas. Colonel G. W. Dawes. ''The Times'', Saturday, Jan 05, 1929; pg. 14; Issue 45093&lt;/ref&gt; 

Within days BSA discovered Airco was in a far more serious financial state than  [[George Holt Thomas]] had revealed. Holt Thomas was immediately dropped from his new seat on the BSA board and all BSA's new acquisitions were placed in the hands of a liquidator. Some of the businesses were allowed to continue for some years, [[Aircraft Transport and Travel]]'s assets being eventually rolled into Daimler Air Hire to make [[Daimler Airway|Daimler Airway Limited]]. BSA failed to pay a dividend for the following four years while it tried to recover from its losses.&lt;ref&gt;''Dudley Docker: The Life and Times of a Trade Warrior'' R. P. T. Davenport-Hines 1984 Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Daimler Airway and its management became the major constituent of [[Imperial Airways]].

As well as the Daimler car range, BSA Cycles Ltd re-entered the car market under the BSA name in 1921 with a V-twin engined light car followed by four-cylinder models up to 1926, when the name was temporarily dropped. In 1929 a new range of 3 and 4 wheel cars appeared and production of these continued until 1936.

By 1930 the BSA Group's primary activities were BSA motorcycles and Daimler vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;The Birmingham Small Arms Company ''The Times'', Saturday, 1 November 1930; pg. 20; Issue 45659&lt;/ref&gt;

Car production under the BSA name ceased in the 1930s.

===Lanchester===
In 1931 the [[Lanchester Motor Company]] at Sparkbrook was acquired&lt;ref&gt;The Lanchester Company FROM OUR MOTORING CORRESPONDENT ''The Times'', Tuesday, Jan 06, 1931; pg. 10; Issue 45713&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Birmingham Small Arms Company A Difficult Trading Year, Important Transactions Effected ''The Times,'' Saturday, Nov 28, 1931; pg. 17; Issue 45992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BSALanchester group=note&gt;from Hamilton Barnsley, the principal shareholder, chairman and managing director. Negotiated shortly before his death during Christmas time 1930. The Lanchester Motor Company held adjoining factory premises at Sparkbrook. The purchase of the whole of the shares was completed in January 1931 for £26,000.&lt;/ref&gt; and production of their cars transferred to Daimler's Coventry works.
===Armaments===
In the 1930s, the board of directors authorised expenditure on bringing their arms-making equipment back to use - it had been stored at company expense since the end of the Great War in the belief that BSA might again be called upon to perform its patriotic duty.
==Second World War==
By the outbreak of the Second World War, BSA Guns Ltd at Small Heath, was the only factory producing rifles in the UK. The [[Royal Ordnance Factory|Royal Ordnance Factories]] would not begin production until 1941. BSA Guns Ltd was also producing [[M1919 Browning machine gun|.303 Browning machine gun]]s for the [[Air Ministry]] at the rate of 600 guns per week in March 1939 and Browning production was to peak at 16,390 per month by March 1942. The armed forces had chosen the 500 cc side-valve [[BSA M20]] motorcycle as their preferred machine. On the outbreak of war the Government requisitioned the 690 machines BSA had in stock as well as placing an order for another 8,000 machines. South Africa, Eire, India, Sweden and Holland also wanted machines.  

The Government had passed the [[Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939]] on 24 August allowing the drafting of defence regulations affecting food, travel, requisitioning of land and supplies, manpower and agricultural production. A second Emergency Powers (Defence) Act was passed on 22 May 1940 allowing the conscription of labour. The fall of France had not been anticipated in Government planning and the encirclement of a large part of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] into the Dunkirk pocket resulted in a hasty [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuation]] of that part of the B.E.F following the abandonment of their equipment. The parlous state of affairs &quot;no arms, no transport, no equipment&quot; in the face of the threat of imminent invasion of Britain by  [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] forces was recorded by the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] Field Marshall Sir [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke]] in his diary entries of the 1/2 July 1940.&lt;ref&gt;''War Diaries 1939 -1945'' Field Marshall Lord Alanbrooke, London 2001, ISBN 0-297-607316&lt;/ref&gt; 

The creation of the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] (initially as the Local Defence Volunteers) following [[Anthony Eden]]'s broadcast appeal to the Nation on Tuesday 14 May 1940 also created further demand for arms production to equip this new force. BSA, as the only rifle producer in Britain, had to step up to the mark and the workforce voluntarily went onto a 7 day week.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''BSA Centenary 1861 - 1961, BSA Group News, No.17 June 1961'', The Birmingham Small Arms Company, no ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; Motorcycle production was also stepped up from 500 to 1,000 machines per week which meant a finished machine coming off the production line every 5 minutes. The motorcycle department had been left intact in 1939 due to demand which was doubled following Dunkirk. At the same time BSA staff were providing lectures and demonstrations on motorcycle riding and maintenance to 250,000 officers and men in all parts of the UK. 

The BSA factory at Small Heath was [[The Blitz|bombed]] by the [[Luftwaffe]] on 26 August 1940 resulting in one H.E.bomb and a shower of incendiaries hitting the main barrel mill which was the only one operating on service rifles in the country, causing the unaffordable loss of 750 [[machine tool]]s but fortunately no loss of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;''BSA Centenary 1861 - 1961, BSA Group News, No. 17 June 1961'', The Birmingham Small Arms Company, no ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; Two further [[Birmingham Blitz|air raids]] took place on 19 and 22 November 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, Tommy ''It wasn't that easy - The Tommy Godwin story'', John Pinkerton Memorial Publishing Fund, 2007, ISBN 978-0-9552115-5-3&lt;/ref&gt; The air raid of 19 November did the most damage, causing loss of production and trapping hundreds of workers. Two BSA night-shift electricians, Alf Stevens and Alf Goodwin, helped rescue their fellow workers. Alf Stevens was awarded the [[George Medal]] for his selfless acts of bravery in the rescue and Alf Goodwin was awarded the [[British Empire Medal]]. Workers involved in the works [[Air Raid Precautions|Civil Defence]] were brought in to help search for and clear bodies to get the plant back into production. The net effect of the November raids was to destroy machine shops in the four-storey 1915 building, the original 1863 gunsmiths' building and nearby buildings, 1,600 machine tools, kill 53 employees, injure 89, 30 of them seriously and halt rifle production for three months.  

The Government [[Ministry of Supply]] and BSA immediately began a process of production dispersal throughout Britain. Factories were set up at [[Tipton]], [[Dudley]], [[Smethwick]], [[Blackheath, West Midlands|Blackheath]], [[Lye, West Midlands|Lye]], [[Kidderminster]], [[Stourport-on-Severn|Stourport]], [[Tyseley]], and [[Bromsgrove]] to manufacture Browning machine guns, [[Stoke-on-Trent|Stoke]], [[Corsham]], and [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]] produced the [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano cannon]], [[Leicester]] and [[Redditch|Studley Road]] produced the [[Besa machine gun]], [[Ruislip]] produced the [[Oerlikon 20mm cannon]], [[Stafford]] produced [[RP-3|rocket projectiles]], [[Tamworth]] produced [[Ordnance QF 2 pounder|two-pounder gun carriages]], [[Mansfield]] produced the [[Boys anti-tank rifle|Boys Anti-tank gun]] and [[Solihull|Shirley]] produced rifles. These were  dispersal factories which were in addition to Small Heath and the other BSA factories opened in the two years following the 1940 blitz. At its peak Small Heath was running 67 factories engaged in war production. BSA operations were also dispersed to other companies under licence. 

In 1941 BSA was approached to produce a new pedal cycle with a maximum weight allowance of only 22&amp;nbsp;lb especially for [[Airborne forces|airborne]] use.  This required a new concept in frame design which BSA found, producing a machine which weighed 21&amp;nbsp;lb, one pound less than the design specification and which also exceeded the design requirement for an effective life of 50 miles many times over. Over 60,000 [[folding bicycle]]s were produced, a figure equal to half the total production of military bicycles during World War II. BSA also produced [[Welbike|folding motorcycles]] for the Airborne Division. In late 1942 BSA examined the [[Special Operations Executive]] designed [[BSA Welgun|Welgun]] with a view to manufacture. BSA were willing to manufacture the gun in the quantities required starting April 1943 but the cheaper and less accurate Sten Mk IV was adopted for production by the Ministry of Supply.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, Frederick and Everett,Douglas, ''S.O.E.- The Scientific Secrets'' Stroud, Gloucester, 2003, ISBN 0-7509-3165-5&lt;/ref&gt;  BSA bought the [[Sunbeam (motorcycle)|Sunbeam]] motorcycles and bicycle business from [[Associated Motor Cycles|Associated Motor Cycles Ltd]] in 1943 and then [[Ariel Motorcycles|Ariel Motors Ltd]] in 1944. During the course of the conflict BSA produced 1,250,000 Lee Enfield .303 service rifles, 404,383 [[Sten]] sub-machine guns, 468,098 Browning machine guns plus spares equivalent to another 100,000, 42,532 Hispano cannon, 32,971 Oerlikon cannon, 59,322 7.9&amp;nbsp;mm Besa machine guns, 3,218 15&amp;nbsp;mm Besa machine guns, 68,882 Boys Anti-tank guns, 126,334 motorcycles,  128,000 military bicycles (over 60,000 of which were folding paratrooper bicycles), 10,000,000 shell fuse cases, 3,485,335 magazines and 750,000 anti-aircraft rockets were supplied to the armed forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; 

At the same time other parts of the Group were having similar problems. Before World War II Daimler had been linked with other Coventry motor manufacturers in a government-backed scheme for aero engine manufacture and had been allocated two shadow factories. Apart from this, BSA-owned Daimler was producing [[Daimler Dingo|Scout Cars]] and Daimler Mk I Armoured Cars which had been designed by BSA at Small Heath not Coventry as well as gun turrets, gun parts, tank transmissions, rocket projectiles and other munitions. This activity had not gone unnoticed by the enemy, which made Radford Works a target in the [[Coventry Blitz|Coventry air raids]]. Radford Works received direct hits in four separate air raids during 1940. None of these attacks were to seriously disrupt production, however two more serious air raids were carried out in April 1941 which destroyed half the factory. In all it is estimated that 170 bombs containing 52,000&amp;nbsp;lbs of explosive were dropped on Radford Works as well as the thousands of incendiaries. Like BSA, Daimler had to find dispersal units.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; A back-handed compliment was paid by Field Marshall [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]] to the workers at Radford Works when he used a captured Daimler Scout to escape following his defeat at [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]].

==Post-war==
As the result of increased post war demand the [[Small Heath]] factory was turned over entirely to motorcycle production.

BSA produced the first Sunbeam bicycle catalogue in 1949 and produced its own '4 Star' derailleur gear with an associated [[Freehub|splined cassette hub]] and 4 sprocket cassette.&lt;ref&gt;BSA Cycles Ltd, 1951 ''Bicycle Replacement Parts, BSA, Sunbeam, New Hudson'' Birmingham Small Arms Company Ltd, no ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;  This design was different from the 1930s Bayliss Wiley cassette hub which had a threaded sprocket carrier.  BSA bought New Hudson motorcycle and bicycle business in 1950 and followed this up in 1951 with the purchase of  [[Triumph Engineering Co Ltd|Triumph Motorcycles]] which brought [[Jack Sangster]] onto the BSA board. The affect of this acquisition was to make BSA into the largest producer of  motorcycles in the world at that time. 

1952 saw BSA establish a Professional Cycling Team. [[Bob Maitland]] a successful amateur cyclist and the highest placed British finisher in the 1948 Olympic Games road race and now an independent  rider in the BSA team was a BSA employee working in the design office as a draughtsman. It was Bob Maitland who was responsible for the design of post war BSA range of lightweight sports bicycles based on his knowledge of cycling.&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, Tommy ''It wasn't that easy – the Tommy Godwin story'', John Pinkerton Memorial Publishing Fund, 2007, ISBN 978-0-9552115-5-3&lt;/ref&gt;  Bob Maitland also made some of the components used on the bicycles of the professional team which were not standard production machines. In the 1952 [[Tour of Britain]] Road Race run between Friday 22 August and Saturday 6 September, involving 14 individual stages and covering a total race distance of  1,470 miles, the BSA team of Bob Maitland, “Tiny” Thomas, Pete Proctor, Alf Newman and Stan Jones won the overall team race and Pete Proctor “King of the Mountains” classification. The riders also enjoyed success on the individual stages of the race. The team competed in four further events, 14 September Tour of the Chilterns, 1st “Tiny” Thomas and Team Prize, 21 September Weston-Super-Mare Grand Prix, Team Prize, 28 September Staffordshire Grand Prix, 1st Bob Maitland and Team Prize, 5 October Tour Revenge Race, Dublin, 1st “Tiny” Thomas and Team prize.&lt;ref&gt;BSA Cycles Ltd, ''The Story of How BSA Won The “Daily Express” TOUR OF BRITAIN TEAM PRIZE and “The King of the Mountains”'', Birmingham Small Arms (1952), no ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953 BSA withdrew motorcycle production from BSA Cycles Ltd, the company it has established in 1919,  by creating BSA Motorcycles Ltd.   BSA also produced its 100,000th [[BSA Bantam]] motorcycle, a fact celebrated at the 1953 motorcycle show with a visit by Sir [[Anthony Eden]] to the BSA stand.  In 1953 the BSA Professional Cycling Team was managed by [[Syd Cozens]].  Successes were 5/6 April Bournmouth 2 Day Road Race, 1st Bob Maitland, 12 April Dover to London 63 Miles Road Race, 1st Stan Jones,  31 May Langsett 90 Miles Road Race, 1st Bob Maitland and “King of the Mountains”,  7 June Tour of the Wrekin, 1st Bob Maitland,  12 July Severn Valley 100 Miles Road Race, 1st “Tiny” Thomas, 19 July Jackson Trophy, Newcastle, Team Prize, 9 August Les Adams Memorial 80 Miles Road Race, 1st Alf Newman, Team Prize, “King of the Mountains” Arthur Ilsley,  30 August Weston-Super-Mare 100 Miles Grand Prix, 1st Bob Maitland, Team Prize.  The team also competed in the 1,624 mile, 12 stage,  1953 Tour of Britain Road Race.  The 1953 line up had changed as Arthur Ilsley replaced Pete Proctor in the team. “Tiny” Thomas won the overall individual classification, the Team were runners-up in the team competition and Arthur Ilsley was 3rd in the “King of the Mountains” competition.  Bob Maitland also had notable success by winning the Independent National Championship.&lt;ref&gt;BSA Cycles Ltd, ''1st BSA Wins “Daily Express” Tour of Britain'', Birmingham Small Arms, (November 1953), no ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;

1954 saw the introduction of  the BSA Quick Release 3 Speed hub gear.  It was a split axle three speed gear intended for use with bicycles equipped with oil bath chainguards.  The original BSA 3 speed hub gear had been made under licence from the Three-Speed Gear Syndicate since 1907.  The design was later to be classified as the [[Sturmey-Archer]] 'Type X', but all BSA hub gear production ceased in 1955&lt;ref&gt;Hadland, Tony ''The Sturmey-Archer Story'', privately published, (1987), ISBN 0-9507431-2-7&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sir [[Bernard Docker]] remained chairman of BSA until 1956 when the BSA removed him.  In an acrimonious dispute conducted in the media the matter was brought to the BSA shareholders at the Annual General Meeting where the decision of the Board was upheld. Another significant departure for the fortune of the BSA Group but less controversial was the retirement on ill health grounds of James Leek CBE, Managing Director from 1939 until his retirement. Sir Bernard Docker was replaced as Chairman of the BSA Board by Jack Sangster.&lt;ref&gt;Ryerson Barry 1980 '' The Giants of Small Heath – The History of BSA '' Sparkford, ISBN : 0-85429-255-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The BSA bicycle division, BSA Cycles Ltd., including the BSA cycle dealer network was sold to [[Raleigh (bicycle)|Raleigh]] in 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowden Gregory Houston 1975&quot;&gt;Bowden Gregory Houston 1975 ''The Story of the Raleigh Cycle'' London, ISBN : 0-491-01675-1&lt;/ref&gt;  Raleigh initially continued bicycle production in Birmingham at Coventry Road, Sheldon, Birmingham 26 into the early 1960s using up BSA parts but as time went on more stock Raleigh parts and fittings were used, some continuing to bear the 'piled arms' stamp. [[Tube Investments|TI Group]] owners of the [[British Cycle Corporation]] bought Raleigh in 1960 thus gaining access to the BSA brand.  Bicycles bearing the BSA name are currently manufactured and distributed within India by [[TI Cycles of India]] but have no direct connection to the original Birmingham BSA company.

In 1960, [[Daimler Motor Company|Daimler]] was sold off to [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]].

1961 was the centenary year of the BSA Group and in recognition of this milestone the company magazine produced an anniversary issue of ''BSA Group News'' in June  ''BSA Centenary 1861–1961'' in which many of the achievements of the Group were celebrated. This year also saw the end of military rifle production, however BSA still continued to make sporting guns. In 1986 BSA Guns was liquidated, the assets bought and renamed '''BSA Guns (UK) Ltd'''. The company continues to make air rifles and shotguns, and is still based in [[Small Heath, West Midlands|Small Heath]] in Birmingham.

===Norton-Villiers-Triumph===
The Group continued to expand and acquire throughout the 1950s, but by 1965 competition from Japan (in the shape of companies like [[Honda]], [[Yamaha]] and [[Suzuki]]) and Europe from [[Jawa Motors|Jawa]] / [[Česká Zbrojovka Strakonice|CZ]], [[Bultaco]] and [[Husqvarna Motorcycles|Husqvarna]] was eroding BSA's market share. The BSA (and Triumph range) were no longer aligned with the markets; [[moped]]s were displacing [[scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]] sales; [[superbike]] engine capacity had risen to 1000 cc, and the [[motorcycle trial|trials]] and [[Motorcycle scrambling|scrambles]] areas were now the preserve of European [[two-stroke engine|two-stroke]]s. Some poor marketing decisions and expensive projects contributed to substantial losses. For example, the development and production investment of the Ariel 3, an ultra stable 3 wheel moped, was not recouped by sales; the loss has been estimated at £2&amp;nbsp;million.

In 1968, BSA announced many changes to its product line of singles, twins and the new three-cylinder machine named the &quot;Rocket three&quot; for the 1969 model year. It now concentrated on the more promising USA, and to a lesser extent, Canadian, markets. However, despite the adding of modern accessories, for example, turn signals and even differing versions of the A65 twins for home and export sale, the damage had been done and the end was near. 

Reorganisation in 1971 concentrated motorcycle production at Meriden, Triumph's site, with production of components and engines at BSA's Small Heath. At the same time there were [[Layoff|redundancies]] and the selling of assets. [[Barclays Bank]] arranged financial backing to the tune of £10&amp;nbsp;million. 

Upgrades and service bulletins continued until 1972, but the less service-intensive Japanese bikes had by then flooded the market on both sides of the Atlantic. The merger with Norton Villers was started in late 1972, and for a brief time a Norton 500 single was built with the [[BSA B50|B50]]-based unit-single engine, but few if any were sold publicly. The BSA unit single B50's 500 cc enjoyed much improvement in the hands of the CCM motorcycle company allowing the basic BSA design to continue until the mid to late 1970s in a competitive form all over Europe.

By 1972, BSA was so moribund that, with [[bankruptcy]] imminent, its motorcycle businesses were merged (as part of a government-initiated rescue plan) with the [[Manganese Bronze]] company, [[Norton-Villiers]], to become [[Norton-Villiers-Triumph]] with the intention of producing and marketing [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]] and [[Triumph Engineering Co Ltd|Triumph]] motorcycles at home and abroad. In exchange for its motorcycle businesses, Manganese Bronze received BSA Group's non-motorcycle-related divisions&amp;mdash;namely, [[Carbodies]]. Although the BSA name was left out of the new company's name, a few products continued to be made carrying it until 1973. The final range was just four models: Gold Star 500, 650 Thunderbolt/Lightning and the 750 cc [[BSA Rocket 3|Rocket Three]].

However, the plan involved the axing of some brands, large redundancies and consolidation of production at two sites. This scheme to rescue and combine Norton, BSA and Triumph failed in the face of worker resistance. Norton's and BSA's factories were eventually shut down, while Triumph staggered on to fail four years later. 
==BSA Company Limited==
When NVT Motorcycles Limited was liquidated its management formed a new company naming it BSA Company and bought from NVT the rights to the BSA Motorcycle marque.

BSA Company produced military motorcycles (with [[Rotax]] engines) and motorcycles for developing countries (with Yamaha engines) under the BSA name. In the latter case the old &quot;Bushman&quot; name was recalled to duty&amp;nbsp;– it had previously been used on high ground clearance [[BSA Bantam|Bantams]] sold for the likes of Australian sheep farmers. A children's off road scrambler was marketed under the BSA/McLaren name in the 1990s but very few were sold.

In 1991, BSA Company Limited merged with Andover Norton International Limited to form a new BSA Group, largely producing spare parts for existing motorcycles. In December 1994, BSA Group was taken over by a newly formed BSA Regal Group, an engineering and company specialising in plumbing supplies. The new company, based in [[Southampton]], planned to supply spares parts. However, this has not been viable and it now subcontracts this business. It attempted to produce a number of limited-edition, retro-styled motorcycles in the 90's but, using a Yamaha engine, the motor cycles did not sell.

===Bicycles===
According to Charles Spencer, BSA was manufacturing the &quot;Delta&quot; bicycle circa 1869. In 1880 the company was approached to manufacture the &quot;Otto Dicycle&quot;. An initial contract was signed to produce 210 and a further contract followed for a further 200.  In all it is believed that a total of 953 Otto machines were made. BSA then went into bicycle production on their own account, the first machines to their own specification being exhibited at the 1881 Stanley Show. BSA went on to design and manufacture a &quot;safety&quot; bicycle (patent:15,342 of 1884). BSA was also producing tricycles and a licence was obtained in 1885 to manufacture ball bearings. BSA ceased bicycle manufacture in 1887 because of the demand for arms. Bicycle component manufacture commenced in 1894 and BSA continued to supply the bicycle trade up to 1936. The company recommenced bicycle manufacture on their own account again in 1908 and these were exhibited at the Stanley Show in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Millar Ray, (second edition 2009), '' An Encyclopaedia of Cycle Manufacturers - The Early Years up to 1918 '', Veteran-Cycle Club, ISBN : 978-0-9560430-5-4&lt;/ref&gt;  Bicycle manufacture was what led BSA into motorcycles. BSA produced bicycles for both the police and military and notably a folding bicycle for the British Army during World War I &lt;ref&gt;Birmingham Small Arms, 1918, '' BSA History from the days of the Crimea '', Birmingham, no ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.rifleman.org.uk/BSA_early_history.htm] and the more well known folding Paratroopers bicycle during World War II.  BSA supplied the Irish Army with bicycles after 1922. 

BSA manufactured a range of bicycles from utility roadsters through to racing bicycles. The BSA range of Sports bicycles expanded in the 1930s following the granting of a  patent for a new lighter design of seat lug in 1929 &lt;ref&gt;Intellectual Property Office, (patent application date 04-07-1929), ''GB332384(A) Improvements in or relating to the construction of cycle frames'' BSA Birmingham, no ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; and tandems were introduced into the BSA bicycle range as well. BSA had a reputation for quality and durability and their components were more expensive that either Chater-Lea or Brampton.  BSA launched a high end club cyclists machine in the early 1930s initially branded as the &quot;Super-eeze&quot;. Never slow to avail of publicity BSA sponsored the great Australian cyclist [[Hubert Opperman]] [http://www.flickr.com/photos/75395133@N00/3415216471/in/set-72157603949012058/] and re-branded the top of the range machine the &quot;Opperman&quot; model [http://www.flickr.com/photos/75395133@N00/2777313275/in/set-72157606633777810/][http://www.flickr.com/photos/75395133@N00/2777318159/in/set-72157606633777810/]. A less expensive range of clubman lightweight machines was introduced from 1936 with the &quot;Cyclo&quot; 3 speed derailleur equipped &quot;Clubman&quot;. Subtle changes were made to the range, most models being equipped with &quot;Russ&quot; patent forks [http://www.flickr.com/photos/75395133@N00/4027019497/in/set-72157606633777810/] and some models were made for only two seasons. This all stopped around September 1939 with the outbreak of war. A revised catalogue with a much reduced range was issued in March 1940 which also saw the launch of the BSA &quot;Streamlight&quot; model [http://www.flickr.com/photos/75395133@N00/3041830262/in/set-72157606633777810/].  A novel all white bicycle [http://www.flickr.com/photos/75395133@N00/3040988703/in/set-72157606633777810/] was produced for the blackout but had disappeared from a severely reduced bicycle range the details of which were circulated to dealers from December 1941. BSA had ceased production of their 3 speed hub gear in 1939 and production appears to have started again by 1945 although with a black finish instead of chromium plating.  BSA bought '''Sunbeam''' in 1943 and produced Sunbeam bicycles using up existing frames and parts and using BSA components for the missing bits.  The first BSA produced Sunbeam catalogue was published in 1949 &lt;ref&gt;Pinkerton John, Roberts Derek, Hadland Tony and Lawrence Scotford, 2002 '' Sunbeam Cycles - The Story from the Catalogues 1887–1957 '', Pinkerton Press, Birmingham, ISBN : 0-9536174-3-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Post war BSA expanded their bicycle range but faced problems of shortages of raw materials such as steel and was required to export a lot of their manufactured output in order to get a Government licence to purchase the necessary raw materials.  The company moved bicycle production to the new Waverley Works after World War II.  BSA continued to innovate introducing the 4 Star derailleur gear in 1949 &lt;ref&gt;Berto, Frank J, 2005 '' The Dancing Chain - History and Development of the Derailleur Bicycle '' Page 168, 2nd Edition, Van der Plas Publications/Cycle Publishing, ISBN : 1-892495-41-1&lt;/ref&gt; along with an associated 4 speed 'unit' or cassette hub. The derailleur design was altered from 1950&lt;ref&gt;BSA Cycles Ltd, June 1950 Bicycle Catalogue ''It's Time You Had a BSA'' Birmingham Small Arms Company Ltd, no ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; and was certainly available up to 1953 but was not a great success. BSA bought '''New Hudson''' in 1950 &lt;ref&gt;BSA Cycles Ltd, April 1950 ''Letter to Dealers reference newspaper advertising campaign for New Hudson bicycles to be run in local newspapers from March to August 1950'', Birmingham, no ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;  and started to manufacture and sell New Hudson branded machines as well as Sunbeam. It appears that the top of the range BSA lightweight club cyclist machine was the &quot;Gold Column&quot; and this appears to have been changed into the BSA &quot;Tour of Britain&quot; model following the success of the BSA Professional Cycling Team in the 1952 Tour of Britain race.  The &quot;Tour of Britain&quot; model was heavily promoted in the BSA 1953 sales literature. The factory made &quot;Tour of Britain&quot; model was not the same as those ridden by the professional team.  Only eight machines were crafted for the professional team and none of the components appear to have been standard BSA parts. 1953 saw BSA separate the bicycle / motorcar and motorcycle business into different holdings.

The good times were coming to an end and demand for bicycles fell with the end of rationing in 1954 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/4/newsid_3818000/3818563.stm]. James Leek, managing director of BSA Cycles Ltd was suffering ill health and he retired in 1956, the same year  the BSA Chairman, Sir Bernard Docker,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862195-1,00.html Time magazine 11 June 1956]&lt;/ref&gt; was removed from the BSA Board. [[Jack Sangster]] who had joined the BSA Board in 1951 following the purchase of his company Triumph Motorcycles became Chairman. The bicycle manufacturing business '''BSA Cycles Ltd''' was sold to [[Raleigh Industries]] in 1957.

BSA Motorcycles were made by BSA Motorcycles Ltd, under the BSA parent. The first wholly BSA motorcycle, the 3½ H.P. [http://www.flickr.com/photos/75395133@N00/4061329166/in/set-72157617635371402/ ] was built in 1910 and displayed at the first Olympia Show, London on the 21st November in that year. Sir [[Hallewell Rogers]], BSA Chairman, had informed the shareholders at the Company's 1910 AGM in Birmingham &quot;We have decided to put a motor-bicycle on the market for the coming season....These machines will be on exhibit at the Cycle and Motor Show on November 21st, after which date we look forward to commencing delivery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ryerson Barry, 1980 '' The Giants of Small Heath - History of BSA '' Sparkford, ISBN : 0-85429-255-1&lt;/ref&gt; The machines were available for the 1911 season and entire production sold out. BSA had previously acquired a commercially available engine in 1905 and fitted it to one of their bicycle frames and discovered at first hand the problems which needed to be overcome. '''BSA Cycles Ltd''' was set up as a subsidiary company in 1919 under Managing Director Charles Hyde to manufacture both bicycles and motorcycles.&lt;ref&gt;Ryerson Barry, 1980 ''The Giants of Small Heath - History of BSA'' Sparkford, ISBN : 0-85429-255-1&lt;/ref&gt;

BSA produced their only two stroke motorcycle design for the 1928 season, the 1.74 H.P. Model A28 with two speed gearbox. [http://www.flickr.com/photos/75395133@N00/3259521645/in/set-72157606633777810/ ] It was produced as the A29 and A30 the following two years and became the A31 with a three speed gearbox in 1931, the last year of production.  The post war 'Bantam' was a German [[Dampf-Kraft-Wagen|DKW]] design which was part of war reparation and it was not a true BSA design.

BSA motorcycles were sold as affordable motorcycles with reasonable performance for the average user. BSA stressed the reliability of their machines, the availability of spares and dealer support. The motorcycles were a mixture of sidevalve and OHV engines offering different performance for different roles, e.g. hauling a [[sidecar]]. The bulk of use would be for commuting. BSA motorcycles were also popular with &quot;fleet buyers&quot; in Britain, who (for example) used the Bantams for telegram delivery for the [[General Post Office|Post Office]] or motorcycle/sidecar combinations for AA patrols [[The Automobile Association]] (AA) breakdown help services. This mass market appeal meant they could claim &quot;one in four is a BSA&quot; on advertising.

Machines with better specifications were available for those who wanted more performance or for competition work.

Initially, after World War II, BSA motorcycles were not generally seen as racing machines, compared to the likes of [[Norton (motorcycle)|Norton]]. In the immediate post war period few were entered in races such as the TT races, though this changed dramatically in the Junior Clubman event (smaller engine motorcycles racing over some 3 or 4 laps around one of the Isle of Man courses). In 1947 there were but a couple of BSA mounted riders, but by 1952 BSA were in the majority and in 1956 the makeup was 53 BSA, 1 Norton and 1 [[Velocette]].

To improve US sales, in 1954, for example, BSA entered a team of riders in the [[Daytona 200|200 mile Daytona beach race]] with a mixture of single cylinder [[BSA Gold Star|Gold Stars]] and twin cylinder [[BSA Shooting Star|Shooting Star]]s assembled by Roland Pike. The BSA team riders took first, second, third, fourth, and fifth places with two more riders finishing at 8th and 16th. This was the first case of a one brand sweep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/news/2004/DaytonaBSA.asp BSA: 50 years later&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The BSA factory experienced success in the sport of [[motocross]] with [[Jeff Smith (motorcyclist)|Jeff Smith]] riding a B40 to capture the 1964 and 1965 [[Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] [[List of motocross World Championship results|500 cc Motocross World Championships]]. It would be the last year the title would be won by a [[four-stroke]] machine until the mid-1990s.
A BSA motocross machine was often colloquially known as a &quot;Beezer.&quot;

Birmingham rocker Steve Gibbons released a song &quot;BSA&quot; on his 1980 album &quot;Saints &amp; Sinners&quot; as a tribute to the Gold Star. He still plays this song with his band and often performs on the Isle of Man at the TT races.

The C11 used a C10 motor fitted with an [[overhead valve]] cylinder head. The C11 frame was almost unchanged until 1951 when BSA added [[Suspension (motorcycle)#Plunger suspension|plunger rear suspension]]. Early [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearboxes]] were weak and unreliable. The C11G was available with a three ratio gearbox and rigid frame or a four ratio gearbox and a plunger frame. Both models had better front brakes than earlier models. This model was a common commuter motorcycle, and many survive today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Bovril 250g.jpg|200px|thumb|right| Bovril in a 250 gram jar]]

'''Bovril''' is the trademarked name of a thick, salty [[meat extract]], developed in the 1870s by [[John Lawson Johnston]] and sold in a distinctive, bulbous jar. It is made in [[Burton upon Trent]], [[Staffordshire]], owned and distributed by [[Unilever]] UK.

Bovril can be made into a drink by diluting with hot water, or less commonly with milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1302&amp;dat=19310701&amp;id=CV0RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=P5YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3083,128400 |title=Try Brovil and milk (advert), |newspaper=[[The Sydney Mail]] |date=1 July 1931 |page 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used as a flavouring for [[soup]]s, [[stew]]s or [[porridge]], or spread on [[bread]], especially [[toast]], rather like [[Marmite]].

The first part of the product's name comes from [[Latin]] ''bos'' ([[genitive]] ''bovis'') meaning &quot;ox&quot; or &quot;cow.&quot; Johnston took the ''-vril'' suffix from [[Edward George Bulwer-Lytton|Bulwer-Lytton]]'s then-popular 1870 &quot;lost race&quot; novel ''[[The Coming Race]]'', whose plot revolves around a powerful energy fluid named &quot;Vril.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;patent-law-42&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=William Phillips|title=Handbook of patent law of all countries.|publisher=Stevens|location=London|year=1920|pages=42|url=http://www.archive.org/details/handbookofpatent00thomiala|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uni&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ubfoods.co.uk/ourbrands/foods/bovril.asp |title=Unilever brands |publisher=ubfoods.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bovril poster c1900.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Poster for Bovril, about 1900 [[V&amp;A Museum]] no. E.163-1973]]

In 1870, in the war against the [[Prussia]]ns, [[Napoleon III]] ordered one million cans of beef to feed his starving troops. The task of providing all this beef went to a [[Scotsman]] named [[John Lawson Johnston]]. Large quantities of beef were available across the British Dominions and South America, but its transport and storage were problematic. Therefore Johnston created a product known as 'Johnston's Fluid Beef,' later called Bovril, to meet the needs of the [[French people]] and Napoleon III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bovril.co.uk/content/history/history.pdf |title=History |publisher=borvil.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1888 over 3,000 [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[public house]]s, [[grocer]]s and [[Dispensing chemist|chemist]]s were selling Bovril. In 1889 the Bovril Company was formed.

Bovril continued to function as a &quot;war food&quot; in [[World War I]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ramc-99&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Vivian|first=Evelyn Charles|title=With the Royal army medical corps (R.A.M.C.) at the front|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|year=1914|pages=99|url=http://www.archive.org/details/withroyalarmymed00vivirich}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was frequently mentioned in the 1930 account ''Not So Quiet... Stepdaughters of War'' by Helen Zenna Smith ([[Evadne Price]]). As a drink mixing the beef flavouring with hot water, it helped sustain ambulance drivers and men in trenches.

A thermos of ''beef tea'' was the favoured way to fend off the chill of winter matches for generations of Scottish and English [[Association football|football]] enthusiasts; to this day Bovril dissolved in hot water is sold in stadiums all over the [[United Kingdom]]. Bovril ''beef tea'' was the main warm drink that [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s team had to drink when they were marooned on [[Elephant Island]] during the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition|Endurance Expedition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9504E1DF1F3FE233A25752C1A96F9C946796D6CF|title=Shackleton's men kept hope of rescue high; Marooned Scientists, Living on Penguin and Seaweed, Watched Daily for Relief.|date=1916-09-11|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-05-11 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When John Lawson Johnston died, [[George Lawson Johnston, 1st Baron Luke|George Lawson Johnston]] inherited the Bovril business. In 1929, George Lawson Johnston was recognised by the [[British Government]] and [[monarchy]] and was ennobled as [[Baron Luke|Lord Luke of Pavenham]] in the county of Bedford. This hereditary title passed to [[Ian Lawson Johnston, 2nd Baron Luke|Ian St John Lawson Johnston]] in 1943 and to [[Arthur Lawson Johnston, 3rd Baron Luke|Arthur Charles St John Lawson Johnston]] in 1996. The current Lord Luke is one of the 92 hereditary peers elected to remain in the [[House of Lords]] of the [[United Kingdom]] after its 1999 [[Reform of the House of Lords|reform]].

Bovril's instant beef stock was launched in 1966 and its &quot;King of Beef&quot; range of instant flavours for [[stew]]s, [[casserole]]s and [[gravy]] in 1971.

In 1971 [[Cavenham Foods]] acquired the Bovril Company but then sold most of its dairies and [[South America]]n operations to finance further take-overs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ketupa.net/goldsmith.htm Goldsmith]&lt;/ref&gt; The brand is now owned by [[Unilever]].&lt;ref name=uni/&gt;

Bovril holds the unusual position of having been advertised with a [[Pope]]. An advertising campaign of the early 20th century in Britain depicted the [[Pope]] seated on his throne, bearing a mug of Bovril. The campaign slogan read: ''The Two Infallible Powers - The Pope &amp; Bovril.''

==Product range==
* Bovril 125g
* Bovril 250g
* Bovril 500g
* Bovril 125g (Chicken)
* Bovril cubes (12x71g)

==Licensed production==
Bovril is also produced in [[South Africa]] by the Bokomo division of Pioneer Foods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pioneerfoods.co.za |title=Pioneer Foods |publisher=pioneerfoods.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product range includes a version with chili.
The manufacturer also hoped to increase exports (Unilever UK &amp; Ireland Export) to Asian countries such as [[Malaysia]], a primarily [[Muslim]] country where the government was becoming restrictive regarding non-[[halal]] meat. By changing Bovril to a non-meat base, Unilever hoped to increase sales there, where people enjoy Bovril stirred into porridge.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

The removal of beef from the recipe in 2004 was not without criticism, with many complaining that the new variant did not taste the same and had a different [[mouth feel]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Beef extract was eventually reintroduced as a key Bovril ingredient in 2006, after the [[European Commission]] lifted its ban on the export of Britain's beef products; it was only at this point that the manufacturer stated explicitly that this had been the main reason for beef's removal. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

During the [[Siege of Ladysmith]] in the [[Second Boer War]] a Bovril-like paste was unofficially produced from horse meat within the garrison. Nicknamed ''Chevril'' (by replacing the Bov (''ox'') with Chev (''horse'') in the Bovril name) it was produced by boiling down horse meat or mules to a jelly paste and serving it as a ''beef tea.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watt|first=S|title=Intombi Military Hospital and Cemetery|journal=Military History Journal|publisher=Die Suid-Afrikaanse Krygshistoriese Vereniging|volume=5|issue=6|url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol056sw.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacson|first=M|title=The Record of a Regiment of the Line|publisher=Hutchinson &amp; Co. |year=1908 |pages=88 |chapter=II |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipe changes==
In November 2004, the manufacturers, [[Unilever]], announced that the composition of Bovril was being changed from beef extract to a [[yeast extract]], claiming it was to make the product suitable for [[vegetarian]]s and [[vegan]]s; at that time fear of [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE) may have been a factor. According to Unilever, ''&quot;in blind taste tests, 10% didn't notice any difference in taste, 40% preferred the original and 50% preferred the new product.&quot;'' {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
It now produces Bovril using beef and chicken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unilever.co.uk/brands/foodbrands/bovril.aspx |title=Bovril Unilever food brands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{In popular culture|date=February 2011}}
Bovril was famously advertised as a potential aid to slimming in the 1980s via an ad campaign featuring actress and model [[Jerry Hall]], using the slogan &quot;Are you a Bovril body?&quot;  {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Bovril is served at the [[Groucho Club]] and is associated with [[football culture]], being commonly drunk on the terraces from [[thermos]] flasks in winter. At Scottish football stadiums containers such as thermos flasks are [[Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995#Part II - Sporting Events: Control of Alcohol etc.|banned by law]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.police-information.co.uk/legislation/legislationindexsco.html ''Scottish Legislation - Alcohol at sporting events''] at Police-Information.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; so Bovril is purchased inside the grounds where it is served in polystyrene or plastic cups. Some Bovril lovers (as seen at football matches) like to shake [[Black pepper#Varieties of pepper|white pepper]] and a little [[Cayenne pepper|cayenne]] into the drink.
[[Burton Albion]] have named their home end after Bovril due to the sponsorships between club and company.  {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Famous Bovril drinkers include former [[Ipswich Town]] stalwart [[Bontcho Guentchev]], BB7's [[Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace]], Lewis Tomalin from the 'Perfect Week' and London Scottish's Martin Tattersall. In July 2008, ''[[NME]]'' magazine referred to up-and-coming Manchester-based indie band Mucky Minds as ''[[Vampire Weekend]] on Bovril.'' {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

On ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]],'' February 20, 2011 [[James May]] had Bovril in an urn inside a [[Claas]] Dominator combine harvester in Norway, which was converted into a snow plow.  Expressing its necessity on the British way of life as he knows it, he stated on the program, &quot;We all know that when it's snowing and it's cold you have Bovril.  That's a rule of life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x31w1/episodes/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roald Dahl]]'s book [[Matilda]] the title character would read books while drinking hot chocolate, but occasionally she would make Bovril or [[Ovaltine]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Dr. Benjamin D. Santer''' (June 3, 1955 in [[Washington, DC]], [[United States]]) is a [[climate]] researcher at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] and former researcher at the [[University of East Anglia]]'s [[Climatic Research Unit]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Pearce|Pearce, Fred]], ''The Climate Files:  The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming'', (2010) [[Guardian Books]], ISBN:  978-0-85265-229-9, p. XI.&lt;/ref&gt; He specializes mainly in [[statistical analysis]] of climate data sets, and detection/attribution of [[climate change]] forcings. He was the convening Lead Author of Chapter 8 of 1995 [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] Working Group I Report, which addressed the [[global warming]] issue.

==Honors==
In 1998 Santer was awarded a [[MacArthur Foundation]] grant of $270,000 for research supporting the finding that human activity contributes to global warming. He has also received the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award and a Distinguished Scientist Fellowship from the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] and the Norbert Gerbier/MUMM award from the [[World Meteorological Organization]]. He ranks #12 amongst climate scientists in a 2002 assessment of most influential scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esi-topics.com/gwarm/authors/b1a.html Global Warming]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

[[Frederick Seitz]], in a June 12, 1996 editorial-page piece in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' complained that alterations made to Chapter 8 of the 1995 IPCC report were made to &quot;deceive policy makers and the public into believing that the scientific evidence shows human activities are causing global warming.&quot; Similar charges were made by the [[Global Climate Coalition]] (GCC), a consortium of industry interests.

Santer and 40 other scientists responded to the ''Wall Street Journal'' that all IPCC procedural rules were followed, and that IPCC procedures required changes to the draft in response to comments from governments, individual scientists, and non-governmental organizations. They stated that the pre- and post-Madrid versions of Chapter 8 were equally cautious in their statements; that roughly 20% of Chapter 8 is devoted to the discussion of uncertainties in estimates of natural climate variability and the expected signal due to human activities; and that both versions of the chapter reached the same conclusion: &quot;Taken together, these results point towards a human influence on climate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucar.edu/communications/quarterly/summer96/insert.html Special insert--An open letter to Ben Santer].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the '''Bernoulli numbers''' ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are a [[sequence]] of [[rational number]]s with deep connections to [[number theory]]. They are closely related to the values of the [[Riemann zeta function]] at negative integers.

There are several conventions for Bernoulli numbers. The most common has
B&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 for all odd ''n'' other than 1, and  B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; =  −1/2, but some authors use B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; =  +1/2 and some write ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. The values of the first few nonzero Bernoulli numbers are (more values [[#Values of the Bernoulli numbers|below]]):

The Bernoulli numbers were discovered around the same time by the Swiss mathematician [[Jakob Bernoulli]], after whom they are named, and independently by Japanese mathematician [[Seki Kōwa]].  Seki's discovery was posthumously published in 1712&lt;ref name=&quot;selin 1997&quot;&gt;Selin, H. (1997), p. 891&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smith mikami 1914&quot;&gt;Smith, D. E. (1914), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;  in his work ''Katsuyo Sampo''; Bernoulli's, also posthumously, in his ''[[Ars Conjectandi]]'' of 1713.

They  appear in the [[Taylor series]] expansions of the [[tangent function|tangent]] and [[Hyperbolic function|hyperbolic tangent]] functions, in the [[Euler–Maclaurin formula]], and in expressions for certain values of the Riemann zeta function.

In [[Ada Byron's notes on the analytical engine|note G]] of [[Ada Lovelace|Ada Lovelace's]] notes on the [[analytical engine]] from 1842, Lovelace describes an [[algorithm]] for generating Bernoulli numbers with [[Charles Babbage|Babbage's]] machine.&lt;ref&gt;''Note G'' in the Menabrea reference&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Bernoulli numbers have the distinction of being the subject of the first [[computer program]].

== Sum of powers ==

{{main|Faulhaber's formula}}

[[Closed-form expression|Closed forms]] of the sum of powers for fixed values of ''m''

:&lt;math&gt; S_m(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n k^m = 1^m + 2^m + \cdots + n^m \, &lt;/math&gt;

are always [[polynomial]]s in ''n'' of degree ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.   Note that ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for all ''m''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 because in this case the sum is the [[empty sum]].  The [[coefficient]]s of these polynomials are related to the Bernoulli numbers by '''Bernoulli's formula''':
: &lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = {1\over{m+1}}\sum_{k=0}^m {m+1\choose{k}} B_k n^{m+1-k}, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+1/2.

Let ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0. Taking ''m'' to be 0 and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 gives the [[natural number]]s 0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;... (sequence {{OEIS2C|A001477}}).

:&lt;math&gt; 0 + 1 + 1 + \cdots + 1 = \frac{1}{1}\left(B_0 n\right) = n.&lt;/math&gt;

Taking ''m'' to be 1 and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2 gives the [[triangular number]]s 0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;6,&amp;nbsp;... (sequence {{OEIS2C|A000217}}).

:&lt;math&gt; 0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{1}{2}\left(B_0 n^2+2B_1 n^1\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left(n^2+n\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Taking ''m'' to be 2 and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/6 gives the [[square pyramidal number]]s 0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;5,&amp;nbsp;14,&amp;nbsp;... (sequence {{OEIS2C|A000330}}).

: &lt;math&gt; 0 + 1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 = \frac{1}{3}\left(B_0 n^3+3B_1 n^2+3B_2 n^1 \right) = \frac{1}{3}\left(n^3+\frac{3}{2}n^2+\frac{1}{2}n\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Some authors state Bernoulli's formula in a different way:
: &lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = {1\over{m+1}}\sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k {m+1\choose{k}} B_k n^{m+1-k} &lt;/math&gt;,
where ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1/2. In the next section consequences of the resulting differences will be commented on as they are likely to produce some confusion.

Bernoulli's formula is sometimes called [[Faulhaber's formula]] after [[Johann Faulhaber]] who also found remarkable ways to calculate sum of powers.

Faulhaber's formula was generalized by V. Guo and J. Zeng to a [[q-analog]] {{harv|Guo|Zeng|2005}}.

== Definitions ==

Many characterizations of the Bernoulli numbers have been found in the last 300 years, and each could be used to introduce these numbers.  Here only four of the most useful ones are mentioned:

* a recursive equation,
* an explicit formula,
* a generating function,
* an algorithmic description.

For the proof of the [[Logical equivalence|equivalence]] of the four approaches the reader is referred to mathematical expositions like {{Harv|Ireland|Rosen|1990}} or {{Harv|Conway|Guy|1996}}.

Unfortunately in the literature the definition is given in two variants: Despite the fact that Bernoulli defined ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2, some authors set ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1/2 (more on different conventions below).&amp;nbsp;In order to prevent potential confusions both variants will be described here, side by side.

=== Recursive definition ===

The recursive equation is best introduced in a slightly more general form

: &lt;math&gt; B_m(n)=n^m-\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\binom mk\frac{B_k(n)}{m-k+1} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

This equation defines rational numbers ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') for all integers ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0, ''m'' ≥ 0.  0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; has to be interpreted as 1. The recursion has its base in ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = 1 for all ''n''.  The two variants now follow by setting ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 respectively ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.  Additionally the notation is simplified by erasing the reference to the parameter&amp;nbsp;''n''.
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;
|-
! ''n'' = 0
! ''n'' = 1
|-
| &lt;math&gt; B_m = \left[ m = 0 \right] -\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\binom mk\frac{B_k}{m-k+1} &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt; B_m= 1 - \sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\binom mk\frac{B_k}{m-k+1} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

Here the expression [''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0] has the value 1 if ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and 0 otherwise ([[Iverson bracket]]).  Whenever a confusion between the two kinds of definitions might arise it can be avoided by referring to the more general definition and by reintroducing the erased parameter: writing ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(0) in the first case and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(1) in the second will unambiguously denote the value in question.

=== Explicit definition ===

Starting again with a slightly more general formula

: &lt;math&gt; B_m(n)=\sum_{k=0}^m\sum_{v=0}^k(-1)^v\binom kv\frac{\left( n+v\right) ^m}{k+1} , &lt;/math&gt;

the choices ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 lead to
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;
|-
! ''n'' = 0
! ''n'' = 1
|-
| &lt;math&gt; B_m=\sum_{k=0}^m\sum_{v=0}^k(-1)^v\binom kv\frac{v^m}{k+1} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt; B_m=\sum_{k=1}^{m+1}\sum_{v=1}^{k+1}(-1)^{v+1}\binom{k-1}{v-1}\frac{v^m}k \ .&lt;/math&gt;
|}

There is a widespread misinformation that no simple closed formulas
for the Bernoulli numbers exist. The last two equations show that  this is not true. Moreover, already in 1893 [[:de:Louis Saalschütz|Louis Saalschütz]] listed  a total of 38 explicit formulas for the Bernoulli numbers {{Harv|Saalschütz|1893}},
usually giving some reference in the older literature.

=== Generating function ===

The general formula for the generating function is

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{te^{nt}}{e^t-1}=\sum_{m=0}^\infty B_m(n)\frac{t^m}{m!} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The choices ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 lead to
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;
|-
! ''n'' = 0
! ''n'' = 1
|-
| &lt;math&gt; \frac t{e^t-1}=\sum_{m=0}^\infty B_m\frac{t^m}{m!}  &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt; \frac t{1-e^{-t}}=\sum_{m=0}^\infty B_m\frac{t^m}{m!}  &lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Algorithmic description ===

Although the above recursive formula can be used for computation it is
mainly used to establish the connection with the sum of powers because it is [[computationally expensive]].  However, both simple and high-end algorithms for computing Bernoulli numbers exist. A simple one is given in pseudocode below in the text box 'Akiyama&amp;ndash;Tanigawa algorithm' and pointers to high-end algorithms are given the next section below.

== Efficient computation of Bernoulli numbers ==

In some applications it is useful to be able to compute the Bernoulli numbers ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; through ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/sub&gt; modulo ''p'', where ''p'' is a prime; for example to test whether [[Vandiver's conjecture]] holds for ''p'', or even just to determine whether ''p'' is an [[irregular prime]]. It is not feasible to carry out such a computation using the above recursive formulae, since at least (a constant multiple of) ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; arithmetic operations would be required. Fortunately, faster methods have been developed {{harv|Buhler|Crandall|Ernvall|Metsankyla|2001}} which require only O(''p''&amp;nbsp;(log&amp;nbsp;''p'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) operations (see [[big-O notation]]).

David Harvey {{harv|Harvey|2008}} describes an algorithm for computing Bernoulli numbers by computing ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; modulo ''p'' for
many small primes ''p'', and then reconstructing ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; via the [[Chinese Remainder Theorem]]. Harvey writes that the [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] [[Computational complexity theory|time complexity]] of this algorithm is O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; log(''n'')&lt;sup&gt;2+eps&lt;/sup&gt;) and claims that this [[implementation]] is significantly faster than implementations based on other methods. Harvey's implementation is included in [[Sage (mathematics software)|Sage]] since version 3.1. Using this implementation Harvey computed ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;, which is a new record (October 2008). Prior to that Bernd Kellner {{harv|Kellner|2002}}&lt;!--A more specific citation would be preferrable.--&gt; computed ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to full precision for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; in December 2002 and Oleksandr Pavlyk {{harv|Pavlyk|2008}} for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; with 'Mathematica' in April 2008.

*''Digits'' is to be understood as the exponent of 10 when ''B''(''n'') is written as a real in normalized [[scientific notation]].

== Different viewpoints and conventions ==

The Bernoulli numbers can be regarded from four main viewpoints:

* as standalone arithmetical objects,
* as combinatorial objects,
* as values of a sequence of certain polynomials,
* as values of the Riemann zeta function.

Each of these viewpoints leads to a set of more or less different conventions.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
  ''Bernoulli numbers as standalone arithmetical objects.''&lt;br&gt;
  Associated sequence: 1/6, −1/30, 1/42, −1/30,... &lt;br&gt;
  This is the viewpoint of Jakob Bernoulli.  (See the cutout from his ''Ars Conjectandi'', first edition, 1713).  The Bernoulli numbers are understood as numbers, recursive in nature, invented to solve a certain arithmetical problem, the summation of powers, which is the ''paradigmatic application'' of the Bernoulli numbers. It is misleading to call this viewpoint &amp;#39;archaic&amp;#39;. For example [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] uses it in his highly acclaimed book ''A Course in Arithmetic'' which is a standard textbook used at many universities today.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
''Bernoulli numbers as combinatorial objects.'' &lt;br&gt;
   Associated sequence: 1,&amp;nbsp;+1/2,&amp;nbsp;1/6,&amp;nbsp;0,.... &lt;br&gt;
   This view focuses on the connection between Stirling numbers and Bernoulli numbers and arises naturally in the calculus of finite differences. In its most general and compact form this connection is summarized by the definition of the ''Stirling polynomials'' σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), formula (6.52) in ''Concrete Mathematics'' by Graham, Knuth and Patashnik.

: &lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{ze^z}{e^{z}-1} \right)^x = x\sum_{n\geq0}\sigma_n (x)z^n&lt;/math&gt;

In consequence ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''! σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1) for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
   ''Bernoulli numbers as values of a sequence of certain polynomials.'' &lt;br&gt;
   Assuming the Bernoulli polynomials as already introduced
   the Bernoulli numbers can be defined in two different ways: &lt;br&gt;
   ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(0). Associated sequence: 1, −1/2, 1/6, 0,.... &lt;br&gt;
   ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1). Associated sequence: 1, +1/2, 1/6, 0,....&lt;br&gt;
   The two definitions differ only in the sign of ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. The choice ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(0) is the convention used in the ''Handbook of Mathematical Functions''.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
   ''Bernoulli numbers as values of the Riemann zeta function.'' &lt;br&gt;
   Associated sequence: 1, +1/2, 1/6, 0,....

[[Image:BernoulliNumbersByZetaLowRes.png|250px|thumb|left|The Bernoulli numbers as given by the Riemann zeta function.]]
This convention agrees with the convention ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1) (for example J. Neukirch and M. Kaneko). The sign &amp;#39;+&amp;#39; for ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; matches the representation of the Bernoulli numbers by the [[Riemann zeta function]]. In fact the identity ''n''ζ(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(−1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; valid for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 is then replaced by the simpler ''n''ζ(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. (See the paper of S. C. Woon.)&lt;br&gt;
(Note that in the foregoing equation for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 the expression −''n''ζ(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''n'') is to be understood as lim&lt;sub&gt;''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−''x''ζ(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''x'').)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
| &lt;math&gt; \ B_n = n!\sigma_{n}(1) = B_n(1) = -n\zeta(1-n)  \quad (n \geq 0) \  &lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

== Applications of the Bernoulli numbers ==
=== Asymptotic analysis ===
Arguably the most important application of the Bernoulli number in mathematics is their use in the [[Euler–MacLaurin formula]]. Assuming that ''ƒ'' is a sufficiently often differentiable function the Euler–MacLaurin formula can be written as &lt;ref&gt;''Concrete Mathematics'', (9.67).&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \sum\limits_{a\leq k&lt;b}f(k)=\int_a^b f(x)\,dx \ + \sum\limits_{k=1}^m \frac{B_k}{k!}\left(f^{(k-1)}(b)-f^{(k-1)}(a)\right)+R(f,m). &lt;/math&gt;

This formulation assumes the convention ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;minus;1/2. However, if one sets ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2 then this formula can also be written as

: &lt;math&gt; \sum\limits_{a&lt;k\leq b} f(k)=\int_a^b f(x)\,dx + \sum\limits_{k=1}^m \frac{B_k}{k!} \left(f^{(k-1)}(b)-f^{(k-1)}(a)\right)+R(f,m). \ &lt;/math&gt;

Here ''ƒ''&lt;sup&gt;(0)&lt;/sup&gt; = ''ƒ'' which is a commonly used notation identifying the zero-th derivative of ''ƒ'' with ''ƒ''. Moreover, let ''ƒ''&lt;sup&gt;(&amp;minus;1)&lt;/sup&gt; denote an [[antiderivative]] of ''ƒ''. By the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]],

: &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx\ = f^{(-1)}(b) - f^{(-1)}(a).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the last formula can be further simplified to the following succinct form of the Euler–Maclaurin formula

: &lt;math&gt; \sum\limits_{a&lt;k\leq b}f(k)= \sum\limits_{k=0}^m \frac{B_k}{k!}\left(f^{(k-1)}(b)-f^{(k-1)}(a)\right)+R(f,m). \ &lt;/math&gt;

This form is for example the source for the important Euler–MacLaurin expansion of the zeta function (B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2)

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\zeta(s) &amp; =\sum_{k=0}^m \frac{B_k}{k!} s^{\overline{k-1}} + R(s,m) \\
&amp; = \frac{B_0}{0!}s^{\overline{-1}} + \frac{B_1}{1!} s^{\overline{0}} + \frac{B_2}{2!} s^{\overline{1}} +\cdots+R(s,m) \\
&amp; =\frac{1}{s-1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{12}s + \cdots + R(s,m).
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;s^{\overline{k}}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the rising factorial power.&lt;ref&gt;''Concrete Mathematics'', (2.44) and (2.52)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernoulli numbers are also frequently used in other kinds of [[asymptotic expansion]]s.
The following example is the classical Poincaré-type asymptotic expansion of the
[[digamma function]] (again B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2).

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(z) \sim  \ln z - \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}  \frac{B_{k}}{k z^k} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Use in topology ===

The [[Kervaire–Milnor formula]] for the order of the cyclic group of diffeomorphism classes of [[exotic sphere|exotic (4''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-spheres]] which bound [[parallelizable manifold]]s involves Bernoulli numbers. Let ''ES''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be the number of such exotic spheres for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, then (see also sequence {{OEIS2C|A047680}})

:&lt;math&gt; ES_n = (2^{2n-2}-2^{4n-3}) \ \text{Numerator} \left(\frac{B_{4n}}{4n} \right) .&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Hirzebruch signature theorem#L genus and the Hirzebruch signature theorem|Hirzebruch signature theorem]] for the [[Hirzebruch signature theorem#L genus and the Hirzebruch signature theorem|L genus]] of a [[Smooth manifold|smooth]] [[Orientability|oriented]] [[closed manifold]] of [[dimension]] 4''n'' also involves Bernoulli numbers.

==Combinatorial definitions==

The connection of the Bernoulli number to various kinds of combinatorial numbers is based on the classical theory of finite differences and on the combinatorial interpretation of the Bernoulli numbers as an instance of a fundamental combinatorial principle, the [[inclusion-exclusion principle]].

=== Connection with Worpitzky numbers ===

The definition to proceed with was developed by Julius Worpitzky in 1883. Besides elementary arithmetic only the factorial function ''n''! and the power function ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; is employed. The signless Worpitzky numbers are defined as

: &lt;math&gt; W_{n,k}=\sum_{v=0}^{k}(-1)^{v+k} \left(v+1\right)^{n} \frac{k!}{v!(k-v)!}  \ . &lt;/math&gt;

They can also be expressed through the [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]]

: &lt;math&gt; W_{n,k}=k! \left\{\begin{matrix} n+1 \\ k+1 \end{matrix}\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

A Bernoulli number is then introduced as an inclusion-exclusion sum of Worpitzky numbers weighted by the sequence 1,&amp;nbsp;1/2,&amp;nbsp;1/3,...

: &lt;math&gt; B_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{k}\frac{W_{n,k}}{k+1}\ =\ \sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{1}{k+1}\sum_{v=0}^{k}(-1)^v {k \choose v} \left(v+1\right)^{n} \ . &lt;/math&gt;
This representation has ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2.

    &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1/1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1/1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1/2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1/1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3/2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2/3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1/1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;7/2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;12/3&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;6/4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1/1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;15/2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;50/3&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;60/4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;24/5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;''B''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1/1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;31/2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;180/3&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;390/4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;360/5&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;120/6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;''B''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1/1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;63/2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;602/3&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2100/4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3360/5&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2520/6&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;720/7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

A second formula representing the Bernoulli numbers by the Worpitzky numbers is for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1
: &lt;math&gt; B_{n}=\frac{n}{2^{n+1}-2}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-2)^{-k}\; W_{n-1,k}  \  . &lt;/math&gt;

=== Connection with Stirling numbers of the second kind ===

A similar combinatorial representation derives from

: &lt;math&gt; B_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}(-1)^{k+n}\frac{k!}{k+1}
\left\{\begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix}\right\} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Here the Bernoulli numbers are an inclusion-exclusion over the set of length-''n'' words, where the sum is taken over all words of length ''n'' with ''k'' distinct letters, and normalized by ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. The combinatorics of this representation can be seen from:

: &lt;math&gt; B_{0}= +\left\vert \ \left\{ \varnothing \right\} \ \right\vert &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; B_{1}= -\frac{1}{1} \left\vert \ \varnothing \ \right\vert + \frac{1}{2}\left\vert \left\{a\right\}\right\vert &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; B_{2}= +\frac{1}{1} \left\vert \ \varnothing \ \right\vert - \frac{1}{2}\left\vert \left\{aa\right\}\right\vert +\frac{1}{3}\left\vert \left\{ab,ba\right\}  \right\vert &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; B_{3}= -\frac{1}{1} \left\vert \ \varnothing \ \right\vert +\frac{1}{2}\left\vert \left\{aaa\right\}\right\vert -\frac{1}{3}\left\vert \left\{aab,aba,baa,abb,bab,bba\right\}\right\vert +\frac{1}{4}\left\vert \left\{abc,acb,bac,bca,cab,cba\right\} \right\vert &lt;/math&gt;

=== Connection with Stirling numbers of the first kind ===

The two main formulas relating the unsigned [[Stirling numbers of the first kind]] &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{matrix} n \\ m \end{matrix}\right]&lt;/math&gt; to the Bernoulli numbers (with ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2) are

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{m!}\sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^{k} \left[\begin{matrix} m+1 \\ k+1 \end{matrix}\right] B_k = \frac{1}{m+1}, &lt;/math&gt;

and the inversion of this sum (for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0, ''m''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0)

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{m!}\sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^{k} \left[\begin{matrix} m+1 \\ k+1 \end{matrix}\right] B_{n+k} = A_{n,m}. &lt;/math&gt;

Here the number ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are the rational Akiyama&amp;ndash;Tanigawa number, the first few of which are displayed in the following table.

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The Akiyama–Tanigawa numbers satisfy a simple recurrence relation which can be exploited to iteratively compute the table above.  Note that
the entries in the first column are the Bernoulli numbers ''B''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.   The following pseudo-code takes an input ''n'' and returns the ''n''th Bernoulli number ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; .

&lt;table  style=&quot;margin:auto; border:3px solid rgb(217, 222, 205);&quot;&gt;

&lt;td &gt;Akiyama&amp;ndash;Tanigawa algorithm for ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Enter integer ''n''.&lt;br /&gt;
For ''j'' from 0 by 1 to ''n'' do
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td &gt;''A''[0][''j'']&amp;nbsp;←&amp;nbsp;1/(''j''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;For ''i'' from 1 by 1 to ''n'' do
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td &gt;For ''j'' from ''0'' by 1 to (''n'' - ''i'') do&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td &gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''A''[''i''][''j'']&amp;nbsp;←&amp;nbsp;(''j''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;(''A''[''i''-1][''j'']&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''A''[''i''-1][''j''+1])&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Return ''A''[''n''][0]&amp;nbsp; (which is ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

=== Connection with Eulerian numbers ===

There are formulas connecting [[Eulerian number]]s &lt;math&gt;\left \langle {n\atop m} \right \rangle&lt;/math&gt; to Bernoulli numbers:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m {\left \langle {n\atop m} \right \rangle} = 2^{n+1}(2^{n+1}-1) \frac{B_{n+1}}{n+1},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m {\left \langle {n\atop m} \right \rangle} {\binom{n}{m}}^{-1} = (n+1) B_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Both formulas are valid for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 if ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is set to ½. If ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is set to −½ they are valid only for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2 respectively.

==A binary tree representation==
The Stirling polynomials σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') are related to the Bernoulli
numbers by B&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''!σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1).
S. C. Woon {{harv|Woon|1997}} described an algorithm to compute σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1) as a binary
tree.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;table &gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;padding: 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em; background:#D9DECD; color:red; text-align:center&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Woon's tree for σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
[[Image:SCWoonTree.png]]
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Woon's recursive algorithm (for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1) starts by assigning to the root node
''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[1,2]. Given a node ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,
''a''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;] of the tree, the left child of the node is ''L''(''N'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[&amp;minus;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;] and the right child ''R''(''N'') = [''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,2,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;].

Given a node ''N'' the ''factorial'' ''of'' ''N'' is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; N! = a_1 \prod_{k=2}^{\text{length}(N)} a_k!. &lt;/math&gt;

Restricted to the nodes ''N'' of a fixed tree-level ''n'' the sum of 1/''N''! is σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1), thus

:&lt;math&gt; B_n = \sum_{N \ \text{node of tree-level}\ n} \frac{n!}{N!}. &lt;/math&gt;

For example ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1!(1/2!), ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2!(&amp;minus;1/3!&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/(2!2!)), ''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;3!(1/4!&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1/(2!3!)&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1/(3!2!)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/(2!2!2!)).

==Asymptotic approximation==

[[Leonhard Euler]] expressed the Bernoulli numbers in terms of the [[Riemann zeta function]] as

:&lt;math&gt;B_{2n} = (-1)^{n+1}\frac {2(2n)!} {(2\pi)^{2n}} \left[1+\frac{1}{2^{2n}}+\frac{1}{3^{2n}}+\frac{1}{4^{2n}}+\cdots\;\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

It then follows from the [[Stirling formula]] that, as ''n'' goes to infinity,

: &lt;math&gt; |B_{2 n}| \sim 4 \sqrt{\pi n} \left(\frac{n}{ \pi e} \right)^{2n}. &lt;/math&gt;

Including more terms from the zeta series yields a better approximation, as does factoring in the asymptotic series in Stirling's approximation.

==Integral representation and continuation==

The [[integral]]

: &lt;math&gt; b(s) = 2e^{s i \pi/2}\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{st^{s}}{1-e^{2\pi t}} \frac{dt}{t} &lt;/math&gt;

has as special values ''b''(2''n'') = ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0.  The integral might be considered as a continuation of the Bernoulli numbers to the [[complex plane]] and this was indeed suggested by Peter Luschny in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

For example ''b''(3) = (3/2)ζ(3)Π&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;Ι and ''b''(5) = −(15/2)&amp;nbsp;''ζ''(5)&amp;nbsp;Π&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−5&lt;/sup&gt;Ι. Here ''ζ''(''n'') denotes the [[Riemann zeta function]] and Ι the [[imaginary unit]]. It is remarkable that already Leonhard Euler (''Opera Omnia'', Ser. 1, Vol. 10, p.&amp;nbsp;351) considered these numbers and calculated

: &lt;math&gt; p = \frac{3}{2\pi^3}\left(1+\frac{1}{2^3}+\frac{1}{3^3}+\text{etc.}\ \right) = 0.0581522\ldots  \ , &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; q = \frac{15}{2\pi^{5}}\left(1+\frac{1}{2^5}+\frac{1}{3^5}+\text{etc.}\ \right) = 0.0254132\ldots   \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Euler's values are unsigned and real, but obviously his aim was to find a meaningful way to define the Bernoulli numbers at the odd integers ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

==The relation to the Euler numbers and ''π'' ==

The [[Euler number]]s are a sequence of integers intimately connected with the Bernoulli numbers. Comparing the
asymptotic expansions of the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers shows that the Euler numbers ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are in magnitude approximately (2/π)(4&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) times larger than the Bernoulli numbers ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. In consequence:

: &lt;math&gt; \pi \  \sim \  2 \left(2^{2n} - 4^{2n} \right) \frac{B_{2n}}{E_{2n}}. &lt;/math&gt;

This asymptotic equation reveals that ''π'' lies in the common root of both the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers.  In fact ''π'' could be computed from these rational approximations.

Bernoulli numbers can be expressed through the Euler numbers and vice versa. Since for ''n'' odd ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; =&amp;nbsp;0 (with the exception ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), it suffices to consider the case when ''n'' is even.

: &lt;math&gt; B_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\binom{n-1}{k} \frac{n}{4^n-2^n}E_k \quad (n=2,4,6,\ldots) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; E_{n}=\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k-1} \frac{2^k-4^k}{k} B_k \quad (n=2,4,6,\ldots). &lt;/math&gt;

These conversion formulas express an [[inverse relation]] between the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers. But more important, there is a deep arithmetic root common to both kinds of numbers, which can be expressed through a more fundamental sequence of numbers, also closely tied to ''π''. These numbers are defined for ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 as

: &lt;math&gt; S_n = 2 \left(\frac{2}{\pi}\right)^{n}\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty \left(4k+1\right)^{-n} \quad (k=0,-1,1,-2,2,\ldots) &lt;/math&gt;

and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 by convention {{harv|Elkies|2003}}. The magic of these numbers lies in the fact that they turn out to be rational numbers.  This was first proved by [[Leonhard Euler]] in a landmark paper {{harv|Euler|1735}} ''‘De summis serierum reciprocarum’'' (On the sums of series of reciprocals) and has fascinated mathematicians ever since. The first few of these numbers are

: &lt;math&gt; S_n = 1,1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\frac{5}{24}, \frac{2}{15},\frac{61}{720},\frac{17}{315},\frac{277}{8064},\frac{62}{2835},\ldots  &lt;/math&gt;

The Bernoulli numbers and Euler numbers are best understood as ''special views'' of these numbers, selected from the sequence ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and scaled for use in special applications.

: &lt;math&gt; B_{n}  =(-1)^{\left\lfloor n/2\right\rfloor }\left[ n\ \operatorname{even}\right] \frac{n! }{2^n-4^n}\, S_{n}\ , \quad (n=2,3,\ldots) \ , &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; E_{n}  =(-1)^{\left\lfloor n/2\right\rfloor }\left[ n\ \operatorname{even}\right] n! \, S_{n+1}  \quad\qquad (n=0,1,\ldots). &lt;/math&gt;

The expression [''n'' even] has the value 1 if ''n'' is even and 0 otherwise ([[Iverson bracket]]).

These identities show that the quotient of Bernoulli and Euler numbers at the beginning of this section is just the special case of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; when ''n'' is even. The ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are rational approximations to ''π'' and two successive terms always enclose the true value of ''π''. Beginning with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 the sequence starts

: &lt;math&gt; 2, 4, 3, \frac{16}{5}, \frac{25}{8}, \frac{192}{61}, \frac{427}{136}, \frac{4352}{1385},\ldots \quad \longrightarrow \pi. &lt;/math&gt;

These rational numbers also appear in the last paragraph of Euler's paper cited above. But it was only in September 2007 that this classical sequence found its way into the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences {{OEIS2C|A132049}}.

==An algorithmic view: the Seidel triangle==

The sequence ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has another unexpected yet important property: The denominators of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; divide the factorial (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;. In other words: the numbers ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)! are integers.

: &lt;math&gt; T_{n} = 1,1,1,2,5,16,61,272,1385,7936,50521,353792,\ldots \quad (n=1,2,\ldots) &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the above representations of the Bernoulli and Euler numbers can be rewritten in terms of this sequence as

: &lt;math&gt; B_{n} =(-1)^{\left\lfloor n/2\right\rfloor }\left[ n\text{ even}\right] \frac{n }{2^n-4^n}\, T_{n}\ , \quad (n=2,3,\ldots) \ , &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; E_{n} =(-1)^{\left\lfloor n/2\right\rfloor }\left[ n\text{ even}\right] T_{n+1} \quad\quad\qquad(n=0,1,\ldots) \ . &lt;/math&gt;

These identities make it easy to compute the Bernoulli and Euler numbers: the Euler numbers ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are given immediately by ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the Bernoulli numbers ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are obtained from ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; by some easy shifting, avoiding rational arithmetic.

What remains is to find a convenient way to compute the numbers ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. However, already in 1877 [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel]] {{harv|Seidel|1877}} published an ingenious algorithm which makes it extremely simple to calculate ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;table &gt;
&lt;tr style=&quot;padding: 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em; background:#D9DECD; color:red; text-align:center&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Seidel's algorithm for T&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
[[Image:SeidelAlgorithmForTn.png]]
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

[begin] Start by putting 1 in row 0 and let ''k'' denote the number of the row currently being filled. If ''k'' is odd, then put the number on the left end of the row ''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 in the first position of the row ''k'', and fill the row from the left to the right, with every entry being the sum of the number to the left and the number to the upper. At the end of the row duplicate the last number. If ''k'' is even, proceed similar in the other direction. [end]

Seidel's algorithm is in fact much more general (see the exposition of Dominique Dumont {{harv|Dumont|1981}}) and was rediscovered several times thereafter.

Similar to Seidel's approach D. E. Knuth and T. J. Buckholtz {{harv|Knuth|Buckholtz|1967}} gave a recurrence equation for the numbers ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and recommended this method for computing ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ‘on electronic computers using only simple operations on integers’.

V. I. Arnold rediscovered Seidel's algorithm in {{harv|Arnold|1991}} and later Millar, Sloane and Young popularized Seidel's algorithm under the name [[boustrophedon transform]].

==A combinatorial view: alternating permutations==
{{main|Alternating permutations}}

Around 1880, three years after the publication of Seidel's algorithm, [[Désiré André]] proved a now classic result of combinatorial analysis {{harv|André|1879}} &amp; {{harv|André|1881}}. Looking at the first terms of the Taylor expansion of the [[trigonometric functions]]
tan ''x'' and sec ''x'' André made a startling discovery.

: &lt;math&gt; \tan x = 1\frac{x}{1!} + 2\frac{x^3}{3!} + 16\frac{x^5}{5!} + 272\frac{x^7}{7!} + 7936\frac{x^9}{9!} + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \sec x = 1 + 1\frac{x^2}{2!} + 5\frac{x^4}{4!} + 61\frac{x^6}{6!} + 1385\frac{x^8}{8!} + 50521\frac{x^{10}}{10!} + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients are the Euler numbers of odd and even index, respectively. In consequence the ordinary expansion of tan&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;sec&amp;nbsp;''x'' has as coefficients the rational numbers ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt; \tan x + \sec x = 1 + 1x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x^3 + \frac{5}{24}x^4 + \frac{2}{15}x^5 + \frac{61}{720}x^6 + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

André then succeeded by means of a recurrence argument to show that the [[alternating permutations]] of odd size are enumerated by the Euler numbers of odd index (also called tangent numbers) and the alternating permutations of even size by the Euler numbers of even index (also called secant numbers).

==Generalizations by polynomials==

The [[Bernoulli polynomials]] can be regarded as generalizations of the Bernoulli numbers the same as the Euler polynomials are generalizations of the Euler numbers.

==Arithmetical properties of the Bernoulli numbers==

The Bernoulli numbers can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function as ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = − ''n''ζ(1 − ''n'') for integers ''n'' ≥ 0 provided for ''n'' = 0 and ''n'' = 1 the expression − ''n''ζ(1 − ''n'') is understood as the limiting value and the convention B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2 is used. This intimately relates them to the values of the zeta function at negative integers. As such, they could be expected to have and do have deep arithmetical properties. For example, the [[Agoh&amp;ndash;Giuga conjecture]] postulates that ''p'' is a prime number if and only if ''pB''&lt;sub&gt;''p''−1&lt;/sub&gt; is congruent to −1 modulo ''p''. Divisibility properties of the Bernoulli numbers are related to the [[ideal class group]]s of [[cyclotomic field]]s by a theorem of Kummer and its strengthening in the [[Herbrand-Ribet theorem]], and to class numbers of real quadratic fields by [[Ankeny&amp;ndash;Artin&amp;ndash;Chowla congruence|Ankeny&amp;ndash;Artin&amp;ndash;Chowla]].

=== The Kummer theorems ===

The Bernoulli numbers are related to [[Fermat's last theorem]] (FLT) by [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]]'s theorem {{harv|Kummer|1850}}, which says:

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;If the odd prime ''p'' does not divide any of the numerators of the Bernoulli numbers ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&amp;minus;3&lt;/sub&gt; then ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 has no solutions in non-zero integers.&lt;/p&gt;

Prime numbers with this property are called [[regular prime]]s ({{OEIS2C|A007703}}, {{OEIS2C|A000928}}). Another classical result of Kummer {{harv|Kummer|1851}} are the following [[Modular arithmetic#Congruence relation|congruences]].

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;Let ''p'' be an odd prime and ''b'' an even number such that ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 does not divide&amp;nbsp;''b''. Then for any non-negative integer&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;/p&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; \frac{B_{k(p-1)+b}}{k(p-1)+b}\ \equiv \ \frac{B_{b}}{b} \pmod{p}. &lt;/math&gt;

A generalization of these congruences goes by the name of ''p''-adic continuity.

===''p''-adic continuity===

If ''b'', ''m'' and ''n'' are positive integers such that ''m'' and ''n'' are not divisible by ''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m \equiv n\pmod{p^{b-1}(p-1)}&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;(1-p^{m-1}){B_m \over m} \equiv (1-p^{n-1}){B_n \over n} \pmod{p^b}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = —''n'' ζ(1 — ''n''), this can also be written

:&lt;math&gt;(1-p^{-u})\zeta(u) \equiv (1-p^{-v})\zeta(v) \pmod{p^b},~&lt;/math&gt;

where ''u'' =&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'' and ''v'' =&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''n'', so that ''u'' and ''v'' are nonpositive and not congruent to 1 modulo ''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. This tells us that the Riemann zeta function, with 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;−''s''&lt;/sup&gt; taken out of the Euler product formula, is continuous in the [[p-adic number]]s on odd negative integers congruent modulo ''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 to a particular &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a \not \equiv 1\pmod{p-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and so can be extended to a continuous function ζ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(s) for all ''p''-adic integers &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Bbb{Z}_p\,&lt;/math&gt;, the [[p-adic zeta function]].

=== Ramanujan's congruences ===

The following relations, due to [[Ramanujan]], provide a more efficient method for calculating Bernoulli numbers:

:&lt;math&gt;{{m+3}\choose{m}}B_m=\begin{cases} {{m+3}\over3}-\sum\limits_{j=1}^{m/6}{m+3\choose{m-6j}}B_{m-6j}, &amp; \mbox{if}\ m\equiv 0\pmod{6};\\
{{m+3}\over3}-\sum\limits_{j=1}^{(m-2)/6}{m+3\choose{m-6j}}B_{m-6j}, &amp; \mbox{if}\ m\equiv 2\pmod{6};\\
-{{m+3}\over6}-\sum\limits_{j=1}^{(m-4)/6}{m+3\choose{m-6j}}B_{m-6j}, &amp; \mbox{if}\ m\equiv 4\pmod{6}.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Von Staudt–Clausen theorem ===

{{main|Von Staudt–Clausen theorem}}

The [[von Staudt–Clausen theorem]] was given by [[Karl Georg Christian von Staudt]] {{harv|von Staudt|1840}} and [[Thomas Clausen (mathematician)|Thomas Clausen]] {{harv|Clausen|1840}} independently in 1840. The theorem affirms the existence of a number ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. which is either an integer or {{frac|1|2}}, such that

: &lt;math&gt; B_n = I_n - \sum_{(p-1)|n} \frac1p \quad (n\geq0). &lt;/math&gt;

The sum is over the primes ''p'' for which ''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 divides ''n''. These are the same primes which are employed in the Clausen algorithm. The proposition holds true for ''all'' ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, not only for even ''n''. ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and for odd ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;1, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{frac|1|2}} (and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''2n''&lt;/sub&gt; is always an integer).

A consequence of the von Staudt–Clausen theorem is: the denominators of the Bernoulli numbers are square-free and for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2 divisible by&amp;nbsp;6.

=== Why do the odd Bernoulli numbers vanish? ===
The sum

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_k(n) = \sum_{i=0}^n i^k - \frac{n^k}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

can be evaluated for negative values of the index ''n''. Doing so will show that it is an [[odd function]] for even values of ''k'', which implies that the  sum has only terms of odd index. This and the formula for the Bernoulli sum imply that ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''k''+1−''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is 0 for ''m'' odd and greater than 1; and that the term for ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is cancelled by the subtraction.  The von&amp;nbsp;Staudt&amp;nbsp;Clausen theorem combined with Worpitzky's representation also gives a combinatorial answer to this question (valid for ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;1).

From the von Staudt&amp;nbsp;Clausen theorem it is known that for odd ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;1 the number 2''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is an integer. This seems trivial if one knows beforehand that in this case ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. However, by applying Worpitzky's representation one gets

: &lt;math&gt; 2B_n =\sum_{m=0}^n \left(-1\right)^m \frac{2}{m+1}m!
\left\{\begin{matrix} n+1 \\ m+1 \end{matrix}\right\}
=0\quad\left(n&gt;1\ \text{is odd}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

as a ''sum of integers'', which is not trivial. Here a combinatorial fact comes to surface which explains the vanishing of the Bernoulli numbers at odd index. Let ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt; be the number of surjective maps from {1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''} to {1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''m''}, then &lt;math&gt;S_{n,m}=m! \left\{\begin{matrix} n \\ m \end{matrix}\right\} &lt;/math&gt;. The last equation can only hold if

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{m=1,3,5,\ldots\leq n}\frac{2}{m^{2}}S_{n,m}=\sum_{m=2,4,6,\ldots\leq n} \frac{2}{m^{2}} S_{n,m} \quad \left(n&gt;2\ \text{is even}\right).\ &lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be proved by induction. The first two examples of this equation are

:''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4:&amp;nbsp; 2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;
:''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6:&amp;nbsp; 2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;120&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;144&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;31&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;195&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;40.

Thus the Bernoulli numbers vanish at odd index because some non-obvious combinatorial identities are embodied in the Bernoulli numbers.

=== A restatement of the Riemann hypothesis ===

The connection between the Bernoulli numbers and the Riemann zeta function is strong enough to provide an alternate formulation of the [[Riemann hypothesis]] (RH) which uses only the Bernoulli number. In fact [[Marcel Riesz]] {{harv|Riesz|1916}} proved that the RH is equivalent to the following assertion:

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:32px&quot;&gt;For every ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1/4 there exists a constant ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''ε''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 (depending on ''ε'') such that |''R''(''x'')|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''C''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;ε&lt;/sup&gt; as ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞.&lt;/p&gt;

Here ''R''(''x'') is the [[Riesz function]]

: &lt;math&gt; R(x) = 2 \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}
\frac{k^{\overline{k}} x^{k}}{(2\pi)^{2k}\left(B_{2k}/(2k)\right)}
= 2\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{k^{\overline{k}}x^{k}}{(2\pi)^{2k}\beta_{2k}}. \ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;n^{\overline{k}}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Pochhammer symbol#Alternate notations|rising factorial power]] in the notation of [[D. E. Knuth]]. The number ''β''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;/''n'' occur frequently in the study of the zeta function and are significant  because ''β''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a ''p''-integer for primes ''p'' where ''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 does not divide ''n''.  The ''β''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are called ''divided Bernoulli number''.

==History==
=== Early history ===

The Bernoulli numbers are rooted in the early history of the computation of sums of integer powers, which have been of interest to mathematicians since antiquity.

[[Image:Seki Kowa Katsuyo Sampo Bernoulli numbers.png|thumb|right|180px|A page from Seki Kōwa's ''Katsuyo Sampo'' (1712), tabulating binomial coefficients and Bernoulli numbers]]

Methods to calculate the sum of the first ''n'' positive integers, the sum of the squares and of the cubes of the first ''n'' positive integers were known, but there were no real 'formulas', only descriptions given entirely in words. Among the great mathematicians of antiquity which considered this problem were: [[Pythagoras]] (c. 572&amp;ndash;497 BCE, Greece), [[Archimedes]] (287&amp;ndash;212 BCE, Italy), [[Aryabhata]] (b. 476, India), [[Abu Bakr al-Karaji]] (d. 1019, Persia) and Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Hasan ibn [[al-Haytham]] (965&amp;ndash;1039, Egypt).

During the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries mathematicians made significant progress.  In the West [[Thomas Harriot]] (1560&amp;ndash;1621) of England, [[Johann Faulhaber]] (1580&amp;ndash;1635) of Germany, [[Pierre de Fermat]] (1601&amp;ndash;1665) and fellow French mathematician [[Blaise Pascal]] (1623&amp;ndash;1662) all played important roles.

Thomas Harriot seems to have been the first to derive and write formulas for sums of powers using symbolic notation, but even he calculated only up to the sum of the fourth powers.  Johann Faulhaber gave formulas for sums of powers up to the 17th power in his 1631 ''Academia Algebrae'', far higher than anyone before him, but he did not give a general formula.

The Swiss mathematician Jakob Bernoulli (1654&amp;ndash;1705) was the first to realize the existence of a single sequence of constants ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;... which provide a uniform formula for all sums of powers {{harv|Knuth|1993}}.

The joy Bernoulli experienced when he hit upon the pattern needed to compute quickly and easily the coefficients of his formula for the sum of the ''c''-th powers for any positive integer ''c'' can be seen from his comment. He wrote:

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:40px&quot;&gt;“With the help of this table, it took me less than half of a quarter of an hour to find that the tenth powers of the first 1000 numbers being added together will yield the sum&lt;br&gt;
91,409,924,241,424,243,424,241,924,242,500.”&lt;/p&gt;

Bernoulli's result was published posthumously in ''[[Ars Conjectandi]]'' in 1713.  [[Seki Kōwa]] independently discovered the Bernoulli numbers and his result was published a year earlier, also posthumously, in 1712.&lt;ref name=&quot;selin 1997&quot;/&gt;  However, Seki did not present his method as a formula based on a sequence of constants.

Bernoulli's formula for sums of powers is the most useful and generalizable formulation to date. The coefficients in Bernoulli's formula are now called Bernoulli numbers, following a suggestion of [[Abraham de Moivre]].

Bernoulli's formula is sometimes called [[Faulhaber's formula]] after Johann Faulhaber who found remarkable ways to calculate sum of powers but never stated Bernoulli's formula. To call Bernoulli's formula Faulhaber's formula does injustice to Bernoulli and simultaneously hides the genius of Faulhaber as Faulhaber's formula is in fact more efficient than Bernoulli's formula. According to Knuth {{harv|Knuth|1993}} a rigorous proof of Faulhaber’s formula was first published by [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Carl Jacobi]] in 1834 {{harv|Jacobi|1834}}.  Donald E. Knuth's in-depth study of Faulhaber's formula concludes:

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:20px; font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;
“Faulhaber never discovered the Bernoulli numbers; i.e., he never realized that a single sequence of constants ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... would provide a uniform&lt;/p&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt; \quad \sum n^m = \frac 1{m+1}\left( B_0n^{m+1}-\binom{m+1}1B_1n^m+\binom{m+1} 2B_2n^{m-1}-\cdots +(-1)^m\binom{m+1}mB_mn\right) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:20px; font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;for all sums of powers. He never mentioned, for example, the fact that almost half of the coefficients turned out to be zero after he had converted his formulas for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sum n^m &lt;/math&gt; from polynomials in ''N'' to polynomials in ''n''.”  {{harv|Knuth|1993|p=14}}&lt;/p&gt;

=== Reconstruction of 'Summae Potestatum' ===

[[Image:JakobBernoulliSummaePotestatum.png|thumb|right|180px|Jakob Bernoulli's ''Summae Potestatum'', 1713]]

The Bernoulli numbers were introduced by Jakob Bernoulli in the book ''[[Ars Conjectandi]]'' published posthumously in 1713. The main formula can be seen in the second half of the corresponding facsimile. The constant coefficients denoted ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' by Bernoulli are mapped to the notation which is now prevalent as ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, ''D''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. In the expression ''c''·''c''−1·''c''−2·''c''−3 the small dots are used as grouping symbols, not as signs for multiplication. Using today's terminology these expressions are falling factorial powers &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c^{\underline{k}}&lt;/math&gt;. The factorial notation ''k''! as a shortcut for 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''k'' was not introduced until 100 years later. The integral symbol on the left hand side goes back to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1675 who used it as a long letter ''S'' for &quot;summa&quot; (sum). (The ''Mathematics Genealogy Project'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/ Mathematics Genealogy Project]&lt;/ref&gt;
shows Leibniz as the doctoral adviser of Jakob Bernoulli. See also the ''Earliest Uses of Symbols of Calculus''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeff560.tripod.com/calculus.html Earliest Uses of Symbols of Calculus]&lt;/ref&gt;) The letter ''n'' on the left hand side is not an index of [[summation]] but gives the upper limit of the range of summation which is to be understood as 1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''n''. Putting things together, for positive ''c'', today a mathematician is likely to write Bernoulli's formula as:

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{0 &lt; k \leq n} k^{c} = \frac{n^{c+1}}{c+1}+\frac{1}{2}n^c+\sum_{k \geq 2}\frac{B_{k}}{k!}c^{\underline{k-1}}n^{c-k+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

In fact this formula imperatively suggests to set ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ½ when switching from the so-called 'archaic' enumeration which uses only the even indices 2, 4, … to the modern form (more on different conventions in the next paragraph). Most striking in this context is the fact that the [[falling factorial]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c^{\underline{k-1}}&lt;/math&gt; has for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 the value &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{1}{c+1}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Thus Bernoulli's formula can and has to be written:
: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{0 &lt; k \leq n} k^{c} = \sum_{k \geq 0}\frac{B_{k}}{k!}c^{\underline{k-1}}n^{c-k+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; stands for the value Bernoulli himself has given to the coefficient at that position.

==&lt;span id=&quot;Generalized Bernoulli numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Generalized Bernoulli numbers==
The '''generalized Bernoulli numbers''' are certain [[algebraic number]]s, defined similarly to the Bernoulli numbers, that are related to [[Special values of L-functions|special values]] of [[Dirichlet L-function|Dirichlet ''L''-functions]] in the same way that Bernoulli numbers are related to special values of the Riemann zeta function.

Let χ be a [[primitive Dirichlet character]] modulo ''f''. The generalized Bernoulli numbers attached to χ are defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{a=1}^f\chi(a)\frac{te^{at}}{e^{ft}-1}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty B_{k,\chi}\frac{t^k}{k!}.&lt;/math&gt;
Let ε&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{0,&amp;nbsp;1} be defined by χ(&amp;minus;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;ε&lt;/sup&gt;. Then,
:''B&lt;sub&gt;k'',χ&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 if, and only if, {{nowrap|''k'' ≡ ε (mod 2)}}.

Generalizing the relation between Bernoulli numbers and values of the Riemann zeta function at non-positive integers, one has the for all integers ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1
:&lt;math&gt;L(1-k,\chi)=-\frac{B_{k,\chi}}{k},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''L''(''s'',&amp;nbsp;χ) is the Dirichlet ''L''-function of χ.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neukirch|1999|loc=§VII.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assorted identities ===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
A compact form of Bernoulli's formula makes use of an abstract symbol '''B''':

:&lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = {1\over{m+1}} [(\mathbf{B} + n)^{m+1} - B_{m+1}] &lt;/math&gt;

where the symbol &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}^k&lt;/math&gt; that appears during binomial expansion of the parenthesized term is to be replaced by the Bernoulli number &lt;math&gt;B_k&lt;/math&gt; (and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle B_1 = -{1\over 2}&lt;/math&gt;).   More suggestively and mnemonically, this may be written as a definite integral:

:&lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = \int_0^n (\mathbf{B}+x)^m\,dx &lt;/math&gt;

Many other Bernoulli identities can be written compactly with this symbol, e.g.

:&lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{B} + 1)^m  = (2 - 2^m) B_m  &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;li&gt;

Let ''n'' be non-negative and even

:&lt;math&gt; \zeta(n) = \frac{\left(-1\right)^{\frac{n}{2}-1}B_n\left(2\pi\right)^n}{2(n!)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The ''n''th [[cumulant]] of the [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] [[probability distribution]] on the interval [−1,&amp;nbsp;0] is ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;/''n''.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Let ''n''¡ = 1/''n''! and ''n'' ≥ 1.
Then ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the following determinant:

&lt;table&gt;

    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;3¡&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;2¡&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;1¡&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;''n''¡&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)¡&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;3¡&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;2¡&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;1¡&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)¡&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;''n''¡&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)¡&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;3¡&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;2¡&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Thus the determinant is σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1), the [[Stirling polynomial]] at ''x'' = 1.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
For even-numbered Bernoulli numbers, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is given by the ''p X p'' determinant:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1103.1585 |author1=Jerome Malenfant |title=Finite, closed-form expressions for the partition function and for Euler, Bernoulli, and Stirling numbers |class=math.NT |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Let ''n'' ≥ 1.

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k}B_k B_{n-k}+B_{n-1}=-B_n \quad \text{(L. Euler)} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

Let ''n'' ≥ 1.  Then {{harv|von Ettingshausen|1827}}

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n+1}{k}(n+k+1)B_{n+k}=0 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;

Let ''n'' ≥ 0.  Then ([[Leopold Kronecker]] 1883)

: &lt;math&gt; B_n = - \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} \frac{(-1)^k}{k} \binom{n+1}{k} \sum_{j=1}^{k} j^n &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

Let ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 and ''m''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1.  Then {{harv|Carlitz|1968}}

: &lt;math&gt; (-1)^{m}\sum_{r=0}^m \binom{m}{r}B_{n+r}=(-1)^{n}\sum_{s=0}^{n}\binom{n}{s}B_{m+s} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;

Let ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;4 and

: &lt;math&gt; H_{n}=\sum_{1\leq k\leq n}k^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;

the [[harmonic number]]. Then

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{n}{2}\sum_{k=2}^{n-2}\frac{B_{n-k}}{n-k}\frac{B_k}{k} - \sum_{k=2}^{n-2} \binom{n}{k}\frac{B_{n-k}}{n-k}B_{k}=H_{n}B_n \qquad\text{(H. Miki, 1978)} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;

Let ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;4. Yuri [[Matiyasevich]] found (1997)

: &lt;math&gt; (n+2)\sum_{k=2}^{n-2}B_k B_{n-k}-2\sum_{l=2}^{n-2}\binom{n+2}{l} B_l B_{n-l}=n(n+1)B_n &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;

Let ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{n}{2}\left(B_{n-1}(x)+\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{B_{k}(x)}{k}
\frac{B_{n-k}(x)}{n-k}\right) -\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\binom{n}{k}\frac{B_{n-k}}
{n-k}B_{k}(x)=H_{n-1}B_{n}(x) &lt;/math&gt;

This is an identity by ''Faber-Pandharipande-[[Zagier]]-Gessel.''  Choose ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 or ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 to get a Bernoulli number identity according  to your favourite convention.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
The next formula is true for ''n'' ≥ 0 if ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(1) = 1/2, but only for ''n'' ≥ 1 if ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(0) = &amp;minus;1/2.

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k} \frac{B_{k}}{n-k+2} = \frac{B_{n+1}}{n+1} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Let ''n'' ≥ 0 and [''b''] = 1 if ''b'' is true, 0 otherwise.

:&lt;math&gt; -1 + \sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k} \frac{2^{n-k+1}}{n-k+1}B_{k}(1) = 2^n &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; -1 + \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \frac{2^{n-k+1}}{n-k+1}B_{k}(0) = [n=0] &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Values of the Bernoulli numbers ===

''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 for all odd ''n'' other than 1. ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2 or −1/2 depending on the convention adopted (see above). The first few non-zero Bernoulli numbers (sequences {{OEIS2C|A027641}} and {{OEIS2C|A027642}} in [[OEIS]]) are listed below.

{{Nihongo|'''''Bubble Bobble'''''|バブルボブル|Baburu Boburu}} is an [[arcade game]] by [[Taito Corporation|Taito]], first released in 1986 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7222 |title=Bubble Bobble Video Game by Taito (1986)| publisher=klov.com|accessdate=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[porting|ported]] to numerous [[home computer]]s and [[Video game console|game console]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/bubble-bobble-games |title=Bubble Bobble Games| publisher=mobygames.com|accessdate=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game, starring the twin Bubble Dragons {{nihongo|'''Bub''' ''(Bubblun)''|バブルン|Baburun}} and {{nihongo|'''Bob''' ''(Bobblun)''|ボブルン|Boburun}}, is an action-platform game in which players travel through one hundred different stages, blowing and bursting [[Liquid bubble|bubbles]], avoiding enemies and collecting a variety of items.  The game became very popular and led to a long series of sequels and spin-offs. The main goal of the game is to rescue Bub and Bob's girlfriends from monsters. It is also notable for being an early example of a game with [[multiple endings]], which depended on the player's skill and discovering secrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{KLOV game|7224|Bubble Bobble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate Character Names==
(Both names are correct, based on the fact that these names appear in the game itself.)

Bub (Bubby); Bob (Bobby)
Patty; Betty.

==Game mechanics==
In the game, each player controls one of the two Bubble Dragons, Bub and Bob. The player can move along platforms, as well as jump to those above and to the side, similar to most platform games.

The player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. The bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated.

Enemies turn &quot;angry&quot;&amp;nbsp;– becoming pink-colored and moving faster&amp;nbsp;– if they are the last enemy remaining, escape from a bubble after being left too long, or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level. A monster will also become angry if either player collects a skull (the only negative item in the game), and the monster is hit by the resulting comet crossing the screen. However, this is a rare occurrence.

After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These do not need to be defeated to complete the level, and disappear once a player's life is lost.

Contact with enemies and their projectiles (rocks, lasers, fireballs, etc.) is deadly, resulting in the loss of a life.

The game's music was written by Japanese team [[Zuntata]]. Peter Clarke, [[Tim Follin]] and [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]] have arranged music for home computer ports (some versions have a new intro music by Whittaker).

==Ports==
{{Prose|section|date=April 2010}}
The popularity of ''Bubble Bobble'' led Taito (or its licensees) to [[porting|port]] to many [[home computer]]s and [[video game console]]s. Ports of the game were released for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[MSX]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Sharp X68000]], [[Personal computer|PC]] ([[MS-DOS]], 1989 and 1996), [[Apple II series|Apple II]], [[FM Towns Marty]], [[Sega Master System]], [[Game Boy]], [[Game Boy Color]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Family Computer Disk System|Famicom Disk System]], [[Sega Game Gear]], [[mobile phone]] ([[Sprint Nextel|Sprint PCS]]), [[Texas Instruments]] [[TI-83|TI-8x series]] of calculators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwedit.org/bubblebobble/ |title=Bubble Bobble 8x |accessdate=2009-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[UltraCade Technologies|UltraCade]]'s Taito Arcade Classics. A version also exists for the [[BBC Micro]] on [[public domain]] though never officially released. The original [[Sega Master System]] version was more or less the same as the other ports, but featured two hundred different stages with different boss fights.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In 1996 [[Taito Corporation|Taito]] announced that they lost the original source code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=bubble-bobble&amp;page=detail&amp;id=343 |title=Bubble Bobble video game, Taito Corp. (1986)| publisher=arcade-history.com|accessdate=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Acclaim Cheltenham|Probe Entertainment]] was in charge of the home conversions, [[Taito Corporation|Taito]] sent them a ''Bubble Bobble'' [[arcade game|arcade]] [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] so they could play the original game and reproduce its mechanics. This led to the  release of ''Bubble Bobble also featuring [[Rainbow Islands]]'' for [[Saturn]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] ([[MS-DOS]]) in 1996.

The original [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Boy Color]] versions have a Moon Water storyline, and are known as ''Bubble Bobble'', and ''Classic Bubble Bobble'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Bubble_Bobble |title=Bubble Bobble StrategyWiki| publisher=strategywiki.com|accessdate=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] version for the [[TI-83 series|TI-83]] [[graphing calculator]] was released.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dwedit.org/bubblebobble/&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Computing_platform requirements| OS_name=TI-83&amp;4 series| CPU_name=Zilog Z80| this_software_genre=games}}

In October 2005, a version was released for the [[Xbox]], [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Personal computer|PC]] as part of the ''[[Taito Legends]]'' compilation of [[retrogaming|classic arcade games]].

At the end of 2006 a new port for mobile phones in Europe and Japan was released.

On December 31, 2007, the NES version of Bubble Bobble was released on Nintendo's [[Virtual Console]] service for the [[Wii]]. It costs 500 [[Nintendo Points|Wii Points]], the equivalent of [[United States dollar|US$]]5.

==Reception==
''[[Mean Machines]]'' gave the Game Boy port of the game a score of 91%, noting that while some changes had been made the game played identical to the original arcade port and &quot;provides much addiction and challenge&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rignall |first=Julian |authorlink=Julian Rignall |year=1992 |month=August |title=Bubble Bobble review |journal=[[Mean Machines]] |issue=23 |url=http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/review/386/bubble-bobble.php |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the partnership [[card game]] [[contract bridge]], the '''Blackwood convention''' is a popular [[convention (bridge)|bidding convention]] that was developed by [[Easley Blackwood Sr.|Easley Blackwood]]. It is used to explore the partnership's possession of aces, kings and in some variants, the queen of [[trumps]], in order to judge more precisely whether [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#slam|slam]] is likely to be a good contract.

Two versions of Blackwood are common: &quot;standard&quot; Blackwood, developed by Easley, and &quot;Roman key card&quot; or &quot;RKC&quot; Blackwood, named for the Italian team who invented it. Standard Blackwood enables one partner to count partnership aces and kings in general. &quot;Keycard&quot; variants are defined by a particular &quot;key&quot; suit and enable counting the trump king and queen, as well as aces and kings. Both versions are initiated by a bid of four notrump (4NT), and the entire family of conventions may be called ''Blackwood 4NT'' in both versions, or ''Keycard 4NT'' in the one version.

There are other 4NT conventions, such as [[Norman four notrump]], but almost all bridge partnerships deploy some member of the Blackwood family as part of their slam-investigation methods.

If the partnership's preceding call was a natural bid in notrump, then 4NT is also natural. Over an opposing pass it is simply a raise and a &quot;quantitative&quot; invitation to six notrump, a small slam. Over a four of a suit it is likely to be a competitive raise, expecting to play four notrump. Those natural interpretations may hold in other auctions where the partnership has previously bid notrump naturally or shown a balanced hand conventionally. In some situations where 4NT is a quantitative invitation, especially where 4{{Clubs}} is a jump, many partnerships use the [[Gerber convention]] by some analogy to the Blackwood family: 4{{Clubs}} asks for the number of aces or key cards.

Where both sides are bidding, 4NT is likely to be a conventional takeout asking partner to help choose one of two or three suits, similar to a lower-level takeout double or cue reply to a double.
&lt;!-- Perhaps the theme of the last two paragraphs should be covered in a section below: when 4NT is not Blackwood --&gt;

==Standard Blackwood==
Where standard Blackwood 4NT is in force, a four notrump bid (4NT) asks partner to give the number of aces in his or her hand. With no aces or four, partner replies 5{{Clubs}}; with one, two, or three aces, 5{{Diams}}, 5{{Hearts}}, or 5{{Spades}}. The difference between no aces and four is clear to the Blackwood bidder (unless the partnership lacks all four) so one member of the partnership knows the combined number of aces. That is often sufficient to set the final contract.

The continuation bid of 5NT asks for the number of kings according to the same code of replies at the six-level: {{Clubs}}6 shows no kings or four, etc. Asking for the number of kings confirms that the partnership holds all four aces, so partner may reply at the seven level with expectation of taking thirteen tricks. (A common agreement is that when spades is not the trump suit, 5♠ asks respondent to bid 5NT. That is useful when the reply to 4NT surpasses the intended trump suit but also shows that slam is likely to be a poor contract because two aces are missing.) 

A void may be as good as an ace in some situations but it should not be counted as an ace. Some experts (Kantar for one{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}) recommend the 5NT reply to 4NT &amp;ndash; the cheapest with no standardly assigned meaning &amp;ndash; to show a void plus two aces and six of a suit to show a void in the bid suit plus one ace.

==Roman Key Card Blackwood (RKCB)==
Roman Key Card Blackwood (RKCB) has largely replaced the standard version among tournament players. It developed from the ''Roman Blackwood'' variant (see below). According to RKCB there are five equivalent keycards rather than four aces; the trump king is counted as one. The key-card replies to 4NT are more compressed than standard ones and they also begin to locate the queen of trumps.

{|
|5{{Clubs}}||– 0 or 3 key cards
|-
|5{{Diams}}||– 1 or 4 key cards
|-
|5{{Hearts}}||– 2 or 5 cards without the trump queen
|-
|5{{Spades}}||– 2 or 5 key cards with the trump queen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = William S.|last1= Root |first2 = Richard |last2 = Pavlicek | year = 1981 | title = Modern Bridge Conventions | publisher = Crown Trade Paperbacks | isbn=0-517-58727-0|page = 236}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
&lt;!-- 1430 doesn't belong here --&gt;
Although the replies to 4NT are more compressed, it is almost always possible to infer which number of keycards is factual: 0 or 3, 1 or 4, 2 or 5. Evidence for that inference includes the entire auction as well as the number of key cards that the convention initiator holds.

The 5{{Hearts}} and 5{{Spades}} replies with 2 of 5 key cards also deny and show the trump queen respectively. (Respondent may also show the queen with extra length in trumps, where the ace and king will probably draw all outstanding cards in the suit.)

The 5{{Clubs}} and 5{{Diams}} replies tell nothing about the queen or extra length, but the 4NT bidder may ask about that using the cheapest bid other than five of the trump suit. The code for replies to that &quot;queen ask&quot; vary; a common rule is that the cheapest bid in the trump suit denies the queen or extra length and any other call shows it.

Roman Key Card Blackwood is predicated on existence of a trump suit, which determines which of the four kings and queens respondent should show as key cards. Trump agreement is not necessary, however. One common rule is that the last suit bid before 4NT bid is the key suit, lacking trump agreement.

=== 1430 RKCB ===
Some partnerships use the club response to show 1 or 4 and the diamond response to show 3 or none; this is referred to as &quot;1430&quot; while the original version is &quot;0314&quot;

== Roman Blackwood ==

A variation of the standard Blackwood convention, known as ''Roman Blackwood'', was popularized by the famous Italian [[Blue Team (bridge)|Blue Team]] in the 1960s. In Roman Blackwood, the responses are even more ambiguous, but more space-conserving. The basic outline of responses is:
{|
|5{{Clubs}}||– 0 or 3 aces
|-
|5{{Diams}}||– 1 or 4 aces
|-
|5{{Hearts}}||– 2 aces
|}
In practice, the ambiguity is unlikely to occur, as a strength difference between hands with 0 or 1 and 3 or 4 aces is big enough that it can be established in previous rounds of bidding. In other words, a partner who has previously shown e.g. 12-15 range of [[High card point|high points]] is unlikely to hold 3 aces for his bid, etc.

Even Roman Blackwood convention has several variations, revolving around 5{{Hearts}} and 5{{Spades}} responses. In all variants, they denote 2 aces. One variation is that 5{{Spades}} shows extra values, while 5{{Hearts}} does not. In other variations, responses 5{{Hearts}}-5NT denote specific combinations of aces (same color, same rank, or &quot;mixed&quot;).

If the querying partner ascertains that all aces are present, he can continue as follows:
*5NT is a [[Grand slam force]]
*The first available bid which is not the agreed suit is the Roman Blackwood for kings. The partner responds stepwise, as above.

== Asking bids other than 4NT ==
===Kickback===
&quot;Kickback&quot; is the variant of RKCB devised by [[Jeff Rubens]] in accordance with the [[Useful space principle]]. The step responses are the same as in RKCB, but the ask is not necessarily 4NT. Instead it is the 4-level bid immediately above the agreed trump suit, i.e.:
{|
|4{{Diams}}||– RKCB for clubs
|-
|4{{Hearts}}||– RKCB for diamonds
|-
|4{{Spades}}||– RKCB for hearts
|-
|4NT||– RKCB for spades
|}
Kickback has the advantage that it saves bidding space and, especially for minor-suit fits, provides safety at the 5-level if the required keycards are missing. Since the Kickback bid would otherwise be a control bid, 4NT is usually substituted as the control bid in that suit (e.g., 4NT is a control bid in hearts if the agreed trump suit is diamonds). The drawback is that in unpracticed partnerships there can be confusion as to whether a bid is Kickback, a control bid or preference for a different strain:
{{BridgeHandWE
|A3|K108642|KJ97|8
|K10642|A|AQ104|A53}}
{|class=wikitable cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
!width=&quot;50%&quot;|West
!width=&quot;50%&quot;|East
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|1{{Hearts}}||1{{Spades}}
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|2{{Hearts}}||3{{Diams}}
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|4{{Diams}}||4{{Hearts}}
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|Pass||
|}East intended 4{{Hearts}} as Kickback, but West thought it was secondary support for hearts, and decided to pass with minimum values. As result, a reasonable grand slam in diamonds was missed.

An established partnership might have agreed that as hearts were not supported after opener's rebid, 4{{Hearts}} cannot possibly show support, and must be ace asking in diamonds.

===Redwood===

&quot;Redwood&quot; is a variation of Kickback, in which the kickback principle is used only when a minor suit is trumps. The name comes from the fact that the resulting ace/key card ask will be a red suit, as follows:

4{{Diams}}– RKCB for clubs

4{{Hearts}}– RKCB for diamonds

Using &quot;Redwood,&quot; the ace/key card ask of 4NT is still used when the trump suit is a major (hearts or spades).

===Minorwood===

&quot;Minorwood&quot; is a variation of Blackwood, in which the minor suit which the partners agree will be trumps is itself used as the ace/keycard ask. The ask will be at the four level. Hence:

4{{Clubs}}– RKCB for clubs

4{{Diams}}– RKCB for diamonds

===Exclusion Blackwood===
'''Exclusion Blackwood''' or '''Voidwood'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;BW&quot;&gt;[[The Bridge World]], May 1981 Volume 52, Number 8, by Ron Gerard&lt;/ref&gt;  was devised by [[Bobby Goldman]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} as an attempt to resolve the situation when the Blackwood-asker has a void. In that case, he is not interested in the partner's ace in the void suit, as he already has the first-round control; partner's ace would present a duplicated value in that case. It should be noted, however, that many players, even experts, refuse to play Exclusion Blackwood because of the potential disaster of forgetting the agreement.

It is usually played as the Roman Keycard Blackwood, with only four keycards: the three Aces outside the void suit and the King of trumps. However, the asking bid is not 4NT, but the void suit— Voidwood is made by jumping on level 4 or 5 in the void suit after a fit has been found, for example:
{|class=wikitable
!width=&quot;50%&quot;|West
!width=&quot;50%&quot;|East
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|1{{Spades}}
|3{{Spades}}
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|'''5'''{{Clubs}}
| 
|}Bids of 5{{Clubs}}, 5{{Diams}} and 5{{Hearts}} present a Voidwood, denoting the void in the suit bid and asking for other keycards. The responses are, as in RKCB:
*1st step – 0 or 3 key cards (1 or 4, if playing 1430)
*2nd step – 1 or 4 key cards (0 or 3)
*3rd step – 2 key cards without trump queen
*4th step – 2 key cards with trump queen

== Practical advice ==
{{howto|section|date=March 2011}}
When the Blackwood bidder has a void, and partner shows one or more but not all missing aces, &quot;asker&quot; will not know whether partner's ace duplicates the void suit (where it would not be of great help) or covers side suit losers.  For this reason [[cue bid]]ding to show aces may be prudent with hands that contain a void.  In fact, most beginner-level players misuse this convention; they ask for aces when they really need other information from partner.

Beginners, intermediates, and even many advanced players often fail to comprehend the fundamental purpose of the Blackwood convention. They sometimes act as if the convention is designed to ascertain whether the partnership holds ''all'' of the four aces or five key-cards. In fact the purpose should usually be to distinguish between lacking one and lacking two, because lacking two aces makes slam a bad bet. In other words, ace and key-card asking conventions should normally be used by one member of a partnership who plans at least to contract for 12 tricks if no more than one ace or key-card is lacking.

&lt;!-- yadda yadda yadda --&gt;A simplified, but instructive, way to think about Blackwood is this: &quot;I am concerned that we may lose the first two tricks, if we bid a slam. I can use Blackwood as a kind of insurance policy, to guarantee that this will not happen.&quot; But Blackwood will not help if, due to the structure of the hands, there are multiple ways to lose the first two tricks. It only helps, for the most part, if the exclusive risk of losing the first two tricks is due to the opponents' holding two cashable '''aces'''. Obviously, the opposition might hold the ace and king of a side suit, and could bang those tricks right down, resulting in an immediate set.

Thus, a player should use Blackwood only when he can ascertain that the partnership holds at least second-round controls in all suits (kings or, if a suit fit is found, singletons). Thus, a Blackwood query by the player holding two quick losers in a side suit is a wild gamble, as it is still possible that the suit is not controlled by an Ace or a King.

For the same reason, it is generally wrong to use Blackwood with a void. (This is not always true, but the rule of thumb is: Don't use Blackwood with a void unless you are absolutely sure you know what you are doing, and why you are doing it. If you don't understand why it is correct, in a given case, to use Blackwood with a void, then it's very likely that its usage will be incorrect.) You may be missing two aces, but your void may compensate for the lack of one of the enemy aces. Thus, Blackwood will not tell you what you want to know: Are we at risk of losing the first two tricks? If your side has two aces and a void, then you are not at risk of losing the first two tricks, so long as (a) your void is useful (i.e. does not duplicate the function of an ace that your side holds) and  (b) you are not vulnerable to the loss of the first two tricks in the fourth suit (because, for instance, one of the partnership hands holds a singleton in that suit or the protected king, giving your side second round control).

Other problems can easily occur when clubs is the agreed trump suit, or the key suit when no trump suit is agreed. The reply to Blackwood could take the partnership past their agreed suit and going to the next higher level may be one trick too high.  The adage is 'don't use the convention if there is a possibility you won't like the reply.'

A further problem occurs when, after hearing his partner's response, the player who bid 4NT wants to stop in 5NT — as this is a forcing bid asking for Kings. A common agreement is that when spades is not the key suit, 5{{Spades}} asks respondent to bid 5NT.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Bixby, a fourth-generation Californian of English descent, was born '''Wilfred Bailey Everett Bixby III''' in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. His father, Wilfred Bailey Everett Jr., was a store clerk and his mother, Jane (née McFarland) Bixby, was a senior manager at [[I. Magnin|I. Magnin &amp; Company]]. When Bixby was eight, his father enlisted in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] during [[World War II]] and traveled to the [[Australasia|South Pacific]]. He attended [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell High School]] where he perfected his oratory and dramatic skills as a member of the [[Lowell Forensic Society]]. Though he received only average grades, he also competed in high school speech tournaments regionally. After graduation from high school in 1952, against his parents' wishes he majored in drama at [[San Francisco City College]], where he was a classmate of future actress [[Lee Meriwether]]. Later, he attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], his parents' [[alma mater]], and joined the [[Phi Delta Theta]] fraternity there. Just four credits short of earning a [[academic degree|degree]], Bixby dropped out of college and joined the [[United States Marine Corps]] after being drafted into the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]]. Bixby served stateside duty in the Marines and was [[honorably discharged]].

He then moved to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], where he had a string of odd jobs that included bellhop and lifeguard. He organized shows at a resort in [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming]]. In 1959, he was hired to work as a model and to do commercial work for [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]].

===Beginning acting===
In 1961, Bixby was in the musical ''[[The Boy Friend]]'' at the Detroit Civic Theater, returning to Hollywood to make his television debut on an episode of ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]''. He became a highly regarded [[character actor]] and guest-starred in many 1960s TV series including ''[[Ben Casey]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[Dr. Kildare#Television|Dr. Kildare]]'' and ''[[Hennessey]]''. He also joined the cast of ''The [[Joey Bishop]] Show'' in 1962. During the 1970s, he made guest-appearances on TV series such as ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', ''[[Insight (TV series)|Insight]]'', ''[[Barbary Coast (TV series)|Barbary Coast]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Medical Center (TV series)|Medical Center]]'', four episodes of ''[[Love, American Style]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' and two episodes of ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]''.

===''My Favorite Martian'' and other early roles===
Bixby took the role of young reporter Tim O'Hara in the 1963 CBS [[sitcom]], ''[[My Favorite Martian]]'', in which he co-starred with [[Ray Walston]]. But by 1966, high production costs forced the series to come to an end after 107 episodes. After the cancellation of ''Martian'', Bixby starred in four movies: ''[[Ride Beyond Vengeance]]'', ''[[Doctor,You've Got to Be Kidding]]'', and two of [[Elvis Presley]]'s movies, ''[[Clambake]]'', and ''[[Speedway (film)|Speedway]]''. He turned down the role as [[Marlo Thomas]]'s boyfriend in the successful ''[[That Girl]]'' and starred in two failed pilots.

===''The Courtship of Eddie's Father''===
In 1969, Bixby starred in his second high profile television role, as Tom Corbett in ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]'' a [[comedy-drama]] on ABC. The series concerned a widowed father raising a young son, managing a major syndicated magazine while at the same time trying to re-establish himself on the dating scene. This series was also the answer to other 1960s and 1970s [[sitcom]]s that dealt with [[widow]]hood, such as, ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[My Three Sons]]'', ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'', ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[Family Affair]]'', ''[[Julia (TV series)|Julia]]'', ''[[The Doris Day Show]]'', ''[[The Partridge Family]]'' and ''[[Sanford And Son]]''. On ''Courtship'', Bixby's co-star on the show was unknown [[child actor]] [[Brandon Cruz]]; the pair developed a close rapport that translated to an off-camera friendship as well. The cast was rounded out by [[Academy Award]] winning actress [[Miyoshi Umeki]], who played the role of Tom's housekeeper, Mrs. Livingston, [[James Komack]] (one of the series' producers) as Norman Tinker (Tom's pseudo-hippie, quirky photographer) and unfamiliar actress Kristina Holland as Tina (Tom's secretary). One episode of the show co-starred Bixby's future wife, ''[[Days of our Lives]]'' actress [[Brenda Benet]], as one of Tom's girlfriends.

Bixby was nominated for the Emmy Award for Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in 1971. The following year, he won the Parents Without Partners Exemplary Service Award for 1972.

Bixby made his directorial debut on the show in 1970, and directed eight episodes. ABC pulled the plug on the sitcom in 1972 at the end of season three.

Brandon Cruz said of the show, which developed a father-son relationship compared to that of ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', &quot;We dealt with issues that were talked about but were never brought up on television. Bill wasn't the first actor to portray a single widowed father, but he became one of the popular ones, because of his easy-going way of this crazy little kid.&quot; Prior to Bixby's promotion as the director, Brandon said, &quot;He was looking for the best dolly grip, along with the boom operator that if something was called specifically and failed, Bill could be easily angry.&quot; On the kind of relationship Bill had wanted with his co-star, Brandon also said, &quot;Bill would never speak down to me. Bill treated me as an equal. He made sure that we had a lot of time together, just so he could kinda crawl inside my head and see what actually made a kid tick.&quot; The final thing he realized of Bill's real-life father's death in 1971, and when asked about his mentor’s father’s loss, he stated: &quot;He had that type of mentality that the show must go on, thinking it was just a great T.V. show, after he broke down weeping.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} 

After the show was canceled, the two stars remained in contact, and Cruz was even a guest on Bixby's next run-away hit, ''[[The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]''. The death of Bixby's only child, in 1981, drew Bixby and Cruz closer still. The two would remain in touch until Bixby's death in 1993. In 1995, Cruz would name his own son Lincoln Bixby Cruz.

===1973 to 1977===
In 1973, Bixby starred in ''[[The Magician (TV series)|The Magician]]''. The series was well liked, but it only lasted one season, likely a victim of the Hollywood writers' strike of 1973, and high production costs. An accomplished amateur magician himself, he hosted several TV specials in the mid-1970s which featured other amateur magicians, and was a respected member of the Hollywood magic community, belonging to [[The Magic Castle]], an exclusive club for magicians. During the show's popular, although short-lived production, Bixby as always, invited a few old friends along to co-star such as Kristina Holland and Ralph O'Hara.

Also in 1973, he starred in [[Steambath (play)|Steambath]], a play by author [[Bruce Jay Friedman]], on [[PBS]] with [[Valerie Perrine]] and [[Jose Perez]].

He became a popular game show panelist, appearing mostly on ''[[Password]]'' and ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]''. He was also a panelist on the 1974 revival of ''[[Masquerade Party]]'' hosted by [[Richard Dawson]]. He had also appeared with Dawson on ''[[Cop-Out]]''.

In 1975, he co-starred with [[Tim Conway]] and [[Don Knotts]] in the Disney movie ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang (film)|The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'', which was well received by the public.

Returning to television, he worked with [[Susan Blakely]] on ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man]]'', a highly successful [[television miniseries]] in 1976. He played a daredevil stunt pilot in an episode of the short-lived 1976 [[CBS]] adventure series ''[[Spencer's Pilots]]'', starring [[Gene Evans]]. In 1977, Bixby appeared with [[Donna Mills]], [[Richard Jaeckel]], and [[William Shatner]] in the last episode, entitled &quot;The Scarlet Ribbon&quot;, of NBC's western series ''[[The Oregon Trail (TV series)|The Oregon Trail]]'', starring [[Rod Taylor]] and [[Andrew Stevens]]. Bixby directed two of ''The Oregon Trail'' episodes.

In 1976, he honored with two [[Emmy Award]] nominations, one for Outstanding Lead Actor for a Single Appearance in Drama or Comedy for ''The Streets of San Francisco'' and the other for Outstanding Single Performance by a Supporting Actor in Comedy or Drama Series for ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (TV miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]''.

Bixby also hosted ''[[Once Upon A Classic]]'' on PBS from 1976 to 1980.

===''The Incredible Hulk''===
Although he initially declined the part of Dr. David Banner in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' because of its comic book origins, on reading [[Kenneth Johnson]]'s script for the pilot episode he was persuaded to change his mind (and agreed to remain involved with the series for as long as Johnson was to be involved). Consequently, Bixby starred as Dr. David Bruce Banner in a two-hour pilot movie called ''The Incredible Hulk'', based loosely on the [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] [[Marvel Comics|Marvel comic]] of the [[Hulk (comics)|same name]]. Its success (coupled with some theatrical releases of the film in Europe) convinced CBS to turn it into a weekly [[science-fiction]] series which began airing in early 1978. It was a massive international hit, seen in over seventy countries. The show made Bixby into a pop icon of the late '70s and early '80s. [[Lou Ferrigno]], a bodybuilder and a lesser known star at the time, starred as the Hulk. The show also featured veteran actor [[Jack Colvin]] as investigative reporter Jack McGee, who pursues the Hulk throughout the series' run. One line of dialogue from the pilot - ''Dr. Banner'': &quot;Mr McGee, don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry&quot; - quickly became a catchphrase the world over. (The phrase was repeated, first in [[Ang Lee]]'s 2003 movie [[Hulk (film)|Hulk]], in which [[Eric Bana]] says the line in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] - the final line of the movie - and again in the 2008 movie &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; when [[Edward Norton]] incorrectly says, in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], &quot;Don't make me hungry, you wouldn't like me when I'm hungry&quot;.) The pilot also starred [[Susan Sullivan]] as Dr. Elaina Marks who tries to help the conflicted and widowed Dr. Banner overcome his &quot;problem&quot; and falls in love with him in the process.

During the show's run, Bixby invited two of his long-time friends, [[Ray Walston]] and [[Brandon Cruz]], to guest star with him in different episodes of the series. He also worked on the show with his friend, movie actress [[Mariette Hartley]], who would later star with Bixby in his final series, ''[[Goodnight, Beantown]]'' in 1983. In the ''Hulk'', Ms. Hartley appeared in the memorable double-length episode ''Married'' (in which David finds another source of help with whom he falls in love and marries) and subsequently won an Emmy Award for her guest appearance. Future star [[Loni Anderson]] would also guest star with Bixby during the first season. Bixby directed one episode of the ''Hulk'', &quot;Bring Me the Head of the Hulk&quot; in 1980 (original airdate: January 9, 1981). The series was canceled after the following season, but leftover episodes aired as late as the next June. Bixby was disappointed that his character was not cured of his condition in the final episode.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} However, this lack of closure left the door open for future projects. Thus, Bixby was later able to reprise the role in three television movies: ''[[The Incredible Hulk Returns]]'', ''[[The Trial of the Incredible Hulk]]'', and ''[[The Death of the Incredible Hulk]]''. Two other television movies were to be planned. However, due to Bixby's declining health, all such projects were canceled.

Bixby's performance as David Banner was roundly praised by critics and fans alike{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

===Later work===
Bixby was executive producer and co-star of the short-lived sit-com ''[[Goodnight, Beantown]]'' (1983–1984). He also directed three episodes of the series. In 1987, he directed eight episodes of the satirical police sitcom ''[[Sledge Hammer!]]''

Bixby was executive producer of the three ''Hulk'' made-for-television sequel movies in the late 1980s and in 1990. He also directed the latter two.

Bixby hosted two ''Is Elvis Alive?'' specials in August 1991 and January 1992,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitcomsonline.com/billbixby.html Bill Bixby: Biography] Sitcoms Online, Retrieved March 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; both from Las Vegas.

Bixby made his last acting appearance, in 1992, guest starring on an episode of ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]''.

He finished his career by directing 30 episodes (in seasons two and three) of the ''[[NBC]]'' sitcom ''[[Blossom (TV series)|Blossom]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvcomappearances&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.tv.com/bill-bixby/person/1203/appearances.html |title = Bill Bixby: Credit Listings |accessdate = March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Bixby's father died of a heart attack in 1971, a month before Bill's first wedding. His ashes were scattered in the Pacific off the coast of the island of Maui.

Bixby was married three times. His first marriage was to actress [[Brenda Benet]]. They were married on July 4, 1971. She gave birth to their son Christopher on September 25, 1974. In addition to their earlier appearance together on ''Courtship'', Benet guest-starred with him on his ''[[The Magician (TV series)|The Magician]]'' series in 1973, did an episode of ''[[The Love Boat]]'' with him in 1977, and guested on his ''[[The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' program in 1980 just before they divorced. On March 1, 1981, Bixby's six-year-old son Christopher died suddenly of a rare throat infection. His ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean, near Maui, like his grandfather's. Benet committed suicide on April 7, 1982, following a break-up with her assistant, [[Tammy Bruce]].

In 1989, he met Laura Michaels, who had worked on the set of one of his ''Hulk'' movies. The couple married a year later in Hawaii. In early 1991,{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Bixby was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] and underwent treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Henkel|first= John|title= Prostate Cancer: New Tests Create Treatment Dilemmas|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1370/is_n10_v28/ai_15955600/|date= December 1994|work= [[FDA Consumer]]|publisher= [[BNET]]|accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was divorced in the same year. In late 1992, friends introduced him to the artist Judith Kliban, widow of [[B. Kliban]], a cartoonist who had died of a pulmonary embolism. Bixby married Judith in late 1993, just six weeks before he collapsed on the set of ''Blossom''.

In early 1993, after rumors began circulating about his health, Bixby went public with his illness, discussing his disease and the energy needed to keep him alive. As a result, he made several guest appearances on shows such as ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', and ''[[Good Morning America]]'', among many others.

==Death==
Bixby's cancer recurred and was diagnosed as terminal. On November 21, 1993, six days after his final assignment on ''Blossom'', he died of complications in [[Century City, California]]. His wife and another longtime friend of the actor, [[Dick Martin (comedian)|Dick Martin]], were by his side. Bixby's ashes are at Kliban's Maui estate. A week after his death, his and Judith's family were joined by many mourners at a private memorial.

==Popular culture==
Bixby's name is referenced by [[KRS-One]] in the 1994 hip hop song &quot;Mad Izm&quot;, by [[3rd Alley]] in the 2008 alternative rock song &quot;Bill Bixby,&quot; and by [[Ice Cube]] in the 1993 hip hop song &quot;Down for Whatever.&quot;

==Biopic==
In 2003, while promoting [[X2]], [[Hugh Jackman]] mentioned in an interview on UK television morning talk show ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'' that he planned to make a biopic of Bill Bixby, that he had been drawn to the project by [[Bryan Singer]] and that it was a project he loved. A year later, while promoting ''[[Van Helsing]]'', he mentioned on ''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno'' that he wanted to make the movie soon. Leno showed a picture of Jackman and Bixby and pointed out the similarities in looks. Jackman would later reveal on ''[[Parkinson]]'' in the UK that he was drawn to Bixby's story because it was one of tremendous courage and determination against the odds. Many magazines in the UK including ''[[Total Film]]'', ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' and ''[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]'' ran the story that Jackman would be playing Bixby. Nothing more was heard until summer 2009 when it was rumoured that Jackman's [[Seed Productions]] would add this to their upcoming projects with the possibility of [[Richard Donner]] directing or Jackman himself making his directing debut.

Parallel to a possible Hugh Jackman starring biopic [[Electric Entertainment]] and [[TNT (TV channel)|TNT]] announced in 2009 that it too would be making a TV movie based on Bixby's life. It will star possibly [[Noah Wyle]] or [[Tim Daly]] as Bixby.
