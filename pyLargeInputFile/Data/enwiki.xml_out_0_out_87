===Literature===
{{main|Chicago Literature}}
Chicago literature found its roots in the city's tradition of lucid, direct [[journalism]], lending to a strong tradition of social realism. Consequently, most notable Chicago fiction focuses on the city itself, with social criticism keeping exultation in check. Writers such as [[Mike Royko]], [[Studs Terkel]], [[Stuart Dybek]], [[Carl Sandburg]], [[James T. Farrell]], [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Saul Bellow]], [[John Guzlowski]] and [[Finley Peter Dunne]] have all drawn the city's literary portrait in diverse ways, united by the fact that their observations brought the world's attention to focus on Chicago.

{{Main|Demographics of Chicago}}

During its first 100 years as a city, Chicago grew at a rate that ranked among the fastest growing in the world. When founded in 1833, less than 200 people had settled on what was then the American frontier. By the time of its first census, seven years later, the population had reached over 4000. Within the span of forty years, the city's population grew from slightly under 30,000 in 1850 to over 1 million by 1890. By the close of the 19th century, Chicago was the fifth largest city in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201f.htm |title=Top 10 Cities of the Year 1900 |publisher=Geography.about.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the largest of the cities that did not exist at the dawn of the century. Within fifty years of the [[Great Chicago Fire|Great Chicago Fire of 1871]], the population had tripled to over 3 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Law and government==
{{Main|Law and government of Chicago|Political history of Chicago}}
[[File:Daley Plaza 060716.jpg|thumb|Daley Plaza with [[Picasso]] statue and City Hall in background.  State law courts are in the building at right]]
Chicago is the [[county seat]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]]. The government of the City of Chicago is divided into [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislature|legislative]] branches. The [[Mayor of Chicago]] is the chief executive, elected by general election for a term of four years, with no term limits. The mayor appoints commissioners and other officials who oversee the various departments. In addition to the mayor, Chicago's two other citywide elected officials are the clerk and the treasurer.

The [[Chicago City Council|City Council]] is the legislative branch and is made up of 50 aldermen, one elected from each [[wards of the United States|ward]] in the city. The council enacts local ordinances and approves the city budget. Government priorities and activities are established in a budget ordinance usually adopted each November. The council takes official action through the passage of ordinances and resolutions.

During much of the last half of the 19th century, Chicago's politics were dominated by a growing [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] organization dominated by ethnic ward-heelers. During the 1880s and 1890s, Chicago had a powerful radical tradition with large and highly organized socialist, [[anarchism|anarchist]] and labor organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Schneirov 1998, pp 173–174&lt;/ref&gt; For much of the 20th century, Chicago has been among the largest and most reliable Democratic strongholds in the United States, with Chicago's Democratic vote the state of Illinois has been &quot;[[Red states and blue states|solid blue]]&quot; in [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] since 1992. The citizens of Chicago have not elected a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] mayor since 1927, when [[William Hale Thompson|William Thompson]] was voted into office. The strength of the party in the city is partly a consequence of Illinois state politics, where the Republicans have come to represent the rural and farm concerns while the Democrats support urban issues such as Chicago's public school funding. Chicago contains close to 25% of the state's population, and as such, eight of Illinois' 19 [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] have part of Chicago in their [[Illinois's congressional districts|districts]].

Former Chicago Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]]'s mastery of [[political machine|machine politics]] preserved the [[Chicago Democratic Machine]] long after the demise of similar machines in other large U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;Montejano 1998, pp 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; During much of that time, the city administration found opposition mainly from a liberal &quot;independent&quot; faction of the Democratic Party. The independents finally gained control of city government in 1983 with the election of [[Harold Washington]]. From 1989 until May 16, 2011, Chicago has been under the leadership of [[Richard M. Daley]], the son of Richard J. Daley. Because of the dominance of the Democratic Party in Chicago, the Democratic [[primary election|primary]] vote held in the spring is generally more significant than the general elections in November. On May 16, 2011, [[Rahm Emanuel]] was sworn in as the 55th mayor of Chicago, ending a 22-year era led by [[Richard M. Daley]].

===City planning===
{{See also|Community areas of Chicago|Neighborhoods of Chicago}}
[[File:Chicago community areas map.svg|thumb|[[Community areas of Chicago|Community areas]] of the City of Chicago]]
Chicago has four main sections: Downtown (which contains the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]]), the North Side, the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]], and the West Side. The three sides of the city are represented on the [[Flag of Chicago]] by three horizontal white strips. These sections can further be informally subdivided or grouped, for example as shown on the map (right). Further sectional references are the Northwest side and the Southwest side. In the late 1920s, sociologists at the University of Chicago subdivided the city into 77 distinct [[Community areas of Chicago|community areas]], which can further be subdivided into over [[Neighborhoods of Chicago|200 neighborhoods]].

The central commercial area often is portrayed, as in the map at right, to include parts of [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]] and [[Near South Side, Chicago|Near South Side]], as well as the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]]. The North Side is the most densely populated residential section of the city and many high-rises are located on this side of the city along the lakefront.
The South Side is the largest section of the city, encompassing roughly 60% of the city's land area. The South Side contains the [[University of Chicago]] and most of the facilities of the [[Port of Chicago]].

[[Roads and freeways in Chicago|Chicago's streets]] were laid out in a [[Grid plan|street grid]] that grew from the city's original townsite plat. Streets following the [[Public Land Survey System]] section lines later became arterial streets in outlying sections. As new additions to the city were platted, city ordinance required them to be laid out with eight streets to the mile in one direction and 16 in the other direction. The grid's regularity would provide an efficient means to develop new real estate property. A scattering of diagonal streets, many of them originally Indian trails, also cross the city. Many additional diagonal streets were recommended in the [[Burnham Plan|Plan of Chicago]], but only the extension of [[Ogden Avenue (Chicago)|Ogden Avenue]] was ever constructed.

===Crime===
{{Main|Crime in Chicago|Organized crime in Chicago}}
Murders in the city peaked first in 1974, with 970 murders when the city's population was over three million people (resulting in a murder rate of around 29 per 100,000), and again in 1992 with 943 murders, resulting in a murder rate of 34 per 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Heinzmann, David (1/1/2003).

''Chicago Tribune'', found at qrc.depaul.edu/djabon/Articles/ChicagoCrime20030101.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago, along with other major US cities, experienced a significant reduction in violent crime rates through the 1990s, eventually recording 448 [[homicide]]s in 2004, the lowest total since 1965 (15.65 per 100,000.) Chicago's homicide tally remained steady throughout 2005, 2006, and 2007 with 449, 452, and 435 respectively.

In 2008, murders rebounded to 510, 2nd highest in the country, breaking 500 for the first time since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6580432 |title=Murder rate jumps in 2008 |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tressugar.com/1919267 |title=Chicago's Murder Rate Double American Soldiers Killed in Iraq |publisher=Tres Sugar |date= 2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2009 the murder count was down about 10% for the year, to 458.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI 2005 UCR data|url=http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/05cius/data/table_08_il.html|publisher=FBI|accessdate=2010-08-18}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young Magnet High School]], was opened in 1975, and was attended by the [[First Lady of the United States]], [[Michelle Obama]]. The district, with an enrollment exceeding 400,000 students (2005 stat.), ranks as the third largest in the US&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cps.k12.il.us/AtAGlance.html CPS At A Glance (2005)] ''Chicago Public Schools'' at www.cps.k12.il.us/AtAGlance.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago's private schools are largely run by religious groups, with the two largest systems being the Catholic and [[Lutheran school]]s. The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago]] operates the city's [[Catholic school]]s, including the [[List of Jesuit secondary schools in the United States#Illinois|Jesuit preparatory school]]s. Some of the more prominent Catholic schools are: [[De La Salle Institute]], Gordon Technical High School, [[Cristo Rey Jesuit High School (Chicago)|Cristo Rey Jesuit High School]], [[Brother Rice High School (Chicago, Illinois)|Brother Rice High School]], [[St. Ignatius College Preparatory School]], [[St. Scholastica Academy (Chicago, Illinois)|St. Scholastica Academy]], [[Mount Carmel High School (Chicago)|Mount Carmel High School]], [[Mother McAuley Liberal Arts High School]], [[Marist High School (Chicago, Illinois)|Marist High School]], [[St. Patrick High School (Chicago)|St. Patrick High School]] and [[Resurrection High School (Chicago, Illinois)|Resurrection High School]]. In addition to Chicago's network of 32 Lutheran schools,&lt;ref&gt;Pogorzelski 2008, p 58&lt;/ref&gt; there are also several private schools run by other denominations and faiths, such as the [[Ida Crown Jewish Academy]] in [[West Ridge, Chicago|West Ridge]]. Additionally, a number of private schools are run in a completely secular educational environment, such as the [[Latin School of Chicago]], the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]] in Hyde Park, the [[Francis W. Parker School (Chicago)|Francis W. Parker School]], the Chicago City Day School in Lake View, the [[Feltre School]] in [[River North]] and the [[Morgan Park Academy]]. Chicago is also home of the private [[Chicago Academy for the Arts]], a high school focused on six different categories of the arts, such as Media Arts, Visual Arts, Music, Dance, Musical Theatre and Theatre.

The [[Chicago Public Library]] system operates 79 public libraries including the central library, two regional libraries, and numerous branches distributed throughout the city.

''Assessing the Effects of Freight Movement on Air Quality at the National and Regional Level''. U.S. Department of Transportation – Federal Highway Administration (April 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2002, severe freight train congestion caused trains to take as long to get through the Chicago region as it took to get there from the West Coast of the country (about 2 days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Winsor |first=Jeromie |url=http://www.metroplanning.org/articleDetail.asp?objectID=1707 |title=Metropolitan Planning Council |publisher=Metroplanning.org |date=2003-07-14 |accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one-third of the country's freight trains pass through the city, making it a major national bottleneck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/171140041.html |title=The heartland fast-freight rail system |publisher=Entrepreneur.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Announced in 2003, the Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency (CREATE) initiative is using about $1.5B in private railroad, state, local, and federal funding to improve rail infrastructure in the region to reduce freight rail congestion by about one third.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midwesthsr.org/promote_create.htm]{{dead link|date=November 2010}} – Includes map&lt;/ref&gt; This is also expected to have a positive impact on passenger rail and road congestion, as well as create new greenspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.createprogram.org/faq.html |title=CREATE |publisher=Createprogram.org |date= |accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicago is one of the largest hubs of passenger rail service in the nation. Many [[Amtrak]] long distance services originate from [[Union Station (Chicago)|Union Station]]. The services terminate in San Francisco, Washington D.C., New York City, [[Indianapolis]], [[New Orleans]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]], [[Boston]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]], [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], Los Angeles, and [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]. An attempt was made in the early 20th century to link Chicago with New York City via the [[Chicago – New York Electric Air Line Railroad]]. Parts of this were built, but it was ultimately never completed.

The [[Metra]] service provides [[commuter rail]] service.  It has 11 lines radiating north, west and south.

===Expressways===
{{Main|Roads and freeways in Chicago}}
[[File:ChicagoSkyway1104.jpg|right|thumb|Night view of the [[Chicago Skyway]] tollbooths at the entrance to Chicago's southern city limits]]
Nine [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highways]] run through Chicago and its suburbs. Segments that link to the city center are named after influential politicians, with three of them named after former U.S. Presidents (Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Reagan) and one named after two-time Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson. When referring to the expressways, local citizens tend to use the names of the expressways rather than the interstate numbers, primarily because the names denote certain sections of the interstate(s).

The Kennedy Expressway and the Dan Ryan Expressway are the busiest state maintained routes in the City of Chicago and its suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.il.gov/trafficmaps/table.htm |title=Illinois Department of Transportation |publisher=Dot.il.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public transportation===
The [[Regional Transportation Authority (Illinois)|Regional Transportation Authority]] (RTA) coordinates the operation of the three service boards: CTA, Metra, and Pace.

The [[Chicago Transit Authority]] (CTA) handles public transportation in the city of Chicago and a few adjacent suburbs outside of the Chicago city limits. The CTA operates an extensive network of buses and a [[rapid transit]] elevated and subway system known as the [[Chicago 'L'|'L']] (for &quot;elevated&quot;), with lines designated by colors. These rapid transit lines also serve both [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway]] and [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare Airport]]s. The CTA's rail lines consist of the [[Red Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Red]], [[Blue Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Blue]], [[Green Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Green]], [[Orange Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Orange]], [[Brown Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Brown]], [[Purple Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Purple]], [[Pink Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Pink]], and [[Yellow Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Yellow]] lines. Both the Red and Blue lines offer 24 hour service which makes Chicago one of the few cities in the world (and one of only three cities in the United States of America) to offer rail service every day of the year for 24 hours around the clock. A new rapid transit line, the Circle Line, is also in the planning stages by the CTA.

[[Metra]], the nation's second-most used passenger regional rail network, operates an 11-line [[commuter rail]] service in Chicago and its suburbs. The [[Metra Electric Line]] shares its trackage with Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District's [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore Line]], which provides commuter service between [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] and Chicago. [[Pace (transit)|Pace]] provides bus and [[paratransit]] service in over 200 surrounding suburbs with some extensions into the city as well. A 2005 study found that one quarter of commuters used public transit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/13/real_estate/public_transit_commutes/index.htm &quot;New Yorkers are top transit users&quot;], by Les Christie,''CNNmoney.com'', 2007-6-29.

[[Greyhound Lines]] provides inter-city bus service to and from the city, and Chicago is also the hub for the Midwest network of [[Megabus (North America)]].

The successes of the [[Cycling in Chicago|Bike Program]] are due in large part to Mayor Daley's leadership and the incorporation of bicycling into the mandates and programs of the Chicago Department of Transportation, CTA, Chicago Park District and the Mayor's Office of Special Events, in partnership with the [[Active Transportation Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bike2015plan.org/pdf/plan.pdf|title=City of Chicago Bike 2015 Plan|date=21 September 2005|accessdate=22 August 2009|work=Mayor's Bicycle Advisory Council|publisher=City of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago Park District]] maintains an {{convert|18|mi|km|adj=on}} [[multi-use path]], popular with bicycle commuters, along Lake Michigan called the [[Chicago Lakefront Trail|Lakefront Trail]].

Chicago is served by [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway International Airport]] on the South Side and [[O'Hare International Airport]], the world's second busiest airport, on the far Northwest Side. In 2005, O'Hare was the world's busiest airport by aircraft movements and the second busiest by total passenger traffic (due to government enforced flight caps).&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.airports.org/aci/aci/file/Press%20Releases/PR140306_2005_Prelim_Results.pdf Preliminary Traffic Results for 2005 Show Firm Rebound (3/14/2006)]|520&amp;nbsp;KB}}. ''Airports Council International''.&lt;/ref&gt; Both O'Hare and Midway are owned and operated by the City of Chicago. [[Gary/Chicago International Airport]], located in nearby [[Gary, Indiana]], serves as the third Chicago area airport. Chicago is the world headquarters for [[United Airlines]], the world's second-largest airline by revenue-passenger-kilometers and the city is a hub for [[American Airlines]]. Midway is a hub for low-cost carrier [[Southwest Airlines]].

===Port===
{{Main|Port of Chicago}}
'''The Port of Chicago''' consists of several major port facilities within the city of [[Chicago, Illinois]] operated by the '''Illinois International Port District''' (formerly known as the '''Chicago Regional Port District'''). The central element of the Port District, '''Calumet Harbor''', is maintained by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (November 2007). [http://www.lrc.usace.army.mil/co-o/calumet.pdf &quot;Calumet Harbor, IL and IN.&quot;] Retrieved on 2008-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Facilities====
*Iroquois Landing Lakefront Terminal: at the mouth of the Calumet River, it includes {{convert|100|acre|km2}} of warehouses and facilities on Lake Michigan with over 780,000 square meters (8,390,000 square feet) of storage.
*Lake Calumet terminal: located at the union of the [[Grand Calumet River]] and [[Little Calumet River]] {{convert|6|mi|km}} inland from Lake Michigan. Includes three transit sheds totaling over 29,000 square meters (315,000 square feet) adjacent to over 900 linear meters (3000 linear feet) of ship and barge berthing.
*Grain (14 million bushels) and bulk liquid (800,000 barrels) storage facilities along [[Lake Calumet]].
*The Illinois International Port district also operates [[Foreign Trade Zone]] #22, which extends {{convert|60|mi|km}} from Chicago's city limits.

==Infrastructure==
===Utilities===
Electricity for most of [[northern Illinois]] is provided by [[Commonwealth Edison]], also known as ComEd. Their service territory borders [[Iroquois County, Illinois|Iroquois County]] to the south, the [[Wisconsin]] border to the north, the [[Iowa]] border to the west and the [[Indiana]] border to the east. In northern Illinois, ComEd (a division of [[Exelon]]) operates the greatest number of nuclear generating plants in any US state. Because of this, ComEd reports indicate that Chicago receives about 75% of its electricity from nuclear power. Recently, the city started the installation of wind turbines on government buildings with the aim to promote the use of renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iit.edu/~ipro307f/faq.html |title=IIT.edu |publisher=IIT.edu |date=2003-06-20 |accessdate=2009-05-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080605021018/http://www.iit.edu/~ipro307f/faq.html |archivedate = June 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentlaw.edu/news/advisory/adv030707.html |title=KentLaw.edu |publisher=KentLaw.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Martin LaMonica Staff Writer, CNET News |url=http://news.com.com/Micro+wind+turbines+are+coming+to+town/2100-11398_3-6037539.html |title='Micro' wind turbines are coming to town &amp;#124; CNET News.com |publisher=News.com.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural Gas is provided by Peoples Gas, a subsidiary of [[Integrys Energy Group]], which is headquartered in Chicago.

Domestic and industrial waste was once incinerated but it is now [[landfill]]ed, mainly in the [[Lake Calumet|Calumet area]]. From 1995 to 2008, the city had a [[blue bag]] program to divert certain refuse from landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1322.html |title=chicagohistory.org |publisher=Encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org |date= |accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 2007 the city began a pilot program for blue bin recycling similar to that of other cities due to low participation rates in the blue bag program. After completion of the pilot the city will determine whether to roll it out to all wards.

==Sister cities==
&lt;!-- BEFORE ADDING TO THIS LIST, VERIFY THE INFO AT WWW.CHICAGOSISTERCITIES.COM OR PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL REFERENCE. --&gt;
Chicago has 28 [[Twin towns and sister cities|Sister Cities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sistercities&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago Sister Cities|url=http://www.chicagosistercities.com/|year=2009|work= |publisher= Chicago Sister Cities International|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Chicago, many of them are or were, the [[List of second cities|second city]] of their country, or they are the main city of a country that has had many immigrants settle in Chicago. [[Paris]] is a ''Partner City'', due to the one sister city policy of their respective [[Communes of France|French commune]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.fr/portail/accueil/Portal.lut?page_id=6587&amp;document_type_id=5&amp;document_id=16467&amp;portlet_id=14974 |title=Le jumelage avec Rome |accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=Municipalité de Paris |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate the sister cities, Chicago hosts a yearly festival in [[Daley Plaza]], which features cultural acts and food tastings from the other cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;sistercities&quot; /&gt; In addition, the Chicago Sister Cities program hosts a number of delegation and formal exchanges.&lt;ref name=&quot;sistercities&quot; /&gt; In some cases, these exchanges have led to further informal collaborations, such as the academic relationship between the Buehler Center on Aging, Health &amp; Society at the [[Feinberg School of Medicine]] of Northwestern University and the Institute of Gerontology of [[Ukraine]] (originally of the [[Soviet Union]]), that was originally established as part of the Chicago-Kyiv sister cities program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Celia|last=Berdes, PhD|coauthors=Levin, Andrew|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/aging/pdf/Annual2008.pdf|work=Annual Report 2008|pages=5–7|publisher=Buehler Center on Aging, Health &amp; Society|title=Director Emeritus James Webster Looks Backward, Forward|accessdate=2009-07-01}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Cyrix_6x86-P166.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Cyrix 6x86-P166.]]
The '''Cyrix 6x86''' (codename M1) is a sixth-generation, [[32-bit]] [[80x86]]-compatible [[microprocessor]] designed by [[Cyrix]] and manufactured by [[International Business Machines|IBM]] and [[SGS-Thomson]]. It was originally released in 1996.

==Architecture==
[[Image:Cyrix 6x86 arch.svg|250px|thumb|A simplistic block diagram of the Cyrix 6x86 [[microarchitecture]].]]
The 6x86 is [[superscalar]] and [[superpipelined]] and performs [[register renaming]], [[speculative execution]], [[out-of-order execution]], and [[data dependency]] removal. However, it continued to use native x86 execution and ordinary [[microcode]] only, like [[Centaur Technology|Centaur]]'s [[Winchip]], unlike competitors [[Intel]] and [[AMD]] which introduced the method of ''dynamic'' translation to [[micro-operation]]s with [[Pentium Pro]] and [[AMD K5|K5]]. 

With regards to internal caches, it has a 16-[[Kilobyte|kB]] primary [[CPU cache|cache]] and is [[CPU socket|socket]]-compatible with the Intel [[P5 (microarchitecture)#P54C|P54C]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]].  It was also unique in that it was the only [[x86]] design to incorporate a 256-byte ''Level 0'' scratchpad cache.  It has six performance levels: PR 90+, PR 120+, PR 133+, PR 150+, PR 166+ and PR 200+. These performance levels do not map to the clock speed of the chip itself (for example, a PR 133+ ran at 110 MHz, a PR 166+ ran at 133 MHz, etc). 

Note that the 6x86 and 6x86L weren't completely compatible with the Intel [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] instruction set and is not multi-processor capable. For this reason the chip identified itself as a [[80486]] and disabled the [[CPUID]] instruction by default. CPUID support could be enabled by first enabling extended CCR registers then setting bit 7 in CCR4. The lack of full P5 Pentium compatibility caused problems with some applications because programmers had begun to use P5 Pentium-specific instructions. Some companies released patches for their products to make them function on the 6x86.

The first generation of 6x86 had heat problems. This was primarily caused by their higher heat output than other x86 CPUs of the day and, as such, computer builders sometimes did not equip them with adequate cooling. The CPUs topped out at around 25 [[Watt|W]] heat output (like the [[AMD K6]]), whereas the P5 Pentium produced around 15 W of waste heat at its peak. However, both numbers would be a fraction of the heat generated by many high performance [[Netburst (microarchitecture)|Netburst]] [[Pentium 4]] versions, some years later.

[[File:KL IBM 6x86L Cyrix.jpg|thumb|Cyrix 6x86L 133MHz sold under IBM label]]
The '''6x86L''' was later released by [[Cyrix]] to address heat issues; the ''L'' standing for ''low-power''. Another release of the 6x86, the '''6x86MX''', added [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]] compatibility, introduced the [[Extended MMX|EMMI]]  instruction set, and quadrupled the primary cache size to 64 KB. This chip was later renamed  '''MII''', to better compete with the Pentium II processor.

==Performance==
[[Image:KL_Cyrix_6x86MX.jpg|thumb|Cyrix 6x86MX 150MHz.]]
[[Image:KL_IBM_6x86MX.jpg|right|thumb|IBM 6x86MX 133MHz.]]
It has been speculated by experts{{Fact|date=June 2008}} that 6x86 was designed to perform well specifically on business-oriented benchmarks of the time, most notably Ziff-Davis' [[Benchmark (computing)|Winstone benchmark]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/cpuwar.html#6x86MX&lt;/ref&gt; Winstone ran various speed tests using several popular applications. It was one of the leading benchmarks during the mid-'90s and was used in some leading magazines, such as [[Computer Shopper]] and [[PC Magazine]], as a deciding factor for system ratings.

Cyrix used a [[PR rating]] (Performance Rating) to relate their performance to the Intel [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] (pre-[[P55C (microprocessor)|P55C]]), because a 6x86 at a lower clock rate outperformed the higher-clocked P5 Pentium. For example, a 133 MHz 6x86 will outperform a P5 Pentium at 166 MHz, and as a result Cyrix could market the 133 MHz chip as being a P5 Pentium 166's equal. A PR rating was also necessary because the 6x86 could not clock as high as P5 Pentium and maintain equivalent manufacturing yields, so it was critical to establish the slower clock speeds as equal in the minds of the consumer. However, the PR rating was not an entirely truthful representation of the 6x86's performance.

While the 6x86's integer performance was significantly higher than P5 Pentium's, it's floating point performance was more mediocre—around twice the performance of the 486 FPU per clock cycle. The [[floating point unit|FPU]] in the 6x86 was largely the same circuitry that was developed for Cyrix's earlier high performance 8087/80287/80387-compatible coprocessors, which was very fast for its time—the Cyrix FPU was much faster than the 80387, and even the 80486 FPU. However, it was still considerably slower than the new and completely redesigned P5 Pentium and [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]] [[Pentium Pro]]-[[Pentium III]] FPUs. During the 6x86's development, the majority of applications ([[office software]]) performed almost entirely integer operations. The designers foresaw that future applications would most likely maintain this instruction focus. So, to optimize the chip's performance for what they believed to be the most likely application of the CPU, the integer execution resources received most of the transistor budget.

The popularity of the P5 Pentium caused many [[software developer]]s to hand-optimize code in [[X86 assembly language|assembly language]], to take advantage of the P5 Pentium's tightly pipelined and lower latency FPU. For example, the highly anticipated [[first person shooter]] [[Quake (video game)|Quake]] used highly-optimized assembly code designed almost entirely around the P5 Pentium's FPU. As a result, the P5 Pentium significantly outperformed other CPUs in the game. Fortunately for the 6x86 (and AMD K6), many games continued to be integer-based throughout the chip's lifetime.

==Cyrix MII==
[[File:KL Cyrix MII-333.jpg|thumb|right|Cyrix MII 250MHz]]
The 6x86 successor, '''MII''', was late to market, and couldn't scale well in clock speed with the manufacturing processes used at the time. Similar to the AMD K5, the Cyrix 6x86 was a design far more focused on integer per-clock performance than clock scalability, something that proved to be a strategic mistake. Therefore, despite being very fast clock by clock, the 6x86 and MII were forced to compete at the low-end of the market as AMD K6 and Intel [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]] [[Pentium II]] were always ahead on clock speed. The 6x86's and MII's old generation &quot;486 class&quot; floating point unit combined with an integer section that was at best on-par with the newer [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]] and K6 chips meant that Cyrix could no longer compete in performance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Colon classification''' ('''CC''') is a system of [[library classification]] developed by [[S. R. Ranganathan]]. It was the first ever [[Faceted classification|faceted]] (or analytico-synthetic) [[Taxonomic classification|classification]]. The first edition was published in 1933. Since then six more editions have been published. It is especially used in [[library|libraries]] in [[India]].

Its name &quot;Colon classification&quot; comes from the use of [[Colon (punctuation)|colons]] to separate facets in class numbers. However, many other classification schemes, some of which are completely unrelated, also use colons and other [[punctuation]] in various functions. They should not be confused with Colon classification.

As an example, the subject &quot;research in the cure of tuberculosis of lungs by x-ray conducted in India in 1950&quot; results in a call number

:L,45;421:6;253:f.44'N5

The components of this call number represent

:Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray:Research.India'1950

== Organization ==

The Colon Classification uses 42 main classes that are combined with other letters, numbers and marks in a manner resembling the [[Library of Congress Classification]] to sort a publication.

=== Facets ===

CC uses five primary categories, or facets, to further specify the sorting of a publication.  Collectively, they are called ''PMEST'':

:&lt;nowiki&gt;,&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[personality]]
:&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[matter]] or property
:&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[energy]]
:&lt;nowiki&gt;.&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[space]]
:&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[time]]

=== Classes ===

The following are the main classes of CC, with some subclasses, the main method used to sort the subclass using the PMEST scheme and examples showing application of PMEST.

== Example ==

The most commonly cited example of the Colon Classification is the classification for:

* &quot;Research in the cure of the tuberculosis of lungs by x-ray conducted in India in 1950s&quot;:

* Main classification is Medicine
** (Medicine)
* Within Medicine, the Lungs are the main concern
** (Medicine,Lungs)
* The property of the Lungs is that they are afflicted with Tuberculosis 
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis)
* The Tuberculosis is being performed (:) on, that is the intent is to cure (Treatment)
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment)
* The matter that we are treating the Tuberculosis with are X-Rays
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray)
* And this discussion of treatment is regarding the Research phase
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray:Research)
* This Research is performed within a geographical space (.) namely India
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray:Research.India)
* During the time (') of 1950
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray:Research.India'1950)
* And translating into the codes listed for each subject and facet the classification becomes
** L,45;421:6;253:f.44'N5

A '''census''' is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the latter cases the elements of the 'population' are farms, businesses, and so forth, rather than people. The [[United Nations]] defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as &quot;individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity&quot;, and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations (2008). [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/docs/P&amp;R_Rev2.pdf Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses]. Statistical Papers: Series M No. 67/Rev.2. p8. ISBN 9789211615050.&lt;/ref&gt; The term itself comes from [[latin language|Latin]]: during the [[Roman Republic]] the census was a list that kept track of all adult males fit for military service.

The census can be contrasted with [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] in which information is obtained only from a subset of a population, sometimes as an [[Intercensal estimate]]. Census data is commonly used for research, business [[marketing]], and planning, as well as a baseline for sampling surveys. In some countries, census data are used to apportion electoral representation (sometimes controversially – ''e.g.'', ''[[Utah v. Evans]]'').

==Privacy==
Although the census provides a useful way of obtaining statistical information about a population, such information can sometimes lead to abuses, political or otherwise, made possible by the linking of individuals' identities to anonymous census data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epic.org/privacy/census/ The Census and Privacy].&lt;/ref&gt; This consideration is particularly important when individuals' census responses are made available in [[Microdata (statistics)|microdata]] form, but even aggregate-level data can result in privacy breaches when dealing with small areas and/or rare subpopulations.

For instance, when reporting data from a large city, it might be appropriate to give the average income for black males aged between 50 and 60. However, doing this for a town that only has two black males in this age group would be a breach of privacy because either of those persons, knowing his own income and the reported average, could determine the other man's income.

Typically, census data are processed to obscure such individual information. Some agencies do this by intentionally introducing small statistical errors to prevent the identification of individuals in marginal populations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3110129.NSF/f61552cc746715bcca256eb000015277/2878e9589dd56b53ca257153007fe1f5!OpenDocument |title=Managing Confidentiality and Learning about SEIFA |publisher=Abs.gov.au |date=2006-04-18 |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; others swap variables for similar respondents. Whatever measures have been taken to reduce the privacy risk in census data, new technology in the form of better electronic analysis of data poses increasing challenges to the protection of sensitive individual information.

Another possibility is to present survey results by means of statistical models in the form of a multivariate distribution mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jos.nu/Articles/abstract.asp?article=264673 |title=Statistical Model of the 2001 Czech Census for Interactive Presentation |author=Grim J. |coauthors=Hora J., Somol P., Boček P., Pudil, P. |year=2010 |work=Journal of Official Statistics, vol. 26, no. 4 |pages=673–694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statistical information in the form of [[Conditional probability distribution|conditional distributions]] ([[histogram]]s) can be derived interactively from the estimated [[Mixture distribution|mixture model]] without any further access to the original database. As the final product does not contain any protected microdata, the [http://ro.utia.cas.cz/census model based interactive software] can be distributed without any confidentiality concerns.

Another method is simply to release no data at all, except very large scale data directly to the central government.

==Historical examples==
===Egypt===
[[Census in Egypt|Censuses in Egypt]] are said to have been taken during the early Pharaonic period in 3340 BC and in 3056 BC.

===Ancient Israel===
Censuses are mentioned in the [[Bible]]. God commands a [[flat tax]] to be paid with the census in {{bibleref|Exodus|30:11-16}} for the upkeep of the [[Tabernacle]]. The [[Book of Numbers]] is named after the counting of the Israelite population (in {{bibleref|Numbers|1-4}}) according to clans after the exodus from Egypt. A second census was taken while the Israelite were camped in the plains of [[Moab]], in {{bibleref|Numbers|26}}.

King [[David]] performed a census that produced disastrous results (in {{Bibleverse|2|Samuel|24}} and {{Bibleverse|1|Chronicles|21}}). [[God]] used [[Satan]] to try King David ({{Bibleverse|2|Samuel|24:1}}; {{Bibleverse|1|Chronicles|21:1}}), who then numbered the people out of pride &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gotquestions.org/David-census.html| Why was God so angry at David for taking the census?]&lt;/ref&gt;. His son, King [[Solomon]], had all of the foreigners in Israel counted in {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|2:17}}.

The [[Gospel of Luke]] records [[Jesus]] being born during a census in {{bibleref|Luke|2}}).

===China===
The world's oldest surviving census data comes from [[China]]. According to The Canadian Encyclopedia, China was the first to have a recorded census over 4000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0020060| title=Census - The Canadian Encyclopedia| publisher=Statistics Canada| quote=The first recorded census took place over 4000 years ago in China.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another census comes from the [[Han Dynasty]], in what is perhaps China's most well-known ancient census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factsanddetails.com/china.php?itemid=39&amp;catid=2&amp;subcatid=2| title= China - Facts and Details: Han Dynasty (206 B.C. - A.D. 220) | author=Jeffrey Hays}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twitchett, D., Loewe, M., and Fairbank, J.K. &lt;u&gt;Cambridge History of China: The Ch'in and Han Empires 221 B.C.-A.D. 220&lt;/u&gt;. Cambridge University Press (1986), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Taken in the fall of 2 AD, it is considered by scholars to be quite accurate.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, there were 57.67 million people registered in 12.36 million households living in China.&lt;ref&gt;Nishijima (1986), 595–596.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Yoon (1985). &quot;An early Chinese idea of a dynamic environmental cycle&quot;, ''[[GeoJournal]]'' '''10''' (2), pp. 211-212.&lt;/ref&gt; A third recorded census dates back to 144 AD, when 49.73 million people living in 9.94 million households were counted.

===Rome===
The word 'census' originates in ancient Rome from the Latin word 'censere' (meaning ‘estimate’). The census played a crucial role in the administration of the Roman Empire, as it was used to determine [[tax]]es (see [[Censor (ancient Rome)]]). With few interruptions, it was usually carried out every five years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Scheidel|Scheidel, Walter]]. &lt;u&gt;Rome and China: comparative perspectives on ancient world empires&lt;/u&gt;. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; It provided a register of citizens and their property from which their duties and privileges could be listed. It is said to have been instituted by the Roman king [[Servius Tullius]] in the 6th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'' 1.42&lt;/ref&gt; at which time the number of arms-bearing citizens was counted at 80,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'' 1.42, citing [[Fabius Pictor]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Umayyad Caliphate===
In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Caliphate]] began conducting regular censuses soon after its formation, beginning with the one ordered by the second [[Rashidun]] [[caliph]], [[Umar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Population Census and Land Surveys under the Umayyads (41–132/661–750)|first=Wadād|last=al-Qādī1|journal=Der Islam|volume=83|issue=2|pages=341–416|doi=10.1515/ISLAM.2006.015|date=July 2008|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Europe===
The most famous census in medieval Europe is the [[Domesday Book]], undertaken in 1086 by [[William I of England]] so that he could properly tax the land he had recently conquered. In 1183, a census was taken of the [[crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], to ascertain the number of men and amount of money that could possibly be raised against an invasion by [[Saladin]], sultan of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]].

===Inca Empire===
In the 15th century, the [[Inca Empire]] had a unique way to record census information. The Incas did not have any written language but recorded information collected during censuses and other numeric information as well as non-numeric data on [[quipus]], strings from [[llama]] or [[alpaca]] hair or cotton cords with numeric and other values encoded by knots in a base-10 positional system.

===Spanish empire===
On May 25, 1577, King Philip II of Spain ordered by royal cédula the preparation of a general description of Spain's holdings in the Indies. Instructions and a questionnaire, issued in 1577 by the Office of the Cronista Mayor-Cosmógrafo, were distributed to local officials in the Viceroyalties of New Spain and Peru to direct the gathering of information. The questionnaire, composed of fifty items, was designed to elicit basic information about the nature of the land and the life of its peoples. The replies, known as &quot;relaciones geográficas,&quot; were written between 1579 and 1585 and were returned to the Cronista Mayor-Cosmógrafo in Spain by the Council of the Indies.

==Modern implementation==
=== Afghanistan ===

Brazil's Demographic Census is one of the most [[hierarchical]] collection of census data in the world. Its hierarchies include: Brazil (Country), Major Regions, States, Macro-regions, micro-regions, municipalities, districts, sub-districts, Neighborhoods and census tracts.

Depending on the administrative hierarchy, some types of data are not published to respect confidentiality.

For example:

1. The lower area of data collection is the census tract, with approximately 300 households, and information is collected on age, condition of the home, gender, income, among others.

2. Districts: information on race, color, religion, disability, etc.

3. [[Municipalities]] (cities): in addition to the information already described, there is information of GDP, industrial production, agricultural production, migration between cities to study or work, to live migration, inflation, employment rates, number of industries, the quantity of trade, etc.
Information is collected with [[:pt:Ficheiro:Ibge em poá são paulo brasil.jpg|handheld computers]] equipped with GPS receivers and digitized maps.

For more information, see the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE).

===Bulgaria===
[[Bulgaria]]n governors organized a national census soon after the liberation of the Bulgarian lands. In 1881 a census took place in
the Principality, while in 1884 a census was organized in [[Eastern Rumelia]]. The first census covering the unified state took place in 1888.

Since these first accounts, Bulgarian authorities had organized several population censuses: 1892, 1900, 1905, 1910, 1920, 1926, 1934, 1946, 1956, 1965, 1975, 1985, 1992 and 2001.

The data provided in the Bulgarian censuses from 1888 until [[World War II]] is regarded as highly reliable{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} according to the standards of the time. The Bulgarian leading statisticians of the period were generally educated in Western universities and participated vividly in the international cooperation, therefore insisted and succeeded in introducing the best practices of the time. The quality of the data provided of later censuses is a matter of debate{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. The religion question in the 2001 census didn't allow the unaffiliated Bulgarians to be counted as such.

===Canada===
{{Main|Census in Canada}}
The [[Canada|Canadian]] census is run by [[Statistics Canada]]. The [[1666 census of New France]] was conducted by [[France|French]] [[intendant of New France|intendant]] [[Jean Talon]], when he took a census to ascertain the number of people living in [[New France]]. The method and data was later used when Canada was founded 201 years later. The individual provinces (sometimes in conjunction with each other) conducted censuses in the 19th century and before. In 1871, Canada's first formal census was conducted, which counted the population of [[Nova Scotia]], [[Ontario]], [[New Brunswick]], and [[Quebec]].

Censuses in Canada are conducted in five-year intervals. The last two censuses were conducted in 2001 and 2006. Censuses taken in mid-decade (1976, 1986, 1996, etc.) are referred to as quinquennial censuses. Others are referred to as decennial censuses. The first quinquennial census was conducted in 1956.

For the 2006 Census of Canada, respondents were able, for the first time, to choose to complete their census questionnaire online. Other options for answering the questionnaire include postal mail (using a pre-paid envelope) and [[telephone]] (using an [[Toll-free telephone number|800 number]]).

In the [[Province of Alberta]], Section 57 of its Municipal Government Act (MGA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qp.alberta.ca/574.cfm?page=m26.cfm&amp;leg_type=Acts&amp;isbncln=9780779745739 |title=Municipal Government Act (MGA) |publisher=Qp.alberta.ca |date=2006-12-28 |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; enables municipalities to perform their own censuses on any given year.

Some 6 million enumerators were engaged in the 2000 census. The next national population census was planned to start on November 1, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-05/28/c_13321827.htm |title=China Focus: China to count foreign residents for the first time in national census |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a preparative household registration survey has already started in Beijing on August 15, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-08/16/c_13446282.htm |title=Beijing starts door-to-door household registration survey |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2010-08-16 |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between National Population Censuses, 1% National Population Sample Surveys were taken in 1987, 1995, 2005 and 0.1% National Population Sample Surveys have been taken annually since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjdt/gjtjjdt/t20091221_402608717.htm |title=李克强主持召开人口普查领导小组会议时强调 把握我国基本国情 促进可持续发展 |publisher=Stats.gov.cn |date=2009-12-21 |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the last census are also available via the [http://ro.utia.cas.cz/census interactive model based software].

===Denmark===
{{Main|Census in Denmark}}
The first [[Denmark|Danish]] census was in 1700-1701, and contained statistical information about adult men. Only about half of it still exists. A census of school children was taken during the 1730s.

Following these early undertakings, the first census to attempt completely covering all citizens (including women and children who had previously been listed only as numbers) of [[Denmark-Norway]] was taken in 1769.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhd.uit.no/census/ft1769.html Census 1769].&lt;/ref&gt; At that point there were 797,584 citizens in the kingdom. [[Georg Christian Oeder]] took a statistical census in 1771 which covered [[Copenhagen]], [[Sjælland]], [[Møn]], and [[Bornholm]].

After that, censuses followed somewhat regularly in 1787, 1801, and 1834, and between 1840 and 1860, the censuses were taken every five years, and then every ten years until 1890. Special censuses for Copenhagen were taken in 1885 and 1895.

In the 20th century, censuses were taken every five years from 1901 to 1921, and then every ten years from 1930. The last traditional census was taken in 1970.

A limited population census based on registers was taken in 1976. From 1981 and each year onwards information that corresponds to a population and housing census is retrieved from registers. Denmark was the first country in the world to conduct these censuses from administrative registers. The most important registers are the Population Register ([[Det Centrale Personregister]]), the Building and Dwelling Register and the Enterprise Register. The central statistical office, [[Statistics Denmark]] is responsible for compiling these data. This information is available online in the Statbank Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statbank.dk |title=Statbank Denmark |publisher=Statbank.dk |date= |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to search a portion of the Danish censuses online at the Dansk Demografisk Database,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ddd.dda.dk/ |title=Dansk Demografisk Database |publisher=Ddd.dda.dk |date= |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also view scanned versions at Arkivalier Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkivalieronline.dk/ |title=Arkivalier Online |publisher=Arkivalieronline.dk |date= |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
{{Main|Census in Egypt}}

The Statistical Department of the Ministry of Finance conducted the first census in 1882, which considered as a preparatory step; the first true population census was conducted in 1897. Thereafter, censuses were conducted at ten-year intervals in 1907, 1917, 1927 and so on.

===Estonia===
Population censuses have been taken in [[Estonia]] in 1881, 1897, 1922, 1934, 1959, 1970, 1979, 1989 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stat.ee/26383 Censuses in Estonia].&lt;/ref&gt; The responsible institution is the [[Statistics Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.ee/censuses |title=Statistics Estonia |publisher=Stat.ee |date=2010-07-19 |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethiopia===
Three censuses have been taken in [[Ethiopia]]: 1984, 1994 and in 2007. The responsible institution is the [[Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)|Central Statistical Agency]].

Most of the census in 2007 was taken in August, while the [[Somali Region]] and the [[Afar Region]] were not covered. The northern Afar region is a remote, hot and arid area. The eastern Somali region ([[Ogaden]]) hosts a large nomadic Somali population and is a conflict area where Ethiopian regular forces are fighting against [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]] ([[ONLF]]).

===Finland===
The first population census was taken in 1749 when Finland was a part of Sweden. The most recent census took place on December 31, 2000.

===France===
The census in [[France]] is carried out by [[INSEE]]. Since 2004, a partial census is carried out every year, and the results published as averages over 5 years.

===Germany===
{{Main|Census in Germany}}
The first systematic population on the European continent was taken in 1719 in [[Prussia]] (roughly corresponding to today's northern Germany and western Poland).

The first large-scale census in the German Empire took place in [[German census of 1895|1895]]. Attempts at introducing a census in [[West Germany]] sparked strong popular resentment in the 1980s since many quite personal questions were asked. Some campaigned for a boycott. In the end the [[Constitutional Court of Germany|Constitutional Court]] stopped the census in 1980 and 1983. The last census was in 1987. Germany has since used [[Sampling (statistics)|population samples]] in combination with statistical methods, in place of a full census.

===Greece===
Census takes place every [[decennial|10 years]] and is carried out by the National Statistical Service of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.gr Γενικη Γραμματεια Εσυε].&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 is taking place right now and will end in the 24th of May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apografi2011.gr/en/index.php]&lt;/ref&gt; Last census was in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.gr/portal/page/portal/ESYE/PAGE-themes?p_param=A1604]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guatemala===
Modern population censuses have been taken in Guatemala in 1930, 1950, 1964, 1973, 1981, 1994 and in 2002. Controversial cenuses include those in 1950 and 1964 (misclassification of the Maya population) and 1994 (generally questioned). About 14,000,000 people live in Guatemala as of July 2009.

===Hong Kong===
{{Main|Census in Hong Kong}}
Census takes place every [[decennial|10 years]] and by-census between two censuses by the [[Census and Statistics Department]] of [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. The last census was conducted in 2001 and the next census would be taken in 2011.

===Hungary===
Official decennial censuses have been taken in Hungary since 1870; the latest one – in line with the recommendations of the United Nations and the Statistical Office of the European Union – was carried out in 2001.
Starting from 1880 the Hungarian census system was based on native language (the language spoken at home in the early life of the person and at the time of the survey), vulgar language (the most frequently used language in the family), and other spoken languages.

===Iceland===
The first [[Iceland]]ic census took place in [[Icelandic census of 1703|1703]], following upon the first [[Denmark|Danish]] census of 1700–1701. Further censuses were carried out in 1801, 1845 and 1865. The 1703 exercise was the first ever census to cover all inhabitants of an entire country, mentioning the name, age and social position of each individual. All of the information still exists, although some of the original documents have been lost.

The setting up, in 1952, of the [[National Registry of Iceland|National Registry]] (''Þjóðskrá'') eliminated the need for censuses. All those born in Iceland, and all new residents, are automatically registered. Individuals are identified in the registry by means of a [[national identification number]] (the so-called ''[[kennitala]]''), a number composed of the date of birth in the format ddmmyy and four additional digits, the third of which is a control digit, and the last of which indicates the century in which the person was born (9 for the 1900s and 0 for the 2000s).

The National Registry doubles as an [[electoral register]]. Likewise, all bank accounts are linked to the national identification of the owner (companies and institutions all have their own identification numbers).

=== India ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Parsi]] --&gt;
{{Main|Demographics of India}}
The decennial census of [[India]] is the primary source of information about the demographic characteristics of the [[population of India]]. The 2011 census will be one of the largest censuses in the history of mankind.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnaindia.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_census-2011-kicks-off-today_1366020 |title=Census-2011 kicks off today - India - DNA |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first census in India in modern times was conducted in 1872. First regular census was started in 1881 by Lord Rippon.Since then, a population census has been carried out every [[decennial|10 years]]. The [[15th Indian national census|latest census]] commenced on 1 May 2010. It will create a [[National Population Register]] with photographs and fingerprints of every resident. All usual residents of India will also be provided with their Unique ID numbers and [[National Identity Card]]s.
The census is carried out by the office of the [[Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India]], [[Delhi]], an office in the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, under the 1948 Census of India Act. The act gives Central Government many powers like to notify a date for Census, power to ask for the services of any citizen for census work. The law makes it compulsory for every citizen to answer the census questions truthfully. The Act provides penalties for giving false answers or not giving answers at all to the census questionnaire. One of the most important provisions of law is the guarantee for the maintenance of secrecy of the information collected at the census of each individual. The census records are not open to inspection and also not admissible in evidence.

The census is conducted in two phases: first, house listing and house numbering phase and second, the actual population enumeration phase. The census is carried out by the canvassing method. In this method, each and every household is visited and the information is collected by specially trained enumerator. They collect data related to households e.g. number of members, water &amp; electricity supply, ownership of land, vehicles, computers and other assets and services.  In the second phase, total population is counted and statistics related to individuals are collected.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnaindia.com&quot;/&gt;

=== Indonesia ===
The first population census was done during the colonial era, 1930. Before that, a non-overall census was already conducted in 1920. After that census was done irregularly. The first census after independence was 1961, followed by 1971. Since 1980 it is conducted regularly every 10 years. In between, there is also economical census (every 10 years, five years after population census) and agricultural census (three years after population census).The last census was held on May 2010.

===Iran===
''Main article:'' [[Demographics of Iran]]

The Statistical Center of Iran carries out nationwide population and housing censuses every 10 years, the last of which occurred in 2006 (1385 [[Iranian calendar|AP]]). In the Islamic Republic of Iran, based on Article 4 of the Act of the Statistical Center of Iran (SCI), the census shall be implemented once every 10 years according to the Presidential decree. So far there have been 6 incidences of population census in Iran in the years 1956, 1966, 1976, 1986, 1996, and 2006; all taken in accordance with scientific methods.

===Ireland===
The census in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] is carried out by the [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/census/default.htm|title=CSO Census Home Page|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The census is carried out every five years, with more detailed information collected in years ending in 1 and less in the years ending in 6. The 1976 census was canceled as a cost-saving measure, but a supplementary census was held in 1979 after it became apparent that the 1970s had seen major demographic changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irisheu-silc.net/census/Historical_Perspective.htm|title=Census: Historical perspective|publisher=CSO|accessdate=2008-10-09}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The census scheduled for 2001 was postponed until 2002 due to [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/census/Commentary.htm|title=Census 2002 Results |year=2002|publisher=CSO|accessdate=2008-10-09 |quote=The census originally planned for 29 April 2001 was postponed because of the Foot and Mouth disease situation pertaining at the time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent census took place on 23 April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/2006PreliminaryReport.pdf|title=Census 2006: Preliminary Report|date=July 2006|publisher=CSO|accessdate=2008-10-09|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2006 form, &quot;any person who fails or refuses to provide information or who knowingly provides false information may be subject to a fine of up to €25,000,&quot; under the Central Statistics Act 1993. On the CSO website, instructions for non-[[English Language|English]] speaking residents of Ireland were available. They were mock copies of the census forms, with all headings/questions etc. being translated into a particular language. These were not to be filled out, but were only a guide on how to fill out the English or Irish form. This census also asked two new questions relating to ownership of PCs and [[Internet]] connection.

Data from the Census of Ireland, 1901 and [[Census of Ireland, 1911|1911 Census of Ireland]] were made publicly available in 1961,&lt;ref name=&quot;oldrecords&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/census/Access_to_Records.htm|title=Access to old records|publisher=CSO|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are published online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/|title=Census of Ireland, Dublin 1911|publisher=National Archives of Ireland|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent census records will be made publicly available 100 years after collection.&lt;ref name=&quot;oldrecords&quot;/&gt; In June 2010, the 1901 census of Ireland became available on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideireland.ie/index.cfm/section/news/ext/census001/category/1062 |title=1901 Census of Ireland goes online |publisher=Insideireland.ie |date= |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions relating to the ability to speak the [[Irish Language]] are included in the census. The figures obtained have been criticised as inflated by [[cognitive bias]]es, such as [[response bias]] or [[wishful thinking]]. The 2006 census included an additional question on frequency of speaking Irish.

There are some calls for a boycott to the 2011 Census&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/census-2011-operators-abu-ghraib-caci-2011-03/|title=The Journel.ie: CSO calls criticism of Census 2011 contractor “irresponsible”|accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the Irish Central Statistics Office (CSO) has outsourced the printing, hardware, software and related technical support to CACI.

===Israel===
The first census in the state of [[Israel]] was held in November 1948, six months after its creation, to establish the [[population registry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isr1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/mifkad/census2008_e.pdf|title=The 2008 Israel Integrated Census of Population and Housing: Basic conception and procedure|last=Kamen|first= Charles S.|date=February, 2005|publisher=Israel Central Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=2008-10-12 |format=PDF |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent censuses were conducted by the [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] (ICBS) in 1961, 1972, 1983 and 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;isr1&quot;/&gt; In these, 20% of households completed a detailed survey and the remainder a shorter questionnaire.&lt;ref name=&quot;isr1&quot;/&gt; There is no legal requirement to hold a census within a given interval; in practice, the ICBS requests and the government decides.&lt;ref name=&quot;isr1&quot;/&gt; The next Census to be held was postponed from 2006 to late 2008/early 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;isr1&quot;/&gt; Only the detailed survey of 20% will be carried out, as a cost-saving measure.&lt;ref name=&quot;isr1&quot;/&gt;

===Italy===
The census in [[Italy]] is carried out by [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] every [[decennial|10 years]]. The last four were in 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001.

===Japan===
{{Main|Demographics of Japan}}
[[Japan]] collects census information every five years. The exercise is conducted by the Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. October 1, 2010 is Population Census Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Population Census 2010
 | publisher = Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications
 | url = http://www.stat.go.jp/data/kokusei/2010/special/english/index.htm
 | year = 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The census-form solicits information on name, gender, relationship to head of household, year and month of birth, marital status, nationality, number of members of household, type and nature of dwelling, floor area of dwelling, number of hours worked during the week prior to October 1, employment status, name of employer and type of business, and kind of work.

Regardless of nationality, all residents in Japan are required to complete the census form. Census form is only written in Japanese, but translation is available upon request in 27 different languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;japan.001&quot;&gt;[http://www.city.setagaya.tokyo.jp/toukei/gaikokugo/English.pdf ]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online census is only available in Japanese.

All information collected by census is confidential and protected by Statistics Act. Information provided by census can never be used for any investigation purposes such as immigration control, police investigation, tax collections and so on.&lt;ref name=&quot;japan.001&quot; /&gt; After the census, all forms are destroyed and recycled.

In [[Tokyo]], people can choose to answer the census questions by filling out the paper form, or they can choose to answer census questions online. Unique ID and password are provided with the census form. The online census form is only available for residents of Tokyo. This is because a high concentration of people in Tokyo are living in [[apartment buildings]] or [[gated communities]], which restricts the access of census workers.

===Jordan===
The first population census after the independence in 1946 was taken in 1952. It did only count the number of people in the households and could therefore be considered only to be a housing census. The first real complete census was taken in 1961. The following censuses have been taken in 1979, 1994 and 2004. The distribution of [[Palestinians]] and [[Jordanians]] within the population has been a politically sensitive issue since the [[Six-Day war]] in 1967.

===Kenya===
Census in [[Kenya]] was first held in 1948, when Kenya was still a Colony administrated by the British. Since 1969 census has been taken every ten years. The last census to date was in 2009.

Conducting a census since then has been complicated by various conflicts in the 1970s and 1980s&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/lebanon/34.htm Lebanon]. Country studies.&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as by the sensitivity of religious issues&lt;ref name=&quot;AJECensus&quot; /&gt;.

===Macedonia===
The foundation of the Republic of Macedonia followed the break up of the former Yugoslav Republic in 1991. The first population and housing census was taken in the summer 1994. The second census was taken in the autumn 2002. Both censuses were observed by international experts due to the sensitive issue regarding the ethnic distribution (Macedonian vs Albanian population).

===Mauritius===
Population and housing censuses for Mauritius was collected in 1972, 1983, and 2000; although respondents were asked to identify their race/ethnic origin in the 1972 census, this question was dropped from the following censuses because &quot;the government felt that it was a divisive question&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statssa.gov.za/asc/WebsiteReports/Mauritius.pdf &quot;2010 Round of Censuses: Learning from the 2000 Round Country position: Mauritius February 2006&quot;] .

The census that was planned for 1981 was postponed and later cancelled. A call for privacy was responsible for the cancellation of any further census since 1991. Censuses are being conducted by the [[Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek]] since 1899. The censuses today are mostly (population, fiscal) register based, combined with surveying.

===New Zealand===
The census in [[New Zealand]] is carried out by [[Statistics New Zealand]] (Tatauranga Aotearoa), on each year ending in a 6 or a 1 (every five years). The last was on 7 March 2006.

The censuses covered only the southern part of the country except for the 1952 census which was country wide, and the censuses before 1921 were based on administrative estimates rather than on an actual enumeration.

Censuses during the independence were taken 1963, 1973, 1991 and 2006. The results from 1973 and 2006 were highly disputed. The preliminary results for 2006 indicates a population of 140,000,000. 700,000 enumerators were engaged in this operation.

===Norway===
The two first male censuses was conducted during  the 1660s and 1701.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhd.uit.no/nhdc/census.html#male |title=Documenting the Norwegian Censuses: The male censuses of the 1660s and 1701 |publisher=Rhd.uit.no |date=2004-11-10 |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later statistical censuses were held in 1769, 1815, 1835, 1845, and 1855. Norway’s first nominative, complete census was taken in 1801, when Norway still was ruled by the Oldenburg dynasty of [[Denmark-Norway]]. The scope of the census followed the de jure principle, so military persons should be included as well as foreigners if they were residents. The 1801, 1865, 1900 and 1910 censuses are transcribed and made searchable on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalarkivet.no/cgi-win/WebFront.exe?slag=vis&amp;tekst=meldingar&amp;spraak=e |title=The Digital Archives |publisher=Regional State Archives in Bergen |date= |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The census records are made publicly available when 100 years have passed. Since 1900, a census has been conducted every ten years. (However, the 1940 census was postponed to 1946, and the census after 1990 came in 2001.) Since 2001 the population census has been combined with the housing statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssb.no/fob_en/ |title=Population and Housing Census 2001 |language={{no icon}} |publisher=Ssb.no |date= |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 questionnaire only asked about households and who was living in them, while no questionnaires will be mailed out for the 2011 census, since the administrative data on households is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssb.no/magasinet/blandet/art-2010-10-15-01.html|title=Datainnsamling: Folketellingen som forsvant?|date=15 October 2010|publisher=Statistisk sentralbyrå|language=Norwegian|accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serbia===
The census ordinarily takes place every 10 years. The last census was in 2002 (although having been planned for 2001), the previous one was in 1991 and the next is planned for 2011. The censuses before were organized in 1981, 1971, 1961, 1953 and 1948, during [[Communist Yugoslavia]]. During the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], censuses were conducted in 1931 and 1921; the census in 1941 was never conducted due to the outbreak of WWII.

The independent [[Princedom of Serbia]], had conducted the first population census in 1834; the subsequent censuses were conducted in 1841, 1843, 1846, 1850, 1854, 1859, 1863 and 1866 and 1874. During the era [[Kingdom of Serbia]], six censuses were conducted starting on 1884 and the last one being in 1910. And then the frequent wars had prevented organizing any census prior to the Yugoslav one in 1921.

For the portions of Serbia ruled by [[Austria-Hungary]] until 1918, there were a total of 5 Austro-Hungarian censuses - 1910, 1900, 1890, 1880 and 1869, immediately after the Dual Monarchy's constitution.

===Switzerland===
{{Main|Swiss census}}
In [[Switzerland]], the ''Federal Population Census'' ({{lang-de|Eidgenössische Volkszählung}}, {{lang-fr|Recensement fédéral de la population}}, {{lang-it|Censimento federale della popolazione}}, {{lang-rm|Dumbraziun federala dal pievel}}) has been carried out every 10 years starting in 1850. The census was initiated by [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Councillor]] [[Stefano Franscini]], who evaluated the data of the first census all by himself after Parliament failed to provide the necessary funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/infothek/erhebungen__quellen/blank/blank/vz/geschichte.html History of the Federal Population Census], Swiss Federal Statistical Office. Retrieved October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The census is now being conducted by the [[Federal Statistical Office (Switzerland)|Swiss Federal Statistical Office]].

Data being collected include population data (citizenship, place of residence, place of birth, position in household, number of children, religion, languages, education, profession, place of work, etc.), household data (number of individuals living in the household, etc.), accommodation data (surface area, amount of rent paid, etc.) and building data (geo[[coordinate]]s, time of construction, number of floors, etc.). Participation is compulsory and reached 99.87% of the population in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/infothek/erhebungen__quellen/blank/blank/vz/uebersicht.html Overview of the Federal Population Census], Swiss Federal Statistical Office. Retrieved October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2010, the census will cease to be conducted through written questionnaires distributed nationwide. Instead, data in existing population registers will be used. That data will be supplemented with a biannual questionnaire sample of 200,000 people as well as regular microcensuses.

===Syria===
The first population census in Syria was taken by the French Mandatory Regime in 1921-22. This is however not considered reliable. Censuses during independence have been taken 1947, 1960 (the first comprehensive demographic investigation), 1970, 1976 (a sample census), 1981, 1994 and 2004.

===Taiwan===
The first census in [[Taiwan]] was conducted in 1905, while [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan was under Japanese rule]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ind.org.tw/LIT_13/20010312.pdf The Modernization of Taiwan].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
The [[Turkey|Turkish]] census is run by the [[Turkish Statistical Institute]]. The first census in [[Turkey]] was conducted in 1927. After 1935, it took place every 5 years until 1990. Now, the census takes place every 10 years. The last census was in 2000. It can be noted that the census enumeration takes place on one single day in Turkey (in other countries it takes 1–2 weeks). This required some 900,000 enumerators in 2000. The 15th census based on improved geographical information systems is planned for 2010.

A census was taken in the [[Ottoman Empire]] 1831-38 by [[Sultan Mahmud II]] (1808–1839) as a part of the reform movement [[Tanzimat]]. [[Christian]] and [[Jewish]] men were counted but the female population was excluded.

===Uganda===
The first censuses in [[Uganda]] were taken in 1911, 1921 and 1931. It was done in a rather primitive way. The [[enumeration]] unit was 'huts' and not individuals. More scientific censuses were taken 1948 and 1959 where the enumeration unit was persons. The census was however divided into two separate enumerations, one for Africans, and one for the non-African population.
The censuses during independence 1969, 1980, 1991 were taken jointly for all races. The censuses 1980 and 1991 included housing information and in addition a larger questionnaire for a sample of the population. However, the questionnaires for the 1980 were lost and only provisional figures are available from this census.

The census in 2002 involved some 50,000 enumerators and supervisors. It covered several topics including: population and housing; agriculture; and Micro- and small Enterprises administered at individual/household level. The Preliminary Results were published two weeks after the enumeration. The Final Results were released in March
2005, while the analytical findings and the district level results were scheduled to be released in the second quarter of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statssa.gov.za/asc/WebsiteReports/Uganda.pdf &quot;Country submission for Uganda: The 2010 World Programme on Population and Housing Censuses&quot;], Africa Symposium on the 2010 Round of Population and Housing Censuses (Cape Town, South Africa, 30 January - 2 February 2006.

The first post-Soviet [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|Ukrainian Census]] was carried out by State Statistics Committee of Ukraine in 2001, 12 years after the last All-Union census in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/ |title=All-Ukrainian population census |publisher=Ukrcensus.gov.ua |date= |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Census in the United Kingdom}}

In the 7th century, [[Dál Riata]] was the first territory in what is now the UK to conduct a census.  The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 in England contained listings of households but its coverage was not complete and its intent was not the same as modern censuses.

Following the influence of [[Malthus]] and concerns stemming from his ''An Essay On The Principle Of Population'' the UK census as we know it today started in 1801. The census has been conducted every ten years since 1801 and most recently in 2011. 

The first four censuses (1801–1831) were mainly headcounts and contained little personal information. The 1841 Census, conducted by the General Register Office, was the first to record the names of everyone in a household or institution. From 1851 onwards the census shows the exact age and relationship to the head of household for each individual. Because of [[World War II]], there was no census in 1941. The actual census dates were 1841-06-06, 1851-03-30, 1861-04-07, 1871-04-02, 1881-04-03, 1891-04-05, 1901-03-31, 1911-04-02

The census of England &amp; Wales is undertaken for the government by the [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS). The General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) conducts its own census, while the census in Northern Ireland is carried out by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). Public access to the census returns is restricted under the terms of the 100-year rule; the most recent returns made available to researchers are those of the 1911 Census for England and Wales. The Scottish 1911 census will be available in 2011.

All of the British censuses from 1841-1911 have been transcribed and indexed and are available online, although GROS will not be releasing the Scottish 1911 returns until 2011. 

The [[United Kingdom Census 2011]] took place on 27 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census/default.asp National Statistics Website].&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|United States Census|2010 United States Census}}
The [[United States Constitution]] mandates that a census be taken every ten years in order to apportion the number of members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] among the several states. Census statistics are also used in order to apportion federal funding for many social and economic programs.

The first [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] was conducted in 1790 by [[United States Marshals Service|Federal marshals]]. Census takers went door to door and recorded the name of the head of the household and the number of people in each household. Slaves were enumerated, but only [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three out of five]] were counted for [[apportionment]]. [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], being neither taxed nor considered during apportionment, were not counted in the census. The first census counted 3.9 million people, less than half the population of [[New York City]] in 2000.

During the 19th century and through the 1940 census, enumeration was accomplished through political districts. Each [[political ward|ward]] was responsible for producing a census. The usual method in urban areas was to assign the task to [[precinct]] leaders, who in turn would hire and send out &quot;census takers&quot;, equipped with pencils, a sheaf of forms, and assigned areas to canvass door-by-door. These census takers would return their forms to the precinct office, which forwarded them to the ward office, where the pencilled-in data was transcribed in ink to bound volumes. This transcription process resulted in numerous misspellings if the worker's handwriting was hard to read, as well as omissions of people who were not home on the day the canvasser was sent out. In rural areas, canvassers often had to cover miles of uninhabited rural territory to find small towns and isolated farms, missing many or simply refusing to travel the full distances required for one day's pay. Canvasser supervisors often were unaware of data omissions due to the intentional isolation of many people in the countryside.

From 1950 onward, census forms were mailed to every address on record with the [[United States Post Office]], including the Armed Services Postal System, in an effort to enhance completeness of the data collected. Beginning in 1970, it was made illegal to fail to return a completed census form, which many were discovered to have done in the previous two decades' censuses. Canvassers came to be used only to verify a random sample of censuses received, and to attempt to complete records for people who still failed to return their census forms on time. Additionally in 1970, computer technology was introduced to consolidate the individual-completed census forms and canvassers' followup forms, in lieu of pen-and-ink transcriptions to official census ledgers.

The 2000 census counted over 281 million people. In 1891, the building containing the accumulated census records for 1890 caught fire, destroying all but a few pages of that decade's census: canvassers records were routinely destroyed once transferred to the official ledgers. In 1902, Congress established the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] as a [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agency]].

In recent times, there have been two forms of questionnaire, long and short. The long form and its additional questions about matters such as daily commute times, housing unit factors, etc., has been replaced by the [[American Community Survey]] (ACS). Computer [[algorithm]]s (based on complex sampling rules) determined which form was mailed to a given household, with one in six receiving the long form. This was supplemented by census workers going door to door to talk to those who failed to return the forms. In addition to a simple count of residents, the Census Bureau collects a variety of statistics, on topics ranging from [[ethnicity]] to the presence of indoor [[plumbing]]. While some critics claim that census questions are an invasion of privacy,&lt;ref name=&quot;sunderland2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

Despite a massive effort, the Census Bureau has never been able to count every individual, leading to controversy about whether to use statistical methods to supplement the numbers for some purposes, as well as arguments over how to improve the actual head count. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that only an actual head count can be used to apportion Congressional seats; however, cities and minority representatives have complained that urban residents and minorities are undercounted. In several cases, the Census Bureau has recounted an area with disputed figures, provided the local government paid for the time and effort. The state of [[Utah]] protested the figures of the 2000 decennial census because it stood to gain a seat in the House of Representatives, but [[North Carolina]] gained it instead. Had the Census Bureau been mandated to count the numbers of Utahns living overseas, including many [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormon]] [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionaries]], Utah might have gained the seat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DF1E3AF934A15752C1A9679C8B63 Justices Deal Utah a Setback In Its Bid to Gain a House Seat].&lt;/ref&gt;

To minimize the burden on individuals and to provide improved data, the Bureau has prepared several alternate methods for gathering economic, demographic, and social information, including the [[American Community Survey]] and [[record linking]] of depersonalized administrative records with other administrative records and Census Bureau surveys.

By law (92 Stat. 915, Public Law 95-416, enacted on October 5, 1978), individual census records are sealed for 72 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/history/www/legislation/010938.html U.S. Census Bureau | History | Legislation 1974 - 1983].&lt;/ref&gt; This figure has remained unchanged since before the 1978 law, reflecting an era when life expectancy was under 60 years,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and thus attempts to protect individuals' privacy by prohibiting the release of personal information during individuals' lifetimes. The individual census data most recently released to the public was the 1930 census, released in 2002. Aggregate census data are released when available.

In addition to the decennial federal census, local censuses have also been conducted, for example, in [[Massachusetts]], which conducted a statewide census every five years until 1985. Additionally, each community in Massachusetts takes a municipal census each year. Some states conducted limited censuses for various purposes, and these are typically located in state archives.

'''[[Chemistry]]''' is the [[science]] of [[matter]] at the [[atom]]ic to [[molecular]] scale, dealing primarily with  collections of atoms, such as [[molecule]]s, [[crystal]]s, and [[metal]]s.  Chemistry deals with the composition and statistical properties of such structures, as well as their transformations and interactions to become materials encountered in everyday life. Chemistry also deals with understanding the properties and interactions of individual atoms with the purpose of applying that knowledge at the [[macroscopic]] level. According to modern chemistry, the physical properties of materials are generally determined by their structure at the atomic scale, which is itself defined by interatomic forces.

The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to chemistry:

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]], '''[[critical theory]]''' has two quite different meanings with different origins and histories, one originating in [[social theory]] and the other in [[literary criticism]].  The former is theory oriented toward critiquing and changing [[society]] as a whole, in contrast to traditional theory oriented only to understanding or explaining it.  The latter is theory used in the critical analysis and understanding of literature and is discussed in greater detail under [[literary theory]].

The '''Cotswolds''' are a range of [[hill]]s in west-central England, sometimes called the &quot;Heart of England&quot;, an area {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} across and {{convert|90|mi|km|0}} long. The area has been designated as the Cotswold [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. The highest point in the Cotswolds range is [[Cleeve Hill]] at {{convert|1083|ft|m|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleevecommon.org.uk/200702/about-land.html|title=Landscape|publisher=Cleeve Common|accessdate=12 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|2.5|mi|km|0}} to the north of [[Cheltenham]]. 

The Cotswolds lie mainly within the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] of [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Oxfordshire]], but extend into parts of [[Wiltshire]], [[Somerset]], [[Worcestershire]] and [[Warwickshire]].

==Toponymy==
The name Cotswold is sometimes attributed the meaning &quot;sheep enclosure in rolling hillsides&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/booksid=FnyMWqlgw8QC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;dq=cotswolds+etymology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RM1QlZC8DH&amp;sig=7cQr_TwaOWC_YxJP78bLRDFwJuo Let's Go Britain]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=apcmAAAAMAAJ | title= ‪Local etymology: a derivative dictionary of geographical names‬ | first= Richard Stephen ‬ | last= Charnock | publisher= Houlston and Wright | year= 1859‬ | pages= 76}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
incorporating the term &quot;[[The Wolds|wold]]&quot; meaning hills. The [[English Place-Name Society]] has for many years accepted that the term Cotswold is derived from ''Codesuualt'' of the twelfth century or other variations on this form, the etymology of which was given 'Cod's-wold', which is 'Cod's high open land'.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A. H. 1964 The Place-Names of Gloucestershire, part 1: The Rivers and Road-names, the East Cotswolds, Cambridge, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Cod was interpreted as an Old English personal name, which can be recognised in further names: [[Cutsdean]], Codeswellan, and Codesbyrig, some of which date back to the eighth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Smith A. H. 1964 The Place-Names of Gloucestershire part 2: The North and West Cotswolds, Cambridge pp.7-8&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently been noticed that &quot;Cod&quot; could philologically derive from a Brittonic female cogname &quot;Cuda&quot;, which is the name of a mother goddess recognised in the Cotswold region.&lt;ref&gt;Yeates, S. J. 2008 The Tribe of Witches: The Religion of the Dobunni and the Hwicce pp.11-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yeates, S.

==Description==
[[image:Bibury Cottages in the Cotswolds - June 2007.jpg|thumb|Bibury: a typical Cotswold Village]]
The spine of the Cotswolds runs south west to north east through six counties, particularly Gloucestershire, west Oxfordshire, and south western Warwickshire. The northern and western edges of the Cotswolds are marked by steep [[escarpment]]s down to the [[River Severn|Severn valley]] and the [[River Avon, Warwickshire|Warwickshire Avon]]. This escarpment or scarp feature, sometimes called the '''Cotswold Edge''', is a result of the uplifting (tilting) of the limestone layer, exposing its broken edge.&lt;ref name=&quot;cotsstone&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecotswoldgateway.co.uk/cotswoldstone.htm|title=Cotswold Stone|publisher=Cotswold Gateway|accessdate=12 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a [[cuesta]], in [[geology|geological]] terms. The [[dip slope]] is to the south east. On the eastern boundary lies the city of [[Oxford]] and on the west is [[Stroud, England|Stroud]]. To the south-east the upper reaches of the [[Thames Valley]] and towns such as [[Lechlade]], [[Tetbury]] and [[Fairford]] are often considered to mark the limit of this region. To the south the Cotswolds, with the characteristic uplift of the Cotswold Edge, reach beyond [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and towns such as [[Chipping Sodbury]] and [[Marshfield, South Gloucestershire|Marshfield]] share elements of Cotswold character.

The area is characterised by attractive small [[town]]s and [[village]]s built of the underlying ''[[Cotswold stone]]'' (a yellow [[oolite|oolitic]] [[limestone]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;cotsstone&quot;/&gt; This limestone is rich in [[fossils]], in particular fossilised [[sea urchins]]. In the [[Middle Ages]] the [[wool]] trade made the Cotswolds prosperous. Some of this money was put into the building of [[Church (building)|churches]] so the area has a number of large handsome Cotswold stone &quot;[[wool church]]es&quot;. The area remains affluent and has attracted wealthy people who own [[Vacation property|second homes]] in the area or have chosen to retire there.

Cotswold towns include [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], [[Broadway, Worcestershire|Broadway]], [[Burford]],  [[Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire|Chipping Norton]], [[Cirencester]], [[Moreton-in-Marsh]], [[Northleach]], [[Stow-on-the-Wold]], [[Stroud, Gloucestershire|Stroud]] and [[Winchcombe]]. The town of [[Chipping Campden]] is notable for being the home of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], founded by [[William Morris]] at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtbarn.org.uk/history|title=History |publisher=Court Barn Museum|accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Morris lived occasionally in [[Broadway Tower]] a folly now part of a country park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldswebsite.com/broadway-tower.htm|title=Broadway Tower|publisher=Cotswold website|accessdate=12 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chipping Campden is also known for the annual [[Cotswold Olimpick Games]], a celebration of sports and games dating back to the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=862|title=Origins of Robert Dover's Games |publisher=Olympick Games|accessdate=12 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty==
[[Image:Cotswolds Cleeve Common.jpg|thumb|From Cleeve Common, near the highest point in the Cotswolds]]
The Cotswolds were designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB) in 1966, with an expansion on 21 December 1990 to {{convert|1990|km2|sqmi|0}}. In 1991, all AONBs were measured again using modern methods. The official area of the Cotswolds AONB increased to {{convert|2038|km2|sqmi|0}}. In 2000, the government confirmed that AONBs had the same landscape quality and status as National Parks.&lt;ref name=&quot;aonb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?page=AONB|title=AONB|publisher=Cotswolds AONB|accessdate=12 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Cotswolds AONB, which is the largest in England and Wales, stretches from the border regions of South Warwickshire and Worcestershire, through West Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire and takes in parts of Wiltshire, and [[Bath and North East Somerset]] in the South.
Gloucestershire County Council is responsible for 63 per cent of the AONB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/aonb/cotswolds.aspx Cotswolds] ''[[Natural England]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cotswolds Conservation Board is the organisation that exists to conserve and enhance the AONB. Established in 2004, the board carries out a range of work from securing funding for 'on the ground' conservation projects to providing a strategic overview of the area for key decision makers, such as planning officials. The board is an independent organisation funded by Natural England and the 17 local authorities that sit within the AONB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?page=ccb|title=Cotswolds Conservation Board|publisher=Cotswolds AONB|accessdate=12 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the beauty of the Cotswold AONB is intertwined with the villages that seem to almost grow out of the landscape, the Cotswolds were primarily designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] for the rare limestone grassland habitats as well as the old growth beech woodlands that typify the area. These habitat areas are also the last refuge for many other flora and fauna with some so endangered they are protected under the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]]. [[Cleeve Hill]], and its associated commons, is a fine example of a limestone grassland and it is one of the few locations where the Duke of Burgundy butterfly can still be found in abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Areas - 55 Cotswolds|url=http://www.naturalareas.naturalengland.org.uk/science/natural/NA_Details.asp?NA_Id=55|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The uniqueness and value of the Cotswolds is engendered in the fact that five European [[Special Areas of Conversation]], three [[National Nature Reserves]] and over 80 [[Sites of Specific Interest]] are contained within the Cotswold AONB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cotswold AONB|url=http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?page=aonb|publisher=Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Cotswold Voluntary Wardens]] Service, now part of the Cotswolds Conservation Board, was established in 1968 to help conserve and enhance the area and now has over 300 wardens.

The [[Cotswold Way]] is a long-distance footpath, approximately {{convert|103|mi|km|0}} long, running the length of the AONB mainly on the edge of the Cotswold escarpment with views over the [[Severn Valley (England)|Severn Valley]] and the [[Vale of Evesham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/Cotswold/text.asp?PageId=2 | title= Cotswold Way - About this trail | work= National Trail | accessdate= 2007-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
[[Image:Cotswold roads 1933.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map of Cotswolds roads from 1933]]
The Cotswolds lies between the [[M5 motorway|M5]], [[M40 motorway|M40]] and [[M4 motorway]]s. The main non-motorway roads through the area are the [[A46 road|A46]]: [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] — [[Stroud, Gloucestershire|Stroud]] — [[Cheltenham]]; the [[A419 road|A419]]: [[Swindon]] — [[Cirencester]] — Stroud; the [[A429 road|A429]]: Cirencester — [[Stow-on-the-Wold]] — [[Moreton-in-Marsh]]; and the [[A40 road|A40]]: [[Oxford]] — [[Burford]] — Cheltenham. These all roughly follow the routes of ancient roads, some laid down by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], such as [[Ermin Street]] and the [[Fosse Way]].

The area is bounded by two major rail routes: in the south by the main [[Great Western Main Line|Bristol-Bath-London High Speed line]] and in the west by the [[Cross Country Route (MR)|Bristol-Birmingham main line]]. In addition, the [[Cotswold Line]] runs through the Cotswolds from Oxford to [[Worcester]], and the [[Golden Valley Line]] runs from Swindon to [[Gloucester]], carrying high speed and local services.

Main-line, high-speed rail services to the big cities run from stations such as [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], Swindon, Oxford, Cheltenham and Worcester. High-speed services to London are also available from [[Kemble railway station|Kemble station]] near Cirencester, [[Kingham railway station|Kingham station]] near Stow-on-the-Wold, [[Charlbury railway station|Charlbury station]] and [[Moreton-in-Marsh railway station|Moreton-in-Marsh station]].

Cheltenham, which is located just West of the Cotswolds, is a hub for [[National Express]] coach services. There are local bus services across the area, but some are infrequent. The best sources of information are the Gloucestershire County Council website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gloucestershire.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=12503 Cotswold bus times]&lt;/ref&gt; or local [[Visitor center|tourist information centres]].

==The Cotswolds in cultural life and media==

The Cotswold region has inspired some of England's finest composers. In the early 1900s, [[Herbert Howells]] and [[Ivor Gurney]] used to go for long walks together over the hills and Gurney urged Howells to make the landscape, including the nearby [[Malvern Hills]], the inspiration for his future work. True to his word, in 1916, Howells wrote his first major piece, the Piano Quartet in A minor, inspired by the magnificent view of the [[Malvern Hills|Malverns]] - it was dedicated to &quot;the hill at Chosen ([[Churchdown]]) and Ivor Gurney who knows it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://uk.geocities.com/supernaturaltv/long_remembered_hills.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+04:31:19  Long Remembered Hills] How the English composers Ivor Gurney and Herbert Howells were influenced by the Gloucestershire countryside.&lt;/ref&gt; Another contemporary of theirs, [[Gerald Finzi]], lived in nearby [[Painswick]]. The film ''[[Better Things (2008 film)|Better Things]]'', directed by Duane Hopkins, is set in a small Cotswold village. The fictional [[Agatha Raisin]] lives in the fictional village of Carsely in the Cotswolds.

The club is nicknamed alternatively ''Gialloblu'', ''Mussi volanti'' or ''Ceo'', and shares the 38,402 seater [[Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi|Marcantonio Bentegodi]] stadium with its cross-town rivals [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Hellas Verona]].

==History==
===Early years===
The team was founded in 1929 by a small number of football fans from the small borough of Chievo, a Verona neighbourhood. Initially the club was not officially affiliated to the Italian Football Federation but played several amateur tournament and friendly matches under the denomination &quot;O.N.D. Chievo&quot;, a title imposed by the fascist regime. The club's formal debut in an official league was on 8 November 1931. The team colours at the time were blue and white. Chievo disbanded in 1936 because of economic woes but returned to play in 1948 after World War II, being registered in the regional league of &quot;Seconda Divisione&quot; (Second Division). In 1957 the team moved to the &quot;Carlantonio Bottagisio&quot; parish field, where they played until 1986. In 1959, after the restructuring of the football leagues, Chievo was admitted to play the &quot;Seconda Categoria&quot; (Second Category), a regional league placed next-to-last in the Italian football pyramid. That year, Chievo changed its name to &quot;Cardi Chievo&quot;, after a new sponsor, and was quickly promoted to the &quot;Prima Categoria&quot;, from which it experienced its first-ever relegation in 1962.

===Series of promotions===
In 1964, Luigi Campedelli, a businessman and owner of the Paluani company, was named new Chievo chairman. Under Campedelli's presidency, Chievo climbed through the entire Italian football pyramid, reaching the [[Serie D]] after the 1974/1975 season. Under the name &quot;Paluani Chievo&quot;, the team was promoted to [[Serie C|Serie C2]] in 1986. As a consequence of promotion, Chievo was forced to move to the [[Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi]], the main venue in Verona; another promotion, to Serie C1, followed in 1989. In 1990, the team changed its name to its current one, &quot;A.C. ChievoVerona&quot;.

In 1992, President Luigi Campedelli, who had returned at the helm of the club two years before, died of a heart attack, and his son [[Luca Campedelli]], aged just 23, became the new and youngest chairman of an Italian professional football club. Campedelli promoted [[Giovanni Sartori (footballer)|Giovanni Sartori]] to Director of Football and named [[Alberto Malesani]] as the new head coach. Under Malesani, the team astonishingly won the Serie C1 and was promoted to [[Serie B]], where city rival [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Hellas Verona]] was playing at the time. In 1997, after Malesani signed for [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed the new head coach. The following season, with [[Domenico Caso]] as the coach, saw the first dismissal of a coach during the presidency of Luca Campedelli, with Caso being fired and replaced with [[Lorenzo Balestro]].

In 2000/2001 [[Luigi Delneri]] was signed as coach and led Chievo, by virtue of its third-place finish in Serie B, to promotion to [[Serie A]], the first time in the team's history that it had reached the top tier of Italian football.

===Serie A times (2001–2007)===
In its 2001/2002 Serie A debut season Chievo, who were most critics' choice for an instant return to Serie B, became the surprise team in the league, playing often spectacular and entertaining football and even leading the league for six consecutive weeks. The club finally ended the season with a highly respectable fifth place finish, qualifying the team to play in the [[UEFA Cup]].

In 2002/2003, Chievo debuted at the European level but were eliminated in the first round by [[Red Star Belgrade]]. The team finished the Serie A season in seventh place, again proving itself one of the better Serie A teams. The 2003/2004 season, the last with Delneri at the helm, saw Chievo finish in ninth place.

The 2004/2005 season is remembered as one of the toughest ever in Chievo's history. [[Mario Beretta]], a Serie A novice from [[Ternana Calcio|Ternana]], was named the coach but, after a good start which brought Chievo to a third place behind [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]], the team slowly lost position in the Serie A table. Three matches before the end of the season Chievo was third from last, a position which would see it relegated to Serie B. As a last resort Beretta was fired and [[Maurizio D'Angelo]], a former Chievo player, was appointed temporarily to replace him as coach. Morale improved, and two wins and a tie from the final three matches proved just enough to keep Chievo in Serie A.

In 2005/2006, [[Giuseppe Pillon]] of [[Treviso F.B.C. 1993|Treviso FBC]] was appointed as new coach. The team experienced a return to the successful Delneri era, both in style of play and results, which resulted in Chievo ending the season in a seventh place and gaining a place in the next UEFA Cup. However, because of the [[2006 Serie A scandal|football scandal]] involving several top-class teams, all of which finished higher than Chievo in the 2005/2006 season, the Flying Donkeys were awarded a place in the next [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] preliminary phase.

On 14 July 2006, the verdict in the scandal was made public. [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]] and [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], who had all originally qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League 2006-07|2006–07 Champions League]], and [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], who had originally qualified for the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07|2006–07 UEFA Cup]], were all banned from [[UEFA]] competition for the 2006/07 season, although AC Milan were allowed to enter the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] after their appeal to FIGC. Chievo took up a place in the third qualifying stage of the competition along with AC Milan and faced [[Bulgaria]]n side [[Levski Sofia]]. Chievo lost the first leg 2–0 in [[Sofia]] and managed a 2–2 home draw on the second leg and were eliminated by a 4–2 aggregate score with Levski advancing to the Champions League group stage. As a Champions League third round qualifying loser, Chievo was given a place in the [[UEFA Cup]] final qualifying round. On 25 August 2006 Chievo was drawn to face [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[S.C. Braga|Braga]]. The first leg, played on 14 September in [[Braga]], ended in a shock 2–0 win for the Portuguese side. The return match, played on 28 September in [[Verona]], although won by Chievo 2–1 resulted in a 3–2 aggregate loss and the club's elimination from the competition.

On 16 October 2006, following a 1–0 defeat against [[Torino F.C.]], head coach Giuseppe Pillon was fired, and replaced by [[Luigi Delneri]], one of the original symbols of the ''miracle Chievo'', who had led the club to Serie A in 2002.

On 27 May 2007, the last match day of the 2006–07 Serie A season, Chievo was one of five teams in danger of falling into the last undecided relegation spot. Needing only a tie against Catania, a direct competitor in the relegation battle, Chievo lost 2–0 playing on a neutral field in Bologna. Wins by Parma, Siena and Reggina condemned Chievo to Serie B for the 2007–08 season after six seasons in the senior league.

Even as a relatively successful Serie A team the club, which averages only 4-5000 fans and is kept afloat mainly by money from television rights, does not have the same level of fan support as Hellas – the real &quot;Gialloblu&quot; team of Verona. The difference between the clubs is high-lighted during local derby games played at the clubs' shared stadium when, for Chievo's &quot;home&quot; fixtures, the Chievo fans are located in away end of the stadium.

===A year with the ''Cadetti'' (2007–08)===
Chievo bounced back quickly from the disappointment of their relegation on the last matchday of 2006/07, going in search of an immediate promotion back to the top flight. After the expected departure of several top-quality players including [[Franco Semioli|Semioli]], [[Salvatore Lanna|Lanna]], [[Matteo Brighi|Brighi]], [[Paolo Sammarco|Sammarco]], [[Erjon Bogdani|Bogdani]] the manager Delneri also parted ways with the club. [[Giuseppe Iachini]] replaced him and the captain, [[Lorenzo D'Anna]], gave way to [[Sergio Pellissier]] at the end of the transfer window. A new squad was constructed, most notably including the arrivals of mid-fielders [[Maurizio Ciaramitaro]] and [[Simone Bentivoglio]], defender [[César de Luca|César &lt;small&gt;(César Cervo de Luca)&lt;/small&gt;]] and forward [[Antimo Iunco]]. This new incarnation of the 'gialloblu' were crowned Winter Champions (along with [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]]), en route to a 41st matchday promotion after a 1–1 draw at [[U.S. Grosseto F.C.|Grosseto]] left them four points clear of third-place [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]] with one match remaining. In addition to winning promotion they were conferred with the &quot;Ali della Vittoria&quot; trophy on the final matchday of the season, their first league title of any kind in fourteen years.

===Back in Serie A (2008–)===
In their first season back to the top flight, Chievo immediately struggled in the league resulting in the dismissal of Iachini in November and his replacement with former [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] boss [[Domenico Di Carlo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dicarlo_chievo&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=AC ChievoVerona|url=http://www.chievoverona.it/societa/notizia.aspx?P=0&amp;tipo=N&amp;ID=8136|title=LA SQUADRA AFFIDATA A DOMENICO DI CARLO. OGGI ALLE 14 LA PRESENTAZIONE|date=4 November 2008|accessdate=4 November 2008|language=Italian}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Di Carlo's appointment, Chievo managed a remarkable resurgence that led the ''gialloblu'' out of the relegation zone after having collected just 9 points from their first 17 matches. Highlight matches included a 3–0 defeat of [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] (who then won the [[2008–09 Coppa Italia]] title) at the [[Stadio Olimpico]], and a thrilling 3–3 draw away to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in which captain and long-time Chievo striker [[Sergio Pellissier]] scored a late equaliser to complete his first career hat-trick. A series of hard-fought draws against top clubs [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter]] and [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]] in the final stretch of the season solidified ''Ceo'''s position outside the drop zone and Serie A status was finally confirmed on matchday 37 with a home draw against [[Bologna F.C.|Bologna]]. A largely unchanged lineup earned safety the following season with 4 matchdays to spare, and Chievo is therefore a part of the inaugural [[Lega Calcio Serie A]] in 2010–11, their third consecutive season (and ninth season in the last ten years) in the top flight of Italian football.

==Colours and badge==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
The club's original colours were blue and white and not the current blue and yellow. The club's historic nickname is ''gialloblu'' (from the club colors of yellow and blue) although throughout Italian football the team recognised by most fans as &quot;Gialloblu&quot; are the original team from Verona – &quot;Hellas Verona&quot;.  The club is more often referred to today as the ''mussi volanti'' (&quot;flying donkeys&quot; in the Verona dialect of [[Venetian language|Venetian]]). Local supporters often call the club simply ''Ceo'', which is Veronese for Chievo. The &quot;flying donkeys&quot; nickname was originally a derogatory term from a match chant sung by fans from crosstown rivals [[Hellas Verona]], which said that &quot;donkeys would fly before Chievo made it to Serie A&quot;. However, with later successes by Chievo and contemporaneous [[Serie B]] and [[Serie C1]] struggles for Hellas Verona, Chievo fans have now largely embraced the nickname as a badge of honour.

The current club crest represents [[Cangrande I della Scala]], an ancient seignor from Verona.

==Supporters==

{{morefootnotes|date=November 2009}}
A '''context switch''' is the [[computing]] process of storing and restoring [[State (computer science)|state]] ([[Context (computing)|context]]) of a [[Central processing unit|CPU]] so that execution can be resumed from the same point at a later time. This enables multiple [[Process (computing)|process]]es to share a single [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. The context switch is an essential feature of a [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] [[operating system]].  Context switches are usually computationally intensive and much of the design of [[operating system]]s is to optimize the use
of context switches. A context switch can mean a [[Processor register|register]] context switch, a task context switch, a [[Thread (computer science)|thread]] context switch, or a process context switch. What constitutes the context is determined by the processor and the operating system. Switching from one process to another requires a certain amount of time for doing the administration - saving and loading registers and memory maps, updating various tables and list etc.

== When to switch? ==
There are three situations where a context switch needs to occur. They are:

=== Multitasking ===
Most commonly, within some [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] scheme, one process needs to be switched out of the CPU so another process can run. Within a [[preemptive multitasking]] operating system, the scheduler allows every task to run for some certain amount of time, called its ''[[time slice]]''.  

If a process does not voluntarily yield the CPU (for example, by performing an [[Input/Output|I/O]] operation), a timer interrupt fires, and the operating system schedules another process for execution instead. This ensures that the CPU cannot be monopolized by any one processor-intensive application.

=== Interrupt handling ===
Modern architectures are [[interrupt]] driven. This means that if the CPU requests data from a disk, for example, it does not need to [[busy-wait]] until the read is over; it can issue the request and continue with some other execution. When the read is over, the CPU can be ''interrupted'' and presented with the read. For interrupts, a program called an ''[[interrupt handler]]'' is installed, and it is the interrupt handler that handles the interrupt from the disk.

The [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] services the interrupts in the context of the interrupted process even though it may not have caused the interrupt. The interrupted process may have been executing in user mode or in kernel mode. The kernel saves enough information so that it can later resume execution of the interrupted process and services the interrupt in kernel mode. The kernel does not spawn or schedule a special process to handle interrupts.

=== User and kernel mode switching ===
When a transition between [[user mode]] and [[kernel mode]] is required in an operating system, a context switch is not necessary; a mode transition is ''not'' by itself a context switch.  However, depending on the operating system, a context switch may also take place at this time.

== Context switch: steps ==
In a switch, the state of the first process must be saved somehow, so that, when the scheduler gets back to the execution of the first process, it can restore this state and continue.

The state of the process includes all the registers that the process may be using, especially the [[program counter]], plus any other operating system specific data that may be necessary. This data is usually stored in a data structure called a [[process control block]] (PCB), or [[switchframe]]. 

In order to switch processes, the PCB for the first process must be created and saved. The PCBs are sometimes stored upon a per-process [[stack (computing)|stack]] in kernel memory (as opposed to the user-mode stack), or there may be some specific operating system defined data structure for this information.

Since the operating system has effectively suspended the execution of the first process, it can now load the PCB and context of the second process. In doing so, the program counter from the PCB is loaded, and thus execution can continue in the new process. New processes are chosen from a queue or queues. Process and thread priority can influence which process continues execution, with processes of the highest priority checked first for ready threads to execute.

== Software vs hardware context switching ==
Context switching can be performed primarily by software or hardware. Some processors, like the [[Intel 80386]] and more advanced CPUs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linfo.org/context_switch.html&lt;/ref&gt; have hardware support for context switches, by making use of a special data segment designated the [[Task State Segment]] or TSS.  A task switch can be explicitly triggered with a CALL or JMP instruction targeted at a TSS descriptor in the [[global descriptor table]] or the [[local descriptor table]].  It can occur implicitly when an interrupt or exception is triggered if there's a [[task gate]] in the [[interrupt descriptor table]].  When a task switch occurs the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] can automatically load the new state from the TSS. With other tasks performed in hardware, one would expect this to be rather fast; however, mainstream operating systems, including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Linux]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=h0lltXyJ8aIC&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=Linux%20hardware%20TSS&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q=Linux%20hardware%20TSS|title=Understanding the Linux Kernel, Third Edition|last1=Bovet|first1=Daniel Pierre|last2=Cesatí|first2=Marco|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]]|year=2006|page=104|accessdate=2009-11-23|isbn=9780596005658}}&lt;/ref&gt; do not use this feature. This is due mainly to two reasons: that hardware context switching does not save all the registers (only general purpose registers, not [[floating point]] registers—although the TS bit is automatically turned on in the CR0 [[control register]], resulting in a fault when executing floating point instructions and giving the OS the opportunity to do saving and restoring of the floating point state), and associated performance issues.

The extreme case is the [[barrel processor]] architecture, which switches between threads of execution on every cycle.

'''''Chakra''''' is a concept originating from [[Hindu texts]] and used in [[Hindu]] practices. Its name derives from the [[Sanskrit]] word for &quot;[[wheel]]&quot; or &quot;[[turning]]&quot; (''{{IAST|cakraṃ}}'' चक्रं {{IPA-sa|ˈtʃəkrə̃|}}, pronounced {{IPA-hns|ˈtʃəkrə|}} in Hindi; [[Pali]]: ''cakka'' चक्क, [[Thai Language|Thai]]: จักระ, [[Tamil Language|Tamil]]: சக்கரம், [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 轮, {{lang-bo|འཁོར་ལོ་}}; ''khorlo'').&lt;ref name=&quot;mahesh&quot;&gt;[[Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda]], The hidden power in humans, Ibera Verlag, page 54. ISBN 3-85052-197-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Chakra is a concept referring to wheel-like [[vortex|vortices]] which, according to traditional Indian medicine, are believed to exist in the surface of the [[etheric body|etheric double]] of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Charles Webster Leadbeater | title = The Chakras | page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chakras are said to be &quot;force centers&quot; or whorls of [[energy (esotericism)|energy]] permeating, from a point on the physical body, the layers of the [[subtle bodies]] in an ever-increasing fan-shaped formation. Rotating vortices of subtle [[matter]], they are considered the focal points for the reception and transmission of energies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = John Cross, Robert Charman | title = Healing with the Chakra Energy System | pages = 17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different systems posit a varying number of chakras; the most well known system in the West is that of seven chakras.

It is typical for chakras to be depicted as either flower-like or wheel-like. In the former, &quot;petals&quot; are shown around the perimeter of a circle. In the latter, spokes divide the circle into segments that make the chakra resemble a wheel (or &quot;chakra&quot;). Each chakra possesses a specific number of segments or petals.

Texts describing the chakras go back as far as the later [[Upanishads]], for example the Yoga Kundalini Upanishad.

== Definitions ==
[[File:Sapta Chakra, 1899.jpg|thumb|Sapta Chakra, from a Yoga manuscript in [[Braj Bhasa]] language with 118 pages (1899).]]

Although there are various interpretations as to what exactly a chakra is, the following features are common in all systems:
* They form part of a subtle energy body, along with the energy channels, or [[nadis]], and the subtle winds, or [[pranas]].
* They are located along a central nadi, [[Sushumna]], which runs either alongside or inside the spine.
* Two other nadis, [[Ida (yoga)|Ida]] and [[Pingala (yoga)|Pingala]], also run through the chakras, and alongside Sushumna. They occasionally cross Sushumna at the location of the chakras.
* They possess a number of 'petals' or 'spokes'. In some traditions, such as the Tibetan, these spokes branch off into the thousands of nadis that run throughout the human body.
* They are generally associated with a [[mantra|mantra]] seed-syllable, and often with a variety of colours and deities.

[[Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda]] describes a chakra as:&lt;ref&gt;[[Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda]], The hidden power in humans, Ibera Verlag, page 54, ISBN 3-85052-197-4&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;

...[a] powerhouse in the way it generates and stores energy, with the energy from cosmos pulled in more strongly at these points. The main [[Nadi (yoga)|nadi]]s, Ida, Pingala and Shushumna ([[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]], [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]], and [[central nervous system]]) run along the spinal column in a curved path and cross one another several times. At the points of intersection they form strong energy centers known as chakras. In the human body there are three types of energy centers. The lower or animal chakras are located in the region between the toes and the pelvic region indicating our evolutionary origins in the animal kingdom. The human chakras lie along the spinal column. Finally, the higher or divine Chakras are found between the top of the spine and the crown of the head. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Anodea Judith]] (1996: p.&amp;nbsp;5) provides a modern interpretation of the chakras:&lt;blockquote&gt;
A chakra is believed to be a center of activity that receives, assimilates, and expresses [[prana|life force energy]]. The word ''chakra'' literally translates as ''wheel'' or ''disk'' and refers to a spinning sphere of bioenergetic activity emanating from the major [[nerve]] [[ganglia]] branching forward from the [[spinal column]].
Generally, six of these wheels are described, stacked in a column of energy that spans from the base of the spine to the middle of the forehead, the seventh lying beyond the physical world. It is the six major chakras that correlate with basic states of [[higher consciousness|consciousness]]...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Susan Shumsky]] (2003, p.&amp;nbsp;24) states a similar idea:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Each chakra in your spinal column is believed to influence or even govern bodily functions near its region of the spine. Because autopsies do not reveal chakras, most people think they are a fancy of fertile imagination. Yet their [[existence]] is well documented in the traditions of the Far East...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chakras, as described above, are energy centers along the spine located at major branchings of the human nervous system, beginning at the base of the spinal column and moving upward to the top of the skull, through which pass 3 major energy channels, Sushumna, Ida and Pingala. Chakras are considered to be a point or [[Gap junction|nexus]] of [[biophysics|biophysical]] [[Energy (spirituality)|energy]] or ''[[prana]]'' of the [[human body]]. Shumsky states that &quot;prana is the basic component of your subtle body, your energy field, and the entire chakra system...the key to life and source of energy in the universe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Exploring Chakras, Susan G. Shumsky, The Career Press Inc., 2003, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following seven primary chakras are commonly described:

# [[Muladhara]] ({{lang-sa|मूलाधार, Mūlādhāra}}, Thai: มูลาธาระ) Base or Root Chakra (ovaries/prostate)
# [[Swadhisthana]] ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: स्वाधिष्ठान, {{IAST|Svādhiṣṭhāna}}, Thai: สฺวาธิษฺฐานะ) Sacral Chakra (last bone in spinal cord, [[coccyx|the coccyx]])
# [[Manipura]] ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: मणिपूर, {{IAST|Maṇipūra}}, Thai: มณีปูระ) Solar Plexus Chakra (navel area)
# [[Anahata]] ({{lang-sa|अनाहत, Anāhata}}, Thai: อนาหะตะ) Heart Chakra (heart area)
# [[Vishuddha]] ({{lang-sa|विशुद्ध, Viśuddha}}, Thai: วิศุทฺธะ) Throat Chakra (throat and neck area)
# [[Ajna]] ({{lang-sa|आज्ञा, Ājñā}}, Thai: อาชฺญา) Brow or Third Eye Chakra (pineal gland or third eye)
# [[Sahasrara]] ({{lang-sa|सहस्रार, Sahasrāra}}, Thai: สหัสฺราระ) Crown Chakra (top of the head; 'soft spot' of a newborn)

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In addition, a number of other chakras are postulated. B.K.S Iyengar&lt;ref&gt;B.K.S Iyengar. Light on Yoga&lt;/ref&gt; states that between the navel and the heart are the Manas (mind) and Surya (sun) chakras, and that at the top of the forehead is the Lalata chakra. The Tibetan tantric tradition has the Fire Wheel between the heart and the throat, the Wind Wheel on the forehead, and below the navel, instead of Swadhisthana and Muladhara, they have three chakras; the Secret Place Wheel is located four fingers below the navel, the Jewel Wheel is located on the sexual organ, and the very tip of the sexual organ is the very last chakra, where the central channel ends. Other traditions, such as the Bihar school of yoga, add Bindu chakra, which exists at the back of the head, and is where the divine nectar or Amrit is stored, place Lalata chakra in the roof of the mouth, and place Hrit chakra below the heart.

Many traditions posit a number of higher chakras in the head, which from lowest to highest are: golata, talu/talana/lalana, ajna, talata/lalata, manas, soma, sahasrara (and sri inside it).

== Models ==
The study of the chakras is a part of many philosophical and spiritual traditions, as well as many therapies and disciplines. In eastern traditions, the theory of chakras is a central part of the Hindu and Buddhist [[Tantras|tantra]], and they play an important role in attaining deep levels of realisation. [[Yoga]], [[Pranayama]], [[Acupuncture]], [[Shiatsu]], [[Tai Chi Chuan|Tai Chi]] and [[Chi Kung]] focus on balancing the energetic ''nadis'' or energy meridians which are an integral part of the chakra system.

In the West, the subtle energy of the chakras is explored through practices such as [[aromatherapy]], [[mantras]], [[Reiki]], [[Laying on of hands|hands-on healing]], [[flower essences]], [[radionics]], [[sound therapy]], [[chromotherapy|colour/light therapy]], and crystal/gem therapy.

=== Hindu Tantra===
[[File:Crown Brow Throat Chakras, Rajasthan 18th Century.jpg|thumb|Thousand Petalled Crown Chakra, Two Petalled Brow Chakra, Sixteen Petalled Throat Chakra (Nepal, 17th Century)]]

In [[Hinduism]], the concept of chakras is part of a complex of ideas related to [[esoteric]] [[anatomy]]. These ideas occur most often in the class of texts that are called [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Āgama]]s or [[Tantras]]. This is a large body of [[scripture]], most of which is rejected by the traditionalists. The chakras are described in the tantric texts the ''[[Sat-Cakra-Nirupana]]'', and the ''[[Padaka-Pancaka]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Woodroffe, ''The Serpent Power'', pp.317ff.&lt;/ref&gt; in which they are described as emanations of consciousness from Brahman, an energy emanating from the spiritual which gradually turns concrete, creating these distinct levels of chakras, and which eventually finds its rest in the [[Muladhara]] chakra. They are therefore part of an [[emanationism|emanationist theory]], like that of the [[kabbalah]] in the west, [[lataif-e-sitta]] in [[Sufism]] or [[neo-platonism]]. The energy that was unleashed in creation, called the [[Kundalini]], lies coiled and sleeping at the base of the spine. It is the purpose of the [[tantra|tantric]] or [[kundalini yoga|kundalini]] forms of [[yoga]] to arouse this energy, and cause it to rise back up through the increasingly [[Subtle body|subtle]] chakras, until union with God is achieved in the [[Sahasrara]] chakra at the crown of the head.

There are many variations on these concepts in the Sanskrit source texts. In earlier texts there are various systems of chakras and [[Nadi (yoga)|nadis]], with varying connections between them. Various traditional sources list 5, 6, 7, 8 or even 12 chakras. Over time, one system of 6 or 7 chakras along the body's axis became the dominant model, adopted by most schools of [[yoga]]. This particular system may have originated in about the 11th century AD, and rapidly became widely popular.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, op. cit., p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The central role of the chakras in this model is the raising of [[Kundalini]], where it pierces the various centers, causing various levels of realisation and resulting in the obtention of various [[siddhis]] or occult powers, until reaching the crown of the head, resulting in union with the Divine. The methods on how to raise kundalini are generally secret, but a number of methods have been published, for example the Bihar school of yoga begin with a number of preparatory practices such as [[asanas]] and [[pranayama]] to purify the nadis, and then a number of practices and meditations specific to each chakra, and finally the raising of the kundalini through special [[kriyas]], which terminate in the vision of ones causal self&lt;ref name=twr&gt;[[Swami Satyananda Saraswati]], ''Kundalini Tantra''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vajrayana (Buddhist Tantra) ===
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}

The Tibetan theory of chakras plays an important role in all the Highest Yoga Tantras. They play a pivotal role in all Completion stage practices (as opposed to Generation stage practices), where an attempt is made to bring all the subtle winds of the body into the central channel, to realise the clear light of bliss and emptiness, and to attain the 'illusory body' of a divinity .&lt;ref name=twr&gt;[[Geshe Gelsang Kyatos]], ''Clear Light of Bliss''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tibetan system states that the central channel begins at the point of the third eye, curves up to the crown of the head, and then goes straight down the body to the tip of the sexual organ. The two side channels run parallel to, and without any space in between, the central channel, but they begin at the two nostrils: the lunar channel ends in the sexual organ, and the solar channel in the anus.
Along the central channel are positioned 10 chakras, of which usually four or five are expounded as being important. They are located in the following positions:
# Third eye between the eyebrows
# The wind wheel on the forehead
# The crown wheel on the top of the head
# The throat wheel
# The fire wheel between the throat and the heart
# The heart wheel
# The navel wheel
# The secret place, four fingers below the navel
# The jewel wheel on the sexual organ, near the end
# The tip of the sexual organ

The channels run parallel through them, but at the navel, heart, throat and crown the two side channels twist around the central channel. At the navel, throat and crown, there is a twofold knot caused by each side channel twisting once around the central channel. At the heart wheel there is a sixfold knot, where each side channel twists around three times. An important part of completion stage practice involves loosening and undoing these knots.

Within the chakras exist the 'subtle drops'. The white drop exists in the crown, the red drop exists in the navel, and at the heart exists the indestructible red and white drop, which leaves the body at the time of death. In addition, each chakra has a number of 'spokes' or 'petals', which branch off into thousands of subtle channels running to every part of the body, and each contains a Sanskrit syllable.

By visualising a specific chakra, the subtle winds (which follow the mind), enter the central channel. The chakra at which they enter is important in order to realise specific practices, for example, meditating on the syllable 'Ah' in the navel chakra is important for the practice of ''tummo'', or inner fire, the basis of the six yogas of Naropa. Meditating on the 'Hum' in the heart chakra is important for realising the Clear Light of bliss and emptiness. Meditating on the throat chakra is important for lucid dreaming and the practices of dream yoga. And meditating on the crown chakra is important for consciousness projection, either to another world, or into another body.

In general, the higher tantras, starting with the ''Guhyasamaja'' tantra, are very uniform in their descriptions of the chakras, channels and drops. The ''Kalachakra'' tantra has a slightly different system, which relates the chakras with astrology.

A result of energetic imbalance among the chakras is an almost continuous feeling of dissatisfaction. When the heart chakra is agitated, people lose touch with feelings and sensations, and that breeds the sense of dissatisfaction. That leads to looking outside for fulfillment.

When people live in their heads, feelings are secondary; they are interpretations of mental images that are fed back to the individual. When awareness is focused on memories of past experiences and mental verbalisations, the energy flow to the head chakra increases and the energy flow to the heart chakra lessens. Without nurturing feelings of the heart a subtle form of anxiety arises which results in the self reaching out for experience.

When the throat chakra settles and energy is distributed evenly between the head and the heart chakras, one is able to truly contact one's senses and touch real feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Tarthang Tulku.

=== Bön ===
Chakras, as [[prana|pranic]] centers of the body according to the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[Bön]]po tradition, influence the quality of experience, because movement of [[prana]] cannot be separated from experience. Each of the six major chakras are linked to experiential qualities of one of the [[six realms]] of existence.&lt;ref name=twr&gt;[[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche]], ''Healing with Form, Energy, and Light''. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion Publications, 2002. ISBN 1-55939-176-6, pp. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern teacher, [[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche]], uses a computer analogy: main chakras are like hard drives. Each hard drive has many files. One of the files is always open in each of the chakras, no matter how &quot;closed&quot; that particular chakra may be. What is displayed by the file shapes experience.

The [[tsa lung]] practices such as those embodied in [[Trul Khor]] lineages open channels so ''lung'' (''Lung'' is a Tibetan term [[cognate]] with [[prana]] or [[qi]]) may move without obstruction. [[Yoga]] opens chakras and evokes positive qualities associated with a particular chakra. In the hard drive analogy, the screen is cleared and a file is called up that contains positive, supportive qualities. A [[seed syllable]] ([[Sanskrit]] [[bija]]) is used both as a password that evokes the positive quality and the armour that sustains the quality.&lt;ref name=twr&gt;[[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche]], ''Healing with Form, Energy, and Light''. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion Publications, 2002. ISBN 1-55939-176-6, pp. 84-85&lt;/ref&gt;

Tantric practice is said to eventually transform all experience into bliss. The practice aims to liberate from negative conditioning and leads to control over perception and cognition.&lt;ref name=twr/&gt;

[[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche]] teaches a version of the [[Six Lokas]] [[sadhana]] which works with the chakra system.

=== Western derivative models and interpretations ===
[[Image:7-main-Chakras-illustrated-by-Gil-Dekel.jpg‎|thumb| |Recent Western traditions associate]]
[[Image:ChakraDiag.jpg|right]]

In Western culture, a concept similar to that of [[prana]] can be traced back as far as the 18th century's [[Franz Mesmer | Franz Anton Mesmer]], who used &quot;[[animal magnetism]]&quot; to cure disease.  However it was only in 1927 that the [[shakta]] theory of seven main chakras, that has become most popular in the West, was introduced, largely through the translation of two Indian texts: the ''Sat-Cakra-Nirupana'', and the ''Padaka-Pancaka'', by Sir [[John Woodroffe]], alias Arthur Avalon, in a book titled ''The Serpent Power''.&lt;ref&gt;Woodroffe, ''The Serpent Power'', Dover Publications, pp.317ff&lt;/ref&gt; This book is extremely detailed and complex, and later the ideas were developed into the predominant Western view of the chakras by [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]] in his book ''The Chakras''. Many of the views which directed Leadbeater's understanding of the chakras were influenced by previous theosophist authors, in particular [[Johann Georg Gichtel]], a disciple of [[Jakob Böhme]], and his book ''Theosophia Practica (1696)'', in which Gitchtel directly refers to inner ''force centers'', a concept reminiscent of the chakras.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]], [http://www.archeosofica.org/en/index.php/Theosophical-Excerpts/Gichtel-and-the-Theosophia-Practica.html Gichtel and Theosophia Practica], Chakra, Adyar, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the similarities between the Chinese and Indian philosophies, the notion of chakras was quickly blended into Chinese practices such as [[acupuncture ]]and belief in [[qi | ki]]. The convergence of these two distinct healing traditions and their common practitioners' own inventiveness have led to an ever-changing and expanding array of concepts in the western world. According to medical intuitive and author, [[Caroline Myss]], who described chakras in her work ''[[Anatomy of the Spirit]]'' (1996), &quot;Every thought and experience you've ever had in your life gets filtered through these chakra databases. Each event is recorded into your cells...&quot;, in effect your biography becomes your biology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myss.com/library/chakras/ Chakras] [[Caroline Myss]] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chakras are described{{By whom|date=March 2011}} as being aligned in an ascending column from the base of the [[spine (anatomy)|spine]] to the top of the head. [[New Age]] practices often associate each chakra  with a certain colour. In various traditions chakras are associated with multiple physiological functions, an aspect of [[consciousness]], a [[classical element]], and other distinguishing characteristics. They are visualized as lotuses/flowers with a different number of petals in every chakra.

The chakras are thought to vitalise the physical body and to be associated with interactions of a physical, emotional and mental nature. They are considered [[Wiktionary:locus|loci]] of life [[Energy (spirituality)|energy]] or [[prana]], also called [[shakti]], [[qi]] (Chinese; ''ki'' in Japanese), [[koach-ha-guf]]&lt;ref&gt;Helena Blavatsky (1892). Theosophical Glossary. Krotona.&lt;/ref&gt; (Hebrew), bios (Greek) &amp; [[aether (classical element)|aether]] (Greek, English), which is thought to flow among them along pathways called [[Nadi (yoga)|nadis]]. The function of the chakras is to spin and draw in this energy to keep the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical health of the body in balance. They are said by some to reflect how the unified consciousness of humanity (the immortal human being or the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]), is divided to manage different aspects of earthly life (body/instinct/vital energy/deeper emotions/communication/having an overview of life/contact to [[God]]). The chakras are placed at differing levels of spiritual subtlety, with [[Sahasrara]] at the top being concerned with pure consciousness, and [[Muladhara]] at the bottom being concerned with matter, which is seen simply as condensed, or gross consciousness.

[[Rudolf Steiner]] (one-time Theosophist, and the founder of [[Anthroposophy]]) says much about the chakras that is unusual, especially that the chakra system is dynamic and evolving and is very different for modern people than it was in ancient times, and will in turn be radically different in future times. In contrast to the traditional eastern teachings, Steiner describes a sequence of development from the top down rather than the bottom up. This is the so called 'Christos Path' which has not always been available to humanity. [This is also revealed by Swami Sivananda in his book on Japa Yoga, Himalaya Press 1978. In which the Swami states that a yogi that practices Japa with only the Om and is successful at Mahasamyama {oneness with the object...in this case a Word being meditated on} becomes a direct disciple of that, the OM, the most Holy of all words/syllables { the same as the word of creation as recognized by the Torah, although this is not professed or quite possibly not even recognized by those of secular authority in either Judaism or Christianity} thus the yogi achieving this feat needs no Guru or Sat-guru* to achieve any Spiritual goal {*Archetype / Ascended Master i.e. A Krishna, a Rama, a Jesus, a Nanak a Buddha..''et al.''} and Swami Sivananda mentions that this yogi has a path that is, in all recognizable ways and manners, reverse that of other Yogis or Spiritual aspirants and their paths and those include all Christian ascetics, in that this spiritual aspirant then works through the chakras, mastering them from the crown down.

Whereas every other well known path and all major religions{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} start by trying to master the chakras starting with the 'Svadhisthana Chakra' {Sex}, these Yogis aren't expected to renounce sex or certain foods, and by virtue of this they do not need to remove themselves from the world of temptations and become monks or recluses. They can stay in the world of men and live what appears to be a normal life that observes whatever local custom{s} there may be. Trevor Ravenscroft also mentions this spiritual goal and achievement in his book, &quot;The Cup Of Destiny&quot;, and says that these practices and achievements were known and the most highly regarded and desired by the Templar Knights of old.]

He also seems to ignore the [[Sahasrara|Thousand Petalled chakra]] at the crown of the head and instead cryptically mentions an eight-petalled chakra located between the [[Manipura|Ten Petalled]] and the [[Swadhisthana|Six Petalled]] ones. In his book ''How to Know Higher Worlds'' Steiner gives clear instructions on how to develop the chakras safely into maturity. These are more like life disciplines than exercises and can take considerable time. [[File:7 Chakras.JPG|thumb|7 Chakras]]

[[New Age]] writers, such as [[Anodea Judith]] in her book ''Wheels of Life'', have written about the chakras in great detail, including the reasons for their appearance and functions.

Another interpretation of the seven chakras is presented by writer and artist [[Zachary Selig]]. In the book ''Kundalini Awakening, a Gentle Guide to Chakra Activation and Spiritual Growth,'' he presents a unique codex titled &quot;Relaxatia&quot;, a solar [[Kundalini]] [[paradigm]] that is a codex of the human chakra system and the solar light spectrum, designed to activate Kundalini through his colour-coded chakra paintings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Selig, Zachary and Selby, Jon&quot;&gt;Selby, Jon and Selig, Zachary. (1992) Kundalini Awakening, a Gentle Guide to Chakra Activation and Spiritual Growth, New York: Random House, ISBN 978-0-553-35330-3 (0-553-35330-6)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some chakra system models describe one or more [[Transpersonal chakra]]s above the crown chakra, and an [[Earth star chakra]] below the feet. There are also held to be many minor chakras, for example between the major chakras. Chakras are also used in [[neurolinguistic programming]] to connect NLP [[logical level]]s with spiritual goals on the crown, intellectual on the forehead and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wel-systems.com/articles/new_paradigm.htm WEL-Systems: New Paradigm for NLP&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Endocrine system ====
The primary importance and level of existence of chakras is posited to be in the psyche. However, there are those who believe that chakras have a physical manifestation as well.&lt;ref&gt;Saraswati, MD (1953 - 2001). Kundalini Yoga. Tehri-Garhwal, India: Divine Life Society, foldout chart. ISBN 81-7052-052-5&lt;/ref&gt; The author Gary Osborn, for instance, has described the chakras as [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] counterparts to the [[endocrine system|endocrine glands]],&lt;ref&gt;The Shining Ones, Philip Gardiner and Gary Osborn, Watkins Publishing, 2006 edition, p44-45, ISBN 1-84293-150-4&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Anodea Judith]] noted a marked similarity between the positions of the two and the roles described for each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=5n4dkTw7e0QC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Endocrine+chakra&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=Endocrine%20chakra&amp;f=false Wheels of Life, Anodea Judith]&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Sturgess also links the lower six chakras to specific nerve plexuses along the spinal cord as well as glands.&lt;ref&gt;The Yoga Book, Stephen Sturgess, Element, 1997, p19-21, ISBN 1-85230-972-5&lt;/ref&gt; C.W. Leadbeater associated the Anja chakra with the [[pineal gland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BRbtL7_Q_i0C&amp;dq=cw+leadbeater+chakras&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=z5XkSsifFsay4QaC__j_AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=pineal&amp;f=false The Chakras, CW Leadbeater]&lt;/ref&gt; which is a part of the endocrine system.
Edgar Cayce said that the seven churches of the [[Book of Revelation]] are [[endocrine glands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edgarcayce.org/ps2/mysticism_interpretating_revelation.html Interpretating the Revelation, John Van Auken]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Spectrum of Light ====
A development in Western practices dating back to the 1940s is to associate each one of the seven chakras to a given colour and a corresponding crystal. For example, the chakra in the forehead is associated with the colour purple, so to cure a headache you would apply a purple stone to the forehead. This idea has proven highly popular and has been integrated by all but a few practitioners.

[[Patricia Mercier|Mercier]] introduces the relation of colour energy to the science of the [[light spectrum]];
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;As humans, we exist within the 49th Octave of Vibration of the electromagnetic light spectrum. Below this range are barely visible radiant heat, then invisible infrared, television and radiowaves, sound and brain waves; above it is barely visible ultraviolet, then the invisible frequencies of chemicals and perfumes, followed by x-rays, gamma rays, radium rays and unknown cosmic rays.&lt;ref&gt;The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 12. ISBN 978-1-84181-320-2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Understanding existence and physical form as an interpretation of light energy through the physical eyes will open up greater potential to explore the energetic boundaries of color, form and light that are perceived as immediate reality. Indian Yogic teachings assign to the seven major chakras specific qualities, such as color of influence (from the 7 rays of spectrum light), elements (such as earth, air, water &amp; ether), body sense (such as touch, taste, and smell), and relation to an endocrine gland.&lt;ref&gt;The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Description ==
{{Tantric chakras}}

Seven chakras in particular are described in the Shakta Tantra tradition that was brought over to the West. Below is a description of each of them, with Eastern and Western associations.

=== Sahasrara: The Crown Chakra ===
{| border=&quot;0&quot;
|width=170 valign=top|[[Image:Chakra07.gif|center]]
|valign=top|'''[[Sahasrara]]''', which means 1000 petalled lotus, is generally considered to be the chakra of pure consciousness, within which there is neither object nor subject. When the female kundalini [[Shakti]] energy rises to this point, it unites with the male [[Shiva]] energy, and a state of liberating [[samadhi]] is attained. Symbolized by a lotus with one thousand multi-coloured petals, it is located either at the crown of the head, or above the crown of the head. Sahasrara is represented by the colour white and it involves such issues as inner wisdom and the death of the body.
Its role may be envisioned somewhat similarly to that of the [[pituitary gland]], which secretes hormones to communicate to the rest of the endocrine system and also connects to the [[central nervous system]] via the [[hypothalamus]]. According to author Gary Osborn, the [[thalamus]] is thought to have a key role in the physical basis of [[consciousness]] and is the 'Bridal Chamber' mentioned in the Gnostic scriptures.  Sahasrara's inner aspect deals with the release of [[karma]], physical action with meditation, mental action with universal consciousness and unity, and emotional action with &quot;beingness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tibetan buddhism, the point at the crown of the head is represented by a white circle, with 32 downward pointing petals. It is of primary importance in the performance of [[phowa]], or consciousness projection after death, in order to obtain rebirth in a [[Pure Land]]. Within this chakra is contained the White drop, or Bodhicitta, which is the essence of masculine energy.

=== Ajna: The Brow Chakra ===
{| border=&quot;0&quot;
|width=170 valign=top|[[Image:Chakra06.gif|center]]
|valign=top|'''[[Ajna]]''' is symbolised by a lotus with two petals, and corresponds to the colors violet, indigo or deep blue. It is at this point that the 2 side nadis Ida and Pingala are said to terminate and merge with the central channel Sushumna, signifying the end of duality. The seed syllable for this chakra is the syllable OM, and the presiding deity is [[Ardhanarishvara]], who is a half male, half female Shiva/Shakti. The Shakti goddess of Ajna is called Hakini.
Ajna (along with [[Bindu]]), is known as the [[third eye]] chakra and is linked to the [[pineal gland]] which may inform a model of its envisioning. The pineal gland is a light sensitive gland that produces the hormone [[melatonin]] which regulates sleep and waking up.  Ajna's key issues involve balancing the higher &amp; lower selves and trusting inner guidance. Ajna's inner aspect relates to the access of intuition. Mentally, Ajna deals with visual consciousness. Emotionally, Ajna deals with clarity on an intuitive level.&lt;ref&gt;The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;
(Note: some opine that the pineal and pituitary glands should be exchanged in their relationship to the Crown and Brow chakras, based on the description in Arthur Avalon's book on [[kundalini]] called ''Serpent Power'' or empirical research.)

In Tibetan Buddhism, this point is actually the end of the central channel, since the central channel rises up from the sexual organ to the crown of the head, and then curves over the head and down to the third eye. While the central channel finishes here, the two side channels continue down to the 2 nostrils.

=== Vishuddha: The Throat Chakra ===
{| border=&quot;0&quot;
|width=170 valign=top|[[Image:Chakra05.gif|center]]
|valign=top|'''[[Vishuddha]] (also Vishuddhi)''' is depicted as a silver crescent within a white circle, with 16 light or pale blue, or turquoise petals. The seed mantra is Ham, and the residing deity is Panchavaktra shiva, with 5 heads and 4 arms, and the Shakti is Shakini.
Vishuddha may be understood as relating to communication and growth through expression. This chakra is paralleled to the [[thyroid]], a gland that is also in the throat and which produces [[thyroid hormone]], responsible for growth and maturation. Physically, Vishuddha governs communication, emotionally it governs independence, mentally it governs fluent thought, and spiritually, it governs a sense of security.&lt;ref&gt;The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;
In Tibetan buddhism, this chakra is red, with 16 upward pointing petals. It plays an important role in Dream Yoga, the art of [[lucid dreaming]].
|-
|}

=== Anahata: The Heart Chakra ===
{| border=&quot;0&quot;
|width=170 valign=top|[[Image:Chakra04.gif|center]]
|valign=top|'''[[Anahata]], or Anahata-puri, or padma-sundara''' is symbolised by a circular flower with twelve green petals. (See also [[bodhicitta|heartmind]]). Within it is a yantra of 2 intersecting triangles, forming a [[hexagram]], symbolising a union of the male and female. The seed mantra is Yam, the presiding deity is Ishana Rudra Shiva, and the Shakti is Kakini.

Anahata is related to the [[thymus]],located in the chest. The thymus is an element of the [[immune system]] as well as being part of the endocrine system. It is the site of maturation of the [[T cells]] responsible for fending off disease and may be adversely affected by [[stress (medicine)|stress]]. . Anahata is related to the colours green or pink. Key issues involving Anahata involve complex emotions, compassion, tenderness, unconditional love, equilibrium, rejection and well-being. Physically Anahata governs circulation, emotionally it governs unconditional love for the self and others, mentally it governs passion, and spiritually it governs devotion.&lt;ref&gt;The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tibetan buddhism, this centre is extremely important, as being the home of the indestructible red/white drop, which carries our consciousness to our next lives. It is described as being white, circular, with 8 downward pointing petals, and the seed syllable Hum inside. During mantra recitation in the lower tantras, a flame is imagined inside of the heart, from which the mantra rings out. Within the higher tantras, this chakra is very important for realising the Clear Light.

=== Manipura: The Solar Plexus Chakra ===
{| border=&quot;0&quot;
|width=170 valign=top|[[Image:Chakra03.gif|center]]
|valign=top|'''[[Manipura]] or manipuraka''' is symbolised by a downward pointing triangle with ten petals. The seed syllable is Ram, and the presiding deity is Braddha Rudra, with Lakini as the Shakti.

Manipura is related to the metabolic and digestive systems. Manipura is believed to correspond to [[Islets of Langerhans]],&lt;ref&gt;The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; which are groups of cells in the pancreas, as well as the outer [[adrenal glands]] and the adrenal cortex. These play a valuable role in [[digestion]], the conversion of food matter into energy for the body. The colour that corresponds to Manipura is yellow. Key issues governed by Manipura are issues of personal power, fear, anxiety, opinion-formation, introversion, and transition from simple or base emotions to complex. Physically, Manipura governs digestion, mentally it governs personal power, emotionally it governs expansiveness, and spiritually, all matters of growth.&lt;ref&gt;The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tibetan buddhism, this wheel is represented as a triangle with 64 upward pointing petals. It is the home of the Red drop, or red bodhicitta, which is the essence of feminine energy (as opposed to the Shakta system, where the kundalini energy resides in Muladhara). It contains the seed syllable short-Ah, which is of primary importance in the Tummo inner fire meditation, which is the system by which the energy of the red drop is raised to the white drop in the crown.

=== Swadhisthana: The Sacral Chakra ===
{| border=&quot;0&quot;
|width=170 valign=top|[[Image:Chakra02.gif|center]]
|valign=top|'''[[Swadhisthana]], Svadisthana or adhishthana  '''  is symbolized by a white lotus within which is a crescent moon, with six vermillion, or orange petals. The seed mantra is Vam, and the presiding deity is Bramha, with the Shakti being Rakini ( or Chakini ). The animal associated is the crocodile of [[Varuna]].
The Sacral Chakra is located in the [[sacrum]] (hence the name) and is considered to correspond to the testes or the ovaries that produce the various [[sex hormones]] involved in the [[reproductive cycle]]. Swadisthana is also considered to be related to, more generally, the genitourinary system and the adrenals. The key issues involving Swadisthana are relationships, violence, addictions, basic emotional needs, and pleasure. Physically, Swadisthana governs reproduction, mentally it governs creativity, emotionally it governs joy, and spiritually it governs enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tibetan buddhism, this is known as the Secret Place wheel. Below this point the Shakta tantra and Vajrayana systems diverge somewhat.
|-
|}

=== Muladhara: The Base Chakra ===
{| border=&quot;0&quot;
|width=170 valign=top|[[Image:Chakra01.gif|center]]
|valign=top|'''[[Muladhara]] or root chakra''' is represented as a yellow square, with 4 red petals. The seed syllable is Lam, the deity is [[Ganesh]], and the Shakti is Dakini. The associated animal is the elephant Ganesha. This chakra is where the 3 channels are merged, then separate and begin their upward movement. Inside of this chakra is wrapped up the goddess [[kundalini]] three times around a black lingam. It is the seat of the red bindu, the female drop (which in Tibetan vajrayana is located at the navel chakra).

Muladhara is related to instinct, security, survival and also to basic human potentiality. This center is located in the [[perineum]], which is the region between the genital and the anus. Although no endocrine organ is placed here, it is said to relate to the gonads and the adrenal medulla, responsible for the [[fight-or-flight response]] when survival is under threat. There is a muscle located in this region that controls ejaculation in the sexual act of the human male. A parallel is charted between the [[Spermatozoon|sperm cell]] and the [[ovum]] where the [[genetic code]] lies coiled and the [[kundalini]]. Muladhara is symbolized by a lotus with four petals and the colour red. Key issues involve sexuality, lust and obsession. Physically, Muladhara governs sexuality, mentally it governs stability, emotionally it governs sensuality, and spiritually it governs a sense of security.&lt;ref&gt;The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no chakra that exists in this position within Tibetan buddhism. Instead, below the secret place wheel, there are 2 other wheels, the jewel wheel, which is located in the middle of the sex organ, and the wheel located at the tip of the sex organ. These wheels are extremely important for the generation of great bliss, and are involved with tantric consort practices.

=== Minor chakras ===
In addition to the 7 major chakras, there are a number of other chakras which have importance within different systems. For example, Woodroffe describes 7 head chakras (including Ajna and Sahasrara) in his other Indian text sources. Lowest to highest they are: Talu/Talana/Lalana, Ajna, Manas, Soma, Brahmarandra, Sri (inside Sahasrara), Sahasrara. In addition, the chakra Hrit known as the wish-fulfilling tree is often included below the heart, which may be the same as a chakra known as Surya located at the solar plexus. Some models also have a series of 7 lower chakras below muladhara that go down the legs.

====Hrit chakra or Surya chakra====
This chakra is a minor chakra located just below the heart at the solar plexus, and is known as the wish-fulfilling tree. Here, the ability to determine your destiny becomes a reality. It is also known as the Surya chakra.&lt;ref&gt;R.Venugopalam. The Hidden Mysteries of Kundalini&lt;/ref&gt; It supports the actions of Manipura chakra by providing it with the element of heat, and is responsible for absorbing energy from the sun.

In Tibetan buddhism, a similar chakra called the Fire Wheel is included in the scheme, but this is located above the heart and below the throat.

====Lalana/Talumula====
A chakra known as Lalana is situated in one of two places, either in the roof of the mouth, between Visuddhi and Ajna, or on the forehead, above Ajna. The Lalana chakra on the roof of the mouth is related to Bindu and Vishuddhi. When the nectar amrit trickles down from Bindu, it is stored in lalana. This nectar can fall down to Manipura and be burned up, causing gradual degeneration, or through certain practices it can be passed to Visuddhi and purified, becoming a nectar of immortality.

====Manas====
A chakra known as Manas (mind) is located either between the navel and the heart, close to Surya, or is located above Ajna on the forehead. The version on the forehead has 6 petals, connected to the 5 sense objects plus the mind. In Tibetan buddhism, the chakra located on the forehead is called the Wind wheel, and has 6 spokes.

==== Bindu Visarga/Indu/Chandra====
Bindu visarga, is located either at the top back of the head, where some Brahmins leave a tuft of hair growing, or in the middle forehead. It is symbolised by a crescent moon. This chakra secretes an ambrosial fluid, amrit, and is the seat of the white bindu (compare with the white bodhicitta drop in the crown chakra in the Vajrayana system).

====Brahmarandra/Nirvana====
In some systems, Sahasrara is the chakra that is on the crown of the head. However, other systems, such as that expounded by [[Shri Aurobindo]], state that the real Sahasrara is located some way above the top of the head, and that the crown chakra is in fact Brahmarandra, a sort of secondary Sahasrara with 100 white petals.

====Shri/Guru====
This is a minor chakra located slightly above the top of the head. It is an upward facing 12 petalled lotus, and it is associated with the Guru, that higher force that guides us through our spiritual journey.

====Lower chakras====
There are said to be a series of seven chakras below muladhara going down the leg,&lt;ref&gt;Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami. Merging with Śiva: Hinduism's contemporary metaphysics, p.231&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding the base animal instincts, and to the Hindu underworld [[patala]]. They are called atala, vitala, sutala, talatala, rasatala, mahatala and patala.

=====Atala=====
This chakra is located in the hips, it governs fear and lust.

=====Vitala=====
Located in the thighs, it governs anger and resentment.

=====Sutala=====
Located in the knees, it governs jealousy.

=====Talatala=====
Translated as 'under the bottom level', it is located in the calves, and it is a state of prolonged confusion and instinctive wilfulness.

=====Rasatala=====
Located in the ankles, it is the centre of selfishness and pure animal nature.

=====Mahatala=====
Located in the feet, this is the dark realm 'without conscience', and inner blindness.

=====Patala=====
Located in the soles of the feet, this is the realm of malice, murder, torture and hatred, and in Hindu mythology it borders on the realm of [[Naraka]], or Hell.

==== Others ====
There are said to be 21 minor chakras which are reflected points of the major chakras.&lt;ref&gt;Acupressure and reflextherapy in the treatment of medical conditions, John R. Cross, Elsevier Health Sciences, 2001, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; These 21 are further grouped into 10 bilateral minor chakras that correspond to the foot, hand, knee, elbow, groin, clavicular, navel, shoulder and ear. The spleen may also be classified as a minor chakra by some authorities despite not having an associated coupled minor chakra.

==Comparisons with other Esoteric traditions==
A number of other mystical traditions talk about subtle energies that flow through the body, and identify specific parts of the body as being subtle centres. There are many similarities between systems, however, none of these traditions developed in isolation; the Indian mystical traditions had contact with the Chinese and Islamic mystical traditions, and they may have mutually influenced one another. Similarly, the Jewish and Islamic mystical traditions shared a great deal in common, especially during the Islamic occupation of Spain, and Jewish mysticism in particular had influence over Christian mysticism.

=== Qigong, the Dantian ===
[[Qigong]] also relies on a similar model of the human body as an [[Energy (spirituality)|energy]] system, except that it involves the circulation of [[qi]] (ki, chi) energy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lu K'uan Yü]],  ''Taoist Yoga - Alchemy and Immortality'', Rider and Company, London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mantak Chia|Mantak and Maneewan Chia]] ''Awaken Healing Light of the Tao'' (Healing Tao Books, 1993), ch.5&lt;/ref&gt; The Qi energy, equivalent to the Hindu Prana, flows through the energy channels called [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]], equivalent to the nadis, but 2 other energies are also important, Jing, the sexual energy, and Shen, or spirit energy.

In the principle circuit of qi, called the [[Microcosmic orbit]], energy rises up a main meridian along the spine, but also comes back down the front torso. Throughout its cycle it enters various [[dantian]]s (elixir fields) which act as furnaces, where the types of energy in the body (jing, qi and shen) are progressively refined.&lt;ref&gt;Yang Erzeng, Philip Clart. The Story of Han Xiangzi: the alchemical adventures of a Taoist immortal&lt;/ref&gt; These Dantians play a very similar role to that of chakras. The number of Dantians varies depending on the system; the navel dantian is the most well-known (it is called the Hara in Japan), but there is usually a Dantian located at the heart and between the eyebrows.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mantak Chia|Mantak and Maneewan Chia]] ''Awaken Healing Light of the Tao'' (Healing Tao Books, 1993), ch.13&lt;/ref&gt; The lower dantian at or below the navel transforms sexual essence, or jing, into qi energy. The middle dantian in the middle of the chest transforms qi energy into shen, or spirit, and the higher dantian at the level of the forehead (or at the top of the head), transforms Shen into wuji, infinite space of void.&lt;ref&gt;Andy James. The Spiritual Legacy of Shaolin Temple&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, the word qi is written ki, and is related to the practice of [[Reiki]], and plays an important role in Japanese martial arts such as Aikido.

===Sufism, the Lataif===
Many Sufi orders make use of [[lataif-e-sitta|Lata'if]], subtle centres in the body which are between 4 or 7 in number, and relate to ever more subtle levels of intimacy with Allah. But although some Lataif correspond in position to the chakras, there are also some big differences in position and meaning.

One six lata'if system positions the [[Nafs]], or lower self, below the navel, the [[Qalb]], or heart, in the left of the chest, the [[Ruh]], or spirit, to the right of the chest, the [[Sirr]], or secret, in the solar plexus, the [[Khafi]], or latent subtlety, in the position of the third eye, and the [[Akhfa]], or most arcane, at the top of the head. They are frequently associated with a colour, as well as a particular prophet.

Unlike the Indian and Chinese system, the emphasis is not upon these subtle centres performing a kind of inner alchemy upon the energies of the body, such as kundalini awakening, and they are not considered like organs for the subtle body; instead, they represent more abstract, philosophical concepts, representing ever greater degrees of closeness to Allah.

===Christianity, Hesychasm===
A completely separate contemplative movement within the Eastern Orthodox church is [[Hesychasm]], a form of Christian meditation. Comparisons have been made between the Hesychastic centres of prayer and the position of the chakras.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade. Yoga, Immortality and Freedom&lt;/ref&gt; Particular emphasis is placed upon the heart area. However, there is no talk about these centres as having any sort of metaphysical existence. Far more than in any of the cases discussed above, the centres are simply places to focus the concentration during prayer.

Other mystical traditions exist within Christianity. The Renaissance saw the birth of '[[Christian Kabbalah]]', which had its roots in Jewish kabbalah.

== Etymology ==
[[Narendra Nath Bhattacharyya|Bhattacharyya]]'s review of [[Tantra|Tantric]] history says that the word ''chakra'' is used to mean several different things in the Sanskrit sources:&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharyya, N. N., History of the Tantric Religion. Second Revised Edition. (Manohar: New Delhi, 1999) pp. 385-86. ISBN 81-7304-025-7&lt;/ref&gt;

# &quot;Circle,&quot; used in a variety of senses, symbolizing endless [[rotation]] of [[shakti]].
# A circle of people. In rituals there are different ''cakra-sādhanā'' in which adherents assemble and perform [[rite]]s. According to the ''[[Niruttaratantra]]'', chakras in the sense of assemblies are of 5 types.
# The term chakra also is used to denote [[yantra]]s or [[mysticism|mystic]] [[diagram]]s, variously known as ''{{IAST|trikoṇa-cakra}}'', ''{{IAST|aṣṭakoṇa-cakra}}'', etc.
# Different &quot;[[nerve plexus]] within the body.&quot;

In [[Buddhist]] literature the Sanskrit term ''cakra'' ([[Pali]] ''cakka'') is used in a different sense of &quot;circle,&quot; referring to a Buddhist conception of the four circles or states of [[existence]] in which gods or men may find themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, Franklin. ''Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Grammar and Dictionary''. Volume II. p. 221. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers: Delhi, 1953. Reprint edition, Delhi, 2004, ISBN 81-208-0999-8. E.g., {{IAST|catvāri devamanuṣyāṇāṃ cakrāṇi}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguist [[Jorma Koivulehto]] wrote (2001) of the annual Finnish ''[[Wiktionary:Kekri|Kekri]]'' celebration having loaned the word from early [[Indo-Aryan Languages|Indo-Aryan]].&lt;ref&gt;Koivulehto, Jorma 2001. The earliest contacts between [[Indo-European]] and [[Uralic]] speakers in the light of lexical loans. Pp. 235-263, no. 42 in: Carpelan et al. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indo-European]] cognates include [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kuklos'', [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''kaklas'', [[Tocharian B]] ''kokale'' and [[English language|English]] &quot;wheel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mallory, J.P. (1997). Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture. p 640 London: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers. ISBN 978-1-884964-98-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cognate]]s of &quot;chakra&quot; still exist in modern Asian languages as well. In [[Malay language|Malay]], &quot;cakera&quot; means &quot;disc,&quot; e.g. &quot;cakera padat&quot; = &quot;[[compact disc]].&quot;

'''Cloning''' in biology is the process of producing similar populations of genetically identical individuals that occurs in nature when organisms such as [[bacteria]], [[insect]]s or [[plant]]s reproduce [[Asexual Reproduction|asexually]]. Cloning in [[biotechnology]] refers to processes used to create copies of [[DNA]] fragments ([[molecular cloning]]), [[Cell (biology)|cells]] (cell cloning), or [[organisms]]. The term also refers to the production of multiple copies of a product such as [[digital media]] or [[software]].

The term ''clone'' is derived from ''κλῶνος'', the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for &quot;trunk, branch&quot;, referring to the process whereby a new plant can be created from a twig. In [[horticulture]], the spelling ''clon'' was used until the twentieth century; the final ''e'' came into use to indicate the vowel is a &quot;long o&quot; instead of a &quot;short o&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Molecular cloning==
{{Main|Molecular cloning}}
Molecular cloning refers to the process of making multiple molecules. Cloning is commonly used to amplify DNA fragments containing whole [[genes]], but it can also be used to amplify any DNA sequence such as [[Promoter (biology)|promoters]], non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from [[genetic fingerprinting]] to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in [[positional cloning]]. In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an [[origin of replication]], which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed and a variety of specialised [[cloning vector]]s (small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted) exist that allow [[protein expression]], tagging, single stranded [[RNA]] and DNA production and a host of other manipulations.

Cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves four steps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=iGenetics: A Molecular Approach |author= Peter J. Russel |year= 2005 |isbn=0-8053-4665-1 |location=San Francisco, California, United States of America |publisher=Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# fragmentation - breaking apart a strand of DNA
# [[DNA ligase|ligation]] - gluing together pieces of DNA in a desired sequence
# [[transfection]] - inserting the newly formed pieces of DNA into cells
# screening/selection - selecting out the cells that were successfully transfected with the new DNA
Although these steps are invariable among cloning procedures a number of alternative routes can be selected, these are summarized as a 'cloning strategy'.

Initially, the DNA of interest needs to be isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a [[vector (molecular biology)|vector]] (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using [[restriction enzyme]]s, and incubated with the fragment of interest under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called [[DNA ligase]]. Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, [[electroporation]], [[optical injection]] and [[biolistics]]. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, there is a need to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable [[antibiotic]] resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (??-factor complementation) on [[X-gal]] medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of [[PCR]], restriction fragment analysis and/or [[DNA sequencing]].

== Cellular cloning ==
=== Unicellular organisms ===
[[Image:CellColonyCloning.jpg|right|thumb|Cloning cell-line colonies using cloning rings]]
Cloning a cell means to derive a population of cells from a single cell. In the case of unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeast, this process is remarkably simple and essentially only requires the [[inoculation]] of the appropriate medium. However, in the case of cell cultures from multi-cellular organisms, cell cloning is an arduous task as these cells will not readily grow in standard media.

A useful tissue culture technique used to clone distinct lineages of cell lines involves the use of [[cloning ring]]s (cylinders).&lt;ref name=&quot;CloningRings&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFarland|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas McFarland|year=2000|title= Preparation of pure cell cultures by cloning|journal=Methods in Cell Science|volume=22|issue=1|pages=63–66|pmid=10650336|doi= 10.1023/A:1009838416621}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this technique, a single-cell suspension of cells that have been exposed to a [[mutagen|mutagenic agent]] or drug used to drive [[selection]] is plated at high dilution to create isolated colonies; each arising from a single and potentially clonal distinct cell. At an early growth stage when colonies consist of only a few of cells, sterile [[polystyrene]] rings (cloning rings), which have been dipped in grease are placed over an individual colony and a small amount of [[trypsin]] is added. Cloned cells are collected from inside the ring and transferred to a new vessel for further growth.

=== Cloning in stem cell research ===
{{Main|Somatic cell nuclear transfer}}
[[Somatic cell nuclear transfer]], known as SCNT, can also be used to create embryos for research or therapeutic purposes. The most likely purpose for this is to produce embryos for use in [[stem cell research]]. This process is also called &quot;research cloning&quot; or &quot;therapeutic cloning.&quot; The goal is not to create cloned human beings (called &quot;reproductive cloning&quot;), but rather to harvest stem cells that can be used to study human development and to potentially treat disease. While a clonal human blastocyst has been created, stem cell lines are yet to be isolated from a clonal source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/blog/2008/01/california_biot.html|title=California biotech says it cloned a human embryo, but no stem cells produced|first=Gideon|last=Gil|publisher=Boston Globe|date=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organism cloning ==
{{See|Asexual reproduction}}
'''Organism cloning''' (also called reproductive cloning) refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place. Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants (see [[vegetative reproduction]]) and some insects. Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows. There is a lot of ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used. However, cloning, or asexual propagation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/plantanswers/misc/asexualpropagation.html |title=Asexual Propagation |publisher=Aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been common practice in the horticultural world for hundreds of years.

=== Horticultural ===
The term ''clone'' is used in horticulture to refer to descendants of a single plant which were produced by [[vegetative reproduction]] or [[apomixis]]. Many horticultural plant [[cultivar]]s are clones, having been derived from a single individual, multiplied by some process other than sexual reproduction. As an example, some European cultivars of [[grape]]s represent clones that have been propagated for over two millennia. Other examples are [[potato]] and [[banana]] and grapes. [[Grafting]] can be regarded as cloning, since all the shoots and branches coming from the graft are genetically a clone of a single individual, but this particular kind of cloning has not come under [[ethics|ethical]] scrutiny and is generally treated as an entirely different kind of operation.

Many [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, [[vine]]s, [[fern]]s and other [[perennials|herbaceous perennial]]s form [[clonal colony|clonal colonies]]. Parts of a large clonal colony often become detached from the parent, termed [[Fragmentation (cell biology)|fragmentation]], to form separate individuals. Some plants also form [[seed]]s is asexually, termed apomixis, e.g. [[dandelion]].

=== Parthenogenesis ===
Clonal derivation exists in nature in some animal species and is referred to as [[parthenogenesis]] (reproduction of an organism by itself without a mate). This is an asexual form of reproduction that is only found in females of some insects, crustaceans and [[Whiptail lizard|lizards]]. The growth and development occurs without fertilization by a male. In plants, parthenogenesis means the development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell, and is a component process of apomixis. In species that use the XY sex-determination system, the offspring will always be female. An example is the &quot;Little [[Fire ant|Fire Ant]]&quot; (''[[Wasmannia auropunctata]]''), which is native to [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] but has spread throughout many tropical environments.

=== Artificial cloning of organisms ===
Artificial cloning of organisms may also be called ''reproductive cloning''.

==== Methods ====
Reproductive cloning generally uses &quot;[[somatic cell nuclear transfer]]&quot; (SCNT) to create animals that are genetically identical. This process entails the transfer of a nucleus from a donor adult cell (somatic cell) to an egg that has no nucleus. If the egg begins to divide normally it is transferred into the uterus of the surrogate mother. Such clones are not strictly identical since the somatic cells may contain mutations in their nuclear DNA. Additionally, the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] in the [[cytoplasm]] also contains DNA and during SCNT this DNA is wholly from the donor egg, thus the [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] genome is not the same as that of the nucleus donor cell from which it was produced. This may have important implications for cross-species nuclear transfer in which nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities may lead to death.

Artificial ''embryo splitting'' or ''embryo twinning'' may also be used as a method of cloning, where an [[embryo]] is split in the maturation before [[embryo transfer]]. It is optimally performed at the 6- to 8-cell stage, where it can be used as an expansion of [[IVF]] to increase the number of available embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Illmensee K, Levanduski M, Vidali A, Husami N, Goudas VT |title=Human embryo twinning with applications in reproductive medicine |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 93|issue= 2|pages= 423–7|year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19217091 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.12.098 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If both embryos are successful, it gives rise to [[Monozygotic twins|monozygotic (identical) twins]].

==== Dolly the Sheep ====
{{Main|Dolly the Sheep}}
[[Image:Dolly clone.svg|thumb|250px|]][[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly]], a [[Finn-Dorset]] [[domestic sheep|ewe]], was the first mammal to have been successfully cloned from an adult cell. She was cloned at the [[Roslin Institute]] in [[Scotland]] and lived there from her birth in 1996 until her death in 2003 when she was six. Her [[Taxidermy|stuffed remains]] were placed at Edinburgh's [[Royal Museum]], part of the [[National Museums of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;TV documentary Visions Of The Future part 2 shows this process, explores the social implicatins of cloning and contains footage of monoculture in livestock&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolly was publicly significant because the effort showed that the genetic material from a specific adult cell, programmed to express only a distinct subset of its genes, can be reprogrammed to grow an entirely new organism. Before this demonstration, it had been shown by John Gurdon that nuclei from differentiated cells could give rise to an entire organism after transplantation into an enucleated egg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez |title=PubMed home |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=2010-07-06 |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this concept was not yet demonstrated in a mamallian system.

Cloning Dolly the sheep had a low success rate per fertilized egg; she was born after 237 eggs were used to create 29 embryos, which only produced three lambs at birth, only one of which lived. Seventy calves have been created and one third of them died young; [[Prometea]] took 277 attempts. Notably, although the first clones were frogs, no adult cloned frog has yet been produced from a somatic adult nucleus donor cell.

There were early claims that [[Dolly the Sheep]] had pathologies resembling accelerated aging. Scientists speculated that Dolly's death in 2003 was related to the shortening of [[telomere]]s, DNA-protein complexes that protect the end of linear [[chromosome]]s. However, other researchers, including [[Ian Wilmut]] who led the team that successfully cloned Dolly, argue that Dolly's early death due to respiratory infection was unrelated to deficiencies with the cloning process.

==== Water buffalo ====
On September 15, 2007, the [[Philippines]] announced its [[New product development|development]] of [[Southeast Asia]]’s first [[cloned]] [[water buffalo]]. The [[Philippine]] Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCARRD), under the Department of Science and Technology in [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] approved this [[project]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/sept/16/yehey/metro/20070916met1.html Manila Times, RP to produce Southeast Asia’s first cloned buffalo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Species cloned ====
{{See|List of animals that have been cloned}}
The modern cloning techniques involving [[nuclear transfer]] have been successfully performed on several species. Landmark experiments{{Clarify|date=August 2008}}&lt;!-- what makes these landmarks? Replace POV word with verifiable or attributable statements --&gt; in chronological order:
* [[Tadpole]]: (1952) Many scientists questioned whether cloning had actually occurred and unpublished experiments by other labs were not able to reproduce the reported results.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}
* [[Carp]]: (1963) In [[China]], [[embryologist]] [[Tong Dizhou]] produced the world's first cloned fish by inserting the DNA from a cell of a male carp into an egg from a female carp.

==== Human cloning ====
{{Main|Human cloning}}
Human cloning is the creation of a [[genetics|genetically]] identical copy of an existing or previously existing [[human]]. The term is generally used to refer to ''artificial'' human cloning; human clones in the form of [[identical twin]]s are commonplace, with their cloning occurring during the natural process of reproduction. There are two commonly discussed types of human cloning: therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning. Therapeutic cloning involves cloning adult cells for use in medicine and is an active area of research. Reproductive cloning would involve making cloned humans. A third type of cloning called replacement cloning is a theoretical possibility, and would be a combination of therapeutic and reproductive cloning. Replacement cloning would entail the replacement of an extensively damaged, failed, or failing body through cloning followed by whole or partial [[brain transplant]].

The various forms of human cloning are controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pence|first=Gregory E.|authorlink=Gregory E. Pence|title=Who’s Afraid of Human Cloning?|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=1998|id=paperback ISBN 0-8476-8782-1 and hardcover ISBN 0-8476-8781-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been numerous demands for all progress in the human cloning field to be halted. Most scientific, governmental and religious organizations oppose reproductive cloning. The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) and other scientific organizations have made public statements suggesting that human reproductive cloning be banned until safety issues are resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aaas.org/spp/sfrl/docs/cloningstatement.shtml| title = AAAS Statement on Human Cloning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serious [[bioethics|ethical concerns]] have been raised by the future possibility of harvesting organs from clones.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Some people have considered the idea of growing organs separately from a human organism - in doing this, a new organ supply could be established without the moral implications of harvesting them from humans. Research is also being done on the idea of growing organs that are biologically acceptable to the human body inside of other organisms, such as pigs or cows, then transplanting them to humans, a form of [[xenotransplantation]].

The first [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] human clone was created in November 1998, by Advanced Cell Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/371378.stm | work=BBC News | title=Details of hybrid clone revealed | date=June 18, 1999 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created from a man's leg cell, and a cow's egg whose DNA was removed. It was destroyed after 12 days. Since a normal embryo implants at 14 days, Dr [[Robert Lanza]], ACT's director of tissue engineering, told the Daily Mail newspaper that the embryo could not be seen as a person before 14 days. While making an embryo, which may have resulted in a complete human had it been allowed to come to term, according to ACT: &quot;[ACT's] aim was 'therapeutic cloning' not 'reproductive cloning'&quot;&lt;!-- therapeutic vs. reproductive needs some work on their definitions in the article above.  This is obvious legal doublespeak on the company's part, to cover their ass.--&gt;

On January, 2008, Wood and Andrew French, Stemagen's chief scientific officer in [[California]], announced that they successfully created the first 5 mature human embryos using [[DNA]] from adult skin cells, aiming to provide a source of viable embryonic [[stem cells]]. Dr. [[Samuel H. Wood|Samuel Wood]] and a colleague donated skin cells, and DNA from those cells was transferred to human eggs. It is not clear if the embryos produced would have been capable of further development, but Dr. Wood stated that if that were possible, using the technology for reproductive cloning would be both unethical and illegal. The 5 cloned embryos, created in Stemagen Corporation lab, in [[La Jolla]], were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/17/AR2008011700324.html?hpid=topnews Mature Human Embryos Created From Adult Skin Cells] Washingtonpost.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ethical issues of cloning ====
{{Main|Ethics of cloning}}
Because of recent technological advancements, the cloning of animals (and potentially humans) has been an issue. The Catholic Church and many religious organizations oppose all forms of cloning,{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} on the grounds that life begins at conception. Judaism does not equate life with conception and,{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} though some question the wisdom of cloning, [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbis generally find no firm reason in [[halakhah|Jewish law and ethics]] to object to cloning.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} From the standpoint of classical [[liberalism]], concerns also exist regarding the protection of the identity of the individual and the right to protect one's genetic identity.

[[Gregory Stock]] is a scientist and outspoken critic against restrictions on cloning research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socgen.ucla.edu/pmts/latcom1221.htm New Page 0&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Bioethicist [[Gregory Pence]] also attacks the idea of criminalizing attempts to clone humans.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The social implications of an artificial human production scheme were famously explored in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s novel ''[[Brave New World]].'' &lt;!-- the movie &quot;the island&quot; is far from a notable philosophical treatment of human cloning. though entertaining, its treatment of this subject was profoundly absurd. Readers are suggested to refer Aldous Huxley's final work &quot;The Island&quot; instead. --&gt;

On December 28, 2006, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved the consumption of meat and other products from cloned animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16372490 |title=FDA says cloned animals are OK to eat - Health - More health news - msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2006-12-28 |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloned-animal products were said to be virtually indistinguishable from the non-cloned animals. Furthermore, companies would not be required to provide [[Food labeling regulations|labels]] informing the consumer that the meat comes from a cloned animal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoniac.com/health-fitness/meat-of-cloned-food-is-safe-to-eat-fda-says.html Meat of Cloned Food is Safe to Eat, FDA Says]&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have raised objections to the FDA's approval of cloned-animal products for human consumption, arguing that the FDA's research was inadequate, inappropriately limited, and of questionable scientific validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsus.org/farm/resources/research/practices/genetic_engineering_and_cloning_farm_animals.html |title=An HSUS Report: Welfare Issues with Genetic Engineering and Cloning of Farm Animals &amp;#124; The Humane Society of the United States |publisher=Hsus.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/pubs/FINAL_FORMATTEDprime%20time.pdf |title=Not ready for prime time |author= |date=21 march 2007 |work= |publisher=[[Center for Food Safety]] |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consumersunion.org/pdf/FDA_clone_comments.pdf |title=Comments of Consumers Union to US Food and Drug Administration on Docket No. 2003N-0573, Draft Animal Cloning Risk Assessment|author=Michael Hansen, Ph.D. |date=27 April 2007 |work= |publisher=Consumersunion.org |accessdate=26 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several consumer-advocate groups are working to encourage a tracking program that would allow consumers to become more aware of cloned-animal products within their food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://secure3.convio.net/cfs/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&amp;page=UserAction&amp;id=302 |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Convio.net |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Mendelson, legal director of the [[Center for Food Safety]], said that cloned food still should be labeled since safety and ethical issues about it remain questionable.

Carol Tucker Foreman, director of [[food policy]] at the [[Consumer Federation of America]], stated that FDA does not consider the fact that the results of some studies revealed that cloned animals have increased rates of mortality and deformity at birth.

==== Cloning extinct and endangered species ====
Cloning, or more precisely, the reconstruction of functional DNA from [[extinct]] species has, for decades, been a dream of some scientists. The possible implications of this [[Biological issues in Jurassic Park|were dramatized]] in the best-selling novel by [[Michael Crichton]] and high budget Hollywood thriller ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''. In real life, one of the most anticipated targets for cloning was once the [[Woolly Mammoth]], but attempts to extract DNA from frozen mammoths have been unsuccessful, though a joint Russo-Japanese team is currently working toward this goal. And in January 2011, it was reported by Yomiuri Shimbun that a team of scientists headed by Akira Iritani of Kyoto University had built upon research by Dr. Wakayama, saying that they will extract DNA from a mammoth carcass that had been preserved in a Russian laboratory and insert it into the egg cells of an African elephant in hopes of producing a mammoth embryo. The researchers said they hoped to produce a baby mammoth within six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3075381.stm|title=Scientists 'to clone mammoth'|publisher=BBC News|date=2003-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a cow named Bessie gave birth to a cloned Asian [[gaur]], an endangered species, but the calf died after two days. In 2003, a [[banteng]] was successfully cloned, followed by three African wildcats from a thawed frozen embryo. These successes provided hope that similar techniques (using surrogate mothers of another species) might be used to clone extinct species. Anticipating this possibility, tissue samples from the last ''bucardo'' ([[Pyrenean Ibex]]) were frozen in [[liquid nitrogen]] immediately after it died in 2000. Researchers are also considering cloning endangered species such as the giant panda, ocelot, and cheetah. The &quot;[[Frozen zoo|Frozen Zoo]]&quot; at the [[San Diego Zoo]] now stores frozen tissue from the world's rarest and most endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20001008/aponline171938_000.htm|title=Scientists Close on Extinct Cloning|author=Heidi B. Perlman|agency=Associated Press|date=2000-10-08 | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pence2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Cloning After Dolly: Who's Still Afraid?|first=Gregory E.|last=Pence|authorlink=Gregory E. Pence|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2005|isbn=0-7425-3408-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, geneticists at the [[Australian Museum]] announced that they had replicated DNA of the [[Thylacine]] (Tasmanian Tiger), extinct about 65 years previous, using [[polymerase chain reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/auspac/05/28/aust.thylacines/|title=Cloning to revive extinct species|first=Grant|last=Holloway|publisher=CNN.com|date=2002-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on February 15, 2005 the museum announced that it was stopping the project after tests showed the specimens' DNA had been too badly degraded by the ([[ethanol]]) preservative. On 15 May 2005 it was announced that the Thylacine project would be revived, with new participation from researchers in [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

In January 2009, for the first time, an extinct animal, the Pyrenean ibex mentioned above was cloned, at the [[Centre of Food Technology and Research of Aragon]], using the preserved [[DNA]] of the skin samples from 2001 and domestic goat egg-cells. (The ibex died shortly after birth due to physical defects in its lungs.) &lt;ref name=&quot;The Telegraph&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title =Extinct ibex is resurrected by cloning | url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/4409958/Extinct-ibex-is-resurrected-by-cloning.html | accessdate = 2009-02-01 |work = The Telegraph | location=London | first1=Richard | last1=Gray | first2=Roger | last2=Dobson | date=31 January 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the continuing obstacles in the attempt to clone extinct species is the need for nearly perfect DNA. Cloning from a single specimen could not create a viable breeding population in sexually reproducing animals. Furthermore, even if males and females were to be cloned, the question would remain open whether they would be viable at all in the absence of parents that could teach or show them their natural behavior.

Cloning endangered species is a highly ideological issue. Many [[conservation biology|conservation biologists]] and [[environmentalist]]s vehemently oppose cloning endangered species—mainly because they think it may deter donations to help preserve natural habitat and wild animal populations. The &quot;[[rule-of-thumb]]&quot; in animal conservation is that, if it is still feasible to conserve habitat and viable wild populations, breeding in captivity should not be undertaken in isolation.

In a 2006 review, [[David Ehrenfeld]] concluded that cloning in animal conservation is an experimental technology that, at its state in 2006, could not be expected to work except by pure chance and utterly failed a [[cost-benefit analysis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehrenfeld&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehrenfeld|first=David|authorlink=David Ehrenfeld|year=2006|title=Transgenics and Vertebrate Cloning as Tools for Species Conservation|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=20|issue=3|pages=723–732|pmid=16909565|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00399.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he said, it is likely to siphon funds from established and working projects and does not address any of the issues underlying animal extinction (such as [[habitat destruction]], [[hunting]] or other [[overexploitation]], and an impoverished gene pool). While cloning technologies are well-established and used on a regular basis in plant conservation, care must be taken to ensure genetic diversity. He concluded:
{{quote|Vertebrate cloning poses little risk to the environment, but it can consume scarce conservation resources, and its chances of success in preserving species seem poor. To date, the conservation benefits of transgenics and vertebrate cloning remain entirely theoretical, but many of the risks are known and documented. Conservation biologists should devote their research and energies to the established methods of conservation, none of which require transgenics or vertebrate cloning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehrenfeld&quot;/&gt;}}

==In science fiction==
Cloning has been used in countless science fiction works throughout the years.  Human cloning is usually the most popular kind that is used in these particular works, mainly due to fact that it brings up controversial questions of identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csustan.edu/honors/documents/journals/thresholds/Delacruz.pdf Yvonne A. De La Cruz ''Science Fiction Storytelling and Identity:  Seeing the Human Through Android Eyes'']&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in C.J. Cherryh’s novel [[Cyteen]], and in Aldous Huxley’s novel [[Brave New World]], human cloning is a major plot device that not only drives the story along but also makes the reader think critically about what identity means.

Cellulose is the structural component of the primary [[cell wall]] of [[green plants]], many forms of [[algae]] and the [[oomycetes]]. Some species of [[bacteria]] secrete it to form [[biofilm]]s.
Cellulose is the most common organic compound on Earth. About 33% of all plant matter is cellulose (the cellulose content of [[cotton]] is 90% and that of [[wood]] is 40–50%).&lt;ref&gt;Cellulose. (2008). In ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Retrieved January 11, 2008, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipst.gatech.edu/faculty_new/faculty_bios/ragauskas/technical_reviews/Chemical%20Overview%20of%20Wood.pdf Chemical Composition of Wood]&lt;/ref&gt;

For industrial use, cellulose is mainly obtained from [[wood pulp]] and [[cotton]]. It is mainly used to produce [[paperboard]] and [[paper]]; to a smaller extent it is converted into a wide variety of derivative products such as [[cellophane]] and [[rayon]]. Converting cellulose from [[energy crop]]s into [[biofuel]]s such as [[cellulosic ethanol]] is under investigation as an alternative fuel source.

Some animals, particularly [[ruminant]]s and [[termite]]s, can [[digestion|digest]] cellulose with the help of [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] micro-organisms that live in their guts. Humans can digest cellulose to some extent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slavin|first1=JL|last2=Brauer|first2=PM|last3=Marlett|first3=JA|title=Neutral detergent fiber, hemicellulose and cellulose digestibility in human subjects.|journal=The Journal of nutrition|volume=111|issue=2|pages=287–97|year=1981|pmid=6257867}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01089198|last1=Joshi|first1=S|last2=Agte|first2=V|title=Digestibility of dietary fiber components in vegetarian men.|journal=Plant foods for human nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands)|volume=48|issue=1|pages=39–44|year=1995|pmid=8719737}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it is often referred to as '[[dietary fiber]]' or 'roughage' (e.g. outer shell of [[maize]]) and acts as a [[hydrophilic]] bulking agent for [[feces]].

==History==
Cellulose was discovered in 1838 by the French chemist [[Anselme Payen]], who isolated it from plant matter and determined its chemical formula.&lt;ref name=Crawford /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Payen (1838) &quot;Mémoire sur la composition du tissu propre des plantes et du ligneux&quot; (Memoir on the compositon of the tissue of plants and of woody [material]), ''Comptes rendus'', vol. 7, pages 1052-1056.  Payen added appendices to this paper on December 24, 1838 (see: ''Comptes rendus'', vol. 8, page 169 (1839)) and on February 4, 1839 (see:  ''Comptes rendus'', vol. 9, page 149 (1839)).  A committee of the French Academy of Sciences reviewed Payen's findings in :  Jean-Baptiste Dumas (1839) &quot;Rapport sur un mémoire de M. Payen, relatif à la composition de la matière ligneuse&quot; (Report on a memoir of Mr. Payen, regarding the composition of woody matter), ''Comptes rendus'', vol. 8, pages 51-53.  In this report, the word &quot;cellulose&quot; is coined and author points out the similarity between the empirical formula of cellulose and that of &quot;dextrine&quot; (starch).  The above articles are reprinted in:   Brongniart and Guillemin, eds., ''Annales des sciences naturelles''... , 2nd series, vol. 11 (Paris, France:  Crochard et Cie., 1839), [http://books.google.com/books?id=VDRsFWwgUo4C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 21-31].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot;&gt;{{cite book

[[Hermann Staudinger]] determined the polymer structure of cellulose in 1920. The compound was first chemically synthesized (without the use of any biologically derived [[enzyme]]s) in 1992, by Kobayashi and Shoda.&lt;ref name=Klemm&gt;{{Cite journal

Cellulose is the major constituent of [[paper]], [[paperboard]], and [[card stock]] and of [[textile]]s made from [[cotton]], [[linen]], and other [[plant fiber]]s.

Cellulose can be converted into [[cellophane]], a thin transparent film, and into [[rayon]], an important fiber that has been used for textiles since the beginning of the 20th century. Both cellophane and rayon are known as &quot;regenerated cellulose fibers&quot;; they are identical to cellulose in chemical structure and are usually made from [[dissolving pulp]] via [[viscose]]. A more recent and environmentally friendly method to produce rayon is the [[Lyocell]] process. 
Cellulose is the raw material in the manufacture of [[nitrocellulose]] (cellulose nitrate) which was historically used in [[smokeless powder|smokeless gunpowder]] and as the base material for [[celluloid]] used for photographic and movie films until the mid 1930s.

Cellulose is used to make water-soluble [[adhesives]] and [[binder (material)|binders]] such as [[methyl cellulose]] and [[carboxymethyl cellulose]] which are used in [[wallpaper paste]]. [[Microcrystalline cellulose]] ([[E number|E460i]]) and powdered cellulose (E460ii) are used as inactive [[Excipient#Fillers_and_diluents|fillers]] in tablets&lt;ref&gt;

and as thickeners and stabilizers in processed foods. Cellulose powder is for example used in [[Kraft Foods|Kraft's]] [[Parmigiano-Reggiano|Parmesan cheese]] to prevent caking inside the tube.

Cellulose is used in the laboratory as the stationary phase for [[Chromatography|thin layer chromatography]]. Cellulose fibers are also used in liquid [[filtration]], sometimes in combination with [[diatomaceous earth]] or other filtration media, to create a filter bed of inert material.
Cellulose is further used to make [[hydrophilic]] and highly absorbent sponges.

[[Cellulose insulation]] made from recycled paper is becoming popular as an environmentally preferable material for [[building insulation]]. It can be treated with [[boric acid]] as a [[fire retardant]].

===Cellulose source and energy crops===
{{Main|Energy crop}}
The major [[combustion|combustible]] component of non-food [[energy crop]]s is cellulose, with [[lignin]] second. Non-food energy crops are more efficient than edible energy crops (which have a large [[starch]] component), but still compete with food crops for agricultural land and water resources.&lt;ref&gt;Holt-Gimenez, Eric 2007. Biofuels: Myths of the Agrofuels Transition. ''Backgrounder.'' Institute for Food and Development Policy, Oakland, CA. 13:2&lt;/ref&gt; Typical non-food energy crops include [[hemp|industrial hemp]], [[switchgrass]], ''[[Miscanthus]]'', ''Salix'' ([[willow]]), and ''Populus'' ([[poplar]]) species.

Some bacteria can convert cellulose into [[ethanol]] which can then be used as a fuel; see [[cellulosic ethanol]].

==Structure and properties==
Cellulose has no taste, is odourless, is [[hydrophilic]] with the [[contact angle]] of 20–30,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vacuum deposition onto webs, films, and foils, Volume 0, Issue 8155|editor=Charles A. Bishop|year=2007|isbn=0815515359|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vP9E3z7o6iIC&amp;pg=PA165|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; is insoluble in [[water]] and most organic [[solvent]]s, is [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] and is [[biodegradation|biodegradable]]. It can be broken down chemically into its glucose units by treating it with concentrated acids at high temperature.

Cellulose is derived from &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose units, which [[condensation reaction|condense]] through β(1→4)-[[glycosidic bond]]s. This linkage motif contrasts with that for α(1→4)-glycosidic bonds present in [[starch]], [[glycogen]], and other carbohydrates. Cellulose is a straight chain polymer: unlike starch, no coiling or branching occurs, and the molecule adopts an extended and rather stiff rod-like conformation, aided by the equatorial conformation of the glucose residues. The multiple [[hydroxyl|hydroxyl groups]] on the glucose from one chain form [[hydrogen bond]]s with oxygen molecules on the same or on a neighbor chain, holding the chains firmly together side-by-side and forming ''microfibrils'' with high [[tensile strength]]. This strength is important in cell walls, where the microfibrils are meshed into a carbohydrate ''matrix'', conferring rigidity to plant cells.[[File:cellulose spacefilling model.jpg|thumb|260px|a triple strand of cellulose, showing the hydrogen bonds (cyan lines) between glucose strands]]

Compared to starch, cellulose is also much more [[crystallinity|crystalline]]. Whereas starch undergoes a crystalline to [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] transition when heated beyond 60-70 °C in water (as in cooking), cellulose requires a temperature of 320 °C and pressure of 25 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]] to become amorphous in water.&lt;ref name=Deguchi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deguchi|first1=Shigeru|last2=Tsujii|first2=Kaoru|last3=Horikoshi|first3=Koki|title=Cooking cellulose in hot and compressed water|journal=Chemical Communications|pages=3293|year=2006|doi=10.1039/b605812d|issue=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several different crystalline structures of cellulose are known, corresponding to the location of hydrogen bonds between and within strands. Natural cellulose is cellulose I, with structures I&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;. Cellulose produced by bacteria and algae is enriched in I&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; while cellulose of higher plants consists mainly of I&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;. Cellulose in regenerated cellulose fibers is cellulose II. The conversion of cellulose I to cellulose II is irreversible, suggesting that cellulose I is [[metastable]] and cellulose II is stable. With various chemical treatments it is possible to produce the structures cellulose III and cellulose IV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cermav.cnrs.fr/glyco3d/lessons/cellulose/index.html Structure and morphology of cellulose] by Serge Pérez and William Mackie, CERMAV-[[CNRS]], 2001. Chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many properties of cellulose depend on its chain length or [[degree of polymerization]], the number of glucose units that make up one polymer molecule. Cellulose from wood pulp has typical chain lengths between 300 and 1700 units; cotton and other plant fibers as well as bacterial celluloses have chain lengths ranging from 800 to 10,000 units.&lt;ref name=Klemm/&gt; Molecules with very small chain length resulting from the breakdown of cellulose are known as [[cellodextrin]]s; in contrast to long-chain cellulose, cellodextrins are typically soluble in water and organic solvents.

Plant-derived cellulose is usually found in a mixture with [[hemicellulose]], [[lignin]], [[pectin]] and other substances, while [[microbial cellulose]] is quite pure, has a much higher water content, and consists of long chains.

Cellulose is soluble in [[cupriethylenediamine]] (CED), [[cadmiumethylenediamine]] (Cadoxen), [[N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide|''N''-methylmorpholine ''N''-oxide]] and [[lithium chloride]] / [[dimethylformamide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Stenius |first1= Per |title= Forest Products Chemistry |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 3 |year= 2000 |publisher= Fapet OY |location= Finland |isbn= 952-5216-03-9 |page= 35 |chapter= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is used in the production of regenerated celluloses (as [[viscose]] and [[cellophane]]) from [[dissolving pulp]].

==Assaying a Cellulose-containing Material==
Given a cellulose-containing material, the carbohydrate portion that does not dissolve in a 17.5% solution of [[sodium hydroxide]] at 20 °C is ''α cellulose'', which is true cellulose. Acidification of the extract precipitates ''β cellulose''. The portion that dissolves in base but does not precipitate with acid is ''γ cellulose''.

Cellulose can be [[assay]]ed using a method described by Updegraff in 1969, where the fiber is dissolved in [[acetic acid|acetic]] and [[nitric acid]] to remove lignin, hemicellulose, and xylosans. The resulting cellulose is allowed to react with [[anthrone]] in [[sulfuric acid]]. The resulting coloured compound is assayed [[spectrophotometry|spectrophotometrically]] at a wavelength of approximately 635 [[1 E-9 m|nm]].

In addition, cellulose is represented by the difference between acid detergent fiber (ADF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL).

==Biosynthesis==
[[File:Plant cell wall diagram.svg|thumb|250px|right|Location and arrangement of cellulose microfibrils in the plant [[cell wall]].]]
In [[vascular plant]]s cellulose is synthesized at the [[plasma membrane]] by rosette terminal complexes (RTCs). The RTCs are [[oligomer|hexameric]] protein structures, approximately 25 [[nanometre|nm]] in diameter, that contain the cellulose [[synthase]] enzymes that synthesise the individual cellulose chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3871010|last1=Kimura|first1=S|last2=Laosinchai|first2=W|last3=Itoh|first3=T|last4=Cui|first4=X|last5=Linder|first5=CR|last6=Brown Jr|first6=RM|title=Immunogold labeling of rosette terminal cellulose-synthesizing complexes in the vascular plant vigna angularis|journal=The Plant cell|volume=11|issue=11|pages=2075–86|year=1999|pmid=10559435|pmc=144118|jstor=3871010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each RTC floats in the cell's plasma membrane and &quot;spins&quot; a microfibril into the [[cell wall]].

RTCs contain at least three different cellulose synthases, encoded by ''CesA'' genes, in an unknown [[stoichiometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=N. G.|title=Interactions among three distinct CesA proteins essential for cellulose synthesis|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=100|pages=1450|year=2003|doi=10.1073/pnas.0337628100|issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Separate sets of ''CesA'' genes are involved in primary and secondary cell wall biosynthesis.

Cellulose synthesis requires chain initiation and elongation, and the two processes are separate.
''CesA'' [[glucosyltransferase]] initiates cellulose polymerization using a [[steroid]] primer, [[beta-sitosterol|sitosterol]]-beta-[[glucoside]], and UDP-glucose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peng|first1=L|last2=Kawagoe|first2=Y|last3=Hogan|first3=P|last4=Delmer|first4=D|title=Sitosterol-beta-glucoside as primer for cellulose synthesis in plants|journal=Science|volume=295|issue=5552|pages=147–50|year=2002|pmid=11778054|doi=10.1126/science.1064281}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cellulose synthase (UDP-forming)|Cellulose synthase]] utilizes [[Uridine diphosphate|UDP]]-D-glucose precursors to elongate the growing cellulose chain. A [[cellulase]] may function to cleave the primer from the mature chain.

==Breakdown (cellulolysis)==
Cellulolysis is the process of breaking down cellulose into smaller polysaccharides called [[cellodextrin]]s or completely into glucose units; this is a [[hydrolysis]] reaction. Because cellulose molecules bind strongly to each other, cellulolysis is relatively difficult compared to the breakdown of other polysaccharides.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Barkalow, Roy L. Whistler, &quot;Cellulose&quot;, in AccessScience, McGraw-Hill, {{doi|10.1036/1097-8542.118200}}. Retrieved 11 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Processes do exist however for the breakdown of cellulose such as the Lyocell process &lt;ref&gt;H.Lyocell, &quot;Cellulose&quot; Issue 41, pp 419&lt;/ref&gt; which uses a combination of heated water and [[acetone]] to break down the cellulose strands.

Most mammals have only very limited ability to digest dietary fibres such as cellulose. Some [[ruminant]]s like cows and sheep contain certain [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] bacteria (like ''[[Cellulomonas]]'') in the flora of the rumen, and these bacteria produce [[enzyme]]s called [[cellulase]]s that help the microorganism to break down cellulose; the breakdown products are then used by the bacteria for proliferation. The bacterial mass is later digested by the ruminant in its digestive system (stomach and small intestine). Similarly, lower [[termite]]s contain in their [[hindgut]]s certain [[flagellate]] [[protozoa]] which produce such enzymes; higher termites contain bacteria for the job. Some termites may also produce cellulase of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hidden cellulases in termites: revision of an old hypothesis|journal=Biology Letters|volume=3|pages=336–339|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0073|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/3/336.long|date=22 June 2007|author8=Tokuda, Gaku and Hirofumi Watanabe|issue=3|pmid=17374589|last1=Tokuda|first1=G|last2=Watanabe|first2=H|pmc=2464699|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fungus|Fungi]], which in nature are responsible for recycling of nutrients, are also able to break down cellulose.

The enzymes utilized to [[wikt:cleave|cleave]] the [[glycosidic linkage]] in cellulose are [[glycoside hydrolase]]s including endo-acting [[cellulase]]s and exo-acting [[glucosidase]]s. Such enzymes are usually secreted as part of multienzyme complexes that may include [[dockerin]]s and cellulose binding modules.&lt;ref name=Bras&gt;{{Cite journal

==Hemicellulose==
{{Main|Hemicellulose}}
[[Hemicellulose]] is a [[polysaccharide]] related to cellulose that comprises ca. 20% of the biomass of most plants. In contrast to cellulose, hemicellulose is derived from several sugars in addition to [[glucose]], especially [[xylose]] but also including [[mannose]], [[galactose]], [[rhamnose]], and [[arabinose]]. Hemicellulose consists of shorter chains - around 200 sugar units. Furthermore, hemicellulose is branched, whereas cellulose is unbranched.

==Derivatives==
The [[hydroxyl]] groups (-OH) of cellulose can be partially or fully reacted with various [[reagent]]s to afford derivatives with useful properties like mainly cellulose [[ester]]s and cellulose [[ether]]s (-OR). In principle, though not always in current industrial practice, cellulosic polymers are renewable resources.

Ester derivatives include:

The cellulose acetate and cellulose triacetate are film- and fiber-forming materials that find a variety of uses. The nitrocellulose was initially used as an explosive and was an early film forming material. With [[camphor]], nitrocellulose gives [[celluloid]].

ISBN 1-85109-523-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=IjaRKo2XUsEC&amp;dq=the+trials+of+the+world's+oldest+colony '''Puerto Rico:The Trials of the Oldest Colony in the World.'''] By Jose Trias Monge. Yale University Press. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[politics]] and [[history]], a '''colony''' is a [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] under the immediate political control of a [[Sovereign state|state]]. For [[colonies in antiquity]], [[city-state]]s would often found their own colonies. Some colonies were historically countries, while others were territories without definite statehood from their inception. The  [[metropolis|metropolitan]] state is the state that owns the colony. In [[Ancient Greece]], the city that founded a colony was called the metropolis.  Mother country is a reference to the metropolitan state from the point of view of citizens who live in its colony. There is a [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]].

A colony is mostly ruled by another state or can be run independently. Unlike a [[puppet state]] or [[satellite state]], a colony has no independent international representation, and its top-level administration is under direct control of the metropolitan state.

The term &quot;informal colony&quot; is used by some historians to describe a country which is under the ''de facto'' control of another state, although this description is often contentious.

==Definitions==

The word Colony comes from the Latin word colōnia. This in turn derives from the word [[Colonus (person)|colōnus]], which means colonist but also implies a farmer. [[Cologne]] is an example of a settlement preserving this etymology. Other, less obvious settlements that began as Roman [[colonia]] include cities from [[Belgrade]] to [[York]]. A telltale sign of a settlement once being a Roman Colony is a city centre with a grid pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James S. Jeffers|title=The Greco-Roman world of the New Testament era: exploring the background of early Christianity|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YGmKaXiUDiYC|year=1999|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=9780830815890|pages=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=YGmKaXiUDiYC&amp;pg=PA52 52–53]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology is taken from architectural analogy, where a column pillar is beneath the (often stylized) head [[Capital (architecture)|capital]], which is also a biological analog of the body as subservient beneath the controlling head (with 'capital' coming from the Latin ''caput'', meaning 'head'). So colonies are not independently self-controlled, but rather are controlled from a separate entity that serves the capital function.

Roman colonies first appeared when the Romans conquered neighbouring [[Ancient peoples of Italy|italic peoples]]. These were small farming settlements that appeared when the Romans had subdued an enemy in war. A colony could take many forms, as a trade outpost or a military base in enemy territory, but its original definition as a settlement created by people migrating from a home territory became the modern definition.

==Colonies in ancient civilizations (examples)==
''See [[Colonies in antiquity]].''

* [[Alexandria]] formed as a Greek colony
* [[Carthage]] was a [[Phoenicia]]n colony
* [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] was a colony of the Greeks of [[Santorini|Thera]]
* [[Durrës]] formed as a Greek colony
* [[Marseille]] formed as a Greek colony
* [[Cologne]] formed as a Roman colony, and its modern name refers to the Latin term &quot;Colonia&quot;.

==Modern colonies (examples, organized alphabetically)==
* '''[[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]]''': a colony of Portugal across several centuries.
* '''[[History of Australia|Australia]]''': In 1770 some of the eastern coastline of Australia is claimed as British territory by the British explorer, Lieutenant [[James Cook]]. The [[First Fleet]] was sent to Australia to start a [[penal colony]] in 1788. Eventually, Australia became a [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901.
* '''[[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]]''': a colony of Portugal across several centuries.
* '''[[Hong Kong]]''' was a British colony from 1841 to 1997, and '''[[Macau]]''' was a Portuguese colony from 1557 to 1999. Both are now [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions]] of the People's Republic of China.
* Parts of '''[[India]]''' were under the direct control of the government of the [[United Kingdom]] between 1858 and 1947. ''See also [[Crown colony]].'' Some other parts belonged to [[Portuguese India]] 
* '''[[Indonesia]]''' was a Dutch colony for 350 years, from 1600 to 1945/49, occupied by Japan from 1942 to 1945.
* '''[[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]''': a colony of Portugal across several centuries.
* '''The [[Philippines]]''', previously a colony of Spain from 1521{{#tag:Ref|[[Ferdinand Magellan]] claimed the Philippine Islands for Spain in 1521, but it can be argued that Spain's legitimate sovereignty over the islands commenced following a popular referendum in 1599.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Damaso De Lario|author2=Dámaso de Lario Ramírez|title=Re-shaping the world: Philip II of Spain and his time|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8r8eIuAJpTAC|year=2008|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=9789715505567|chapter=Philip II and the &quot;Philippine Referndum&quot; of 1599|chapter-url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8r8eIuAJpTAC&amp;pg=PA93}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} to 1898, was a colony of the United States from 1898 to 1946. During [[World War II]] between 1942 and 1945, it was occupied by the Japanese forces.
* '''[[Portuguese Guinea]]''': a colony of Portugal across several centuries.
* '''[[Taiwan]]''' was originally inhabited by [[indigenous peoples]] closely related linguistically, culturally and genetically to the [[Filipino people|Filipino]] people and more distantly to the [[Polynesians]]. In the 13th century, people from [[Song Dynasty]] had been migrating to Taiwan - however, the migration was small due to the island's harsh terrain and hostile local tribes. From 1895 to 1945, Taiwan was a colony of Japan. For a brief period prior to that, Taiwan was a province of the [[Qing Dynasty]], and previously part of the [[Fujian Province]] for two centuries from the 1680s. Before Chinese Republicans settled on Taiwan, [[Mao Zedong]] encouraged the Taiwanese to seek independence in order to undermine the power of the government of [[Republic of China]] led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. In the 17th century, Taiwan was a Dutch colony for 37 years before the Southern [[Ming Dynasty]] assumed authority of rule by defeating the Dutch. Since 1945 Taiwan has been governed by the Republic of China, first from the mainland, and then after the communist revolution on mainland China, as a government-in-exile.
* The '''[[United States of America]]''', originally thirteen distinct English (or British, if founded after the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union of 1707]]) [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]] in [[British America]]. The [[Colony of Virginia]], later to become the [[US state]]s of [[Virginia]], [[Kentucky]] and [[West Virginia]], was the first of the thirteen colonies and was under English and then British rule from 1607 until 1783, at least nominally.

==Current colonies (examples)==
Today, the colonizing European and North American powers hold few colonies in the traditional sense of the term, with the exceptions listed below.  However, the [[Channel Islands]] are not UK colonies but a remnant of the [[Duchy of Normandy]].
Some of the former colonies have been integrated as [[dependent area]]s or have closer integration with the country.

Of Africa:
* '''[[Rio de Oro/Western Sahara/Madeira]]''' is considered the last colony in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3208012.stm

Of Chile:
* '''[[Easter Island]]''' is a special territory incorporated to [[Chile]]. Today, natives have full rights as Chilean citizens.

Of France:
* The '''[[French Overseas Departments]]''' are called integral regions and are considered by some to be modern-day colonies of France.
** [[French Guiana]]
** [[Guadeloupe]]
** [[Martinique]]
** [[Réunion]]
** [[Mayotte]]

Of the United Kingdom:  
* The '''[[British Overseas Territories]]''' - such as the [[British Virgin Islands]] and [[Falkland Islands]] - are former [[Crown Colonies]]. Many of the larger, populated territories, have their own political systems but are still under the sovereignty of the United Kingdom and are managed by Governors.

Of the United States:
* Similar to Puerto Rico, '''[[American Samoa]]''', '''[[Guam]]''', the '''[[Northern Mariana Islands]]''' and the '''[[US Virgin Islands]]''' are considered by some to have a colonial relationship with the United States because their citizens are subject to the laws of the [[United States Congress]] passed without their consent. These territories, along with Puerto Rico, are known as [[unincorporated territory|unincorporated]] territories.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[cryptozoology]], [[ufology]], and [[nature photography|outdoor photography]], '''rods''' (sometimes known as &quot;'''skyfish'''&quot; or &quot;'''solar entities'''&quot;) are elongated [[artifact (error)|artifacts]] produced by cameras that inadvertently capture several of a flying insect's wingbeats.&lt;ref name=&quot;skepdic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/rods.html|title=A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions|last=Carroll|first=Robert Todd|date=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Videos of rod-shaped objects moving quickly through the air were claimed by some to be alien life forms or small [[UFOs]], but subsequent experiments showed that these rods appear in film because of an optical illusion/collusion (especially in interlaced video recording).&lt;ref name = &quot;CCTV&quot;/&gt;
    
==Optical analysis==
[[Image:Moths attracted by floodlight.jpg|thumb|200px|Long exposure photograph of moths showing exaggerated rod effect]] 
Various paranormal interpretations appeared in the popular culture, and one of the more outspoken proponents of rods as alien life forms is Jose Escamilla, who claims to have been the first to film them on March 19, 1994 at [[Roswell, New Mexico]], while attempting to film a [[UFO]]. Since then, Escamilla has made additional videos and embarked on lecture tours to promote his claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/et_youve_got_mail/|title=ET, You’ve Got Mail |last=Sheaffer|first= Robert |date=March / April 2000|work=Skeptical Inquirer|publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, investigators have shown that rods are mere [[Optical illusion|tricks of light]] which result from how images (primarily video images) of flying insects are recorded and played back. In particular, the fast passage before the camera of an insect flapping its wings has been shown to produce rodlike effects, due to [[motion blur]], if the camera is shooting with relatively long exposure times. &lt;ref name=&quot;Adams&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1831/whats-up-with-rods-the-mysterious-insects-that-can-be-seen-only-on-video|title=What's up with &quot;rods,&quot; the mysterious insects that can be seen only on video? |last=Adams|first=Cecil|date=September 18, 2000 |work=The Straight Dope|accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 8/9, 2005, [[China Central Television]] (CCTV) aired a two-part documentary about flying rods in China.  It reported the events from May to June of the same year at Tonghua Zhenguo Pharmaceutical Company in [[Tonghua|Tonghua City]], Jilin Province, which debunked the flying rods.&lt;ref name = &quot;CCTV&quot;&gt;[http://tech.sina.com.cn/d/2006-01-23/2211827624.shtml 中国UFO悬案调查：飞棍出没的世界(下)] [http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;langpair=zh-CN|en&amp;u=http://tech.sina.com.cn/d/2006-01-23/2211827624.shtml SINA Technology News, &quot;China's outstanding UFO Investigation: fly rod Haunted World (Part Two)&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Surveillance cameras in the facility's compound captured video footage of flying rods identical to those shown in Jose Escamilla's video. Getting no satisfactory answer to the phenomenon, curious scientists at the facility decided that they would try to solve the mystery by attempting to catch these airborne creatures. Huge nets were set up and the same surveillance cameras then captured images of rods flying into the trap. When the nets were inspected, the &quot;rods&quot; were no more than regular moths and other ordinary flying insects. Subsequent investigations proved that the appearance of flying rods on video was an optical illusion created by the slower recording speed of the camera.

For the purpose of [[wind engineering|wind]] or [[earthquake engineering]], columns may be designed to resist lateral forces. Other [[compression member]]s are often termed &quot;columns&quot; because of the similar stress conditions. Columns are frequently used to support [[Beam (structure)|beam]]s or [[arch]]es on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest. In architecture, &quot;column&quot; refers to such a structural element that also has certain proportional and decorative features. A column might also be a decorative element not needed for structural purposes; many columns are &quot;engaged with&quot;, that is to say form part of a wall. 

==History==
[[File:Columns of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece.jpeg|thumb|left|Columns found at the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo in Delphi]]]]
All significant [[Iron Age]] civilizations of the [[Near East]] and [[Mediterranean]] made some use of columns.  In [[Ancient Egyptian architecture]] as early as 2600 BC the architect [[Imhotep]] made use of stone columns whose surface was carved to reflect the organic form of bundled reeds; in later Egyptian architecture faceted cylinders were also common. 

Some of the most elaborate columns in the ancient world were those of [[the Persians]], especially the massive stone columns erected in [[Persepolis]]. They included double-bull structures in their [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]]. [[Apadana|The Hall of Hundred Columns]] at Persepolis, measuring 70&amp;nbsp;× 70 metres, was built by the [[Achaemenid]] king [[Darius the Great of Persia|Darius I]] (524–486 BC). Many of the ancient Persian columns are standing, some being more than 30 metres tall.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The Egyptians, Persians and other civilizations mostly used columns for the practical purpose of holding up the roof inside a building, preferring outside walls to be decorated with [[relief]]s or painting, but the Ancient Greeks, followed by the Romans, loved to use them on the outside as well, and the extensive use of columns on the interior and exterior of buildings is one of the most characteristic features of classical architecture, in buildings like the [[Parthenon]].  The Greeks developed the [[#Classical orders|classical orders]] of architecture, which are most easily distinguished by the form of the column and its various elements.  Their [[Doric order|Doric]], Ionic, and Corinthian orders were expanded by the Romans to include the Tuscan and Composite orders (see below).  

Columns, or at least large structural exterior ones, became much less significant in the architecture of the [[Middle Ages]], and the classical forms were abandoned in both [[Byzantine architecture]] and the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture]] or Europe in favour of more flexible forms, with capitals often using various types of foliage decoration, and in the West scenes with figures carved in [[relief]]. [[Renaissance architecture]] was keen to revive the classical vocabulary and styles, and the informed use and variation of the classical orders remained fundamental to the training of architects throughout [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], [[Rococo]] and [[Neo-classical architecture]]. 

==Structure==
[[File:Carpark Cinema Undercroft Albany II.jpg|thumb|right|Modern column grid in a car park]]
Early columns were constructed of stone, some out of a single piece of stone.  Single-piece columns are among the heaviest stones used in architecture.  Other stone columns are created out of multiple sections of stone, mortared or dry-fit together.  In many classical sites, sectioned columns were carved with a centre hole or depression so that they could be pegged together, using stone or metal pins.  The design of most classical columns incorporates [[entasis]] (the inclusion of a slight outward curve in the sides) plus a reduction in diameter along the height of the column, so that the top is as little as 83% of the bottom diameter.  This reduction mimics the parallax effects which the eye expects to see, and tends to make columns look taller and straighter than they are while entasis adds to that effect.

Modern columns are constructed out of steel, poured or precast concrete, or brick. They may then be clad in an architectural covering (or veneer), or left bare. In modern terms, the impost (or pier) is the topmost member of a column. The bottom-most part of the arch, called the springing, rests on the impost.

===Equilibrium, instability, and loads===
{{Main|Buckling#Buckling in columns}}
[[File:Columns in the inner court of the Bel Temple Palmyra Syria.JPG|thumb|left|These are composed of stacked segments and finished in the [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] style ([[Temple of Bel]], Syria)]]

{{Mechanical_failure_modes}}

As the axial load on a perfectly straight slender column with elastic material properties is increased in magnitude, this ideal column passes through three states: stable equilibrium, neutral equilibrium, and instability. The straight column under load is in stable equilibrium if a lateral force, applied between the two ends of the column, produces a small lateral deflection which disappears and the column returns to its straight form when the lateral force is removed. If the column load is gradually increased, a condition is reached in which the straight form of equilibrium becomes so-called neutral equilibrium, and a small lateral force will produce a deflection that does not disappear and the column remains in this slightly bent form when the lateral force is removed. The load at which neutral equilibrium of a column is reached is called the critical or [[buckling]] load. The state of instability is reached when a slight increase of the column load causes uncontrollably growing lateral deflections leading to complete collapse.

For an axially loaded straight column with any end support conditions, the equation of static equilibrium, in the form of a differential equation, can be solved for the deflected shape and critical load of the column. With hinged, fixed or free end support conditions the deflected shape in neutral equilibrium of an initially straight column with uniform cross section throughout its length always follows a partial or composite sinusoidal curve shape, and the critical load is given by

&lt;math&gt;f_{cr}\equiv\frac{\pi^2\textit{E}I_{min}}{{L}^2}\qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' =  [[elastic modulus]] of the material, ''I&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;'' =  the minimal moment of inertia of the cross section, and ''L'' = actual length of the column between its two end supports. A variant of (1) is given by

&lt;math&gt;f_{cr}\equiv\frac{\pi^{2}E_T}{(\frac{KL}{r})^{2}}\qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:ColumnEffectiveLength.png|thumb|right|360px|Table showing values of K for structural columns of various end conditions (adapted from Manual of Steel Construction, 8th&amp;nbsp;edition, American Institute of Steel Construction, Table C1.8.1)]]

where ''r'' = [[radius]] of gyration of [column]cross-section which is equal to the square root of (I/A), ''K'' =  ratio of the longest half [[sine]] wave to the actual column length, and ''KL'' =  effective length (length of an equivalent hinged-hinged column). From Equation&amp;nbsp;(2) it can be noted that the buckling strength of a column is inversely proportional to the square of its length.

When the critical stress, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;cr&lt;/sub&gt; (''F''&lt;sub&gt;cr&lt;/sub&gt; =''P''&lt;sub&gt;cr&lt;/sub&gt;/''A'', where ''A''&amp;nbsp;= cross-sectional area of the column), is greater than the proportional limit of the material, the column is experiencing inelastic buckling. Since at this stress the slope of the material's stress-strain curve, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; (called the [[tangent]] modulus),  is smaller than that below the proportional limit, the critical load at inelastic buckling is reduced. More complex formulas and procedures apply for such cases, but in its simplest form the critical buckling load formula is given as Equation&amp;nbsp;(3),

&lt;math&gt;f_{cr}\equiv{F_y}-\frac{F^{2}_{y}}{4\pi^{2}E}\left(\frac{KL}{r^2}\right)\qquad (3)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; =  tangent modulus at the stress ''F''&lt;sub&gt;cr&lt;/sub&gt;

A column with a cross section that lacks symmetry may suffer torsional buckling (sudden twisting) before, or in combination with, lateral buckling. The presence of the twisting deformations renders both theoretical analyses and practical designs rather complex.

Eccentricity of the load, or imperfections such as initial crookedness, decreases column strength. If the axial load on the column is not concentric, that is, its line of action is not precisely coincident with the centroidal axis of the column, the column is characterized as eccentrically loaded. The eccentricity of the load, or an initial curvature, subjects the column to immediate bending. The increased stresses due to the combined axial-plus-flexural stresses result in a reduced load-carrying ability.

Column elements are considered to be massive if minimal side dimension is equal or more than 400&amp;nbsp;mm. Massive columns have ability to increase concrete strength during long time period (even during exploitation period). Taking into account possible loads onto structure increase in future (and even threat of progressive failure - terroristic attacks, explosions etc.) - massive columns have advantage comparing with not ones. A little economy today has no sense as usual for future. Moreover relatively small sections are not technological for reinforced structures during their production. Balance between economy, mass of structures and so called &quot;sustainable&quot; construction is necessary.

===Extensions===
When a column is too long to be built or transported in one piece, it has to be extended or spliced at the construction site. A reinforced concrete column is extended by having the steel reinforcing bars protrude a few inches or feet above the top of the concrete, then placing the next level of reinforcing bars to overlap, and pouring the concrete of the next level. A steel column is extended by welding or bolting splice plates on the flanges and webs or walls of the columns to provide a few inches or feet of load transfer from the upper to the lower column section. A timber column is usually extended by the use of a steel tube or wrapped-around sheet-metal plate bolted onto the two connecting timber sections.

===Foundations===
A column that carries the load down to a foundation must have means to transfer the load without overstressing the foundation material. Reinforced concrete and masonry columns are generally built directly on top of concrete foundations. A steel column, when seated on a concrete foundation, must have a base plate to spread the load over a larger area and thereby reduce the bearing pressure. The base plate is a thick rectangular steel plate usually welded to the bottom end of the column.

==Classical orders==
{{main|Classical order}}
[[File:San prospero colonne reggio emilia.jpg|thumb|right|Church of [[San Prospero]], [[Reggio Emilia]], [[Italy]]]]
The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] author [[Vitruvius]], relying on the writings (now lost) of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] authors, tells us that the ancient [[Hellenic civilization|Greeks]] believed that their Doric order developed from techniques for building in wood in which the earlier smoothed tree trunk was replaced by a stone cylinder.

===Doric order===
{{main|Doric order}}

The [[Doric order]] is the oldest and simplest of the classical orders. It is composed of a vertical [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] that is wider at the bottom.  It generally has neither a base nor a detailed [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]. It is instead often topped with an inverted [[frustum]] of a shallow cone or a cylindrical band of carvings.  It is often referred to as the masculine order because it is represented in the bottom level of the [[Colosseum]] and the [[Parthenon]], and was therefore considered to be able to hold more weight. The height-to-thickness ratio is about 8:1. The shaft of a Doric Column is always [[Fluting (architecture)|fluted]].

The Greek Doric, developed in the western Dorian region of Greece, is the heaviest and most massive of the orders. It rises from the [[stylobate]] without any base; it is from four to six times as tall as its diameter; it has twenty broad flutes; the capital consists simply of a banded necking swelling out into a smooth echinus, which carries a flat square abacus; the Doric entablature is also the heaviest, being about one-fourth the height column. The Greek Doric order was not used after c. 100 B.C. until its “rediscovery” in the mid-eighteenth century.

===Tuscan order===
{{main|Tuscan order}}

The [[Tuscan order]], also known as Roman Doric, is also a simple design, the base and capital both being series of cylindrical disks of alternating diameter. The shaft is almost never fluted. The proportions vary, but are generally similar to Doric columns. Height to width ratio is about 7:1.

===Ionic order===
{{main|Ionic order}}

The [[Ionic order|Ionic]] column is considerably more complex than the Doric or Tuscan.  It usually has a base and the shaft is often fluted (it has grooves carved up its length). On the top is a capital in the characteristic shape of a [[scroll (parchment)|scroll]], called a [[volute]], or scroll, at the four corners. The height-to-thickness ratio is around 9:1. Due to the more refined proportions and scroll capitals, the Ionic column is sometimes associated with academic buildings. Ionic style columns were used on the second level of the Colosseum.
[[File:Colonne-p1040009.jpg|thumb|Ionic [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]]]

===Corinthian order===
{{main|Corinthian order}}

The [[Corinthian order]] is named for the Greek [[city-state]] of [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], to which it was connected in the period.  However, according to the architectural historian Vitruvius, the column was created by the sculptor [[Callimachus (sculptor)|Callimachus]], probably an [[Athens|Athenian]], who drew [[Acanthus (genus)|acanthus]] leaves growing around a votive basket. In fact, the oldest known Corinthian capital was found in Bassae, dated at 427 BC. It is sometimes called the feminine order because it is on the top level of the Colosseum and holding up the least weight, and also has the slenderest ratio of thickness to height. Height to width ratio is about 10:1.

===Composite order===
The [[Composite order]] draws its name from the capital being a composite of the Ionic and Corinthian capitals. The acanthus of the Corinthian column already has a scroll-like element, so the distinction is sometimes subtle. Generally the Composite is similar to the Corinthian in proportion and employment, often in the upper tiers of colonnades. Height to width ratio is about 11:1 or 12:1.

==Solomonic==
[[Image:StPetersSalomonicColumnsCrop.jpg|thumb|240px|Two of Constantine's [[Solomonic column]]s in their present day location on a pier in [[St Peter's, Rome]]. Part of [[St. Peter's baldachin|Bernini's Baldachin]], inspired by the original columns, is in the foreground.]]

A [[Solomonic column]], sometimes called &quot;[[barley sugar]]&quot;,  begins on a base and ends in a capital, which may be of any order, but the shaft twists in a tight spiral, producing a dramatic, serpentine effect of movement.  Solomonic columns were developed in the ancient world, but remained rare there. A famous marble set, probably 2nd century, was brought to [[St Peter's, Rome]] by [[Constantine I]], and placed round the saint's shrine, and was thus familiar throughout the Middle Ages, by which time they were thought to have been removed from the [[Temple of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Ward-Perkins, &quot;The shrine of St. Peter's and its twelve spiral columns&quot; ''Journal of Roman Studies'' '''42''' (1952) p 21ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  The style was used in bronze by [[Bernini]] for his spectacular [[St. Peter's baldachin]], actually a [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]] (which displaced Constantine's columns), and thereafter became very popular with [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] church architects, above all in [[Latin America]], where they were very often used, especially on a small scale, as they are easy to produce in wood by [[Woodturning|turning on a lathe]] (hence also the style's popularity for [[Spindle (furniture)|spindles]] on furniture and stairs).

'''''Carmilla''''' is a [[Gothic novel]]la by [[Sheridan Le Fanu|Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu]]. First published in 1872, it tells the story of a young woman's susceptibility to the attentions of a female [[vampire]] named Carmilla. ''Carmilla'' predates [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' by 25 years, and has been adapted many times for cinema.[[Image:carmilla.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration from ''The Dark Blue'' by [[D. H. Friston]], 1872]]

==Publication==
{{Wikisource}}
''Carmilla'' was first published in the magazine ''The Dark Blue'' in 1872,&lt;ref&gt;The story ran in in three issues of 1872: January (p. 592-606), February (p. 701-714) and March (p. 59-78).&lt;/ref&gt; and then in the author's collection of short stories, ''[[In a Glass Darkly]]'' the same year.

There were two original [[illustrators]] for the story, both of which appeared in the magazine but which do not appear in modern printings of the book. The two illustrators, [[David Henry Friston]] and Michael Fitzgerald, show some inconsistencies in their depiction of the characters, and as such some confusion has arisen in identifying the pictures as part of a continuous plot.

==Plot summary==
The story is presented by Le Fanu as part of the casebook of Dr Hesselius, whose departures from medical orthodoxy rank him as the first [[occult doctor]] in literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwthomas.org/hesselius.htm Dr Martin Hesselius]&lt;/ref&gt; The story is narrated by Laura, one of the two main protagonists of the tale.

Laura begins her tale by relating her childhood in a &quot;picturesque and solitary&quot; castle in the midst of an extensive forest in [[Styria (state)|Styria]] where she lives with her father, a wealthy [[English people|English]] widower, retired from the Austrian Service. When she is six years old, Laura has a vision of a beautiful visitor in her bedchamber. She later claims to have been bitten on the chest, although no wounds are found on her.

12 years later, Laura and her father are admiring the sunset in front of the castle when her father tells her of a letter he received earlier from his friend General Spielsdorf. The General was supposed to bring his niece, Bertha Rheinfeldt, to visit the two, but the niece suddenly died under mysterious circumstances. The General ambiguously concludes that he will discuss the circumstances in detail when they meet later.

Laura is saddened by the loss of a potential friend, and longs for a companion. A carriage accident outside Laura's home unexpectedly brings a girl of Laura's age into the family's care. Her name is Carmilla. Both girls instantly recognize the other from the 'dream' they both had when they were young.

Carmilla appears injured after her carriage accident, but her mysterious mother informs Laura's father that her journey is urgent and cannot be delayed. She arranges to leave her daughter with Laura and her father until she can return in three months. Before she leaves she sternly notes that her daughter will not disclose any information whatsoever about her family, past, or herself and that Carmilla is of sound mind. Laura comments that this information seems needless to say, and her father laughs it off.

Carmilla and Laura grow to be very close friends, but occasionally Carmilla's mood abruptly changes. She sometimes makes unsettling romantic advances towards Laura. Carmilla refuses to tell anything about herself or her background, despite questioning from Laura. Her secrecy isn't the only mysterious thing about her. Carmilla sleeps much of the day, and seems to sleepwalk at night. When a funeral procession passes by the two girls and Laura begins singing a hymn, Carmilla bursts out in rage and scolds Laura for singing a Christian song. When a shipment of family heirloom restored portraits arrives at the castle, Laura finds one of her ancestor, &quot;Mircalla, [[Countess]] Karnstein&quot;, dated 1698. The portrait resembles Carmilla exactly, down to the mole on her neck.

During Carmilla's stay, Laura has nightmares of a fiendish cat-like beast entering her room at night and biting her on the chest. The beast then takes the form of a female figure and disappears through the door without opening it. Laura's health declines and her father has a doctor examine her. He speaks privately with her father and only asks that Laura never be left unattended.

Her father then sets out with Laura in a carriage for the ruined village of Karnstein. They leave a message behind asking Carmilla and one of the governesses entreated to follow after once the perpetually late-sleeping Carmilla wakes up. En route to Karnstein, Laura and her father encounter General Spielsdorf. He tells them his own ghastly story.

Spielsdorf and his niece had met a young woman named Millarca and her enigmatic mother at a costume ball. The General's niece was immediately taken with Millarca. The mother convinced the General that she was an old friend of his and asked that Millarca be allowed to stay with them for three weeks while she attended to a secret matter of great importance.
[[Image:Fitzgerald, funeral from Carmilla.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Funeral'', illustration by Michael Fitzgerald for ''Carmilla'' in ''The Dark Blue'', January 1872]]
The General's niece fell mysteriously ill and suffered exactly the same symptoms as Laura. After consulting with a priestly doctor who he had specially ordered, the General came to the realization that his niece was being visited by a vampire. He hid in a closet with a sword and waited until seeing a fiendish cat-like creature stalk around his niece's bedroom and bite her on the neck. He then leapt from his hiding place and attacked the beast, which took the form of Millarca. She fled through the locked door, unharmed. The General's niece died immediately afterward.

When they arrive at Karnstein the General asks a nearby woodsman where he can find the tomb of Mircalla Karnstein. The woodsman relates that the tomb was relocated long ago, by the hero who vanquished the vampires that haunted the region.

While the General and Laura are left alone in the ruined chapel, Carmilla appears. The General and Carmilla both fly into a rage upon seeing each other and the General attacks her with an axe. Carmilla flees and the General explains to Laura that Carmilla is also Millarca, both anagrams for the original name of the vampire Countess Mircalla Karnstein.

The party is then joined by Baron Vordenburg, the descendant of the hero who rid the area of vampires long ago. Vordenburg is an authority on vampires and has discovered that his ancestor was romantically involved with the Countess Karnstein, before she died and became one of the undead. Using his forefather's notes he locates the hidden tomb of Carmilla. An Imperial Commission is then summoned who exhume and destroy the body of the vampire on behalf of the ruling [[Habsburg Monarchy]], within whose domains Styria is situated.

Afterwards, Laura's father takes her on a year-long vacation to recover from the trauma and regain her health.

==Sources==
As with [[Dracula]], critics have looked for the sources used in the writing of the text. Matthew Gibson has shown that LeFanu used [[Antoine Augustin Calmet|Dom Augustin Calmet]]'s ''Treatise on Vampires and Revenants'', translated into English in 1850 as ''The Phantom World'', [[Sabine Baring-Gould|the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould]]'s ''The Book of Were-wolves'' (1863), and his account of [[Elizabeth Bathory]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s ''Christabel'', and Captain [[Basil Hall]]'s ''[[Schloss]] [[Hainfeld]]; or a Winter in [[Lower Styria]]'' (London and Edinburgh, 1836). Hall's account provides much of the Styrian background and in particular a model for both Carmilla and Laura in the figure of [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall|Jane Anne Cranstoun, Countess Purgstall]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Matthew. [http://www.jslefanu.com/gibson.html ''Jane Cranstoun, Countess Purgstall: A Possible Inspiration for Le Fanu's “CARMILLA”]'' in ''Le Fanu Studies'', November 2007, ISSN 1932-9598&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Matthew (2006). ''Dracula and the Eastern Question: British and French Vampire Narratives of the Nineteenth-century Near East'', ISBN 1-4039-9477-3 &amp; ISBN 1-4039-9477-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Carmilla, the title character, is the original prototype for a legion of female and [[lesbian vampire]]s. Though Le Fanu portrays his vampire's [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] with the circumspection that one would expect for his time, it is evident that [[lesbian]] attraction is the main dynamic between Carmilla and the narrator of the story:

{{quotation|Sometimes after an hour of apathy, my strange and beautiful companion would take my hand and hold it with a fond pressure, renewed again and again; blushing softly, gazing in my face with languid and burning eyes, and breathing so fast that her dress rose and fell with the tumultuous respiration. It was like the ardour of a lover; it embarrassed me; it was hateful and yet overpowering; and with gloating eyes she drew me to her, and her hot lips travelled along my cheek in kisses; and she would whisper, almost in sobs, &quot;You are mine, you ''shall'' be mine, and you and I are one for ever&quot;. ''(&quot;Carmilla&quot;, Chapter 4)''.}}

Carmilla selected exclusively female victims, though only became emotionally involved with a few. Carmilla had [[nocturnal]] habits, but was not confined to the darkness. She had unearthly beauty and was able to change her form and to pass through solid walls. Her animal alter ego was a monstrous black cat, not a large dog as in ''Dracula''. She did, however, sleep in a coffin.

Some critics, among them [[William Veeder]], suggest that ''Carmilla'', notably in its outlandish use of narrative frames, was an important influence on [[Henry James]]' ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]''.

==Bram Stoker's ''Dracula''==
Although ''Carmilla'' is a lesser known and far shorter Gothic vampire story than the generally-considered master work of that genre, ''Dracula'', the latter is heavily influenced by Le Fanu's short story.

In the earliest manuscript of ''Dracula'', dated 8 March 1890, the castle is set in [[Styria]], although the setting was changed to [[Transylvania]] six days later. Stoker's posthumously published [[short story]] &quot;[[Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories|Dracula's Guest]]&quot;, known as the deleted first chapter to ''Dracula'', shows a more obvious and intact debt to &quot;Carmilla&quot;: Both stories are told in the [[first-person narrative|first person]]. ''Dracula'' expands on the idea of a first person account by creating a series of journal entries and logs of different persons and creating a plausible background story for them having been compiled. Stoker also indulges the air of mystery further than Le Fanu by allowing the characters to solve the enigma of the vampire along with the reader.

The descriptions of Carmilla and the character of Lucy in ''Dracula'' are similar, and have become archetypes for the appearance of the waif-like victims and seducers in vampire stories as being tall, slender, languid, and with large eyes, full lips and soft voices. Both women also [[Sleepwalking|sleepwalk]].

Stoker's Dr. [[Abraham Van Helsing]] is a direct parallel to Le Fanu's vampire expert Baron Vordenburg: both characters used to investigate and catalyse actions in opposition to the vampire, and symbolically represent knowledge of the unknown and stability of mind in the onslaught of chaos and death.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Le Fanu, J.S.&quot; in Jack Sullivan (ed) ''The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural'': 260&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Danish people|Danish]] director [[Carl Dreyer]] loosely adapted ''Carmilla'' for his 1932 film ''[[Vampyr]]'' but deleted any references to lesbian sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grant |first=Barry Keith |authorlink= |last2=Sharrett |first2=Christopher |author2-link= |title=Planks of Reason: Essays on the Horror Film |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2004 |location= |page=73 |url =http://books.google.com/books?id=QHg7m_ESR54C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0-8108-5013-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The credits of the original film say that the film is based on ''In A Glass Darkly''. This collection contains five tales, one of which is &quot;Carmilla&quot;. Actually the film draws its central character, Allan Gray, from Le Fanu's Dr. Hesselius; and the scene in which Gray is buried alive is drawn from &quot;The Room in the Dragon Volant&quot;.
*[[French people|French]] director [[Roger Vadim]]'s ''[[Blood and Roses|Et mourir de plaisir]]'' (literally ''And to die of pleasure'', but actually shown in England as ''Blood and Roses'', 1960) is based on ''Carmilla'' and is considered one of the greatest of the vampire genre. The Vadim film thoroughly explores the lesbian implications behind Carmilla's selection of victims, and boasts cinematography by [[Claude Renoir]]. The film's lesbian eroticism was however significantly cut for its US release.
*A more-or-less faithful adaptation starring [[Christopher Lee]] was produced in [[Italy]] in 1964 under the title ''[[La cripta e l'incubo]]'' (''Crypt of the Vampire'' in English).
*The [[Great Britain|British]] [[Hammer Film Productions]] also produced a fairly faithful adaptation of &quot;Carmilla&quot; titled ''[[The Vampire Lovers]]'' (1970) with [[Ingrid Pitt]] in the lead role and [[Madeline Smith]] as her victim/lover. An explicit erotic lesbian theme was emphasised in this film, which was the first of the [[Karnstein Trilogy]], followed by:
**''[[Lust for a Vampire]]'' (1971): here Carmilla ([[Yutte Stensgaard]]), develops [[heterosexual]] interests, despite landing the ideal job for a lesbian vampire as a student in a girls' finishing school. This change in her [[sexual orientation]] seems to have been at the behest of the chief film censor, [[John Trevelyan (censor)|John Trevelyan]], who closely monitored the film in production.
**''[[Twins of Evil]]'' (1971): Mircalla ([[Katja Wyeth]]) plays a very minor role in this story, whose main interest is the two titular characters.
*''[[Captain Kronos – Vampire Hunter]]'' (likewise a Hammer film) features a female vampire from the Karnstein family, and is sometimes considered part of the same continuity.
*The novella served as a very loose basis for the 1971 film ''[[Let's Scare Jessica to Death]]''.
*The novella was freely adapted in [[Spain]] in 1972 as ''The Blood Splattered Bride'' (''La Novia Ensangrentada''), directed by [[Vicente Aranda]].
*The theme of lesbian vampires was further explored in ''[[Vampyres (film)|Vampyres]]'' (1974) by [[José Ramón Larraz]].
*The story was a partial basis for the [[1978]] Mexican horror film ''[[Alucarda]]''.
*In 1990, Gabrielle Beaumont created a film adaptation for a horror [[anthology]] television series ''Nightmare Classics'' titled &quot;Carmilla&quot;, which is one of the more faithful adaptations of the story, though the setting was transported to [[American Civil War|post-Civil War]] [[Deep South]] of the [[United States]]. It starred [[Meg Tilly]] as Carmilla and [[Ione Skye]] as a lonely Southern girl whom Carmilla seduces.
*The story was very loosely adapted in the 2004 [[straight-to-video]] splatter movie ''[[Vampires vs. Zombies]]''.
*Carmilla appears as the &quot;Bride of Dracula&quot; in the direct-to-[[DVD]] animated movie ''[[The Batman Vs. Dracula]] ''(2005).
*Carmilla is also the basic premise for the 2009 movie ''[[Lesbian Vampire Killers]]'', a comedy starring [[Paul McGann]] and [[James Corden]]
*''[[Carmilla (2011 film)]]'' is an upcoming Vampire Romance film directed by Paul Wiffen and starring [[Jennifer Ellison]] and [[Simone Kaye]].
*''[[Styria (currently in production)]]'' is an upcoming film inspired by Carmilla, directed by Mauricio Chernovetzky and Mark Devendorf.&lt;ref&gt;www.styriamovie.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===

*The character of Dr. Hesselius is featured in a [[Mutual Broadcasting Network]] radio drama entitled &quot;[[The Shadow People]]&quot;, an episode from ''[[The Hall of Fantasy]]'' series (1946–1947, 1949–1952, 1952, 1953). The episode casts Dr. Hesselius as an occult sleuth and aired on September 5, 1952.
*On November 20, 1981, the [[CBC Radio]] series ''[[Nightfall (CBC)|Nightfall]]'' aired an adaptation of ''Carmilla'' written by [[Graham Pomeroy]] and [[John Gavin Douglas|John Douglas]].

===Music===
*[[Cradle of Filth]], a popular British [[extreme metal]] band, has produced an album called ''[[Dusk... and Her Embrace]]'' inspired by &quot;Carmilla&quot;, and have also recorded an instrumental track titled &quot;Carmilla's Masque&quot;. The lyric: &quot;Portrait of the Dead Countess&quot; in the track &quot;A Gothic Romance&quot; could be in reference to the portrait found in the novel of the Countess Mircalla. There is also a track on the accompanying EP ''[[Vempire or Dark Faerytales in Phallustein]]'' titled &quot;Queen Of Winter Throned&quot; which contains the lyrics: &quot;Iniquitous/I share Carmilla's mask/A gaunt mephitic voyeur/On the black side of the glass&quot;. Lead singer [[Dani Filth]] has often cited [[Sheridan Le Fanu]] as an inspiration to his lyrics.
*[[Theatres des Vampires]], an Italian [[extreme gothic metal]] band has produced a video single called &quot;Carmilla&quot; for its album [[Moonlight Waltz]]
*[[Lord Vampyr]], an Italian [[extreme gothic metal]] singer, has produced a track called &quot;Carmilla whispers from the grave&quot;, that tells the story of an homonym vampire girl who bites the man she used to love while she was alive.
*Prior to her first record deal, British singer-songwriter [[Kate Bush]] recorded at least thirty officially-unreleased but much-[[bootleg recording|bootleg]]ged demos of original material, circa 1972. One of these, &quot;Surrender into the Roses&quot; (also known as &quot;Carmilla&quot; and &quot;Coming Up&quot;) was inspired by the tale.
*[[Two Witches]], a Finnish [[Gothic rock]] band, created a song in the early 1990s called &quot;Mircalla&quot;, inspired by the novel.
*[[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[Visual Kei]] artist [[Kaya (Japanese musician)|Kaya]] released a single titled ''Carmilla'' in which he portrays himself as a female vampire with a desire to transform his male lover.
*A [[chamber opera]] version of ''Carmilla'' appeared in 1970 (''Carmilla: A Vampire Tale'', music by Ben Johnston, script by Wilford Leach). Seated on a sofa, Laura and Carmilla recount the story retrospectively in song.
*''Carmilla'', a musical theater adaptation by Allan Jaffe and Deborah Atherton circa 1995.
*The 1980s band [[LaHost]]'s track on the 1985 [[EMI]] compilation album 'Fire in Harmony' was 'Blood and Roses' - the lyrics of which are loosely based on the [[Roger Corman]] film version of Carmilla.
*[[The Green Pajamas]]' 2001 album ''In a Glass Darkly: Songs Inspired By The Stories of J.S. Le Fanu'' includes a song &quot;Carmilla&quot;.
*The songs &quot;A Very Strange Agony&quot; and &quot;To Die Only Once&quot; of the Spanish [[symphonic metal]] band Döxa were inspired by &quot;Carmilla&quot;.

===Books===
*The novel ''Carmilla: The Return'', written in 1999 by Kyle Marffin, begins in 19th century [[Austria]] but follows Carmilla's life into 1990s [[Michigan]].
*A vampire named Baron Karnstein appears in ''[[Anno Dracula series#Anno Dracula|Anno Dracula]]'' by [[Kim Newman]]. Carmilla herself is mentioned several times as a former (until her death at the hands of vampire hunters) friend of the book's vampire heroine Geneviève. Some short stories set in the ''Anno Dracula'' universe have also included Carmilla.
*The story of Carmilla is illustrated using old antique etchings by Tiffini Elektra X in the book ''In This House: A Collection of Altered Art Imagery and Collage Techniques''.
*The story &quot;Carmilla&quot; was included in Pam Keesey's collection of lesbian vampire stories, ''Daughters of Darkness'' (1993).

===Comics===
* In 1991, Aircel Comics published a six-issue black and white miniseries of ''Carmilla'' by Steven Jones and [[John Ross (artist)|John Ross]]. It was based on the story by Sheridan Le Fanu and billed as &quot;The Erotic Horror Classic of Female Vampirism&quot;. The first issue was printed in February 1991. The first three issues were an adaptation of the original story, while the latter three were a sequel set in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fuziondigital.com/SPJ/creditscomics.htm Steven Philip Jones Previous Credits in comics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=28117 The Grand Comics Database Team: Carmilla (1991 Series)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Carmilla. Nuestra Señora de los Vampiros'' is a black and white one-shot published in 1999 by Spanish comic publisher Dude Comics based on the story by Sheridan Le Fanu, but with a modern twist. In present day, Carmilla saves a girl named Laura from being [[rape]]d and later gives her Le Fanu's book to read to explain her past. Laura finally becomes Carmilla's companion. Based on a script by [[Roy Thomas]], the comic had two artists with radically different graphic styles: [[Rafa Fonteriz]] draw the present day part, while Isaac M. del Rivero draw the part based on Le Fanu's book.
*''Graphic Classics, vol. 14: Gothic Classics'' (2007) contains an adaptation of ''Carmilla'', illustrated by Lisa K. Weber and adapted by Rod Lott.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graphicclassics.com/pgs/gc14.htm Gothic Classics: Graphic Classics Volume Fourteen]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, Alucard kills her with only one bullet, in a matter of one second.
*In episode 30 and beyond of ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'', a character named [[Shadow Riders#Camula|Camula]] is introduced as a soul-stealing vampiress trying to gain control of the three Sacred Beast cards. She is portrayed with a stereotypical Romanian accent in the English dub.

In ''Rondo of Blood'', Carmilla appears as a boss alongside Laura. In the game ''Circle of the Moon'', Carmilla plays a much larger role as the main antagonist in this game than in others and is responsible for the resurrection of Dracula.

A '''cabal''' is a group of people united in some close design together, usually to promote their private views and interests in a [[Church body|church]], [[state (polity)|state]], or other community, often by [[Wiktionary:intrigue|intrigue]].  Cabals are sometimes [[secret societies]] composed of a few designing persons, and at other times are manifestations of [[emergence|emergent behavior]] in [[society]] or [[governance]] on the part of a community of persons who have well established public affiliation or kinship. The term can also be used to refer to the designs of such persons or to the practical consequences of their emergent behavior, and also holds a general meaning of intrigue and [[Conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]]. Its usage carries strong connotations of shadowy corners, back rooms and insidious influence; a cabal is more evil and selective than, say, a [[Political faction|faction]], which is simply selfish; because of this negative connotation, few organizations use the term to refer to themselves or their internal subdivisions.  Amongst the exceptions is [[Discordianism]], in which the term is used to refer to an identifiable group within the Discordian religion.

==Origins of the word==
The term ''cabal'' derives from [[Kabbalah]] (a word that has numerous spelling variations), the mystical interpretation of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] scripture, and originally meant either an [[occult]] doctrine or a [[secret]]. It was introduced into English in the publication of ''Cabala'', a curious medley of letters and papers of the reigns of James and Charles I that appeared in 1654.&lt;ref&gt;''Cabala: sive Scrinia Sacra. Mysteries of State &amp; Government in Letters of illustrious Persons and great Agents; in the Reigns of Henry the Eighth, Queen Elizabeth, K: James and the late King Charls. In two Parts. In which the Secrets of Empire, and Publique manage of Affairs are contained.'' [http://www.bartleby.com/217/0804.html ''Cambridge History of English and American Literature'' (1907–21), vol VII, ch. viii.4 ''The Compleat Ambassador''].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association with Charles II==
{{main|Cabal Ministry}}
The term took on its present meaning from a group of ministers of King [[Charles II of England]] ([[Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford of Chudleigh|Sir Thomas Clifford]], [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]], the [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Ashley]], and [[John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale|Lord Lauderdale]]), whose initial letters coincidentally spelled CABAL, and who were the signers of the public [[Treaty of Dover]] that allied England to France in a prospective war against the Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will and Ariel.  ''The Age of Louis XIV.'' (page 277) New York: Simon And Schuster, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[Cabal Ministry]] they formed can hardly be seen as such — the Scot Lauderdale was not much involved in [[English governance]] at all; while the Catholic ministers of the Cabal, Clifford and Arlington, were never much in sympathy with the Protestants, Buckingham and Ashley, nor did Buckingham and Ashley get on very well with each other.  Thus the &quot;[[Cabal Ministry]]&quot; never really unified in its members' aims and sympathies, and fell apart by 1672; Lord Ashley, who became Earl of Shaftesbury, later became one of Charles II's fiercest opponents. The explanation that the word originated as an [[acronym]] from the names of the group of ministers is a [[folk etymology]], although the coincidence was noted at the time and could possibly have popularized its use.  The group, who came to prominence after the fall of Charles's first prime minister, [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]], in 1667, was rather called the Cabal because of its secretiveness and lack of responsibility to the &quot;Country party&quot; then run out of power.

==Use in relation to computers and Usenet==
[[Image:valve cabal.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A Cabal room in use at [[Valve Software]].]]During the rise of [[Usenet]], the term was used as a semi-ironic description of the efforts of people to maintain some order over the chaotic,  anarchic Usenet community ''(see [[backbone cabal]])''. As in this specific case, references to an alleged cabal often fall within the realm of [[conspiracy theory]].

[[Valve Software]], the creators of games such as [[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]], use &quot;Cabal Rooms&quot; when working on projects such as new games or [[bug fix]]es. These rooms usually comprise 10-15 people, many computers and design technologies, and at least one whiteboard. (See adjacent image).

As mentioned in the article &quot;The Enemy Within&quot; by [[Mark Bowden]], published in the June 2010 edition of ''[[The Atlantic]],'' the Conficker Cabal is a team specialists working to defeat the [[Conficker]] worm. The worm is believed to have infected an estimated 1.5 million machines worldwide. The Conficker Cabal includes Rodney Joffey, vice president and chief technologist for Neustar, Adre' M. DiMono, one of the world's foremost authorities on Botnets, and Philip Porras who operates a large network of honeypots for SRI International. Despite the negative connotations associated with the term &quot;Cabal,&quot; the name has stuck with this particular team of &quot;good-guy geeks.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/06/the-enemy-within/8098/ The Enemy Within] June, 2010, By Mark Bowden (''[[The Atlantic]]''); Technology&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current usage==
[[File:Cabal in english.jpg|thumb|300px]]
The following are two recent examples of the use of the word 'cabal': the first came in an accusation by former [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell|Colin Powell's]] chief of staff, [[Lawrence Wilkerson]], who claimed that the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration's]] foreign policy is run by a &quot;Cheney-Rumsfeld cabal&quot; implying a sinister intent;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/21/politics/21wilkerson.html?incamp=article_popular Former Powell Aide Says Bush Policy Is Run by 'Cabal'] October 21, 2005, By Brian Knowlton (''[[NYT]]''); Foreign Desk&lt;/ref&gt; the second was by former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who has rallied the world community to support UN sanctions against Zimbabwe, denouncing the regime's leaders as a &quot;criminal cabal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/Zimbabwe/0,,2-11-1662_2354782,00.html Zim led by 'criminal cabal': Africa: Zimbabwe: News24&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Famous [[crokinole]] player and analyst, Eric Miltenburg of Toronto referred to the &quot;Eagan-Fitzgerald Cabal&quot; of the 1940s, when the two families shared their playing secrets with each other.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archive.org/details/Crokinole&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently on the [[Comedy Central]] program ''[[The Daily Show]]'', the phrase &quot;a global cabal of [[Jews]]&quot; is referenced from time to time, as a spoof on [[Anti-Semitism#Anti-Semitic conspiracy theories|antisemitic conspiracy theories]]. The existence or otherwise of cabals has led to the [[List of Internet phenomena|Internet phenomenon]] originating on [[Usenet]], &quot;TINC&quot; (standing for ''[[There Is No Cabal]]''). Many [[Masonic conspiracy theories]] have pictured [[Freemasonry]] as an [[internationalist]] secret cabal.

'''Cytochromes''' are, in general, membrane-bound [[hemoprotein]]s that contain [[heme]] groups and carry out [[electron transport]].

They are found either as [[Protein subunit|monomeric protein]]s (e.g., [[cytochrome c]]) or as [[Protein subunit|subunits]] of bigger enzymatic complexes that catalyze [[redox]] reactions.  They are found in the [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] inner membrane and [[endoplasmic reticulum]] of [[eukaryote]]s, in the [[chloroplast]]s of plants, in [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[microorganism]]s, and in [[bacteria]].

==History==
Cytochromes were initially described in 1884 by MacMunn as respiratory pigments (myohematin or histohematin).&lt;ref name=MacMunn&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1886.0007 | url = http://www.jstor.org/pss/109482 | pages = 267–298 | author1 = Mac Munn, C.

cytochromes ''a'' (605&amp;nbsp;nm), ''b'' (~565&amp;nbsp;nm), and ''c'' (550&amp;nbsp;nm). The UV-visible spectroscopic signatures of hemes are still used to identify heme type from the reduced bis-pyridine-ligated state, i.e., the pyridine hemochrome method. Within each class, cytochrome ''a'', ''b'', or ''c'', early cytochromes are numbered consecutively, e.g. cyt ''c'', cyt ''c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', and cyt ''c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', with more recent examples designated by their reduced state R-band maximum, e.g. cyt ''c&lt;sub&gt;559&lt;/sub&gt;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14871137&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reedy, C.

==Structure and function==
The [[heme]] group is a highly-conjugated ring system (which allows its [[electron]]s to be very mobile) surrounding a metal ion, which readily interconverts between the oxidation states.  For many cytochromes, the metal ion present is that of ''[[iron]]'', which interconverts between Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (reduced) and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (oxidised) states ([[electron transfer|electron-transfer]] processes) or between Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (reduced) and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (formal, oxidised) states (oxidative processes). Cytochromes are, thus, capable of performing [[redox|oxidation and reduction]]. Because the cytochromes (as well as other complexes) are held within membranes in an organized way, the [[redox]] reactions are carried out in the proper sequence for maximum efficiency.

In the process of [[oxidative phosphorylation]], which is the principal energy-generating process undertaken by organisms, which need oxygen to survive, other membrane-bound and -soluble [[complex (chemistry)|complex]]es and [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s are involved in the chain of redox reactions, with the additional net effect that protons (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are transported across the mitochondrial inner membrane.  The resulting [[Chemiosmotic potential|transmembrane proton gradient]] ([protonmotive force]) is used to generate [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], which is the universal chemical energy currency of life.  ATP is consumed to drive cellular processes that require energy (such as synthesis of macromolecules, active transport of molecules across the membrane, and assembly of [[flagellum|flagella]]).

==Types==
Several kinds of cytochrome exist and can be distinguished by [[spectroscopy]], exact structure of the heme group, inhibitor sensitivity, and reduction potential.

Three types of cytochrome are distinguished by their prosthetic groups:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| '''Type''' || '''prosthetic group'''
 |-
 | [[Cytochrome a]] || [[heme a]]
 |-
 | [[Cytochrome b]] || [[heme b]]
 |-
 | [[Cytochrome d]] || tetrapyrrolic [[chelate]] of [[iron]]&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Cytochrome+d}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

The definition of [[cytochrome c]] is not defined in terms of the heme group.&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Cytochrome+c+Group}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no &quot;cytochrome e,&quot; but there is a [[cytochrome f]], which is often considered a type of cytochrome c.&lt;ref&gt;{{eMedicineDictionary|Cytochrome}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s, these cytochromes are often combined in [[Electron transfer chain|electron transport]] and related metabolic pathways:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| '''Cytochromes ''' || '''Combination'''
 |-
 | ''a'' and ''a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' || [[Cytochrome c oxidase]] (&quot;Complex IV&quot;) with electrons delivered to complex by soluble [[cytochrome c]] (hence the name)
 |-
 | ''b'' and [[Cytochrome C1|''c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'']] || [[Coenzyme Q - cytochrome c reductase]] (&quot;Complex III&quot;)
 |-
 | ''b&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'' and [[Cytochrome f|''f'']] || [[Plastoquinol—plastocyanin reductase]]
|}

A completely distinct family of cytochromes is known as the [[cytochrome P450 oxidase]]s, so named for the characteristic [[Soret peak]] formed by absorbance of light at wavelengths near 450&amp;nbsp;nm when the heme iron is reduced (with [[sodium dithionite]]) and complexed to [[carbon monoxide]]. These enzymes are primarily involved in [[steroidogenesis]] and [[detoxification]].

Finn and Hester decided to form a new band during the Split Enz farewell tour, ''Enz with a Bang'', during November and December 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt; Seymour approached Finn during the [[after party]] for the Melbourne show and asked if he could audition for the new band.&lt;ref name=&quot;sss&quot;/&gt; '''The Mullanes''' formed in Melbourne in early 1985 with Finn, Hester, Seymour and guitarist [[Craig Hooper]] (ex-[[The Reels]]) and first performed on 11 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt; They secured a record contract with [[Capitol Records]], but Hooper left the band before the remaining trio moved to Los Angeles to record their debut album.&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howl&quot;&gt;[http://www.howlspace.com.au/en/crowdedhouse/crowdedhouse.htm &quot;Crowded House&quot;] ''HowlSpace''&lt;/ref&gt; At Capitol's behest, the band's name was changed to '''Crowded House''', which alluded to the lack of space at the [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]] apartment they shared during the recording of the album ''[[Crowded House (album)|Crowded House]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howl&quot;/&gt; Former Split Enz keyboardist Eddie Rayner produced the track &quot;Can't Carry On&quot; and was asked to join the band.

The album's first single, &quot;[[Mean to Me (Crowded House song)|Mean to Me]]&quot;, reached the Australian [[Kent Music Report]] Singles Chart top 30 in June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent&quot;/&gt; It failed to chart in the US,&lt;ref name=&quot;AllmusicSingle&quot;/&gt; but moderate American airplay introduced US listeners to the group.

The single, &quot;[[Don't Dream It's Over]]&quot;, was released in December 1986 and reached number one on the [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand|New Zealand Singles Chart]] and number eight in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NZCharts&quot;/&gt; It was also a big international hit, reaching number two on the US Billboard Hot 100&lt;ref name=&quot;AllmusicSingle&quot;/&gt; and number one in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&amp;file_num=nlc008388.0804&amp;volume=46&amp;issue=4&amp;issue_dt=May%2002%201987&amp;type=1&amp;interval=24&amp;PHPSESSID=50lgngc1daom80fs32cjjs9ne6 &quot;Top Singles – Volume 46, No. 4, May&amp;nbsp;02&amp;nbsp;1987&quot;] ''Library and Archives Canada''&lt;/ref&gt; It remains the group's most commercially successful song.

As the band's primary songwriter, Neil Finn was under pressure to create a second album to match their debut and the band joked that one potential title for the new release was ''Mediocre Follow-Up''.&lt;ref name=&quot;sss&quot;/&gt; Eventually titled ''Temple of Low Men'', their second album was released in July 1988 with strong promotion by Capitol Records.

Multi-instrumentalist [[Mark Hart]], who would eventually become a full band member, replaced Rayner in January 1989. After the tour, Finn fired Seymour from the band.&lt;ref name=denton /&gt; [[Music journalist]] [[Ed Nimmervoll]] claimed that Seymour's temporary departure was because Finn blamed him for causing his [[writer's block]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Howl&quot;/&gt; however Finn cited &quot;artistic differences&quot; as the reason.&lt;ref name=denton /&gt; Seymour said that after a month he contacted Finn and they agreed that he would return to the band.&lt;ref name=denton /&gt;

{{Main|Tim Finn|Woodface|Together Alone}}
[[Image:MarkHartCrop.jpg|thumb|left|Multi-instrumentalist Mark Hart]]Crowded House took a break after the Canadian leg of the ''Temple of Low Men'' tour. Neil Finn and his brother Tim recorded songs they had co-written for their own album, ''[[Finn (album)|Finn]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;sss&quot;/&gt; Following the recording sessions with Tim, Neil began writing and recording a third Crowded House album with Hester and Seymour, but these tracks were rejected by the record company, so Neil asked Tim if Crowded House could use the ''Finn'' songs. Tim jokingly agreed on the proviso that he become a member, which Neil apparently took literally. With Tim as an official member, the band returned to the studio. The new tracks, as well as some from the previously rejected recordings were combined to make ''Woodface'', which was released in July 1991. The album features eight tracks co-written by Neil and Tim,&lt;ref name=&quot;sss&quot;/&gt; which feature the brothers [[harmony|harmonising]] on lead vocals, except on the sombre &quot;All I Ask&quot; on which Tim sang lead. The track was later used on AIDS awareness commercials in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;sss&quot;/&gt; Five of the album's tracks were Neil's solo compositions and two were by Hester, the exuberant &quot;Italian Plastic&quot;, which became a crowd favourite at concerts&lt;ref name=&quot;sss&quot;/&gt; and the [[hidden track]] &quot;I'm Still Here&quot;.

&quot;[[Chocolate Cake (song)|Chocolate Cake]]&quot;, a humorous comment on American excesses that wasn't taken well by some US critics and sections of the American public, was released in June 1991 as the first single. Perhaps unsurprisingly it failed to chart in the US, however it reached number two on Billboard's [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;AllmusicSingle&quot;/&gt; The song peaked at number seven in New Zealand and reached the top 20 in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;AusCharts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NZCharts&quot;/&gt; The second single, &quot;[[Fall at Your Feet]]&quot;, was less successful in Australia and New Zealand but did at least reach the US [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AllmusicSingle&quot;/&gt; The album reached number one in New Zealand,&lt;ref name=&quot;NZCharts&quot;/&gt; number two in Australia,&lt;ref name=&quot;AusCharts&quot;/&gt; number six in the UK&lt;ref name=&quot;UKCharts&quot;&gt;[http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=4856 &quot;Chart Stats – Crowded House&quot;] ''Chart Stats''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=[[British Hit Singles &amp; Albums]]|edition=19th|publisher=[[Guinness World Records|Guinness]]|location=London, UK|isbn=1904994105|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made the top 20 in several European countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://norwegiancharts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Crowded+House &quot;Discography Crowded House&quot;] ''norwegiancharts.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://swedishcharts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Crowded+House &quot;Discography Crowded House&quot;] ''swedishcharts.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dutchcharts.nl/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Crowded+House &quot;Discografie Crowded House&quot;] ''dutchcharts.nl''&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast it had limited success in the US, only reaching number 83 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;AllmusicAlbum&quot;/&gt;

Tim left Crowded House during the ''Woodface'' tour in November 1991, part-way through the UK leg.&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt; Performances on this tour, at the Town and Country Club in London, were recorded live and given a limited release in Australia, while individual songs from those shows were released as B-sides of singles in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amws.com.au/c/crowded-house/discography/discography.html &quot;Crowded House Discography&quot;] ''amws.com.au'' – 12 January 1994&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1993 the [[Politics of New Zealand|New Zealand Government]] recommended that the Queen award an OBE to Neil and Tim Finn for their contribution to the music of New Zealand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunkin&quot;/&gt;

For their fourth album, ''Together Alone'', Crowded House used New Zealand-based producer [[Martin Glover]] (aka Youth) and invited touring musician Mark Hart (guitar &amp; keyboards) to become a permanent band member.&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howl&quot;/&gt; The album was recorded ar [[Karekare, New Zealand|Karekare]] Beach, New Zealand, which gave its name to the opening track, &quot;Kare Kare&quot;. The album was released in October 1993 and sold well internationally on the strength of lead single &quot;[[Distant Sun]]&quot; and followup &quot;[[Private Universe]]&quot;. It topped the New Zealand Album Chart,&lt;ref name=&quot;NZCharts&quot;/&gt; reached number 2 in Australia&lt;ref name=&quot;AusCharts&quot;/&gt; and number 4 in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;UKCharts&quot;/&gt; &quot;[[Locked Out]]&quot; was the album's first US single and received airplay on MTV and [[VH1]].

Neil Finn (left) and Mark Hart]]Crowded House were mid way through a US tour when Paul Hester quit the band on 15 April 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howl&quot;/&gt; He flew home to Melbourne to await the birth of his first child and indicated that he required more time with his family.&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howl&quot;/&gt; [[Wally Ingram]], drummer for support act [[Sheryl Crow]], temporarily filled in&lt;ref name=&quot;Howl&quot;/&gt; until a replacement, [[Peter Jones (drummer)|Peter Jones]] (ex-Harem Scarem, [[Vince Jones]], [[Kate Ceberano]]'s Septet) was found.&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt; After the tour, the [[Finn Brothers]] released their album ''Finn'' in November 1995. In June 1996, at a press conference to announce the release of their greatest hits album ''[[Recurring Dream (album)|Recurring Dream]]'', Neil revealed that Crowded House were to disband. The June 1996 concerts in Europe and Canada were to be their final performances.&lt;ref name=&quot;sss&quot; /&gt;

''Recurring Dream'' contained four songs from each of the band's studio albums, along with three new songs. The album debuted at number one in Australia,&lt;ref name=&quot;AusCharts&quot;/&gt; New Zealand&lt;ref name=&quot;NZCharts&quot;/&gt; and the UK&lt;ref name=&quot;UKCharts&quot;/&gt; in July 1996. Early copies included a bonus CD of live material. The album's three new songs, which were released as singles, were &quot;[[Instinct (song)|Instinct]]&quot;, &quot;[[Not the Girl You Think You Are]]&quot; and &quot;[[Everything Is Good for You]]&quot;, which featured backing vocals from [[Pearl Jam]]'s [[Eddie Vedder]]. Paul Hester returned to the band to play drums on the three new tracks.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Peter &amp; Post, Liz [http://www.frenz.com/crowdedhouse/timeline.html &quot;Timeline – The Crowded House Refresher Course&quot;] ''frenz.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

Worried that their goodbye had been too low-key and had disregarded their home fans, the band performed the ''Farewell to the World'' concert on the steps of the [[Sydney Opera House]] on 24 November 1996, which raised funds for the [[Sydney Children's Hospital]]. The concert featured the line-up of Neil Finn, Nick Seymour, Mark Hart and Paul Hester. Tim Finn and Peter Jones both made guest appearances. Support bands on the day were [[Custard (band)|Custard]], [[Powderfinger]] and [[You Am I]]. The concert had one of the highest live audiences in Australian history with the crowd being estimated at between 120,000 and 250,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;sss&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;linernotes&quot;&gt;{{Cite album-notes|title=Farewell to the World|albumlink=Farewell to the World|bandname=Crowded House|year=2006|notestitle= |url= |first=David |last=Hepworth |authorlink=David Hepworth |coauthors= |page=|pages=|format=|publisher=[[Parlophone]]|publisherid=|location=|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Farewell to the World'' was released on VHS in December 1996. In 2007, a double CD and a DVD were issued as to commemorate the concert's ten year anniversary. The DVD featured newly recorded audio commentary by Finn, Hart and Seymour and other new bonus material.&lt;ref name=&quot;linernotes&quot;/&gt;

===Between farewell and reunion (1996–2006)===
{{Main|Afterglow (Crowded House album)|Deadstar|7 Worlds Collide|Everyone Is Here|Tarmac Adam}}
[[Image:Paul-hester-sf-np1.jpg|thumb|left|Paul Hester 1959 – 2005.]]Following the 1996 break-up of Crowded House, the members embarked upon a variety of projects. Neil Finn released two solo studio albums, ''[[Try Whistling This]]'' (1998) and ''[[One Nil]]'' (2001), as well as two live albums, ''[[Sessions at West 54th (Neil Finn album)|Sessions at West 54th]]'' (2000) and ''[[7 Worlds Collide (album)|7 Worlds Collide]]'' (2001). ''7 Worlds Collide'' saw him performing with guest musicians including  [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Johnny Marr]], [[Ed O'Brien]] and [[Phil Selway]] of [[Radiohead]], Tim Finn, [[Lisa Germano]] and Betchadupa (featuring his son [[Liam Finn]]). A double CD and DVD of the shows were released in November 2001.

Tim Finn had resumed his solo career after leaving the group in 1992 and he also worked with Neil on a second [[Finn Brothers]] album, ''Everyone Is Here'', which was released in 2004. Paul Hester joined The Finn Brothers on stage for three songs at their Palais Theatre show in Melbourne at the end of 2004. Nick Seymour also joined them on stage in Dublin, where he was living, in 2004. Peter Jones and Nick Seymour joined Australian group [[Deadstar]] for their second album, ''Milk'', in 1997. Seymour later worked as a record producer in Dublin, producing Irish group [[Bell X1]]'s debut album, ''[[Neither Am I]]'' in 2000. Mark Hart rejoined [[Supertramp]] in the late 1990s and later toured with [[Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band]]. In 2001 he released a solo album, ''Nada Sonata''.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1214006|pure_url=yes}} &quot;Nada Sonata &gt; Overview&quot;] ''Allmusic''&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Hester worked with children's entertainers [[The Wiggles]], playing &quot;Paul the Cook&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376988/fullcredits#cast &quot;Paul Hester&quot;] ''[[IMDb]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He also had his own [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] show ''Hessie's Shed'' in Australia from late 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt; He formed the band Largest Living Things,&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt; which was the name rejected by Capitol Records in favour of Crowded House.&lt;ref name=hessie/&gt; It was on ''Hessie's Shed'' that Finn, Hester and Seymour last shared a stage, on an episode filmed as part of Finn's promotion for his solo album ''Try Whistling This'' in 1998. Finn and Hester performed &quot;[[Not the Girl You Think You Are]]&quot; with Largest Living Things, before being joined by Seymour for &quot;[[Sister Madly]]&quot; and a version of [[Paul Kelly (musician)|Paul Kelly]]'s &quot;Leaps and Bounds&quot;, which also featured Kelly on vocals. In late 2003, Hester hosted the series ''Music Max's Sessions''. Hester and Seymour were reunited when they both joined singer-songwriter Matt O'Donnell's Melbourne-based group [[Tarmac Adam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hem2.passagen.se/honga/database/h/hesterpaul.html &quot;Paul Hester&quot;] ''[[Australian Rock Database]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The band released one album, 2003's ''Handheld Torch'', which was produced by Seymour.

In May 1999 Crowded House issued a compilation of unreleased songs, ''[[Afterglow (Crowded House album)|Afterglow]]'', which included the track &quot;Recurring Dream&quot;, recorded when the group were still called The Mullanes and included Craig Hooper on guitar.&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt; The album's liner notes included information about the songs, written by music journalist [[David Hepworth]]. Some limited-release versions included a second CD with songwriting commentary by Finn. The liner notes confirmed that Crowded House had no plans to reunite at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt; A 2003 compilation album, ''[[Classic Masters (Crowded House album)|Classic Masters]]'', was released only in the US, while 2005 saw the release of the album ''[[She Will Have Her Way]]'', a collection of cover versions of Crowded House, Split Enz, Tim Finn and Finn Brothers songs by Australasian female artists. The album reached the top 5 in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://charts.org.nz/showitem.asp?interpret=&amp;titel=She+Will+Have+Her+Way+%2D+The+Songs+Of+Tim+%26+Neil+Finn&amp;cat=a &quot;She Will Have Her Way – The Songs Of Tim &amp; Neil Finn (Album)&quot;] ''charts.org.nz''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 March 2005 Paul Hester was found dead, after hanging himself from a tree in a park near his home in Melbourne. He was 46&amp;nbsp;years old. His obituary in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' stated that he had fought, &quot;A long battle with depression.&quot;&lt;ref name=hessie /&gt; Following the news of Hester's death, Nick Seymour joined The Finn Brothers on stage at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, where the three played in memory of Paul. A snare drum with a top hat on it stood at the front of the stage as a tribute.&lt;ref&gt;Button, James [http://www.theage.com.au/news/Music/The-show-goes-on/2005/03/29/1111862390124.html &quot;The show goes on in memory of Hester&quot;] ''[[The Age]]'' – 30 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 2010 Neil Finn said, &quot;When we lost Paul it was like someone pulled the rug out from underneath everything, a terrible jolt out of the dark blue. He was the best drummer I had ever played with and for many years, my closest friend.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concordmusicgroup.com/artists/Crowded-House/ &quot;About Crowded House&quot;] ''concordmusicgroup.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reunion and ''Time On Earth'' (2006–2009)===
{{Main|Time on Earth|Matt Sherrod}}
[[Image:Matt Sherrod Crowded House Dublin 220607.jpg|thumb|right|Matt Sherrod, Dublin, 2007.]]In 2006 Neil Finn asked Nick Seymour to play bass on his third solo album. Seymour agreed and the two joined up with producer and multi-instrumentalist [[Ethan Johns]] to begin recording.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howl&quot;/&gt; As the recording sessions progressed it was decided that the album would be issued under the Crowded House band name, rather than as a Neil Finn solo album. In January 2007, the group publicly announced their reformation and on 23 February, after 20&amp;nbsp;days of auditions, former [[Beck]] drummer [[Matt Sherrod]] joined Finn, Seymour and Mark Hart to complete the new line up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howl&quot;/&gt; As Sherrod and Hart had not participated in the initial sessions, four new tracks were recorded with producer [[Steve Lillywhite]] including the album's first single &quot;[[Don't Stop Now]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howl&quot;/&gt;

On 17 March 2006 the band played a live show at their rehearsal studio in front of around fifty fans, friends and family. The performance was streamed live as a [[webcast]]. The two-and-a-half hour set included some new tracks, including &quot;Silent House&quot; co-written by Finn with [[Dixie Chicks]] vocalist [[Natalie Maines]]. A concert onboard ''[[The Thekla]]'', moored in [[Bristol]], followed on 19 March. Crowded House played at the Marquee Theatre in Tempe, Arizona on 26 April as a warm-up for their appearance at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Festival]] on 29 April in [[Indio, California]]. They also played at the Australian [[Live Earth concert, Sydney|Live Earth]] concert in Sydney on 7 July. The next day, Finn and Seymour were interviewed on ''[[Rove (TV series)|Rove Live]]'' and the band, with Hart and Sherrod, performed &quot;Don't Stop Now&quot; to promote the new album, which was titled ''Time on Earth''. The single was a minor hit in Australia&lt;ref name=&quot;AusCharts&quot;/&gt; and the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;UKCharts&quot;/&gt; The album was released worldwide in June and July. It topped the album chart in New Zealand&lt;ref name=&quot;NZCharts&quot;/&gt; and made number 2 in Australia&lt;ref name=&quot;AusCharts&quot;/&gt; and number 3 in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;UKCharts&quot;/&gt;

On 6 December 2008 Crowded House played the [[Homebake]] festival in Sydney, with warm up gigs at small venues in Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney. For these shows the band were augmented by multi-instrumentalist [[Don McGlashan]] and Neil's younger son, Elroy Finn, on guitar. On 14 March 14, 2009 the band joined Neil's older son, Liam Finn, on stage for three songs at the [[Sound Relief]] concert in Melbourne.

===''Intriguer'' (2009–current)===
{{Main|Intriguer|The Very Very Best of Crowded House|He Will Have His Way}}
[[Image:NickSeymour2007.jpg|thumb|left|Nick Seymour, Barcelona, October 2007.]]Crowded House began recording their follow-up to ''Time on Earth'' in April 2009, at Finn's own [[Roundhead Studios]]. The album, ''[[Intriguer]]'' was produced by [[Jim Scott (producer)|Jim Scott]] who had worked on ''[[The Sun Came Out]]'' by Neil's 7 Worlds Collide project. In August 2009, Finn travelled to Los Angeles to record some overdubs at Jim Scott's Los Angeles studio before they began mixing tracks. The album was released in June 2010, in time for the band's appearance at the [[West Coast Blues &amp; Roots Festival]] near [[Perth, Western Australia]]. Finn stated that the album contains some, &quot;Unexpected twists and turns&quot; and some songs that, &quot;Sound like nothing we've done before.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Jody [http://www.spinnermusic.co.uk/2010/04/21/crowded-house-new-album-intriguer/ &quot;Crowded House Return With New Album Intriguer&quot;] ''spinnermusic.co.uk'' – 21 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; ''Intriguer'' topped the Australian album chart,&lt;ref name=&quot;AusCharts&quot;/&gt; reached number 3 in New Zealand&lt;ref name=&quot;NZCharts&quot;/&gt; and number 12 in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;UKCharts&quot;/&gt;

Crowded House undertook an extensive world tour in 2010 in support of ''Intriguer''. This was the first album where the band regularly interacted with fans via the internet on their own re-launched website, Twitter and Facebook. The band sold recordings of the shows on the ''Intriguer'' tour on USB [[flash drives]] and made individual live tracks available for free download. 

A new compilation album, [[The Very Very Best of Crowded House]], was released in October 2010 to celebrate the band's 25th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crowded-houses-top-hits-and-fan-favorites-gathered-for-the-very-very-best-of-crowded-house-to-be-released-october-26-by-capitolemi-101974448.html &quot;Crowded House's Top Hits and Fan Favorites Gathered for 'The Very Very Best Of Crowded House,' to be Released 26 October by Capitol/EMI&quot;] ''[[PR Newswire]]'' – 1 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It includes 19 of the band's greatest hits and is also available in a box set with a 25 track DVD of their music videos. A deluxe digital version, available for download only, has 32 tracks including a rare 1987 live recording of the band's version of the [[Hunters &amp; Collectors]] song &quot;[[Throw Your Arms Around Me]]&quot;. No mention of this album has been made on the band's official website or Twitter page, which suggests that they are not involved with its release. 

Following the success of the album ''She Will Have Her Way'' in 2005, a second album of cover versions of Finn Brothers songs, ''[[He Will Have His Way]]'', was released on 12 November 2010. All tracks on this album are performed by Australasian male artists.&lt;ref name=TSFWO&gt;Kara, [http://www.theinsoundfromwayout.com/2010/10/hwhhw/ &quot;He Will Have His Way: The Songs of Tim &amp; Neil Finn – out 12 November&quot;] ''The Sound From Way Out'' – 26 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Songwriting and musical influences===
As the primary songwriter for the band, Neil Finn has always set the tone for the band's sound. Allmusic said that Finn, &quot;Has consistently proven his knack for crafting high-quality songs that combine irresistible melodies with meticulous lyrical detail.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Woodstra, Chris [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p76135|pure_url=yes}} &quot;Neil Finn &gt; Biography&quot;] ''Allmusic''&lt;/ref&gt; Neil's brother Tim was an early and important musical influence. Neil first saw Tim play with Split Enz in 1972, he said, &quot;That performance and those first songs made a lasting impression on me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mushroommusic.com.au/songwriters/78/finn-neil &quot;Neil Finn &gt; Biography&quot;] ''[[Mushroom Records|Mushroom Music Publishing]]''&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was another significant musical influence, encouraging him to listen to a variety of genres, including [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish folk music]] and [[Māori music]]. She would play piano at family parties and encourage Neil and Tim to accompany her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isound.com/neil_finn &quot;Neil Finn &gt; Bio&quot;] ''isound.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Album covers, costumes and set design===
Bassist Nick Seymour, who is also an artist, designed or co-designed all of the band's album covers and interior artwork. He also designed some of the costumes worn by the group, notably those from the cover of the group's debut album ''Crowded House''. Seymour collaborated with Finn and Hester on the set design of some of their early music videos, including &quot;Don't Dream It's Over&quot; and &quot;Better Be Home Soon&quot;. Since the band reunited, Seymour has again desiged their album covers.&lt;ref name=denton /&gt;

The majority of the covers for the band's singles were not designed by Seymour. The artwork for &quot;Pineapple Head&quot; was created by [[Reg Mombassa]] of [[Mental As Anything]]. For the first four albums Mombassa and [[Noel Crombie]], who had been the main designer of Split Enz's artwork, assisted Seymour in creating sets and costumes. For the ''Farewell to the World'' concerts Crombie designed the set, while Mombassa and Seymour designed promotional materials and artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Crowded House, ''Farewell to the World'' concert film end credits, released December 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{French literature (small)}}
'''Colette''' was the surname of the [[France|French]] [[novelist]] '''Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette''' (28 January 1873 &amp;ndash; 3 August 1954). She is best known for her novel ''[[Gigi]]'' (upon which the stage and film [[Musical comedy|musical comedies]] by [[Lerner and Loewe|Lerner &amp; Loewe]], of the same title, were based).

==Early life, marriage==
Colette was born in Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye, Yonne, in the Burgundy Region of France, the daughter of Jules-Joseph Colette and Adèle Eugénie Sidonie Landoy (&quot;Sido&quot;). In 1893 she married [[Henri Gauthier-Villars]], a famous bisexual wit known as &quot;Willy&quot;, who was 15 years her senior.

Her first books, the ''[[Claudine (book series)|Claudine]]'' series, were published under the pen name of her husband, &quot;Willy&quot;, writer, music critic, &quot;literary charlatan and degenerate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/colette.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Claudine'' still has the power to charm; in ''belle epoque'' France it was downright shocking, much to Willy's satisfaction and profit.

==Music hall career, affairs with women==
[[Image:Colette in Rêve d'Égypte.jpg|thumb|left|Colette in a publicity still for ''Rêve d'Égypte'']]
In 1906 she left the unfaithful Gauthier-Villars, living for a time at the home of the American writer and salonist [[Natalie Barney]]. The two had a short affair, and remained friends until Colette's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;rodriguez&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Rodriguez | first = Suzanne | year = 2002 | title = Wild Heart: A Life: Natalie Clifford Barney and the Decadence of Literary Paris | location = New York | publisher = HarperCollins | isbn = 0-06-093780-7 | page = 131}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also, according to author Jean-Claude Baker’s book ''Josephine: The Hungry Heart'', involved for some time with actress [[Josephine Baker]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glreview.com/issues/13.5/13.5-strong.php glreview.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Colette took up work in the [[music hall]]s of Paris, under the wing of [[Mathilde de Morny]], the [[Marquise de Belbeuf]], known as Missy, with whom she became romantically involved. In 1907, the two performed together in a pantomime entitled ''Rêve d'Égypte'' at the [[Moulin Rouge]]. Their onstage kiss nearly caused a riot, which the police were called in to suppress. As a result of this scandal, further performances of ''Rêve d'Égypte'' were banned and Colette and de Morny were no longer able to openly live together, though their relationship continued a total of five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Benstock | first = Shari | year = 1986 | title = Women of the Left Bank: Paris, 1900&amp;ndash;1940 | location = Texas | publisher = University of Texas Press | isbn = 0-292-79040-6 | pages = 48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also was involved in a heterosexual relationship during this time, with the Italian writer [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]]. Another affair during this period was with the automobile-empire scion, Auguste Herriot.

==Second marriage, affair with stepson==
In 1912, Colette married Henri de Jouvenel, the editor of the newspaper ''[[Le Matin (France)|Le Matin]]''. The couple had one daughter, [[Colette de Jouvenel]], known to the family as Bel-Gazou. Colette de Jouvenel later stated that her mother did not want a child and left her in the care of an English nanny, only rarely coming to visit her.

In 1914, during [[World War I]], Colette was approached to write a ballet for the [[Opéra de Paris]] which she outlined under the title &quot;Divertissements pour ma fille&quot;. After Colette herself chose [[Maurice Ravel]] to write the music, he reimagined the work as an opera, to which Colette agreed. Ravel received the libretto to ''[[L'Enfant et les sortilèges]]'' in 1918, and it was first performed on 21 March 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laphil.org/resources/piece_detail.cfm?id=93 LA Phil Presents | Piece Detail - Maurice Ravel: L'enfant et les sortilèges]&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the war, she converted her husband's [[St. Malo]] estate into a hospital for the wounded, and was made a [[Chevalier of the Legion of Honour]] (1920). She divorced Henri de Jouvenel in 1924 after a much talked-about affair with her stepson, [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]].

==Third marriage==
[[Image:Jacques Humbert - Colette.jpg|thumb|left|Colette, painted ca. 1896 by [[Jacques Humbert]]]]
In 1935, Colette married [[Maurice Goudeket]], an uncle of Juliet Goudeket alias [[Jetta Goudal]].&lt;ref&gt;Slide, Anthony. ''Silent Players:A Biographical and Autobiographical Study of 100 Silent Film Actors and Actresses''. University Press of Kentucky, 2002. ISBN 081312249X. page 148.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1935, her ''legal'' name was simply Sidonie Goudeket. Maurice Goudeket published a book about his wife, ''Close to Colette: An Intimate Portrait of a Woman of Genius''. An English translation was published in 1957 by Farrar, Straus &amp; Cudahy, New York.

==Continued writings==
Post-war, her writing career bloomed following the publication of ''[[Chéri (novel)|Chéri]]'' (1920). Chéri tells a story of the end of a six-year affair between an aging retired [[courtesan]], Léa, and a pampered young man, Chéri. Turning stereotypes upside-down, it is Chéri who wears silk pajamas and Léa's pearls, and who is the object of gaze. And in the end Léa demonstrates all the survival skills which Colette associates with femininity. (The story continued in ''[[La Fin de Chéri]]'' (1926), which contrasts Léa's strength and Chéri's fragility and decline). Considered nowadays to be Colette's masterpiece, &quot;Chéri&quot; was orginially met with controversy because of its choice of setting - the [[demimonde]] of the Parisian courtesans - and also because of its portrayal of the hedonistic Chéri. 

After ''Chéri'', Colette entered the world of modern poetry and paintings revolving around [[Jean Cocteau]], who was later her neighbor in [[Palais Royal|Jardins du Palais-Royal]]. Their relationship and life is vividly depicted in their books. By 1927, she was frequently acclaimed as France's greatest woman writer. &quot;It ... has no plot, and yet tells of three lives all that should be known&quot;, wrote [[Janet Flanner]] of ''Sido'' on its publication in 1930. &quot;Once again, and at greater length than usual, she has been hailed for her genius, humanities and perfect prose by those literary journals which years ago ... lifted nothing at all in her direction except the finger of scorn.&quot; 

Having died in Paris in 1954, Colette left 50 published novels in total, many with autobiographical elements. Her themes can be roughly divided into idyllic natural tales or dark struggles in relationships and love. All her novels were marked by clever observation and dialogue with an intimate, explicit style. Her popular novel, ''[[Gigi]]'', was made into a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play and a highly successful [[Hollywood]] [[motion picture]], ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'', starring [[Maurice Chevalier]], [[Louis Jourdan]] and [[Leslie Caron]]. In 2009, an adaptation of both &quot;Chéri&quot; and &quot;La Fin de Chéri&quot; was made into a film. &quot;[[Chéri|film]]&quot; stars [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Rupert Friend]] and [[Kathy Bates]].

==Legacy==
A controversial figure throughout her life, Colette flaunted her [[lesbian]] affairs. 

In the [[German occupation of France during World War II]] she aided her Jewish friends, including hiding her husband in her attic all through the war. 

She was a member of the [[The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium|Belgian Royal Academy]] (1935), president of the [[Edmond Louis Antoine Huot de Goncourt|Académie Goncourt]] (1949) (and the first woman to be admitted into it, in 1945), and a Chevalier (1920) and a Grand Officier (1953) of the [[Légion d'honneur]]. 

When she died in [[Paris]] on 3 August 1954, she was the first woman given a state funeral in France,  although she was refused [[Roman Catholic]] rites because of her divorces.  Colette is interred in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris.

Singer-songwriter [[Rosanne Cash]] paid tribute to the writer in the song, &quot;The Summer I Read Colette&quot;, on Cash's album'' [[10 Song Demo]]''.

Designer [[Marcela Calvet]] named one of her most sought-after luxury handbags, the &quot;Colette&quot;, in honor to the writer.

'''Charles Henry Alston''' (November 28, 1907 – April 27, 1977) was an [[African-American]] [[painting|painter]], [[sculptor]], [[illustrator]], [[muralist]] and [[teacher]] who lived and worked in the [[New York City]] neighborhood of [[Harlem]]. Considered one of the most notable American [[abstract expressionist]] painters and a major creative force during the [[Harlem Renaissance]], Alston was the first African American supervisor for the [[Works Progress Administration]]'s [[Federal Art Project]]. Known for his murals at the [[Harlem Hospital]] and the [[Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Building]]. In 1990 Alston's bust of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] became the first image of an African American displayed at the [[White House]].

==Personal life==
===Early life===

Charles Henry Alston was born on November 28, 1907 in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] to [[Reverend]] Primus Priss Alston and Anna Elizabeth Miller Alston, and was the youngest of five children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Wardlaw |first=Alvia J. |coauthors=|title=Charles Alston |publisher=Pomegranate |year=2007 |month=|isbn=978-0-7649-3766-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollis&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2011 | title=Charles Henry Alston | work=Artists | publisher=Hollis Taggart Galleries | url=http://www.hollistaggart.com/artists/biography/charles_henry_alston/ | accessdate= 9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pierce |first1=Lemoine |last2= |first2= |year=2004 |title=Charles Alston – An Appreciation |journal=The International Review of African American Art |volume= |issue=4 |pages=33–38 |publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only three survived past infancy: Rousmaniere, a daughter, and sons Wendell and Charles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartzman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Schwartzman |first=Myron |coauthors=|title=Romare Bearden: His Life and Art |publisher=[[Abrams Books]] |year=1990 |month=|isbn=978-0810931084}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was born into slavery in 1851 in [[Pittsboro, North Carolina]]; after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he graduated from [[St. Augustine's College (North Carolina)|St. Augustine's College]] and became a prominent minister and founder of St. Michael’s Episcopal Church.  He was described as a &quot;race man&quot;: an African American who dedicated his skills to the furtherance of the black race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt; Reverend Alston met his wife when she was a student at his school. Charles was nicknamed “Spinky” by his father, and kept the nickname as an adult. In 1910, when Charles was three, his father died suddenly of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. Locals described him in admiration as the “[[Booker T. Washington]] of Charlotte”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt; 

In 1913 Anna Alston married Harry Bearden. Through the marriage, the future artist [[Romare Bearden]] became Charles’ cousin. The two Bearden families lived across the street from each other; the friendship between Romare and Charles would last a lifetime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartzman&quot;/&gt; As a child Alston was inspired by his older brother Wendell’s drawings of [[trains]] and [[cars]], which the young artist copied.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview1&quot;&gt;{{cite audio |people=Murray, Al (interviewer) |date=19 October 1968 |title=Oral History Interview with Charles Alston |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-charles-henry-alston-11460 |format=mp3 |medium= |language=English |trans_title= |publisher=Archives of American Art |location= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles also played with clay, creating a sculpture of [[North Carolina]]. As an adult he reflected on his memories of sculpting with clay as a child: “I’d get buckets of it and put it through strainers and make things out of it. I think that’s the first art experience I remember, making things.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt; His mother was a gifted [[embroidery|embroiderer]] and tool up painting at the age of 75. His father was gifted at drawing as well, wooing Alston's mother with small sketches in the medians of letters he wrote her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;

In 1915 the family moved to New York, as many African-American families did during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintz&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Wintz|first=Cary|last=Finkelman|first=Paul|coauthors=|title=Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance |publisher=Routledge|year=2004|month=|isbn=1579584578}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alston’s step-father, Henry Bearden, left before his wife and children to secure a job overseeing [[elevator]] operations and the [[newsstand]] staff at the [[Bretton Hall, Manhattan|Bretton Hotel]] in the [[Upper West Side]]. The family lived in [[Harlem]] and was considered [[middle-class]]. During the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], the people of Harlem suffered economically.  The &quot;stoic strength” seen within the community was later expressed in Charles’ fine art.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt; At Public School 179 in [[Manhattan]], the boy's artistic abilities were recognized and he was asked to draw all of the school posters during his years there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;

===Higher education===

Alston graduated from [[DeWitt Clinton High School]], where he was nominated for academic excellence and was the art editor of the school's magazine, ''The Magpie''. He was a member of the [[Arista - National Honor Society]] and also attended Saturday school at the [[National Academy of Design|National Academy of Art]] in drawing and anatomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt; In high school he was given his first [[oil paint]]s and learned about his aunt [[Bessye J. Bearden|Bessye Bearden’s]] art salons, where starts like [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Langston Hughes]] would hang out. After graduating in 1925, he attended [[Columbia University]], turning down a scholarship to the [[Yale School of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview1&quot;/&gt; Alston entered the pre-architectural program only to lose interest upon seeing the lack of success many African American architects had in the field. After also experimenting with [[pre-med]], he decided that math, physics and chemistry “was not just my bag” and he entered the fine arts program. During his time at Columbia he joined [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], worked on the university's ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'' and drew cartoons for the school’s magazine ''[[Jester of Columbia|Jester]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt; He also hung out in Harlem restaurants and clubs, where his love for jazz and black music would be fostered. In 1929 he graduated and received a fellowship to study at [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers College]], where he would obtain his Master's in 1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;

===Later life===
For the years 1942–1943 Alston was stationed in the army at [[Fort Huachuca]] in [[Arizona]]. Upon returning to New York on April 8, 1944, he married Dr. Myra Adele Logan, an intern at the [[Harlem Hospital]].  They met when he was working on a [[Charles Alston#Murals|mural project]] at the hospital. Their home, including his studio, as on Edgecombe Avenue near [[Highbridge Park]]. The couple lived close to family; at their frequent gatherings Alston enjoyed cooking and Myra played piano. During the 1940s Alston also took occasional art classes studying under [[Alexander Kostellow]]. 

In January 1977 Myra Logan died.  Months later on April 27, 1977, Charles ''Spinky'' Alston died after a long bout with [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt; His memorial service was held at St. Martins Episcopal Church on May 21, 1977 in New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Funeral&quot;&gt;Charles Henry Alston Memorial Service. 21 May 1977. [[Archives of American Art]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

While obtaining his master’s degree, Alston was the boys’ work director at the Utopia Children’s House, started by [[James Lesesne Wells]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintz&quot;/&gt; He also began teaching at the [[Harlem Arts Workshop]], founded by [[Augusta Savage]] in the basement of what is now the [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintz&quot;/&gt; Alston’s teaching style was influenced by the work of [[John Dewey]], [[Arthur Wesley Dow]], and [[Thomas Munro]]. During this period, Alston began to teach the 10-year old [[Jacob Lawrence]], whom he strongly influenced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sentinel&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=First publication of the migration series captures A defining moment in American history. |author= |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/369369766?accountid=11243 |newspaper=Sentinel |year=1993 |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alston was introduced to [[African art]] by the poet [[Alain Locke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintz&quot;/&gt; In the late 1920s Alston joined Bearden and other black artists who refused to exhibit in [[William E. Harmon Foundation]] shows, which featured all-black artists in their traveling exhibits.  Alston and his friends thought the exhibits were curated for a white audience, a form of segregation which the men protested.  They did not want to be set aside but exhibited on the same level as art peers of every skin color.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;

In 1938 the [[Rosenwald Fund]] provided money for Alston to travel to the South, which was his first return there since leaving as a child. His travel with Giles Hubert, an inspector for the [[Farm Security Administration]], gave him access to certain situations and he photographed many aspects of rural life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintz&quot;/&gt; These photographs serves as the basis for a series of genre portraits' depicting southern black life. In 1940 he completed ''Tobacco Farmer'', the portrait of a young black farmer in white [[overalls]] and a blue shirt with a youthful yet serious look upon his face, sitting in front of the landscape and buildings he works on and in. That same year he received a second round of funding from the Rosenwald Fund to travel South, and he spent extended time at [[Atlanta University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt; 

During the 1930s and early 1940s, Alston created illustrations for magazines such as ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt; He also designed album covers for artists such as [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Coleman Hawkins]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt; Alston became staff artist at the Office of War Information and Public Relations in 1940, creating drawings of notable African Americans. These images were used in over 200 [[black newspapers]] across the country by the government to “foster goodwill with the black citizenry,”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintz&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Germany&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=| title=Charles H.

Eventually Alston left commercial work to focus on his own artwork. In 1950 he became the first African-American instructor at the [[Art Students League]], where he remained on faculty until 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintz&quot;/&gt; In 1950 his ''Painting'' was exhibited at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and his artwork was one of few purchased by the museum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintz&quot;/&gt; He landed his first solo exhibition in 1953 at the [[John Heller Gallery]], who represented artists such as [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. He exhibited there five times from 1953–1958. 

In 1956 he became the first African-American instructor at the Museum of Modern Art, where he taught for a year before going to [[Belgium]] on behalf of MOMA and the State Department.  He coordinated the children’s community center at [[Expo 58]]. In 1958 he was awarded a grant from and was elected as a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;

In 1963 Alston co-founded [[Spiral (arts alliance)|Spiral]] with Romare Bearden and Hale Woodruff.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintz&quot;/&gt; Spiral served as a collective of conversation and artistic exploration for a large group of artists who &quot;addressed how black artists should relate to American society in a time of segregation.&quot; Artists and arts supporters gathered for Spiral, such as [[Emma Amos (painter)|Emma Amos]], [[Perry Ferguson]] and [[Merton Simpson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Patton |first=Sharon|coauthors=|title=African-American Art|publisher=Oxford|year=1998|month=|isbn=0192842137}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview1&quot;/&gt; This group served as the 1960s version of [[306]], and Alston was described as an &quot;intellectual activist.&quot; In 1968 he spoke at Columbia about his activism and in the mid-60s Spiral created an exhibition of black and white artworks.  But, the exhibition was never officially sponsored by the group due to inner-group disagreements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;

In 1968 Alston received a presidential appointment from [[Lyndon Johnson]] to the National Council of Culture and the Arts. Mayor [[John Lindsay]] appointed him to the [[New York City Art Commission]] in 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintz&quot;/&gt; He was made full professor at [[City College of New York]] in 1973 where he had taught since 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollis&quot;/&gt; In 1975 he was awarded the first Distinguished Alumni Award from Teachers College.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt; The Art Student's League created a 21-year merit [[scholarship]] in 1977 under Alston's name to to commemorate each year of his tenure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;

===Painting a person and a culture===

Alston shared studio space with [[Henry Bannarn]] at 306 W. 141st St, which served as an open space for artists, photographers, musicians, writers and the like. Other artists held studio space at 306, such as Jacob Lawrence, [[Addison Bate]] and his brother Leon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintz&quot;/&gt; During this time Alston founded the [[Harlem Artists’ Guild]] with Savage and [[Elba Lightfoot]] to work towards equality in [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] art programs in New York. During the early years of 306, Alston focused on mastering [[portrait (painting)|portraiture]]. Early works such as ''Portrait of a Man'' (1929) show Alston's detailed and realistic style depicted through [[pastel]]s and charcoals, inspired by the style of [[Winold Reiss]]. In his ''Girl in a Red Dress'' (1934) and ''The Blue Shirt'' (1935), he used modern and innovative techniques for his portraits of young individuals in Harlem. ''Blue Shirt'' is thought to be a portrait of Jacob Lawrence. During this time he also created ''Man Seated with Travel Bag'' (c. 1938–40), showing the seedy and bleak environment, contrasting with work like the racially charged ''Vaudeville'' (c. 1930) and its [[caricature]] style of a man in [[blackface]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;

Inspired from his trip South, Alston began his &quot;family series&quot; in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt; Intensity and angularity come through in the faces of the youth in his portraits ''Untitled (Portrait of a Girl)'' and ''Untitled (Portrait of a Boy)''. These works also show the influence that [[African sculpture]] had on his portraiture, showing, with ''Portrait of a Boy'' showing more [[cubist]] features. Later family portraits show Alston's exploration of [[religious symbolism]], color, form and space. His family group portraits are often faceless, which Alston states is the way that white America views blacks. Paintings such as ''Family'' (1955) show a woman seated and a man standing with two children – the parents seem almost solemn while the children are described as hopeful and with a use of color made famous by [[Cezanne]]. In ''Family Group'' (c. 1950) Alston's use of grey and [[ochre]] tones brings together the parents and son as if one with geometric patterns connecting them together as if a [[puzzle]]. The simplicity of the look, style and emotion upon the family is reflective and probably inspired by Alston's trip south. His work during this time has been described as being &quot;characterized by his reductive use of form combined with a sun-hued&quot;. During this time he also started to experiment with [[ink and wash painting]] seen in work like ''Portrait of a Woman'' (1955) as well as creating portraits to illustrate the music surrounding him in Harlem. ''Blues Singer #4'' shows a female singer on stage with a white flower on her shoulder and a bold red dress, reminisecent of [[Ella Fitzgerald]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt; ''Girl in a Red Dress'' is thought to may be [[Bessie Smith]], for whom he drew many times when she was recording and performing. Jazz was an important influence in Alston's work and socila life, representing itself in other works like ''Jazz'' (1950) and ''Harlem at Night''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;

The 1960s civil rights movement influenced his work heavily with artworks influenced by inequality and race relations in the United States. One of his few religious artworks was created in 1960, ''Christ Head'', with an angular &quot;[[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]]esque&quot; portrait of [[Jesus Christ]]. Seven years later he creates ''You never really meant it, did you, Mr. Charlie?'' which, in a similar style as ''Christ Head'' shows a black man standing against a red sky &quot;looking as frustrated as any individual can look,&quot; according to Alston.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;

====Modernism====

Experimenting with the use of [[negative space]] and organic forms in the late 1940s, by the mid-1950s Alston began creating notably [[modernist]] style paintings. ''Woman with Flowers'' (1949) has been described as a tribute to [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] and African art makes another strong appearance in ''Ceremonial'' (1950). Untitled works during the era show his use of color overlay using muted colors to create simple layered abstracts of still live. ''Symbol'' (1953) relates to [[Picasso|Picasso's]] ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'', which was a favorite work of Alston's.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt; His final work of the 1950s, ''Walking'' serves as a precursor to the 1960s: [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights movement]]. The painting, which was inspired by the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]], has come to represent &quot;the surge of energy among African Americans to organize in their struggle for full equality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burton&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Sharon J. Burton | year=2010 | title=Celebrating African American History Through Art: The Reginald F. Lewis Museum of African American History &amp; Culture | work=Blog | publisher=Authentic Art Visions Blog | url=http://authenticartonline.com/art/tag/charles-alston | accessdate= 9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the artwork, Alston is quoted &quot;The idea of a march was growing...It was in the air...and this painting just came. I called it ''Walking'' on purpose. It wasn't the militancy that you saw later. It was a very definite walk-not going back, no hesitation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BeardernHistory&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bearden |first=Romare|last=Henderson|first=Henry|coauthors=|title=A History of African-American Artists: From 1792 to the Present  |publisher=Pantheon |year=1993 |month=|isbn=978-0394570167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Black and white====

The civil rights movement of the 1960s was a major influence on Alston. Considered to be one of his most powerful and impressive periods in the late 1950s he began working in black and white up until the mid-1960s. Some of the works are simple abstracts of black ink on white paper, similar to a [[Rorschach test]]. ''Untitled'' (c. 1960s) shows a [[boxing]] match in great simplicity with an attempt to express the drama of the fight through few brushstrokes. Alston worked with oil-on-[[Masonite]] during this period as well, utilizing [[impasto]], cream and ochre to create a moody [[cave]]-like artwork. ''Black and White #1'' (1959) is one of Alston's more &quot;monumental&quot; works. Gray, white and black come together to fight for space on a abstract canvas, in a softer form than the more harsh [[Franz Kline]]. Alston continues to explore the relationship between [[monochromatic]] hues throughout the series which Wardlaw describes as &quot;some of the most profoundly beautiful works of twentieth-century American art.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;

===Murals===

In the beginning Charles Alston's mural work was inspired by the work of [[Aaron Douglas]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Jose Clemente Orozco]], the latter who he met when they did mural work in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt; In 1943 Alston was elected to the [[board of directors]] of the [[National Society of Mural Painters]]. He created murals for the Harlem Hospital, Golden State Mutual, [[American Museum of Natural History]], Public School 154, the Bronx Family and Criminal Court and the [[Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn, New York)|Abraham Lincoln High School]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;

====Harlem Hospital Murals====
[[File:Modern Medicine Alston.jpg|thumb|left|''Modern Medicine'' (1936) at the [[Harlem Hospital]]]]
Originally hired as an easel painter, in 1935 Alston became the first African American supervisor to work for the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]'s [[Federal Art Project]] in New York, which would also serve as his first mural work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintz&quot;/&gt; At this time he was awarded WPA Project Number 1262 – an opportunity to oversee a group of artists creating [[mural]]s and to supervise their painting for the Harlem Hospital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt; The first government commission ever awarded to African American artists including [[Beauford Delaney]], [[Seabrook Powell]] and [[Vertis Hayes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt; He also had the chance to create and paint his own contribution to the collection: ''Magic in Medicine'' and ''Modern Medicine''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintz&quot;/&gt; These paintings were part of a diptych completed in 1936 depicting the history of [[medicine]] in the African American community and [[Beauford Delaney]] served as assistant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton&quot;/&gt; When creating the murals Alston was inspired by the work of [[Aaron Douglas]], who a year earlier had created the [[public art]] piece ''Aspects of Negro Life'' for the [[New York Public Library]], and researched traditional [[African culture]], including [[traditional African medicine]]. ''Magic in Medicine'', which depicts African culture and [[holistic]] healing, is considered one of &quot;America's first public scenes of Africa&quot;. All of the murals sketches submitted were accepted by the FAP, however, four were denied creation by the hospital superintendent Lawrence T. Dermody and commissioner of hospitals S.S. Goldwater due to the excessive amount of African-American representation in the works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintz&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ColumbiaMural&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2006 | title=The Controversy | work=Harlem Hospital WPA Murals | publisher=Columbia University | url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/iraas/wpa/controversy/index.html | accessdate= 9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artists fought the response through letter writing and four years later succeeded in gaining the right to complete the murals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt; The sketches for ''Magic in Medicine'' and ''Modern Medicine'' were exhibited in the [[Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art's]] &quot;New Horizons in American Art&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;

=====Condition=====

Alston's murals were hung in the Women's Pavilion of the hospital over uncapped [[radiator]]s which caused the paintings to deteriorate from the steam. Plans failed to recap the radiators. In 1959 Alston estimated, in a letter to the [[New York State Department of Public Works|Department of Public Works]], that the conservation would cost $1,500 but the funds were never acquired. In 1968, after Martin Luther King Jr.'s death, Alston was asked to create another mural for the hospital to be placed in a pavilion named after the assassinated [[civil rights]] leader titled ''Man Emerging from the Darkness of Poverty and Ignorance into the Light of a Better World&quot;.'' After Alston's death in 1977 a committee was formed, unable to raise funds for conservation on the original murals. In 1991 the [[Municipal Art Society]]'s Adopt-a-Mural program was launched and the Harlem Hospital murals were chosen. A grant from Alston's sister Rousmaniere Wilson and step-sister Aida Bearden Winters assisted in completing a restoration of the works in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt; In 2005 Harlem Hospital announced a $2 million project to [[art conservation|conserve]] Alston's murals and three other pieces in the original commissioned project as part of a $225 dollar hospital expansion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt;

====Golden State Mutual Murals====

In the late 1940s Alston became involved in a mural project commissioned by [[Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company]] which asked the artists to create work involving African American contributions to the settling of [[California]]. Alston worked with [[Hale Woodruff]] on the murals in a large studio space in New York where they utilized ladders to reach the upper parts of the canvas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton&quot;/&gt; The artworks, which are considered &quot;priceless contributions to American narrative art,&quot; consists of two panels: ''Exploration and Colonization'' by Alston and ''Settlement and Development'' by Woodruff. Alston's piece covers the [[post-colonial]] period of 1527 to 1850. Images of [[James Beckworth]], [[Biddy Mason]], and [[William Leidesdorff]] are portrayed in the well detailed historical mural. While Both artists kept in contact with African Americans on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] during its creation, influencing the content and depictions. The murals, which were unveiled in 1949, have been on display in the lobby of the Golden State Mutual Headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton&quot;/&gt; Due to [[economic downturn]] Golden State was forced to sell their entire art collection to ward off its mounting debts and as spring 2011 the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] had offered $750,000 to purchase the artworks which led to a controversy regarding the importance of the artworks which have been estimated to be worth at least $5 million. It was requested that the murals be covered by city landmark protections by the [[Los Angeles Conservancy]]. The state of [[California]] had declined philanthropic proposals to keep the murals in their original location and the Smithsonian withdrew their offer. The murals are currently awaiting their fate in California courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kahn&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Smithsonian Plan to Remove Murals From Los Angeles Lobby Is Criticized |author=Eve M.

===Sculpture===

Alston also created sculptures. ''Head of a Woman'' (1957) shows his move towards a &quot;reductive and modern approach to sculpture....where facial features were suggested rather than fully formulated in three dimensions,&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt; In 1970 Alston was commissioned by the Community Church of New York to create a bust of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] for $5,000, with limited copies produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minutes1&quot;&gt;Special Committee on the Martin Luther King Bust.

===Reception===

Art critic [[Emily Genauer]] stated that Altson &quot;refused to be pigeonholed,&quot; regarding his varied exploration in his artwork.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlaw&quot;/&gt; Patron Lemoine Pierce stated on Alston's work: &quot;Never thought of as an innovative artist, Alston generally ignored popular art trends and violated many mainstream art conventions; he produced abstract and figurative paintings often simultaneously, refusing to be stylistically consistent, and during his 40-year career he worked prolifically and unapologetically in both commercial and fine art.&quot; Romare Bearden described Alston as &quot;...one of the most versatile artists whose enormous skill led him to a diversity of styles...&quot; Bearden also describes the professionalism and impact that Alston had on Harlem and the African American community: &quot;'was a consummate artist and a voice in the development of African American art who never doubted the excellence of all people's sensitivity and creative ability. During his long professional career, Alston significantly enriched the cultural life of Harlem. In a profound sense, he was a man who built bridges between Black artists in varying fields, and between other Americans.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierce&quot;/&gt; Writer [[June Jordan]] described Alston as &quot;an American artist of first magnitude, and he is a Black American artist of undisturbed integrity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jordan1&quot;&gt;Jordan, June. Publication proposal by June Jordan. 25 March 1970. [[Archives of American Art]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chromatin''' is the combination of DNA and other proteins that make up the contents of the nucleus. The primary protein component of chromatin is [[histone]]s which act to compactly package the DNA. Chromatin is only found in [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[cell (biology)|cells]]. [[Prokaryotic]] cells have a very different organization of their DNA which is not normally referred to as chromatin. The primary functions of chromatin are to package DNA into a smaller volume to fit in the cell, to strengthen the DNA to allow [[mitosis]] and [[meiosis]] and prevent DNA damage, and to control [[gene expression]] and DNA replication.

The structure of chromatin depends on a combination of several factors; the overall structure depends on the stage of the [[cell cycle]]. During [[interphase]] the chromatin is structurally loose to allow access of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]] polymerases to transcribe and replicate the DNA. The local structure of chromatin during interphase depends on the genes present on the DNA, DNA coding actively transcribed genes are more loosely packaged found associated with RNA polymerases (referred to as [[euchromatin]]) while DNA coding inactive genes are found associated with structural proteins and are more tightly packaged ([[heterochromatin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chromatin.net/|title=Chromatin Network Home Page.|accessdate=2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epigenetic]] chemical modification of the structural proteins in chromatin also alter the local chromatin structure, in particular chemical modifications of histone proteins by [[methylation]] and [[acetylation]]. As the cell prepares to divide, i.e. enters  [[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]], the chromatin packages more tightly to facilitate segregation of the [[chromosome]]s during [[anaphase]]. During this stage of the cell cycle this makes the individual chromosomes in many cells visible by [[optical microscope]].

In general terms, there are three levels of chromatin organization:
# DNA wraps around histone proteins forming [[nucleosome]]s; the &quot;beads on a string&quot; structure ([[euchromatin]]).
# Multiple histones wrap into a 30 [[nanometer|nm]] fibre consisting of nucleosome arrays in their most compact form ([[heterochromatin]]).
# Higher-level DNA packaging of the 30 nm fibre into the metaphase chromosome (during mitosis and meiosis).
There are, however, many of cells which do not follow this organisation. For example [[spermatozoa]] and [[Bird|avian]] [[red blood cells]] have more tightly packed chromatin than most eukaryotic cells and [[trypanosomatid]] [[protazoa]] do not condense their chromatin into visible chromosomes for mitosis.

==During interphase==
The structure of chromatin during [[interphase]] is optimised to allow easy access of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[DNA repair]] factors to the DNA while compacting the DNA into the [[nucleus (cell)|nucleus]]. The structure varies depending on the access required to the DNA. [[Genes]] that require regular access by [[RNA polymerase]] require the looser structure provided by euchromatin.

==Change in structure==
Chromatin undergoes various forms of change in its structure. Histone proteins, the foundation blocks of chromatin, are modified by various post-translational modification to alter DNA packing. Acetylation results in the loosening of chromatin and lends itself to replication and transcription. When certain residues are methylated they hold DNA together strongly and restrict access to various enzymes. A recent study showed that there is a [[bivalent chromatin|bivalent]] structure present in the chromatin: methylated lysine residues at location 4 and 27 on histone 3. It is thought that this may be involved in development; there is more methylation of lysine 27 in embryonic cells than in differentiated cells, whereas lysine 4 methylation positively regulates transcription by recruiting nucleosome remodeling enzymes and histone acetylases.&lt;ref&gt;

===DNA structure===
[[File:A-DNA, B-DNA and Z-DNA.png|thumb|right|300px|The structures of A-, B- and Z-DNA.]]
{{main|Mechanical properties of DNA|Z-DNA}}
The vast majority of DNA within the cell is the normal DNA structure. However in nature DNA can form three structures, A-, B- and [[Z-DNA]]. A and B chromosomes are very similar, forming right-handed helices, while Z-DNA is a more unusual left-handed helix with a zig-zag phosphate backbone. Z-DNA is thought to play a specific role in chromatin structure and transcription because of the properties of the junction between B- and Z-DNA.

At the junction of B- and Z-DNA one pair of bases is flipped out from normal bonding. These play a dual role of a site of recognition by many proteins and as a sink for torsional stress from [[RNA polymerase]] or nucleosome binding.
&lt;!---
 Move to [[mechanical properties of DNA]] or [[Z-DNA]]? &quot;===DNA structure===
[[File:B&amp;Z&amp;A DNA formula.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'''Fig. 2:''' Alternative structural forms of DNA influencing chromatin structure]]

===Chromatin and Watson/Crick base pairing===
Crick and Watson's famous structure of [[DNA]] (called B-DNA) is only one of three possible structural forms (Fig. 2).

For the C-N bond between a base and its sugar there are two different conformations. The anti-conformation occurs in all A- and B-DNAs as well as in Z-DNA where a Cytosine is present.
In case of a Guanine Z-DNA takes the syn-conformation. The periodic change between a purine and pyrimidine along the strand of a Z-DNA accomplishes the alternating syn-anti-conformation characteristic of the zigzag structure of the Z-DNA helix. The yellow circles designated A, B, Z indicate the axes of the three possible types of DNA (Fig. 2).

[[File:B&amp;Z junction DNA.jpg|thumb|200px|'''Fig. 3:''' Structure of DNA with two B-Z DNA junctions: It encompasses 1. breakage of a hydrogen-bond, where a Guanine rotates around its glycosyl-bond and the sugar thereby transforms into its syn-conformation. 2. Rotation of the corresponding second base (Cytosine) involving rotation of the sugar around the sugar-phosphate-bond. 3. At the B-Z junction hydrogen-bonds remain broken and bases are extruded.]]

===Junction between B- and Z-DNA===
Chromatin regions near the transcription start site frequently contain DNA sequence motifs favourable for forming Z-DNA. Likewise, formation of Z-DNA near the promoter region stimulates transcription. Z-DNA is stabilized by binding specific proteins. Formation of Z-DNA from B-DNA is a dynamic process wherein B-DNA is the relaxed state. When a Z-DNA segment is formed two B-Z junctions form (Fig.3). The crystal structure of such junctions is known. At each junction the hydrogen bonds between a Watson/Crick base-pair is broken and the bases are extruded. Extrusion of a base from the helix is a well-known reaction performed by enzymes (i.e., DNA glycosylase) that edit or repair DNA during Base Excision Repair (BER). Crystal structures of extruded bases co-crystallized with Hha1 methyltransferase, human DNA repair protein AGT(O(6)-alkylguanine-DNAalkyltransferase), or bacteriophage T4 endonuclease V are similar to the extruded bases at B-Z junctions. Z-DNA may also provide a sink to absorb torsional strain following an RNA polymerase or a transient nucleosome. Also Z-DNA may represent a signal for the recruitment of RNA-editing enzymes. It is possible that chromatin encompassing Z-DNA segments also affect replication.&quot; ---&gt;

===The nucleosome and &quot;beads-on-a-string&quot;===
:''Main articles: [[Nucleosome]], [[Chromatosome]] and [[Histone]]''
[[File:Nucleosome 1KX5 2.png|thumb|left|150px|A cartoon representation of the nucleosome structure. From {{PDB|1KX5}}.]]
The basic repeat element of chromatin is the nucleosome, interconnected by sections of [[linker DNA]], a far shorter arrangement than pure DNA in solution.

In addition to the core histones, there is the linker histone, H1, which contacts the exit/entry of the DNA strand on the nucleosome. The nucleosome core particle, together with histone H1, is known as a chromatosome.  Nucleosomes, with about 20 to 60 base pairs of linker DNA, can form, under non-physiological conditions, an approximately 10&amp;nbsp;nm &quot;beads-on-a-string&quot; fibre. (Fig. 1-2). .

The nucleosomes bind DNA non-specifically, as required by their function in general DNA packaging.  There are, however, large DNA sequence preferences that govern nucleosome positioning.  This is due primarily to the varying physical properties of different DNA sequences: For instance, [[adenosine]] and [[thymine]] are more favorably compressed into the inner minor grooves. This means nucleosomes can bind preferentially at one position approximately every 10 base pairs (the helical repeat of DNA)- where the DNA is rotated to maximise the number of A and T bases that will lie in the inner minor groove. (See [[mechanical properties of DNA]].)

===30 nm chromatin fibre===
[[File:30nm Chromatin Structures.png|thumb|right|200px|Two proposed structures of the 30nm chromatin filament. &lt;br /&gt;Left: 1 start helix &quot;solenoid&quot; structure. &lt;br /&gt;Right: 2 start loose helix structure. &lt;br /&gt;Note: the histones are omitted in this diagram - only the DNA is shown.]]
With addition of H1, the &quot;beads-on-a-string&quot; structure in turn coils into a 30&amp;nbsp;nm diameter helical structure known as the 30&amp;nbsp;nm fibre or filament. The precise structure of the chromatin fibre in the cell is not known in detail, and there is still some debate over this. 

This level of chromatin structure is thought to be the form of [[euchromatin]], which contains actively transcribed genes. EM studies have demonstrated that the 30&amp;nbsp;nm fibre is highly dynamic such that it unfolds into a 10&amp;nbsp;nm fiber (&quot;beads-on-a-string&quot;) structure when transversed by an RNA polymerase engaged in transcription.

[[File:ChromatinFibers.png|thumb|left|250px|Four proposed structures of the 30&amp;nbsp;nm chromatin filament for DNA repeat length per nucleosomes ranging from 177 to 207 bp.
&lt;br /&gt;
Linker DNA in yellow and nucleosomal DNA in pink.]]
The existing models commonly accept that the nucleosomes lie perpendicular to the axis of the fibre, with linker histones arranged internally.  
A stable 30&amp;nbsp;nm fibre relies on the regular positioning of nucleosomes along DNA. Linker DNA is relatively resistant to bending and rotation. This makes the length of linker DNA critical to the stability of the fibre, requiring nucleosomes to be separated by lengths that permit rotation and folding into the required orientation without excessive stress to the DNA.
In this view, different length of the linker DNA should produce different folding topologies of the chromatin fiber. Recent theoretical work, based on electron-microscopy images&lt;ref&gt;

===Spatial organization of chromatin in the cell nucleus===
&lt;!--- Too speculative for an article: &quot;[[File:Nucleus &amp; Chromatin Territorial Structure.jpg|thumb|200px|left|'''Fig. 4:''' Hypothetical Model of the Territorial Organization of Chromatin in the Cell Nucleus. The diagram (Fig. 4) represents a model of a cell (gray oval) with a nucleus (dark gray oval). Two chromosomes are shown as chromatin fibers (yellow and red lines). Proteins are represented as small ovals. Note the association of the chromatin components with the nuclear membrane. Chromosomes are territorially interlinked by chromatin protein complexes (scaffold proteins see above).]]&quot; ---&gt;

The layout of the [[genome]] within the nucleus is not random - specific regions of the genome have a tendency to be found in certain spaces. Specific regions of the chromatin are enriched at the [[nuclear membrane]], while other regions are bound together by protein complexes. The layout of this is not, however, well characterised apart from the compaction of one of the two X chromosomes in [[mammal]]ian [[female]]s into the [[Barr body]]. This serves the role of permanently deactivating these genes, which prevents females getting a '[[dosage compensation|double dose']] relative to [[male]]s.  The extent to which the inactive X is actually compacted is a matter of some controversy.

==Chromatin and bursts of transcription==
Fluctuations between open and closed chromatin may contribute discontinuity of transcription, or [[transcriptional bursting]].  Other factors are probably involved, such as the association and dissociation of transcription factor complexes with chromatin.  The phenomenon, as opposed to simple probabilistic models of transcription, can account for the high variability in gene expression occurring between cells in isogenic populations.

==Metaphase chromatin==
[[File:NHGRI human male karyotype.png|thumbnail|220px|Karyogram of human male using [[Giemsa]] staining, showing the classic [[metaphase]] chromatin structure.]]
The [[metaphase]] structure of chromatin differs vastly to that of [[interphase]]. It is optimised for physical strength and manageability, forming the classic chromosome structure seen in [[karyotype]]s. The structure of the condensed chromosome is thought to be loops of 30&amp;nbsp;nm fibre to a central scaffold of proteins. It is, however, not well characterised.

The physical strength of chromatin is vital for this stage of division to prevent shear damage to the DNA as the daughter chromosomes are separated. To maximise strength the composition of the chromatin changes as it approaches the centromere, primarily through alternative histone H1 anologues.

It should also be noted that, during mitosis, while most of the chromatin is tightly compacted, there are small regions that are not as tightly compacted. These regions often correspond to promoter regions of genes that were active in that cell type prior to entry into [[cromitosis]]. The lack of compaction of these regions is called [[bookmarking]], which is an [[epigenetic]] mechanism believed to be important for transmitting to daughter cells the &quot;memory&quot; of which genes were active prior to entry into mitosis. This [[bookmarking]] mechanism is needed to help transmit this memory because transcription ceases during [[mitosis]].

==Chromatin: alternative definitions==
# '''Simple and concise definition:''' Chromatin is DNA plus the proteins (and RNA) that package DNA within the cell nucleus.
# '''A biochemists’ operational definition:''' Chromatin is the DNA/protein/RNA complex extracted from eukaryotic lysed interphase nuclei. Just which of the multitudinous substances present in a nucleus will constitute a part of the extracted material will depend in part on the technique each researcher uses. Furthermore, the composition and properties of chromatin vary from one cell type to the another, during development of a specific cell type, and at different stages in the cell cycle.
# '''The ''DNA + histone = chromatin'' definition:''' The DNA double helix in the cell nucleus is packaged by special proteins termed histones. The formed protein/DNA complex is called chromatin. The structural entity of chromatin is the nucleosome.

==Alternative chromatin organisations==
During metazoan [[spermiogenesis]], the [[spermatid]]'s chromatin is remodelled into a more spaced-packaged, widened, almost crystal-like structure. This process is associated with the cessation of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and involves [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] protein exchange. The histones are mostly displaced, and replaced by [[protamine]]s (small, [[arginine]]-rich proteins).

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the field of  [[numerical analysis]], the '''condition number''' of a function with respect to an argument measures the asymptotically worst case of how much the function can change in proportion to small changes in the argument. The &quot;function&quot; is the solution of a problem and the &quot;arguments&quot; are the data in the problem.  A problem with a low condition number is said to be '''well-conditioned''', while a problem with a high condition number is said to be '''ill-conditioned'''.  The condition number is a property of the problem.  Paired with the problem are any number of algorithms that can be used to solve the problem, that is, to calculate the solution.  Some algorithms have a property called [[Numerical_stability |'''backward stability''']].  In general, a backward stable algorithm can be expected to accurately solve well-conditioned problems.  Numerical analysis textbooks give formulas for the condition numbers of problems and identify the backward stable algorithms. As a general rule of thumb, if the condition number  &lt;math&gt;\kappa(A) = 10^k&lt;/math&gt;, then you lose &lt;math&gt; k
&lt;/math&gt; digits of accuracy on top of what would be lost to the numerical method due to loss of precision from arithmetic methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Numerical Mathematics and Computing, by Cheney and Kincaid&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZUfVZELlrMEC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;lpg=PA321&amp;dq=Condition+Number+Rule+of+Thumb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kMuMoeATcB&amp;sig=22t9ml1TcXKbve-nAkkTJ-qAf1g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=A5abTIvGOsaMnQe_17TpDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Condition%20Number%20Rule%20of%20Thumb&amp;f=false Numerical Mathematics and Computing, by Cheney and Kincaid].&lt;/ref&gt;
==Matrices==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Invertible matrix]] --&gt;

For example, the condition number associated with the [[linear equation]]
''Ax''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b'' gives a bound on how inaccurate the solution ''x'' will be after approximate solution. Note that this is before the effects of [[round-off error]] are taken into account; conditioning is a property of the matrix, not the [[algorithm]] or [[floating point]] accuracy of the computer used to solve the corresponding system. In particular, one should think of the condition number as being (very roughly) the rate at which the solution, ''x'', will change with respect to a change in ''b''.  Thus, if the condition number is large, even a small error in ''b'' may cause a large error in ''x''. On the other hand, if the condition number is small then the error in ''x'' will not be much bigger than the error in ''b''.

The condition number is defined more precisely to be the maximum ratio of the [[relative error]] in ''x'' divided by the relative error in ''b''.

Let ''e'' be the error in ''b''. Assuming that ''A'' is a square matrix, the error in the solution ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''b'' is ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''e''. The ratio of the relative error in the solution to the relative error in ''b'' is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Vert A^{-1} e\Vert / \Vert A^{-1} b\Vert}{\Vert e\Vert / \Vert b\Vert}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is easily transformed to

: &lt;math&gt;(\Vert A^{-1} e\Vert / \Vert e\Vert) \cdot (\Vert b\Vert / \Vert A^{-1} b\Vert).&lt;/math&gt;

The maximum value (for nonzero ''b'' and ''e'') is easily seen to be the product of the two [[operator norm]]s:

: &lt;math&gt;\kappa (A) = \Vert A\Vert \cdot \Vert A^{-1}\Vert.&lt;/math&gt;

The same definition is used for any  consistent [[matrix norm|norm]]. This number arises so often in numerical [[linear algebra]] that it is given a name, the '''condition number of a matrix'''.

Of course, this definition depends on the choice of norm.

* If &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lp space|ℓ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[matrix norm|norm]] then
:&lt;math&gt;\kappa(A) = \frac{\sigma_\max(A)}{\sigma_\min(A)}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\max(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\min(A)&lt;/math&gt; are maximal and minimal [[singular value]]s of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Hence
:* If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[normal matrix|normal]] then
::&lt;math&gt;\kappa(A) = \left|\frac{\lambda_\max(A)}{\lambda_\min(A)}\right|&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\max(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\min(A)&lt;/math&gt; are maximal and minimal (by moduli) [[eigenvalue]]s of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; respectively
:* If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[unitary matrix|unitary]] then
::&lt;math&gt;\kappa(A) = 1. \,&lt;/math&gt;

* If  &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; l_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; [[matrix norm|norm]] and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[triangular matrix|lower triangular]] non-singular (i.e., &lt;math&gt; a_{ii} \ne 0 \; \forall i&lt;/math&gt;) then
:&lt;math&gt;\kappa(A) \geq \frac{\max_i(|a_{ii}|)}{\min_i(|a_{ii}|)}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Other contexts==

Condition numbers can be defined for any function ''&amp;fnof;'' mapping its data from some [[function domain|domain]] (e.g. an ''m''-tuple of real numbers ''x'') into some [[codomain]] [e.g. an ''n''-tuple of real numbers ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'')], where both the domain and codomain are [[Banach space]]s.  They express how sensitive that function is to small changes (or small errors) in its arguments.  This is crucial in assessing the sensitivity and potential accuracy difficulties of numerous computational problems, for example [[polynomial]] [[root finding]] or computing [[eigenvalue]]s.  

The condition number of ''&amp;fnof;'' at a point ''x'' (specifically, its '''relative condition number'''&lt;ref name=TrefethenBau/&gt;) is then defined to be the maximum ratio of the fractional change in ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'') to any fractional change in ''x'', in the limit where the change &amp;delta;''x'' in ''x'' becomes infinitesimally small:&lt;ref name=TrefethenBau&gt;L. N. Trefethen and D. Bau, ''Numerical Linear Algebra'' (SIAM, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\varepsilon \to 0^+} \sup_{\Vert \delta x \Vert \leq \varepsilon} 
       \left[  \frac{\left\Vert f(x + \delta x) - f(x)\right\Vert}{\Vert f(x) \Vert}  
               \left/  \frac{\Vert \delta x \Vert }{\Vert x \Vert}  \right .
       \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Vert \cdots \Vert&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] on the domain/codomain of ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'').

If ''&amp;fnof;'' is differentiable, this is equivalent to:&lt;ref name=TrefethenBau/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Vert J \Vert}{ \Vert f(x) \Vert / \Vert x \Vert}, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''J'' denotes the [[Jacobian matrix]] of [[partial derivative]]s of ''&amp;fnof;'' and &lt;math&gt;\Vert J \Vert&lt;/math&gt; is the [[induced norm]] on the matrix.

'''Cheddar cheese''' is a relatively hard, yellow to off-white, and sometimes sharp-tasting [[cheese]] originally made in the English village of [[Cheddar]] in [[Somerset]].&lt;ref name=curdswhey&gt;{{Cite news| title= Separating the curds from the whey | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5241544.stm | work= [[BBC Radio 4]] Open Country| date= 21 August 2006 | last= Smale | first=Will | accessdate= 2007-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheddar cheese is produced in many countries across the world, but only cheese produced in the English counties of [[Somerset]], [[Devon]], [[Dorset]], and [[Cornwall]] may be given the EU [[Protected Geographical Status|Protected Designation of Origin]] name &quot;West Country farmhouse Cheddar&quot;.&lt;ref name=PDO&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/industry/regional/foodname/products/registered/westcoun.htm | publisher= [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|defra]] | title= EU Protected Food Names Scheme - UK registered names | accessdate= 22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The cheese originates from the village of [[Cheddar]] in [[Somerset]], South West England. [[Cheddar Gorge]] on the edge of the village contains a number of [[cave]]s, which provided the ideal humidity and constant temperature for maturing the cheese.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; Cheddar cheese traditionally had to be made within {{convert|30|mi|km}} of [[Wells Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=curdswhey/&gt;

Cheddar has been produced since at least the 12th century. A [[pipe rolls|pipe roll]] of [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] from 1170 records the purchase of {{convert|10420|lb|abbr=on}} at a [[British farthing coin|farthing]] per pound (UK£2.30 per ton).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=History | work=Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company | url=http://www.cheddargorgecheeseco.co.uk/acatalog/about-cheddar-gorge.html | accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (1600&amp;ndash;1649) also bought cheese from the village.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;
[[Ancient Rome|Romans]] may have brought the recipe to Britain from the [[Cantal]] region of France.&lt;ref&gt;Barthélemy, Roland &amp; Sperat-Czar, Arnaud (2003), ''Guide du fromage''. Editions Hachette Pratique, Publishers, pp. 89, ISBN 2-01-236867-0&lt;/ref&gt; 

Central to the modernisation and standardisation of Cheddar cheese was the nineteenth century [[Somerset]] dairyman [[Joseph Harding]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title=History of Cheddar Cheese | work=Icons of England | url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/cheddar-cheese/biography/history-of-cheddar-finished | accessdate=2007-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For his technical developments, promotion of dairy hygiene and unremunerated propagation of modern cheese-making techniques he has been described as the father of Cheddar cheese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Heeley |first=Anne |coauthors= Mary Vidal |title=Joseph Harding, Cheddar Cheese-Maker |year=1996 |publisher=Friends of the Abbey Barn |location=Glastonbury }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Harding introduced new equipment into the process of cheese making, including his &quot;revolving breaker&quot; for curd cutting, saving much manual effort.&lt;ref&gt;Transactions of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland,  By [[Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland]], 1866-7 volume 1, Aberdeen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History of British Agriculture, 1846-1914: 1846 - 1914‎ - Page 145
by Christabel Susan Lowry Orwin, Edith Holt Whetham - Agriculture - 1964&lt;/ref&gt;
The &quot;Joseph Harding method&quot; was the first modern system for Cheddar production based upon scientific principles. Harding stated that Cheddar cheese is &quot;not made in the field, nor in the byre, nor even in the cow, it is made in the dairy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gourmetbritain.com/encyclo_entry.php?item=2391 |title=Encyclopedia - Harding, Joseph |publisher=Gourmet Britain |date= |accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He and his wife were behind the introduction of the cheese into Scotland and North America.  Joseph Harding's son, Henry Harding, was responsible for introducing Cheddar cheese production to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;From Artisans to “Factories”: The Interpenetration of Craft and Industry in English Cheese-Making 1650–1950, by Richard Blundel and Angela Tregear, Enterprise and Society, October 17th 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]] most milk in Britain was used for the making of one single kind of cheese nicknamed &quot;Government Cheddar&quot; as part of war economies and rationing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.cooksinfo.com/government-cheddar-cheese |title=Government Cheddar Cheese |publisher= Practically Edible |accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This nearly resulted in wiping out all other cheese production in the country. Before the [[First World War]] there were more than 3,500 cheese producers in Britain, while fewer than 100 remained after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.thestar.com/News/article/264784 | title= Cool Britannia rules the whey  |last=Potter |first=Mich | publisher= [[Toronto Star]]  | date= 9 October 2007 | accessdate= 2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
[[Image:Cheese curds 2.jpg|thumb|left|A bowl of [[cheese curds]]]]
{{Main|Manufacture of Cheddar cheese}}

''Cheddaring'' refers to an additional step in the production of Cheddar-style cheese where, after heating, the [[curd]] is kneaded with salt, cut into cubes to drain the [[whey]] then stacked and turned.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{Cite news| url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/wine/main.jhtml?xml=/wine/2005/06/18/edsavvy18.xml | publisher= Daily Telegraph | title= Savvy shopper: Cheddar | date= 18 June 2005 | accessdate= 2008-03-10 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong, extra-mature Cheddar, sometimes called vintage, needs to be matured for up to 15 months. The cheese is kept at a constant temperature often requiring special facilities. As with production of other hard cheese varieties in other regions worldwide, [[cave]]s provide an ideal environment for maturing cheese; still, today, some Cheddar cheese is matured in the caves at [[Wookey Hole Caves|Wookey Hole]] and [[Cheddar Gorge]].
[[File:Cheddar cave cheese.jpg|thumb|right|Cheddar cheese maturing in the caves at [[Cheddar Gorge]]]]

The curds and whey are separated using [[rennet]], an enzyme complex normally produced from the stomachs of new-born calves (in [[vegetarian]] or [[kosher]] cheeses, bacterial-, yeast- or mould-derived [[chymosin]] is used).&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.vegsoc.org/info/cheese.html | publisher= [[Vegetarian Society]] | title= Information Sheet - Cheese &amp; Rennet | accessdate= 2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==
[[Image:MidSomerset Show 170803.jpg|left|thumb|Cheddar cheeses on display at the Mid Somerset Show]]
The ideal quality of the original Somerset Cheddar was described by Joseph Harding in 1864 as &quot;close and firm in texture, yet mellow in character or quality; it is rich with a tendency to melt in the mouth, the flavour full and fine, approaching to that of a hazelnut&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Transactions of the New-York State Agricultural Society for the Year 1864, page 232, volume 14 1865, Albany&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheddar, made in the classical way, tends to have a sharp, pungent flavour, often slightly earthy. Its texture is firm, with farmhouse traditional Cheddar being slightly crumbly; it should also, if mature, contain large crystals of [[calcium lactate]] – often precipitated when matured for times longer than 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cpdmp.cornell.edu/CPDMP/Pages/Workshops/Syracuse09/PDFs/Metzger.pdf | title=The efficiency of sodium gluconate as a calcium lactate crystal inhibitor in Cheddar cheese | publisher=Midwest Dairy Foods Research Center | accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Real Cheddar is never &quot;soapy&quot;, in texture or [[mouthfeel]], and tends to be more brittle than other types of [[cheese]]s.

Cheddar is usually a deep to pale yellow (off-white) colour, but food colourings are sometimes used in industrial varieties of Cheddar style cheeses. One commonly used example is [[annatto]], extracted from seeds of the tropical [[Achiote|achiote tree]]. The largest producer of industrial Cheddar style cheese  in the United States, [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]], uses a combination of annatto and oleoresin paprika, an extract of the lipophilic (oily) portion of [[paprika]].&lt;ref name=df&gt;{{Cite book

Coloured Cheddar style cheese has long been on sale, but even as early as 1860, the real reason for this was unclear:  [[Joseph Harding]] stated &quot;to the cheese consumers of [[London]] who prefer an adulterated food to that which is pure I have to announce an improvement in the annatto with which they compel the cheesemakers to colour the cheese&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| journal= Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England | volume= 21 | title= Recent Improvements in Dairy Practice | first= John | last= Murray | location= London | year= 1860 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=OKsGTRlEfSgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA82&amp;dq=joseph+harding+cheese | page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Feldman, an author of trivia books, &quot;The only reason why cheesemakers colour their product is because consumers seem to prefer it&quot;.&lt;ref name=df/&gt;

Cheddar cheese was sometimes (and still can be found) packaged in black wax, but was more commonly packaged in larded cloth, which was impermeable to contaminants, but still allowed the cheese to &quot;breathe&quot;, although this practice is now limited to artisan cheese makers.

The [[Slow Food|Slow Food Movement]] has created a ''Cheddar [[Presidium]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Blulab sas |url=http://www.slowfoodfoundation.org/eng/presidi/dettaglio.lasso?cod=148 |title=La Fondazione - slow food per la biodiversità - ONLUS |publisher=Slowfoodfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that only three cheeses should be called &quot;Cheddar&quot;.  Their specifications, which go further than the West Country farmhouse Cheddar [[Protected Designation of Origin]] (PDO), require that Cheddar cheese be made in Somerset and with traditional methods, such as using raw milk, traditional animal [[rennet]], and a cloth wrapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Presidia Artisan Somerset Cheddar  | work=The Slow Food Foundation | url=http://www.slowfoodfoundation.com/eng/presidi/dettaglio.lasso?cod=148 | accessdate=2007-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable Cheddar cheeses include &quot;Quickes&quot;, which in 2009 was awarded cheese of the year by the British Cheese Association, &quot;Keen's&quot;, with a strong tang, &quot;Montgomery's&quot;, with an apple after taste. An example of a cheese, made in the style of a traditional Cheddar in [[Lincolnshire]] is [[Lincolnshire Poacher cheese|&quot;Lincolnshire Poacher&quot;]].

==International production==
===Status===
{{Double image|right|PDO-Logo.svg|120|WestcountryCheddar-Counties.svg|120|PDO logo can be displayed on any approved West Country farmouse Cheddar cheese|The four English counties in the PDO}}
The generic name 'Cheddar cheese'  is used internationally, and does not currently have a [[Protected Geographical Status|protected designation]] of origin (PDO). However, the [[European Union]] recognises &quot;West Country farmhouse Cheddar&quot; as a PDO.&lt;ref name=&quot;PDO&quot;/&gt;
To meet this standard the cheese must be made in the traditional manner, using local ingredients, in one of four designated [[West Country]] counties of [[Somerset]], [[Devon]], [[Dorset]], or [[Cornwall]].  However only one producer of the cheese is now based in [[Cheddar]] itself, The Cheddar Gorge Cheese Co.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cheddargorgecheeseco.co.uk|title=Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheddar style cheeses are produced in the United Kingdom, Ireland,&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; Canada, United States of America,&lt;ref name=uwisc/&gt; South Africa, New Zealand, Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cheesematters.com.au/Cheddar/styles/|title=Styles|publisher=Cheesematters|accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden, Belgium, and the Netherlands. These varieties of cheese can be split in two categories, [[artisan cheese|artisanal cheese]] and [[industrial cheese]]. Artisan varieties of Cheddar develop diverse and strong flavour over time.  Industrial cheese's flavour varies significantly enough that food packaging will usually indicate a strength using adjectives such as mild, medium, strong, tasty, sharp, extra sharp, mature, old, or vintage, which may indicate the maturation period, or food additives used to enhance the flavour.

===Cheddar-style cheeses in the USA===
[[File:Easy cheese2.jpg|thumb|left|Easy Cheese in a can, typical of Cheddar-flavoured processed cheese]]
In the United States of America, industrial and processed Cheddar-style cheeses come in several varieties, including mild, medium, sharp, extra sharp, New York Style,  white, and Vermont.  New York style Cheddar cheese is a particularly sharp Cheddar. It is usually slightly softer than milder Cheddar varieties. Cheddar that has not been coloured is frequently labelled as &quot;white Cheddar&quot; or &quot;Vermont Cheddar&quot;, regardless of whether it was produced in the state of Vermont.

Many cheeses bear the Cheddar name, but are actually flavoured [[processed cheese]]s, and often bear little resemblance to the original cheese. Examples include [[Easy Cheese]], a processed cheese contained in a spray can or in individually wrapped processed cheese slices.

Cheddar cheese is one of several products used by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] to track the [[dairy industry]]; reports are issued weekly detailing prices and production quantities.  The state of [[Wisconsin]] produces the most Cheddar cheese in the United States; other centres of production include [[California]], [[Upstate New York]], [[Vermont]], and [[Tillamook, Oregon]].

==Record Cheddars==
[[White House]] [[historian]]s assert that U.S. [[President]] [[Andrew Jackson]] held an open house party where a 1,400&amp;nbsp;lb (635&amp;nbsp;kg) block of Cheddar cheese was served as &quot;refreshment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://clinton3.nara.gov/WH/glimpse/presidents/html/aj7.html | publisher= The White House | work= The Presidents of the United States of America | title= Andrew Jackson | accessdate= 2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This served as direct inspiration for &quot;[[Big Block of Cheese Day]]&quot;, which was featured in two episodes of the [[Emmy award|Emmy-award]] winning television series ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]''.

A cheese of 7,000&amp;nbsp;lb (3,175&amp;nbsp;kg) was produced in [[Ingersoll, Ontario]], in 1866 and exhibited in [[New York]] and Britain; it was immortalised in the [[poem]] &quot;Ode on the Mammoth Cheese Weighing over 7,000 Pounds&quot; by [[James McIntyre (poet)|James McIntyre]], a Canadian poet.

In 1893 farmers from the town of [[Perth, Ontario]] produced The Mammoth Cheese, at a weight of 22,000&amp;nbsp;lb (10,000&amp;nbsp;kg) for that year's [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]].  When placed on exhibit with the Canadian display, The Mammoth Cheese promptly crashed through the floor and had to be placed on reinforced concrete in the Agricultural Building. It was more written about than any other single exhibit at the fair, and received the bronze medal.

A still larger [[Wisconsin]] Cheddar cheese of 34,951&amp;nbsp;lb (15,853&amp;nbsp;kg) was produced for the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. It required the equivalent of the daily milk production of 16,000 [[cattle|cows]].

The largest cheddar ever produced was created in [[Oregon]] by the [[Federation of American Cheese-makers]] in 1989. The cheddar weighed in at over 56,850&amp;nbsp;lb (25,786&amp;nbsp;kg).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Classical orders from the Encyclopedie.png|thumb|250px|right|A refined canonic version of the Orders engraved for the ''[[Encyclopédie]],'' vol. 18]]
A '''classical order''' is one of the ancient styles of [[Classical antiquity|classical architecture]], each distinguished by its proportions and characteristic profiles and details, and most readily recognizable by the type of [[column]] employed. From the 16th century onwards, architectural theorists recognized five orders. The orders' origins come from Ancient Greece, later, they were used and modified by Romans. Each style has a distinctive [[capital]] and [[entablature]].

Ranged in the engraving (''illustration, right''), from the stockiest and most primitive to the richest and most slender, they are: [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] (Roman) and [[Doric order|Doric]] (Greek and Roman, illustrated here in its Roman version); [[Ionic order|Ionic]] (Greek version) and Ionic (Roman version); [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] (Greek and Roman) and [[Composite order|composite]] (Roman). There are just three ancient and original orders of architecture, the Doric, Ionic and Corinthian, which were invented by the Greeks. To these the Romans added the Tuscan, which they made simpler than the Doric, and the Composite, which was more ornamental than the Corinthian.

The ''order'' of a classical building is like the ''mode'' or ''key'' of classical music, or the ''grammar'' and ''rhetoric'' of a written composition. It is established by certain ''modules'' like the ''intervals'' of music, and it raises certain expectations in an audience attuned to its language.

The three parts of a column are the base, the shaft, and the capital. The horizontal structure supported on the columns is called the ''entablature', which consists of [[architrave]], [[frieze]] and [[cornice (architecture)|cornice]]. [[File:Table of architecture, Cyclopaedia, 1728, volume 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Table of architecture, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', 1728]]

The base consists of the ''stylobate'', the flat pavement on which the columns are placed, the ''plinth,'' a square block – sometimes circular – which forms the lowest part of the base, and [[Molding (decorative)|moldings]] with profiles. Common examples are the convex ''[[torus]]'' and the concave ''scotia,'' separated by fillets or bands.

On top of the base, the ''shaft'' is placed vertically. The shaft is cylindrical and both long and narrow. The shaft is sometimes articulated with vertical hollow grooves or ''[[Fluting (architecture)|fluting]]''. The shaft is wider at the bottom than at the top, because its ''[[entasis]]'', beginning a third of the way up, imperceptibly makes the column slightly more slender at the top.

The ''capital'' rests on the shaft. It has a load-bearing function, which concentrates the weight of the entablature on the supportive column, but it primarily serves an aesthetic purpose.  The simplest form of the capital is the Doric, consisting of three parts. The ''necking'' is the continuation of the shaft, but is visually separated by one or many grooves. The ''[[Molding (decorative)|echinus]]'' lies atop the necking.  It is a circular block that bulges outwards towards the top to support the ''[[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]]'', which is a square or shaped block that in turn supports the entablature.

The entablature consists of three horizontal layers, all of which are visually separated from each other using [http://www.grandtradition.net/wiki/index.php?title=Moldings moldings] or bands.  The three layers of the entablature have distinct names: the ''architrave'' comes at the bottom, the ''frieze'' is in the middle and the molded ''cornice'' lies on the top.  In Roman and post-Renaissance work, the entablature may be carried from column to column in the form of an [[arch]] that springs from the column that bears its weight, retaining its divisions and sculptural enrichment, if any.

==Measurement==
The height of columns are calculated in terms of a ratio between the diameter of the shaft at its base and the height of the column. A Doric column can be described as seven diameters high, an Ionic column as eight diameters high and a Corinthian column nine diameters high. Sometimes this is phrased as &quot;lower diameters high&quot;, to establish which part of the shaft has been measured.

==Greek orders==
[[Image:StGervais Fassade.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais Church]] in Paris presents columns of the three orders : doric at the ground floor, ionic at the second floor, corinthian at the third floor]]
There are three distinct orders in Ancient Greek architecture: Doric, Ionic, and, later, Corinthian. These three were adopted by the Romans, who modified their capitals. The Roman adoption of the Greek orders took place in the 1st century BC. The three Ancient Greek orders have since been consistently used in neo-classical European architecture.

Sometimes the Doric order is considered the earliest order, but there is no evidence to support this.  Rather, the Doric and Ionic orders seem to have appeared at around the same time, the Ionic in eastern Greece and the Doric in the west and mainland.

Both the Doric and the Ionic order appear to have originated in wood. The [[Temple of Hera (Olympia)|Temple of Hera]] in Olympia is the oldest well-preserved temple of Doric architecture. It was built just after [[600 BC]]. The Doric order later spread across Greece and into [[Sicily]] where it was the chief order for [[monumental architecture]] for 800 years.

===Doric order===
[[Image:DoricParthenon.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Doric order of the [[Parthenon]]]]
{{Main|Doric order}}
The Doric order originated on the mainland and western [[Greece]]. It is the simplest of the orders, characterized by short, faceted,&lt;!--what does &quot;faceted&quot; mean in this context?--&gt; heavy columns with plain, round [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s (tops) and no base. With a height that is only four to eight times its diameter, the columns are the most squat of all orders. The shaft of the Doric order is channeled with 20 flutes. The capital consists of a necking which is of a simple form. The echinus is convex and the abacus is square.

Above the capital is a square [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]] connecting the capital to the entablature.  The Entablature is divided into three horizontal registers, the lower part of which is either smooth or divided by horizontal lines.  The upper half is distinctive for the Doric order. The frieze of the Doric entablature is divided into [[triglyph]]s and [[metope (architecture)|metopes]]. A triglyph is a unit consisting of three vertical bands which are separated by grooves. Metopes are plain or carved reliefs.

The Greek forms of the Doric order come without an individual base. They instead are placed directly on the stylobate. Later forms, however, came with the conventional base consisting of a plinth and a torus. The Roman versions of the Doric order have smaller proportions. As a result they appear lighter than the Greek orders.

===Ionic order===
[[Image:Jonisk1.png|right|thumb|150px|Ionic order]]
{{Main|Ionic order}}
The Ionic order came from eastern Greece, where its origins are entwined with the similar but little known [[Aeolic order]]. It is distinguished by slender, fluted [[column|pillar]]s with a large base and two opposed ''volutes'' (also called ''scrolls'') in the echinus of the capital. The echinus itself is decorated with an [[egg-and-dart]] [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]. The Ionic shaft comes with four more flutes than the Doric counterpart (totalling 24). The Ionic base has two convex moldings called ''tori'' which are separated by a scotia.

The Ionic order is also marked by an [[entasis]], a curved tapering in the column shaft. A column of the ionic order is nine or lower diameters. The shaft itself is eight diameters high. The architrave of the entablature commonly consists of three stepped bands (''fasciae''). The frieze comes without the Doric ''triglyph'' and ''metope''. The frieze sometimes comes with a continuous ornament such as carved figures.

===Corinthian order===
[[Image:CorinthianOrderPantheon.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Corinthian order]]
{{Main|Corinthian order}}
The Corinthian order is the most ornate of the Greek orders, characterized by a slender fluted column having an ornate capital decorated with two rows of acanthus leaves and four scrolls. It is commonly regarded as the most elegant of the three orders.  The shaft of the Corinthian order has 24 flutes. The column is commonly ten diameters high.

Designed by [[Callimachus (sculptor)|Callimachus]], a Greek [[sculpture|sculptor]] of the 5th century BCE. The oldest known building to be built according to the Corinthian order is the [[Choragic Monument of Lysicrates]] in [[Athens]]. It was built in 335 to 334 BCE. The Corinthian order was raised to rank by the writings of the Roman writer [[Vitruvius]] in the 1st century BC.

==Roman orders==

The Romans adapted all the Greek orders and also developed two orders of their own, basically modification of Greek orders. The Romans also invented the [[superimposed order]]. A superimposed order is when successive stories of a building have different orders. The heaviest orders were at the bottom, whilst the lightest came at the top. This means that the Doric order was the order of the ground floor, the Ionic order was used for the middle story, while the Corinthian or the Composite order was used for the top story.

The [[Colossal order]] was invented by [[Renaissance architecture|architects in the Renaissance]]. The Colossal order is characterized by columns that extend the height of two or more stories.

===Tuscan order===
[[Image:PalladioTuscan.jpg|thumb|150px|The Tuscan order in [[Andrea Palladio]], ''Quattro Libri di Architettura,'' 1570]]
{{Main|Tuscan order}}
The Tuscan order has a very plain design, with a plain shaft, and a simple capital, base, and frieze. It is a simplified adaptation of the Doric order by the Romans. The Tuscan order is characterized by an unfluted shaft and a capital that only consist of an echinus and an abacus. In proportions it is similar to the Doric order, but overall it is significantly plainer. The column is normally seven diameters high. Compared to the other orders, the Tuscan order looks the most solid.

===Composite order===
[[Image:Komposita1.png|right|thumb|150px|Composite order]]
{{Main|Composite order}}
The Composite order is a mixed order, combining the volutes of the Ionic with the leaves of the Corinthian order. Until the [[Renaissance]] it was not ranked as a separate order. Instead it was considered as a late Roman form of the Corinthian order. The column of the Composite order is ten diameters high.

==Historical development of the orders==

The [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] period saw renewed interest in the ruins left by the ancient cultures of Greece and Rome, and the fertile development of a new architecture based on classical principles. The handbook ''[[De architectura]]'' by Roman writer, architect and engineer [[Vitruvius]], is the only architectural writing that survived from Antiquity. Rediscovered in the 15th century, Vitruvius was instantly hailed as the authority on classical orders and on architecture in general.

Architects of the Renaissance and the Baroque periods in Europe based their rules on Vitruvius' writings. What was added was rules for the use of the classical orders, and the exact proportions of the orders down to the most minute detail. Commentary on the appropriateness of the orders for temples devoted to particular deities (Vitruvius I.2.5) were elaborated by Renaissance theorists, to characterise the orders as bold and manly Doric, matronly Ionic, and maidenly Corinthian.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Small, [http://sites.scran.ac.uk/ada/documents/general/orders/classical_orders.htm &quot;The five orders of classical architecture&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vignola's orders==
{{Main|The Five Orders of Architecture}}
 
Following the examples of Vitruvius and the five books of the ''Regole generali d'architettura'' by [[Sebastiano Serlio]], published from 1537 onwards, [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]] produced an architecture rule book that was more practical than the previous two books, which were more philosophical in nature, his ''Cinque ordini di erchitettura'' (''The Five Orders of Architecture '') from 1562; the book is considered &quot;one of the most successful architectural textbooks ever written&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Taschen&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Evers|first=Vernd|title=Architectural theory: from the Renaissance to the present |year=2003|publisher=Taschen|isbn=9783822816998|pages=845|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V5OK-Yw-A3cC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=Vignola+%22Five+Orders%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rvP4TPjLI9WW4Abr6eTABw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Vignola%20%22Five%20Orders%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite having no text apart from the notes and the introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Summerson|first=John|title=The classical language of architecture|year=1963|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262690126|pages=56|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=57aoJE26kQkC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=Vignola+%22no+text%22+orders&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6wn5TIeqFI2P4gap2qHnBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Vignola%20%22no%20text%22%20orders&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book consisted simply of an introduction followed by 32 annotated plates, with views from the Pantheon illustrating the Corinthian order and the Theatre of Marcellus for the Doric order. Later editions had more illustrations. By 1700, it had been reprinted 15 times in Italian, and was translated in Dutch, English, French, German, Russian and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ware|first=William R.|title=The American Vignola: a guide to the making of classical architecture|year=1994|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=9780486283104|pages=160|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nV3eiQFnwyAC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=Vignola+%22Five+Orders%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rvP4TPjLI9WW4Abr6eTABw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Vignola%20%22Five%20Orders%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Each period interpreted the orders in their own way. The architecture of every subsequent period of European architecture was based on the classical orders.  In the later 18th century the rules of the Renaissance and the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] periods came to be disregarded, and the original use of the orders revived, based on first-hand study of the ruins of classical antiquity - often hailed as the 'correct' use of the orders.  

In America, ''The American Builder's Companion'',&lt;ref&gt;Asher Benjamin, ''The American Builder's Companion'', Dover edition: ISBN 0-486-22236-5. Based on the 1827 6th edition, 70 plates with many architectural details and instructions regarding proportion.&lt;/ref&gt; written in the early 19th century by the architect [[Asher Benjamin]], influenced many builders in the eastern states, particularly those who developed what became known as the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]].

The break from the classical mode came first with the [[Gothic revival]], then the development of modernism during the 19th century. The [[Bauhaus]] promoted pure functionalism, stripped of superfluous ornament, and that has become one of the defining characteristics of modern architecture. There are some exceptions. [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodernism]] introduced an ironic use of the orders as a cultural reference, divorced from the strict rules of composition. On the other hand, a few practitioners e.g. [[Quinlan Terry]] still work in a traditional classical idiom.

[[File:Corn-capital-litchfield.jpg|thumb|upright|Corn capital at the Litchfield Villa [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)]] ([[A.J. Davis]], architect)]]

== Nonce orders ==
Several orders, usually based upon the composite order and only varying in the design of the capitals, have been invented under the inspiration of specific occasions, but have not been used again. Thus they may be termed &quot;nonce orders&quot; on the analogy of [[nonce word]]s. [[Robert Adam]]'s brother [[James Adam (architect)|James]] was in Rome in 1762, drawing antiquities under the direction of [[Charles-Louis Clérisseau|Clérisseau]]; he invented a '''British Order''', of which his ink-and-wash rendering with red highlighting, is at the [[Avery Library]], [[Columbia University]]. Adam published an engraving of it. In its capital the heraldic lion and unicorn take the place of the Composite's volutes, a Byzantine/Romanesque conception, but expressed in terms of neoclassical realism. In 1789 [[George Dance the Elder|George Dance]] invented an '''[[Ammonite Order]]''', a variant of Ionic substituting volutes in the form of [[fossil]] [[ammonite]]s for [[John Boydell]]'s [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery|Shakespeare Gallery]] in [[Pall Mall, London]].

In the United States [[Benjamin Latrobe]], the architect of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]] in Washington DC, designed a series of botanically '''American orders'''. Most famous is the order substituting corncobs and their husks, which was executed by [[Giuseppe Franzoni]] and employed in the small domed Vestibule of the Supreme Court. Only the Supreme Court survived the fire of August 24, 1814, nearly intact. With peace restored, Latrobe designed an American order that substituted for the acanthus tobacco leaves, of which he sent a sketch  to [[Thomas Jefferson]] in a letter, November 5, 1816. He was encouraged to send a model of it, which remains at [[Monticello]]. In the 1830s [[Alexander Jackson Davis]] admired it enough to make a drawing of it. In 1809 Latrobe invented a second American order, employing [[magnolia]] flowers contrained within the profile of classical mouldings, as his drawing demonstrates. It was intended for &quot;the Upper Columns in the Gallery of the Entrance of the Chamber of the Senate&quot; ([http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/us.capitol/s4.html United States Capitol exhibit]).

These nonce orders all express the &quot;speaking architecture&quot; (''architecture parlante'') that was taught in the Paris courses, most explicitly by [[Étienne-Louis Boullée]], in which sculptural details of classical architecture could be enlisted to speak symbolically, the better to express the purpose of the structure and enrich its visual meaning with specific appropriateness. This idea was taken up strongly in the training of [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], ca 1875-1915: see [[architecture parlante]].

'''Catherine of Aragon''' (Spanish: ''Catalina de Aragón'') (16 December 1485 – 7 January 1536), also known as '''Katherine''' or '''Katharine''', was [[List of English consorts|Queen of England]] as the [[Wives of Henry VIII|first wife]] of King [[Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII of England]] and [[Princess of Wales]] as the wife to [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]]. In 1507, she also held the position of [[Ambassador]] for the Spanish Court in [[England]] when her father found himself without one, becoming the first female ambassador in European history.&lt;ref&gt;''The Six Wives of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII'' by Alison Weir. Page 59&lt;/ref&gt; For six months, she served as [[regent]] of England while Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII was in France. During that time the English won the [[Battle of Flodden]], an event in which Catherine played an important part. The controversial book &quot;The Education of Christian Women&quot; by [[Juan Luis Vives]], which claimed women have the right to an education, was dedicated to and commissioned by her. Such was Catherine's impression on people, that even her enemy, [[Thomas Cromwell]], said of her &quot;If not for her sex, she could have defied all the heroes of History.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eustace Chapuys, Imperial Ambassador, 1533 Calendar of State Papers, Spanish, IV, ii, 737&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shakespeare]] described her as &quot;The Queen of Earthly Queens&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare's ''All is True'', Act II, Scene IV&lt;/ref&gt; and during her early years as queen consort she was described as &quot;The most beautiful creature in the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Six Wives of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII'', by Alison Weir. Page 81.&lt;/ref&gt; She successfully appealed for the lives of the rebels involved in the [[Evil May Day]] for the sake of their families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erasmus Page 283&quot;&gt;''Contemporaries of Erasmus'', by Peter G. Bietenholz &amp; Thomas B. Deutscher. Page 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Catherine won widespread admiration by starting an extensive programme for the relief of the poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erasmus Page 283&quot;/&gt; She was also a patron of [[Renaissance humanism]], and a friend of the great scholars [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]] and [[Saint Thomas More]].

Henry VIII's move to have their 24-year marriage [[Annulment|annulled]] set in motion a chain of events that led to England's break with the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Henry was dissatisfied because their sons had died in infancy and others were stillborn, leaving their daughter, the future [[Mary&amp;nbsp;I of England]], as [[Heir presumptive|heiress presumptive]], at a time when there was no established precedent for a woman on the throne, although there was no [[Salic law]] in England. When [[Pope Clement&amp;nbsp;VII]] refused to annul the marriage, Henry defied him by assuming supremacy over religious matters. This allowed him to marry [[Anne Boleyn]] on the judgement of clergy in England, without reference to the Pope. He was motivated by the hope of fathering a male heir to the [[Tudor dynasty]]. Catherine refused to accept Henry as Supreme Head of the Church of England and considered herself, as did most of England and Europe, the King's rightful wife and Queen until her death.

==Early life==
[[File:Juan de Flandes 002.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Portrait by [[Juan de Flandes]] thought to be of 11-year old Catherine]]
Catherine was born at the Archbishop's Palace in [[Alcalá de Henares]] near Madrid, on the night of 16 December 1485. She was the youngest surviving child of King [[Ferdinand&amp;nbsp;II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella&amp;nbsp;I of Castile]]. Catherine was quite short in stature&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Fraser, ''The Wives of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII', p.24&lt;/ref&gt; with long golden auburn hair, wide blue eyes, a round face, and a fair complexion.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Weir, ''The Six Wives of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII'', 15&lt;/ref&gt; She was descended, on her maternal side, from the English royal house as her great-grandmother [[Catherine of Lancaster]], after whom she was named, and her great-great-grandmother [[Philippa of Lancaster]], were both daughters of [[John of Gaunt]] and granddaughters of [[Edward&amp;nbsp;III of England]]. Consequently she was third cousin of her father-in-law, [[Henry VII of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;VII]], and fourth cousin of her mother-in-law [[Elizabeth of York]].

She was educated by a tutor, [[Alessandro Geraldini]], who was a clerk in Holy Orders. Catherine studied religion, the classics, Latin histories, canon and civil law, heraldry, and genealogy. She had a strong religious upbringing and developed a faith that would play a major role in later life.&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Fraser, ''The Wives of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII',p.12&lt;/ref&gt; She learned to speak, read and write in Spanish and Latin, and spoke French and Greek. She was also taught domestic skills, such as needlepoint, lace-making, embroidery, music and dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; The great scholar [[Erasmus]] would later say that Catherine &quot;loved good literature which she had studied with success since childhood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Dowling, ''Humanism in the Age of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII'' (Published 1986), p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

At an early age, she was considered a suitable wife for [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]], the eldest son of [[Henry&amp;nbsp;VII of England]] and heir to the throne, due to her overwhelmingly prominent English ancestry inherited from her mother Queen [[Isabella&amp;nbsp;I of Castile]]. By means of her mother, Catherine had a stronger legitimate ancestry to the English throne via the two first wives of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]]; [[Blanche of Lancaster]] and the Spanish Infanta [[Constance of Castile (1354-1394)|Constance of Castile]], by whom John had hoped to claim the [[Crown of Castile]]. On the other hand [[Henry&amp;nbsp;VII of England]] was the descendant of Gaunt's third marriage to [[Katherine Swynford]], whose children were born out of wedlock and only legitimized after the death of Constance and the marriage of John to Katherine. The children of John and Katherine, while legitimized, were barred from ever inheriting the English throne. Because of this, the Tudor monarchy was not accepted by all the European kingdoms. At the time, the house of [[Trastámara]] was the most prestigious, due to the great rule of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], so the alliance of Catherine and Arthur validated the House of Tudor in the eyes of European royalty and also strengthened the Tudor claim to the English throne via Catherine of Aragon's ancestry. It would also have given a male heir an indisputable claim to the throne.  The two were [[Proxy marriage|married by proxy]] on 19 May 1499, and corresponded in Latin until Arthur turned fifteen and it was decided that they were old enough to be married.

==As wife and widow of Arthur==
[[File:Michel Sittow 002.jpg|thumb|right|Catherine as Dowager Princess of Wales]]

The couple later met on 4 November at [[Dogmersfield]] in [[Hampshire]]. Little is known about their first impressions of each other, but Arthur did write to his parents-in-law that he would be &quot;a true and loving husband&quot; and told his parents that he was immensely happy to &quot;behold the face of his lovely bride&quot;. Unfortunately, the couple found that they were unable to speak to each other since they had learned different pronunciations of Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Fraser, ''The Wives of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII', p.25&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later, on 14 November 1501, they were married at [[Old St. Paul's Cathedral]].

Once married, Arthur was sent to [[Ludlow Castle]] on the borders of [[Wales]], to preside over the [[Council of Wales and the Marches]], as was his duty as Prince of Wales, and his bride accompanied him. The couple stayed in [[Castle Lodge, Ludlow]]. A few months later, they both became ill, possibly with the [[sweating sickness]] which was sweeping the area. He died on 2 April 1502, and Catherine recovered to find herself a widow.

At this point, Henry&amp;nbsp;VII faced the challenge of avoiding returning her dowry to her father. To avoid complications, it was agreed she would marry Henry&amp;nbsp;VII's second son, Henry, Duke of York, who was five years younger than she was. However, the death of her mother meant that Catherine's 'value' in the marriage market decreased. Castile was a much larger kingdom than Aragon and  it was inherited by Catherine's mentally unstable elder sister, [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]]. Ostensibly, the marriage was delayed until Henry was old enough, but Henry&amp;nbsp;VII procrastinated so much about Catherine's unpaid dowry that it was doubtful if the marriage would ever take place. She lived as a virtual prisoner at [[Durham House (London)|Durham House]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Some of her letters to her father, complaining of her treatment, have survived. In one of these letters she tells him that &quot;I choose what I believe, and say nothing. For I am not as simple as I may seem.&quot; She had little money and struggled to cope, as she had the wellbeing of her ladies-in-waiting to maintain as well as her own. In 1507 she served as the Spanish Ambassador for England, thus becoming the first female ambassador in European history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henry VIII Page 59&quot;&gt;''The Six Wives of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII'', Alison Weir. Page 59.&lt;/ref&gt; While Henry&amp;nbsp;VII and his councillors expected her to be easily manipulated, Catherine went on to prove them wrong.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henry VIII Page 59&quot;/&gt;

Marriage to Arthur's brother depended on the Pope granting a [[Papal dispensation|dispensation]] because [[canon law]] forbade men to [[Affinity (canon law)|marry their brother's widows]]. Catherine testified her marriage to Arthur was never [[Consummation|consummated]], as also according to canon law, a marriage is not valid until consummated. The matter was considered of minor importance at the time, as the Pope had the power to overrule any objections, whether or not they were for religious reasons.

Catherine's second wedding took place on 11 June 1509, seven years after Prince Arthur's death. She married the then recently succeeded [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII]] in a private ceremony at Greenwich Church. She was 23 years of age. The king was just days short of his 18th birthday.

===Coronation===
 
On Saturday 23 June, the traditional eve-of-coronation procession to Westminster was greeted by a large and enthusiastic crowd. As was the custom, they spent the night before their [[coronation]] at the [[Tower of London]]. On Midsummer's Day, Sunday, {{Nowrap|24 June}} 1509, Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII and Catherine of Aragon were [[Anointing|anointed]] and [[coronation|crowned]] together by the Archbishop of Canterbury at a lavish ceremony at [[Westminster Abbey]]. The coronation was followed by a banquet in [[Westminster Hall]]. Many new [[Knights of the Bath]] were created in honour of the coronation.

===Pregnancies and children===
On 31 January 1510, Catherine gave birth prematurely to a stillborn daughter. A son, [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]], was born on New Year's Day 1511. He lived for only 52 days. In 1513, Catherine was pregnant again. Henry appointed her regent when he went to France on a military campaign. When the Scots invaded, they were defeated at the [[Battle of Flodden Field]], with Catherine addressing the army, and riding north in full armour with some of the troops, despite being heavily pregnant at the time. She sent a letter to Henry along with the bloodied coat of the [[King of Scots]], [[James IV of Scotland|James&amp;nbsp;IV]], who died in the battle.

Catherine had lost another son when Henry returned from France. He was either stillborn or died shortly after birth. In December 1514, she had another son, Prince Henry. On 18 February 1516, Catherine delivered a healthy girl. She was named [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and christened three days later with great ceremony at the Church of Observant Friars. In 1518, Catherine became pregnant for the last time. She gave birth to a daughter on 10 November, but the child was weak and lived either only a few hours or at most a week. Catherine was pregnant six times altogether.

[[Image:Catharineofaragonengland.jpg|thumb|left|Catherine watching Henry at the joust in honour of Catherine giving birth to a son]]

Catherine's religious dedication increased as she aged, as did her interest in academics. She continued to broaden her knowledge and provide training for her daughter. Education among women became fashionable, partly because of Catherine's influence. She also donated large sums of money to several colleges. Henry, however, still considered a male heir essential. The [[Tudor dynasty]] was new, and its legitimacy might still be tested. [[The Anarchy|A long civil war]] (1135–54) had been fought the last time a woman, ([[Henry&amp;nbsp;I of England]]'s daughter, [[Empress Matilda]]), had inherited the throne. The disasters of [[civil war]] were still fresh in living memory from the [[Wars of the Roses]].

In 1520, Catherine's nephew [[Charles&amp;nbsp;V, Holy Roman Emperor]], paid a state visit to England, and she urged Henry to enter an alliance with Charles rather than with France. Immediately after his departure, she accompanied Henry to France on the celebrated visit to [[Francis I of France|Francis&amp;nbsp;I]], the so-called [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]]. Within two years, war was declared against France and the Emperor was once again welcome in England, where plans were afoot to betroth him to Catherine's daughter Mary. It is a common belief that Catherine was indeed related to Clement&amp;nbsp;VII.

==The King's great matter==
{{Henryviiiwives}}
In 1525, Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII became enamoured  of [[Anne Boleyn]], a maid-of-honour to Queen Catherine who was between 10 and 17 years younger than Henry (Anne's exact year of birth is unknown). Henry began pursuing her.&lt;ref&gt;Scarisbrick, p.154.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time Catherine was no longer able to bear children. Henry began to believe that his marriage was cursed and sought confirmation from the Bible, which he interpreted to say that if a man marries his brother's wife, the couple will be childless.&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 20:21&lt;/ref&gt; Even if her marriage to Arthur had not been consummated (and Catherine would insist, to her dying day, that she had come to Henry's bed a virgin), Henry's interpretation of that biblical passage meant that their marriage had been wrong in the eyes of God.  Whether the Pope at the time of Henry and Catherine's marriage had had the right to overrule Henry's claimed scriptural impediment would become a hot point in Henry's campaign to wrest an annulment from the present Pope. It is possible that the idea of annulment had been suggested to Henry much earlier than this, and is highly probable that it was motivated by his desire for a son. Before Henry's father, Henry&amp;nbsp;VII, ascended the throne, England was beset by [[Wars of the Roses|civil warfare]] over rival claims to the English crown, and Henry may have wanted to avoid a similar uncertainty over the succession.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, p.70.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|My tribulations are so great, my life so disturbed by the plans daily invented to further the King's wicked intention, the surprises which the King gives me, with certain persons of his council, are so mortal, and my treatment is what God knows, that it is enough to shorten ten lives, much more mine.}}

It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry's desires to secure an annulment.&lt;ref&gt;Brigden, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine was defiant when it was suggested that she quietly retire to a nunnery, saying &quot;God never called me to a nunnery, I am the King's true and legitimate wife&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar, Michael (2001). ''A Treasure of Royal Scandals'', p.61. Penguin Books, New York. ISBN 0-7394-2025-9.&lt;/ref&gt; He set his hopes upon an appeal to the [[Holy See]], acting independently of [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Thomas Wolsey]], whom he told  nothing of his plans. [[William Knight (statesman)|William Knight]], the King's secretary, was sent to [[Pope Clement&amp;nbsp;VII]] to sue for an annulment, on the grounds that the dispensing [[papal bull|bull]] of [[Pope Julius&amp;nbsp;II]] was obtained by false pretences.

[[Image:Mary I by Master John.jpg|thumb|Catherine and Henry's daughter Mary never accepted Anne as queen.]]

As the Pope was, at that time, the prisoner of Catherine's nephew, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles&amp;nbsp;V]], following the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in May 1527, Knight had difficulty in obtaining access to him. In the end, Henry's envoy had to return without accomplishing much. Henry now had no choice but to put his great matter into the hands of [[Thomas Wolsey]], and Wolsey did all he could to secure a decision in Henry's favour.&lt;ref name=&quot;cehen&quot;&gt;{{ws|&quot;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Henry VIII|Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII]]&quot; in the 1913 ''Catholic Encyclopedia''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wolsey went so far as to convene an ecclesiastical court in England, with a representative of the Pope presiding, and Henry and Catherine herself in attendance. The Pope had no intention of allowing a decision to be reached in England, and his legate was recalled.  (How far the pope was influenced by Charles&amp;nbsp;V is difficult to say, but it is clear Henry saw that the Pope was unlikely to  annul his marriage to the Emperor's aunt.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, p.166.&lt;/ref&gt;) The Pope forbade Henry to marry again before a decision was given in Rome. Wolsey had failed and was dismissed from public office in 1529. Wolsey then began a secret plot to have Anne Boleyn forced into exile and began communicating with the Pope, to that end. When this was discovered, Henry ordered Wolsey's arrest and, had he not been  [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] and died in 1530, he might have been executed for [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;Haigh p.92f&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Catherine was banished from court, and her old rooms were given to Anne Boleyn. When [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[William Warham]] died, the Boleyn family's chaplain, [[Thomas Cranmer]], was appointed to the vacant position.&lt;ref name=&quot;cepop&quot;&gt;{{ws|&quot;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Clement VII|Clement&amp;nbsp;VII]]&quot; in the 1913 ''Catholic Encyclopedia''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Henry decided to annul his marriage to Catherine, [[John Fisher]] became her most trusted counsellor and one of her chief supporters. He appeared in the legates' court on her behalf, where he shocked people with the directness of his language, and by declaring that, like [[John the Baptist]], he was ready to die on behalf of the indissolubility of marriage. Henry was so enraged by this that he wrote a long Latin address to the legates in answer to Fisher's speech. Fisher's copy of this still exists, with his manuscript annotations in the margin which show how little he feared Henry's anger. The removal of the cause to Rome ended Fisher's role in the matter, but Henry never forgave him. Other people who supported Catherine's case included [[Thomas More]], Henry's own sister [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France]], [[Maria de Salinas]], [[Charles&amp;nbsp;V, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Pope Paul&amp;nbsp;III]] and Protestant Reformers [[Martin Luther]] and [[William Tyndale]].

==Later years==
{{Aragonese House of Trastámara}}

Upon returning to [[Dover]] from a meeting with King [[Francis&amp;nbsp;I of France]] in [[Calais]], Henry married Anne Boleyn in a secret ceremony. Some sources speculate that Anne was already pregnant at the time, but others testify that Anne (who had seen her sister [[Mary Boleyn]] taken up as the king's mistress and summarily cast aside) refused to sleep with Henry until they were married. Henry defended the legality of their union by pointing out that Catherine had previously been married. If she and Arthur had consummated their marriage, Henry by canon law had the right to remarry.&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, pp. 462–464.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 May 1533, Cranmer, sitting in judgment at a special court convened at [[Dunstable Priory]] to rule on the validity of Henry's marriage to Catherine, declared the marriage illegal, even though Catherine testified she and Arthur had never had physical relations. Cranmer ruled Henry and Anne's marriage valid five days later, on 28 May 1533.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p.124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of her life, Catherine would refer to herself as Henry's only lawful wedded wife and England's only rightful queen, and her servants continued to address her by that title. However, Henry refused her the right to any title but &quot;Dowager Princess of Wales&quot;, in recognition of her position as his brother's widow.

In 1535 she was transferred to [[Kimbolton Castle]]. There, she confined herself to one room (which she left only to attend Mass), dressed only in the hair shirt of the Order of St. Francis, and fasted continuously. While she was permitted to receive occasional visitors, she was forbidden to see her daughter, Mary. They were also forbidden to communicate in writing but sympathizers discreetly ferried letters between the two. Henry offered both mother and daughter better quarters and permission to see each other if they would acknowledge Anne Boleyn as his new Queen. Both refused. 

In late December 1535, sensing her death was near, Catherine made her [[will (law)|will]], and wrote to her nephew, the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles&amp;nbsp;V]], asking him to protect her daughter. She then penned one final letter to Henry, her &quot;most dear lord and husband&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Turner, ''The History of England from the Earliest Period to the Death of Elizabeth'' (Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green,1828)&lt;/ref&gt;:
{{quotation|My most dear lord, King and husband,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The hour of my death now drawing on, the tender love I ouge [owe] thou forceth me, my case being such, to commend myselv to thou, and to put thou in remembrance with a few words of the healthe and safeguard of thine allm [soul] which thou ougte to preferce before all worldley matters, and before the care and pampering of thy body, for the which thoust have cast me into many calamities and thineselv into many troubles. For my part, I pardon thou everything, and I desire to devoutly pray God that He will pardon thou also. For the rest, I commend unto thou our doughtere Mary, beseeching thou to be a good father unto her, as I have heretofore desired. I entreat thou also, on behalve of my maides, to give them marriage portions, which is not much, they being but three. For all mine other servants I solicit the wages due them, and a year more, lest they be unprovided for. Lastly, I makest this vouge [vow], that mine eyes desire thou aboufe all things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Katharine the Quene.}}

She died at [[Kimbolton Castle]], on {{Nowrap|7 January}} 1536. The following day, news of her death reached the King. According to the chronicler Edward Hall, Anne Boleyn wore yellow for the mourning, which has been interpreted in various ways; Polydore Vergil interpreted this to mean that Anne did not mourn.&lt;ref&gt;Warnicke, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Chapuys reported that it was actually King Henry who decked himself in yellow, celebrating the news and making a great show of his and Anne's daughter, Elizabeth, to his courtiers.&lt;ref&gt;Warnicke, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen as distasteful and vulgar by many. Another theory is that the dressing in yellow was out of respect for the late queen-princess dowager as yellow was said to be the Spanish colour of mourning. Certainly, later in the day it is reported that Henry and Anne both individually and privately wept for her death. On the day of Catherine's funeral, [[Anne Boleyn]] [[miscarriage|miscarried]] a son, which led to her execution a few months later. Rumours then circulated that Catherine had been poisoned by Anne or Henry, or both, as Anne had threatened to murder both Catherine and Mary on several occasions. The rumours were born after the apparent discovery during her embalming that there was a black growth on her heart that might have been caused by poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;Lofts, p.139.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern medical experts are in agreement that her heart's discolouration was due not to poisoning, but to [[heart cancer|cancer]], something which was not understood at the time. 

Catherine was buried in [[Peterborough Cathedral]] with the ceremony due to a Dowager [[Princess of Wales]], not a queen. Henry did not attend the funeral and refused to allow Mary to attend either.

==Faith==
Catherine was a member of the Spanish order of [[Third Order of Saint Francis|Observant Franciscans]] and  was punctilious in her religious observations, integrating without demur her necessary duties as queen with her personal piety.  The outward celebration of saints and holy relics formed no part of her personal devotions,&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; which  she rather expressed in [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]], prayer, confession and penance. Privately, however, she was aware of what she identified as the  shortcomings of the papacy and church officialdom.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{Citation|last1=Davies|first1=C. S. L. |last2=Edwards|first2=John|title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|date=January 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|chapter=Katherine (1485–1536)|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4891|quote=Katherine seems not to have displayed the credulity so often associated with the cults of saints, nor to have been concerned with such manifestations of devotion as the collection of holy relics. She had a keen eye for the failings of churchmen, including those of popes and cardinals.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her doubts about church improprieties certainly did not extend so far as to support the allegations of corruption made public by [[Martin Luther]] in Wittenberg in 1517, which were soon to have such far-reaching consequences in initiating the [[Protestant Reformation]]: In 1523  Fray Alfonso de Villa Sancta, a learned friar of the Observant Franciscans and friend of the king's old advisor [[Erasmus]], dedicated to the queen his book ''De Liberio Arbitrio adversus Melanchthonem'' denouncing  [[Philipp Melanchthon]], a supporter of Luther. Acting as her confessor, he was able to nominate her as a &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; for denying Luther's arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fraser|first=Antonia|authorlink=Antonia Fraser|title=The Six Wives of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII|edition=2002|year=1992|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|isbn=1842126334|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==

Catherine was of a very fair complexion, had [[eye color#Blue|blue eyes]], and had a [[hair colour]] that was between [[red hair|reddish]]-[[blond]]e and [[auburn hair|auburn]]; these were typical in members of the Trastámara family who were descendants of [[Peter&amp;nbsp;I of Castile]]. During her lifetime she was described as &quot;The most beautiful creature in the world&quot;, and that there was &quot;Nothing lacking in her that the most beautiful girl should have.&quot; [[Saint Thomas More]] would reflect later in her lifetime that in regards to her appearance &quot;There were few women who could compete with the Queen [Catherine] in her prime.&quot;

==Legacy, memory, and historiography==
In the reign of her daughter, [[Mary&amp;nbsp;I of England]], her marriage to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII]] was declared &quot;good and valid.&quot; Her daughter Queen Mary&amp;nbsp;I also had several portraits commissioned of Catherine, and it would not by any means be the last time she was painted. After her death, numerous portraits were painted of her, particularly of her speech at the Legatine Trial, a moment accurately rendered in Shakespeare's play about Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII. 

Her tomb in [[Peterborough Cathedral]] can be seen and there is hardly ever a time when it is not decorated with flowers or pomegranates, her heraldic symbol. It bears the title ''Katharine Queen of England''.

In the 20th century, [[George&amp;nbsp;V]]'s consort, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] had her grave upgraded and there are now banners there denoting Catherine as a Queen of England. Every year at Peterborough Cathedral there is a service in her memory. There are processions, prayers, and various events in the Cathedral including processions to Catherine's grave in which candles, pomegranates, flowers and other offerings are placed on her grave. On the service commemorating the 470th anniversary of her death, the Spanish Ambassador to the United Kingdom attended. During the 2010 service a rendition of Catherine of Aragon's speech before the legatine court was read by Jane Lapotaire.  There is a statue of her in her birthplace of [[Alcalá de Henares]], as a young woman holding a book and a rose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flickr.com/photos/29250286@N08/3206379232/ Catalina de Aragon on Flickr – Photo Sharing!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine has remained a popular biographical subject to the present day. The American historian [[Garrett Mattingly]] was the author of a popular biography ''Katherine of Aragon'' in 1942. In 1966, Catherine and her many supporters at court were the subjects of ''Catherine of Aragon and her Friends'', a biography by John E. Paul. In 1967, Mary M. Luke wrote the first book of her Tudor trilogy, ''Catherine the Queen'' which portrayed her and the controversial era of English history through which she lived. [[Image:Peterborough Katherine of Aragon.JPG|thumb|Grave of Katherine of Aragon in [[Peterborough Cathedral]].]] In recent years, the historian [[Alison Weir]] covered her life extensively in her biography ''[[The Six Wives of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII (book)|The Six Wives of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII]]'', first published in 1991. [[Antonia Fraser]] did the same in her own 1992 biography of the same title; as did the British historian [[David Starkey]] in his 2003 book ''Six Wives: The Queens of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII''.&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, David, ''Six Wives: The Queens of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII'' Part&amp;nbsp;I&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weir, Alison, ''The Six Wives of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII'' Part&amp;nbsp;I&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Antonia, ''The Six Wives of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII'' Part&amp;nbsp;I&lt;/ref&gt; Giles Tremlett's biography &quot;Catherine of Aragon: The Spanish Queen of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII&quot; came out in 2010, and Julia Fox's biography of Catherine of Aragon will be released in 2011.

===Places and statues===
* In Alcalá de Henares, the place of Catherine's birth, a statue of Catherine as a young woman holding a rose and a book can be seen in the Archbishop's Palace.
* [[Peterborough]] is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with the Castilian city of [[Alcalá de Henares]]. Children from schools in the two places have learned about each other as part of the twinning venture, and artists have even come over from Alcalá de Henares to paint Catherine's tombstone.
* Aragon Road in Ampthill is named after Catherine, there is also in Ampthill a statue of a cross named &quot;Queen Catherine's Cross&quot; in her honour.

===Spelling of her name===
Her baptismal name was &quot;Catalina&quot;, but &quot;Catherine&quot; was soon the accepted form in England after her marriage to Arthur.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Catherine herself signed her name &quot;Katherine&quot;, &quot;Katherina&quot;, &quot;Katharine&quot; and sometimes &quot;Katharina&quot;. In a letter to her, Arthur, her husband, addressed her as &quot;Princess Katerine&quot;. Her daughter Queen Mary&amp;nbsp;I called her &quot;Quene Kateryn&quot;, in her will. Rarely were names, particularly first names, written in an exact manner during the sixteenth century and it is evident from Catherine's own letters that she endorsed different variations.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine's endorsement of different spellings can be identified in numerous letters, signing herself as 'Katharine the Quene' in a letter to Wolsey in 1513 and as 'Katharine' in her final letter to Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII, dating to {{Nowrap|Jan 1536}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Loveknots built into his various palaces by her husband, Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII, display the initials &quot;H&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;K&quot;, as do other items belonging to Henry and Catherine, including  gold goblets, a gold salt cellar, basins of gold, and candlesticks. Her tomb in [[Peterborough Cathedral]] is marked &quot;Katharine Queen of England&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Fraser, ''The Six Wives of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII'', pages 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=findagrave&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&amp;GRid=6943310&amp;PIpi=354770 Find A Grave]&lt;/ref&gt;

]]
* 16 December 1485 – 14 November 1501: [[Infanta]] Catherine of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]]
* 14 November 1501 – 2 April 1502: The [[Princess of Wales]]&lt;small&gt;, [[Duchess of Cornwall]], [[Countess of Chester]]&lt;/small&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;PoW&quot;&gt;As spouse of the Prince of Wales, Katherine held the titles of Princess of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, and Countess of Chester.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2 April 1502 – 11 June 1509: The [[Dowager]] Princess of Wales&lt;small&gt;, Dowager Duchess of Cornwall, Dowager Countess of Chester&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dowager&quot;&gt;As a widow, she was Dowager Princess of Wales, Dowager Duchess of Cornwall, and Dowager Countess of Chester.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 11 June 1509 – 23 May 1533: ''[[Her Grace]]'' The [[Queen consort of England|Queen of England]]
**c. 1519 – 23 May 1533: ''Her [[Majesty]]'' The Queen of England &lt;ref name=&quot;majesty&quot;&gt;Around 1519 Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII decided Majesty should become the style of the Kings and Queens of England. &quot;Majesty&quot;, however, was not used exclusively; it arbitrarily alternated with both &quot;Highness&quot; and &quot;Grace&quot;, even in official documents.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 23 May 1533 – 7 January 1536: The Dowager Princess of Wales&lt;small&gt;, Dowager Duchess of Cornwall, Dowager Countess of Chester &lt;/small&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;dowager&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;queen&quot;&gt;Since Katherine never acknowledged the annulment of her marriage, she styled herself as Queen until her death.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art and media==
Over the years, numerous artistic and cultural works have been dedicated to her, written about her, or mentioned her, including some by her husband [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII]], who wrote &quot;Grene growth the holy&quot; about and for her, and [[Juan Luis Vives]], who dedicated &quot;The Education of Christian Women&quot; to her.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Weir,''The Six Wives of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII'', p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine of Aragon has been portrayed  in film, television, plays, books, and other forms many times, and as a result she has stayed very much in popular memory. There has never been a film or television series where she is the main character although an arguable exception is the first episode of ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (TV series)|The Six Wives of Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII]]'' which is told from her point of view and where she is portrayed by [[Annette Crosbie]]. There are also many novels, songs, and poems written about her.  [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII]]'' is tremendously successful in recreating, with great accuracy, Catherine's statement about the legitimacy of her marriage at the court in Blackfriars before King Henry, and Catherine's portrayal is very sympathetic therein.  However, most of the rest of the play is an attempt to absolve many, especially Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII, and the timing of key incidents (including Catherine's death) are changed and other events are avoided (the play makes Henry nearly an innocent pawn in the hands of a dastard Cardinal Wolsey, and the play stops short of Anne Boleyn's execution).

Although Catherine is often portrayed in film and on stage as having possessed the stereotypical Spanish traits of dark hair and eyes and an olive complexion, existing portraits and contemporary descriptions depict her as having had blue eyes, fair skin, and reddish-blonde hair, not uncommon for Spaniards from the northern regions of Spain, such as those from her father's land of [[Aragon]]. Furthermore, she was part English, through her ancestors, [[Katherine of Lancaster]] and [[Philippa of Lancaster]], who were both daughters of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]].

She is often played with a Spanish accent; from most reports, this is accurate, as she never fully mastered the English language.

* In the children's [[nursery rhyme]] &quot;I had a little nut tree&quot; she is the &quot;King of Spain's Daughter&quot;.
* She is remembered in a street ballad, for vouching for the rioters, on behalf of their wives and children, after the [[Evil May Day]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

[[David Suchet]] co-starred as [[Cardinal Wolsey]].
* [[Marge Simpson]] (voiced by [[Julie Kavner]]), as &quot;Margerine of Aragon&quot; in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode &quot;[[Margical History Tour]].&quot;
* [[Maria Doyle Kennedy]] in the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] 2007 television series, ''[[The Tudors]]'' opposite [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] as Henry.

* [[Ana Torrent]] in the 2007 film adaptation of the novel ''[[The Other Boleyn Girl]]'' by [[Philippa Gregory]], with [[Eric Bana]] as Henry&amp;nbsp;VIII.
* Virginia Weeks portrayed her in the play ''Six Dead Queens and an Inflatable Henry'', and is one of only three productions that show Catherine with the correct colouring.
* In 2008 she was played by Victoria Pelro in the film ''The Twisted Tale of Bloody Mary''.
*She is played by [[Siobhan Hewlett]] in the 2009 documentary ''Henry: Mind of a Tyrant''. This documentary is one of the few portrayals of Catherine to get her appearance correct.

'''Cathode rays''' (also called an '''electron beam''' or '''e-beam''') are streams of [[electron]]s observed in [[vacuum tube]]s. If an evacuated glass tube is equipped with two electrodes and a [[voltage]] is applied, the glass opposite of the negative electrode is observed to glow, due to electrons emitted from and travelling perpendicular to the [[cathode]] (the electrode connected to the negative terminal of the voltage supply).  They were first observed in 1869 by German physicist [[Johann Hittorf]], and were named in 1876 by [[Eugen Goldstein]] ''kathodenstrahlen'', or cathode rays. &lt;ref&gt;Joseph F. Keithley '' The story of electrical and magnetic measurements: from 500 B.C. to the 1940s'' John Wiley and Sons, 1999 ISBN 0780311930, page  205 &lt;/ref&gt;

Electrons were first discovered as the constituents of cathode rays.  In 1897 British physicist [[J. J. Thomson]] showed the rays were composed of a previously unknown negatively charged particle, which was later named the ''electron''. [[Cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs) using a focused beam of electrons deflected by electric or magnetic fields, create the image in a classic television set.

==Description==
[[Image:CrookesTube.svg|thumb||250px|right|A schematic diagram of a [[Crookes tube]] apparatus. '''A''' is a low voltage power supply to heat cathode '''C''' (a &quot;cold cathode&quot; was used by Crookes). '''B''' is a high voltage power supply to energize the phosphor-coated anode '''P'''. Shadow mask '''M''' is connected to the cathode potential and its image is seen on the phosphor as a non-glowing area.]]

Cathode rays are so named because they are emitted by the negative electrode, or cathode, in a vacuum tube.  To release electrons into the tube, they first must be detached from the [[atom]]s of the cathode.  In the early [[cold cathode]] vacuum tubes, called [[Crookes tube]]s, this was done by using a high electrical potential between the anode and the cathode to ionize the residual gas in the tube; the ions were accelerated by the electric field and released electrons when they collided with the cathode.  Modern vacuum tubes use [[thermionic emission]], in which the cathode is made of a thin wire [[Electrical filament|filament]] which is heated by a separate [[electric current]] passing through it.  The increased random heat motion of the filament atoms knocks electrons out of the atoms at the surface of the filament, into the evacuated space of the tube.

Since the electrons have a negative charge, they are repelled by the cathode and attracted to the anode.  They travel in straight lines through the empty tube.  The voltage applied between the electrodes accelerates these low mass particles to high velocities.   Cathode rays are invisible, but their presence was first detected in early vacuum tubes when they struck the glass wall of the tube, exciting the atoms of the glass and causing them to emit light, a glow called [[fluorescence]].  Researchers noticed that objects placed in the tube in front of the cathode could cast a shadow on the glowing wall, and realized that something must be travelling in straight lines from the cathode.  After the electrons reach the anode, they travel through the anode wire to the power supply and back to the cathode, so cathode rays carry electric current through the tube.

The current in a beam of cathode rays through a tube can be controlled by passing it through a metal screen of wires (a [[Control grid|grid]]) to which a small voltage is applied.  The electric field of the wires deflects some of the electrons, preventing them from reaching the anode.  Thus a small voltage can be made to control a much larger voltage.  This is the principle used in vacuum tubes to [[Amplifier|amplify]] electrical signals.   High speed beams of cathode rays can also be steered and manipulated by [[electric field]]s created by additional metal plates in the tube to which voltage is applied, or [[magnetic field]]s created by coils of wire ([[electromagnet]]s).  These are used in cathode ray tubes, found in televisions and computer monitors, and in [[electron microscope]]s.

==History==
After the 1690 invention of the [[vacuum pump]] by [[Otto von Guericke]], physicists began to experiment with passing high voltage electricity through [[rarefied air]].  In 1705, it was noted that [[electrostatic generator]] sparks travel a longer distance through low pressure air than through atmospheric pressure air.

===Gas discharge tubes===
In 1838, [[Michael Faraday]] passed a current through a rarefied air filled glass tube and noticed a strange light arc with its beginning at the [[cathode]] (negative electrode) and its end almost at the anode (positive electrode).  In 1857, German physicist and glassblower [[Heinrich Geissler]] sucked even more air out with an improved pump, to a pressure of around 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]] and found that, instead of an arc, the glow filled the tube.  The voltage applied between the two electrodes of the tubes, generated by an [[induction coil]], was anywhere between a few [[kilovolt]]s and 100 kV.  These were called [[Geissler tube]]s, similar to today's [[neon sign]]s.

The explanation of these effects was that the high voltage accelerated electrically charged atoms (ions) naturally present in the air of the tube.  At low pressure, there was enough space between the gas atoms that the ions could accelerate to high enough speeds that when they struck another atom they knocked electrons off of it, creating more positive ions and free electrons in a chain reaction.  The positive ions were all attracted to the cathode.  When they struck it they knocked many electrons out of the metal.  The free electrons were all attracted to the anode.

In the Geissler tubes, there was so much air that the electrons could only travel a tiny distance before colliding with an atom.  The electrons in these tubes moved in a slow [[diffusion]] process, never gaining much speed, so these tubes didn't produce cathode rays.  The glow in the gas was caused when the electrons or ions struck gas atoms, exciting their orbital electrons to higher energy levels.  The electrons released this energy as light.  This process is called fluorescence.

===Cathode rays===
By the 1870s, British physicist [[William Crookes]] and others were able to evacuate tubes to a lower pressure, below 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; atm.  These were called Crookes tubes.  Faraday had been the first to notice a dark space just in front of the cathode, where there was no luminescence.  This came to be called the &quot;cathode dark space&quot;, &quot;Faraday dark space&quot; or &quot;Crookes dark space&quot;.  Crookes found that as he pumped more air out of the tubes, the Faraday dark space spread down the tube from the cathode toward the anode, until the tube was totally dark.  But at the anode (positive) end of the tube, the glass of the tube itself began to glow.

What was happening was that as more air was pumped from the tubes, the electrons could travel farther, on average, before they struck a gas atom.  By the time the tube was dark, most of the electrons could travel in straight lines from the cathode to the anode end of the tube without a collision.  With no obstructions, these low mass particles were accelerated to high velocities by the voltage between the electrodes.  These were the cathode rays.

When they reached the anode end of the tube, they were travelling so fast that, although they were attracted to it, they often flew past the anode and struck the back wall of the tube.  When they struck atoms in the glass wall, they excited their orbital electrons to higher energy levels, causing them to [[fluoresce]].  Later researchers painted the inside back wall with fluorescent chemicals such as [[zinc sulfide]], to make the glow more visible.

Cathode rays themselves are invisible, but this accidental fluorescence allowed researchers to notice that objects in the tube in front of the cathode, such as the anode, cast sharp-edged shadows on the glowing back wall.  In 1869, German physicist [[Johann Hittorf]] was first to realize that something must be travelling in straight lines from the cathode to cast the shadows.  [[Eugen Goldstein]] named them ''cathode rays''.

===Discovery of the electron===
At this time, atoms were the smallest particles known, and were believed to be indivisible.  What carried electric currents was a mystery.  During the last quarter of the 19th century many experiments were done to determine what cathode rays were.  There were two theories.  Crookes and Artur Shuster believed they were particles of &quot;radiant matter&quot;, that is, electrically charged atoms.  German scientists Eilhard Wiedemann, [[Heinrich Hertz]] and Goldstein believed they were &quot;aether waves&quot;, some new form of [[electromagnetic radiation]], and were separate from what carried the electric current through the tube.

The debate was resolved in 1897 when [[J. J. Thomson]] measured the mass of cathode rays, showing they were made of particles, but were around 1800 times lighter than the lightest atom, [[hydrogen]].  Therefore they were not atoms, but a new particle which he originally called &quot;''corpuscle''&quot; but was later named ''electron''.  He also showed they were identical with particles given off by [[Photoelectric effect|photoelectric]] and radioactive materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Thomson was given the 1906 [[Nobel prize]] for physics for this work.  [[Philipp Lenard]] also contributed a great deal to cathode ray theory, winning the Nobel prize for physics in 1905 for his research on cathode rays and their properties.

===Vacuum tubes===
The gas ionization (or [[cold cathode]]) method of producing cathode rays used in Crookes tubes was unreliable, because it depended on the pressure of the residual air in the tube.  Over time, the air was absorbed by the walls of the tube, and it stopped working.

A more reliable and controllable method of producing cathode rays was investigated by Hittorf and Goldstein, and rediscovered by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1880.  A cathode made of a wire filament heated red hot by a separate current passing through it would release electrons into the tube by a process called [[thermionic emission]].  The first true electronic vacuum tubes, invented around 1906, used this [[hot cathode]] technique, and they superseded Crookes tubes.  These tubes didn't need gas in them to work, so they were evacuated to a lower pressure, around  10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; atm (10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; P).  The ionization method of creating cathode rays used in Crookes tubes is today only used in a few specialized [[gas discharge tube]]s such as [[krytron]]s.

Cathode rays are now usually called electron beams.  The technology of manipulating electron beams pioneered in these early tubes was applied practically in the design of vacuum tubes, particularly in the invention of the cathode ray tube by [[Ferdinand Braun]] in 1897.  and is today employed in sophisticated devices such as [[electron microscope]]s, [[electron beam lithography]], and [[particle accelerator]]s.

==Particles of Cathode Rays==

Like a wave:
* they travelled in straight lines
* Produced a shadow when obstructed by objects
* could pass through thin metal foils without disturbing them (Tested by New Zealander Ernest Rutherford using gold foil.)

These conflicting properties caused disruptions when trying to classify it as a wave or particle. Crookes insisted it was a particle, whilst Hertz maintained it was a wave. The debate was resolved when an electric field was used to deflect the rays by J. J. Thomson. This evidence that the beams were composed of particles was strong because scientists knew it was impossible to deflect electromagnetic waves with an electric field.

[[Louis de Broglie]] later (1924) showed in his doctoral dissertation that electrons are in fact much like photons in the respect that they act both as waves and as particles in a [[Wave–particle duality|dual manner]] as [[Einstein]] had shown earlier for light. The wave-like behaviour of Cathode Ray particles was later directly demonstrated using a crystal lattice by [[Davisson–Germer experiment|Davisson and Germer]] in 1927.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Copper cathode 2.png|thumb|Diagram of a [[copper]] cathode in a [[galvanic cell]] (e.g., a battery). A positive current ''i'' flows out of the cathode (CCD mnemonic: Cathode Current Departs).]]  A '''cathode''' is an [[electrode]] through which [[electric current]] flows ''out of'' a polarized electrical device. [[Mnemonic]]: CCD (Cathode Current Departs).
Cathode [[Electrical polarity|polarity]] is not always negative. Although positively charged [[ion|cations]] always move towards the cathode (hence their name) and/or negatively charged [[ion|anions]] move away from it, cathode polarity depends on the device type, and can even vary according to the operating mode. In a device which consumes power, the cathode is negative, and in a device which provides power, the cathode is positive:
* In a discharging battery or a [[galvanic cell]] the cathode is the positive terminal since that is where the current flows out of the device (see drawing). This outward current is carried internally by positive ions moving from the [[electrolyte]] to the positive cathode (chemical energy is responsible for this &quot;uphill&quot; motion). It is continued externally by electrons moving inwards, negative charge moving one way constituting positive current flowing the other way. For example, the [[Daniell cell|Daniell galvanic cell]]'s copper electrode is the positive terminal and the cathode.
* In a recharging battery, or an [[electrolytic cell]], the cathode is the negative terminal, which sends current back to the external generator.  For example, reversing the current direction in a [[Daniell cell|Daniell galvanic cell]] would produce an electrolytic cell&lt;ref name=&quot;Reversed Daniell Cell&quot;&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/chemical/electrolyt.html#c1], Daniell cell can be reversed to, technically, produce an electrolytic cell.&lt;/ref&gt;, where the copper electrode is the positive terminal and the anode.
* In a [[diode]], it is the negative terminal at the pointed end of the arrow symbol, where current flows out of the device. Note: electrode naming for diodes is always based on the direction of the forward current (that of the arrow, in which the current flows &quot;most easily&quot;), even for types such as [[Zener diode]]s or [[solar cell]]s where the current of interest is the reverse current.
* In [[vacuum tube]]s (including [[cathode ray tube]]s) it is the negative terminal where electrons flow in from the wiring and through the tube's near vacuum, constituting a positive current flowing out of the device.

An electrode through which current flows the other way (into the device) is termed an [[anode]].

==Etymology==
The word was coined in 1834 from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κάθοδος (''kathodos''), 'descent' or 'way down', by [[William Whewell]], who had been consulted&lt;ref&gt;Ross, S, ''Faraday Consults the Scholars: The Origins of the Terms of Electrochemistry'' in ''Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London (1938-1996)'', Volume 16, Number 2 / 1961, Pages: 187 - 220, [http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/link.asp?id=y61755r466478481] consulted 2006-12-22&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Michael Faraday]] over some new names needed to complete a paper on the recently discovered process of electrolysis. In that paper Faraday explained that when an electrolytic cell is oriented so that electric current traverses the &quot;decomposing body&quot; (electrolyte) in a direction &quot;from East to West, or, which will strengthen this help to the memory, that in which the sun appears to move&quot;, the cathode is where the current leaves the electrolyte, on the West side: &quot;''kata'' downwards, ''`odos'' a way ; the way which the sun sets&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Faraday, Michael, ''Experimental Researches in Electricity. Seventh Series, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London (1776-1886)'', Volume 124, 1 January 1834, Page 77, [http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/link.asp?id=526145013443q040] consulted 2006-12-27 (in which Faraday introduces the words ''[[electrode]]'', ''[[anode]]'', ''cathode'', ''[[anion]]'', ''[[cation]]'', ''[[electrolyte]]'', ''[[electrolyze]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faraday, Michael, ''Experimental Researches in Electricity'', Volume 1, 1849, reprint of series 1 to 14, freely accessible Gutenberg.org transcript [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14986] consulted 2007-01-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of 'West' to mean the 'out' direction (actually 'out' → 'West' → 'sunset' → 'down', i.e. 'out of view') may appear unnecessarily contrived. Previously, as related in the first reference cited above, Faraday had used the more straightforward term &quot;exode&quot; (the doorway where the current exits). His motivation for changing it to something meaning 'the West electrode' (other candidates had been &quot;westode&quot;, &quot;occiode&quot; and &quot;dysiode&quot;) was to make it immune to a possible later change in the direction convention for [[electric current|current]], whose exact nature was not known at the time. The reference he used to this effect was the Earth's magnetic field direction, which at that time was believed to be invariant. He fundamentally defined his arbitrary orientation for the cell as being that in which the internal current would run parallel to and in the same direction as a hypothetical [[solenoid|magnetizing current loop]] around the local line of latitude which would induce a magnetic [[dipole]] field oriented like the Earth's. This made the internal current East to West as previously mentioned, but in the event of a later convention change it would have become West to East, so that the West electrode would not have been the 'way out' any more. Therefore &quot;exode&quot; would have become inappropriate, whereas &quot;cathode&quot; meaning 'West electrode' would have remained correct with respect to the unchanged direction of the actual phenomenon underlying the current, then unknown but, he thought, unambiguously defined by the magnetic reference. In retrospect the name change was unfortunate, not only because the Greek roots alone do not reveal the cathode's function any more, but more importantly because, as we now know, the Earth's magnetic field direction on which the &quot;cathode&quot; term is based is subject to [[Geomagnetic reversal|reversals]] whereas the [[electric current|current]] direction convention on which the &quot;exode&quot; term was based has no reason to change in the future.

Since the later discovery of the [[electron]], an easier to remember, and more durably technically correct (although historically false), etymology has been suggested: cathode, from the Greek ''kathodos'', 'way down', 'the way (down) into the cell (or other device) for electrons'.

==Flow of electrons==
The flow of electrons is always from anode to cathode outside of the cell or device, regardless of the cell or device type and operating mode, with the exception of diodes where electrode naming always assumes current flows in the forward direction (that of the arrow symbol), i.e., electrons flow in the opposite direction, even when the diode reverse-conducts either by accident (breakdown of a normal diode) or by design (breakdown of a Zener diode, photo-current of a photodiode or solar cell).

==Chemistry cathode==
In [[chemistry]], a '''cathode''' is the [[electrode]] of an [[electrochemical cell]] at which [[Reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] occurs; a useful [[mnemonic]] to remember this is AnOx RedCat. The cathode can be negative as when the cell is electrolytic (where electrical energy provided to the cell is being used to decompose chemical compounds); or positive as when the cell is galvanic (where chemical reactions are used to generate electrical energy).  The cathode supplies electrons to the positively charged cations which flow to it from the electrolyte (even if the cell is galvanic, i.e., when the cathode is positive and therefore would be expected to repel the positively charged cations; this is due to [[electrode potential]] relative to the electrolyte solution being different for the anode and cathode metal/electrolyte systems in a [[galvanic cell]]).

The '''cathodic current''', in [[electrochemistry]], is the flow of [[electrons]] from the cathode interface to a species in solution.  The '''anodic current''' is the flow of electrons into the anode from a species in solution.

===Electrolytic cell===
In an [[electrolytic cell]], the cathode is where the negative polarity is applied to drive the cell.  Common results of reduction at the cathode are hydrogen gas or pure metal from metal ions.  When discussing the relative reducing power of two redox agents, the couple for generating the more reducing species is said to be more &quot;cathodic&quot; with respect to the more easily reduced reagent.

===Galvanic cell===
In a [[galvanic cell]], the cathode is where the positive [[Polarity (physics)|pole]] is connected to allow the circuit to be completed: as the anode of the galvanic cell gives off electrons, they return from the circuit into the cell through the cathode.

===Electroplating metal cathode===
When metal ions are reduced from ionic solution, they form a pure metal surface on the cathode.  Items to be plated with pure metal are attached to and become part of the cathode in the electrolytic solution.

==Electronics and physics cathode==
In [[physics]] or [[electronics]], a '''cathode''' is an electrode that emits electrons into the device.

===Vacuum tubes===
In a vacuum tube or  electronic vacuum system, the cathode emits free electrons. Electrons are extracted from metal electrodes either by heating the electrode, causing [[thermionic emission]],  or by applying a strong electric field and causing [[field electron emission]]. Electrons can also be emitted from the [[electrode]]s of certain metals when light of [[frequency]] greater than the threshold frequency falls on it. This effect is called [[photoelectric emission]].

===Cold cathodes and hot cathodes===
Cathodes used for [[field electron emission]] in vacuum tubes are called '''[[cold cathode]]s'''.  Heated electrodes or '''[[hot cathode]]s''', frequently called [[wiktionary:Filaments|filaments]], are much more common.   Most radios and television sets prior to the 1970s used filament-heated-cathode electron tubes for signal selection and processing; to this day, a hot cathode forms the source of the electron beam(s) in [[cathode ray tubes]] in many television sets and computer monitors. Hot electron emitters are also used as the electrodes in [[fluorescent lamps]] and in the source tubes of [[X-ray]] machines.

===Diodes===
[[Image:Diode symbol.svg|thumb|right]]
In a [[semiconductor device|semiconductor]] [[diode]], the cathode is the N–doped layer of the PN junction with a high density of free electrons as a result of doping, and an equal density of fixed positive charges, which are the dopants that have been thermally ionized. In the anode, the converse applies: It features a high density of free &quot;holes&quot; and consequently fixed negative dopants which have captured an electron (hence the origin of the holes).

When P and N-doped layers are placed in contact, diffusion ensures that electrons flow from high to low density areas: That is, from the N to the P side. They leave behind the fixed positively charged dopants near the junction. Similarly, holes diffuse from P to N leaving behind fixed negative ionised dopants near the junction. These layers of fixed positive and negative charges, collectively known as the depletion layer because they are depleted of free electrons and holes. The depletion layer at the junction is at the origin of the diode's rectifying properties. This is due to the resulting internal field and corresponding potential barrier which inhibit current flow in reverse applied bias which increases the internal depletion layer field. Conversely, they allow it in forwards applied bias where the applied bias reduces the built in potential barrier.

Electrons which diffuse from the cathode into the P-doped layer, or anode, become what is termed &quot;minority carriers&quot; and tend to recombine there with the majority carriers, which are holes, on a timescale characteristic of the material which is the p-type minority carrier lifetime. Similarly, holes diffusing into the N-doped layer become minority carriers and tend to recombine with electrons. In equilibrium, with no applied bias, thermally assisted diffusion of electrons and holes in opposite directions across the depletion layer ensure a zero net current with electrons flowing from cathode to anode and recombining, and holes flowing from anode to cathode across the junction or depletion layer and recombining.

Like a typical diode, there is a fixed anode and cathode in a zener diode, but it will conduct current in the reverse direction (electrons from anode to cathode) if its breakdown voltage or &quot;Zener voltage&quot; is exceeded.

'''Chrominance''' (''chroma'' or C for short) is the signal used in [[video]] systems to convey the color information of the picture, separately from the accompanying [[Luma (video)|luma]] signal (or Y for short). Chrominance is usually represented as two color-difference components: U = B' − Y' (blue − luma) and V = R' − Y' (red − luma).  Each of these difference components may have scale factors and offsets applied to it, as specified by the applicable video standard.  

In [[composite video]] signals, the U and V signals modulate a color [[subcarrier]] signal, and the result is referred to as the chrominance signal; the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] and [[amplitude]] of this modulated chrominance signal correspond approximately to the [[hue]] and [[Saturation_(color_theory)|saturation]] of the color.  In digital-video and still-image [[color space]]s such as [[Y'CbCr]], the luma and chrominance components are digital sample values.

Separating [[RGB]] color signals into luma and chrominance allows the [[Bandwidth_(signal_processing)|bandwidth]] of each to be determined separately.  Typically, the chrominance bandwidth is reduced in analog composite video by reducing the bandwidth of a modulated color subcarrier, and in digital systems by [[chroma subsampling]].

==History==

The idea of transmitting a [[color television]] signal with distinct [[Luma (video)|luma]] and chrominance components originated with [[Georges Valensi]], who patented the idea in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;French patent 841335, issued Feb. 6, 1939; cited in U.S. Patent 2375966 [http://www.google.com/patents?id=dbhHAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;dq=ininventor:valensi+color+television#PPA20,M1 &quot;System of Television in Colors&quot;], issued May 15, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; Valensi's patent application described:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(t)he use of two channels, one transmitting the predominating color (signal T), and the other the mean brilliance (signal t) output from a single television transmitter to be received not only by color television receivers provided with the necessary more expensive equipment, but also by the ordinary type of television receiver which is more numerous and less expensive and which reproduces the pictures in black and white only.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Previous schemes for color television systems, which were incompatible with existing monochrome receivers,  transmitted [[RGB]] signals in various ways.

==Television standards==

In [[analog television]], chrominance is encoded into a [[video]] signal using a [[subcarrier]] frequency. Depending on the video standard, the chrominance subcarrier may be either [[quadrature amplitude modulation|quadrature-amplitude-modulated]] ([[NTSC]] and [[PAL]]) or [[frequency modulation|frequency-modulated]] ([[SECAM]]).

In the [[PAL]] system, the color subcarrier is 4.43 MHz above the video carrier, while in the [[NTSC]] system it is 3.58 MHz above the video carrier. The NTSC and PAL standards are the most commonly used, although there are other video standards that employ different [[subcarrier]] frequencies. For example, [[PAL-M (television)|PAL-M]] (Brazil) uses a 3.58 MHz [[subcarrier]], and [[SECAM]] uses two different frequencies, 4.250 MHz and 4.40625 MHz above the video carrier.

The presence of chrominance in a video signal is indicated by a [[color burst]] signal transmitted on the [[back porch]], just after horizontal synchronization and before each line of video starts. If the color burst signal were visible on a television screen, it would appear as a vertical strip of a very dark olive color. In [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]], [[hue]] is represented by a phase shift of the chrominance signal relative to the color burst, while saturation is determined by the amplitude of the [[subcarrier]]. In [[SECAM]] (R'-Y') and (B'-Y') signals are transmitted alternately and phase does not matter.

Chrominance is represented by the [[YUV|U-V]] color plane in [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] video signals, and by the [[YIQ|I-Q]] color plane in [[NTSC]].

==Digital systems==

Digital video and digital still photography systems sometimes use a luma/chroma decomposition for improved compression.  For example, when an ordinary [[RGB]] digital image is compressed via the [[JPEG]] standard, the [[RGB]] colorspace is first converted (by a rotation [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]) to a [[YCbCr]] colorspace, because the three components in that space have less correlation redundancy and because the chrominance components can then be subsampled by a factor of 2 or 4 to further compress the image.  On decompression, the Y'CbCr space is rotated back to [[RGB]].

A '''campus''' is traditionally the land on which a [[college]] or [[university]] and related institutional buildings are situated. Usually a campus includes [[library|libraries]], [[lecture]] halls, [[residence hall]]s and park-like settings. The definition currently describes a collection of buildings that belong to a given institution, either academic or non-academic.

The word first was adopted to describe a particular urban space at the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]) during the early decades of the 18th century. Some other American colleges later adopted the word to describe individual fields at their own institutions, but &quot;campus&quot; did not yet describe the whole university property. A school might have one space called a campus, one called a field, and another called a yard. 

The meaning expanded to include the whole institutional [[real property|property]] during the 20th century, with the old meaning persisting into the 1950s in some places. Sometimes the lands on which company office buildings sit, along with the buildings, are called campuses. The [[Microsoft Campus]] in [[Redmond, Washington]], as well as [[hospital]]s use the term to describe the territory of their facilities. The word &quot;campus&quot; has also been applied to European universities, although most such institutions are characterized by ownership of individual buildings in urban settings rather than park-like lawns in which buildings are placed.

A '''crossbow''' is a [[weapon]] consisting of a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] mounted on a stock that shoots projectiles, often called bolts or [[quarrel]]s. The medieval crossbow was called by many names, most of which derived from the word [[ballista]], a torsion engine resembling a crossbow in  appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Payne-Gallwey |first=Ralph |authorlink=Sir Ralph Frankland-Payne-Gallwey, 3rd Baronet |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=The Crossbow |origyear=1903 |year=2007 |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc. |isbn=1-6023-9010-X |pages=2 |chapter= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, crossbows played a significant role in the warfare of East Asia since the 4th century B.C., as well as Europe and the Mediterranean. Today, they are used primarily for [[target shooting]] and [[hunting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.crossbowhunting.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=63 |title=Crossbow Regulations |accessdate=2007-01-26 |date=2006-11-22 |publisher=CrossbowHunting.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Martyrium of Saint Sebastian. Pic 03.jpg|thumb|[[Late Middle Ages|Late medieval]] crossbowman; wooden figure from ca. 1480. Note the [[quiver]] hanging from the belt.]]

A crossbow is a weapon  [[bow (weapon)|bow]] mounted on a stick (called a tiller or stock) with a mechanism in it which holds the drawn [[bow string]]. The earliest designs featured a slot in the stock, down into which the string was placed. To fire this design, a vertical rod is thrust up through a hole in the bottom of the notch, forcing the string out. This rod is usually attached perpendicular to a rear-facing firing lever called a trigger or 'tickler'. A later design implemented a rolling cylindrical pawl called a 'nut' to retain the string. This nut has a perpendicular center slot for the bolt, and an intersecting axial slot for the string, along with a lower face or slot against which the internal trigger sits. They often also have some form of strengthening internal 'sear' or trigger face, usually of metal. These 'roller nuts' were either free-floating in their close-fitting hole across the stock, tied in with a binding of sinew or other strong cording, or mounted on a metal axle or pins. Removable or integral plates of wood, ivory or metal on the sides of the stock kept the nut in place laterally. Nuts were made of antler, bone, ivory or metal (usually brass). A trigger system, (usually made of iron or steel from medieval times onwards), was used to retain the force of the string in the nut and then release the nut to spin and the string to shoot the bolt. Sophisticated bronze triggers with safety notches are known to have been used on crossbows from ancient China. Complicated iron triggers that could be released with little strength are known in Europe from the early 15th century. As a result crossbows could be kept and ready to shoot for some time with little effort, allowing crossbowmen to aim better.

The bow (called the &quot;prod&quot; or &quot;lath&quot; on a crossbow) of early crossbows was made of a single piece of wood, usually [[Ash tree|ash]] or [[Taxus|yew]]. Composite bows are made from layers of different material—often wood, horn and sinew—glued together and bound with animal tendon. These composite bows, made of several layers, are much stronger and more efficient in releasing energy than simple wooden bows. As steel became more widely available in Europe around the 14th century, steel prods came into use.

The crossbow prod is very short compared to ordinary bows, resulting in a short draw length. This leads to a higher draw weight in order to store the same amount of energy. Furthermore the thick prods are a bit less efficient at releasing energy, but more energy can be stored by a crossbow. Traditionally the prod was often lashed to the stock with rope, [[whipcord]], or other strong cording. This cording is called the ''[[bridle]]''.

The strings for a crossbow are typically made of strong fibers that would not tend to fray. [[Whipcord]] was very common; however linen, [[hemp]], and [[Tendon|sinew]] were used as well. In wet conditions, twisted [[mulberry]] root was occasionally used.

Crossbows have a shorter draw length than bows, resulting in the need of a greater amount of draw force in order to store the same amount of energy. Very light crossbows can be drawn by hand, but heavier types need the help of mechanical devices. The simplest version of mechanical cocking device is a hook attached to a belt, drawing the bow by straightening the legs. Other devices are hinged levers which either pulled or pushed the string into place, cranked rack-and-pinion devices called 'cranequins' and multiple cord-and-pulley cranked devices called [[windlass]]es.

=== Variants ===
[[Image:Recurve crossbow with bolts.jpg|right|thumb|Modern recurve crossbow]]
[[Image:Horton Hunter Supreme by IvE.jpg|right|thumb|Modern compound crossbow]]

Crossbows exist in different variants.  One way to classify them is the acceleration system, while another is the size and energy, degree of automation or projectiles.

The simplest acceleration system is a straight or bent prod and it is probably the earliest version of a crossbow.

A [[recurve bow|recurve]] crossbow is a bow that has tips curving away from the archer. The recurve bow's bent limbs have a longer draw length than an equivalent straight-limbed bow, giving more acceleration to the projectile and less hand shock. Recurved limbs also put greater strain on the materials used to make the bow, and they may make more noise with the shot.

Multiple bow systems have a special system of pulling the sinew via several bows (which can be recurve bows). The workings can be compared to a modern compound bow system. The weapon uses several different bows instead of one bow with a tackle system to achieve a higher acceleration of the sinew via the multiplication with each bow's pulling effect.

A compound crossbow is a modern crossbow and is similar to a [[compound bow]], The limbs are usually much stiffer than those of a recurve crossbow. This limb stiffness makes the compound bow more energy efficient than other bows, but the limbs are too stiff to be drawn comfortably with a string attached directly to them. The compound bow has the string attached to the pulleys, one or both of which has one or more cables attached to the opposite limb. When the string is drawn back, the string causes the pulleys to turn. This causes the pulleys to pull the cables, which in turn causes the limbs to bend and thus store energy. Other types of compound bows use either (one or both) cam shaped or excentrically mounted pulleys in order to provide a &quot;let off&quot;, such that the archer is not holding against the maximum draw weight of the bow while trying to aim.  But in a crossbow the string is held back mechanically, so there is no advantage in providing a let off.  Therefore, compound crossbows generally use only pulleys that are both round and concentrically mounted, in order to capture the maximum available energy from the relatively short draw length.

[[File:HJRK A 108 - Wallarmbrust c. 1460-70.jpg|thumb|15th century ''Wallarmbrust'', a heavy crossbow used for siege defense.]]
The smallest crossbows are pistol crossbows. Others are simple long stocks with the crossbow mounted on them. These could be shot from under the arm. The next step in development was rifle shaped stocks that allowed better aiming. The [[arbalest]] was a heavy crossbow which required special systems for pulling the sinew via windlasses. For [[siege warfare]] the size of crossbows was further increased to hurl large projectiles such as rocks at fortifications. The required crossbows needed a massive base frame and powerful windlass devices. Such devices include the [[oxybeles]]. The [[ballista]] has [[torsion spring]]s replacing the elastic prod of the oxybeles, but later also developed into smaller versions.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell, Robert L. (1989). ''Of Arms and Men: A History of War, Weapons, and Aggression''. [[Oxford University Press]]. ISBN 0-1950-5359-1, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Ballista&quot; is still the [[root (linguistics)|root word]] for crossbow in [[Romance languages]] such as Italian (''balestra'').

The [[repeating crossbow]] automated the separate actions of stringing the bow, placing the projectile and shooting. This way the task can be accomplished with a simple one-handed movement, while keeping the weapon stationary. As a result, it is possible to shoot at a faster rate compared to unmodified version. The Chinese repeating crossbow, [[Chu Ko Nu]], is a handheld crossbow that accomplishes the task with a magazine containing a number of bolts on top. The mechanism is worked by moving a rectangular lever forward and backward. The weapon was mainly used as a weapon against lightly armored soldiers, since it fired small bolts that were often dipped in poison.

A bullet crossbow is a type of handheld crossbow which rather than arrows or bolts shoots spherical projectiles made of stone, clay or lead. There are two variants, one has a double string with a pocket for the projectile; the other has a barrel with a slot for the string.

===Projectiles===

[[Image:CrossbowBolt.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Modern crossbow bolt compared to a 1 [[eurocent]] coin]]

The arrow-like projectiles of a crossbow are called [[bolt (crossbow)|bolt]]s. These are much shorter than arrows, but can be several times heavier. There is an optimum weight for bolts to achieve maximum kinetic energy, which varies depending on the strength and characteristics of the crossbow, but most could pass through common chain mail. In ancient times the bolts of a strong crossbow were usually several times heavier than arrows. Modern bolts are stamped with a proof mark to ensure their consistent weight. Bolts do not have  [[fletching|fletch]]ing, commonly seen on [[arrow|arrow]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foremosthunting.com/Resources/Crossbows/BoltsandArrows/tabid/1087/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Crossbow bolts can be fitted with a variety of heads,  some with sickle-shaped heads to cut rope or rigging; but the most common today is a four-sided point called a [[quarrel]]. A highly specialized type of bolt is employed to collect blubber biopsy samples used in biology research.

Most modern crossbows are however designed to shoot arrows instead of bolts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foremosthunting.com/Resources/Crossbows/BoltsandArrows/tabid/1087/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Crossbow arrows are of similar construction as ordinary bow arrows,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crossbowmen.com/index.htm.arrows.html&lt;/ref&gt; just shorter in length because of reduced power stroke.

Crossbows can also be adapted to shoot lead bullets or stones, in which case they are called '''stone-bows'''. Primarily used for hunting [[Anatidae|wildfowl]], these usually have a double string with a pouch between the strings to hold the projectile.

===Accessories===
[[Image:Crossbow telescopic sight reticle.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The reticle of modern crossbow [[telescopic sight]] often allows the shooter to adjust for different ranges]]

The ancient crossbow often included a metal grid serving as [[iron sights]]. Modern crossbow sights often use similar technology to modern firearm sights such [[red dot sight]]s, and [[telescopic sight]]s. Many crossbow scopes feature multiple [[crosshairs]] to compensate for the significant effects of [[gravity]] over different ranges.

[[Quiver]]s can be mounted to hold ammunition. These are often made from plastic and usually hold the bolts in fixed positions along the structure. A popular detachable design consists of a main arm that is attached to the weapon, a plate on one end that secures four or more individual bolts at a point on their shafts and at the other end a cover that secures their heads. This kind of quiver is attached under the front of the crossbow, parallel to the string and is designed to be quickly detached and reattached. Other designs hold bolts underneath the crossbow parallel to the stock, sometimes on either side of the crossbow.

A major cause of the sound of firing a crossbow is vibration of various components. Crossbow silencers are multiple components placed on high vibration parts such as the string and limbs to dampen vibration and suppress the sound of loosing the bolt.

The earliest textual evidence of the ''handheld'' crossbow [[Battle of Maling|used in battle]] dates to the 4th century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;wright 2001 42&quot;&gt;Wright (2001), 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Handheld crossbows with complex bronze trigger mechanisms have also been found with the [[Terracotta Army]] in the tomb of [[Qin Shihuang]] (r. 221–210 BC) that are similar to specimens from the subsequent [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC–220 AD), while crossbowmen described in the Qin and Han Dynasty learned drill formations, some were even mounted as [[Cavalry#East Asia|cavalry units]], and Han Dynasty writers attributed the success of numerous [[Sino-Xiongnu War|battles against the Xiongnu]] to massed crossbow fire.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 5, Part 6, 124–128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2000a), 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The bronze triggers were designed in such a way that they were able to store a large amount of energy within the bow when drawn, but was easily fired with little recoil when the trigger were pulled (this allowed it for precision shooting). The metal portions of the crossbow were also mass produced with precision, with the bronzer mechanisms being interchangeable. Finally, the Qin and Han Dynasties also developed crossbow firing lines, with alternating rows of crossbowmen firing and reloading similar to a musket firing line.

Different varieties of crossbows were also developed, such as the [[repeating crossbow]], multi-shot crossbow, and repeating multi-shot crossbow.

=== Ancient Greece ===
[[File:Gastraphetes Rekonstruktion Saalburg.jpg|thumb|Greek ''[[gastraphetes]]'']]

The earliest reasonably reliable date for the crossbow in the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] world is from the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Gurstelle, William (2004).''The Art of the Catapult''. Chicago Review Press. ISBN 1-5565-2526-5, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] (fl. 1st century BC), described the invention of a mechanical arrow firing catapult (''katapeltikon'') by a Greek task force in 399 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. Sic. 14.42.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan Campbell, p.3&quot;&gt;Duncan Campbell: ''Greek and Roman Artillery 399 BC-AD 363'', Osprey Publishing, Oxford 2003, ISBN 1841766348, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The weapon was soon after employed against [[Sicilian Wars#The Second Sicilian War (410 BC–340 BC)|Motya]] (397 BC), a key [[Carthaginian]] stronghold in [[Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;Diod. Sic. 14.50.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan Campbell, p.8&quot;&gt;Duncan Campbell: ''Greek and Roman Artillery 399 BC-AD 363'', Osprey Publishing, Oxford 2003, ISBN 1841766348, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Diodorus is assumed to have drawn his description from the highly rated&lt;ref&gt;Eric William Marsden: ''Greek and Roman Artillery: Historical Development'', The Clarendon Press, Oxford 1969, ISBN 978-0198142683, p.48f.&lt;/ref&gt; history of [[Philistus]], a contemporary of the events then.

The date of the introduction of crossbows, however, can be dated further back: According to the inventor [[Hero of Alexandria]] (fl. 1st c. AD), who referred to the now lost works of the 3rd century BC engineer [[Ctesibius]], this weapon was inspired by an earlier hand crossbow, called the ''[[gastraphetes]]'' (''belly shooter''), which could store more energy than the Greek bows. A detailed description of the ''gastraphetes'', along with a drawing, is found in Heron's technical treatise ''Belopoeica''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan Campbell, p.4&quot;&gt;Duncan Campbell: ''Greek and Roman Artillery 399 BC-AD 363'', Osprey Publishing, Oxford 2003, ISBN 1841766348, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley M. Burstein, Walter Donlan, Sarah B. Pomeroy, and Jennifer Tolbert Roberts (1999). ''Ancient Greece: A Political, Social, and Cultural History''. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-1950-9742-4, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt; The ''gastraphetes'' was powered by a composite bow. It was cocked by resting the stomach in a concavity at the rear of the stock and pressing down with all strength. In this way considerably more energy can be summoned up than by using only one arm of the archer as in the hand-bow. The heavy weight and bulk of the ''gastraphetes'' may have necessitated a prop to keep it standing, i.e. by mounting it on a defensive wall or using a portable prop.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2003), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third Greek author, Biton (fl. 2nd c. BC), whose reliability has been positively reevaluated by recent scholarship,&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan Campbell, p.3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.J.T. Lewis: ''When was Biton?'', ''[[Mnemosyne]]'', Vol. 52, No. 2 (1999), pp. 159-168&lt;/ref&gt; described two advanced forms of the ''gastraphetes'', which he credits to [[Zopyrus of Tarentum|Zopyros]], an engineer from [[Taranto|southern Italy]]. Zopyrus has been plausibly equated with a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] of that name who seems to have flourished in the late 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pythagoreanism/ Peter Kingsley: Ancient Philosophy, Mystery and Magic, Clarendon Press, Oxford 1995, p.150ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis established a lower date of no later than the mid-fourth century (M.J.T. Lewis: ''When was Biton?'', ''[[Mnemosyne]]'', Vol. 52, No. 2 (1999), pp. 159-168 (160)). Same de Camp (L. Sprague de Camp: ''Master Gunner Apollonios'', ''[[Technology and Culture]]'', Vol. 2, No. 3 (1961), pp. 240-244 (241)&lt;/ref&gt; He probably designed his bow-machines on the occasion of the sieges of [[Cumae]] and [[Milet]] between 421 BC and 401 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Biton Biton 65.1-67.4 &amp; 61.12-65.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan Campbell, p.5&quot;&gt;Duncan Campbell: ''Greek and Roman Artillery 399 BC-AD 363'', Osprey Publishing, Oxford 2003, ISBN 1841766348, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The bows of these machines already featured a winched pull back system and could apparently throw two missiles at once.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan Campbell, p.8&quot;/&gt;

From the mid-fourth century BC onwards, evidence of the Greek use of crossbows becomes more dense and varied: Arrow firing machines (''katapeltai'') are briefly mentioned by [[Aeneas Tacticus]] in his treatise on siegecraft written around 350 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan Campbell, p.8&quot;/&gt; An Athenian inventory from 330-329 BC includes catapults bolts with heads and flights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eric William Marsden, p.57&quot;/&gt; Arrow firing machines in action are reported from [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]'s siege of [[Perinthos]] in [[Thrace]] in 340 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eric William Marsden, p.60&quot;&gt;Eric William Marsden: ''Greek and Roman Artillery: Historical Development'', The Clarendon Press, Oxford 1969, ISBN 978-0198142683, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Greek fortifications began to feature high towers with shuttered windows in the top, presumably to house anti-personnel arrow shooters, as in [[Aigosthena]].&lt;ref&gt;Josiah Ober: ''Early Artillery Towers: Messenia, Boiotia, Attica, Megarid'', ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 91, No. 4. (1987), S. 569-604 (569)&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition to the [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] [[catapult]]s, which are not considered crossbows and came to dominate Greek and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] artillery design is first evident in inventories of the [[Athens|Athenian]] arsenal from between 338 and 326 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan Campbell, p.8&quot;&gt;Duncan Campbell: ''Greek and Roman Artillery 399 BC-AD 363'', Osprey Publishing, Oxford 2003, ISBN 1841766348, p.8ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eric William Marsden, p.57&quot;&gt;Eric William Marsden: ''Greek and Roman Artillery: Historical Development'', The Clarendon Press, Oxford 1969, ISBN 978-0198142683, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Torsion weapon]]s, which rely on the energy generated from twisted animal [[sinew]] became siege weapons and light artillery - such as the Greek [[ballista]] or the Roman [[Scorpio (dart-thrower)|scorpion]].

In Roman times the crossbow became to be known as [[arcuballista]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dictionnaire: Arcuballista, Manuballista&quot;&gt;Dictionnaire des antiquites grecques et romaines: [http://dagr.univ-tlse2.fr/sdx/dagr/feuilleter.xsp?tome=1&amp;partie=1&amp;numPage=400&amp;filtre=arbal%C3%A8te%20&amp;nomEntree=ARCUBALLISTA Arcuballista, Manuballista]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baatz 1994, 284–293&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Baatz|1994|pp=284–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman Empire ===
 

Besides the ''gastraphetes'', the ancient world knew a variety of mechanical hand-held weapons similar to the later [[Middle Ages|medieval]] crossbow. The exact terminology is a subject of continuing scholarly debate.
Greek and Roman authors like [[Vegetius]] (fl. 4th century) note repeatedly the use of arrow firing weapons such as ''arcuballista'' and ''manuballista'' respectively ''cheiroballistra''. While most scholars agree that one or more of these terms refer to handheld mechanical weapons, there exist disagreement whether these were flexion bows or torsion powered like the recent [[Xanten]] find.&lt;ref&gt;Romanhideout.com: [http://www.romanhideout.com/news/2005/20050224.asp Manuballista found near Xanten]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] commander [[Arrian]] (ca. 86 - after 146) records in his ''Tactica'' Roman cavalry training for firing some mechanical handheld weapon from horseback.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]] Tact. 43.1; {{harvnb|Baatz|1999|pp=11–15}}; {{harvnb|Campbell|1986|pp=117–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sculptural reliefs from [[Roman Gaul]] depict the use of crossbows in hunting scenes. The specimen are remarkably similar to the later medieval crossbow, including the typical nut lock (see image).&lt;ref&gt;Dictionnaire des antiquites grecques et romaines: [http://dagr.univ-tlse2.fr/sdx/dagr/feuilleter.xsp?tome=1&amp;partie=1&amp;numPage=400&amp;filtre=arbal%C3%A8te%20&amp;nomEntree=ARCUBALLISTA Arcuballista, Manuballista]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval Europe ===

The use of crossbows in European warfare dates back to Roman times and is again evident from the [[Battle of Hastings]] until about 1500 AD. They almost completely superseded hand bows in many European armies in the twelfth century for a number of reasons. Although a [[longbow]] achieves comparable accuracy and faster shooting rate than an average crossbow, crossbows release more kinetic energy and can be used effectively after a week of training, while a comparable single-shot skill with a longbow takes years of strength training to overcome the draw strength of the longbow, as well as years of practice needed to use it with skill.

In the armies of Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Verbruggen | first = J.F | coauthors = Second revised and enlarged, edition, in English translation | year = 1997 | title = The art of warfare in Western Europe during the Middle Ages | publisher=Boydell&amp;Brewer | isbn =0-85115-570-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; mounted and unmounted crossbowmen, often mixed with javeliners and archers, occupied a central position in battle formations. Usually they engaged the enemy in offensive skirmishes before an assault of mounted [[knight]]s. Crossbowmen were also valuable in counterattacks to protect their infantry. The rank of commanding officer of the crossbowmen corps was one of the highest positions in any army of this time. Along with [[Pole weapon|polearm]] weapons made from farming equipment, the crossbow was also a weapon of choice for insurgent peasants such as the [[Taborite]]s.

Mounted knights armed with lances proved ineffective against formations of [[pike (weapon)|pike]]men combined with crossbowmen whose weapons could penetrate most knights' armor. The invention of pushlever and ratchet drawing mechanisms enabled the use of crossbows on horseback, leading to the development of new [[cavalry tactics]]. Knights and mercenaries deployed in triangular formations, with the most heavily armored knights at the front. Some of these riders would carry small, powerful all-metal crossbows of their own. Crossbows were eventually replaced in warfare by more powerful [[gunpowder]] weapons, although early guns had slower rates of fire and much worse accuracy than contemporary crossbows. Later, similar competing tactics would feature [[arquebus|harquebusiers]] or [[musket]]eers in formation with pikemen, pitted against cavalry firing [[pistol]]s or [[carbine]]s.

The [[Saracen]]s called the crossbow ''qaws Ferengi'', or &quot;Frankish bow,&quot; as the Crusaders used the crossbow against the Arab and Turkoman horsemen with remarkable success. The adapted crossbow was used by the Islamic armies in defence of their castles. Later footstrapped version become very popular among the Muslim armies in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]. During the [[Crusades]], Europeans were exposed to Saracen [[composite bow]]s, made from layers of different material—often wood, horn and sinew—glued together and bound with animal tendon. These composite bows could be much more powerful than wooden bows, and were adopted for crossbow prods across Europe.

In Western Africa and Central Africa,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photographersdirect.com/buyers/stockphoto.asp?imageid=348455 Baaka pygmy with crossbow]&lt;/ref&gt; crossbows served as a scouting weapon and for hunting, with enslaved Africans bringing the technology to America.&lt;ref name = &quot;cvplxd&quot;&gt;[http://www.diaspora.uiuc.edu/A-AAnewsletter/newsletter16.html Notes On West African Crossbow Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; In the American south, the crossbow was used for hunting when firearms or gunpowder were unavailable because of economic hardships or isolation.&lt;ref name = &quot;cvplxd&quot;/&gt; Light hunting crossbows were traditionally used by the [[Inuit]] in Northern America. The native Montagnards of Vietnam's Central Highlands were also known to have used crossbows, as both a tool for hunting, and later, an effective weapon against the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War. Montagnard fighters armed with crossbows proved a highly valuable asset to the US Special Forces operating in Vietnam, and it was not uncommon for the Green Berets to integrate Montagnard crossbowmen into their strike teams.

Crossbows are used for [[target shooting]] and [[bowhunting]] in modern [[archery]] and for [[blubber]] [[biopsy]] samples in scientific research.

=== Modern military and paramilitary use ===
In the Americas, the [[Peruvian]] army (Ejército) equips some soldiers with crossbows and rope, to establish a [[zip-line]] in difficult terrain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saorbats.com.ar/GaleriaSaorbats/Peruffaa04/images/b2aBriFFEE2_EP_jpg.jpg Ejercito prepare for deployment.]&lt;/ref&gt; In Brazil the CIGS (Jungle Warfare Training Center) also trains soldiers in the use of crossbows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?t=23940 CIGS information thread].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.segurancaedefesa.com/Besta.jpg CIGS photograph].&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, SAA International Ltd manufacture a 150&amp;nbsp;ft/lb crossbow-launched version of the U.S. Army type classified Launched [[Grappling hook|Grappel Hook]] (LGH), amongst other mine countermeasure solutions designed for the middle-eastern theatre.

In Europe, British based Barnett International supplied crossbows to [[Serbs|Serbian]] forces which according to [[The Guardian]] were later used &quot;in [[ambushes]] and as a counter-sniper weapon&quot;, against the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] during the [[Kosovo War]] in the areas of Pec and Djakovica, south west of Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/1999/aug/09/balkans  The Guardian].&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehall launched an investigation, though the department of trade and industry established that not being &quot;on the military list&quot; crossbows were not covered by such export regulations. Paul Beaver of Jane's defence publications commented that, &quot;They are not only a silent killer, they also have a psychological effect&quot;. On 15 February 2008 Serbian Minister of Defence [[Dragan Sutanovac]] was pictured testing a Barnett crossbow during a public exercise of the Serbian army's Special Forces in Nis, 200&amp;nbsp;km south of capital [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daylife.com/photo/04ZU4Zr0xS4IA Day Life Serbia report]&lt;/ref&gt; Special forces in both Greece and [[Turkey]] also continue to employ the crossbow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i96.photobucket.com/albums/l189/KORNET-E/162.jpg Greek soldiers uses crossbow].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://i96.photobucket.com/albums/l189/KORNET-E/crosbow.jpg Turkish special ops].&lt;/ref&gt; Spain's Green Berets still use the crossbow as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boinasverdes.org/album/bataller/caperez/foto03.JPG Spanish Green Beret 2005 photo].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, Chinese armed forces use crossbows at all unit levels from traffic police to the [[special force]] [[Snow Leopard Commando Unit]] of the [[People's Armed Police]] and the [[People's Liberation Army]]. One justification for this comes in the crossbow's ability to stop persons carrying explosives without risk of causing detonation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.pladaily.com.cn/site2/militarydatabase/2006-02/05/content_403376.htm PLA Daily reports on the 3rd Detachment of the Armed Police Yunnan Contingen's crossbow special service unit]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, during the Xinjiang riots of July 2009, crossbows were used alongside modern military hardware to quell protestors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/5780852/Xinjiang-riots-Modern-Chinese-army-displays-ancient-preference-for-crossbow.html Telegraph reports on Xinjiang riots]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indian Navy]]'s [[Marine Commando Force]] were equipped until the late 1980s with crossbows supplied with [[cyanide]]-tipped arrows, as an alternative to [[suppressor|suppressed]] [[handgun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/Marines.html Marine Commandos[dead link]&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison to conventional bows ==
With a crossbow, archers could release a draw force far in excess of what they could have handled with a bow. The disadvantage is the greater weight and clumsiness compared to a bow, as well as the slower rate of fire and the lower efficiency of the acceleration system, but there would be reduced elastic hysteresis, making the crossbow a more accurate weapon.

Crossbows have a much smaller draw length than bows. This means that for the same energy to be imparted to the arrow (or bolt) the crossbow has to have a much higher draw weight.
A direct comparison between a fast hand-drawn replica crossbow and a longbow show a 6:10 rate of fire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HagCuGXJgUs&amp;feature=grec_index Video comparing longbow and crossbow] Retrieved 16-9-2010&lt;/ref&gt; Or a 4:9 rate within 30 seconds and comparable weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g-0-RK3cjk longbow vs crossbow behind a pavese] Retrieved 16-9-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
[[Image:Armbrustschiessen.jpg|thumb|right|Modern crossbow]]
{{Main|Laws on crossbows}}

Can. 29 of the [[Second Lateran Council]] under [[Pope Innocent II]] in 1139 may have banned the use of crossbows against Christians.&lt;ref&gt;The sources are collected in Hefele, Histoire des conciles d'apres les documents originaux, trans. and continued by H. Leclerq 1907-52., 5/1, 721-722; but see also, Bernhardi Jahrbuecher der deutschen Geschichte, I Leipzig 1883, 154-160: {{Citation |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran2.html |title=Tenth Ecumenical Council: Lateran II 1139 |accessdate=2007-05-05 |date=1996-11-01 |publisher=Internet Medieval Source Book }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authenticity, interpretation and translation of this source is contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Turner | first = Monte | year = 2004 | title = The Not So Diabolical Crossbow: A Re-Examination of Innocent II’s Supposed Ban Of The Crossbow at the Second Lateran Council | publisher=Self-published thesis }}&lt;/ref&gt; Military historian K.C. Eyre suggested in an unpublished paper that the more probable explanation was a ban on [[William Tell]]-like marksmanship demonstrations, in which people would shoot apples off heads, and so on. Given the high-risk nature of this sport, it is easy to see why the Church might discourage it. Given the generally nasty nature of conflict at the time, and the proliferation of ballistic, blunt and edged weapons in use, it is harder to see why the Church would have singled out the crossbow in particular as unsuitable.

Today the crossbow often has a complicated legal status due to the possibility of lethal use and its similarities with both firearms and archery weapons.  Within the United States, regulations vary by state.  Hunting is allowed in some states by persons with physical limitations that causes them to be unable to draw a conventional bow.  In general, hunting regulations are being progressively relaxed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

'''Carbamazepine''' ('''CBZ''') is an [[anticonvulsant]] and [[mood stabilizer|mood stabilizing]] drug used primarily in the treatment of [[epilepsy]] and [[bipolar disorder]], as well as [[trigeminal neuralgia]]. It is also used [[off-label use|off-label]] for a variety of indications, including [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[schizophrenia]], [[phantom limb]] syndrome, [[complex regional pain syndrome]], [[paroxysmal extreme pain disorder]], [[neuromyotonia]], [[intermittent explosive disorder]], and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. 

It has been seen as safe for pregnant women to use carbamazepine as a mood stabilizer,
&lt;ref&gt;Gelder, M., Mayou, R. and Geddes, J. 2005. Psychiatry. 3rd ed. New York: Oxford. pp250.&lt;/ref&gt; but, like other anticonvulsants, intrauterine exposure is associated with spina bifida&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jentink|first=J|coauthors=Dolk, H, Loane, MA, Morris, JK, Wellesley, D, Garne, E, de Jong-van den Berg, L, EUROCAT Antiepileptic Study Working, Group|title=Intrauterine exposure to carbamazepine and specific congenital malformations: systematic review and case-control study.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=2010-12-02|volume=341|pages=c6581|doi=doi: 10.1136/bmj.c6581.|pmid=21127116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and neurodevelopmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cummings|first=C|coauthors=Stewart, M, Stevenson, M, Morrow, J, Nelson, J|title=Neurodevelopment of children exposed in utero to lamotrigine, sodium valproate and carbamazepine.|journal=Archives of disease in childhood|date=2011-03-17|pmid=21415043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Carbamazepine was discovered by chemist Walter Schindler at J.R. Geigy AG (now part of [[Novartis]]) in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schindler W, Häfliger F |title=Über Derivate des Iminodibenzyls |journal=[[Helvetica Chimica Acta]] |year=1954 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=472–83. |doi=10.1002/hlca.19540370211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schindler then synthesized the drug in 1960, before its anti-epileptic properties had been discovered.

Carbamazepine was first marketed as a drug to treat [[trigeminal neuralgia]] (formerly known as tic douloureux) in 1962. It has been used as an anticonvulsant in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] since 1965, and has been approved in the [[United States|U.S.]] since 1974.

In 1971, Drs. Takezaki and Hanaoka first used carbamazepine to control mania in patients refractory to antipsychotics ([[Lithium pharmacology|Lithium]] was not available in Japan at that time). Dr. Okuma, working independently, did the same thing with success. As they were also epileptologists, they had some familiarity with the anti-aggression effects of this drug. Carbamazepine would be studied for bipolar disorder throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9682927&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Okuma T, Kishimoto A |title=A history of investigation on the mood stabilizing effect of carbamazepine in Japan |journal=Psychiatry Clin. Neurosci. |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=3–12 |year=1998 |month=February |pmid=9682927 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.1998.tb00966.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indications==
In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]-approved indications for carbamazepine use are [[epilepsy]] (including [[partial seizure]]s and [[tonic-clonic seizure]]s), [[trigeminal neuralgia]], and [[mania|manic]] and [[mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed episodes]] of [[bipolar I disorder]].&lt;ref name=Lexi-Comp/&gt; Although data is still lacking, carbamazepine appears to be as effective and safe as [[lithium pharmacology|lithium]] for the treatment of bipolar disorder, both in the acute and maintenance phase.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ceron-Litvoc&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ceron-Litvoc D, Soares BG, Geddes J, Litvoc J, de Lima MS |title=Comparison of carbamazepine and lithium in treatment of bipolar disorder: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials |journal=Hum Psychopharmacol |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=19–28 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19053079 |doi=10.1002/hup.990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade names/Brand names==

Carbamazepine has been sold under the names Biston, Calepsin, Carbatrol, Epitol, Equetro, Finlepsin, Sirtal, Stazepine, Telesmin, Tegretol ([[UK]] and [[Australia]]), Teril, Timonil, Trimonil, Epimaz, Carbama/Carbamaze ([[New Zealand]]), Amizepin ([[Poland]]), Karbapin ([[Serbia]]), Hermolepsin ([[Sweden]]), Degranol ([[South Africa]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intekom.com/pharm/lennon/degranol.html Degranol Tablets] {{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Tegretal ([[Chile]])&lt;ref&gt;http://www.farmaciasahumada.cl/fasaonline/fasa/MFT/PRODUCTO/P1163.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Pharmacokinetics==

Carbamazepine exhibits autoinduction: it [[regulation of gene expression|induces]] the expression of the hepatic microsomal enzyme system [[CYP3A4]], which metabolizes carbamazepine itself. Upon initiation of carbamazepine therapy, concentrations are predictable and follow their respective baseline clearance/half-life values that have been established for the specific patient. However, after enough carbamazepine has been presented to the liver tissue, the CYP3A4 activity increases, speeding up drug clearance and shortening the half-life. Autoinduction will continue with subsequent increases in dose but will usually reach a plateau within 5–7 days of a maintenance dose. Increases in dose at a rate of 200&amp;nbsp;mg every 1–2 weeks may be required to achieve a stable seizure threshold. Stable carbamazepine concentrations occur usually within 2–3 weeks after initiation of therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bauer |first=Larry A. |title=[[Applied Clinical Pharmacokinetics]] |edition=2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; |year=2008 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|isbn=978-0-8385-0388-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism of action ==

The mechanism of action of carbamazepine and its derivatives is relatively well understood. [[Voltage-gated sodium channel]]s are the molecular pores that allow brain cells ([[neuron]]s) to generate [[action potential]]s, the electrical events that allow [[neuron]]s to communicate over long distances. After the sodium channels open to start the action potential, they inactivate, essentially closing the channel. Carbamazepine stabilizes the inactivated state of sodium channels, meaning that fewer of these channels are available to subsequently open, making brain cells less excitable (less likely to fire).
Carbamazepine has also been shown to potentiate GABA receptors made up of alpha1, beta2, gamma2 subunits.&lt;ref&gt;Granger, P. et al.  Modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor by the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and phenytoin. Mol. Pharmacol. 47, 1189–1196 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interactions ==

Carbamazepine has a very high potential for [[drug interaction]]s; caution should be used in combining other medicines with it, including other antiepileptics and mood stabilizers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lexi-Comp&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/lexicomp/carbamazepine.html |title=Carbamazepine |date=February 2009 |author=Lexi-Comp |work=[[Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy|The Merck Manual Professional]]|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKvOP99i |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}} Retrieved on May 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Lower levels of carbamazepine are seen when administrated with [[phenobarbital]], [[phenytoin]] (Dilantin), or [[primidone]] (Mysoline).
Carbamazepine, as a [[CYP450]] inducer, may increase clearance of many drugs, decreasing their blood levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;urleMedicine - Toxicity, Carbamazepine&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic77.htm |title=eMedicine - Toxicity, Carbamazepine |work= |accessdate=|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5ZpbVBsOJ |archivedate = 2008-08-04|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs that are more rapidly metabolized with carbamazepine include [[warfarin]] (Coumadin), phenytoin (Dilantin), [[theophylline]], and [[valproic acid]] (Depakote, Depakote ER, Depakene, Depacon).&lt;ref name=Lexi-Comp/&gt; Drugs that decrease the metabolism of carbamazepine or otherwise increase its levels include [[erythromycin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stafstrom CE, Nohria V, Loganbill H, Nahouraii R, Boustany RM, DeLong GR |title=Erythromycin-induced carbamazepine toxicity: a continuing problem |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=149 |issue=1 |pages=99–101 |year=1995 |month=January |pmid=7827672 |doi= |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7827672|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKvQB98w |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cimetidine]] (Tagamet), [[propoxyphene]] (Darvon), and [[calcium channel blocker]]s.&lt;ref name=Lexi-Comp/&gt; Carbamazepine also increases the metabolism of the hormones in [[birth control pill]]s and can reduce their effectiveness, potentially leading to unexpected pregnancies.&lt;ref name=Lexi-Comp/&gt;

[[Valproic acid]] and [[valnoctamide]] both inhibit [[epoxide hydrolase|microsomal epoxide hydrolase]] (mEH), the [[enzyme]] responsible for the breakdown of carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide into inactive metabolites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gonzalez |first=Frank J. |coauthors=Robert H. Tukey |editor=Laurence Brunton, John Lazo, Keith Parker (eds.) |title=[[Goodman &amp; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics]] |edition=11th |year=2006 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-142280-2|page=79 |chapter=Drug Metabolism }}&lt;/ref&gt; By inhibiting mEH, valproic acid and valnoctamide cause a buildup of the active metabolite, prolonging the effects of carbamazepine and delaying its excretion.

Grapefruit juice raises the bioavailability of carbamazepine by inhibiting CYP3A4 enzymes in the gut wall and in the liver.

== Adverse effects ==

Common [[adverse drug reaction|adverse effects]] include drowsiness, headaches and migraines, [[motor coordination]] impairment and/or upset stomach. Carbamazepine preparations typically greatly decrease a person's alcohol tolerance.

Less common side effects include cardiac arrhythmias, blurry or double [[Visual perception|vision]] and/or the temporary loss of [[blood cell]]s or [[platelet]]s and in rare cases can cause aplastic anemia. With normal use, small reductions in white cell count and serum sodium are common; however, in rare cases, the loss of platelets may become life-threatening. This occurs commonly enough that a doctor may recommend frequent blood tests during the first few months of use, followed by three to four tests per year for established patients. In the UK, testing is generally performed much less frequently for long-term carbamazepine patients—typically once per year. {{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Additionally, carbamazepine may exacerbate preexisting cases of hypothyroidism, so yearly thyroid function tests are advisable for persons taking the drug.

There are also reports of an auditory side effect for carbamazepine use, whereby patients perceive sounds about a [[semitone]] lower than previously.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12581810&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yoshikawa H, Abe T |title=Carbamazepine-induced abnormal pitch perception |journal=Brain Dev. |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=127–9 |year=2003 |month=March |pmid=12581810 |doi= 10.1016/S0387-7604(02)00155-9|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0387760402001559}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14518681&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Konno S, Yamazaki E, Kudoh M, Abe T, Tohgi H |title=Half pitch lower sound perception caused by carbamazepine |journal=Intern.

Carbamazepine increases the risk of developing lupus by 1.88.&lt;ref&gt;Schoonen WM et. al.,Do selected drugs increase the risk of lupus? A matched case-control study. Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2010 Oct;70(4):588-96. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2010.03733.x.
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oxcarbazepine]], a derivative of carbamazepine, reportedly has fewer and less serious side effects.

Carbamazepine may cause [[Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone]] (SIADH), since it both increases the release and potentiates the action of ADH ([[vasopressin]]).

Carbamazepine may aggravate [[juvenile myoclonic epilepsy]], so it is important to uncover any history of jerking, especially in the morning, before starting the drug.

In addition, carbamazepine has been linked to serious adverse cognitive anomalies, including EEG slowing&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12027908&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Salinsky MC, Binder LM, Oken BS, Storzbach D, Aron CR, Dodrill CB |title=Effects of gabapentin and carbamazepine on the EEG and cognition in healthy volunteers |journal=Epilepsia |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=482–90 |year=2002 |pmid=12027908 |doi=10.1046/j.1528-1157.2002.22501.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1528-1157.2002.22501.x?cookieSet=1|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKvX3m5E |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cell apoptosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8719616&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gao XM, Margolis RL, Leeds P, Hough C, Post RM, Chuang DM |title=Carbamazepine induction of apoptosis in cultured cerebellar neurons: effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate, aurintricarboxylic acid and cycloheximide |journal=Brain Res. |volume=703 |issue=1-2 |pages=63–71 |year=1995 |pmid=8719616 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(95)01066-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA informed health care professionals that dangerous or even fatal skin reactions ([[Stevens Johnson syndrome]] and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]]), that can be caused by carbamazepine therapy, are significantly more common in patients with a particular [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) allele, [[HLA-B75|HLA-B*1502]]. This allele occurs almost exclusively in patients with ancestry across broad areas of Asia, including South Asian Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=MedWatch |title=Carbamazepine  |url=http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2007/safety07.htm#carbamazepine |date=2007-12-12 |work=2007 Safety Alerts for Drugs, Biologics, Medical Devices, and Dietary Supplements |publisher=FDA|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKvY37EY |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europeans a large proportion of sensitivity is associated with [[HLA-B58]].

The '''Confession of Chalcedon''' (also '''Definition''' or '''Creed of Chalcedon'''), also known as the &quot;Doctrine of the Hypostatic Union&quot; {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} or the &quot;Two-Nature Doctrine&quot;, was adopted at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 in [[Early centers of Christianity#Western Anatolia|Asia Minor]]. That Council of Chalcedon is one of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils]] accepted by [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Catholic]], and many [[Protestant]] Christian churches.  It is the first Council ''not'' recognized by any of the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] churches.

==Oriental Orthodox dissent==

The Chalcedonian creed was written amid controversy between the western and eastern churches over the meaning of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] (see [[Christology]]), the ecclesiastical influence of the [[Byzantine emperor|emperor]], and the supremacy of the Bishop of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]]. The western churches readily accepted the creed, but some eastern churches did not.

The creed became standard orthodox doctrine, while the [[Coptic Church of Alexandria]] dissented, holding to [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]]'s formula of the oneness of Christ’s nature as the incarnation of God the Word. This church felt that this understanding required that the creed should have stated that Christ be acknowledged &quot;'''from''' two natures&quot; rather than &quot;'''in''' two natures&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} 

This [[Miaphysitism|miaphysite]] position, often known as &quot;[[Monophysitism]]&quot;, formed the basis for the distinction from other churches of the Coptic Church of Egypt and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopia]] and the &quot;[[Jacobite Orthodox Church|Jacobite]]&quot; churches of [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syria]] and [[Armenian Orthodox Church|Armenia]] (see [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]). Over the last 30 years, however, the miaphysite position has been accepted as a mere restatement of orthodox belief by [[Patriarch Bartholomew I]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and by [[Pope]] [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

In [[physics]], a '''conservation law''' states that a particular measurable property of an isolated [[physical system]] does not change as the system evolves. 

One particularly important physical result concerning conservation laws is [[Noether's Theorem]], which states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between conservation laws and differentiable [[symmetry in physics|symmetries of physical systems]].  For example, the conservation of energy follows from the time-invariance of physical systems, and the fact that physical systems behave the same regardless of how they are oriented in space gives rise to the conservation of angular momentum.

A partial listing of conservation laws that are said to be '''exact laws''', or more precisely ''have never been shown to be violated:''
* [[Conservation of mass-energy]]
* [[Momentum#Conservation of linear momentum|Conservation of linear momentum]]
* [[Angular momentum#Conservation of angular momentum|Conservation of angular momentum]]
* [[charge conservation|Conservation of electric charge]]
* Conservation of [[color charge]]
* Conservation of [[weak isospin]]
* [[Probability current|Conservation of probability density]]
* [[CPT symmetry]] (combining charge, parity and time conjugation)
* [[Lorentz symmetry]]

There are also '''approximate''' conservation laws.  These are approximately true in particular situations, such as low speeds, short time scales, or certain interactions.  

* [[Conservation of mass]] (applies for non-relativistic speeds and when there are no [[nuclear reaction]]s)
* Conservation of [[baryon number]] (See [[chiral anomaly]])
* Conservation of [[lepton number]] (In the [[Standard Model]])
* Conservation of [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]] (violated by the [[weak interaction]])
* Conservation of [[parity (physics)|parity]]
* Invariance under [[Charge conjugation]]
* Invariance under [[T-symmetry|time reversal]]
* [[CP symmetry]], the combination of charge and parity conjugation (equivalent to time reversal if CPT holds)

'''''Car Talk'''''  is a [[Talk radio|radio talk show]] broadcast weekly on [[National Public Radio]] stations throughout the United States and elsewhere. Its subjects are automobiles and repair, and it often takes humorous turns. The hosts of Car Talk are brothers [[Tom Magliozzi|Tom]] and [[Ray Magliozzi]], also known as ''Click and Clack, the [[Tappet]] Brothers''.

==Show==
''Car Talk'' is structured as a call-in radio show: listeners call with questions related to motor vehicle maintenance and repair. Most of the advice sought is diagnostic, with callers describing symptoms and demonstrating sounds of an ailing vehicle while the Magliozzis make an attempt at identifying the malfunction. While the hosts pepper their call-in sessions with jokes directed at both the caller and at themselves, the depth and breadth of their knowledge of automobiles is extensive, and they are usually able to arrive at a diagnosis and give helpful advice. Also, if a caller has an unusual name, they will inquire about the spelling, pronunciation, and/or origin of their name. They may also comment about the caller's hometown. The Magliozzis previously took a break at approximately the half-hour mark of the show. More recently, two breaks divide the show into approximately 20-minute segments referred to as the &quot;three halves&quot; of the show. Between segments a piece of music related to cars will play.

''Car Talk'' was first broadcast on [[WBUR]] in [[Boston]] in 1977. It was picked up nationally by NPR ten years later. NPR reports that it is heard on more than 370 stations by an audience of more than four million weekly listeners. The show is also carried on [[Sirius XM Satellite Radio]] via both the NPR Now and NPR Talk channels. These two NPR stations rebroadcast the show throughout the weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sirius.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Sirius/Page&amp;c=Channel&amp;cid=1102975192871&amp;s=sched | title=Sirius XM's NPR Talk Schedule | publisher=Sirius XM Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sirius.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Sirius/Page&amp;c=Channel&amp;cid=1102975192867&amp;s=sched | title=Sirius XM's NPR Now Schedule | publisher=Sirius XM Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors=

The show was the inspiration for the short-lived ''[[The George Wendt Show]]'', which aired on CBS in the 1995-96 season.&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/george-wendt/201634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, the program, which had only previously been available digitally as a paid subscription from [[Audible.com]], became a free [[podcast]] distributed by NPR, after a two-month test period where only a &quot;call of the week&quot; was available via podcast.

The ''Car Talk'' [[theme song]] is &quot;Dawggy Mountain Breakdown&quot; by [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] artist [[David Grisman]].

===Call-in procedure===
Throughout the program, listeners are encouraged to dial the [[toll-free telephone number]], 1-888-CAR-TALK (1-888-227-8255), which connects to a 24-hour answering service. Although the approximately 2,000 queries received each week are screened by the ''Car Talk'' staff, the questions are unknown to the Magliozzis in advance as &quot;that would entail researching the right answer, which is what? ...Work.&quot;&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/faq/faq-straight.html | title=Car Talk Official FAQs | publisher=Car Talk | accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Producers select and contact the callers several days ahead of the show's Wednesday taping to arrange the segment. The caller speaks briefly to a producer before being connected live with the hosts, and is given little coaching other than being told to be prepared to talk, not to use any written preparation and to &quot;have fun&quot;. The show deliberately tapes more callers than they have time to air each week in order to be able to choose the best ones for broadcast.  Those segments that do make it to air are generally edited for time.

===Features===
The show opens with a short comedy segment, typically jokes sent in by listeners, followed by eight call-in sessions. The hosts run a contest called the &quot;Puzzler,&quot; in which a riddle, sometimes car related, is presented. The answer to the previous week's &quot;Puzzler&quot; is given at the beginning of the &quot;second half&quot; of the show, and a new puzzler is given at the start of the &quot;third half.&quot; The hosts give instructions to listeners to write answers addressed to &quot;Puzzler Tower&quot; on some non-existent or expensive object, such as a 26-dollar bill or an advanced digital [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] camera. This gag initially started as suggesting that the answers be written &quot;on the back of a twenty dollar bill.&quot; A [[running gag]] concerns Tom's inability to remember the previous week's Puzzler without heavy prompting from Ray. For each puzzler, one correct answer is chosen at random, with the winner receiving a $26 gift certificate to the Car Talk store, referred to as the &quot;Shameless Commerce Division.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzler/&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally $25, but was increased for inflation after a few years.
A recurring feature is &quot;Stump the Chumps&quot;, in which they revisit a caller from a previous show to determine the effect, if any, of their advice. A similar feature began in May 2001, &quot;Where Are They Now, Tommy?&quot;

{{anchor|famous_callers}} Celebrities have been callers as well. Examples include [[Geena Davis]], [[Morley Safer]], [[Ashley Judd]], [[Gordon Elliott]], former Major League pitcher [[Bill Lee (left-handed pitcher)|Bill Lee]] and astronaut [[John Grunsfeld]] calling from the [[Space Shuttle]].
There have been numerous appearances from NPR personalities, including [[Bob Edwards]], [[Susan Stamberg]], [[Scott Simon]], [[Ray Suarez]], [[Will Shortz]], [[Sylvia Poggioli]], and commentator and author [[Daniel Pinkwater]]. On one occasion, the show featured [[Martha Stewart]] as an in-studio guest, whom the Magliozzis twice during the segment referred to as &quot;Margaret&quot;.

In addition to at least one on-orbit call, the Brothers once received a call asking advice on winterizing a couple of &quot;kit cars,&quot; After much beating around the bush and increasing evasiveness by the caller, they asked him just how much these kit cars were worth. The answer: about $800 million. It was a joke call from the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] concerning the preparation of the [[Mars Rover]]s (''[[Spirit rover|Spirit]]'' and ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]'') for the oncoming Martian winter{{cn|date=March 2011}}. Click and Clack have also been featured in editorial cartoons, including one where a befuddled NASA engineer calls them to ask how to fix the [[Space Shuttle]]{{cn|date=March 2011}}.

===Humor===
Leading into each break in the show, one of the hosts leads up to the network identification with a humorous take on a disgusted reaction of some usually famous person to hearing that identification.  The full line goes along the pattern of, for example, &quot;And even though [[Roger Clemens]] stabs his radio with a syringe whenever he hears ''us'' say it, this is NPR: National Public Radio.&quot;

Humor and wisecracking pervade the program. The end credits feature a rotating list of puns and wordplay.&lt;ref name=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/about/credits/credits.html | title=Car Talk Credits | publisher=Car Talk | accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some point in almost every show, usually when giving the address for the Puzzler answers, Ray will mention [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] (where the show originates) at which point Tom reverently interjects &quot;our fair city.&quot;  

They are known for their [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating humor]], often joking about the supposedly poor quality of their advice. They also comment at the end of each show: &quot;Well, it's happened again - you've squandered another perfectly good hour listening to ''Car Talk''.&quot;

The ending credits of the show start with the colorfully nicknamed actual staffers (notably producer &quot;Doug the subway fugitive, not a slave to fashion, bongo boy frogman Berman&quot; and &quot;John 'Bugsy' Lawlor, just back from the...&quot; every week a different eating event with rhyming foodstuff names), but soon turn into a lengthy list of pun-filled fictional staffers and sponsors such as statistician Marge Innovera (&quot;[[margin of error]]&quot;), customer care representative Haywood Jabuzoff (&quot;Hey, would you buzz off&quot;) meteorologist Claudio Vernight (&quot;cloudy overnight&quot;), optometric firm C.F. Eye Care (&quot;see if I care&quot;), Russian chauffeur Pikop Andropov (&quot;pick up and drop off&quot;), and law firm Dewey, Cheetham and Howe (&quot;Do we cheat 'em and how&quot;).

At the end of the show, Ray warns the audience, &quot;Don't drive like my brother,&quot; to which Tom replies, &quot;And don't drive like ''my'' brother.&quot;  The original tag line was &quot;Don't drive like a knucklehead.&quot;  There have been variations such as, &quot;Don't drive like my brother...&quot; &quot;And don't drive like his brother,&quot; and &quot;Don't drive like my sister...&quot; &quot;And don't drive like ''my'' sister&quot;. The tagline was heard in a cameo for the [[Pixar]] film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', in which Tom and Ray voiced [[anthropomorphized]] vehicles (Rusty and Dusty Rust-Eze, a 1963 [[Dodge Dart]] V1.0 and a 1963 [[Dodge A100]] van respectively) with personalities similar to their own on-air personae.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0317219|Cars}}. Retrieved on June 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Tom notoriously once owned a green Dodge Dart, known jokingly on the program by the faux-elegant name &quot;Dartre&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/features/dart/ | title=1963 Dodge Dart test notes | publisher=Car Talk | accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Magliozzis are long-time [[car mechanic]]s. Ray Magliozzi has a bachelor of science degree in humanities and science from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], while Tom has a bachelor of science degree in economics from MIT and an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] and [[Doctor of Business Administration|DBA]] from the [[Boston University Graduate School of Management]].

The duo, usually led by Ray, are known for rants on the evils of the [[internal combustion engine]], people who talk on [[cell phones]] while driving, [[Peugeot]]s, women named Donna who always seem to drive [[Camaro]]s, lawyers, the clever use of the [[English language]], and practically anything else, including themselves. They have a relaxed and &quot;humorous&quot; approach to cars, car repair, [[cup holder]]s, pets, lawyers, car repair mechanics, [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s, and almost everything else. They often cast a critical, jaundiced insider's eye toward the auto industry. Tom and Ray are committed to the values of defensive driving and environmentalism.

The Magliozzis operate the Good News Garage in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], a few blocks northwest of the MIT campus. The show's offices are located nearby at the corner of JFK Street and Brattle Street in [[Harvard Square]], marked as &quot;[[Dewey, Cheatem &amp; Howe|Dewey, Cheetham &amp; Howe]]&quot;, the imaginary law firm to which they refer on-air. DC&amp;H doubles as the business name of Tappet Brothers Associates, the corporation established to manage the business end of ''Car Talk''.  Initially a joke, the company was incorporated after the show expanded from a single station to national syndication.

The two were commencement speakers at MIT in 1999.

{{Ecumenical councils of the Catholic Church}}

The '''Council of Chalcedon''' was a church council held from 8 October to 1 November, 451 AD, at [[Chalcedon]] (a city of [[Bithynia]] in [[Asia Minor]]), on the Asian side of the [[Bosporus]]. This was a highly influential council and marked a key turning point in the [[Christological]] debates that broke apart the church of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] in the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;''The acts of the Council of Chalcedon'' by Council of Chalcedon, Richard Price, Michael Gaddis 2006 ISBN 0853230390 pages 1–5 [http://books.google.com/books?id=6IUaOOT1G3UC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=Chalcedon+catholic+anglican+eastern&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ql_gTMj_Lon5sgafnez6Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the last council which many [[Anglican]]s and most [[Protestants]] consider [[ecumenical]].&lt;ref name=Armentrout &gt;''An Episcopal dictionary of the church'' by Donald S. Armentrout, Robert Boak Slocum 2005 ISBN 0898692113 page 81 [http://books.google.com/books?id=y_RpbmWNfHcC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=Chalcedon+catholic+anglican+eastern&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ql_gTMj_Lon5sgafnez6Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Chalcedon%20catholic%20anglican%20eastern&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of Chalcedon was convened by [[Patriarch Fravitta of Constantinople|Flavian]]'s successor, [[Patriarch Anatolius of Constantinople|Anatolius]], at Pope Leo I's urging, to set aside the 449 [[Second Council of Ephesus]], better known as the &quot;Robber Council&quot;. The Council of Chalcedon repudiated [[Monophysitism|the idea that Jesus had only one nature]], and stated that Christ has two natures in one person. The [[Chalcedonian Creed]] describes the &quot;full humanity and full divinity&quot; of [[Jesus]], the second person of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]]. The council also issued 27 disciplinary canons governing church administration and authority. In the famous 28th canon passed by the council, the bishops sought to raise the See of Constantinople (New Rome) in stature, claiming that Constantinople enjoyed honor and authority similar to that of the See of (the older) Rome. Pope Leo's legate opposed the canon but in 453, Leo confirmed all the canons, except the 28th.

The Council is considered by the [[Roman Catholics]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the [[Eastern Orthodox]], the [[Old Catholics]], and various other [[Western Christian]] groups to have been the '''Fourth [[Ecumenical Council]]'''. As such, it is recognized as [[infallible]] in its [[dogmatic definition]]s by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] Churches (then one church). Most [[Protestantism|Protestants]] also consider the concept of the [[Trinity]] as defined by these councils to be orthodox doctrine to which they adhere. However, the Council resulted in a major schism, with those who refused to accept its teaching, now known as [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], being accused of [[monophysitism]]. The Oriental Orthodox churches reject the &quot;monophysite&quot; label and instead describe themselves as [[Miaphysitism|miaphysite]].

==Historical background==
===Relics of Nestorianism===

In 325, the first ecumenical council ([[First Council of Nicaea]]) determined that Jesus Christ was God, &quot;[[consubstantiality|consubstantial]]&quot; with the Father, and rejected the [[Arianism|Arian contention]] that Jesus was a created being. This was reaffirmed at the [[First Council of Constantinople (381)]] and the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (431).

After the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] had condemned [[Nestorianism]], there remained a conflict between [[Patriarch]]s [[John of Antioch]] and [[Cyril of Alexandria]]. Cyril claimed that John remained Nestorian in outlook, while John claimed that Cyril held to the [[Apollinarianism|Apollinarian]] heresy. The two settled their differences under the mediation of the Bishop of Beroea, [[Acacius of Beroea|Acacius]], on April 12, 433. In the following year, [[Theodoret]] of [[Cyrrhus, Syria|Cyrrhus]] assented to this formula as well, apparently putting a rest to Nestorianism forever within the Roman Empire.

However, the works of two deceased [[Antioch]]ean theologians, [[Diodorus of Tarsus]] and [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]], were at this time translated into [[Syriac]]. By the intervention of [[Archbishop Proclus of Constantinople]], the two theologians were condemned throughout the East, but this situation would later provide the material for the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] some hundred years later.

=== Eutychian controversy ===
About two years after [[Cyril of Alexandria]]'s death in 444, an aged [[monk]] from Constantinople named [[Eutyches]] began teaching a subtle variation on the traditional [[Christology]] in an attempt (as he described in a letter to [[Pope Leo I]] in 448) to stop a new outbreak of [[Nestorianism]]. He claimed to be a faithful follower of Cyril's teaching, which was declared orthodox in the Union of 432.

Cyril had taught that &quot;There is only one ''physis'', since it is the Incarnation, of God the Word.&quot; Cyril had apparently understood the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] word ''physis'' to mean approximately what the [[Latin]] word ''persona'' (person) means, while most Greek theologians would have interpreted that word to mean ''natura'' (nature). Thus, many understood Eutyches to be advocating [[Docetism]], a sort of reversal of [[Arianism]]—where Arius had denied the [[consubstantial]] divinity of [[Jesus]], Eutyches seemed to be denying his human nature. Cyril's orthodoxy was not called into question, since the Union of 433 had explicitly spoken of two ''physeis'' in this context.

Leo I wrote that Eutyches' error seemed to be more from a lack of skill on the matters than from malice. Further, his side of the controversy tended not to enter into arguments with their opponents, which prevented the misunderstanding from being uncovered. Nonetheless, due to the high regard in which Eutyches was held (second only to the Patriarch of Constantinople in the East), his teaching spread rapidly throughout the east.

In November 447, during a local [[synod]] in Constantinople, Eutyches was denounced as a heretic by the Bishop [[Eusebius of Dorylaeum]].  Eusebius demanded that Eutyches be removed from office.  Patriarch [[Flavian of Constantinople]] preferred not to press the matter on account of Eutyches' great popularity.  He finally relented and Eutyches was condemned as a heretic by the synod.  However, the Emperor [[Theodosius II]] and the Patriarch of [[Alexandria]], [[Dioscorus of Alexandria|Dioscorus]], rejected this decision ostensibly because Eutyches had repented and confessed his orthodoxy.  Dioscorus then held his own synod which reinstated Eutyches.  The competing claims between the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Alexandria led the emperor to call a council which was held in [[Ephesus]] in 449.  The emperor invited [[Pope Leo I]] to preside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Hughes |first = Philip |authorlink = |coauthors = |title = A Popular History of the Catholic Church |publisher = Image Books (Doubleday) |year = 1954 |location = Garden City, New York |pages = 37 |url = |doi = |id = |isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He declined to attend on account of the invasion of Italy by [[Attila the Hun]].  However, he agreed to send four legates to represent him.  Leo provided his legates, one who died en route, with a letter explaining Rome's position in the controversy.  Leo's letter, now known as '''Leo's Tome''', confessed that Christ had two natures, and was not of or from two natures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leo&quot;&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xi.vii.html Leo's Tome]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it could be reconciled with Cyril's [[Formula of Reunion]], it was not compatible in its wording with Cyril's Twelve Anathemas. In particular, the third anathema reads: &quot;If anyone divides in the one Christ the [[Hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostases]] after the union, joining them only by a conjunction of dignity or authority or power, and not rather by a coming together in a union by nature, let him be anathema.&quot; This appeared to some to be incompatible with Leo's definition of two natures hypostatically joined. However, the Council would determine (with the exception of 13 Egyptian bishops) that this was an issue of wording and not of doctrine; a committee of bishops appointed to study the orthodoxy of the Tome using Cyril's letters (which included the twelve anathemas) as their criteria unanimously determined it to be orthodox, and the Council, with few exceptions, supported this.&lt;ref&gt;Fr. John Romanides, http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.06.en.orthodox_and_oriental_orthodox_consultation.htm#m7&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;Latrocinium&quot; of Ephesus==

On August 8, 449 the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] began its first session with Dioscorus presiding by command of the emperor.  Dioscorus began the council by banning all members of the November 447 synod which had deposed Eutyches.  He then introduced [[Eutyches]] who publicly professed that while Christ had two natures before the incarnation, the two natures had merged to form a single nature after the incarnation.  Of the 130 assembled bishops, 111 voted to rehabilitate Eutyches.  Throughout these proceedings, Roman legate [[Pope Hilarius|Hilary]] repeatedly called for the reading of Leo's Tome, but was ignored.  Dioscorus then moved to depose [[Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople|Flavian]] and Eusebius of Dorylaeum on the grounds that they taught the Word had been made flesh and not just assumed flesh from the Virgin and that Christ had two natures.  When Flavian and Hilary objected, Dioscorus called for a pro-monophysite mob to enter the church and assault Flavian as he clung to the altar.  Flavian was mortally wounded.  Dioscorus then placed Eusebius of Dorylaeum under arrest and demanded the assembled bishops approve his actions.  Fearing the mob, they all did.  The papal legates refused to attend the second session at which several more orthodox bishops were deposed, including Ibas of Edessa, Irenaeus of Tyre (a close personal friend of Nestorius), Domnus of Antioch, and Theodoret.  Dioscorus then pressed his advantage by having [[Cyril of Alexandria]]'s [[Twelve Anathemas]] posthumously declared orthodox&lt;ref&gt;[[Frend, W. H. C.]], ''The Rise of the Monophysite Movement'', James Clarke &amp; Co, 1972, pps. 41–43&lt;/ref&gt; with the intent of condemning any confession other than one nature in Christ.  Roman Legate Hilary, who as pope dedicated an oratory in the [[Lateran Basilica]] in thanks for his life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfpeople.org/Books/Pope/POPEp46.htm Life of St. Hilary]&lt;/ref&gt; managed to escape from Constantinople and brought news of the Council to Leo who immediately dubbed it a &quot;synod of robbers&quot; — [[Latrocinium]] — and refused to accept its pronouncements.  The decisions of this council now threatened [[Schism (religion)|schism]] between the East and the West.

==Convocation and session==
The situation continued to deteriorate, with Leo demanding the convocation of a new council and Emperor Theodosius II refusing to budge, all the while appointing bishops in agreement with Dioscorus.  All this changed dramatically with the emperor's death and the elevation of [[Marcian]], an orthodox Christian, to the imperial throne.  To resolve the simmering tensions, Marcian announced his intention to hold a new council.  Leo had pressed for it to take place in [[Italy]], but Emperor Marcian instead called for it to convene at [[İznik|Nicaea]].  Hunnish invasions forced it to move at the last moment to [[Chalcedon]], where the council opened on October 8, 451. Marcian had the bishops deposed by Dioscorus returned to their dioceses and had the body of Flavian brought to the capital to be buried honorably.

The emperor asked Leo to preside over the council, but Leo again chose to send legates in his place.  This time, Bishops Pachasinus of Lilybaeum and Julian of Cos and two priests Boniface and Basil represented the western church at the council.  The Council of Chalcedon condemned the work of the Robber Council and professed the doctrine of the Incarnation presented in Leo's Tome.  Attendance at this council was very high, with about 370 bishops (or presbyters representing bishops) attending (see Price and Gaddis, The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon, Liverpool 2005, vol. 3, 193–6). Paschasinus refused to give Dioscorus (who had [[excommunicated]] Leo leading up to the council) a seat at the council.  As a result, he was moved to the nave of the church. Paschasinus further ordered the reinstatement of Theodoret and that he be given a seat, but this move caused such an uproar among the council fathers, that Theodoret also sat in the nave, though he was given a vote in the proceedings, which began with a trial of Dioscorus.

Marcian wished to bring proceedings to a speedy end, and asked the council to make a pronouncement on the doctrine of the Incarnation before continuing the trial. The council fathers, however, felt that no new creed was necessary, and that the doctrine had been laid out clearly in Leo's Tome.&lt;ref name = &quot;Leo&quot;/&gt; They were also hesitant to write a new creed as the Council of Ephesus had forbidden writing down any &quot;new faith&quot; other than the Nicene faith.  The second day of the council ended with shouts from the bishops, &quot;It is [[Saint Peter|Peter]] who says this through Leo. This is what we all of us believe. This is the faith of the Apostles. Leo and Cyril teach the same thing.&quot; However, during the reading of Leo's Tome, three passages were challenged as being potentially Nestorian, and their orthodoxy was defended by using the writings of Cyril.&lt;ref name=&quot;romanity.org&quot;&gt;Fr. John Romanides, ST. CYRIL'S &quot;ONE PHYSIS OR HYPOSTASIS OF GOD THE LOGOS INCARNATE&quot; AND CHALCEDON, Greek Orthodox Theological Review, vol. X, 2 Winter 1964–65, online at http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.08.en.st._cyrils_one_physis_or_hypostasis_of_god_the_log.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless due to such concerns, the Council decided to adjourn and appoint a special committee to investigate the orthodoxy of Leo's Tome, judging it by the standard of Cyril's Twelve Chapters, as some of the bishops present raised concerns about their compatibility. This committee was headed by Anatolius, Patriarch of Constantinople, and was given five days to carefully study the matter; Cyril's Twelve Chapters were to be used as the orthodox standard. The committee unanimously decided in favor of the orthodoxy of Leo, determining that what he said was compatible with the teaching of Cyril. A number of other bishops also entered statements to the effect that they believed that Leo's Tome was not in contradiction with the teaching of Cyril as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;romanity.org&quot;/&gt;

The council continued with Dioscorus' trial, but he refused to appear before the assembly. As a result, he was condemned, but by an underwhelming amount (more than half the bishops present for the previous sessions did not attend his condemnation), and all of his decrees were declared null. Marcian responded by exiling Dioscorus. All of the bishops were then asked to sign their assent to the Tome, but a group of thirteen Egyptians refused, saying that they would assent to &quot;the traditional faith.&quot; As a result, the emperor's commissioners decided that a creed would indeed be necessary and presented a text to the fathers. No consensus was reached, and indeed the text has not survived to the present.

Paschasinus threatened to return to Rome to reassemble the council in Italy. Marcian agreed, saying that if a clause were not added to the creed supporting Leo's doctrine, the bishops would have to relocate. The bishops relented and added a clause, saying that, according to the decision of Leo, in Christ there are two natures united, inconvertible [natures], inseparable [natures].

===Confession of Chalcedon===
{{Main|Chalcedonian Creed}}
The Confession of Chalcedon provides a clear statement on the human and divine nature of Christ:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/main/chalcedon/chalcedonian_definition.shtml The Chalcedonian Deefinition. Agreed at the Fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon in 451.] @ earlychurchtexts.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We, then, following the holy Fathers, all with one consent, teach people to confess one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, the same perfect in Godhead and also perfect in manhood;  truly God and truly man, of a reasonable [rational] soul and body; consubstantial [co-essential] with the Father according to the Godhead, and consubstantial with us according to the Manhood; in all things like unto us, without sin; begotten before all ages of the Father according to the Godhead, and in these latter days, for us and for our salvation, born of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, according to the Manhood; one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, only begotten, to be acknowledged in two natures, inconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably; (ἐν δύο φύσεσιν ἀσυγχύτως, ἀτρέπτως, ἀδιαιρέτως, ἀχωρίστως – ''in duabus naturis inconfuse, immutabiliter, indivise, inseparabiliter'') the distinction of natures being by no means taken away by the union, but rather the property of each nature being preserved, and concurring in one Person (''prosopon'') and one Subsistence (''hypostasis''), not parted or divided into two persons, but one and the same Son, and only begotten God (μονογενῆ Θεὸν), the Word, the Lord Jesus Christ; as the prophets from the beginning [have declared] concerning Him, and the Lord Jesus Christ Himself has taught us, and the Creed of the holy Fathers has handed down to us.}}

===Canons===

The work of the council was completed by a series of 27 disciplinary [[canon law|canons]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-105.htm#P4958_1022711]&lt;/ref&gt;

Canon 28 grants equal privileges (''{{lang|la|isa presbeia}}'') to Constantinople as of Rome because Constantinople is the [[New Rome]] as renewed by canon 36 of the [[Quinisext Council]]. The [[papal legate]]s were not present for the vote on this canon, and protested it afterwards, and was not ratified by Pope Leo in Rome.

According to some ancient Greek collections, canons 29 and 30 are attributed to the council: canon 29, which states that an unworthy bishop cannot be demoted but can be removed, is an extract from the minutes of the 19th session; canon 30, which grants the Egyptians time to consider their rejection of Leo's ''Tome'', is an extract from the minutes of the fourth session.&lt;ref&gt;''The Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils'', Vol. 1, ed. Norman P. Tanner, S.J. (1990), 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all likelihood an official record of the proceedings was made either during the council itself or shortly afterwards. The assembled bishops informed the pope that a copy of all the &quot;Acta&quot; would be transmitted to him; in March, 453, Pope Leo commissioned Julian of Cos, then at Constantinople, to make a collection of all the Acts and translate them into Latin. Most of the documents, chiefly the minutes of the sessions, were written in Greek; others, e.g. the imperial letters, were issued in both languages; others, again, e.g. the papal letters, were written in Latin. Eventually nearly all of them were translated into both languages.

==The status of Constantinople==
The Council of Chalcedon also elevated the See of Constantinople to a position &quot;second in eminence and power to the [[diocese of Rome|Bishop of Rome]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bokenkotter84&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=A Concise History of the Catholic Church |last=Bokenkotter |first=Thomas |year=2004|page=84 |publisher=Doubleday|isbn=0385505841}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Noble214&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Noble| first = Thomas| coauthors = Strauss, Barry |title=Western Civilization | year=2005|page=214| publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company|isbn=0618432779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of Nicea in 325 had noted the primacy of the See of Rome, followed by the Sees of Alexandria and Antioch. At the time, the See of Constantinople was yet of no ecclesiastical prominence but its proximity to the Imperial court, gave rise to its importance. The Council of Constantinople in 381 modified the situation somewhat by placing Constantinople second in honor, above Alexandria and Antioch, stating in Canon III, that &quot;&quot;the bishop of Constantinople... shall have the prerogative of honor after the bishop of Rome; because Constantinople is New Rome&quot;. In the early 5th century, this status was challenged by the bishops of Alexandria, but the Council of Chalcedon confirmed in Canon XXVIII:
:And the One Hundred and Fifty most religious Bishops, actuated by the same consideration, gave equal privileges (ἴσα πρεσβεῖα) to the most holy throne of New Rome, justly judging that the city which is honoured with the Sovereignty and the Senate and enjoys equal privileges with the old imperial Rome, should in ecclesiastical matters also be magnified as she is, and rank next after her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xi.xviii.xxviii.html Canon IX, Council of Chalcedon Seven Ecumenical Councils, Christian Classics Ethereal Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

In making their case, the council fathers argued that tradition had accorded &quot;honor&quot; to the see of older Rome because it was the first imperial city.  Accordingly, “moved by the same purposes” the fathers “apportioned equal prerogatives to the most holy see of new Rome” because “the city which is honored by the imperial power and senate and enjoying privileges equaling older imperial Rome should also be elevated to her level in ecclesiastical affairs and take second place after her.”&lt;ref&gt;''Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils'', ed. Norman P. Tanner, SJ, 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework for allocating ecclesiastical authority advocated by the council fathers mirrored the allocation of imperial authority in the later period of the [[Roman Empire]].  The Eastern position could be characterized as being political in nature, as opposed to a doctrinal view. In practice, all Christians East and West addressed the papacy as the See of Peter or the Apostolic See rather than the See of the Imperial Capital.  Rome understands this to indicate that its precedence has always come from its direct lineage from the apostle Peter rather than its association with Imperial authority.

After the passage of the Canon 28, Rome filed a protest against the reduction of honor given to Antioch and  Alexandria.  However, fearing  that withholding Rome's approval would be interpreted as a rejection of the entire council, in 453 the pope confirmed the council’s canons with a protest against the 28th.

==Consequences of the council==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Nestorianism]] --&gt;
The near-immediate result of the council was a major schism. The bishops that were uneasy with the language of Pope Leo's Tome repudiated the council, saying that the acceptance of two ''physes'' was tantamount to Nestorianism. [[Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria|Dioscorus, the Patriarch of Alexandria]], advocated miaphysitism and had dominated the Council of Ephesus.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Latrocinium.&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Churches that rejected Chalcedon in favor of Ephesus broke off from the rest of the Church in a schism.

[[Justinian I]] attempted to bring those monks who still rejected the decision of the Council of Chalcedon into communion with the greater church. The exact time of this event is unknown, but it is believed to have been between 535 and 548. [[Abraham (Copt)|St Abraham of Farshut]] was summoned to Constantinople and he chose to bring with him four monks. Upon arrival, Justianian summoned them and informed them that they would either accept the decision of the Council or lose their positions. Abraham refused to entertain the idea. [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]] tried to persuade Justinian to change his mind, seemingly to no avail.  Abraham himself stated in a letter to his monks that he preferred to remain in exile rather than subscribe to a faith contrary to that of [[Athanasius]]. They were not alone, and the non-Chalcedon churches compose [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], with the [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Church of Alexandria]] as their spiritual leader. Only in recent years has a degree of rapprochement between Chalcedonian Christians and the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] been seen.

&lt;/ref&gt; attempting to advance a pointed [[prolate spheroid]] ball into the opposing team's scoring area ([[end zone]]).  In Canada, the term '''football''' usually refers to Canadian football and [[American football]] collectively, or either sport specifically, depending on the context. The two sports have shared origins and are closely related, but have [[comparison of Canadian and American football|significant differences]]—in particular, 12 players on the field per team in Canadian football rather than 11, and three [[Down (American football)|downs]] per possession rather than four. The fewer number of downs in Canadian football results in less [[Rush (American football)#Offense|offensive rushing]] than in the American game.

[[Rugby football]] in Canada had its origins in the early 1860s,&lt;ref name=1860s/&gt; and over time, the unique game known as Canadian football developed. Both the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL), the sport's top professional league, and [[Football Canada]], the governing body for amateur play, trace their roots to 1884 and the founding of the Canadian Rugby Football Union. Currently active teams such as the [[Toronto Argonauts]] and [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] have similar longevity. The CFL is the most popular and only major professional Canadian football league. Its championship game, the [[Grey Cup]], is the country's single largest sporting event and is watched by nearly half of Canada's population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Houston 2006-12-20&quot;&gt;{{Cite news  | last =Zelkovich  | first = Chris  | title = Grey Cup a ratings champion | newspaper = The Toronto Star | location = Toronto, Ontario | date=1 December 2009  | url=http://www.thestar.com/sports/football/cfl/greycup/article/732817--zelkovich-grey-cup-a-ratings-champion | accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian football is also played at the high school, junior, collegiate, and semi-professional levels: the [[Canadian Junior Football League]] and [[Quebec Junior Football League]] are leagues for players aged 18–22, many post-secondary institutions compete in [[CIS football|Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] for the [[Vanier Cup]], and senior leagues such as the [[Alberta Football League]] have grown in popularity in recent years. Great achievements in Canadian football are enshrined in the [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]].

Other organizations across Canada perform senior league Canadian football during the summer.

==History==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Canadian Football League]] --&gt;
{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}
The first documented [[gridiron football]] match was a game played on November 9, 1861, at [[University College, University of Toronto|University College]], [[University of Toronto]] (approximately 400 yards west of Queen's Park). One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was (Sir) William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school.  A football club was formed at the university soon afterward, although its rules of play at this stage are unclear.&lt;ref name=1860s&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1860 |work= Official Site of the Canadian Football League|title= Timeline 1860s |publisher=Canadian Football League |accessdate=2010-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, at [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]], Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland and Frederick A. Bethune devised rules based on [[rugby football]]. However, modern Canadian football is widely regarded as having originated with a game of rugby played in [[Montreal]], in 1865, when [[British Army]] officers played local civilians.&lt;ref name= 1860s/&gt; The game gradually gained a following, and the [[Montreal Football Club]] was formed in 1868, the [[oldest football club|first recorded non-university football club]] in Canada.

This rugby-football soon became popular at Montreal's [[McGill University]]. McGill challenged [[Harvard University]] to a game, in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212839/gridiron-football |title=gridiron football (sport)|work = Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=britannica.com |accessdate=2010-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predecessors of the [[Canadian Football League]] include the [[Football Canada|Canadian Rugby Football Union]] (CRFU), and the Canadian Rugby Union. The CRFU, original forerunner to the current Canadian Football League, was established in 1882.

==League play==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
Canadian football is played at several levels in Canada. The professional league in which the sport is played is the eight-team [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL), and its champion is awarded the [[Grey Cup]], the oldest trophy in professional football,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. The CFL regular season begins in June, and playoffs are completed by mid-November. In cities with outdoor stadiums such as [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Montreal]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], and [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], low temperatures and icy field conditions can seriously affect the outcome of a game.

Amateur football is governed by [[Football Canada]]. At the university level, 27 teams play in four conferences under the auspices of [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]]; the CIS champion is awarded the [[Vanier Cup]]. Junior football is played by many after high school before joining the university ranks. There are 20 junior teams in three divisions in the [[Canadian Junior Football League]] competing for the [[Canadian Bowl]]. The [[Quebec Junior Football League]] includes teams from Ontario and Quebec who battle for the Manson Cup.

[[Semi-professional]] leagues have grown in popularity in recent years, with the [[Alberta Football League]] becoming especially popular. The [[Northern Football Conference]] formed in Ontario in 1954 has also surged in popularity as College players that do not continue to or get drafted to a professional team but still want to continue playing football. The Ontario champion plays against the Alberta champion for the &quot;National Championship&quot;. The [[Canadian Major Football League]] is the governing body for the semi-professional game.

==The field==
[[File:Commonwealth Stadium, Edmonton, August 2005.jpg|thumb|Edmonton's [[Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)|Commonwealth Stadium]]: the largest venue in the [[Canadian Football League]]]]
The Canadian football field is {{convert|110|yd|m|0}} long and {{convert|65|yd|m|0}} wide with [[end zone]]s {{convert|20|yd|m|0}} deep. At each goal line is a set of {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-high|0|sing=on}} [[goalposts]], which consist of two ''uprights'' joined by an {{convert|18+1/2|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} crossbar which is {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} above the goal line. The goalposts may be H-shaped (both posts fixed in the ground) although in the higher-calibre competitions the tuning-fork design (supported by a single curved post behind the goal line, so that each post starts {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} above the ground) is preferred. The sides of the field are marked by white sidelines, the goal line is marked in white, and white lines are drawn laterally across the field every {{convert|5|yd|m|1}} from the goal line.&lt;ref name=conversions/&gt;  These lateral lines are called &quot;yard lines&quot; and are marked with the distance in yards from the nearest goal line, except for the yard line in the centre of the field, which is usually marked with a &quot;C&quot; for &quot;Centre line&quot; .&quot;Hash marks&quot; are painted in white, parallel to the yardage lines, at {{convert|1|yd|m|0}} intervals, {{convert|24|yd|m|0}} from the sidelines.

On fields that have a surrounding [[running track]], such as [[Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)|Commonwealth Stadium]], [[Percival Molson Memorial Stadium|Molson Stadium]], and many [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport|universities]], the endzones are often cut off in the corners to accommodate the track.

==Play of the game==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}
Teams advance across the field through the execution of quick, distinct plays, which involve the possession of a brown, [[prolate spheroid]] ball with ends tapered to a point. The ball has two one-inch-wide white stripes.

===Kickoff===
Play begins with one team place-kicking the ball from its own 35-yard line. Both teams then attempt to catch the ball. The player who recovers the ball may run while holding the ball, or lateral throw the ball to a teammate.

===Stoppage of play===
Play stops when the ball carrier's knee, elbow, or any other body part aside from the feet and hands, is forced to the ground (a ''tackle''); when a forward pass is not caught on the fly (during live play); when a touchdown (see below) or a field goal is scored; when the ball leaves the playing area by any means (being carried, thrown, or fumbled out of bounds); or when the ball carrier is in a standing position but can no longer move. If no score has been made, the next play starts from ''scrimmage''.

===Scrimmage===
Before scrimmage, an official places the ball at the spot it was at the stop of clock, but no nearer than 24 yards from the sideline or 1 yard from the goal line. The line parallel to the goal line passing through the ball (line from sideline to sideline for the length of the ball) is referred to as the line of scrimmage. This line is a sort of &quot;no-man's land&quot;; players must stay on their respective sides of this line until the play has begun again. For a scrimmage to be valid the team in possession of the football must have seven players, excluding the quarterback, within one yard of the line of scrimmage. The defending team must stay a yard or more back from the line of scrimmage.

===Live play===
[[File:Anthony Calvillo game action, 93rd Grey Cup.jpg|thumb|right|[[Montreal Alouettes]] quarterback [[Anthony Calvillo]] looks down field with the ball during the [[93rd Grey Cup]] game at [[BC Place]].]]

On the field at the beginning of a play are two teams of 12 (unlike 11 in American football). The team in possession of the ball is the offence and the team defending is referred to as the defence.&lt;!-- Canadian spelling uses the &quot;c&quot; --&gt; Play begins with a backwards pass through the legs (the snap) by a member of the offensive team, to the quarterback or punter. If the quarterback or punter receives the ball, he may then do any of the following:

* run with the ball, attempting to run farther down field (gaining yardage). The ball-carrier may run in any direction he sees fit (including backwards).
* ''drop-kick'' the ball, dropping it onto the ground and kicking it on the bounce. (This play is exceedingly rare in both Canadian and American football, although in the Canadian game it is sometimes used as a last-second &quot;desperation play&quot; if the team is behind by less than three points.)
* pass the ball laterally or backwards to a teammate. This play is known as a ''lateral'', and may come at any time on the play. A pass which has any amount of forward momentum is a ''forward pass'' (see below); forward passes are subject to many restrictions which do not apply to laterals.
* ''hand-off''—hand the ball off to a teammate, typically a halfback or the fullback.
* ''punt'' the ball; dropping it in the air and kicking it ''before'' it touches the ground. When the ball is punted, only opposing players (the receiving team), the kicker, and anyone behind the kicker when he punted the ball are able to touch the ball, or even go within five yards of the ball until it is touched by an eligible player (the No Yards rule, which is applied to all kicking plays).
* place the ball on the ground for a ''place kick''
* throw a ''[[forward pass]]'', where the ball is thrown to a receiver located farther down field (closer to the opponent's goal) than the thrower is. Forward passes are subject to the following restrictions:
** They must be made from ''behind'' the line of scrimmage
** Only one forward pass may be made on a play
** The pass must be made in the direction of an eligible receiver or pass 10 yards after the line of scrimmage

Each play constitutes a ''down''. The offence&lt;!-- Canadian spelling uses the &quot;c&quot; --&gt; must advance the ball at least ten yards towards the opponents' goal line within three downs or forfeit the ball to their opponents. Once ten yards have been gained the offence gains a new set of three downs (rather than the four downs given in American football). Downs do not accumulate. If the offensive team completes 10 yards on their first play, they lose the other two downs and are granted another set of three. If a team fails to gain ten yards in two downs they usually punt the ball on third down or try to kick a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] (see below), depending on their position on the field. The team may, however use its third down in an attempt to advance the ball and gain a cumulative 10 yards.

===Change in possession===
The ball changes possession in the following instances:

* If the offence scores a field goal, the scoring team must kickoff from their own 35-yard line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/story/2009/05/11/sp-cfl-ruleschanges.html |title=CFL introduces 4 rule changes for 2009 season |publisher= Canadian Broadcasting Company |accessdate=2010-07-13 | date=2009-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If the offence scores a touchdown, the scoring team must kickoff from their own 35-yard line. This also applies when the defence scores on a turnover which is returned for a touchdown—technically, they become the offence until the conclusion of the play, and the scoring team must still kickoff.
* If the defence scores on a safety (bringing the ball down in the offence's own end zone), they have the right to claim possession.
* If one team kicks the ball; the other team has the right to recover the ball and attempt a return. If a kicked ball goes out of bounds, or the kicking team scores a single or field goal as a result of the kick, the other team likewise gets possession.
* If the offence fails to make ten yards in three plays, the defence ''takes over on downs''.
* If the offence attempts a forward pass and it is ''intercepted'' by the defence; the defence takes possession immediately (and may try and advance the ball on the play). Note that incomplete forward passes (those which go out of bounds, or which touch the ground without being first cleanly caught by a player) result in the end of the play, and are not returnable by either team.
* If the offence ''fumbles'' (a ball carrier drops the football, or has it dislodged by an opponent, or if the intended player fails to catch a lateral pass or a snap from centre, or a kick attempt is blocked by an opponent), the ball may be recovered (and advanced) by either team. If a fumbled ball goes out of bounds, the team whose player last touched it is awarded possession at the spot where it went out of bounds. A fumble by the offence in their own end zone, which goes out of bounds, results in a safety.
* When the first half ends, the team which kicked to start the first half may receive a kickoff to start the second half.

===Rules of contact===
There are many rules to contact in this type of football. First, the only player on the field who may be legally tackled is the player currently in possession of the football (the ball carrier). Second, a receiver, that is to say, an offensive player sent down the field to receive a pass, may not be interfered with (have his motion impeded, be blocked, etc.) unless he is within one yard of the line of scrimmage (instead of {{convert|5|yd|m|1}} in American football). Any player may block another player's passage, so long as he does not hold or trip the player he intends to block. The kicker may not be contacted after the kick but before his kicking leg returns to the ground (this rule is not enforced upon a player who has blocked a kick), and the quarterback, having already thrown the ball, may not be hit or tackled.

===Infractions and penalties===
Infractions of the rules are punished with ''penalties'', typically a loss of yardage of 5, 10 or 15 yards against the penalized team. Minor violations such as ''offside'' (a player from either side encroaching into scrimmage zone before the play starts) are penalized five yards, more serious penalties (such as holding) are penalized 10 yards, and severe violations (such as face-masking) of the rules are typically penalized 15 yards. Depending on the penalty, the penalty yardage may be assessed from the original line of scrimmage, the spot the violation occurred (for example, for a pass interference infraction), or the place the ball ended after the play. Penalties on the offence may, or may not, result in a loss of down; penalties on the defence may result in a first down being automatically awarded to the offence. For particularly severe conduct, the game official(s) may eject players (ejected players may be substituted for), or in exceptional cases, declare the game over and award victory to one side or the other. Penalties do not affect the yard line which the offence must reach in order to reach first down (unless the penalty results in a first down being awarded); if a penalty against the defence results in the first down yardage being attained, then the offence is awarded a first down.

Penalties may occur before a play starts (such as offsides), during the play (such as holding), or in a dead-ball situation (such as [[unsportsmanlike conduct]]).

Penalties never result in a score for the offence. For example, a point-of-foul infraction committed by the defence in their end zone is not ruled a touchdown, but instead advances the ball to the one-yard line with an automatic first down. For a distance penalty, if the yardage is greater than half the distance to the goal line, then the ball is advanced half the distance to the goal line, though only up to the one-yard line (unlike American football, in Canadian football no scrimmage may start inside either one-yard line). If the original penalty yardage would have resulted in a first down or moving the ball past the goal line, a first down is awarded.

In most cases, the non-penalized team will have the option of ''declining'' the penalty; in which case the results of the previous play stand as if the penalty had not been called. One notable exception to this rule is if the kicking team on a 3rd down punt play is penalized before the kick occurs: the receiving team may not decline the penalty and take over on downs. After the kick is made, change of possession occurs and subsequent penalties are assessed against either the spot where the ball is caught, or the runback.

===Kicking===
Canadian football distinguishes three ways of kicking the ball:

; [[Place kick]] : Kicking a ball held on the ground by a teammate, or, on a kickoff (resuming play following a score), placed on a tee.
; [[Drop kick]] : Kicking a ball after bouncing it on the ground. Although rarely used today, it has the same status in scoring as a place kick. This play is part of the game's [[Rugby football|rugby]] heritage, and was largely made obsolete when the ball with pointed ends was adopted. Unlike the American game, Canadian rules allow a drop kick to be attempted at any time by any player, but the move is very rare.
; [[Punt (football)|Punt]] : Kicking the ball after it has been released from the kicker's hand and before it hits the ground. Punts may not score a field goal, even if one should travel through the uprights. As with drop kicks, players may punt at any time.

On punts and field goal attempts (but not kickoffs), members of the kicking team, other than the kicker and any teammates who are onside (behind the kicker at the time of the kick), may not approach within five yards of the ball until it has been touched by the receiving team.

===Scoring===
The methods of scoring are:

; Touchdown : Achieved when the ball is in possession of a player in the opponent's goal area, or when the ball in the possession of a player crosses or touches the plane of the opponent's goal-line, worth 6 points (5 points until 1956). A touchdown in Canadian football is often referred to as a &quot;major score&quot; or simply a &quot;major.&quot;
; Conversion (or Convert) : After a touchdown, the team that scored attempts one scrimmage play from any point between the hash marks on or outside the opponents' 5-yard line. If they make what would normally be a field goal, they score one point; what would normally be a touchdown scores two points (a &quot;two-point conversion&quot;). No matter what happens on the convert attempt, play then continues with a kickoff (see below).
; Field goal : Scored by a drop kick or place kick (except on a kickoff) when the ball, after being kicked and without again touching the ground, goes over the cross bar and between the goal posts (or between lines extended from the top of the goal posts) of the opponent's goal, worth three points. If the ball hits the upright above the cross-bar before going through, it is '''not''' considered a dead ball, and the points are scored. (Rule 5, Sect 4, Art 4(d))
; Safety : Scored when the ball becomes dead in the possession of a team in its own goal area, or when the ball touches or crosses the dead-line, or side-line-in-goal and touches the ground, a player, or some object beyond these lines as a result of the team scored against making a play. It is worth two points. This is different from a ''single'' (see below) in that the team scored against begins with possession of the ball. The most common safety is on a third down punt from the end zone, in which the kicker decides not to punt and keeps the ball in his team's own goal area. The ball is then turned over to the receiving team (who gained the two points), by way of a kickoff from the 25 yard line or scrimmaging from the {{convert|35|yd|sing=on}} line on their side of the field.
; Single : Scored when the ball becomes dead in the possession of a team in its own goal area, or when the ball touches or crosses the dead-line, or side-line-in-goal, and touches the ground, a player, or some object beyond these lines as a result of the ball having been kicked from the field of play into the goal area by the scoring team. It is worth one point. This is different from a Safety (see above) in that team scored against receives possession of the ball after the score.
:Officially, the single is called a ''rouge'' ([[French language|French]] for &quot;red&quot;) but is often referred to as a single. The exact derivation of the term is unknown, but it has been thought that in early Canadian football, the scoring of a single was signalled with a red flag.

====Resumption of play====
Resumption of play following a score is conducted under procedures which vary with the type of score.

* Following a touchdown and convert attempt (successful or not), play resumes with the scoring team kicking off from its own 35-yard line (45-yard line in amateur leagues).
* Following a field goal, the non-scoring team may choose for play to resume either with a kickoff as above, or by scrimmaging the ball from its own 35-yard line.
* Following a safety, the scoring team may choose for play to resume in either of the above ways, or it may choose to kick off from its own 35-yard line.
* Following a single or [[rouge (football)|rouge]], play resumes with the non-scoring team scrimmaging from its own 35-yard line, unless the single is awarded on a missed field goal, in which case the non-scoring team scrimmages from either the 35-yard line or the yard line from which the field goal was attempted, whichever is greater.

===Game timing===
The game consists of two 30-minute halves, each of which is divided into two 15-minute quarters. The clock counts down from 15:00 in each quarter. Timing rules change when there are three minutes remaining in a half.
A short break interval occurs after the end of each quarter (a longer break at halftime), and the two teams then change goals.

In the first 27 minutes of a half, the clock stops when:
* points are scored,
* the ball goes out of bounds,
* a forward pass is incomplete,
* the ball is dead and a penalty flag has been thrown,
* the ball is dead and teams are making substitutions (e.g., possession has changed, punting situation, short yardage situation),
* the ball is dead and a player is injured, or
* the ball is dead and a captain calls a [[sport time-out|time-out]].

The clock starts again when the referee determines the ball is ready for scrimmage, except for team time-outs (where the clock starts at the snap), after a time count foul (at the snap) and kickoffs (where the clock starts not at the kick but when the ball is first touched after the kick).

In the last three minutes of a half, the clock stops whenever the ball becomes dead. On kickoffs, the clock starts when the ball is first touched after the kick. On scrimmages, when it starts depends on what ended the previous play. The clock starts when the ball is ready for scrimmage except that it starts on the snap when on the previous play
* the ball was kicked off,
* the ball was punted,
* the ball changed possession,
* the ball went out of bounds,
* there were points scored,
* there was an incomplete forward pass,
* there was a penalty applied (not declined), or
* there was a team time-out.

The clock does not run during convert attempts in the last three minutes of a half. If the 15 minutes of a quarter expire while the ball is live, the quarter is extended until the ball becomes dead. If a quarter's time expires while the ball is dead, the quarter is extended for one more scrimmage. A quarter cannot end while a penalty is pending: after the penalty yardage is applied, the quarter is extended one scrimmage. Note that the non-penalized team has the option to ''decline'' any penalty it considers disadvantageous, so a losing team cannot indefinitely prolong a game by repeatedly committing penalties.

===Overtime===
In the CFL, if the game is tied at the end of regulation play, then each team is given an equal number of chances to break the tie. A coin toss is held to determine which team will take possession first; the first team scrimmages the ball at the opponent's 35-yard line and advances through a series of downs until it scores or loses possession. If the team scores a touchdown, starting with the 2010 season, it is required to attempt a 2-point conversion.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSN-Rules2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2010-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The other team then scrimmages the ball at the same 35-yard line and has the same opportunity to score. After the teams have completed their possessions, if one team is ahead, then it is declared the winner; otherwise, the two teams each get another chance to score, scrimmaging from the other 35-yard line. After this second round, if there is still no winner, during the regular season the game ends as a tie. In a playoff or championship game, the teams continue to attempt to score from alternating 35-yard lines, until one team is leading after both have had an equal number of possessions.

In [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] football, for the [[Uteck Bowl]], [[Mitchell Bowl]], and [[Vanier Cup]], the same overtime procedure is followed until there is a winner.

|}

===Offence===
The offensive positions found in Canadian football have, for the most part, evolved throughout the years, and are not officially defined in the rules. However, among offensive players, the rules recognize three different types of players:

; Down linemen: Down linemen are players who, at the start of every play, line up at the line of scrimmage; once in their stance they may not move until the play begins. The offence must have at least seven players lined up at the line of scrimmage on every play. The exception to this rule is the player (typically the ''centre'') who snaps the ball to the quarterback. Linemen generally do not run with the ball (unless they recover it on a fumble) or receive a hand-off or lateral pass, but there is no rule against it. Interior linemen (that is, excluding the two players at either end of the scrimmage line) are '''ineligible receivers'''; they may not receive a forward pass either. (The two [[offensive end]]s on the line of scrimmage may receive forward passes.)
; Backs: Backs line up behind the linemen; they may run with the ball, receive handoffs, laterals, and forward passes. They may also be in motion before the play starts.

Specific offensive positions include:

;Backs/Receivers:
; Quarterback: Generally the leader of the offence. Calls all plays to teammates, receives the ball off of snap, and initiates the action usually by running the ball himself, passing the ball to a receiver, or handing the ball off to another back.
; Fullback: Multiple roles including pass protection, receiving, and blocking for the running back. On short yardage situations may also carry the ball.
; Running back/Tailback: As the name implies, the main runner on the team. Also an eligible receiver and blocker on pass plays.
; Wide receiver: Lines up on the line of scrimmage, usually at a distance from the centre. Runs down the field in order to catch a forward pass from the quarterback.
; [[Slotback]]: Similar to the wide receiver, but lines up closer to the offensive line.
; Down linemen:
; Centre: Snaps the ball to the quarterback. Most important pass blocker on pass plays. Calls offensive-line plays.
; Left/right guard: Stands to the left and right of the centre helps protect the quarterback, Usually very good run blockers to open holes up the middle for runners.
; Left/right tackle: Stands on the ends of the offensive line, The biggest men on the line, usually well over 300 [[avoirdupois|pounds]] (140&amp;nbsp;kg). Usually very good pass blockers.
; Offensive lineman: Collective name for centre, guards, and tackles.

===Defence===
The rules do not constrain how the defence may arrange itself (other than the requirement that they must remain one yard behind the line of scrimmage until the play starts).

; Cornerback: Covers the wide receivers on most plays.
; Safety: Covers deep. Last line of defence, can offer run support or blitz.
; Defensive halfback: Covers the slotback and helps contain the run from going to the outside.
; Defensive back: Collective term for cornerback, safety, and defensive halfback.
; Nose tackle: Lineman across from centre, tries to get past the offensive-line or take double team and open holes for blitzes.
; Defensive tackle: Inside defensive linemen try to break through the offensive line and open holes for linebackers.
; Defensive end: Main rushing lineman. Rushes the quarterback and try to contain rushers behind the line of scrimmage.
; Middle linebacker: Lines up across from the centre 3 to {{convert|4|yd}} back. Quarterback of the defence. Calls plays for lineman and linebackers.
; Weak-side linebacker: Lines up on the short side of field, and can drop into pass coverage or contain.
; Strong-side linebacker: Lines up on the opposite side and usually rushes.

===Special teams===
''Special teams'' generally refers to kicking plays, which typically involve a change in possession.

; Holder: Receives the snap on field goal tries and converts; places the ball in position and holds it to be kicked by the kicker. This position is generally filled by a reserve quarterback; occasionally the starting quarterback or punter will fill in as holder.
; Kicker: Kicks field goals, converts, kick-offs
; Punter: Punts ball, usually on third downs
; Returners: Fast, agile runners who specialize in fielding punts and kickoffs, attempting to advance them for better field position or a score.

{{contains Chinese text}}   

The '''Chinese calendar''' is a [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]] [[calendar]], incorporating elements of a [[lunar calendar]] with those of a [[solar calendar]]. It is not exclusive to [[China]], but followed by many other Asian cultures as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;afgen.com&quot;&gt;[http://afgen.com/calendars_time.html Calendars, Time, &amp; Numerology - Egyptian Roots &amp; Mathematical Precision of Our Modern Calendar]&lt;/ref&gt; In most of [[East Asia]] today, the [[Gregorian calendar]] is used for day-to-day activities, but the Chinese calendar is still used for marking traditional East Asian holidays such as the [[Chinese New Year]] (the Spring Festival ({{Lang|zh|春節}})), the [[Duan Wu festival]], and the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]], and in [[astrology]], such as choosing the most auspicious date for a wedding or the opening of a building. Because each month follows one cycle of the [[moon]], it is also used to determine the [[phases of the moon]].

In China, the traditional calendar is known as the &quot;''agricultural calendar''&quot; ({{zh|t={{linktext|農|曆}}|s={{linktext|农|历}}|p=nónglì|links=no}}) while the Gregorian calendar is known as the &quot;''common calendar''&quot; ({{zh|t={{linktext|公|曆}}|s={{linktext|公|历}}|p=gōnglì|links=no}}). Another name for the Chinese calendar is the &quot;[[Yin and yang|Yin]] Calendar&quot; ({{zh|t={{linktext|陰|曆}}|s={{linktext|阴|历}}|p=yīnlì|links=no}}) in reference to the lunar aspect of the calendar, whereas the Gregorian calendar is the &quot;[[Yin and yang|Yang]] Calendar&quot; ({{zh|t={{linktext|陽|曆}}|s={{linktext|阳|历}}|p=yánglì|links=no}}) in reference to its solar properties. The Chinese calendar was also called the &quot;old calendar&quot; ({{zh|t={{linktext|舊|曆}}|s={{linktext|旧|历}}|p=jiùlì|links=no}}) after the &quot;new calendar&quot; ({{zh|t={{linktext|新|曆}}|s={{linktext|新|历}}|p=xīnlì|links=no}}), i.e., the Gregorian calendar, was adopted as the official calendar. For more than two thousand years, since the time of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] the month containing the [[winter solstice]] has almost always been the 11th month. (This means the new year starts on the second new moon after the winter solstice unless there is an 11th or 12th intercalary month, in which case it starts on the third new moon.) A calendar using this new year is often referred to as &quot;the [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] Calendar&quot; ({{zh|t={{linktext|夏|曆}}|s={{linktext|夏|历}}|p=xiàlì}}), following a comment in the [[Shiji]] which states that under the Xia Dynasty, the year began on the second new moon after the winter solstice. At times under some other dynasties in ancient China, the month with the winter solstice was the 12th or the 1st month.

The year 2011 in the Chinese calendar is the Year of the Rabbit. It began on February 3, 2011 and will end on January 22, 2012. According to traditional beliefs, some form of the calendar has been in use for almost five millennia. Based on archaeological evidence some form of it has been in use for three and a half millennia. The year 2011 is reckoned in the seldom-used continuously numbered system as 4708 or 4648 (depending on the epoch used, see [[#Continuously numbered years|Continuously numbered years]]).

==History==
===Early history===
The earliest evidence of the Chinese calendar is found on the [[oracle bone]]s of the [[Shang Dynasty]] (late second millennium BCE), which seem to describe a lunisolar year of 12 months, with a possible [[intercalary]] 13th, or even 14th, added empirically to prevent calendar ''drift''. The [[Sexagenary cycle]] for recording days was already in use. Tradition holds that, in that era, the year began on the first new moon after the winter solstice.

Early [[Eastern Zhou]] texts, such as the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', provide better understanding of the calendars used in the [[Zhou dynasty]]. One year usually had 12 months, which were alternately 29 and 30 days long (with an additional day added from time to time, to catch up with &quot;drifts&quot; between the calendar and the actual moon cycle), and [[intercalary]] months were added in an arbitrary fashion at the end of the year.

These arbitrary rules on day and month intercalation caused the calendars of each state to be slightly different, at times. Thus, texts like the Annals will often state whether the calendar they use (the calendar of Lu) is in phase with the ''Royal calendar'' (used by the Zhou kings).

Although tradition holds that in the Zhou, the year began on the new moon which preceded the [[winter solstice]], the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'' seem to indicate that (in Lu at least) the Yin calendar (the calendar used in [[Shang dynasty]], with years beginning on the first new moon after the [[winter solstice]]) was in use until the middle of the 7th century, and that the beginning of the year was shifted back one month around 650 BCE.

By the beginning of the [[Warring States]], progress in astronomy and mathematics allowed the creation of calculated calendars (where intercalary months and days are set by a rule, and not arbitrarily). The ''sìfēn'' 四分 (quarter remainder) calendar, which began about 484 BCE, was the first calculated Chinese calendar, so named because it used a solar year of 365¼ days (the same as the 1st century BCE [[Julian Calendar]] of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]), along with a 19-year (235-month) Rule Cycle, known in the West as the [[Metonic cycle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;deng 67&quot;&gt;Deng, Yingke. (2005). ''Ancient Chinese Inventions''. Translated by Wang Pingxing. Beijing: China Intercontinental Press ({{lang|zh-s|五洲传播出版社}}). ISBN 7-5085-0837-8. Page 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The year began on the new moon preceding the winter solstice, and intercalary months were inserted at the end of the year.

In 256 BCE, as the last Zhou king ceded his territory to Qin, a new calendar (the Qin calendar) began to be used. It followed the same principles as the Sifen calendar, except the year began one month before (the second new moon before the winter solstice, which now fell in the second month of the year). The Qin calendar was used during the [[Qin dynasty]], and in the beginning of the Western [[Han dynasty]].

===Taichu calendar===
The [[Emperor Wu of Han China|Emperor Wu]] of the Western [[Han dynasty]] introduced reforms that have governed the Chinese calendar ever since. His [[Taichuli calendar|Tàichū]] ({{lang|zh|太初}}, &quot;Grand Inception&quot;) calendar of 104 BCE had a year with the [[winter solstice]] in the 11th month and designated as intercalary any calendar month (a month of 29 or 30 whole days) during which the sun does not pass a principal term (that is, remained within the same sign of the [[zodiac]] throughout). The solar year of the Taichu calendar was defined as {{nowrap|365 &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{385}{1539}&lt;/math&gt;}} days and the lunar month as {{nowrap|29 &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{43}{81}&lt;/math&gt;}} days. Because the sun's mean motion was used to calculate the [[#Jieqi|jiéqì]] ({{zh|t={{linktext|節|氣}}|s={{linktext|节|气}}|links=no}}) (or seasonal markings) until 1645, this intercalary month was equally likely to occur after any month of the year. The conjunction of the sun and moon (the astronomical new moon) was calculated using the mean motions of both the sun and moon.

===True sun and moon===
Though the fact of the irregularity of the lunar orbit was known in the 1st century BCE, the starts of the months were calculated using the mean motions of both the sun and moon until 619, the second year of the [[Tang dynasty]], when chronologists began to use true motions modeled using two offset opposing [[parabola]]s (with small linear and cubic components). Unfortunately, the parabolas did not meet smoothly at the mean motion, but met with a discontinuity or jump.

With the introduction of European astronomy into China via the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], the motions of both the sun and moon began to be calculated with [[trigonometric function|sinusoids]] in the 1645 Shíxiàn calendar ({{lang|zh-t|時憲書}}, Book of the Conformity of Time) of the [[Qing dynasty]], made by the Jesuit [[Johann Adam Schall von Bell|Adam Schall]]. The true motion of the sun was now used to calculate the [[#Jieqi|jiéqì]], which caused the intercalary month to often occur after the second through the ninth months, but rarely after the tenth through first months. A few autumn-winter periods have two or three calendar months where the sun stays within one sign, interspersed with one or two calendar months where the sun enters two signs of the zodiac.

===Gregorian reform===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Tết]] --&gt;
The [[Gregorian calendar]] was adopted by the nascent [[Republic of China]] effective January 1, 1912 for official business, but the general populace continued to use the traditional calendar. The status of the Gregorian calendar was unclear between 1916 and 1921 while China was controlled by several competing [[warlord]]s each supported by foreign colonial powers. From about 1921 until 1928 warlords continued to fight over northern China, but the [[Kuomintang]] or Nationalist government controlled southern China and used the Gregorian calendar. After the Kuomintang reconstituted the Republic of China October 10, 1928, the Gregorian calendar was officially adopted, effective January 1, 1929. The Peoples Republic of China has continued to use the Gregorian calendar since 1949.

===Standard time===
Before 1929, the traditional calendar was calculated by the Central Observatory (formerly the Imperial Observatory) in Beijing using Beijing local time at a longitude of 116°25'E {{nowrap|(GMT+7h 45m 40s)}}. From 1929 to 1949 it was calculated by the Institute of Astronomy in Nanjing and since 1949 by the Purple Mountain Observatory outside of Nanjing using Chinese standard time at a longitude of 120°E (GMT+8h). This shifted the midnight marking the beginning of each day in both the traditional and Gregorian calendars by plus 14 minutes 20 seconds. This shift meant that any dark moon which formerly occurred just before midnight Beijing local time now occurred just after midnight Chinese standard time, causing the first day of a lunar month to occur one day later. However, unlike the official tables, most public calendars relied on the old ''Wannian Shu'' (Long-term (lit. &quot;10,000-year) Calendar；simplified Chinese: 万年书; traditional Chinese: 萬年書) last published in 1910 using Beijing time until they were forced to adopt the official traditional calendar using Chinese standard time when the two disagreed. In 1953 public calendars placed the dark moon and the first day of a lunar month on August 9, whereas the official traditional calendar placed it on August 10, which caused public calendars in most of the People's Republic of China to use the official tables and standard time after 1953. In 1978 the dates were respectively September 2 and 3, causing public calendars in the Hong Kong and Canton areas to do the same after 1978. In 1989 the dates were August 1 and 2, which caused Taiwan to do the same after 1989.&lt;ref&gt;F. Richard Stephenson and Liu Baolin, &quot;A brief contemporary history of the Chinese calendar&quot; (unpublished paper, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helmer Aslaksen, [http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/calendar/cal.pdf The mathematics of the Chinese calendar] pages 18 &amp; 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calendar rules==
The following rules outline the Chinese calendar since 104 BCE. Note: the rules allow either mean or true motions of the Sun and Moon to be used, depending on the historical period.

# The months are lunar months. This means the first day of each month beginning at ''midnight'' is the day of the astronomical [[dark moon]]. (This differs from a traditional Chinese &quot;day&quot; which begins at 11 p.m.).
# Each year has 12 regular months, which are numbered in sequence (1 to 12) and have alternative names. Every second or third year has an [[intercalary month]] ({{zh|t={{linktext|閏|月}}|s={{linktext|闰|月}}|p=rùnyuè|links=no}}), which may come after any regular month. It has the same number as the preceding regular month, but is designated intercalary.
# Every other [[#Solar term|jiéqì]] of the Chinese solar year is equivalent to an entry of the sun into a sign of the tropical zodiac (a principal term or cusp).
# The sun always passes the [[December solstice|winter solstice]] (enters Capricorn) during month 11.
# If there are 12 months between two successive occurrences of month 11, not counting either month 11, at least one of these 12 months must be a month during which the sun remains within the same zodiac sign throughout (no principal term or cusp occurs within it). If only one such month occurs, it is designated intercalary, but if two such months occur, only the first is designated intercalary. Note that for calendars before true motions of the sun were used for naming (i.e., before 1645), or in years where there is no double-cusp month in that year or the previous or following years (i.e., usually), the following rule suffices: a month with no principal term (or cusp) in it is designated intercalary.
# The times of the astronomical new moons and the sun entering a zodiac sign are determined using the time in the Chinese Time Zone by the [[Purple Mountain Observatory]] ({{zh|c={{linktext|紫|金|山|天|文|台}}|p=Zǐjīnshān Tiānwéntái|links=no}}) outside [[Nanjing]] using modern astronomical equations.

== Correspondence with Western Zodiac ==
The zodiac sign which the sun enters during the month and the ecliptic longitude of that entry point usually determine the number of a regular month. Month 1 (正月 zhēngyuè), literally means principal month. All other months are literally numbered, second month, third month, and so on.

=== Exceptions ===
Some believe the above correspondence to be always true, but there are exceptions, which, for example, prevent [[Chinese New Year]] from always being the second new moon after the winter solstice, or that cause the holiday to occur after the ''Rain Water'' jieqi. An exception will occur in 2033–2034, when the winter solstice is the second solar term in the 11th month. The next month is a no-entry month and so is intercalary, and a twelfth month follows which contains both the Aquarius and Pisces solar terms (''deep cold'' and ''rain water''). The Year of the Tiger thus begins on the third new moon following the Winter Solstice, and also occurs after the Pisces (''rain water'') jieqi, on February 19.

Another occurrence was in 1984–85, after the sun had entered both Capricorn at 270° and Aquarius at 300° in month 11, and then entered Pisces at 330° during the next month, which should have caused it to be month 1. The sun did not enter any sign during the next month. In order to keep the winter solstice in month 11, the month which should have been month 1 became month 12, and the month thereafter became month 1, causing Chinese New Year to occur on February 20, 1985 after the sun had already passed into Pisces at 330° during the previous month, rather than during the month beginning on that day.

{{Confusing section|date=November 2009}}

A lunar month is always either 29 or 30 days long, because the length of the synodic month (the cycle of the phases of the Moon) is approximately 29.53 days. The length of time the Sun is in one of the signs of the tropical Zodiac varies from about 30 days at perihelion to about 32 days at aphelion, because each sign represents an equal 30° geometrical expanse of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, and this orbit is an ellipse instead of a perfect circle, and is governed by Kepler's Second Law.

On those occasions when a dual-entry month does occur, it always occurs somewhere between two months that do not have any entry (non-entry months), because the maximum length of a lunar month is only very slightly greater than the minimum length of time the Sun spends in an astrological sign. It usually occurs alone and either includes the winter solstice or is nearby, because the Earth is at aphelion on or around July 4, and at perihelion, when the Sun moves the most quickly through astrological signs, on or around January 3, which is not far from the winter solstice, which takes place on or around December 22.

The fact that the winter solstice is required to fall in month 11 (rule 4) fixes the start and end points of the span between the occurrences of month 11 in two successive years. Therefore, it is possible to apply the rule that the first month of the 12 months between two occurrences of month 11 in which the Sun enters no new astrological sign is to be taken as the intercalary month (rule 5) in an unambiguous fashion. In 1984–85, the month immediately before the dual-entry month 11 was a non-entry month which was designated as an intercalary month 10. All months from the dual-entry month to the non-entry month that is not to be intercalary are sequentially numbered with the nearby regular months (rule 2). The last phrase of rule 5, choosing the first of two non-entry months between months 11, has not been required since the last calendar reform, and will not be necessary until the Chinese year spanning the Western years 2033–34, when two dual-entry months will be interspersed among three non-entry months, two of which will be on one side of month 11. The leap 11th month produced is a very rare event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinesecalendar.net/ The Mathematics of the Chinese Calendar]&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptions such as these are rare. Fully 96.6% of all months contain only one entry into a zodiacal sign (have one principal term or cusp), all obeying the numbering rules of the [[#Jieqi|jiéqì]] table, and 3.0% of all months are intercalary months (always non-entry months between principal terms or cusps). Only 0.4% of all months either are dual-entry months (have two principal terms or cusps) or are neighboring months that are renumbered.

It is only after the 1645 reform that this situation arose. Then it became necessary to fix one month to always contain its principal term and allow any other to occasionally not contain its principal term. Month 11 was chosen, because its principal term (the winter solstice) forms the start of the Chinese Solar year (the sui).

== Nineteen year cycle ==
The Chinese lunar calendar and the Gregorian Calendar often sync up every 19 years ([[Metonic cycle]]). Most Chinese people notice that their Chinese and Western birthdays often fall on the same day on their 19th, 38th birthday and so on. However, a 19-year cycle with a certain set of intercalary months is only an approximation, so an almost identical pattern of intercalary months in subsequent cycles will eventually change after some multiple of 19 years to a quite different 19-year cycle.

== Nomenclature ==
The [[Chinese zodiac]] (see also [[#Twelve animals|Twelve Animals]] section) is only used in naming years&amp;mdash;it is not used in the actual calculation of the calendar. In fact, the Chinese have a very different [[Chinese constellation|constellation system]].

Among the many series for naming months is the following, which mostly uses flower names.

# Primens (first month) {{lang|zh|正月}}: Latin &quot;primus mensis&quot;.
# Apricomens (apricot month) {{lang|zh|杏月}}: [[apricot]] blossoms.
# Peacimens (peach month) {{lang|zh|桃月}}: [[peach]] blossoms.
# Plumens (plum month) {{lang|zh|梅月}}: ''[[Prunus mume|plum]]'' ripens.
# Guavamens (guava month) {{lang|zh|榴月}}: [[pomegranate]] blossoms.
# Lotumens (lotus month) {{lang|zh|荷月}}: [[Nelumbo|lotus]] blossoms.
# Orchimens (orchid month) {{lang|zh|蘭月}}: [[orchid]] blossoms.
# Osmanthumens (osmanthus month) {{lang|zh|桂月}}: [[osmanthus]] blossoms.
# Chrysanthemens (chrysanthemum month) {{lang|zh|菊月}}: [[chrysanthemum]] blossoms.
# Benimens (good month) {{lang|zh|良月}}: good month.
# Hiemens (winter month) {{lang|zh|冬月}}: [[Winter]] month.
# Ultimens (last month) {{lang|zh|臘月}}: last month.

==Year markings==
===Regnal years===
Traditional Chinese years were not continuously numbered in the way that the BCE/CE (BC/AD) system is. More commonly, official year counting always used some form of a [[regnal year]]. This system began in 841 BCE during the [[Zhou dynasty]]. Prior to this, years were not marked at all, and historical events cannot be dated exactly.

In 841 BCE, the [[King Li of Zhou]] ({{lang|zh|周厲王}}) was ousted by a civilian uprising ({{lang|zh|國人暴動}}), and the country was governed for the next 14 years by a council of senior ministers, a period known as the [[Gonghe (regency)|Regency]] ({{lang|zh|共和行政}}). In this period, years were marked as First (second, third, ''etc.'') Year of the Regency.

Subsequently, years were marked as regnal years, ''e.g.'', the year 825 BCE was marked as the 3rd Year of the [[King Xuan of Zhou|Xuan King Jing of Zhou]] ({{lang|zh|周宣王三年}}). This system was used until early in the Han dynasty, when the [[Emperor Wen of Han|Wen Emperor of Han]] ({{lang|zh|漢文帝劉恒}}) instituted [[nian hao|regnal names]]. After this, most emperors used one or more regnal names to mark their reign. Usually, the emperor would institute a new name upon accession to the throne, and then change to new names to mark significant events, or to end a perceived cycle of bad luck. In the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, however, each emperor usually used only one regnal name for his reign.

This system continued until the [[Republic of China]], which counted years as [[Minguo calendar|Years of the Republic]], beginning in 1912. Thus, 1912 is the 1st Year of the Republic, 1949 the 38th, and 2011 the 100th. This system is still commonly used in [[Taiwan]]. In 1949 the [[People's Republic of China]] chose to use the [[Common Era]] system (equivalently, AD/BC system), in line with international standards.

===Stem-branch cycle===
The other system by which years are marked historically in China was by the stem-branch or [[sexagenary cycle]]. This system is based on two forms of counting: a cycle of 10 [[Heavenly Stems]] and a cycle of 12 [[Earthly Branches]]. Each year is named by a pair of one stem and one branch called a Stem-Branch ({{lang|zh|干支}} ''gānzhī''). The Heavenly Stems are associated with [[Yin Yang]] and the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]]. Recent 10-year periods began in 1984, 1994, and 2004. The Earthly Branches are associated with the 12 signs of the [[zodiac]]. Each Earthly Branch is also associated with an animal, collectively known as the [[#The Chinese zodiac|Twelve Animals]]. Recent 12-year periods began in 1984, 1996 and 2008.

Within the Heavenly Stems system the year is advanced up by one per year, cycling back to year one after the last (year ten). Similarly the Earthly Branches also advances by one per year, cyclically. Since the numbers 10 (Heavenly Stems) and 12 (Earthly Branches) have a common factor of 2, only 1/2 of the 120 possible stem-branch combinations actually occur. The resulting 60-year (or sexagesimal) cycle takes the name ''jiǎzǐ'' ({{lang|zh|甲子}}) after the first year in the cycle, being the Heavenly Stem of ''jiǎ'' and Earthly Branch of ''zǐ''. The term &quot;jiǎzǐ&quot; is used figuratively to mean &quot;a full lifespan&quot;&amp;mdash;one who has lived more than a ''jiǎzǐ'' is obviously blessed. (Compare the Biblical &quot;three-score years and ten.&quot;)

At first, this system was used to mark days, not years. The earliest evidence of this was found on [[oracle bone]]s dated c.1350 BCE in the [[Shang Dynasty]]. This system of date marking continues to this day, and can still be found on Chinese calendars today. Although a stem-branch cannot be used to deduce the actual day in historical events, it can assist in converting Chinese dates to other calendars more accurately.

Around the [[Han Dynasty]], the stem-branch cycle also began to be used to mark years. The 60-year system cycles continuously, and determines the animal or sign under which a person is born (see [[#The Chinese zodiac|Chinese Zodiac]]). These cycles were not named, and were used in conjunction with [[Chinese era name|regnal names]] declared by the [[Emperor of China|emperor]]. For example: {{lang|zh|康熙壬寅}} (Kāngxī rényín) (1662 AD) is the first {{lang|zh|壬寅}} (rényín) year during the reign of {{lang|zh|康熙}} ([[Kangxi Emperor|Kāngxī]]), regnal name of an emperor of the [[Qing Dynasty]]

The months, days and hours can also be denoted using Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, though they are commonly addressed using [[Chinese numeral]]s instead. In [[Chinese astrology]], four Stem-Branch pairs form the Eight Characters ({{lang|zh|八字}} ''bāzì'').

===Continuously numbered years===
There is no universally agreed upon &quot;[[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]&quot; or starting point for the Chinese calendar. Tradition holds that the calendar was invented by Emperor [[Yellow Emperor|Huang-di]] ({{lang|zh|黄帝}}) in the 61st year of his reign in what is now known under the proleptic Gregorian calendar as 2637 BCE. Many have used this date as the epoch, ''i.e.'' the first year of the first sixty-year (sexagesimal) cycle, of the Chinese calendar, but others have used the date of the beginning of his reign in 2697 BCE as the epoch. Since these dates are exactly sixty years apart, it does not matter which is used to determine the stem/branch sequence or the astrological sign for any succeeding year. That is, 2006 is a bingxu year and the Year of the Dog regardless of whether years are counted from 2637 BCE or 2697 BCE.

For the most part, the imposition of a continuous numbering system on the Chinese calendar was of interest mostly to Jesuit missionaries and other Europeans who assumed that calendars obviously had to be continuous. However, in the early 20th century, some Chinese [[Republicanism|Republican]]s began to advocate widespread use of continuously numbered years, so that year markings would be independent of the Emperor's [[Chinese era name|regnal name]]. (This was part of their attempt to delegitimise the [[Qing Dynasty]].) When [[Sun Yat-sen]] became the provisional president of the Republic of China, he sent telegrams to leaders of all provinces and announced the 13th day of 11th Month of the 4609th year of the Yellow Emperor's reign (corresponding to 1 January 1912) to be the 1st year of the Republic of China. His choice was adopted by many [[overseas Chinese]] communities outside [[Southeast Asia]] such as [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco's Chinatown]].

'''Notes'''

&lt;sup&gt;'''1'''&lt;/sup&gt; The beginning of each zodiac year should correspond to the first day of the lunar year.

&lt;sup&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sup&gt; As discussed above, there is considerable difficulty in establishing a basis for the chronology of the continuous year numbers. The numbers listed here are too high by 60 if an epoch of 2637 BCE is accepted. They may be too low by 1 if an epoch of 2698 BCE is accepted. That is, according to some sources, Gregorian 2006 (Chinese 4703) could alternatively correspond to 4643, or perhaps 4704. [[Chinese Americans]] in the [[United States]] use the epoch of 2698 BCE as the basis for numbering the years, and therefore Gregorian 2006 is numbered as 4704 and so forth for previous and subsequent years.

&lt;sup&gt;'''3'''&lt;/sup&gt; In any case, the correspondence between a lunisolar Chinese year and a solar Gregorian year is of course not exact. The first few months of each Gregorian year&amp;mdash;those preceding Chinese New Year&amp;mdash;belong to the previous Chinese year. For example, January 1 &amp;ndash; January 28, 2006 correspond to yǐyǒu or 4702. Thus, it might be more precise to state that Gregorian 2006 corresponds to 4702–4703, or that continuous Chinese 4703 corresponds to 2006–2007.

===Solar year versus lunar year===
There is a distinction between a solar year and a lunar year in the Chinese calendar because the calendar is lunisolar. A lunar year ({{lang|zh|年}} ''nián'') is from one Chinese new year to the next. A solar year ({{lang|zh|歲}} ''suì'') is either the period between one [[Spring Equinox]] and the next or the period between two [[December solstice|winter solstice]]s (see [[#Jieqi|Jiéqì]] section). A lunar year is exclusively used for dates, whereas a solar year, especially that between winter solstices, is used to number the months.

==Hours of the day==
Under the traditional system of hour-marking, each day is divided into 12 units ({{lang|zh|時辰}}). Each of these units is equivalent to two hours of international time. Each is named after one of the 12 [[Earthly Branches]]. The first unit, Hour of Zi ({{lang|zh|子時}}), begins at 11 p.m. of the previous day and ends at 1 a.m. Traditionally, executions of condemned prisoners occur at the midpoint of Hour of Wu ({{lang|zh|正午時}}), ''i.e.'', noon.

{{Main| Ke (unit)}}

A second system subdivided the day into 100 equal parts, [[Ke (unit)|ke]], each of which equalling 14.4 minutes or about one quarter of a standard Western hour. This was used for centuries, making the Chinese first to apply [[decimal time]] – long before the [[French Republican Calendar]]. However, because 100 could not be divided equally into the 12 &quot;double hours&quot;, the system was changed to variously 96, 108, and 120 ''ke'' in a day. During the [[Qing Dynasty]], the number was officially settled at 96, making each ''ke'' exactly a quarter of a Western hour. Today, ''ke'' is often used to refer to a quarter of an hour.

=={{anchor|The Chinese zodiac}}12 animals== &lt;!-- This title must remain as is so that internal and external links to it will work --&gt;
{{Main|Chinese zodiac}}
The 12 animals ({{lang|zh|十二生肖}} ''shí'èr shēngxiào'', &quot;twelve birth emblems&quot; or colloquially {{lang|zh|十二屬相}} ''shí'èr shǔxiàng'', &quot;twelve signs of belonging&quot;) representing the 12 [[Earthly Branches]] are, in order, the [[rat (zodiac)|rat]], [[ox (zodiac)|ox]], [[tiger (zodiac)|tiger]], [[rabbit (zodiac)|rabbit]], [[dragon (zodiac)|dragon]], [[snake (zodiac)|snake]], [[horse (zodiac)|horse]], [[sheep (zodiac)|sheep]] (or [[goat]]), [[monkey (zodiac)|monkey]], [[rooster (zodiac)|rooster]], [[dog (zodiac)|dog]], and [[pig (zodiac)|pig]] (or [[boar]]).

A [[legend]] explains the sequence in which the animals were assigned. Supposedly, the 12 animals fought over the precedence of the animals in the cycle of years in the calendar, so the Chinese gods held a contest to determine the order. All the animals lined up on the bank of a river and were given the task of getting to the opposite shore. Their order in the calendar would be set by the order in which the animals managed to reach the other side. The cat wondered how he would get across if he was afraid of water. At the same time, the ox wondered how he would cross with his poor eyesight. The calculating rat suggested that he and the cat jump onto the ox's back and guide him across. The ox was steady and hard-working so that he did not notice a commotion on his back. In the meanwhile, the rat sneaked up behind the unsuspecting cat and shoved him into the water. Just as the ox came ashore, the rat jumped off and finished the race first. The lazy pig came to the far shore in twelfth place. And so the rat got the first year named after him, the ox got the second year, and the pig ended up as the last year in the cycle. The cat finished too late to win any place in the calendar, and vowed to be the enemy of the rat forevermore.

=={{anchor|Jieqi}}Solar term==
{{Main|Solar term}}

Chinese months follow the phases of the moon. As a result, they do not accurately follow the seasons of the solar year. To assist farmers to decide when to plant or harvest crops, the drafters of the calendar put in 24 seasonal markers, which follow the solar year, and are called ''[[Jieqi|jiéqì]]'' ({{lang|zh|節氣}}).

The term ''Jiéqì'' is usually translated as &quot;Solar Terms&quot; (lit. Nodes of Weather). Each node is the instant when the sun reaches one of 24 equally spaced points along the [[ecliptic]], including the [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es, positioned at 15 [[degree (angle)|degree]] intervals. Because the calculation is solar-based, these ''jiéqì'' fall around the same date every year in [[solar calendar]]s (for example, the [[Gregorian Calendar]]), but do not form any obvious pattern in the Chinese calendar. The dates below are approximate and may vary slightly from year to year due to the intercalary rules (i.e. system of [[leap years]]) of the Gregorian calendar. ''Jiéqì'' are published each year in farmers' [[almanac]]s. [[Chinese New Year]] is usually the [[new moon]] closest to ''lìchūn''.

In the table below, these measures are given in the standard astronomical convention of [[ecliptic longitude]], zero degrees being positioned at the [[vernal equinox]] point. Each calendar month under the heading &quot;M&quot; contains the designated ''jiéqì'' called a principal term, which is an entry into a sign of the zodiac, also known as a cusp. Here ''term'' has the archaic meaning of a limit, not a duration. In Chinese astronomy, seasons are centered on the solstices and equinoxes, whereas in the standard Western definition, they begin at the solstices and equinoxes. Thus the term ''Beginning of Spring'' and the related Spring Festival fall in February, when it is still very chilly in temperate latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere.

==Holidays==
{{Main|Traditional Chinese holidays}}
The Chinese calendar year has nine main festivals, seven determined by the lunisolar calendar, and two derived from the solar agricultural calendar. (Farmers actually used a solar calendar, and its 24 terms, to determine when to plant crops, due to the inaccuracy of the lunisolar traditional calendar. However, the traditional calendar has also come to be known as the agricultural calendar.) The two special holidays are the [[Qingming Festival]] and the [[Dongzhi Festival|Winter Solstice Festival]], falling upon the respective solar terms, at ecliptic longitudes of 15° and 270°, respectively. As for all other calendrical calculations, the calculations use civil time in China, [[UTC+08]]

==Purpose of the intercalary months==
Most people, upon using or studying the Chinese calendar, are perplexed by the intercalary month because of its seemingly unpredictable nature. As mentioned above, the intercalary month refers to additional months added to the calendar in some years to correct for its deviation from the [[astronomical year]], a function similar to that of the extra day in February in leap years.

However, because of the complex astronomical knowledge required to calculate if and when an intercalary month needs to be inserted, to most people, it is simply a mystery. This has led to a superstition that intercalary months in certain times of the year bring bad luck.

The main purpose of the intercalary month is to correct for deviations of the calendrical year from the astronomical year. Because the Chinese calendar is mainly a lunar calendar, its standard year is 354 days, whereas the [[astronomical year]] is approximately 365¼ days. Without the intercalary month, this deviation would build up over time, and the Spring festival, for example, would no longer fall in Spring. Thus, the intercalary month serves a valuable purpose in ensuring that the year in the Chinese calendar remains approximately in line with the astronomical year.

The intercalary month is inserted whenever the Chinese calendar moves too far from the stage of progression of the earth in its orbit. Thus, for example, if the beginning of a certain month in the Chinese calendar deviates by a certain number of days from its equivalent in a solar calendar, an intercalary month needs to be inserted.

The practical benefit of this system is that the calendar is able to approximately keep in pace with the solar cycle, while at the same time retaining months that roughly correspond with lunar cycles. Hence the term ''lunisolar'' calendar. The latter is important because many traditional festivals correspond to significant events in the moon's cycle. For example, the mid-autumn festival is always on a day of the full moon.

==Relevance of the calendar today==
There have been calls for reform in recent years from experts in China, because of the increasing irrelevance of the Chinese calendar in modern life. They point to the example in Japan, where during the [[Meiji Restoration]] the nation adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]], and simply shifted all traditional festivities onto an equivalent date. However, the Chinese calendar remains important as an element of cultural tradition, and for certain cultural activities.

===Practical uses===
The original practical relevance of the lunisolar calendar for date marking has largely disappeared. First, the Gregorian calendar is much easier to compute and more in line with international standards. Its adoption for official purposes has meant that the traditional calendar is rarely used for date marking. This, in turn, means that it is more convenient to remember significant events such as birth dates by the Gregorian rather than the Chinese calendar.

Second, the 24 solar terms were important to farmers who would not be able to plan agricultural activities without foreknowledge of these terms. However, the 24 solar terms (including the [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es) are more predictable on the Gregorian calendar than the lunisolar calendar since they are based on the solar cycle. It is easier for the average Chinese farmer to organize their planting and harvesting with the Gregorian calendar.

However, one practical advantage of using a calendar where the months are lunar months is that the phases of the moon, and astronomical and tidal phenomena associated with them, such as spring and neap tides, fall on approximately the same day in each lunar month, and the times of high and low water and the tidal streams experienced in a certain location on a certain day of the lunar month are likely to be similar to those for the same place and lunar day in any month. For many years, therefore, mariners in East and South-East Asia have related their tidal observations to the Chinese calendar, so as to be able to provide quick, rule-of-thumb approximations of tides and tidal conditions from memory, based on the day of the Lunar month, without needing to refer to tide tables. Certain inshore passages on the China coast, for example, where there are strong tidal streams associated with spring tides, were regarded by mariners to be passable on certain days of the lunar month, and impassable on others.

===Cultural issues===
The Chinese calendar remains culturally essential today. For example, most of the traditional festivals, such as [[Chinese New Year]] and the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]], occur on new moons or full moons. The traditional Chinese calendar, as an element of traditional culture, has much cultural and nationalistic sentiment invested in it.

The calendar is still used in the more traditional Chinese households around the world to pick 'auspicious dates' for important events such as weddings, funerals, and business deals. A special calendar is used for this purpose, called ''Huang Li'' ({{zh|t={{linktext|皇|曆}}|s={{linktext|皇|历}}|p=huánglì|links=no}}), literally &quot;Imperial Calendar&quot;, which contains auspicious activities, times, and directions for each day. The calendar follows the Gregorian dates but has the corresponding Chinese dates. Every date would have a comprehensive listing of astrological measurements and fortune elements.

==Influence==
Other traditional [[East Asia]]n calendars are very similar to if not identical to the Chinese calendar: the [[Korean calendar]] is identical; the [[Tết|Vietnamese calendar]] substitutes the cat for the rabbit in the [[#Twelve animals|Chinese zodiac]]; the [[Tibetan calendar]] differs slightly in animal names, and the traditional [[Japanese calendar]] uses a different method of calculation, resulting in disagreements between the calendars in some years. The [[Thai lunar calendar]] also share a lot of similarities with the Chinese calendar.

The 12 year cycle, with the animal names translated into the vernacular, was adopted by the [[Göktürks]] (its use there is first attested 584), and spread subsequently among many if not most Turkic peoples, as well as the [[Mongols]]. [[Bulgar calendar|A similar]] calendar seems to have been used by the [[Bulgars]], as attested in the [[Nominalia of the Bulgarian Khans]] and in some other documents. The main differences between the Bulgar and the Chinese calendar are the different calculating system, the tiger has been replaced with a [[wolf]], and the dragon and monkey—with an unknown animal. Also, the Bulgar calendar is a solar one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro2001.net/issues/3_1997/7BR97F11.htm Перипетиите на календара, проф. Никола Николов]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese-Uighur calendar===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Iranian calendar]] --&gt;
In 1258, when both North China and the [[Islamic world]] were part of the [[Mongol Empire]], [[Hulagu Khan]] established an observatory in [[Maragheh]] for the astronomer [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] at which a few Chinese astronomers were present, resulting in the Chinese-Uighur calendar that al-Tusi describes in his ''[[Zij-i Ilkhani]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Benno van Dalen, E.S. Kennedy, Mustafa K. Saiyid, &quot;The Chinese-Uighur Calendar in Tusi's Zij-i Ilkhani&quot;, ''Zeitschrift für Geschichte der Arabisch-Islamischen Wissenschaften'' 11 (1997) 111–151.&lt;/ref&gt; The 12 year cycle, including Turkish/Mongolian translations of the animal names (known as ''sanawat-e turki'' سنوات ترکی,) remained in use for chronology, historiography, and bureaucratic purposes in the Persian and Turkish speaking world from Asia Minor to India and Mongolia throughout the Medieval and Early Modern periods. In Iran it remained common in agricultural records and tax assessments until [[Iranian calendar#Modern era from 1925|a 1925 law deprecated its use]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Customer relationship management (CRM)''' is a widely-implemented strategy for managing a company’s interactions with [[customers]], clients and sales prospects. It involves using technology to organize, automate, and synchronize business processes—principally [[sales]] activities, but also those for [[marketing]], [[customer service]], and [[technical support]]. The overall goals are to find, attract, and win new clients, nurture and retain those the company already has, entice former clients back into the fold, and reduce the costs of marketing and client service.&lt;ref name=hot&gt;Gartner, Inc. (6 June 2009) [http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?&amp;id=1004212 What's 'Hot' in CRM Applications in 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  Customer relationship management describes a company-wide business strategy including customer-interface departments as well as other departments.&lt;ref name=dest1&gt;DestinationCRM.com (2002) [http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/CRM-News/Daily-News/What-Is-CRM-46033.aspx What Is CRM?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of CRM==
The use of a CRM system will confer several advantages to a company:{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
*Quality and efficiency
*Decrease in overall costs
*Decision support
*Enterprise agility
*Customer Attention

==Challenges==
Successful development, implementation, use and support of customer relationship management systems can provide a significant advantage to the user, but often, there are obstacles that obstruct the user from using the system to its full potential.  Instances of a CRM attempting to contain a large, complex group of data can become cumbersome and difficult to understand for an ill-trained user.

Additionally, an interface that is difficult to navigate or understand can hinder the CRM’s effectiveness, causing users to pick and choose which areas of the system to be used, while others may be pushed aside.  This fragmented implementation can cause inherent challenges, as only certain parts are used and the system is not fully functional. The increased use of customer relationship management software has also led to an industry-wide shift in evaluating the role of the developer in designing and maintaining its software.  Companies are urged to consider the overall impact of a viable CRM software suite and the potential for good or harm in its use. 

===Complexity===
Tools and workflows can be complex, especially for large businesses. Previously these tools were generally limited to [[contact management]]: monitoring and recording interactions and communications.  Software solutions then expanded to embrace deal tracking, territories, opportunities, and the sales pipeline itself. Next came the advent of tools for other client-interface business functions, as described below.  These tools have been, and still are, offered as on-premises software that companies purchase and run on their own IT infrastructure.

===Poor usability===
One of the largest challenges that customer relationship management systems face is poor [[usability]].  With a difficult interface for a user to navigate, implementation can be fragmented or not entirely complete.

The importance of usability in a system has developed over time.&lt;ref&gt; Desbarats, Gus. 1995. &quot;Usability: form that says function.&quot; ''Industrial Management &amp; Data Systems'' 95, no. 5:3-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Customers are likely not as patient to work through malfunctions or gaps in user safety,&lt;ref&gt;Desbarats, Gus. 1995. &quot;Usability: form that says function.&quot; ''Industrial Management &amp; Data Systems'' 95, no. 5:3-6.&lt;/ref&gt; and there is an expectation that the usability of systems should be somewhat intuitive: “it helps make the machine an extension of the way I think &amp;mdash; not how it wants to me think.”

An intuitive design can prove most effective in developing the content and layout of a customer relationship management system.&lt;ref&gt;Hart-Davidson, William, Grace Bernhardt, Michael McLeod, Martine Rife, and Jeffrey T. Grabill. 2008. &quot;Coming to Content Management: Inventing Infrastructure for Organizational Knowledge Work.&quot; Technical Communication Quarterly 17, no. 1: 10-34 &lt;/ref&gt; Two 2008 case studies show that the layout of a system provides a strong correlation to the ease of use for a system and that it proved more beneficial for the design to focus on presenting information in a way that reflected the most important goals and tasks of the user, rather than the structure of the organization.&lt;ref&gt; Hart-Davidson, William, Grace Bernhardt, Michael McLeod, Martine Rife, and Jeffrey T. Grabill. 2008. &quot;Coming to Content Management: Inventing Infrastructure for Organizational Knowledge Work.&quot; Technical Communication Quarterly 17, no. 1: 10-34 &lt;/ref&gt; This “ease of service” is paramount for developing a system that is usable.&lt;ref&gt; Desbarats, Gus. 1995. Usability: form that says function. Industrial Management &amp; Data Systems 95, no. 5:3-6.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In many cases, the growth of capabilities and complexities of systems has hampered the usability of a customer relationship management system.  An overly complex computer system can result in an equally complex and non-friendly user interface, thus not allowing the system to work as fully intended.&lt;ref&gt;Desbarats, Gus. 1995. Usability: form that says function. Industrial Management &amp; Data Systems 95, no. 5:3-6. &lt;/ref&gt; This bloated software can appear sluggish and/or overwhelming to the user, keeping the system from full use and potential.  A series of 1998 research indicates that each item added to an information display can significantly affect the overall experience the user.&lt;ref&gt; Kostelnick, Charles. &quot;Conflicting Standards for Designing Data Displays: Following, Flouting, and Reconciling Them.&quot; Technical Communication 45, no. 4 (November 1998): 473 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Fragmentation===
Often, poor usability can lead to implementations that are fragmented &amp;mdash; isolated initiatives by individual departments to address their own needs. Systems that start disunited usually stay that way: [[siloed thinking]] and decision processes frequently lead to separate and incompatible systems, and dysfunctional processes.

A fragmented implementation can negate any financial benefit associated with a customer relationship management system, as companies choose not to use all the associated features factored when justifying the investment.&lt;ref&gt;Pennington, Lori L. 2007. &quot;Surviving the Design and Implementation of a Content-Management System.&quot; ''Journal of Business &amp; Technical Communication'' 21, no. 1:62-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it is important that support for the CRM system is companywide.&lt;ref&gt; Pennington, Lori L. 2007. &quot;Surviving the Design and Implementation of a Content-Management System.&quot; ''Journal of Business &amp; Technical Communication'' 21, no. 1:62-73.&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge of fragmented implementations may be mitigated with improvements in late-generation CRM systems.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim, David. &quot;CRM tools improve access, usability.&quot; (cover story). ''B to B 87'', no. 3 (March 11, 2002): 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business reputation===
Business reputation has become a growing challenge. The outcome of internal fragmentation that is observed and commented upon by customers is now visible to the rest of the world in the era of the social customer; in the past, only employees or partners were aware of it. Addressing the fragmentation requires a shift in philosophy and mindset in an organization so that everyone considers the impact to the customer of policy, decisions and actions. Human response at all levels of the organization can affect the customer experience for good or ill. Even one unhappy customer can deliver a body blow to a business.&lt;ref&gt;Mei Lin Fung, &quot;You can learn from Dell Hell, Dell did&quot; http://www.customerthink.com/article/you_can_learn_dell_hell_dell_did&lt;/ref&gt;

Some developments and shifts have made companies more conscious of the life-cycle of a customer relationship management system.&lt;ref&gt;Desbarats, Gus. 1995. Usability: form that says function. Industrial Management &amp; Data Systems 95, no. 5:3-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Companies now consider the possibility of brand loyalty and persistence of its users to purchase updates, upgrades and future editions of software.&lt;ref&gt; Desbarats, Gus. 1995. Usability: form that says function. Industrial Management &amp; Data Systems 95, no. 5:3-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, CRM systems face the challenge of producing viable financial profits, with a 2002 study suggesting that less than half of CRM projects are expected to provide a significant return on investment.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Harold. &quot;10 ways to avoid CRM pitfalls.&quot; ''B to B'' 86, no. 17 (September 17, 2001): 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Poor usability and low usage rates lead many companies to indicate that it was difficult to justify investment in the software without the potential for more tangible gains.&lt;ref&gt; Goldberg, Harold. &quot;10 ways to avoid CRM pitfalls.&quot; ''B to B'' 86, no. 17 (September 17, 2001): 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security concerns===
A large challenge faced by developers and users is found in striking a balance between ease of use in the CRM interface and suitable and acceptable security measures and features. Corporations investing in CRM software do so expecting a relative ease of use while also requiring that customer and other sensitive data remain secure.  This balance can be difficult, as many believe that improvements in security come at the expense of system usability.&lt;ref&gt;Ka-Ping, Yee. &quot;User Interaction Design for Secure Systems.&quot; ''Information and Communication Security'' 2513, no. (2002): 278-290. &lt;/ref&gt;

Research and study show the importance of designing and developing technology that balances a positive user interface with security features that meet industry and corporate standards.&lt;ref&gt;Cieslak, David, and Bob Gaby. &quot;Programs Provide Extensive Tools For Adaptability And Customization.&quot; ''CPA Technology Advisor'' 16, no. 8 (December 2006): 38.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 study shows, however, that security and usability can coexist harmoniously.&lt;ref&gt;Ka-Ping, Yee. &quot;User Interaction Design for Secure Systems.&quot; ''Information and Communication Security'' 2513, no. (2002): 278-290.&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, a secure CRM system can become more usable.

Researchers have argued that, in most cases, security breaches are the result of user-error (such as unintentionally downloading and executing a computer virus). In these events, the computer system acted as it should in identifying a file and then, following the user’s orders to execute the file, exposed the computer and network to a harmful virus.  Researchers argue that a more usable system creates less confusion and lessens the amount of potentially harmful errors, in turn creating a more secure and stable CRM system.&lt;ref&gt;Ka-Ping, Yee. &quot;User Interaction Design for Secure Systems.&quot; ''Information and Communication Security'' 2513, no. (2002): 278-290. &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Technical writer]]s can play a large role in developing customer relationship management systems that are secure and easy to use.  A series of 2008 research shows that CRM systems, among others, need to be more open to flexibility of technical writers, allowing these professionals to become content builders.&lt;ref&gt; Whittemore, Stewart. &quot;Metadata and Memory: Lessons from the Canon of Memoria for the Design of Content Management Systems.&quot; ''Technical Communication Quarterly'' 17, no. 1 (Winter 2008): 88-109. &lt;/ref&gt;  These professionals can then gather information and use it at their preference, developing a system that allows users to easily access desired information and is secure and trusted by its users.

==Types/variations==
===Sales force automation===
[[Sales force automation]] (SFA) involves using software to streamline all phases of the sales process, minimizing the time that sales representatives need to spend on each phase. This allows a business to use fewer sales representatives to manage their clients. At the heart of SFA is a [[contact management system]] for tracking and recording every stage in the sales process for each prospective client, from initial contact to final disposition. Many SFA applications also include insights into opportunities, territories, sales forecasts and workflow automation, quote generation, and product knowledge. Modules for Web 2.0 e-commerce and pricing are new, emerging interests in SFA.&lt;ref name=hot/&gt;

===Marketing===
CRM systems for marketing help the enterprise identify and target potential clients and generate leads for the sales team. A key marketing capability is tracking and measuring multichannel campaigns, including email, search, social media, telephone and direct mail. Metrics monitored include clicks, responses, leads, deals, and revenue. Alternatively, Prospect Relationship Management (PRM) solutions offer to track customer behaviour and nurture them from first contact to sale, often cutting out the active sales process altogether.

In a web-focused marketing CRM solution, organizations create and track specific web activities that help develop the client relationship. These activities may include such activities as free downloads, online video content, and online web presentations.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Customer service and support===
Recognizing that service is an important factor in attracting and retaining customers, organizations are increasingly turning to technology to help them improve their clients’ experience while aiming to increase efficiency and minimize costs.&lt;ref name=sap1&gt;SAP Insider (15 November 2007) [http://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/scn/go/portal/prtroot/docs/library/uuid/e044e180-8375-2a10-a2b2-b5709ea68ccb Still Struggling to Reduce Call Center Costs Without Losing Customers?]&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, a 2009 study revealed that only 39% of corporate executives believe their employees have the right tools and authority to solve client problems.&lt;ref&gt;Strativity Group, Inc. (2009) [http://www.strativity.com/products/2009-05-26.aspx Global Customer Experience Management Benchmark Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appointment===
Creating and scheduling appointments with customers is a central activity of most customer oriented businesses.   Sales, customer support, and service personnel regularly spend a portion of their time getting in touch with customers and prospects through a variety of means to agree on a time and place for meeting for a sales conversation or to deliver customer service.   Appointment CRM is a relatively new CRM platform category in which an automated system is used to offer a suite of suitable appointment times to a customer via e-mail or through a web site.   An automated process is used to schedule and confirm the appointment, and place it on the appropriate person's calendar.   Appointment CRM systems can be an origination point for a sales lead and are generally integrated with sales and marketing CRM systems to capture and store the interaction.  

===Analytics===
Relevant analytics capabilities are often interwoven into applications for sales, marketing, and service. These features can be complemented and augmented with links to separate, purpose-built applications for analytics and business intelligence. Sales analytics let companies monitor and understand client actions and preferences, through sales forecasting and data quality.

Marketing applications generally come with [[predictive analytics]] to improve segmentation and targeting, and features for measuring the effectiveness of online, offline, and search marketing campaigns. Web analytics have evolved significantly from their starting point of merely tracking mouse clicks on Web sites. By evaluating “buy signals,” marketers can see which prospects are most likely to transact and also identify those who are bogged down in a sales process and need assistance.  Marketing and finance personnel also use analytics to assess the value of multi-faceted programs as a whole.

These types of analytics are increasing in popularity as companies demand greater visibility into the performance of call centers and other service and support channels,&lt;ref name=sap1/&gt; in order to correct problems before they affect satisfaction levels. Support-focused applications typically include dashboards similar to those for sales, plus capabilities to measure and analyze response times, service quality, agent performance, and the frequency of various issues.

===Integrated/Collaborative===
Departments within enterprises — especially large enterprises — tend to function with little collaboration.&lt;ref name=insidecrm1&gt;InsideCRM (2007) [http://www.insidecrm.com/features/collaborative-crm-112907/ Get It Together with Collaborative CRM]&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, the development and adoption of these tools and services have fostered greater fluidity and cooperation among sales,  service, and marketing. This finds expression in the concept of collaborative systems that use technology to build bridges between departments. For example, feedback from a [[technical support]] center can enlighten marketers about specific services and product features clients are asking for. Reps, in their turn, want to be able to pursue these opportunities without the burden of re-entering records and contact data into a separate SFA system.

===Small business===
For [[small business]], basic client service can be accomplished by a contact manager system: an integrated solution that lets organizations and individuals efficiently track and record interactions, including emails, documents, jobs, faxes, scheduling, and more. These tools usually focus on accounts rather than on individual contacts. They also generally include opportunity insight for tracking sales pipelines plus added functionality for marketing and service.  As with larger enterprises, small businesses are finding value in online solutions, especially for mobile and [[telecommuting]] workers,

===Social media===
[[Social media]] sites like [[Twitter]], [[LinkedIn]] and [[Facebook]] are amplifying the voice of people in the marketplace and are having profound and far-reaching effects on the ways in which people buy. Customers can now research companies online and then ask for recommendations through social media channels, making their buying decision without contacting the company.

People also use social media to share opinions and experiences on companies, products and services. As social media is not as widely moderated or censored as mainstream media, individuals can say anything they want about a company or brand, positive or negative.

Increasingly, companies are looking to gain access to these conversations and take part in the dialogue. More than a few systems are now integrating to social networking sites. Social media promoters cite a number of business advantages, such as using online communities as a source of high-quality leads and a vehicle for [[crowd sourcing]] solutions to client-support problems. Companies can also leverage client stated habits and preferences to &quot;hyper-target&quot; their sales and marketing communications.&lt;ref name=dest2&gt;DestinationCRM.com (2009) [http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Editorial/Magazine-Features/Who-Owns-the-Social-Customer-54028.aspx  Who Owns the Social Customer?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts take the view that business-to-business marketers should proceed cautiously when weaving social media into their business processes. These observers recommend careful market research to determine if and where the phenomenon can provide measurable benefits for client interactions, sales and support.&lt;ref&gt;Clara Shih, DestinationCRM.com (2009) [http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Editorial/Magazine-Features/Sales-and-Social-Media-No-One%e2%80%99s-Social-(Yet)-54767.aspx Sales and Social Media: No One’s social (Yet)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is stated{{by whom|date=November 2010}} that people feel their interactions are peer-to-peer between them and their contacts, and resent company involvement, sometimes responding with negatives about that company.

===Non-profit and membership-based===
Systems for non-profit and membership-based organizations help track constituents and their involvement in the organization. Capabilities typically include tracking the following: fund-raising, demographics, membership levels, membership directories, volunteering and communications with individuals.

Many include tools for identifying potential donors based on previous donations and participation.  In light of the growth of social networking tools, there may be some overlap between social/community driven tools and non-profit/membership tools.

==Strategy==
For larger-scale enterprises, a complete and detailed plan is required to obtain the funding, resources, and company-wide support that can make the initiative of choosing and implementing a system successfully. Benefits must be defined, risks assessed, and cost quantified in three general areas:

*Processes: Though these systems have many technological components, business processes lie at its core. It can be seen as a more client-centric way of doing business, enabled by technology that consolidates and intelligently distributes pertinent information about clients, sales, marketing effectiveness, responsiveness, and market trends. Therefore, a company must analyze its business workflows and processes before choosing a technology platform; some will likely need re-engineering to better serve the overall goal of winning and satisfying clients. Moreover, planners need to determine the types of client information that are most relevant, and how best to employ them.&lt;ref name=dest1/&gt;

*People: For an initiative to be effective, an organization must convince its staff that the new technology and workflows will benefit employees as well as clients. Senior executives need to be strong and visible advocates who can clearly state and support the case for change. Collaboration, teamwork, and two-way communication should be encouraged across hierarchical boundaries, especially with respect to process improvement.&lt;ref&gt;TechTarget (2009) [http://searchcrm.techtarget.com/feature/CRM-strategy-checklist-Planning-for-CRM-and-customer-service-success?offer=briefcaseCRM Strategy Checklist: Planning for CRM and Customer Service Success]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Technology: In evaluating technology, key factors include alignment with the company’s business process strategy and goals, including the ability to deliver the right data to the right employees and sufficient ease of adoption and use. Platform selection is best undertaken by a carefully chosen group of executives who understand the business processes to be automated as well as the software issues. Depending upon the size of the company and the breadth of data, choosing an application can take anywhere from a few weeks to a year or more.&lt;ref name=dest1/&gt;

==Implementation==
===Implementation issues===
Increases in revenue, higher rates of client satisfaction, and significant savings in operating costs are some of the benefits to an enterprise.  Proponents emphasize that technology should be implemented only in the context of careful strategic and operational planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''Passionate and Profitable''|author= Lior Arussy|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2005|chapter=Understanding the Fatal Mistakes|isbn=0471721344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementations almost invariably fall short when one or more facets of this prescription are ignored:

* Poor planning: Initiatives can easily fail when efforts are limited to choosing and deploying software, without an accompanying rationale, context, and support for the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=''Avoid the Four Perils of CRM''|coauthors=, Darrell K.Rigby; Frederick F. Reichheld, Phil Schefter,|journal=Harvard Business Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances, enterprises simply automate flawed client-facing processes rather than redesign them according to best practices.
* Poor integration: For many companies, integrations are piecemeal initiatives that address a glaring need: improving a particular client-facing process or two or automating a favored sales or client support channel.&lt;ref name=sap2&gt;SAP white paper (2003) [http://www.sap.com/about/newsroom/press.epx?PressID=6250 CRM Without Compromise]&lt;/ref&gt;  Such “point solutions” offer little or no integration or alignment with a company’s overall strategy. They offer a less than complete client view and often lead to unsatisfactory user experiences.
* Toward a solution: overcoming siloed thinking. Experts advise organizations to recognize the immense value of integrating their client-facing operations. In this view, internally-focused, department-centric views should be discarded in favor of reorienting processes toward information-sharing across marketing, sales, and service. For example, sales representatives need to know about current issues and relevant marketing promotions before attempting to cross-sell to a specific client. Marketing staff should be able to leverage client information from sales and service to better target campaigns and offers. And support agents require quick and complete access to a client’s sales and service history.&lt;ref name=sap2/&gt;

===Adoption issues===
Historically, the landscape is littered with instances of low adoption rates. Many of the challenges listed above offer a glimpse into some of the obstacles that corporations implementing a CRM suite face; in many cases time, resources and staffing do not allow for the troubleshooting necessary to tackle an issue and the system is shelved or sidestepped instead.

===Statistics===
In 2003, a Gartner report estimated that more than $1 billion had been spent on software that was not being used. More recent research indicates that the problem, while perhaps less severe, is a long way from being solved. According to ''CSO Insights'', less than 40 percent of 1,275 participating companies had end-user adoption rates above 90 percent.&lt;ref name=dickie&gt;Jim Dickie, ''CSO Insights'' (2006) [http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Columns-Departments/Reality-Check/Demystifying-CRM-Adoption-Rates-42496.aspx Demystifying CRM Adoption Rates]&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial or fragmented basis, thus missing opportunities for effective marketing and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt; Joachim, David. &quot;CRM tools improve access, usability.&quot; (cover story). ''B to B'' 87, no. 3 (March 11, 2002): 1 &lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 survey from the U.K., four-fifths of senior executives reported that their biggest challenge is getting their staff to use the systems they had installed. Further, 43 percent of respondents said they use less than half the functionality of their existing system; 72 percent indicated they would trade functionality for ease of use; 51 percent cited data synchronization as a major issue; and 67 percent said that finding time to evaluate systems was a major problem.&lt;ref name=sims&gt;David Sims, TMC.net (2007) [http://blog.tmcnet.com/telecom-crm/2007/11/30/crm-adoption-biggest-problem-in-83-percent-of-cases-wigan-gets-crm-tre.asp CRM Adoption ‘Biggest Problem’ in 83 Percent of Cases]&lt;/ref&gt;  With expenditures expected to exceed $11 billion in 2010,&lt;ref name=sims/&gt; enterprises need to address and overcome persistent adoption challenges. 

The amount of time needed for the development and implementation of a customer relationship management system can prove costly to the implementation as well. Research indicates that implementation timelines that are greater than 90 days in length run an increased risk in the CRM system failing to yield successful results.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Harold. &quot;10 ways to avoid CRM pitfalls.&quot; ''B to B'' 86, no. 17 (September 17, 2001): 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increasing usage and adoption rates===
Specialists offer these recommendations&lt;ref name=dickie/&gt; for boosting adoptions rates and coaxing users to blend these tools into their daily workflow:

* Choose a system that is easy to use: Not all solutions are created equal; some vendors offer applications that are more user-friendly &amp;mdash; a factor that should be as important to the decision as is functionality.
* Choose appropriate capabilities: Employees need to know that the time they invest in learning and in using the new system will not be wasted, indeed that it will yield &quot;personal&quot; advantages; otherwise, they will ignore or circumvent the system.
* Provide training: Changing the way people work is no small task; to be successful, some familiarization training and help-desk support are usually required, even with today’s more usable systems.
* Lead by example: Upper management must use the new application themselves, thereby showing employees that the top leaders fully support the application or else it will skew the ultimate course of the initiative toward failure, by risking a greatly reduced rate of adoption by employees.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Additionally, researchers found the following themes were common in systems that users evaluated favorably.  These positive evaluations led to the increased use and more thorough implementation of the CRM system. Further recommendations include&lt;ref&gt;Cappel, James J., and Huang Zhenyu. &quot;A Usability Analysis of Company Websites.&quot; ''Journal of Computer Information Systems'' 48, no. 1 (Fall2007 2007): 117-123.&lt;/ref&gt;

* “Breadcrumb Trail”: This offers the user a path, usually at the top of a web or CRM page, to return to the starting point of navigation. This can prove useful for users who might find themselves lost or unsure how they got to the current screen in the CRM.
* Readily available search engine boxes: Research shows that users are quick to seek immediate results through the use of a search engine box. A CRM that uses a search box will keep assistance and immediate results quickly within the reach of a user.
* [[Help Option Menu]]: An outlet for quick assistance or frequently asked questions can provide users with a lifeline that makes the customer relationship management software easier to use. Researchers suggest making this resource a large component of the CRM during the development stage.

A larger theme is found in that the responsiveness, intuitive design and overall usability of a system can influence the users’ opinions and preferences of systems.&lt;ref&gt; Gefen, David, and Catherine M. Ridings. &quot;Implementation Team Responsiveness and User Evaluation of Customer Relationship Management: A Quasi-Experimental Design Study of Social Exchange Theory.&quot; ''Journal of Management Information Systems'' 19, no. 1 (Summer 2002): 47-69. &lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers noted a strong correlation between the design and layout of a user interface and the perceived level of trust from the user.&lt;ref&gt; Roy, Marie Christine; Dewit, Olivier; Aubert, Benoit A. 2001. &quot;The impact of interface usability on trust in Web retailers.&quot; ''Internet Research'' 11, no. 5:388-398.&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers found that users felt more comfortable on a system evaluated as usable and applied that comfort and trust into increased use and adoption.

===Help menus===
One of the largest issues surrounding the implementation and adoption of a CRM comes in the perceived lack of technical and user support in using the system.  Individual users &amp;mdash; and large corporations &amp;mdash; find themselves equally stymied by a system that is not easily understood.  Technical support in the form of a qualified and comprehensive help menu can provide significant improvement in implementation when providing focused, context-specific information.&lt;ref&gt; Grayling, Trevor. &quot;Fear and loathing of the help menu: A usability test of online help.&quot; ''Technical Communication'' 45, no. 2 (May 1998): 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Data show that CRM users are oftentimes unwilling to consult a help menu if it is not easily accessible and immediate in providing assistance.&lt;ref&gt; Grayling, Trevor. &quot;Fear and loathing of the help menu: A usability test of online help.&quot; ''Technical Communication'' 45, no. 2 (May 1998): 168.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1998 case study found that users would consult the help menu for an average of two or three screens, abandoning the assistance if desired results weren’t found by that time.&lt;ref&gt; Grayling, Trevor. &quot;Fear and loathing of the help menu: A usability test of online help.&quot; ''Technical Communication'' 45, no. 2 (May 1998): 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers believe that help menus can provide assistance to users through introducing additional screenshots and other visual and interactive aids.&lt;ref&gt; Gellevij, Mark, and Hans Van Der Meij. &quot;Empirical Proof for Presenting Screen Captures in Software Documentation.&quot; ''Technical Communication'' 51, no. 2 (May 2004): 224-238. &lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 case study concluded that the proper use of screenshots can significantly support a user’s “developing a mental model of the program” and help in “identifying and locating window elements and objects.”&lt;ref&gt; Gellevij, Mark, and Hans Van Der Meij. &quot;Empirical Proof for Presenting Screen Captures in Software Documentation.&quot; ''Technical Communication'' 51, no. 2 (May 2004): 224-238. &lt;/ref&gt; This research concluded that screen shots allowed users to “learn more, make fewer mistakes, and learn in a shorter time frame,” which can certainly assist in increasing the time frame for full implementation of a CRM system with limited technical or human support.&lt;ref&gt; Gellevij, Mark, and Hans Van Der Meij. &quot;Empirical Proof for Presenting Screen Captures in Software Documentation.&quot; ''Technical Communication'' 51, no. 2 (May 2004): 224-238. &lt;/ref&gt;

Experts have identified five characteristics to make a help menu effective:&lt;ref&gt; Grayling, Trevor. &quot;If We Build It, Will They Come? A Usability Test of Two Browser-based Embedded Help Systems.&quot; ''Technical Communication'' 49, no. 2 (May 2002): 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

* “context-specific” &amp;mdash; the help menu contains only the information relevant to the topic that is being discussed or sought
* “useful“ &amp;mdash; in conjunction with being context-specific, the help menu must be comprehensive in including all of the information that the user seeks
* “obvious to invoke“ &amp;mdash; the user must have no trouble in locating the help menu or how to gain access to its contents
* “non-intrusive“ &amp;mdash; the help menu must not interfere with the user’s primary path of work and must maintain a distance that allows for its use only when requested
* “easily available“ &amp;mdash; the information of the help menu must be accessible with little or few steps required

==Development==
Thoughtful and thorough development can avoid many of the challenges and obstacles faced in using and implementing a customer relationship management system.  With shifts in competition and the increasing reliance by corporations to use a CRM system, development of software has become more important than ever &lt;ref&gt; Desbarats, Gus. 1995. Usability: form that says function. Industrial Management &amp; Data Systems 95, no. 5:3-6 &lt;/ref&gt;.  Technical communicators can play a significant role in developing software that is usable and easy to navigate &lt;ref&gt; Whittemore, Stewart. &quot;Metadata and Memory: Lessons from the Canon of Memoria for the Design of Content Management Systems.&quot; Technical Communication Quarterly 17, no. 1 (Winter2008 2008): 88-109 &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Clarity===
One of the largest issues in developing a usable customer relationship management system comes in the form of clear and concise presentation.  Developers are urged to consider the importance of creating software that is easy to understand and without unnecessary confusion, thus allowing a user to navigate the system with ease and confidence.

Strong writing skills can prove extremely beneficial for software development and creation.  A 1998 case study showed that software engineering majors who successfully completed a technical writing course created capstone experience projects that were more mindful of end user design than the projects completed by their peers &lt;ref&gt; Mirel, Barbara, and Leslie A. Olsen. &quot;Social and cognitive effects of professional communication on software usability.&quot; Technical Communication Quarterly 7, no. 2 (Spring98 1998): 197 &lt;/ref&gt;.  The case study yielded significant results:

* Students who completed the technical writing course submitted capstone projects that contained more vivid and explicit detail in writing than their peers who did not complete the course.  Researchers note that the students appeared to weigh multiple implications on the potential user, and explained their decisions more thoroughly than their peers.
* Those participating in the writing course sought out test users more frequently to add a perspective outside their own as developer.  Students appeared sensitive of the user’s ability to understand the developed software.
* The faculty member overseeing the capstone submissions felt that students who did not enroll in the technical writing class were at a significant disadvantage when compared to their peers who did register for the course.

In the case study, researchers argue for the inclusion of technical writers in the development process of software systems.  These professionals can offer insight into usability in communication for software projects &lt;ref&gt; Mirel, Barbara, and Leslie A. Olsen. &quot;Social and cognitive effects of professional communication on software usability.&quot; Technical Communication Quarterly 7, no. 2 (Spring98 1998): 197 &lt;/ref&gt;.  Technical writing can help build a unified resource for successful documentation, training and execution of customer relationship management systems &lt;ref&gt; Pennington, Lori L. 2007. Surviving the Design and Implementation of a Content-Management System. Journal of Business &amp; Technical Communication 21, no. 1:62-73 &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Test users===
In many circumstances, test users play a significant role in developing software.  These users offer software developers an outside perspective of the project, oftentimes helping developers gain insight into potential areas of trouble that might have been overlooked or passed over because of familiarity with the system.  Test users can also provide feedback from a targeted audience: a software development team creating a customer relationship management software system for higher education can have a user with a similar profile explore the technology, offering opportunities to cater the further development of the system.  Test users help developers discover which areas of the software perform well, and which areas require further attention &lt;ref&gt; Høegh, Rune Thaarup, and Janne Jul Jensen. &quot;A case study of three software projects: can software developers anticipate the usability problems in their software?.&quot; Behaviour &amp; Information Technology 27, no. 4 (July 2008): 307-312. &lt;/ref&gt;.

Research notes that test users can prove to be most effective in providing developers a structured overview of the software creation &lt;ref&gt; Høegh, Rune Thaarup, and Janne Jul Jensen. &quot;A case study of three software projects: can software developers anticipate the usability problems in their software?.&quot; Behaviour &amp; Information Technology 27, no. 4 (July 2008): 307-312. &lt;/ref&gt;.  These users can provide a fresh perspective that can reflect on the state of the CRM development without the typically narrow or invested focus of a software developer.

A 2007 study suggests some important steps are needed in creating a quality and effective test environment for software development &lt;ref&gt; Høegh, R. Th. &quot;Case study: integrating usability activities in a software development process.&quot; Behaviour &amp; Information Technology 27, no. 4 (July 2008): 301-306. &lt;/ref&gt;.  In this case study, researchers observed a Danish software company in the midst of new creating new software with usability in mind.  The study found these four observations most appropriate:

* The developers must make a conscious effort and commitment to the test user.  Researchers note that the company had dedicated specific research space and staff focused exclusively on usability.
* Usability efforts must carry equal concern in the eyes of developers as other technology-related concerns in the creation stage.  The study found that test users became discouraged when items flagged as needing attention were marked as lower priority by the software developers.
* Realistic expectations from both test users and software developers help maintain a productive environment.  Researchers note that developers began to limit seeking input from test users after the test users suggested remedies the developers felt were improbable, leading the developers to believe consulting the test users would only prove to be more work.
* Developers must make themselves available to test users and colleagues alike throughout the creation process of a software system.  

The researchers note that some of the best instances of usability adjustments can be made through casual conversation, and that oftentimes usability is bypassed by developers because these individuals never think to consult test users.
Allowing users to test developing products can have its limits in effectiveness, as the culture of the industry and desired outcomes can affect the effect on CRM creation &lt;ref&gt; Iivari, N. &quot;‘Representing the User’ in software development—a cultural analysis of usability work in the product development context.&quot; Interacting with Computers 18, no. 4 (July 2006): 635-664 &lt;/ref&gt;, as a 2008 case study suggests that the responsiveness of test users can vary dramatically depending on the industry and field of the user.   
Research suggests that test users can rate the importance or severity of potential software issues in a significantly different fashion than software developers &lt;ref&gt; Høegh, Rune Thaarup, and Janne Jul Jensen. &quot;A case study of three software projects: can software developers anticipate the usability problems in their software?.&quot; Behaviour &amp; Information Technology 27, no. 4 (July 2008): 307-312. &lt;/ref&gt;.  Similarly so, researchers note the potential for costly delay if developers spend too much time attempting to coerce hesitant test users from participating &lt;ref&gt; Høegh, R. Th. &quot;Case study: integrating usability activities in a software development process.&quot; Behaviour &amp; Information Technology 27, no. 4 (July 2008): 301-306. &lt;/ref&gt;.

Additionally, involving too many test users can prove cumbersome and delay the development of a CRM system &lt;ref&gt; Høegh, R. Th. &quot;Case study: integrating usability activities in a software development process.&quot; Behaviour &amp; Information Technology 27, no. 4 (July 2008): 301-306. &lt;/ref&gt;.   Additional research notes that test users may be able to identify an area that proves challenging in a software system, but might have difficulty explaining the outcome.  A related 2007 case study noted that test users were able to describe roughly a third of the usability problems &lt;ref&gt; Høegh, Rune Thaarup, and Janne Jul Jensen. &quot;A case study of three software projects: can software developers anticipate the usability problems in their software?.&quot; Behaviour &amp; Information Technology 27, no. 4 (July 2008): 307-312. &lt;/ref&gt;.  Further, the language used by test users in many circumstances proves to be quite general and lacking the specific nature needed by developers to enact real change.

== Privacy and data security system==
One of the primary functions of these tools is to collect information about clients, thus a company must consider the desire for  privacy and [[data security]], as well as the legislative and cultural norms. Some clients prefer assurances that their data will not be shared with third parties without their prior consent and that safeguards are in place to prevent illegal access by third parties.

Many CRM vendors offer Web-based tools ([[cloud computing]]) and [[software as a service]] (SaaS), which are accessed via a secure Internet connection and displayed in a Web browser. These applications are sold as subscriptions, with customers not needing to invest in purchasing and maintaining IT hardware, and subscription fees are a fraction of the cost of purchasing software outright.

The era of the &quot;social customer&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Paul,  CRM at the Speed of Light, McGraw Hill 4th Edition, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the use of social media (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Yelp, customer reviews in Amazon etc) by customers in ways that allow other potential customers to glimpse real world experience of current customers with the seller's products and services. This shift increases the power of customers to make purchase decisions that are informed by other parties sometimes outside of the control of the seller or seller's network. In response, CRM philosophy and strategy has shifted to encompass social networks and user communities, podcasting, and personalization in addition to internally generated marketing, advertising and webpage design. With the spread of self-initiated customer reviews, the user experience of a product or service requires increased attention to design and simplicity, as customer expectations have risen. CRM as a philosophy and strategy is growing to encompass these broader components of the customer relationship, so that businesses may anticipate and innovate to better serve customers, referred to as &quot;[[Social CRM]]&quot;.

Another related development is [[Vendor Relationship Management]], or VRM, which is the customer-side counterpart of CRM: tools and services that equip customers to be both independent of vendors and better able to engage with them. VRM development has grown out of efforts by ProjectVRM at Harvard's [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] and [[Identity Commons]]' Internet Identity Workshops, as well as by a growing number of startups and established companies. VRM was the subject of a cover story in the May 2010 issue of ''CRM'' Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.destinationcrm.com/Issue/1776-May-2010.htm] ''CRM Magazine'': May, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 research note, META Group (now [[Gartner]]) analyst Doug Laney first proposed, defined and coined the term [[Extended Relationship Management]]. He defined [[XRM]] as the principle and practice of applying CRM disciplines and technologies to other core enterprise constituents, primarily partners, employees and suppliers...as well as other secondary allies including government, press, and industry consortia.
