==Heritage sites of national significance==
[[File:Stadtkirche Aarau.jpg|thumb|City Church]]
Aarau is home to a number of sites that are listed as Swiss [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage sites of national significance]].  The list includes three churches; the [[Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland|Christian Catholic]] parish house, the Catholic parish house, and the Reformed ''City Church''.  There are five government buildings on the list; the Cantonal Library and Art Gallery, the old Cantonal School, the Legislature, the Cantonal Administration building, and the archives.  Three gardens or parks are on the list; ''Garten Schmidlin'', ''Naturama Aargau'' and the ''Schlossgarten''.  The remaining four buildings on the list are; the former Rickenbach Factory, the Crematorium, the ''Haus zum Erker'' at Rathausgasse 10 and the ''Restaurant Zunftstube'' at Pelzgasse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar.html Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance] 21.11.2008 version, {{de icon}} accessed 22-Jan-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
From the {{as of|2000|alt=2000 census}}, 4,473 or 28.9% are [[Roman Catholic]], while 6,738 or 43.6% belonged to the [[Swiss Reformed Church]].  Of the rest of the population, there are 51 individuals (or about 0.33% of the population) who belong to the [[Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland|Christian Catholic]] faith.&lt;ref name=zahlen&gt;[http://www.ag.ch/staag/ Statistical Department of Canton Aargau – Aargauer Zahlen 2009] {{de icon}} accessed 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
===Legislative===
In place of a town meeting, a town assembly (''Einwohnerrat'') of 50 members is elected by the citizens, and follows the policy of [[proportional representation]].  It is responsible for approving tax levels, preparing the annual account, and the business report.  In addition, it can issue regulations.  The term of office is four years.  In the last two elections the parties had the following representation:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- bgcolor=&quot;#EFEFEF&quot;
! '''Party'''
! '''2001'''

|-
| [[Green Party of Switzerland|Green]] || 2 || 4
|-
| [[Evangelical People's Party of Switzerland|EVP]] || 3 || 3
|-
| JETZT! || 1 || 2
|}
At the district level, some elements of the government remain a direct democracy.  There are optional and obligatory referendums, and the population retains the right to establish an initiative.

===Executive===
The executive authority is the town council (''Stadtrat'').  The term of office is four years, and its members are elected by a [[plurality voting system]].  It leads and represents the municipality.  It carries out the resolutions of the assembly, and those requested by the canton and national level governments.

The seven members (and their party) for the period 2006–2009 are:
* Dr. Marcel Guignard (FDP) (City President)
* Beat Blattner (SP) (City Vice President)
* Jolanda Urech (SP)
* Rudolf Zinniker (FDP)
* Lukas Pfisterer (FDP)
* Carlo Mettauer (CVP)
* Michael Ganz (Pro Aarau)

===National elections===
In the 2007 [[Swiss federal election, 2007|federal election]] the most popular party was the SP which received 27.9% of the vote.  The next three most popular parties were the SVP (22.1%), the [[Free Democratic Party of Switzerland|FDP]] (17.5%) and the Green Party (11.8%).&lt;ref name=SFSO/&gt;

==Coat of arms==
The [[blazon]] of the municipal [[coat of arms]] is ''Argent an Eagle displayed Sable beaked langued and membered Gules and a Chief of the last.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fotw.us/flags/ch-ag001.html Flags of the World.com] accessed 22-January-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aargau''' ([[German language|German]] {{Audio|De-Aargau.ogg|'''Aargau'''}}; rarely anglicized '''Argovia''') is one of the more northerly [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of [[Switzerland]]. It comprises the lower course of the [[river]] [[Aare]], which is why the canton is called Aar-[[Gau (country subdivision)|gau]] (meaning ''Aare district'').

==History==
[[File:Aarau Altstadt.jpg|thumb|right|Aarau]]
In early medieval times, ''Argovia'' or ''Argowe'' was a disputed border region between the duchies of [[Alamannia]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. A line of the von [[Wetterau]] ([[Conradines]]) intermittently held the countship of Aargau from 750 until about 1030, when they lost it (having in the meantime taken the name [[von]] [[Tegerfelden]]). From the extinction of the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] dynasty in 1254 until 1415, the area was ruled by the [[Habsburgs]], and many castles from that time still stand (examples include [[Habsburg Castle|Habsburg]], [[Schloss Lenzburg|Lenzburg]], Tegerfelden, Bobikon, Stin and Wildegg). The Habsburgs founded a number of monasteries (with some structures enduring, e.g., in [[Wettingen Abbey|Wettingen]] and [[Muri Abbey|Muri]]), the closing of which by the government in 1841 was a contributing factor to the outbreak of the Swiss civil war - the &quot;[[Sonderbund War]]&quot; - in 1847.

In 1415, the Aargau was taken from the Habsburgs by the Swiss Confederates. [[Bern]] kept the southwest portion ([[Zofingen]], [[Aarburg]], [[Aarau]], [[Lenzburg]], and [[Brugg]]). Some districts, named the ''Freie Ämter'' or ''free bailiwicks'' ([[Mellingen]], [[Muri]], [[Villmergen]], and [[Bremgarten (district)|Bremgarten]]), with the countship of Baden, were governed as &quot;subject lands&quot; by all or some of the Confederates.

French forces occupied Aargau from 10 March to 18 April 1798; thereafter the Bernese portion became the canton of Aargau in the [[Helvetic Republic]] and the remainder formed the [[Canton of Baden]]. In 1803, the two halves were united under the name of canton of Aargau,&lt;ref&gt;Bridgwater, W. &amp; Beatrice Aldrich. (1966) ''The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia''. Columbia University. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; which was then admitted as a full member of the reconstituted Confederation. [[Fricktal]], ceded in 1802 by [[Austria]] via Napoleonic France to the Helvetic Republic, was briefly a separate Swiss canton under a ''[[Statthalter]]'' ('Lieutenant'), but on 9 March 1803 was incorporated in the canton of Aargau.

The chief magistracy of Aargau changed its style repeatedly:
* first two consecutive ''[[Regierungsstatthalter]]'' :
** April 1798 - November 1801 Jakob Emmanuel Feer (b. 1754 - d. 1833)
** 1802 - 1803 Johann Heinrich Rothpletz (b. 1766 - d. 1833)
* Presidents of the Government Commission
** 10 March 1803 - 26 April 1803 Johann Rudolf Dolder (b. 1753 - d. 1807)
** 26 April 1803 - 1815 a 'Small Council' (president rotating monthly)
* annual ''[[Amtsbürgermeister]]'' 1815-1831
* annual ''[[Landammänner]]'' since 1815

In the year 2003, the canton of Aargau celebrated its 200th anniversary.

In the 17th Century, Jews were banished from Switzerland.  However, a few families were permitted to live in two villages, [[Endingen, Switzerland|Endingen]] and [[Lengnau, Aargau|Lengnau]], in Aargau which became the Jewish ghetto in Switzerland.  This remained the case until the 19th Century.  In 1799 all special tolls were abolished, and in 1802 the poll tax was removed.  On 5 May, 1809, the right of citizenship was granted to Jews, and they were permitted to engage in trade and agriculture.  The right of settlement remained restricted to Endingen and Lengnau until 7 May 1846, when they were allowed to settle in any portion of the canton of Aargau.  Ten years later (24 September 1856) the [[Swiss Federal Council]] voted them equal political rights with other Swiss citizens in that canton, as well as entire freedom of commerce; but the opposition of the Christian population prevented the decision from being generally carried out.  The federal authorities in July 1863, granted the Swiss Jews the fullest rights of citizens.  However, full civil equality was obtained only when they received the formal rights of citizenship, which had long been withheld from them in their own communities of Endingen and Lengnau. A resolution of the [[Grand Council of Aargau|Grand Council]], on 15 May 1877, granted citizens' rights to the members of the Jewish communities of those places, giving them charters under the names of New Endingen and New Lengnau.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=3&amp;letter=A Jewish Encyclopedia: Aargau]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Bözberg Lägernblick 8054.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Lägern]] from [[Bözberg]]]]
Its total area is {{km2 to mi2|1404|abbr=on}}.  The capital is [[Aarau]]. It borders [[Germany]] to the north. To the west lie the cantons of [[Basel-Landschaft]], [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]] and [[Canton of Bern|Bern]]. The canton of [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]] lies south of the canton of Aargau, [[Canton of Zürich|Zürich]] and [[Canton of Zug|Zug]] to the east.

The canton of Aargau is one of the least mountainous Swiss cantons, forming part of a [[Swiss Plateau|great table-land]], to the north of the [[Swiss Alps|Alps]] and the east of the [[Jura mountains|Jura]], above which rise low hills. The surface of the country is beautifully diversified, undulating tracts and well-wooded hills&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt; alternating with fertile valleys watered mainly by the Aar and its tributaries. The valleys alternate with pleasant hills, most of which are full of woods.  Slightly over one-third of the canton is wooded ({{km2 to mi2|518|abbr=on}}), while nearly half is used from farming ({{km2 to mi2|635.7|abbr=on}}).  {{km2 to mi2|33.5|abbr=on}} or about 2.4% of the canton is considered unproductive, mostly lakes and streams.  The canton is heavily developed, with {{km2 to mi2|216.7|abbr=on}} or about 15% of the canton developed for housing or transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Federal Department of Statistics | title = Arealstatistik – Kantonsdaten nach 15 Nutzungsarten | year = 2008  | url = http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/02/03/blank/key/01/zustand_und_entwicklung__tabelle.html | format = Microsoft Excel | accessdate = 2009-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It contains the famous hot sulphur springs of [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]] and [[Schinznach-Bad]], while at [[Rheinfelden]] there are very extensive saline springs. Just below [[Brugg]] the [[Reuss River|Reuss]] and the [[Limmat]] join the Aar, while around Brugg are the ruined castle of [[Habsburg]], the old convent of [[Königsfelden Abbey|Königsfelden]] (with fine painted medieval glass) and the remains of the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] settlement of ''Vindonissa'' ([[Windisch]]).

==Political subdivisions==
===Districts===
[[File:Karte Kanton Aargau Bezirke.png|thumb|Districts in Aargau]]

==Demographics==
The population of Aargau is {{Swiss populations NC|CH-AG|CH-AG}} ({{Swiss populations date|CH-AG}}).{{Swiss populations ref|CH-AG}}  {{as of|2007}} the population included 118,407 foreigners, who made up 20.36% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Federal Department of Statistics | title = Ständige Wohnbevölkerung nach Staatsangehörigkeit, Geschlecht und Kantonen | year = 2008 | url = http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/02/blank/key/raeumliche_verteilung/kantone__gemeinden.html | format = Microsoft Excel | accessdate = 2008-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religiously, they are ({{as of|2000|lc=on}}) nearly evenly split between [[Roman Catholic]]s (40%) and [[Protestantism|Protestants]] (37%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Federal Department of Statistics | title = Wohnbevölkerung nach Religion | year = 2004 | url = http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/05/blank/key/religionen.html | format = Interactive Map | accessdate = 2009-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; German is the most common language in the canton, spoken by 87% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Federal Department of Statistics | title = Wohnbevölkerung nach Sprachen | year = 2004 | url = http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/05/blank/key/sprachen.html | format = Interactive Map | accessdate = 2009-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:KKL Leibstadt.jpg|thumb|[[Leibstadt Nuclear Power Plant]]]]
The farmland of the canton of Aargau is some of the most fertile in Switzerland. [[Dairy farming]], [[cereal]] and [[fruit]] farming are among the canton's main economic activities. The canton is also industrially developed, particularly in the fields of [[electrical engineering]], precision instruments, [[iron]], [[steel]] and [[cement]].

Three of Switzerland's five nuclear power plants are in the canton of Aargau (Beznau I + II and Leibstadt). Additionally, the many rivers supply enough water for numerous hydroelectric power plants throughout the canton. The canton of Aargau is often called &quot;the energy canton&quot;.

A significant number of people commute into the financial center of the city of [[Zürich]], which is just across the cantonal border. As such the per capita cantonal income is approximately $41,777.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/themen/04/02/05/key/pro-kopf-einkommen.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism is significant, particularly for the hot springs at [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]] and [[Schinznach-Bad]], the ancient castles, the landscape, and the many old [[museum]]s in the canton.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9003207 &quot;Aargau&quot;] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. 11 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Hillwalking is another tourist attraction but is of only limited significance.

The '''Ababda''' or '''Ababde''' &amp;ndash; the '''Gebadei''' of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], and possibly the '''[[Troglodytae|Troglodytes]]''' of other classical writers &amp;ndash; are [[nomad]]s living in the area between the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]], in the vicinity of [[Aswan]] in [[Egypt]].  They are a subgroup of the [[Beja people]] who are bilingual in [[Beja language|Beja]] and [[Arabic]]. 

They extend from the [[Nile]] at [[Aswan]] to the [[Red Sea]], and reach northward to the [[Qena]]-Quseir road, thus occupying the southern border of [[Egypt]] east of the Nile. They call themselves &quot;sons of the Jinns.&quot; With some of the clans of the [[Bisharin]] and possibly the [[Hadendoa]], they represent the [[Blemmyes]] of classic geographers, and their location today is almost identical with that assigned them in [[ancient Rome|Roman]] times.

They were constantly at war with the Romans, who eventually conquered them. In the Middle Ages, they were known as Beja, and convoyed pilgrims from the Nile valley to Aidhab, the port of embarkation for [[Jeddah]]. From time immemorial, they have acted as guides to caravans through the [[Nubia]]n desert and up the Nile valley as far as Sennar. They intermarried with the Nubians, and settled in small colonies at [[Shendi]] and elsewhere up to [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali's]] conquest of the region in the early 19th century. They are still great trade carriers, and visit very distant districts.

The '''American Quarter Horse''' is an American [[Horse breeds|breed]] of [[horse]] that excels at sprinting short distances.  Its name came from its ability to outdistance other breeds of horses in races of a quarter mile or less; some individuals have been clocked at speeds up to 55&amp;nbsp;mph (88.5&amp;nbsp;km/h). The American Quarter Horse is the most popular breed in the United States today, and the [[American Quarter Horse Association]] is the largest breed registry in the world, with more than 4 million American Quarter Horses registered.

The American Quarter Horse is well known both as a race horse and for its performance in [[rodeo]]s, [[horse show]]s and as a working [[ranch]] horse. The compact body of the American Quarter Horse is well-suited to the intricate and speedy maneuvers required in [[reining]], [[cutting (sport)|cutting]], working cow horse, [[barrel racing]], [[calf roping]], and other [[western riding]] events, especially those involving live cattle.  The American Quarter Horse is also shown in [[English riding|English]] disciplines, [[Driving (horse)|driving]], and many other [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] activities.

==Breed history==
===Colonial era===

In the 17th century, colonists on the eastern seaboard of what today is the United States began to cross imported English [[Thoroughbred]] horses with assorted &quot;native&quot; horses such as the [[Chickasaw horse]], which was a breed developed by Native American people from horses descended from Spain, developed from [[Iberian horse|Iberian]], [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] and [[Barb (horse)|Barb]] stock brought to what is now the Southeastern United States by the [[Conquistadors]].&lt;ref name=QRH4&gt;Denhardt ''Quarter Running Horse'' pp. 4–8&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous of these early imports was Janus, a Thoroughbred who was the grandson of the [[Godolphin Arabian]].  He was foaled in 1746, and imported to colonial Virginia in 1756.&lt;ref name=QRH&gt;Denhardt ''Quarter Running Horse'' pp. 20–32&lt;/ref&gt;  The influence of Thoroughbreds like Janus contributed genes crucial to the development of the colonial &quot;Quarter Horse.&quot;&lt;ref name=Colonial106&gt;Mackay-Smith ''Colonial Quarter Race Horse'' p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Colonial138&gt;Mackay-Smith ''Colonial Quarter Race Horse'' p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; The breed is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Famous American Quarter Running Horse.&quot;&lt;ref name=Colonialxxxi/&gt; The resulting horse was small, hardy, and quick, and was used as a work horse during the week and a race horse on the weekends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/QQ/tcq1.html|title= Quarter Horses|accessdate=2006-05-30 |author= Beckmann, Bruce|work= Handbook of Texas Online|publisher= Texas State Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As flat racing became popular with the colonists, the Quarter Horse gained even more popularity as a sprinter over courses that, by necessity, were shorter than the classic racecourses of England, and were often no more than a straight stretch of road or flat piece of open land. When matched against a Thoroughbred, local sprinters often won.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  As the Thoroughbred breed became established in America, many colonial Quarter Horses were included in the original American stud books,&lt;ref name=Colonialxxxi&gt;Mackay-Smith ''Colonial Quarter Race Horse'' p. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; starting a long association between the Thoroughbred breed and what would later become officially known as the &quot;Quarter Horse,&quot; named after the distance at which it excelled,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} with some individuals being clocked at up to 55&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iqhra.com/|title= Iowa Quarter Horse Racing Association 1976–2008|accessdate=2008-06-11 |author= Iowa Quarter Horse Racing Association|work= IQHRA Website|publisher= Iowa Quarter Horse Racing Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Westward expansion===
In the 19th century, pioneers heading West needed a hardy, willing horse. On the [[Great Plains]], settlers encountered horses that descended from the Spanish stock [[Hernán Cortés]] and other Conquistadors had introduced into the viceroyalty of [[New Spain]], which today includes the Southwestern United States and Mexico.  These horses of the west included herds of [[feral]] animals known as [[Mustang (horse)|Mustangs]], as well as horses domesticated by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], including the [[Comanche]], [[Shoshoni]] and [[Nez Perce (tribe)|Nez Perce]] tribes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  As the colonial Quarter Horse was crossed with these western horses, the pioneers found that the new crossbred had innate &quot;cow sense,&quot; a natural instinct for working with cattle, making it popular with cattlemen on [[ranch]]es.&lt;ref name=Colonial193&gt;Mackay-Smith ''Colonial Quarter Race Horse'' p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development as a distinct breed===
{{See also|American Quarter Horse Association|American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame}}
[[Image:Petermccuewithcaudell.jpg|thumb|left|A photograph of Peter McCue, taken in Oklahoma around 1905.]]
Early  [[foundation bloodstock|foundation sires]] of Quarter horse type included Steel Dust, foaled 1843; Shiloh (or Old Shiloh), foaled 1844; Old Cold Deck (1862); Lock's Rondo, one of many &quot;Rondo&quot; horses, foaled in 1880; Old Billy—again, one of many &quot;Billy&quot; horses—foaled circa 1880; [[Traveler (horse)|Traveler]], a stallion of unknown breeding, known to have been in Texas by 1889;&lt;ref name=&quot;Legends 2&quot;&gt;Close, ''Legends 2: Outstanding Quarter Horse Stallions and Mares.''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter McCue (horse)|Peter McCue]], foaled 1895, registered as a [[Thoroughbred]] but of disputed pedigree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Legends 2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/quarter/|title= Quarter Horse|accessdate=2008-06-11 |author= Oklahoma State University|work= Breeds of Livestock|publisher= Oklahoma State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main duty of the ranch horse in the American West was working cattle.  Even after the invention of the automobile, horses were still irreplaceable for handling livestock on the range. Thus, major Texas cattle [[ranch]]es, such as the [[King Ranch]], the 6666 (Four Sixes) Ranch, and the [[Waggoner Ranch]] played a significant role in the development of the modern Quarter Horse. The skills needed by cowboys and their horses became the foundation of the [[rodeo]], a contest which began with informal competition between [[cowboys]] and expanded to become a major competitive event throughout the west.  To this day, the Quarter Horse dominates the sport both in speed events and in competition that emphasizes the handling of live cattle.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

However, sprint races were also popular weekend entertainment and racing became a source of economic gain for breeders as well. As a result, more Thoroughbred blood was added back into the developing American Quarter Horse breed. The American Quarter Horse also benefitted from the addition of [[Arabian Horse|Arabian]], [[Morgan horse|Morgan]] and even [[Standardbred horse|Standardbred]] bloodlines.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In 1940, the [[American Quarter Horse Association]] (AQHA) was formed by a group of horsemen and ranchers from the southwestern United States dedicated to preserving the pedigrees of their ranch horses.&lt;ref name=QH143&gt;Denhardt ''Quarter Horse'' pp. 143–167&lt;/ref&gt; The horse honored with the first registration number, P-1, was [[Wimpy P-1|Wimpy]],&lt;ref name=imh&gt;{{cite web |url= http://imh.org/horse-breeds-of-the-world/american-quarter-horse/|title= American Quarter Horse|accessdate=2008-06-11 |author= Kentucky Horse Park|work= International Museum of the Horse- Horse Breeds of the World|publisher= Kentucky Horse Park}}&lt;/ref&gt; a descendant of the [[King Ranch]] foundation sire [[Old Sorrel (horse)|Old Sorrel]]. Other sires alive at the founding of the AQHA were given the earliest registration numbers [[Joe Reed (horse)|Joe Reed P-3]], Chief P-5, [[Oklahoma Star|Oklahoma Star P-6]], Cowboy P-12, and Waggoner's Rainy Day P-13.&lt;ref name=AQHASB1&gt;American Quarter Horse Association ''Combined Stud Book 1-2-3-4-5'' p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thoroughbred]] race horse [[Three Bars (horse)|Three Bars]], alive in the early years of the AQHA, is recognized by the [[American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame]] as one of the significant foundation sires for the Quarter Horse breed.&lt;ref name=HoF3Bars&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteexec.aqha.com/foundation/halloffame/images/Three%20Bars.pdf|publisher=American Quarter Horse Association |title=Three Bars (TB) |accessdate=2010-12-21|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other significant Thoroughbred sires seen in early AQHA pedigrees include [[Rocket Bar]], [[Top Deck (horse)|Top Deck]] and Depth Charge.&lt;ref name=Wiggins166&gt;Wiggins ''Great American Speedhorse'' p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;Appendix&quot; and &quot;Foundation&quot; horses==
Since the American Quarter Horse formally established itself as a breed, the AQHA stud book has remained open to additional [[Thoroughbred]] blood via a performance standard. An &quot;Appendix&quot; American Quarter Horse is a first generation cross between a registered Thoroughbred and an American Quarter Horse or a cross between a &quot;numbered&quot; American Quarter Horse and an &quot;appendix&quot; American Quarter Horse. The resulting offspring is registered in the &quot;appendix&quot; of the American Quarter Horse Association's studbook, hence the nickname. Horses listed in the appendix may be entered in competition, but offspring are not initially eligible for full AQHA registration.  If the Appendix horse meets certain conformational criteria and is shown or raced successfully in sanctioned AQHA events, the horse can earn its way from the appendix into the permanent studbook, making its offspring eligible for AQHA registration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aqha.com/association/registration/handbook.html |title= AQHA Handbook of Rules and Regulations |author= American Quarter Horse Association |work= SECTION II, Registration Rules and Regulations |publisher= American Quarter Horse Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Quarter Horse/Thoroughbred crosses continue to enter the official registry of the American Quarter Horse breed, this creates a continual gene flow from the Thoroughbred breed into the American Quarter Horse breed, which has altered many of the characteristics that typified the breed in the early years of its formation.  Some breeders, who argue that the continued infusion of Thoroughbred bloodlines is beginning to compromise the integrity of the breed standard, favor the earlier style of horse, have created several separate organizations to promote and register &quot;Foundation&quot; Quarter Horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fqha.com/|title= Foundation Quarter Horse Association|accessdate=2007-04-02 |author= Foundation Quarter Horse Association|work= FQHA Website|publisher= Foundation Quarter Horse Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.foundationhorses.com/|title= Foundation Bred Quarter Horses|accessdate=2007-04-02 |author= Foundation Horses |work= FoundationHorses.com|publisher= Foundation Horses}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nfqha.com/|title= National Foundation Quarter Horse Association|accessdate=2007-04-02 |author= National Foundation Quarter Horse Association|work= NFQHA Website|publisher= National Foundation Quarter Horse Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quarter Horses today==
[[Image:Barrel racing.jpg|right|thumb|The Quarter Horse is well-suited for the western disciplines.]]
The American Quarter Horse is best-known today as a [[horse show|show horse]], [[horse racing|race horse]],  [[reining]] and [[cutting (sport)|cutting]] horse, [[rodeo]] competitor, [[ranch]] horse, and all-around family horse.  Quarter horses compete well in rodeo events such as [[barrel racing]], [[calf roping]] and [[team roping]];{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and [[Gymkhana (Equestrian)|gymkhana]] or O-Mok-See.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omoksee.com/ National Saddle Clubs Association]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other stock horse events such as [[Cutting (sport)|cutting]] and [[reining]] are open to all breeds but also dominated by American Quarter Horse.  Large purses allow top competitors to earn over a million dollars in some of these events.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The breed is not only well-suited for [[western riding]] and [[cattle]] work. Many race tracks offer Quarter Horses a wide assortment of pari-mutuel [[horse racing]] with purses in the millions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Quarter Horses have also been trained to compete in [[dressage]] and can be good [[show jumping|jumpers]]. They are also used for recreational [[trail riding]] and in [[mounted police]] units.&lt;ref name=imh/&gt;

The American Quarter Horse has also been exported worldwide. European nations such as Germany and Italy have imported large numbers of Quarter Horses. Next to the [[American Quarter Horse Association]] (which also encompasses Quarter Horses from Canada), the second largest registry of Quarter Horses is in Brazil, followed by Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqha.ca/ The Canadian Quarter Horse Association]&lt;/ref&gt; With the internationalization of the discipline of [[reining]] and its acceptance as one of the official seven events of the [[World Equestrian Games]], there is a growing international interest in Quarter Horses. Countries like Japan, Switzerland and [[Israel]] that did not have traditional stock horse industries have begun to compete with American Quarter Horses in their own nations and internationally.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The American Quarter Horse is the most popular breed in the United States today, and the [[American Quarter Horse Association]] is the largest breed registry in the world, with over 3 million American Quarter Horses registered worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aqha.com/bin/q/z/annualreport_horsestats.pdf|format=PDF |title= Horse Statistics|accessdate=2008-06-11 |author= American Quarter Horse Association|work= 2006 AQHA Annual Report|publisher= American Quarter Horse Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breed characteristics==
[[Image:Brauner.JPG|thumb|A halter-type Quarter Horse]]
The modern Quarter Horse has a small, short, refined head with a straight profile, and a strong, well-muscled body, featuring a broad chest and powerful, rounded hindquarters. They usually stand between 14 and 16 [[hand (unit)|hands]] high, although some [[Halter (horse show)|Halter-type]] and English hunter-type horses may grow as tall as 17 hands.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

There are two main body types: the stock type and the hunter or racing type. The stock horse type is shorter, more compact, stocky and well muscled, yet agile. The racing and hunter type Quarter Horses are somewhat taller and smoother muscled than the stock type, more closely resembling the [[Thoroughbred]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Stock type===
{{See also|Stock horse}}
[[Reining]] and [[cutting (sport)|cutting]] horses are smaller in stature, with quick, agile movements and very powerful hindquarters. [[Western pleasure]] show horses are often slightly taller, with slower movements,smoother gaits, and a somewhat more level topline – though still featuring the powerful hindquarters characteristic of the Quarter Horse. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Halter type===
Horses shown in-hand in [[halter (horse show)|Halter]] competition are larger yet, with a very heavily muscled appearance, while retaining small heads with wide jowls and refined muzzles.  There is controversy amongst owners, breeder and veterinarians regarding  the health effects of the extreme muscle mass that is currently fashionable in the specialized halter horse, which typically is 15.2 to 16 hands and weighs in at over {{convert|1200|lb}} when fitted for halter competition.  Not only are there concerns about the weight to frame ratio on the horse's [[Horse anatomy|skeletal system]], but the massive build is also linked to [[HYPP]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}  (See ''Genetic diseases'' below)

===Racing and hunter type===
[[Image:Quarter Horse Hunter.jpg|right|thumb|A quarter horse competing in an open hunter show]]
Quarter Horse [[Horse racing|race horses]] are bred to sprint short distances ranging from 220 to 870 yards.  Thus, they have long legs and are leaner than their stock type counterparts, but are still characterized by muscular hindquarters and powerful legs.  Quarter horses race primarily against other Quarter horses, and their sprinting ability has earned them the nickname, &quot;the world's fastest athlete.&quot; The [[show hunter]] type is slimmer, even more closely resembling a [[Thoroughbred]], usually reflecting a higher percentage of appendix breeding. They are shown in hunter/jumper classes at both breed shows and in open [[United States Equestrian Federation|USEF]]-rated [[horse show]] competition.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Colors===
{{Main|Equine coat color}}
Quarter Horses come in nearly all colors.

==Genetic diseases==
There are several genetic diseases of concern to Quarter Horse breeders:
*[[Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis]] (HYPP), which is caused by an [[autosomal]] [[dominant gene]] linked to the stallion [[Impressive]].  It is characterized by uncontrollable muscle twitching and substantial muscle weakness or paralysis among affected horses.  Because it is a dominant gene, only one parent has to have the gene for it to be transmitted to offspring.  There is a DNA test for HYPP, which is required by the [[AQHA]]. Since 2007, the AQHA bars registration of horses who possess the homozygous form (H/H) of the gene,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqha.com/association/registration/hypp.html Details on AQHA HYP rules for registration]&lt;/ref&gt; and though [[heterozygous]] (H/N) horses, is still eligible for registration, altering that status is currently being discussed. Additionally all Quarter Horses born 2007 or later that are confirmed to be descendants of Impressive must carry a note about the risks of HYPP on their registration papers. Due to HYPP, the halter classes are undergoing significant changes.  [[Halter (horse show)|Halter]] classes are dominated by the [[Impressive]] bloodline.  Impressive, a very prolific halter horse, brought to the stock breeds the muscle mass that is popular in halter competition today.  This muscle mass is linked to HYPP, and as the condition is reduced within the breed, the style of horse in halter classes is also likely to change.  Already there have been rule changes, including the creation of a &quot;Performance Halter class&quot; in which a horse must possess a Register of Merit  in performance before it  can compete.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

*[[Hereditary Equine Regional Dermal Asthenia]] (HERDA), also known as hyperelastosis cutis (HC).  This is caused by an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[recessive gene]], and thus, unlike HYPP, HERDA can only be transmitted if both parents carry the gene.  When a horse has this disease, there is a collagen defect that results in the layers of skin not being held firmly together. Thus, when the horse is ridden under saddle or suffers trauma to the skin, the outer layer often splits or separates from the deeper layer, or it can tear off completely. It rarely heals without disfiguring scars. Sunburn can also be a concern. In dramatic cases, the skin can split along the back and even roll down the sides, with the horse literally being skinned alive.  Most horses with HERDA are euthanized for humane reasons between the age of two and four years.  The very hotly debated and controversial theory, put forth by researchers at [[Cornell University]] and [[Mississippi State University]] is that the sire line of the great foundation stallion [[Poco Bueno]] is implicated as the origin of the disease.  As of May 9, 2007, Researchers working independently at Cornell University and at the [[University of California, Davis]] announced that a DNA test for HERDA has been developed. Over 1,500 horses were tested during the development phase of the test, which is now available to the general public through both institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Sellnow, &quot;[http://www.thehorse.com/viewarticle.aspx?ID=9687 HERDA]&quot;, ''The Horse Online News''&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Glycogen Branching Enzyme Deficiency]] (GBED) is a genetic disease where the horse is lacking an enzyme necessary for storing [[glycogen]], the horse's heart muscle and skeletal muscles cannot function, leading to rapid death. The disease occurs in foals who are [[homozygous]] for the lethal GBED allele, meaning both parents carry one copy of the gene.  The stallion [[King (horse)|King P-234]] has been linked to this disease.  There is a [[DNA]] blood test for this gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cvm.umn.edu/umec/lab/gbed.html|title= Glycogen Branching Enzyme Deficiency (GBED) in Horses|accessdate=2008-06-12 |author= Valberg, Stephanie DVM, PhD, Diplomate ACVIM and James R Mickelson PhD|work= Glycogen Branching Enzyme Deficiency (GBED)|publisher= University of Minnsesota}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Equine polysaccharide storage myopathy]], also called EPSM or PSSM, is a metabolic muscular condition in horses that causes [[Equine Exertional Rhabdomyolysis|tying up]], and is also related to a [[glycogen]] storage disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Valberg et al., &quot;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=10659313&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus Exertional rhabdomyolysis in quarter horses and thoroughbreds]&quot;, ''Equine Vet Journal Supplement'', pp. 533–38&lt;/ref&gt;  While also seen in some [[draft horse]] breeds, PSSM has been traced to three specific but undisclosed bloodlines in Quarter Horses, with an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[recessive]] inheritance pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.addl.purdue.edu/newsletters/2000/summer/eer.shtml|title= Equine Exertional Rhabdomyolysis|accessdate=2008-06-12 |author= Ulman, Katherine|work= Summer 2000 Newsletter|publisher= Purdue University, Animal Disease Diagnostic Lab}}&lt;/ref&gt;  48% of Quarter Horses with symptoms of neuromuscular disease have PSSM.  To some extent it can be diet controlled with specialized low-starch diets, but genetic testing is advised before breeding, as the condition exists at a subclinical level in approximately 6% of the general Quarter Horse population.&lt;ref&gt;Church, &quot;[http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=7628 ACVIM 2006]&quot;, ''The Horse Online News''&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Lethal White Syndrome]]. Although &quot;[[cropout]]&quot; Quarter Horses with Paint markings were not allowed to be registered for many years, the gene for such markings is a recessive and continued to periodically appear in Quarter Horse foals.  Thus, it is believed that some Quarter Horses may carry the gene for [[Lethal White Syndrome]].  There is a DNA test for this condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolorhorse.php |title= Horse Coat Color Tests| author= University of California – Davis|work=Veterinary Genetics Laboratory|publisher=University of California at Davis |accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abacá''', '''''Musa textilis''''' ({{IPA-en|ɑːbəˈkɑː}} ''ah-bə-KAH'', from Spanish &quot;abacá&quot; for ''Musa textilis)'' is a species of [[banana]] native to the [[Philippines]], grown as a commercial crop in the Philippines, Ecuador, and Costa Rica. The plant is of great economic importance, being harvested for its fibre, once generally called [[Manila hemp]], extracted from the trunk or pseudostem. On average, the plant grows about 15 feet (5 metres) tall. The fibre was originally used for making twines and ropes; now most abacá is pulped and used in a variety of specialized paper products including tea bags, filter paper and banknotes.  It is classified as a hard fibre, along with [[coir]], [[henequin]] and [[sisal]].

Abacá was first cultivated on a large scale in [[Sumatra]] in 1925 under the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], who had observed its cultivation in the Philippines for [[cordage]] since the 19th century, followed up by plantings in [[Central America]] in 1929 sponsored by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9003214 &quot;abaca.&quot;] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. 22 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial planting began in 1930 in  [[British North Borneo]]; with the commencement of WWII, the supply from the Philippines was eliminated by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt;  Today, abaca is produced commercially in only three countries: Philippines, Ecuador, and Costa Rica.  Yields are highest in Costa Rica, but the industry is new and planted acreage limited. 

==Composition==
The leaves grow from the trunk of the plant, the bases of the leaves form a ''[[Leaf sheath|sheath]]'' (covering) around the trunk; there are approximately 25 of these, with 5&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and from 12 to 25 leaves with overlapping [[petiole (botany)|petiole]]s, covering the stalk to form a [[shrub]], &quot;false trunk&quot; or pseudostem about 30 to 40&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt; They grow in succession, with the oldest growing from the bottom of the trunk and successively younger ones from the top. The sheaths contain the valuable fibre. The coarse fibres range from 5 to 11½ feet (1.5 to 3.5 metres) in length. They are composed primarily of [[cellulose]], [[lignin]], and [[pectin]].
== Applications ==

Most abacá fibre is pulped and processed into specialty paper used in [[tea bag]]s, vacuum bags, currency, and more.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} It can be used to make handcrafts like bags, carpets, clothing and furniture.  Abacá rope is very durable, flexible and resistant to salt water damage, allowing its use in [[hawser]]s, ship's lines and [[fishing net]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt;  Abacá fibre was once used primarily for rope, but this application is now of minor significance.  Lupis is the finest quality of abacá.  Sinamay is woven chiefly from abacá.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;lupis&quot;, &quot;sinamay&quot; in Merriam-Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, third edition&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harvesting==
The plant is normally grown in well-drained [[loam]]y soil, using pieces of mature root planted at the start of the rainy season.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt; Growers harvest abacá fields every three to eight months after an initial growth period of 18–25 months and a total lifespan of about 10 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt; Harvest generally includes having several operations concerning the leaf sheaths:
* tuxying (separation of primary and secondary sheath)
* stripping (getting the fibres)
* drying (usually following tradition of sun-drying).

The fibres can then be spun into twines or cordage.


==Scientific classification==
The abacá plant belongs to the [[banana]] family, [[Musaceae]]; it resembles the closely related wild seeded bananas, ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' and ''[[Musa balbisiana]]''. Its scientific name is ''Musa textilis''.

{{About|the Hebrew word}}

[[Image:Christianandapollyon.jpg|right|Apollyon (top) battling Christian in [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''.|240px|thumb]]
'''Abaddon''' ({{lang-he|אֲבַדּוֹן}}, ''{{lang|he-Latn|'Ǎḇaddōn}}'', [[Koine Greek|Greek]]: ''{{lang|el|Apollyon}}'', {{lang-la|Exterminans}}, [[Coptic language|Coptic]]: ''{{lang|cop-Latn|Abbaton}}'', meaning &quot;A place of destruction&quot;, &quot;The Destroyer&quot;, &quot;Depths of Hell&quot;) in the [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] of [[John the Evangelist|St. John]], is the king of tormenting locusts and the angel of the bottomless pit.&lt;ref&gt;KJV, Rev. 9:1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;  The exact nature of Abaddon is debated, but the Hebrew word is related to the [[Semitic root|triliteral root]] אבד (ABD), which in verb form means &quot;to perish.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See any Hebrew dictionary entry for Strong number 6; you can search for it using [http://unbound.biola.edu/index.cfm?method=strongsLex.showSearchForm The Unbound Bible's lexicon search tool].&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Judaism and Christianity==
===Biblical mentions===
In the Hebrew scriptures, ''Abaddon'' comes to mean &quot;place of destruction,&quot; or the realm of the dead, and is associated with [[Sheol]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Book of Job|Job]] 26:6, [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 15:11, Proverbs 27:20 and [[Book of Psalms|Psalm]] 88:3, among others.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian scriptures contain the first known&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson 1967&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Davidson |first = Gustav | origyear = 1967 | year = 1994 | title = A Dictionary of Fallen Angels, Including the Fallen Angels | publisher = Macmillan, Inc. | location = New York, New York | isbn = 978-0-02-907052-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; depiction of ''Abaddon'' as an individual entity instead of a place. In St. John's Revelation 9:1-11,  ''Abaddon'' is described as the king of the bottomless pit and of a plague of locusts that resemble war horses with crowned human faces and having women's hair, lions' teeth, locusts' wings, and the tail of a scorpion.

===Other theological works===
The text of the [[Thanksgiving Hymns]]—which was found in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]—tells of &quot;the Sheol of Abaddon&quot; and of the &quot;torrents of [[Belial]] [that] burst into Abaddon&quot;. The [[Pseudo-Philo|''Biblical Antiquities'']] attributed to Philo mentions Abaddon as a place (''sheol'', hell), not as a spirit or demon or angel. In the 3rd century ''[[Acts of Thomas]]'', Abaddon is the name of a demon, or the [[Devil]] himself. Abaddon has also been identified as the angel of death and destruction, demon of the abyss, and chief of demons of the underworld hierarchy, where he is equated with [[Samael]] or [[Satan]]. In [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], Abaddon is often identified with the Destroying Angel of the [[Apocalypse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occultopedia.com/a/abaddon.htm Occultopedia article on Abaddon]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abaddon is also one of the compartments of [[Gehenna]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot;&gt;Metzger &amp; Coogan (1993) ''Oxford Companion to the Bible'', p3.&lt;/ref&gt;  By extension, it can mean an underworld abode of lost souls, or [[hell]]. In some legends, it is identified as a realm where the damned lie in fire and snow, one of the places in Hell that [[Moses]] visited.&lt;ref name =&quot;Ginzberg&quot;&gt;''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj206.htm The Legends of the Jews, volume II: From Joseph to Exodus]'', Lewis Ginzberg, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lore of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]], '''Abbaton''' is the name given to the [[Death (personification)|angel of death]]. He is given particularly important roles in two sources, a homily entitled ''The Enthronment of Abbaton'' by [[Timothy of Alexandria]], and the Apocalypse of Bartholomew.&lt;ref name=Aziz&gt;[[Atiya, Aziz S.]] ''[[The Coptic Encyclopedia]].'' New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., 1991. ISBN 0-02-897025-X&lt;/ref&gt;  In the homily by Timothy, Abbaton was first named ''Muriel'', and had been given the task by [[God]] of collecting the earth which would be used in the creation of [[Adam]]. Upon completion of this task, the angel was then named to be guardian. Everybody, including the angels, demons, and corporeal entities, felt fear of him. Abbaton engaged in prayer and ultimately obtained the promise that any men who venerated him during their lifetime stood the chance of being saved. Abbaton is also said to have a prominent role in the [[Last Judgement]], as the one who will take the souls to the [[Valley of Josaphat]].&lt;ref name=Aziz/&gt;  He is described in the Apocalypse of Bartholomew as being present in the [[Tomb of Jesus]] at the moment of his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/LostBooks/bartholomew.htm Gospel of Bartholomew] Featured as Abbaton&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identifying Abaddon===
The symbolism of Revelation 9:11 leaves the exact identification of Abaddon open for interpretation.  Some bible scholars believe him to be the antichrist&lt;ref name=&quot;henry&quot;&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/comm_read.pl?book=Rev&amp;chapter=9&amp;verse=11&amp;Comm=Comm%2Fmhc%2FRev%2FRev009.html%231%26Matthew%26Henry&amp;Select.x=18&amp;Select.y=9#1 ''Matthew Henry Commentary on Revelation 9''], accessed 15 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; or Satan.&lt;ref name=&quot;jfb&quot;&gt;Jamieson, Robert; Fausset, A.R.; and Brown, David (2000-02-19). Commentary on Revelation 9. Blue Letter Bible. Retrieved on 2007-04-15 from http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/comm_read.pl?book=Rev&amp;chapter=9&amp;verse=11&amp;Comm=Comm%2Fjfb%2FRev%2FRev009.html%2359238%26JF+%5E%26B&amp;Select.x=24&amp;Select.y=0.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;halley&quot;&gt;Halley (2000) ''Halley's Bible Handbook with the New International Version'', p936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;MacDonald (1995) ''Believer's Bible Commentary'', p2366.&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Bible Students Association (precursor to Jehovah's Witnesses) identified Abaddon as Satan in C.T. Russel's 1917 posthumous work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Taze Russell]]’s ''[[Studies in the Scriptures]]'', vol. 7, p. 159, 1917 edition&lt;/ref&gt; Jehovah's Witnesses now take the contrasting view, believing that Abaddon is another name of the resurrected and enthroned Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Insight on the Scriptures Page 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watchtower, Dec. 1, 1961, p. 719&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theologians believe Abaddon to be just an angel. Concerning the angel holding the key to the bottomless pit from Revelation 9 and 20, [[Gustav Davidson]], in ''A Dictionary of Angels, Including the Fallen Angels'', writes:

:In Revelation 20:2 he &quot;laid hold of the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years&quot;. According to the foregoing, Apollion is a holy (good) angel, servant, and messenger of God; but in occult and, generally, in noncanonical writings, he is evil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson 1967&quot;/&gt;

'''Abadeh''' ({{lang-fa| آباده }}) is a city in [[Fars Province|Fars province]], [[Iran]], situated at an elevation of {{convert|6200|ft|m|-1}} in a fertile plain on the high road between [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] and [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]], {{convert|140|mi|km}} from the former and {{convert|170|mi|km}} from the latter.  The population is 95,460 (est. 2009),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazetteer.de/c/c_ir.htm ''World Gazetteer'']&lt;/ref&gt; showing a growth of 45% from 1985 to 2005. The city is the capital of [[Abadeh County|Abadehy County]].

It is the largest city in the [[Abadeh County|Abadeh]]-[[Eghlid]] district, which is famed for its carved wood-work, made of the wood of [[pear]] and [[box tree]]s. Sesame oil, castor oil, grain, and various fruits are also produced there. The area is famous for its [[Abadeh rug]]s.

==Landmarks and crafts==
Abadeh historical monuments include Emirate Kolah Farangi, Tymcheh Sarafyan and Khaje tomb, located in the Khoja mountains.
Abadeh crafts can be embroidered in cotton. The town also produces [[Abadeh rug]]s.

==Transportation==

'''[[Road 65 (Iran)|Expessway 65]]''' passes through Abadeh. This situation helps Abadeh to improve its capabilities. of course some problems such as dry climate absent of anatural potential make some problems for Abadeh. A road starts from Abadeh Ring Road to [[Soqad]] and [[Semirom]], [[Road 55 (Iran)|Road 55]]. 

A rail road from [[Isfahan]] to [[Shiraz]] was planned and started to be constructed in 2002. An airport was planned to be built in [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsenjani]]'s presidential period this airport is common between Eqlid and Abadeh.

It was rich in treasures,&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]]. viii.33&lt;/ref&gt; but was destroyed by the [[Persia]]ns in the invasion of [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] in 480 BCE, and a second time by the [[Boeotia]]ns and remained in a ruined state.It was rebuilt by [[Hadrian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Smith  | first = William  | authorlink = William Smith (lexicographer)  | coauthors =   | title = A New classical dictionary of biography, mythology, and geography  | publisher = [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]  | year = 1850  | location = London  | pages = 1  | url = http://books.google.com/?id=5_oGAAAAQAAJ  | doi =   | id =   | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oracle was, however, still consulted, e.g. by the [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebans]] before [[Leuctra]] in 371 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias iv. 32.5&lt;/ref&gt; The temple seems to have been burnt again during the [[Third Sacred War]] (355–346 BCE), and was in a very dilapidated state when seen by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the 2nd century CE,&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, x. 35&lt;/ref&gt; though some restoration, as well as the building of a new temple, was undertaken by Emperor [[Hadrian]].

The sanctity of the shrine ensured certain privileges to the people of Abae,&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin Corresp. Hell.'' '''6''' 171.&lt;/ref&gt; and these were confirmed by the Romans.

Among the most exciting archaeological discoveries in Greece in the past few years is the recognition that the sanctuary site near the modern village of [[Kalapodi]] is not only the site of the oracle of Apollon at Abai but that it was in constant use for cult practices from early [[Helladic period|Mycenaean]] times to the Roman period. It is thus the first site where the archaeology confirms the continuity of Mycenaean and Classical Greek religion, which has been inferred from the presence of the names of Classical Greek divinities on [[Linear B]] texts from [[Pylos]] and [[Knossos]].&lt;ref&gt;See reports of the excavations of the German Archaeological Institute in Archaeological Reports for 2008/9 43-45, Archaeological Reports for 2007/8 47-49, Archaeological Reports for 2006/7 41-43, Archaeological Reports for 2005/6 68-69, Archaeological Reports for 2004/5 55-56&lt;/ref&gt;

The fortified site described below, originally identified as Abae by Colonel [[William Leake]] in the 19th century, is much more likely to be that of the Sanctuary of Artemis at Hyampolis.   

The [[polygonal]] walls of the acropolis may still be seen in a fair state of preservation on a circular hill standing about {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the little plain of [[Exarcho]]; one gateway remains, and there are also traces of town walls below. The temple site was on a low spur of the hill, below the town. An early terrace wall supports a precinct in which are a [[stoa]] and some remains of temples; these were excavated by the [[British School at Athens]] in 1894, but little was found.

'''Abakan''' ({{lang-ru|Абака́н}}; [[Khakas language|Khakas]]: Ағбан) is the capital [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of the [[Republic of Khakassia]] in [[Russia]]. It is located in the central part of [[Minusinsk Depression]], at the [[confluence]] of the [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]] and [[Abakan River]]s, at approximately the same [[latitude]] as [[Hamburg]] and [[Minsk]].  Population: {{ru-census|p2010=165,200|p2002=165,197|p1989=154,092}}

==History==
Abakan stockaded town ({{lang|ru|Абаканский острог}}) was built at this location in 1675, also known as '''Abakansk'''. In the [[Russian Empire]], it was a part of [[Yeniseysk Governorate]]. During 1823–1931 the grown settlement was known as '''Ust-Abakanskoye''', 1914–1925: Abakan, 1925–1931: '''Khakassk'''. It received the status of town and its current name in 1931.

===Chinese exiles===
In 1940, Russian construction workers found ancient ruins during the construction of a highway between Abakan and the nearby district center village of Askyz (Аскыз). When the site was excavated by Soviet archaeologists during 1941-45, they realized that they had discovered a building absolutely unique for the area: a large (1500 square meters) Chinese-style, likely [[Han Dynasty]] era (206 BCE–220 CE) palace. The identity of the high-ranking personage who lived luxuriously in Chinese style, far outside of the borders of the Han Empire, has remained a matter for discussion ever since. Russian archaeologist L.A. Evtyukhova surmised, based on circumstancial evidence, that the palace may have been the residence of [[Li Ling (Han Dynasty)|Li Ling]], a Chinese general who had been defeated by the [[Xiongnu]] in 99 BC, and defected to them as a result.&lt;ref&gt;L.A. Evtyukhova (Л.А. Евтюхова), Southern Siberia in Ancient Times Южная Сибирь в древности). In: &quot;Tracing Ancient Cultures between the Volga and the Pacific&quot; (По следам древних культур: от Волги до Тихого Океана). Moscow, 1954, pp. 195-224.&lt;/ref&gt; While this opinion has remained popular, other views have been expressed as well.  More recently, for example, it was claimed by A.A. Kovalyov as the residence of Lu Fang ([[:zh:卢芳|盧芳]]), a [[Han Dynasty|Han]] throne pretender from the [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Guangwu]] era.&lt;ref&gt;A.A. Kovalyov (А.А. Ковалёв), [http://kronk.narod.ru/library/kovalov-aa-2007.htm ''Chinese Emperor on the Yenisy? Once more about the owner of the Tashebik &quot;Palace&quot;'' (''Китайский император на Енисее? Ещё раз о хозяине ташебинского «дворца»'')], in &quot;Ethnohistory and archaeoilogy of Northern Eurasia: theory, methodology, and the recearch practice&quot; (&quot;Этноистория и археология Северной Евразии: теория, методология и практика исследования&quot;). Irkutsk, 2007, pp.  145-148.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lithuanian exiles===
In the late eighteenth and during the nineteenth century, Lithuanian participants in the 1794, 1830–1831, and 1863 rebellions against the Russian [[czar]]ist rule were exiled to Abakan. A group of [[Labor camp|camp]]s was established, and prisoners were forced to work in the coal mines. After [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s death, Lithuanian exiles from the nearby settlements moved in&lt;ref&gt;Abakanas. Aldona Juodvalkytė. {{VLE|I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Abakan (together with [[Tayshet]]) was a terminal of the major [[Abakan-Taishet Railway]]. Now it is an important railway junction.

The city is served by the [[Abakan International Airport]].

The city has a river port, industry enterprises, [[Katanov State University of Khakasia]], and three theatres. Furthermore, it has a commercial center that produces footwear, foodstuffs, and metal products.

The 100th Air Assault Brigade of the [[Russian Airborne Troops]] was based in the city until c.1996. (Schofield, The Russian Elite)

==Sites==
Abakan's sites of interest include Holy Transfiguration Cathedral, &quot;Good Angel of Peace&quot; sculpture, park of topiary art, and many others.

==Sports==
[[Bandy]] is the biggest sport in the city. [[Sayany-Khakasiya]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sk19.ru/&lt;/ref&gt; have played in the highest division of [[Russian Bandy League]] for a long time. Last season they played in the 2nd highest division.

The '''''Arc de Triomphe''''' (''Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile'') is one of the most famous monuments in Paris. It stands in the centre of the ''[[Place Charles de Gaulle]]'' (originally named ''Place de l'Étoile''), at the western end of the ''[[Champs-Élysées]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The ''étoile'' (&quot;star&quot;) is formed by twelve radiating avenues.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a smaller arch, the ''[[Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]]'', which stands west of the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]]. The ''Arc de Triomphe'' (in English: &quot;[[Triumphal Arch]]&quot;) honours those who fought and died for France in the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the names of all French victories and generals inscribed on its inner and outer surfaces. Beneath its vault lies the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] from World War I.

The ''Arc de Triomphe'' is the linchpin of the historic axis (''[[Axe historique]]'') — a sequence of monuments and grand thoroughfares on a route which goes from the courtyard of the Louvre, to the [[Grande Arche|Grande Arche de la Défense]]. The monument was designed by [[Jean Chalgrin]] in 1806, and its [[Iconography|iconographic]] program pitted [[Heroic nudity|heroically nude]] French youths against bearded [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] warriors in [[mail (armour)|chain mail]]. It set the tone for public monuments, with triumphant patriotic messages.

The monument stands {{Convert|50|m|ft|0}} in height, {{Convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and {{Convert|22|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep. The large vault is {{Convert|29.19|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and {{Convert|14.62|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide. The small vault is  {{Convert|18.68|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and {{Convert|8.44|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide. It is the second largest [[triumphal arch]] in existence (after [[Arch of Triumph (Pyongyang)|Arch of Triumph in Pyongyang]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[North Korea]] built a [[Arch of Triumph (Pyongyang)|slightly larger Arch of Triumph]] in 1982 for the 70th birthday of [[Kim Il-Sung]].&lt;/ref&gt; Its design was inspired by the Roman [[Arch of Titus]]. The ''Arc de Triomphe'' is so colossal that three weeks after the Paris victory parade in 1919, marking the end of hostilities in World War I, [[Charles Godefroy]] flew his [[Nieuport]] biplane through it, with the event captured on newsreel.&lt;ref&gt;Melville Wallace, ''La vie d'un pilote de chasse en 1914–1918'', Flammarion, Paris, 1978. The film clip is included in The History Channel's ''Four Years of Thunder''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This film is thought still to be subject to copyright.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Godefroy flight.jpg|Photograph of the first flight through the Arc]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Arc is located on the right bank of the [[Seine]] at the centre of a pentagon-shaped configuration of twelve radiating avenues. It was commissioned in 1806 after the victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] by [[Napoleon I|Emperor Napoleon]] at the peak of his fortunes. Laying the foundations alone took two years and, in 1810, when Napoleon entered Paris from the west with his bride Archduchess [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie-Louise]] of Austria, he had a wooden mock-up of the completed arch constructed. The architect, [[Jean Chalgrin]], died in 1811 and the work was taken over by [[Jean-Nicolas Huyot]]. During the [[Bourbon Restoration]], construction was halted and it would not be completed until the reign of [[Louis Philippe I|King Louis-Philippe]], between 1833 and 1836, by the architects Goust, then Huyot, under the direction of [[Louis-Étienne Héricart de Thury|Héricart de Thury]]. On 15 December 1840, brought back to France from [[Saint Helena]], Napoleon's remains passed under it on their way to the Emperor's final resting place at the [[Invalides]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paris.org/Musees/Invalides/ Hôtel des Invalides website]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to burial in the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]], the body of [[Victor Hugo]] was exposed under the Arc during the night of 22 May 1885.

The sword carried by the ''Republic'' in the ''Marseillaise'' relief broke off on the day, it is said, that the [[Battle of Verdun]] began in 1916. The relief was immediately hidden by [[tarpaulin]]s to conceal the accident and avoid any undesired ominous interpretations{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.
On 7 August 1919, [[Charles Godefroy]] successfully flew his biplane under the Arc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.histoire-image.org/site/oeuvre/analyse.php?i=260&amp;d=441&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Navarre]] was the pilot who was tasked to make the flight, but he died on 10 July 1919 when he crashed near [[Villacoublay]] while training for the flight.

Following its construction, the ''Arc de Triomphe'' became the rallying point of French troops parading after successful military campaigns and for the annual [[Bastille Day Military Parade]]. Famous victory marches around or under the Arc have included the [[German Empire|Germans]] in 1871, the French in 1919, the [[Occupation of France by Nazi Germany|Germans]] in 1940,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwariimuseum.com/Images2005/03Arc01lg.gif Image of Nazi parade]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Liberation of Paris|French and Allies]] in 1944&lt;ref&gt;[http://pictopia.com/perl/get_image?size=457x275_mb&amp;provider_id=38&amp;ptp_photo_id=79689 Image of Liberation of Paris parade]&lt;/ref&gt; and 1945. A United States [[postage stamp]] of 1945 shows the ''Arc de Triomphe'' in the background as victorious American troops march down the Champs-Élysées and U.S. airplanes fly overhead on 29 August 1944. After the interment of the Unknown Soldier, however, all military parades (including the aforementioned post-1919) have avoided marching through the actual arch. The route taken is up to the arch and then around its side, out of respect for the tomb and its symbolism. Both Hitler in 1940 and de Gaulle in 1944 observed this custom.

By the early 1960s, the monument had grown very blackened from coal soot and automobile exhaust, and during 1965–1966 it was cleaned through [[bleaching]]. 

In the prolongation of the [[Avenue des Champs-Élysées]], a new arch, the [[Grande Arche|Grande Arche de la Défense]], was built in 1982, completing the line of monuments that forms Paris's ''Axe historique''.  After the ''Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel'' and the ''Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile'', the ''Grande Arche'' is the third arch built on the same perspective.

==The design==
The [[astylar]] design is by [[Jean Chalgrin]] (1739–1811), in the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] version of ancient [[Roman architecture]] (see, for example, the triumphal [[Arch of Titus]]). Major [[academy|academic]] sculptors of France are represented in the sculpture of the ''Arc de Triomphe'': [[Jean-Pierre Cortot]]; [[François Rude]]; [[Antoine Étex]]; [[James Pradier]] and [[Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire]]. The main sculptures are not integral [[frieze]]s but are treated as independent trophies applied to the vast [[ashlar]] masonry masses, not unlike the gilt-bronze [[appliqué]]s on [[Empire (style)|Empire furniture]]. The four sculptural groups at the base of the Arc are ''The Triumph of 1810'' (Cortot), ''Resistance'' and ''Peace'' (both by Antoine Étex) and the most renowned of them all, ''Departure of the Volunteers of 1792'' commonly called ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' (François Rude). The face of the allegorical representation of France calling forth her people on this last was used as the belt buckle for the honorary rank of [[Marshal of France]]. Since the fall of Napoleon (1815), the sculpture representing ''Peace'' is interpreted as commemorating the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|''Peace of 1815'']].
[[File:ParisPlaceEtoile.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Avenues radiate from the Arc de Triomphe in [[Place Charles de Gaulle|Place de l'Étoile]].]]
In the attic above the richly sculptured frieze of soldiers are 30 shields engraved with the names of major [[Wars of the French Revolution|Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic military victories]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro]] is described as a French victory, instead of the tactical draw that it actually was.&lt;/ref&gt; The inside walls of [[Names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe|the monument list the names of 660 persons]], among which are 558 French generals of the [[First French Empire]];&lt;ref&gt;Among the generals are at least two foreign generals, Venezuelan [[Francisco de Miranda]] and originally German [[Nicolas Luckner]].&lt;/ref&gt; the names of those who died in battle are underlined. Also inscribed, on the shorter sides of the four supporting columns, are the names of the major victorious battles of the Napoleonic Wars. The battles that took place in the period between the [[Hundred Days|departure of Napoleon from Elba to his final defeat at Waterloo]] are not included.

There was at the top of the Arc from 1882 to 1886, a monumental sculpture of [[Alexandre Falguière]], &quot;Le triomphe de la Révolution&quot; (the Triumph of the Revolution), a chariot drawn by horses preparing &quot;to crush Anarchy and Despotism&quot;, that remained only four years up there before falling in ruins.

Inside the monument, a new permanent exhibition conceived by the artist [[Maurice Benayoun]] and the architect Christophe Girault opened in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arc-de-triomphe.org/ ''Between War and Peace'']&lt;/ref&gt; The  steel and new media installation interrogates the symbolism of the national monument, questioning the balance of its symbolic message during the last two centuries, oscillating between war and peace.

==The Unknown Soldier==
[[File:Soldat inconnu 14 07 2006.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] beneath the Arc de Triomphe, Paris]]

Beneath the Arc is the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] from the [[World War I|First World War]]. Interred here on [[Armistice Day]] 1920, it has the first [[eternal flame]] lit in Western and Eastern Europe since the [[Vestal Virgin]]s' fire was extinguished in the fourth century. It burns in memory of the dead who were never identified (now in both World Wars). A ceremony is held there every 11 November on the anniversary of the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice]] signed between France and Germany in 1918. It was originally decided on 12 November 1919 to bury the unknown soldier's remains in the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]], but a public letter-writing campaign led to the decision to bury him beneath the Arc de Triomphe. The coffin was put in the chapel on the first floor of the Arc on 10 November 1920, and put in its final resting place on 28 January 1921. The slab on top carries the inscription &lt;small&gt;ICI REPOSE UN SOLDAT FRANÇAIS MORT POUR LA PATRIE 1914–1918&lt;/small&gt; (&quot;Here lies a French soldier who died for the fatherland 1914–1918&quot;).

In 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy]] and First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] of the United States paid their respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, accompanied by French President [[Charles de Gaulle]]. After the 1963 [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President Kennedy]], Mrs Kennedy remembered the eternal flame at the Arc de Triomphe and requested that an eternal flame be placed next to her husband's grave at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in Virginia. President Charles de Gaulle went to Washington to attend the state funeral, and witnessed Jacqueline Kennedy lighting the eternal flame that had been inspired by her visit to France.

==Access==

The ''Arc de Triomphe'' is accessible by the [[RER]] and [[Paris Métro|Métro]], with exit at the [[Charles de Gaulle - Étoile (Paris Métro and RER)|Charles de Gaulle—Étoile station]].

Because of heavy traffic on the roundabout of which the Arc is the centre, it is recommended that pedestrians use one of two underpasses located at the ''Champs Élysées'' and the ''Avenue de la Grande Armée''. 

A lift will take visitors almost to the top - to the attic, where there is a small museum which contains large models of the Arc and tells its story from the time of its construction. 46 steps remain to climb in order to reach the top, the ''terrasse'', from where one can enjoy a panoramic view of Paris.

'''Amazonite''' (sometimes called &quot;Amazon stone&quot;) is a green variety of [[microcline]] [[feldspar]].

The name is taken from  that of the [[Amazon River]], from which certain green stones were formerly obtained, but it is doubtful whether green [[feldspar]] occurs in the Amazon area.

Amazonite is a mineral of limited occurrence. Formerly it was obtained almost exclusively from the area of [[Miass]] in the [[Ilmen mountains]], 50 miles southwest of [[Chelyabinsk]], [[Russia]], where it occurs in granitic rocks. More recently, high-quality crystals have been obtained from [[Pikes Peak|Pike's Peak]], [[Colorado]], where it is found associated with smoky [[quartz]], [[orthoclase]], and [[albite]] in a coarse [[granite]] or [[pegmatite]]. Crystal Park, El Paso County, [[Colorado]] is a well-known locality for crystals of amazonite. Some other localities in the [[United States]] yield amazonite, and it is also found in [[pegmatite]] in [[Madagascar]] and in [[Brazil]].

Because of its bright [[green]] colour when polished, amazonite is sometimes cut and used as a [[gemstone]], although it is easily fractured.

For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Naturally, many people assumed the color was due to copper because [[copper]] compounds often have blue and green colors. More recent studies suggest that the blue-green color results from small quantities of [[lead]] and water in the feldspar. (Hoffmeister and Rossman, 1985)

'''Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder''' (18 January 1573 &amp;ndash; 1621) was a [[still life]] [[Painting|painter]] of the [[Dutch Golden Age]].

==Biography==
[[Image:Bossch low res.jpg|left|thumb|Roses, tulips, anemone, cyclamen and other flowers in a porcelain vase.]]
He was born in [[Antwerp]], where he started his career, but he spent most of it in [[Middelburg]] (1587&amp;ndash;1613), where he moved with his family because of the threat of religious persecution. He specialised in painting [[still life]]s with flowers, which he signed with the monogram AB (the B in the A).&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[http://www.rkd.nl/rkddb/dispatcher.aspx?action=search&amp;database=ChoiceArtists&amp;search=priref=11147 Ambrosius Bosschaert] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of twenty-one, he joined the city’s [[Guild of Saint Luke]] and later became dean.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; Not long after, Bosschaert had married and established himself as a leading figure in the fashionable floral painting genre. 

He had three sons who all became flower painters;  [[Ambrosius Bosschaert II|Ambrosius II]], [[Johannes Bosschaert|Johannes]] and [[Abraham Bosschaert|Abraham]]. His brother-in-law [[Balthasar van der Ast]] also lived and worked in his workshop and moved with him on his travels. Bosschaert later worked in [[Amsterdam]] (1614), [[Bergen op Zoom]] (1615&amp;ndash;1616), [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] (1616&amp;ndash;1619), and [[Breda]] (1619).&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; In 1619 when he moved to Utrecht, his brother-in-law van der Ast entered the Utrecht Guild of St. Luke, where the reknowned painter [[Abraham Bloemaert]] had just become dean. The painter [[Roelandt Savery]] (1576–1639) entered the St. Luke’s guild in Utrecht at about the same time. Savery had considerable influence on the Bosschaert dynasty.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; Bosschaert died in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; After his death, Balthasar van der Ast took over his workshop and pupils.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Style==
His bouquets were painted symmetrically and with scientific accuracy in small dimensions and normally on copper. They sometimes included symbolic and religious meanings. At the time of his death, Bosschaert commanded a thousand amateur painters for the production of one floral painting. Bosschaert became one of the first artists to specialise in still life, and in doing so he started a tradition of painting detailed flower bouquets, which typically consisted of tulips, roses and an exotic species.

===Legacy===
[[Image:Fruit still life with shells.jpg|right|thumb|250px| Fruit still life with shells painted by [[Balthasar van der Ast]].]]His sons and his pupil and brother-in-law, [[Balthasar van der Ast]], were among those to uphold the Bosschaert dynasty which continued until the mid-17th century.

It may not be a coincidence that this trend coincided with a [[Tulip mania|national obsession with exotic flowers]] which made flower portraits highly sought after.

Although he was highly in demand, he did not create many pieces because he was also employed as an art dealer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anthroposophy''', a philosophy founded by [[Rudolf Steiner]], postulates the existence of an objective, intellectually comprehensible [[spirituality|spiritual]] world accessible to direct experience through inner development. More specifically, it aims to develop faculties of perceptive imagination, inspiration and intuition through cultivating a form of thinking independent of sensory experience,&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;&gt;Robert McDermott, ''The Essential Steiner'', ISBN 0-06-065345-0, pp. 3&amp;ndash;11, 392&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.eb.com/eb/article-9007798 &quot;Anthroposophy&quot;], Encyclopedia Britannica online, accessed 10/09/07&lt;/ref&gt; and to present the results thus derived in a manner subject to rational verification.

==History==
[[File:Steiner um 1905.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudolf Steiner.]]

The early work of the founder of anthroposophy, Rudolf Steiner, culminated in his ''[[Philosophy of Freedom]]'' (also translated as ''The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity'' and ''Intuitive Thinking as a Spiritual Path''). Here, Steiner developed a concept of [[free will]] based on inner experiences, especially those that occur in the creative activity of independent thought.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;

By the beginning of the twentieth century, Steiner's interests were leading him further and further into explicitly spiritual areas of research. These studies were of interest to others who were already oriented towards spiritual ideas; among these was the [[Theosophical Society]]. Theosophy was in vogue in [[Esotericism in Germany and Austria]] during that time. From 1900 on, thanks to the positive reception given to his ideas, [[Rudolf Steiner and the Theosophical Society|Steiner's involvement with the Theosophical Society]] confirmed and reinforced his spiritual identity as a charismatic seer; this became key to breaking the feeling of imposed silence that characterised his earlier life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Ahern]], ''[http://www.sun-at-midnight.com Sun at Midnight: the Rudolf Steiner Movement and Gnosis in the West, 2nd edition]'', 2009, James Clark and Co, ISBN 978-0-227-17293-3, pp. 16, 35-36&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that he was to find not only the woman who was to become his esoteric partner and second wife, [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers|Marie von Sievers]] (owner of the Berlin Theosophical headquarters), but the answer to the question asked in his ''Autobiography'' '...how can I find the way to express in terms understandable to my contemporaries what I inwardly perceive directly as the truth?'&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner ''An Autobiography'', p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner took a leading role in the Theosophical Society's section in Germany, becoming its [[General Secretary|secretary]] in 1902. During the years of his leadership, membership increased dramatically, from a few individuals to sixty-nine Lodges.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahern2edAnthSec&quot;&gt;Of these, 55 Lodges – about 2,500 people – were to secede with Steiner to form his new Anthroposophical Society, at the end of 1912. Geoffrey Ahern, ''[http://www.sun-at-midnight.com  Sun at Midnight: the Rudolf Steiner Movement and Gnosis in the West, 2nd edition]'', 2009, James Clark and Co, ISBN 978-0-227-17293-3, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1907, a split between [[Rudolf Steiner and the Theosophical Society|Steiner and the mainstream Theosophical Society]] had begun to become apparent. While the Society was oriented toward an [[Orient|Eastern]] and especially [[India]]n approach, Steiner was trying to develop a path that embraced [[Christianity]] and [[natural science]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lachman&quot;&gt;Gary Lachman, ''Rudolf Steiner'', New York:Tarcher/Penguin ISBN 978-1-58542-543-3&lt;/ref&gt; The split became irrevocable when [[Annie Besant]], then president of the [[Theosophical Society]], began to present the child [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] as the [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] Christ. Steiner strongly objected and considered any comparison between Krishnamurti and Christ to be nonsense; many years later, Krishnamurti also repudiated the assertion. Steiner's continuing differences with Besant led him to separate from the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]]; he was followed by the great majority of the membership of the Theosophical Society's German Section, as well as members of other national sections.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahern2edAnthSec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lachman&quot;/&gt;

By this time, Steiner had reached considerable stature as a spiritual teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Ahern, Geoffrey. (1984): Sun at Midnight: the Rudolf Steiner movement and the Western esoteric tradition&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke about what he considered to be his direct experience of the [[Akashic Records]] (sometimes called the &quot;Akasha Chronicle&quot;), thought to be a spiritual chronicle of the history, pre-history, and future of the world and mankind.  In a number of works,&lt;ref&gt;especially ''How to Know Higher Worlds'' and ''An Outline of Esoteric Science''&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner described a path of inner development he felt would let anyone attain comparable spiritual experiences. Sound vision could be developed, in part, by practicing rigorous forms of ethical and cognitive self-discipline, concentration, and meditation; in particular, a person's moral development must precede the development of spiritual faculties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Goetheanum Dornach.jpg|thumb|right|Second [[Goetheanum]], seat of the Anthroposophical Society.]]
In 1912, the [[Anthroposophical Society]] was founded. After [[World War I]], the Anthroposophical movement took on new directions. Projects such as [[Waldorf education|schools]], [[Camphill Movement|centers for those with special needs]], [[biodynamic agriculture|organic farms]] and [[anthroposophical medicine|medical clinics]] were established, all inspired by anthroposophy. In 1923, faced with differences between older members focusing on inner development and younger members eager to become active in the social transformations of the time, Steiner refounded the Society in an inclusive manner and established a ''School for Spiritual Science''. As a spiritual basis for the refounded movement, Steiner wrote the mantric poem ''[[wikisource:Foundation Stone Meditation|Foundation Stone Meditation]]'' expressing the aspects of the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] in relation to the outer and spiritual worlds. Steiner died just over a year later, in 1925.

The Second World War temporarily hindered the anthroposophical movement in most of Continental Europe, as the Anthroposophical Society and most of its daughter movements (e.g. Steiner/Waldorf education) were banned by the [[National Socialist]]s (Nazis);&lt;ref&gt;Inge Hansen-Schaberg and Bruno Schonig (eds.), ''Waldorf-Pädogogik'', ISBN 3834000426&lt;/ref&gt; virtually no anthroposophists ever joined the National Socialist Party.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Zander, ''Anthroposophie in Deutschland'', ISBN 978-3-525-55452-4. P. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, national branches of the Anthroposophical Society had been established in fifty countries, and about 10,000 institutions around the world were working on the basis of anthroposophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goetheanum.org/121.html?&amp;L=1 Goetheanum]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the Anthroposophical Society was called the &quot;most important [[esoteric]] society in European history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Grote, [http://www.dradio.de/dkultur/sendungen/kulturinterview/655387/ &quot;Kosmische Wirkkräfte&quot;], German Radio interview 8 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology of ''anthroposophy''===
The term ''anthroposophy'' is from  the [[Greek language|Greek]], virtually {{lang|grc|*ανθρωποσοφία}},  from {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄνθρωπος|ἄνθρωπος]]}} &quot;human&quot;, and {{lang|grc|[[σοφία]]}} &quot;wisdom&quot;. It is listed by [[Nathan Bailey]] (1742) as meaning &quot;the knowledge of the nature of man&quot; ([[OED]]). Authors whose usage predates Steiner's include occultist [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa|Agrippa von Nettesheim]], alchemist [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughn]] (''Anthroposophia Theomagica''), and philosophers [[Immanuel Hermann Fichte]] and [[Robert von Zimmermann|Robert Zimmermann]] (''Anthroposophie im Umriss''); Steiner wrote his doctoral thesis on Fichte and attended Zimmermann's classes at the University of Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Webster, ''Encyclopedia of Angels'', &quot;Anthroposophy&quot;, pp.16-17. ISBN 9780738714622.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arikah.net/enzyklopadie/Anthroposophie#Wortgeschichte Etymology of ''anthroposophy'']; the term was also used in a [http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&amp;seq=1&amp;size=1&amp;id=nq.1863.5.9.3.71.x.373 discussion of Boehme] in ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', May 9, 1863, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner began using the word to refer to his philosophy in the early 1900s as an alternative to ''[[theosophy]]'', the term for [[Madame Blavatsky]]'s movement, itself from the Greek {{lang|grc|θεοσοφία}}, with a longer history with a meaning of &quot;[[Theosophy (history of philosophy)|divine wisdom]]&quot;.

==Anthroposophy in brief==
===Spiritual knowledge and freedom===
Anthroposophical proponents aim to extend the clarity of the [[scientific method]] to phenomena of human soul-life and to spiritual experiences. This requires developing new faculties of objective spiritual perception, which Steiner maintained was possible for humanity today. The steps of this process of inner development he identified as consciously achieved ''[[imagination]]'', ''[[:wikt:inspiration|inspiration]]'' and ''[[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;&gt;Peter Schneider, Einführung in die Waldorfpädogogik, ISBN 3-608-93006-X&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner believed results of this form of spiritual research should be expressed in a way that can be understood and evaluated on the same basis as the results of natural science:&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt; &quot;The anthroposophical schooling of thinking leads to the development of a non-sensory, or so-called supersensory consciousness, whereby the spiritual researcher brings the experiences of this realm into ideas, concepts, and expressive language in a form which people can understand who do not yet have the capacity to achieve the supersensory experiences necessary for individual research.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider20&quot;/&gt;

Steiner hoped to form a spiritual movement that would free the individual from any external authority: &quot;The most important problem of all human thinking is this: to comprehend the human being as a personality grounded in him or herself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider20&quot;&gt;Peter Schneider, ''Einführung in die Waldorfpädogogik'', pp. 20-1; Schneider quotes here from Steiner's dissertation, ''Truth and Knowledge''&lt;/ref&gt; For Steiner, the human capacity for [[rationality|rational]] thought would allow individuals to comprehend spiritual research on their own and bypass the danger of dependency on an authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider20&quot;/&gt;

Steiner contrasted the anthroposophical approach with both conventional [[mysticism]], which he considered lacking the clarity necessary for exact knowledge, and [[natural science]], which he considered arbitrarily limited to investigating the outer world.

===Nature of the human being===
[[File:Representative of humanity.gif|thumb|upright|''The Representative of Humanity'', detail of a sculpture in wood by Rudolf Steiner and Edith Maryon.]]
{{Main|Anthroposophical view of the human being}}
Steiner saw human beings as consisting of a physical body of a nature common to the inorganic world; a life body (also called the [[etheric body]]), which all living creatures (including plants) possess; the bearer of [[sentience]] or [[consciousness]] (also called the [[astral body]]), held also by all [[animal]]s; and the ego, which anchors the faculty of self-awareness unique to human beings.

Anthroposophy describes a broad evolution of human [[consciousness]] as follows. Early stages of human evolution possess an intuitive perception of reality, including a [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] perception of spiritual realities. Humanity has progressively evolved an increasing reliance on [[intellect]]ual faculties and a corresponding loss of intuitive or clairvoyant experiences, which have become atavistic. The increasing intellectualization of consciousness, initially a progressive direction of evolution, has led to an excessive reliance on [[abstraction]] and a loss of contact with both natural and spiritual realities. However, to go further requires new capacities that combine the clarity of intellectual thought with the [[imagination]], and beyond this with consciously achieved [[:wikt:inspiration|inspiration]] and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] insights.&lt;ref name=RAMcD&gt;Robert A. McDermott, &quot;Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy&quot;, in Faivre and Needleman, ''Modern Esoteric Spirituality'', ISBN 0-8245-1444-0, p. 299&amp;ndash;301; 288ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthroposophy speaks of the [[reincarnation]] of the human spirit: that the human being passes between stages of existence, incarnating into an earthly body, living on earth, leaving the body behind and entering into the spiritual worlds before returning to be born again into a new life on earth. After the [[death]] of the physical body, the human spirit recapitulates the past life, perceiving its events as they were experienced by the objects of its actions. A complex transformation takes place between the review of the past life and the preparation for the next life. The individual's [[karmic]] condition eventually leads to a choice of parents, physical body, disposition, and capacities that provide the challenges and opportunities that further development requires, which includes karmically chosen tasks for the future life.&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt;

Steiner described some conditions that determine the interdependence of a person's lives, or [[karma]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, Theosophy, ISBN 0-85440-269-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, An Outline of Esoteric Science, ISBN 0-88010-409-0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christ between Lucifer and Ahriman===
[[Lucifer]] and his counterpart [[Ahriman]] figure in anthroposophy as two polar, generally [[evil]] influences on world and human evolution. Steiner described both positive and negative aspects of both figures. He described Lucifer as the light spirit, which &quot;plays on human pride and offers the delusion of divinity&quot;, but also motivates [[creativity]] and [[spirituality]]; Ahriman as the dark spirit, which tempts human beings to &quot;...deny [their] link with divinity and to live [[materialism|entirely on the material plane]]&quot;, but also stimulates intellectuality and [[technology]]. Both figures exert a negative effect on humanity when their influence becomes misplaced or one-sided, yet their influences are necessary for human freedom to unfold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt;

According to anthroposophy, each human being has the task to find a balance between these opposing influences, and each is helped in this task by the mediation of the ''Representative of Humanity'', also known as the [[Christ]] being, a spiritual entity who stands between and harmonizes the two extremes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt;

==Applications==

Applications of anthroposophy include

===Steiner/Waldorf education===
{{Main|Waldorf education}}
This is a pedagogical movement with over 1000 [[Waldorf education|Steiner or Waldorf schools]] (the latter name stems from the first such school, founded in Stuttgart in 1919) located in some 60 countries; the great majority of these are independent (private) schools.&lt;ref&gt;German Education Research Group, [http://www.waldorfschule.info/index.71.0.3.html &quot;International Associations and Waldorf Schools in alphabetical order of country&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen of the schools have been affiliated with the United Nations' [[UNESCO ASPNet|UNESCO Associated Schools Project Network]], which sponsors education projects that foster improved quality of education throughout the world, in particular in terms of its ethical, cultural, and international dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001223/122345E.pdf Agenda Fact Sheet, ''United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization'' dated 18 April 2001] The foundation, Friends of Waldorf Education (Freunde der Erziehungskunst), is one of the 26 non-governmental organizations worldwide to maintain official relations with UNESCO.

===Anthroposophical medicine===
{{Main|Anthroposophical medicine}}
Steiner gave several series of lectures to physicians and medical students. Out of those grew a [[complementary medicine|complementary medical]] movement, which now includes hundreds of M.D.s, chiefly in Europe and North America, and has its own clinics, hospitals, and medical schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; One of the most studied applications has been the use of mistletoe extracts in cancer therapy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe Study by the National Cancer Institute on mistletoe's use for treating cancer]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special needs education and services===
{{Main|Camphill Movement}}
In 1922, [[Ita Wegman]] founded an anthroposophical center for special needs education, the Sonnenhof, in [[Switzerland]]. In 1940, [[Karl König]] founded the [[Camphill Movement]] in Scotland. The latter in particular has spread widely, and there are now over a hundred Camphill communities and other anthroposophical homes for children and adults in need of special care in about 22 countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camphill.org/history.php Camphill]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
[[File:First Goetheanum.jpg|thumb|right|The First [[Goetheanum]], designed by Steiner in 1920, [[Dornach, Switzerland]].]]
Steiner himself designed around thirteen buildings, many of them significant works in a unique, [[organic architecture|organic]]—[[expressionist architecture|expressionist architectural]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Dennis, ''Rudolf Steiner and the Way to a New Style in Architecture'', Architectural Association Journal, June 1963&lt;/ref&gt; Foremost among these are his designs for the two [[Goetheanum]] buildings in Dornach, Switzerland. Thousands of further buildings have been built by later generations of anthroposophic architects.&lt;ref&gt;Raab and Klingborg, ''Waldorfschule baut'', Verlag Freies Geistesleben, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Architects who have been strongly influenced by the anthroposophic style include [[Imre Makovecz]] in Hungary, [[Hans Scharoun]] and [[Joachim Eble]] in Germany, [[Erik Asmussen]] in Sweden,  [[Kenji Imai]] in Japan, [[Thomas Rau]], [[Anton Alberts (architect)|Anton Alberts]] and [[Max van Huut]] in Holland, [[Christopher Day]] and [[Camphill Architects]] in the UK, [[Thompson and Rose]] in America, [[Denis Bowman]] in Canada, and [[Walter Burley Griffin]] and [[Gregory Burgess]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Raab, Klingborg and Fånt, ''Eloquent Concrete, London: 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, David, ''New Organic Architecture''.

===Social finance===
{{See also|Social finance}}
Around the world today are a number of banks, companies, charities, and schools for developing co-operative forms of business using Steiner's ideas about economic associations, aiming at harmonious and socially responsible roles in the world economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; The first anthroposophic bank was the ''[[GLS bank|Gemeinschaftsbank für Leihen und Schenken]]'' in [[Bochum]], [[Germany]], founded in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gls.de/ Gemeinschaftsbank für Leihen und Schenken]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socially responsible investing|Socially responsible banks]] founded out of anthroposophy in the English-speaking world include [[Triodos Bank]], founded in 1980 and active in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Netherlands]] and [[Spain]], La Nef in France and [[RSF Social Finance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/news_press_release,132566.shtml Earth Times]&lt;/ref&gt; in San Francisco.

===Organizational development, counselling and biography work===
[[Bernard Lievegoed]], a psychiatrist, founded a new method of individual and institutional development oriented towards humanizing organizations and linked with Steiner's ideas of the threefold social order. This work is represented by the [[NPI Institute for Organizational Development]] in Holland and sister organizations in many other countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; Various forms of [[Biography Work|biographic]] and counselling work have been developed on the basis of anthroposophy.

===Speech and drama===
There are also anthroposophical movements to renew speech and drama, the most important of which are based in the work of [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]] (''speech formation'', also known as ''Creative Speech'') and the ''Chekhov Method'' originated by [[Michael Chekhov]] (nephew of [[Anton Chekhov]]).&lt;ref&gt;Byckling, L: [http://www.utoronto.ca/tsq/01/chekhovwest.shtml Michael Chekhov as Actor, Teacher and Director in the West].

==Social goals==
{{Main|Social Threefolding}}
For a period after [[World War I]], Steiner was extremely active and well-known in [[Germany]], in part because he lectured widely proposing social reforms. Steiner was a sharp critic of [[nationalism]], which he saw as outdated, and a proponent of achieving social solidarity through individual freedom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; A petition proposing a radical change in the German constitution and expressing his basic social ideas (signed by [[Herman Hesse]], among others) was widely circulated. His main book on social reform is ''Toward Social Renewal''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;

Anthroposophy continues to aim at reforming society through maintaining and strengthening the independence of the spheres of [[culture|cultural life]], [[human rights]] and the [[economy]]. It emphasizes a particular ideal in each of these three realms of society:&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;
# Freedom in cultural life
# [[Equality before the law|Equality]] of [[rights]], the sphere of [[legislation]] and the [[judiciary]]
# [[:wikt:fraternity|Fraternity]] in the [[economy|economic sphere]]

==Esoteric path==
===Paths of spiritual development===
According to Steiner, a real [[supernatural|spiritual]] world exists, out of which the material one gradually condensed and evolved. Steiner held that the spiritual world can be researched in the right circumstances through direct experience, by persons practicing rigorous forms of [[ethics|ethical]] and [[Cognition|cognitive]] [[self-discipline]]. Steiner described many exercises he said were suited to strengthening such self-discipline; the most complete exposition of these is found in his book ''How To Know Higher Worlds''. The aim of these exercises is to develop higher levels of [[higher consciousness|consciousness]] through [[meditation]] and [[observation]]. Details about the spiritual world, Steiner suggested, could on such a basis be discovered and reported, though no more infallibly than the results of natural science.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|Anthroposophy is a path of knowledge, to guide the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the universe…. Anthroposophists are those who experience, as an essential need of life, certain questions on the nature of the human being and the universe, just as one experiences hunger and thirst.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, ''Anthroposophical Leading Thoughts'' (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Steiner regarded his research reports as being important aids to others seeking to enter into spiritual experience. He suggested that a combination of spiritual exercises (for example, concentrating on an object such as a seed), moral development (control of thought, feelings and will combined with openness, tolerance and flexibility) and familiarity with other spiritual researchers' results would best further an individual's spiritual development. He consistently emphasised that any inner, spiritual practice should be undertaken in such a way as not to interfere with one's responsibilities in outer life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt;

In anthroposophy, artistic expression is also treated as a potentially valuable bridge between spiritual and material reality.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenberg, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prerequisites to and stages of inner development===
{{quote|A person seeking inner development must first of all make the attempt to give up certain formerly held inclinations. Then, new inclinations must be acquired by constantly holding the thought of such inclinations, virtues or characteristics in one's mind. They must be so incorporated into one's being that a person becomes enabled to alter his soul by his own will-power. This must be tried as objectively as a chemical might be tested in an experiment. A person who has never endeavored to change his soul, who has never made the initial decision to develop the qualities of endurance, steadfastness and calm logical thinking, or a person who has such decisions but has given up because he did not succeed in a week, a month, a year or a decade, will never conclude anything inwardly about these truths.|Rudolf Steiner|&quot;On the Inner Life&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsarchive.org/Lectures/InnDev_index.html The Inner Development of Man]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Steiner's stated prerequisites to beginning on a spiritual path include a willingness to take up serious cognitive studies, a respect for factual evidence, and a responsible attitude. Central to progress on the path itself is a harmonious cultivation of the following qualities:&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann_path&quot;&gt;[[Carlo Willmann]], ''Waldorfpädagogik'', ISBN 3-412-16700-2, pp. 10&amp;ndash;13&lt;/ref&gt;
* Control over one's own thinking
* Control over one's will
* Composure
* Positivity
* Impartiality

Steiner sees meditation as a concentration and enhancement of the power of thought. By focusing consciously on an idea, feeling or intention the meditant seeks to arrive at pure thinking, a state exemplified by but not confined to pure mathematics. In Steiner's view, conventional sensory-material knowledge is achieved through relating perception and concepts. The anthroposophic path of esoteric training articulates three further stages of supersensory knowledge, which do not necessarily follow strictly sequentially in any single individual's spiritual progress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann_path&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stein&gt;Stein, W. J., ''Die moderne naturwissenschaftliche Vorstellungsart und die Weltanschauung Goethes, wie sie Rudolf Steiner vertritt'', reprinted in Meyer, Thomas, ''W.J. Stein / Rudolf Steiner'', pp. 267&amp;ndash;75; 256&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* By focusing on symbolic patterns, images, and poetic mantras, the meditant can achieve consciously directed Imaginations that allow sensory phenomena to appear as the expression of underlying beings of a soul-spiritual nature.
* By transcending such imaginative pictures, the meditant can become conscious of the meditative activity itself, which leads to experiences of expressions of soul-spiritual beings unmediated by sensory phenomena or qualities.  Steiner calls this stage Inspiration.
* By intensifying the will-forces through exercises such as a chronologically reversed review of the day's events, the meditant can achieve a further stage of inner independence from sensory experience, leading to direct contact, and even union, with spiritual beings (&quot;Intuition&quot;) without loss of individual awareness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann_path&quot;/&gt;

===Spiritual exercises===
{{Main|Rudolf Steiner's exercises for spiritual development}}

Steiner described numerous exercises he believed would bring spiritual development; other anthroposophists have added many others. A central principle is that &quot;for every step in spiritual perception, three steps are to be taken in moral development.&quot; According to Anthroposophy, moral development reveals the extent to which one has achieved control over one's inner life and can exercise it in harmony with the spiritual life of other people; it shows the real progress in spiritual development, the fruits of which are given in spiritual perception. It also guarantees the capacity to distinguish between false perceptions or illusions (which are possible in perceptions of both the outer world and the inner world) and true perceptions, or, better said, to distinguish in any perception between the influence of subjective elements (i.e., viewpoint) and the objective reality the perception points at.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt;

==Place in Western philosophy==
Steiner built upon [[Goethe]]'s conception of an imaginative power capable of synthesizing the sense-perceptible form of a thing (an image of its outer appearance) and the concept we have of that thing (an image of its inner structure or nature). Steiner added to this the conception that a further step in the development of thinking is possible when the thinker observes his or her own thought processes. &quot;The organ of observation and the observed thought process are then identical, so that the condition thus arrived at is simultaneously one of perception through thinking and one of thought through perception.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt;

Thus, in Steiner's view, we can overcome the subject-object divide through inner activity, even though all human experience begins by being conditioned by it. In this connection, Steiner examines the step from thinking determined by outer impressions to what he calls sense-free thinking. He characterizes thoughts he considers without sensory content, such as mathematical or logical thoughts, as free deeds. Steiner believed he had thus located the origin of free will in our thinking, and in particular in sense-free thinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt;

Some of the [[Epistemology|epistemic]] basis for Steiner's later anthroposophical work is contained in the seminal work, [[Philosophy of Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Pifer, &quot;Saul Bellow Against the Grain&quot;, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1990; see also Steiner's doctoral thesis, ''Truth and Science''&lt;/ref&gt; In his early works, Steiner sought to overcome what he perceived as the dualism of [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] idealism and [[Kant]]ian subjectivism by developing Goethe's conception of the human being as a natural-supernatural entity, that is: natural in that humanity is a product of nature, supernatural in that through our conceptual powers we extend nature's realm, allowing it to achieve a reflective capacity in us as philosophy, art and science.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tarnas&quot;&gt;Richard Tarnas, ''The Passion of the Western Mind'', ISBN 0712673326&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner was one of the first European philosophers to overcome the subject-object split in [[Western thought]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tarnas&quot;/&gt; Though not well-known among philosophers, his philosophical work was taken up by [[Owen Barfield]] (and through him influenced the [[Inklings]], an [[Oxford]] group of Christian writers that included [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[C. S. Lewis]])&lt;ref&gt;Doris T. Myers, &quot;C.S. Lewis in Context.&quot;  Kent State University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Tarnas]].

===Possibility of a union of science and spirit===
Steiner believed in the possibility of applying the clarity of scientific thinking to spiritual experience, which he saw as deriving from an objectively existing spiritual world.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Lindenberg, ''Rudolf Steiner'', Rowohlt 1992, ISBN 3-499-50500-2, pp. 77ff&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner identified [[mathematics]], which attains certainty through thinking itself, thus through inner experience rather than empirical observation,&lt;ref&gt;Albert Einstein, [http://www.tu-harburg.de/rzt/rzt/it/Geometry.html Geometry and Experience]&lt;/ref&gt; as the basis of his [[epistemology]] of spiritual experience.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Anthroposophy and Science'', lecture of March 16, 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to religion==
===Christ as the center of earthly evolution===
Steiner's writing, though appreciative of all religions and cultural developments, emphasizes Western tradition as having evolved to meet contemporary needs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lachman&quot;/&gt; He describes Christ and his mission on earth of bringing individuated consciousness as having a particularly important place in human evolution,&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; whereby:&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt;
*Christianity has evolved out of previous religions;
*The being which manifests in Christianity also manifests in all faiths and religions, and each religion is valid and true for the time and cultural context in which it was born;
*All historical forms of Christianity need to be transformed considerably to meet the continuing evolution of humanity.

{{quote|Spiritual science does not want to usurp the place of Christianity; on the contrary it would like to be instrumental in making Christianity understood. Thus it becomes clear to us through spiritual science that the being whom we call Christ is to be recognized as the center of life on earth, that the Christian religion is the ultimate religion for the earth's whole future. Spiritual science shows us particularly that the pre-Christian religions outgrow their one-sidedness and come together in the Christian faith. It is not the desire of spiritual science to set something else in the place of Christianity; rather it wants to contribute to a deeper, more heartfelt understanding of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner,[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/AntChr_index.html &quot;Anthroposophy and Christianity&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, anthroposophy considers there to be a being who unifies all religions, and who is not represented by any particular religious faith. This being is, according to Steiner, not only the Redeemer of [[the Fall of Man|the Fall from Paradise]], but also the unique pivot and meaning of earth's evolutionary processes and of human history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt; To describe this being, Steiner periodically used terms such as the &quot;Representative of Humanity&quot; or the &quot;good spirit&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf|title=The foundations of human experience|year=1996|publisher=Anthroposophic Press|isbn=0880103922|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf|title=A Chapter of Occult History|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/19081216p01.html|date=December 16, 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than any denominational term.

This view has certain similarities to the concepts of Christogenesis advocated by [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]].

===Divergence from conventional Christian thought===
Steiner's views of [[Christianity]] diverge from conventional Christian thought in key places, and include [[gnostism|gnostic]] elements:

* One central point of divergence is Steiner's views on [[reincarnation]] and [[karma]].
* Steiner differentiated three contemporary paths by which he believed it possible to arrive at [[Christ]]:
** Through heart-filled experiences of the [[Gospels]]; Steiner described this as the historically dominant path, but becoming less important in the future.
** Through inner experiences of a spiritual reality; this Steiner regarded as increasingly the path of spiritual or religious seekers today.
** Through [[initiation|initiatory experiences]] whereby the reality of Christ's death and resurrection are experienced; Steiner believed this is the path people will increasingly take.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt;
* Steiner also believed that there were two different [[Jesus]] children involved in the [[Incarnation]] of the [[Christ]]: one child descended from [[Solomon]], as described in the [[Gospel of Matthew]], the other child from [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], as described in the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; (The genealogies given in the two gospels diverge some thirty generations before Jesus' birth, and 'Jesus' was a common name in biblical times.)
* His view of [[the second coming]] of Christ is also unusual; he suggested that this would not be a physical reappearance, but that the Christ being would become manifest in non-physical form, visible to spiritual vision and apparent in community life for increasing numbers of people beginning around the year 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/ReapChrist/19100125p01.html &quot;The Appearance of Christ in the Etheric World&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* He emphasized his belief that in the future humanity would need to be able to recognize the ''Spirit of Love'' in all its genuine forms, regardless of what name would be used to describe this being. He also warned that the traditional name of the ''Christ'' might be misused, and the true essence of this being of love ignored.

===The Christian Community===
{{Main|Christian Community}}
Towards the end of Steiner's life, a group of theology students (primarily Lutheran, with some Roman Catholic members) approached Steiner for help in reviving Christianity, in particular &quot;to bridge the widening gulf between modern science and the world of spirit.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; They approached a notable [[Lutheran]] pastor, [[Friedrich Rittelmeyer]], who was already working with Steiner's ideas, to join their efforts. Out of their co-operative endeavor, the ''Movement for Religious Renewal'', now generally known as [[The Christian Community]], was born. Steiner emphasized that he considered this movement, and his role in creating it, to be independent of his anthroposophical work,&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; as he wished anthroposophy to be independent of any particular [[religion]] or religious denomination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt;

==Reception of anthroposophy==
===Notable supporters===
Anthroposophy has had many prominent supporters outside of the movement.
Among these have been many writers, artists and musicians; these include Pulitzer Prize-winning and Nobel Laureate [[Saul Bellow]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fulford, &quot;Bellow: the novelist as homespun philosopher&quot;, The National Post, October 23, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrei Bely]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/bely.htm Books and Writers, ''Andrey Bely'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Elsworth, ''Andrej Bely:A Critical Study of the Novels'', Cambridge:1983, cf.

===Scientific basis===
Though Rudolf Steiner studied [[natural science]] at the Vienna Technical University at the undergraduate level, his [[doctorate]] was in [[epistemology]] and very little of his work is directly concerned with the empirical sciences. In his mature work, when he did refer to science it was often to present phenomenological or [[Goethean science]] as an alternative to what he considered the materialistic science of his contemporaries.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt; 

His primary interest was in applying the methodology of science to realms of inner experience and the spiritual worlds (Steiner's appreciation that the essence of science is its method of inquiry is unusual among [[esoteric]]ists&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt;), and Steiner called anthroposophy ''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'' (lit.: Science of the mind, or cultural or spiritual science), a term generally used in German to refer to the [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philolex.de/geistwis.htm Philolex entry]&lt;/ref&gt; in fact, the term &quot;[[science]]&quot; is used more broadly in [[Europe]] as a general term that refers to any exact knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Barzun, ''Science: The Glorious Entertainment'', Harper and Row 1964. P. 191&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Anthroposophy's] methodology is to employ a scientific way of thinking, but to apply this methodology, which normally excludes our inner experience from consideration, instead to the human being proper.&lt;ref name=Stein/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whether this is a sufficient basis for anthroposophy to be considered a spiritual science has been a matter of controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;&gt;Carlo Willmann, ''Waldorfpädagogik: Theologische und religionspädagogische Befunde'', ISBN 3-412-16700-2, Chap. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hammer&gt;Olav Hammer, ''Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age'', Brill 2004, pp. 243, 329, 204, 225&amp;ndash;8&lt;/ref&gt; As Freda Easton explained in her study of Waldorf schools, &quot;Whether one accepts anthroposophy as a science depends upon whether one accepts Steiner's interpretation of a science that extends the consciousness and capacity of human beings to experience their inner spiritual world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Freda Easton, ''The Waldorf Impulse in Education'', Columbia University dissertation 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sven Ove Hansson]] has disputed anthroposophy's claim to a scientific basis, stating that its ideas are not empirically derived and neither reproducible nor testable.&lt;ref&gt;Sven Ove Hansson, ''Is Anthroposophy Science?'', Professor, Philosophy Unit of the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology, in Conceptus XXV (1991), No. 64, pp. 37&amp;ndash;49.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Carlo Willmann points out that as, on its own terms, anthroposophical methodology offers no possibility of being falsified except through its own procedures of spiritual investigation, no [[intersubjectivity|intersubjective validation]] is possible by conventional scientific methods; it thus cannot stand up to [[positivism|positivistic science]]'s criticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt; Peter Schneider calls such objections untenable on the grounds that if a non-sensory, non-physical realm exists, then according to Steiner the experiences of pure thinking possible within the normal realm of consciousness would already be experiences of that, and it would be impossible to exclude the possibility of empirically grounded experiences of other supersensory content.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt; 

Olav Hammer suggests that anthroposophy carries [[scientism]] &quot;to lengths unparalleled in any other Esoteric position&quot; due to its dependence upon claims of clairvoyant experience, its subsuming natural science under &quot;spiritual science&quot;, and its development of what Hammer calls &quot;fringe&quot; sciences such as [[anthroposophical medicine]] and [[biodynamic agriculture]] justified partly on the basis of the ethical and ecological values they promote, rather than purely on a scientific basis.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt;

Though Steiner saw that spiritual vision itself is difficult for others to achieve, he recommended open-mindedly exploring and rationally testing the results of such research; he also urged others to follow a spiritual training that would allow them directly to apply the methods he used eventually to achieve comparable results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt; Some results of Steiner's research have been investigated and supported by scientists working to further and extend scientific observation in directions suggested by an anthroposophical approach.&lt;ref&gt;''Genetics and the Manipulation of Life, The Forgotten Factor of Context'', by biologist Craig Holdrege; ''The Wholeness of Nature, Goethe's Way toward A Science of Conscious Participation in Nature'', by physicist Henri Bortoft; ''Developmental Dynamics in Humans and Other Primates'', by theoretical chemist Jos Verhulst.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious nature===
As an explicitly spiritual movement, anthroposophy has sometimes been called a religious philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=anthroposophy definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561500913/anthroposophy.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kyWUo6lQ|archivedate=2009-11-01|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, a California federal court ruled that a group alleging that anthroposophy is a religion for [[Establishment Clause]] purposes did not provide any legally admissible evidence in support of this view; the case is under appeal. In 2000, a French court ruled that a government minister's description of anthroposophy as a cult was defamatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Statements on race===
Anthroposophical ideas have been criticized from both sides in the race debate; for their strong stance against racism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;From the mid-1930s on, [[National Socialist]] ideologues attacked the anthroposophical world-view as being opposed to Nazi racist and nationalistic principles; anthroposophy considered &quot;Blood, Race and Folk&quot; as primitive instincts that must be overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Wilhelm Hauer, 7. Februar 1935. BAD R 4901&amp;ndash;3285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Report of the SD-Hauptamtes Berlin: &quot;Anthroposophy”, May 1936, BAD Z/B I 904.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
as well as for rankings of races that occur in Steiner's philosophy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...with regard to race, a naive version of the evolution of consciousness, a theory foundational to both Steiner's anthroposophy and Waldorf education, sometimes places one race below another in one or another dimension of development.&lt;ref name=&quot;McDermott&quot;&gt;Ray McDermott et al.: [http://www.springerlink.com/content/5q9t836w350v8768/ ''Waldorf education in an inner-city public school''.] The Urban Review, Volume 28, Number 2 / June, 1996, pp. 119&amp;ndash;140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Anthroposophical Society in America has stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We explicitly reject any racial theory that may be construed to be part of Rudolf Steiner's writings. The Anthroposophical Society in America is an open, public society and it rejects any purported spiritual or scientific theory on the basis of which the alleged superiority of one race is justified at the expense of another race.&lt;ref&gt;The General Council of the Anthroposophical Society in America (1998) [http://web.archive.org/web/20080106140711/http://www.anthroposophy.org/Gov/StatementOnDiversity.php Position Statement on Diversity].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''aurochs''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|aʊ|r|ɒ|k|s}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔr|ɒ|k|s}}; also '''urus''', '''''Bos primigenius'''''), the ancestor of domestic [[cattle]], was a type of huge wild cattle which inhabited [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North Africa]], but is now [[extinct]]; it survived in Europe until 1627.

The aurochs were far larger than most modern domestic cattle with a shoulder height of {{Convert|2|m|ft}} and weight of {{Convert|1000|kg|lb|-2}}. The aurochs was regarded as a challenging [[hunting]] quarry animal, contributing to its extinction. The last recorded aurochs, a female, died in 1627 in the Jaktorów Forest, [[Poland]], and her skull is now the property of the [[Livrustkammaren]] (&quot;Royal Armory&quot;) museum in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.

Representations and descriptions of aurochs appear in prehistoric cave paintings, in [[Julius Caesar]]'s ''The Gallic War'', and as the national symbol of many [[Europe]]an countries, states and cities such as [[Alba-Iulia]], [[Kaunas]], [[Romania]], [[Moldavia]], [[Turka,_Ukraine|Turka]], [[Mecklenburg]], and [[Uri (canton)|Uri]]. The Swiss canton Uri was named after this animal species.

Domestication of bovines occurred in several parts of the world but at roughly the same time, about 8,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, possibly all derived from the aurochs. In 1920, the Heck brothers, who were [[Germans|German]] biologists, attempted to recreate aurochs. The resulting cattle are known as [[Heck cattle]] or Reconstructed Aurochs, and number in the thousands in Europe today. However, they are genetically and physiologically distinct from aurochs.  The Heck brothers' aurochs also have a pale yellow dorsal stripe, instead of white.

==Nomenclature==
[[Image:Bos primigenius Vig uroksen.jpg|thumb|left|This specimen is from around 7500 BC and is one of two very well preserved aurochs skeletons found in Denmark. The Vig-aurochs can be seen at The National Museum of Denmark. The circles indicate where the animal was wounded by arrows.]]
The words &quot;aurochs&quot;, &quot;urus&quot;, and &quot;[[wisent]]&quot;&amp;nbsp;have all been used [[synonym]]ously in English.&lt;ref&gt;AHD4, headwords &quot;aurochs&quot;, &quot;urus&quot;, &quot;wisent&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MWU, headwords &quot;aurochs&quot;, &quot;urus&quot;, &quot;wisent&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the extinct aurochs/urus is a completely separate species from the still-extant [[European bison|wisent]].


The animal's original scientific name, ''Bos primigenius'', was meant as a [[Latin]] translation of the [[German language|German]] term ''{{lang|de|Auerochse}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Urochs}}'', which was (possibly incorrectly) interpreted as literally meaning &quot;primeval ox&quot; or &quot;proto-ox&quot;. This scientific name is now considered invalid by the [[Integrated Taxonomic Information System]] (ITIS), which classifies aurochs under ''Bos taurus'' &amp;ndash; the same species as domestic cattle. In 2003, however, the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] &quot;conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species, which are pre-dated by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://iczn.org/content/biodiversity-studies ICZN, Biodiversity Studies &lt;!--BZN Volume 63, Part 3, 30 September 2006 General Articles &amp; Nomenclatural Notes--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; confirming ''Bos primigenius'' for the Aurochs. Taxonomists who consider domesticated [[cattle]] a subspecies of the wild Aurochs should use ''B. primigenius taurus''; the name ''B. taurus'' remains available for domestic cattle where it is considered to be a separate species.

==Origin==
[[Image:Long horned european wild ox.jpg|right|thumb|An aurochs fighting off a [[Eurasian Wolf]] pack]]
According to the [[Paleontologisk Museum]], [[University of Oslo]], aurochs evolved in [[India]] some two million years ago, migrated into the [[Middle East]] and further into [[Asia]], and reached [[Europe]] about 250,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toyen.uio.no/palmus/galleri/montre/english/a31922.htm Paleontologisk Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; They were once considered a distinct species from modern European [[cattle]] (''Bos taurus''), but more recent taxonomy has rejected this distinction.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The South Asian domestic cattle, or [[zebu]], descended from a different group of aurochs at the edge of the [[Thar Desert]]; this would explain the zebu's resistance to [[drought]]. Domestic [[yak]], [[gayal]] and [[Javan cattle]] do not descend from aurochs. Modern cattle have become much smaller than their wild forebears. Aurochs were about {{Convert|1.75|m|ftin|sigfig=2}} tall, while a very large domesticated cow is about {{Convert|1.5|m|ftin}} and most domestic cattle are much smaller than this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mycattle.com/health/dsp_health_article.cfm?storyid=9204 Height] of [[Holstein cattle|Holstein]] cows (at hips &amp;ndash; note that cattle are often slightly taller at the withers than the hips).&lt;/ref&gt; Aurochs also had several features rarely seen in modern cattle, such as [[lyre]]-shaped horns set at a forward angle, a pale stripe down the spine, and [[sexual dimorphism]] of coat color. Males were black with a pale [[eel stripe]] or [[finching (cattle)|finching]] down the spine, while females and calves were reddish (these colours are still found in a few domesticated cattle breeds, such as [[Jersey cattle]]). Aurochs were also known to have very aggressive temperaments and killing one was seen as a great act of courage in ancient cultures.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Subspecies===
{{refimprove|section|date=January 2010}}
[[File:Bos primigenius map.jpg|450px|thumb|Map, after Cis Van Vuure's ''Retracing the Aurochs: History, Morphology &amp; Ecology of an Extinct Wild Ox'']]
Three wild subspecies of aurochs are recognized. Only the Eurasian subspecies survived until recent times.:

*The '''Eurasian subspecies''' (''Bos primigenius primigenius'') once ranged across the [[steppe]]s and [[taiga]]s of [[Europe]], [[Siberia]], and [[Central Asia]]. It is part of the famous [[Pleistocene megafauna]], and declined in numbers along with other megafauna species by the end of [[Pleistocene]]. The Eurasian aurochs were domesticated into modern taurine [[cattle]] breeds around the 6th millennium BC, in the Middle East, and possibly also at about the same time in the Far East. Aurochs were still widespread in [[Europe]] by the time of the [[Roman Empire]], when they were widely popular as a battle beast in [[Amphitheatre#Roman amphitheatres|Roman arena]]s, and excessive hunting began and continued until it was nearly extinct. By the 13th century, aurochs existed only in low numbers in [[Eastern Europe]], and hunting of aurochs became a privilege of nobles, and later royal households. The decreased hunting did not save the aurochs from extinction, and the last recorded live aurochs, a female, died in 1627 in the Jaktorów Forest, [[Poland]] from natural causes.

*The '''Indian subspecies''' (''[[Bos primigenius namadicus]]''), the Indian Aurochs, once lived in the hot and dry areas of [[India]]. It was the first subspecies of the aurochs to appear, at 2 million years ago, and from it descends the [[Eurasian Aurochs]] and the [[African Aurochs]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, and from about 9000 BC it was domesticated as [[zebu]] cattle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12692&amp;page=96 In the Light of Evolution III: Two Centuries of Darwin] (2009), ''page 96'', [[National Academies Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

*The '''North African subspecies''' (''[[Bos primigenius mauretanicus]]''), the African Aurochs, once lived in the woodland and shrubland of [[North Africa]]. It is descended from the [[Indian Aurochs]], which migrated from the Middle East.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} It is unknown when the North African Aurochs became extinct. Prior to its extinction the [[Ancient Egyptians]] may have domesticated the African Aurochs into [[Egyptian cattle]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} which was the primary breed of cattle in the Mediterranean region{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} until the introduction of [[zebu]] from India, which slowly replaced Egyptian cattle in the region.{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}&lt;!-- What about sub-Saharan non-zebu African cattle? Where did they come from and who domesticated them? --&gt;

==Behavioral patterns==
The recovery pattern of aurochs remains lead to the belief that they preferred swampy and [[Wet woodland|wet wooded]] areas and, like modern cattle, could swim for short distances enabling them to inhabit islands within their range. Their diet is thought to have consisted of green grass and leaves with occasional tree fruits. Aurochs species were found to have lived on the island of [[Sicily]] where once there was a land bridge to Italy. After disappearance of the land bridge, Sicilian aurochs evolved to a size 20% smaller than their mainland relatives. Although the [[European bison]] prefers drier forest they would most certainly have lived in areas overlapping aurochs territory. Little else is known about Aurochs habits. Although they survived until the 17th century in Poland, they were in competition with modern cattle for food and hunted by humans contributing to their extinction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aurochs Extinct Species, Mammals&quot;&gt;Cis T Van Vuure, Retracing the Aurochs: History, Morphology and Ecology of an Extinct Wild Ox, [http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/speciesinfo/aurochs.htm Aurochs (Extinct Species, Mammals)], The Extinction Website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetics ==
The first complete mitochondrial genome (16,338 [[base pairs]]) DNA sequence analysis of ''Bos primigenius'' from an archaeologically verified and exceptionally well preserved aurochs bone sample was published in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards 2010&quot;/&gt;

==Domestication and extinction==
[[Image:Bos primigenius Czaszka tura.jpg|right|thumb|Skull of an aurochs]]
[[Image:Jaktorow pomnik tura.jpg|right|thumb|Monument to the last aurochs in [[Jaktorów]], Poland]]

The now-extinct aurochs ''Bos primigenius'', which ranged throughout much of [[Eurasia]] and [[Northern Africa]] during the [[late Pleistocene]] and early [[Holocene]], is widely accepted as the wild ancestor of modern cattle. Archaeological evidence shows that domestication of this formidable animal occurred independently in the [[Near East]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]] between 10,000–8,000 years ago, giving rise to the two major domestic taxa observed today — humpless ''[[Bos taurus]]'' (taurine) and humped ''[[Bos indicus]]'' (zebu), respectively. This is confirmed by genetic analyses of matrilineal [[mitochondrial DNA]] sequences, which reveal a marked differentiation between modern ''Bos taurus'' and ''Bos indicus'' [[haplotype]]s, demonstrating their derivation from two geographically and genetically divergent wild populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards 2010&quot;/&gt;

Domestication of the aurochs began in the southern [[Caucasus]] and northern [[Mesopotamia]] from about the 6th millennium BC, while genetic evidence suggests that aurochs were independently domesticated in [[India]] and possibly in northern [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradley DG, MacHugh DE, Cunningham P, Loftus RT, &quot;Mitochondrial diversity and the origins of African and European cattle&quot;, ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Science'', U S A, May 14, 1996; '''93'''(10):5131-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Domesticated cattle and aurochs are so different in size that they have been regarded as separate species; however, large ancient cattle and aurochs &quot;are difficult to classify because morphological traits have overlapping distributions in cattle and aurochs and diagnostic features are identified only in horn and some cranial element.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aurochs Extinct Species, Mammals&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beja&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1472438/pdf/zpq8113.pdf The origin of European cattle: Evidence from modern and ancient DNA], Albano Beja-Pereira, et al., ''PNAS'', May 23, 2006, vol. 103, no. 21, 8113–8118&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetic testing|Comparison]] of aurochs bones with those of modern cattle has provided many insights about the aurochs. Remains of the beast, from specimens believed to have weighed more than a ton, have been found in [[Mesolithic]] sites around [[Goldcliff]], [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

 | number = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though aurochs became extinct in Britain during the [[Bronze age]], analysis of bones from aurochs that lived in the same age as domesticated cattle there showed no genetic contribution to modern breeds. As a result of this study, modern European cattle were thought to have descended directly from the [[Near East]] domestication. Another study, however, found distinct similarities between modern breeds and Italian aurochs specimens suggesting that the previously tested British aurochs were not a good model of the diversity of aurochs genetics and suggesting possible North African and European aurochs input to domestic breeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beja&quot;/&gt;

Indian cattle ([[zebu]]), although domesticated eight to ten thousand years ago, are related to aurochs which diverged from the Near Eastern ones some 200,000 years ago. African cattle are thought to descend from aurochs more closely related to the Near Eastern ones. The Near East and African aurochs groups are thought to have split some 25,000 years ago, probably 15,000 years before domestication. The &quot;[[Turano-Mongolian]]&quot; type of cattle now found in Northern China, Mongolia, Korea and Japan may represent a fourth domestication event (and a third event among ''[[Bos taurus]]''&amp;ndash;type aurochs). This group may have diverged from the Near East group some 35,000 years ago. Whether these separate genetic populations would have equated to separate subspecies is unclear.

The maximum range of the aurochs was from [[Europe]] (excluding Ireland and northern [[Scandinavia]]), to northern [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[India]] and central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;http://members.chello.nl/~t.vanvuure/oeros/uk/lutra.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/highlands_and_islands/8516598.stm | work=BBC News | first=Steven | last=McKenzie | title=Ancient giant cattle genome first | date=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 13th century A.D., the aurochs' range was restricted to [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Moldavia]], [[Transylvania]] and [[East Prussia]]. The right to hunt large animals on any land was restricted to nobles and gradually to the royal household. As the population of aurochs declined, hunting ceased but the royal court still required gamekeepers to provide open fields for the aurochs to graze in. The gamekeepers were exempted from local taxes in exchange for their service and a decree made [[poaching]] an aurochs punishable by death. In 1564, the gamekeepers knew of only 38 animals, according to the royal survey. The last recorded live aurochs, a female, died in 1627 in the [[Jaktorów]] Forest, [[Poland]] from natural causes. The skull was later robbed by the [[Swedish Army]] during the [[Deluge (history)|Swedish invasion of Poland]] (1655–1660) and is now the property of [[Livrustkammaren]] in [[Stockholm]]. The causes of extinction were hunting, a narrowing of habitat due to the development of farming, climatic changes, and diseases transmitted by domestic cattle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://74.125.93.132/search?q=cache:6TgwOZ4DwyIJ:agtr.ilri.cgiar.org/agtrweb/Documents/Library/docs/agri16_95.pdf+Mieczyslaw+Rokosz+Aurochs&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ca&amp;client=firefox-a HISTORY OF THE AUROCHS (BOS TAURUS PRIMIGENIUS) IN POLAND by Mieczyslaw Rokosz’; Published in Animal Genetic Resources Information (1995) published under the joint auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations Envirornment Programme (UNEP)] (Pdf of 1995 issue of the Animal Genetic Resources Information - This publication contains the papers presented during a workshop held at the Willem Prinsloo Agricultural Museum in Pretoria in March 1994.

==Re-creation==
[[Image:Heck cattle male.jpg|thumb|left|[[Heck cattle]]]]
In the 1920s two German zoo directors (in [[Berlin]] and [[Munich]]), the brothers [[Heinz Heck|Heinz]] and [[Lutz Heck]], began a [[selective breeding]] program in the attempt to breed the aurochs back into existence (see ''[[breeding back]]'') from the domestic cattle that were their descendants. Their plan was based on the concept that a species is not extinct as long as all its genes are still present in a living population. The result is the breed called ''[[Heck cattle]]'', &quot;Recreated Aurochs&quot;, or &quot;Heck Aurochs&quot;, which bears some resemblance to what is known about the ''appearance'' of the wild aurochs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aurochs Extinct Species, Mammals&quot;/&gt;

Scientists of the Polish Foundation for Recreating the Aurochs (PFOT) in Poland want to use DNA from bones in museums to recreate the aurochs and return this animal to the forests of Poland. The project has gained the support of the Polish Ministry of the Environment. They plan research on ancient preserved DNA. Other research projects{{Which?|date=January 2010}} have extracted &quot;ancient&quot; DNA over the past twenty years and their results published in such periodicals as ''Nature'' and ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA''.{{Full|date=January 2010}} Polish scientists believe that modern genetics and biotechnology make recreating an animal almost identical to aurochs possible. They say this research will lead to examining the causes of the extinction of the aurochs, and help prevent a similar occurrence with domestic cattle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naukawpolsce.pap.pl/palio/html.run?_Instance=cms_naukapl.pap.pl&amp;_PageID=1&amp;s=szablon.depesza&amp;dz=szablon.depesza&amp;dep=68335&amp;data=&amp;lang=EN&amp;_CheckSum=-442536143 Polish geneticists want to recreate the extinct auroch; 2007-11-28; Science and Scholarship in Poland; Polish Press Agency (PAP)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;!-- This is only a press release: need a proper ref. --&gt;

In a similar program, Project Tauros&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stichtingtaurus.nl/NIEUWS/index.php?newsPeriod=archive Stichting Taurus Vee], 2010 (Dutch)]&lt;/ref&gt; is trying to DNA sequence breeds of modern cattle to find gene sequences which match those found in &quot;ancient DNA&quot; from aurochs samples. The modern cattle would then be selectively bred to try to bring the aurochs-type genes back into a single animal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1961918,00.html Breeding Ancient Cattle Back from Extinction], ''TIME'', Stephan Faris, Feb. 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Johan van Arendonk, a professor of animal-breeding and genetics at Wageningen University is quoted as saying, ''&quot;It's still a very open question if it all can be done.&quot;''

* Aurochs are depicted in many Paleolithic European and Mesopotamia  [[cave painting]]s such as those found at [[Lascaux]] and [[Livernon]] in [[France]], when drawn in profile only one horn was seen, which some researchers say gave rise to the legend or [[Greek mythology|Greek]] mythos of the [[unicorn]]. Early carvings of the aurochs have also been found. The impressive and dangerous aurochs survived into the [[Iron Age]] in [[Anatolia]] and the [[Near East]], and was worshipped throughout that area as a sacred animal, the [[Bull (mythology)|Lunar Bull]], associated with the [[Great Goddess]]{{Which?|date=February 2011}} and later with [[Mithras]].
* A 1999 archaeological dig in [[Peterborough]], England, uncovered the skull of an aurochs. The front part of the skull had been removed but the horns remained attached. The supposition is that the killing of the aurochs in this instance was a sacrificial act.
* Aurochs are depicted on the [[Ishtar Gate]].
* The ancient name of the [[Estonia]]n town of [[Rakvere]], ''Tarwanpe'' or ''Tarvanpea'', probably derives from ''Auroch's head'' (''Tarva pea'') in ancient [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. A 3.5m high and 7.1m long Statue of an Aurochs was opened in Rakvere in 2002, for the town's 700th birthday. The sculpture, made by artist [[Tauno Kangro]], has become a symbol of the town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rakvere.ee/print.php?main=518 Rakvere linn] {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- * The [[Hebrew Bible]] contains numerous references to the untameable strength of ''[[re'em]]'', traditionally translated as &quot;[[unicorn]]&quot; but recognized for the last century as Aurochs.&lt;ref&gt;The identification was first made by Johann Ulrich Duerst, ''Die Rinder von Babylonian, Assyrien und Ägypten''(Berlin, 1899:7-8), and was generally accepted, as by Salo Jonas, &quot;Cattle Raising in Palestine&quot; ''Agricultural History'' '''26'''.3 (July 1952), pp. 93-104&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
* The wild-ox called ''re'em'' (Strong's # 07214) in the [[Bible]] (Numbers 23:22 and 24:8, Deuteronomy 33:17, Job 39:9–10, Psalms 22:21, 29:6, 92:10 and Isaiah 34:7) is occasionally associated with the aurochs and has incorrectly been translated as &quot;unicorn&quot; in the past (''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia,'' Entry for 'Wild Ox', Copyright, 1939, by Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.).
* Julius Caesar wrote about aurochs in ''Gallic War'' Chapter 6.28, &quot;...those animals which are called uri. These are a little below the elephant in size, and of the appearance, color, and shape of a bull. Their strength and speed are extraordinary; they spare neither man nor wild beast which they have espied. These the Germans take with much pains in pits and kill them. The young men harden themselves with this exercise, and practice themselves in this sort of hunting, and those who have slain the greatest number of them, having produced the horns in public, to serve as evidence, receive great praise. But not even when taken very young can they be rendered familiar to men and tamed. The size, shape, and appearance of their horns differ much from the horns of our oxen. These they anxiously seek after, and bind at the tips with silver, and use as cups at their most sumptuous entertainments.&quot;
* An aurochs head, the traditional arms of the German region [[Mecklenburg]], is included in the [[coat of arms of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. The aurochs (&quot;bour&quot; in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], probably derived from lat. ''bos urus'' → ''bourus'' → ''bour'') was also the symbol of [[Moldavia]]; nowadays they can be found in the coat of arms of both [[Coat of arms of Romania|Romania]] and [[Coat of arms of Moldova|Moldova]]. The horn of the aurochs is a charge of the coat of arms of [[Tauragė]], [[Lithuania]]. It is also present in the emblem of [[Kaunas]], Lithuania, and was part of the emblem of [[Bukovina]] during its time as a ''[[Cisleithania|Kronland]]'' of [[Austria-Hungary]]. The Swiss Canton of [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] is named after the aurochs; its yellow flag shows a black aurochs head.

'''Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)''' is a switching technique for telecommunication networks.  It uses asynchronous [[time-division multiplexing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-I.150-199902-I!!PDF-E&amp;type=items|title=Recommendation I.150, B-ISDN Asynchronous Transfer Mode Functional Characteristics |publisher=ITU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;McDysan 1999 287&quot;&gt;{{citation | last = McDysan | year = 1999 | page = 287}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it encodes data into small, fixed-sized ''[[cell relay|cells]].'' This differs from networks such as the [[Internet Protocol|Internet]] or [[Ethernet|Ethernet LANs]] that use variable sized ''[[Packet switching|packets]]'' or ''[[Frame Relay|frames]].'' ATM provides [[data link layer]] services that run over [[OSI model|OSI]] [[Layer 1]] physical links.  ATM has functional similarity with both [[Circuit switching|circuit]] switched networking and small packet switched networking.  This makes it a good choice for a network that must handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic (e.g., file transfers), and [[Real-time computing|real-time]], [[Latency (engineering)|low-latency]] content such as voice and video.  ATM uses a [[connection-oriented]] model in which a [[virtual circuit]] must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins.&lt;ref name = &quot;McDysan 1999 287&quot; /&gt;  ATM is a core protocol used over the [[SONET/SDH]] backbone of the [[Integrated Services Digital Network]] (ISDN).

===Why cells?===
Consider a speech signal reduced to packets, and forced to share a link with bursty data traffic (traffic with some large data packets).  No matter how small the speech packets could be made, they would always encounter full-size data packets, and under normal queuing conditions, might experience maximum queuing delays.  That is why all packets, or &quot;cells,&quot; should have the same small size. In addition the fixed cell structure means that ATM can be readily switched by hardware without the inherent delays introduced by software switched and routed frames.

Thus, the designers of ATM utilized small data cells to reduce [[jitter]] (delay variance, in this case) in the multiplexing of data streams. Reduction of jitter (and also end-to-end round-trip delays) is particularly important when carrying voice traffic, because the conversion of digitized voice into an analog audio signal is an inherently [[real time computing|real-time]] process, and to do a good job, the [[codec]] that does this needs an evenly spaced (in time) stream of data items. If the next data item is not available when it is needed, the codec has no choice but to produce silence or guess — and if the data is late, it is useless, because the time period when it should have been converted to a signal has already passed.

At the time of the design of ATM, 155 Mbit/s [[Synchronous Digital Hierarchy|SDH]] (135 Mbit/s payload) was considered a fast optical network link, and many [[Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy|PDH]] links in the digital network were considerably slower, ranging from 1.544 to 45 Mbit/s in the USA, and 2 to 34 Mbit/s in Europe.

At this rate, a typical full-length 1500 byte (12000-bit) data packet would take 77.42 [[microsecond|µs]] to transmit.  In a lower-speed link, such as a 1.544 Mbit/s [[T1 line]], a 1500 byte packet would take up to 7.8 milliseconds.

A [[queuing delay]] induced by several such data packets might exceed the figure of 7.8 ms several times over, in addition to any packet generation delay in the shorter speech packet. This was clearly unacceptable for speech traffic, which needs to have low jitter in the data stream being fed into the codec if it is to produce good-quality sound. A packet voice system can produce this in a number of ways:

* Have a playback buffer between the network and the codec, one large enough to tide the codec over almost all the jitter in the data. This allows smoothing out the jitter, but the delay introduced by passage through the buffer would require [[echo cancellation|echo canceller]]s even in local networks; this was considered too expensive at the time. Also, it would have increased the delay across the channel, and conversation is difficult over high-delay channels.

* Build a system which can inherently provide low jitter (and minimal overall delay) to traffic which needs it.

* Operate on a 1:1 user basis (i.e., a dedicated pipe).

The design of ATM aimed for a low-jitter network interface. However, to be able to provide short queueing delays, but also be able to carry large datagrams, it had to have cells. ATM broke up all packets, data, and voice streams into 48-byte chunks, adding a 5-byte routing header to each one so that they could be reassembled later. The choice of 48 bytes was political rather than technical.&lt;ref&gt;D. Stevenson, &quot;Electropolitical Correctness and High-Speed Networking, or, Why ATM is like a Nose&quot;, [http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0306444860 Proceedings of TriCom '93], April 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[ITU-T|CCITT]] was standardizing ATM, parties from the United States wanted a 64-byte payload because this was felt to be a good compromise in larger payloads optimized for data transmission and shorter payloads optimized for real-time applications like voice; parties from Europe wanted 32-byte payloads because the small size (and therefore short transmission times) simplify voice applications with respect to echo cancellation. Most of the European parties eventually came around to the arguments made by the Americans, but France and a few others held out for a shorter cell length. With 32 bytes, France would have been able to implement an ATM-based voice network with calls from one end of France to the other requiring no echo cancellation. 48 bytes (plus 5 header bytes = 53) was chosen as a compromise between the two sides. 5-byte headers were chosen because it was thought that 10% of the payload was the maximum price to pay for routing information. ATM multiplexed these 53-byte cells instead of packets. Doing so reduced the worst-case jitter due to cell contention by a factor of almost 30, minimizing the need for echo cancellers.

===Cells in practice===
ATM supports different types of services via [[ATM Adaptation Layers]] (AAL). Standardized AALs include AAL1, AAL2, and AAL5, and the rarely used AAL3 and AAL4. AAL1 is used for constant bit rate (CBR) services and circuit emulation. Synchronization is also maintained at AAL1. AAL2 through AAL4 are used for variable bit rate (VBR) services, and AAL5 for data. Which AAL is in use for a given cell is not encoded in the cell. Instead, it is negotiated by or configured at the endpoints on a per-virtual-connection basis.

Following the initial design of ATM, networks have become much faster. A 1500 byte (12000-bit) full-size Ethernet packet takes only 1.2 µs to transmit on a 10 Gbit/s optical network, reducing the need for small cells to reduce jitter due to contention. Some consider that this makes a case for replacing ATM with Ethernet in the network backbone. However, it should be noted that the increased link speeds by themselves do not alleviate jitter due to queuing. Additionally, the hardware for implementing the service adaptation for IP packets is expensive at very high speeds. Specifically, at speeds of [[OC-3]] and above, the cost of segmentation and reassembly (SAR) hardware makes ATM less competitive for IP than [[Packet over SONET/SDH|Packet Over SONET]] (POS){{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}; because of its fixed 48-byte cell payload, ATM is not suitable as a data link layer ''directly'' underlying IP (without the need for SAR at the data link level) since the OSI layer on which IP operates must provide an [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] of at least 576 bytes. SAR performance limits mean that the fastest IP router ATM interfaces are STM16 - STM64 which actually compares, while {{As of|2004|lc=on}} POS can operate at OC-192 (STM64) with higher speeds expected in the future.

On slower or congested links (622Mbit/s and below), ATM does make sense, and for this reason most [[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line|ADSL]] systems use ATM as an intermediate layer between the physical link layer and a Layer 2 protocol like [[Point-to-Point Protocol|PPP]] or Ethernet.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

At these lower speeds, ATM provides a useful ability to carry multiple logical circuits on a single physical or virtual medium, although other techniques exist, such as [[Point-to-Point Protocol#Multiclass PPP|Multi-link PPP]] and [[Ethernet]] [[VLAN]]s, which are optional in [[VDSL]] implementations. DSL can be used as an access method for an ATM network, allowing a DSL termination point in a telephone central office to connect to many internet service providers across a wide-area ATM network. In the United States, at least, this has allowed DSL providers to provide DSL access to the customers of many internet service providers. Since one DSL termination point can support multiple ISPs, the economic feasibility of DSL is substantially improved.

===Why virtual circuits?===
ATM operates as a channel-based transport layer, using [[Virtual circuits]] (VCs). This is encompassed in the concept of the Virtual Paths (VP) and Virtual Channels. Every ATM cell has an 8- or 12-bit [[Virtual Path Identifier|Virtual Path Identifier (VPI)]] and 16-bit [[Virtual channel identifier|Virtual Channel Identifier (VCI)]] pair defined in its header. Together, these identify the virtual circuit used by the connection. The length of the VPI varies according to whether the cell is sent on the user-network interface (on the edge of the network), or if it is sent on the network-network interface (inside the network).

As these cells traverse an ATM network, switching takes place by changing the VPI/VCI values (label swapping). Although the VPI/VCI values are not necessarily consistent from one end of the connection to the other, the concept of a circuit ''is'' consistent (unlike IP, where any given packet could get to its destination by a different route than the others).

Another advantage of the use of virtual circuits comes with the ability to use them as a multiplexing layer, allowing different services (such as voice, [[Frame Relay]], n* 64 channels, IP).

===Using cells and virtual circuits for traffic engineering===
Another key ATM concept involves the [[traffic contract]]. When an ATM circuit is set up each switch on the circuit is informed of the traffic class of the connection.

ATM traffic contracts form part of the mechanism by which &quot;[[Quality of Service]]&quot; (QoS) is ensured. There are four basic types (and several variants) which each have a set of parameters describing the connection.

# CBR - Constant bit rate: a Peak Cell Rate (PCR) is specified, which is constant.
# VBR - Variable bit rate: an average cell rate is specified, which can peak at a certain level for a maximum interval before being problematic.
# ABR - Available bit rate: a minimum guaranteed rate is specified.
# UBR - Unspecified bit rate: traffic is allocated to all remaining transmission capacity.

VBR has real-time and non-real-time variants, and serves for &quot;bursty&quot; traffic. Non-real-time is usually abbreviated to vbr-nrt.

Most traffic classes also introduce the concept of Cell Delay Variation Tolerance (CDVT), which defines the &quot;clumping&quot; of cells in time.

To maintain traffic contracts, networks usually use [[traffic shaping|&quot;shaping&quot;]], a combination of queuing and marking of cells. &quot;[[Traffic policing|Policing]]&quot; generally enforces traffic contracts.

====Traffic shaping====
[[Traffic shaping]] usually takes place at the entry point to an ATM network and attempts to ensure that the cell flow will meet its traffic contract.

====Traffic policing====
To maintain network performance, networks may [[traffic policing|police]] virtual circuits against their traffic contracts. If a circuit is exceeding its traffic contract, the network can either drop the cells or mark the Cell Loss Priority (CLP) bit (to identify a cell as discardable farther down the line). Basic policing works on a cell by cell basis, but this is sub-optimal for encapsulated packet traffic (as discarding a single cell will invalidate the whole packet). As a result, schemes such as Partial Packet Discard (PPD) and Early Packet Discard (EPD) have been created that will discard a whole series of cells until the next frame starts. This reduces the number of useless cells in the network, saving bandwidth for full frames. EPD and PPD work with AAL5 connections as they use the frame end bit to detect the end of packets.

===Types of virtual circuits and paths===
ATM can build virtual circuits and virtual paths either statically or dynamically. Static circuits (permanent virtual circuits or PVCs) or paths (permanent virtual paths or PVPs) require that the provisioner must build the circuit as a series of segments, one for each pair of interfaces through which it passes.

PVPs and PVCs, though conceptually simple, require significant effort in large networks. They also do not support the re-routing of service in the event of a failure. Dynamically built PVPs (soft PVPs or SPVPs) and PVCs (soft PVCs or SPVCs), in contrast, are built by specifying the characteristics of the circuit (the service &quot;contract&quot;) and the two endpoints.

Finally, ATM networks build and tear down switched virtual circuits (SVCs) on demand when requested by an end piece of equipment. One application for SVCs is to carry individual telephone calls when a network of telephone switches are inter-connected by ATM. SVCs were also used in attempts to replace local area networks with ATM.

===Virtual circuit routing===
Most ATM networks supporting SPVPs, SPVCs, and SVCs use the Private Network Node Interface or [[Private Network-to-Network Interface]] (PNNI) protocol.
PNNI uses the same shortest-path-first algorithm used by [[Open Shortest Path First|OSPF]] and [[IS-IS]] to route IP packets to share topology information between switches and select a route through a network. PNNI also includes a very powerful summarization mechanism to allow construction of very large networks, as well as a [[admission control|call admission control]] (CAC) algorithm that determines whether sufficient bandwidth is available on a proposed route through a network to satisfy the service requirements of a VC or VP.

===Call admission and connection establishment===
A network must establish a connection before two parties can send cells to each other. In ATM this is called a [[virtual circuit]] (VC). It can be a permanent virtual circuit (PVC), which is created administratively on the endpoints, or a switched virtual circuit (SVC), which is created as needed by the communicating parties. SVC creation is managed by [[signalling (telecommunications)|signaling]], in which the requesting party indicates the address of the receiving party, the type of service requested, and whatever traffic parameters may be applicable to the selected service. &quot;Call admission&quot; is then performed by the network to confirm that the requested resources are available and that a route exists for the connection.

==Structure of an ATM cell==
An ATM cell consists of a 5-byte header and a 48-byte payload. The payload size of 48 bytes was chosen as described above (&quot;[[Asynchronous Transfer Mode#Why cells|Why cell?]]&quot;).

ATM defines two different cell formats: [[NNI]] (Network-Network Interface) and [[User–network interface|UNI]] (User-Network Interface). Most ATM links use UNI cell format.

: GFC = [[Generic Flow Control]] (4 bits) (default: 4-zero bits)
: VPI = [[Virtual Path Identifier]] (8 bits UNI) or (12 bits NNI)
: VCI = [[Virtual channel identifier]] (16 bits)
: PT = [[Payload Type]] (3 bits)

: HEC = [[Header Error Control]] (8-bit CRC, polynomial = X&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; + X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + X + 1)

ATM uses the PT field to designate various special kinds of cells for [[OA&amp;M|operations, administration, and maintenance]] (OAM) purposes, and to delineate packet boundaries in some AALs.

Several of ATM's link protocols use the HEC field to drive a [[CRC-based framing|CRC-Based Framing]] algorithm, which allows locating the ATM cells with no overhead required beyond what is otherwise needed for header protection. The 8-bit CRC is used to correct single-bit header errors and detect multi-bit header errors. When multi-bit header errors are detected, the current and subsequent cells are dropped until a cell with no header errors is found.

A UNI cell reserves the GFC field for a local [[flow control]]/submultiplexing system between users. This was intended to allow several terminals to share a single network connection, in the same way that two [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] phones can share a single basic rate ISDN connection. All four GFC bits must be zero by default.

The NNI cell format replicates the UNI format almost exactly, except that the 4-bit GFC field is re-allocated to the VPI field, extending the VPI to 12 bits. Thus, a single NNI ATM interconnection is capable of addressing almost 2&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; VPs of up to almost 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; VCs each
(in practice some of the VP and VC numbers are reserved).

The '''anus''' is an opening at the opposite end of an [[animal]]'s [[digestive tract]] from the [[mouth]]. Its function is to control the expulsion of [[feces]],  unwanted semi-solid matter produced during digestion, which, depending on the type of animal, may be one or more of: matter which the animal cannot digest, such as [[coprolite|bones]];&lt;ref name=&quot;ChinEtal1998KingSizeCoprolite&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; food material after all the nutrients have been extracted, for example [[cellulose]] or [[lignin]]; ingested matter which would be toxic if it remained in the digestive tract; and dead or excess [[gut bacteria]] and other [[endosymbiont]]s.

[[Amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, and [[bird]]s use the same orifice for excreting liquid and solid wastes, and for [[copulation]] and [[Egg (biology)|egg]]-laying; this orifice is known as the [[cloaca]]. [[Monotreme]] mammals also have a cloaca, which is thought to be a feature inherited from the earliest [[amniote]]s via the [[therapsid]]s. [[Marsupial]]s have two nether orifices: one for excreting both solids and liquids; the other for reproduction, which appears as a [[vagina]] in females and a [[penis]] in males. Female [[placental]] mammals have completely separate orifices for [[defecation]], [[urination]], and reproduction; males have one opening for defecation and another for both urination and reproduction, although the channels flowing to that orifice are almost completely separate.

The development of the anus was an important stage in the [[evolution]] of [[multicellular]] animals. In fact it appears to have happened at least twice, following different paths in [[protostome]]s and [[deuterostome]]s. This accompanied or facilitated other important evolutionary developments: the [[bilaterian]] [[body plan]]; the [[coelom]], an internal cavity that provided space for a [[circulatory system]] and, in some animals, formed a [[hydrostatic skeleton]] which enables worm-like animals to burrow; [[metamerism]], in which the body was built of repeated &quot;modules&quot; which could later specialize, for example the heads of most [[arthropods]] are composed of fused, specialized segments.

==Development==
{{main|protostome|deuterostome}}
In animals at least as complex as an [[earthworm]], the [[embryo]] forms a dent on one side, the [[blastopore]], which deepens to become the [[archenteron]], the first phase in the growth of the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]]. In [[deuterostome]]s, the original dent becomes the anus while the gut eventually tunnels through to make another opening, which forms the mouth. The  [[protostome]]s were so named because it used to be thought that in their embryos the dent formed the mouth while the anus was formed later, at the opening made by the other end of the gut. More recent research, however, shows that in protostomes the edges of the dent close up in the middle, leaving openings at the ends which become the mouth and anus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Evolution of the bilaterian larval foregut | author=Arendt, D., Technau, U., and Wittbrodt, J. | journal=Nature | volume=409 | pages=81–85 | date=4 January 2001 | doi=10.1038/35051075 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6816/full/409081a0.html | accessdate=2008-07-14 | pmid=11343117 | issue=6816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Acantharea''' are a group of [[radiolaria]]n&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|15144058}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[protozoa]], distinguished mainly by their skeletons.

==Structure==
These are composed of [[strontium sulfate]] crystals, which do not [[fossil]]ize, and take the form of either ten diametric or twenty radial spines.  The central capsule is made up of [[microfibril]]s arranged into twenty  plates, each with a hole through which one spine projects, and there is also a microfibrillar cortex linked to the spines by [[myonemes]].  These assist in flotation, together with the [[vacuole]]s in the ectoplasm, which often contain [[zooxanthella]]e.

==Classification by spine arrangement==
The arrangement of the spines is very precise, and is described by what is called the Müllerian law.  This is easiest to describe in terms of lines of latitude and longitude - the spines lie on the intersections between five of the former, symmetric about an equator, and eight of the latter, spaced uniformly.  Each line of longitude carries either two ''tropical'' spines or one ''equatorial'' and two ''polar'' spines, in alternation.  The way that the spines are joined together at the center of the cell varies and is one of the primary characteristics by which acanthareans are classified.

* [[Holacanthida]] - diametric spines, simply crossed
* [[Symphyacanthida]] - radial spines, with free bases
* [[Chaunacanthida]] - radial spines, with articulated bases
* [[Arthracanthida]] - radial spines, with pyramidal bases packed together

The axopods are fixed in number.

==Life cycle==
Adults are usually multinucleated. Reproduction is thought to take place by formation of swarmer cells (formerly referred to as &quot;spores&quot;), which may be [[flagellate]].  Not all life cycle stages have been observed, and study of these organisms has been hampered mainly by an inability to maintain these organisms in culture through successive generations.

The '''African National Congress''' ('''ANC''') has been [[South Africa]]'s governing [[left-wing]] [[political party]], supported by its tripartite alliance with the [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]] (COSATU) and the [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP), since the establishment of non-racial democracy in April 1994. It defines itself as a &quot;disciplined force of the left&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/conf/conference51/declaration.html|title= ANC Party Declaration|publisher= the African National Congress|accessdate= 15 May 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members founded the organization as the '''South African Native National Congress''' ('''SANNC''') on 8 January 1912 in [[Bloemfontein]] to increase the rights of the [[black people|black]] South African population. [[John Dube]], its first president, and poet and author [[Sol Plaatje]] are among its founding members. The organization became the ANC in 1923 and formed a military wing, the [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (Spear of the Nation) in 1961.

It has been the ruling party of [[History of South Africa (1994–present)|post-apartheid South Africa]] on the national level since 1994. It gained support in the [[South African general election, 1999|1999 elections]], and further increased its majority in [[South African general election, 2004|2004]], with 69.7% of the votes. In [[South African general election, 2009|2009]] its share of the vote reduced slightly, but it remained the dominant party with 65.9% of the votes.

==History==
{{Main|History of the African National Congress}}
{{Ref improve section|date=February 2010}}

The founding of the ANC was in direct response to perceived injustice against black South Africans at the hands of the current government in power. It can be said that the ANC had its origins in a pronouncement by [[Pixley ka Isaka Seme]] who said in 1911 ''Forget all the past differences among Africans and unite in one national organisation.'' The ANC was founded in the subsequent year on 8 January 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?include=docs/misc/2010/umzabalazo.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of the newly formed [[Union of South Africa]] began a systematic oppression of black people in South Africa. The [[Natives' Land Act|Land Act]] was promulgated in 1913. The effect of these laws was to force many non-whites from their farms into the cities and towns to work, and to restrict their movement within South Africa. By 1919, the ANC led a campaign against passes, and in 1929 the ANC supported a militant mineworkers' strike.

The ANC became dormant in the mid-1920s. During that time, black people were also represented by the [[Industrial and Commercial Workers’ Union|ICU]] and the previously white-only Communist party. By 1947, J.T. Gumende (president of the ANC) proposed cooperation with the Communists in a bid to revitalise the organisation, but he was voted out of power in the 1930s. This led to the ANC becoming largely ineffectual and inactive, until the mid-1940s when the ANC was remodelled as a mass movement.

The ANC responded militarily to attacks on the rights of black South Africans, as well as calling for strikes, boycotts, and defiance. This led to a later [[Defiance Campaign]] in the 1950s, a mass movement of resistance to [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]]. The government tried to stop the ANC by banning party leaders and enacting new laws to stop the ANC, however these measures ultimately proved to be ineffective.

In 1955, the [[Congress of the People (1955)|Congress of the People]] officially adopted the [[Freedom Charter]], stating the core principles of the South African Congress Alliance, which consisted of the African National Congress and its allies the [[South African Indian Congress]], the South African Congress of Democrats and the Coloured People's Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;pil-lut&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pillay|first=Gerald J.|title=Voices of Liberation: Albert Lutuli|year=1993|publisher=HSRC Press|isbn=0796913560|pages=82–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government claimed that this was a communist document, and consequently leaders of the ANC and Congress were arrested. 1960 saw the [[Sharpeville Massacre]], in which 69 people were killed when police opened fire on anti-apartheid protesters.

Whites eventually joined the fight against apartheid, leading many [[Black nationalism|black supremacists]] to break away from the ANC.

===Umkhonto we Sizwe===
[[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (or MK), translated &quot;Spear of the Nation&quot;, was the military wing of the ANC. Partly in response to the [[Sharpeville Massacre]] of 1960, individual members of the ANC found it necessary to consider violence to combat what passive protest had failed to quell. There was a significant portion of the ANC who therefore turned to violence in order to achieve their goals. A significant portion of ANC leadership agreed that this violence was needed to combat increasing backlash from the government. 
Some ANC members were upset by the actions of the MK, and refused to accept violence as necessary for the ending of Apartheid, but these individuals became a minority as the militant leaders such as Nelson Mandela gained significant popularity. Many consider their actions to be criminal, but the MK deemed the means justified by the end goal of ending apartheid. Some members of MK committed terrorist acts to achieve their aims, and MK was responsible for the deaths of both civilians and members of the military. 
In cooperation with the [[South African Communist Party]], MK was founded in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/organisations/MK/formation.htm SAhistory.org.za]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
The ANC deems itself as a force of national liberation in the post-apartheid era; it officially defines its umbrella agenda as the ''National Democratic Revolution''. The ANC is a member of the [[Socialist International]].&lt;ref name=socialistinternational/&gt; It also sets forth the redressing of socio-economic differences stemming from colonial- and apartheid-era policies as a central focus of ANC policy.

The National Democratic Revolution (NDR) is described as a process through which the National Democratic Society (NDS) is achieved; a society in which people are intellectually, socially, economically and politically empowered. The drivers of the NDR are also called the motive forces and are defined as the elements within society that gain from the success of the NDR. Using contour plots or [[concentric circles]] the centre represents the elements in society that gain the most out of the success of the NDR. Moving away from the centre results in the reduction of the gains that those elements derive. It is generally believed that the force that occupies the centre of those concentric circles in countries with low unemployment is the working class while in countries with higher levels of unemployment it is the unemployed. Some of the many theoreticians that have written about the NDR include [[Joe Slovo]], [[Joel Netshitenzhe]] and [[Tshilidzi Marwala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Joe|last=Slovo|url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/africa/slovo/1988/national-democratic-revolution.htm |title=The South African Working Class and the National Democratic Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Joel|last=Netshitenzhe|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/pubs/umrabulo/umrabulo25/tasks.html|title=Understanding the tasks of the moment|work=Umrabulo|volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marwala|first=T|url=http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?doc=ancdocs/pubs/umrabulo/umrabulo29/art12.html/|title=The anatomy of capital and the national democratic revolution|work=Umrabulo|volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tripartite Alliance===
The ANC holds a historic alliance with the [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP) and [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]] (COSATU), known as the ''Tripartite Alliance''. The SACP and COSATU have not contested any election in South Africa, but field candidates through the ANC, hold senior positions in the ANC, and influence party policy and dialogue. During Mbeki's presidency, the government took a more pro-capitalist stance, often running counter to the demands of the SACP and COSATU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ever-fasternews.com/index.php?php_action=read_article&amp;article_id=397|title=ANC 'At Fork in the Road'|first=Paul Trewhela|date=05/08/2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.disa.ukzn.ac.za/index.php?option=com_displaytei&amp;id=21131&amp;title=How%20the%20tripartite%20alliance%20works&amp;creator=|title=How the Tripartite Alliance works|work=Mayibuye|volume=2|year =1991|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=COSATU and the Tripartite Alliance since 1994|first=Dale|last=McKinley|work=Rethinking the Labour Movement in the 'New' South Africa (T.

===2008 schism===
Following Zuma's accession to the ANC leadership in 2007 and Mbeki's resignation as president in 2008, the Mbeki faction of former ministers led by [[Mosiuoa Lekota]] split away from the ANC to form the [[Congress of the People (South African political party)|Congress of the People]].

==ANC flag==
[[File:African National Congress Flag.svg|100px|right|thumb|Flag of the African National Congress]]
The ANC flag is composed of three stripes – black, green and gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/misc/ancflag.html|title=The Flag of the African National Congress|publisher=African National Congress|accessdate=2009-01-21}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black symbolizes the native people of South Africa, green represents the land and gold represents the mineral and other natural wealth of South Africa. This flag was also the [[War flag|battle flag]] of the [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]]. The official party flag also has the emblem of the party incorporated onto the flag.

==Party list==
Politicians in the party win a place in parliament by being on the ''Party List'', which is drawn up before the elections and enumerates, in order, the party's preferred MPs. The number of seats allocated is proportional to the popular national vote, and this determines the cut-off point.

The ANC has also gained members through the controversial [[floor crossing (South Africa)|floor crossing]] process.

Although most South African parties announced their candidate list for provincial premierships in the 2009 election, the ANC did not. It is not required for parties to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71619?oid=120071&amp;sn=Detail Politicsweb.co.za]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of the ANC in resolving the conflict==
The ANC represented the main opposition to the government during apartheid and therefore they played a major role in resolving the conflict through participating in the peacemaking and peace-building processes. Initially intelligence agents of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] met in secret with ANC leaders, including Nelson Mandela, to judge whether conflict resolution was possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://student.britannica.com/comptons/article-226016/apartheid Student.britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions and negotiations took place leading to the eventual unbanning of the ANC and other opposing political parties by then President [[Frederik Willem de Klerk|de Klerk]] on 2 February 1990. These initial meetings were the first crucial steps towards resolution.

The next official step towards rebuilding South Africa was the Groote Schuur Minute where the government and the ANC agreed on a common commitment towards the resolution of the existing climate of violence and intimidation, as well as a commitment to stability and to a peaceful process of negotiations. The ANC negotiated the release of political prisoners and the indemnity from prosecution for returning exiles and moreover channels of communication were established between the Government and the ANC.

Later the Pretoria Minute represented another step towards resolution where agreements at Groote Schuur were reconsolidated and steps towards setting up an interim government and drafting a new constitution were established as well as suspension of the military wing of the ANC – the Umkhonto we Sizwe. This step helped end much of the violence within South Africa. Another agreement that came out of the Pretoria Minute was that both parties would try and raise awareness that a new way of governance was being created for South Africa, and that further violence would only hinder this process. However violence still continued in Kwazulu-Natal, which violated the trust between Mandela and de Klerk. Moreover, internal disputes in the ANC prolonged the war as consensus on peace was not reached.&lt;ref name=concise&gt;{{cite book|title=A concise history of South Africa|first=Robert|last=Ross|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next significant steps towards resolution were the Repeal of the Population Registration Act,  the repeal of the Group Areas and the Native Land Acts and a catch-all Abolishment of Racially Based Measures Act was passed.&lt;ref name=concise/&gt; These measures ensured no one could claim, or be deprived of any rights on the basis of race.

In December 1991 the Convention for a Democratic South Africa ([[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|CODESA]]) was held with the aim of establishing an interim government. However a few months later in June 1992 the Boipatong massacre occurred and all negotiations crumbled as the ANC pulled out. After this negotiations proceeded between two agents, [[Cyril Ramaphosa]] of the ANC, and [[Roelf Meyer]] of the National Party. In over 40 meetings the two men discussed and negotiated over many issues including the nature of the future political system, the fate of over 40,000 government employees and if/how the country would be divided. The result of these negotiations was an interim constitution that meant the transition from apartheid to democracy was a constitutional continuation and that the rule of law and state sovereignty remained intact during the transition, which was vital for stability within the country. A date was set for the first democratic elections on 27 April 1994.&lt;ref name=concise/&gt; The ANC won 62.5% of the votes and has been in power ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanhistory.about.com/od/apartheidfaq/f/HowEnded.htm Africanhistory.about.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===Controversy over corrupt members===
{{Main|South African Arms Deal}}The most prominent corruption case involving the ANC relates to a series of bribes paid to companies involved in the ongoing R55 billion [[South African Arms Deal|Arms Deal saga]], which resulted in a long term jail sentence to former Deputy President [[Jacob Zuma]]'s legal adviser [[Schabir Shaik]]. Zuma, now the State president, currently faces 7 813 charges relating to alleged fraud, bribery and corruption in the Arms Deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pretorianews.co.za/?fSectionId=&amp;fArticleId=vn20081009055615571C284334 |date=9 October 2008 |title=Opposition hails challenge to ANC rule}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ANC has also been criticised for its subsequent abolishment of the [[Scorpions (South Africa)|Scorpions]], the multidisciplinary agency that investigated and prosecuted organised crime and corruption, and was heavily involved in the investigation into Zuma and Shaik.

Other recent corruption issues include the sexual misconduct and criminal charges of [[Beaufort West Municipality, Western Cape|Beaufort West]] municipal manager [[Truman Prince]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_1700232,00.html|title=Action against Prince 'a farce' |date=5 May 2005 |first=Ronel |last=Bester |publisher=[[Die Burger]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Oilgate]] scandal, in which millions of Rand in funds from a state-owned company were allegedly funneled into ANC coffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Special Report: Oilgate |url=http://www.mg.co.za/specialreport.aspx?area=oilgate |work=Mail &amp; Guardian |accessdate=2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Links between factions in the ANC, specifically the ANC Youth League leadership, and businessman [[Brett Kebble]] gained media attention following Kebble's murder in September 2005.

In December 2007 the ANC elected their new [[National Executive Committee (African National Congress)|National Executive Committee]] (NEC), the highest structure in the party. Out of the 80 member committee, 9% are (post-apartheid) convicted criminals. Most of these members have been convicted of fraud, while one member, [[Winnie Madikizela-Mandela]], was convicted of the kidnapping of a 14-year-old boy, James Seipei (1974–1988), also known as Stompie Moeketsi (who was also murdered). According to an article in the ''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]'', &quot;by adding those who have been disciplined or moved, and those with dark clouds of unanswered questions hanging over their heads, the figure shifts to 29%.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=329910&amp;area=/insight/insight__national/ |title= ANC rogues' gallery |work=Mail &amp; Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ANC has also been accused of using government and civil society to fight its political battles against opposition parties such as the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]]. The result has been a number of complaints and allegations that none of the political parties truly represent the interests of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=

===Controversy over wasteful expenditure===
The ANC has reportedly wasted over R1 billion of taxpayers' money over the past eight months on luxury vehicles, expensive hotels, banquets, advertising and other &quot;wasteful expenditure&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/R1bn-blinged-partied-away-20100409| title=R1bn blinged, partied away| publisher=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=6&amp;art_id=nw20100408222343563C315491| title=Taxpayers deserve answers on bling - DA| publisher= Independent Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=553&amp;fArticleId=5422285| title=Business Watch: Airlines must be cursing Blatter and the World Cup| publisher=Business Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main thrust behind this reporting is the official opposition in the country, the Democratic Alliance (DA). They have kept a tally of the expenditure called 'The Wasteful Expenditure Monitor'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.da.org.za/campaigns.htm?action=view-page&amp;category=7034| title=Introduction: the Wasteful Expenditure Monitor| publisher=Democratic Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the DA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.da.org.za/campaigns.htm?action=view-page&amp;category=7034&amp;sub-page=7036| title=Wasteful expenditure monitor: Total up to R1 003 016 305.44| publisher=Democratic Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; this waste could have:

*Built 18 574 new RDP houses
*Fund 7775 teachers for a year

'''Amphetamine''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) or '''amfetamine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is a [[psychostimulant]] [[drug]] of the [[phenethylamine]] class which produces increased [[wakefulness]] and [[Attention|focus]] in association with decreased [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and [[appetite]].

Brand names of medications that contain, or metabolize into, amphetamine include [[Adderall]], [[Dexedrine]], [[Dextrostat]], [[methamphetamine|Desoxyn]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.craigmedical.com/drug_test_faq.htm Drug Test FAQ | Craig Medical Distribution, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[dextroamphetamine|ProCentra]], and [[Vyvanse]], as well as [[Benzedrine]] in the past.

The drug is also used [[Recreational drug use|recreationally]] and as a [[performance enhancer]]. Recreational users of amphetamine have coined numerous street names for amphetamine, such as &quot;speed&quot;. The [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] reports the typical retail price of diluted amphetamine in [[Europe]] varied between €3 and €15 ($4 to $21.55 [[United States Dollar|USD]]) a gram in half of the reporting countries. Street amphetamine is typically about 10% pure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction |title=Annual report: the state of the drugs problem in Europe |year=2008 |publisher=Office for Official Publications of the European Communities |location=Luxembourg |isbn=978-92-9168-324-6 |page=48 |url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_64227_EN_EMCDDA_AR08_en.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''amphetamine'' is derived from its chemical name '''a'''lpha-[[methyl group|'''m'''ethyl]] [[phenethylamine|'''ph'''en'''et'''hyl'''amine''']].

Psychological effects can include [[euphoria]], [[anxiety]], increased [[libido]], [[alertness]], [[concentration]], [[energy]], [[self-esteem]], [[self-confidence]], [[sociability]], [[irritability]], [[aggression]], [[psychosomatic disorders]], [[psychomotor agitation]], [[grandiosity]], excessive feelings of [[Power (philosophy)|power]] and [[wikt:superior|superiority]], repetitive and [[Fixation (psychology)|obsessive]] behaviors, [[paranoia]], and with chronic and/or high doses, [[amphetamine psychosis]] can occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erowid Amphetamines Vault: Effects&quot;&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/amphetamines/amphetamines_effects.shtml Erowid Amphetamines Vault: Effects&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec15/ch198/ch198k.html Amphetamines | Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Withdrawal effects===
Withdrawal symptoms of amphetamine primarily consist of mental [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], mental [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and increased [[appetite]]. Symptoms may last for days with occasional use and weeks or months with chronic use, with severity dependent on the length of time and the amount of amphetamine used. Withdrawal symptoms may also include [[anxiety]], [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], excessive [[sleep]], [[dreams|vivid or lucid dreams]], deep [[REM sleep]] and [[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/a/amphetamine_withdrawal/symptoms.htm#symptom_list Symptoms of Amphetamine withdrawal | WrongDiagnosis.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sleep.emedtv.com/dextroamphetamine/dextroamphetamine-withdrawals.html eMedTV | Dextroamphetamine Withdrawals]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugabusehelp.com/drugs/dexedrine/ Drug Abuse Help | Dexedrine Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side effects==
===Contraindications===
Amphetamine elevates cardiac output and blood pressure making it dangerous for use by patients with a history of [[heart disease]] or [[hypertension]]. Amphetamine can cause a life-threatening complication in patients taking [[MAOI]] antidepressants. The use of amphetamine and amphetamine-like drugs is contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle [[glaucoma]] or anatomically narrow angles. Like other [[sympathomimetic]] amines, amphetamine can induce transient [[mydriasis]]. In patients with narrow angles, pupillary dilation can provoke an acute attack of angle-closure glaucoma. These agents should also be avoided in patients with other forms of glaucoma, as mydriasis may occasionally increase intraocular pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugs.com/disease-interactions/amphetamine.html ''Amphetamine Disease Interactions - Drugs.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Amphetamine has been shown to pass through into breast milk. Because of this, mothers taking amphetamine are advised to avoid breastfeeding during their course of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2004/021303s005lbl.pdf |title=ADDERALL XR capsule |accessdate=2009-07-24 |first=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] |year=2005 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dependence and addiction===
{{Main|Amphetamine dependence}}
[[Drug tolerance|Tolerance]] is developed rapidly in amphetamine abuse; therefore, periods of extended use require increasing amounts of the drug in order to achieve the same effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Overdose===
An amphetamine overdose is rarely fatal but can lead to a number of different symptoms, including [[psychosis]], [[chest pain]], and [[hypertension]].

===Psychosis===
{{Main|Stimulant psychosis}}
Abuse of amphetamines can result in a stimulant psychosis that can present as a number of psychotic disorders (i.e. [[paranoia]], [[hallucination]]s, [[delusion]]s). The intensity and duration of symptoms may vary, but unlike true psychotic disorders (i.e. [[schizophrenia]]), stimulant psychoses are not considered to be permanent and will eventually resolve upon discontinuation of the drug's use.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Mechanism of action==
===Primary sites of action===
[[Image:Amphetamine2.png|thumb|Ball-and-stick model of amphetamine]]
Amphetamine exerts its behavioral effects by modulating several key neurotransmitters in the brain, including [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]], and [[norepinephrine]]. However, the activity of amphetamine throughout the brain appears to be specific;&lt;ref name=&quot;JonesKornblum&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jones S, Kornblum JL, Kauer JA |title=Amphetamine blocks long-term synaptic depression in the ventral tegmental area |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=20 |issue=15 |pages=5575–80 |year=2000 |month=August |pmid=10908593 |doi= |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10908593}}&lt;/ref&gt; certain receptors that respond to amphetamine in some regions of the brain tend not to do so in other regions. For instance, [[dopamine]] [[Dopamine receptor|D2 receptors]] in the [[hippocampus]], a region of the brain associated with forming new memories, appear to be unaffected by the presence of amphetamine.&lt;ref name=&quot;JonesKornblum&quot; /&gt;

The major neural systems affected by amphetamine are largely implicated in the brain’s reward circuitry. Moreover, neurotransmitters involved in various reward pathways of the brain appear to be the primary targets of amphetamine.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17437&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moore KE |title=The actions of amphetamine on neurotransmitters: a brief review |journal=Biol. Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=451–62 |year=1977 |month=June |pmid=17437 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such neurotransmitter is [[dopamine]], a chemical messenger heavily active in the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] and [[Mesocortical pathway|mesocortical]] reward pathways. Not surprisingly, the anatomical components of these pathways—including the [[striatum]], the [[nucleus accumbens]], and the [[ventral striatum]]—have been found to be primary sites of amphetamine action.&lt;ref name=&quot;DelArco&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Del Arco A, González-Mora JL, Armas VR, Mora F |title=Amphetamine increases the extracellular concentration of glutamate in striatum of the awake rat: involvement of high affinity transporter mechanisms |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=38 |issue=7 |pages=943–54 |year=1999 |month=July |pmid=10428413 |doi=10.1016/S0028-3908(99)00043-X |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Drevets&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Drevets WC, Gautier C, Price JC |title=Amphetamine-induced dopamine release in human ventral striatum correlates with euphoria |journal=Biol.

The fact that amphetamine influences neurotransmitter activity specifically in regions implicated in reward provides insight into the behavioral consequences of the drug, such as the stereotyped onset of [[euphoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Drevets&quot; /&gt; A better understanding of the specific mechanisms by which amphetamine operates may increase our ability to treat amphetamine [[Substance use disorder|addiction]], as the brain’s reward circuitry has been widely implicated in addictions of many types.&lt;ref&gt;Wise, RA. “Brain reward circuitry and addiction.” Program and abstracts of the American Society of Addiction Medicine 2003 The State of the Art in Addiction Medicine; October 30-November 1, 2003; Washington, DC. Session&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endogenous amphetamines===
Amphetamine has been found to have several endogenous analogues; that is, molecules of a similar structure found naturally in the brain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sulzer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sulzer D, Chen TK, Lau YY, Kristensen H, Rayport S, Ewing A |title=Amphetamine redistributes dopamine from synaptic vesicles to the cytosol and promotes reverse transport |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=15 |issue=5 Pt 2 |pages=4102–8 |year=1995 |month=May |pmid=7751968 |doi= |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7751968}}&lt;/ref&gt; l-[[Phenylalanine]] and β-[[Phenethylamine]] are two examples, which are formed in the peripheral nervous system as well as in the brain itself. These molecules are thought to modulate levels of excitement and alertness, among other related affective states.

===Dopamine===
The most widely studied neurotransmitter with regard to amphetamine action in the central nervous system is [[dopamine]]. All of the addictive drugs appear to enhance dopamine neurotransmission, including amphetamine and methamphetamine.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21338876&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|21338876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that in select regions, amphetamine increases the concentrations of [[dopamine]] in the [[synaptic cleft]], thereby heightening the response of the post-synaptic neuron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuczenski&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kuczenski R, Segal DS |title=Effects of methylphenidate on extracellular dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine: comparison with amphetamine |journal=J. Neurochem. |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=2032–7 |year=1997 |month=May |pmid=9109529 |doi=10.1046/j.1471-4159.1997.68052032.x |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This specific action hints at the hedonic response to the drug as well as to the drug’s addictive quality.

The specific mechanisms by which amphetamine affects dopamine concentrations have been studied extensively. Currently, two major hypotheses have been proposed, which are not mutually exclusive. One theory emphasizes amphetamine’s actions on the [[Synaptic vesicle|vesicular]] level, increasing concentrations of [[dopamine]] in the [[cytosol]] of the pre-synaptic neuron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sulzer&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17105921&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rothman RB, Baumann MH |title=Balance between dopamine and serotonin release modulates behavioral effects of amphetamine-type drugs |journal=Ann.

The former hypothesis is backed by studies from [[David Sulzer]]'s lab at [[Columbia University]] demonstrating that injections of amphetamine result in rapid increases of cytosolic dopamine concentrations, while the drug decreases the number of dopamine molecules inside the [[synaptic vesicle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite pmid|7751968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite pmid|19409267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amphetamine is a substrate for a specific neuronal synaptic vesicle uptake transporter called [[vesicle monoamine transporter 2|VMAT2]]. When amphetamine is taken up by [[vesicle monoamine transporter 2|VMAT2]], the vesicle releases dopamine molecules into the cytosol in exchange. The redistributed [[dopamine]] is then believed to interact with [[dopamine transporter|DAT]] to promote reverse transport.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sulzer&quot; /&gt; Amphetamine and amphetamine derivatives are also weak bases that accept protons, and can collapse acidic pH gradients in the vesicles that would otherwise provide free energy for neurotransmitter accumulation: the &quot;weak base hypothesis&quot; of amphetamine action suggests that collapse of this free energy contributes to redistribution of dopamine from very high (molar) concentrations in the vesicles to the cytosol.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21338876&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite pmid|2268433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium may be a key molecule involved in the interactions between amphetamine and VMATs.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17105921&quot;/&gt;

The increase of cytosolic dopamine appears to trigger neurotoxicity, as dopamine readily auto-oxidizes, so that amphetamine or methamphetamine's increase in cytosolic dopamine can lead to oxidative stress in the cytosol that in turn promotes [[autophagy]]-related degradation of dopamine axons and dendrites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite pmid|12388602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second hypothesis of amphetamine action on the plasma membrane dopamine transporter postulates a direct interaction between amphetamine and the [[dopamine transporter|DAT]]. The activity of [[dopamine transporter|DAT]] is believed to depend on specific phosphorylating kinases, such as [[protein kinase c]], specifically [[PRKCB1|PKC-β]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Overload&quot; /&gt; Upon phosphorylation, [[dopamine transporter|DAT]] undergoes a conformational change that results in the transportation of DAT-bound [[dopamine]] from the extracellular to the intracellular environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kahlig&quot;/&gt; In the presence of amphetamine, however, [[dopamine transporter|DAT]] has been observed to function in reverse, spitting dopamine out of the presynaptic neuron and into the [[synaptic cleft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Regulation&quot; /&gt; Thus, beyond inhibiting reuptake of [[dopamine]], amphetamine also stimulates the release of [[dopamine]] molecules into the synapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17437&quot;/&gt;

In support of the above hypothesis, it has been found that [[PRKCB1|PKC-β]] inhibitors eliminate the effects of amphetamine on extracellular [[dopamine]] concentrations in the striatum of rats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Overload&quot; /&gt; This data suggests that the [[PRKCB1|PKC-β]] kinase may represent a key point of interaction between amphetamine and the [[dopamine transporter|DAT]] transporter.

Additional actions of amphetamine contribute to it's ability to release dopamine from neurons, including action as an inhibitor of [[monoamine oxidase]], an enzyme responsible for dopamine breakdown in the cytosol; an ability to enhance dopamine synthesis apparently via actions on the enzyme [[tyrosine hydroxylase]], which synthesizes the dopamine precursor [[L-DOPA]]; and some blockade of the DAT, an action that amphetamine shares with [[cocaine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite pmid|15955613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the combination of these actions, amphetamine can release far more dopamine that can cocaine or other addictive drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21338876&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite pmid|11487614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serotonin===
Amphetamine has been found to exert similar effects on [[serotonin]] as on [[dopamine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JonesKauer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jones S, Kauer JA |title=Amphetamine depresses excitatory synaptic transmission via serotonin receptors in the ventral tegmental area |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=19 |issue=22 |pages=9780–7 |year=1999 |month=November |pmid=10559387 |doi= |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10559387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[dopamine transporter|DAT]], the serotonin transporter [[serotonin transporter|SERT]] can be induced to operate in reverse upon stimulation by amphetamine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hilber&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hilber B, Scholze P, Dorostkar MM |title=Serotonin-transporter mediated efflux: a pharmacological analysis of amphetamines and non-amphetamines |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=811–9 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16185723 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2005.08.008 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mechanism is thought to rely on the actions of calcium ions, as well as on the proximity of certain transporter proteins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hilber&quot; /&gt;

The interaction between amphetamine and [[serotonin]] is only apparent in particular regions of the brain, such as the [[mesocortical pathway|mesocorticolimbic projection]]. Recent studies additionally postulate that amphetamine may indirectly alter the behavior of [[glutamatergic system|glutamatergic]] pathways extending from the [[ventral tegmental area]] to the [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JonesKauer&quot; /&gt; [[glutamatergic system|Glutamatergic]] pathways are strongly correlated with increased excitability at the level of the synapse. Increased extracellular concentrations of [[serotonin]] may thus modulate the excitatory activity of glutamatergic neurons.&lt;ref name=&quot;JonesKauer&quot; /&gt;

The proposed ability of amphetamine to increase excitability of [[glutamatergic system|glutamatergic]] pathways may be of significance when considering serotonin-mediated addiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;JonesKauer&quot; /&gt; An additional behavioral consequence may be the stereotyped locomotor stimulation that occurs in response to amphetamine exposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuczenski&quot; /&gt;

===Other relevant neurotransmitters===
Several other neurotransmitters have been linked to amphetamine activity. For instance, extracellular levels of [[glutamate]], the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, have been shown to increase upon exposure to amphetamine. Consistent with other findings, this effect was found in the areas of the brain implicated in reward; namely, the [[nucleus accumbens]], [[striatum]], and [[prefrontal cortex]]. Additionally, several studies demonstrate increased levels of [[norepinephrine]], a neurotransmitter related to [[adrenaline]], in response to amphetamine. This is believed to occur via reuptake blockage as well as via interactions with the norepinephrine neuronal transport carrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Florin SM, Kuczenski R, Segal DS |title=Regional extracellular norepinephrine responses to amphetamine and cocaine and effects of clonidine pretreatment |journal=Brain Res. |volume=654 |issue=1 |pages=53–62 |year=1994 |month=August |pmid=7982098 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(94)91570-9 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long-term effects of amphetamines use on [[neural development]] in children has not been well established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rxlist.com/adderall-drug.htm RxList | Adderall]&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a study in rats, amphetamine use during adolescence may impair adult [[working memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.illinois.edu/news/09/1021amphetamine.html|title=Amphetamine use in adolescence may impair adult working memory|accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology==
===Chemical properties===
[[File:Amphetamine-2D-skeletal.svg|thumb|200px200px|Amphetamine molecular structure. [[Methamphetamine]] has the same structure, with the addition of a [[methyl group]] attached to the nitrogen.]]
[[Image:Methamphetamines.PNG|thumb|A chart A comparing the chemical structures of different [[Template:Amphetamines|amphetamine derivatives]]]]
Amphetamine is a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] compound. The [[racemic]] mixture can be divided into its optical isomers: levo- and [[dextroamphetamine|dextro-amphetamine]]. Amphetamine is the parent compound of its own structural class, comprising a broad range of psychoactive [[derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]], from [[empathogens]], [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA (3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine)]] and [[MDMA|MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine)]] known as ecstasy, to the ''N''-methylated form, [[methamphetamine]] known as 'meth', and to decongestants such as [[Ephedrine|ephedrine (EPH)]] . Amphetamine is a [[homologous series|homologue]] of [[phenethylamine]].

At first, the medical drug came as the salt racemic-amphetamine sulfate (racemic-amphetamine contains both isomers in equal amounts). Attention disorders are often treated using [[Adderall]] or a generic equivalent, a formulation of mixed amphetamine and dextroamphetamine salts that contain
* 1/4 dextro-amphetamine saccharate
* 1/4 dextro-amphetamine sulfate
* 1/4 (racemic amphetamine) aspartate monohydrate
* 1/4 (racemic amphetamine) sulfate

===Pharmacodynamics===
Amphetamine has been shown to both diffuse through the cell membrane and travel via the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT) to increase concentrations of [[dopamine]] in the neuronal terminal.

Amphetamine, both as d-amphetamine ([[dextroamphetamine]]) and l-amphetamine (or a racemic mixture of the two isomers), is believed to exert its effects by binding to the monoamine transporters and increasing extracellular levels of the biogenic amines [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline) and [[serotonin]]. It is hypothesized that d-amphetamine acts primarily on the dopaminergic systems, while l-amphetamine is comparatively norepinephrinergic (noradrenergic). The primary reinforcing and behavioral-stimulant effects of amphetamine, however, are linked to enhanced dopaminergic activity, primarily in the mesolimbic [[dopamine system]].

Amphetamine and other amphetamine-type stimulants principally act to release dopamine into the [[synaptic cleft]]. Amphetamine, unlike dopamine transporter inhibitor cocaine, acts as a substrate for DAT and slows reuptake by a secondary acting mechanism through the phosphorylation of dopamine transporters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:BaDklpuwbTQJ:wiki.answers.com/Q/Does_Namenda_memantine_work_in_preventing_tolerance_to_adderall_ADD_amphetamine_type_drugs&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=10&amp;gl=us WikiAnswers google cached page: 'Does Namenda memantine work in preventing tolerance to adderall ADD amphetamine type drugs?']&lt;/ref&gt; A primary action of amphetamine is mediated by [[vesicular monoamine transporters]] (VMATs); the transporters appear to provide a channel through which dopamine and other transmitters can exit the vesicle to the cytosol. According to the &quot;weak base hypothesis&quot; this is exacerbated by amphetamine acting to alkalinize the vesicle, which depletes the free energy favoring vesicle accummlation so that transmitter is redistributed to the cytosol. Together, these actions cause the release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin from monoamine vesicles, thereby increasing cytosolic concentrations of transmitter. This increase in concentration assists in the &quot;reverse transport&quot; of dopamine via the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT) into the synapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;review&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sulzer D, Sonders MS, Poulsen NW, Galli A |title=Mechanisms of neurotransmitter release by amphetamines: a review |journal=Prog. Neurobiol. |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=406–33 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15955613 |doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2005.04.003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, amphetamine binds reversibly to the DATs and blocks the transporter's ability to clear DA from the synaptic space. Amphetamine also acts in this way with norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and to a lesser extent serotonin.

In addition, amphetamine binds to a group of receptors called Trace Amine Associated Receptors ([[TAAR]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reese EA, Bunzow JR, Arttamangkul S, Sonders MS, Grandy DK |title=Trace amine-associated receptor 1 displays species-dependent stereoselectivity for isomers of methamphetamine, amphetamine, and para-hydroxyamphetamine |journal=J Pharmacol Exp Ther. |volume=321 |issue=1 |pages=178–86 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17218486 |doi=10.1124/jpet.106.115402 |url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/321/1/178}}&lt;/ref&gt; TAAR are a newly discovered receptor system which seems to be affected by a range of amphetamine-like substances called [[trace amines]].

==History==
Amphetamine was first synthesized in 1887 by the [[Romania]]n chemist [[Lazăr Edeleanu]] in [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Edeleano L | title = Ueber einige Derivate der Phenylmethacrylsäure und der Phenylisobuttersäure | journal = Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft | volume = 20 | issue=1 | pages = 616–622 | year = 1887 | doi = 10.1002/cber.188702001142 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; He named the compound phenylisopropylamine.

From 1933 or 1934 [[Smith, Kline and French]] began selling the volatile base form of the drug as an [[inhaler]] under the [[trade name]] [[Benzedrine]], useful as a decongestant but readily usable for other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rasmussen N |title=Making the first anti-depressant: amphetamine in American medicine, 1929–1950 |journal=J Hist Med Allied Sci |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=288–323 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16492800 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/jrj039 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first attempts at using amphetamine as a scientific study was done by M. H. Nathanson, a Los Angeles physician, in 1935. He studied the subjective effects of amphetamine in 55 hospital workers who were each given 20&amp;nbsp;mg of Benzedrine. The two most commonly reported drug effects were &quot;a sense of well being and a feeling of exhilaration&quot; and &quot;lessened fatigue in reaction to work&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Iverson, Leslie. Speed, Ecstacy, Ritalin: the science of amphetamines. Oxford, New York. Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II amphetamine was extensively used to combat fatigue and increase alertness in soldiers. After decades of reported abuse, the [[United States Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] banned Benzedrine inhalers, and limited amphetamine to prescription use in 1965, but non-medical use remained common. Amphetamine became a schedule II drug under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] in 1971.

The related compound [[methamphetamine]] was first synthesized from [[ephedrine]] in [[Japan]] in 1920 by chemist [[Akira Ogata]], via reduction of ephedrine using [[red phosphorus]] and [[iodine]]. The pharmaceutical [[Pervitin]] was a tablet of {{nowrap|3 mg}} methamphetamine which was available in Germany from 1938 and widely used in the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'', but by mid-1941 it became a controlled substance, partly because of the amount of time needed for a soldier to rest and recover after use and partly because of abuse. For the rest of the war, military doctors continued to issue the drug, but less frequently and with increasing discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rasmussen |first= Nicolas |authorlink= |title= On Speed: The Many Lives of Amphetamine |year= 2008 |publisher= New York University Press |location= New York, New York |isbn= 0-8147-7601-9 |chapter= Ch. 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, both of these compounds had been thought to be human inventions. These findings have never been duplicated, and the analyses are believed by many biochemists to be the result of experimental error, and as such the validity of the report has come into question. [[Alexander Shulgin]], one of the most experienced biochemical investigators and the discoverer of many new psychotropic substances, has tried to contact the Texas A&amp;M researchers and verify their findings.

Nonprescription stimulants were detected in 12 percent of the drivers, about half of whom gave no medical explanation for their presence...

Although implementation of the order on the trucking industry was kept to a gradual rate in consideration of its projected effects on the national economy, in the decades following the order, amphetamine and other drug abuse by truck drivers has since dropped drastically.

===Detection in body fluids===
Amphetamine is frequently measured in urine as part of a drug abuse testing program, in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims, or in whole blood to assist in the forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a case of sudden death. Techniques such as immunoassay may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetics drugs, so chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine should be employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether obtained legally (via prescription) or illicitly, or possibly as a result of formation from a prodrug such as lisdexamfetamine or selegiline. Chiral separation is needed to assess the possible contribution of l-methamphetamine (Vicks Inhaler) toward a positive test result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Verstraete AG, Heyden FV |title=Comparison of the sensitivity and specificity of six immunoassays for the detection of amphetamines in urine |journal=J Anal Toxicol |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=359–64 |year=2005 |pmid=16105261 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paul BD, Jemionek J, Lesser D, Jacobs A, Searles DA |title=Enantiomeric separation and quantitation of (+/-)-amphetamine, (+/-)-methamphetamine, (+/-)-MDA, (+/-)-MDMA, and (+/-)-MDEA in urine specimens by GC-EI-MS after derivatization with (R)-(-)- or (S)-(+)-alpha-methoxy-alpha-(trifluoromethy)phenylacetyl chloride (MTPA) |journal=J Anal Toxicol |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=449–55 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15516295 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.

==Society and culture==
From the 1960s onward, amphetamine has been popular with many [[youth subcultures]] in Britain (and other parts of the world) as a [[recreational drug]]. It has been commonly used by [[mod (subculture)|mods]], [[skinheads]], [[punks]], [[Goth subculture|goths]], gangsters, and [[casuals]] in all night soul and ska dances, punk concerts, [[basement show]]s and [[football hooliganism|fighting on the terraces]] by casuals. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The [[hippie]] [[counterculture]] was very critical of amphetamines due to the behaviors they cause; in an interview with the [[Los Angeles Free Press]] in 1965, beat writer [[Allen Ginsberg]] commented that &quot;Speed is antisocial, paranoid making, it's a drag... all the nice gentle dope fiends are getting screwed up by the real horror monster Frankenstein speed freaks who are going round stealing and bad-mouthing everybody&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===In mathematics===
Famous mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] took amphetamine, and once won a bet from his friend [[Ronald Graham|Ron Graham]], who bet him $500 that he could not stop taking the drug for a month.&lt;ref name=&quot;hill&quot;&gt;Hill, J. [http://www.untruth.org/~josh/math/Paul%20Erd%f6s%20bio-rev2.pdf Paul Erdos, Mathematical Genius, Human (In That Order)]&lt;/ref&gt;
Erdős won the bet, but complained during his abstinence that mathematics had been set back by a month: &quot;Before, when I looked at a piece of blank paper my mind was filled with ideas. Now all I see is a blank piece of paper.&quot; After he won the bet, he promptly resumed his amphetamine habit.

===In music===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
Many songs have been written about amphetamine, for example in the track entitled &quot;[[St. Ides Heaven]]&quot; from singer/songwriter, [[Elliott Smith]]'s self-titled album. ''[[Semi Charmed Life]]'' by Third Eye Blind also references amphetamine. Another blatant example would be the song simply labelled &quot;Amphetamine&quot; by Alternative rock band [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]], and the song &quot;20 Dollar nose bleed&quot; by the Pop-rock band [[Fall Out Boy]]. It has also influenced the aesthetics of many rock'n'roll bands (especially in the [[garage rock]], mod R&amp;B, [[death rock]], punk/hardcore, [[gothic rock]] and extreme heavy metal genres). [[Hüsker Dü]], [[Jesus and Mary Chain]]'s and [[The Who]] were keen amphetamine users early in their existence. [[Land Speed Record (album)|Land Speed Record]] is an allusion to Hüsker Dü's amphetamine use. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Amphetamine was widely abused in the 1980s underground punk-rock scene. Pop-punk band NOFX have incorporated references to Amphetamines and other stimulants, the two most obvious being the song &quot;Three on Speed&quot; from the &quot;Surfer&quot; 8&quot; LP (in reference to the three guys being on Amphetamine while recording the album), and earlier the album &quot;The Longest Line&quot; is in reference to a &quot;line&quot; of Amphetamine ready for insufflation.
[[The Rolling Stones]] referenced the drug in their song &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knocking&quot; on the album [[Sticky Fingers]] (&quot;Y'all got cocaine eyes / Yeah, ya got speed-freak jive now&quot;). [[Lou Reed]] refers explicitly to the drug on his album [[Berlin]], in the song &quot;How Do You Think It Feels?&quot;. Reed's band [[The Velvet Underground]], a creation of [[Andy Warhol]]'s Factory Years, was fueled by amphetamines, as well as naming their second album [[White Light/White Heat]] after the drug and making reference to the song in &quot;[[Sister Ray]].&quot;.

Many rock'n'roll bands have named themselves after amphetamine and drug slang surrounding it. For example [[Mod revival]]ists, [[Purple Hearts (UK band)|The Purple Hearts]] named themselves after the amphetamine tablets popular with mods during the 1960s, as did the Australian band of the same name during the mid-1960s. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The Amphetameanies, a ska-punk band, are also named after amphetamine, but also imitate its effects. [[Dexy's Midnight Runners]], of number one hit &quot;[[Come On Eileen]]&quot;, are named after [[Dexedrine]]. [[Motörhead]] derived their name from the British slang for 'speed freak' and Motorhead's Lemmy Kilmister is a long-term user of speed.

{{Trivia|date=December 2010}}
Producer [[David O. Selznick]] was an amphetamine user, and would often dictate long and rambling memos under the influence of amphetamine to his directors.&lt;ref&gt;''Memo From David O. Selznick'', http://www.amazon.com/Memo-David-Selznick-Memorandums-Autobiographical/dp/0375755314&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary ''Shadowing The Third Man'' relates that Selznick introduced [[The Third Man]] director [[Carol Reed]] to the use of amphetamine, which allowed Reed to bring the picture in below budget and on schedule by filming nearly 22 hours at a time.&lt;ref&gt;''Shadowing the Third Man'', http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0429086/&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrett Scott's documentary ''Cul-de-Sac: A Suburban War Story'' has a brief history of the manufacture and spread of amphetamine, and of its effects.&lt;ref&gt;''Cul-de-Sac'', http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317273/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This item may be worth keeping if it can be expanded --&gt;

In the film ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]'', [[Ellen Burstyn]] portrays Sara Goldfarb, an elderly widow who becomes addicted to weight-loss amphetamine pills. After suffering from amphetamine psychosis, she is hospitalized against her will, undergoes electro-convulsive therapy, and later on was confined at a mental asylum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081414/news ''Resurrection (1980) - IMDb'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the 2009 movie ''[[Amphetamine (2009 film)|Amphetamine]]'' plays on the double meaning of the word in Chinese - besides the name for the drug it also means 'isn't this his fate?' which figuratively ties to the movie's plot. The word is [[Transcription into Chinese characters|transliterated]] as [[wikt:安|安]] [[wikt:非|非]] [[wikt:他|他]] [[wikt:命|命]] - &quot;[[wikt:ān|ān]] [[wikt:fēi|fēi]] [[wikt:tā|tā]] [[wikt:mìng|mìng]]&quot; - and as commonly happens with transliteration of non-Chinese terms each character has independent meaning as an individual unrelated word.

In the 1972 film ''[[Ciao! Manhattan]]'', [[Edie Sedgwick]] portrays Susan Superstar, a fictional version of herself, who discusses her addiction with drugs, mainly amphetamines. In one particular scene, she talks about the exhilaration of her drug addiction in the infamous &quot;Speed Monologue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A182251]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2005 Oscar winner ''[[Walk the Line]]'' [[Joaquin Phoenix]] portrays John Cash, an uprising star in the music industry. He becomes addicted to amphetamines and eventually gets caught trying to cross borders with them.

In the film ''[[Empire Records]]'' [[Liv Tyler]]'s character admits to having an amphetamine addiction.

==Legal status==
* In the United Kingdom, amphetamines are regarded as [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|Class B]] drugs. The maximum penalty for unauthorized possession is five years in prison and an unlimited fine. The maximum penalty for illegal supply is 14 years in prison and an unlimited fine. Methamphetamine has recently been reclassified to [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|Class A]], penalties for possession of which are more severe (7 years in prison and an unlimited fine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Class A, B and C drugs|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs/drugs-law/Class-a-b-c/|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[telecommunications]], '''asynchronous communication''' is transmission of data without the use of an external [[clock signal]], where data can be transmitted intermittently rather than in a steady stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| accessdate = 2011-04-27
| location = http://www.webopedia.com/
| publisher = Webopedia
| title = asynchronous
| quote = The term asynchronous is usually used to describe communications in which data can be transmitted intermittently rather than in a steady stream.
| url = http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/asynchronous.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any timing required to recover data from the communication symbols is encoded within the symbols. The most significant aspect of asynchronous communications is variable bit rate, or that the transmitter and receiver [[clock generator]]s do not have to be exactly synchronized.

== Physical layer ==
{{main|Asynchronous serial communication}}
In [[asynchronous serial communication]] at the [[physical protocol layer]], the data blocks are code words of a certain [[word length]], for example [[octets]] ([[bytes]]) or [[ASCII characters]], delimited by start bits and stop bits. A variable length space can be inserted between the code words. No bit synchronization signal is required. This is sometimes called [[character oriented communication]]. Examples are the [[RS-232]]C serial standard, and [[MNP2]] and [[V.2]] modems and older.

== Data link layer and higher ==
Asynchronous communication at the [[data link layer]] or higher protocol layers is known as [[statistical multiplexing]] or [[packet mode]] communication, for example [[asynchronous transfer mode]] (ATM). In this case the asynchronously transferred blocks are called [[data packet]]s, for example ATM cells. The opposite is [[circuit switched]] communication, which provides constant bit rate, for example [[ISDN]] and [[SONET/SDH]].

The packets may be encapsulated in a [[data frame]], with a [[frame synchronization]] bit sequence indicating the start of the frame, and sometimes also a [[bit synchronization]] bit sequence, typically 01010101, for identification of the bit transition times. Note that at the physical layer, this is considered as synchronous serial communication. Examples of packet mode data link protocols that can be/are transferred using synchronous serial communication are the [[HDLC]], [[Ethernet]], [[Point-to-point protocol|PPP]] and [[USB]] protocols.

== Application layer ==
{{Original research|date=September 2007}}
An asynchronous communication service or application does not require a constant bit rate.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Examples are [[file transfer]], [[email]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. An example of the opposite, a synchronous communication service, is realtime [[streaming media]], for example [[IP telephony]], [[IP-TV]] and [[video conferencing]].

== Asynchronous communication in an electronically mediated environment ==
Asynchronous communication is a mediated form of communication in which the sender and receiver are not concurrently engaged in communication.

{{history of war}}
[[File:MuseeMarine-canon-1880-p1000439.jpg|thumb|210px|French naval piece of the late 19th century]]

Originally applied to any group of infantry primarily armed with projectile weapons, '''artillery''' has over time become limited in meaning to refer only to those [[engines of war]] that operate by projection of [[munitions]] far beyond the range of effect of personal weapons. These engines comprise specialised devices which use some form of stored energy to operate, whether mechanical, chemical, or electromagnetic. Originally designed to breach [[fortifications]], they have evolved from nearly static installations intended to reduce a single obstacle to highly mobile weapons of great flexibility in which now reposes the greater portion of a modern [[army]]'s offensive capabilities.

In common speech the word artillery is often used to refer to individual devices, together with their accessories and fittings, although these assemblages are more properly referred to as equipments. By association, artillery may also refer to the [[Combat Arms|arm of service]] that customarily operates such engines.

Artillery may also refer to a system of applied [[scientific research]] relating to the [[engineering design|design]], manufacture and employment of artillery [[weapon systems]] although, in general, the terms [[ballistics]] and [[ordnance]] are more commonly employed in this sense.

==Overview==
[[File:French soldiers in the Franco-Prussian War 1870-71.jpg|thumb|250px|right|French soldiers in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] 1870-71.]]
Although not called as such, machines recognizable as artillery have been employed in warfare since antiquity. The first references in the western historical tradition may be those of [[Hero of Alexandria]] c. AD 1C. but these devices were widely employed by the [[Roman Legions]] in Republican times well before the [[Christian era]]. Through much of their early history artillery was treated as part of the engineering art because the devices were often constructed mostly of local materials whenever needed and not permanently assembled. Until the introduction of [[gunpowder]] into western warfare artillery depended upon mechanical energy to operate and this severely limited the range and size of projectiles while also requiring the construction of very large apparatus to store sufficient energy.

For much of artillery's history during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Early modern period]], [[Cannon|artillery pieces]] on land were moved with the assistance of [[Draught horse|horse teams]]. During the more recent [[Modern era]] and in the [[Post-Modern]] period the artillery crew has used wheeled or tracked vehicles as a mode of transportation. Artillery used by naval forces has changed significantly also, with [[missile]]s replacing guns in [[surface warfare]].

Over the course of military history, projectiles were manufactured from a wide variety of materials, made in a wide variety of shapes, and used different means of inflicting physical damage and [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] to defeat specific types of [[Targeting (warfare)|targets]]. The engineering designs of the means of delivery have likewise changed significantly over time, and have become some of the most complex technological application today.

In some armies, the weapon of artillery is the projectile, not the piece that fires it. The process of delivering fire onto the target is called gunnery. The actions involved in operating the piece are collectively called &quot;serving the gun&quot; or &quot;detachment&quot; by the gun crew, constituting either direct or indirect artillery fire. The manner in which artillery units or formations are employed is called artillery support, and may at different periods in history refer to weapons designed to be fired from ground, sea, and even air-based [[weapons platform]]s.

Although the term also describes [[soldier]]s and [[sailor]]s with the primary function of using artillery weapons, the individuals who operate them are called [[Crew-served weapon|gunner]]s whatever their [[Military rank|rank]], however 'gunner' is the lowest rank in artillery arms. There is no generally recognised generic term for a gun, howitzer, mortar, and so forth: some armies use 'artillery piece', while others use 'gun'. The projectiles fired are typically either 'shot' (if solid) or 'shell' if not. Shell is a widely used generic term for a projectile, which is a component of [[ammunition|munitions]].

The term 'artillery' is also applied to a [[Combat Arms|combat arm]] of most [[military service]]s when used organizationally to describe [[Military organization|unit]]s and [[Military organization|formation]]s of the national [[armed forces]] that operate the weapons.

The gunners and their guns are usually grouped in teams called either 'crews' or 'detachments'. Several such crews and teams with other functions are combined into a unit of artillery usually called a [[Artillery battery|battery]], although sometimes called a company. Batteries are roughly equivalent to a [[Company (military unit)|company]] in the infantry, and are combined into larger [[military organization]]s for administrative and operational purpose.

During [[military operation]]s the role of field artillery is to provide close support to other arms in combat or to attack targets. The latter role is typically achieved by delivering either high explosive munitions to inflict casualties on the enemy from [[Penetrating trauma|casing fragments and other debris]] and [[blast injury|blast]], or by demolition of enemy positions, equipment and vehicles. Fire may be directed by an [[artillery observer]] or called onto [[Geographic coordinate system|map coordinates]].

[[Military doctrine]] has played a significant influence on the core [[Engineering design process|engineering design]] considerations of Artillery ordnance through its history, in seeking to achieve a balance between delivered volume of fire with ordnance mobility. However, during the modern period the consideration of protecting the gunners also arose due to the late-19th century introduction of the new generation of infantry weapons using [[Cylindro-conoidal bullet|conoidal bullet]], better known as the [[Minié ball]], with a range almost as long as that of field artillery.

The gunners' increasing proximity to and participation in direct combat against other combat arms and attacks by aircraft made the introduction of a gun shield necessary. The problems of how to employ a fixed or horse towed gun in mobile warfare necessitated the development of new methods of transporting the artillery into combat. Two distinct forms of artillery developed: the towed gun, which was used primarily to attack or defend a fixed line; and the self-propelled gun, which was designed to accompany a mobile force and provide continuous fire support. These influences have guided the development of artillery ordnance, systems, organisations, and operations until the present, with artillery systems capable of providing support at ranges from as little as 100&amp;nbsp;m to the intercontinental ranges of [[ballistic missile]]s. The only combat in which artillery is unable to take part in is [[Close Quarters Battle|close quarters combat]].

==Etymology==
The word as used in the current context originated in the [[Middle Ages]]. One suggestion is that it comes from the [[Old French]] ''atellier'' meaning &quot;to arrange&quot;, and ''attillement'' meaning &quot;equipment&quot;.

From the 13th Century an ''artillier'' referred to a builder of any war equipment, and for the next 250 years the sense of the word &quot;artillery&quot; covered all forms of military weapons. Hence the naming of the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] an essentially [[infantry]] unit until the 19th Century. Another suggestion is that comes from the Italian ''arte de tirare'' (art of shooting) coined by one of the first theorists on the use of artillery, [[Niccolo Tartaglia]].

==History==
[[File:Ancient Mechanical Artillery. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|[[Roman times|Roman]] mechanical artillery (click on picture for detailed descriptions)]]
Mechanical systems used for throwing ammunition in ancient warfare, also known as &quot;[[engine]]s of war&quot;, like the [[catapult]], [[onager (siege weapon)|onager]], [[trebuchet]], and [[ballista]], are also referred to by military historians as artillery.&lt;ref&gt;See [[siege engines]] for more information on pre-gunpowder devices.&lt;/ref&gt;

===High Middle Ages – first gunpowder artillery===
The first documented record of artillery with [[gunpowder]] propellant used on the battlefield was on January 28, 1132 when General [[Han Shizhong]] of the [[Song Dynasty]] used [[escalade]] and [[Huochong]] to capture a city in [[Fujian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guoxue123.com/shibu/0101/01ssqw/025.htm 世忠以天桥、对楼、云梯、火炮等急击之 ] [[History of Song]]&lt;/ref&gt; These small, crude weapons diffused into the [[Middle East]] (the [[Inventions in medieval Islam#Military|''madfaa'']]) and reached Europe in the 13th Century, in a very limited manner.

In Asia, [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] adopted the Chinese artillery and used it effectively in the [[Mongol invasions|great conquest]]. By late 14th Century AD, Chinese rebels used organized artillery and cavalry to push Mongols out.

As small smoothbore tubes these were initially cast in iron or bronze around a core, with the first drilled bore ordnance recorded in operation near Seville in 1247{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}. They fired lead, iron, or stone balls, sometimes large arrows and on occasions simply handfuls of whatever scrap came to hand. During the [[Hundred Years' War]], these weapons became more common, initially as the [[Bombard (weapon)|bombard]] and later the [[cannon]]. Cannon were always [[muzzle-loader]]s. While there were many early attempts at breech-loading designs, a lack of engineering knowledge rendered these even more dangerous to use than muzzle-loaders.

===The 15th century===

[[File:French gunner 15th century · HHWXI264.svg|thumb|[[France|French]] gunner in the 15th century, a 1904 illustration.]]
[[File:View from sao jorge.JPG|thumb|left|Cannon in the [[Castle of São Jorge]], [[Lisbon]].]]

In 1415, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] invaded the Mediterranean port town of [[Ceuta]]. While it is difficult to confirm the use of firearms in the siege of the city, it is known the Portuguese defended it thereafter with firearms, namely ''bombardas'', ''colebratas'', and ''falconetes''. In 1419, Sultan Abu Sa'id led an army to reconquer the fallen city, and Moroccans brought cannons and used them in the assault on Ceuta. Finally, hand-held firearms and riflemen appear in Morocco, in 1437, in an expedition against the people of [[Tangiers]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Weston F., Jr. ''Warfare and Firearms in Fifteenth Century Morocco, 1400-1492.'' &lt;!--Publisher &amp; place?--&gt; 1993&lt;/ref&gt;{{page?|date=April 2011}} It is clear these weapons had developed into several different forms, from small guns to large artillery pieces.

The artillery revolution in Europe caught on during the [[Hundred Years War]] and changed the way that battles were fought. In the following year, the English used a gunpowder weapon in a military campaign against the Scottish. However, at this time, the cannons used in battle were very small and not particularly powerful. Cannons were only useful for the defense of a [[castle]], as demonstrated at [[battle of Breteuil|Breteuil]] in 1356, when the besieged English used a cannon to destroy an attacking French assault tower. By the end of the 14th Century, cannons were only powerful enough to knock in roofs, and could not penetrate castle walls.

However, a major change occurred between 1420–1430, when artillery became much more powerful and could now batter strongholds and fortresses quite efficiently. The English, French, and Burgundians all advanced in military technology, and as a result the traditional advantage that went to the defense in a siege was lost. The cannons during this period were elongated, and the recipe for gunpowder was improved to make it three times as powerful as before.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford J. Rogers (1993) The Military Revolutions of the Hundred Years’ War. The Journal of Military History, 57(2)April, 241–278 http://links.jstor.org/sici?
sici=0899-3718(199304)57:2%3C241:TMROTH%3E2.0.CO;2-Fi, ISSN 08993718&lt;/ref&gt; These changes led to the increased power in the artillery weapons of the time.

[[Joan of Arc]] encountered gunpowder weaponry several times. When she led the French against the English at the Battle of Tourelles, in 1430, she faced heavy gunpowder fortifications, and yet her troops prevailed in that battle. In addition, she led assaults against the English-held towns of Jargeau, Meung, and Beaugency, all with the support of large artillery units. When she led the assault on [[Paris]], Joan faced stiff artillery fire, especially from the suburb of St. Denis, which ultimately led to her defeat in this battle. In April 1430, she went to battle against the Burgundians, whose support was purchased by the English. At this time, the Burgundians had the strongest and largest gunpowder arsenal among the European powers, and yet the French, under Joan of Arc's leadership, were able to beat back the Burgundians and defend themselves.&lt;ref&gt;DeVries, K: The Use of Gunpowder Weaponry By and Against Joan or Arc During the Hundred Years War. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, most of the battles of the Hundred Years War that Joan of Arc participated in were fought with gunpowder artillery.
[[File:Zamek w Malborku - bombarda.jpg|thumb|A bombard, [[Malbork Castle]]]]

The army of [[Mehmet the Conqueror]], which conquered [[Constantinople]] in 1453, included both artillery and foot soldiers armed with gunpowder weapons.&lt;ref name=Nicolle2&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolle|first=David|authorlink=David Nicolle|title=Constantinople 1453: The end of Byzantium|publisher=[[Osprey]]|year=2000|pages=29–30|isbn=1-84176-091-9|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ottomans brought to the siege sixty-nine guns in fifteen separate batteries and trained them at the walls of the city.  The barrage of Ottoman cannon fire lasted forty days, and they are estimated to have fired 19,320 times.&lt;ref name=Nicolle3&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolle|first=David|title=Armies of the Ottoman Turks 1300-1774|publisher=[[Osprey]]|year=1983|pages=29–30|isbn=0-85045-511-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Artillery also played a decisive role in the [[Battle of St. Jakob an der Birs]] of 1444.

&lt;!--
The new [[Ming Dynasty]] established the &quot;Divine Engine Battalion&quot; (神机营), which specialized in various types of artillery. Light cannons and cannons with multiple volleys were developed. In a campaign to suppress a local minority rebellion near today's Burmese border, the Ming army used a 3-line formation of arquebuses/muskets to destroy an elephant formation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Between 1593 and 1597, about 300,000 Chinese and Japanese troops [[Japanese invasions of Korea|fought in Korea]] and both sides used heavy artillery in land and sea battles.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Early modern period – age of the smoothbores===
&lt;!--Article Tower of St. Olav refers to this heading. Do not change it--&gt;

Bombards were of value mainly in [[siege]]s, a famous Turkish example used at the [[Fall of Constantinople|siege of Constantinople]] in 1453 weighed 19 tons{{Vague|which tons?|date=February 2009}}, took 200 men and sixty oxen to emplace, and could fire just seven times a day. The Fall of Constantinople was perhaps &quot;''the first event of supreme importance whose result was determined by the use of artillery''&quot; when the huge bronze cannons of [[Mehmed II]], made by the Hungarian [[Orban]], breached the city's walls, ending the [[Byzantine Empire]], according to Sir [[Charles Oman]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

Bombards developed in Europe were massive smoothbore weapons distinguished by their lack of a field carriage, immobility once emplaced, highly individual design, and noted unreliability (in 1460 James II, King of Scots, was killed when one exploded at the siege of Roxburgh). Their large size precluded the barrels being cast and they were constructed out of metal staves or rods bound together with hoops like a barrel, giving their name to the [[gun barrel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WARKEEGAN&quot;&gt;[[John Keegan|Keegan, John]], ''A History of Warfare'' (Vintage, &lt;!--place?--&gt; 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;{{page?|date=April 2011}}

[[File:Gabions.png|left|thumb|'''Artillery''' with [[Gabion]] fortification.]]

[[File:Fortpoint02-01-2006.JPG|thumb|right|Cannons on display at [[Fort Point, San Francisco|Fort Point]].]]
The use of the word &quot;cannon&quot; marks the introduction in the 15th Century of a dedicated field carriage with axle, trail and animal-drawn limber—this produced mobile field pieces that could move and support an army in action, rather than being found only in siege and static defences. The reduction in the size of the barrel was due to improvements in both iron technology and gunpowder manufacture, while the development of [[trunnion]]s – projections at the side of the cannon as an integral part of the cast – allowed the barrel to be fixed to a more movable base, and also made raising or lowering the barrel much easier.&lt;ref name=&quot;WARKEEGAN&quot;/&gt;

The first land-based mobile weapon is usually credited to [[Jan Žižka]], who deployed his oxen-hauled cannon during the [[Hussite Wars]] of Bohemia (1418–1424). However cannons were still large and cumbersome. With the rise of musketry in the 16th Century, cannon were largely (though not entirely) displaced from the battlefield&amp;mdash;the cannon were too slow and cumbersome to be used and too easily lost to a rapid enemy advance.

[[File:Polish multiple gun from XVI-XVII century.png|thumb|right|[[Poland|Polish]] multiple gun from 16th-17th Century]]
The combining of shot and powder into a single unit, a cartridge, occurred in the 1620s with a simple fabric bag, and was quickly adopted by all nations. It speeded loading and made it safer, but unexpelled bag fragments were an additional fouling in the gun barrel and a new tool—a [[Worm (artillery)|worm]]—was introduced to remove them. [[Gustavus Adolphus]] is identified as the general who made cannon an effective force on the battlefield—pushing the development of much lighter and smaller weapons and deploying them in far greater numbers than previously. The outcome of battles was still determined by the clash of infantry.

Shells, explosive-filled fused projectiles, were also developed in the 17th Century.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The development of specialized pieces—shipboard artillery, [[howitzer]]s and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s—was also begun in this period. More esoteric designs, like the multi-barrel ''[[ribauldequin]]'' (known as &quot;organ guns&quot;), were also produced.

The 1650 book by [[Kazimierz Siemienowicz]] &quot;''Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima''&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Ordway, Vice-Commander of Artillery of the Polish king, Wladyslaw IV, ''Great Art of Artillery, the First Part'', also known as ''The Complete Art of Artillery'',&lt;!--publisher &amp; place?--&gt; pp.407–416.&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the most important contemporary publications on the subject of artillery. For over two centuries this work was used in [[Europe]] as a basic artillery manual.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

One of the most significant effects of artillery during this period was however somewhat more indirect – by easily reducing to rubble any medieval-type fortification or city wall (some which had stood since Roman times), it abolished millennia of siege-warfare strategies and styles of fortification building.&lt;ref name=&quot;WARKEEGAN&quot;/&gt; This led, among other things, to a frenzy of new [[bastion]]-style fortifications to be built all over Europe and in its colonies, but also had a strong integrating effect on emerging nation-states, as kings were able to use their newfound artillery superority to force any local dukes or lords to submit to their will, setting the stage for the absolutist kingdoms to come.&lt;ref name=&quot;WARKEEGAN&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S36048, Frankreich, Arras, Artillerie.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The highly effective German [[15 cm sFH 13|15cm field howitzers]] during the [[First World War]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
Cannons continued to become smaller and lighter—Frederick II of Prussia deployed the first genuine light artillery during the [[Seven Years War]]—but until the mid-19th Century improvements in metallurgy, chemistry, manufacturing and other sciences did not alter the basic design and operation of a cannon.

&quot;The earliest battlefield use of indirect fire was probably at [[Battle of Kay|Paltzig]] in July 1759: the Russian artillery fired over the tops of trees.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Bellamy, ''Red God of War: Soviet Artillery and Rocket Forces'', London, 1986, p.16, quoted in {{cite book |title= The Dynamics of Military Revolution|last1= Knox|first1= MacGregor|last2= Murray|first2= Williamson|year= 2001|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= New York|isbn= 052180079X|page=135}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Artillery continued to gain prominence in the 18th Century when [[Jean-Baptiste de Gribeauval]], a French [[Weapons engineering|artillery engineer]] introduced the standardization of cannon design. He developed a {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} field howitzer whose gun barrel, carriage assembly and ammunition specifications were made uniform for all French cannons. The standardized interchangeable parts of these cannons down to the nuts, bolts and screws made their mass production and repair much easier.

Another major change at this time was the development of a [[flintlock]] firing mechanism for the cannons. The old method of firing the cannon involved the use of a linstock or match to light a small quantity of powder charge in a touchhole drilled into the breech. This technique was quite faulty because the ignited powder could easily be extinguished by rain and an excess amount of charge could cause the guns to burst.

The flintlock mechanism on the other hand only needs to be cocked and when its trigger is pulled the flint of the hammer strikes the frizzen throwing sparks into the pan and detonating the charge at the breech. The trigger can be tied to a lanyard and fired from a safe distance. These changes laid down in 1789 would prove decisive for [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]]'s conquests. Napoleon, himself a former artillery officer, perfected the tactic of massed artillery batteries unleashed upon a critical point in his enemies' line as prelude to infantry and cavalry assault and, more often than not, victory.

Rifling had been tried on small arms in the 15th Century. The machinery to accurately rifle a cannon barrel did not arrive until the 19th Century. Cavelli, Wahrendorff, and Whitworth all independently produced rifled cannon in the 1840s, but these guns did not see widespread use until the latter stages of the [[American Civil War]], when designs such as the various caliber [[Rodman gun]]s came to prominence.&lt;!--Rifled guns also had to wait for better metallurgy, or they'd explode...--&gt;

[[File:58 dress hat.jpg|right|thumb|1858 Dress Hat, a.k.a. [[Hardee hat]], branch of service artillery.]]

From the 1860s artillery was forced into a series of rapid technological and operational changes, accelerating through the 1870s and thereafter. The first effective breech-loader (allowing a higher rate of fire while keeping the detachment behind the gun) was developed in 1855 by Sir William Armstrong, and accepted for British service in 1859. The first cannon to contain all 'modern' features is generally considered to be the [[Canon de 75 modèle 1897|French 75]] of 1897 with its cased ammunition, effective breech-loading, modern sights, self-contained firing mechanism, and [[hydro-pneumatic recoil]] dampening.

After the War of 1870, the Germans became strong advocates of [[indirect fire]]. In 1882 a Russian officer, Lieutenant Colonel KG Guk, published ''Indirect Fire for Field Artillery'' that provided a practical method of using aiming points for indirect fire by describing, &quot;all the essentials of aiming points, crest clearance, and corrections to fire by an observer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Dynamics of Military Revolution|last1= Knox|first1= MacGregor|last2= Murray|first2= Williamson|year= 2001|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= New York|isbn= 052180079X|page=136}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later the [[Richtfläche sight|Richtfläche (lining-plane) sight]] was invented in Germany and provided a means of indirect laying in azimuth, complementing the clinometers for indirect laying in elevation which already existed. In the next 15 years, the techniques of [[indirect fire]] became available for all types of artillery.&lt;!--To make indirect fire really effective required telegraph or telephone communication...--&gt; Indirect fire was the defining characteristic of 20th Century artillery and led to undreamt of changes in the amount of artillery, its tactics, organisation and techniques most of which occurred during World War I. To quote McCamley,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[By WWII] decades if not centuries of weapons development had settled into maturity on an almost imperceptibly rising plateau; the sciences of [[ballistics]] and [[Explosive material|explosive]] chemistry had achieved near perfection given the available technology of the age. Arguably the only new developments of note were discarding [[sabot]] rounds... and the hollow-charge projectile... both of which were of marginal significance in the Second World War.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The movement toward precision fires did not begin until late in World War I. &quot;In 1916, the Russians conducted their first registration point shoot: the adjustment of fire onto one target to identify inaccuracy, then switching to another while applying the known correction to achieve accuracy and surprise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Dynamics of Military Revolution|last1= Knox|first1= MacGregor|last2= Murray|first2= Williamson|year= 2001|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= New York|isbn= 052180079X|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artillery had begun the shift away from massed fires to a greater emphasis on precision fires.

===After the Second World War – age of precision===
[[File:WWI Field Gun 316.JPG|thumb|right|[[World War I]] German Field Gun]]
[[modern era|Modern]] artillery is most obviously distinguished by its large caliber, firing an [[explosive]] [[shell (projectile)|shell]] or [[rocket]], and being of such a size and weight as to require a specialized carriage for firing and transport. However, its most important characteristic is the use of indirect fire, whereby the firing equipment is aimed without seeing the target through its sights. Indirect fire emerged at the beginning of the 20th Century and was greatly enhanced by the development of [[predicted fire]] methods in World War I.&lt;!--To make indirect fire really effective required telegraph or telephone communication...--&gt; Indirect fire uses firing data set on the sights, predicted fire methods ensure that these data are accurate and corrects for variations from the standard conditions for muzzle velocity, temperature, wind, and air density.

Weapons covered by the term 'modern artillery' include &quot;[[cannon]]&quot; artillery such as the [[howitzer]], [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]], and [[field gun]], and [[rocket artillery]]. Certain smaller-caliber mortars are more properly designated small arms rather than artillery, albeit indirect-fire small arms. This term also came to include [[coastal artillery]] which traditionally defended coastal areas against seaborne attack and controlled the passage of ships. With the advent of powered flight at the start of the 20th Century, artillery also included ground-based [[anti-aircraft battery|anti-aircraft batteries]].

The term &quot;artillery&quot; has traditionally not been used for projectiles with internal [[guidance systems]], preferring the term &quot;missilery&quot;, though some modern artillery units employ surface-to-surface [[missile]]s. Advances in terminal guidance systems for small munitions has allowed large-caliber guided projectiles to be developed, blurring this distinction.&lt;!--Guidance has been proposed even for rifle rounds...--&gt;

==Ammunition==
[[File:Nuclear artillery test Grable Event - Part of Operation Upshot-Knothole.jpg|thumb|Artillery ammunition can also make use of [[nuclear artillery|nuclear warheads]], as seen here.]]
{{Commons category|Fuzes}}
One of the most important role of logistics is the supply of [[munition]]s as a primary type of artillery consumable, their [[Military storage|storage]] and the provision of fuses, detonators and warheads at the point where artillery troops will assemble the charge, projectile, bomb or shell.

A round of artillery ammunition comprises four components:

*1: The fuze
*2: The projectile
*3: The propellant
*4: The primer

===Fuzes===
{{Main|Artillery fuze}}
The normal artillery spelling is &quot;fuze&quot;. [[Fuze (munitions)|Fuzes]] are the devices that trigger explosion of the artillery ammunition charge. Broadly there are four main types:
* impact (including graze and delay)
* mechanical time including [[Air burst|airburst]]
* proximity sensor including airburst&lt;!--proximity has also been used against ground troops &amp; barges...--&gt;
* electronic time including airburst

Most artillery fuzes are nose fuzes. However, base fuzes have been used with armour piercing shells and for squash head (HESH or HEP) anti-tank shells. At least one nuclear shell and its non-nuclear spotting version also used a multi-deck mechanical time fuze fitted into its base.

Impact fuzes were, and in some armies remain, the standard fuze for HE. Their default action is normally 'superquick', some have had a 'graze' action which allows them to penetrate light cover and others have 'delay'. Delay fuzes allow the shell to penetrate the ground before exploding. Armor- or concrete-piercing fuzes are specially hardened. During World War I and later, ricochet fire with delay or graze fuzed HE shells, fired with a flat angle of descent, was used to achieve airburst.

HE shells can be fitted with other fuzes. Airburst fuzes usually have a combined airburst and impact function. However, until the introduction of [[proximity fuze]]s, the airburst function was mostly used with cargo munitions—for example shrapnel, illumination, and smoke. The larger calibers of [[anti-aircraft]] artillery are almost always used airburst. Airburst fuzes have to have the fuze length (running time) set on them. This is done just before firing using either a wrench or a fuze setter pre-set to the required fuze length.

Early airburst fuzes used igniferous timers which lasted into the second half of the 20th Century. Mechanical time fuzes appeared in the early part of the century. These required a means of powering them. The Thiel mechanism used a spring and escapement (i.e. 'clockwork'), Junghans used [[centrifugal force]] and gears, and Dixi used centrifugal force and balls. From about 1980, electronic time fuzes started replacing mechanical ones for use with cargo munitions.

Proximity fuzes have been of two types: photo-electric or radar. The former was not very successful and seems only to have been used with British [[anti-aircraft artillery]] 'unrotated projectiles' (rockets) in World War II. Radar proximity fuzes were a big improvement over the mechanical (time) fuzes which they replaced. Mechanical time fuzes required an accurate calculation of their running time, which was affected by non-standard conditions. With HE (requiring a burst 20 to 30 feet above the ground), if this was very slightly wrong the rounds would either hit the ground or burst too high. Accurate running time was less important with cargo munitions that burst much higher.

The first [[Proximity fuze|radar proximity fuzes]] (codenamed 'VT') were initially used against aircraft in World War II. Their ground use was delayed for fear of the enemy recovering 'blinds' (artillery shells which failed to detonate) and copying the fuze. The first proximity fuzes were designed to detonate about {{convert|30|ft|m}} above the ground. These air-bursts are much more lethal against personnel than ground bursts because they deliver a greater proportion of useful fragments and deliver them into terrain where a prone soldier would be protected from ground bursts.

However, proximity fuzes can suffer premature detonation because of the moisture in heavy rain clouds. This led to 'controlled variable time' (CVT) after World War II. These fuzes have a mechanical timer that switched on the radar about 5 seconds before expected impact, they also detonated on impact.

The proximity fuze emerged on the battlefields of Europe in late December 1944. They have become known as the U.S. Artillery's &quot;Christmas present&quot;, and were much appreciated when they arrived during the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. They were also used to great effect in anti-aircraft projectiles in the Pacific against ''[[kamikaze]]'' as well as in Britain against [[V-1 flying bomb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceservice.si.edu/pages/102001.htm Smithsonian]&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic multi-function fuzes started to appear around 1980. Using solid-state electronics they were relatively cheap and reliable, and became the standard fitted fuze in operational ammunition stocks in some western armies. The early versions were often limited to proximity airburst, albeit with height of burst options, and impact. Some offered a go/no-go functional test through the fuze setter.

Later versions introduced induction fuze setting and testing instead of physically placing a fuze setter on the fuze. The latest, such as Junghan's DM84U provide options giving, superquick, delay, a choice of proximity heights of burst, time and a choice of foliage penetration depths.

A new type of artillery fuze will appear soon. In addition to other functions these offer some course correction capability, not full precision but sufficient to significantly reduce the dispersion of the shells on the ground.

===Projectiles===
{{Main|Shell (projectile)}}
The projectile is the munition or &quot;bullet&quot; fired downrange. This may or may not be an explosive device. Traditionally, projectiles have been classified as &quot;shot&quot; or &quot;shell&quot;, the former being solid and the latter having some form of &quot;payload&quot;.

Shells can also be divided into three configurations: bursting, base ejection or nose ejection. The latter is sometimes called the shrapnel configuration. The most modern is base ejection, which was introduced in World War I. Both base and nose ejection are almost always used with airburst fuzes. Bursting shells use various types of fuze depending on the nature of the payload and the tactical need at the time.

Payloads have included:
*Bursting: high-explosive, [[white phosphorus]] (&quot;Willie Pete&quot; or &quot;Wilson Picket&quot;){{Citation needed|date=February 2011}},&lt;!--since when Wilson Pickett? It was &quot;Willie Pete&quot; from the phonetic alphabet...--&gt; coloured marker, chemical, nuclear devices; [[high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) and canister may be considered special types of bursting shell.
*Base Ejection: dual purpose improved conventional munitions ([[DPICM]])-bomblet, scatterable mines, illuminating, coloured flare, smoke, incendiary, propaganda, chaff&lt;ref&gt;p.266, Browne &amp; Thurbon&lt;/ref&gt; (foil to jam radars: originally known as &quot;window&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;p.262, International
Aeronautic Federation&lt;/ref&gt; and modern exotics such as electronic payloads and sensor-fuzed munitions.
*Nose Ejection: shrapnel, flechette, star, incendiary.

====Projectile stabilization====
*'''Rifled''' Traditionally, artillery projectiles have been spin-stabilised, meaning that they spin in flight so that [[gyroscopic]] forces prevent them from tumbling. Spin is induced by gun barrels having [[rifling]] which engages a soft metal band around the projectile, called a &quot;[[driving band]]&quot; (UK) or &quot;rotating band&quot; (U.S.). The driving band is usually made of copper, but synthetic materials have also been used.
*'''Smoothbore/Fin-Stabilized''' In modern artillery [[smoothbore]] tubes have been used mostly by [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]]. These projectiles use fins in the airflow at their rear to maintain correct orientation. The primary benefit over rifled barrels is reduced barrel wear and longer ranges that can be achieved (due to the reduced loss of energy to friction and gas escaping around the projectile via the rifling).
*'''Rifled/Fin-Stabilized''' A combination of the above can be used, where the barrel is rifled, but the projectile also has deployable fins for stabilization,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6779754-fulltext.html|title=

===Propellant===
[[File:152 mm howitzer D-20 belong to Military of Iran.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[152 mm towed gun-howitzer M1955 (D-20)|152 mm howitzer D-20]] during the [[Iran-Iraq war]].]]
All forms of artillery require a [[propellant]] to propel the projectile at the target. Propellant is always a low explosive, this means it [[Deflagration|deflagrates]] instead of [[detonation|detonating]], as with high explosives. The shell is accelerated to a high velocity in a very short time by the rapid generation of gas from the burning propellant. This high pressure is achieved by burning the propellant in a contained area, either the chamber of a gun barrel or the combustion chamber of a rocket motor.

Until the late 19th century the only available propellant was [[black powder]]. Black powder had many disadvantages as a propellant; it has relatively low power, requiring large amounts of powder to fire projectiles, and created thick clouds of white smoke that would obscure the targets, betray the positions of guns and make aiming impossible. In 1846 nitrocellulose (also known as guncotton) was discovered, and the high explosive [[nitroglycerin]] was discovered at much the same time. [[Nitrocellulose]] was significantly more powerful than black powder, and was smokeless. Early guncotton was unstable however, and burned very fast and hot, leading to greatly increased barrel wear. Widespread introduction of smokeless powder would wait until the advent of the double-base powders, which combine nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin to produce powerful, smokeless, stable propellant.

Many other formulations were developed in the following decades, generally trying to find the optimum characteristics of a good artillery propellant; low temperature, high energy, non corrosive, highly stable, cheap, and easy to manufacture in large quantities. Broadly, modern gun propellants are divided into three classes: single-base propellants which are mainly or entirely nitrocellulose based, double-base propellants composed of a combination of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin, and triple base composed of a combination of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin and [[Nitroguanidine]].

Artillery shells fired from a barrel can be assisted to greater range in three ways:

* rocket assisted projectiles (RAP) enhance and sustain the projectile's velocity by providing additional 'push' from a small rocket motor that is part of the projectile's base.
*[[Base bleed]] uses a small pyrotechnic charge at the base of the projectile to introduce sufficient combustion products into the low-pressure region behind the base of the projectile responsible for a large proportion of the [[Form drag|drag]].
* ramjet assisted, similar to rocket assisted but using a ramjet instead of a rocket motor; it is anticipated that a ramjet-assisted 120-mm mortar shell could reach a range of {{convert|22|mi|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = McNab | first = Chris | authorlink = | coauthors = Hunter Keeter | title = Tools of Violence: Guns, Tanks and Dirty Bombs | publisher = Osprey Publishing | year = 2008 | location = | page = 145 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1846032253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Propelling charges for tube artillery can be provided in one of two ways: either as cartridge bags or in metal cartridge cases. Generally anti-aircraft artillery and smaller caliber (up to 6&quot; or 152.4&amp;nbsp;mm) guns use metal cartridge cases that include the round and propellant, similar to a modern rifle cartridge. This simplifies loading and is necessary for very high rates of fire. Bagged propellant allows the amount of powder to be raised or lowered depending on the range to the target. it also makes handling of larger shells easier. Each requires a totally different type of breech to the other. A metal case holds an integral primer to initiate the propellant and provides the gas seal to prevent the gases leaking out of the breech, this is called obturation. With bagged charges the breech itself provides obturation and holds the primer. In either case the primer is usually percussion but electrical is also used and laser ignition is emerging. Modern 155&amp;nbsp;mm guns have a primer magazine fitted to their breech.

[[File:16-in Battleship Ammunition.JPG|thumb|Battleship Ammunition: 16&quot; artillery shells aboard one of [[United States|America's]] [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa''-class battleships]].]]

Artillery ammunition has four classifications according to use:
*'''Service''': ammunition used in [[live fire exercise|live fire training]] or for wartime use in a combat zone. Also known as &quot;warshot&quot; ammunition.
*'''Practice''': Ammunition with a non- or minimally-explosive projectile that mimics the characteristics (range, accuracy) of live rounds for use under training conditions. Practice artillery ammunition often utilizes a colored-smoke-generating bursting charge for marking purposes in place of the normal high explosive charge.
*'''Dummy''': Ammunition with an inert warhead, inert primer, and no propellant; used for training or display.
*'''Blank''': Ammunition with live primer, greatly reduced propellant charge (typically [[black powder]]) and no projectile; used for training, demonstration or ceremonial use.

==Field artillery system==
[[File:Cyclone-French-320th-artillery-5 Sept-1917-Belgium.jpg|thumb|right|''Cyclone'' of the 320th French Artillery, in [[Hoogstade]], [[Belgium]], 5 September 1917.]]
Because field artillery mostly uses [[indirect fire]] the guns have to be part of a system that enables them to attack targets invisible to them in accordance with the combined arms plan.

The main functions in the field artillery system are:
*Communications
*Command: authority to allocate resources;
*Target acquisition: detect, identify and deduce the location of targets;
*Control: authority to decide which targets to attack and allot fire units to the attack;
*Production of firing data – to deliver fire from a fire unit onto its target;
*Fire units: guns, launchers or mortars grouped together;
*Specialist services – produce data to support the production of accurate firing data;
*Logistic services – to provide combat supplies, particularly ammunition, and equipment support.

Organisationally and spatially these functions can be arranged in many ways. Since the creation of modern indirect fire different armies have done it differently at different times and in different places. Technology is often a factor but so are military-social issues, the relationships between artillery and other arms, and the criteria by which military capability, efficiency and effectiveness are judged. Cost is also an issue because artillery is expensive due to the large quantities of ammunition that it uses and its level of manpower.

'''Communications''' underpin the artillery system, they have to be reliable and in real-time to link the various elements. During the 20th century communications used flags, morse code by radio, line and lights, voice and teletype (teleprinter) by line. Radio has included HF, VHF, satellite and radio relay as well as modern tactical trunk systems. In western armies at least radio communications are now usually encrypted.

The emergence of mobile and man-portable radios after World War I had a major impact on artillery because it enable fast and mobile operations with observers accompanying the infantry or armoured troops. In World War II some armies fitted their self-propelled guns with radios. However, sometimes in the first half of the 20th century hardcopy artillery fire plans and map traces were distributed.

Data communications can be especially important for artillery because by using structured messages and defined data types fire control messages can be automatically routed and processed by computers. For example a target acquisition element can send a message with target details which is automatically routed through the tactical and technical fire control elements to deliver firing data to the gun's laying system and the gun automatically laid. As tactical data networks become pervasive they will provide any connected soldier with a means for reporting target information and requesting artillery fire.

'''Command''' is the authority to allocate resources, typically by assigning artillery formations or units. Terminology and its implications vary widely. However, very broadly, artillery units are assigned in direct support or in general support. Typically, the former mostly provide close support to manoeuvre units while the latter may provide close support and or depth fire, notably counter-battery. Generally, 'direct support' also means that the artillery unit provides artillery observation and liaison teams to the supported units. Sometimes direct support units are placed under command of the regiment/brigade they support. General support units may be grouped into artillery formations for example, brigades even divisions, or multi-battalion regiments, and usually under command of division, corps or higher HQs. General support units tend to be moved to where they are most required at any particular time. Artillery command may impose priorities and constraints to support their combined arms commander's plans.

'''Target acquisition''' can take many forms, it is usually observation in real time but may be the product of analysis. Artillery observation teams are the most common means of target acquisition. However, air observers have been use since the beginning of indirect fire and were quickly joined by air photography. Target acquisition may also be by anyone that can get the information into the artillery system. Targets may be visible to forward troops or in depth and invisible to them.

Observation equipment can vary widely in its complexity.
*Unmanned air vehicles are the latest form of air observation, having been first introduced in the early 1960s.
*The equipment available to observation teams has progressed from just prismatic compass, hand-held or tripod mounted binoculars and sometimes optical range-finders.
*Special equipment for locating hostile artillery: flash spotting and notably [[sound ranging]] appeared in World War I the latter has been undergone increasing refinement as technology has improved. These were joined by radar in World War II.
*In the mid-1970s several armies started equipping their artillery observation teams with laser rangefinders, ground surveillance radars and night vision devices, these were soon followed by inertial orienting and navigating devices to improve the accuracy of target locations. The [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) provided a smaller and cheaper means of quick and accurate fixation for target acquisition devices.
*Specialised units with ground surveillance radars, unattended ground sensors or observation patrols operating in depth have also been used.
*Targets in depth may also be 'acquired' by intelligence processes using various sources and agencies such as [[HUMINT]], [[SIGINT]], [[ELINT]] and [[IMINT]].
*Laser guided shells require laser target designators, usually with observation teams on the ground but UAV installations are possible.
*Specialised artillery observation vehicles appeared in World War II and have greatly increased in sophistication since that time.

'''Control''', sometimes called tactical fire control, is primarily concerned with 'targeting' and the allotment of fire units to targets. This is vital when a target is within range of many fire units and the number of fire units needed depends on the nature of the target, and the circumstances and purpose of its engagement. Targeting is concerned with selecting the right weapons in the right quantities to achieve the required effects on the target. Allotment attempts to address the artillery dilemma—important targets are rarely urgent and urgent targets are rarely important. Of course importance is a matter of perspective; what is important to a divisional commander is rarely the same as what is important to an infantry platoon commander.
[[File:August 1984 - captured field guns in Jaji, Paktia.jpg|thumb|Afghans with two captured artillery field guns in Jaji, 1984.]]
Broadly, there are two situations: fire against opportunity targets and targets whose engagement is planned as part of a particular operation. In the latter situation command assigns fire units to the operation and an overall artillery fire planner makes a plan, possibly delegating resources for some parts of it to other planners. Fire plans may also involve use of non-artillery assets such as mortars and aircraft.

Control of fire against opportunity targets is an important differentiator between different types of artillery system. In some armies only designated artillery HQs have the tactical fire control authority to order fire units to engage a target, all 'calls for fire' being requests to these HQs. This authority may also extend to deciding the type and quantity of ammunition to be used. In other armies an 'authorised observer' (for example, artillery observation team or other target acquisition element) can order fire units to engage. In the latter case a battery observation team can order fire to their own battery and may be authorised to order fire to their own battalion and sometimes to many battalions. For example a divisional artillery commander may authorise selected observers to order fire to the entire divisional artillery. When observers or cells are not authorised they can still request fire.

Armies that apply forward tactical control generally put the majority of the more senior officers of artillery units forward in command observation posts or with the supported arm. Those that do not use this approach tend to put these officers close to the guns. In either case the observation element usually controls fire in detail against the target, such as adjusting it onto the target, moving it and co-ordinating it with the supported arm as necessary to achieve the required effects.

'''Firing data''' has to be calculated and is the key to indirect fire, the arrangements for this have varied widely. In the end firing data has two components: quadrant elevation and [[azimuth]], to these may be added the size of propelling charge and the fuze setting. The process to produce firing data this is sometimes called technical fire control. Before computers, some armies set the range on the gun's sights, which mechanically corrected it for the gun's muzzle velocity. For the first few decades of indirect fire, the firing data were often calculated by the observer who then adjusted the fall of shot onto the target.

However, the need to engage targets at night, in depth or hit the target with the first rounds quickly led to predicted fire being developed in World War I. Predicted fire existed alongside the older method. After World War II predicted methods were invariably applied but the fall of shot usually needed adjustment because of inaccuracy in locating the target, the proximity of friendly troops or the need to engage a moving target. Target location errors were significantly reduced once laser rangefinders, orientation and navigation devices were issued to observation parties.

In predicted fire the basic geospatial data of range, angle of sight and azimuth between a fire unit and its target was produced and corrected for variations from the 'standard conditions'. These variations included barrel wear, propellant temperature, different projectiles weights that all affected the muzzle velocity, and air temperature, density, wind speed &amp; direction and rotation of the earth that affect the shell in flight. The net effect of variations can also be determined by shooting at an accurately known point, a process called 'registration'.

All these calculations to produce a quadrant elevation (or range) and azimuth were done manually by highly trained soldiers using instruments, tabulated data, data of the moment and approximations until battlefield computers started appearing in the 1960s and '70s. While some early calculators copied the manual method (typically substituting [[polynomials]] for tabulated data), computers use a different approach. They simulate a shell's trajectory by 'flying' it in short steps and applying data about the conditions affecting the trajectory at each step. This simulation is repeated until it produces a quadrant elevation and azimuth that lands the shell within the required 'closing' distance of the target co-ordinates. NATO has a standard ballistic model for computer calculations and has expanded the scope of this into the NATO Armaments Ballistic Kernel (NABK).&lt;ref&gt;The public NABK Brochure [https://aop37.lsec.dnd.ca/sites/s4_public_info/S4%20Document%20Information/NABK%20brochure.pdf NABK]&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical fire control has been performed in various places, but mostly in firing batteries. However, in the 1930s the French moved it to battalion level and combined it with some tactical fire control. This was copied by the US. Nevertheless most armies seemed to have retained it within firing batteries and some duplicated the technical fire control teams in a battery to give operational resilience and tactical flexibility. Computers reduced the number of men needed and enabled decentralisation of technical fire control to autonomous sub-battery fire units such as platoons, troops or sections, although some armies had sometimes done this with their manual methods. Computation on the gun or launcher, integrated with their laying system, is also possible. [[MLRS]] led the way in this.

A '''fire unit''' is the smallest artillery or mortar element, consisting of one or more weapon systems, capable of being employed to execute a fire assigned by a tactical fire controller. Generally it is a battery, but sub-divided batteries are quite common, and in some armies very common. On occasions a battery of 6 guns has been 6 fire units. Fire units may or may not occupy separate positions. Geographically dispersed fire units may or may not have an integral capability for technical fire control.

'''Specialist services''' provide data need for predicted fire. Increasingly, they are provided from within firing units. These services include:
*Survey: accurate fixation and orientation of the guns, historically this involved specialists within field artillery units and specialist units. In some armies mapping and amp supply has also been an artillery responsibility. Survey is also essential for some target acquisition devices. Traditional survey methods of measurement and calculation have been replaced by inertial orientation and navigators and GPS.
*Meteorological data: historically these were usually divisional level specialist teams but advances in technology mean they are now increasingly part of artillery units.
*Calibration: periodically establishing the &quot;normal&quot; muzzle velocity of each gun as it wears. Originally this involved special facilities and army level teams. Measurement using Doppler radar, introduced in the 1950s, started to simplify arrangements. Some armies now have a muzzle velocity measuring radar permanently fitted to every gun.

'''Logistic services''', supply of artillery ammunition has always been a major component of military logistics. Up until World War I some armies made artillery responsible for all forward ammunition supply because the load of small arms ammunition was trivial compared to artillery. Different armies use different approaches to ammunition supply, which can vary with the nature of operations. Differences include where the logistic service transfers artillery ammunition to artillery, the amount of ammunition carried in units and extent to which stocks are held at unit or battery level. A key difference is whether supply is 'push' or 'pull'. In the former the 'pipeline' keeps pushing ammunition into formations or units at a defined rate. In the latter units fire as tactically necessary and replenish to maintain or reach their authorised holding (which can vary), so the logistic system has to be able to cope with surge and slack.

Artillery has always been equipment intensive and for centuries artillery provided its own artificers to maintain and repair their equipment. Most armies now place these services in specialist branches with specialist repair elements in batteries and units.

==Classification of artillery==
Artillery types can be categorised in several ways, for example by type or size of weapon or ordnance, by role or by organizational arrangements.

===Types of ordnance===
The types of cannon artillery are generally distinguished by the velocity at which they fire projectiles.
Types of artillery:
[[File:PzH2000.Ger.jpg|thumb|right|[[German Army]] [[PzH 2000]] self-propelled artillery]]
*[[Field artillery]]: mobile weapons used to support armies in the field. Subcategories include:
**[[infantry support gun]]s: directly support infantry units.
**[[mountain gun]]s: lightweight weapons that can be moved through difficult terrain.
**[[field gun]]s: capable of long range fire.
**[[howitzer]]s: capable of high angle fire, they are most often employed for [[indirect-fire]].
**[[gun howitzer]]s: capable of high or low angle fire with a long barrel.
**[[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]]: typically short-barreled, high-trajectory weapons designed primarily for an indirect-fire role.
**[[anti-tank artillery]]: weapons, usually mobile, designed for attacking tanks.
**[[anti-aircraft artillery]]: weapons, usually mobile, designed for attacking aircraft from the ground. Some guns were suitable for dual-role anti-aircraft and field (anti-tank) use. The World War II [[Germany|German]] [[88 mm gun]] was a famous example.
**[[rocket artillery]]: rocket-launched instead of shot or shell.
* Motorized artillery: towed by [[Artillery tractor]]s or [[Auxiliary power unit|APU]]-installed.
*[[Self-propelled artillery]]: typically guns, mortars or gun howitzers mounted on a vehicle.
*[[Railway gun]]: large-caliber weapons that are mounted on, transported by and fired from specially-designed railway wagons.
*[[Naval artillery]]: guns mounted on warships and used either against other ships or in support of ground forces. The crowning achievement of naval artillery was the [[battleship]], but the advent of airpower and missiles have rendered this type of artillery largely obsolete. They are typically longer-barreled, low-trajectory, high-velocity weapons designed primarily for a direct-fire role.
*[[Coastal artillery]]: Fixed-position weapons dedicated to defense of a particular location, usually a coast (for example, the [[Atlantic Wall]] in [[World War II|WW II]]) or harbor. Not needing to be mobile, coastal artillery used to be much larger than equivalent field artillery pieces, giving them longer range and more destructive power. Modern coastal artillery (for example,, Russia's &quot;Bereg&quot; system) is often self propelled, (allowing it to avoid counter-battery fire) and fully integrated, meaning that each battery has all of the support systems that it requires (maintenance, targeting radar, etc.) organic to its unit.

[[File:MuseeMarine-canonBronze-p1000434.jpg|thumb|Naval piece of artillery, early 19th century]]

Modern field artillery can also be split into two other categories: towed and self-propelled. As the name suggests, [[Field artillery|towed artillery]] has a prime mover, usually a [[jeep]] or [[truck]], to move the piece, crew, and ammunition around. Self-propelled howitzers are permanently mounted on a carriage or vehicle with room for the crew and ammunition and are thus capable of moving quickly from one firing position to another, both to support the fluid nature of modern combat and to avoid [[counter-battery fire]]. There are also mortar carrier vehicles, many of which allow the mortar to be removed from the vehicle and be used dismounted, potentially in terrain in which the vehicle cannot navigate, or in order to avoid detection.

===Types of use===

===Organizational types===

At the beginning of the modern artillery period, the late 19th century, many armies had three main types of artillery, in some case they were sub-branches within the artillery branch in others they were separate branches or corps. There were also other types excluding the armament fitted to warships:
*[[Horse artillery]], first formed as regular units in late 18th century, with the role of supporting cavalry, they were distinguished by the entire crew being mounted.
*[[Field artillery|Field or &quot;foot&quot; artillery]], the main artillery arm of the field army, using either guns, howitzers or mortars. In [[World War II]] this branch again started using [[rocket artillery|rockets]] and later surface to surface missiles.
*Fortress or garrison artillery, manned a nation's fixed defences using guns, howitzers or mortars, either on land or coastal frontiers. Some had deployable elements to provide heavy artillery to the field army. In some nations [[Coastal artillery|coast defence artillery]] was a naval responsibility.
*[[mountain gun|Mountain artillery]], a few nations treated mountain artillery as a separate branch, in others it was a speciality in another artillery branch. They used light guns or howitzers, usually designed for pack animal transport and easily broken down into small easily handled loads
*Naval artillery, some nations carried pack artillery on some warships, these were used and manhandled by naval (or marine) landing parties. At times, part of a ship's armament would be unshipped and mated to makeshift carriages and limbers for actions ashore, for example during the [[Second Boer War]], during the First World War the guns from the stricken [[SMS Königsberg (1905)|SMS ''Königsberg'']] formed the main artillery strength of the German forces in East Africa.
[[File:Tir.jpg|thumb|Firing of an 18-pound gun, [[Louis-Philippe Crepin]], (1772–1851)]]
After [[World War I]] many nations merged these different artillery branches, in some cases keeping some as sub-branches. Naval artillery disappeared apart from that belonging to marines. However, two new branches of artillery emerged during that war and its aftermath, both used specialised guns (and a few rockets) and used direct not [[indirect fire]], in the 1950s and '60s both started to make extensive use of missiles:
*Anti-tank artillery, also under various organisational arrangements but typically either field artillery or a specialist branch and additional elements integral to infantry, etc., units. However, in most armies field and anti-aircraft artillery also had at least a secondary anti-tank role. After World War II anti-tank in Western armies became mostly the responsibility of infantry and armoured branches and ceased to be an artillery matter, with some exceptions.
*[[Anti-aircraft artillery]], under various organisational arrangements including being part of artillery, a separate corps, even a separate service or being split between army for the field and airforce for home defence. In some cases infantry and the new armoured corps also operated their own integral light anti-aircraft artillery. Home defence anti-aircraft artillery often used fixed as well as mobile mountings. Some anti-aircraft guns could also be used as field or anti-tank artillery, providing they had suitable sights.

However, the general switch by artillery to [[indirect fire]] before and during [[World War I]] led to a reaction in some armies. The result was accompanying or infantry guns. These were usually small, short range guns, that could be easily man-handled and used mostly for direct fire but some could use indirect fire. Some were operated by the artillery branch but under command of the supported unit. In [[World War II]] they were joined by self-propelled assault guns, although other armies adopted infantry or close support tanks in armoured branch units for the same purpose, subsequently tanks generally took on the accompanying role.

===Equipment types===
[[File:Artillery gun crew-illustration.jpeg|right|thumb|Continental Artillery crew from the [[American Revolution]] handling a cannon.]]
The three main types of artillery 'gun' are guns, [[howitzers]] and [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]]. During the 20th century, guns and howitzers have steadily merged in artillery use, making a distinction between the terms somewhat meaningless. By the end of the 20th century, true guns with calibers larger than about 60&amp;nbsp;mm had become very rare in artillery use, the main users being tanks, ships, and a few residual anti-aircraft and coastal guns. The term &quot;cannon&quot; is a United States generic term that includes guns, howitzers and mortars, it is not used in other English speaking armies.

The traditional definitions differentiated between guns and howitzers in terms of maximum elevation (well less than 45° as opposed to close to or greater than 45°), number of charges (one or more than one charge), and having higher or lower muzzle velocity, sometimes indicated by barrel length. These three criteria give eight possible combinations, of which guns and howitzers are but two. However, modern 'howitzers' have higher velocities and longer barrels than the equivalent 'guns' of the first half of the 20th century.

True guns are characterised by long range, having a maximum elevation significantly less than 45°, a high muzzle velocity and hence a relatively long barrel, smooth bore (no rifling) and a single charge. The latter often led to fixed ammunition where the projectile is locked to the cartridge case. There is no generally accepted minimum muzzle velocity or barrel length associated with a gun. [[File:60 pounder Cape Helles June 1915.jpg|thumb|A British 60-pounder ({{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on}}) gun at full recoil, in action during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], 1915. Photo by [[Ernest Brooks (photographer)|Ernest Brooks]].]]

Howitzers can fire at maximum elevations at least close to 45°, and up to about 70° is normal for modern ones. They also have a choice of charges, meaning that the same elevation angle of fire will achieve a different range depending on the charge used. They have rifled bores, lower muzzle velocities and shorter barrels than equivalent guns. All this means they can deliver fire with a steep angle of descent. Because of their multi-charge capability, their ammunition is mostly separate loading (the projectile and propellant are loaded separately).

That leaves six combinations of the three criteria, some of which have been termed [[gun howitzers]]. A term first used in the 1930s when howitzers with a relatively high maximum muzzle velocities were introduced, it never became widely accepted, most armies electing to widen the definition of 'gun' or 'howitzer'. By the 1960s, most equipments had maximum elevations up to about 70°, were multi-charge, had quite high maximum muzzle velocities and relatively long barrels.

[[mortar (weapon)|Mortars]] are simple, the modern mortar originated in World War I and there were several patterns. After that war, most mortars settled on the Stokes pattern, characterised by a short barrel, smooth bore, low muzzle velocity, generally firing at an elevation angle greater than 45°, and a very simple and light mounting using a 'baseplate' on the ground. The projectile with its integral propelling charge was dropped down the barrel from the muzzle to hit a fixed firing pin. Since that time, a few mortars have become rifled and adopted breech loading.

There are other recognised typifying characteristics for artillery. First the type of obturation used to seal the chamber and prevent gases escaping through the breech. This may use a metal cartridge case that also holds the propelling charge, a configuration called 'QF' or 'quickfiring' by some nations. The alternative does not use a metal cartridge case, the propellant being merely bagged or in combustible cases with the breech itself providing all the sealing. This is called 'BL&quot; or 'breech loading' by some nations.

A second characteristic is the form of propulsion. Basically modern equipment can either be towed or self-propelled (SP). A towed gun fires from the ground and any inherent protection is limited to a gun shield. Towing by horse teams lasted throughout World War II in some armies, but others were fully mechanised with wheeled or tracked gun towing vehicles by the outbreak of that war. The size of a towing vehicle depends on the weight of the equipment and the amount of ammunition it has to carry.

A variation of towed is portee where the vehicle carries the gun which is dismounted for firing. Mortars are often carried this way. A mortar is sometimes carried in an armoured vehicle and can either fire from it or be dismounted to fire from the ground. Since the early 1960s it has been possible to carry lighter towed guns and most mortars by helicopter. Even before that, they were parachuted or landed by glider from the time of the first airborne trials in the USSR in the 1930s.

In an SP equipment, the gun is an integral part of the vehicle that carries it. SPs first appeared during World War I, but did not really develop until World War II. They are mostly tracked vehicles, but wheeled SPs started to appear in the 1970s. Some SPs have no armour and carry little or no ammunition. Armoured SPs usually carry a useful ammunition load. Early armoured SPs were mostly a 'casemate' configuration, in essence an open top armoured box offering only limited traverse. However, most modern armoured SPs have a full enclosed armoured turret, usually giving full traverse for the gun. Many SPs cannot fire without deploying stabilisers or spades, sometimes hydraulic. A few SPs are designed so that the recoil forces of the gun are transferred directly onto the ground through a baseplate. A few towed guns have been given limited self-propulsion by means of an auxiliary engine.

Two other forms of tactical propulsion were used in the first half of the 20th century: Railways or transporting the equipment by road, as two or three separate loads, with disassembly and re-assembly at the beginning and end of the journey. [[Railway gun|Railway artillery]] took two forms, railway mountings for heavy and super-heavy guns and howitzers and armoured trains as 'fighting vehicles' armed with light artillery in a direct fire role. Disassembled transport was also used with heavy and super heavy weapons and lasted into the 1950s.

===Caliber categories===
A third form of artillery typing is to classify it as 'light', 'medium', 'heavy' and various other terms. It appears to have been introduced in World War I, which spawned a very wide array of artillery in all sorts of sizes so a simple categorical system was needed. Some armies defined these categories by bands of calibers. Different bands were used for different types of weapons—field guns, mortars, anti-aircraft guns and coast guns.

Artillery is used in a variety of roles depending on its type and caliber. The general role of artillery is to provide ''fire support''—&quot;the application of fire, coordinated with the manoeuvre of forces to destroy, ''neutralize'' or ''suppress'' the enemy&quot;. This NATO definition, of course, makes artillery a supporting arm although not all NATO armies agree with this logic. The ''italicised'' terms are NATO's.&lt;ref&gt;AAP-6(2006) NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike rockets, guns (or howitzers as some armies still call them) and mortars are suitable for delivering ''close supporting fire''. However, they are all suitable for providing ''deep supporting fire'' although the limited range of many mortars tends to exclude them from the role. Their control arrangements and limited range also mean that mortars are most suited to ''direct supporting fire''. Guns are used either for this or ''general supporting fire'' while rockets are mostly used for the latter. However, lighter rockets may be used for direct fire support. These rules of thumb apply to NATO armies.

Modern [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]], because of their lighter weight and simpler, more transportable design, are usually an integral part of [[infantry]] and, in some armies, [[armor]] units. This means they generally do not have to ''concentrate'' their fire so their shorter range is not a disadvantage. Some armies also consider infantry operated mortars to be more responsive than artillery, but this is a function of the control arrangements and not the case in all armies. However, mortars have always been used by artillery units and remain with them in many armies, including a few in NATO.

In NATO armies artillery is usually assigned a tactical mission that establishes its relationship and responsibilities to the formation or units it is assigned to. It seems that not all NATO nations use the terms and outside NATO others are probably used. The standard terms are: ''direct support'', ''general support'', ''general support reinforcing'' and ''reinforcing''. These tactical missions are in the context of the command authority: ''operational command'', ''operational control'', ''tactical command'' or ''tactical control''.

In NATO direct support generally means that the directly supporting artillery unit provides observers and liaison to the manoeuvre troops being supported, typically an artillery battalion or equivalent is assigned to a brigade and its batteries to the brigade's battalions. However, some armies achieve this by placing the assigned artillery units under command of the directly supported formation. Nevertheless, the batteries' fire can be ''concentrated'' onto a single target, as can the fire of units in range and with the other tactical missions.

===Application of fire===
[[File:155fire.jpg|right|thumb|A 155&amp;nbsp;mm artillery shell fired by a United States [[11th Marine Regiment]] [[M198 howitzer|M-198]] [[howitzer]]]]
There are several dimensions to this subject. The first is the notion that fire may be against an ''opportunity'' target or may be ''prearranged''. If it is the latter it may be either ''on-call'' or ''scheduled''. Prearranged targets may be part of a ''fire plan''. Fire may be either ''observed'' or ''unobserved'', if the former it may be ''adjusted'', if the latter then it has to be ''[[predicted fire|predicted]]''. Observation of adjusted fire may be directly by a forward observer or indirectly via some other ''target acquisition'' system.

NATO also recognises several different types of fire support for tactical purposes:
*''[[Counterbattery fire]]'': delivered for the purpose of destroying or ''neutralizing'' the enemy's fire support system.
*''Counterpreparation fire'': intensive prearranged fire delivered when the imminence of the enemy attack is discovered.
*''Covering fire'': used to protect troops when they are within range of enemy small arms.
*''Defensive fire'': delivered by supporting units to assist and protect a unit engaged in a defensive action.
*''Final Protective Fire'': an immediately available prearranged barrier of fire designed to impede enemy movement across defensive lines or areas.
*''Harassing fire'': a random number of shells are fired at random intervals, without any pattern to it that the enemy can predict. This process is designed to hinder enemy forces' movement, and, by the constantly imposed stress, threat of losses and inability of enemy forces to relax or sleep, lowers their morale.
*''Interdiction fire'': placed on an area or point to prevent the enemy from using the area or point.
*''Preparation fire'': delivered before an attack to weaken the enemy position.

These purposes have existed for most of the 20th century, although their definitions have evolved and will continue to do so, lack of ''suppression'' in ''counterbattery'' is an omission. Broadly they can be defined as either:
*''Deep supporting fire'': directed at objectives not in the immediate vicinity of own force, for neutralizing or destroying enemy reserves and weapons, and interfering with enemy command, supply, communications and observation; or
*''Close supporting fire'': placed on enemy troops, weapons or positions which, because of their proximity present the most immediate and serious threat to the supported unit.
[[File:Gun5a.jpg|thumb|[[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[M-198]] firing outside of [[Fallujah]], [[Iraq]] in 2004]]
Two other NATO terms also need definition:
*''Neutralization fire'': delivered to render a target temporarily ineffective or unusable; and
*''Suppression fire'': that degrades the performance of a target below the level needed to fulfill its mission. Suppression is usually only effective for the duration of the fire.

The tactical purposes also include various &quot;mission verbs&quot;, a rapidly expanding subject with the modern concept of &quot;effects based operations&quot;.

''Targeting'' is the process of selecting target and matching the appropriate response to them taking account of operational requirements and capabilities. It requires consideration of the type of fire support required and the extent of coordination with the supported arm. It involves decisions about:
*what effects are required, for example, ''neutralization'' or ''suppression'';
*the proximity of and risks to own troops or non-combatants;
*what types of munitions, including their fuzing, are to be used and in what quantities;
*when the targets should be attacked and possibly for how long;
*what methods should be used, for example, ''converged'' or ''distributed'', whether adjustment is permissible or surprise essential, the need for special procedures such as precision or danger close
*how many fire units are needed and which ones they should be from those that are available (in range, with the required munitions type and quantity, not allotted to another target, have the most suitable line of fire if there is a risk to own troops or non-combatants);

The ''targeting'' process is the key aspect of tactical fire control. Depending on the circumstances and national procedures it may all be undertaken in one place or may be distributed. In armies practicing control from the front, most of the process may be undertaken by a forward observer or other target acquirer. This is particularly the case for a smaller target requiring only a few fire units. The extent to which the process is formal or informal and makes use of computer based systems, documented norms or experience and judgement also varies widely armies and other circumstances.

Surprise may be essential or irrelevant. It depends on what effects are required and whether or not the target is likely to move or quickly improve its protective posture. During World War II UK researchers concluded that for impact fuzed munitions the relative risk were as follows:
*men standing       – 1
*men lying         – 1/3
*men firing from trenches – 1/15–1/50
*men crouching in trenches – 1/25–1/100
Airburst munitions significantly increase the relative risk for lying men, etc. Historically most casualties occur in the first 10–15 seconds of fire, i.e. the time needed to react and improve protective posture, however, this is less relevant if airburst is used.

There are several ways of making best use of this brief window of maximum vulnerability:
*ordering the guns to fire together, either by executive order or by a &quot;fire at&quot; time. The disadvantage is that if the fire is ''concentrated'' from many dispersed ''fire units'' then there will be different times of flight and the first rounds will be spread in time. To some extent a large concentration offsets the problem because it may mean that only one round is required from each gun and most of these could arrive in the 15 second window.
*burst fire, a rate of fire to deliver three rounds from each gun within 10 or 15 seconds, this reduces the number of guns and hence fire units needed, which means they may be less dispersed and have less variation in their times of flight. Smaller caliber guns, such as 105&amp;nbsp;mm, have always been able to deliver three rounds in 15 seconds, larger calibers firing fixed rounds could also do it but it wasn't until the 1970s that a multi-charge 155&amp;nbsp;mm howitzer, [[FH-70]] first gained the capability.
*multiple round simultaneous impact (MRSI).
*''time on target'', fire units fire at the time less their time of flight, this works well with prearranged scheduled fire but is less satisfactory for opportunity targets because it means delaying the delivery of fire by selecting a 'safe' time that all or most fire units can achieve. It can be used with both the previous two methods.

===Counter-battery fire===
{{Main|Counter-battery fire}}
'''Counter-battery fire''' is a type of mission assigned to military artillery forces, which are tasked with locating and firing upon enemy artillery. Typically, enemy artillery would be detected when they fire, and a counter-battery fire mission must proceed as quickly as possible before the enemy [[artillery battery]] finishes their salvo and relocates.

Originally, counter-battery fire relied on ground or air-based artillery observers noticing the source of the artillery fire (due to muzzle flashes, smoke, spotting the artillery pieces, etc.) and calculating [[firing solution]]s to strike back at them. Artillery spotting, along with reconnaissance, was one of the major roles for aircraft in warfare (see [[World War I]]). Modern counter-battery fire relies on [[counter-battery radar]], which calculate the source of incoming artillery shells very accurately and quickly—so quickly, in fact, that return fire can sometimes begin before the first enemy [[shell (projectile)|shell]] or [[rocket]] has landed.

The development of fast and accurate counter-battery fire has led to the concept of [[shoot-and-scoot]] and concentration on the development of highly mobile artillery pieces (typically self-propelled guns like the [[United States|US]] [[M109 howitzer|M109 Paladin]], the [[South African]] [[G6 Howitzer]] or [[Soviet Army]] [[2S1|2S1 Gvozdika]], or [[rocket artillery]] like the Soviet [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] or the multi-national [[M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System|M270 MLRS]]). The idea is to fire and then move before any counter-battery fire can land on the original position.

The task of destroying enemy artillery batteries can also fall to [[attack aircraft]], but unless they are already on patrol overhead, they are usually not quick enough to save friendly forces from damage. More often, ground-based counter-battery fire would suppress the enemy battery/batteries and force them to move, while aircraft would follow up later with a strike to destroy the rest of the enemy artillery.

===Field artillery team===
{{Main|Field artillery team}}

Modern field artillery (post–[[World War I]]) has three distinct parts: the [[forward observer]] (or FO), the [[fire direction center]] (FDC) and the actual guns themselves. The forward observer observes the target using tools such as [[binoculars]], [[laser rangefinder]]s, designators and call back fire missions on his radio, or relays the data through a portable computer via an encrypted digital radio connection protected from jamming by computerized frequency hopping.

The FO can communicate directly with the battery FDC, of which there is one per each [[Artillery battery|battery]] of 4–8 guns. Otherwise the several FOs communicate with a higher FDC such as at a Battalion level, and the higher FDC prioritizes the targets and allocates fires to individual batteries as needed to engage the targets that are spotted by the FOs or to perform preplanned fires.

The Battery FDC computes firing data—ammunition to be used, powder charge, fuse settings, the direction to the target, and the quadrant elevation to be fired at to reach the target, what gun will fire any rounds needed for adjusting on the target, and the number of rounds to be fired on the target by each gun once the target has been accurately located—to the guns. Traditionally this data is relayed via radio or wire communications as a warning order to the guns, followed by orders specifying the type of ammunition and fuse setting, direction, and the elevation needed to reach the target, and the method of adjustment or orders for fire for effect (FFE). However in more advanced artillery units, this data is relayed through a digital radio link.

Other parts of the field artillery team include meteorological analysis to determine the temperature, humidity and pressure of the air and wind direction and speed at different altitudes. Also radar is used both for determining the location of enemy artillery and mortar batteries and to determine the precise actual strike points of rounds fired by battery and comparing that location with what was expected to compute a registration allowing future rounds to be fired with much greater accuracy.

===Time on Target===
A technique called Time on Target was developed by the U.S. Army during World War II. This technique uses a precise determination of the time of flight from each firing battery to the target area. When a Time on Target (TOT) is designated each battery that will join in firing on that target subtracts the time of flight from the TOT to determine the time to fire. Individual firing batteries train to fire their rounds as close to simultaneously as possible. When each firing battery fires their rounds at their individual time to fire every round will reach the target area nearly simultaneously. This is especially effective when combined with techniques that allow fires for effect to be made without preliminary adjusting fires.

A similar effect may be obtained by a single battery firing sequential rounds with different trajectories, with all rounds timed to arrive simultaneously.

===MRSI===
[[File:MRSI-trajectories.svg|thumb|Illustration of different trajectories used in MRSI: For any muzzle velocity there is a steeper (&gt; 45°, solid line) and a lower (&lt;45°, dashed line) trajectory. On these different trajectories, the shells have different flight times.]]
This is a modern version of the earlier &quot;time on target&quot; concept in which fire from different weapons was timed to arrive on target at the same time. It is possible for modern computer-controlled artillery to fire more than one volley at a target and have all the shells arrive simultaneously, which is called MRSI (Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact). This is because there is more than one trajectory for the rounds to fly to any given target: typically one is below 45 degrees from horizontal and the other is above it, and by varying the amount of propellant with each shell, it is possible to create multiple trajectories. Because the higher trajectories cause the shells to arc higher into the air, they take longer to reach the target and so if the shells are fired on these trajectories for the first volleys (starting with the shell with the most propellant and working down) and then after the correct pause more volleys are fired on the lower trajectories, the shells will all arrive at the same time. This is useful because many more shells can land on the target with no warning. With traditional volleys along the same trajectory, anybody at the target point will have a certain amount of time (however long it takes to reload and re-fire the guns) to run away or take cover between volleys. In addition, if guns in more than one location are firing on one target, with careful timing it can be arranged for all their shells to land at the same time for the same reason.

Examples of MRSI guns are [[South Africa]]'s [[Denel G6|Denel G6-52]] (which can land six rounds simultaneously at targets at least {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}} away), [[Germany]]'s [[PzH 2000 howitzer|Panzerhaubitze 2000]] (which can land five rounds simultaneously at targets at least {{convert|17|km|0|abbr=on}} away) and [[Slovakia]]'s [[155mm SpGH ZUZANA|155&amp;nbsp;mm SpGH ZUZANA model 2000]]. The [[ARCHER Artillery System|Archer project]] (Developed by BAE-Systems in Sweden), a 155&amp;nbsp;mm howitzer on a wheeled chassis claiming to be able to deliver up to 7 shells on target simultaneously from the same gun. The 120&amp;nbsp;mm twin barrel [[AMOS]] mortar system, developed in Finland, is capable of 7 + 7 shells MRSI. The [[United States]] [[XM2001 Crusader|Crusader]] program (now canceled) was slated to have MRSI capability.

Two-round MRSI firings were a popular artillery demonstration in the 1960s, where well trained crews could show off their skills for spectators.

===Air burst===
{{Main|Air burst}}
The destructiveness of artillery bombardments can be enhanced when some or all of the shells are set for airburst, meaning that they explode in the air above the target instead of upon impact. This can be accomplished either through time [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]]s or [[proximity fuse]]s. Time fuses use a precise timer to detonate the shell after a preset delay. This technique is tricky and slight variations in the functioning of the fuse can cause it to explode too high and be ineffective, or to strike the ground instead of exploding above it. Since December 1944 ([[Battle of the Bulge]]), proximity fuzed artillery shells have been available that take the guesswork out of this process. These embody a miniature, low powered [[radar]] transmitter in the fuse to detect the ground and explode them at a predetermined height above it. The return of the weak radar signal completes an electrical circuit in the fuze which explodes the shell. The proximity fuse itself was developed by the British to increase the effectiveness of [[anti-aircraft warfare]].

This is a very effective tactic against infantry and light vehicles, because it scatters the [[fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] of the shell over a larger area and prevents it from being blocked by terrain or entrenchments that do not include some form of robust overhead cover. Combined with TOT or MRSI tactics that give no warning of the incoming rounds, these rounds are especially devastating because many enemy soldiers are likely to be caught in the open. This is even more so if the attack is launched against an assembly area or troops moving in the open rather than a unit in an entrenched tactical position.

'''Arnulf of Carinthia''' (850 – December 8, 899) was the [[Carolingian]] [[King of Germany|King of East Francia]]&lt;ref&gt;East Francia had been split from the rest of [[Frankish Realm]] by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843. It evolved into [[Germany]] after the Carolingian eclipse.&lt;/ref&gt; from 887, the disputed [[King of Italy]] from 894 and the disputed [[Holy Roman Emperor]] from February 22, 896 until his death.

==Career==
===Birth and Illegitimacy===
Arnulf was, according to most sources,&lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg. 78&quot;&gt;Comyn, pg. 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann III, pg. 376&quot;&gt;Mann III, pg. 376&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryce, pg. 79&quot;&gt;Bryce, pg. 79&lt;/ref&gt; the illegitimate son of [[Carloman, King of Bavaria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 222&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 222&lt;/ref&gt; and his concubine Liutswind,&lt;ref&gt;Also Litwinde or Litwindie&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps of [[Carantanians|Carantanian]] origin, and possibly the sister of Ernst, Count of the Bavarian [[Nordgau (Bavaria)|Nordgau Margraviate]] in the area of the [[Upper Palatinate]], or perhaps the burgrave of [[Passau]], as some sources say. After Arnulf's birth, Carloman married, before 861, a daughter of that same Count Ernst, who died after August 8, 879. As it is mainly West-Franconian historiography &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mittelalter-genealogie.de/mittelalter/koenige/frankenreich/karlmann_ostfraenkischer_koenig_880.html Konecny Silvia: ''Die Frauen des karolingischen Königshauses. Die politische Bedeutung der Ehe und die Stellung der Frau in der fränkischen Herrscherfamilie vom 7. bis zum 10. Jahrhundert.'' PhD thesis Vienna 1976, p. 139]&lt;/ref&gt; that speaks of Arnulf's illegitimacy,  it is quite feasible that the two females are one and the same person and that Carloman later on actually married Liutswind, thus legitimizing his son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mittelalter-genealogie.de/karolinger_ostfraenkische_linie/luitswinda_mutter_kaiser_arnulfs_891.html Mediaeval Genealogy: Liutswind:] Various theories about her descent and her relation to Carloman (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Years===
Arnulf was granted the [[Duchy of Carinthia]], a Frankish vassal state and successor of the ancient [[Carantania|Principality of Carantania]], by his father [[Carloman of Bavaria|Carloman]], after Carloman had become reconciled with his own father [[Louis the German]] and was created [[King of Bavaria]]. Arnulf spent his childhood on the ''Mosaburch'' or Mosapurc, which is widely believed to be [[Moosburg, Austria|Moosburg]] in Carinthia, only a few miles away from one of the imperial residences, the Carlovingian [[Kaiserpfalz]]  at [[Zollfeld|Karnburg]], which before as ''Krnski grad'' had been the residence of the Carantanian princes. Arnulf kept his seat here and from later events it may be inferred that the Carantanians, from an early time, treated him as their own Duke. Later, after he had been crowned King of East Francia, Arnulf turned his old territory of Carinthia into the [[March of Carinthia]], a part of the [[Duchy of Bavaria]].

After Carloman was incapacitated by a stroke in 879, [[Louis the Younger]] inherited Bavaria, [[Charles the Fat]] was given the [[Kingdom of Italy (Medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] and Arnulf was confirmed in Carinthia by an agreement with Carloman. Bavaria, however, was ruled more or less by Arnulf.&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, Timothy (trans.) The Annals of Fulda. (Manchester Medieval series, Ninth-Century Histories, Volume II.) Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1992. 882 (p. 104 and n3)&lt;/ref&gt; Arnulf had in fact ruled Bavaria during the summer and autumn of 879 while his father arranged his succession and he himself was granted &quot;Pannonia,&quot; in the words of the ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, Timothy (trans.) The Annals of Fulda. (Manchester Medieval series, Ninth-Century Histories, Volume II.) Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1992. 884 (pp 108&amp;ndash;111)&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;Carantanum,&quot; in the words of [[Regino of Prüm]].&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, Simon. Kingship and Politics in the Late Ninth Century: Charles the Fat and the end of the Carolingian Empire. Cambridge University Press: 2003. pg. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The division of the realm was confirmed in 880 on Carloman’s death. 

When, in 882, [[Engelschalk II]] rebelled against the [[March of Pannonia|Margrave of Pannonia]], [[Aribo of Austria|Aribo]], and ignited the so-called [[Wilhelminer War]], Arnulf supported him and even accepted his and his brother's homage. This ruined Arnulf's relationship with his uncle the emperor and put him at war with [[Svatopluk of Moravia]]. [[Pannonia]] was invaded, but Arnulf refused to give up the young Wilhelminers. Arnulf did not make peace with Svatopluk until late 885, by which time the Moravian was a man of the emperor. Some scholars see this war as destroying Arnulf's hopes at succeeding Charles.

===King of East Francia===
Arnulf took the leading role in the deposition of his uncle, the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Charles the Fat]]. With the support of the nobles, Arnulf held a [[diet (assembly)|Diet]] at [[Trebur|Tribur]] and deposed Charles in November 887, under threat of military action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg. 78&quot;&gt;Comyn, pg. 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann III, pg. 376&quot;/&gt;  Charles peacefully went into his involuntary retirement, but not without first chastising his nephew for his treachery and asking only for a few royal villas in [[Swabia]], which Arnulf mercifully granted him,&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; on which to live out his final months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 222&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 222&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf, having distinguished himself in the war against the [[Slavs]] was elected by the nobles of the realm (only the eastern realm, though Charles had ruled the whole of the Frankish lands) and assumed his title of [[List of Frankish Kings|King of East Francia]].&lt;ref&gt;Comyn, pg. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnulf took advantage of the problems in [[West Francia]] upon the death of Charles The Fat to secure the territory of [[Lotharingia|Lorraine]], which he converted into a kingdom for his son, [[Zwentibold]].&lt;ref&gt;Comyn, pg. 82&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, in 889, Arnulf supported the claim of [[Louis the Blind]] to the kingdom of [[Provence]], after receiving a personal appeal from Louis’ mother, [[Ermengard of Provence|Ermengard]], who came to see Arnulf at [[Forchheim]] in May 889.&lt;ref&gt;Mann III, pg. 382&lt;/ref&gt;  Recognising the superiority of Arnulf’s position, in 888 [[Odo of France]] formally admitted the suzerainty of Arnulf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryce, pg. xxxv&quot;&gt;Bryce, pg. xxxv&lt;/ref&gt;  In 893, Arnulf switched his support from Odo to [[Charles the Simple]] after being persuaded by [[Fulk (Archbishop of Reims)]] that it was in his best interests.&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf then took advantage of the fighting that followed between Odo and Charles in 894, taking territory from West Francia and transferring it to his dominion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 56&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  At one point, Charles was forced to flee to Arnulf and ask for his protection.&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  His intervention forced [[Pope Formosus]] to get involved, as he was worried that a divided and war weary West Francia would be easy prey for the Normans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 56&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

In 895, Arnulf summoned both Charles and Odo to his presence at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. Charles’s advisers convinced him not to go, and he sent a representative in his place. Odo, on the other hand, personally attended, together with a large retinue, bearing many gifts for Arnulf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 26&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  Angered by the non-appearance of Charles, he welcomed Odo at the Diet of Worms in May 895, and again supported Odo's claim to the West Francian throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 26&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  In this same assembly, he bestowed upon his illegitimate son [[Zwentibold]], a crown as the King of Lotharingia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 26&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnulf was not a negotiator, but a fighter. In 890 he was successfully battling the Slavs in Pannonia.&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt; In 891, the Danes invaded [[Lotharingia]],&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and crushed a East Frankish army at [[Maastricht]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 20&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  At the decisive [[Battle of Leuven]] in September 891, he defeated an invading force of the Northmen, or [[Vikings]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 20&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt; essentially ending their invasions on that front.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 222&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 222&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'' report that the bodies of dead Northmen blocked the run of the river. After his victory, Arnulf built a new [[castle]] on an island in the [[Dijle]] river (Dutch: Dijle, English and French: Dyle).&lt;ref&gt;[[Latin]] ''Luvanium'', local ''Lovon''.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 880, Arnulf had designs on [[Great Moravia]], and had the Frankish bishop [[Wiching]] of [[Nitra]] interfere with the missionary activities of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Methodius]], with the aim of preventing any potential for creating a unified Moravian nation.&lt;ref&gt;Mann III, pg. 243&lt;/ref&gt;  In 893 or 894, Great Moravia probably lost a part of its territory &amp;mdash; present-day Western [[Hungary]] &amp;mdash; to him.  As a reward, Wiching became Arnulf’s [[chancellor]] in 892.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, III, pg. 244&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf, however, failed to conquer the whole of Great Moravia when he attempted it in 892, 893, and 899. Yet Arnulf did achieve some successes, in particular in 895, when [[Bohemia]] broke away from Great Moravia and became his vassal. An accord was made between him and the [[Duke of Bohemia|Bohemian Duke]] [[Borivoj I of Bohemia|Borivoj I]] (reigned 870-95); Bohemia was thus freed from the dangers of invasion. However, in his attempts to conquer Moravia, in 899 Arnulf invited across the [[Magyars]] who had settled in [[Pannonia]], and with their help he imposed a measure of control on Moravia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg. 83&quot;&gt;Comyn, pg. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  While Arnulf remained alive, the Magyars refrained from any overt acts of pillage, but with Arnulf’s death, they proceeded to invade [[Italy]] in 900.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg. 83&quot;&gt;Comyn, pg. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all early Germanic rulers, he was heavily involved in [[ecclesiastical]] disputes; in 895, at the Diet of Tribur, he presided over a dispute between the [[Episcopal see]]s of [[Bremen]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Cologne]] over jurisdictional authority, which saw Bremen and Hamburg remain a combined see, independent of the see of Cologne.&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

===King of Italy and Holy Roman Emperor===
In Italy, the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] of [[Lombardy]] was being fought over between [[Guy III of Spoleto]] and [[Berengar of Friuli]]. Berengar had been crowned king in 887, but Guy was in his turn crowned in 889. While [[Pope Stephen V]] supported Guy, crowning him [[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor]] in 891, Arnulf threw his support behind Berengar.&lt;ref&gt;Mann III, pg. 378&lt;/ref&gt;

In 893, a new pope, [[Pope Formosus|Formosus]], not trusting the newly crowned co-emperors [[Guy III of Spoleto|Guy]] and [[Lambert II of Spoleto|Lambert]], sent an embassy to Omuntesberch, where Arnulf was holding a Diet with Svatopluk,&lt;ref&gt;Mann III, pg. 379&lt;/ref&gt; to request Arnulf come and liberate [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 50&lt;/ref&gt; where he would be crowned in [[Rome]]. Arnulf met the ''Primores'' of the Kingdom of Italy, dismissed them with gifts and promised to enter Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 51&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf sent his son [[Zwentibold]] with a Bavarian army to join [[Berengar of Friuli]]. They defeated Guy, but were bought off and left in autumn. Arnulf then personally led an army across the [[Alps]] early in 894. In January 894 [[Bergamo]] fell, and Count Ambrose, Guy’s representative in the city, was hung from a tree by the city’s gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 22&quot;/&gt;  Conquering all of the territory north of the [[Po River|Po]], he forced the surrender of [[Milan]] and then drove Guy out of [[Pavia]], where he was crowned [[King of Italy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryce, pg. xxxv&quot;/&gt; but went no further before Guy died suddenly in late autumn, and fever incapacitated his troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 51&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt;  
His march northward through the [[Alps]] was interrupted by Rudolph, king of Transjurane Burgundy, and it was only with great difficulty that Arnulf crossed the mountain range.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 22&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  In retaliation, Arnulf ordered his illegitimate son [[Zwentibold]] to ravage [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 22&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  In the meantime, Lambert and his mother [[Ageltrude]] travelled to Rome to receive papal confirmation of his imperial succession, but Formosus, still desiring to crown Arnulf, was imprisoned in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]].

In September 895, a new embassy arrived in [[Regensburg]] beseeching Arnulf's aid. In October, Arnulf undertook his second campaign into Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 51&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt;  He crossed the Alps quickly and took [[Pavia]], but then he continued slowly, garnering support among the nobility of [[Tuscany]]. First [[Maginulf, Count of Milan]], and then [[Walfred, Count of Pavia]], joined him. Eventually even the [[Adalbert II of Tuscany|Margrave Adalbert II]] abandoned Lambert. Finding Rome locked against him and held by Ageltrude,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 51&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt; he had to take the city by force on 21 February 896, freeing the pope.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 52&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf was greeted at the [[Ponte Milvio]] by the [[Roman Senate]] who escorted him into the [[Leonine City]], where he was received by Pope Formosus on the steps of the [[Church of the Holy Apostles|Santi Apostoli]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 52&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 22, 896, Formosus led the king into the church, anointed and crowned him, and saluted him as ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of Fulda'', an. 896&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf then proceeded to the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], where he received the homage of the Roman people,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 52&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 52&lt;/ref&gt; who swore “never to hand over the city to Lambert or his mother Ageltrude”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 53&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf then proceeded to exile to Bavaria two leading senators, Constantine and Stephen, who had helped Ageltrude seize the city.&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Leaving one of his vassals, Farold, to hold Rome, Arnulf marched on [[Spoleto]], where Ageltrude had fled to join Lambert.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 53&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  On his way down, Arnulf suffered a stroke, forcing him to call off his campaign and return to Bavaria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 222&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnulf only retained power in Italy as long as he was personally there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryce, pg. 79&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 80&lt;/ref&gt;  On his way north, he stopped at [[Pavia]] where he crowned his illegitimate son [[Ratold of Italy|Ratold]], sub-[[King of Italy]], after which he left Ratold in [[Milan]] in an attempt to preserve his hold on Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 30&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt;  That same year, Formosus died, leaving Lambert once again in power, and both he and Berengar killed any officials who had been put in place by Arnulf, as Ratold also fled from Milan to Bavaria.&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 81&lt;/ref&gt;  Rumours of the time made Arnulf's condition to be a result of poisoning at the hand of Ageltrude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 53&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  On his return to Germany, he exercised very little further control in Italy for the rest of his life, although his agents in Rome did not prevent the accession of [[Pope Stephen VI]] in 896.&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Although he eventually became a supporter of the claims of Lambert, he initially gave his support to Arnulf.&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 84 – Silver coins from the pontificate of Stephen VI show the transition from Arnulf (“Arnolfvs Imp. Roma”) to Lambert (“Lamverto Imp. Roma”)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final Years===
With his return to Germany in 896, Arnulf found that his physical ill health meant he was unable to deal with the problems besetting his reign. Italy was lost,&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 30&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt; raiders from Moravia and [[Hungary]] were continually raiding his lands, and Lotharingia was in revolt against Zwentibold.&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also plagued by escalating violence and power struggles between the lower German nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

On Arnulf's death in 899, he was succeeded as a king of the East Franks by his son by his wife [[Ota, wife of Arnulf of Carinthia|Ota]] (died 903), [[Louis the Child]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf had the nobility also recognise the rights of his illegitimate sons [[Zwentibold]] and Ratold as his successors. Zwentibold, whom he had made [[King of Lotharingia]] in 895, continued to rule there until the next year (900).

He is entombed in [[St. Emmeram's Abbey|St. Emmeram's Basilica]] at [[Ratisbon]], which is now known as Schloss Thurn und Taxis, the palace of the Princes of [[Thurn and Taxis]].

[[File:Stadtviertel in Berlin-Mitte.png|thumb|250px|Neighborhoods in [[Berlin-Mitte]]: [[Cölln|Old Cölln]] [1] (with [[Museum Island]] [1a], [[Fischer Island]] [1b]), [[Altberlin]] [2] (with [[Nikolaiviertel]] [2a]), [[Friedrichswerder]] [3], [[Neukölln am Wasser]] [4], [[Dorotheenstadt]] [5], [[Friedrichstadt (Berlin)|Friedrichstadt]] [6], [[Luisenstadt]] [7], [[Stralauer Vorstadt]] (with [[Königsstadt]]) [8], Alexanderplatz Area (Königsstadt and Altberlin) [9], [[Spandauer Vorstadt]] [10] (with [[Scheunenviertel]] [10a]), [[Friedrich-Wilhelm-Stadt]] [11], [[Oranienburger Vorstadt]] [12], [[Rosenthaler Vorstadt]] [13] ]]
'''Alexanderplatz''' ({{IPA-de|ʔalɛkˈsandɐˌplats|pron|De-Alexanderplatz.ogg}}) is a large [[Town square|public square]] and transport hub in the central [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]] district of [[Berlin]], near the [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]]. Berliners often call it simply ''Alex'', referring to a larger neighborhood stretching from ''Mollstraße'' in the northeast to ''Spandauer Straße'' and the [[Rotes Rathaus|City Hall]] in the southwest. 

==History==
[[File:Alexanderplatz 1796.jpg|thumb|left|Alexanderplatz in 1796]]
===Early history===
Originally a cattle market outside the city fortifications, it was named in honor of a visit of the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] to Berlin on 25 October 1805 by order of King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]]. The square gained a prominent role in the late 19th century with the construction of the [[Berlin Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn]] station of the same name and a nearby market hall, followed by the opening of a department store of [[Hermann Tietz]] in 1904, becoming a major commercial center. The [[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] station of the present-day [[U2 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U2]] line opened on 1 July 1913.

Its heyday was in the 1920s, when together with [[Potsdamer Platz]] it was at the heart of Berlin's [[Nightlife (activity)|nightlife]], inspiring the 1929 [[novel]] ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'' (see [[1920s Berlin]]) and the two [[film]]s based thereon, Piel Jutzi's 1931 film and [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]'s 15½ hour [[Berlin Alexanderplatz (television)|second adaptation]], released in 1980. About 1920 the city's authorities started a rearrangement of the increasing traffic flows laying out a roundabout, accompanied by two buildings along the Stadtbahn viaduct, ''Alexanderhaus'' and ''Berolinahaus'' finished in 1932 according to plans designed by [[Peter Behrens]].

===East Germany===
Alexanderplatz has been subject to redevelopment several times in its history, most recently during the 1960s, when it was turned into a pedestrian zone and enlarged as part of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]'s redevelopment of the city center. It is surrounded by several notable structures including the [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV Tower), the second tallest structure in [[Europe]]. Because of its high profile, many newcomers to Berlin mistake the nickname ''Alex'' and apply it to the Fernsehturm instead. ''Alex'' also accommodates the [[Park Inn Berlin]] and the [[World clock|World Time Clock]], a continually rotating installation that shows the time throughout the globe, and [[Hermann Henselmann]]'s ''Haus des Lehrers''. During the [[Peaceful Revolution]] of 1989, the [[Alexanderplatz demonstration]] on 4 November was the largest demonstration in the history of East Germany.
[[File:BVG KT4D mod.JPG|thumb|left|Tram passing the World Clock]]
===After German reunification===
Since [[German reunification]], Alexanderplatz has undergone a gradual process of change with many of the surrounding buildings being renovated. Despite the reconstruction of the [[Berlin Straßenbahn|tram]] line crossing, it has retained its socialist character, including the much-[[graffiti]]ed &quot;Fountain of Friendship between Peoples&quot; (''Brunnen der Völkerfreundschaft''), a popular venue. In 1993 plans for a major redevelopment including the construction of several skyscrapers were published, but due to a lack of demand it is unlikely these will be constructed. However, beginning with the reconstruction of the ''[[Metro AG|Kaufhof]]'' department store in 2004, and the biggest underground railway station of Berlin, some buildings will be redesigned and new structures built on the square's south-eastern side.  The ''Alexa'' shopping mall, with approximately 180 stores opened nearby during 2007 and a large ''Saturn'' electronic store was built and is open on Alexanderplatz since 2008.

Many historic buildings are located in the vicinity of Alexanderplatz. The traditional seat of city government, the [[Rotes Rathaus]], or ''Red City Hall'',  is located nearby, as was the former East German parliament building, the [[Palast der Republik]], demolition of which began in February 2006 and has been completed. The reconstruction of the Baroque [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|Stadtschloss]] at the site has been in planning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,594515,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexanderplatz is also the name of the [[Berlin Alexanderplatz railway station|S-Bahn]] and [[Alexanderplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|U-Bahn]] stations there.

&lt;/ref&gt; The bank admits the members of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] (UNESCAP, formerly known as the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East) and non-regional [[Developed country|developed countries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ming Wan&quot; /&gt; From 31 members at its establishment, ADB now has 67 members - of which 48 are from within Asia and the Pacific and 19 outside. ADB was modeled closely on the [[World Bank]], and has a similar weighted voting system where votes are distributed in proportion with member's capital subscriptions. At present, both the [[United States]] and [[Japan]] hold 552,210 shares, the largest proportion of shares at 12.756% each.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Development Bank (2008). Membership.

==Organization==
[[File:Asian Development Bank headquarters.jpg|300px|thumb|right|ADB Headquarters, Metro Manila]]

The highest policy-making body of the bank is the ''Board of Governors'' composed of one representative from each member state. The Board of Governors, in turn, elect among themselves the 12 members of the ''Board of Directors'' and their deputy. Eight of the 12 members come from regional (Asia-Pacific) members while the others come from non-regional members.

The Board of Governors also elect the bank's ''President'' who is the chairperson of the Board of Directors and manages ADB. The president has a term of office lasting five years, and may be reelected. Traditionally, and because [[Japan]] is one of the largest shareholders of the bank, the President has always been Japanese. The current President is Haruhiko Kuroda, who succeeded [[Tadao Chino]] in 2005.

The headquarters of the bank is at 6 ADB Avenue, [[Mandaluyong City]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]], and it has representative offices around the world. The bank employs approximately 2,400 people, coming from 55 of its 67 member countries, and with more than half of the staff being [[Filipino people|Filipino]].

==History==
===1962-1972===
ADB was originally conceived by some influential Japanese who formulated a &quot;private plan&quot; for a regional development bank in 1962, which was later endorsed by the government. The Japanese felt that its interest in Asia was not served by the World Bank and wanted to establish a bank in which Japan was institutionally advantaged. Once the ADB was founded in 1966, Japan took a prominent position in the bank; it received the presidency and some other crucial &quot;reserve positions&quot; such as the director of the administration department. By the end of 1972, Japan contributed $173.7 million (22.6% of the total) to the ordinary capital resources and $122.6 million (59.6% of the total) to the special funds. In contrast, the United States contributed only $1.25 million for the special fund.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ming Wan&quot; /&gt;

The ADB served Japan's economic interests because its loans went largely to [[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[South Korea]] and the [[Philippines]], the countries with which Japan had crucial trading ties; these nations accounted for 78.48% of the total ADB loans in 1967-72. Moreover, Japan received tangible benefits, 41.67% of the total procurements in 1967-76. Japan tied its special funds contributions to its preferred sectors and regions and procurements of its goods and services, as reflected in its $100 million donation for the Agricultural Special Fund in April 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ming Wan&quot; /&gt;

[[Takeshi Watanabe (bureaucrat)|Takeshi Watanabe]] served as the first ADB president from 1966 to 1972.

===1972-1986===
Japan's share of cumulative contributions increased from 30.4 percent in 1972 to 35.5 percent in 1981 and 41.9 percent in 1986. In addition, Japan was a crucial source of ADB borrowing, 29.4 percent (out of $6,729.1 million) in 1973-86, compared to 45.1 percent from Europe and 12.9 percent from the United States. Japanese presidents Inoue Shiro (1972–76) and Yoshida Taroichi (1976–81) took the spotlight. Fujioka Masao, the fourth president (1981–90), adopted an assertive leadership style. He announced an ambitious plan to expand the ADB into a high-impact development agency. His plan and banking philosophy led to increasing friction with the U.S. directors, with open criticism from the Americans at the 1985 annual meeting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ming Wan&quot; /&gt;

During this period there was a strong parallel institutional tie between the ADB and the Japanese Ministry of Finance, particularly the International Finance Bureau (IFB).

===Since 1986===
Its share of cumulative contributions increased from 41.9 percent in 1986 to 50.0 per- cent in 1993. In addition, Japan has been a crucial lender to the ADB, 30.4 percent of the total in 1987-93, compared to 39.8 percent from Europe and 11.7 percent from the United States. However, different from the previous period, Japan has become more assertive since the mid 1980s. Japan's plan was to use the ADB as a conduit for recycling its huge surplus capital and a &quot;catalyst&quot; for attracting private Japanese capital to the region. After the 1985 [[Plaza Accord]], Japanese manufacturers were pushed by high yen to move to Southeast Asia. The ADB played a role in channeling Japanese private capital to Asia by improving local infrastructure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ming Wan&quot; /&gt;
The ADB also committed itself to increasing loans for social issues such as education, health and population, urban development and environment, to 40 percent of its total loans from around 30 percent at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ming Wan&quot; /&gt;

==Lending==
The ADB offers &quot;hard&quot; loans from ordinary capital resources (OCR) on commercial terms, and the Asian Development Fund (ADF) affiliated with the ADB extends &quot;soft&quot; loans from special fund resources with concessional conditions. For OCR, members subscribe capital, including paid-in and callable elements, a 50 percent paid-in ratio for the initial subscription, 5 percent for the Third General Capital Increase (GCI) in 1983 and 2 percent for the Fourth General Capital Increase in 1994. The ADB borrows from international capital markets with its capital as guarantee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ming Wan&quot; /&gt;

In 2009, ADB obtained member-contributions for its Fifth General Capital Increase of 200%, in response to a call by [[G20]] leaders to increase resources of multilateral development banks so as to support growth in developing countries amid the global financial crisis. For 2010 and 2011, a 200% GCI allows lending of $12.5-13.0 billion in 2010 and about $11.0 billion in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB-GCI&quot;&gt;

Given ADB's annual lending volume, the return on investment in lesson learning for operational and developmental impact is likely to be high and maximizing it is a legitimate concern. All projects funded by ADB are evaluated to find out what results are being achieved, what improvements should be considered, and what is being learned.

There are two types of evaluation: independent and self-evaluation. Self-evaluation is conducted by the units responsible for designing and implementing country strategies, programs, projects, or technical assistance activities. It comprises several instruments, including project/program performance reports, midterm review reports, technical assistance or project/program completion reports, and country portfolio reviews. All projects are self-evaluated by the relevant units in a project completion report. ADB’s project completion reports are publicly disclosed on ADB’s Internet site. Client governments are also required to prepare their own project completion reports.

Independent evaluation is a foundation block of organizational learning: it is essential to transfer increased amounts of relevant and high-quality knowledge from experience into the hands of policy makers, designers, and implementers. ADB’s Operations Evaluation Department (OED) conducts systematic and impartial assessment of policies, strategies, country programs, and projects, including their design, implementation, results, and associated business processes to determine their relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability following prescribed methods and guidelines,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/evaluation/about/methods.asp How ADB Evaluates its Policies &amp; Operations - ADB.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It also validates self-evaluations. By this process of evaluation, ADB demonstrates three elements of [[good governance]]: (i) accountability, by assessing the effectiveness of ADB's operations; (ii) transparency, by independently reviewing operations and publicly reporting findings and recommendations; and (iii) improved performance, by helping ADB and its clients learn from past experience to enhance ongoing and future operations.

Operations evaluation has changed from the beginnings of evaluation in ADB in 1978. Initially, the focus was on assessing after completion the extent to which projects had achieved their expected economic and social benefits. Operations evaluation now shapes decision making throughout the project cycle and in ADB as a whole. Since the establishment of its independence in 2004, OED reports directly to ADB’s Board of Directors through the Board's Development Effectiveness Committee. Behavioral autonomy, avoidance of conflicts of interest, insulation from external influence, and organizational independence have made evaluation a dedicated tool—governed by the principles of usefulness, credibility, transparency, and independence—for greater accountability and making development assistance work better. ''Independent Evaluation at the Asian Development Bank'' presents a perspective of evaluation in ADB from the beginnings and looks to a future in which knowledge management plays an increasingly important role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/documents/books/independent-evaluation/independent-evaluation-ADB.asp Independent Evaluation at the Asian Development Bank - ADB.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, there has been a major shift in the nature of OED’s work program from a dominance of evaluations of individual projects to one focusing on broader and more strategic studies. To select priority topics for evaluation studies, OED seeks input from the Development Effectiveness Committee, ADB Management, and the heads of ADB departments and offices. The current thrusts are to: (i) improve the quality of evaluations by using more robust methodologies; (iii) give priority to country/sector assistance program evaluations; (iv) increase the number of joint evaluations; (v) validate self-evaluations to shorten the learning cycle; (vi) conduct more rigorous impact evaluations; (vii) develop evaluation capacity, both in ADB and in DMCs; (viii) promote portfolio performance; (ix) evaluate business processes; and (x) disseminate findings and recommendations and ensure their use. OED's work program has also been reinterpreted to emphasize organizational learning in a more clearly defined results architecture and results framework. It entails (i) conducting and disseminating strategic evaluations (in consultation with stakeholders),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/evaluation/reports/default.asp Resources - Independent Evaluation at the Asian Development Bank&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (ii) harmonizing performance indicators and evaluation methodologies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/evaluation/harmonization.asp Harmonization Work - Evaluation at Asian Development Bank (ADB) - ADB.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and (iii) developing capacity in evaluation and evaluative thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/evaluation/technical-assistance/default.asp Evaluation Capacity Development in ADB's Developing Member Countries&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; All evaluation studies are publicly disclosed on OED's website (some evaluations of private sector operations are redacted to protect commercially confidential information).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/Evaluation/default.asp Independent Evaluation at the Asian Development Bank - ADB.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; OED's evaluation resources are displayed by resource type, topic, region and country, and date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/evaluation/reports-type.asp Evaluation Reports - ADB.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Learnings are also gathered in an online ''Evaluation Information System'' offering a database of lessons, recommendations, and ADB Management responses to these.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evis.adb.org ADB Evaluation Information System&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Details of ongoing evaluations and updates on their progress are made public too.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/evaluation/ongoing.asp Ongoing Evaluations of ADB Policies &amp; Operation in Asia &amp; the Pacific - ADB.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning 2006, acting within the knowledge management framework of ADB, OED has applied knowledge management to lesson learning, using knowledge performance metrics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/evaluation/linking-to-results/linking-to-results.pdf Linking to Results&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
''Learning Lessons in ADB'' sets the strategic framework for knowledge management in operations evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/documents/reports/learning-lessons-adb/strategic-framework-2007-2009.asp Learning Lessons in ADB: Strategic Framework, 2007-2009 - ADB.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements have been made that hold promise not only in OED but, more importantly, vis-à-vis its interfaces with other departments and offices in ADB, developing member countries, and the international evaluation community. In the medium term, OED will continue to improve the organizational culture, management system, business processes, information technology solutions, community of practice, and external relations and networking for lesson learning. Among the new knowledge products and services developed, ''Learning Curves'' are handy, two-paged quick references designed to feed findings and recommendations from evaluation to a broader range of clients&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/evaluation/reports.asp?s=1&amp;type=15 Evaluation Reports - ADB.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Evaluation News'' report on events in monitoring and evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/evaluation/reports.asp?s=1&amp;type=20 Evaluation Reports - ADB.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Evaluation Presentations'' offer short photographic or Powerpoint displays on evaluation topics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/Evaluation/evaluation-presentations.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Auditing the Lessons Architecture'' highlights the contribution that knowledge audits can make to organizational learning and organizational health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/documents/studies/auditing-lessons-architecture/in371-07.asp Auditing the Lessons Architecture - ADB.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 1,106 ADB-funded projects evaluated and rated so far (as of December 2007), 65% were assessed as being successful, 27% partly successful and 8% as unsuccessful.

==Criticism==
Since the ADB's early days, critics have charged that the two major donors, [[Japan]] and the [[United States]], have had extensive influence over lending, policy and staffing decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kilby&quot;&gt;

[[Oxfam]] Australia has criticized the Asian Development Bank of insensitivity to local communities. &quot;Operating at a global and international level, these banks can undermine people's human rights through projects that have detrimental outcomes for poor and marginalized communities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org.au/campaigns/adb/ Oxfam Australia.  &quot;The Mekong and Asian Development Bank]&lt;/ref&gt; The bank also received criticism from the [[United Nations Environmental Program]], stating in a report that &quot;much of the growth has bypassed more than 70 percent of its rural population, many of whom are directly dependent on natural resources for livelihoods and incomes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38568 IPS.  &quot;UNEP faults Asian development project.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

There had been criticism that ADB's large scale projects cause social and environmental damage due to lack of oversight. One of the most controversial ADB-related projects is [[Thailand]]'s Mae Moh [[coal-fired power station]]. Environmental and human rights activists say ADB's environmental safeguards policy as well as policies for [[indigenous peoples]] and [[involuntary resettlement]], while usually up to international standards on paper, are often ignored in practice, are too vague or weak to be effective, or are simply not enforced by bank officials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070508a5.html &quot; LOCAL CONCERNS IGNORED Large-scale ADB projects draw criticism&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/actuen/articles/113/article_3679.asp NGO criticises ADB and questions its ability to reduce poverty]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank has been criticized over its role and relevance in the [[food crisis]].The ADB has been accused by civil society of ignoring warnings leading up the crisis and also contributing to it by pushing loan conditions that many say unfairly pressure governments to [[deregulate]] and [[privatize]] agriculture, leading to problems such as the rice supply shortage in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bicusa.org/en/Article.3746.aspx &quot;ADB to meet amid food crisis, growing poverty&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank has also been criticized by [[Vietnam War]] [[Vietnam veteran|veterans]] for funding projects in Laos, because of the [[United States]]' 15% stake in the bank, underwritten by taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Denny | last=Walsh | title=Laos plot case back in federal court | url=http://www.sacbee.com/101/story/882584.html | publisher=Sacramento Bee | date=2008-04-23 | accessdate=2008-04-23 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laos became a [[communist]] country after the U.S. withdrew from Vietnam, and the [[Laotian Civil War]] was won by the [[Pathet Lao]], which is widely understood to have been supported by the [[North Vietnamese Army]].

In 2009, the bank endorsed a $2.9 billion funding strategy for proposed projects in [[India]]. The projects in this strategy were only indicative and still needed to be further approved by the bank's board of directors; however, PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang claimed, &quot;The Asian Development Bank, regardless of the major concerns of China, approved the India Country Partnership strategy which involves the territorial dispute between China and India. China expresses its strong dissatisfaction over this.... The bank's move not only seriously tarnishes its own name, but also undermines the interests of its members.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=China slams ADB over India funding | url=http://english.sina.com/china/2009/0618/249531.html | publisher=SINA English | date=2009-06-19 | accessdate=2009-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Republic of China (Taiwan)]] initially joined as &quot;China&quot; as a founding member representing the whole of China. However, its share of Bank capital was based on the size of Taiwan's capital, unlike the World Bank and IMF where the government in Taiwan had had a share representing the whole of China prior to the People's Republic of China joining and taking the Republic of China's seat. In 1986, a compromise was effected when the People's Republic of China joined the institution. The ROC was allowed to retain its membership, but under the name of Taipei, China — a name it protests. Uniquely, this allows both sides of the Taiwan Straits to be represented at the institution.

'''Aswan''' ({{IPA-en|ˌæsˈwɑːn |}}, {{IPA-ar|ʔɑˈsˁwɑːn|lang}}, {{lang-ar|أسوان}} {{transl|ar|''Aswān''}}, [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]]: ''Swenet'', [[Coptic language|Coptic]]: {{Coptic|ⲥⲟⲩⲁⲛ}} ''Swān'', {{lang-grc|Συήνη}} ''Syene''), formerly spelled ''Assuan'', is a city in the south of [[Egypt]], the capital of the [[Aswan Governorate]].

It stands on the east bank of the [[Nile]] at the [[first cataract]] and is a busy market and tourist centre. The modern city has expanded and includes the formerly separate community on the island of [[Elephantine]].

==History==
{{Hiero | ''swn.t'' | &lt;hiero&gt;s-E34:n-t:niwt&lt;/hiero&gt; | align=left | era=default}}
Aswan is the ancient city of '''''Swenet''''', which in antiquity was the frontier town of [[Ancient Egypt]] facing the south. Swenet is supposed to have derived its name from an Egyptian [[goddess]] with the same name. This goddess later was identified as [[Eileithyia]] by the Greeks and [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]] by the Romans during their occupation of Ancient Egypt because of the similar association of their goddesses with childbirth, and of which the import is &quot;the opener&quot;.  The ancient name of the city also is said to be derived from the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] symbol for ''trade''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Muhafazat Al Gumhuriya Al Arabiya Al Mutaheda wa Asaraha al baqiah fi al asr al islami|year=1966|author=Suʻād Māhir|publisher=Majlis al-Aʻlá lil-Shuʼūn al-Islāmīyah|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jEL5GwAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the [[Ancient Egyptians]] oriented toward the origin of the life-giving waters of the Nile in the south, Swenet was the first town in the country, and [[Egypt]] always was conceived to &quot;open&quot; or begin at Swenet.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The city stood upon a peninsula on the right (east) bank of the [[Nile]], immediately below (and north of) the first cataract of the flowing waters, which extend to it from [[Philae]]. Navigation to the delta was possible from this location without encountering a barrier.

The [[stone quarries of ancient Egypt]] located here were celebrated for their stone, and especially for the granitic rock called Syenite. They furnished the colossal statues, [[obelisk]]s, and monolithal shrines that are found throughout Egypt, including the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]]; and the traces of the quarrymen who wrought in these 3,000 years ago are still visible in the native rock. They lie on either bank of the [[Nile]], and a road, four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) in length, was cut beside them from Syene to [[Philae]].

Swenet was equally important as a military station as that of a place of traffic. Under every dynasty it was a garrison town; and here tolls and customs were levied on all boats passing southwards and northwards. Around AD 330, the legion stationed here received a bishop from [[Alexandria]]; this later became the [[Coptic Diocese of Syene]].&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, J. Harm F. [http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/FILES/faculties/theology/2005/j.h.f.dijkstra/thesis.pdf ''Religious Encounters on the Southern Egyptian Frontier in Late Antiquity (AD 298-642)].&lt;!--accessed 23 June 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The city is mentioned by numerous ancient writers, including [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref&gt;(ii. 30)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]],&lt;ref&gt;(ii. p.&amp;nbsp;133, xvii. p.&amp;nbsp;797, ''seq.'')&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephanus of Byzantium]],&lt;ref&gt;(''s. v.'')&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy]],&lt;ref&gt;(vii. 5. § 15, viii. 15. § 15)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]],&lt;ref&gt;(ii. 73. s. 75, v. 10. s. 11, vi. 29. s. 34)&lt;/ref&gt; [[De architectura]],&lt;ref&gt;(book viii. ch ii. § 6)&lt;/ref&gt; and it appears on the [[Antonine Itinerary]].&lt;ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;164)&lt;/ref&gt; It also is mentioned in the [[Book of Ezekiel]] and the [[Book of Isaiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel 29:10, 30:6; Isaiah 49:12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Aswan IMG 0637.jpg|thumb|250px|left|View of Aswan from the Tombs of the Nobles on the other side of the Nile]]

The [[latitude]] of the city that would become Aswan, located at– 24° 5′ 23″&amp;ndash; was an object of great interest to the ancient geographers. They believed that it was seated immediately under the [[Tropic of Cancer|tropic]], and that on the day of the [[summer solstice]], a vertical staff cast no shadow. They noted that the sun's disc was reflected in a well at noon. This statement is only approximately correct; at the summer solstice, the shadow was only 1/400th of the staff, and so could scarcely be discerned, and the northern limb of the Sun's disc would be nearly vertical.

[[Eratosthenes]] used measurements at Aswan ([[Elephantine]]) to determine the [[circumference]] of Earth, using [[Syene]] as the originating point and [[Alexandria]] as the terminal point of a measured arc (based on shadow length at the solstice).

The [[Nile]] is nearly 3,000 yards wide above Aswan. From this frontier town to the northern extremity of Egypt, the river flows for more than {{convert|750|mi|km}} without bar or cataract. The voyage from Aswan to Alexandria usually took 21 to 28 days in favourable weather.

==Climate==

Aswan is Egypt's hottest inhabited city{{Reference necessary|date=March 2011}}. Aswan's climate ranges from mild in the winter to very hot in the summer with absolutely no rain all year. Maybe 1 or 2&amp;nbsp;mm of rain every 5 years{{Reference necessary|date=March 2011}}. Aswan is one of the driest inhabited places in the world; as of early 2001, the last rain there was seven years earlier. {{As of|2007|alt=As of 6 April 2010}}, the last rainfall was a thunderstorm on May 13, 2006. In [[Nubia]]n settlements, they generally do not bother to roof all of the rooms in their houses{{Reference necessary|date=March 2011}}. 

In winter the temperatures average from 11 degrees at night to 25 degrees during the day. In summer the temperature averages 25 degrees at night to 40 degrees during the day.

'''Saint Adelaide of Italy''' (931/932 – 16 December 999), also called '''Adelaide of Burgundy''', was the (second) consort to [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and perhaps the most prominent European woman of the 10th century; she was regent of the Holy Roman Empire as the guardian of her grandson in 991-995.

==Life==
Born in [[Orbe]], today in [[Switzerland]], she was the daughter of [[Rudolf II of Burgundy]] and [[Bertha of Swabia]]. Her first marriage, at the age of fifteen, was to the son of her father's rival in Italy, [[Lothair II of Italy|Lothair II]], the nominal [[King of Italy]]; the union was part of a political settlement designed to conclude a peace between her father and [[Hugh of Provence]], the father of Lothair. They had a daughter, [[Emma of Italy]].

===Marriage to Otto I===
[[Image:Meissner-dom-stifter.jpg|thumb|left|Adelaide and her second spouse Otto I the Great]]
The [[Calendar of Saints]] states that her first husband was poisoned by the holder of real power, his successor, [[Berengar of Ivrea]], who attempted to cement his political power by forcing her to marry his son, [[Adalbert of Ivrea|Adalbert]]; when she refused and fled, she was tracked down and imprisoned for four months at [[Como]]. She escaped to the protection, at [[Canossa]], of [[Adalbert Atto of Canossa|Adalbert Atto]], where she was besieged by Berengar. She managed to send an emissary to throw herself on the mercy of [[Otto the Great]] of [[King of Germany|Germany]]. His brothers were equally willing to save the heiress of Italy, but Otto got an army into the field: they subsequently met at the old [[Lombards|Lombard]] capital of [[Pavia]] and were married in 951; he was crowned [[Emperor]] in Rome, 2 February 962 by [[Pope John XII]], and, most unusually, she was crowned [[Empress (disambiguation)|Empress]] at the same ceremony.  Among their children, four lived to maturity: Henry, born in 952; Bruno, born 953; [[Matilda, Abbess of Quedlinburg]], born about 954; and [[Otto II]], later [[Holy Roman Emperor]], born 955.

In Germany, the crushing of a revolt in 953 by [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]], Otto's son by his first marriage,  cemented the position of Adelaide, who retained all her dower lands. She accompanied Otto in 966 on his third expedition to Italy, where she remained with him for six years.

===Court of Otto III===
When her husband Otto I died in 973 he was succeeded by their son [[Otto II]], and Adelaide for some years exercised a powerful influence at court. Later, however, her daughter-in-law, the Byzantine princess [[Theophanu|Theophano]], turned her husband Otto II against his mother, and she was driven from court in 978; she  lived partly in Italy, and partly with her brother [[Conrad, king of Burgundy]], by whose mediation she was ultimately reconciled to her son; in 983 Otto appointed her his viceroy in Italy. However, Otto died the same year, and although both mother and grandmother were appointed as co-regents for the child-king, [[Otto III]], Theophano forced Adelaide to [[abdicate]] and exiled her. When Theophano died in 991, Adelaide was restored to the regency of her grandson. She was assisted by [[Willigis]], [[Archbishop of Mainz]]. In 995 Otto III came of age, and Adelaide was free to devote herself exclusively to works of charity, notably the foundation or restoration of religious houses.

===Retirement===
Adelaide had long entertained close relations with [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]], then the center of the movement for ecclesiastical reform, and in particular with its abbots [[Majolus]] and [[Odilo of Cluny|Odilo]]. She retired to a monastery she had founded in c. 991 at [[Selz Abbey|Selz]] in [[Alsace]]. Though she never became a nun, she spent the rest of her days there in prayer. On her way to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] to support her nephew [[Rudolf III]] against a rebellion, she died at Selz Abbey on December 16, 999, days short of the [[millennium]] she thought would bring the [[Second Coming]] of Christ. She had constantly devoted herself to the service of the church and peace, and to the empire as guardian of both; she also interested herself in the conversion of the Slavs. She was thus a principal agent&amp;mdash;almost an embodiment&amp;mdash;of the work of the [[Catholic Church]] during the [[Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]] in the construction of the religion-culture of western Europe. Her feast day, December 16, is still kept in many German dioceses.

The '''Airbus A300''' is a short- to medium-[[Range (aircraft)|range]] [[Wide-body aircraft|widebody]] [[jet airliner]]. Launched in 1972 as the world's first twin-engined widebody, it was the first product of [[Airbus|Airbus Industrie]], a [[consortium]] of European [[aerospace]] companies, wholly owned today by [[EADS]]. The A300 can typically seat 266 passengers in a two-class layout, with a maximum [[Range (aircraft)|range]] of {{Convert|4070|nmi|km|lk=on}} when fully loaded, depending on model. 

Launch customer [[Air France]] introduced the type into service on 30 May 1974. Production of the A300 ceased in July 2007, along with its smaller [[Airbus A310|A310]] derivative. [[Cargo aircraft|Freighter]] sales for which the A300 competed are to be fulfilled by a new [[Airbus_A330#A330-200F|A330-200F]] derivative.&lt;ref name=fi_20060314&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2006/03/14/Navigation/177/205407/Airbus+aims+to+fill+freighter+void+with+A330+derivative.html|title=Airbus aims to fill freighter void with A330 derivative|publisher=[[Flight International]]|date=14 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The mission requirements were given in 1966 by Frank Kolk, an [[American Airlines]] executive, for a [[Boeing 727]] replacement on busy short- to medium-range routes such as United States transcontinental flights. His brief included a passenger capacity of 250 to 300 seated in a twin-aisle configuration and fitted with two engines, with the capability of carrying full passengers without penalty from high-altitude airports like [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]. American manufacturers responded with widebody trijets, the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] and the [[Lockheed L-1011 Tristar]], as twinjets were banned from many routes by the FAA.

[[File:IMG 1265r.jpg|thumb|left|An [[American Airlines]] A300B4-605R landing at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], New York in 2005. On 29 August 2009 American Airlines retired all A300 aircraft.]]
In September 1967, the British, French, and German governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to start development of the 300-seat Airbus A300. An earlier announcement had been made in July 1967, but at that time the announcement had been clouded by the British Government's support for the Airbus, which coincided with its refusal to back [[British Aircraft Corporation]]'s (BAC) proposed competitor, a development of the [[BAC 1-11]], despite a preference for the latter expressed by [[British European Airways]] (BEA).

In the months following this agreement, both the French and British governments expressed doubts about the aircraft. Another problem was the requirement for a new engine to be developed by [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]], the RB207. In December 1968, the French and British partner companies ([[Sud Aviation]] and [[Hawker Siddeley]]) proposed a revised configuration, the 250-seat Airbus A250. Renamed the A300B, the aircraft would not require new engines, reducing development costs. To attract potential US customers, American [[GE-Aviation|General Electric]] [[General Electric CF6|CF6-50]] engines powered the A300 instead of the British RB207. The British government was upset and withdrew from the venture; however, the British firm Hawker-Siddeley stayed on as a contractor, developing the wings for the A300, which were pivotal in later versions' impressive performance from short domestic to long intercontinental flights.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} (Years later, through [[British Aerospace]], the UK re-entered the consortium.)

[[File:lufthansa.a300b4-600r.d-aiay.arp.jpg|thumb|A [[Lufthansa]] A300B4-603 departs [[London Heathrow Airport]], England in 2007. On 1 July 2009 Lufthansa retired their A300 fleet.]]

Airbus Industrie was formally set up in 1970 following an agreement between [[Aérospatiale]] (France) and the antecedents to [[DaimlerChrysler Aerospace|Deutsche Aerospace]] (Germany). They were joined by the Spanish [[Construcciones Aeronáuticas|CASA]] in 1971. Each company would deliver its sections as fully equipped, ready-to-fly items.

In 1972 the A300 made its [[maiden flight]]. The first production model, the A300B2, entered service in 1974 followed by the A300B4 one year later. Initially the success of the consortium was poor, but by 1979 there were 81 aircraft in service. It was the launch of the [[Airbus A320 family|A320]] in 1987 that established Airbus as a major player in the aircraft market&amp;nbsp;— the aircraft had over 400 orders before it first flew, compared to 15 for the A300 in 1972.

The A300 was the first airliner to use [[Just In Time (business)|just-in-time]] manufacturing techniques. Complete aircraft sections were manufactured by consortium partners all over Europe. These were airlifted to the final assembly line at [[Toulouse Blagnac International Airport|Toulouse-Blagnac]] by a fleet of [[Boeing 377]]-derived [[Aero Spacelines Super Guppy]] aircraft. Originally devised as a way to share the work among Airbus' partners without the expense of two assembly lines, it turned out to be a more efficient way of building aircraft (more flexible and reduced costs) as opposed to building the whole aircraft at one site.

The A300 cemented European cooperation in aviation. Its first flight was commemorated on a French three [[franc]] stamp.

==Design==
[[File:Airbus A300 cross section.jpg|thumb|Airbus A300 fuselage cross-section, showing the passenger compartment above and the baggage area below. On display in the [[Deutsches Museum]] in [[Munich]], Germany.]]
[[File:Airbus A300-600R Egyptair SU-GAR.jpg|thumb|An [[EgyptAir]] A300-600R landing at [[Düsseldorf International Airport]], Germany. (2003)]]

Airbus partners employed the latest technology, some derived from the [[Concorde]]. On entry into service in 1974, the A300 was very advanced and influenced later subsonic airliner designs. The technological highlights include:
* Advanced wings by [[de Havilland]] (later [[BAE Systems]]) with:
** [[Supercritical wing|supercritical airfoil section]] for economical performance
** advanced aerodynamically efficient flight controls
* 5.64&amp;nbsp;m (222&amp;nbsp;in) diameter circular fuselage section for 8-abreast passenger seating and wide enough for 2 [[Unit Load Device|LD3]] cargo containers side-by-side
* Structures made from metal [[billet (manufacturing)|billets]], reducing weight
* First airliner to be fitted with [[wind shear]] protection
* Advanced autopilots capable of flying the aircraft from climb-out to landing
* Electrically controlled braking system

Later A300s incorporate other advanced features such as:
* 2-man crew by automating the [[flight engineer|flight engineer's]] functions, an industry first
* [[Glass cockpit]] flight instruments
* Extensive use of composites for an aircraft of its era
* Center-of-gravity control by shifting around fuel
* [[Wingtip fence]]s for better aerodynamics (first introduced on the [[Airbus A310|A310-300]]).

All these made the A300 a substitute for the widebody trijets such as [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] and [[Lockheed L-1011]] for short to medium routes. On the early versions, Airbus used the same engines and similar major systems as the DC-10.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

==Operational history==
After the launch, sales of the A300 were weak for some years, with most orders going to airlines that had an obligation to favor the domestically made product – notably Air France and [[Lufthansa]]. At one stage, Airbus had 16 &quot;whitetail&quot; A300s – completed but unsold aircraft – sitting on the tarmac. [[Germanair]] was the world's first [[charter airline]] and [[Indian Airlines]] was the world's first domestic airline to purchase the A300. These have now been retired.

In 1977, U.S. carrier [[Eastern Air Lines]] leased four A300s as an in-service trial. [[Frank Borman]], ex-astronaut and the then CEO, was impressed that the A300 consumed 30% less fuel than his fleet of Tristars and then ordered 23 of the type (This order is often cited as the point at which Airbus came to be seen as a serious competitor to the large American aircraft-manufacturers [[Boeing]] and [[McDonnell Douglas]]). This was followed by an order from [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]]. From then on, the A300 family sold well, eventually reaching a total of 878 [http://www.planespotters.net/Production_List/Airbus/A300/index.php?p=6] delivered aircraft.

In 1977, [[AeroCóndor]] Colombia was the first Airbus operator in Colombia and Latin America, leased one Airbus A300 c/n 029 registered as HK-2057 and named as 
Ciudad de Barranquilla” This aircraft operated from 15 December 1977, until 17 April 1979, with AeroCóndor scheduled services between Bogotá, Barranquilla, Cali, Medellín and Miami.

The aircraft found particular favour with Asian airlines, being bought by [[Japan Air System]], [[Korean Air]], [[Thai Airways International]], [[Singapore Airlines]], [[Malaysia Airlines]], [[Philippine Airlines]], [[Garuda Indonesia]], [[China Airlines]], [[Pakistan International Airlines]], [[Indian Airlines]], [[Trans Australia Airlines]] and many others. As Asia did not have restrictions similar to the FAA [[ETOPS/LROPS|60-minutes rule]] for twin-engine airliners which existed at the time, Asian airlines used A300s for routes across the [[Bay of Bengal]] and [[South China Sea]].

[[File:dhl a300b4-200 oo-dlz arp.jpg|thumb|left|A [[DHL]] A300B4-200 takes off from London [[Luton Airport]], England. (2007)]]

In 1977, the A300B4 became the first [[ETOPS]] compliant aircraft – its high performance and safety standards qualified it for Extended Twin Engine Operations over water, providing operators with more versatility in routing. In 1982 [[Garuda Indonesia]] became the first airline to fly the A300B4-200FF. By 1981, Airbus was growing rapidly, with over 300 aircraft sold and options for 200 more planes for over forty airlines. Alarmed by the success of the A300, Boeing responded with the new [[Boeing 767]].

The A300 provided Airbus the experience of manufacturing and selling airliners competitively. The basic fuselage of the A300 was later stretched ([[Airbus A330|A330]] and [[Airbus A340|A340]]), shortened (A310), or modified into derivatives ([[Airbus Beluga|A300-600ST ''Beluga'' Super Transporter]]).The largest freight operator of the A300 is [[FedEx Express]], which, as of June 2010, had 71 A300/310 aircraft. [[UPS Airlines]] also operates freighter versions of the A300. The final version was the A300-600R and is rated for 180-minute [[ETOPS]]. The A300 has enjoyed renewed interest in the secondhand market for conversion to freighters. The freighter versions – either new-build A300-600s or converted ex-passenger A300-600s, A300B2s and B4s – account for most of the world freighter fleet after the [[Boeing 747]] freighter.

In March 2006 Airbus announced the closure of the A300/A310 line&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = A300/A310 Final Assembly to be completed by July 2007 | publisher=Airbus | date = 7 March 2006 | url = http://www.airbus.com/en/presscentre/pressreleases/pressreleases_items/07_03_06_A300_final_assembly.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; making them the first Airbus aircraft to be discontinued. The final production A300 made its initial flight on 18 April 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = The last A300 makes its maiden flight | publisher=Airbus | date = 18 April 2007 | url = http://www.airbus.com/en/myairbus/newsbrief/index.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was delivered on 12 July 2007. It was an A300F freighter for [[FedEx]]. Airbus has announced a support package to keep A300s flying commercially until at least 2025.

==Variants==
[[File:Airbus A300B2.jpg|thumb|This A300B1 was the second A300 ever built and one of the first to enter service with an airline in late 1974. It had been used as a fire brigade training structure at [[Brussels Airport]] since 1990 and was destroyed on 9 July 2003.]]

[[File:A300 Zero G.jpg|thumb|The [[Vomit Comet|ZERO-G]] A300 at [[Cologne Bonn Airport]], Germany. (2004)]]

===A300B1===
Only two were built: the first prototype, and a second aircraft which was leased in November 1974 to [[Trans European Airways]] (TEA). TEA instantly subleased the aircraft for six weeks to [[Air Algérie]]. It has accommodation for 300 passengers (TEA) or 323 passengers (Air Algérie) with a maximum weight of 132,000&amp;nbsp;kg and two [[General Electric CF6|General Electric CF6-50A]] engines of 220&amp;nbsp;kN thrust.

===A300B2===
The first production version. Powered by General Electric CF6 or [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D]] engines (the same engines that powered the Boeing 747–100, &quot;the original jumbo jet&quot;) of between 227 and 236&amp;nbsp;kN thrust, it entered service with Air France in May 1974. The prototype A300B2 made its first flight on 28 June 1973 and was certificated by the French and German authorities on 15 March 1974 and FAA approval followed on 30 May 1974. The first production A300B2 (A300 number 5) made its maiden flight on 15 April 1974 and was handed over to Air France a few weeks later on 10 May 1974. The A300B2 entered revenue service on 23 May 1974 between Paris and London.
* A300B2-100: 137 Metric Ton [[MTOW]]
* A300B2-200: 142 Metric Ton [[MTOW]], with [[Krüger flap]]s, first delivery to [[South African Airways]] in 1976
* A300B2-300: increased Maximum Landing Weight/Maximum Zero Fuel Weight

===A300B4===
The major production version. Features a centre fuel tank for increased fuel capacity (47,500&amp;nbsp;kg). Production of the B2 and B4 totaled 248. The first A300B4 (the 9th A300) flew on 25 December 1974 and was certificated on 26 March 1975. The first delivery was made to Germanair (which later merged into [[Hapag Lloyd]]) on 23 May 1975.
* A300B4-100: 157.5 Metric Ton [[MTOW]], first delivery to [[Germanair]] in 1975.
* A300B4-200: 165 Metric Ton [[MTOW]], first delivery to [[Hapag-Lloyd Flug]] in 1980
* A300B4-200FF: An A300 with a &quot;forward-facing&quot; crew compartment. The world's first 2-crew widebody airliner. Includes some of the A310's and A300-600's digital avionics. First saw service with [[Garuda Indonesia]] in 1982, further customers were [[VASP]], [[Tunisair]], [[Kar-Air]]/[[Finnair]] and [[MNG Airlines]].
* A300B4-600: Referred to as the A300-600. See Below.
* A300C4: Convertible freighter version, with a large cargo door on the port side. First delivered to [[South African Airways]] in October 1982.
* A300F4-203: Freighter version of the A300B4-200. First delivery occurred in 1986, but only very few were built as the A300F4-200 was soon replaced by the more capable A300-600F (official designation: A300F4-600).

===A300-600===
Officially designated A300B4-600, this version is the same length as the B2 and B4 but has increased space because it uses the A310 rear fuselage and tail. It has higher power [[General Electric CF6|CF6-80]] or [[Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000]] engines and uses the [[Honeywell]] 331-250 [[auxiliary power unit]] (APU).&lt;ref name=hw&gt;{{Cite web|title=Honeywell 331-250 APU|url=http://www.honeywell.com/sites/portal?smap=aerospace&amp;page=Power_Systems3&amp;theme=T5&amp;catID=CB6099334-14AB-C264-AB94-8E47224CA642&amp;id=H544A09A8-A70B-FA73-F93C-6AEFB3D0FB6D&amp;sel=4|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The A300-600 entered service in 1983 with [[Saudi Arabian Airlines]] and a total of 313 A300-600s (all versions) have been sold. The A300-600 also has a similar cockpit to the A310, eliminating the need for a flight engineer. The FAA issues a single type rating which allows operation of both the A310 and A300-600.
* A300-600: (Official designation: A300B4-600) The baseline model of the −600 series.
* A300-620C: (Official designation: A300C4-620) A convertible freighter version. First delivery December 1985.
* A300-600F: (Official designation: A300F4-600) The freighter version of the baseline −600.
* A300-600R: (Official designation: A300B4-600R) The increased range −600, achieved by an additional trim fuel tank in the tail. First delivery in 1988 to American Airlines; all A300s built since 1989 (freighters included) are −600Rs. [[Japan Air System]] (later merged in [[Japan Air Lines]]) took delivery of the last new-built passenger A300, an A300-622R, in November 2002.
* A300-600RF: (Official designation: A300F4-600R) The freighter version of the −600R. All A300s delivered between November 2002 and 12 July 2007 (last ever A300 delivery) were A300-600RFs.
* A300-600ST: Commonly referred to as the Beluga or &quot;Airbus Super Transporter,&quot; these five airframes are used by Airbus to ferry parts between the company's disparate manufacturing facilities, thus enabling workshare distribution. They replaced the four Aero Spacelines Super Guppys previously used by Airbus.

===A300B10===
{{Main|Airbus A310}}
Introduced a shorter fuselage, a new, higher [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] wing, smaller tail and two crew operation. It is available in standard −200 and the Extended range −300 with {{convert|9600|km|0|abbr=on}} range in both passenger and full cargo versions. It is also available as a military tanker/transport serving the [[Canadian Forces]] and [[Luftwaffe]]. Sales total 260, although five of these (ordered by [[Iraqi Airways]]) were never built.

==Accidents and incidents==
[[File:KhatmanduCrash2.jpg|thumb|Wreckage Of PIA Flight 268.]]
The A300 has been involved in 54 accidents and incidents including 26 hull-losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;asna300&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title=Airbus A300 | url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/type/type.php?type=020 | work=| publisher=Aviation Safety Network | date=3 July 2010 | accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 1434 fatalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;asna300&quot; /&gt;

* 27 June 1976: [[Operation Entebbe|Air France Flight 139]], originating in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel and carrying 248 passengers and a crew of 12 took off from Athens, Greece, headed for Paris, France. The flight was hijacked by terrorists, and was eventually flown to [[Entebbe Airport]] (now known as Entebbe International Airport) in Uganda.
* 18 December 1983: [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 684]], an Airbus A300B4 leased from [[Scandinavian Airlines System]] (SAS), registration OY-KAA, crashed short of the runway at Kuala Lumpur in bad weather while attempting to land on a flight from Singapore. All 247 persons aboard escaped unharmed but the aircraft was destroyed in the resulting fire.
* 3 July 1988: [[Iran Air Flight 655]] was shot down by the [[USS Vincennes (CG-49)|USS Vincennes]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] after being mistaken for an attacking Iranian [[F-14 Tomcat]], killing all 290 passengers and crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranair&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/flight801/stories/july88crash.htm|accessdate=3 August 2006|title=Navy Missile Downs Iranian Jetliner|date=4 July 1988|work=Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 28 September 1992: [[PIA Flight 268]] a Pakistan International Airlines A300B4 crashed on approach near Kathmandu, Nepal. All 12 crew and 155 passengers were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2001/11/12/airbus011112.html | work=CBC News | title=The Airbus A300 | date=12 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 26 April 1994: [[China Airlines Flight 140]] (Republic of China) crashed at the end of runway at [[Nagoya]], Japan, killing all 15 crew and 249 of 256 passengers on board.
* 24 December 1994: [[Air France Flight 8969]] was hijacked at [[Houari Boumedienne Airport]] in [[Algiers]], by four terrorists who belonged to the [[Armed Islamic Group]]. The terrorists apparently intended to crash the plane over the [[Eiffel Tower]] on [[Boxing Day]]. After a failed attempt to leave [[Marseille]] following a confrontational firefight between the terrorists and the [[Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale|GIGN]] French Special Forces, the result was the death of all four terrorists. (Snipers on the terminal front's roof shot dead two of the terrorists. The other two terrorists died as a result of gunshots in the cabin after approximately 20 minutes.) Three hostages including a Vietnamese diplomat were executed, 229 hostages survived, many of them wounded by shrapnel. The almost 15-year-old aircraft was written off.
* 26 September 1997: [[Garuda Indonesia Flight 152]] crashed while landing at [[Medan, Indonesia]] killing 234 aboard.
* 16 February 1998: [[China Airlines Flight 676]] (Republic of China) crashed into residential area close to [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|CKS international airport]] near Taipei, Taiwan. All 196 people on board were killed, including Taiwan's central bank president. Six people on the ground were also killed.
* 24 December 1999: [[Indian Airlines Flight 814|Indian Airlines Flight IC 814]] from [[Kathmandu|Kathmandu, Nepal]] to New Delhi was hijacked to [[Kandahar|Kandahar, Afghanistan]]. 1 fatality.
* 12 November 2001: [[American Airlines Flight 587]] crashed into the [[Belle Harbor, Queens|Belle Harbor]] neighborhood of [[Queens, NY|Queens]], NY shortly after takeoff from [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]. All 260 people on board were killed, along with 5 people on the ground.
* 22 November 2003: [[DHL shootdown incident in Baghdad|European Air Transport OO-DLL]], operating on behalf of [[DHL Aviation]], was hit by an [[SA-14 Gremlin|SA-14 'Gremlin']] missile after takeoff from [[Baghdad International Airport]]. The airplane lost hydraulic pressure and thus the controls. After extending the landing gear to create more drag, the crew piloted the plane using differences in engine thrust and landed the plane with minimal further damage. The plane was repaired and offered for sale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20031122-0 incident summary and photos]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 14 April 2010: [[Aerounion – Aerotransporte de Carga Union Flight 302|Aerounion Flight 302]], an A300B4-203F, crashed on a road 2&amp;nbsp;km short of the runway while attempting to land at [[General Mariano Escobedo International Airport|Monterrey airport]], Mexico. Seven people killed (5 crew, 2 on the ground)&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20100413-1 Aviation-Safety.net accident report]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{commonscat|Agostino Carracci}}
'''Agostino Carracci''' (or '''Caracci''') (16 August 1557 – 22 March 1602) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[printmaker]]. He was the brother of the more famous [[Annibale Carracci|Annibale]] and cousin of [[Lodovico Carracci]]. 

He posited the ideal in nature, and was the founder of the competing school to the more gritty (for lack of a better term) view of nature as expressed by [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]]. He was one of the founders of the [[Accademia degli Incamminati]] along with his brother, Annibale Carracci, and cousin, Ludovico Carracci. The academy helped propel painters of the [[Bolognese School (painting)|School of Bologna]] to prominence.

==Life==
Agostino Carracci was born in [[Bologna]], and trained at the workshop of the architect Domenico Tibaldi. Starting from 1574 he worked as a reproductive [[engraver]], copying works of 16th century masters such as [[Federico Barocci]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Antonio Campi]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and [[Correggio]]. He also produced some original prints, including two [[etching]]s.

He travelled to [[Venice]] (1582, 1587–1589) and [[Parma]] (1586–1587). Together with Annibale and Ludovico he worked in Bologna on the fresco cycles in Palazzo Fava (''Histories of Jason and Medea'', 1584) and [[Palazzo Magnani]] (''Histories of [[Romulus]]'', 1590–1592). In 1592 he also painted the ''Communion of St. Jerome'', now in the [[Pinacoteca di Bologna]] and considered his masterwork. From 1586 is his altarpiece of the ''Madonna with Child and Saints'', in the National Gallery of [[Parma]].

In 1598 Carracci joined his brother Annibale in Rome, to collaborate on the decoration of the Gallery in [[Palazzo Farnese, Rome|Palazzo Farnese]]. From 1598–1600 is a ''triple Portrait'', now in [[Naples]], an example of genre painting. 

In 1600 he was called to Parma by Duke [[Ranuccio I Farnese]] to began the decoration of the Palazzo del Giardino, but he died before it was finished.

Agostino's son [[Antonio Marziale Carracci|Antonio Carracci]] was also a painter, and attempted to compete with his father's Academy.

}}
'''Adenylate cyclase''' ({{EC number|4.6.1.1}}, also known as '''adenylyl cyclase''', '''adenyl cyclase''' or '''AC''') is a [[lyase]] [[enzyme]]. It is a part of the [[cAMP-dependent pathway]]

==Types==
There are ten known adenylate cyclases in [[mammal]]s:
{{refbegin|3}}
* [[ADCY1]]
* [[ADCY2]]
* [[ADCY3]]
* [[ADCY4]]
* [[ADCY5]]
* [[ADCY6]]
* [[ADCY7]]
* [[ADCY8]]
* [[ADCY9]]
* [[ADCY10]]
{{refend}}

==Reaction==
Adenylate cyclase [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the conversion of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to [[cyclic AMP|3',5'-cyclic AMP]] (cAMP) and [[pyrophosphate]].

[[image:adenylate kinase.png|thumb|500px|center|The reaction that Adenylate Cyclase catalyzes is the conversion of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to [[cyclic AMP|3',5'-cyclic AMP]]]]

cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) is an important molecule in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[signal transduction]], a so-called [[second messenger]]. Adenylate cyclase can be activated or inhibited by [[G protein]]s, which are coupled to membrane receptors and thus can respond to hormonal or other stimuli. Following activation of adenylate cyclase, the resulting cAMP acts as a second messenger by interacting with and regulating other proteins such as [[protein kinase A]] and [[HCN channel|cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels]].

Photoactivatable adenylate cyclase (PAC) was discovered in ''E. gracilis'' and can be expressed in other organisms through genetic manipulation. Shining blue light on a cell containing PAC activates it and abruptly increases the rate of conversion of ATP to cAMP. This is a useful technique for researchers in neuroscience because it allows them to quickly increase the intracellular cAMP levels in particular neurons, and to study the effect of that increase in neural activity on the behavior of the organism. For example, PAC expression in certain neurons has been shown to alter the grooming behavior in fruit flies exposed to blue light [http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v4/n1/abs/nmeth975.html]. Researchers also use [[channelrhodopsin-2]] in a similar fashion.

==Structure==
[[Image:Adenylyl cyclase.png|thumb|Structure of adenylate cyclase]]
Adenylyl cyclase is a transmembrane [[protein]]. It passes through the [[plasma membrane]] twelve times. 

The important parts for its function are located in the [[cytoplasm]] and can be subdivided into the N-terminus, C1a, C1b, C2a, and C2b. 

The C1 region exists between transmembrane helices six and seven, and the C2 region follows transmembrane helix 12. 

The C1a and C2a domains form a catalytic dimer where ATP binds and is converted to cAMP.

==Regulation==
Adenylate cyclase is dually regulated by [[G protein]]s (Gs stimulating activity and Gi inhibiting it), and by [[forskolin]], as well as other class-specific substrates:
* Isoforms I, III and VIII are also stimulated by [[calcium|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]]/[[calmodulin]].
* Isoforms V and VI are inhibited by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in a calmodulin-independent manner.
* Isoforms II, IV and IX are stimulated by beta gamma subunits of the G protein.
* Isoforms I, V and VI are most clearly inhibited by Gi, while other isoforms show less dual regulation by the inhibitory G protein.
* Soluble AC (sAC) is not a transmembrane form and is not regulated by G proteins or forskolin, instead acts as a bicarbonate/pH sensor.

In [[neuron]]s, calcium-sensitive adenylate cyclases are located next to calcium [[ion channel]]s for faster reaction to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx; they are suspected of playing an important role in learning processes. This is supported by the fact that adenylate cyclases are ''coincidence detectors'', meaning that they are activated only by several different signals occurring together.  In peripheral cells and tissues adenylate cyclases appear to form molecular complexes with specific receptors and other signaling proteins in an isoform-specific manner.

'''Alexandra''' ({{lang-el|Αλεξάνδρᾱ}}) is the feminine form of the given name [[Alexander]], which is a [[romanization]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] name ''Αλέξανδρος'' (Alexandros). [[Etymology|Etymologically]], the name is a compound of the Greek verb ''ἀλέξειν'' (alexein) &quot;to defend&quot; and the noun ''ἀνδρός'' (andros), genitive of ''ἀνήρ'' (anēr) &quot;man&quot;. Thus it may be roughly translated as &quot;protector of man&quot;. The name was one of the titles (&quot;epithets&quot;) given to the Greek goddess Hera and as such is usually taken to mean &quot;one who comes to save warriors&quot;. The earliest attested form of the name is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''a-re-ka-sa-da-ra'', written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=217 a-re-ka-sa-da-ra (Alexandra)] Palaeolexicon, Word study tool of ancient languages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Mycenaean World'', by John Chadwick, New York: Cambridge University Press, 1976, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Articolo 31''' is a popular band from [[Milan]], [[Italy]], melding [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[funk]], pop and traditional [[Italy|Italian]] musical forms.  They are one of the most popular Italian rock/hip hop groups.

==Band history==
Members are rapper [[J Ax]] (real name Alessandro Aleotti) and [[DJ Jad]] (Vito Luca Perrini). The band took its name from the [[Ireland|Irish]] constitutional law guaranteeing freedom of the press.

'''Articolo 31''' was one of the first hip hop groups in Italy, releasing one of the first Italian hip hop records, ''Strade di città'', in 1993. Soon, they signed with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG Ricordi]] and started to mix their rap with pop music, obtaining great success and popularity. However, the underground hip hop scene positioned them as traitors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Their producer was [[Franco Godi]], who also produced the music for the ''Signor Rossi'' animated series.

In 1997, [[DJ Gruff]] dissed Articolo 31 in a track titled ''1 vs 2'' appearing on the first album of the beatmaker [[Fritz da Cat]], but Articolo 31's [[lawyer]]s obtained a retraction of the record, and its reissue without the song.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

In 2001, Articolo 31 collaborated with the American [[old school hip hop|old school]] rapper [[Kurtis Blow]] on the album ''XChé SI!''. In the same year, they made the movie ''Senza filtro'' (in English, ''&quot;Without filter&quot;'').

With ''Domani smetto'', Articolo 31 left the world of hip hop and moved to rap with many influences; even more so than previously, this album found them rapping and singing to rock and pop tracks.

In recent years, J Ax and DJ Jad have each released solo records, and in 2006, the group declared an indefinite [[Recess (break)|hiatus]].

Their posse, ''Spaghetti Funk'', includes other popular performers like [[Space One]] and pop rappers [[Gemelli DiVersi]].

'''Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky''' ({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Фёдорович Ке́ренский}}, {{IPA-ru|ɐlʲɪˈksandr ˈkʲerʲɪnskʲɪj|IPA}}; {{OldStyleDate|4 May |1881|22 April}}&amp;nbsp;– 11 June 1970) was a major political leader before and during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolutions of 1917]].

Kerensky served as the second Prime Dictator of the [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Russian Provisional Government]] until [[Vladimir Lenin]] was elected by the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets]] following the [[October Revolution]]. He died in exile.

==Biography== 
==== Early life and activism ====
Alexander Kerensky was born in Simbirsk (now [[Ulyanovsk]]) on the [[Volga River]] into the family of a secondary school principal. His father, Fyodor Kerensky, was a teacher. His mother, Nadezhda Adler, was the daughter of a nobleman, Alexander Adler, head of the Topographical Bureau of the [[Kazan]] Military District. Her mother, Nadezhda Kalmykova, was the daughter of a former [[serf]] who had bought his freedom before [[Emancipation reform of 1861|serfdom was abolished in 1861]], allowing him to become a wealthy Moscow merchant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mega.km.ru/bes_2004/encyclop.asp?TopicNumber=31562&amp;search=%EA%E5%F0%E5%ED%F1%EA%E8%E9 Encyclopedia of Cyril and Method (In Russian only)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=February 2010}}

Kerensky's father was the headmaster of Vladimir Ulyanov (Lenin) at a secondary school for boys in Simbirsk, and members of the Kerensky and Ulyanov families were friends. In 1889, when Kerensky was eight, his family moved to Tashkent, where his father had been appointed the main inspector of public schools (superintendent). Kerensky graduated with honors from a Tashkent secondary school in 1899. The same year he entered [[St. Petersburg University]], where he studied history and philology in his first year. The next year he switched to the Law Department and received a law degree in 1904, getting married in the same year to the daughter of a Russian general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2001/janfeb/features/kerensky.html A Doomed Democracy] Bernard Butcher, Stanford Magazine, January/February 2001&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a legal counsel to victims of government violence in early December 1905. At the end of the month he was jailed on suspicion of belonging to a militant group. Afterwards he gained a reputation for his work as a defence lawyer in a number of political trials of revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Political Figures of Russia, 1917, Biographical Dictionary, Large Russian Encyclopedia, 1993, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected to the [[Fourth Duma]] in 1912 as a member of the [[Trudoviks]], a moderate [[Labour movement|labour party]] who were associated with the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]]. He was a brilliant orator and skilled parliamentary leader of the socialist opposition to the regime of the ruling Tsar, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]].

==== February Revolution of 1917 ====
When the [[February Revolution]] broke out in spring of 1917, Kerensky was one of its most prominent leaders: he was member of the [[Provisional Committee of the State Duma]] and was elected vice-chairman of the [[Petrograd Soviet]]. He simultaneously became the first [[Minister of Justice]] in the newly formed [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]]. When the Soviet passed a resolution prohibiting its leaders from joining the government, Kerensky delivered a stirring speech at a Soviet meeting. Although the decision was never formalized, he was granted a ''de facto'' exemption and continued acting in both capacities.

After the first government crisis over [[Pavel Milyukov]]'s secret note re-committing Russia to its original war aims on May 2–4, Kerensky became the [[Minister of War]] and the dominant figure in the newly formed socialist-liberal coalition government. On 10 May ([[Julian calendar]]), Kerensky started for the front, and visited one division after another, urging the men to do their duty. His speeches were impressive and convincing for the moment, but had little lasting effect. Under Allied pressure to continue the war, he launched what became known as the [[Kerensky Offensive]] against the Austro-Hungarian/German South Army on 17 June ([[Julian calendar]]). At first successful, the offensive was soon stopped and then thrown back by a strong counter-attack. The Russian Army suffered heavy losses and it was clear from the many incidents of desertion, sabotage, and mutiny that the Russian Army was no longer willing to attack.

Kerensky was heavily criticised by the military for his liberal policies, which included stripping officers of their mandate (handing overriding control to revolutionary inclined &quot;soldier committees&quot; instead), the abolition of the death penalty, and the presence of various revolutionary agitators at the front. Many officers jokingly referred to commander in chief Kerensky as &quot;persuader in chief&quot;.

On 2 July 1917, the first coalition collapsed over the question of [[Ukraine]]'s autonomy. Following [[July Days]] unrest in Petrograd and suppression of the Bolsheviks, Kerensky succeeded [[Georgy Lvov|Prince Lvov]] as Russia's Prime Minister. Following the [[Kornilov Affair]] at the end of August and the resignation of the other ministers, he appointed himself Supreme [[Commander-in-Chief]] as well.

Kerensky's next move, on 15 September, was to proclaim Russia a republic, which was quite contrary to the understanding that the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] should only hold power until the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] should meet to decide Russia's form of rule. He formed a five-member Directory, which consisted of Kerensky himself, minister of foreign affairs [[Mikhail Tereshchenko]], minister of war General Verkhovsky, minister of navy Admiral [[Dmitry Verderevsky]] and minister of post and telegraph Nikitin. He retained his post in the final coalition government in October 1917 until it was overthrown by the Bolsheviks.

Kerensky's major challenge was that Russia was exhausted after three years of [[World War I|war]], while the provisional government did not offer much motivation for a victory outside of continuing Russia's obligations towards its allies. Russia's continued involvement in World War I was not popular among the lower and middle classes and especially the soldiers. They had all believed that Russia would stop fighting when the Provisional Government took power, now they all felt deceived. Furthermore, [[Lenin]] and his [[Bolshevik]] party were promising &quot;peace, land, and bread&quot; under a communist system. The army was disintegrating due to a lack of discipline, which fostered desertion in large numbers. By autumn 1917, an estimated two million men had unofficially left the army.

Kerensky and the other political leaders continued their obligation to Russia's allies by continuing involvement in World War I – fearing that the economy, already under huge stress from the war effort, might become increasingly unstable if vital supplies from France and the United Kingdom were to be cut off. Some also feared that [[Germany]] would demand enormous territorial concessions as the price for peace (which indeed happened in the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]). The dilemma of whether to withdraw was a great one, and Kerensky's inconsistent and impractical policies further destabilized the army and the country at large.

Furthermore, Kerensky adopted a policy that isolated the right-wing conservatives, both democratic and monarchist-oriented. His philosophy of &quot;no enemies to the left&quot; greatly empowered the Bolsheviks and gave them a free hand, allowing them to take over the military arm or &quot;voyenka&quot; of the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets. His arrest of Kornilov and other officers left him without strong allies against the Bolsheviks, who ended up being Kerensky's strongest and most determined adversaries, as opposed to the right wing, which evolved into the [[White movement]].

==== October Revolution of 1917 ====
During the [[Kornilov Affair]], Kerensky had distributed arms to the [[Petrograd]] workers, and by November most of these armed workers had gone over to the Bolsheviks. On {{OldStyleDateNY|6–7 November|25–26 October}} 1917 the Bolsheviks launched the second Russian revolution of the year. Kerensky's government in Petrograd had almost no support in the city. Only one small force, the [[Women's Battalion#Bolshevik Revolution|First Petrograd Women's Battalion]], also known as The Women's Death Battalion, was willing to fight for the government against the Bolsheviks, but this force too crossed over to the revolution without firing a single shot. It took less than 20 hours before the Bolsheviks had taken over the government.

Kerensky escaped the Bolsheviks and went to [[Pskov]], where he rallied some loyal troops for an attempt to retake the city. His troops managed to capture [[Tsarskoe Selo]], but were beaten the next day at [[Pulkovo]]. Kerensky narrowly escaped, and spent the next few weeks in hiding before fleeing the country, eventually arriving in [[France]]. During the [[Russian Civil War]] he supported neither side, as he opposed both the Bolshevik regime and the [[White Movement]].

==== Life in exile ====

[[File:Alexander Kerensky LOC hec 24467.jpg|thumb|left|1938]]
Kerensky lived in Paris until 1940, engaged in the endless splits and quarrels of the exiled Russian politicians. In 1939, Kerensky married the former Australian journalist Lydia ‘Nell' Tritton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A160496b.htm Tritton, Lydia Ellen (1899 - 1946) Biographical Entry - Australian Dictionary of Biography Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; When Germany occupied France in 1940, they emigrated to the United States.
Tritton and Kerensky married at [[Martins Creek, Pennsylvania]].

When his wife became terminally ill in 1945, he travelled with her to [[Brisbane]], Australia, and lived there with her family. She suffered a stroke in February, and he remained there until her death on 10 April 1946. Kerensky returned to the United States, where he spent the rest of his life.

When [[Adolf Hitler]]'s forces invaded the [[Soviet Union]] in 1941, Kerensky offered his support to [[Joseph Stalin]], but received no reply. Instead, he made broadcasts in Russian in support of the war effort.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Kerensky eventually settled in New York City, but spent much of his time at the [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]] in California, where he both used and contributed to the Institution's huge archive on [[Russian history]], and where he taught graduate courses. He wrote and broadcast extensively on Russian politics and history. His last public speech was delivered at [[Kalamazoo College]], in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]].

Kerensky died at his home in New York City in 1970, one of the last surviving major participants in the turbulent events of 1917. The [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|local Russian Orthodox Church]]es in New York refused to grant Kerensky burial, seeing him as being a [[freemason]] and being largely responsible for Russia falling to the Bolsheviks. A [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] also refused so Kerensky's body was flown to London where he was buried at [[Putney Vale Cemetery|Putney Vale]]'s non-denominational cemetery.

One of Kerensky's sons was the engineer [[Oleg Kerensky]].

'''Saint Ansgar''', '''Anskar''' or '''Oscar''', (September 8, 801 &amp;ndash; February 3, 865*, in Bremen) was an [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]]. The see of Hamburg was designated a &quot;Mission to bring Christianity to the [[Northern Europe|North]]&quot;, and Ansgar became known as the &quot;Apostle of the North&quot;.

==Life==
After his mother’s early death Ansgar was brought up in [[Corbie Abbey]], and made rapid progress in his education. According to the ''[[Vita Ansgari]]i'' (&quot;Life of Ansgar&quot;), when the little boy learned in a vision that his mother was in the company of [[Saint Mary]], his careless attitude toward spiritual matters changed to seriousness (&quot;Life of Ansgar&quot;, 1).   His pupil, successor, and eventual biographer [[Rimbert]] considered the visions of which this was the first to be the main motivation of the saint's life. 

Ansgar was a product of the phase of Christianization of [[Saxony]] (present day northern [[Germany]]) begun by [[Charlemagne]] and continued by his son and successor, [[Louis the Pious]]. When Saxony was no longer the focus of Christianization, what is now [[Denmark]] fell under the sweeping missionary gaze, with a group of monks including Ansgar sent back to [[Jutland]] with the baptized [[Jutes|Jutish]] king [[Harald Klak]]. Ansgar returned two years later after educating young boys who had been purchased because Harald had possibly been driven out of his kingdom. In 822 he was one of a number of missionaries sent to found the abbey of [[Corvey]] (New Corbie) in [[Westphalia]], and there became a teacher and preacher. Then in 829 in response to a request from the Swedish king [[Björn at Hauge]] for a mission to the [[Swedish people|Swedes]], Louis appointed Ansgar missionary.  With an assistant, the friar Witmar, he preached and made converts for six months at [[Birka]], on Lake [[Mälaren]].  They organized a small congregation there with the king's steward, Hergeir, as its most prominent member. In 831 he returned to Louis' court at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and was appointed to the [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Archbishopric of Hamburg]].

This was a new archbishopric with a see formed from those of [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Bremen]] and [[Verden, Germany|Verden]], plus the right to send missions into all the northern lands and to consecrate bishops for them. Ansgar was consecrated in November 831, and, the arrangements having been at once approved by [[Gregory IV]], went to Rome to receive the [[pallium]] directly at the hands of the pope and to be named legate for the northern lands. This commission had previously been bestowed upon [[Ebbo, Archbishop of Reims]], but the jurisdiction was divided by agreement, with Ebbo retaining Sweden for himself. For a time Ansgar devoted himself to the needs of his own diocese, which was still missionary territory with but a few churches. He founded a monastery and a school in Hamburg; the school was intended to serve the Danish mission, but accomplished little. 

After [[Louis the Pious|Louis]] died in 840, his empire was divided and Ansgar lost the abbey of [[Torhout|Turholt]], which had been given as an endowment for his work.  Then in 845 [[Danish people|the Danes]] unexpectedly sacked Hamburg, destroying all the church's treasures and books and leaving the entire diocese unrestorable.  Ansgar now had neither see nor revenue.   Many of his helpers deserted him, but the new king, [[Louis the German]], came to his aid; after failing to recover Turholt for him, in 847 he awarded him the vacant diocese of Bremen, where he took up residence in 848.  However, since Hamburg had been an archbishopric, the sees of Bremen and Hamburg were combined for him.  This presented canonical difficulties and also aroused the anger of the Bishop of Cologne, to whom Bremen had been subject, but after prolonged negotiations, [[Pope Nicholas I]] approved the union of the two dioceses in 864.

Through all this political turmoil, Ansgar continued his mission to the northern lands.  The Danish civil war compelled him  to establish good relations with two kings, [[Horik I|Horik the Elder]] and his son, [[Horik II]].  Both assisted him until his death (Wood, 124-125). He was able to secure recognition of Christianity as a tolerated religion and permission to build a church in [[Sleswick]]. He did not forget the Swedish mission, and spent two years there in person (848-850), at the critical moment when a pagan reaction was threatened, which he succeeded in averting. In 854 Ansgar returned to Sweden. Now a king [[Olof (I) of Sweden|Olof]] ruled in Birka. According to Rimbert, he was well disposed to Christianity. On a Viking raid to [[Apuole]] in [[Courland]], the Swedes prayed, and with God's help they plundered the [[Curonians]].

[[File:Erzbischof Ansgar 01 KMJ.jpg|thumb|left|Ansgar, statue in Hamburg.]]

Ansgar died in [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] in 865. 

His life story was written by his successor as archbishop, [[Rimbert]], in the ''[[Vita Ansgari]]i''.

==Visions==
  
Although a historical document and primary source written by a man whose existence can be proven historically, the ''[[Vita Ansgari]]i'' (&quot;The Life of Ansgar&quot;) aims above all to demonstrate Ansgar's sanctity. It is partly concerned with Ansgar's visions, which, according to the author Rimbert, encouraged and assisted Ansgar's remarkable missionary feats. 

Through the course of this work, Ansgar repeatedly embarks on a new stage in his career following a vision.  According to Rimbert, his early studies and ensuing devotion to the ascetic life of a monk were inspired by a vision of his mother in the presence of Saint Mary.  Again, when the Swedish people were left without a priest for some time, he begged King Horik to help him with this problem, then after receiving his consent, consulted with Bishop Gautbert to find a suitable man.  The two together sought the approval of King Louis, which he granted when he learned that they were in agreement on the issue.  Ansgar was convinced he was commanded by heaven to undertake this mission, and was influenced by a vision he received when he was concerned about the journey, in which he met a man who reassured him of his purpose and informed him of a prophet that he would meet, the [[abbot]] [[Adalhard]], who would instruct him in what was to happen.  In the vision, he searched for and found Adalhard, who commanded &quot;Islands, listen to me, pay attention, remotest peoples&quot;,  which Ansgar interpreted as God’s will that he go to the Scandinavian countries as &quot;most of that country consisted of islands, and also when, 'I will make you the light of the nations so that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth,' was added, since the end of the world in the north was in Swedish territory&quot; (''Life of Ansgar'', 17&amp;ndash;18).  

Statues dedicated to him stand in Hamburg and Copenhagen as well as a stone cross at [[Birka]]. A [[Impact crater|crater]] on the [[Moon]], [[Ansgarius (crater)|Ansgarius]], has been named for him. Ansgar is the patron saint of Denmark. His [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] is 3 February.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Automated theorem proving''' ('''ATP''') or '''automated deduction''', currently the most well-developed subfield of ''[[automated reasoning]]'' (AR), is the [[mathematical proof|proving]] of [[mathematical theorem]]s by a [[computer program]].

== Decidability of the problem ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
Depending on the underlying logic, the problem of deciding the validity of a formula varies from trivial to impossible. For the frequent case of [[propositional logic]], the problem is decidable but [[Co-NP-complete]], and hence only exponential-time algorithms are believed to exist for general proof tasks. For a [[first-order logic|first order predicate calculus]], with no (&quot;proper&quot;) axioms, [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] states that the theorems (provable statements) are exactly the logically valid [[well-formed formula]]s, so identifying valid formulas is [[recursively enumerable]]: given unbounded resources, any valid formula can eventually be proven.

However, ''invalid'' formulas (those that are ''not'' entailed by a given theory), cannot always be recognized. In addition, a consistent formal theory that contains the [[first-order theory]] of the [[natural numbers]] &lt;!-- Is this just Peano arithmetic, or what? --&gt; (thus having certain &quot;proper axioms&quot;), by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]], contains true statements which cannot be proven. In these cases, an automated theorem prover may fail to terminate while searching for a proof. Despite these theoretical limits, in practice, theorem provers can solve many hard problems, even in these undecidable logics.

== Related problems ==

A simpler, but related, problem is [[proof verification]], where an existing proof for a theorem is certified valid. For this, it is generally required that each individual proof step can be verified by a [[primitive recursive function]] or program, and hence the problem is always decidable.

''[[Interactive theorem proving|Interactive theorem provers]]'' require a human user to give hints to the system. Depending on the degree of automation, the prover can essentially be reduced to a proof checker, with the user providing the proof in a formal way, or significant proof tasks can be performed automatically. Interactive provers are used for a variety of tasks, but even fully automatic systems have proven a number of interesting and hard theorems, including some that have eluded human mathematicians for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=W.W. McCune|title=Solution of the Robbins Problem|journal=Journal of Automated Reasoning|year=1997|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h77246751668616h/|volume=19|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Computer Math Proof Shows Reasoning Power|author=Gina Kolata|date=December 10, 1996|url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/1210math.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these successes are sporadic, and work on hard problems usually requires a proficient user.

Another distinction is sometimes drawn between theorem proving and other techniques, where a process is considered to be theorem proving if it consists of a traditional proof, starting with axioms and producing new inference steps using rules of inference.  Other techniques would include [[model checking]], which is equivalent to brute-force enumeration of many possible states (although the actual implementation of model checkers requires much cleverness, and does not simply reduce to brute force).

There are hybrid theorem proving systems which use model checking as an inference rule. There are also programs which were written to prove a particular theorem, with a (usually informal) proof that if the program finishes with a certain result, then the theorem is true. A good example of this was the machine-aided proof of the [[four color theorem]], which was very controversial as the first claimed mathematical proof which was essentially impossible to verify by humans due to the enormous size of the program's calculation (such proofs are called [[non-surveyable proofs]]).  Another example would be the proof that the game [[Connect Four]] is a win for the first player.

== Industrial uses ==

Commercial use of automated theorem proving is mostly concentrated in integrated circuit design and verification.  Since the [[Pentium FDIV bug]], the complicated [[floating point unit]]s of modern microprocessors have been designed with extra scrutiny.  Nowadays{{When|date=February 2011}}, [[AMD]], [[Intel]] and others use automated theorem proving to verify that division and other operations are correctly implemented in their processors.

==First-order theorem proving==

Classical [[First-order logic|first-order]] theorem proving is one of the most mature subfields of automated theorem proving. The logic is expressive enough to allow the specification of arbitrary problems, often in a reasonably natural and intuitive way. On the other hand, it is still semi-decidable, and a number of sound and complete calculi have been developed, enabling ''fully'' automated systems. More expressive logics, such as higher order and modal logics, allow the convenient expression of a wider range of problems than first order logic, but theorem proving for these logics is less well developed.

==Benchmarks and competitions==
The quality of implemented system has benefited from the existence of a large library of standard benchmark examples — the Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers (TPTP) Problem Library&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/&lt;/ref&gt; — as well as from the [[CADE ATP System Competition]] (CASC), a yearly competition of first-order systems for many important classes of first-order problems.

Some important systems (all have won at least one CASC competition division) are listed below.
* [[E theorem prover|E]] is a high-performance prover for full first-order logic, but built on a [[superposition calculus|purely equational calculus]], developed primarily in the automated reasoning group of [[Technical University of Munich]].
* [[Otter (theorem prover)|Otter]], developed at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]], is the first widely used high-performance theorem prover. It is based on [[first-order resolution]] and [[paramodulation]]. Otter has since been replaced by [[Prover9 theorem prover|Prover9]], which is paired with [[Mace4]].
* [[SETHEO]] is a high-performance system based on the goal-directed [[model elimination]] calculus. It is developed in the automated reasoning group of Technical University of Munich. E and SETHEO have been combined (with other systems) in the composite theorem prover E-SETHEO.
* [[Vampire theorem prover|Vampire]] is developed and implemented at [http://www.manchester.ac.uk/ Manchester University] by [http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~voronkov/ Andrei Voronkov], formerly together with [http://www.freewebs.com/riazanov/ Alexandre Riazanov]. It has won the &quot;world cup for theorem provers&quot; (the CADE ATP System Competition) in the most prestigious CNF (MIX) division for eleven years (1999, 2001–2010).
* Waldmeister is a specialized system for unit-equational first-order logic. It has won the CASC UEQ division for the last fourteen years (1997–2010).
* [[SPASS]] is a first order logic theorem prover with equality. This is developed by the  research group Automation of Logic, [[Max-Planck Institute for Informatik Saarbrucken.]]

==Deontic theorem proving==

[[Deontic logic]] concerns normative propositions, such as those used in law, engineering specifications, and computer programs. In other words, propositions that are translations of commands or &quot;ought&quot; or &quot;must (not)&quot; statements in ordinary language. The deontic character of such logic requires formalism that extends the first-order predicate calculus. Representative of this is the tool KED.&lt;ref&gt;Artosi, Alberto, Cattabriga, Paola and Governatori, Guido (1994-01-01). KED: A Deontic Theorem Prover.

'''Agent Orange''' is the code name for one of the [[herbicide]]s and [[defoliant]]s used by the [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] as part of its [[herbicidal warfare]] program, [[Operation Ranch Hand]], during the [[Vietnam War]] from 1961 to 1971. Vietnam estimates 400,000 people being killed or maimed, and 500,000 children born with [[birth defects]].&lt;ref name=&quot;last-ghost&quot;&gt;York,Geoffrey; Mick, Hayley; [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080711.worange1107/BNStory/Front/home/?pageRequested=all &quot;Last Ghost of the Vietnam War&quot;], ''The Globe and Mail'', July 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A 50:50 mixture of [[2,4,5-T]] and [[2,4-D]], it was manufactured for the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] primarily by [[Monsanto Corporation]] and [[Dow Chemical]]. The [[2,4,5-T]] used to produce Agent Orange was later discovered to be contaminated with [[2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin]], an extremely toxic [[dioxin compound]]. It was given its name from the color of the orange-striped [[Drum (container)|55 US gallon (200 L) barrels]] in which it was shipped, and was by far the most widely used of the so-called &quot;[[Rainbow Herbicides]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hay-1982-p151&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Agent-orange-deformities-vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Vietnamese man born with deformed face as a result of prenatal exposure to Agent Orange.]]

During the Vietnam War, between 1962 and 1971, the United States military sprayed {{convert|20000000|USgal|L|sigfig=1}} of chemical herbicides and defoliants in Vietnam, eastern Laos and parts of Cambodia, as part of [[Operation Ranch Hand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pellow-2007-159&quot;&gt;Pellow, David N. [http://books.google.com/books?id=dhtco1U2AwYC&amp;pg=PA159 ''Resisting Global Toxics: Transnational Movements for Environmental Justice''], MIT Press, 2007, p. 159, (ISBN 0-262-16244-X).&lt;/ref&gt; The program's goal was to defoliate forested and rural land, depriving guerrillas of cover; another goal was to induce [[forced draft urbanization]], destroying the ability of peasants to support themselves in the countryside, and forcing them to flee to the U.S. dominated cities, thus depriving the guerrillas of their rural support base and food supply.&lt;ref name=&quot;stellman-2003-681-687&quot;&gt;Stellman et al. 2003: pp 681–687&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kolko-144-145&quot; /&gt;

The US began to target food crops in October 1962, primarily using [[Agent Blue]]. In 1965, 42 percent of all herbicide spraying was dedicated to food crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;kolko-144-145&quot; /&gt; Rural-to-urban migration rates dramatically increased in South Vietnam, as peasants escaped the destruction and [[famine]] in the countryside by fleeing to the U.S.-dominated cities. The urban population in South Vietnam more than tripled: from 2.8 million people in 1958, to 8 million by 1971. The rapid flow of people led to a fast-paced and uncontrolled [[urbanization]]; an estimated 1.5 million people were living in [[Saigon]] [[slums]], while many South Vietnamese elites and U.S. personnel lived in luxury.&lt;ref name=&quot;pp. 4&quot;&gt;Luong, 2003: [http://books.google.com/books?id=AkIhYEavBrEC&amp;pg=PA4 pp. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Air Force records show that at least 6,542 spraying missions took place over the course of Operation Ranch Hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Furukawa 2004 143&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Furukawa|first=Hisao|title=Ecological destruction, health, and development: advancing Asian paradigms|publisher=Trans Pacific Press|year=2004|isbn=9781920901011|page=143|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jPL4wSfgan4C&amp;pg=PA143}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1971, 12 percent of the total area of South Vietnam had been sprayed with defoliating chemicals, which were often applied at rates that were 13 times as high as the legal USDA limit.&lt;ref name=&quot;sbsg-1971-p36&quot;&gt;SBSG, 1971: [http://books.google.com/books?id=agsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA36 p. 36]&lt;/ref&gt; In South Vietnam alone, an estimated 10 million [[hectares]] of agricultural land were ultimately destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;luong-2003-p3&quot;&gt;Luong, 2003: [http://books.google.com/books?id=AkIhYEavBrEC&amp;pg=PA3 p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas TCDD concentrations in soil and water were hundreds of times greater than the levels considered &quot;safe&quot; by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fawthrop-war-against&quot;&gt;Fawthrop, Tom; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3798581.stm &quot;Vietnam's war against Agent Orange&quot;], ''BBC News'', June 14, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fawthrop-suffering&quot;&gt;Fawthrop, Tom; [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/feb/10/agentofsuffering &quot;Agent of Suffering&quot;], ''Guardian'', February 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, more than 20% of South Vietnam's forests were sprayed at least once over a nine year period.&lt;ref name=&quot;kolko-144-145&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kolko|first=Gabriel|title=Anatomy of a War: Vietnam, the United States, and the Modern Historical Experience|publisher=New Press|year=1994|isbn=1-56584-218-9|pages=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical description and toxicology==

[[File:2,4,5-T.svg|thumb|left|2,4,5-T]]

Chemically, Agent Orange is an approximately 1:1 mixture of two [[phenoxyl herbicide]]s – [[2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] ('''2,4-D''') and [[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] ('''2,4,5-T''') – in [[ester|iso-octyl ester]] form.&lt;ref&gt;IOM, 1994: [http://books.google.com/books?id=2YQTHJlt5l4C&amp;pg=PA90 p. 90]&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous studies have examined health effects linked to Agent Orange, its component compounds, and its manufacturing byproducts.&lt;ref name=&quot;frumkin&quot;&gt;Frumkin, 2003: [http://caonline.amcancersoc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12924777 pp.245–255]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the controversy surrounding Agent Orange, there was already a large body of scientific evidence linking 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D to serious negative health effects and ecological damage.&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=1iCHpk2fZksC&amp;pg=PA2 p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1969, it was revealed to the public that the 2,4,5-T was contaminated with a dioxin, [[tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin]] ('''TCDD'''), and that the TCDD was causing many of the previously unexplained adverse health effects which were correlated with Agent Orange exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=1iCHpk2fZksC&amp;pg=PA6 p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt; TCDD has been described as &quot;perhaps the most toxic molecule ever synthesized by man&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schuck&quot;&gt;Schuck, 1987: [http://books.google.com/books?id=waTdqLYCyPMC&amp;pg=PA18 p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt; Internal memoranda revealed Monsanto Corporation (a manufacturer of 2,4,5-T) had informed the U.S. government as early as 1952 that 2,4,5-T was contaminated with a toxic chemical.&lt;ref&gt;Schuck, 1987: [http://books.google.com/books?id=waTdqLYCyPMC&amp;pg=PA17 p. 17]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the Yale [[biologist]] Arthur Galston, who specialized in herbicide research, published a review of what was known at the time about the toxicity of TCDD. Even &quot;vanishingly small&quot; quantities of dioxin in the diet caused adverse health effects when [[animal research|tested on animals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schuck&quot; /&gt; Since then, TCDD has been comprehensively studied. It has been associated with increased [[neoplasms]] in every animal [[bioassay]] reported in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;dwyer-flesch&quot;&gt;Dwyer and Flesch-Janys, [http://ajph.aphapublications.org/cgi/reprint/85/4/476.pdf &quot;Editorial: Agent Orange in Vietnam&quot;], [[American Journal of Public Health]], April 1995, Vol 85. No. 4, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt; The National Toxicology Program has classified TCDD as &quot;known to be a human [[carcinogen]]&quot;, frequently associated with [[soft tissue sarcoma|soft-tissue sarcoma]], [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]], [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/index.cfm?objectid=D3D7DB18-F1F6-975E-716813304ED78D8B Committee Recommendations: 2,3,7,8- Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NTP, 2006: {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the two herbicides that make up Agent Orange, 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, remain toxic over a short period—a scale of days or weeks—they quickly degrade. A 1969 report authored by K. Diane Courtney and others found 2,4,5-T could cause birth defects and stillbirths in mice.&lt;ref&gt;Buckingham, 1992: ''Chapter IX – Ranch Hand Ends''&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have shown an increased rate of cancer mortality for workers exposed to 2,4,5-T. In one such study, from [[Hamburg, Germany]], the risk of cancer mortality increased by 170% after working for 10 years at the 2,4,5-T-producing section of a Hamburg manufacturing plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;dwyer-flesch&quot; /&gt; Three studies have suggested prior exposure to Agent Orange poses an increased risk of [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] in the children of Vietnam veterans.&lt;ref name=&quot;frumkin&quot; /&gt;

Starting in 1991, the US Congress asked the [[Institute of Medicine]] to review the scientific literature on Agent Orange and the other herbicides used in Vietnam, including their active ingredients and the dioxin contaminant. The IOM found an association between dioxin exposure and [[diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;IOM, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=11906 &quot;Data Suggest a Possible Association Between Agent Orange Exposure and Hypertension&quot;], ''[http://www.nationalacademies.org/newsroom/ Office of News and Public Information]'', [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. Quote: &quot;the report also concluded that there is suggestive but limited evidence that AL amyloidosis is associated with herbicide exposure&quot;] (accessed:19 May 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early development==
In 1943 plant biologist [[Arthur Galston]] began studying the compound [[triiodobenzoic acid]] as a plant growth hormone, in an attempt to adapt [[soybean]]s to a short growing season. Galston found that excessive usage of the compound caused catastrophic defoliation&amp;nbsp;— a finding later used by his colleague Ian Sussex to develop the family of herbicides used in Operation Ranch Hand.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Jeremy; [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/23/us/23galston.html?ref=us Arthur Galston, Agent Orange Researcher, Is Dead at 88 – Obituary] ''New York Times'', June 23, 2008 (accessed August 18, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Galston was especially concerned about the compound's side effects to humans and the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;galston-light&quot;&gt;Peterson, Doug [http://www.las.illinois.edu/alumni/magazine/articles/2004/galston Arthur W. Galston: Matters of Light], ''LASNews Magazine'', [[University of Illinois]], Spring 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, the U.S. Department of the Army contracted the University of Chicago to study the effects of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T on cereal grains (including rice) and broadleaf crops. From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply. In early 1945, the U.S. army ran tests of various 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T mixtures at the [[Bushnell Army Airfield]] in [[Florida]], which is now listed as a [[Formerly Used Defense Site]] (FUDS).&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=1iCHpk2fZksC&amp;pg=PA24 p.24]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p. 111&quot;&gt;Verwey, 1977: [http://books.google.com/books?id=QgmHOdIjITsC&amp;pg=PA111 p. 111]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Vietnam War, between 1962 and 1971, the United States military sprayed {{convert|20000000|USgal|L|sigfig=1}} of chemical herbicides and defoliants in Vietnam, eastern Laos and parts of Cambodia, as part of the aerial defoliation program known as [[Operation Ranch Hand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pellow-2007-159&quot; /&gt; The goal was to defoliate rural/forested land, depriving guerrillas of food and cover and clearing in sensitive areas such as around base perimeters.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Spencer. Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: Political, Social and Military History. ABC-CLIO, Inc. Santa Barbara. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The program was also a part of a general policy of [[forced draft urbanization]], which aimed to destroy the ability of peasants to support themselves in the countryside, forcing them to flee to the U.S. dominated cities, depriving the guerrillas of their rural support base.&lt;ref name=&quot;stellman-2003-681-687&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kolko-144-145&quot; /&gt;

Spraying was usually done either from helicopters or from low-flying [[C-123 Provider]] aircraft, fitted with sprayers and &quot;MC-1 Hourglass&quot; pump systems and {{convert|1000|USgal|L|abbr=on}} chemical tanks. Spray runs were also conducted from trucks, boats, and backpack sprayers.&lt;ref&gt;Schuck, 1987: [http://books.google.com/books?id=waTdqLYCyPMC&amp;pg=PA16 p. 16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerCauses/OtherCarcinogens/IntheWorkplace/agent-orange-and-cancer?sitearea=PED Agent Orange and Cancer], ''American Cancer Society'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=1iCHpk2fZksC&amp;pg=PA26 p. 26]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first batch of herbicides was unloaded at Tan Son Nhut Airbase in South Vietnam, on January 9, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;hay-1982-p151&quot;&gt;Hay, 1982: [http://books.google.com/books?id=V524J4zh06MC&amp;pg=PA151 p. 151]&lt;/ref&gt; Air Force records show at least 6,542 spraying missions took place over the course of Operation Ranch Hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Furukawa 2004 143&quot;/&gt; By 1971, 12 percent of the total area of South Vietnam had been sprayed with defoliating chemicals, which were often applied at rates that were 13 times higher than the legal USDA limit.&lt;ref name=&quot;sbsg-1971-p36&quot; /&gt; In South Vietnam alone, an estimated 10 million [[hectares]] of agricultural land were ultimately destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;luong-2003-p3&quot; /&gt; In some areas, TCDD concentrations in soil and water were hundreds of times greater than the levels considered safe by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fawthrop-war-against&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fawthrop-suffering&quot; /&gt;

The campaign destroyed {{convert|5|e6acre|km2|sigfig=1}} of upland and mangrove forests and millions of acres of crops. Overall, more than 20% of South Vietnam's forests were sprayed at least once over a nine year period.&lt;ref name=&quot;kolko-144-145&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;verwey-113&quot; /&gt;

In 1965, members of the U.S. Congress were told &quot;crop destruction is understood to be the more important purpose ... but the emphasis is usually given to the jungle defoliation in public mention of the program.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;verwey-113&quot;&gt;Verwey, 1977: [http://books.google.com/books?id=QgmHOdIjITsC&amp;pg=PA113 p. 113]&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers were told they were destroying crops because they were going to be used to feed guerrillas. They later discovered nearly all of the food they had been destroying was not being produced for guerrillas; it was, in reality, only being grown to support the local civilian population. For example, in Quang Ngai province, 85% of the crop lands were scheduled to be destroyed in 1970 alone. Widespread famine occurred as a result, leaving hundreds of thousands of people malnourished or starving.&lt;ref&gt;Verwey, 1977: [http://books.google.com/books?id=QgmHOdIjITsC&amp;pg=PA116 p. 116]&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. military began targeting food crops in October 1962, primarily using [[Agent Blue]]; the American public was not made aware of the crop destruction programs until 1965 (and it was then believed that crop spraying had begun that spring). In 1965, 42 percent of all herbicide spraying was dedicated to food crops. The first official acknowledgement of the programs came from the [[State Department]] in March 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;kolko-144-145&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p. 111&quot;/&gt;

Many experts at the time, including Arthur Galston, the biologist who developed and intensively studied TCDD, opposed herbicidal warfare, due to concerns about the side effects to humans and the environment by indiscriminately spraying the chemical over a wide area. As early as 1966, resolutions were introduced to the [[United Nations]] charging that the U.S. was violating the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]], which regulated the use of chemical and biological weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;galston-light&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schuck, 1987: [http://books.google.com/books?id=waTdqLYCyPMC&amp;pg=PA19 p. 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on the Vietnamese people===
====Health effects====
[[File:Agent-Orange-dioxin-skin-damage-Vietnam.jpg|thumb|left|Major Tự Đức Phang (from Khanh Hoa Province), looking at his portrait taken before he joined the Vietnamese army. In 1973, he fought at the southern battlefield and participated in saving the weapon store in Nha Trang (Khanh Hoa). Twelve years later, Phang saw large, black and red spots and water bubbles appearing on his body and all his hair had fallen out, which was caused by exposure to dioxin-contaminated Agent Orange]]

The Vietnam Red Cross reported as many as 3 million Vietnamese people have been affected by Agent Orange, including at least 150,000 children born with birth defects.&lt;ref name=&quot;va-03-2010&quot; /&gt; According to Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 4.8 million Vietnamese people were exposed to Agent Orange, resulting in 400,000 people being killed or maimed, and 500,000 children born with birth defects.&lt;ref name=&quot;last-ghost&quot; /&gt;

Children in the areas where Agent Orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems, including cleft palate, mental disabilities, hernias, and [[Polydactyly|extra fingers and toes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Agent Orange blights Vietnam&quot;/&gt; In the 1970s, high levels of dioxin were found in the [[breast milk]] of South Vietnamese women, and in the blood of U.S. soldiers who had served in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thornton|first=Joe|title=Pandora's Poison: Chlorine, Health, and a New Environmental Strategy|publisher=MIT Press|year=2001|isbn=9780262700849|page=190|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=n_tXscNndysC&amp;pg=PA190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most affected zones are the mountainous area along Truong Son (Long Mountains) and the border between Vietnam and Cambodia. The affected residents are living in substandard conditions with many genetic diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.gov.vn/ Vietnam Ministry of Foreign Affairs] – ''[http://www.mofa.gov.vn/vi/tt_baochi/nr041126171753/ns050118101044 Support Agent Orange Victims]'' in Vietnamese.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Agent-orange-dead-deformed-babies.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] babies, [[birth defect|deformed]] and [[stillbirth|stillborn]] as a result of prenatal [[dioxin]] exposure from Agent Orange]]

About 28 of the former US military bases in Vietnam where the herbicides were stored and loaded onto airplanes still have high level of dioxins in the soil, posing a health threat to the surrounding communities. These 'hotspots' have dioxin contamination up to 350 times higher than international recommendations for action. The contaminated soil and sediment continue to affect the citizens of Vietnam, poisoning their food chain and causing illnesses, serious skin diseases and a variety of cancers in the lungs, larynx, and prostate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agent Orange blights Vietnam&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/227467.stm|work=BBC News|title=Agent Orange blights Vietnam|date=December 3, 1998|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ecological effects====
About 17.8% (3,100,000 ha) of the total forested area of Vietnam was sprayed during the war, which dramatically disrupted ecological equilibrium. Furthermore, the persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of protective tree cover, and loss of seeding forest stock, meant reforestation was difficult or impossible in many areas.&lt;ref&gt;Furukawa, 2004: [http://books.google.com/books?id=jPL4wSfgan4C&amp;pg=PA215 p. 215]&lt;/ref&gt; Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species, such as [[bamboo]] and [[cogon grass]], which make it unlikely the forests will be able to regenerate. Animal species [[biodiversity|diversity]] was also significantly impacted: in one study, a Harvard biologist found 24 species of birds and 5 species of [[mammals]] in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species of mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chiras, Daniel D.|title=Environmental science|year=2010|edition=8th|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett|isbn=9780763759254|page=499|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L28bHnPXo1AC&amp;pg=PA499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dioxins from Agent Orange have persisted in the Vietnamese environment since the war, migrating through soil and being transported by a variety of natural processes into the water supply. Movement of dioxins through the [[food web]] has resulted in [[bioconcentration]] and [[biomagnification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vallero, Daniel A.|title=Biomedical ethics for engineers: ethics and decision making in biomedical and biosystem engineering|year=2007|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780750682275|page=73|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AeT56Pi8LFYC&amp;pg=PA73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The areas most heavily contaminated with dioxins are the sites of former U.S. air bases.&lt;ref&gt;Furukawa, 2004: [http://books.google.com/books?id=jPL4wSfgan4C&amp;pg=PA221 pp. 221–222]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sociopolitical effects====
The [[RAND Corporation]]'s ''Memorandum 5446-ISA/ARPA'' states: &quot;the fact that the VC obtain most of their food from the neutral rural population dictates the destruction of civilian crops ... if they (the VC) are to be hampered by the crop destruction program, it will be necessary to destroy large portions of the rural economy – probably 50% or more&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Verwey, 1977: [http://books.google.com/books?id=QgmHOdIjITsC&amp;pg=PA115 p.115]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rural-to-urban migration rates dramatically increased in South Vietnam, as peasants escaped the destruction in the countryside by fleeing to the U.S.-dominated cities. The urban population in South Vietnam more than tripled: from 2.8 million people in 1958, to 8 million by 1971. The rapid flow of people led to a fast-paced and uncontrolled urbanization; an estimated 1.5 million people were living in Saigon slums, while many South Vietnamese elites and U.S. personnel lived in luxury.&lt;ref name=&quot;pp. 4&quot;/&gt;

===Effects on U.S. veterans===

Studies of veterans who served in the South during the war have increased rates of cancer, nerve, digestive, skin and respiratory disorders. Veterans from the south had higher rates of throat cancer, acute/chronic leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, soft tissue sarcoma and liver cancer. Other than liver cancer, these are the same conditions the US Veteran's Administration has found to be associated with exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin, and are on the list of conditions eligible for compensation and treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;va-03-2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/diseases.asp |title=Agent Orange: Diseases Associated with Agent Orange Exposure |publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Public Health and Environmental Hazards |date=March 25, 2010 |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military personnel who loaded airplanes and helicopters used in Ranch Hand probably sustained some of the heaviest exposures. Members of the [[Army Chemical Corps]], who stored and mixed herbicides and defoliated the perimeters of military bases, are also thought to have had some of the heaviest exposures. Others with potentially heavy exposures included members of [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] units who defoliated remote campsites, and members of [[U.S. Navy]] river units who cleared base perimeters.&lt;ref&gt;Frumkin, 2003: p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Military members who served on [[Okinawa]] also claim to have been exposed to the chemical.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Jon, &quot;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20110412zg.html Evidence for Agent Orange on Okinawa]&quot;, ''[[Japan Times]]'', 12 April 2011, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Vietnam, the veterans were told not to worry, and were persuaded the chemical was harmless.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann, Kenneth J.; [http://politicalaffairs.net/article/articleview/3299/ &quot;Killing Me Softly: How Agent Orange Murders Vietnam's Children&quot;], ''Political Affairs'', April 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; After returning home, Vietnam veterans began to suspect their ill health or the instances of their wives having miscarriages or children born with birth defects may be related to Agent Orange and the other toxic herbicides to which they were exposed in Vietnam. Veterans began to file claims in 1977 to the Department of Veterans Affairs for disability payments for health care for conditions they believed were associated with exposure to Agent Orange, or more specifically, dioxin, but their claims were denied unless they could prove the condition began when they were in the service or within one year of their discharge.

By April 1993, the Department of Veterans Affairs had only compensated 486 victims, although it had received disability claims from 39,419 soldiers who had been exposed to Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Fleischer|first1=Doris Zames|last2=Zames|first2=Freida|title=The disability rights movement: from charity to confrontation|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2001|isbn=9781566398121|page=178|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3t84d8tLEVcC&amp;pg=PA178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal and diplomatic proceedings===
====US veterans class action lawsuit against manufacturers====
Since at least 1978, several lawsuits have been filed against the companies which produced Agent Orange, among them [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow Chemical]], [[Monsanto Company|Monsanto]], and [[Diamond Shamrock]].

[[Hy Mayerson]] of the [[law firm]] [[The Mayerson Law Offices, P.C.]] was an early pioneer in Agent Orange litigation, working with renowned [[environmentalism|environmental attorney]] [[Victor Yannacone]] in 1980 on the first class-action suits against wartime manufacturers of Agent Orange. In meeting Dr. Ronald A. Codario, one of the first civilian doctors to see afflicted patients, Mayerson, so impressed by the fact an M.D. would show so much interest in a Vietnam veteran, forwarded more than a thousand pages of information on Agent Orange and the effects of dioxin on animals and humans to Codario's office the day after he was first contacted by the doctor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Wilcox, 1983: {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corporate defendants sought to escape culpability by blaming everything on the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Scott|first=Wilbur J.|title=The Politics of Readjustment: Vietnam Veterans Since the War|publisher=Transaction|year=1993|isbn=9780202304069|page=130|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YLg8rVfYO9EC&amp;pg=PA130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mayerson Law Offices, P.C., with Sgt. [[Charles E. Hartz]] as their principal client, filed the first Agent Orange class action lawsuit, in [[Pennsylvania]] in 1980, for the injuries soldiers in Vietnam suffered through exposure to toxic dioxins in the Agent Orange [[defoliant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1347&amp;dat=19800125&amp;id=ZdMSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0_oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5065,3012612 ''Dying Veteran May Speak From Beyond The Grave In Court: [[Lakeland Ledger]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney Hy Mayerson co-wrote the brief that certified the Agent Orange Product Liability action as a [[class action]], the largest ever filed as of its filing.&lt;ref&gt;Croft, Steve; [http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=270939 Agent Orange], ''CBS Evening News'', May 7, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Hartz's [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] was one of the first ever taken in America, and the first for an Agent Orange trial, for the purpose of preserving [[testimony]] at trial, as it was understood that Hartz would not live to see the trial because of the [[brain tumor]] that began to develop while he was a member of [[Tiger Force]], [[Special Forces]], and [[LRRPs]] in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayerson.com/html/about.html |title=The Mayerson Law Offices |publisher=The Mayerson Law Offices |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pottsmerc.com/ Pottstown Mercury]&lt;/ref&gt; The firm also located and supplied critical research to the Veterans’ lead expert, Dr. Ronald A. Codario, M.D., including about 100 hundred articles from toxicology journals dating back more than a decade, as well as data about where herbicides had been sprayed, what the effects of dioxin had been on animals and humans, and every accident in factories where herbicides were produced or dioxin was a contaminant of some chemical reaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In 1984, the class-action suit was settled out of court for $180 million; slightly over 45% of this was ordered to be paid by Monsanto alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editors=Stanley, Jay; Blair, John D.|title=Challenges in military health care: perspectives on health status and the provision of care| publisher=Transaction Publishers| year=1993|isbn=9781560006503|page=164| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8k-WIJYwIF4C&amp;pg=PA164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Harrington|first=John C.|title=The challenge to power: money, investing, and democracy|publisher=Chelsea Green Publisher|year=2005|isbn=9781931498975|page=260|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wGgeiQvijI8C&amp;pg=PT260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many veterans who were victims of Agent Orange exposure were outraged the case had been settled instead of going to court, and felt they had been betrayed by the lawyers. &quot;Fairness Hearings&quot; were held in five major American cities, where veterans and their families discussed their reactions to the settlement, and condemned the actions of the lawyers and courts, demanding the case be heard before a jury of their peers. Federal Judge Julius Weinstein refused the appeals, claiming the settlement was &quot;fair and just&quot;. By 1989, the veterans' fears were confirmed when it was decided how the money from the settlement would be paid out. A totally disabled Vietnam veteran would receive a maximum of $12,000 spread out over the course of 10 years. Furthermore, by accepting the settlement payments, disabled veterans would become ineligible for many state benefits that provided far more monetary support than the settlement, such as food stamps, public assistance, and government pensions. A widow of a Vietnam veteran who died of Agent Orange exposure would only receive $3700.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford-milhist-725&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|editor1=Chambers, John Whiteclay|editor2=Anderson, Fred|title=The Oxford companion to American military history|chapter=Toxic Agents: Agent Orange Exposure|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999| isbn=9780195071986|page=725| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_Rzy_yNMKbcC&amp;pg=PA725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Jill Montgomery, a spokesperson for Monsanto, said Monsanto should not be liable at all for injuries or deaths caused by Agent Orange, saying: &quot;We are sympathetic with people who believe they have been injured and understand their concern to find the cause, but reliable scientific evidence indicates that Agent Orange is not the cause of serious long-term health effects.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Agent Orange Victims Sue Monsanto| last=Fawthrop|first=Tom| work=CorpWatch|date=November 4, 2004|url=http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=11638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Jersey Agent Orange Commission====
In 1980, [[New Jersey]] created the New Jersey Agent Orange Commission, the first state commission created to study its effects. The commission's research project in association with [[Rutgers University]] was called &quot;The Pointman Project&quot;. It was disbanded by Governor [[Christine Todd Whitman]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, July 3, 1996{{Clarify|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Pointman I, commission researchers devised ways to determine small dioxin levels in blood. Prior to this, such levels could only be found in the [[adipose tissue|adipose (fat) tissue]]. The project compared dioxin levels in a small group of Vietnam veterans who had been exposed to Agent Orange with a group of matched veterans who had not served in Vietnam. The results of this project were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the American Medical Association'', Vol. 259 No. 11, March 18, 1988{{Clarify|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second phase of the project continued to examine and compare dioxin levels in various groups of Vietnam veterans, including [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and [[Brownwater Navy|brown water riverboat Navy]] personnel.

====US Congress====
In 1991, the US Congress enacted the [[Agent Orange Act]], giving the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] the authority to declare certain conditions 'presumptive' to exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin, making these veterans who served in Vietnam eligible to receive treatment and compensation for these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.va.gov/AgentOrange/ Agent Orange – Office of Public Health and Environmental Hazards]&lt;/ref&gt; The same law required the National Academy of Sciences to periodically review the science on dioxin and herbicides used in Vietnam to inform the Secretary of Veterans Affairs about the strength of the scientific evidence showing association between exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin and certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ocga/laws/PL102-4.asp PL 102-4 and The National Academy of Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this process, the list of 'presumptive' conditions has grown since 1991, and currently the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has listed prostate cancer, respiratory cancers, multiple myeloma, type II diabetes, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma, [[chloracne]], porphyria cutanea tarda, peripheral neuropathy, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and spina bifida in children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange as conditions associated with exposure to the herbicide. This list now includes B cell leukemias, such as hairy cell leukemia, Parkinson's disease and ischemic heart disease, these last three having been added on August 31, 2010. Several highly placed individuals in government are voicing concerns about whether some of the diseases on the list should, in fact, actually have been included.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2010/08/ap-aging-vets-concern-083110/|title=Costs of aging vets concern deficit commission|last=Baker|first=Mike|date=September 2, 2010|work=The Air Force Times|accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S./Vietnamese government negotiations====
[[File:Two Vietnameses pose in front of the billboard.jpg|thumb|right|Handicapped Vietnamese boy posing in front of the billboard denouncing [[Operation Ranch Hand]]]]

In 2002, Vietnam and the US held a joint conference on Human Health and Environmental Impacts of Agent Orange. Following the conference, the US [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] (NIEHS) began scientific exchanges between the US and Vietnam, and began discussions for a joint research project on the human health impacts of Agent Orange.

These negotiations broke down in 2005, when neither side could agree on the research protocol and the research project was cancelled. More progress has been made on the environmental front. In 2003, the first US-Vietnam workshop on remediation of dioxin was held.

Starting in 2005, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency‎]] (EPA) began to work with the Vietnamese government to measure the level of dioxin at the [[Da Nang Airbase]]. Also in 2005, the Joint Advisory Committee on Agent Orange, made up of representatives of Vietnamese and US government agencies, was established. The committee has been meeting yearly to explore areas of scientific cooperation, technical assistance and environmental remediation of dioxin.

A breakthrough in the diplomatic stalemate on this issue occurred as a result of United States President George W. Bush's state visit to Vietnam in November 2006. In the joint statement, President Bush and [[President Triet]] agreed &quot;further joint efforts to address the environmental contamination near former dioxin storage sites would make a valuable contribution to the continued development of their bilateral relationship.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Joint Statement Between the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the United States of America. Pres. George W Bush Whitehouse Press office. Accessed December 31, 2008. (original no longer available PDF available at http://www.warlegacies.org/Bush.pdf.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In late May 2007, President Bush signed into law a supplemental spending bill for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan that included an earmark of $3 million specifically for funding for programs for the remediation of dioxin 'hotspots' on former US military bases, and for public health programs for the surrounding communities;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, May 2009: {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; some authors consider this to be completely inadequate, pointing out that the U.S. airbase in [[Da Nang]], alone, will cost $14 million to clean up, and that three others are estimated to require $60 million for cleanup.&lt;ref name=&quot;fawthrop-suffering&quot; /&gt; The appropriation was renewed in the fiscal year 2009 and again in FY 2010.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

On January 31, 2004, a [[victim's rights group]], the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange/dioxin (VAVA), filed a lawsuit in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] in [[Brooklyn]], against several U.S. companies for liability in causing personal injury, by developing and producing the chemical. Dow Chemical and Monsanto were the two largest producers of Agent Orange for the U.S. military, and were named in the suit, along with the dozens of other companies (Diamond Shamrock, Uniroyal, Thompson Chemicals, Hercules, etc.). On March 10, 2005, Judge [[Jack B. Weinstein]] of the Eastern District – who had presided over the 1984 US veterans class action lawsuit – dismissed the lawsuit, ruling there was no legal basis for the [[plaintiff|plaintiffs']] claims. He concluded Agent Orange was not considered a poison under [[international law]] at the time of its use by the U.S.; the U.S. was not prohibited from using it as a herbicide; and the companies which produced the substance were not liable for the method of its use by the government. The U.S. government was not a party in the lawsuit, due to [[sovereign immunity]], and the court ruled the chemical companies, as contractors of the US government, shared the same immunity. The case was appealed and heard by the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] on June 18, 2007. The Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal of the case, stating the herbicides used during the war were not intended to be used to poison humans and therefore did not violate international law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warlegacies.org/Agent%20Orange/Appealdecision.pdf February 22, 2008 Decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals re: Vietnam Association of Victims of Agent Orange v. Dow Chemical Co.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[US Supreme Court]] declined to consider the case.

Three judges on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan heard the appeal on June 18, 2007. They upheld Weinstein's ruling to dismiss the case. They ruled that, though the herbicides contained a dioxin (a known poison), they were not intended to be used as a poison on humans. Therefore, they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law. A further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of the Court of Appeals also confirmed this decision. The lawyers for the Vietnamese filed a petition to the US Supreme Court to hear the case. On March 2, 2009, the Supreme Court denied [[certiorari]] and refused to reconsider the ruling of the Court of Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/030209zor.pdf |title=Order List |format=PDF |date=March 2, 2009 |page=7 |publisher=The United States Supreme Court |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 2004 [[Zogby International]] poll of 987 people, 79% of respondents thought the US chemical companies which produced Agent Orange defoliant should compensate US soldiers who were affected by the toxic chemical used during the war in Vietnam. Only 51% said they supported compensation for Vietnamese Agent Orange victims.&lt;ref&gt;''Vietnam Ministry of Foreign Affairs''; [http://www.mofa.gov.vn/en/nr040807104143/nr040807105039/ns041122153029/view#b7MSrBWfFBQ1 &quot;Americans support compensations for Agent Orange victims: poll&quot;], November 22, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Help for those affected in Vietnam===
[[File:A vietnamese Professor is pictured with a group of handicapped children.jpg|thumb|right|Group of handicapped Vietnamese children at a medical treatment facility, most of them victims of Agent Orange]]

To assist those who have been affected by Agent Orange/dioxin, the Vietnamese have established &quot;peace villages&quot;, which each host between 50 and 100 victims, giving them medical and psychological help. As of 2006, there were 11 such villages, thus granting some social protection to fewer than a thousand victims. U.S. veterans of the war in Vietnam and individuals who are aware and sympathetic to the impacts of Agent Orange have also supported these programs in Vietnam. An international group of veterans from the U.S. and its allies during the Vietnam War working together with their former enemy&amp;nbsp;— veterans from the Vietnam Veterans Association&amp;nbsp;— established the Vietnam Friendship Village&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.vietnamfriendship.org |title = Vietnam Friendship Village Project |accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; located outside of [[Hanoi]].

The center provides medical care, rehabilitation and vocational training for children and veterans from Vietnam who have been affected by Agent Orange. In 1998, The [[Vietnam Red Cross]] established the Vietnam Agent Orange Victims Fund to provide direct assistance to families throughout Vietnam that have been affected. In 2003, the [[Vietnam Association of Victims of Agent Orange]] (VAVA) was formed. In addition to filing the lawsuit against the chemical companies, VAVA also provides medical care, rehabilitation services and financial assistance to those injured by Agent Orange.

The Vietnamese government provides small monthly stipends to more than 200,000 Vietnamese believed affected by the herbicides; this totaled $40.8 million in 2008 alone. The Vietnam Red Cross has raised more than $22 million to assist the ill or disabled, and several U.S. foundations, United Nations agencies, European governments and nongovernmental organizations have given a total of about $23 million for site cleanup, reforestation, and health care and other services to those in need.&lt;ref&gt;Statement by Amb. Ngo Quang Xuan to the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of Asia, Pacific and Global Environment, June 2009, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

:''May is 13, but she knows nothing, is unable to talk fluently, nor walk with ease due to for her bandy legs. Her father is dead and she has four elder brothers, all mentally retarded ... The students are all disabled, retarded and of different ages. Teaching them is a hard job. They are of the 3rd grade but many of them find it hard to do the reading. Only a few of them can. Their pronunciation is distorted due to their twisted lips and their memory is quite short. They easily forget what they've learned ... In the Village, it is quite hard to tell the kids' exact ages. Some in their twenties have a physical statures as small as the 7- or 8-years-old. They find it difficult to feed themselves, much less have mental ability or physical capacity for work. No one can hold back the tears when seeing the heads turning round unconsciously, the bandy arms managing to push the spoon of food into the mouths with awful difficulty ... Yet they still keep smiling, singing in their great innocence, at the presence of some visitors, craving for something beautiful.''

On June 16, 2010, members of [[the U.S.-Vietnam Dialogue Group on Agent Orange/Dioxin]] unveiled a comprehensive 10-year Declaration and Plan of Action to address the toxic legacy of Agent Orange and other herbicides in Vietnam. The Plan of Action was released as an Aspen Institute publication and calls upon the U.S. and Vietnamese governments to join with other governments, foundations, businesses, and nonprofits in a partnership to clean up dioxin &quot;hot spots&quot; in Vietnam, and to expand humanitarian services for people with disabilities in that country.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/agentorange/chi-agent-orange-actionplandec08,0,7945266.story Public-private group has plan in the works to resolve issue]. chicagotribune.com (December 8, 2009).

==Use outside of Vietnam==
While 'Agent Orange' was only used between 1962 and 1970, 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T and other herbicides were used by the US Military from the late 1940s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bluewaternavy.org/ Agent Orange information site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluewaternavy.org/bases/1Herbicides_Outside_of_Vietnam%5B1%5D.pdf Specifics of Agent Orange use]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 1978, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suspended spraying of Agent Orange in [[U.S. National Forest|National Forests]], due to a threefold increase in miscarriages in women living near forests that had been sprayed.&lt;ref&gt;Nass, Meryl; [http://www.organicconsumers.org/monsanto/agentorange032102.cfm &quot;Monsanto's Agent Orange: The Persistent Ghost from the Vietnam War&quot;], ''Organic Consumers Association'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicosia and Swofford, 2004: [http://books.google.com/books?id=5hq2_JFvV0kC&amp;pg=PA446 p. 446]&lt;/ref&gt;

A December 2006 Department of Defense report listed Agent Orange testing, storage, and disposal sites at 32 locations throughout the United States, as well as in Canada, Thailand, Puerto Rico, Korea, and in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2006: pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; The Veteran Administration has also acknowledged that Agent Orange was used domestically by U.S. forces in test sites throughout the US. [[Eglin Air Force Base]] in Florida was one of the primary testing sites throughout the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on DoD Herbicides Outside of Vietnam|url = http://www.publichealth.va.gov/docs/agentorange/dod_herbicides_outside_vietnam.pdf|author=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=September 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korea===
Agent Orange was used in Korea in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs|title = Agent Orange: Information for Veterans Who Served in Vietnam|url = http://www.publichealth.va.gov/docs/agentorange/reviews/ao_newsletter_jul06.pdf|accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]] troops were the only personnel involved in the spraying, which occurred along the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ). &quot;Citing declassified U.S. Department of Defense documents, Korean officials fear thousands of its soldiers may have come into contact with the deadly defoliant in the late 1960s and early 1970s. According to one top government official, as many as '30,000 Korean veterans are suffering from illness related to their exposure'. The exact number of GIs who may have been exposed is unknown. But C. David Benbow, a North Carolina attorney who served as a sergeant with Co. C, 3rd Battalion, [[23rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|23rd Infantry Regiment]], [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]], along the DMZ in 1968–69, estimates as many as '4,000 soldiers at any given time' could have been affected.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=September 2010}}{{cite web|url = http://cybersarges.tripod.com/aoinkorea.html |title = AGENT ORANGE UNITS SPRAYED OUTSIDE OF VIETNAM (KOREA) |accessdate=July 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=September 2010}}

In 1999, about 20,000 South Koreans filed two separated lawsuits against U.S. companies, seeking more than $5 billion in damages. After losing a decision in 2002, they filed an appeal.

In January 2006, the South Korean Appeals Court ordered Dow Chemical and Monsanto to pay $62 million in compensation to about 6,800 people. The ruling acknowledged that &quot;the [[defendant]]s failed to ensure safety as the defoliants manufactured by the defendants had higher levels of dioxins than standard&quot;, and, quoting the U.S. National Academy of Science report, declared that there was a &quot;causal relationship&quot; between Agent Orange and 11 diseases, including cancers of the lung, larynx and prostate. The judges failed to acknowledge &quot;the relationship between the chemical and peripheral neuropathy, the disease most widespread among Agent Orange victims&quot; according to the ''[[Mercury News]]''.

The United States local press KPHO-TV in Phoenix, Arizona alleged that the United States Army has buried Agent Orange in [[Camp Carroll, South Korea|Camp Carroll]], the U.S. Army base located in Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.kpho.com/news/27892124/detail.html |title = Valley Veteran Blows Whistle On Burial Of Agent Orange}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the claim of three U.S. Army veterans. They claimed approximately 250 drums of 55-gallon Agent Orange were buried at Camp Carroll in 1978, which was indicated as 'Chemicals type Agent Orange' or 'Province of Vietnam, Compound Orange' with stripe around the barrel dated 1967 for the Republic of Vietnam. The South Korean Ministry of Environment announced that they will request cooperative investigation at Camp Carroll officially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://korea.kr/newsWeb/pages/brief/partNews2/view.do?dataId=155750435&amp;call_from=extlink&amp;call_from=extlink |title = Release copy of Ministry Of Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The USFK issued a statement that agreed that barrells were buried there, but all (plus an additional 60 tons of soil) were removed in 1996.

===Canadian Forces Base Gagetown (New Brunswick, Canada)===
The U.S. military, with the permission of the Canadian government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008367 |title = ''Quiet Complicity: Canadian Involvement in the Vietnam War'', by Victor Levant (1986). |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; tested herbicides, including Agent Orange, in the forests near the [[Canadian Forces Base Gagetown]] in New Brunswick in 1966 and 1967. On September 12, 2007, [[Greg Thompson]], [[Minister of Veterans Affairs]], announced that the [[government of Canada]] was offering a one-time [[ex gratia]] payment of $20,000 as the compensation package for Agent Orange exposure at CFB Gagetown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=People angry with Agent Orange package turn to class-action lawsuit|date=September 13, 2007|publisher=The Canadian Press|url =http://www.amherstdaily.com/Living/Health/2007-09-14/article-385472/People-angry-with-Agent-Orange-package-turn-to-class-action-lawsuit/1|accessdate = October 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 2005, Merchant Law Group LLP on behalf of over 1,100 Canadian veterans and civilians who were living in and around the CFB Gagetown filed a lawsuit to pursue [[class action]] litigation concerning Agent Orange and Agent Purple with the [[Federal Court of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Agent Orange Class Action| publisher=Merchant Law Group LLP|url =http://www.merchantlaw.com/agentop.html| accessdate = October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 2009, the case was rejected by the court due to lack of evidence. The ruling was appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timestranscript.canadaeast.com/search/article/749829 |author=Shawn Berry |title=Moncton judge rules in Agent Orange lawsuit |publisher=The Times and Transcript |date=August 4, 2009 |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Shawn; [http://timestranscript.canadaeast.com/search/article/749829 &quot;Moncton judge rules in Agent Orange lawsuit&quot;], ''Times &amp; Transcript'', August 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queensland, Australia===
In 2008 Australian researcher Jean Williams claimed that cancer rates in the town of Innisfail, Queensland were 10 times higher than the state average due to secret testing of Agent Orange by the Australian military scientists during the Vietnam War. Williams, who had won the Order of Australia medal for her research on the effects of chemicals on U.S. war veterans, based her allegations on Australian government reports found in the Australian War Memorial museum archives. A former soldier, Ted Bosworth, backed up the claims, saying that he had been involved in the secret testing. The Queensland health department claimed that cancer rates in Innisfail were not higher than those in other parts of the state.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, Barbara; [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/may/19/australia &quot;Australia cancer deaths linked to Agent Orange&quot;], ''Guardian'', May 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
The use of Agent Orange has been controversial in New Zealand, because of exposure of New Zealand troops to it and because of the production of Agent Orange for Vietnam and other users at a Ivon Watkins-Dow chemical plant in Paritutu, [[New Plymouth]]. There have been continuing claims that the suburb of Paritutu has also been polluted; see [[New Zealand in the Vietnam War#Agent Orange|New Zealand in the Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;;NZPA [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/dioxin/news/article.cfm?c_id=675&amp;objectid=10412402 &quot;Concern prompts review of Dioxin study&quot;], ''New Zealand Herald'', November 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
There are many cases of New Zealand soldiers developing cancers such as bone cancer from exposure to Agent Orange.

===Brazil===
The Brazilian government used Agent Orange to defoliate a large section of the [[Amazon rainforest]] so that [[Alcoa]] could build the [[Tucuruí dam]] to power mining operations. Large areas of rainforest were destroyed, along with the homes and livelihoods of thousands of rural peasants and indigenous tribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;50-years-enough&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Multinational Monitor|title=50 Years is Enough|editor=Kevin Danaher|publisher=South End Press|page=45|isbn=978-0896084957|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malayan Emergency===
Small scale defoliation experiments using 2-4-D and 2-4-5-T were conducted by the British during the [[Malayan Emergency]] in 1951. Areas of jungle close to roadways were cleared using chemical defoliation to help prevent ambushes by Communist Terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psywar.org/malaya.php|title=Psychological Warfare during the Malayan Emergency by Herbert A Friedman|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ontario, Canada===
On February 17, 2011, the [[Toronto Star]] revealed that cancer-causing toxins used to strip the jungles of Vietnam were also employed to clear massive plots of [[Crown land]] in [[Northern Ontario]].&lt;ref name=&quot;StarExclusive&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/940243--star-exclusive-agent-orange-soaked-ontario-teens|title=Star Exclusive: Agent Orange “soaked” Ontario teens by Diana Zlomislic|accessdate=February 17, 2011 | location=Toronto|work=The Star|date=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, in response to the Toronto Star article, the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Ontario provincial government]] launched a probe into the use of Agent Orange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/940878--ontario-probes-agent-orange-poisoning|title=Ontario probes Agent Orange poisoning by Diana Zlomislic|accessdate=February 17, 2011 | location=Toronto|work=The Star|date=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 18, 2011, [[Ontario|Ontario's]] [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ministry of Natural Resources]] widened the probe of Agent Orange spraying to include all areas of the province where government managed forests on Crown land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/941635--agent-orange-probe-widens|title=Agent Orange probe widens by Diana Zlomislic|accessdate=February 18, 2011 | location=Toronto|work=The Star|date=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Toronto Star reported that, &quot;records from the 1950s, 60s and 70s show forestry workers, often students and junior rangers, spent weeks at a time as human markers holding red, helium-filled balloons on fishing lines while low-flying planes sprayed toxic herbicides including an infamous chemical mixture known as Agent Orange on the brush and the boys below.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;StarExclusive&quot; /&gt;

As of February 19, 2011, Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources was in the process of collecting information from its district offices including records showing when and where spraying occurred and what chemicals were used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Astronomical year numbering''' is based on [[Anno Domini|AD]]/[[Common Era|CE]] year numbering, but follows normal [[decimal]] [[integer]] numbering more strictly. Thus, it has a [[year zero|year 0]], the years before that are designated with [[negative number]]s and the years after that are designated with positive numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasa-eclipses&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/dates.html|title=Year Dating Conventions|last=Espenak|first=Fred|work=NASA Eclipse Web Site|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomers use the [[Julian calendar]] for years before 1582, including this year 0, and the [[Gregorian calendar]] for years after 1582 as exemplified by [[Jacques Cassini]] (1740),&lt;ref name=Cassini&gt;Jacques Cassini, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=fVIVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA10 Tables Astronomiques]'' (1740), Explication et Usage pp. 5 (PA5), 7 (PA7), Tables pp. 10 (RA1-PA10), 22 (RA1-PA22), 63 (RA1-PA63), 77 (RA1-PA77), 91 (RA1-PA91), 105 (RA1-PA105), 119 (RA1-PA119). {{French icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Newcomb]] (1898)&lt;ref&gt;Simon Newcomb, [http://books.google.com/books?id=j8MRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT43 &quot;Tables of the motion of the Earth on its axis and around the Sun&quot;] in ''Astronomical papers prepared for the use of the American ephemeris and Nautical Almanac, Volume VI: Tables of the four inner planets'', (United States Naval Observatory, 1898), pp. 27 (PT36), 34–35 (PT43–PT44).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fred Espenak]] (2007).&lt;ref name=Espanak&gt;Fred Espenak, [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/phase/phases-0099.html Phases of the Moon: −99 to 0 (100 to 1 BCE)] ''NASA Eclipse web site''&lt;/ref&gt;

The prefix AD and the suffixes CE, BC or BCE (Common Era, Before Christ or Before Common Era) are dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasa-eclipses&quot; /&gt; The year 1 BC/BCE is numbered 0, the year 2 BC is numbered −1, and in general the year ''n'' BC/BCE is numbered &quot;−(''n'' − 1)&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nasa-eclipses&quot; /&gt; (a negative number equal to 1 − ''n''). The numbers of AD/CE years are not changed and are written with either no sign or a positive sign; thus in general ''n'' AD/CE is simply ''n'' or +''n''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasa-eclipses&quot; /&gt; For normal calculation a [[0 (number)|number zero]] is often needed, here most notably when calculating the number of years in a period that spans the [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]; the end years need only be subtracted from each other.

The system is so named due to its use in [[astronomy]]. Few other disciplines outside [[history]] deal with the time before year 1, exceptions being [[dendrochronology]], [[archaeology]] and [[geology]], the latter two of which use '[[Before Present|years before the present]]'{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. Although the absolute numerical values of astronomical and historical years only differ by one before year 1, this difference is critical when calculating astronomical events like eclipses or planetary conjunctions to determine when historical events which mention them occurred.

==Year zero usage==
{{Main|0 (year)}}
In his [[Rudolphine Tables]] (1627), [[Johannes Kepler]] used a prototype of year zero which he labeled ''Christi'' (Christ) between years labeled ''Ante Christum'' (Before Christ) and ''Post Christum'' (After Christ) on the mean motion tables for the Sun, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kepler, ''[http://www.ub.uni-kiel.de/digiport/bis1800/Arch3_436.html Tabulae Rudolphinae]'' (1627) Pars secunda, 42 (Zu Seite 191), 48 (197), 54 (203), 60 (209), 66 (215), 72 (221), 78 (227). (Latin)&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1702 the French astronomer [[Philippe de la Hire]] used a year he labeled {{nowrap|''Christum 0''}} at the end of years labeled ''ante Christum'' (BC), and immediately before years labeled ''post Christum'' (AD) on the mean motion pages in his ''Tabulæ Astronomicæ'', thus adding the designation ''0'' to Kepler's ''Christi''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=BjygAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP35,M1 Tabulae Astronomicae - Philippo de la Hire] (1702), Tabulæ 15, 21, 39, 47, 55, 63, 71; Usus tabularum 4. (Latin)&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1740 the French astronomer [[Jacques Cassini]] {{nowrap|(Cassini II)}}, who is traditionally credited with the invention of year zero,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Bn0EBVsfi1YC&amp;pg=PA103 ''The nothing that is''] (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) 103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick Teresi, [http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/97jul/zero.htm &quot;Zero&quot;], ''The Atlantic'', July 1997 (see under Calendars and the Cosmos).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Doggett, [http://charon.nmsu.edu/~lhuber/leaphist.html &quot;Calendars&quot;], ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'', ed. P. Kenneth Seidelmann, (Sausalito, California: University Science Books, 1992/2005) 579.&lt;/ref&gt; completed the transition in his ''Tables astronomiques'', simply labeling this year ''0'', which he placed at the end of Julian years labeled ''avant Jesus-Christ'' (before Jesus Christ or BC), and immediately before Julian years labeled ''après Jesus-Christ'' (after Jesus Christ or AD).&lt;ref name=Cassini/&gt;

Cassini gave the following reasons for using a year 0:&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Cassini, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=fVIVAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=PT30 Tables Astronomiques]'', Explication et Usage 5, translated by Wikipedia from the French:&lt;br&gt; &quot;L'année 0 est celle dans laquelle on suppose qu'est né J. C. que plusieurs Chronologistes marquent 1 avant la naissance de J. C. &amp; que nous avons marquée 0, afin que la somme des années avant &amp; après J. C. donne l'intervalle qui est entre ces années, &amp; que les nombres disibles par 4 marquent les années bissextiles tant avant qu'après J. C.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|The year 0 is that in which one supposes that Jesus Christ was born, which several chronologists mark 1 before the birth of Jesus Christ and which we marked 0, so that the sum of the years before and after Jesus Christ gives the interval which is between these years, and where numbers divisible by 4 mark the leap years as so many before or after Jesus Christ.|Jacques Cassini}}

Fred Espanak of [[NASA]] lists 50 phases of the moon within year 0, showing that it is a full year, not an instant in time.&lt;ref name=Espanak/&gt; &lt;br&gt; Jean Meeus gives the following explanation:&lt;ref&gt;Jean Meeus, ''Astronomical Algorithms'' (Richmod, Virginia: Willmann-Bell, 1991) 60.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There is a disagreement between astronomers and historians about how to count the years preceding year 1. In [''Astronomical Algorithms''], the 'B.C.' years are counted astronomically. Thus, the year before the year +1 is the year zero, and the year preceding the latter is the year −1. The year which historians call 585 B.C. is actually the year −584.
The astronomical counting of the negative years is the only one suitable for arithmetical purpose. For example, in the historical practice of counting, the rule of divisibility by 4 revealing Julian leap-years no longer exists; these years are, indeed, 1, 5, 9, 13, ... B.C. In the astronomical sequence, however, these leap-years are called 0, −4, −8, −12, ..., and the rule of divisibility by 4 subsists.|Jean Meeus}}

==Signed years without year 0==
Although he used the usual French terms &quot;avant J.-C.&quot; (before Jesus Christ) and &quot;après J.-C.&quot; (after Jesus Christ) to label years elsewhere in his book, the Byzantine historian Venance Grumel used negative years (identified by a minus sign, −) to label BC years and unsigned positive years to label AD years in a table, possibly to save space, without a year 0 between them.&lt;ref&gt;V. Grumel, ''La chronologie'' (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1958) 30. {{French icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema language]], sometimes used in connection with representing data for storage in computers, contains built-in primitive datatypes, '''date''' and '''dateTime''', which do not allow a year zero, and designate years BC as negative numbers. Years contain at least four digits. Thus -0001 in that language is equivalent to 1 BC. However, the defining [[W3C recommendation|recommendation]] indicates a change to a system similar to [[ISO 8601]] and astronomical year numbering is likely in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Biron, P.V. &amp; Malhotra, A. (Eds.). (28 October 2004). [http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#lexical-space ''XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes'' (2nd ed.).] World Wide Web Consortium.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Adam of Bremen''' (also: '''Adamus Bremensis''') was a [[Germany|German]] [[medieval]] [[chronicler]]. He lived and worked in the second half of the eleventh century. He is most famous for his chronicle ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum|Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum]]'' (''Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church'').

==Background==
Little is known of his life other than hints from his own chronicles. He is believed to have come from [[Meissen]] ([[Latin]] ''Misnia'') in [[Saxony]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  The dates of his birth and death are uncertain, but he was probably born before 1050 and died on 12 October of an unknown year (Possibly 1081, latest 1085). From his chronicles it is apparent that he was familiar with a number of authors. The honorary name of ''Magister Adam'' shows that he had passed through all the stages of a higher education. It is probable that he was taught at the ''[[Magdeburg]]er Domschule''.

In 1066 or 1067 he was invited by archbishop [[Adalbert of Hamburg]] to join the [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Church of Bremen]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, since Adalbert believed he would improve the literary reputation of the diocese. Adam was accepted among the capitulars of Bremen, and by 1069 he appeared as director of the cathedral's school.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Soon thereafter he began to write the history of [[Bremen]]/[[Hamburg]] and of the northern lands in his ''Gesta''.

His position and the missionary activity of the church of Bremen allowed him to gather all kinds of information on the history and the geography of northern [[Germany]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  A stay at the court of [[Svend Estridson]] gave him the opportunity to find information about the history and geography of Denmark, and the Scandinavian countries.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} 

Bremen was a major trading town, and ships, traders and missionaries went from there to many different locations. The earlier archbishopric seat in Hamburg had been attacked and destroyed several times, and thereafter the sees of Hamburg and Bremen were combined for protection. For three hundred years, beginning with bishop [[Ansgar]], the [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Hamburg-Bremen archbishopric]] had been designated as the &quot;Mission of the North&quot; and had jurisdiction over all missions in [[Scandinavia]], North-Western [[Russia]], [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]]. Then the archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen had a falling-out with [[Pope Paschal II|the pope]] and in 1105 a separate archbishopric for the North was established in [[Lund]].

==Gesta==
Adam of Bremen's best-known work is the ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum|Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum]]'' (''Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church''), which he began only after the death of the archbishop Adalbert. It consists of four volumes about the history of the archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen, and the isles of the north. The first three mainly consist of [[history]] and the last one is mainly on [[geography]]. Adam based his works in part on [[Einhard]], [[Cassiodorus]], and other earlier historians, as he had the whole library of the church of Bremen at his fingertips. The first edition was completed in 1075/1076, but he continued to revise and update it until his death in the 1080s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} 

The first book gives a history from 788 onwards of the Church in Hamburg-Bremen, and the Christian mission in the North. This is the chief source of knowledge of the North until the thirteenth century. The second book continues the history, and also deals with German history between 940 and 1045. The third book is about the deeds of archbishop Adalbert and is considered a milestone in medieval biographical writing.

The fourth book, ''Descriptio insularum Aquilonis'', completed approximately in 1075, is about the geography, people and customs of Scandinavia, as well as updates of the progress of Christian missionaries there.  Adam was a supporter of converting the Northern people. Scandinavia had only just recently been explored by missionaries, and since the fourth book was perhaps created to inspire and guide future missionaries, its detailed descriptions make it one of the most important sources about pre-Christian Scandinavia. It is also the first known European record (in chapter 38) that mentions [[Vinland]] (Winland) island (insula), a land centuries later possibly identified as [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], Canada, [[North America]].

'''''Ab urbe condita''''' (related with '''Anno Urbis Conditae''': AUC or a.u.c. or a.u.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio|Dio]] uses &quot;a.u.&quot; in his ''Roman History''&lt;/ref&gt;) is [[Latin]] for &quot;from [[founding of Rome|the founding]] of the City (Rome)&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Literally translated as &quot;From the city having been founded&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally set in 753 BC. AUC is a year-numbering system used by some ancient Roman historians to identify particular Roman years. Renaissance editors sometimes added AUC to Roman manuscripts they published, giving the false impression that the Romans usually numbered their years using the AUC system. In fact, modern historians use AUC much more frequently than the Romans themselves did. The dominant method of identifying Roman years in Roman times was to name the two [[Roman consul|consul]]s who held office that year. The [[regnal year]] of the emperor was also used to identify years, especially in the [[Byzantine Empire]] after 537 when [[Justinian]] required its use. Examples of continuous numbering include counting by regnal year, principally found in the writings of German authors, for example [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen's]] [[History of Rome (Mommsen)|''History of Rome'']], and (most ubiquitously) in the [[Anno Domini]] year-numbering system.

==Significance==
[[Image:Aureus - Adriano - RIC 0144.jpg|thumb|300px|This [[aureus]] by Hadrian celebrates the games held in honour of the 874th [[founding of Rome|birthday of Rome]] (121).]]
[[Image:Antoninianus-Pacatianus-1001-RIC 0006cf.jpg|thumb|300px|Also [[Pacatianus]], [[Roman usurper|usurper]] against Philip, celebrated the ''Saeculum Novum''. This [[antoninianus]] bears the legend ROMAE AETER AN MIL ET PRIMO, &quot;To eternal Rome, in its one thousand and first year&quot;.]]

From Emperor [[Claudius]] (reigned AD 41–54) onwards, [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]]'s calculation (see below) superseded other contemporary calculations. Celebrating the anniversary of the city became part of imperial [[propaganda]]. Claudius was the first to hold magnificent celebrations in honour of the city's anniversary, in 48 [[Anno Domini|AD]], 800 years after the founding of the city. [[Hadrian]] and [[Antoninus Pius]] held similar celebrations, in 121 AD and 147/148 AD respectively.

In 248 AD, [[Philip the Arab]] celebrated Rome's first [[millennium]], together with [[Ludi saeculares]] for Rome's alleged tenth [[saeculum]]. [[Coin]]s from his reign commemorate the celebrations. A coin by a contender for the imperial throne, [[Pacatianus]], explicitly states &quot;Year one thousand and first&quot;, which is an indication that the citizens of the Empire had a sense of the beginning of a new era, a ''Saeculum Novum''.

When the Roman Empire turned Christian in the following century, this imagery came to be used in a more [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] sense, and removed legal impediments to the development and public use of the ''[[Anno Domini]]'' dating system, which came into general use during the reign of [[Charlemagne]].

==Calculation by Varro==
The traditional date for the founding of Rome of 21 April 753 BC, was initiated by [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]]. Varro may have used the consular list with its mistakes, and called the year of the first consuls &quot;245 ''ab urbe condita''&quot;, accepting the 244-year interval from [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] for the kings after the foundation of Rome. The correctness of Varro's calculation has not been proved scientifically but is still used worldwide.

==Relationship with Anno Domini==
The [[Anno Domini]] year numbering was developed by a monk named [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in Rome in 525, as an outcome of his work on calculating the date of Easter. In his Easter table the year 532 AD was equated with the regnal year 248 of Emperor Diocletian. The table counted the years starting from the presumed birth of Christ, rather than the accession of the emperor [[Diocletian]] on 20 November 284, or as stated by Dionysius: &quot;''sed magis elegimus ab incarnatione Domini nostri Jesu Christi annorum tempora praenotare...''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Liber de Paschate, Migne [[Patrologia Latina]] [http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC12663742&amp;id=LcEYeL-4ZuEC&amp;pg=PP10&amp;lpg=PP10&amp;dq=%22in+hoc+tomo+LXVII#PRA1-PT165,M1 67 page 481 note f]&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed Dionysius Exiguus intended either 1 AD or 1 BC to be the year of Christ's birth  (a &quot;[[year zero]]&quot; does not exist in this calendar). It was later calculated (from the historical record of the succession of [[List of Roman consuls|Roman consuls]]) that the year 1 AD corresponds to the Roman year DCCLIV ab urbe condita, based on Varro's epoch. This however resulted in that year not corresponding with the lifetimes of historical figures reputed to be alive, or otherwise mentioned in connection with the Christian incarnation, e.g. [[Herod the Great]] or [[Publius Sulpicius Quirinius|Quirinius]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, Lives of the Caesars: Tiberius, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

:...1 ab urbe condita = 753 before Christ
:2 AUC = 752 BC
:3 AUC = 751 BC ...

:750 AU = 4 BC (Death of [[Herod the Great]])
:751 AU = 3 BC
:752 AU = 2 BC
:753 AU = 1 BC
:754 AU = 1 [[Anno Domini]]
:755 AU = 2 AD

:759 AU = 6 AD ([[Quirinius]] becomes governor of Syria) ...

:2753 AU = 2000 AD

:2764 AU = 2011 AD

==Alternative calculations==
According to [[Velleius Paterculus]] the foundation of Rome took place 437 years after the [[Trojan War|capture of Troy]] (1182 BC). It took place shortly before an [[eclipse]] of the Sun that was observed at Rome on 25 June 745 BC and had a magnitude of 50.3%. Its beginning occurred at 16:38, its middle at 17:28, and its end at 18:16.

However, according to Lucius Tarrutius of Firmum, [[Romulus and Remus]] were conceived in the womb on the 23rd day of the [[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian month]] Choiac, at the time of a total eclipse of the Sun. (This eclipse occurred on 15 June 763 BC, with a magnitude of 62.5% at Rome. Its beginning took place at 6:49, its middle at 7:47 and its end at 8:51.) They were born on the 21st day of the month Thoth. The first day of Thoth fell on 2 March in that year.&lt;ref&gt;(Prof. E.J. Bickerman, 1980: 115)&lt;/ref&gt; Rome was founded on the ninth day of the month Pharmuthi, which was 21 April, as universally agreed. The Romans add that about the time Romulus started to build the city, an eclipse of the Sun was observed by Antimachus, the Teian poet, on the 30th day of the lunar month. This eclipse on 25 June 745 BC (see above) had a magnitude of 54.6% at Teos, Asia Minor. It started at 17:49; it was still eclipsed at sunset, at 19:20. Romulus vanished in the 54th year of his life, on the Nones of Quintilis (July), on a day when the [[Sun]] was darkened. The day turned into night, which sudden darkness was believed to be an eclipse of the Sun. It occurred on 17 July 709 BC, with a magnitude of 93.7%, beginning at 5:04 and ending at 6:57. (All these eclipse data have been calculated by Prof. Aurél Ponori-Thewrewk, retired director of the Planetarium of Budapest.) Plutarch placed it in the 37th year from the foundation of Rome, on the fifth of our July, then called Quintilis,&lt;ref&gt;Quintilis, on &quot;Caprotine Nones,&quot; Livy (I, 21)&lt;/ref&gt; also states that Romulus ruled for 37 years. He was slain by the senate or disappeared in the 38th year of his reign. Most of these have been recorded by [[Plutarch]],&lt;ref&gt;(''Lives'' of Romulus, Numa Pompilius and Camillus), Plutarch&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florus]],&lt;ref&gt;(Book I, I), Florus&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]],&lt;ref&gt;(''The Republic'' VI, 22: ''Scipio's Dream''), Cicero&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cassius Dio|Dio]] (Dion) Cassius and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (L. 2). Dio in his ''Roman History'' (Book I) confirms this data by telling that Romulus was in his 18th year of age when he had founded Rome. Thus, three eclipse calculations may support the suggestion that Romulus reigned from 746 BC to 709 BC, and Rome was founded in 745 BC.

[[Quintus Fabius Pictor|Q. Fabius Pictor]] (c. 250 BC) tells that Roman consuls started for the first time 239 years after Rome's foundation (''Enciclopedia Italiana,'' XIV, 1951: 173). Livy (I, 60) gives almost the same, 240 years for that interval. [[Polybius]]&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, ''The Histories'' (III, 22. 1–2)&lt;/ref&gt; tells that 28 years after the expulsion of the last Persian king [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] crossed over to Greece, and that event is fixed to 478 BC by two [[solar eclipse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;References: Theodor Mommsen, History of Rome (1854–1856)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arapawa Island''' is a small [[island]] located in the [[Marlborough Sounds]], at the north east tip of the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]].
The island has a land area of {{convert|75|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=in}}. [[Queen Charlotte Sound, New Zealand|Queen Charlotte Sound]] defines its western side, while to the south lies [[Tory Channel]], which is on the sea route from [[Wellington]] in the [[North Island]] to [[Picton, New Zealand|Picton]].

==History==
It was from a hill on Arapawa Island in 1770 that Captain [[James Cook]] first saw the sea passage from the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the [[Tasman Sea]], which was named [[Cook Strait]].  This discovery banished the fond notion of geographers that there existed a great southern continent, [[Terra Australis]].

From the late 1820s until the mid 1960s, Arapawa Island was a base for [[whaling]] in the Sounds. [[John Guard]] established a shore station at Te Awaiti in 1827 for [[right whales]]. Later, the station at Perano Head on the east coast of the island was used to hunt [[humpback whales]] from 1911 to 1964 (see [[Whaling in New Zealand]]). The houses built by the Perano family are now operated as tourist accommodations.

===Aircraft accident===
An elevated power cable from the mainland to Arapawa Island over [[Tory Channel]] was struck by an Air Albatross [[Cessna 402]] commuter aircraft in 1985. The crash was witnessed by many passengers on the inter-island Cook Strait ferry. The ferry immediately stopped to dispatch a rescue lifeboat. Along with the two pilots, one entire family was lost, and all but a young girl from the other. No bodies were ever found. The sole survivor (Cindy Mosey) was travelling with her family and the other from Nelson to Wellington to attend a gymnastics competition. The Arapawa Island crash caused public confidence in Air Albatross to falter, contributing to the company going into liquidation in December of that year. Cindy went on to become an accomplished gymnast and in her 30s was three times world champion [[kitesurfer]] (2002, 2003 &amp; 2004).

==Feral livestock==
Arapawa Island is known for the breeds of [[Arapawa Pig|pigs]], [[Arapawa Sheep|sheep]] and [[Arapawa Goat|goats]] found only on the island. The origin of these breeds is uncertain, and is a matter of some speculation. Common suggestions are that they are old English breeds introduced by the early whalers, or by Captain Cook or other early explorers, which are now extinct in England.

{{Administrative law}}
[[File:HQ FTC.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Administrative law in the United States often involves the regulatory activities of so-called &quot;independent agencies&quot;, such as the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (&quot;FTC&quot;), whose [[Washington D.C.]] headquarters are shown above.]]

'''Administrative law''' is the body of [[law]] that governs the activities of [[government agency|administrative agencies]] of [[government]]. [[Government agency]] action can include [[rulemaking]], [[adjudication]], or the [[enforcement]] of a specific [[regulation|regulatory]] agenda. Administrative law is considered a branch of [[public law]]. As a body of law, administrative law deals with the decision-making of administrative units of government (for example, [[tribunal]]s, [[Board of directors|board]]s or [[Government agency|commissions]]) that are part of a national [[regulation|regulatory scheme]] in such areas as [[police law]], [[international trade]], [[manufacturing]], the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], [[taxation]], [[broadcasting]], [[immigration]] and [[transport]]. Administrative law expanded greatly during the twentieth century, as legislative bodies worldwide created more [[government agency|government agencies]] to regulate the increasingly complex social, economic and political spheres of human interaction. 

Civil law countries often have specialized courts, [[administrative court]]s, that review these decisions. The plurality of administrative decisions contested in administrative courts are related to taxation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Administrative law in common law countries==
Generally speaking, most countries that follow the principles of [[common law]] have developed procedures for [[judicial review]] that limit the reviewability of decisions made by administrative law bodies. Often these procedures are coupled with legislation or other [[common law]] doctrines that establish standards for proper [[rulemaking]]. Administrative law may also apply to review of decisions of so-called semi-public bodies, such as [[non-profit corporations]], disciplinary boards, and other decision-making bodies that affect the legal rights of members of a particular group or entity. 

While administrative decision-making bodies are often controlled by larger governmental units, their decisions could be reviewed by a [[court]] of [[general jurisdiction]] under some principle of [[judicial review]] based upon [[due process]] (United States) or [[fundamental justice]] (Canada). Judicial review of administrative decisions, it must be noted, is different from an administrative appeal. When sitting in review of a decision, the Court will only look at the method in which the decision was arrived at, whereas in an administrative appeal the correctness of the decision itself will be examined, usually by a higher body in the agency.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} This difference is vital in appreciating administrative law in common law countries. 

The scope of [[judicial review]] may be limited to certain questions of [[fairness]], or whether the administrative action is ''[[ultra vires]]''. In terms of ultra vires actions in the broad sense, a reviewing court may set aside an administrative decision if it is [[unreasonable]] (under Canadian law, following the rejection of the &quot;Patently Unreasonable&quot; standard by the Supreme Court in [[Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick]]), [[Wednesbury unreasonableness|''Wednesbury'' unreasonable]] (under British law), or arbitrary and capricious (under U.S. [[Administrative Procedure Act]] and New York State law). Administrative law, as laid down by the [[Supreme Court of India]], has also recognized two more grounds of judicial review which were recognized but not applied by English Courts viz. [[legitimate expectation]] and [[Proportionality (political maxim)|proportionality]]. 

The powers to review administrative decisions are usually established by statute, but were originally developed from the royal [[prerogative writ]]s of [[English law]], such as the writ of [[mandamus]] and the writ of [[certiorari]]. In certain [[Common Law]] jurisdictions, such as [[India]] or [[Pakistan]], the power to pass such writs is a Constitutionally guaranteed power. This power is seen as fundamental to the power of [[judicial review]] and an aspect of the independent [[judiciary]].

===England===
{{main|English administrative law}}

===United States===
{{Main|United States administrative law}}
In the [[United States]], many [[Government agency|government agencies]] are organized under the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] of government, although a few are part of the [[Judiciary|judicial]] or [[Legislature|legislative branches]]. 

In the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], the executive branch, led by the [[President of the United States|president]], controls the [[United States federal executive departments|federal executive departments]], which are led by secretaries who are members of the [[United States Cabinet]]. The many important [[independent agencies of the United States government]] created by [[statutes]] enacted by [[United States Congress|Congress]] exist outside of the federal executive departments but are still part of the executive branch. 

Congress has also created some special judicial bodies known as [[Article I and Article III tribunals|Article I tribunals]] to handle some areas of administrative law. 

The actions of executive agencies and independent agencies are the main focus of American administrative law. In response to the rapid creation of new independent agencies in the early twentieth century (see discussion below), [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] enacted the [[Administrative Procedure Act]] (APA) in 1946. Many of the independent agencies operate as miniature versions{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} of the tripartite federal government, with the authority to &quot;legislate&quot; (through [[rulemaking]]; see [[Federal Register]] and [[Code of Federal Regulations]]), [[adjudication|&quot;adjudicate&quot;]] (through administrative hearings), and to &quot;execute&quot; administrative goals (through agency enforcement personnel). Because the [[United States Constitution]] sets no limits on this tripartite authority of [[government agency|administrative agencies]], Congress enacted the [[Administrative Procedure Act|APA]] to establish fair administrative law procedures to comply with the constitutional requirements of [[due process]].

The [[American Bar Association]]'s official journal concerning administrative law is ''[[Administrative Law Review]]''.

====Historical development====
[[Stephen Breyer]], a [[U.S. Supreme Court Justice]] since 1994, divides the history of administrative law in the United States into six discrete periods, according to his book, ''Administrative Law &amp; Regulatory Policy'' (3d Ed., 1992):
* English antecedents &amp; the American experience to 1875
* 1875 - 1930: the rise of regulation &amp; the traditional model of administrative law
* The New Deal
* 1945 - 1965: the [[Administrative Procedure Act]] &amp; the maturation of the traditional model of administrative law
* 1965 - 1985: critique and transformation of the administrative process
* 1985 - ?: retreat or consolidation

====Agriculture====
The agricultural sector is one of the most heavily regulated sectors in the U.S. economy, as it is regulated in various ways at the international, federal, state, and local levels. Consequently, administrative law is a significant component of the discipline of [[Agricultural Law]]. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] and its myriad agencies such as the [http://www.ams.usda.gov Agricultural Marketing Service] are the primary sources of regulatory activity, although other administrative bodies such as the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] play a significant regulatory role as well.

==Administrative law in civil law countries==
{{Main|Administrative court}}
Unlike most Common-law jurisdictions, the majority of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions have specialized courts or sections to deal with administrative cases which, as a rule, will apply procedural rules specifically designed for such cases and different from that applied in private-law proceedings, such as [[contract]] or [[tort]] claims.

===France===
In [[France]], most claims against the national or local governments are handled by [[administrative court]]s, which use the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'' (State Council) as a court of last resort. The main administrative courts are the &quot;Tribunaux Administratifs&quot; and appeal courts are the &quot;Cours Administratives d'Appel&quot;. 

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

===Germany===
{{Main|Judiciary of Germany}}
In [[Germany]], the highest administrative court for most matters is the federal administrative court [[Bundesverwaltungsgericht]]. There are federal courts with special jurisdiction in the fields of social security law ([[Bundessozialgericht]]) and tax law ([[Bundesfinanzhof]]).

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

===The Netherlands===
In The Netherlands, administrative law provisions are usually contained in separate laws. There is however a single General Administrative Law Act (&quot;Algemene wet bestuursrecht&quot; or Awb) that applies both to the making of administrative decisions and the judicial review of these decisions in courts. On the basis of the Awb, citizens can oppose a decision ('besluit') made by a public body ('bestuursorgaan') within the administration and apply for judicial review in courts if unsuccessful. 

Unlike France or Germany, there are no special administrative courts of first instance in the Netherlands, but regular courts have an administrative &quot;chamber&quot; which specializes in administrative appeals. The courts of appeal in administrative cases however are specialized depending on the case, but most administrative appeals end up in the judicial section of the Council of State ([[Raad van State]]).

In addition to the system described above there is another part of administrative law which is called &quot;administratief beroep&quot; (administrative [[appeal]]). This procedure is available only if the law on which the primary decision is based specifically provides for it and involves an appeal to a higher ranking administrative body. If administrative [[appeal]] is available, no appeal to the judicial system may be made.

===Sweden===
[[File:Stenbockska palatset Stockholm 4 mars 2007.jpg|thumb|The Stenbockska Palace is the seat of the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden]].]]
In [[Sweden]], there is a system of administrative courts that considers only administrative law cases, and is completely separate from the system of general courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domstol.se/templates/DV_InfoPage____2317.aspx The Swedish courts], accessed on February 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This system has three tiers, with 12 county administrative courts (''förvaltningsrätt'') as the first tier, four administrative courts of appeal (''kammarrätt'') as the second tier, and the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden]] (''Regeringsrätten'') as the third tier.

Migration cases are handled in a two-tier system, effectively within the system general administrative courts. Three of the administrative courts serve as migration courts (''migrationsdomstol'') with the Administrative Court of Appeal in Stockholm serving as the Migration Court of Appeal (''Migrationsöverdomstolen'').

===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], unlike most Civil-law jurisdictions, there is no specialized court or section to deal with administrative cases. In 1998, a constitutional reform, led by the government of the President [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]], introduced regulatory agencies as a part of the executive branch. Since 1988, Brazilian administrative law has been strongly influenced by the judicial interpretations of the constitutional principles of public administration (art. 37 of Federal Constitution): legality, impersonality, publicity of administrative acts, morality and efficiency...

===Chile===
{{Main|Law of Chile#Administrative law}}
The [[President of the Republic]] exercises the administrative function, in collaboration with several Ministries or other authorities with ''ministerial rank''. Each Ministry has one or more under-secretary that performs through [[public services]] the actual satisfaction of public needs. There is not a single [[Administrative court|specialized court]] to deal with actions against the Administrative entities, but instead there are several specialized courts and procedures of review.

===People's Republic of China===
{{Main|Administrative law in the People's Republic of China}}
Administrative law in the People's Republic of China was virtually non-existent before the [[History of the People's Republic of China (1976–1989)#Reform and opening up|economic reform era]] initiated by Deng Xiaoping. Since the 1980s, the People's Republic of China has constructed a new legal framework for administrative law, establishing control mechanisms for overseeing the bureaucracy and disciplinary committees for the Communist Party of China. However, many have argued that the usefulness of these laws is vastly inadequate in terms of controlling government actions, largely because of institutional and systemic obstacles like a weak judiciary, poorly trained judges and lawyers, and corruption.

In 1990, the Administrative Supervision Regulations (行政检查条例) and the Administrative Reconsideration Regulations (行政复议条例) were passed. Both regulations have since been amended and upgraded into laws. The 1993 State Civil Servant Provisional Regulations (国家公务员暂行条例) changed the way government officials were selected and promoted, requiring that they pass exams and yearly appraisals, and introduced a rotation system. In 1994, the State Compensation Law (国家赔偿法) was passed, followed by the Administrative Penalties Law (行政处罚法) in 1996.

==Early life and naval career==

Arthur Phillip was born in 1738, the son of Jacob Phillip, a German, Frankfurt-born language teacher, and his English wife, Elizabeth Breach, who had remarried after the death of her previous husband, a Royal Navy Captain Herbert, R.N. a collateral descendant of the noble family of Herbert, Earl of Pembroke.{{cn|date=April 2011}}

Phillip was educated at the [[Royal Hospital School|Greenwich Hospital School]] part of [[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Hospital]] and at the age of 13 was apprenticed to the [[merchant navy]].

===Seven Years War===
{{Further|[[Great Britain in the Seven Years War]]}}
Phillip joined the Royal Navy at about fifteen, and saw action at the outbreak of the [[Seven Years' War]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] at the [[Battle of Minorca]] in 1756. In 1762 he was promoted to Lieutenant, but was placed on half pay when the Seven Years War ended in 1763. During this period he married, and farmed in [[Lyndhurst, Hampshire|Lyndhurst]], [[Hampshire]].

In 1774 Phillip joined the Portuguese Navy as a captain, serving in the [[Spanish-Portuguese War, 1776-1777|War against Spain]]. While with the Portuguese Navy, Phillip commanded a frigate, the ''Nossa Senhora do Pilar.'' On this ship he took a detachment of troops from Rio de Janeiro to Colonia do Sacramento on the Rio de la Plata (opposite Buenos Aires) to relieve the garrison there; this voyage also conveyed a consignment of convicts assigned to carry out work at Colonia. During a storm encountered in the course of the voyage, the convicts assisted in working the ship and, on arrival at Colonia, Phillip recommended that they be rewarded for saving the ship by remission of their sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Maurine Goldston-Morris, OAM, ''The Life of Admiral Arthur Phillip, RN, 1738–1814,'' Naval Historical Society of Australia Monograph No.58, Garden Island, [1997].&lt;/ref&gt; A garbled version of this eventually found its way into the English press when Phillip was appointed in 1786 to lead the expedition to Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''The World,'' 16 April 1789: &quot;BOTANY BAY.— Mr. ''Philip,'' who has this command, has the aid of experience. He had a similar expedition entrusted him by PORTUGAL, to carry convicts to South America.&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1778 Britain was again at war, and Phillip was recalled to active service, and in 1779 obtained his first command, the ''Basilisk''. He was promoted to captain in 1781, and was given command of the [[HMS Europa (1765)|''Europe'']], but in 1784 he was back on half pay.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. King, &quot;Arthur Phillip Defensor de Colónia, Governador de Nova Gales do Sul&quot; (&quot;Arthur Phillip: Defender of Colônia, Governor of New South Wales&quot;), ''Anais de História de Além-Mar'' [Portugal], 2005 (6), pp.339–349.

==Governor of New South Wales==
{{refimprove|section|date=January 2011}}
In October 1786, Phillip was appointed captain of [[HMS Sirius (1786)|HMS ''Sirius'']] and named Governor-designate of [[New South Wales]], the proposed British [[penal colony]] on the east coast of Australia, by [[Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney|Lord Sydney]], the [[Home Secretary]]. His choice may have been strongly influenced by [[George Rose]], Under-Secretary of the Treasury and a neighbour of Phillip in Hampshire who would have known of Phillip's farming experience.

Phillip had a very difficult time assembling the fleet which was to make the eight-month sea voyage to Australia. Everything a new colony might need had to be taken, since Phillip had no real idea of what he might find when he got there. There were few funds available for equipping the expedition. His suggestion that people with experience in farming, building and crafts be included was rejected. Most of the 772 convicts (of whom 732 survived the voyage) were petty thieves from the London slums. Phillip was accompanied by a contingent of [[Royal Marines|marines]] and a handful of other officers who were to administer the colony.

The [[First Fleet]], of 11 ships, set sail on 13 May 1787. Captain Arthur Phillip collected a number of [[Cochineal|Cochineal-infested]] plants from Brazil on his way to establish the first British settlement at Botany Bay.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northwestweeds.nsw.gov.au/prickly_pear_history.htm Prickly Pear in Australia&lt;/ref&gt; The leading ship, [[HMS Supply (1759)|HMS Supply]] reached [[Botany Bay]] setting up camp on the [[Cronulla sand dunes, Kurnell Peninsula|Kurnell Peninsula]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15100 The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay] With an Account of the Establishment of the Colonies of [[Port Jackson]] and [[Norfolk Island]] (1789) – from [[Project Gutenberg]]
&lt;/ref&gt; on 18 January 1788. Phillip soon decided that this site, chosen on the recommendation of [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]], who had accompanied [[James Cook]] in 1770, was not suitable, since it had poor soil, no secure anchorage and no reliable water source. After some exploration Phillip decided to go on to Port Jackson, and on 26 January the marines and convicts were landed at [[Sydney Cove]], which Phillip named after Lord Sydney.

Shortly after establishing the settlement at Port Jackson, on 15 February 1788, Phillip sent Lieutenant [[Philip Gidley King]] with 8 free men and a number of convicts to establish the second British colony in the Pacific at [[Norfolk Island]]. This was partly in response to a perceived threat of losing Norfolk Island to the French and partly to establish an alternative food source for the new colony.

The early days of the settlement were chaotic and difficult. With limited supplies, the cultivation of food was imperative, but the soils around Sydney were poor, the climate was unfamiliar, and moreover very few of the convicts had any knowledge of agriculture. Farming tools were scarce and the convicts were unwilling farm labourers. The colony was on the verge of outright [[starvation]] for an extended period. The marines, poorly disciplined themselves in many cases, were not interested in convict discipline. Almost at once, therefore, Phillip had to appoint overseers from among the ranks of the convicts to get the others working. This was the beginning of the process of convict emancipation which was to culminate in the reforms of [[Lachlan Macquarie]] after 1811.

Phillip showed in other ways that he recognised that [[New South Wales]] could not be run simply as a prison camp. Lord Sydney, often criticised as an ineffectual incompetent, had made one fundamental decision about the settlement that was to influence it from the start. Instead of just establishing it as a military prison, he provided for a civil administration, with courts of law. Two convicts, [[Henry Kable|Henry]] and [[Susannah Holmes (convict)|Susannah Kable]], sought to sue Duncan Sinclair, the captain of ''Alexander'', for stealing their possessions during the voyage. Convicts in Britain had no right to sue, and Sinclair had boasted that he could not be sued by them. Someone in Government obviously had a quiet word in Kable's ear, as when the court met and Sinclair challenged the prosecution on the ground that the Kables were felons, the court required him to prove it. As all the convict records had been left behind in England, he could not do so, and the court ordered the captain to make restitution. Further, soon after Lord Sydney appointed him governor of New South Wales Arthur Phillip drew up a detailed memorandum of his plans for the proposed new colony. In one paragraph he wrote: &quot;The laws of this country [England] will of course, be introduced in [New] South Wales, and there is one that I would wish to take place from the moment his Majesty's forces take possession of the country: That there can be no slavery in a free land, and consequently no slaves&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Phillip&quot;&gt;Historical Records of New South Wales, Volume 1, Part 2, Phillip 1783–1792, p 53&lt;/ref&gt; and he meant what he said. Nevertheless, Phillip believed in discipline, and floggings and hangings were commonplace, although Philip commuted many death sentences. [[Image:Arthur Phillip - Project Gutenberg eText 12992.jpg|thumbnail|right|Arthur Phillip]]

Phillip also had to adopt a policy towards the [[Eora]] [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal people]], who lived around the waters of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]]. Phillip ordered that they must be well-treated, and that anyone killing Aboriginal people would be hanged. Phillip befriended an Eora man called [[Bennelong]], and later took him to England. On the beach at [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]], a misunderstanding arose and Phillip was speared in the shoulder: but he ordered his men not to retaliate. Phillip went some way towards winning the trust of the Eora, although the settlers were at all times treated extremely warily. Soon, [[smallpox]] and other European-introduced epidemics ravaged the Eora population.

The Governor's main problem was with his own military officers, who wanted large grants of land, which Phillip had not been authorised to grant. The officers were expected to grow food, but they considered this beneath them. As a result [[scurvy]] broke out, and in October 1788 Phillip had to send ''Sirius'' to [[Cape Town]] for supplies, and strict rationing was introduced, with thefts of food punished by hanging. Arthur Phillip Quoted &quot; The living conditions need to improve or my men won't work as hard, so I have come to an conclusion that I must hire surgeons to fix the convicts.&quot;

==Stabilising the colony==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
By 1790 the situation had stabilised. The population of about 2,000 was adequately housed and fresh food was being grown. Phillip assigned a convict, [[James Ruse]], land at [[Rose Hill]] (now [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]]) to establish proper farming, and when Ruse succeeded he received the first land grant in the colony. Other convicts followed his example. ''Sirius'' was wrecked in March 1790 at the satellite settlement of [[Norfolk Island]], depriving Phillip of vital supplies. In June 1790 the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] arrived with hundreds more convicts, most of them too sick to work. [[Image:ArthurPhillipStatueSydney gobeirne.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Arthur Phillip in the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney]]]]

By December 1790 Phillip was ready to return to England, but the colony had largely been forgotten in London and no instructions reached him, so he carried on. In 1791 he was advised that the government would send out two convoys of convicts annually, plus adequate supplies. But July, when the vessels of the [[Third Fleet]] began to arrive, with 2,000 more convicts, food again ran short, and he had to send a ship to [[Calcutta]] for supplies.

By 1792 the colony was well-established, though Sydney remained an unplanned huddle of wooden huts and tents. The [[whaling|whaling industry]] was established, ships were visiting Sydney to trade, and convicts whose sentences had expired were taking up farming. [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]] and other officers were importing sheep and beginning to grow wool. The colony was still very short of skilled farmers, craftsmen and tradesmen, and the convicts continued to work as little as possible, even though they were working mainly to grow their own food.

In late 1792 Phillip, whose health was suffering from the poor diet, at last received permission to leave, and on 11 December 1792 he sailed in the ship ''Atlantic'', taking with him many specimens of plants and animals. He also took Bennelong and his friend Yemmerrawanyea, another young Indigenous Australian who, unlike Bennelong, would succumb to English weather and disease and not live to make the journey home. The European population of New South Wales at his departure was 4,221, of whom 3,099 were convicts. The early years of the colony had been years of struggle and hardship, but the worst was over, and there were no further famines in New South Wales. Phillip arrived in London in May 1793. He tendered his formal resignation and was granted a pension of £500 a year.

==Later life==
Phillip's wife, Margaret, had died in 1792. In 1794 he married Isabella Whitehead, and lived for a time at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. His health gradually recovered and in 1796 he went back to sea, holding a series of commands and responsible posts in the wars against the French. In January 1799 he became a Rear-Admiral. In 1805, aged 67, he retired from the Navy with the rank of [[Admiral of the Blue]], and spent most of the rest of his life at Bath. He continued to correspond with friends in New South Wales and to promote the colony's interests with government officials. He died in Bath in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Broughton |first =W. |coauthors = |title =Sydney: Sitting Magistrate W.

[[Image:australia.chapel.bathampton.arp.jpg|thumb|right|The Australia Chapel in St Nicholas Church, [[Bathampton]], near Bath, England. The memorial to the first governor of [[New South Wales]] (Arthur Phillip) is on the right hand wall]]
Phillip was buried in St Nicholas's Church, [[Bathampton]]. Forgotten for many years, the grave was discovered in 1897&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stnicholasandstmarys.org.uk/ St Nicholas Church, Bathampton], Burial place of Arthur Phillip&lt;/ref&gt; and the Premier of New South Wales, [[Henry Parkes|Sir Henry Parkes]], had it restored. An annual service of remembrance is held here around Phillip's birthdate by the [[Britain-Australia Society]] to commemorate his life. A monument to Phillip in [[Bath Abbey]] Church was unveiled in 1937. Another was unveiled at St Mildred's Church, Bread St, London, in 1932; that church was destroyed in the [[London Blitz]] in 1940, but the principal elements of the monument were re-erected in [[St Mary-le-Bow]] at the west end of Watling Street, near [[Saint Paul's Cathedral]], in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stmarylebow.co.uk/?International_Links:Australia Details of move]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a statue of him in the [[Royal Botanical Gardens, Sydney|Botanic Gardens, Sydney]]. There is a portrait of him by Francis Wheatley in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].

His name is commemorated in Australia by [[Port Phillip]], [[Phillip Island (Victoria)]], [[Phillip Island (Norfolk Island)]], the [[Division of Phillip|federal electorate of Phillip]] (1949–1993), the [[Phillip, Australian Capital Territory|suburb of Phillip]] in [[Canberra]], and many streets, parks and schools. 

[[Percival Serle]] wrote of Phillip in his ''Dictionary of Australian Biography'': 
{{cquote|Steadfast in mind, modest, without self seeking, Phillip had imagination enough to conceive what the settlement might become, and the common sense to realize what at the moment was possible and expedient. When almost everyone was complaining he never himself complained, when all feared disaster he could still hopefully go on with his work. He was sent out to found a convict settlement, he laid the foundations of a great dominion.&lt;ref name=ps-dab&gt;{{cite web|last=Serle|first=Percival|title=Phillip, Arthur (1738-1814), admiral, and first governor of New South Wales|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/dictbiog/0-dict-biogP-Q.html#phillip1|work=Dictionary of Australian Biography|publisher=Project Gutenberg Australia|accessdate=3 March 2011|year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Loss of remains==
In 2007, [[Geoffrey Robertson|Geoffrey Robertson QC]] alleged that Phillip's remains are no longer in St Nicholas Church, Bathampton and have been lost: &quot;...Captain Arthur Phillip is not where the ledger stone says he is: it may be that he is buried somewhere outside, it may simply be that he is simply lost. But he is not where Australians have been led to believe that he now lies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=262243&amp;_cobr=optus# Lost the plot&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson also believes it was a &quot;disgraceful slur&quot; on Phillip's legacy that he was not buried in one of England's great [[cathedral]]s and was relegated to a small village church. Robertson is campaigning for a rigorous search for the remains, which he believes should be re-interred in Australia.

==Popular culture==
Phillip is a prominent character in [[Timberlake Wertenbaker]]'s play ''[[Our Country's Good]]'', in which he commissions Lieutenant Ralph Clark to stage a production of ''[[The Recruiting Officer]]''. He is shown as compassionate and just, but receives little support from his fellow officers.

Phillip is referred to in the [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]] song &quot;Chains around my ankle&quot;.

[[Kate Grenville|Kate Grenville's]] 2008 novel ''[[The Lieutenant (novel)|The Lieutenant]]'' portrays Phillip through the character Commodore James Gilbert.

'''Angus''' (''Aonghas'' in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]) is one of the 32 [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] [[council areas]] of [[Scotland]], a [[registration county]] and a [[Lieutenancy areas of Scotland|lieutenancy area]]. The council area borders onto [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Perth and Kinross]] and [[Dundee City]]. Main industries include [[agriculture]] and [[fishing]].

==History==
Angus was historically a [[Counties of Scotland|county]] (known officially as '''Forfarshire''' from the eighteenth century until 1928, when it reverted to its ancient name) until 1975 when it became a district of the [[Tayside]] [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|Region]]. In 1996, two-tier local government was abolished and Angus was established as a [[unitary authority]]. The former county had borders with [[Kincardineshire]] to the north-east, [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|county of Aberdeenshire]] to the north and [[Perthshire]] to the west. Southwards, it faced [[Fife]] across the [[Firth of Tay]]. The boundaries of the present council area are exactly the same as those of the old county minus the City of [[Dundee]].

==Parliamentary representation==
Areas similar to that of the council area are covered by the [[Angus (UK Parliament constituency)|Angus Westminster constituency for the UK Parliament]] and the area is also represented at the Scottish Parliament by both the [[Angus (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Angus]] and [[North Tayside (Scottish Parliament constituency)|North Tayside Holyrood constituencies]].

==Geography==
Angus can be split into three geographic areas. To the north and west, the [[topography]] is mountainous; this is the area of the five [[Angus Glens]], is sparsely populated and the main industry is [[hill-farming]]. To the south and east the topography consists of rolling hills bordering the sea. This area is well populated, with the larger towns and the city of Dundee on the coast. In between lies [[Strathmore, Angus and Perth &amp; Kinross|Strathmore]], Gaelic for ''the Great Valley'', which is a fertile agricultural area noted for the growing of potatoes, soft fruit and the raising of [[Angus cattle]].

'''André René Roussimoff''' ({{lang-bg|Андрей Рене Русимов}}; {{lang-pl|Andrzej Renat Russimow}}) (19 May 1946 – 27 January 1993),&lt;ref name=&quot;OWOW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/a/andre-the-giant.html|title=André the Giant Profile|accessdate=2008-09-22| publisher=Online World Of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb-bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=André the Giant|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000764/| accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; best known as '''André the Giant''', was a French [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and [[actor]]. He is well known as Fezzik in the classic movie ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;official&quot;/&gt; His great size was a result of [[gigantism]], and led to him being dubbed &quot;The [[Eighth Wonder of the World]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwebio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Andre the Giant: Bio|publisher=WWE|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/andrethegiant|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AndreWebsite&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.andrethegiant.com/|title=André the Giant official website|accessdate=2007-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), Roussimoff is a [[List of WWE Champions|one-time]] [[WWE Championship|WWF Champion]]&lt;ref name=wwechamp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454122|title=Andre the Giant's first reign|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)|one-time]] [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Champion]].&lt;ref name=tagchamp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321111121|title=Andre the Giant and Haku's first reign|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, he was the first inductee into the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWF Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wwebio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE Legends|last=Solomon|first=Brian|pages=68–71|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2006|isbn=0-7434-9033-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
André René Roussimoff was born in [[France]], of [[Bulgaria]]n and [[Poland|Polish]] descent. He was the third of five children. As a child, he was referred to by his parents as Dédé and very early on displayed symptoms of his [[gigantism]], reaching a height of 6'3&quot; and weight of {{convert|240|lb}} by age 12. Unable to fit on the school bus he was driven to school by playwright [[Samuel Beckett]] who was an acquaintance of his father.&lt;ref&gt;http://historicalmeetups.com/post/1524567373/samuel-beckett-playwright-novelist-and-nobel&lt;/ref&gt; Roussimoff was a good student but left school after 8th grade because he did not feel having a high school education was necessary to live and work on a farm that was not his own. As an adolescent, he worked on the farm, completed an [[apprenticeship]] in [[woodworking]], then worked in a [[factory]] that manufactured [[engine]]s for hay [[baler]]s, but none of these jobs brought him any satisfaction.&lt;ref name=AEbio&gt;{{cite episode|title=André the Giant|series=Biography|network=[[A&amp;E Network]]|airdate=1999-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career===
At 18 years of age, Roussimoff moved to [[Paris]] and was taught [[professional wrestling]] by a local promoter who knew there would be good money in André's future. Roussimoff trained at night and worked as a mover during the day in order to pay living expenses.&lt;ref name=AEbio/&gt; Roussimoff was billed as &quot;Géant Ferré&quot;, taken from the name of a mythical French giant, and began his career wrestling in [[Paris]] and surrounding areas. [[Montreal]]-native promoter and wrestler, Frank Valois, met Roussimoff in 1966 and became his business manager and close adviser. For the next few years, Roussimoff began making a name for himself wrestling in [[England]], [[Germany]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=LegendaryNames4&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=4|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LegendaryNames7&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=7|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AEbio/&gt;

Roussimoff made his [[Japan]] debut in 1970, billed as &quot;Monster Roussimoff&quot;, wrestling for [[International Pro Wrestling|International Wrestling Enterprise]]. Wrestling there as both a singles and tag team competitor, he quickly won the company's tag team championship alongside Michael Nador.&lt;ref name=LegendaryNames7/&gt;&lt;ref name=IWAtagchamp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/japan/iwe/iwe-t.html|title=IWA World Tag Team Title|publisher=Wrestling Titles|accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during Roussimoff's time in Japan when doctors first informed him that he suffered from [[acromegaly]], a hormonal disorder, which can lead to [[gigantism]].&lt;ref name=LegendaryNames7/&gt;&lt;ref name=AEbio/&gt;

After his stint in Japan, Roussimoff moved to [[Montreal]], [[Canada]]. He became an immediate success, regularly selling out the [[Montreal Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pain and Passion|last=McCoy|first=Heath|page=96|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-1-55022-787-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, promoters eventually ran out of plausible opponents to fight him and, as his novelty wore off, gate receipts dwindled.&lt;ref name=AEbio/&gt; In 1972, Roussimoff wrestled numerous times for [[Verne Gagne]]'s [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) as a special attraction until Valois reached out to [[Vince McMahon, Sr.]], founder of the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF) for help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=9|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon suggested a couple of changes to Roussimoff's gimmick. He felt Roussimoff should be portrayed as a large, immovable monster. To enhance his significant size McMahon discouraged Roussimoff from performing maneuvers such as [[dropkick]]s, as he had been doing due to his natural athleticism. McMahon also began billing Roussimoff as &quot;André the Giant&quot; and set up a travel-intensive schedule, loaning him to wrestling territories all over the world,&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dusty: Reflections of an American Dream|last=Rhodes|first=Dusty|pages=95–96|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2005|isbn=978-1-58261-907-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; so he would not wear out his welcome in any one area.&lt;ref name=AEbio/&gt; To receive André, promoters had to guarantee André a certain amount of money, as well as pay McMahon's WWWF a booking fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=12–13|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Wide Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Federation===
====Face run (1973–1987)====
On March 26, 1973, André made his WWWF debut as a [[face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]], defeating [[Buddy Wolfe]] in [[New York]]'s [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;official&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WWWF73&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/73.htm|title=WWWF @ New York City, NY - Madison Square Garden - March 26, 1973|publisher=The History of WWE|accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

André was one of WWF's most beloved &quot;babyfaces&quot; throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. As such, [[Gorilla Monsoon]] insisted that André was never defeated for 15 years by pinfall or submission prior to WrestleMania III. This, however, is not true. André actually had lost cleanly in matches outside of the parameters of WWF; a pinfall loss in Mexico to Canek in 1984 and a submission loss in Japan to [[Antonio Inoki]] in June 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legendary110&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=110|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/inoki.html|title=Antonio Inoki: Career History|publisher=Puroresu Central|accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also went sixty-minute time limit draws with the two other major world champions of the day, [[Harley Race]] and [[Nick Bockwinkel]].

In 1982, Vince McMahon, Sr. sold the World Wrestling Federation (which had dropped &quot;Wide&quot; from its name in 1979) to his son, [[Vince McMahon|Vince McMahon, Jr.]]. As McMahon began to expand his newly acquired promotion to the national level, he required his wrestlers to appear exclusively for him. McMahon signed André to these terms in 1984, although he still allowed the Giant to work in Japan for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=69–70|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of André's feuds pitted him against &quot;the Mongolian Giant&quot; [[Killer Khan]]. According to the storyline, Khan had snapped André's ankle during a match on May 2, 1981, in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York]] by leaping off the top rope and crashing down upon it with his knee-drop.&lt;ref name=MainEvent&gt;{{cite book|title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s|last=Shields|Brian|pages=55–58|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, André had broken his ankle getting out of bed the morning before the match.&lt;ref name=AEbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=48|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injury and subsequent rehabilitation was worked into the existing André/Khan storyline. After a stay at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, André returned with payback on his mind. The two battled on July 20, 1981 at Madison Square Garden in a match that resulted in a [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|double disqualification]]. Their feud continued through the summer and fall as fans filled arenas up and down the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] to witness their matches. On November 14, 1981 at the [[Spectrum (arena)|Philadelphia Spectrum]], the feud culminated when André decisively defeated Khan in what was billed as a &quot;Mongolian Stretcher Match&quot;, in which the loser must be taken to the dressing room on a stretcher.&lt;ref name=Legendary48&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=48–60|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feud involved a man who considered himself to be &quot;the true giant&quot; of wrestling: [[Big John Studd]].&lt;ref name=MainEvent/&gt; Throughout the early to mid-1980s, André and Studd fought all over the world, battling to try and determine who the real giant of wrestling was. In December 1984, Studd took the feud to a new level, when he and partner [[Ken Patera]] knocked out André during a televised tag team match and proceeded to cut off André's hair.&lt;ref name=MainEvent/&gt; After gaining revenge on Patera, André met Studd in a &quot;[[Body Slam]] Challenge&quot; at the first [[WrestleMania (1985)|WrestleMania]], held March 31, 1985 at Madison Square Garden in New York City. André slammed Studd to win the match and collect the [[United States dollar|$]]15,000 prize, then proceeded to throw cash to the fans before having the bag stolen from him by Studd's manager, [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan]].&lt;ref name=WMIfacts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm1/factsstats/|title=WrestleMania I Facts/Stats|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, at [[WrestleMania 2]] on April 7, 1986, André continued to display his dominance by winning a twenty-man [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] which featured top [[National Football League|NFL]] stars and wrestlers.&lt;ref name=WM2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm2/results/|title=WrestleMania 2 results|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; André last eliminated [[Bret Hart]] to win the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=107|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, André continued his feud with Studd and [[King Kong Bundy]]. André was suspended after a no-show (in reality, he needed time off to film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''); he returned under a mask as &quot;The Giant Machine&quot; part of a team with &quot;Big Machine&quot; ([[Robert Windham]]) and &quot;Super Machine&quot; ([[Bill Eadie]]) (The Machines gimmick was copied from [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] character &quot;Super Strong Machine&quot;, played by Japanese wrestler [[Junji Hirata]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/machines.html|title=The Machines' Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, Giant Machine disappeared, and André was reinstated, to the approval of Bobby Heenan.

====Feud with Hulk Hogan; WWF Championship (1987–1988)====
André agreed to [[Turned heel|turn]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] in early 1987 to be the counter to the biggest &quot;[[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]]&quot; in professional wrestling at that time, [[Hulk Hogan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=131|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; On an edition of ''[[Piper's Pit]]'' in January 1987, Hogan was presented a trophy for being the [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] for three years; André came out to congratulate him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=132–133|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the following week's ''Piper's Pit'', André was presented a slightly smaller trophy for being &quot;the only undefeated wrestler in wrestling history.&quot; Although André had suffered a handful of [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]] and [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] losses in WWF, he had never been pinned or forced to submit in a WWF ring. Hogan came out to congratulate André and ended up being the focal point of the interview. A visibly annoyed André walked out in the midst of Hogan's speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=134–135|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm|title=WWF @ East Rutherford, NJ - Meadowlands - January 5, 1987|publisher=The History of WWE|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;discussion&quot;  between André and Hogan was scheduled, and on a ''Piper's Pit'' that aired February 7, 1987, the two met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm|title=WWF @ Tampa, FL - SunDome - January 26, 1987|publisher=The History of WWE|accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogan was introduced first, followed by André. However, much to the shock of both Hogan and host, [[Roddy Piper]], André was led by longtime rival Bobby Heenan. Speaking on behalf of his new protege, Heenan accused Hogan of using André. Hogan tried to reason with André but his pleads were ignored as he challenged Hogan to a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at [[WrestleMania III]] before ripping the t-shirt and [[crucifix]] from Hogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=136–139|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At WrestleMania III, he was billed at {{convert|520|lb|kg|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=WMIII&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm3/mainevent/|title=WrestleMania III - Andre the Giant vs. Hulk Hogan - WWE Championship|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the stress of such immense weight on his bones and joints resulted in constant pain.&lt;ref name=AEbio/&gt; After recent back surgery, he was also wearing a brace underneath his wrestling [[Wrestling singlet|singlet]]. Hogan won the match after body slamming André, followed by Hogan's running leg drop finisher.&lt;ref name=WMIII/&gt; Years later, Hogan claimed that André was so heavy, he felt more like {{convert|700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, and that he actually tore his [[latissimus dorsi]] muscle slamming him. Another famous story about the match is that no one knew if André would lose the match. André had agreed to lose the match some time before, mostly for health reasons, though he almost pinned Hogan (albeit unintentionally) in the early goings of the match. Contrary to popular belief, it was not the first time that Hogan had successfully bodyslammed André in a WWF match. A then-heel Hogan bodyslammed a then-face André early in a match in [[Hamburg, Pennsylvania|Hamburg]], [[Pennsylvania]] on September 13, 1980, though André was much lighter and more athletic at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE]]|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, of course, took place back in the territorial days of wrestling three years before WWF began its national expansion (André had also previously allowed [[Harley Race]], [[El Canek]], and [[Stan Hansen]] to slam him.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=157|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=King of the Ring: The Harley Race Story|last=Race|first=Harley|page=90|publisher=Sports Publishing L.L.C.|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58261-818-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time WrestleMania III had rolled around, the WWF had gone national, giving more meaning to the André-Hogan match that took place then. The feud between André and Hogan simmered during the summer of 1987, even as Roussimoff's health declined. The feud would begin heating up again when each wrestler was named the captain of rival teams at the inaugural [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]] event. André's team won the main event after André pinned [[Bam Bam Bigelow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1987/mainevent/|title=Survivor Series 1987 - Main Event|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, [[Ted DiBiase|&quot;The Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase]] failed to persuade Hogan to sell him the WWF World Championship. After failing to defeat Hogan in a subsequent series of matches, DiBiase turned to André to win it for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=172–175|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acting as his hired gun, André won the WWF title from Hogan on February 5, 1988 in a match where it was later revealed appointed [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] [[Dave Hebner]] was &quot;detained backstage&quot;, and a replacement who DiBiase paid to get plastic surgery to look like Dave (in reality, his twin brother [[Earl Hebner]]), made a three count on Hogan while his shoulders were off the mat. After winning, André &quot;sold&quot; the title to DiBiase; the transaction was declared invalid by then-[[Professional wrestling authority figures|WWF President]] [[Jack Tunney]] and the title was vacated.&lt;ref name=wwechamp/&gt; This was shown on WWF's [[NBC]] program ''[[WWF The Main Event|The Main Event]]''. At [[WrestleMania IV]], André and Hulk Hogan fought to a double disqualification in a WWF title tournament match (with the idea in the storyline saying that André was again working on DiBiase's behalf in giving DiBiase a clearer path in the tournament). Afterward, André and Hogan's feud died down after a steel cage match held at ''WrestleFest'' on July 31, 1988 in Milwaukee. He and DiBiase also wrestled Hogan and [[Randy Savage|&quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage]] in the main event of [[SummerSlam (1988)|SummerSlam]]; the DiBiase-André team lost, despite apparently having [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|referee]] [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse &quot;the Body&quot; Ventura]] on their side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1988/mainevent1/|title=SummerSlam 1988 main event match details|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrent with the developing feud with the Mega Powers, André was placed in a feud with [[Jim Duggan|&quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan]], which began after Duggan knocked out André with his 2x4 during a television taping. Despite Duggan's popularity with fans, André regularly got the upper hand in the feud.

====Various feuds; The Colossal Connection; WrestleMania VI (1988–1990)====
André's next major feud was against [[Jake Roberts|Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts]]. In this storyline, it was said André was deathly [[Ophidiophobia|afraid of snakes]], something Roberts exposed on ''[[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event|Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' when he threw his snake, Damien, on the frightened André; as a result, André suffered a [[kayfabe]] mild heart attack and vowed revenge. During the next few weeks, Roberts frequently walked to ringside during André's matches, causing him to run from the ring in fright (since he knew what was inside the bag). Throughout their feud (which culminated at [[WrestleMania V]]), Roberts constantly used Damien to gain a psychological edge over the much larger and stronger André.

In 1989, André and the returning Big John Studd briefly reprised their feud, this time with Studd as a face and André as the heel. During the late summer and fall of 1989, André engaged in a brief feud, almost entirely consisting of [[house show]]s (non-televised events), with then-[[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental champion]] [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]]. The younger Warrior, WWF's rising star, regularly [[squash match|squashed]] the aging André in an attempt to showcase his star quality and promote him as the &quot;next big thing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=297–300|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling|last=Hart|first=Bret|page=233|publisher=[[Grand Central Publishing]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-446-53972-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1989, André was joined with fellow [[The Heenan Family|Heenan Family]] member [[Tonga Fifita|Haku]] to form a new tag team called [[Colossal Connection|The Colossal Connection]], in part to fill a void left by the departure of [[Tully Blanchard]] and [[Arn Anderson]] ([[The Brain Busters]], who were also members of Heenan's stable) from the WWF, and also to continue to keep the aging André in the main event spotlight. The Colossal Connection immediately targeted WWF Tag Team Champions [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] (who had recently won the belts from the Brain Busters). At a television taping on December 13, 1989, the Colossal Connection defeated Demolition to win the titles.&lt;ref name=tagchamp/&gt; André and Haku successfully defended their titles, mostly against Demolition, until [[WrestleMania VI]] on April 1, 1990, when Demolition took advantage of a mistimed move by the champions to regain the belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321241|title=Demolition's third reign|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, a furious Heenan blamed André for the title loss and after shouting at him slapped him in the face; an angry André responded with a slap of his own that sent Heenan staggering from the ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=321–322|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; André also caught Haku's kick attempt, sending him reeling from the ring as well, prompting loud cheers for André for the first time in three years. André went into the match as a heel, but left as a face.

===Sporadic appearances===
André continued to make appearances in the WWF throughout 1990 and 1991. He came to the aid of [[Ray Traylor|The Big Bossman]] in his [[WrestleMania VII]] match against [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=326|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last major WWF storyline following WrestleMania VII had the major heel managers (Bobby Heenan, [[Sherri Martel|Sensational Sherri]], [[Ken Johnson (wrestling)|Slick]], and [[Mr. Fuji]]) trying to recruit André one-by-one, only to be turned down in various humiliating ways (i.e. Heenan had his hand crushed, Sherri received a spanking, Slick got locked in the trunk of the car he was offering to André and Mr Fuji got a pie in his face). Finally, [[Jimmy Hart]] appeared live on WWF Superstars to announce that he successfully signed André to tag-team with [[John Tenta|Earthquake]]. However, when asked to confirm by [[Gene Okerlund]], André denied the claims. This led to Earthquake attacking André from behind (injuring his knee).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm | title = WWF Show Results 1991 | accessdate = March 5, 2011| author = Graham Cawthon | quote = (Date: May 6, 1991 Shown: June 1, 1991)Included an in-ring interview by Gene Okerlund in which Andre the Giant refused Jimmy Hart's offer to become his manager only to have his knee attacked by Earthquake, using Hart's megaphone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jimmy Hart would later get revenge for the humiliation by secretly signing [[Fred Ottman|Tugboat]] and forming [[The Natural Disasters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm | title = WWF Show Results 1991 | accessdate = March 5, 2011| author = Graham Cawthon | quote = (Date: May 28, 1991 Shown: June 15, 1991)Earthquake &amp; WWF Tag Team Champions the Nasty Boys (w/ Jimmy Hart) defeated Tugboat &amp; the Bushwhackers at 4:05 when Earthquake pinned Luke with a sit-down splash after Tugboat attacked both of his teammates; after the match, Tugboat embraced with his new friends}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to André's final major WWF appearance at [[SummerSlam (1991)|SummerSlam]] '91, where he seconded [[The Bushwhackers]] in their match against the Disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=333|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also made an appearance later in the year to help [[The British Bulldog]] who had just won a Battle Royal in [[London]].

His last [[United States|U.S.]] television appearance was in a brief interview on [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s (WCW) ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XX: 20th Anniversary|Clash of the Champions XX]]'' special that aired on [[TBS (TV channel)|TBS]] on September 2, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=336|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===All Japan Pro Wrestling (1990–1992)===
After WrestleMania VI, André spent the rest of his in-ring career in [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW). He toured with AJPW three times per year, from September 1990 to 1992, usually teaming with [[Shohei Baba|Giant Baba]] in tag team matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=335|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrestled his final match in December 1992.

==Acting career==
André branched out into acting in the 1970s and 1980s, making his acting debut playing a Sasquatch (&quot;[[Bigfoot]]&quot;) on the 1970s television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=18–19|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to appear in other television shows, including ''[[The Greatest American Hero]]'', ''[[B.J. and the Bear]]'', and ''[[The Fall Guy]]''. He also participated in an episode of ''[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0755189/|title=&quot;Zorro&quot; Big Brother (TV episode 1991)|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of his career, André also starred in several [[film|movies]]. He had an uncredited appearance in the [[1984 in film|1984 film]] — ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'', as Dagoth,&lt;ref name=&quot;Legendary79&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=79|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087078/fullcredits#cast|title=Full cast and crew for Conan the Destroyer|publisher=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; the resurrected horned giant god who is killed by Conan ([[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]). But he appeared most notably as Fezzik (his favorite role)&lt;ref name=&quot;official&quot;/&gt; in the [[1987 in film|1987 film]] ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''. Both the film and Andre's performance have retained a devoted following.

In his final film, he appeared in something of a cameo role as a [[circus]] giant in the comedy ''[[Trading Mom]]'', which was not released until the year after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0111470/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070213084344/http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0111470/|archivedate=2007-02-13|title=''Trading Mom'' (IMDB)|accessdate=2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Roussimoff had one daughter,&lt;ref name=AEbio/&gt; Robin Christensen, who was born in 1979.

The disease that granted him his immense size eventually began to take its toll on his body. By the late 1980s, André was in constant, near-crippling pain, and his heart struggled to pump blood throughout his massive body.

According to [[William Goldman]], author of ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' and its respective screenplay, André was having such terrible back pain during the filming of the movie that in the first shooting of a scene where [[Robin Wright (actress)|Robin Wright]] drops about one foot and is caught by André, he fell to one knee and almost dropped her.

In the A&amp;E documentary, ''Biography'', [[Arnold Skaaland]] mentions how André wished he could see a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play. Arnold offered to buy tickets, but André then passed up the opportunity, citing how he was too big for the seats and that people behind him would not be able to see. This was cited as a principal reason for why André frequented taverns more than anywhere else.

André was mentioned in the 1974 [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]] as the highest paid wrestler in history up to that time. He had earned [[United States dollar|$]]400,000 in one year alone during the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=18|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been unofficially crowned &quot;The Greatest Drunk on Earth&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=123|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for once consuming 119 {{convert|12|USfloz|adj=on}} beers in 6 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madconomist.com/5-coolest-beer-records|title=5 Coolest Beer Records|publisher=MadConomist|last=Davydov|first=Dmitri|date=2008-05-20|accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On an episode of WWE's ''Legends of Wrestling'', [[Mike Graham]] claimed that André once drank 156 {{convert|16|USfloz|ml|adj=on}} beers in one sitting, which was confirmed by [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]. Such feats can be attributed to his much larger than usual size, meaning it would take higher volumes of liquor to inebriate him. In her autobiography, [[The Fabulous Moolah]] alleges that André drank 127 beers in a [[Reading, Pennsylvania]] hotel bar and later passed out in the lobby. Because the staff could not move him, they had to leave him there until he regained consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ellison, Lillian|title=The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle|year=2003|isbn=9780060012588|publisher=ReaganBooks|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

André was arrested by the [[Linn County, Iowa]] sheriff in August 1989 and charged with assault after he allegedly roughed up a local television cameraman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080530034919/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/andregiantmug1.html The Smoking Gun].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=300|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
André died in his sleep due to [[congestive heart failure]] on the night of January 27, 1993, in a [[Paris]] hotel room.&lt;ref name=&quot;official&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=337|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was in Paris to attend the funeral of his father.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3D6113AF932A05752C0A965958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Andre&amp;st=nyt Andre the Giant, 46, Professional Wrestler (Obituary)] ''New York Times'', 31 January 1993. &lt;!--retrieved 23 June 2008--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; André's body was [[Cremation|cremated]] in accordance with his wishes and his ashes scattered at his ranch in [[Ellerbe, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=AEbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wral.com/news/local/video/4797970/ WRAL News, Raleigh, NC.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
*In 1993 when the then-[[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] created the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWF Hall of Fame]], André the Giant was the first inductee&lt;ref name=&quot;wwebio&quot;/&gt; (and the only 1993 inductee).

*André was the inspiration for the [[1998 in film|1998 film]] ''[[My Giant]]'', written by his friend [[Billy Crystal]], whom he had met during the filming of ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''.

*[[Paul Wight]], better known as &quot;The Big Show&quot;, is more similar in body structure to André than any other wrestler since André's death. Wight was originally billed as the son of André during his stint in [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] (when he was known as simply &quot;The Giant&quot;) despite no biological relation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=341–342|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While also suffering from [[acromegaly]], unlike André, Wight did get surgery on his [[pituitary gland]] in the early 1990s, which successfully halted the progress of his condition. The former wrestler [[Jorge Gonzáles|Giant González]] suffered from problems similar to those that André had near the end of his life and died in September 2010 due to [[diabetes]] complications.

*André is cited and impersonated in the comedy film ''[[I Love You, Man]]''.

*He is also cited in the [[Eminem]] song &quot;[[Crack a Bottle]]&quot; in the lyrics &quot;Back with Andre the Giant, mister [[elephant]] tusk, picture us and you'll be another one to bite the dust&quot;. André is also cited in the movie ''[[The 40 Year Old Virgin]]'' when the protagonist quotes a woman (actually a transvestite) he met who &quot;had hands like Andre The Giant.&quot;

*The [[OBEY]] brand icon originated from a stencil that artist [[Shepard Fairey]] had created based upon a photo of Andre the Giant that Fairey had found in a newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;http://obeyclothing.com/#/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Capcom]]'s video game character [[Hugo (Street Fighter)|Hugo Andore]] is based on him. 

*André has made appearances as himself in videogames for years, as early as 1989's  ''[[WWF Superstars]]'', where he appears as a non-playable [[Boss (videogame)|game boss]] along [[Ted DiBiase]], fighting as their real-life tag team ''[[The Mega Bucks]]'', to as recently as ''[[WWE All-Stars]]'', released in March 2011, where he appears as one of many playable &quot;Legend&quot; characters. 

*On January 25, 2005, WWE released ''André The Giant'', a [[DVD]] focusing on the life and career of André.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/WWE-Andre-Giant/dp/B00079I0BU/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1297837008&amp;sr=1-1|title=WWE - Andre the Giant|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD is a reissue of the out-of-print ''André The Giant'' [[VHS]] made by [[WWE Home Video|Coliseum Video]] in 1985, with commentary by [[Michael Cole]] and [[Tazz]] replacing [[Gorilla Monsoon]] and [[Jesse Ventura]]'s commentary on his [[WrestleMania (1985)|WrestleMania]] match with Big John Studd. The video is hosted by [[Alfred Hayes (wrestler)|Lord Alfred Hayes]]. Later matches, including André's battles against Hulk Hogan while a [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], are not included on this DVD.

'''Adrastea''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|æ|d|r|ə|ˈ|s|t|iː|ə}} {{Respell|AD|rə|STEE|ə}}; {{lang-el|Αδράστεια}}), also known as '''{{nowrap|Jupiter XV}}''', is the second by distance, and the smallest of the four [[Inner satellites of Jupiter|inner moons of Jupiter]]. It was discovered in ''[[Voyager 2|Voyager&amp;nbsp;2]]'' probe photographs taken in 1979, making it the first [[natural satellite]] to be discovered from images taken by an interplanetary [[spacecraft]], rather than through telescopic photography.&lt;ref name=discov/&gt; It was officially named after the mythological [[Adrastea (mythology)|Adrastea]], foster mother of [[Greek god]] [[Zeus]]—the equivalent of [[Roman god]] [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref name=name/&gt; Adrastea is one of the few moons in the [[Solar System]] known to orbit its planet in  less than the length of that planet's day. It orbits at the edge of [[Rings of Jupiter#Main ring|Jupiter's Main Ring]] and is thought to be the main contributor of material to the [[Rings of Jupiter]]. Despite observations made in the 1990s by the [[Galileo spacecraft]], very little is known about the moon's physical characteristics outside its size and the fact that it is [[tidally locked]] to [[Jupiter]].

==Discovery and observations==
[[File:Adrastée FDS 20630.png|thumb|300px|left|Discovery image of Adrastea, taken on July 8, 1979, by Voyager&amp;nbsp;2. Adrastea is the dot in the very middle, straddling the line of the Jovian rings.]]
Adrastea was discovered by [[David Jewitt|David C. Jewitt]] and [[G. Edward Danielson]] in ''[[Voyager 2|Voyager&amp;nbsp;2]]'' probe photographs taken on July 8, 1979, and received the designation '''{{nowrap|S/1979&amp;nbsp;J&amp;nbsp;1}}'''.&lt;ref name=discov&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/03400/03454.html|journal=IAU Circulars|volume=3454|author=Marsden, Brian G. |title=Editorial Notice|date=1980-02-25}} (discovery)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jewitt1979&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jewitt|first=D.C.|coauthors=Danielson, G.E.; Synnott, S.P. |title=Discovery of a New Jupiter Satellite|journal=Science|year=1979|volume=206|pages=951 |issue=4421 |doi=10.1126/science.206.4421.951 |pmid=17733911 |bibcode = 1979Sci...206..951J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it appeared only as a dot,&lt;ref name=Jewitt1979/&gt; it was the first moon to be discovered by an interplanetary spacecraft. Soon after its discovery, two other of the inner [[moons of Jupiter]] ([[Thebe (moon)|Thebe]] and [[Metis (moon)|Metis]]) were observed in the images taken a few weeks earlier by ''[[Voyager 1|Voyager&amp;nbsp;1]]''. The [[Galileo spacecraft|''Galileo'' spacecraft]] was able to determine the moon's shape in 1998, but the images remain poor.&lt;ref name=Thomas1998/&gt; In 1983, Adrastea was officially named after the Greek nymph [[Adrastea (mythology)|Adrastea]], the daughter of [[Zeus]] and his lover [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]].&lt;ref name=name&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/03800/03872.html|journal=IAU Circulars |volume=3872|title=Satellites of Jupiter and Saturn|author=Marsden, Brian G. |date=1983-09-30}} (naming the moon)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical characteristics==
Adrastea has an irregular shape and measures 20&amp;times;16&amp;times;14&amp;nbsp;km across.&lt;ref name=Thomas1998/&gt; This makes it the smallest of the four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]],&lt;ref name=Burns2004/&gt; around 0.86&amp;nbsp;g/cm³,&lt;ref name=Anderson2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=J.D.|coauthors=Johnson, T.V.; Shubert, G.; et al.|title=Amalthea’s Density Is Less Than That of Water |journal=Science |year=2005|volume=308|pages=1291–1293|doi=10.1126/science.1110422| bibcode=2005Sci...308.1291A|pmid=15919987|issue=5726}}&lt;/ref&gt; its mass can be estimated at about 2{{Esp|15}}&amp;nbsp;kg. Amalthea's density implies that the moon is composed of water [[ice]] with a [[porosity]] of 10–15%, and Adrastea may be similar.&lt;ref name=Anderson2005/&gt;

No surface details of Adrastea are known, due to the low resolution of available images.&lt;ref name=Thomas1998/&gt;

==Orbit==
Adrastea is the smallest and second closest member of the [[inner satellites of Jupiter|inner Jovian satellite family]]. It orbits [[Jupiter]] at a radius of about 129,000&amp;nbsp;km (1.806&amp;nbsp;Jupiter radii) at the exterior edge of the planet's [[Rings_of_Jupiter#Main_ring|Main Ring]].&lt;ref name=Burns2004/&gt;
Adrastea is only one of the three moons in the [[Solar System]] known to orbit its planet in  less than the length of that planet's day—the other two being Jupiter's innermost moon [[Metis (moon)|Metis]], and [[Mars]]' moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]]. The orbit has very small [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and [[inclination]]&amp;mdash;around 0.0015 and 0.03°, respectively.  Inclination is relative to the equator of [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref name=Burns2004/&gt;

Due to [[tidal locking]], Adrastea rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping one face always looking toward the planet. Its long axis is aligned towards [[Jupiter]], this being the lowest energy configuration.&lt;ref name=Thomas1998/&gt;

The orbit of Adrastea lies inside [[Jupiter]]'s [[synchronous orbit]] radius (as does [[Metis (moon)|Metis]]’s), and as a result, [[tidal deceleration|tidal force]]s are slowly causing its orbit to decay so that it will one day impact Jupiter. If its density is similar to Amalthea's then its orbit would actually lie within the fluid [[Roche limit]]. However, since it is not breaking up, it must still lie outside its rigid Roche limit.&lt;ref name=Burns2004/&gt;

==Relationship with Jupiter's rings==
Adrastea is the largest contributor to material in [[rings of Jupiter|Jupiter's rings]]. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of [[Inner satellites of Jupiter|Jupiter's four small inner satellites]] by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This is because, due to the satellites' low density, their surfaces lie rather close to the edge of their [[Roche sphere]]s.&lt;ref name=Burns2004/&gt;

It seems that Adrastea is the most copious source of this ring material, as evidenced by the densest ring (the [[Rings of Jupiter#Main ring|Main Ring]]) being located at and within  Adrastea's orbit.&lt;ref name=Burns1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burns|first=J.A.|coauthors=Showalter, M.R.; Hamilton, D.P.; et al.|title=The Formation of Jupiter's Faint Rings|journal=Science|year=1999|volume=284|pages=1146–1150|doi=10.1126/science.284.5417.1146| bibcode=1999Sci...284.1146B|pmid=10325220|issue=5417}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, the orbit of Adrastea lies near the outer edge of Jupiter's Main Ring.&lt;ref name=Ockert-Bell1999&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ockert-Bell |first=M. E. |coauthors=Burns, J. A.; Daubar, I. J.; ''et al.'' |title=The Structure of Jupiter’s Ring System as Revealed by the Galileo Imaging Experiment |journal=Icarus |year=1999 |volume=138 |issue=2 |pages=188&amp;ndash;213 |doi=10.1006/icar.1998.6072 |bibcode= 1999Icar..138..188O}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exact extent of visible ring material depends on the phase angle of the images: in [[light scattering|forward-scattered light]] Adrastea is firmly outside the Main Ring,&lt;ref name=Ockert-Bell1999/&gt; but in back-scattered light (which reveals much bigger particles) there appears to also be a narrow ringlet outside Adrastea's orbit.&lt;ref name=Burns2004/&gt;

The '''Apache HTTP Server''', commonly referred to as '''Apache''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ə|ˈ|p|æ|tʃ|iː}}), is [[web server]] software notable for playing a key role in the initial growth of the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html Netcraft Market Share] for Top Servers Across All Domains August 1995 - November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 it became the first web server software to surpass the 100 million website milestone.&lt;ref name=&quot;100millionsites&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2009/02/18/february_2009_web_server_survey.html |title=February 2009 Web Server Survey |publisher=[[Netcraft]] |accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apache was the first viable alternative to the [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] web server (currently known as [[Oracle iPlanet Web Server]]), and has since evolved to rival other web servers in terms of functionality and performance. Typically Apache is run on a [[Unix-like]] operating system. &lt;ref&gt;https://secure1.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/man.200907/apacheos.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Apache is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the [[Apache Software Foundation]]. The application is available for a wide variety of [[operating system]]s, including Unix, [[GNU]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Novell NetWare]], [[AmigaOS]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS/2]], [[Transaction Processing Facility|TPF]], and [[eComStation]]. Released under the [[Apache License]], Apache is characterized{{By whom|date=May 2011}} as [[open-source software]].

Since April 1996 Apache has been the most popular HTTP server software in use. {{As of|2011|05}} Apache was estimated to serve 63% of all [[website]]s and 66% of the million busiest.&lt;ref name=&quot;netcraft&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2011/05/02/may-2011-web-server-survey.html |title=May 2011 Web Server Survey |publisher=[[Netcraft]] |date=May 17, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
Apache supports a variety of features, many implemented as [[Compiler|compiled]] [[Modular programming|modules]] which extend the core functionality. These can range from server-side programming language support to authentication schemes. Some common language interfaces support &lt;!-- ATTENTION AUTO-EDITORS, THESE UNDERSCORES ARE INTENTIONAL --&gt;[[mod_perl|Perl]], [[mod_python|Python]], [[Tcl]], and [[PHP]]. Popular authentication modules include mod_access, mod_auth, mod_digest, and mod_auth_digest, the successor to mod_digest. A sample of other features include [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] and [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] support ([[mod_ssl]]), a [[proxy server|proxy]] module ([[mod_proxy]]), a URL rewriter (also known as a [[rewrite engine]], implemented under mod_rewrite), custom log files (mod_log_config), and filtering support (mod_include and mod_ext_filter).

Popular compression methods on Apache include the external extension module, mod_gzip&lt;!-- redirects to here --&gt;, implemented to help with reduction of the size (weight) of web pages served over [[HTTP]]. [[ModSecurity]] is an open source intrusion detection and prevention engine for web applications. Apache logs can be analyzed through a web browser using free scripts such as [[AWStats]]/[[W3Perl]] or [[Visitors (program)|Visitors]].

[[Virtual hosting]] allows one Apache installation to serve many different actual websites. For example, one machine with one Apache installation could simultaneously serve www.example.com, www.test.com, test47.test-server.test.com, etc.

Apache features configurable error messages, [[Database management system|DBMS]]-based authentication databases, and [[content negotiation]]. It is also supported by several [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs).

It supports password authentication and digital certificate authentication. Apache has a built in search engine and an HTML authorizing tool and supports FTP.

Although the main design goal of Apache is not to be the &quot;fastest&quot; web server, Apache does have performance comparable to other &quot;high-performance&quot; web servers. Instead of implementing a single architecture, Apache provides a variety of MultiProcessing Modules (MPMs) which allow Apache to run in a process-based, hybrid (process and thread) or event-hybrid mode, to better match the demands of each particular infrastructure. This implies that the choice of correct MPM and the correct configuration is important. Where compromises in performance need to be made, the design of Apache is to reduce latency and increase [[throughput]], relative to simply handling more requests, thus ensuring consistent and reliable processing of requests within reasonable time-frames.

The Apache version considered by the Apache Foundation as providing high-performance is the multi-threaded version which mixes the use of several processes and several threads per process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/worker.html Apache MPM worker]&lt;/ref&gt;

While this architecture works faster than the previous multi-process based topology (because threads have a lower overhead than processes), it does not match the performances of the event-based architecture provided by other servers, especially when they process events with several worker threads.

This difference can be easily explained by the overhead that one thread per connection brings (as opposed to a couple of worker threads per CPU, each processing many connection events). Each thread needs to maintain its own stack, environment, and switching from one thread to another is also an expensive task for CPUs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Arbroath Abbey1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Arbroath Abbey, showing distinctive [[sandstone]] colouring.]]
'''Arbroath Abbey''', in the Scottish town of [[Arbroath]], was founded in 1178 by [[William I of Scotland|King William the Lion]] for a group of [[Tironensian]] [[Benedictine]] monks from [[Kelso Abbey]].  It was [[consecration|consecrated]] in 1197 with a dedication to the deceased [[Thomas Becket|Saint Thomas Becket]], whom the king had met at the [[England|English]] court.  It was William's only personal foundation &amp;mdash; he was buried before the high altar of the church in 1214.

The last Abbot was [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[David Beaton]], who in 1522 succeeded his uncle James to become Archbishop of [[St Andrews]].  The Abbey is cared for by [[Historic Scotland]] and is open to the public throughout the year (entrance charge).  The distinctive red [[sandstone]] ruins stand at the top of the High Street in Arbroath.

==History==
[[Image:Arbroath Abbey Seal 01.jpg|thumb|Abbey [[Seal (device)|seal]], depicting murder of St Thomas.]]
King William gave the Abbey independence from its [[mother church]] and endowed it generously, including income from 24 parishes, land in every royal burgh and more.  The Abbey's monks were allowed to run a market and build a harbour.  King [[John of England]] gave the Abbey permission to buy and sell goods anywhere in [[England]] (except [[London]]) toll-free.

The Abbey, which was the richest in [[Scotland]], is most famous for its association with the 1320 [[Declaration of Arbroath]], believed to have been drafted by Abbot [[Bernard of Kilwinning|Bernard]], who was the Chancellor of Scotland under King [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert I]].

Since 1947, a [[major historical re-enactment]] commemorating the Declaration's signing has been held within the roofless remains of the Abbey church.  The celebration and many other events are now run by the Arbroath Abbey Timethemes a local charity, and tells the story of the events which led up to the signing.  This is not an annual event; the most recent performances have been in August 2000 and 2005 but more are planned. However, a special event to mark the signing is held every year on the 6th of April and involves a street procession and short piece of street theatre. 

The Abbey fell into ruin after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]].  From 1590 onward, its stones were raided for buildings in the town of [[Arbroath]].  This continued until 1815 when steps were taken to preserve the remaining ruins.  

On [[Christmas]] Day 1950, the [[Stone of Scone|Stone of Destiny]] was stolen from [[Westminster Abbey]]. On April 11, 1951, the missing stone was found lying on the site of the Abbey's altar.

In 2005 The Arbroath Abbey campaign was launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rampantscotland.com/let051119.htm] Rampant Scotland Newsletter, 19 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign seeks to gain World Heritage Status for the iconic Angus landmark that was the birthplace of one of Scotland's most significant documents, The Declaration of Arbroath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/buildings/arbabbey.htm] Angus Council Website, Arbroath Abbey article (1998-2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigners believe that the Abbey’s historical pronouncement makes it a prime candidate to achieve World Heritage Status. MSP Alex Johnstone wrote &quot;Clearly, the Declaration of Arbroath is a literary work of outstanding universal significance by any stretch of the imagination&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arbroathworldheritage.blogspot.com/2005/11/world-heritage-site-status-arbroath.html] The Arbroath World Heritage Campaign, Points on Nomination (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Campaign Group Chairman, Councillor Jim Millar launched a public petition to reinforce the bid explaining &quot;We're simply asking people to, local people especially, to sign up to the campaign to have the Declaration of Arbroath and Arbroath Abbey recognised by the United Nations. Essentially we need local people to sign up to this campaign simply because the United Nations demand it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotlandontv.tv/scotland_on_tv/video.html?vxSiteId=60fdd544-9c52-4e17-be7e-57a2a2d76992&amp;vxChannel=Most%20Recent%20Videos&amp;vxClipId=1380_SMG1811&amp;vxBitrate=300 &quot;Interview with Jim Millar, February 2008&quot;], Group Chairman of the Arbroath Abbey Campaign&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural Description==
[[Image:Arbroath Abbey2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Arbroath Abbey, showing The Round 'O'.]]
The Abbey was built over some sixty years using local red sandstone, but gives the impression of a single coherent, mainly '[[Early English Period|Early English]]' architectural design, though the round-arched processional doorway in the western front looks back to late [[Normans|Norman]] or transitional work.  The [[triforium]] (open arcade) above the door is unique in Scottish medieval architecture.  It is flanked by twin towers decorated with blind arcading.  The [[cruciform]] church measured {{convert|276|ft|m}} long by {{convert|160|ft|m}} wide.  What remains of it today are the [[sacristy]], added by Abbot Paniter in the 15th century, the southern [[transept]], which features Scotland's largest [[lancet window]]s, part of the [[choir]] and [[presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]], the southern half of the [[nave]], parts of the western towers and the western doorway.
The church originally had a central tower and (probably) a spire.  These would once have been visible for many miles over the surrounding countryside, and no doubt once acted as a sea-mark for ships.  The soft sandstone of the walls was originally protected by plaster internally and render externally.  These coatings are long gone and much of the architectural detail is sadly eroded, though detached fragments found in the ruins during consolidation give an impression of the original refined, rather austere, architectural effect.

The distinctive round window high in the south transept was originally lit up at night as a [[beacon]] for mariners.  It is known locally as the 'Round O', and from this tradition inhabitants of [[Arbroath]] are colloquially known as 'Reid Lichties' (Scots reid = red).

Little remains of the claustral buildings of the Abbey except for the impressive gatehouse, which stretches between the south-west corner of the church and a defensive tower on the High Street, and the still complete Abbot's House, a building of the 13th, 15th and 16th centuries, which is the best-preserved of its type in [[Scotland]].

In the summer of 2001 a new visitors' centre was opened to the public beside the Abbey's west front.  This red sandstone-clad building, with its distinctive 'wave-shaped' organic roof, planted with sedum, houses displays on the history of the Abbey and some of the best surviving stonework and other relics.  The upper storey features a scale model of the Abbey complex, a computer-generated 'fly-through' reconstruction of the church as it was when complete, and a viewing gallery with excellent views of the ruins.  The centre won the 2002 Angus Design Award.  An archaeological investigation of the site of the visitors' centre before building started revealed the foundations of the medieval precinct wall, with a gateway, and stonework discarded during manufacture, showing that the area was the site of the masons' yard while the Abbey was being built.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Accounting}}
'''Accountancy''' is the process of communicating financial information about a [[business entity]] to users such as [[shareholders]] and [[managers]].&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Barry &amp; Elliot, Jamie: ''Financial accounting and reporting'', [[Prentice Hall]], London 2004, ISBN 0-273-70364-1, p. 3, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=82B1L70-xrsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Financial%20accounting%20and%20reporting&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Books.Google.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[communication]] is generally in the form of [[financial statements]] that show in money terms the [[Factors of production|economic resources]] under the control of management; the art lies in selecting the information that is relevant to the user and is reliable.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Barry &amp; Elliot, Jamie: ''Financial accounting and reporting'', Prentice Hall, London 2004, ISBN 0-273-70364-1, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The [[principle]]s of accountancy are applied to business entities in three divisions of practical art, named accounting, [[bookkeeping]], and [[auditing]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodyear, Lloyd Earnest: ''Principles of Accountancy'', Goodyear-Marshall Publishing Co., [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], 1913, p.7 [http://www.archive.org/download/principlesofacco00goodrich/principlesofacco00goodrich.pdf Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Accountancy''' is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) as &quot;the profession or duties of an accountant&quot;.

'''Accounting''' is defined by the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) as &quot;the art of recording, classifying, and summarizing in a significant manner and in terms of money, transactions and events which are, in part at least, of financial character, and interpreting the results thereof.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Singh Wahla | first = Ramnik | title = AICPA committee on Terminology. Accounting Terminology Bulletin No. 1 Review and Résumé}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounting is thousands of years old; the earliest accounting records, which date back more than 7,000 years, were found in Mesopotamia (Assyrians). The people of that time relied on primitive accounting methods to record the growth of crops and herds. Accounting evolved, improving over the years and advancing as business advanced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedlob, G. Thomas 1996, p.1&quot;&gt;Friedlob, G. Thomas &amp; Plewa, Franklin James, ''Understanding balance sheets'', [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], NYC, 1996, ISBN 0-471-13075-3, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Early accounts served mainly to assist the memory of the [[businessperson]] and the audience for the account was the [[Sole proprietorship|proprietor]] or record keeper alone. Cruder forms of accounting were inadequate for the problems created by a business entity involving multiple [[investors]], so [[double-entry bookkeeping]] first emerged in northern Italy in the 14th century, where trading ventures began to require more [[Financial capital|capital]] than a single individual was able to invest. The development of [[joint stock companies]] created wider audiences for accounts, as investors without firsthand knowledge of their [[Business operations|operations]] relied on accounts to provide the requisite information.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, Bruce G., &amp; Espeland, Wendy Nelson, ''Accounting for Rationality: Double-Entry Bookkeeping and the Rhetoric of Economic Rationality'', [[American Journal of Sociology]], Vol. 97, No. 1, July 1991, pp. 40-41,44 46,&lt;/ref&gt; This development resulted in a split of accounting systems for internal (i.e. [[management accounting]]) and external (i.e. [[financial accounting]]) purposes, and subsequently also in accounting and disclosure regulations and a growing need for independent [[Attestation Standards|attestation]] of external accounts by [[auditors]].&lt;ref&gt;Lauwers, Luc &amp; Willekens, Marleen: &quot;Five Hundred Years of Bookkeeping: A Portrait of Luca Pacioli&quot; (Tijdschrift voor Economie en Management, [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], 1994, vol:XXXIX issue 3, p.302), [https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/119065/1/TEM1994-3_289-304p.pdf KUleuven.be]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, accounting is called &quot;the language of business&quot; because it is the vehicle for reporting financial information about a business entity to many different groups of people. Accounting that concentrates on reporting to people inside the business entity is called [[management accounting]] and is used to provide information to employees, managers, [[Self-employment|owner-managers]] and [[auditors]]. Management accounting is concerned primarily with providing a basis for making management or operating decisions. Accounting that provides information to people outside the business entity is called [[financial accounting]] and provides information to present and potential shareholders, [[creditors]] such as [[bank]]s or vendors, [[financial analysts]], [[economists]], and [[government agencies]]. Because these users have different needs, the presentation of financial accounts is very structured and subject to many more rules than management accounting. The body of rules that governs financial accounting in a given jurisdiction is called [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]], or GAAP.

==Theory==
The basic accounting equation is assets = liabilities + stockholders' equity. This is the balance sheet. The foundation for the balance sheet begins with the income statement, which is revenues - expenses = net income or net loss. This is followed by the retained earnings statement, which is beginning retained earnings + net income - dividends = ending retained earnings or beginning retained earnings - net loss - dividends = ending retained earnings. The current ratio is current assets divided by current liabilities. The debt to total assets ratio is total assets divided by total liabilities.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;[[Accountant]]&quot; is derived from the French word {{lang|fr|''Compter''}}, which took its origin from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|''Computare''}}. The word was formerly written in English as &quot;Accomptant&quot;, but in process of time the word, which was always pronounced by dropping the &quot;p&quot;, became gradually changed both in [[pronunciation]] and in [[orthography]] to its present form&lt;ref&gt;Pixley, Francis William: Accountancy — constructive and recording accountancy (Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, Ltd, London, 1900), p4&lt;/ref&gt; (see also ''[[comptroller]]'').

==History==
===Token accounting in ancient Mesopotamia===
[[File:Map of fertile cresent.svg|thumb|right|200px|Map of the Middle East showing the Fertile Cresent circa. [[3rd millennium BC]]]]
The earliest accounting records were found amongst the ruins of ancient [[Babylon]], [[Assyria]] and [[Sumer]]ia, which date back more than 7,000 years. The people of that time relied on primitive accounting methods to record the growth of crops and herds. Because there is a natural season to farming and herding, it is easy to count and determine if a [[Economic surplus|surplus]] had been gained after the crops had been harvested or the young animals weaned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedlob, G. Thomas 1996, p.1&quot;/&gt;

The invention of a form of [[bookkeeping]] using clay tokens represented a huge [[cognitive]] leap for mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Oldroyd, David &amp; Dobie, Alisdair: ''Themes in the history of bookkeeping'', The Routledge Companion to Accounting History, London, July 2008, ISBN 978-0-415-41094-6, Chapter 5, p.96&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Accounting in India===

Early references to accounting concepts are found in the [[Vedas]]: Vikraya is found in the Atharvaveda and the Nirukta denoting ‘[[sale]]’. Sulka in the Rig veda clearly means ‘[[price]]’. In the Dharma Sutras it denotes a ‘[[tax]]’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svtuition.org/2011/01/accounting-in-vedas.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accounting in the Roman Empire===
[[Image:Res Gestae.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Part of the ''Res Gestae Divi Augusti'' from the ''[[Monumentum Ancyranum]]'' (Temple of Augustus and Rome) at [[Ancyra]], built between 25 BCE - 20 BCE.]]
The ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'' ([[Latin]]: &quot;The Deeds of the Divine Augustus&quot;) is a remarkable account to the Roman people of the Emperor [[Augustus]]' stewardship. It listed and quantified his public expenditure, which encompassed distributions to the people, grants of land or money to army veterans, subsidies to the ''[[aerarium]]'' (treasury), building of temples, religious offerings, and expenditures on theatrical shows and [[gladiatorial]] games. It was not an account of state revenue and expenditure, but was designed to demonstrate Augustus' munificence. The significance of the ''Res Gestae Divi Augusti'' from an accounting perspective lies in the fact that it illustrates that the [[Executive (government)|executive authority]] had access to detailed financial information, covering a period of some forty years, which was still retrievable after the event. The scope of the accounting information at the emperor's disposal suggests that its purpose encompassed planning and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Oldroyd, David: ''The role of accounting in public expenditure and monetary policy in the first century AD Roman Empire'', Accounting Historians Journal, Volume 22, Number 2, [[Birmingham, Alabama]], December 1995, p.124, [http://umiss.lib.olemiss.edu:82/articles/1028395.3253/1.PDF Olemiss.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman historians [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]] record that in [[23 BC]], [[Augustus]]  prepared a ''rationarium'' (account) which listed public revenues, the amounts of cash in the ''aerarium'' (treasury), in the provincial ''fisci'' (tax officials), and in the hands of the ''[[publicani]]'' (public contractors); and that it included the names of the freedmen and slaves from whom a detailed account could be obtained.  The closeness of this information to the executive authority of the emperor is attested by [[Tacitus]]' statement that it was written out by Augustus himself.&lt;ref&gt;Oldroyd, David: ''The role of accounting in public expenditure and monetary policy in the first century AD Roman Empire'', Accounting Historians Journal, Volume 22, Number 2, Birmingham, Alabama, December 1995, p.123, [http://umiss.lib.olemiss.edu:82/articles/1028395.3253/1.PDF Olemiss.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Roman writing tablet 02.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Roman writing tablet from the Vindolanda Roman fort of [[Hadrian's Wall]], in [[Northumberland]] (1st-2nd century AD) requesting money to buy 5,000 measures of cereal used for brewing beer. Department of Prehistory and Europe, [[British Museum]].]]

Records of [[cash]], [[commodities]], and transactions were kept scrupulously by military personnel of the [[Roman army]]. An account of small cash sums received over a few days at the [[fort]] of [[Vindolanda]] circa [[110]] CE shows that the fort could compute [[revenues]] in cash on a daily basis, perhaps from sales of surplus supplies or goods manufactured in the camp, items dispensed to slaves such as ''cervesa'' ([[beer]]) and ''clavi caligares'' ([[Nail (fastener)|nails]] for boots), as well as commodities bought by individual soldiers. The basic needs of the fort were met by a mixture of direct [[manufacturing|production]], [[purchase]] and [[requisition]]; in one letter, a request for money to buy 5,000 ''modii'' (measures) of ''braces'' (a cereal used in brewing) shows that the fort bought provisions for a considerable number of people.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, Alan K., ''Life and letters on the Roman frontier: Vindolanda and its people'' [[Routledge]], London, January 1998, ISBN 978-0-415-92024-7, p. 40-41,45&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Heroninos Archive]] is the name given to a huge collection of [[papyrus]] documents, mostly letters, but also including a fair number of accounts, which come from [[Roman Egypt]] in 3rd century CE. The bulk of the documents relate to the running of a large, private [[Estate (house)|estate]]&lt;ref&gt;Farag, Shawki M., ''The accounting profession in Egypt: Its origin and development'', [[University of Illinois]], 2009, p.7 [http://www.aucegypt.edu/academics/facultyresearch/Profiles/Documents/Science%20paper,%20Shawki%20Farag.pdf Aucegypt.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; is named after Heroninos because he was ''phrontistes'' ([[Koine Greek]]: [[Management|manager]]) of the estate which had a complex and standarised system of accounting which was followed by all its local farm managers.&lt;ref&gt;Rathbone, Dominic: ''Economic Rationalism and Rural Society in Third-Century AD Egypt: The Heroninos Archive and the Appianus Estate'', [[Cambridge University Press]], ISBN 0-521-03763-8, 1991, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Each administrator on each sub-division of the estate drew up his own little accounts, for the day-to-day running of the estate, payment of the workforce, production of crops, the sale of produce, the use of animals, and general expenditure on the staff. This information was then summarized as pieces of papyrus [[scroll]] into one big yearly account for each particular sub—division of the estate. Entries were arranged by sector, with cash expenses and gains extrapolated from all the different sectors. Accounts of this kind gave the owner the opportunity to take better [[economic]] decisions because the information was purposefully selected and arranged.&lt;ref&gt;Cuomo,Serafina: ''Ancient mathematics'', [[Routledge]], London, ISBN 978-0-415-16495-5, July 2001, p.231&lt;/ref&gt;

Simple accounting is mentioned in the [[Christian Bible]] (New Testament) in the [[Book of Matthew]], in the [[Parable of the Talents]].&lt;ref&gt;Matt. 25:19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic accounting and algebra===
In the [[Qur’an]], the word &quot;account&quot; ([[Arabic]]: ''hesab'') is used in its generic sense, relating to one's obligation to account to God on all matters pertaining to human endeavour. According to the Qur’an, followers are required to keep records of their indebtedness ([[Sura 2]], [[ayah]] [http://www.freemedialibrary.com/index.php/Quran_2:282 282]), thus [[Islam]] provides general approval and guidelines for the recording and reporting of transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Mervyn K.: ''Islam and accounting'', [[Wiley-Blackwell]], [[Oxford]], 2001, p. 113, [http://www.acis.pamplin.vt.edu/faculty/tegarden/5034/handouts/Lewis-AcctForum-2001.pdf VT.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Islamic inheritance jurisprudence|Islamic law of inheritance]] ([[Sura 4]], [[ayah]] [http://www.freemedialibrary.com/index.php/Quran_4:11 11]) defines exactly how the estate is calculated after death of an individual. The power of [[testamentary disposition]] is basically limited to one-third of the net estate (i.e. the assets remaining after the payment of funeral expenses and debts), providing for every member of the family by allotting fixed shares not only to wives and children, but also to fathers and mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Mervyn K.: ''Islam and accounting'', Wiley-Blackwell, [[Oxford]], 2001, p. 109 ,[http://www.acis.pamplin.vt.edu/faculty/tegarden/5034/handouts/Lewis-AcctForum-2001.pdf VT.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of this law served as an impetus behind the development of [[algebra]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''al-jabr'') by the [[Persian People|Persian]] mathematician [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]] and other medieval Islamic mathematicians. Khwārizmī's &quot;[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing]]&quot; (Arabic: ''Hisab al-jabr w’al-muqabala'', [[Baghdad]], c. [[825]]) devoted a chapter on the solution to the Islamic law of inheritance using [[linear equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Algebra of Inheritance: A Rehabilitation of Al-Khuwarizmi|first=Solomon|last=Gandz|journal=[[Osiris (journal)|Osiris]]|volume=5|year=1938|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|pages=319–91|doi=10.1086/368492|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century, [[Latin]] translations of al-Khwārizmī's &quot;Book of Addition and Subtraction According to the Hindu Calculation&quot; (Arabic:''Kitāb al-Jamʿ wa-l-tafrīq bi-ḥisāb al-Hind'') on the use of [[Indian numerals]], introduced the [[decimal]] [[Positional notation|positional number system]] to the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;Struik, Dirk Jan (1987), A Concise History of Mathematics (4th ed.), [[Dover Publications]], ISBN 0-486-60255-9&lt;/ref&gt;
Zakah is charged on earnings,agricultural produce, animals, mercantile goods etc. Islam has fixed Nisab (minimum amount) that is chargeable to Zakah, rates at which Zakah is to be charged as well as periodicity. In case of animals Nisab is fixed in terms of their number. However in respect of merchandise it has fixed Nisab in terms of their monetary value. Hifzur Rab has discussed its implications and the guiding principles that emanate from it. According to him 'Command to measure correctly implies that any error in measurement/accounting must be corrected. Accordingly, we must correct all our accounts that use currency as the unit for the error resulting from manipulation of the currency. The best approach to this problem lies in applying the advancement in our knowledge derived from observations with wisdom based on the sure knowledge derived from the Quran-e-Hakim and Sunnah Mubarakah. One of major guiding principles it provides is that the value of anything is best measured in terms of a given quantity of itself. For example: gold in terms of gold and rice in terms of rice. Thus, growth in wheat production should be measured in terms of quantity produced and not its value. The second guiding principle based on these infallible sources of knowledge is to use the most reliable unit in cases that require use of a common unit of value. A third guiding principle pertinent to our case is to let free open markets determine the prices.' Thus, where the unit of account is manipulated Islamic Accounting mandates that all data and accounting be corrected to free it from the error resulting from the manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;Hifzur Rab (2009), Interest and Monetary Manipulation Is the Root Cause of Most of the Contemporary Economic and Social Problems, published in proceedings International Seminar on Muamalat, Islamic economics and Finance 2009’ by Department of Syriah UKM Bangi Selangar Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt;  The development of [[mathematics]] and accounting was intertwined during the [[Renaissance]]. Mathematics was in the midst of a period of significant development in the late 15th century. [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system|Hindu-Arabic numerals]] and [[algebra]] were introduced to Europe from Arab mathematics at the end of the 10th century by the Benedictine monk [[Gerbert of Aurillac]], but it was only after [[Leonardo Pisano]] (also known as Fibonacci) put commercial [[arithmetic]], Hindu-Arabic numerals, and the rules of algebra together in his [[Liber Abaci]] in 1202 that Hindu-Arabic numerals became widely used in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sangster, Greg Stoner &amp; Patricia McCarthy: &quot;The market for Luca Pacioli's Summa Arithmetica&quot; (Accounting, Business &amp; Financial History Conference, Cardiff, September 2007) p. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luca Pacioli and double-entry bookkeeping ===
{{Main|Luca Pacioli|Double-entry bookkeeping system}}
[[Bartering]] was the dominant practice for traveling merchants during the [[Middle Ages]]. When medieval Europe moved to a [[monetary economy]] in the 13th century, [[Sedentism|sedentary]] merchants depended on bookkeeping to oversee multiple simultaneous transactions financed by [[bank loan]]s. One important breakthrough took place around that time: the introduction of double-entry bookkeeping,&lt;ref name=&quot;logica.ugent.be&quot;&gt;Heeffer, Albrecht: ''On the curious historical coincidence of algebra and double-entry bookkeeping'', Foundations of the Formal Sciences, [[Ghent University]], November 2009, p.11 [http://logica.ugent.be/albrecht/thesis/FOTFS2008-Heeffer.pdf Ugent.be]&lt;/ref&gt; which is defined as any bookkeeping system in which there was a [[debit and credit]] entry for each transaction, or for which the majority of transactions were intended to be of this form.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Geofrey T. &quot;Early accounting in Northern Italy: The role of commercial development and the printing press in the expansion of double-entry from Genoa, Florence and Venice&quot; (The Accounting Historians Journal, June 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The historical origin of the use of the words ‘debit’ and ‘credit’ in accounting goes back to the days of single-entry bookkeeping in which the chief objective was to keep track of amounts owed by customers ([[debtor]]s) and amounts owed to [[creditor]]s. ‘Debit,’ is [[Latin]] for ‘he owes’ and ‘credit’ Latin for ‘he trusts’.&lt;ref&gt;Thiéry, Michel: ''Did you say Debit?'', [[Assumption University (Thailand)]], AU-GSB e-Journal,  Vol. 2 No. 1, June 2009, p.35, [http://gsbejournal.au.edu/2V/Journal/DID%20YOU%20SAY%20DEBIT.pdf AU.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest extant evidence of full double-entry bookkeeping is the  Farolfi ledger of 1299-1300.&lt;ref name=&quot;logica.ugent.be&quot;/&gt; Giovanno Farolfi &amp; Company were a firm of [[Florentine]] merchants whose head office was in [[Nîmes]] who also acted as [[moneylender]]s to the [[Archbishop of Arles]], their most important customer.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Geoffrey A., ''The Coming of Age of Double Entry: The Giovanni Farolfi Ledger of 1299-1300'', Accounting Historians Journal, Vol. 4, No. 2, 1977 p.80 [http://130.74.92.202:82/record=b1000778 University of Mississippi]&lt;/ref&gt;  The oldest discovered record of a complete double-entry system is the ''Messari'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: [[Treasurer]]'s) accounts of the city of [[Genoa]] in 1340. The ''Messari'' accounts contain debits and credits journalised in a [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] form, and contains balances carried forward from the preceding year, and therefore enjoy general recognition as a double-entry system.&lt;ref&gt;Lauwers, Luc &amp; Willekens, Marleen: &quot;Five Hundred Years of Bookkeeping: A Portrait of Luca Pacioli&quot; (Tijdschrift voor Economie en Management, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, 1994, vol:XXXIX issue 3, p.300),  [https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/119065/1/TEM1994-3_289-304p.pdf KUleuven.be]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pacioli.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Luca Pacioli|Pacioli's]] portrait, a painting by [[Jacopo de' Barbari]], 1495, ([[Museo di Capodimonte]]).The open book to which he is pointing may be his ''Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalità''.&lt;ref&gt;Lauwers, Luc &amp; Willekens, Marleen: &quot;Five Hundred Years of Bookkeeping: A Portrait of Luca Pacioli&quot; (Tijdschrift voor Economie en Management, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, 1994, vol:XXXIX issue:3 pages:289–304), [https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/119065/1/TEM1994-3_289-304p.pdf KUleuven.be]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Luca Pacioli]]'s ''&quot;Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalità&quot;'' (Italian: &quot;Review of [[Arithmetic]], [[Geometry]], [[Ratio]] and Proportion&quot;) was first printed and published in [[Venice]] in 1494. It included a 27-page [[treatise]] on [[bookkeeping]], ''&quot;Particularis de Computis et Scripturis&quot;'' (Italian: &quot;Details of Calculation and Recording&quot;). It was written primarily for, and sold mainly to, merchants who used the book as a reference text, as a source of pleasure from the [[mathematical puzzles]] it contained, and to aid the education of their sons. It represents the first known printed treatise on bookkeeping; and it is widely believed to be the forerunner of modern bookkeeping practice. In ''Summa Arithmetica'', Pacioli introduced symbols for [[plus and minus]] for the first time in a printed book, symbols that became standard notation in Italian Renaissance mathematics. ''Summa Arithmetica'' was also the first known book printed in Italy to contain [[algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sangster, Greg Stoner &amp; Patricia McCarthy: &quot;The market for Luca Pacioli's Summa Arithmetica&quot; (Accounting, Business &amp; Financial History Conference, Cardiff, September 2007) p.1–2, [http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/carbs/conferences/abfh07/summa.pdf Cardiff.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Luca Pacioli did not invent double-entry bookkeeping,&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, Bruce G., &amp; Espeland, Wendy Nelson, ''Accounting for Rationality: Double-Entry Bookkeeping and the Rhetoric of Economic Rationality'', American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 97, No. 1, July 1991, pp. 37&lt;/ref&gt; his 27-page [[treatise]] on bookkeeping contained the first known published work on that topic, and is said to have laid the foundation for double-entry bookkeeping as it is practiced today.&lt;ref&gt;vSangster, Alan: &quot;The printing of Pacioli's Summa in 1494: how many copies were printed?&quot; (Accounting Historians Journal, John Carroll University, Cleveland, Ohio, June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Pacioli's treatise exhibits almost no [[originality]], it is generally considered as an important work, mainly because of its wide circulation, it was written in the [[vernacular]] [[Italian language]], and it was a printed book.&lt;ref&gt;Lauwers, Luc &amp; Willekens, Marleen: &quot;Five Hundred Years of Bookkeeping: A Portrait of Luca Pacioli&quot; (Tijdschrift voor Economie en Management, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, 1994, vol:XXXIX issue 3, p.292), [https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/119065/1/TEM1994-3_289-304p.pdf KUleuven.be]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pacioli, accounting is an ad hoc ordering system devised by the merchant. Its regular use provides the merchant with continued information about his business, and allows him to evaluate how things are going and to act accordingly. Pacioli recommends the Venetian method of double-entry bookkeeping above all others. Three major books of account are at the direct basis of this system: the ''memoriale'' (Italian: [[memorandum]]), the ''giornale'' ([[diary|journal]]), and the ''quaderno'' ([[ledger]]). The ledger is considered as the central one and is accompanied by an alphabetical [[Index (publishing)|index]].&lt;ref&gt;Lauwers, Luc &amp; Willekens, Marleen: &quot;Five Hundred Years of Bookkeeping: A Portrait of Luca Pacioli&quot; (Tijdschrift voor Economie en Management, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, 1994, vol:XXXIX issue 3, p.296), [https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/119065/1/TEM1994-3_289-304p.pdf KUleuven.be]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacioli's treatise gave instructions in how to record barter transactions and transactions in a variety of currencies – both being far more commonplace than they are today. It also enabled merchants to audit their own books and to ensure that the entries in the accounting records made by their bookkeepers complied with the method he described. Without such a system, all merchants who did not maintain their own records were at greater risk of theft by their employees and agents: it is not by accident that the first and last items described in his treatise concern maintenance of an accurate [[inventory]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sangster, ''Using accounting history and Luca Pacioli to teach double entry'', [[Middlesex University]] Business School, September 2009, p.9, [http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/carbs/conferences/abfh2008/sangster2.pdf Cardiff.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of double-entry can be grasped by recognizing that this system of bookkeeping did not simply record the things merchants traded so that they could keep track of assets or calculate profits and losses; instead as a system of writing, double-entry produced effects that exceeded transcription and calculation. One of its social effects was to proclaim the honesty of [[merchants]] as a group; one of its [[Epistemology|epistemological]] effects was to make its formal [[Arithmetic precision|precision]] based on a [[Rule-based system|rule bound system]] of [[arithmetic]] seem to guarantee the [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] of the details it recorded.  Even though the information recorded in the books of account was not necessarily accurate, the combination of the double entry system's precision and the [[Normalization (sociology)|normalizing]] effect that precision tended to create, produced the impression that books of account were not only precise, but accurate as well. Instead of gaining prestige from numbers, double entry bookkeeping helped confer cultural authority on numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Poovey, Mary &quot;A history of the modern fact&quot; (University of Chicago Press, 1998) Ch.2 p.30, 58 &amp; 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Double entry accounting means that money is never lost or gained.  It is always transferred from one place to another.  This is done by recording transactions.  Each transaction requires the use of at least two accounts.

===Accounting in the internet era===
In the [[IETF]] [[Request for Comments|RFCs]] the act of accounting is usually defined as ''the act of collecting information on resource usage for the purpose of trend analysis, auditing, billing, or cost allocation''.

For example when a user uses a connectivity service paid with a [[pay-per-use]] approach the accounting process is based on a [[metering]] of the resource usage by the user (usually time spent with an active connection or the amount of data tranferred using that connection).
The accounting is hence the recording of this connectivity service ''consumption'' for subsequent charging of the service itself.

==Accounting scandals==
{{Main|Accounting scandals}}
The year 2001 witnessed a series of financial information frauds involving [[Enron Corporation]], auditing firm [[Arthur Andersen]], the telecommunications company [[WorldCom]], [[Qwest]] and [[Jarden|Sunbeam]], among other well-known corporations. These problems highlighted the need to review the effectiveness of [[Standard accounting practice|accounting standards]], auditing regulations and [[corporate governance]] principles. In some cases, management manipulated the figures shown in financial reports to indicate a better economic performance. In others, tax and regulatory incentives encouraged over-leveraging of companies and decisions to bear extraordinary and unjustified risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;mba.ufm.edu.gt&quot;&gt;Astrid Ayala and Giancarlo Ibárgüen Snr.: &quot;A Market Proposal for Auditing the Financial Statements of Public Companies&quot; (Journal of Management of Value, [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]], March 2006) p. 41, [http://www.mba.ufm.edu.gt/journalofmanagement/content/ENG_MarketProposal.pdf UFM.edu.gt]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Enron scandal]] deeply influenced the development of new regulations to improve the reliability of financial reporting, and increased public awareness about the importance of having accounting standards that show the financial reality of companies and the objectivity and independence of auditing firms.&lt;ref name=&quot;mba.ufm.edu.gt&quot;/&gt;

In addition to being the largest bankruptcy reorganization in American history, the [[Enron scandal]] undoubtedly is the biggest audit failure.&lt;ref&gt;Bratton, William W. &quot;Enron and the Dark Side of Shareholder Value&quot; ([[Tulane Law Review]], New Orleans, May 2002) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal caused the dissolution of [[Arthur Andersen]], which at the time was one of the five largest accounting firms in the world. It involved a financial scandal of [[Enron|Enron Corporation]] and their auditors [[Arthur Andersen]], which was revealed in late 2001. After a series of revelations involving irregular accounting procedures conducted throughout the 1990s, Enron filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection in December 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Enron files for bankruptcy | publisher = BBC News | date = 2001-12-03 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1688550.stm | accessdate = 2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence of these events was the passage of [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] in 2002, as a result of the first admissions of fraudulent behavior made by Enron. The act significantly raises criminal penalties for [[securities fraud]], for destroying, altering or fabricating records in federal investigations or any scheme or attempt to defraud shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Aiyesha Dey, and Thomas Z. Lys: &quot;Trends in Earnings Management and Informativeness of Earnings Announcements in the Pre- and Post-Sarbanes Oxley Periods ([[Kellogg School of Management]], Evanston, Illinois, February, 2005) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ants''' are [[Eusociality|social]] [[insect]]s of the family '''Formicidae''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|f|ɔr|ˈ|m|ɪ|s|ɨ|d|iː}}) and, along with the related [[wasp]]s and [[bee]]s, belong to the order [[Hymenoptera]]. Ants [[evolution|evolved]] from wasp-like ancestors in the mid-[[Cretaceous]] period between 110 and 130&amp;nbsp;million years ago and [[Evolutionary radiation|diversified]] after the rise of [[flowering plant]]s. More than 12,500 out of an estimated total of 22,000 [[List of ant genera (alphabetical)|species]] have been classified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Ants form [[Ant colony|colonies]] that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies which may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals. These larger colonies consist mostly of sterile wingless females forming castes of &quot;workers&quot;, &quot;soldiers&quot;, or other specialised groups. Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called &quot;drones&quot; and one or more fertile females called &quot;[[Queen ant|queens]]&quot;. The colonies are sometimes described as [[superorganism]]s because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity, collectively working together to support the colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Oster GF, Wilson EO|year=1978|title=Caste and ecology in the social insects|publisher=Princeton University Press, Princeton|pages=21–22|isbn=0-691-02361-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ants have colonised almost every landmass on [[Earth]]. The only places lacking indigenous ants are [[Antarctica]] and a few remote or inhospitable islands. Ants thrive in most ecosystems, and may form 15&amp;ndash;25% of the [[terrestrial animal]] [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].&lt;ref name=&quot;schultz&quot;/&gt; Their success in so many environments has been attributed to their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves. Their long [[co-evolution]] with other species has led to [[mimicry|mimetic]], [[commensalism|commensal]], [[parasitism|parasitic]], and [[mutualistic]] relationships.&lt;ref name=TheAntsRelations&gt;Hölldobler &amp; Wilson (1990), p. 471&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ant societies have [[division of labour]], communication between individuals, and an ability to [[Problem solving|solve complex problems]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SANdisk&quot;/&gt; These parallels with [[Civilization|human societies]] have long been an inspiration and subject of study. 

Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication and rituals. Some species are valued in their role as [[biological pest control]] agents.&lt;ref name=&quot;HolldoblerWilsonAnts3&quot;/&gt; However, their ability to exploit resources brings ants into conflict with humans, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the [[red imported fire ant]], are regarded as [[invasive species]], establishing themselves in areas where they are accidentally introduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;pests&quot;/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''ant'' is derived from ''{{lang|enm|ante}}'' of [[Middle English]] which is derived from ''{{lang|ang|æmette}}'' of [[Old English]] and is related to the [[Old High German]] ''{{lang|goh|āmeiza}}'', hence the modern [[German language|German]] ''{{lang|de|Ameise}}''. All of these words come from West Germanic ''*{{lang|gmw|amaitjo}}'', and the original meaning of the word was &quot;the biter&quot; (from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*{{lang|gem|ai-}}'', &quot;off, away&quot; + ''*{{lang|gem|mait-}}'' &quot;cut&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
