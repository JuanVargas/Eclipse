egemony until World War I (encompassing Austria–Hungary and Germany in their pre-war formations but usually excluding the [[Baltic countries]] north of [[East Prussia]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} According to [[Fritz Fischer]] ''Mitteleuropa'' was a scheme in the era of the [[German Empire|Reich of 1871-1918]] by which the old imperial elites had allegedly sought to build a system of German economic, military and political domination from the northern seas to the Near East and from the Low Countries through the steppes of Russia to the Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Fritz Epstein argued the threat of a Slavic &quot;Drang nach Westen&quot; (Western expansion) had been a major factor in the emergence of a ''Mitteleuropa'' ideology before the Reich of 1871 ever came into being.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany the connotation is also sometimes linked to the pre-war German provinces east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] which were lost as the result of World War II, annexed by [[People's Republic of Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and ethnically cleansed of [[German people|Germans]] by communist authorities and forces (''see [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]]'') due to [[Yalta Conference]] and [[Potsdam Conference]] decisions. In this view [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]], with its dual [[West Slavs|Western Slavic]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] heritage, combined with the historic element of the &quot;[[Sudetenland]]&quot;, is a core region illustrating the problems and features of the entire Central European region.&lt;br /&gt;
The term Mitteleuropa conjures up negative historical associations, although the Germans have not played an exclusively negative role in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson, p. 6&quot;/&gt; Most Central European Jews embraced the enlightened German humanistic culture of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson, p. 7&quot;&gt;Johnson, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; German-speaking Jews from [[turn-of-the-century]] [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]] and [[Prague]] became representatives of what many consider to be Central European culture at its best, though the Nazi version of &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; destroyed this kind of culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson, p. 7&quot;/&gt; Some German speakers are sensitive enough to the pejorative connotations of the term ''Mitteleuropa'' to use ''Zentraleuropa'' instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson, p. 165&quot;/&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]] was obsessed by the idea of [[Lebensraum]] and many non-German Central Europeans identify ''Mitteleuropa'' with the instruments he employed to acquire it: war, deportations, genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical geography==
=== Between the Alps and the Baltics ===
Geography strongly defines Central Europe's borders with its neighbouring regions to the North and South, namely [[Northern Europe]] (or [[Scandinavia]]) across the [[Baltic Sea]], the [[Apennine peninsula]] (or [[Italy]]) across the [[Alps]] and the [[Balkan peninsula]] across the Soča-Krka-Sava-Danube line. The borders to [[Western Europe]] and [[Eastern Europe]] are geographically less defined and for this reason the [[cultural]] and historical boundaries migrate more easily West-East than South-North. The [[Rhine]] river which runs South-North through Western [[Germany]] is an exception.

===Pannonian Plain and Carpathian Mountains===
[[Image:Carpathian Basin-Pannonian Basin.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Pannonian Plain]], between the [[Alps]] (west), the [[Carpathians]] (north and east), and the [[Sava]]/[[Danube]] (south)]]

Geographically speaking, the [[Carpathian mountains]] divide the [[European Plain]] into two sections: the Central Europe's [[Pannonian Plain]] in the west,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.christinefeehan.com/dark_series/research.php |title=Dark Series Research by Christine Feehan |publisher=Christinefeehan.com |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[East European Plain]], which lie eastward of the Carpathians. Southwards, the [[Pannonian Plain]] is bounded by the rivers [[Sava]] and [[Danube]]- and their respective floodplains.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icpdr.org/icpdr-files/14017&lt;/ref&gt; This area mostly corresponds to the borders of the former [[Austria-Hungary]]. The [[Pannonian Plain]] extends into the following countries: [[Austria]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Ukraine]].

===Dinaric Alps===
As southeastern division of the [[Eastern Alps]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Encyclop&amp;aelig;dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/163795/Dinaric-Alps |title=Dinaric Alps (mountains, Europe) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Dinaric Alps]] extend for 650 kilometres along the coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] (northwest-southeast), from the [[Julian Alps]] in the northwest down to the Šar-Korab massif, where the mountain direction changes to north-south. According to the Freie Universitaet Berlin&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Juliane Dittrich |url=http://www.grin.com/e-book/37159/die-alpen-hoehenstufen-und-vegetation |title=Die Alpen - Höhenstufen und Vegetation - Hauptseminararbeit |publisher=GRIN |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; this [[Dinaric Alps|mountain chain]] is classified as [[Alps|South Central European]].

The '''geography of Canada''' is vast and diverse. Occupying most of the northern portion of [[North America]] (41% of the [[continent]]), [[Canada]] is the [[list of countries by area|world's second largest country]] in total area.

Canada spans an immense territory between the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east and the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the north (hence the [[List of national mottos|country's motto]] &quot;From sea to sea&quot;), with the [[United States]] to the south ([[contiguous United States]]) and northwest ([[Alaska]]), and the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the north; [[Greenland]] is to the northeast. Off the southern coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] lies [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]], an [[Overseas collectivities of France|overseas collectivity]] of [[France]]. Since 1925, Canada has claimed the portion of the [[Arctic]] between 60°W and 141°W [[longitude]] to the [[North Pole]]; however, this claim is contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://atlas.gc.ca/site/english/maps/historical/territorialevolution/1927/1 | author= Atlas of Canada | title= Canada teritorrial evolution | year= 2004 | month= April| accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Covering {{convert|9984670|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=or}} (Land:&amp;nbsp;{{convert|9093507|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}; Water:&amp;nbsp;{{convert|891163|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}, Canada is slightly less than three-fifths as large as Russia, nearly 1.2 times larger than [[Australia]], slightly larger than [[Europe]], and more than 40 times larger than the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. In total [[area]], Canada is slightly larger than both the U.S. and [[People's Republic of China|China]]; however, Canada ranks fourth in [[List of countries and outlying territories by land area|land area]] (i.e., total area minus the area of lakes and rivers)—China is {{convert|9326410|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=s}} and the U.S. is {{convert|9161923|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=s}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/factbook/countrycompare/area/3d.html;_ylt=As1XMsN8kgSx746VWazy_s7PecYF| title = World Factbook: Area Country Comparison Table| publisher = Yahoo Education| accessdate = 2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northernmost settlement in Canada (and in the world) is [[CFS Alert|Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Alert]] (just north of [[Alert, Nunavut]]) on the northern tip of [[Ellesmere Island]]—[[latitude]] 82.5°N—just {{convert|834|km|mi|abbr=off|lk=off}} from the North Pole.

The [[North Magnetic Pole|magnetic North Pole]] lies within the Canadian Arctic territorial claim; however, recent measurements indicate it is moving towards [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/geomag/nmp/long_mvt_nmp_e.php | author= Geological Survey of Canada | title= Longterm movement of the magnetic north pole | publisher= Government of Canada | accessdate= 2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical geography==
[[Image:Canada-satellite.jpg|thumb|280px|left|A satellite composite image of Canada. Boreal forests prevail throughout the country, including the Arctic, the Coast Mountains and Saint Elias Mountains. The relatively flat Prairies facilitate agriculture. The Great Lakes feed the St. Lawrence River (in the southeast) where lowlands host much of Canada's population.]]

Canada covers 9,984,670&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (3,855,103&amp;nbsp;sq.&amp;nbsp;mi) and a panoply of various geoclimatic regions. Canada also encompasses vast maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of {{convert|202080|km|mi|abbr=off|lk=off}}. The [[physical geography]] of Canada is widely varied. [[Taiga|Boreal forests]] prevail throughout the country, ice is prominent in northerly Arctic regions and through the [[Rocky Mountains]], and the relatively flat [[Canadian Prairies]] in the southwest facilitate productive agriculture. The [[Great Lakes]] feed the [[St. Lawrence River]] (in the southeast) where lowlands host much of Canada's population.

===Appalachian Mountains===
The [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian mountain range]] extends from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the [[southern United States]] through the [[Gaspé Peninsula]] and the [[Atlantic Provinces]], creating rolling hills indented by river valleys. It also runs through parts of southern [[Quebec]].

The Appalachian mountains (more specifically the [[Notre Dame Mountains|Notre Dame]] and [[Long Range Mountains]]) are an old and eroded range of mountains, approximately 380 million years in age. Notable mountains in the Appalachians include [[Mount Jacques-Cartier]] (Quebec, {{convert|1268|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=/}} and [[Mount Carleton]] (New Brunswick, {{convert|817|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=/}}). Parts of the Appalachians are home to a rich [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] flora and fauna and are considered to have been [[nunatak]]s during the last [[glaciation]] era.

===Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Lowlands===
[[Image:Niagara Falls and Maid of the Mist 2005.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Horseshoe Falls (Canada)|Horseshoe Falls]] in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], one of the world's most voluminous waterfalls,&lt;ref name=&quot;AtlasSignificantFacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Natural Resources Canada |authorlink=Natural Resources Canada |publisher= Natural Resources Canada |url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/facts/supergeneral.html |title=Significant Canadian Facts |date=2dsfsfdsafsafdsafsdafs004-04-05|accessdate=2006-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a major source of hydroelectric power, and a tourist destination.]]
[[Image:Great Lakes from space.jpg|thumb|left|The Great Lakes from space]]

The southern parts of Quebec and Ontario, in the section of the [[Great Lakes]] (bordered entirely by [[Ontario]] on the Canadian side) and [[St. Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]] basin (often called [[St. Lawrence Lowlands]]), is another particularly rich sedimentary plain. Prior to its [[colonization]] and heavy [[urban sprawl]] of the 20th century, this [[Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests]] area was home to large [[mixed forest]]s covering a mostly flat area of land between the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and the [[Canadian Shield]]. Most of this forest has been cut down through agriculture and logging operations, but the remaining forests are for the most part heavily protected. (see [[Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests]]). In this part of Canada the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] is the world's largest [[estuary]] (see [[Gulf of St. Lawrence lowland forests]]).

While the relief of these lowlands is particularly flat and regular, a group of [[batholite]]s known as the [[Monteregian Hills]] are spread along a mostly regular line across the area. The most notable are [[Montreal]]'s [[Mount Royal]] and [[Mont Saint-Hilaire]]. These hills are known for a great richness in precious [[mineral]]s.

===Canadian Shield===
The northern parts of [[Saskatchewan]], [[Manitoba]], Ontario, and Quebec, as well as most of [[Labrador]], the [[mainland]] portions of the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], are located on a vast rock base known as the [[Canadian Shield]]. The Shield mostly consists of eroded hilly terrain and contains many lakes and important [[river]]s used for [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] production, particularly in northern Quebec and Ontario. The shield also encloses an area of [[wetlands]], the [[Hudson Bay]] lowlands. Some particular regions of the Shield are referred to as [[mountain range]]s, including the [[Torngat Mountains|Torngat]] and [[Laurentian Mountains]].

The Shield cannot support intensive [[agriculture]], although there is subsistence agriculture and small dairy farms in many of the river valleys and around the abundant lakes, particularly in the southern regions. [[Boreal forest]] covers much of the shield, with a mix of [[conifers]] that provide valuable timber resources in areas such as the [[Central Canadian Shield forests]] [[ecoregion]] that covers much of [[Northern Ontario]]. The region is known for its extensive mineral reserves.
The Canadian Shield is know for its vast minerals, such as emeralds, diamonds and copper. The Canadian shield is also called the mineral house.

===Canadian Interior Plains===
The [[Canadian Prairies]] are part of a vast [[sedimentary]] [[Great Plains|plain]] covering much of [[Alberta]], southern Saskatchewan, and southwestern Manitoba, as well as much of the region between the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Great Slave Lake|Great Slave]] and [[Great Bear Lake|Great Bear]] lakes in [[Northwest Territories]]. The plains generally describes the expanses of (largely flat) arable agricultural land which sustain extensive grain farming operations in the southern part of the provinces. Despite this, some areas such as the [[Cypress Hills (Canada)|Cypress Hills]] and [[Alberta Badlands]] are quite hilly and the prairie states ([[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]]) contain large areas of forest such as the [[Mid-Continental Canadian forests]]

===Western Cordillera===
The [[Canadian Cordillera]], attached to the [[American cordillera]], stretches from the Rocky Mountains in the east to the [[Pacific Ocean]].

The [[Canadian Rockies]] are part of a major [[continental divide]] that extends north and south through western North America and western [[South America]]. The [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and the [[Fraser River]]s have their headwaters in the Canadian Rockies and are the second and third largest rivers respectively to drain to the west coast of North America.
[[Image:Vancouverpalms.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Vancouver]] has a mild enough climate to support several species of palm trees.]]
Immediately west of the mountains is a large interior plateau encompassing the [[Chilcotin District|Chilcotin]] and [[Cariboo]] regions in central [[British Columbia]] (the [[Fraser Plateau and Basin complex|Fraser Plateau]]) and the [[Nechako Plateau]] further north. The [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] Valley in northeastern British Columbia is Canada's most northerly agricultural region, although it is part of the prairies. The dry, temperate climate of the [[Okanagan]] Valley in south central British Columbia provides ideal conditions for fruit growing and a flourishing wine industry. Between the plateau and the coast is a second mountain range, the [[Coast Mountains]]. The Coast Mountains contain some of the largest temperate-latitude [[icefield]]s in the world.

On the south coast of British Columbia, [[Vancouver Island]] is separated from the mainland by the continuous [[Strait of Juan de Fuca|Juan de Fuca]], [[Strait of Georgia|Georgia]], and [[Johnstone Strait|Johnstone]] [[strait]]s. Those straits include a large number of islands, notably the [[Gulf Islands]]. North, near the [[Alaska]]n border, the [[Queen Charlotte Islands]] lie across [[Hecate Strait]] from the [[Bella Coola, British Columbia|Bella Coola]] region. Other than in the plateau regions of the interior and the river valleys, most of British Columbia is coniferous forest. The only [[temperate rain forests]] in Canada are found along the Pacific coast in the Coast Mountains, on Vancouver Island, and on the Queen Charlotte Islands.

===Volcanoes===
{{Main|Volcanism in Canada}}

[[Image:Mount Garibaldi.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Mount Garibaldi]] as seen from [[Squamish, British Columbia|Squamish]] ]]
[[Western Canada]] has many [[volcano]]es and is part of the system of volcanoes found around the margins of the [[Pacific Ocean]], which is called the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. There are over 200 young volcanic centres that stretch northward from the [[Cascade Range]] to the [[Yukon Territory]]. They are grouped into five [[volcanic belt]]s with different volcano types and [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] settings. The [[Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province]] was formed by [[Fault (geology)|faulting]], cracking, [[rift]]ing, and the interaction between the [[Pacific Plate]] and the [[North American plate]]. The [[Garibaldi Volcanic Belt]] was formed by [[subduction]] of the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] beneath the North American Plate. The [[Anahim Volcanic Belt]] was formed as a result of the North American Plate sliding westward over the [[Anahim hotspot]]. The [[Chilcotin Group]] is believed to have formed as a result of [[back-arc basin|back-arc extension]] behind the [[Cascadia subduction zone]]. The [[Wrangell Volcanic Field]] formed as a result of [[subduction]] of the [[Pacific Plate]] beneath the North American Plate at the easternmost end of the [[Aleutian Trench]].

Volcanism has also occurred in the [[Canadian Shield]]. It contains over 150 [[volcanic belt]]s (now deformed and eroded down to nearly flat [[plain]]s) that range from 600 million to 2.8 billion years old. Many of Canada's major [[ore]] deposits are associated with [[Precambrian]] volcanoes. There are [[pillow lava]]s in the [[Northwest Territories]] that are about 2.6 billion years old and are preserved in the [[Cameron River Volcanic Belt]]. The pillow lavas in rocks over 2 billion years old in the Canadian Shield signify that great oceanic volcanoes existed during the early stages of the formation of the Earth's crust. Ancient volcanoes play an important role in estimating Canada's [[mineral]] potential. Many of the volcanic belts bear ore deposits that are related to the volcanism.

===Canadian Arctic===
{{Main|Northern Canada}}
While the largest part of the Canadian Arctic is composed of seemingly endless permanent ice and [[tundra]] north of the [[tree line]], it encompasses geological regions of varying types: the [[Arctic Cordillera]] (with the [[British Empire Range]] and the [[United States Range]] on [[Ellesmere Island]]) contains the northernmost mountain system in the world. The [[Arctic Lowlands]] and Hudson Bay lowlands comprise a substantial part of the geographic region often designated as the Canadian Shield (in contrast to the sole geologic area). The ground in the Arctic is mostly composed of [[permafrost]], making construction difficult and often hazardous, and agriculture virtually impossible.

The Arctic, when defined as everything north of the tree line, covers most of [[Nunavut]] and the northernmost parts of Northwest Territories, Yukon, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and Labrador.

Canada holds vast reserves of water: its rivers discharge nearly 9% of the world's renewable water supply,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/freshwater/distribution/1 | author= Atlas of Canada | title= Distribution of Freshwater | year= 2004 | month= February | accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; it contains a quarter of the world's wetlands, and it has the third largest amount of [[glacier]]s (after [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]]). Because of extensive [[glaciation]], Canada hosts more than two million [[lake]]s: of those that are entirely within Canada, more than 31,000 are between {{convert|3|and|100|km2|sqmi|1}} in area, while 563 are larger than {{convert|100|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/facts/lakes.html | author= Atlas of Canada | title= Facts about Canada - Lakes | year= 2004 | month= April| accessdate= 2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivers===
{{See also|List of rivers in Canada}}

Canada’s two greatest rivers are the '''St. Lawrence''', which drains the Great Lakes and empties into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the '''Mackenzie''', which empties into the Arctic Ocean and drains a large part of northwestern Canada. While the St. Lawrence is the largest river in Canada in volume of water discharged at its mouth, the Mackenzie is the longest. Through its tributary, the Peace River, and tracing to its source in the Finlay River of British Columbia, the Mackenzie is 4,241&amp;nbsp;km (2,635&amp;nbsp;mi) long and is one of the longest rivers in the world. The St. Lawrence and the Mackenzie are the second and third largest rivers by volume of discharge, respectively, in North America.

===Drainage basins===
{{See also|List of rivers in Canada}}

The '''Atlantic watershed''' drains the entirety of the [[Atlantic provinces]] (parts of the Quebec-Labrador [[Border|boundary]] are fixed at the Atlantic [[continental divide]]), most of inhabited Quebec and large parts of southern Ontario. It is mostly drained by the economically important '''St. Lawrence River''' and its tributaries, notably the [[Saguenay River|Saguenay]], [[Manicouagan River|Manicouagan]] and [[Ottawa River|Ottawa]] rivers. The Great Lakes and [[Lake Nipigon]] are also drained by the St. Lawrence. The [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Churchill River]] and [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|St. John River]] are other important elements of the Atlantic watershed in Canada.

The '''Hudson Bay watershed''' drains over a third of Canada. It covers Manitoba, northern Ontario and Quebec, most of Saskatchewan, southern Alberta, southwestern Nunavut and the southern half of [[Baffin Island]]. This basin is most important in fighting [[drought]] in the [[Canadian Prairies|prairies]] and producing hydroelectricity, especially in Manitoba, northern Ontario and Quebec. Major elements of this watershed include [[Lake Winnipeg]], [[Nelson River]], the [[North Saskatchewan River|North Saskatchewan]] and [[South Saskatchewan River]]s, [[Assiniboine River]], and [[Nettilling Lake]] on Baffin Island. [[Wollaston Lake]] lies on the boundary between the Hudson Bay and Arctic Ocean watersheds and drains into both. It is the largest lake in the world that naturally drains in two directions.

The Continental Divide in the Rockies separates the '''Pacific watershed''' in British Columbia and the Yukon from the Arctic and Hudson Bay watersheds. This watershed irrigates the agriculturally important areas of inner British Columbia (such as the [[Okanagan River|Okanagan]] and [[Kootenay River|Kootenay]] valleys), and is used to produce hydroelectricity. Major elements are the [[Yukon River|Yukon]], [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and [[Fraser River]]s.

The northern parts of Alberta, Manitoba and British Columbia, most of Northwest Territories and Nunavut, and parts of the Yukon are drained by the '''Arctic watershed'''. This watershed has been little used for hydroelectricity, with the exception of the [[Mackenzie River]], the longest river in Canada. The [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace]], [[Athabasca River|Athabasca]] and [[Liard River]]s, as well as Great Bear Lake and Great Slave Lake (respectively the largest and second largest lakes wholly enclosed by Canada) are significant elements of the Arctic watershed. Each of these elements eventually merges with the Mackenzie, thereby draining the vast majority of the Arctic watershed.

The southernmost part of Alberta drains into the '''Gulf of Mexico''' through the [[Milk River (Montana-Alberta)|Milk River]] and its tributaries. The Milk River originates in the Rocky Mountains of [[Montana]], then flows into Alberta, then returns into the [[United States]], where it is drained by the [[Missouri River]]. A small area of southwestern Saskatchewan is drained by [[Battle Creek (Milk River)|Battle Creek]], which empties into the Milk River.

==Floristic geography==
[[Image:portneuf.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Mixed forest]] landscape in Réserve Faunique de Portneuf, Québec]]
{{Main|Ecoregions of Canada}}
{{See also|Flora of Canada|Fauna of Canada}}

Canada has produced a [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] in response to the 1992 international accord; the plan addresses conservation of [[endangered species]] and certain habitats. The main [[biome]]s of Canada are:

* [[Tundra]]
* [[Boreal forest]]
* [[Mixed forest]]
* [[Broadleaf forest]]
* [[Prairie]]s
* [[Rocky Mountains]], vegetation includes various types of tundra and forests
* [[Temperate coniferous forests]], of which the [[Temperate rain forest]]s of coastal British Columbia is an example.

==Political geography==

Canada is divided into [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]]. According to [[Statistics Canada]], 72.0% of the population is concentrated within {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=off|lk=off}} of the nation's southern border with the United States, 70.0% live south of the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], and over 60% of the population lives along the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River between [[Windsor, Ontario]] and [[Quebec City]]. This leaves the vast majority of Canada's territory as sparsely populated wilderness; Canada's population density is 3.5 people/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (9.1/mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), among the lowest in the world. Despite this, 79.7% of Canada's population resides in [[Urban area|urban]] areas, where population densities are increasing.

Canada shares with the U.S. the world's [[United States-Canada border|longest undefended border]] at {{convert|8893|km|mi|abbr=off|lk=off}}; {{convert|2477|km|mi|abbr=off|lk=off}} are with [[Alaska]]. The [[Denmark|Danish]] island dependency of [[Greenland]] lies to Canada's northeast, separated from the [[Canadian Arctic islands]] by [[Baffin Bay]] and [[Davis Strait]]. The [[France|French]] islands of [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]] lie off the southern coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and have a maritime territorial enclave within Canada's [[Exclusive Economic Zone]]. Canada also shares a land border with [[Denmark]], as maps released in December 2006 show that the agreed upon boundaries run through the middle of [[Hans Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Canadian Press |url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/07/26/hans-technology.html |title=Satellite imagery moves Hans Island boundary |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2007-07-26 |accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's geographic proximity to the United States has historically bound the two countries together in the political world as well. Canada's position between the [[Soviet Union]] (now [[Russia]]) and the U.S. was strategically important during the [[Cold War]] since the route over the North Pole and Canada was the fastest route by air between the two countries and the most direct route for [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s.  Since the end of the Cold War, there has been growing speculation that [[Canadian Arctic|Canada's Arctic]] maritime claims may become increasingly important if [[global warming]] melts the ice enough to open the [[Northwest Passage]].

Similarly, the disputed—and tiny—[[Hans Island]] (with Denmark), in the [[Nares Strait]] between [[Ellesmere Island]] and northern Greenland, may be a flashpoint for challenges to overall claims of Canadian sovereignty in [[Canadian Arctic|The North]].

==Natural resources==
{{see also|History of the petroleum industry in Canada}}
Canada's abundance of [[natural resources]] is reflected in their continued importance in the [[economy of Canada]]. Major resource-based industries are [[fisheries]], [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], [[Fossil Fuel|petroleum products]] and [[mining]].

The fisheries industry has historically been one of Canada's strongest. Unmatched [[cod]] stocks on the [[Grand Banks]] off Newfoundland launched this industry in the 16th century. Today these stocks are nearly depleted, and their conservation has become a preoccupation of the [[Atlantic Provinces]]. On the West Coast, [[tuna]] stocks are now restricted. The less depleted (but still greatly diminished) [[salmon]] population continues to drive a strong fisheries industry. Canada claims {{convert|12|nmi|km|abbr=off|lk=off}} of territorial sea, a contiguous zone of {{convert|24|nmi|km|abbr=off|lk=off}}, an [[exclusive economic zone]] of {{convert|200|nmi|km|abbr=off|lk=off}} and a continental shelf of {{convert|200|nmi|km|abbr=off|lk=off}} or to the edge of the continental margin.

Forestry has long been a major industry in Canada. Forest products contribute one fifth of the nation's exports. The provinces with the largest forestry industries are British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. Fifty-four percent of Canada's land area is covered in forest. The boreal forests account for four-fifths of Canada's forestland.

[[Image:Grain Elevator 047.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Albertan [[grain elevator]]s]]
Five per cent of Canada's land area is arable, none of which is for permanent crops. Three per cent of Canada's land area is covered by permanent pastures. Canada has 7,200 square kilometres (2,800&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of irrigated land (1993 estimate). Agricultural regions in Canada include the Canadian Prairies, the [[Lower Mainland]] and interior plateau of British Columbia, the [[St. Lawrence Basin]] and the Canadian [[Maritimes]]. Main crops in Canada include [[flax]], [[oat]]s, [[wheat]], [[maize]], [[barley]], [[sugar beet]]s and [[rye]] in the prairies; flax and maize in [[Western Ontario]]; Oats and [[potato]]es in the Maritimes. [[Fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s are grown primarily in the [[Annapolis Valley]] of Nova Scotia, [[Southwestern Ontario]], the [[Golden Horseshoe]] region of Ontario, along the south coast of [[Georgian Bay]] and in the [[Okanagan]] Valley of British Columbia. [[Cattle]] and [[domestic sheep|sheep]] are raised in the valleys of British Columbia. Cattle, sheep and [[Hog (swine)|hog]]s are raised on the prairies, cattle and hogs in Western Ontario, sheep and hogs in Quebec, and sheep in the Maritimes. There are significant [[dairy]] regions in central Nova Scotia, southern New Brunswick, the St. Lawrence Valley, [[northeastern Ontario]], southwestern Ontario, the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] valley of Manitoba and the valleys of eastern British Columbia, on [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[Lower mainland]].

Fossil fuels are a more recently developed resource in Canada, with [[petroleum|oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] being extracted from deposits in the [[Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin]] since the mid 1900's. While Canada's [[crude oil]] deposits are fewer, technological developments in recent decades have opened up oil production in Alberta's [[Tar Sands]] to the point where Canada now has some of the largest reserves of oil in the world. In other forms, Canadian industry has long exploited large [[coal]] and [[natural gas]] reserves.

Canada's mineral resources are diverse and extensive. Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large [[iron]], [[nickel]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[gold]], [[lead]], [[molybdenum]], and [[uranium]] reserves. Large [[diamond]] concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic, making Canada one of the world's largest producers. Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the [[Sudbury Basin]] is an ancient [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]]. The nearby, but less known [[Temagami Magnetic Anomaly]] has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.&lt;ref name=&quot;GH&quot;&gt;[http://gdcinfo.agg.nrcan.gc.ca/app/3Dimaging/temagami_e.html 3-D Magnetic Imaging using Conjugate Gradients: Temagami anomaly] Retrieved on 2008-03-13&lt;/ref&gt; The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important [[logging]] industry.

Canada's many rivers have afforded extensive development of hydroelectric power. Extensively developed in British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and Labrador, the many dams have long provided a clean, dependable source of energy.

==Natural hazards==
{{See also|Drought in Canada|Drought Research Initiative}}
Continuous permafrost in the north is a serious obstacle to development. Cyclonic storms form east of the Rocky mountains, a result of the mixing of air masses from the Arctic, Pacific, and North American interior, and produce most of the country's rain and [[snow]]

==Current environmental issues==
{{See also|Acid rain|Kyoto Protocol}}
Air pollution and resulting [[acid rain]] severely affects lakes and damages forests. Metal smelting, coal-burning utilities, and vehicle emissions impact agricultural and forest productivity. And ocean waters are becoming contaminated from agricultural, industrial, mining, and forestry activities.

Global [[climate change]] and the warming of the polar region will likely cause significant changes to the environment, including loss of the [[polar bear]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The northernmost point within the boundaries of Canada is [[Cape Columbia]], [[Ellesmere Island]], [[Nunavut]] (83°08' N, 74°13'W). The [[North Pole]] at 90°N is the northernmost water point. The northernmost point of the Canadian mainland is [[Murchison Promontory]] on [[Boothia Peninsula]], Nunavut (71°58'N).

The southernmost point is [[Middle Island (Lake Erie)|Middle Island]], in [[Lake Erie]], [[Ontario]] (41°41'N, 82°40'W); the southernmost water point lies just south of the island, on the Ontario-[[Ohio]] border (41°40'35&quot;N). The southernmost point of the Canadian mainland is [[Point Pelee National Park|Point Pelee]], Ontario (41°54'23&quot;N).

The westernmost point is [[Boundary Peak 187]] (141°00' 7.128&quot;W) at the southern end of the [[Yukon]]-[[Alaska]] border which is roughly following 141°W but leans very slightly east as it goes North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Ethnic origin===
{{Main|Ethnic origins of people in Canada}}
Canadians were able to self-identify one or more ethnic origins in the [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 census]]. Percentages may therefore add up to more than 100%. The most common response was 'Canadian'. As data is completely self-reported, and reporting individuals may have varying definitions of &quot;Ethnic origin&quot; (or may not know their ethnic origin), these figures should not be considered an exact record of the relative prevalence of different ethnocultural ancestries.

Statistics Canada projects that, by 2031, approximately 28% of the population will be foreign-born. The number of people belonging to [[visible minority]] groups will double,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
and make up the majority of the population in Toronto and Vancouver.

'''Single responses:''' 18.40% of respondents gave a single response of 'Canadian', while a further 13.82% identified with both 'Canadian', and one or more other ancestries. 4.38% of respondents gave a single response of [[English people|English]], 3.94% gave a single response of [[French people|French]], 3.63% gave a single response of [[Chinese people|Chinese]], 2.50% gave a single response of [[Demographics of India|East Indian]], 2.37% gave a single response of [[Italian people|Italian]], 2.15% gave a single response of [[Germans|German]], 1.82% gave a single response of [[Scottish people|Scottish]], 1.64% gave a single response of [[First Nations|North American Indian]], 1.57% gave a single response of [[Irish people|Irish]], and 1.03% gave a single response of [[Filipino people|Filipino]].

'''Multiple responses:''' Counting both single and multiple responses, the most commonly identified ethnic origins were (2006):

{{Canadian politics}}

The '''politics of Canada''' function within a framework of [[parliamentary democracy]] and a [[federation|federal system]] of [[Parliament of Canada|parliamentary government]] with strong [[Democracy|democratic]] traditions. Canada has a [[multi-party system]] in which many of the country's legislative practices derive from the unwritten [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] of and precedents set by [[Great Britain]]'s [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster Parliament]]. However, [[Canada]] has evolved variations: party discipline in Canada is stronger than in the United Kingdom and more parliamentary votes are considered [[Motion of Confidence|motions of confidence]], which tends to diminish the role of [[Cabinet (government)|non-Cabinet]] [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs). Such members, in the government [[caucus]], and junior or lower-profile members of [[parliamentary opposition|opposition]] caucuses, are known as [[backbencher]]s. Backbenchers can, however, exert their influence by sitting in parliamentary committees, like the Public Accounts Committee or the National Defence Committee. The two dominant political parties in Canada have historically been the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] and the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], and as of the 2011 election the social democratic [[New Democratic Party]] has risen to prominence. Smaller parties like the Quebec nationalist [[Bloc Québécois]] and the [[Green Party of Canada]] can exert their own influence over the political process.

Canada's governmental structure was originally established by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] through the [[British North America Act]] (now known as the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]),&lt;ref&gt;''[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/Const/index.html THE Constitution Act, 1867]'', s. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; but the federal model and division of powers were devised by Canadian politicians. Particularly after [[World War I]], citizens of the self-governing [[Dominion]]s, such as Canada, began to develop a strong sense of identity, and, in the [[Balfour Declaration, 1926|Balfour Declaration]] of 1926, the British government expressed its intent to grant full autonomy to these regions.

Thus in 1931, the British Parliament passed the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], giving legal recognition to the autonomy of Canada and other Dominions. Following this, Canadian politicians were unable to obtain consensus on a process for amending the constitution until 1982, meaning amendments to Canada's constitution continued to require the approval of the British parliament until that date. Similarly, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in Britain continued to make the final decision on criminal appeals until 1933 and on civil appeals until 1949.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/court-cour/creation/index-eng.asp The Creation and Beginnings of the Supreme Court of Canada'']&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See|Flag of Canada}}

===Monarchy===
; [[Head of state]] : [[Elizabeth II]], [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]] (since February 6, 1952).

; [[Viceroy]] : [[David Lloyd Johnston]], [[Governor General of Canada]] (since October 1, 2010).

===Executive power===
[[File:Prime Ministers of Canada to 1963.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[List of Prime Ministers of Canada|Canada's Prime Ministers]] from 1867 to 1963 ]]
; [[Head of government]] : [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] (since February 6, 2006).

; [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] : [[The Ministry|Ministers]] (usually around thirty) chosen by the Prime Minister and appointed by the Governor General to lead various ministries and agencies, generally with regional representation. Traditionally most, if not all, cabinet ministers will be members of the leader's own party in the House of Commons (see [[Cabinet of Canada]]); however this is not legally or constitutionally mandated, and occasionally the Prime Minister will appoint a cabinet minister from another party.

; Elections : The monarchy is hereditary. The Governor General is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister for a non-specific term, though it is traditionally approximately five years. Following legislative elections, the leader of the majority party in the House of Commons is usually designated by the Governor General to become Prime Minister.
{{See|Monarchy of Canada|Monarchy in the Canadian provinces|Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Premier (Canada)|Elections in Canada}}

===Legislative power===
The [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Parliament of Canada]] consists of three parts: the [[Monarchy in Canada|monarch]], the [[Canadian Senate|Senate]], and the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]].

Currently, the Senate, which is frequently described as providing &quot;regional&quot; representation, has 105 members appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister to serve until age 75. It was created with equal representation from each of Ontario, Quebec, the Maritime region and the Western Provinces. However, it is currently the product of various specific exceptions, additions and compromises, meaning that regional equality is not observed, nor is representation-by-population. The normal number of senators can be exceeded by the monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister, as long as the additional senators are distributed equally with regard to region (up to a total of eight additional Senators). This power of additional appointment has only been used once, when Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] petitioned [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] to add eight seats to the Senate so as to ensure the passage of the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] legislation.

The House of Commons currently has 308 members elected in [[single-member district]]s in a [[plurality voting system]] (first past the post), meaning that members must attain only a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] (the most votes of any candidate) rather than a [[majority]] (50 percent plus one). The [[Electoral district (Canada)|electoral districts]] are also known as [[Riding (country subdivision)|ridings]].

Mandates cannot exceed five years; an election must occur by the end of this time. This fixed mandate has been exceeded only once, when Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] perceived the need to do so during [[World War I]]. The size of the House and [[apportionment]] of seats to each province is revised after every census, conducted every five years, and is based on population changes and approximately on representation-by-population.

===Majority and minority governments===
[[Canadians]] vote for their local Member of Parliament (MP) only. The party leaders are elected prior to the general elections by party memberships. Parties elect their leaders in [[run-off election]]s to ensure that the winner receives more than 50% of the votes. Normally the party leader stands as a candidate to be an MP during an election.

The election of a local MP gives a seat to one of the several political parties. The party that gets the most seats normally forms the government, with that party's leader becoming prime minister. The Prime Minister is not directly elected by the general population, although the Prime Minister is directly elected as an MP within his or her constituency.

Canada's parliamentary system empowers political parties and their party leaders. Where one party gets a majority of the seats in the House of Commons, that party is said to have a &quot;majority government.&quot; Through party discipline, the party leader, who is only elected in one riding, exercises a great deal of control over the cabinet and the parliament.

A [[minority government]] situation occurs when the party that holds the most seats in the House of Commons still holds less than the opposition parties combined. In this scenario a party leader is selected by the Governor General to lead the government, however, to attempt to create stability, the person chosen must command the support of at least one other party.

==Federal-provincial relations==
In Canada, [[Provinces and territories of Canada|the provinces]] are considered co-sovereign; [[sovereignty]] of the provinces is passed on, not by the Governor General or the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]], but through the Crown itself. This means that the Crown is &quot;divided&quot; into 11 legal jurisdictions; into 11 &quot;Crowns&quot; – one federal and ten provincial.

Federal-provincial (or intergovernmental, formerly Dominion-provincial) relations is a regular issue in Canadian politics: Quebec wishes to preserve and strengthen its distinctive nature, western provinces desire more control over their abundant natural resources, especially energy reserves; industrialized [[Central Canada]] is concerned with its manufacturing base, and the Atlantic provinces strive to escape from being less affluent than the rest of the country.

In order to ensure that social programs such as health care and education are funded consistently throughout Canada, the &quot;have-not&quot; (poorer) provinces receive a proportionately greater share of federal &quot;[[equalization payments|transfer (equalization) payments]]&quot; than the richer, or &quot;have&quot;, provinces do; this has been somewhat controversial. The richer provinces often favour freezing transfer payments, or rebalancing the system in their favour, based on the claim that they already pay more in taxes than they receive in federal government services, and the poorer provinces often favour an increase on the basis that the amount of money they receive is not sufficient for their existing needs.

Particularly in the past decade, some scholars have argued that the federal government's exercise of its unlimited constitutional spending power has contributed to strained federal-provincial relations. This power, which allows the federal government to spend the revenue it raises in any way that it pleases, allows it to overstep the constitutional division of powers by creating programs that encroach on areas of provincial jurisdiction. The federal spending power is not expressly set out in the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]; however, in the words of the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] the power &quot;can be inferred&quot; from s. 91(1A), &quot;the public debt and property&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2004/2004canlii15104/2004canlii15104.html ''Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. v. Iness''], 2004 CanLII 15104 at paragraph 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

A prime example of an exercise of the spending power is the [[Canada Health Act]], which is a conditional grant of money to the provinces. Regulation of health services is, under the Constitution, a provincial responsibility. However, by making the funding available to the provinces under the Canada Health Act contingent upon delivery of services according to federal standards, the federal government has the ability to influence health care delivery. This spending power, coupled with Supreme Court rulings — such as [[Reference re Canada Assistance Plan (B.C.)]] — that have held that funding delivered under the spending power can be reduced unilaterally at any time, has contributed to strained federal-provincial relations.

===Quebec and Canadian politics===
Except for three short-lived transitional or minority governments, prime ministers from [[Quebec]] led Canada continuously from 1968 to early 2006. Québécois led both [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] and [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] governments in this period.

Monarchs, governors general, and prime ministers are now expected to be at least functional, if not fluent, in both [[Canadian English|English]] and [[French language in Canada|French]]. In selecting leaders, political parties give preference to candidates who are fluently bilingual.

Also, by law, three of the nine positions on the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] must be held by judges from Quebec. This representation makes sure that at least three judges have sufficient experience with the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system to treat cases involving Quebec laws.

==National unity==
Canada has a long and storied history of secessionist movements (see [[Secessionist movements of Canada]]). National unity has been a major issue in Canada since the forced union of [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]] in [[1840]].

The predominant and lingering issue concerning Canadian national unity has been the ongoing conflict between the French-speaking majority in Quebec and the English-speaking majority in the rest of Canada. Quebec's continued demands for recognition of its &quot;[[distinct society]]&quot; through special political status has led to attempts for constitutional reform, most notably with the failed attempts to amend the constitution through the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and the [[Charlottetown Accord]] (the latter of which was rejected through a national [[referendum]]).

Since the [[Quiet Revolution]], sovereigntist sentiments in Quebec have been variably stoked by the [[Canada Act 1982|patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982]] (without Quebec's consent) and by the failed attempts at constitutional reform. Two provincial referendums, in [[1980 Quebec referendum|1980]] and [[1995 Quebec referendum|1995]], rejected proposals for sovereignty with majorities of 60% and 50.6% respectively. Given the narrow federalist victory in 1995, a reference was made by the [[Jean Chrétien|Chrétien]] government to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in 1998 regarding the [[Re Secession of Quebec|legality of unilateral provincial secession]]. The court decided that a unilateral declaration of secession would be unconstitutional. This resulted in the passage of the [[Clarity Act]] in 2000.

The [[Bloc Québécois]], a sovereigntist party which runs candidates exclusively in [[Quebec]], was started by a group of MPs who left the Progressive Conservative (PC) party (along with several disaffected Liberal MPs), and first put forward candidates in the 1993 federal election. With the collapse of the PCs in that election, the Bloc and Liberals were seen as the only two viable parties in Quebec. Thus, prior to the 2006 election, any gain by one party came at the expense of the other, regardless of whether national unity was really at issue. The Bloc, then, benefited (with a significant increase in seat total) from the impressions of corruption that surrounded the Liberal Party in the leadup to the 2004 election. However, the newly-unified Conservative party re-emerged as a viable party in Quebec by winning 10 seats in the 2006 election, meaning that Quebecers' electoral choices are now more complex.

[[Western alienation]] is another national-unity-related concept that enters into Canadian politics. Residents of the four western provinces, particularly Alberta, have often been unhappy with a lack of influence and a perceived lack of understanding when residents of [[Central Canada]] consider &quot;national&quot; issues. While this is seen to play itself out through many avenues (media, commerce, and so on.), in politics, it has given rise to a number of political parties whose base constituency is in western Canada. These include the [[United Farmers of Alberta]], who first won federal seats in 1917, the [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressives]] (1921), the [[Social Credit Party of Canada|Social Credit Party]] (1935), the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (1935), the [[Reconstruction Party]] (1935), [[New Democracy (Canada)|New Democracy]] (1940) and most recently the [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] (1989).

The Reform Party's slogan &quot;The West Wants In&quot; was echoed by commentators when, after a successful merger with the PCs, the successor party to both parties, the Conservative Party won the 2006 election. Led by Stephen Harper, who is an MP from Alberta, the electoral victory was said to have made &quot;The West IS In&quot; a reality. However, regardless of specific electoral successes or failures, the concept of western alienation continues to be important in Canadian politics, particularly on a provincial level, where opposing the federal government is a common tactic for provincial politicians. For example, in 2001, a group of prominent Albertans produced the [[Alberta Agenda]], urging Alberta to take steps to make full use of its constitutional powers, much as Quebec has done.

==Political conditions==
Canada is considered by most sources to be a very stable democracy. In 2006 ''[[The Economist]]'' ranked Canada the third most democratic nation in its [[Democracy Index]], ahead of all other nations in the [[Americas]] and ahead of every nation more populous than itself. In 2008, Canada was ranked World No. 11 and again ahead of all countries more populous and No. 1 for the Americas. (In 2008, the United States was ranked World No. 18, Uruguay World No. 23, and Costa Rica World No. 27.)

The Liberal Party of Canada, under the leadership of Paul Martin, won a minority victory in the June [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 general elections]]. In December 2003, Martin had succeeded fellow Liberal Jean Chrétien, who had, in 2000, become the first Prime Minister to lead three consecutive majority governments since 1945. However, in 2004 the Liberals lost seats in Parliament, going from 172 of 301 Parliamentary seats to 135 of 308, and from 40.9% to 36.7% in the popular vote. The [[Canadian Alliance]], which did well in western Canada in the 2000 election, but was unable to make significant inroads in the East, merged with the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] to form the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] in late 2003.

They proved to be moderately successful in the 2004 campaign, gaining seats from a combined Alliance-PC total of 78 in 2000 to 99 in 2004. However, the new Conservatives lost in popular vote, going from 37.7% in 2000 down to 29.6%. In 2006 the Conservatives, led by Stephen Harper, won a minority government with 124 seats. They improved their percentage from 2004, garnering 36.3% of the vote. During this election, the Conservatives also made major breakthroughs in Quebec. They gained 10 seats here, whereas in 2004 they had no seats.

In the 2011 election, the Conservatives won a majority government with 167 seats. For the first time, the NDP became the Official Opposition, with 102 seats; the Liberals came in third with 34 seats. This was the first election in which the Green Party won a seat, that of leader [[Elizabeth May]]; the Bloc won 4 seats, losing Official Party status.

===Conservatives in power===
{{POV|date=March 2011}}

[[File:Canada_Federal_Election_2004-2011.gif|right|250px|thumb|Political transition in Canada in the first decade of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century]]

The Liberal Party, after dominating Canadian politics since the 1920s, has been in decline in the 21st century. As [[Eugene Lang (minister)|Lang]] (2010) concludes, they lost their majority in Parliament in the 2004 election, were defeated in 2006, and in 2008 became little more than a &quot;rump&quot;, falling to their lowest seat count in decades and a mere 26% of the popular vote. Furthermore, says Lang (a Liberal himself), its prospects &quot;are as bleak as they have ever been.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Lang, &quot;Whither the Liberals? Current State and Prospects of the Liberal Party of Canada,&quot; ''The Journal for International Relations and Global Trends,'' (2010) p. 195 [http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/ipg/ipg-2010-4/lang.pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt; In the election that occured May 2, 2011, the liberals suffered a crushing defeat, managing to secure only 18.9% of the vote share and only 34 seats.  As a result, the Liberals lost their status as official opposition to the NDP.

In explaining these trends, Behiels (2010) reports that &quot;a great many journalists, political advisors, and politicians argue that a new political party paradigm is emerging&quot;; that is, that Canada has recently undergone a watershed political [[Realigning election|realignment]], the sort of political upheaval that happens rarely and often lasts for many years. In terms of the results of the national elections of 2004, 2006, and 2008, as well as [[Stephen Harper]]'s political endurance, many Canadian experts, says Behiels, are generally agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Behiels cites Tom Flanagan, ''Harper's Team: Behind the Scenes in the Conservative Rise to Power'' (2nd ed. McGill-Queens U.P., 2009); Chantal Hébert, ''French Kiss: Stephen Harper's Blind Date with Quebec'' (Knopf Canada, 2007); William Johnson, ''Stephen Harper and the Future of Canada'' (2nd ed. McClelland &amp; Stewart, 2006); Lloyd Mackay, ''Stephen Harper: The Case for Collaborative Governance'' (ECW Press, 2006); Bob Plamondon, ''Full Circle: Death and Resurrection in Canadian Conservative Politics'' (Key Porter Books, 2006); and Paul Wells, ''Right Side Up: The Fall of Paul Martin and the Rise of Stephen Harper's New Conservatism'' (Douglas Gibson Books, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; They see a new power configuration based on a right-wing political party capable of sharply changing the traditional role of the state (federal and provincial) in the twenty-first-century. Behiels says that unlike [[Brian Mulroney]], who tried but failed to challenge the long-term, dominance of the Liberals, Harper's attempt has proven to be more determined, systematic and successful thus far.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Behiels, &quot;Stephen Harper's Rise to Power: Will His 'New' Conservative Party Become Canada’s 'Natural Governing Party' of the Twenty-First Century?,&quot; ''American Review of Canadian Studies'' Vol. 40, No. 1, March 2010, 118–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomfield and Nossal (2007) suggest that the new political alignment has reshaped Canadian foreign policy, especially in improving relations with the United States, taking a harder line on the Middle East conflicts, and backing away from the [[Kyoto Protocol]] on global warming.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bloomfield and Kim Richard Nossal, &quot;Towards an Explicative Understanding of Strategic Culture: The Cases of Australia and Canada&quot;, ''Contemporary Security Policy,'' (2007) '''28''':2, 286–307 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13523260701489859 online].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Party funding reform===
Funding changes were made to ensure greater reliance on personal contributions. Personal donations to federal parties and campaigns benefit from tax credits, although the amount of tax relief depends on the amount given. Also only people paying income taxes receive any benefit from this.

A good part of the reasoning behind the change in funding was that union or business funding should not be allowed to have as much impact on federal election funding as these are not contributions from citizens and are not evenly spread out between parties. They are still allowed to contribute to the election but only in a minor fashion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The new rules stated that a party had to receive 2% of the vote nationwide in order to receive the general federal funding for parties. Each vote garnered a certain dollar amount for a party (approximately $1.75) in future funding. For the initial disbursement, approximations were made based on previous elections. The NDP received more votes than expected (its national share of the vote went up) while the new Conservative Party of Canada received fewer votes than had been estimated and has been asked to refund the difference. The province of [[Quebec]] was the first province to implement a similar system of funding many years before the changes to funding of federal parties.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[Federal political financing in Canada|Federal funds]] are disbursed quarterly to parties, beginning at the start of 2005. For the moment, this disbursement delay leaves the NDP and the Green Party in a better position to fight an election, since they rely more on individual contributors than federal funds. The Green party now receives federal funds, since it for the first time received a sufficient share of the vote in the 2004 election.&lt;ref name=&quot;debates&quot;&gt;[http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAN1039064420080910 ''Greens win spot in TV election debates'', Reuters Canada, September 10, 2008], (accessed September 10, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, news emerged of a funding loophole that &quot;could cumulatively exceed the legal limit by more than $60,000,&quot; through anonymous recurrent donations of 200 dollars to every riding of a party from corporations or unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetyee.ca/Views/2007/08/13/DemoSale/ |title=Our Democracy for Sale, Still |accessdate=2007-08-16 |last=Conacher |first=Duff |date=2007-08-13 |work=The Tyee }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FRTGAM.20070802.wdonations02%2FBNStory%2FNational%2Fhome%2Fangle&amp;ord=20544885 |title=Ottawa refuses to close donation loophole |accessdate=2007-08-16 |last=Leblanc |first=Daniel |coauthors=Jane Taber |date=2007-08-02 |work=The Globe and Mail |archiveurl=http://nationalcitizens.ca/cgi-bin/news.cgi?rm=display&amp;articleID=1186055872&amp;search=&amp;category=3&amp;order=&amp;page=1 |archivedate=2007-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070801.wdonationsloophole01/BNStory/National/home |title=Loophole tears lid off political donations |accessdate=2007-08-16 |last=Leblanc |first=Daniel |date=2007-08-01 |work=The Globe and Mail }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaders debates===
{{Citations missing|article|date=April 2011}}
Commonly, two national debates receive nationwide coverage during an election, one in each official language. Both debates are broadcast in translation, so it is possible to watch either debate without a working knowledge of the language of the debate, although part of the meaning can be lost. People who are bilingual enough to understand both the English- and French-language debates without need of translation will get a better idea of the substances of the two debates and the differences between them if they decide to watch both debates.

Currently only the parties represented in Parliament participate in the debates. The Green Party, however, has argued that it should also be allowed to participate. Its share of the vote has increased greatly, due in part to the new funding formula, in part because it ran in many more ridings than in previous elections (it nominated candidates in every riding in the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004]] and [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 elections]]), and in part to increased popularity. Thus the argument goes that if there is sufficient national support to earn official recognition as a party (i.e., one that is granted funding based on getting 2% or more of the national vote) it should also be allowed to debate on the same level as the other officially recognized parties.

Also, having received 6% of the vote in British Columbia and based on past precedent, the Greens will have a stronger case for being included in the debates in future elections. The Bloc Québécois was allowed to participate in debates on the basis of its support in Quebec – even before it had elected any MPs in a general election (the only Bloc MPs at the time had either switched parties or won in by-elections). Furthermore, on the basis of anticipated support, the [[Reform Party of Canada]] was included in debates despite only having a single MP. Therefore, past party performance or number of seats is not how participants are chosen.

==Judiciary==
{{Main|Supreme Court of Canada}}
{{See also|Court system of Canada|Law of Canada}}
The highest court in Canada is the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] and is the final court of appeal in the [[Canadian justice system]]. The court is composed of nine [[judge]]s: eight [[Puisne Justice]]s and the [[Chief Justice of Canada]]. Justices of the Supreme Court of Canada are appointed by the Governor-in-Council. The [[Supreme Court Act]] limits eligibility for appointment to persons who have been judges of a superior court, or members of the [[Bar association|bar]] for ten or more years. Members of the bar or superior judge of Quebec, by law, must hold three of the nine positions on the Supreme Court of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/S-26/ Supreme Court Act]'', s. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government departments and structure==
The Canadian government operates the public service using departments, smaller agencies (for example,, commissions, tribunals, and boards), and crown corporations. There are two types of departments: central agencies such as Finance, Privy Council Office, and Treasury Board Secretariat have an organizing and oversight role for the entire public service; line departments are departments which perform tasks in a specific area or field, such as the departments of Agriculture, Environment, or Defence.

*Significant departments include [[Department of Finance (Canada)|Finance]], [[Canada Revenue Agency|Revenue]], [[Human Resources and Skills Development Canada|Human Resources and Skills Development]], [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|National Defence]], [[Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada|Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness]], and [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Foreign Affairs]]/[[Department of International Trade (Canada)|International Trade]].

{{Economy of Canada}}
[[Canada]] has the ninth largest economy in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/news/economy/g20/interactive/index.html?cnn=yes&amp;hpt=C2|title=G-20: The new global economy|date=accessdate=2010-11-22 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; (measured in US dollars at market exchange rates), is one of the world's wealthiest nations, and is a member of the [[Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[G8|Group of Eight]] (G8). As with other developed nations, the Canadian economy is dominated by the [[Tertiary sector of industry|service industry]], which employs about three quarters of [[Canadians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/labr68a.htm|title=Actual hours worked per week by industry, seasonally adjusted crack |publisher=Statistics Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of the [[Primary sector of industry|primary sector]], with the [[logging]] and [[petroleum|oil]] industries being two of Canada's most important. Canada also has a sizable manufacturing sector, centered in [[Central Canada]], with the [[Automaker|automobile industry]] especially important.

Canada has one of the highest levels of [[List of countries by economic freedom|economic freedom]] in the world. Today Canada closely resembles the U.S. in its market-oriented economic system, and pattern of production.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia_factbook&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher= Central Intelligence Agency |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ca.html |title=The World Factbook: Canada |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2010, Canada's national unemployment rate stood at 7.6% &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/subjects-sujets/labour-travail/lfs-epa/lfs-epa-eng.htm |title=Latest release from the Labour Force Survey. Friday, January 7, 2011 |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as the economy continues its recovery from the effects of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|2007-2010 global financial crisis]]. In May 2010, provincial unemployment rates varied from a low of 5.0% in [[Saskatchewan]] to a high of 13.8% in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/lfss02a-eng.htm|title=Labour force characteristics, unadjusted, by province (monthly)  |publisher=Statistics Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Forbes Global 2000 list of the world's largest companies in 2008, Canada had 69 companies in the list, ranking 5th next to France.&lt;ref name=&quot;2008 [[Forbes]] Global 2000&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=forbes|authorlink= forbes|publisher= forbes|url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/18/biz_2000global08_The-Global-2000-Canada_10Rank.html|title=Latest release |date=2008-04-02 |accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, Canada’s total [[government debt]] burden is the lowest in the G8.

[[International trade]] makes up a large part of the Canadian economy, particularly of its natural resources. In 2009, agricultural, energy, forestry and mining exports accounted for about 58% of Canada's total exports.&lt;ref name=&quot;www40.statcan.gc.ca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/gblec04-eng.htm|title=Exports of goods on a balance-of-payments basis, by product |publisher=Statistics Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machinery, equipment, automotive products and other manufactures accounted for a further 38% of exports in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;www40.statcan.gc.ca&quot;/&gt; In 2009, exports accounted for approximately 30% of Canada's GDP. The United States is by far its largest trading partner, accounting for about 73% of exports and 63% of imports as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/gblec02a.htm|title=Imports, exports and trade balance of goods on a balance-of-payments basis, by country or country grouping |publisher=Statistics Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's combined exports and imports ranked 8th among all nations in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Top 20 Exporters and Importers in 2006.gif|2006 exports/imports]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada has considerable natural resources spread across its varied regions. As an example, in [[British Columbia]] the forestry industry is of great importance, while the [[Petroleum industry|oil and gas]] industry is important in [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. [[Northern Ontario]] is home to a wide array of mines, while the [[fishing]] industry has long been central to the character of the [[Atlantic provinces]], though it has recently been in steep decline. Canada has mineral resources of coal, copper, iron ore, and gold.

These primary industries are increasingly becoming less important to the overall economy. Only some 4% of Canadians are employed in these fields, and they account for 6.2% of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/gdps04a-eng.htm|title=Gross domestic product at basic prices, by industry (monthly) |publisher=Statistics Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are still paramount in many parts of the country. Many, if not most, towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, exist because of a nearby mine or source of timber. Canada is a world leader in the production of many natural resources such as [[gold]], [[nickel]], [[uranium]], [[diamonds]] and [[lead]]. Several of Canada's largest companies are based in natural resource industries, such as [[EnCana]], [[Cameco]], [[Goldcorp]], and [[Barrick Gold]]. The vast majority of these products are exported, mainly to the United States. There are also many secondary and service industries that are directly linked to primary ones. For instance one of Canada's largest manufacturing industries is the [[pulp and paper]] sector, which is directly linked to the logging industry.

The large reliance on natural resources has several effects on the Canadian economy and Canadian society. While manufacturing and service industries are easy to standardize, natural resources vary greatly by region. This ensures that differing economic structures developed in each region of Canada, contributing to Canada's strong regionalism. At the same time the vast majority of these resources are exported, integrating Canada closely into the international economy. Howlett and Ramesh argue that the inherent instability of such industries also contributes to greater government intervention in the economy, to reduce the social impact of market changes.&lt;ref&gt;Howlett, Michael and M. Ramesh. ''Political Economy of Canada: An Introduction.'' Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such industries also raise important questions of sustainability. Despite many decades as a leading producer, there is little risk of depletion. Large discoveries continue to be made, such as the massive nickel find at [[Voisey's Bay]]. Moreover the far north remains largely undeveloped as producers await higher prices or new technologies as many operations in this region are not yet cost effective. In recent decades Canadians have become less willing to accept the environmental destruction associated with exploiting natural resources. High wages and Aboriginal land claims have also curbed expansion. Instead many Canadian companies have focused their exploration and expansion activities overseas where prices are lower and governments more accommodating. Canadian companies are increasingly playing important roles in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.

The exploitation of renewable resources have raised concerns in recent years. After decades of escalating [[overexploitation]] the [[Cod fisheries|cod fishery]] all but collapsed in the 1990s, and the Pacific salmon industry also suffered greatly. The logging industry, after many years of activism, has in recent years moved to a more sustainable model.

== Overview ==
===Energy===
{{See also|Petroleum production in Canada}}

[[Image:Oil well3419.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Nodding donkey]] pumping an oil well near [[Sarnia, Ontario]]]]Canada is one of the few developed nations that is a net exporter of energy - in 2009 net exports of energy products amounted to 2.9% of GDP. Most important are the large oil and gas resources centred in Alberta and the Northern Territories, but also present in neighbouring [[British Columbia]] and [[Saskatchewan]]. The vast [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] give Canada the world's second largest reserves of oil after Saudi Arabia according to USGS. In British Columbia and [[Quebec]], as well as Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and the Labrador region, hydroelectric power is an inexpensive and relatively environmentally friendly source of abundant energy. In part because of this, Canada is also one of the world's highest per capita consumers of energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ec.gc.ca/soer-ree/English/Indicators/Issues/Energy/Bulletin/ec_iss_e.cfm Environment Canada - Energy Consumption]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentalindicators.com/htdocs/indicators/8ener.htm |title=Canada vs. The OECD: An Environmental Comparison |publisher=Environmentalindicators.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheap energy has enabled the creation of several important industries, such as the large [[aluminum]] industry in British Columbia.

Historically, an important issue in Canadian politics is that while [[Western Canada]] is one of the world's richest sources of energy, the industrial heartland of Southern Ontario has fewer native sources of power. It is, however, cheaper for Alberta to ship its oil to the western United States than to eastern Canada. The eastern Canadian ports thus import significant quantities of oil from overseas, and Ontario makes significant use of [[Nuclear power in Canada|nuclear power]].

In times of high oil prices this means that the majority of Canada's population suffers, while the West benefits. The [[National Energy Policy]] of the early 1980s attempted to force Alberta to sell low priced oil to eastern Canada. This policy proved deeply divisive, and quickly lost its importance as oil prices collapsed in the mid-1980s. One of the most controversial sections of the [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement]] of 1988 was a promise that Canada would never charge the United States more for energy than fellow Canadians.

===Agriculture===

{{Main|Agriculture in Canada}}
[[Image:Alberta modern cement grain elevator 034 cropped.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A grain elevator in Alberta]]
Canada is also one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products, particularly of wheat and other grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/modules/prb98-2-grain/grainmarket-e.htm |title=The Relative Position of Canada in the World Grain Market |publisher=Dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca |date=2002-10-02 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada is a major exporter of agricultural products, to the United States but also to Europe and East Asia. As with all other developed nations the proportion of the population and GDP devoted to agriculture fell dramatically over the 20th century.

As with other developed nations, the Canadian agriculture industry receives significant government subsidies and supports. However, Canada has been a strong supporter of reducing market influencing subsidies through the [[World Trade Organization]]. In 2000, Canada spent approximately CDN$4.6 billion on supports for the industry. Of this, $2.32 billion was classified under the WTO designation of &quot;green box&quot; support, meaning it did not directly influence the market, such as money for research or disaster relief. All but $848.2 million were subsidies worth less than 5% of the value of the crops they were provided for, which is the WTO threshold. Consequently, Canada used only $848.2 million of its $4.3 billion subsidy allowance granted by the WTO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/prb0536-e.htm |title=Canada's Domestic Agricultural Supports and the World Trade Organization |publisher=Parl.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing===

The general pattern of development for wealthy nations was a transition from a primary industry based economy to a manufacturing based one, and then to a service based economy. Canada did not escape this pattern - at its (abnormally high World War 2) peak in 1944, manufacturing accounted for 29% of GDP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11f0027m/2009057/ct029-eng.htm|title=Manufacturing's share of gross domestic product, 1900 to 2005 |publisher=Statistics Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; declining to 15.6% in 2005. Canada has not suffered as greatly as most other rich, industrialized nations from the pains of the relative decline in the importance of manufacturing since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11f0027m/2009057/ct030-eng.htm|title=Manufacturing share of gross domestic product, 1961 to 2007 |publisher=Statistics Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study by [[Statistics Canada]] also found that, while manufacturing declined as a relative percentage of GDP from 24.3% in the 1960s to 15.6% in 2005, manufacturing volumes between 1961 and 2005 kept pace with the overall growth in the volume index of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11f0027m/2009057/aftertoc-aprestdm2-eng.htm|title=The Canadian Manufacturing Sector: Adapting to Challenges |publisher=Statistics Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturing in Canada was especially hard hit by the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|2007-2010 global financial crisis]]. As of 2010, manufacturing accounts for 13% of Canada's GDP,&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;/&gt; a relative decline of more than 2% of GDP since 2005.

Central Canada is home to [[branch plant]]s to all the major American and Japanese automobile makers and many parts factories owned by Canadian firms such as [[Magna International]] and [[Linamar|Linamar Corporation]]. Central Canada today produces more vehicles each year than the neighbouring U.S. state of [[Michigan]], the heart of the American automobile industry. Manufacturers have been attracted to Canada due to the highly educated population with lower labour costs than the United States. Canada's [[publicly funded health care]] system is also an important attraction, as it exempts companies from the high health insurance costs they must pay in the United States.

Much of the Canadian manufacturing industry consists of branch plants of United States firms, though there are some important domestic manufacturers, such as [[Bombardier Inc.]]. This has raised several concerns for Canadians. Branch plants provide mainly [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] jobs, with research and executive positions confined to the United States.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Service sector===
[[Image:TD Centre View from Yonge and King.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The [[Toronto-Dominion Centre]] in Toronto]]

The service sector in Canada is vast and multifaceted, employing some three quarters of Canadians and accounting for over two thirds of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ca.html |title=CIA World Factbook - Canada |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest employer is the [[retail]] sector, employing almost 12% of Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Iain, ''A Geography of the Canadian Economy.'' Don Mills: Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The retail industry is mainly concentrated in a small number of chain stores clustered together in [[shopping mall]]s. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of [[big-box store]]s, such as [[Wal-Mart]] (of the United States) and [[Future Shop]] (a subsidiary of the US based [[Best Buy]]) and Zellers (since most of their leases have been purchased by [[Target]]). This has led to fewer workers in this sector and a migration of retail jobs to the suburbs.

The second largest portion of the service sector is the business services, employing only a slightly smaller percentage of the population. This includes the [[financial services]], [[real estate]], and communications industries. This portion of the economy has been rapidly growing in recent years. It is largely concentrated in the major urban centres, especially [[Toronto]], Montreal and Vancouver (see [[Banking in Canada]]).

The education and health sectors are two of Canada's largest, but both are largely under the purview of the government. The health care industry has been rapidly growing, and is the third largest in Canada. Its rapid growth has led to problems for governments who must find money to fund it.

Canada has an important [[high tech]] industry, and also an entertainment industry creating content both for local and international consumption. [[Tourism in Canada|Tourism]] is of ever increasing importance, with the vast majority of international visitors coming from the United States. Though the recent strength of the Canadian Dollar has hurt this sector, other nations such as China have increased tourism to Canada.

==Political issues==
===Regional imbalances===
The Canadian economy differs greatly from region to region.  Traditionally Central Canada has been the economic engine of Canada, home to more than half of its population and much of its industry. Recent years have seen rapid growth in Western Canada as trade with Asia has enriched British Columbia and oil wealth provided a major boost to Alberta and Saskatchewan.

The four Atlantic provinces, though once the centre of economic activity, underwent a major decline in the late 19th century and have traditionally been significantly poorer than the rest of Canada, especially after the recent collapse of the fishing industry. Recent years have seen some significant moves towards diversification, especially as offshore oil and gas wealth have begun to flow into the region. Quebec has also traditionally been poorer than the Canadian average although by a lesser margin than the Atlantic provinces. In more recent years [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] have started to see a change in their economy, being called the &quot;Celtic tiger of Canada,&quot; (in a comparison to the economic transformation in Ireland); it has also been called a &quot;mini Alberta&quot; because of new oil and gas exploration. While many Newfoundlanders and Labradorians still emigrate to Alberta for higher-paying jobs, the province's population has been on the rise in recent years with many people deciding to move back home.

===Relations with the U.S.===
{{Main|Canada – United States relations}}
Canada and the United States share a common trading relationship. Canada's job market continues to perform well along with the US, reaching a 30 year low in the unemployment rate in December 2006, following 14 consecutive years of employment growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/070105/d070105a.htm |title=The Daily, Friday, January 5, 2007. Labour Force Survey |publisher=Statcan.ca |date=2007-01-05 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Flags-of-usa-and-canada.jpg|thumb|Flags of Canada and the United States]]
The United States is by far Canada's largest trading partner, with more than [http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/gblec02a.htm $1.7] billion [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] in trade per day in 2005. In 2009 73% of Canada's exports went to the United States, and 63% of Canada's imports were from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/gblec02a-eng.htm |title=Imports, exports and trade balance of goods on a balance-of-payments basis, by country or country grouping |publisher=0.statcan.gc.ca |date=2011-02-11 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade with Canada makes up 23% of the United States' exports and 17% of its imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=FTDWebMaster, [Name of person creating HTML] |url=http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/top/top0512.html |title=FTD - Statistics - Trade Highlights - Top Trading Partners |publisher=Census.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By comparison, in 2005 this was more than U.S. trade with all countries in the [[European Union]] combined,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=FTDWebMaster, FTD Data Dissemination |url=http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c0003.html |title=FTD - Statistics - Country Data - U.S. Trade Balance with European Union |publisher=Census.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and well over twice U.S. trade with all the countries of [[Latin America]] combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=FTDWebMaster, FTD Data Dissemination |url=http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c0009.html#2005 |title=FTD - Statistics - Country Data - U.S. Trade Balance with South and Central America |publisher=Census.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Just the two-way trade that crosses the [[Ambassador Bridge]] between [[Michigan]] and [[Ontario]] equals all U.S. exports to [[Japan]]. Canada's importance to the United States is not just a border-state phenomenon: Canada is the leading export market for 35 of 50 U.S. states, and is the United States' largest foreign supplier of energy.

Bilateral trade increased by 52% between 1989, when the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) went into effect, and 1994, when the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) superseded it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Trade has since increased by 40%. NAFTA continues the FTA's moves toward reducing trade barriers and establishing agreed-upon trade rules. It also resolves some long-standing bilateral irritants and liberalizes rules in several areas, including agriculture, services, energy, financial services, investment, and government procurement. NAFTA forms the largest trading area in the world, embracing the 405 million people of the three North American countries.

The largest component of U.S.-Canada trade is in the [[commodity]] sector.

The U.S. is Canada's largest agricultural export market, taking well over half of all Canadian food exports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ats.agr.ca/stats/4141_e.pdf Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada / Agriculture et Agroalimentaire Canada&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Canada is the largest market for U.S. agricultural goods, with nearly 20% of American food exports going to its northern neighbour.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Nearly two-thirds of Canada's forest products, including [[pulp (paper)|pulp]] and [[paper]], are exported to the United States; 72% of Canada's total [[newsprint]] production also is exported to the U.S.

At [http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/statistics/energy/default.html $73.6] billion in 2004, U.S.-Canada trade in [[energy development|energy]] is the largest U.S. energy trading relationship, with the overwhelming majority ($66.7 billion) being exports from Canada. The primary components of U.S. energy trade with Canada are [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], and [[electricity]]. Canada is the United States' largest oil supplier and the fifth-largest energy producing country in the world. Canada provides about 16% of U.S. oil imports and 14% of total U.S. consumption of natural gas. The United States and Canada's national electricity grids are linked, and both countries share [[hydropower]] facilities on the western borders.

While most of U.S.-Canada trade flows smoothly, there are occasionally bilateral trade disputes, particularly in the agricultural and cultural fields.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Usually these issues are resolved through bilateral consultative forums or referral to [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) or NAFTA dispute resolution.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In May 1999, the U.S. and Canadian governments negotiated an agreement on [[magazine]]s that provides increased access for the U.S. [[publishing]] industry to the Canadian market. The United States and Canada also have resolved several major issues involving [[fishery|fisheries]]. By common agreement, the two countries submitted a [[Gulf of Maine]] boundary dispute to the [[International Court of Justice]] in 1981; both accepted the court's 12 October 1984 ruling which demarcated the territorial sea boundary. A current issue between the United States and Canada is the ongoing [[US - Canada softwood lumber dispute|softwood lumber dispute]], as the U.S. alleges that Canada unfairly subsidizes its forestry industry.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

In 1990, the United States and Canada signed a bilateral Fisheries Enforcement Agreement, which has served to deter illegal fishing activity and reduce the risk of injury during fisheries enforcement incidents. The U.S. and Canada signed a [[Pacific Salmon]] Agreement in June 1999 that settled differences over implementation of the 1985 Pacific Salmon Treaty for the next decade.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Canada and the United States signed an [[aviation]] agreement during [[Bill Clinton]]'s visit to Canada in February 1995, and air traffic between the two countries has increased dramatically as a result. The two countries also share in operation of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]], connecting the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.howstuffworks.com/united-states/the-st-lawrence-seaway.htm |title=HowStuffWorks &quot;The St. Lawrence Seaway&quot; |publisher=Geography.howstuffworks.com |date=2008-03-30 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. is Canada's largest foreign investor and the most popular destination for Canadian foreign investments; at the end of 2007, the stock of U.S. direct investment in Canada was estimated at $293 billion, while Canadian direct investment (stock) in the United States was valued at $213 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/economist-economiste/assets/pdfs/FDI_stocks-Inward_by_Country-ENG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/109490.pdf |title=Foreign Direct Investment in the United States: An Economic Analysis |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. FDI accounts for 59.5% of total [[foreign direct investment]] in Canada while Canadian FDI in the U.S. accounts for 10% (5th largest foreign investor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/washington/commerce_wa/trade_partnership-partenariat_commerce.aspx?lang=eng |title=The Canada-U.S. trade and investment partnership |publisher=Canadainternational.gc.ca |date=2008-10-28 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; US investments are primarily directed at Canada's [[mining]] and [[smelting]] industries, petroleum, chemicals, the manufacture of machinery and transportation equipment, and finance, while Canadian investment in the United States is concentrated in manufacturing, wholesale trade, real estate, petroleum, finance, and insurance and other services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/prb0833-e.htm#Foreign |title=Overview of Canadian Foreign Direct Investment (PRB-0833E) |publisher=.parl.gc.ca |date=2008-06-17 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
&lt;ref&gt;There is an apparent discrepancy between the factbook's 65.4% of GDP estimate for Canada's debt in 2006 [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ca.html], and the 30.2% trumpeted by the Canadian government at [http://www.fin.gc.ca/ec2006/ec/eca1e.html]. Both numbers are correct. The reason is that the Canadian government uses the OECD's ''net'' financial liabilities, while the CIA World Factbook uses a different measure of financial liabilities. The OECD itself reports the gross number as 68%, and the net number as 30.2% [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4456/is_80/ai_n18617470]. The net number places Canada as one of the least indebted G8 countries, while the gross number is less flattering.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transport Canada]] oversees and regulates most aspects of transportation within Canadian jurisdiction. Transport Canada is under the direction of the federal government's [[Minister of Transport (Canada)|Minister of Transport]]. The [[Transportation Safety Board of Canada]] is responsible for maintaining transportation safety in Canada by investigating accidents and making safety recommendations.

Canada's vehicles consumed a total of {{convert|31.4|e6m3|Moilbbl|lk=out}} of [[gasoline]] and {{convert|9.91|e6m3|Moilbbl}} of [[Diesel fuel|diesel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;statcan&quot;/&gt; Trucking generated 35% of the total [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] from transport, compared to 25% for rail, water and air combined (the remainder being generated by the industry's transit, pipeline, scenic and support activities).&lt;ref name=&quot;Trans Sector 05&quot;/&gt; Hence roads are the dominant means of passenger and freight transport in Canada.

Roads and highways were managed by provincial and municipal authorities until construction of the Northwest Highway System (the [[Alaska Highway]]) and the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] project initiation. The Alaska Highway of 1942 was constructed during [[World War II]] for military purposes connecting [[Fort St. John, British Columbia]] with [[Fairbanks, Alaska]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Year&quot;/&gt; The transcontinental highway, a joint national and provincial expenditure, was begun in 1949 under the initiation of the Trans Canada Highway Act on December 10, 1949. The {{convert|7821|km|abbr=on}} highway was completed in 1962 at a total expenditure of $1.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | last = Coneghan | first =Daria | title =Trans-Canada Highway | work =The Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan | publisher =Canadian Plains Research Center, University of Regina | date =2006 | url =http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/trans-canada_highway.html | accessdate =2007-12-29 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally, Canada has road links with both the [[Contiguous United States|lower 48]] US states and [[Alaska]]. The [[Ministry of Transportation (Ontario)|Ministry of Transportation]] maintains the road network in [[Ontario]] and also employs Ministry of Transport Enforcement Officers for the purpose of administering the Canada Transportation Act and related regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cta-otc.gc.ca/contact/regional_e.html |title=Regional Enforcement Officers |accessdate=2007-10-01 |coauthors=Canadian Transportation Agency |publisher=Canadian Transportation Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ogov.newswire.ca/ontario/GPOE/2004/09/21/c2149.html?lmatch=&amp;lang=_e.html |title=Enforcement blitz improves road safety |accessdate=2007-10-01 |coauthors=Ministry of Transportation |publisher=Canada NewsWire}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Department of Transportation (New Brunswick)|Department of Transportation]] in [[New Brunswick]] performs a similar task in that [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] as well.

==Air transport==
{{further|[[:Category:Airports in Canada]]|[[:Category:Lists of airports in Canada]]}}
[[Aviation|Air transportation]] made up 9% of the transport sector's GDP generation in 2005. Canada's largest [[airline|air carrier]] and its [[flag carrier]] is [[Air Canada]], which had 34 million customers in 2006 and, as of April 2010, operates 363 [[aircraft]] (including [[Air Canada Jazz]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;TCFleet&quot;&gt;[http://wwwapps2.tc.gc.ca/Saf-Sec-Sur/2/ccarcs/aspscripts/en/quicksearch.asp Transport Canada listing of aircraft owned by Air Canada and Air Canada Jazz] (enter Air Canada (226 aircraft), Jazz Air LP (137 aircraft), Canadian Helicopters or Westjet in the box titled &quot;Owner Name&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; [[CHC Helicopter]], the largest commercial [[helicopter]] operator in the world, is second with 142 aircraft&lt;ref name=&quot;TCFleet&quot;/&gt; and [[WestJet]], a [[low-cost carrier]] formed in 1996, is third with 88 aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCFleet&quot;/&gt; Canada's airline industry saw significant change following the signing of the US-Canada [[open skies]] agreement in 1995, when the marketplace became less regulated and more competitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/preview/87-003-XIE/P0039987-003-XIE.pdf |title=Travelog - Volume 18, Number 3|accessdate=2008-03-27 |coauthors=|publisher=Statistics Canada |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080409105657/http://www.statcan.ca/english/preview/87-003-XIE/P0039987-003-XIE.pdf |archivedate = 2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian National Railway|Canadian National]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] are Canada's two major freight railway companies, each having operations throughout [[North America]]. In 2007, 357 billion tonne-kilometres of freight were transported by rail, and 4.33 million passengers travelled 1.44 billion passenger-kilometres (an almost negligible amount compared to the 491 billion passenger-kilometres made in light road vehicles). 34,281 people were employed by the rail industry in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Railway carriers, operating statistics | publisher = Statistics Canada | url = http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/trad46a.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080223200711/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/trad46a.htm |archivedate = 2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nation-wide passenger services are provided by the [[Crown corporations of Canada|federal crown corporation]] [[Via Rail]]. Three Canadian cities have [[commuter rail]] services: in the [[Montreal]] area by [[Agence métropolitaine de transport|AMT]], in the [[Toronto]] area by [[GO Transit]], and in the [[Vancouver]] area by [[West Coast Express]]. Smaller railways such as [[Ontario Northland Railway|Ontario Northland]], [[Rocky Mountaineer]], and [[Algoma Central Railway|Algoma Central]] also run passenger trains to remote rural areas.

In Canada railways are served by [[Rail gauge#Canada|standard gauge]], {{RailGauge|ussg}}, rails.

Canada has rail links with the lower 48 US States, but no connection with Alaska other than a [[train ferry]] service from [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]], although a line has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskacanadarail.org |title=AlaskaCanadaRail.org |publisher=AlaskaCanadaRail.org |date=2005-07-01 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no other international rail connections.

[[File:McGillMetro-RushHour.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Montreal Metro]]'s McGill station during rush hour.]]
Most Canadian cities have [[public transport]]ation, if only a [[bus]] system. Six Canadian cities have [[rapid transit]] systems and three have [[commuter rail]] systems (see below). In 2006, 11% of Canadians used public transportation to get to work. This compares to 72.3% that got to work by car, 6.4% that walked and 1.3% that rode a bike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/080402/d080402a.htm |title= The Daily, Wednesday, April 2nd, 2008.| publisher= Statistics Canada| accessdate=2008-04-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080406002605/http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/080402/d080402a.htm |archivedate = 2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Canadian cities have rates of public transit use which are two to three times as high as comparably sized US cities; census data indicates 4.8% of Americans take public transit to work.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | title = Commuting Patterns and Places of Work of Canadians, 2006 Census | publisher = Statistics Canada | year = 2008 | url = http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/analysis/pow/tables/table11b.htm | accessdate = 2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ACS2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = American Community Survey 2006, Table S0802 | publisher = US Census | year = 2008 | url = http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DCGeoSelectServlet?ds_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_ | accessdate = 2008-07-14
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that transportation planners must allow for higher passenger volumes on Canadian transit systems than American ones.

As a result of lower government funding, Canadian cities have to recover a much higher share of their costs out of operating revenues than American counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} This lack of funding may explain why there is resistance to the high capital costs of rail systems and there are only a few light rail systems in Canada.

===Rapid transit systems===
{{Main|Rapid transit in Canada}}
There are six urban rapid transit systems operating in Canada: The [[Montreal Metro]], the [[Toronto subway and RT|Toronto Subway]], the Vancouver [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]], the Calgary [[C-Train]], the [[Edmonton Light Rail Transit]] and the [[Ottawa O-Train|O-Train]] in Ottawa.

==History==
===European contact===
[[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]], relied on [[canoe]]s, [[kayak]]s, [[umiak]]s and [[Bull Boat]]s, in addition to the [[snowshoe]], [[toboggan]] and [[sled]] in winter for transportation prior to European contact. Europeans adopted these technologies as they pushed deeper into the continent's interior, and were thus able to travel via the waterways that fed from the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and [[Hudson Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/ Virtual Vault], an online exhibition of Canadian historical art at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century and early 20th century transportation relied on harnessing oxen to ''[[Red River ox cart]]s'' or horse to waggon. Maritime transportation was via manual labour such as canoe or wind on sail. Water or land travel speeds was approximately {{convert|8|to|15|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeoOfTrans&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =Rodrigue | first = Dr. Jean-Paul | title = Historical Geography of Transportation - Part I | work = Dept. of Economics &amp; Geography | publisher = Hofstra University | date = 1998-2008 | url =http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch1en/conc1en/ch1c3_1en.html | accessdate = 2008-01-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080112113050/http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch1en/conc1en/ch1c3_1en.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Settlement was along river routes. Agricultural commodities were perishable, and trade centres were within {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}. Rural areas centred around villages, and they were approximately {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} apart. The advent of [[Steam locomotive|steam railways]] and [[Steamboat|steamships]] connected resources and markets of vast distances in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeoOfTrans&quot;/&gt; Railways also connected city centres, in such a way that the traveller went by sleeper, railway hotel, to the cities. Crossing the country by train took four or five days, as it still does by car. People generally lived within {{convert|5|mi|0|abbr=on}} of the [[downtown]] core thus the train could be used for inter-city travel and the [[tram]] for commuting.

The advent of the interstate or Trans-Canada Highway in Canada in 1963 established ribbon development, truck stops, and industrial corridors along throughways.

The Federal Department of Transport established November 2, 1936, supervised railways, canals, harbours, marine and shipping, civil aviation, radio and meteorology. The Transportation Act of 1938 and the amended Railway Act, placed control and regulation of carriers in the hands of the Board of Transport commissioners for Canada. The Royal Commission on Transportation was formed December 29, 1948, to examine transportation services to all areas of Canada to eliminate economic or geographic disadvantages. The Commission also reviewed the Railway Act to provide uniform yet competitive freight-rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Year&quot;/&gt;

'''Relations between Canada and the United States''' have spanned more than two centuries. This includes a shared [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonial heritage]], warfare during the 1770s and 1812, and the eventual development of one of the most successful international relationships in the modern world. Each is the other's chief economic partner and large-scale tourism and migration between the two nations has increased the similarities. The most serious breach in the relationship was the [[War of 1812]], which saw an American invasion of then [[British North America]] and counter-invasions from British-Canadian forces. The border was demilitarized after the war and, apart from minor raids, has remained peaceful. Military collaboration began during World War II and continued throughout the [[Cold War]] on both a bilateral basis through [[NORAD]] and through multilateral participation in [[NATO]]. A high volume of trade and migration between the United States and Canada has generated closer ties, especially after the signing of the [[Canada – United States Free Trade Agreement]] in 1988.

Canada and the United States are currently the world's largest trading partners,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/top/dst/current/balance.html 2009 data]&lt;/ref&gt; share [[Canada – United States border|the world's longest border]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelongestlistofthelongeststuffatthelongestdomainnameatlonglast.com/long263.html|title=The world's longest border|accessdate=2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have significant interoperability within the defence sphere. Recent difficulties have included repeated trade disputes, environmental concerns, Canadian concern for the future of [[petroleum|oil]] exports, and issues of illegal immigration and the threat of [[terrorism]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Nevertheless, trade between the two countries has continued to expand in both absolute and relative terms for the last two hundred years, but especially following the 1988 FTA and the subsequent signing of NAFTA of 1994 which has since further merged the two economies.

The foreign policies of the neighbours have been closely aligned since the [[Cold War]] and after. However, Canada has disagreed with American policies regarding the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Cuba-United States relations|status of Cuba]], the [[Iraq War]], [[National Missile Defense in Canada|Missile Defense]], and the [[War on Terrorism]]. A serious [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] debate is whether the [[Northwest Passage]] is in [[international waters]] or under Canadian jurisdiction.

There are close cultural ties between modern day Canada and the United States, advanced in large part because both nations predominately speak English. There are also historical ties between the respective [[Francophone]] populations. Pop culture has depicted and parodied the efforts of both nations to solidify their cultural uniqueness—primarily by Canada, as its population and economy are roughly one tenth that of the United States'-- to deter international perception that Americans and Canadians are virtually identical. Canada remains Americans' favorite foreign nation according to a recent Gallup poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/126116/Canada-Places-First-Image-Contest-Iran-Last.aspx |title=In U.S., Canada Places First in Image Contest; Iran Last |publisher=Gallup.com |date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless there remain Canadian fears of being overwhelmed by its neighbour. James Tagg reports that Canadian university students have a profound fear that &quot;[[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]], and likely Canadian sovereignty, will be overwhelmed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;James Tagg, &quot;'And, We Burned down the White House, Too': American History, Canadian Undergraduates, and Nationalism,&quot; ''The History Teacher,'' Vol. 37, No. 3 (May, 2004), pp. 309-334 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1555672 in JSTOR]; J. L. Granatstein. ''Yankee Go Home: Canadians and Anti-Americanism'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile co-operation on many fronts, such as the ease of the flow of goods services and people across borders are to be even more extended, as well as the establishment of joint border inspection agencies, relocation of U.S. food inspectors agents to Canadian plants and ''vice versa'', greater sharing of intelligence, and harmonizing regulations on everything from food to manufactured goods, thus further increasing the American-Canadian assemblage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20110203/harper-obama-border-summit-faces-sovereignty-delays-110203/ |title=Harper, Obama to push for major border deal - CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Mingling of peoples===
From the 1750s to the 21st century, there has been extensive mingling of the Canadian and American populations, with large movements in both directions.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Lee Hansen, ''The Mingling of the Canadian and American Peoples. Vol. 1: Historical'' (1940)&lt;/ref&gt;

New England [[Yankee|Yankees]] settled large parts of [[Nova Scotia]] before 1775, and were neutral during the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;John Brebner, ''The Neutral Yankees of Nova Scotia: A Marginal Colony During the Revolutionary Years'' (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Revolution, about 75,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] moved out of the new United States to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and the lands of Quebec, east and south of Montreal. From 1790 to 1812 many farmers moved from New York and New England into Ontario (mostly to Niagara, and the north shore of Lake Ontario). In the mid and late 19th century gold rushes attracted American prospectors, mostly to British Columbia (Cariboo, Fraser gold rushes) and later to the Yukon. In the early 20th century, the opening of land blocks in the Prairie Provinces attracted many farmers from the American Midwest. Many Mennonites immigrated from Pennsylvania and formed their own colonies. In the 1890s some Mormons went north to form communities in Alberta after the [[LDS Church]] rejected plural marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Lee Hansen, ''The Mingling of the Canadian and American Peoples. Vol. 1: Historical'' (1940); David D. Harvey, ''Americans in Canada: Migration and Settlement since 1840'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s saw the arrival of about 50,000 draft-dodgers who opposed the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Renee Kasinsky, &quot;Refugees from Militarism: Draft Age Americans in Canada'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th century, about 900,000 French Canadians moved to the U.S., with 395,000 residents there in 1900. Two-thirds went to mill towns in New England, where they formed distinctive ethnic communities. By the late 20th century they had abandoned the French language, but most kept the Catholic religion.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Roby, ''The Franco-Americans of New England'' (2004); Elliott Robert Barkan, &quot;French Canadians&quot; in Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) pp 389–401&lt;/ref&gt; About twice as many English Canadians came to the U.S., but they did not form distinctive ethnic settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Alan A. Brookes, &quot;Canadians, British&quot; in Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) pp 191ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada was a way-station through which immigrants from other lands stopped for a while, ultimately heading to the U.S. In 1851–1951, 7.1 million people arrived in Canada (mostly from Continental Europe), and 6.6 million left Canada, most of them to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) p 392.&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Revolution===
[[Image:CanadianAmericaRelationsCartoon1886.gif|thumb|An editorial cartoon on Canada – United States relations, 1886. It reads: Mrs. Britannia.—“Is it possible, my dear, that you have ever given your cousin Jonathan any encouragement?” Miss Canada.—“Encouragement! Certainly not, Mamma. I have told him that we can never be united.”]]
At the outset of the [[American Revolution]], the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|American revolutionaries]] hoped the [[French Canadians]] in Quebec and the Colonists in [[Nova Scotia]] would join their rebellion and they were pre-approved for joining the United States in the [[Articles of Confederation]]. When [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|Canada was invaded]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], thousands joined the American cause and formed regiments that fought during the war; however most remained neutral and some joined the British effort. Britain advised the French Canadians that the British Empire already enshrined their rights in the [[Quebec Act]], which the American colonies had viewed as one of the [[Intolerable Acts]]. The American invasion was a fiasco and Britain tightened its grip on its northern possessions; in 1777 a major British invasion into New York led to the surrender of the entire British army at Saratoga, and led France to enter the war as an ally of the U.S. The French Canadians largely ignored France's appeals for solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;Mason Wade, ''The French Canadians, 1760-1945'' (1955) p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war Canada became a refuge for about 75,000 [[United Empire Loyalists|Loyalists]] who either wanted to leave the U.S., or were compelled by Patriot reprisals to do so. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Among the original Loyalists there were 3500 free blacks. Most went to Nova Scotia and in 1792, 1200 migrated to [[Sierra Leone]]. About 2000 black slaves were brought in by Loyalist owners; they remained slaves in Canada until the Empire abolished slavery in 1833. Before 1860, about 30,000-40,000 blacks entered Canada; many were already free and others were escaped slaves who came through the [[Underground Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Bode, &quot;Upper Canada, 1793: Simcoe and the Slaves,&quot; ''Beaver'' 1993 73(3): 17-19; Paul Robert Magocsi, ed. ''Enyclopedia of Canada's Peoples'' (1999) p 142-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of 1812===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the war, called for British forces to vacate all their forts south of the [[Great Lakes]] border. Britain refused to do so, citing failure of the United States to provide financial restitution for Loyalists who had lost property in the war. The [[Jay Treaty]] in 1795 with Great Britain resolved that lingering issue and the British departed the forts. [[Thomas Jefferson]] saw the nearby British imperial presence as a threat to [[republicanism in the United States]], and so he opposed the [[Jay Treaty]], and it became one of the major political issues in the United States at the time.

Tensions mounted again after 1805, erupting into the [[War of 1812]], when the Americans declared war on Britain. The Americans were angered by British harassment of U.S. ships on the high seas and seizure (&quot;[[Impressment]]&quot;) of 6,000 sailors from American ships, severe restrictions against neutral American trade with France, and British support for hostile Indian tribes in Ohio and territories the U.S. had gained in 1783. American &quot;honor&quot; was an implicit issue. The Americans were outgunned by more than 10 to 1 by the [[Royal Navy]], and so a land invasion of Canada was proposed as the only feasible means of attacking the British Empire. Americans on the western frontier also hoped an invasion would bring an end to British support of [[American Indians in the United States|Native American]] resistance to the [[westward expansion of the United States]], typified by [[Tecumseh]]'s coalition of tribes. The U.S. strategy in 1812 was to temporarily seize Canada as a means of forcing concessions from the British Empire. There was some hope that settlers in western Canada—most of them recent immigrants from the U.S. --would welcome the chance to overthrow their British rulers. However, the American invasions were incompetent and were defeated primarily by British regulars with support from Native Americans and [[Upper Canada]] (Ontario) militia. Major British invasions of New York in 1814 and Louisiana in 1814-15 were poorly handled and the British retreated, leaving both sides about where they were in 1812. With the collapse of Napoleon, Britain ended naval policies that angered Americans; with the defeat of the Indian tribes that threat to American expansion was ended. The upshot was neither side had anything to fight over, and the war ended by a treaty that took effect in February 1815.

The King's Own was one of the units who marched into Washington. In retaliation for the torching of [[Upper Canada|Upper Canada's]] capital [[York, Upper Canada|York]] (now called Toronto), and to disgrace [[James Madison|President Madison]], they set fire to the president's residence on August 24, 1814, burning down the [[White House]].

In later years, Canadians, who remain loyal to the [[British Empire|Empire]] well into the 20th century, viewed the War of 1812 as a successful resistance against invasion and as a victory that defined them as a people. A common theme ever since has been the fear that Canadian culture needs protection from American influence.

===Alabama claims===
At the end of the [[American Civil War]], Americans were angry at British support for the Confederacy. One result was toleration of [[Fenian raids|Fenian efforts to use the U.S. as a base to attack Canada.]] More serious was the demand for a huge payment to cover the damages caused, on the notion that British involvement had lengthened the war. Senator [[Charles Sumner]], the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, originally wanted to ask for $2 billion, or alternatively the ceding of all of Canada to the United States. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} When American Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] negotiated the [[Alaska Purchase]] in 1867, he intended it as the first step in a comprehensive plan to gain control of the entire northwest Pacific Coast. Seward was a firm believer in [[Manifest Destiny]], primarily for its commercial advantages to the U.S. Seward expected [[British Columbia]] to seek annexation to the U.S. and thought Britain might accept this in exchange for the ''Alabama'' claims. Soon other elements endorsed annexation, Their plan was to annex [[British Columbia]], [[Red River Colony]] (Manitoba), and [[Nova Scotia]], in exchange for the dropping the damage claims. The idea reached a peak in the spring and summer of 1870, with American expansionists, Canadian separatists, and British anti-imperialists seemingly combining forces. The plan was dropped for multiple reasons. London continued to stall, American commercial and financial groups pressed Washington for a quick settlement of the dispute on a cash basis, growing Canadian nationalist sentiment in British Columbia called for staying inside the British Empire, Congress became preoccupied with Reconstruction, and most Americans showed little interest in territorial expansion. The &quot;[[Alabama Claims]]&quot; dispute went to international arbitration. In one of the first major cases of arbitration, the tribunal in 1872 supported the American claims and ordered Britain to pay $15.5 million. Britain paid and the episode ended in peaceful relations.&lt;ref&gt;Doris W. Dashew, &quot;The Story Of An Illusion: The Plan To Trade 'Alabama' Claims For Canada,&quot; ''Civil War History,'' Dec 1969, Vol. 15 Issue 4, pp 332-348&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David E.  Shi, &quot;Seward'S Attempt to Annex British Columbia, 1865-1869,&quot; ''Pacific Historical Review,'' May 1978, Vol. 47 Issue 2, pp 217-238&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dominion of Canada===
[[Image:Mountie and Trooper 1941.jpg|thumb|left|A Canadian [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Mountie]] and an American [[Maine State Police|state trooper]] on their respective sides of the [[Maine]] - [[Quebec]] border in 1941]]
Canada became a self-governing dominion in 1867 in internal affairs while Britain controlled diplomacy and defense policy. Prior to Confederation, there was an [[Oregon boundary dispute]] in which the Americans claimed the 54th degree latitude. That issue was resolved by splitting the disputed territory; the northern half became British Columbia, and the southern half the states of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]]. Strained relations with America continued {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, however, due to a series of small-scale armed incursions named the [[Fenian raids]] by [[Irish American|Irish-American]] [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veterans across the border from 1866 to 1871 in an attempt to trade Canada for Irish independence. The American government, angry at Canadian tolerance of Confederate raiders during the American Civil War, moved very slowly to disarm the [[Fenians]]. The British government, in charge of diplomatic relations, protested cautiously, as Anglo-American relations were tense. Much of the tension was relieved as the Fenians faded away and in 1872 by the settlement of the [[Alabama Claims]], when Britain paid the U.S. $15.5 million for war losses caused by warships built in Britain and sold to the Confederacy.

Disputes over ocean boundaries on [[Georges Bank]] and over fishing, whaling, and sealing rights in the Pacific were settled by international arbitration, setting an important precedent.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Alaska boundary===
Much more controversial was the [[Alaska boundary dispute]], settled in favor of the United States in 1903. At issue was the exact boundary between Alaska and Canada, specifically whether Canada would have a port near the present American town of [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]] that would give access to the new Yukon goldfields. The dispute was settled by arbitration, and the British delegate voted with the Americans—to the astonishment and disgust of Canadians who suddenly realized that Britain considered its relations with the United States paramount compared to those with Canada.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Munro, &quot;English-Canadianism and the Demand for Canadian Autonomy: Ontario's Response to the Alaska Boundary Decision, 1903.&quot; ''Ontario History'' 1965 57(4): 189-203. Issn: 0030-2953&lt;/ref&gt;

1907 saw a minor controversy over [[USS Nashville (PG-7)|USS ''Nashville'']] sailing into the Great Lakes via Canada without Canadian permission. Partly in response, in 1909 the two sides signed the [[International Boundary Waters Treaty]] and the [[International Joint Commission]] was established to manage the Great Lakes.

Economic ties and migration had deepened by this era, but were not equal. In 1901 there were 128,000 American-born residents in Canada (3.5% of the Canadian population) and 1.18 million Canadian-born residents in the United States (1.6% of the U.S. population).&lt;ref&gt;J. Castell Hopkins, ''The Canadian Annual Review of Public Affairs: 1902'' (1903), p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian autonomy===
Canada demanded and received permission from London to send its own delegation to the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Peace Talks]] in 1919, with the proviso that it sign the treaty under the British Empire. Canada subsequently took responsibility for its own foreign and military affairs in the 1920s. Its first ambassador to the United States, [[Vincent Massey]], was named in 1927. Canada became an active member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], the [[League of Nations]], and the [[Permanent Court of International Justice|World Court]], none of which included the U.S.

Relations with the United States were cordial until 1930, when Canada vehemently protested the new [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] by which the U.S. raised tariffs (taxes) on products imported from Canada. Canada retaliated with higher tariffs of its own against American products, and moved toward more trade within the British Commonwealth. U.S.-Canadian trade fell 75% as the [[Great Depression]] dragged both countries down.&lt;ref&gt;Richard N. Kottman, &quot;Herbert Hoover and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff: Canada, A Case Study,&quot; ''Journal of American History'', Vol. 62, No. 3 (Dec., 1975), pp. 609-635 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2936217 in JSTOR]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith McDonald et al, &quot;Trade Wars: Canada's Reaction to the Smoot-Hawley Tariff&quot;, (1997) ''Journal of Economic History'' 57 (4): 802–826. doi:10.2307/2951161&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, Canada developed [[Defence Scheme No. 1]] for an attack on American cities and for forestalling invasion by the United States until [[British Empire|Imperial]] reinforcements arrive. Through the later 1920s and 1930s, the [[United States Army War College]] developed a plan for a war with the [[British Empire]] waged largely on North American territory, in [[War Plan Red]]. Canadian defence was organized against an American invasion until the onset of [[World War II]].

===World War II===
The two nations cooperated closely in World War II,&lt;ref&gt;Galen Roger Perras, ''Franklin Roosevelt and the Origins of the Canadian-American Security Alliance, 1933-1945'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; as both nations saw new levels of prosperity and a determination to defeat the Axis powers. Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] were determined not to repeat the mistakes of their predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jensen, &quot;Nationalism and Civic Duty in Wartime: Comparing World Wars in Canada and America,&quot; ''Canadian Issues / Thèmes Canadiens,'' Dec 2004, pp 6-10&lt;/ref&gt; They met in August 1940 at Ogdensburg, issuing a declaration calling for close cooperation, and formed the [[Permanent Joint Board on Defence]] (PJBD).

King sought to raise Canada's international visibility by hosting the August 1943 [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quadrant conference]] in Quebec on military and political strategy; he was a gracious host but was kept out of the important meetings by [[Winston Churchill]] and Roosevelt.

Canada allowed the construction of the [[Alaska Highway]] and participated in the building of the atomic bomb. 49,000 Americans joined the RCAF (Canadian) or RAF (British) air forces through the [[Clayton Knight Committee]], which had Roosevelt's permission to recruit in the U.S. in 1940-42.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Lea Heide, &quot;Allies in Complicity: The United States, Canada, and the Clayton Knight Committee's Clandestine Recruiting of Americans for the Royal Canadian Air Force, 1940-1942,&quot; ''Journal of the Canadian Historical Association, 2004'', Vol. 15, pp 207-230&lt;/ref&gt;

American attempts in the mid 1930s to integrate British Columbia into a united West Coast military command had aroused Canadian opposition. Fearing a Japanese invasion of Canada's vulnerable coast, American officials urged the creation of a united military command for an eastern Pacific Ocean [[Theater (warfare)|theater of war]]. Canadian leaders feared American imperialism and the loss of autonomy more than a Japanese invasion. In 1941, Canadians successfully argued within the PJBD for mutual cooperation rather than unified command for the West Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Galen Roger Perras, &quot;Who Will Defend British Columbia? Unity of Command on the West Coast, 1934-1942,&quot; ''Pacific Northwest Quarterly,'' Spring 1997, Vol. 88 Issue 2, pp 59-69&lt;/ref&gt;

====Newfoundland====
The United States built large military bases in [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], at the time a British crown colony. The American involvement ended the depression and brought new prosperity; Newfoundland's business community sought closer ties with the United States as expressed by the [[Economic Union Party]]. Ottawa took notice and wanted Newfoundland to join Canada, which it did after hotly contested referenda. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} There was little demand in the United States for the acquisition of Newfoundland, so the United States did not protest the British decision not to allow an American option on the [[Newfoundland referendums, 1948|Newfoundland referendum]].

===Cold War===
Following co-operation in the two World Wars, Canada and the United States lost much of their previous animosity. As Britain's influence as a global imperial power declined, Canada and the United States became extremely close partners. Canada was a close ally of the United States during the [[Cold War]].

===Nixon Shock 1971===
[[File:American President Nixon address joint session of the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa 1972.JPG|thumb|left|Richard Nixon addresses a [[joint session (Canada)|joint session]] of the Parliament of Canada, 1972.]]
The United States had become Canada's largest market, and after the war the Canadian economy became dependent on smooth trade flows with the United States so much that in 1971 when the United States enacted the &quot;[[Nixon Shock]]&quot; economic policies (including a 10% tariff on all imports) it put the Canadian government into a panic. This led in a large part to the articulation of Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau|Trudeau]]'s &quot;[[Third Option]]&quot; policy of diversifying Canada's trade and downgrading the importance of Canada – United States relations. In a 1972 speech in Ottawa, Nixon declared the &quot;special relationship&quot; between Canada and the United States dead.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Muirhead, &quot;From Special Relationship to Third Option: Canada, the U.S., and the Nixon Shock,&quot; ''American Review of Canadian Studies,'' Vol. 34, 2004 [http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5008438189 online edition]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Issues of Americanization===
Since the arrival of the Loyalists as refugees from the American Revolution in the 1780s, historians have identified a constant theme of Canadian fear of Americanization. In the War of 1812, for example, the enthusiastic response by French militia to defend Lower Canada reflected, according to Heidler and Heidler (2004), &quot;the fear of Americanization.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Stephen Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler, ''Encyclopedia of the War of 1812'' (2004) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have traced this attitude over time in Ontario and Québec.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Granatstein, ''Yankee Go Home: Canadians and Anti-Americanism'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Looking at television, Collins (1990) finds that it is in English Canada that fear of cultural Americanization is most powerful, for there the attractions of the U.S. are strongest.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Collins, ''Culture, communication, and national identity: the case of Canadian television'' (U. of Toronto Press, 1990) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Meren (2009) argues that after 1945, the emergence of Québec nationalism and the desire to preserve French-Canadian cultural heritage led to growing anxiety regarding American cultural imperialism and Americanization.&lt;ref&gt;David Meren,  &quot;'Plus que jamais nécessaires': Cultural Relations, Nationalism and the State in the Canada-Québec-France Triangle, 1945-1960,&quot; ''Journal of the Canadian Historical Association,'' 2009, Vol. 19 Issue 1, pp 279-305,&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times surveys have shown that 60 percent of Quebecers have a fear of Americanization, while other surveys show they preferred their current situation to that of the Americans in the realms of health care, quality of life as seniors, environmental quality, poverty, educational system, racism and standard of living. While agreeing that job opportunities are greater in America, 89 percent disagreed with the notion that they would rather be in the United States, and they were more likely to feel closer to English Canadians than to Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated114&quot;&gt;Paula Ruth Gilbert, ''Violence and the female imagination: Quebec's women writers'' (2006) p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is evidence that the elites and Québec are much less fearful of Americanization, and much more open to economic integration than the general public.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated114&quot;/&gt;

==Relations between political executives==
The executive of each country is represented differently. In the United States, the president is both head of state and head of government, and his &quot;administration&quot; is the executive. In Canada the prime minister is head of government only, and his or her &quot;government&quot; or &quot;ministry&quot; directs the executive.

&lt;!-- leaders should go in the alphabetic order of their surnames in the titles, for neutrality's sake --&gt;

===Mulroney and Reagan===
[[Image:Mulroney reagan.jpg|thumb|right|The Mulroneys with President and Mrs. Reagan in Quebec, Canada, 18 March 1985, the day after the two leaders famously sang &quot;When Irish Eyes are Smiling&quot;.]]
Relations between [[Brian Mulroney]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] were famously close, on both a personal and political level {{POV-statement|date=May 2011}}. Personally this was illustrated during the 1985 &quot;[[Shamrock Summit]]&quot; where the two men, both of [[Irish people|Irish]] extraction, sang a duet of &quot;[[When Irish Eyes are Smiling]]&quot; during a formal banquet. Politically it resulted in negotiations on a potential free trade agreement, and a treaty of acid rain causing emissions, both major policy goals of Mulroney, that would be finalized under the presidency of [[George H. W. Bush]].

===Chrétien and Clinton===
Although [[Jean Chrétien]] was wary to appearing too close to the president, personally, he and [[Bill Clinton]] were known to be golfing partners. Their governments had many small trade quarrels over magazines, softwood lumber, and so on, but on the whole were quite friendly. Both leaders had run on reforming or abolishing [[NAFTA]], but the agreement went ahead with the addition of environmental and labor side agreements. Crucially, the Clinton administration lent rhetorical support to Canadian unity during the [[1995 referendum in Quebec]] on independence from Canada.

===Bush and Chrétien===
[[File:Chretien and Bush shaking hands Sept 9 2002.jpg|thumb|left|Jean Chrétien and George Bush shake hands at a meeting in Detroit in 2002.]]
Relations between Chrétien and [[George W. Bush]] were strained throughout their overlapping times in office. Jean Chrétien publicly mused that U.S. foreign policy might be part of the &quot;root causes&quot; of terrorism {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} shortly after [[Attacks of September 11, 2001|the September 11 attacks]], earning criticism in the United States, at a time when sensitivity regarding criticism of the U.S. ran high. Chrétien's public refusal to support the 2003 Iraq war was met with chagrin in the United States, especially among conservatives. [[List of nicknames used by George W. Bush|Bush's nickname]] for Chrétien was &quot;Dino&quot;, an apparently unflattering reference to Chrétien's age.

[[File:President George W. Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin 2004.jpg|thumb|right|President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Paul Martin respond to questions from the press corps in the Rose Garden after a meeting at the White House on April 30, 2004.]]

===Bush and Harper===
[[Stephen Harper]] and George W. Bush were thought to share warm personal relations and also close ties between their administrations. Because Bush was so unpopular in Canada, however, this was rarely emphasized by the Harper government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2009/02/05/f-pms-presidents.html | work=CBC News | title=Prime ministers and presidents | date=2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after being congratulated by Bush for his victory in February 2006, Harper rebuked U.S. ambassador to Canada [[David Wilkins]] for criticizing the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives']] plans to assert Canada's sovereignty over the [[Arctic Ocean]] waters with military force. Harper's first meeting with the president occurred at the end of March 2006, and while little was achieved in the way of solid agreements, the trip was described in the media as signalling a trend of closer relations between the two nations.

===Harper and Obama===
President Obama's first international trip was to Canada on February 19, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090128/canada_obama_090128/20090128?hub=Politics |title=Obama to visit Canada Feb. 19, PMO confirms - CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |date=2009-01-28 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from Canadian lobbying against &quot;Buy American&quot; provisions in the U.S. [[2009 stimulus bill|stimulus package]], relations between the two administrations had been smooth up to 2011. On February 4, 2011, Harper and Obama issued a &quot;Declaration on a Shared Vision for Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/02/04/joint-statement-president-obama-and-prime-minister-harper-canada-regul-0 |title=Joint Statement by President Obama and Prime Minister Harper of Canada on Regulatory Cooperation &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=3931 |title=PM and U.S. President Obama announce shared vision for perimeter security and economic competitiveness between Canada and the United States - Prime Minister of Canada |publisher=Pm.gc.ca |date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two leaders also announced the creation of a Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC) between the United States and Canada. Critics of the plan have compared it to the [[Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America|SPP]], without Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gabriel |first=Dana |url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=GAB20110206&amp;articleId=23109 |title=The Integration of Canada and the USA: &quot;The Security Perimeter&quot; Derogates National Sovereignty |publisher=Globalresearch.ca |date=2011-02-06 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military and security==
[[Image:NORADCommandCenter.jpg|thumb|[[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD), long headquartered in the [[Cheyenne Mountain]] Operations Center in Colorado, exemplifies military co-operation between Canada and the U.S.]]
The Canadian military, like forces of other NATO countries, fought along side the United States in most major conflicts since [[World War II]], including the [[Korean War]], the [[Gulf War]], the [[Kosovo War]], and most recently the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]]. The main exceptions to this were the Canadian government's opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Iraq War]], which caused some brief diplomatic tensions. Despite these issues, military relations have remained close.

American defense arrangements with Canada are more extensive than with any other country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2089.htm Background note on Canada], U.S. State Department&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Permanent Joint Board of Defense]], established in 1940, provides policy-level consultation on bilateral defense matters. The United States and Canada share [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) mutual security commitments. In addition, American and Canadian military forces have cooperated since 1958 on continental air defense within the framework of the [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD). There is also an active military exchange program between the two countries under which [[Canadian Forces]] personnel have been involved in Iraq.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Moreover, interoperability with the American armed forces has been a guiding principle of Canadian military force structuring and doctrine since the end of the Cold War. Canadian navy frigates, for instance, integrate seamlessly into American carrier battle groups.

===War in Afghanistan===
{{Main|Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan}}
Canada's elite [[JTF2]] unit joined American special forces in Afghanistan shortly after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|al-Qaida attacks on September 11, 2001]]. Canadian forces joined the multinational coalition in [[Operation Anaconda]] in January 2002. On April 18, 2002, an American pilot [[Tarnak Farm incident|bombed Canadian forces involved in a training exercise]], killing four and wounding eight Canadians. A joint American-Canadian inquiry determined the cause of the incident to be pilot error, in which the pilot interpreted ground fire as an attack; the pilot ignored orders that he felt were &quot;second-guessing&quot; his field tactical decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;friendly fire cbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news

The [[New Democratic Party]] and some recent Liberal leadership candidates have expressed opposition to Canada's expanded role in the Afghan conflict on the ground that it is inconsistent with Canada's historic role (since the [[Second World War]]) of peacekeeping operations. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===2003 Invasion of Iraq===
{{See also|Canada and the Iraq War|Canada and Iraq War resisters}}

According to contemporary polls, the majority of Canadians were opposed to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

==Trade==
{{Main|Canada – United States trade relations}}
Canada and the United States have the world's largest trading relationship, with huge quantities of goods and people flowing across the border each year. Since the 1987 [[Canadian–American Free Trade Agreement]], there have been no [[tariff]]s on most goods passed between the two countries.

With such a massive trading relationship, trade disputes between the two countries are frequent and inevitable{{POV-statement|date=March 2011}}. In the course of the [[United States – Canada softwood lumber dispute|softwood lumber dispute]], the U.S. has placed tariffs on Canadian [[softwood lumber]] because of what it argues is an unfair Canadian government subsidy, a claim which Canada disputes. The dispute has cycled through several agreements and arbitration cases. Other notable disputes include the [[Canadian Wheat Board]], and Canadian cultural &quot;restrictions&quot; on magazines and television (See [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], and [[National Film Board of Canada]]). Canadians have been criticized about such things as the ban on [[beef]] since a case of [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|Mad Cow disease]] was discovered in 2003 in cows from the United States (and a few subsequent cases) and the high American agricultural subsidies. Concerns in Canada also run high over aspects of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) such as Chapter 11.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

One ongoing and complex trade issue involves the importation of cheaper [[prescription drugs]] from Canada to the United States. Due to the Canadian government's [[price controls]] as part of their state-run medical system, prices for prescription drugs can be a fraction of the price paid by consumers in the unregulated American market. While laws in the United States have been passed at the national level against such sales, specific state and local governments have passed their own legislation to allow the trade to continue. American drug companies—often supporters of political campaigns—have come out against the practice.

==Environmental issues==
The two countries work closely to resolve trans-border environmental issues, an area of increasing importance in the bilateral relationship.

A principal instrument of this cooperation is the [[International Joint Commission]] (IJC), established as part of the [[Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909]] to resolve differences and promote international cooperation on boundary waters. The [[Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement]] of 1972 is another historic example of joint cooperation in controlling trans-border water pollution.&lt;ref&gt;http://ottawa.usembassy.gov/content/textonly.asp?section=can_usa&amp;document=environment&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been some disputes. Most recently, the [[Devil's Lake (North Dakota)|Devil's Lake]] Outlet, a project instituted by North Dakota, has angered Manitobans who fear that their water may soon become polluted as a result of this project.

Beginning in 1986 the Canadian government of Brian Mulroney began pressing the Reagan administration for an &quot;Acid Rain Treaty&quot; in order to do something about U.S. industrial air pollution causing [[acid rain]] in Canada. The Reagan administration was hesitant, and questioned the science behind Mulroney's claims. However, Mulroney was able prevail. The product was the signing and ratification of the [[Air Quality Agreement]] of 1991 by the first Bush administration. Under that treaty, the two governments consult semi-annually on trans-border air pollution, which has demonstrably reduced acid rain, and they have since signed an annex to the treaty dealing with [[ground level ozone]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progsregs/usca/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ec.gc.ca/air/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=83930AC3-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/02/04/exclusive-interview-brian-mulroney-remembers-his-friend-ronald-reagan/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-06/news/mn-139_1 | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=Kenneth | last1=Freed | first2=James | last2=Gerstenzang | date=1987-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, trans-border air pollution remains an issue, particularly in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence watershed during the summer. The main source of this trans-border pollution results from coal fired power stations, most of them located in the [[Midwestern United States]].

As part of the negotiations to create [[NAFTA]], Canada and the U.S. signed, along with Mexico, the [[North American Agreement On Environmental Cooperation]] which created the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]] which monitors environmental issues across the continent, publishing the [[North American Environmental Atlas]] as one aspect of its monitoring duties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cec.org/Page.asp?PageID=1226&amp;SiteNodeID=310&amp;BL_ExpandID=154&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently neither of the countries' governments support the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which set out time scheduled curbing of greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike the United States, Canada has ratified the agreement. Yet after ratification, due to internal political conflict within Canada, the Canadian government does not enforce the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and has received criticism from environmental groups and from other governments for its climate change positions. In January 2011, the [[Canadian minister of the environment]], [[Peter Kent]], explicitly stated that the policy of his government with regards to greenhouse gas emissions reductions is to wait for the United States to act first, and they try to harmonize with that action - a position that has been condemned by environmentalists and Canadian nationalists, and even government think-tanks.&lt;ref&gt;http://money.canoe.ca/money/business/canada/archives/2011/01/20110128-152706.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.climateprosperity.ca/eng/studies/canada-us/report/media-release-canada-us-report-eng.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illicit drugs==
{{main|Drug policy of the United States|Drug policy of Canada}}
In 2003 the American government became concerned when members of the Canadian government announced plans to [[decriminalization|decriminalize]] [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. David Murray, an assistant to U.S. [[Director of the National Drug Control Policy|Drug Czar]] [[John P. Walters]], said in a [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] interview that, &quot;We would have to respond. We would be forced to respond.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2003/05/02/us_pot_rxn030502.html |title=U.S. warns Canada against easing pot laws |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2003-05-02 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|election]] of the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] in early 2006 halted the liberalization of marijuana laws for the foreseeable future.

A 2007 joint report by American and Canadian officials on cross-border drug smuggling indicated that, despite their best efforts, &quot;drug trafficking still occurs in significant quantities in both directions across the border. The principal illicit substances smuggled across our shared border are MDMA (''Ecstasy''), cocaine, and marijuana.&quot; - &lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEEQFjAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.publicsafety.gc.ca%2Fprg%2Fle%2Foc%2F_fl%2Fus-canadian-report-drugs-eng.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=canada%20us%20drugs&amp;ei=iSt3TZf5LIL5rAGoj5nQCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNF5CuTgWgkB-iCub2ULWtobG5V1pQ&amp;sig2=mSL5oiAyYquZUMx9EWrXOA&amp;cad=rja&lt;/ref&gt; The report indicated that Canada was a major producer of ''Ecstasy'' and marijuana for the U.S. market, while the U.S. was a transit country for cocaine entering Canada.

==Arar affair==
{{Main|Maher Arar}}
On September 26, 2002, U.S. officials, acting upon a tip from Canadian law enforcement, detained [[Maher Arar]] on suspicion of terrorist links. Arar is a dual citizen of Canada and Syria and was traveling through New York as part of a trip from [[Tunisia]] to Canada.

Despite traveling on a Canadian passport, Arar was deported to Syria, his country of birth. He was imprisoned there for over a year and tortured repeatedly. The decision by U.S. officials to deport him to Syria, his imprisonment and torture there, and the extent of collaboration between U.S. and Canadian officials became a political issue in Canada at the time.

Canadian officials have since said that Arar was not linked in any way to terrorism, and the Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, has issued a formal apology and a $10.5 million (CAD) settlement to Arar, who nonetheless remains on an American terrorist watchlist.

==Diplomacy==

===Views over time of Presidents and Prime Ministers===
Presidents and prime ministers typically make formal or informal statements that indicate the diplomatic policy of their administration. Diplomats and journalists at the time—and historians since—dissect the nuances and tone to detect the warmth or coolness of the relationship.

* Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald]], speaking at the beginning of the [[Canadian federal election, 1891|1891 election]] (fought mostly over [[Reciprocity (Canadian politics)|Canadian free trade with the United States]]), denied Tory allegations that he wanted to amalgamate with the U.S. saying: &quot;As for myself, my course is clear. A [[British subject]] I was born—a British subject I will die. With my utmost effort, with my latest breath, will I oppose the ‘veiled treason’ which attempts by sordid means and mercenary proffers to lure our people from their allegiance.&quot; - , Feb 3, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Histor!ca [http://www.histori.ca/prodev/article.do;jsessionid=8D3831D48EE489EBCF46813C8427E685.tomcat1?id=15356 &quot;Election of 1891: A Question of Loyalty&quot;], James Marsh.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Prime Minister [[John Sparrow Thompson]], angry at failed trade talks in 1888, privately complained to his wife: &quot;These Yankee politicians are the lowest race of thieves in existence.&quot; - &lt;ref&gt;Donald Creighton, ''John A. Macdonald: The  Old Chieftain'' (1955) p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;

* After the World War II years of close military and economic cooperation, President [[Harry S. Truman]] said in 1947: &quot;Canada and the United States have reached the point where we can no longer think of each other as 'foreign' countries.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Council on Foreign Relations, ''Documents on American foreign relations'' (1957) Volume 9 p 558&lt;/ref&gt;

*President [[John F. Kennedy]] told Parliament in Ottawa in May 1961, with Canada a valued [[NATO]] ally: &quot;Geography has made us neighbours. History has made us friends. Economics has made us partners. And necessity has made us allies. Those whom nature hath so joined together, let no man put asunder.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John F. Kennedy. ''[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=8136 Address Before the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa]''. The American Presidency Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

* President [[Lyndon Johnson]] helped open Expo '67 with an upbeat theme appropriate to the occasion: &quot;We of the United States consider ourselves blessed. We have much to give thanks for. But the gift of providence we cherish most is that we were given as our neighbours on this wonderful continent the people and the nation of Canada.&quot; Remarks at [[Expo '67]], Montreal, May 25, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canada.usembassy.gov/content/textonly.asp?section=can_usa&amp;document=quotes |title=The Embassy of the U.S.A., Ottawa - United States - Canada Relations |publisher=Canada.usembassy.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] often called up the old metaphor that being America's neighbour, &quot;is like sleeping with an elephant. No matter how friendly and even-tempered the beast, if one can call it that, one is affected by every twitch and grunt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;From a speech by Trudeau to the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] in [[Washington, DC]], on March 25, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Granatstein and Robert Bothwell, ''Pirouette: Pierre Trudeau and Canadian Foreign Policy''(1991) p 51&lt;/ref&gt;

* Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]], sharply at odds with the U.S. over Cold War policy, warned at a press conference in 1971 that the overwhelming American presence posed &quot;a danger to our national identity from a cultural, economic and perhaps even military point of view.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Granatstein and Robert Bothwell, ''Pirouette: Pierre Trudeau and Canadian Foreign Policy''(1991) p 195&lt;/ref&gt;

* President [[Richard Nixon]], in a speech to Parliament in 1972 was angry at Trudeau, declared that the &quot;special relationship&quot; between Canada and the United States was dead. &quot;It is time for us to recognize,&quot; he stated, &quot;that we have very separate identities; that we have significant differences; and that nobody's interests are furthered when these realities are obscured.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Granatstein and Robert Bothwell, ''Pirouette: Pierre Trudeau and Canadian Foreign Policy''(1991) p 71&lt;/ref&gt;

* In late 2001, President George W. Bush neglected to mention Canada during a speech in which he thanked a list of countries who had assisted in responding to the events of [[September 11th]]. Canada had provided military, financial and other support, as well as aid for stranded travelers.

* Prime Minister Harper in a statement congratulating Barack Obama on his inauguration insisted there was indeed a &quot;special relationship,&quot; stating: &quot;The United States remains Canada’s most important ally, closest friend and largest trading partner and I look forward to working with President Obama and his administration as we build on this special relationship.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=3&amp;id=2391|title=Statemente by Prime Minister Stephen Harper|accessdate=2009-01-21|date=2009-01-20|publisher=Office of the Prime Minister of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* President Barack Obama speaking in [[Ottawa]], Ontario at his first official international visit February 19, 2009: &quot;I love this country. We could not have a better friend and ally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE51I7GY20090219 | work=Reuters | title=Obama declares love for Canada, banishes Bush era | date=February 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Territorial disputes===
{{See also|List of areas disputed by Canada and the United States}}

These include [[maritime boundary]] disputes:

*[[Dixon Entrance]]
*[[Beaufort Sea]]
*[[Strait of Juan de Fuca]]
*[[San Juan Islands]]
*[[Machias Seal Island]] and [[North Rock]]

Territorial land disputes:

*[[Aroostook War]] ([[Maine]] boundary)
*[[Alaska Boundary Dispute]]
*[[Pig War]]

and disputes over the international status of the:

*[[Northwest Passage]]
*[[Inside Passage]]

====Arctic disputes====
A long-simmering dispute between Canada and the U.S. involves the issue of Canadian sovereignty over the [[Northwest Passage]] (the sea passages in the Arctic). Canada’s assertion that the Northwest Passage represents internal (territorial) waters has been challenged by other countries, especially the U.S., which argue that these waters constitute an international strait (international waters). Canadians were incensed when Americans drove the reinforced oil tanker {{SS|Manhattan|1962|2}} through the Northwest Passage without Canadian permission in 1969, followed by the icebreaker [[USCGC Polar Sea (WAGB-11)|Polar Sea]] in 1985, which actually resulted in a [[1985 Polar Sea controversy|minor diplomatic incident]]. In 1970, the Canadian parliament enacted the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, which asserts Canadian regulatory control over pollution within a 100-mile zone. In response, the United States in 1970 stated, &quot;We cannot accept the assertion of a Canadian claim that the Arctic waters are internal waters of Canada…. Such acceptance would jeopardize the freedom of navigation essential for United States naval activities worldwide.&quot; A compromise of sorts was reached in 1988, by an agreement on &quot;Arctic Cooperation,&quot; which pledges that voyages of American icebreakers &quot;will be undertaken with the consent of the Government of Canada.&quot; However the agreement did not alter either country's basic legal position.  [[Paul Cellucci]], the American ambassador to Canada, in 2005 suggested to Washington that it should recognize the straits as belonging to Canada. His advice was rejected and Harper took opposite positions. The U.S. opposes Harper's proposed plan to deploy military icebreakers in the Arctic to detect interlopers and assert Canadian sovereignty over those waters.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Carnaghan, Allison Goody, [http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/prb0561-e.htm &quot;Canadian Arctic Sovereignty&quot;] (Library of Parliament: Political and Social Affairs Division, January 26, 2006); [http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/01/26/wilkins-harper060126.html 2006 news]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070817/qp_cellucci_070819/20070819?hub=Politics |title=Cellucci: Canada should control Northwest Passage |publisher=CTV.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christianity''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{polytonic|Χριστός}}, ''Khristos'', &quot;[[Christ]]&quot;, literally &quot;anointed one&quot;) is a [[Monotheism#Christian view|monotheistic]] [[religion]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Monotheism&quot;&gt;Christianity's status as monotheistic is affirmed in, amongst other sources, the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (article &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10499a.htm Monotheism]&quot;); [[William F. Albright]], ''From the Stone Age to Christianity''; [[H.

The name was given by the non-Jewish inhabitants of Antioch, probably in derision, to the disciples of Jesus. In the New Testament the names by which the disciples were known among themselves were &quot;brethren&quot;, &quot;the faithful&quot;, &quot;elect&quot;, &quot;saints&quot;, &quot;believers&quot;. The earliest recorded use of the term &quot;Christianity&quot; (Greek {{polytonic|Χριστιανισμός}}) was by [[Ignatius of Antioch]], around 100&amp;nbsp;AD. See Elwell/Comfort. ''Tyndale Bible Dictionary'', pp. 266, 828&lt;/ref&gt; 

Christianity teaches that Jesus is the [[Son of God]], [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God having become human]] and the [[Salvation|savior of humanity]]. Because of this, Christians commonly refer to [[Jesus]] as [[Christ]] or [[Messiah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Briggs&quot;&gt;

Christians believe that Jesus is the Messiah [[Bible prophecy|prophesied]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], referred to as the &quot;Old Testament&quot; in Christianity. The foundation of Christian [[theology]] is expressed in the early Christian [[ecumenical creeds]], which contain claims predominantly accepted by followers of the Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;Defined to avoid the ambiguous term &quot;orthodox&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Profession (religious)|professions]] state that Jesus suffered, died, was buried, and was [[resurrection|resurrected]] from the dead to open [[heaven]] to those who believe in him and trust him for the [[forgiveness#Christianity|remission]] of their [[sin]]s ([[salvation]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sheed, Frank. &quot;Theology and Sanity.&quot; (Ignatius Press: San Francisco, 1993), pp. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; They further maintain that Jesus bodily [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended]] into heaven where he rules and reigns with [[God the Father]]. Most [[Christian denomination|denominations]] teach that Jesus will [[Second Coming|return]] to [[Last Judgment|judge]] all humans, living and dead, and grant [[immortality|eternal life]] to his followers. He is considered the [[role model|model]] of a [[virtue|virtuous]] life, and both the [[revelation|revealer]] and physical [[incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] of [[God in Christianity|God]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath4&quot;&gt;McGrath, ''Christianity: An Introduction'', pp. 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Christians call the message of Jesus Christ [[Good news (Christianity)|the Gospel]] (&quot;good news&quot;) and hence refer to the earliest written accounts of his [[Ministry of Jesus|ministry]] as [[gospel]]s.

==Beliefs==
[[File:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|thumb|230px|right|The [[Sermon On the Mount]] by [[Carl Heinrich Bloch]], Danish painter, d. 1890.]]
{{Wikisource|Apostles Creed}}
{{Wikisource|Nicene Creed}}
Though there are many important differences of interpretation and opinion of the Bible on which Christianity is based, Christians share a set of beliefs that they hold as essential to their faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olsen&quot;&gt;Olson, ''The Mosaic of Christian Belief''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creeds===
{{Main|Creeds}}
Creeds (from Latin ''credo'' meaning &quot;I believe&quot;) are concise doctrinal statements or confessions, usually of religious beliefs. They began as baptismal formulae and were later expanded during the [[Christology|Christological]] controversies of the 4th and 5th centuries to become statements of faith.

The [[Apostles' Creed]] (''Symbolum Apostolorum'') was developed between the 2nd and 9th centuries. It is the most popular creed used in worship by Western Christians. Its central doctrines are those of the Trinity and God the Creator. Each of the doctrines found in this creed can be traced to statements current in the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic period]]. The creed was apparently used as a summary of Christian doctrine for baptismal candidates in the churches of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Pelikan/Hotchkiss, ''Creeds and Confessions of Faith in the Christian Tradition''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the Apostles Creed is still unaffected by the later Christological divisions, its statement of the articles of Christian faith remain largely acceptable to most Christian denominations:
* belief in [[God the Father]], [[Jesus Christ]] as the [[Son of God]] and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]
* the [[crucifixion of Jesus|death]], [[Harrowing of Hell|descent into hell]], [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], and [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]] of Christ
* the holiness of the [[Ecclesia (church)|Church]] and the [[communion of saints]]
* Christ's [[second coming]], the [[Day of Judgement]] and [[salvation]] of the faithful.

The [[Nicene Creed]], largely a response to [[Arianism]], was formulated at the Councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] and [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]] in 325 and 381 respectively&lt;ref&gt;Catholics United for the Faith, [http://www.cuf.org/faithfacts/details_view.asp?ffID=191 &quot;We Believe in One God&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Religion'', &quot;Arianism&quot;.{{Clarify|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ratified as the universal creed of [[Christendom]] by the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431.&lt;ref name=&quot;ephesus&quot;&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05491a.htm Council of Ephesus]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chalcedonian Creed]], developed at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451,&lt;ref&gt;[[History of Christianity|Christian History]] Institute, [http://web.archive.org/web/20080106201425/http://chi.gospelcom.net/DAILYF/2003/10/daily-10-08-2003.shtml ''First Meeting of the Council of Chalcedon''].&lt;/ref&gt; though rejected by the [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches,&lt;ref&gt;[[British Orthodox Church]], [http://www.britishorthodox.org/113e.php ''The Oriental Orthodox Rejection of Chalcedon'']&lt;/ref&gt; taught Christ &quot;to be acknowledged in two natures, inconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably&quot;: one divine and one human, and that both natures are perfect but are nevertheless [[Hypostatic union|perfectly united into one person]].&lt;ref&gt;Pope Leo I, [http://www.dailycatholic.org/history/4ecumen2.htm Letter to Flavian'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Athanasian Creed]], received in the western Church as having the same status as the Nicene and Chalcedonian, says: &quot;We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons nor dividing the [[Consubstantiality|Substance]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02033b.htm Athanasian Creed]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Christians ([[Roman Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Eastern Rite]] and [[Protestantism|Protestants]] alike) accept the use of creeds, and subscribe to at least one of the creeds mentioned above.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC—Our Common Heritage as Christians&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?mid=1806| title = Our Common Heritage as Christians |publisher = The United Methodist Church |accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[evangelical]] Protestants reject creeds as definitive statements of faith, even while agreeing with some creeds' substance. [[Baptists|The Baptists]] have been non-creedal “in that they have not sought to establish binding authoritative confessions of faith on one another.”

===Jesus Christ===
{{Main|Christian views of Jesus|Christology|Jesus Christ in comparative mythology}}
[[File:Vladimirskaya.jpg|thumb|230px|right|A depiction of Jesus as a child with his mother, Mary, the [[Theotokos of Vladimir]]. 12th century, [[Russia]].]]

The central tenet of Christianity is the belief in [[Jesus]] as the [[Son of God]] and the [[Messiah]] (Christ). The title &quot;Messiah&quot; comes from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word מָשִׁיחַ (''māšiáħ'') meaning ''anointed one''. The Greek translation {{polytonic|''Χριστός''}} (''Christos'') is the source of the English word &quot;[[Christ (title)|Christ]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath4&quot;/&gt; 

Christians believe that Jesus, as the Messiah, was [[anointing|anointed]] by God as savior of humanity, and hold that Jesus' coming was the fulfillment of [[Messianic prophecies of Jesus|messianic prophecies]] of the [[Old Testament]]. The Christian concept of the Messiah differs significantly from [[Jewish Messiah|the contemporary Jewish concept]]. The core Christian belief is that through belief in and acceptance of [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|the death and resurrection of Jesus]], [[original sin|sinful]] humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of [[Immortality|eternal life]].&lt;ref&gt;Metzger/Coogan, ''Oxford Companion to the Bible'', pp. 513, 649.&lt;/ref&gt;

While there have been many [[Christian theology|theological]] disputes over the [[Christology|nature of Jesus]] over the earliest centuries of Christian history, Christians generally believe that Jesus is [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]] and &quot;[[Hypostatic union|true God and true man]]&quot; (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, having become [[Incarnation (Christianity)|fully human]], suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, but did not [[sin]]. As fully God, he rose to life again. According to the [[Bible]], &quot;God raised him from the dead,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Acts|2:24}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|2:31-32}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:15}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:26}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|4:10}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|5:30}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|10:40-41}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:30}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:34}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:37}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|17:30-31}}, {{Bibleref2|Romans|10:9}}, {{bibleref2|1Cor|15:15||1 Cor. 15:15}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Cor|6:14}}, {{bibleref2|2Cor|4:14||2 Cor. 4:14}}, {{Bibleref2|Gal|1:1}}, {{Bibleref2|Eph|1:20}}, {{Bibleref2|Col|2:12}}, {{bibleref2|1Thess|1:10||1 Thess. 11:10}}, {{Bibleref2|Heb.|13:20}}, {{bibleref2|1Pet|1:3||1 Pet. 1:3}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Pet|1:21}}&lt;/ref&gt; he [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascended]] to heaven, is &quot;seated at the right hand of the Father&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed |title=Nicene Creed—Wikisource |publisher=En.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will ultimately return{{bibleref2c|Acts|1:9-11}} to fulfill the rest of [[Messianic prophecy]] such as the [[Resurrection of the dead]], the [[Last Judgment]] and final establishment of the [[Kingdom of God]].

According to the [[Gospel]]s of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], Jesus was [[Incarnation (Christianity)|conceived]] by the [[Holy Spirit]] and [[Nativity of Jesus|born]] from [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|the Virgin Mary]]. Little of Jesus' childhood is recorded in the canonical Gospels, however [[infancy Gospels]] were popular in antiquity. In comparison, his adulthood, especially the week before his death, is well documented in the Gospels contained within the [[New Testament]]. The Biblical accounts of Jesus' ministry include: [[Baptism of Jesus|his baptism]], [[Miracles attributed to Jesus|miracles]], preaching, [[Ministry of Jesus|teaching, and deeds]].

===Death and resurrection of Jesus===
{{Main|Crucifixion of Jesus|Resurrection of Jesus}}

Christians consider the resurrection of Jesus to be the cornerstone of their faith (see [[1 Corinthians 15]]) and the most important event in human history.&lt;ref&gt;Hanegraaff. ''Resurrection: The Capstone in the Arch of Christianity''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among Christian beliefs, the death and resurrection of Jesus are two core events on which much of Christian doctrine and theology is based.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACU-Death &amp; Resurrection&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/research/theology/Walsh.htm| title = The Significance of the Death and Resurrection of Jesus for the Christian|publisher = Australian Catholic University National|accessdate = 2007-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Got Questions-Death &amp; Resurrection&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gotquestions.org/resurrection-Christ-important.html| title = Why is the resurrection of Jesus Christ important?|publisher = Got Questions Ministries|accessdate = 2007-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the New Testament Jesus was [[Crucifixion|crucified]], died a physical death, was buried within a tomb, and rose from the dead three days later.{{bibleref2c|Jn.|19:30–31}} {{bibleref2c|Mk.|16:1}} {{bibleref2c-nb|Mark|16:6}} The New Testament mentions several [[resurrection appearances of Jesus]] on different occasions to his [[twelve apostles]] and [[disciple (Christianity)|disciples]], including &quot;more than five hundred brethren at once,&quot;{{bibleref2c|1Cor||15:6|1 Cor. 15:6}} before Jesus' [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] to heaven. Jesus' death and resurrection are commemorated by Christians in all worship services, with special emphasis during [[Holy Week]] which includes [[Good Friday]] and [[Easter]] Sunday.

The death and resurrection of Jesus are usually considered the most important events in [[Christian Theology]], partly because they demonstrate that Jesus has power over life and death and therefore has the authority and power to give people [[eternal life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2||John|3:16}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|5:24}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|6:39–40}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|6:47}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|10:10}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|11:25–26}}, and {{bibleref2-nb|John|17:3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian churches accept and teach the New Testament account of the resurrection of Jesus with very few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;This is drawn from a number of sources, especially the early Creeds, the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', certain theological works, and various Confessions drafted during the Reformation including the ''Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England'', works contained in the ''Book of Concord''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scholars use the belief of Jesus' followers in the resurrection as a point of departure for establishing the continuity of the [[historical Jesus]] and the proclamation of the [[early church]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, ''The Foundations of New Testament Christology'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Christians]] do not accept a literal bodily resurrection,&lt;ref&gt;A [[Jesus Seminar]] conclusion: &quot;in the view of the Seminar, he did not rise bodily from the dead; the resurrection is based instead on [[vision hypothesis|visionary experiences]] of [[Simon Peter|Peter]], [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], and [[Mary Magdalene|Mary]].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Funk. ''The Acts of Jesus: What Did Jesus Really Do?''.&lt;/ref&gt; seeing the story as richly symbolic and spiritually nourishing [[mythology|myth]]. Arguments over death and resurrection claims occur at many religious [[debate]]s and [[interfaith|interfaith dialogues]].&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzen. ''Resurrection, Discipleship, Justice: Affirming the Resurrection Jesus Christ Today'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul the Apostle]], an early Christian convert and missionary, wrote, &quot;If Christ was not raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your trust in God is useless.&quot;{{bibleref2c|1Cor|15:14||1 Cor. 15:14}} &lt;ref&gt;Ball/Johnsson (ed.). ''The Essential Jesus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salvation===
{{Main|Salvation}}

[[Paul of Tarsus]], like Jews and Roman pagans of his time, believed that sacrifice can bring about new kinship ties, purity, and eternal life.&lt;ref name=&quot;remedy&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eisenbaum |first=Pamela |year=2004 |month=Winter |title=A Remedy for Having Been Born of Woman: Jesus, Gentiles, and Genealogy in Romans

''What Saint Paul Really Said: Was Paul of Tarsus the Real Founder of Christianity?'' (Oxford, 1997), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The God who raised Jesus from the dead would also give new life to the &quot;mortal bodies&quot; of Gentile Christians, who had become with Israel the &quot;children of God&quot; and were therefore no longer &quot;in the flesh&quot;.{{bibleref2c|Rom.|8:9,11,16}} &lt;ref name=&quot;remedy&quot; /&gt;

Modern Christian churches tend to be much more concerned with how humanity can be [[eternal salvation|saved]] from a universal condition of sin and death than the question of how both Jews and Gentiles can be in God's family. According to both Catholic and Protestant doctrine, salvation comes by Jesus' [[substitutionary atonement|substitutionary death and resurrection]]. The Catholic Church teaches that salvation does not occur without faithfulness on the part of Christians; converts must live in accordance with principles of love and ordinarily must be baptized.&lt;ref&gt;CCC 846; Vatican II, Lumen Gentium 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See quotations from Council of Trent on Justification at [http://www.justforcatholics.org/a14.htm Justforcatholics.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Luther taught that baptism was necessary for salvation, but modern Lutherans and other Protestants tend to teach that salvation is a gift that comes to an individual by [[Divine grace|God's grace]], sometimes defined as &quot;unmerited favor&quot;, even apart from baptism.

Christians differ in their views on the extent to which individuals' salvation is pre-ordained by God. Reformed theology places distinctive emphasis on grace by teaching that individuals are [[total depravity|completely incapable of self-redemption]], but that [[irresistible grace|sanctifying grace is irresistible]].&lt;ref&gt;Westminster Confession, [http://www.pcanet.org/general/cof_chapvi-x.htm#chapx Chapter X]; Spurgeon, ''[http://www.spurgeon.org/calvinis.htm A Defense of Calvinism]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast Catholics, Orthodox Christians and [[Arminianism|Arminian]] Protestants believe that the exercise of [[free will]] is necessary to have faith in Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a2.htm Grace and Justification]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trinity===
{{Main|Trinity}}
[[File:Abraham-And-The-Three-Angels.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Three angels hosted by Abraham by [[Ludovico Carracci]]: The three angels represent the [[Godhead (Christianity)|three persons]] of God.]]

''Trinity'' refers to the teaching that the one God comprises three distinct, eternally co-existing persons; the ''[[God the Father|Father]]'', the ''Son'' (incarnate in Jesus Christ), and the ''[[Holy Spirit]]''. Together, these three persons are sometimes called the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]],&lt;ref&gt;Kelly. ''Early Christian Doctrines''. pp. 87-90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander. ''New Dictionary of Biblical Theology''. p. 514f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGrath. ''Historical Theology''. p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; although there is no single term in use in Scripture to denote the unified Godhead.&lt;ref&gt;Metzger/Coogan. ''Oxford Companion to the Bible''. p. 782.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of the [[Athanasian Creed]], an early statement of Christian belief, &quot;the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, and yet there are not three Gods but one God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly. ''The Athanasian Creed''.&lt;/ref&gt; They are distinct from another: the Father has no source, the Son is begotten of the Father, and the Spirit proceeds from the Father. Though distinct, the three persons cannot be divided from one another in being or in operation.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford, &quot;Encyclopedia Of Christianity, pg1207&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Trinity]] is an essential doctrine of mainstream Christianity. &quot;Father, Son and Holy Spirit&quot; represents both the [[immanence]] and [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] of God. God is believed to be infinite and God's presence may be perceived through the actions of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit.&lt;!--ref supports entire paragraph --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler. ''World Religions: An Introduction for Students''. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this doctrine, God is not divided in the sense that each person has a third of the whole; rather, each person is considered to be fully God (see [[Perichoresis]]). The distinction lies in their relations, the Father being unbegotten; the Son being begotten of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and (in Western theology) [[Filioque|from the Son]]. Regardless of this apparent difference, the three 'persons' are each [[eternity|eternal]] and [[omnipotent]].

The word ''trias'', from which ''trinity'' is derived, is first seen in the works of [[Theophilus of Antioch]]. He wrote of &quot;the Trinity of God (the Father), His Word (the Son) and His Wisdom (Holy Spirit)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Theophilus of Antioch ''Apologia ad Autolycum'' II 15&lt;/ref&gt; The term may have been in use before this time. Afterwards it appears in [[Tertullian]].&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity''. p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian ''De Pudicitia'' chapter 21&lt;/ref&gt; In the following century the word was in general use. It is found in many passages of [[Origen]].&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trinitarians====
{{Main|Trinitarianism}}

''Trinitarianism'' denotes those Christians who believe in the concept of the ''[[Trinity]]''. Almost all Christian denominations and Churches hold Trinitarian beliefs. Although the words &quot;Trinity&quot; and &quot;Triune&quot; do not appear in the Bible, theologians beginning in the 3rd century developed the term and concept to facilitate comprehension of the New Testament teachings of God as Father, God as Jesus the Son, and God as the Holy Spirit. Since that time, Christian theologians have been careful to emphasize that Trinity does not imply three gods, nor that each member of the Trinity is one-third of an infinite God; Trinity is defined as one God in three Persons.&lt;ref&gt;Moltman, Jurgen. ''The Trinity and the Kingdom: The Doctrine of God.'' Tr. from German. Fortress Press, 1993. ISBN 0-8006-2825-X&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nontrinitarians====
{{Main|Nontrinitarianism}}

[[Nontrinitarianism]] refers to [[Christian theology|beliefs systems]] that reject the doctrine of the [[Trinity]]. They are a small minority of Christians. Various nontrinitarian views, such as [[adoptionism]] or [[modalism]], existed in early Christianity, leading to the disputes about [[Christology]].&lt;ref&gt;Harnack, ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma1.ii.iii.iii.html History of Dogma]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Nontrinitarianism later appeared again in the [[Gnosticism]] of the [[Cathars]] in the 11th through 13th centuries, in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 18th century, and in some groups arising during the [[Second Great Awakening]] of the 19th century.

===Scriptures===
{{Main|Bible|Development of the Christian Biblical canon}}

Christianity regards the Bible, a collection of [[Biblical canon|canonical]] books in two parts (the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]]), as the authoritative word of God. It is believed by Christians to have been written by human authors under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and therefore for many it is held to be the [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]] word of God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#II ''Inspiration and Truth of Sacred Scripture'' (§105-108)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Second Helvetic Confession, [http://web.archive.org/web/20071203120450/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/helvetic/c01.htm ''Of the Holy Scripture Being the True Word of God'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]], [http://www.reformed.org/documents/icbi.html ''online text'']&lt;/ref&gt; Jews, Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants each define separate lists of [[Books of the Bible]] that each considers canonical. These variations are a reflection of the range of [[traditions]] and [[Ecumenical council|councils]] that have convened on the subject. Every version of the complete Bible always includes books of the Jewish scriptures, the [[Tanakh]], and includes additional books and reorganizes them into two parts: the books of the Old Testament primarily sourced from the Tanakh (with some variations), and the 27 books of the New Testament containing books originally written primarily in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcusa.org/101/101-bible.htm |title=PC (USA)—Presbyterian 101—What is The Bible? |publisher=Pcusa.org |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Catholic and Orthodox canons include other books from the [[Septuagint]] which Roman Catholics call [[Deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanonical]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Canon&quot;&gt;Bruce, ''The Canon of Scripture''; ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#IV, &quot;The Canon of Scripture&quot;, § 120]&lt;/ref&gt; Protestants consider these books to be [[Biblical apocrypha|apocryphal]]. Some versions of the Christian Bible have a separate Apocrypha section for the books not considered canonical by some Churches or by the groups publishing them.&lt;ref&gt;Metzger/Coogan, ''Oxford Companion to the Bible''. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Catholic and Orthodox interpretations====
[[File:Inside Orthodox Church.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The inside of an [[Eastern Orthodox]] church]]
[[File:StPetersBasilicaEarlyMorning.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Saint Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]]]]
[[File:san peter church.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Inside of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]]]]
In antiquity, two schools of exegesis developed in [[Alexandria]] and [[School of Antioch|Antioch]]. Alexandrine interpretation, exemplified by [[Origen]], tended to read Scripture [[allegory|allegorically]], while Antiochene interpretation adhered to the literal sense, holding that other meanings (called ''[[theoria]]'') could only be accepted if based on the literal meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly. ''Early Christian Doctrines''. pp. 69-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholic Church|Catholic]] theology distinguishes two senses of scripture: the literal and the spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III, ''The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture'' § 115-118].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''literal'' sense of understanding scripture is the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture. The ''spiritual'' sense is further subdivided into:
* the ''allegorical'' sense, which includes [[Typology (theology)|typology]]. An example would be the [[Passage of the Red Sea|parting of the Red Sea]] being understood as a &quot;type&quot; (sign) of baptism.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|10:2||1 Cor. 10:2}}
* the ''[[moral]]'' sense, which understands the scripture to contain some ethical teaching.
* the ''[[anagoge|anagogical]]'' sense, which applies to [[eschatology]], eternity and the [[Apocalypse|consummation of the world]]

Regarding [[exegesis]], following the rules of sound interpretation, Catholic theology holds:
* the injunction that all other senses of sacred scripture are based on the ''literal''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/100110.htm &quot;Whether in Holy Scripture a word may have several senses&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church,'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III §116]&lt;/ref&gt;
* that the historicity of the Gospels must be absolutely and constantly held&lt;ref&gt;[[Second Vatican Council]], [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html ''Dei Verbum'' (V.19)].&lt;/ref&gt;
* that scripture must be read within the &quot;living Tradition of the whole Church&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III &quot;The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture&quot; § 113].&lt;/ref&gt; and
* that &quot;the task of interpretation has been entrusted to the bishops in communion with the successor of Peter, the [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church,'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a2.htm#III &quot;The Interpretation of the Heritage of Faith&quot; § 85].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protestant interpretation====
;Clarity of Scripture:Protestant Christians believe that the Bible is a self-sufficient revelation, the final authority on all Christian doctrine, and [[Revelation|revealed all truth]] necessary for salvation. This concept is known as ''[[sola scriptura]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mathison. ''The Shape of Sola Scriptura''.{{Clarify|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protestants characteristically believe that ordinary believers may reach an adequate understanding of Scripture because Scripture itself is clear (or &quot;perspicuous&quot;), because of the help of the Holy Spirit, or both. Martin Luther believed that without God's help Scripture would be &quot;enveloped in darkness.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Foutz&quot; /&gt; He advocated &quot;one definite and simple understanding of Scripture.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Foutz&quot;&gt;Foutz, [http://www.quodlibet.net/luther.shtml '' Martin Luther and Scripture''].&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Calvin]] wrote, &quot;all who...follow the Holy Spirit as their guide, find in the Scripture a clear light.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, [http://www.ccel.org/c/calvin/comment3/comm_vol45/htm/vii.iv.iv.htm '' Commentaries on the Catholic Epistles'' 2 Peter 3:14-18]&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Helvetic (Latin for &quot;Swiss&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mb-soft.com/believe/txh/helvconf.htm |title=The Second Helvetic Confession of Faith |publisher=Mb-soft.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confession, composed by the pastor of the Reformed church in Zurich (successor to Protestant reformer [[Zwingli]]) was adopted as a declaration of doctrine by most European Reformed churches.&lt;ref&gt;Second Helvetic Confession, [http://web.archive.org/web/20071211005549/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/helvetic/c02.htm ''Of Interpreting the Holy Scriptures; and of Fathers, Councils, and Traditions'']&lt;/ref&gt;

;Original intended meaning of Scripture:Protestants stress the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture, the [[historical-grammatical method]].&lt;ref&gt;Sproul. ''Knowing Scripture'', pp. 45-61; Bahnsen, ''[http://www.cmfnow.com/articles/pt173.htm A Reformed Confession Regarding Hermeneutics'' (article 6)].&lt;/ref&gt; The historical-grammatical method or grammatico-historical method is an effort in [[Biblical hermeneutics]] to find the intended original meaning in the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Some Protestant interpreters make use of typology.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., in his [http://eword.gospelcom.net/comments/matthew/mh/matthew1.htm commentary on Matthew 1] (§III.3) [[Matthew Henry]] interprets the twin sons of Judah, Phares and Zara, as an allegory of the Gentile and [[Jewish Christians]]. For a contemporary treatment, see Glenny, ''[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_typology_glenny.html Typology: A Summary Of The Present Evangelical Discussion]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afterlife and Eschaton===
{{Main|Christian eschatology}}

Most Christians believe that human beings experience divine judgment and are rewarded either with eternal life or [[hell|eternal damnation]]. This includes the [[Last Judgment|general judgement]] at the [[Resurrection of the dead]] (see below) as well as the belief (held by Roman Catholics,&lt;ref name=&quot;CEParticularJudgement&quot;&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08550a.htm Particular Judgment]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ott&quot;&gt;Ott, ''Grundriß der Dogmatik'', p. 566.&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox&lt;ref&gt;David Moser, ''[http://www.orthodox.net/articles/about-prayer-for-the-dead.html What the Orthodox believe concerning prayer for the dead]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ken Collins, ''[http://www.kencollins.com/question-45.htm What Happens to Me When I Die?]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and most Protestants) in a [[particular judgment|judgment particular to the individual soul]] upon physical death.

In Roman Catholicism, those who die in a state of grace, i.e., without any mortal sin separating them from God, but are still imperfectly purified from the effects of sin, undergo purification through the intermediate state of [[purgatory]] to achieve the holiness necessary for entrance into God's presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_04081999_en.html |title=Audience of 4 August 1999 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1999-08-04 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have attained this goal are called ''saints'' (Latin ''sanctus'', &quot;holy&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm The Communion of Saints]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians believe that the second coming of Christ will occur at the [[eschatology|end of time]]. All who have died will be [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrected bodily from the dead]] for the [[Last Judgment]]. Jesus will fully establish the [[Kingdom of God]] in fulfillment of [[Bible prophecy|scriptural prophecies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;res&quot;&gt;[[Thomas Aquinas]], [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/5.htm ''Summa Theologicum, Supplementum Tertiae Partis''] questions 69 through 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Calvin | first =John | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book Three, Ch. 25 | work = | publisher =www.reformed.org | date = | url =http://www.reformed.org/books/institutes/books/book3/bk3ch25.html | doi = | accessdate =2008-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jehovah's Witnesses deny the existence of hell. Instead, they hold that the souls of the wicked will be annihilated.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The death that Adam brought into the world is spiritual as well as physical, and only those who gain entrance into the Kingdom of God will exist eternally. However, this division will not occur until Armageddon, when all people will be resurrected and given a chance to gain eternal life. In the meantime, &quot;the dead are conscious of nothing.&quot;What is God's Purpose for the Earth?&quot; Official Site of Jehovah's Witnesses. ''Watchtower'', July 15, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship==
{{Main|Christian worship}}
[[File:Thebible33.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Samples of Christian religious objects—The [[Holy Bible]], a [[Crucifix]], and a [[Rosary]].]]
[[File:Bernhard Plockhorst - Good Shephard.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Jesus as the good shepherd by [[Bernhard Plockhorst]]]]

[[Justin Martyr]] described 2nd century Christian [[liturgy]] in his ''[[First Apology]]'' (''c''. 150) to [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Antoninus Pius]], and his description remains relevant to the basic structure of Christian liturgical worship:

{{quotation|And on the day called Sunday, all who live in cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read, as long as time permits; then, when the reader has ceased, the president verbally instructs, and exhorts to the imitation of these good things. Then we all rise together and pray, and, as we before said, when our prayer is ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president in like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings, according to his ability, and the people assent, saying [[Amen]]; and there is a distribution to each, and a participation of that over which thanks have been given, and to those who are absent a portion is sent by the deacons. And they who are well to do, and willing, give what each thinks fit; and what is collected is deposited with the president, who succours the orphans and widows and those who, through sickness or any other cause, are in want, and those who are in bonds and the strangers sojourning among us, and in a word takes care of all who are in need.|Justin Martyr&lt;ref name=justin&gt;Justin Martyr, [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-firstapology.html ''First Apology''] §LXVII&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, as Justin described, Christians assemble for communal worship on Sunday, the day of the resurrection, though other liturgical practices often occur outside this setting. Scripture readings are drawn from the Old and New Testaments, but especially the Gospels. Often these are arranged on an [[annual cycle]], using a book called a [[lectionary]]. Instruction is given based on these readings, called a [[sermon]], or homily. There are a variety of congregational [[prayer]]s, including thanksgiving, confession, and intercession, which occur throughout the service and take a variety of forms including recited, responsive, silent, or sung. The [[Lord's Prayer]], or Our Father, is regularly prayed. The [[Eucharist]] (called [[Holy Communion]], or the Lord's Supper) is the part of liturgical worship that consists of a consecrated meal, usually bread and wine. Justin Martyr described the Eucharist:

{{quotation|And this food is called among us ''Eukaristia'' [the Eucharist], of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins, and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined. For not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Saviour, having been made flesh by the Word of God, had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh.|Justin Martyr&lt;ref name=justin/&gt;}}

Some [[Christian denominations]] practice [[closed communion]]. They offer communion to those who are already united in that denomination or sometimes individual church. Catholics restrict participation to their members who are not in a state of [[mortal sin]]. Most other churches practice [[open communion]] since they view communion as a means to unity, rather than an end, and invite all believing Christians to participate.

Some groups depart from this traditional liturgical structure. A division is often made between &quot;[[High church|High]]&quot; [[church service]]s, characterized by greater solemnity and ritual, and &quot;[[Low church|Low]]&quot; services, but even within these two categories there is great diversity in forms of worship. [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] meet on Saturday, while others do not meet on a weekly basis. [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]] or [[Pentecostal]] congregations may spontaneously feel led by the Holy Spirit to action rather than follow a formal order of service, including spontaneous prayer. [[Society of Friends|Quakers]] sit quietly until moved by the Holy Spirit to speak. Some [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] services resemble concerts with [[Christian rock|rock and pop music]], dancing, and use of multimedia. For groups which do not recognize a priesthood distinct from ordinary believers the services are generally led by a [[minister of religion|minister]], [[preacher]], or [[pastor]]. Still others may lack any formal leaders, either in principle or by local necessity. Some churches use only [[a cappella]] music, either on principle (for example,, many [[Churches of Christ]] object to the use of instruments in worship) or by tradition (as in Orthodoxy).

Worship can be varied for special events like [[baptism]]s or weddings in the service or significant [[Calendar of saints|feast days]]. In the [[Early Christianity|early church]], Christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the Eucharistic part of the worship. In many churches today, adults and children will separate for all or some of the service to receive age-appropriate teaching. Such children's worship is often called [[Sunday school]] or [[Sabbath school]] (Sunday schools are often held before rather than during services).

===Sacraments===
{{Main|Sacrament}}
{{See also|Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Anglican sacraments|Lutheran sacraments}}

[[File:Fractio-panis1.JPG|right|thumb|230px|The [[Holy Eucharist]]]]

In Christian belief and practice, a '''sacrament''' is a [[rite]], instituted by Christ, that mediates [[divine grace|grace]], constituting a [[Sacred Mysteries|sacred mystery]]. The term is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''sacramentum'', which was used to translate the Greek word for ''mystery''. Views concerning both what rites are sacramental, and what it means for an act to be a sacrament vary among Christian denominations and traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC1435&quot;&gt;Cross/Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. p. 1435f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most conventional functional definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign, instituted by Christ, that conveys an inward, spiritual grace through Christ. The two most widely accepted sacraments are [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]], however, the majority of Christians recognize seven Sacraments or Divine Mysteries: Baptism, [[Confirmation (Christian sacrament)|Confirmation]] ([[Chrismation]] in the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] tradition), and the Eucharist, [[Holy Orders]], [[Confession|Reconciliation of a Penitent]] (confession), [[Anointing of the Sick]], and [[Christian views of marriage|Matrimony]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC1435&quot; /&gt; Taken together, these are the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Seven Sacraments]] as recognised by churches in the [[High church]] tradition—notably [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Independent Catholic Churches|Independent Catholic]], [[Old Catholic]] most [[Anglican sacraments|Anglicans]], and some [[Lutherans]]. Most other denominations and traditions typically affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments, while some Protestant groups, such as the Quakers, reject sacramental theology.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC1435&quot; /&gt; Most Protestant [[Christian denominations]] who believe these rites do not communicate grace prefer to call them ''[[Ordinance (Christian)|ordinances]]''.

===Liturgical calendar===
{{Main|Liturgical year}}

Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Eastern Christians, and traditional Protestant communities frame worship around a [[Liturgical year|liturgical calendar]]. This includes [[Holy Day of Obligation|holy days]], such as [[Solemnity|solemnities]] which commemorate an event in the life of Jesus or the [[saint]]s, periods of [[fasting]] such as [[Lent]], and other pious events such as [[memoria]] or lesser festivals commemorating saints. Christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations, such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and [[Pentecost]]. A few churches make no use of a liturgical calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Hickman. ''Handbook of the Christian Year''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbols===
[[File:Groblje Sv. Marko2.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Jesus on the Cross]]
[[File:Normandy American Cemetery.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Christian cemetery]]
{{Main|Christian symbolism}}

The [[Christian cross|cross]], which is today one of the most widely recognised symbols in the world, was used as a Christian symbol from the earliest times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-04/anf04-34.htm |title=ANF04. Fathers of the Third Century: Tertullian, Part Fourth; Minucius Felix; Commodian; Origen, Parts First and Second &amp;#124; Christian Classics Ethereal Library |publisher=Ccel.org |date=2005-06-01 |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minucius Felix speaks of the cross of Jesus in its familiar form, likening it to objects with a crossbeam or to a man with arms outstretched in prayer ([http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-04/anf04-34.htm#P5713_906729 Octavius of Minucius Felix], chapter XXIX).&lt;/ref&gt; Tertullian, in his book ''De Corona'', tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the sign of the cross.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;At every forward step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the sign.&quot; (Tertullian, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.iv.vi.iii.html ''De Corona'', chapter 3])&lt;/ref&gt; Although the cross was known to the early Christians, the [[crucifix]] did not appear in use until the 5th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;soc&quot;&gt;Dilasser. ''The Symbols of the Church''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the symbols employed by the primitive Christians, that of the fish seems to have ranked first in importance. From monumental sources such as tombs it is known that the symbolic fish was familiar to Christians from the earliest times. The fish was depicted as a Christian symbol in the first decades of the 2nd century.&lt;ref name=&quot;cefish&quot;&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06083a.htm Symbolism of the Fish]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity among Christians was due principally, it would seem, to the famous acrostic consisting of the initial letters of five Greek words forming the word for fish (Ichthys), which words briefly but clearly described the character of Christ and the claim to worship of believers: ''Iesous Christos Theou Yios Soter'', meaning, ''Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cefish&quot; /&gt;

Christians from the very beginning adorned their [[catacombs|tombs]] with paintings of Christ, of the saints, of scenes from the Bible and allegorical groups. The catacombs are the cradle of all Christian art. The first Christians had no prejudice against images, pictures, or statues. The idea that they must have feared the danger of idolatry among their new converts is disproved in the simplest way by the pictures, even statues, that remain from the 1st centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;ceimage&quot;&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07664a.htm Veneration of Images].&lt;/ref&gt; Other major Christian symbols include the [[Chrismon|chi-rho monogram]], the [[dove]] (symbolic of the Holy Spirit), the sacrificial lamb (symbolic of Christ's sacrifice), the [[vine]] (symbolising the necessary connectedness of the Christian with Christ) and many others. These all derive from writings found in the New Testament.&lt;ref name=&quot;soc&quot;/&gt;

===Baptism===
[[Baptism]] is the ritual act, with the use of water, by which a person is admitted to membership of the [[Christian Church|Church]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Through Baptism we are freed from sin and reborn as sons of God; we become members of Christ, are incorporated into the Church and made sharers in her mission&quot; ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3G.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1213]; &quot;Holy Baptism is the sacrament by which God adopts us as his children and makes us members of Christ's Body, the Church, and inheritors of the kingdom of God&quot; ([http://anglicansonline.org/basics/catechism.html#Holy Book of Common Prayer, 1979, Episcopal );] &quot;Baptism is the sacrament of initiation and incorporation into the body of Christ&quot; ([http://www.backriverumc.com/userFiles/1257/overview_of_baptism.pdf An United Methodist Understanding of Baptism);] &quot;As an initiatory rite into membership of the Family of God, baptismal candidates are symbolically purified or washed as their sins have been forgiven and washed away&quot; ([http://www.baptisthistory.org/pamphlets/baptism.htm [[William H. Brackney]], Believer's Baptism).]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prayer===
{{Main|Prayer in Christianity}}
Jesus' teaching on prayer in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] displays a distinct lack of interest in the external aspects of prayer. A concern with the techniques of prayer is condemned as 'pagan', and instead a simple trust in God's fatherly goodness is encouraged.{{bibleref2c|Mat.|6:5-15}} Elsewhere in the New Testament this same freedom of access to God is also emphasized.{{bibleref2c|Phil.|4:6}}{{bibleref2c|Jam.|5:13-19}} This confident position should be understood in light of Christian belief in the unique relationship between the believer and Christ through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBDprayer&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Alexander, T. D., &amp; Rosner, B. S |year=2001 |title =Prayer |encyclopedia= New Dictionary of Biblical Theology|publisher= Intervarsity Press |location=Downers Grove, IL |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent Christian traditions, certain physical gestures are emphasised, including medieval gestures such as [[genuflection]] or making the [[sign of the cross]]. [[Kneeling]], bowing and [[prostration]]s (see also [[poklon]]) are often practiced in more traditional branches of Christianity. Frequently in Western Christianity the hands are placed palms together and forward as in the feudal [[commendation ceremony]]. At other times the older [[orans]] posture may be used, with palms up and elbows in.

''Intercessory prayer'' is prayer offered for the benefit of other people. There are many intercessory prayers recorded in the Bible, included prayers of the [[Apostle Peter]] on behalf of sick persons{{bibleref2c|Acts|9:40}} and by [[prophet]]s of the Old Testament in favor of other people.{{bibleref2c|1Ki|17:19-22}} In the New Testament [[book of James]] no distinction is made between the intercessory prayer offered by ordinary believers and the prominent Old Testament prophet Elijah.{{bibleref2c|Jam|5:16-18}} The effectiveness of prayer in Christianity derives from the power of God rather than the status of the one praying&lt;ref name=&quot;NBDprayer&quot;/&gt;

The ancient church, in both [[Eastern Christianity]] and [[Western Christianity]], developed a tradition of asking for the [[intercession of saints|intercession of (deceased) saints]], and this remains the practice of most [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]], and some [[Anglican]] churches. Churches of the [[Protestant Reformation]] however rejected prayer to the saints, largely on the basis of the sole mediatorship of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |coauthors=Ferguson, S. B., &amp; Packer, J. |year=1988 |title =Saints |encyclopedia= New Dictionary of Theology|publisher= Intervarsity Press |location=Downers Grove, IL |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reformer [[Huldrych Zwingli]] admitted that he had offered prayers to the saints until his reading of the Bible convinced him that this was idolatrous.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Gray, ''The Protestant Reformation'', (Sussex Academic Press, 2003), page 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]: &quot;Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God or the requesting of good things from God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.va/archive/catechism/p4s1.htm |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church: Part Four - Christian Prayer |publisher=Va |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Common Prayer]] in the Anglican tradition is a guide which provides a set order for church services, containing set prayers, scripture readings, and hymns or sung Psalms.

{{Main|Early Christianity|First seven Ecumenical Councils}}

Christianity began as a [[Jewish]] sect in the eastern [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] in the mid-1st century.&lt;ref name=&quot;name&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Esler&quot;/&gt; Its earliest development took place under the leadership of the [[Twelve Apostles]], particularly [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle]], followed by the early [[bishop]]s, whom Christians considered the [[Apostolic Succession|successors of the Apostles]].

According to the scriptures, Christians were from the beginning subject to [[Persecution of Christians|persecution]] by some Jewish religious authorities, who disagreed with the apostles' teachings (See [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism]]). This involved punishments, including death, for Christians such as [[Stephen]]{{bibleref2c|Acts|7:59}} and [[James, son of Zebedee]].{{bibleref2c|Acts|12:2}} Larger-scale persecutions followed at the hands of the authorities of the Roman Empire, first in the year 64, when [[Emperor Nero]] blamed them for the [[Great Fire of Rome]]. According to Church tradition, it was under Nero's persecution that early Church leaders Peter and [[Paul of Tarsus]] were each martyred in Rome. Further widespread [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|persecutions]] of the Church occurred under nine subsequent Roman emperors, most intensely under [[Decius]] and [[Diocletian]]. From the year 150, Christian teachers began to produce theological and apologetic works aimed at defending the faith. These authors are known as the [[Church Fathers]], and study of them is called [[Patristics]]. Notable early Fathers include [[Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Polycarp]], [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], and [[Origen]].

State persecution ceased in the 4th century, when [[Constantine I]] issued an [[Edict of Milan|edict of toleration]] in 313. On 27 February 380, Emperor [[Theodosius I]] enacted a law establishing Christianity as the [[State church of the Roman Empire|official religion of the Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html Theodosian Code XVI.i.2], in: Bettenson. ''Documents of the Christian Church''. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; From at least the 4th century, Christianity has played a prominent role in the [[history of Western civilization|shaping of Western civilization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Orlandis&quot;&gt;Orlandis, ''A Short History of the Catholic Church'' (1993), preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine was also instrumental in the convocation of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, which sought to address the [[Arianism|Arian heresy]] and formulated the [[Nicene Creed]], which is still used by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Anglican Communion]], and many [[Protestant]] churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC—Our Common Heritage as Christians&quot;/&gt; Nicaea was the first of a series of [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical (worldwide) Councils]] which formally defined critical elements of the theology of the Church, notably concerning [[Christology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McManners37&quot;&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 37f.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Assyrian Church of the East]] did not accept the third and following Ecumenical Councils, and are still separate today. In 395, the most Christianized regions of the world were Crete, Cyprus, [[Anatolia]], [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], the Nile delta, and [[Numidia]] (present-day Tunisia and Algeria).&lt;ref&gt;Luc-Normand Tellier (2009). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Urban world history: an economic and geographical perspective]''&quot;. PUQ. p.198. ISBN 2760515885&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of Christianity in Africa began in the middle of the 1st century in [[Egypt]], and by the end of the 2nd century in the region around [[Carthage]]. Important Africans who influenced the early development of Christianity includes [[Tertullian]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Origen of Alexandria]], [[Cyprian]], [[Athanasius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]]. The later rise of [[Islam]] in [[North Africa]] reduced the size and numbers of Christian congregations, leaving only the [[Coptic Church]] in Egypt and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] in the [[Horn of Africa]]. The History of Christianity in Africa began in the 1st century when [[Mark the Evangelist]] started the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] in about 43&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], the author of ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' in the 4th century, states that St. Mark came to Egypt in the first or third year of the reign of Emperor Claudius, i.e. 41 or 43&amp;nbsp;AD. &quot;Two Thousand years of Coptic Christianity&quot; Otto F.A. Meinardus p28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethel.edu/~letnie/AfricanChristianity/WesternNorthAfricaHomepage.html Bethel.edu]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutreligion.org/history-of-christianity-in-africa-faq.htm |title=Allaboutreligion.org |publisher=Allaboutreligion.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Middle Ages===
With the decline and fall of the Roman Empire in the west, the [[papacy]] became a political player, first visible in [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo]]'s diplomatic dealings with [[Attila the Hun|Huns]] and [[Vandals]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Gonzalez-p238&quot;/&gt; The church also entered into a long period of missionary activity and expansion among the various tribes. Whilst arianists instituted the death penalty for practicing pagans (see [[Massacre of Verden]] as example), [[Catholicism]] also spread among the [[Germanic peoples]],&lt;ref name = &quot;Gonzalez-p238&quot;&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 238–42.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Slavic peoples]], the [[Hungarians]], and the [[Baltic peoples]].

Around 500, [[St. Benedict]] set out his [[Monastic Rule]], establishing a system of regulations for the foundation and running of [[monasteries]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Gonzalez-p238&quot;/&gt; [[Monasticism]] became a powerful force throughout Europe,&lt;ref name = &quot;Gonzalez-p238&quot;/&gt; and gave rise to many early centers of learning, most famously in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Gaul]], contributing to the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the 9th century.

From the 7th century onwards, [[Islam]] conquered the Christian lands of the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and much of [[Spain]],&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 248–50.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in oppression of Christianity and numerous military struggles, including the [[Crusades]], the Spanish [[Reconquista]] and wars against the [[Turkish people|Turks]].

The Middle Ages brought about major changes within the church. [[Pope Gregory the Great]] dramatically reformed [[Ecclesiastical polity|ecclesiastical structure]] and administration.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 244–47.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 8th century, [[iconoclasm]] became a divisive issue, when it was sponsored by the [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] emperors. The [[Second Council of Nicaea|Second Ecumenical Council of Nicaea]] (787) finally pronounced in favor of icons.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 10th century, western monasticism was further rejuvenated through the leadership of the great Benedictine monastery of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]].&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 278–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

===High and Late Middle Ages===
[[File:CouncilofClermont.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Pope Urban II]] at the [[Council of Clermont]], where he preached the [[First Crusade]].]]
In the west, from the 11th century onward, older cathedral schools developed into universities (see [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Paris]], and [[University of Bologna]].) Originally teaching only [[theology]], these steadily added subjects including medicine, philosophy and law, becoming the direct ancestors of modern western institutions of learning.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 305, 312, 314f..&lt;/ref&gt;

Accompanying the rise of the &quot;new towns&quot; throughout Western Europe, [[mendicant order]]s were founded, bringing the [[Consecrated life (Catholic Church)|consecrated religious life]] out of the monastery and into the new urban setting. The two principal mendicant movements were the [[Franciscans]]&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 303–07, 310f., 384–86.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 305, 310f., 316f.&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] and [[St. Dominic]] respectively. Both orders made significant contributions to the development of the great universities of Europe. Another new order were the [[Cistercians]], whose large isolated monasteries spearheaded the settlement of former wilderness areas. In this period church building and ecclesiastical architecture reached new heights, culminating in the orders of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture]] and the building of the great European cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 321–23, 365f.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1095 under the pontificate of [[Urban II]], the [[Crusades]] were launched.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 292–300.&lt;/ref&gt; These were a series of military campaigns in the [[Holy Land]] and elsewhere, initiated in response to pleas from the Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios I]] for aid against [[Turkish people|Turkish]] expansion. The Crusades ultimately failed to stifle Islamic aggression and even contributed to Christian enmity with the sacking of [[Constantinople]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]].&lt;ref&gt;Riley-Smith. ''The Oxford History of the Crusades''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a period stretching from the 7th to the 13th century, the Christian Church underwent gradual alienation, resulting in a [[East-West Schism|schism]] dividing it into a so-called Latin or [[Western Christianity|Western]] branch, the Roman Catholic Church,&lt;ref&gt;The Western church was called Latin at the time by the Eastern Christians and non Christians due to its conducting of its rituals and affairs in the Latin language&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]], largely Greek, branch, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]]. These two churches disagree on a number of administrative, liturgical, and doctrinal issues, most notably [[papal primacy|papal primacy of jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Orthodox Information Centre-Great Schism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/greatschism.aspx| title = The Great Schism: The Estrangement of Eastern and Western Christendom|publisher = Orthodox Information Centre|accessdate = 2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SandSp91&quot;&gt;Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Council of Lyon]] (1274) and the [[Council of Florence]] (1439) attempted to reunite the churches, but in both cases the Eastern Orthodox refused to implement the decisions and the two principal churches remain in schism to the present day. However, the Roman Catholic Church has achieved union with various [[Eastern Catholic Churches|smaller eastern churches]].

Beginning around 1184, following the crusade against the [[Cathars|Cathar]] heresy,&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 300, 304–05.&lt;/ref&gt; various institutions, broadly referred to as the [[Inquisition]], were established with the aim of suppressing [[heresy]] and securing religious and doctrinal unity within Christianity through [[religious conversion|conversion]] and prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 310, 383, 385, 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation===
[[File:95Thesen.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Opening of [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Luther's 95 Theses]]]]
{{Main|Protestant Reformation|Counter-Reformation}}

The 15th-century [[Renaissance]] brought about a renewed interest in ancient and classical learning. Another major schism, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], resulted in the splintering of the Western Christendom into several [[Christian denominations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon-120-121&quot;&gt;Simon. ''Great Ages of Man: The Reformation''. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] in 1517 [[95 Theses|protested]] against the sale of [[indulgences]] and soon moved on to deny several key points of Roman Catholic [[doctrine]]. Others like [[Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin|Calvin]] further criticized Roman Catholic teaching and worship. These challenges developed into the movement called [[Protestantism]], which repudiated the [[papal primacy|primacy of the pope]], the role of tradition, the [[Catholic sacraments|seven sacraments]], and other doctrines and practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon&quot;&gt;Simon. ''Great Ages of Man: The Reformation''. pp. 39, 55–61.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English Reformation|Reformation in England]] began in 1534, when [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] had himself [[Act of Supremacy|declared head]] of the [[Church of England]]. Beginning in 1536, the monasteries throughout England, Wales and Ireland were [[Dissolution of the monasteries|dissolved]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schama&quot;&gt;Schama. ''A History of Britain''. pp. 306–10.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Torture Inquisition.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Two priests demand a heretic to repent as he is tortured]]
Partly in response to the Protestant Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church engaged in a substantial process of reform and renewal, known as the [[Counter-Reformation]] or Catholic Reform.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bokenkotter242&quot;&gt;Bokenkotter, ''A Concise History of the Catholic Church'', pp. 242–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of Trent]] clarified and reasserted Roman Catholic doctrine. During the following centuries, competition between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism became deeply entangled with political struggles among European states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon3&quot;&gt;Simon. ''Great Ages of Man: The Reformation''. pp. 109–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the discovery of America by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492 brought about a new wave of missionary activity. Partly from missionary zeal, but under the impetus of [[Colonialism|colonial expansion]] by the European powers, Christianity spread to the Americas, Oceania, [[East Asia]], and [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

Throughout Europe, the divides caused by the Reformation led to outbreaks of [[religious violence]] and the establishment of separate state churches in Western Europe: [[Lutheranism]] in parts of Germany and in Scandinavia and [[Anglicanism]] in England in 1534. Ultimately, these differences led to the outbreak of [[religious war|conflicts]] in which religion played a key factor. The [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[English Civil War]], and the [[French Wars of Religion]] are prominent examples. These events intensified the [[Christian debate on persecution and toleration]].&lt;ref&gt;A general overview about the English discussion is given in Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration in Protestant England 1558–1689''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Enlightenment===
[[File:View from Stpeters.jpg|center|900px|thumb|[[360-degree view]] from the dome over the Vatican and out into Rome]]
In the era known as the [[Great Divergence]], when in the West the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[Scientific revolution]] brought about great societal changes, Christianity was confronted with various forms of [[skepticism]] and with certain modern [[Ideology|political ideologies]] such as versions of [[socialism]] and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Novak|first=Michael|title=Catholic social thought and liberal institutions: Freedom with justice|year=1988|publisher=Transaction|isbn=9780887387630|page=63|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7pb1GDmxA1UC&amp;pg=PA63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events ranged from mere [[anti-clericalism]] to violent outbursts against Christianity such as the [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|Dechristianisation]] during the [[French Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer Chambers, ''The Western Experience'' (vol. 2) chapter 21.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Spanish Civil War]], and general hostility of [[Marxism|Marxist]] movements, especially [[Russian Revolution (1917)|the Russian Revolution]].

Especially pressing in Europe was the formation of [[nation states]] after the [[Napoleonic era]]. In all European countries, different Christian denominations found themselves in competition, to greater or lesser extents, with each other and with the state. Variables are the relative sizes of the denominations and the religious, political, and ideological orientation of the state. Urs Altermatt of the [[University of Fribourg]], looking specifically at Catholicisms in Europe, identifies four models for the European nations. In traditionally Catholic countries such as [[Belgium]], [[Spain]], and to some extent [[Austria]], religious and national communities are more or less identical. Cultural symbiosis and separation are found in [[Poland]], [[Ireland]], and [[Switzerland]], all countries with competing denominations. Competition is found in [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], and again Switzerland, all countries with minority Catholic populations who to a greater or lesser extent did identify with the nation. Finally, separation between religion (again, specifically Catholicism) and the state is found to a great degree in France and [[Italy]], countries where the state actively opposed itself to the authority of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Altermatt|first=Urs|title=Religion und Nation: Katholizismen im Europa des 19. und 20. Jahrhundert|year=2007|publisher=Kohlhammer|isbn=978-3-17-019977-4|pages=15–34|editor=Urs Altermatt, Franziska Metzger|accessdate=10 August 2010|language=[[German language{{!}}German]]|chapter=Katholizismus und Nation: Vier Modelle in europäisch-vergleichender Perspektive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined factors of the formation of nation states and [[ultramontanism]], especially in Germany and the Netherlands but also in [[England]] (to a much lesser extent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heimann|first=Mary|title=Catholic Devotion in Victorian England|year=1995|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=0-19-820597-X|pages=165–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;), often forced Catholic churches, organizations, and believers to choose between the national demands of the state and the authority of the Church, specifically the papacy. This conflict came to a head in the [[First Vatican Council]], and in Germany would lead directly to the [[Kulturkampf]], where liberals and Protestants under the leadership of [[Bismarck]] managed to severely restrict Catholic expression and organization.

Christian commitment in Europe dropped as modernity and secularism came into their own{{Clarify|date=May 2008}} in Western Europe, while religious commitments in America have been generally high in comparison to Western Europe. The late 20th century has shown the shift of Christian adherence to the Third World and southern hemisphere in general, with western civilization no longer the chief standard bearer of Christianity.

Some Europeans (including diaspora), [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]], and natives of other continents have revived their respective peoples' historical folk religions. (see [[Neo-paganism]], [[Native Americans in the United States#Religion]]) Approximately 7.1 to 10% of [[Arabs]] are [[Arab Christians and Arabic-speaking Christians|Christians]]&lt;ref name=Pacini&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink=Philippe Fargues |title=Christian Communities in the Middle East |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |doi= |isbn=0-19-829388-7 |author= ed. by Andrea Pacini}}&lt;/ref&gt; most prevalent in Egypt, Syria and Lebanon.

In most countries in the developed world, church attendance among people who continue to identify themselves as Christians has been falling over the last few decades.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, ''Democracies in Flux: The Evolution of Social Capital in Contemporary Society'', p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources view this simply as part of a drift away from traditional membership institutions,&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, ''Christianity: An Introduction'', p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; while others link it to signs of a decline in belief in the importance of religion in general.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Marber, ''Money Changes Everything: How Global Prosperity Is Reshaping Our Needs, Values and Lifestyles'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major groupings within Christianity==
{{See also|List of Christian denominations|List of Christian denominations by number of members}}

These groups are sometimes classified under [[Christian denomination|denominations]], though for theological reasons many groups reject this classification system.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney E. Ahlstrom ({{Clarify|date=August 2008}}, p. 381.) characterized [[denominationalism]] in America as &quot;a virtual ecclesiology&quot; that &quot;first of all repudiates the insistences of the Roman Catholic church, the churches of the 'magisterial' Reformation, and of most sects that they alone are the true Church.&quot; For specific citations, on the Roman Catholic Church see the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' §816; other examples: Donald Nash, [http://www.crownhillchurch.com/Why_the_Churches_of_Christ_Are_Not_A_Denomination.pdf#search=%22church%20of%20christ%20not%20a%20denomination%22 Why the Churches of Christ are not a Denomination]; Wendell Winkler, [http://www.thebible.net/introchurch/ch4.html Christ's Church is not a Denomination]; and David E. Pratt, [http://www.biblestudylessons.com/cgi-bin/gospel_way/denominations.php What does God think about many Christian denominations?]&lt;/ref&gt; Another distinction that is sometimes drawn is between [[Eastern Christianity]] and [[Western Christianity]].

===Catholic===

The [[Catholic Church]] comprises those [[Particular Church|particular churches]], headed by bishops, in communion with the [[Pope]], the Bishop of Rome, as its highest authority in matters of faith, morality and Church governance.&lt;ref name=&quot;LumenG&quot;&gt;[[Second Vatican Council]], ''[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html Lumen Gentium]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SandSp1&quot;&gt;Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Eastern Orthodox]], the Roman Catholic Church through [[Apostolic succession]] traces its origins to the Christian community founded by Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name=&quot;NatGeographic281&quot;&gt;Hitchcock, ''Geography of Religion'', p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman11&quot;&gt;Norman, ''The Roman Catholic Church an Illustrated History'', p. 11, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics maintain that the &quot;[[Four Marks of the Church|one, holy, catholic and apostolic church]]&quot; founded by Jesus [[&quot;Subsistit in&quot; in Lumen Gentium|subsists fully]] in the Roman Catholic Church, but also acknowledges other Christian churches and communities&lt;ref name = &quot;LumenGentium&quot;&gt;[[Second Vatican Council]], ''[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html Lumen Gentium], chapter 2, paragraph 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p123a9p3.htm#IV paragraph 865].&lt;/ref&gt; and works towards [[ecumenism|reconciliation]] among all Christians.&lt;ref name = &quot;LumenGentium&quot;/&gt; The Catholic faith is detailed in the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cat&quot;&gt;Marthaler, ''Introducing the Catechism of the Catholic Church, Traditional Themes and Contemporary Issues'' (1994), preface.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = John Paul II| first =Pope | title =Laetamur Magnopere | publisher =Vatican | year =1997 | url =http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/laetamurmagnopere.htm | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20080211121910/http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/laetamurmagnopere.htm | archivedate =2008-02-11 | accessdate =2008-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2,782 [[Episcopal see|sees]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' (2007), p. 1172.&lt;/ref&gt; are grouped into [[Sui iuris#Catholic ecclesiastical use|23 particular rites]], the largest being the [[Latin Rite]], each with distinct traditions regarding the [[liturgy]] and the administering the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OneFaith71&quot;&gt;Barry, ''One Faith, One Lord'' (2001), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; With more than 1.1&amp;nbsp;billion baptized members, the Catholic Church is the largest [[Ecclesia (church)|church]] representing over half of all Christians and one sixth of the [[world population|world's population]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Adherents&quot;&gt;Adherents.com, [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html ''Religions by Adherents'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Zenit.org'', &quot;[http://www.zenit.org/article-18894?l=english Number of Catholics and Priests Rises]&quot;, 12 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;&gt;[[Central Intelligence Agency]], ''[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html CIA World Factbook]'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Various smaller communities, such as the [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]] and [[Independent Catholic Churches]], include the word ''Catholic'' in their title, and share much in common with Roman Catholicism but are no longer in [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the [[Holy See|See of Rome]]. The [[Old Catholic Church]] is in communion with the [[Anglican Communion]].&lt;ref&gt;According to the Bonn Accord of 1931, cited at [http://www.churchofthebeatitudes.org/id19.html Old Catholic Church of the Beatitudes].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caecg.de/ Council of Anglican Episcopal Churches in Germany].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodox===
{{Main|Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodoxy}}
{{See also|Eastern Christianity|List of Orthodox Churches}}
[[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] comprises those churches in communion with the Patriarchal Sees of the East, such as the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC1199&quot;&gt;Cross/Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', p. 1199.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church also traces its heritage to the foundation of Christianity through [[Apostolic succession]] and has an [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] structure, though the [[autocephaly|autonomy]] of the individual, mostly national churches is emphasized. A number of conflicts with Western Christianity over questions of doctrine and authority culminated in the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]]. Eastern Orthodoxy is the second largest single denomination in Christianity, with over 200&amp;nbsp;million adherents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adherents&quot;/&gt;

The [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]] (also called ''Old Oriental Churches'') are those eastern churches that recognize the first three ecumenical councils—[[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]] and [[First Council of Ephesus|Ephesus]]—but reject the dogmatic definitions of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] and instead espouse a [[Miaphysite]] [[christology]]. The Oriental Orthodox communion comprises six groups: [[Syriac Orthodox]], [[Coptic Orthodox]], [[Ethiopian Orthodox]], [[Eritrean Orthodox]], [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]] (India) and [[Armenian Apostolic]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/ecumenical/ooc-e.html |title=Oriental Orthodox Churches |publisher=Wcc-coe.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These six churches, while being in communion with each other are completely independent hierarchically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pluralism.org/affiliates/student/allen/Oriental-Orthodox/Home.html |title=An Introduction to the Oriental Orthodox Churches |publisher=Pluralism.org |date=2005-03-15 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These churches are generally not in communion with [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]] with whom they are in dialogue for a return to unity.&lt;ref name=&quot;sor.cua.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=OONS |url=http://sor.cua.edu/Ecumenism/20010317oomtg4.html |title=Syrian Orthodox Resources - Middle Eastern Oriental Orthodox Common Declaration |publisher=Sor.cua.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestant===

{{Main|Protestantism}}
{{See also|History of Protestantism}}
In the 16th century, [[Martin Luther]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]], and [[John Calvin]] inaugurated what has come to be called [[Protestantism]]. Luther's primary theological heirs are known as [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]. Zwingli and Calvin's heirs are far broader denominationally, and are broadly referred to as the [[Reformed|Reformed Tradition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McManners251&quot;&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity''. pp. 251–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Protestant traditions branch out from the Reformed tradition in some way. In addition to the Lutheran and Reformed branches of the Reformation, there is [[Anglicanism]] after the [[English Reformation]]. The [[Anabaptist]] tradition was largely ostracized by the other Protestant parties at the time, but has achieved a measure of affirmation in more recent history. Some but not most [[Baptists]] prefer not to be called Protestants, claiming a direct ancestral line going back to the apostles in the 1st century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Trail of Blood|publisher = The School of Biblical &amp; Theological Studies (2004)|author=Dr. [[James Milton Carroll]]|accessdate = 2009–09–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest Protestant groups separated from the Catholic Church in the 16th century [[Protestant Reformation]], followed in many cases by further divisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;McManners251&quot;/&gt; For example, the [[Methodist Church]] grew out of Anglican minister [[John Wesley]]'s [[Evangelism|evangelical]] and [[Holiness Movement|revival movement]] in the [[Anglican Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Methodist Central Hall Westminster—Methodism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.methodist-central-hall.org.uk/history/WhatisMethodism.htm| title = About The Methodist Church|publisher = Methodist Central Hall Westminster|accessdate = 2007-12-31}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Public Service Projects—Holiness Movement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mb-soft.com/believe/text/holiness.htm| title = American Holiness Movement|publisher = Finding Your Way, Inc|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Pentecostal]] and non-denominational Churches, which emphasize the cleansing power of the [[Holy Spirit]], in turn grew out of the Methodist Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Public Service Projects—Holiness Movement&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FYW—Pentecostalism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.findingyourwayinc.org/christianity.htm| title = Christianity: Pentecostal Churches|publisher = Finding Your Way, Inc.|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Methodists, Pentecostals, and other [[evangelicals]] stress &quot;accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;CUMC Accepting Christ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cambridgechristumc.com/statementofbelief.htm| title = Statement of Belief|publisher = Cambridge Christ United Methodist Church|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which comes from [[John Wesley]]'s emphasis of the [[New Birth]],&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC GBGM-The New Birth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://new.gbgm-umc.org/umhistory/wesley/sermons/45/| title = The New Birth by John Wesley (Sermon 45)|publisher = The United Methodist Church GBGM|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; they often refer to themselves as being [[Born again Christianity|born-again]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC GBGM-Grace&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/wesley/walk.stm| title = God's Preparing, Accepting, and Sustaining Grace|publisher = The United Methodist Church GBGM|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren Wilson College—Total Experience of the Spirit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.warren-wilson.edu/~religion/newifo/religions/christianity/index/pentecostal/essay.shtml| title = Total Experience of the Spirit|publisher = Warren Wilson College|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of the total number of Protestants are very uncertain, partly because of the difficulty in determining which denominations should be placed in these categories, but it seems clear that Protestantism is the second largest major group of Christians after Catholicism in number of followers (although the Orthodox Church is larger than any single Protestant denomination).&lt;ref name=&quot;Adherents&quot; /&gt;

A special grouping are the Anglican churches descended from the [[Church of England]] and organised in the [[Anglican Communion]]. Some Anglican churches consider themselves both Protestant and Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes/Booty/Knight. ''The Study of Anglicanism'', p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Anglicans consider their church a [[Branch theory|branch of the &quot;One Holy Catholic Church&quot;]] alongside of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, a concept rejected by the Roman Catholic Church and some Eastern Orthodox.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Hallam, ''[http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/ecumenical/hallam_orthodoxy_ecumenism.htm Orthodoxy and Ecumenism]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Mathewes-Green, &quot;[http://www.westernorthodox.com/branch.html Whither the Branch Theory?]&quot;, ''Anglican Orthodox Pilgrim'' Vol. 2, No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups of individuals who hold basic Protestant tenets identify themselves simply as &quot;Christians&quot; or &quot;[[born-again]] Christians&quot;. They typically distance themselves from the [[confessionalism (religion)|confessionalism]] and/or [[creed]]alism of other Christian communities&lt;ref&gt;Confessionalism is a term employed by historians to describe &quot;the creation of fixed identities and systems of beliefs for separate churches which had previously been more fluid in their self-understanding, and which had not begun by seeking separate identities for themselves—they had wanted to be truly Catholic and reformed.&quot; (MacCulloch, ''The Reformation: A History'', p. xxiv.)&lt;/ref&gt; by calling themselves &quot;[[Non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational]]&quot;. Often founded by individual pastors, they have little affiliation with historic denominations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life / U.S. Religious Landscape Survey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url =http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report2religious-landscape-study-appendix3.pdf |title = Classification of Protestant Denominations|publisher = Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life / U.S. Religious Landscape Survey|accessdate = 2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-trinitarian===
{{Main|Nontrinitarianism}}
[[Nontrinitarianism]] includes all [[Christian]] [[Christian theology|belief systems]] that reject, wholly or partly, the [[doctrine]] of the [[Trinity]], namely, the teaching that God is three distinct yet coeternal and coequal ''[[Hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostases]]'' who are indivisibly united in one essence.&lt;ref name=&quot;devil&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title =Do You Believe in a Devil? | publisher =CMPA | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.thechristadelphian.com/pamphlets/standardseries/doyoubelieve.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15047a.htm The dogma of the Trinity]'' at 'Catholic Encyclopedia', ed. Kevin Knight at New Advent website&lt;/ref&gt; In antiquity, sporadically in the Middle Ages, and again following the Reformation until today, differing views existed concerning the Godhead from those of Trinitarians and the related traditional [[Christology]]. Though diverse, these views may be generally classified into those that hold Christ to be only divine and not differing from the Father [[Hypostasis (Christianity)|hypostatically]]; those that hold Christ to be less fully God than the Father; in other forms being completely human and a messenger as the perfect created human.&lt;ref&gt;John 6:14 Jesus identified as a prophet. The greater Moses.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On Unitarians, see: UUA.org, [http://www.uua.org/re/reach/fall01/curriculum/unitarian_views_of_jesus.html ''Unitarian Views of Jesus'']; on connection with Socinianism, see: sullivan-county.com, [http://www.sullivan-county.com/nf0/nov_2000/unitarian1.htm ''Socinianism: Unitarianism in 16th-17th century Poland and Its Influence''] (Note that the icon at the top of the page expresses Trinitarian theology with a symbolic hand gesture); on this matter they parallel the ancient [[Ebionites]], see: J.N.D. Kelly, ''Early Christian Doctrines'' pp. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Esoteric Christianity}}
'''Esoteric Christianity''' is a term which refers to an ensemble of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] currents which regard Christianity as a [[Western esotericism|mystery religion]],&lt;ref&gt;Western Esotericism and the Science of Religion: Selected Papers Presented at the 17th Congress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Besant 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Besant | first = Annie | title = Esoteric Christianity or the Lesser Mysteries | publisher = Adamant Media Corporation | location = City | year = 2001 | isbn = 9781402100291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and profess the existence and possession of certain [[Esotericism|esoteric]] doctrines or practices,&lt;ref&gt;From the Greek ἐσωτερικός (esôterikos, &quot;inner&quot;). The term [[esotericism]] itself was coined in the 17th century. (Oxford English Dictionary Compact Edition, Volume 1,Oxford University Press, 1971, p. 894.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wouter J. Hanegraaff, Antoine Faivre, Roelof van den Broek, Jean-Pierre Brach, Dictionary of Gnosis &amp; Western Esotericism, Brill 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; hidden from the public but accessible only to a narrow circle of &quot;enlightened&quot;, &quot;initiated&quot;, or highly educated people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webster.com/dictionary/esotericism |title=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary: esotericism |publisher=Webster.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webster.com/dictionary/esoteric |title=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary: esoteric |publisher=Webster.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special characteristic common in these mystical denominations is the belief in  [[reincarnation]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
Some of the esoteric christian institutions include the [[Rosicrucian Fellowship]], the [[Anthroposophical Society]] and the [[Martinism]].

The [[Second Great Awakening]], a period of religious revival that occurred in the [[United States|U.S.]] during the early 1800s, saw the development of a number of unrelated churches. They generally saw themselves as restoring the original church of [[Jesus Christ]] rather than reforming one of the existing churches.&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 91f.&lt;/ref&gt; A common belief held by Restorationists was that the other divisions of Christianity had introduced doctrinal defects into Christianity, which was known as the [[Great Apostasy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Religious Tolerance—Restorationism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.religioustolerance.org/chrrest.htm| title = The Restorationist Movements|publisher = Religious Tolerance|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Got Questions Ministries—Restorationism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gotquestions.org/restorationism.html| title = What is Restorationism?|publisher = Got Questions Ministries|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the churches originating during this period are historically connected to early-19th century camp meetings in the Midwest and Upstate New York. American [[Millennialism]] and [[Adventist|Adventism]], which arose from Evangelical Protestantism, influenced the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] movement (with 7&amp;nbsp;million members),&lt;ref&gt;JW-Media.org [http://www.jw-media.org/people/statistics.htm#Jehovah%Witness%Membership%2005 Membership 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; and, as a reaction specifically to [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]]. Others, including the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]], [[Evangelical Christian Church in Canada]], [[Churches of Christ]], and the [[Independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ]], have their roots in the contemporaneous Stone-Campbell [[Restoration Movement]], which was centered in Kentucky and Tennessee. Other groups originating in this time period include the [[Christadelphians]] and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the largest denomination of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] with over 13&amp;nbsp;million members.&lt;!--FOOTNOTES--&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/conference/talk/display/0,5232,23-1-1032-10,00.html |title=Statistical Report 2008 |publisher=Lds.org |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = SLT13&gt;&quot;LDS Church says membership now 13&amp;nbsp;million worldwide&quot;, ''Salt Lake Tribune'', June 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = LDS13&gt;Press Release, LDS Church, [http://www.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=80fc110c00c53110VgnVCM100000176f620aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=9ae411154963d010VgnVCM1000004e94610aRCRD &quot;One Million Missionaries, Thirteen Million Members&quot;], June 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The church counts all members who were ever baptized, who have neither been excommunicated nor asked to have their names removed from church records. Independent surveys estimate that about 50% of people on LDS Church rolls do not identify with the religion. See John Dart, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_17_124/ai_n20525201/ Counting Mormons: study says LDS numbers inflated], Christian Century, August 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While the churches originating in the Second Great Awakening have some superficial similarities, their doctrine and practices vary significantly.

===Cultural Christian===

[[Cultural Christian]] is a broad term used to describe people with either ethnic or religious [[Christian]] heritage who may not believe in the religious claims of Christianity, but who retain an affinity for the [[Christian pop culture|culture]], [[Christian art|art]], [[Christian music|music]], and so on related to it.

Many of the population of the Western hemisphere could broadly be described as cultural Christians, due to the predominance of the Christian faith in [[Western culture]], as well as widely celebrated religious holidays such as [[Easter]] and [[Christmas]]. Another frequent application of the term is to distinguish political groups in areas of mixed religious backgrounds.

==Ecumenism==
{{Main|Ecumenism}}
[[File:ChristianFlagEtc CovenantPresbyterianLongBeach20050213 CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg|thumb|320px|The [[Christian Flag]] displayed next to the [[pulpit]] on the [[chancel]] of a church sanctuary.]]
Most [[Church body|churches]] have long expressed ideals of being reconciled with each other, and in the 20th century Christian [[ecumenism]] advanced in two ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;McManners581&quot;&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', pp. 581–84.&lt;/ref&gt; One way was greater cooperation between groups, such as the [[Edinburgh Missionary Conference]] of Protestants in 1910, the Justice, Peace and Creation Commission of the [[World Council of Churches]] founded in 1948 by Protestant and Orthodox churches, and similar national councils like the [[National Council of Churches in Australia]] which includes Roman Catholics.&lt;ref name=&quot;McManners581&quot;/&gt;

The other way was institutional union with new [[United and uniting churches]]. [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[Methodist]], and [[Presbyterian]] churches united in 1925 to form the [[United Church of Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity''. p. 413f.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1977 to form the [[Uniting Church in Australia]]. The [[Church of South India]] was formed in 1947 by the union of Anglican, [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], and [[Reformed Church|Reformed]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steps towards reconciliation on a global level were taken in 1965 by the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches mutually revoking the excommunications that marked their [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] in 1054;&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission]] (ARCIC) working towards full communion between those churches since 1970;&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 583.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Lutheran World Federation|Lutheran]] and Roman Catholic churches signing The [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]] in 1999 to address conflicts at the root of the Protestant Reformation. In 2006, the [[World Methodist Council|Methodist church]] adopted the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutheranworld.org/What_We_Do/OEA/Methodist-Statement-2006-EN.pdf |title=Methodist Statement |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of ecumenism is the invention of and growing usage of the [[Christian Flag]], which was designed to represent all of [[Christendom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Prayer Foundation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.prayerfoundation.org/christian_flag.htm|title =The Christian Flag|publisher = Prayer Foundation|quote=The flag's most conspicuous symbol is the Christian cross, the most universal symbol for Christianity. The red color represents the blood of Christ and brings to mind his crucifixion.  Christians believe that Jesus Christ's death and resurrection is the means God uses to save believers from their sins. The cross and blood have been used since earliest Christianity to symbolize salvation through Jesus; in the words of the Apostle Paul, &quot;And having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself;&quot; -Colossians 1:20. The white field draws on symbolism throughout the Bible equating white clothes with purity and forgiveness.  People who have been &quot;washed white as snow&quot; in the Bible have been cleansed from their sins (Isaiah 1:18; Psalm 51:2).  In conventional vexillology (the study of flags, their history and sybolism), a white flag is linked to surrender, a reference to the Biblical description Jesus' non-violence and surrender to God's will. The symbolism behind the blue canton has been interpreted to represent Heaven, truth, or the Christian ritual of Baptism in water.|accessdate = 2007–10–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag has a white [[flag terminology|field]], with a red [[Latin cross]] inside a blue [[flag terminology|canton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Prayer Foundation&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Babbage Difference Engine (Being utilised).jpg|thumb|[[Difference engine]]: computing the solution to a [[polynomial function]].]]

'''Computing''' is usually defined as the activity of using and improving [[computer]] [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[computer software|software]]. It is the computer-specific part of [[information technology]]. [[Computer science]] (or computing science) is the study and the science of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their implementation and application in computer systems.

''Computing Curricula 2005''&lt;ref name=curricula&gt;The Joint Task Force for Computing Curricula 2005. [http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt; defined computing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''In a general way, we can define computing to mean any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating computers. Thus, computing includes designing and building hardware and software systems for a wide range of purposes; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific studies using computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; creating and using communications and entertainment media; finding and gathering information relevant to any particular purpose, and so on. The list is virtually endless, and the possibilities are vast.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A computer is a [[machine]] that manipulates [[Data (computing)|data]] according to a set of [[Code (computer programming)|instructions]] called a [[computer program]].  The program has an [[Execution (computing)|executable]] form that the computer can use directly to execute the instructions.  The same program in its human-readable [[source code]] form, enables a [[programmer]] to study and develop the [[Algorithm#Formalization|algorithm]]. Because the instructions can be carried out in different types of computers, a single set of source instructions converts to machine instructions according to the [[central processing unit]] type.

The execution [[process (computing)|process]] carries out the instructions in a computer program. Instructions express the [[computation]]s performed by the computer. They trigger sequences of simple actions on the executing machine. Those actions produce effects according to the [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantics]] of the instructions.

[[Computer programming]] in general is the process of writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the [[source code]] and documentation of [[computer program]]s. This source code is written in a [[programming language]], which is an [[artificial language]], restrictive, demanding, and unforgiving to humans but easily translated by the computer. The purpose of programming is to invoke the desired behaviour (customization) from the machine. The process of writing high quality source code requires knowledge of both the application's domain ''and'' the computer science domain.  The highest quality software is thus developed by a team of various domain experts, each person a specialist in some area of development.  But the term ''programmer'' may apply to a range of program quality, from [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]] to [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|open source contributor]] to professional. And a single programmer could do most or all of the computer programming needed to generate the [[proof of concept]] to launch a new [[Killer application|&quot;killer&quot; application]].

==Definitions==
{{Wikiversity|computing}}
The term ''computing'' has sometimes been narrowly defined, as in a 1989 [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] report on ''Computing as a Discipline''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.gmu.edu/cne/pjd/GP/CompDisc.pdf Computing as a Discipline (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The discipline of computing is the systematic study of algorithmic
processes that describe and transform information: their theory, analysis, design, efficiency, implementation, and application. The fundamental question underlying all computing is 'What can be (efficiently) automated?'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Computing Curricula 2005''&lt;ref name=curricula/&gt; also recognizes that the meaning of ''computing'' depends on the context:-

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Computing also has other meanings that are more specific, based on the context in which the term is used. For example, an information systems specialist will view computing somewhat differently from a software engineer. Regardless of the context, doing computing well can be complicated and difficult. Because society needs people to do computing well, we must think of computing not only as a profession but also as a discipline.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term ''computing'' is also synonymous with counting and calculating. In earlier times it was used in reference to mechanical computing machines.

A computer is a machine that reads, stores, manipulates and displays data. The most common example is the [[personal computers]]. Other common examples include [[mobile phones]], [[mp3 players]], [[satellites]], [[video game consoles]].

[[File:Casino slots2.jpg|thumb|[[Slot machine]]s are commonplace in casinos]]

In modern English a '''casino''' is a facility that houses and accommodates certain types of [[gambling]] activities. Casinos are most commonly built near or combined with [[hotel]]s, [[restaurants]], retail [[shopping]], [[cruise ship]]s and other tourist attractions. Some casinos are known for hosting live entertainment events, such as [[stand-up comedy]], [[concert]]s, and sporting events. Use in the past, and modern use in other countries, does not necessarily involve gambling.

== Etymology and usage ==
[[File:Casino da Póvoa.jpg|thumb|left|[[Casino da Póvoa]], a Portuguese casino that opened in early 1930s]]
The term &quot;Casino&quot; is of [[Italy|Italian]] origin, the root word being &quot;[[Casa]]&quot; (house) and originally meant a small country [[villa]], [[Summerhouse (building)|summerhouse]] or [[pavilion (structure)|pavilion]].  The word changed to refer to a building built for pleasure, usually on the grounds of a larger [[Italy|Italian]] villa or [[palazzo]]. Such buildings were used to host civic town functions – including dancing, music listening and gambling. 

There are examples of such casinos at [[Villa Giulia]] and [[Villa Farnese]]. In modern day Italian, this term designates a [[brothel|bordello]] (also called &quot;casa chiusa&quot;, literally &quot;closed house&quot;), while the gambling house is spelled ''casinò'' with an accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50034083?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=casino&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 |title=Casino }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, the term &quot;casino&quot; came to include other public buildings where pleasurable activities, including gambling, and sports took place. An example of this type of building is the [[Newport Casino]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].

Not all casinos were used for gaming. The [[Copenhagen Casino]] was a [[theatre]], known for the use made of its hall for mass public meetings during the [[1848 Revolution]] which made Denmark a [[constitutional monarchy]]. Until 1937 it was a well-known Danish theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/samling/dra/dra-specialkataloger.html|title=Special catalogues in the Drama Collection |accessdate=2007-07-09 |work=The Royal Library }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hanko Casino located in [[Hanko]], [[Finland]] - one of that town's most conspicuous landmarks - was never used for gambling. Rather, it was a banquet hall for the [[Russian nobility]] which frequented this [[destination spa|spa]] [[resort]] in the late 19th century, and is presently used as a restaurant.  The [[Catalina Casino]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalonball.com/casino.asp |title=Avalon Casino Ballroom |publisher=Avalonball.com |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; a famous landmark overlooking Avalon Harbor on [[Santa Catalina Island, California]], has never been used for traditional games of chance, which were already outlawed in California by the time it was built.

In military usage in Spanish and German, a ''casino'' or ''kasino'' is an officers' [[mess]]; a confusing linguistic [[false friend]] for translators.

==History of gambling houses==
The precise origin of gambling is unknown. The [[China|Chinese]] recorded the first official account of the practice in 2300 BC, but it is generally believed that gambling in some form or another has been seen in almost every society in history.  From the Ancient [[Greeks]] and Romans to Napoleon's [[France]] and Elizabethan [[England]], much of history is filled with stories of entertainment based on games of chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jobmonkey.com/casino/html/brief_history.html |title=History of Casinos &amp; Casino Jobs |publisher=Job Monkey.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known European gambling house, not called a casino although meeting the modern definition, was the [[Ridotto]], established in [[Venice]], Italy in 1638 to provide controlled gambling during the carnival season. It was closed in the 1770 as the city government perceived it to impoverish the local gentry. 

In American history, early gambling establishments were known as [[Western saloon|saloons]]. The creation and importance of saloons was greatly influenced by four major cities; [[New Orleans]], [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]] and [[San Francisco]].  It was in the saloons that travelers could find people to talk to, drink with, and often gamble with.  During the early 20th century in America, gambling became outlawed and banned by state legislation and social reformers of the time.  However, in 1931, gambling was legalized throughout the state of [[Nevada]], along with [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]] and [[Reno]]. America's first legalized casinos were set up in those places.  In 1978 [[New Jersey]] allowed gambling in [[Atlantic City]], now America's second largest gambling city.

==Gambling in casinos==
[[File:casino6933.JPG|thumb|Baccarat casino, [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]]]]
In most jurisdictions worldwide, gambling is limited to persons over the [[age of license]] (16 to 21 years of age in most countries where casinos are permitted).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rose.casinocitytimes.com/articles/966.html |title=Minimum Legal Age to Place a Bet |accessdate=2008-04-07 |last=Rose |first=Nelson |coauthors= |date=2000-06-15 |work= Gaming Guru|publisher=Casino City Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Customers gamble by playing [[casino game|games of chance]], in some cases with an element of skill, such as [[craps]], [[roulette]], [[baccarat]], [[blackjack]], and [[video poker]]. Most games played have mathematically-determined [[odds]] that ensure the house has at all times an advantage over the players. This can be expressed more precisely by the notion of [[expected value]], which is uniformly negative (from the player's perspective).  This advantage is called the ''[[house edge]]''. In games such as poker where players play against each other, the house takes a commission called the [[Rake (poker)|rake]]. Casinos sometimes give out complimentary items to gamblers.

''Payout'' is the percentage won by players. 

Casinos in the USA say that a player staking money won from the casino is ''playing with house money''.

=== Significant sites===
While there are casinos in many places, a few places have become well-known specifically for gambling. Perhaps the place almost defined by its casino is Monte Carlo, but other places are known as gambling centers.

====Monte Carlo, Monaco ====
{{Main|Monte Carlo Casino}}
[[Monte Carlo]] has a famous casino popular with well-off visitors, which is a tourist attraction in its own right. A [[The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo (song)|song]] and a [[The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo|film]] named ''The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo'' need no explanation&amp;mdash;they clearly refer to the casino. 

The casino has made Monte Carlo so well-known for games of chance that mathematical methods for solving various problems using many [[Pseudorandomness|quasi-random numbers]]&amp;mdash;numbers with the statistical  distribution of numbers generated by chance&amp;mdash;are formally known as [[Monte Carlo methods]]. Monte Carlo, was part of the plot in a few James Bond novels and films.

==== Macau, China ====
{{Main|Gambling in Macau}}
The former [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese colony]] of [[Macau]], part of China since 1999, is a popular destination for visitors who wish to gamble. This started in Portuguese times, when [[Macau]] was popular with visitors from nearby [[British empire|British]] [[Hong Kong]] where gambling was more closely regulated.

==== Casinos in the United States ====
[[File:Las Vegas Strip.png|thumb|The [[Las Vegas Strip]] is renowned for its high concentration of casino resort hotels]]
In  much of the Unites States casinos are forbidden or tightly regulated. A few places allow casinos, and they have become well-known as centers of legal gambling. Relatively small places such as Las Vegas are best-known for gambling; larger cities such as Chicago are not defined by their casinos in spite of the large turnover.

[[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]] has the largest concentration of casinos in the United States.  Based on revenue, [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] ranks second, and the [[Chicago]] region third. 

Top American Casino Markets by Revenue (2009 Annual Revenues&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americangaming.org/assets/files/State_of_the_States_2010_FINAL.pdf, American Gaming Association: State of the States 2010 Report (page 8)], accessed 11 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;):
*1. [[LV Strip (Nevada gaming area)|Las Vegas Strip]] $5.550 billion
*2. [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] $3.943 billion
*3. Chicago region $2.092 billion
*4. [[Connecticut]] $1.448 billion
*5. [[Detroit]] $1.36 billion
*6. St. Louis $1.050 billion
*7. [[Tunica Resorts, Mississippi]] $997.02 million
*8. [[Biloxi]], Miss. $833.50 million
*9. Shreveport, La. $779.65 million
*10. [[Boulder Strip (Nevada gaming area)|Boulder Strip]] (Las Vegas) $774.33 million
*12. [[Reno, Nevada]] $715.23 million
*15. New Orleans, La. $653.05 million
*18. [[Downtown (Nevada gaming area)|Downtown Las Vegas]] $523.82 million
*19. [[Laughlin, Nevada]] $492.51 million

The [[Nevada Gaming Control Board]] divides [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]], which is coextensive with the Las Vegas metropolitan area, into seven regions for reporting purposes.

[[Native American gambling enterprises|Indian gaming]] has been responsible for a rise in the number of casinos outside of Las Vegas and Atlantic City.

==Security==
{{main|Casino security}}
[[File:noidnoentry.jpg|right|thumb|A sign at the [[OLG Casino Thousand Islands|Thousand Islands Casino]]]]
Given the large amounts of currency handled within a casino, both patrons and staff may be tempted to cheat and steal, in collusion or independently; most casinos have security measures to prevent this. Security cameras located throughout the casino are the most basic measure.  

Modern casino security is usually divided between a physical security force, which patrols the casino floor and responds to calls for assistance and reports of suspicious or definite criminal activity, and a specialized surveillance department that operates the casino's [[closed circuit television]] system (known in the industry as [[Eye in the sky (camera)|the eye in the sky]]). These departments work closely together{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}.  Some casinos also have catwalks in the ceiling above the casino floor, which allow surveillance personnel to look directly down, through one way glass, on the activities at the tables and slot machines.

When it opened in 1989 [[The Mirage]] was the first casino to use [[cameras]] full-time on all table games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knightly |first= Arnold M. |year=2007 |month=February |title=Blink and you'll miss him |journal=Casino City Times|pages=1 |url=http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article/casino-business-blink-and-youll-miss-him-164381 |accessdate= 2011-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to cameras and other technological measures, casinos also enforce security through rules of conduct and behavior; for example, players at card games are usually required to keep their hands visible at all times.

== Crime ==
One area of controversy surrounding casinos is their relationship to crime rates. Many casino opponents contend that casinos contribute to crime, and some recent research supports this.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} However, economics studies that do show a positive relationship between casinos and crime usually fail to consider the visiting population at risk when they calculate the crime rate in casino areas. Such studies thus count the crimes committed by visitors, but do not count visitors in the population measure, and this overstates the crime rates in casino areas. Part of the reason this methodology is used, despite it leading to an overstatement of crime rates is that reliable data on tourist count are often not available.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Douglas M. &quot;Do Casinos Really Cause Crime?&quot; (Jan 2008). ''Econ Journal Watch'' [http://econjwatch.org/articles/do-casinos-really-cause-crime]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khmer''' ({{lang|km|ភាសាខ្មែរ}}), or '''Cambodian''', is the language of the [[Khmer people]] and the official language of [[Cambodia]]. It is the second most widely spoken [[Austro-Asiatic languages|Austroasiatic language]] (after [[Vietnamese Language|Vietnamese]]), with speakers in the tens of millions. Khmer has been considerably influenced by [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli|Pali]], especially in the royal and religious [[register (linguistics)|registers]], through the vehicles of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. It is also the earliest recorded and earliest written language of the [[Mon-Khmer]] family, predating [[Mon language|Mon]] and by a significant margin Vietnamese. As a result of geographic proximity, the Khmer language has influenced, and also been influenced by; [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Lao language|Lao]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and [[Cham language|Cham]] many of which all form a pseudo-[[sprachbund]] in peninsular [[Southeast Asia]], since most contain high levels of [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] influences.&lt;ref name =&quot;cl&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Cambodian Linguistics, Literature and History: Collected Articles |author= David A.

Khmer has its own script, an [[abugida]] known in Khmer as [[Khmer Script|Aksar Khmer]].
Khmer differs from neighboring languages such as Thai, Lao and Vietnamese in that it is not a [[tonal language]].

The main dialects, all mutually intelligible, are:
*'''Battambang''', spoken in northern Cambodia.
*'''Phnom Penh''', the capital dialect and is also spoken in surrounding provinces.
*'''[[Northern Khmer]]''', also known as ''Khmer Surin'', spoken by ethnic Khmer native to Northeast Thailand
*'''[[Khmer Krom]]''' or '''Southern Khmer''', spoken by the indigenous Khmer population of the Mekong Delta.
*'''Cardamom Khmer''', an archaic form spoken by a small population in the [[Cardamom Mountains]] of western Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Khmer American: Identity and Moral Education in a Diasporic Community |author= Nancy Joan Smith-Hefner|year=1999|publisher=University of California|isbn=0520213491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Linguistics|Linguistic]] study of the Khmer language divides its history into four periods.&lt;ref name=&quot;SIDWELL&quot;&gt;[http://people.anu.edu.au/~u9907217/languages/Khmer-Cambodian.html Khmer/Cambodian] Paul Sidwell. Australian National University. Accessed February 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-Angkorian Khmer, the language after its divergence from Proto-Mon-Khmer until the ninth century, is only known from words and phrases in Sanskrit texts of the era. Old Khmer (or Angkorian Khmer) is the language as it was spoken in the [[Khmer Empire]] from the 9th century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the 13th century. Old Khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars, most notably Saveros Pou, Phillip Jenner and Heinz-Jürgen Pinnow. Following the end of the Khmer Empire the language lost the standardizing influence of being the language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[phonology]] and [[lexicon]]. The language of this transition period, from about the 14th to 18th centuries, is referred to as Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai, Lao and, to a lesser extent, Vietnamese. The changes during this period are so profound that the rules of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand Old Khmer. The language became recognizable as Modern Khmer, spoken from the 19th century till today.&lt;ref name=&quot;SIDWELL&quot; /&gt;

The following table shows the conventionally accepted historical stages of Khmer (Sidwell 2009:107).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2009&quot;/&gt;

Khmer is classified as a member of the Eastern branch of the [[Mon-Khmer languages|Mon-Khmer]] language family, itself a subdivision of the larger Austro-Asiatic language group, which has representatives in a large swath of land from Northeast India down through Southeast Asia to the Malay Peninsula and its islands. As such, its closest relatives are the languages of the [[Pearic languages|Pearic]], [[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]], and [[Katuic languages|Katuic]] families spoken by the hill tribes of the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shorto&quot;&gt;Shorto, Harry L. edited by Sidwell, Paul, Cooper, Doug and Bauer, Christian (2006). ''A Mon-Khmer comparative dictionary''. Canberra: Australian National University. Pacific Linguistics. ISBN 0-85883-570-3&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vietic languages]] have also been classified as belonging to this family.

==Phonology==
The phonological system described here is the inventory of sounds of the spoken language, not how they are written in the [[Khmer alphabet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HUFF&quot;&gt;Huffman, Franklin. 1970. ''[http://www.pratyeka.org/csw/hlp-csw.pdf Cambodian System of Writing and Beginning Reader]''. Yale University Press. ISBN 0-300-01314-0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tone and phonation===
Most Cambodian dialects are not tonal. However, the colloquial Phnom Penh dialect has developed a marginal tonal contrast (a level versus a peaking tone) to compensate for the [[elision]] of {{IPA|/r/}}.&lt;ref name=ELL/&gt;

Khmer once had a [[phonation]] distinction in its vowels, which was indicated in writing by choosing between two sets of letters for the preceding consonant according to the historical source of the phonation. However, phonation has been lost in all but the most archaic dialect of Khmer (Western Khmer).&lt;ref name=&quot;SIDWELL&quot; /&gt; For example, Old Khmer distinguished voiced and unvoiced pairs as in {{IPA|*kaa}} vs {{IPA|*ɡaa}}. The vowels after voiced consonants became [[breathy voice]]d and diphthongized: {{IPA|*kaa, *ɡe̤a}}. When consonant voicing was lost, the distinction was maintained by the vowel: {{IPA|*kaa, *ke̤a}}, and later the phonation disappeared as well: {{IPA|[kaː], [kiə]}}.&lt;ref name=ELL/&gt;

Khmer is frequently described as having [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated stops]]. However, these may be analyzed as [[consonant cluster]]s, {{IPA|/ph, th, ch, kh/}}, as [[infix]]es can occur between the stop and the aspiration ''(phem, p&lt;an&gt;hem),'' or as non-distinctive phonetic detail in other consonant clusters, such as the ''khm'' in ''Khmer.''&lt;ref name=ELL&gt;{{cite book|last=Minegishi|first=M|title=Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics|editor=Keith Brown|publisher=Elsevier|year=2006|edition=2|pages=4981–4984|chapter=Khmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SOAS/&gt; {{IPA|[b]}} and {{IPA|[d]}} are occasional [[allophones]] of the implosives.

In addition, the consonants {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, {{IPA|/z/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} may occasionally occur in recent [[loan word]]s in the speech of Cambodians familiar with French and other languages. These non-native sounds are not represented in the Khmer script, although combinations of letters otherwise unpronounceable are used to represent them when necessary. In the speech of those who are not bilingual, these sounds are approximated with natively occurring [[phoneme]]s:

===Vowel nuclei===
There is little agreement as to the vowels of Khmer. This may be in part because political centralization has not been achieved, so standard Khmer does not prevail throughout Cambodia. As such, many speakers of even the same community may have different phonological inventories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://repository.tufs.ac.jp/bitstream/10108/21736/1/jaas031010.pdf| title= On Takeo Dialects of Khmer: Phonology and World List| first=Makoto| last=Minegishi| year=1986| accessdate=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two proposals follow:

The precise number and the phonetic value of vowel nuclei vary from dialect to dialect. Short and long vowels of equal quality are distinguished solely by duration.

===Syllable structure===
Khmer words are predominantly either monosyllabic or [[Minor syllable|sesquisyllabic]], with stress falling on the final syllable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schiller&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/schiller1994khmer.pdf | title= Khmer Nominalizing and Causitivizing Infixes| year=1994 | first=Eric| last= Schiller | publisher=University of Chicago| accessdate =2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sesquisyllabic words are phonetically disyllabic, but the vowel of the first syllable is strictly epenthetic and predictable.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} There are 85 possible clusters of two consonants at the beginning of syllables and two three-consonant clusters with phonetic alterations as shown below:

Syllables begin with one of these consonants or consonant clusters, followed by one of the vowel nuclei. The aspiration in some clusters is allophonic.&lt;ref name=SOAS&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=JM|title=Classical Civilizations of South-East Asia: Key Papers from SOAS|editor=VI Braginskiĭ|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|chapter=The Structure of the Word in Old Khmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the vowel nucleus is short, there has to be a final consonant. {{IPA|/p, t, c, k, ʔ, m, n, ɲ, ŋ, l, h, j, ʋ/}} can exist in a [[syllable coda]], while {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/ʋ/}} become {{IPA|[ç]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} respectively.

The most common word structure in Khmer is a full syllable as described above, which may be preceded by an unstressed, “minor” syllable that has a consonant-vowel structure of CV-, CrV-, CVN- or CrVN- (N is any nasal in the Khmer inventory). The vowel in these preceding syllables is usually reduced in conversation to {{IPA|[ə]}}, however in careful or formal speech and in TV and radio, they are always clearly articulated.

Words with three or more syllables exist, particularly those pertaining to science, the arts, and religion. However, these words are loanwords, usually derived from Pali, Sanskrit, or more recently, French.

==Grammar==
{{Main|Khmer grammar}}

Khmer is generally a [[Subject Verb Object]] (SVO) language with [[prepositions]].&lt;ref&gt;Huffman, Franklin. 1967. ''An outline of Cambodian Grammar''. PhD thesis, Cornell University.&lt;/ref&gt; Although primarily an [[isolating language]], lexical [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] by means of [[prefixes]] and [[infixes]] is common.&lt;ref name = &quot;cc&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Colloquial Cambodian: A Complete Language Course |author= David Smyth|year=1995|publisher=Routledge (UK)|isbn=0415100062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjectives, demonstratives and numerals follow their noun:

{{lang|km|ស្រីស្អាតនោះ}} {{IPA|/srəj sʔaːt nuh/}} (girl pretty that) = that pretty girl

The noun has no grammatical gender or singular/plural distinction. Plurality can be marked by [[postnominal]] particles, numerals, or by doubling the adjective, which can also serve to intensify the adjective:

{{lang|km|ឆ្កែធំ}} {{IPA|/cʰkae tʰom/}} (dog large) = large dog

{{lang|km|ឆ្កែធំធំ}} {{IPA|/cʰkae tʰom tʰom/}} (dog large large) = a very large dog or large dogs

{{lang|km|ឆ្កែធំណាស់}} {{IPA|/cʰkae tʰom nah/}} (dog large very) = very large dog

{{lang|km|ឆ្កែពីរ}} {{IPA|/cʰkae piː/}} (dog two) = two dogs

[[Classifier (linguistics)|Classifying particles]] for use between numerals and nouns exist although are not always obligatory as in, for example, Thai. As is typical of most East Asian languages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-927311-1.pdf East and Southeast Asian Languages: A First Look] at Oxford University Press Online&lt;/ref&gt; the verb does not inflect at all; tense and aspect can be shown by particles and adverbs or understood by context. Verbs are negated by putting {{IPA|/min/}} before them and {{IPA|/teː/}} at the end of the sentence or clause. In normal speech verbs can also be negated without the need for an ending particle by putting {{IPA|/ʔɐt/}} before them.

{{lang|km|ខ្ញុំជឿ}} {{IPA|/kʰɲom cɨə/}} - I believe

{{lang|km|ខ្ញុំមិនជឿទេ}} {{IPA|/kʰɲom min cɨə teː/}} - I don't believe

{{lang|km|ខ្ញុំ​ឥត​ជឿ}} {{IPA|/kʰɲom ʔɐt cɨə/}} - I don't believe

==Dialects==
[[Dialect]]s are sometimes quite marked. Notable variations are found in speakers from [[Phnom Penh]] (which is the capital city), the rural [[Battambang Province|Battambang]] area, the areas of Northeast Thailand adjacent to Cambodia such as [[Surin province]], the Cardamom Mountains, and in southern Vietnam.&lt;ref name=&quot;SIDWELL&quot; /&gt; The dialects form a [[dialect continuum|continuum]] running roughly north to south. Standard Cambodian Khmer is mutually intelligible with the others but a [[Khmer Krom]] speaker from Vietnam, for instance, may have great difficulty communicating with a Khmer native to [[Sisaket Province]] in Thailand.

The following classification of Khmer dialects is from Ferlus (1992),&lt;ref&gt;Ferlus, Michel. 1992. Essai de phonétique historique du khmer (Du milieau du primier millénaire de notre ère à l'époque actuelle). ''Mon-Khmer Studies'' '''2''' (6):7-28.&lt;/ref&gt; as cited in Sidwell (2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidwell2009&quot;&gt;Sidwell, Paul (2009). ''Classifying the Austroasiatic languages: history and state of the art''. LINCOM studies in Asian linguistics, 76. Munich: Lincom Europa.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Middle Khmer
**Cardamom (Western) Khmer
**Central Khmer
***Surin (Northern) Khmer
***Standard Khmer and related dialects

'''[[Northern Khmer]]''', the dialect spoken in Thailand, is referred to in Khmer as ''Khmer Surin'' and, although it only began divergence from standard Khmer within the last 200 years, is considered by some linguists to be a separate language. This is due to its distinct accent influenced by the surrounding tonal language, [[Thai language|Thai]], lexical differences and its phonemic differences in both vowels and distribution of consonants. Final {{IPA|/r/}}, which has become silent in other dialects of Khmer, is pronounced in Northern Khmer.

'''[[Western Khmer]]''', also called [[Cardamom Khmer]], spoken by a small, isolated population in the Cardamom mountain range extending from Cambodia into Thailand, although little studied, is unique in that it maintains a definite system of [[Register (phonology)|vocal register]] that has all but disappeared in other dialects of modern Khmer.&lt;ref name=&quot;SIDWELL&quot; /&gt;

A notable characteristic of '''Phnom Penh''' casual speech is merging or complete [[elision]] of syllables, considered by speakers from other regions as a &quot;relaxed&quot; pronunciation. For instance, &quot;Phnom Penh&quot; will sometimes be shortened to &quot;m'Penh&quot;. Another characteristic of Phnom Penh speech is observed in words with an &quot;r&quot; either as an initial consonant or as the second member of a [[consonant cluster]] (as in the English word &quot;bread&quot;). The &quot;r&quot;, [[Alveolar trill|trilled]] or [[Alveolar tap|flapped]] in other dialects, is either pronounced as an [[uvular trill]] or not pronounced at all. This alters the quality of any preceding consonant causing a harder, more emphasized pronunciation. Another unique result is that the syllable is spoken with a low-rising or &quot;dipping&quot; [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] much like the &quot;hỏi&quot; tone in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. For example, some people pronounce {{IPA|/trəj/}} (meaning &quot;fish&quot;) as {{IPA|/təj/}}, the &quot;r&quot; is dropped and the vowel begins by dipping much lower in tone than standard speech and then rises, effectively doubling its length. Another example is the word {{IPA|/riən/}} (&quot;study, learn&quot;). It is pronounced {{IPA|/ʀiən/}}, with the &quot;uvular r&quot; and the same intonation described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistic Diversity and National Unity: Language Ecology in Thailand |author= William Allen A. Smalley|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago|isbn=0226762882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social registers==
Khmer employs a system of [[register (linguistics)|registers]] in which the speaker must always be conscious of the social status of the person spoken to. The different registers, which include those used for common speech, polite speech, speaking to or about royals and speaking to or about monks, employ alternate verbs, names of body parts and pronouns. This results in what appears to foreigners as separate languages and, in fact, isolated villagers often are unsure how to speak with royals and royals raised completely within the court do not feel comfortable speaking the common register. Another result is that the pronominal system is complex and full of honorific variations.

As an example, the word for &quot;to eat&quot; used between intimates or in reference to animals is {{IPA|/siː/}}. Used in polite reference to commoners, it's {{IPA|/ɲam/}}. When used of those of higher social status, it's {{IPA|/pisa/}} or {{IPA|/tɔtuəl tiən/}}. For monks the word is {{IPA|/cʰan/}} and for royals, {{IPA|/saoj/}}.&lt;ref name =&quot;cl&quot;/&gt;

==Writing system==
{{Main|Khmer script}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:khmer mul.jpg|frame|right|Example of Khmer script]] --&gt;
Khmer is written with the Khmer script, an [[abugida]] developed from the [[Pallava script]] of India before the 7th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;OMNI&quot;&gt;[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/khmer.htm Khmer Alphabet at Omniglot.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Khmer script is similar in appearance and usage to both [[Thai script|Thai]] and [[Lao script|Lao]], which were based on the Khmer system, and is distantly related to the [[Burmese script]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OMNI&quot;/&gt; [[Khmer numerals]], which were inherited from Indian numerals, are used more widely than [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]]. The Khmer script is also used within Cambodia to transcribe hill tribe languages that have no writing system.&lt;ref name=&quot;HUFF&quot; /&gt;

The '''central processing unit''' ('''CPU''') is the portion of a [[computer]] system that carries out the instructions of a [[computer program]], and is the primary element carrying out the functions of the computer or other processing device. The central processing unit carries out each [[Instruction (computer science)|instruction]] of the program in sequence, to perform the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of the system.  This term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;weik1961&quot;&gt;{{cite paper | author = Weik, Martin H. | title = A Third Survey of Domestic Electronic Digital Computing Systems | publisher = [[Ballistics Research Laboratory|Ballistic Research Laboratories]] | url = http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/BRL61.html | date = 1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The form, design and implementation of CPUs have changed dramatically since the earliest examples, but their fundamental operation remains much the same.

Early CPUs were custom-designed as a part of a larger, sometimes one-of-a-kind, computer. However, this costly method of [[designing]] custom CPUs for a particular application has largely given way to the development of mass-produced  processors that are made for one or many purposes.  This standardization trend generally began in the era of discrete [[transistor]] [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]] and [[minicomputer]]s and has rapidly accelerated with the popularization of the [[integrated circuit]] (IC).  The IC has allowed increasingly complex CPUs to be designed and manufactured to tolerances on the order of [[nanometer]]s. Both the miniaturization and standardization of CPUs have increased the presence of these digital devices in modern life far beyond the limited application of dedicated computing machines. Modern microprocessors appear in everything from [[automobile]]s to [[cell phone]]s and children's toys.

==History==
{{Main|History of general purpose CPUs}}
[[Image:Edvac.jpg|thumb|[[EDVAC]], one of the first electronic stored program computers.]]

Computers such as the [[ENIAC]] had to be physically rewired in order to perform different tasks, which caused these machines to be called &quot;fixed-program computers.&quot; Since the term &quot;CPU&quot; is generally defined as a [[software]] (computer program) execution device, the earliest devices that could rightly be called CPUs came with the advent of the stored-program computer.

The idea of a stored-program computer was already present in the design of [[J. Presper Eckert]] and [[John William Mauchly]]'s ENIAC, but was initially omitted so the machine could be finished sooner.  On June 30, 1945, before ENIAC was completed, mathematician [[John von Neumann]] distributed the paper entitled ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]''.  It outlined the design of a stored-program computer that would eventually be completed in August 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | author = [[John von Neumann|Von Neumann, John]] | title = First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC | publisher = Moore School of Electrical Engineering, [[University of Pennsylvania]] | url = http://www.virtualtravelog.net/entries/2003-08-TheFirstDraft.pdf | date = 1945 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EDVAC was designed to perform a certain number of instructions (or operations) of various types.  These instructions could be combined to create useful programs for the EDVAC to run.  Significantly, the programs written for EDVAC were stored in high-speed [[Memory (computers)|computer memory]] rather than specified by the physical wiring of the computer.  This overcame a severe limitation of ENIAC, which was the considerable time and effort required to reconfigure the computer to perform a new task.  With von Neumann's design, the program, or software, that EDVAC ran could be changed simply by changing the contents of the computer's memory.

While von Neumann is most often credited with the design of the stored-program computer because of his design of EDVAC, others before him, such as [[Konrad Zuse]], had suggested and implemented similar ideas.  The so-called [[Harvard architecture]] of the [[Harvard Mark I]], which was completed before EDVAC, also utilized a stored-program design using [[Punched tape|punched paper tape]] rather than electronic memory.  The key difference between the von Neumann and Harvard architectures is that the latter separates the storage and treatment of CPU instructions and data, while the former uses the same memory space for both.  Most modern CPUs are primarily von Neumann in design, but elements of the Harvard architecture are commonly seen as well.

As a [[digital]] device, a CPU is limited to a set of discrete states, and requires some kind of switching elements to differentiate between and change states.  Prior to commercial development of the transistor, [[Relay|electrical relays]] and [[vacuum tube]]s (thermionic valves) were commonly used as switching elements.  Although these had distinct speed advantages over earlier, purely mechanical designs, they were unreliable for various reasons.  For example, building [[direct current]] [[sequential logic]] circuits out of relays requires additional hardware to cope with the problem of [[Switch#Contact bounce|contact bounce]].  While vacuum tubes do not suffer from contact bounce, they must heat up before becoming fully operational, and they eventually cease to function due to slow contamination of their cathodes that occurs in the course of normal operation.  If a tube's vacuum seal leaks, as sometimes happens, cathode contamination is accelerated. Usually, when a tube failed, the CPU would have to be diagnosed to locate the failed component so it could be replaced.  Therefore, early electronic (vacuum tube based) computers were generally faster but less reliable than electromechanical (relay based) computers.

Tube computers like [[EDVAC]] tended to average eight hours between failures, whereas relay computers like the (slower, but earlier) [[Harvard Mark I]] failed very rarely.&lt;ref name=&quot;weik1961&quot; /&gt;  In the end, tube based CPUs became dominant because the significant speed advantages afforded generally outweighed the reliability problems.  Most of these early synchronous CPUs ran at low [[clock rate]]s compared to modern microelectronic designs (see below for a discussion of clock rate).  Clock signal frequencies ranging from 100 [[Hertz|kHz]] to 4&amp;nbsp;MHz were very common at this time, limited largely by the speed of the switching devices they were built with.

==The Control Unit==
The control unit of the CPU contains circuitry that uses electrical signals to direct the entire computer system to carry out, stored program instructions.The control unit does not execute program instructions; rather, it directs other parts of the system to do so. The control unit must communicate with both the arithmetic/logic unit and memory. 

===Discrete transistor and integrated circuit CPUs===
[[Image:PDP-8i cpu.jpg|thumb|CPU, [[Magnetic core memory|core memory]], and [[external bus interface]] of a DEC [[PDP-8]]/I. made of medium-scale integrated circuits]]

The design complexity of CPUs increased as various technologies facilitated building smaller and more reliable electronic devices.  The first such improvement came with the advent of the [[transistor]].  Transistorized CPUs during the 1950s and 1960s no longer had to be built out of bulky, unreliable, and fragile switching elements like [[vacuum tube]]s and [[Relay|electrical relays]].  With this improvement more complex and reliable CPUs were built onto one or several [[printed circuit board]]s containing discrete (individual) components.

During this period, a method of manufacturing many transistors in a compact space gained popularity. The [[integrated circuit]] ('''IC''') allowed a large number of transistors to be manufactured on a single [[semiconductor]]-based [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]], or &quot;chip.&quot;  At first only very basic non-specialized digital circuits such as [[NOR gate]]s were miniaturized into ICs.  CPUs based upon these &quot;building block&quot; ICs are generally referred to as &quot;small-scale integration&quot; ('''SSI''') devices.  SSI ICs, such as the ones used in the [[Apollo guidance computer]], usually contained transistor counts numbering in multiples of ten.  To build an entire CPU out of SSI ICs required thousands of individual chips, but still consumed much less space and power than earlier discrete transistor designs.  As microelectronic technology advanced, an increasing number of transistors were placed on ICs, thus decreasing the quantity of individual ICs needed for a complete CPU.  '''MSI''' and '''LSI''' (medium- and large-scale integration) ICs increased transistor counts to hundreds, and then thousands.

In 1964 [[IBM]] introduced its [[System/360]] computer architecture which was used in a series of computers that could run the same programs with different speed and performance.  This was significant at a time when most electronic computers were incompatible with one another, even those made by the same manufacturer.  To facilitate this improvement, IBM utilized the concept of a [[microprogram]] (often called &quot;microcode&quot;), which still sees widespread usage in modern CPUs.&lt;ref name=&quot;amdahl1964&quot;&gt;{{cite paper | author = [[Gene Amdahl|Amdahl, G. M.]], Blaauw, G. A., &amp; Brooks, F. P. Jr. | title = Architecture of the IBM System/360 | publisher = IBM Research | date = 1964 | url = http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/441/amdahl.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The System/360 architecture was so popular that it dominated the [[mainframe computer]] market for decades and left a legacy that is still continued by similar modern computers like the IBM [[zSeries]].  In the same year (1964), [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) introduced another influential computer aimed at the scientific and research markets, the [[PDP-8]].  DEC would later introduce the extremely popular [[PDP-11]] line that originally was built with SSI ICs but was eventually implemented with LSI components once these became practical.  In stark contrast with its SSI and MSI predecessors, the first LSI implementation of the PDP-11 contained a CPU composed of only four LSI integrated circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] | year = 1975 | month = November | title = LSI-11, PDP-11/03 user's manual | chapter = LSI-11 Module Descriptions | edition = 2nd | pages = 4–3 | publisher = Digital Equipment Corporation | location = Maynard, Massachusetts | url = http://www.classiccmp.org/bitsavers/pdf/dec/pdp11/1103/EK-LSI11-TM-002.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transistor-based computers had several distinct advantages over their predecessors.  Aside from facilitating increased reliability and lower power consumption, transistors also allowed CPUs to operate at much higher speeds because of the short switching time of a transistor in comparison to a tube or relay.  Thanks to both the increased reliability as well as the dramatically increased speed of the switching elements (which were almost exclusively transistors by this time), CPU clock rates in the tens of megahertz were obtained during this period.  Additionally while discrete transistor and IC CPUs were in heavy usage, new high-performance designs like [[SIMD]] (Single Instruction Multiple Data) [[vector processor]]s began to appear.  These early experimental designs later gave rise to the era of specialized [[supercomputer]]s like those made by [[Cray Inc.]]

===Microprocessors===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}
{{Main|Microprocessor}}
[[Image:153056995 5ef8b01016 o.jpg|thumb|The [[die (integrated circuit)|die]] from an [[Intel]] 8742]]
[[Image:Intel 80486DX2 bottom.jpg|thumb|[[Intel 80486DX2]] microprocessor in a ceramic [[Pin grid array|PGA]] package.]]

The introduction of the [[microprocessor]] in the 1970s significantly affected the design and implementation of CPUs.  Since the introduction of the first commercially available microprocessor (the [[Intel 4004]]) in 1970 and the first widely used microprocessor (the [[Intel 8080]]) in 1974, this class of CPUs has almost completely overtaken all other central processing unit implementation methods. Mainframe and minicomputer manufacturers of the time launched proprietary IC development programs to upgrade their older [[computer architecture]]s, and eventually produced [[instruction set]] compatible microprocessors that were backward-compatible with their older hardware and software. Combined with the advent and eventual vast success of the now ubiquitous [[personal computer]], the term ''CPU'' is now applied almost exclusively to microprocessors. Several CPUs can be combined in a single processing chip.

Previous generations of CPUs were implemented as discrete components and numerous small [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) on one or more circuit boards.  Microprocessors, on the other hand, are CPUs manufactured on a very small number of ICs; usually just one.  The overall smaller CPU size as a result of being implemented on a single die means faster switching time because of physical factors like decreased gate [[parasitic capacitance]].  This has allowed synchronous microprocessors to have clock rates ranging from tens of megahertz to several gigahertz.  Additionally, as the ability to construct exceedingly small transistors on an IC has increased, the complexity and number of transistors in a single CPU has increased dramatically.  This widely observed trend is described by [[Moore's law]], which has proven to be a fairly accurate predictor of the growth of CPU (and other IC) complexity to date.

While the complexity, size, construction, and general form of CPUs have changed drastically over the past sixty years, it is notable that the basic design and function has not changed much at all.  Almost all common CPUs today can be very accurately described as von Neumann stored-program machines. As the aforementioned Moore's law continues to hold true, concerns have arisen about the limits of integrated circuit transistor technology.  Extreme miniaturization of electronic gates is causing the effects of phenomena like [[electromigration]] and [[subthreshold leakage]] to become much more significant.  These newer concerns are among the many factors causing researchers to investigate new methods of computing such as the [[quantum computer]], as well as to expand the usage of [[Parallel computing|parallelism]] and other methods that extend the usefulness of the classical von Neumann model.

==Operation==
The fundamental operation of most CPUs, regardless of the physical form they take, is to execute a sequence of stored instructions called a program. The program is represented by a series of numbers that are kept in some kind of [[Memory (computers)|computer memory]].  There are four steps that nearly all CPUs use in their operation: '''fetch''', '''decode''', '''execute''', and '''writeback'''.

The first step, '''fetch''', involves retrieving an [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]] (which is represented by a number or sequence of numbers) from program memory.  The location in program memory is determined by a [[program counter]] (PC), which stores a number that identifies the current position in the program. After an instruction is fetched, the PC is incremented by the length of the instruction word in terms of memory units.&lt;ref&gt;Since the program counter counts ''memory addresses'' and not ''instructions,'' it is incremented by the number of memory units that the instruction word contains. In the case of simple fixed-length instruction word ISAs, this is always the same number.  For example, a fixed-length 32-bit instruction word ISA that uses 8-bit memory words would always increment the PC by 4 (except in the case of jumps).  ISAs that use variable length instruction words,increment the PC by the number of memory words corresponding to the last instruction's length.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, the instruction to be fetched must be retrieved from relatively slow memory, causing the CPU to stall while waiting for the instruction to be returned.  This issue is largely addressed in modern processors by caches and pipeline architectures (see below).

The instruction that the CPU fetches from memory is used to determine what the CPU is to do.  In the '''decode''' step, the instruction is broken up into parts that have significance to other portions of the CPU.  The way in which the numerical instruction value is interpreted is defined by the CPU's instruction set architecture ('''ISA''').&lt;ref&gt;Because the instruction set architecture of a CPU is fundamental to its interface and usage, it is often used as a classification of the &quot;type&quot; of CPU.  For example, a &quot;PowerPC CPU&quot; uses some variant of the PowerPC ISA. A system can execute a different ISA by running an emulator.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, one group of numbers in the instruction, called the opcode, indicates which operation to perform.  The remaining parts of the number usually provide information required for that instruction, such as operands for an addition operation.  Such operands may be given as a constant value (called an immediate value), or as a place to locate a value: a [[processor register|register]] or a memory address, as determined by some [[addressing mode]].  In older designs the portions of the CPU responsible for instruction decoding were unchangeable hardware devices.  However, in more abstract and complicated CPUs and ISAs, a microprogram is often used to assist in translating instructions into various configuration signals for the CPU.  This microprogram is sometimes rewritable so that it can be modified to change the way the CPU decodes instructions even after it has been manufactured.

After the fetch and decode steps, the '''execute''' step is performed.  During this step, various portions of the CPU are connected so they can perform the desired operation.  If, for instance, an addition operation was requested, the [[arithmetic logic unit]] ('''ALU''') will be connected to a set of inputs and a set of outputs.  The inputs provide the numbers to be added, and the outputs will contain the final sum.  The ALU contains the circuitry to perform simple arithmetic and logical operations on the inputs (like addition and [[bitwise operations]]).  If the addition operation produces a result too large for the CPU to handle, an arithmetic overflow flag in a flags register may also be set.

The final step, '''writeback''', simply &quot;writes back&quot; the results of the execute step to some form of memory.  Very often the results are written to some internal CPU register for quick access by subsequent instructions.  In other cases results may be written to slower, but cheaper and larger, [[Random access memory|main memory]].  Some types of instructions manipulate the program counter rather than directly produce result data. These are generally called &quot;jumps&quot; and facilitate behavior like [[Control flow#Loops|loops]], conditional program execution (through the use of a conditional jump), and [[Subroutine|functions]] in programs.&lt;ref&gt;Some early computers like the Harvard Mark I did not support any kind of &quot;jump&quot; instruction, effectively limiting the complexity of the programs they could run.  It is largely for this reason that these computers are often not considered to contain a CPU proper, despite their close similarity as stored program computers.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many instructions will also change the state of digits in a &quot;flags&quot; register. These flags can be used to influence how a program behaves, since they often indicate the outcome of various operations.  For example, one type of &quot;compare&quot; instruction considers two values and sets a number in the flags register according to which one is greater.  This flag could then be used by a later jump instruction to determine program flow.

After the execution of the instruction and writeback of the resulting data, the entire process repeats, with the next instruction cycle normally fetching the next-in-sequence instruction because of the incremented value in the program counter.  If the completed instruction was a jump, the program counter will be modified to contain the address of the instruction that was jumped to, and program execution continues normally.  In more complex CPUs than the one described here, multiple instructions can be fetched, decoded, and executed simultaneously.  This section describes what is generally referred to as the &quot;Classic RISC pipeline&quot;, which in fact is quite common among the simple CPUs used in many electronic devices (often called microcontroller). It largely ignores the important role of [[CPU cache]], and therefore the '''access''' stage of the pipeline.

==Design and implementation==
{{Main|CPU design}}
===Integer range===
The way a '''CPU''' represents numbers is a design choice that affects the most basic ways in which the device functions.  Some early digital computers used an electrical model of the common [[decimal]] (base ten) [[numeral system]] to represent numbers internally.  A few other computers have used more exotic numeral systems like [[Balanced ternary|ternary]] (base three). Nearly all modern CPUs represent numbers in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] form, with each digit being represented by some two-valued physical quantity such as a &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; [[volt]]age.&lt;ref&gt;The physical concept of [[voltage]] is an analog one by its nature, practically having an infinite range of possible values.  For the purpose of physical representation of binary numbers, set ranges of voltages are defined as one or zero.  These ranges are usually influenced by the circuit designs and operational parameters of the switching elements used to create the CPU, such as a [[transistor]]'s threshold level.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MOS 6502AD 4585 top.jpg|thumb|left|[[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]] microprocessor in a [[dual in-line package]], an extremely popular 8-bit design.]]

Related to number representation is the size and precision of numbers that a CPU can represent.  In the case of a binary CPU, a '''bit''' refers to one significant place in the numbers a CPU deals with.  The number of bits (or numeral places) a CPU uses to represent numbers is often called &quot;[[Word (data type)|word size]]&quot;, &quot;bit width&quot;, &quot;data path width&quot;, or &quot;integer precision&quot; when dealing with strictly integer numbers (as opposed to [[Floating Point|Floating point]]).  This number differs between architectures, and often within different parts of the very same CPU.  For example, an [[8-bit]] CPU deals with a range of numbers that can be represented by eight binary digits (each digit having two possible values), that is, 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; or 256 discrete numbers.  In effect, integer size sets a hardware limit on the range of integers the software run by the CPU can utilize.&lt;ref&gt;While a CPU's integer size sets a limit on integer ranges, this can (and often is) overcome using a combination of software and hardware techniques.  By using additional memory, software can represent integers many magnitudes larger than the CPU can.  Sometimes the CPU's ISA will even facilitate operations on integers larger than it can natively represent by providing instructions to make large integer arithmetic relatively quick.  While this method of dealing with large integers is somewhat slower than utilizing a CPU with higher integer size, it is a reasonable trade-off in cases where natively supporting the full integer range needed would be cost-prohibitive.  See [[Arbitrary-precision arithmetic]] for more details on purely software-supported arbitrary-sized integers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Integer range can also affect the number of locations in memory the CPU can '''address''' (locate).  For example, if a binary CPU uses 32 bits to represent a memory address, and each memory address represents one [[octet (computing)|octet]] (8 bits), the maximum quantity of memory that CPU can address is 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; octets, or 4 [[GiB]].  This is a very simple view of CPU [[address space]], and many designs use more complex addressing methods like [[Bank switching|paging]] in order to locate more memory than their integer range would allow with a flat address space.

Higher levels of integer range require more structures to deal with the additional digits, and therefore more complexity, size, power usage, and general expense.  It is not at all uncommon, therefore, to see 4- or 8-bit [[microcontroller]]s used in modern applications, even though CPUs with much higher range (such as 16, 32, 64, even 128-bit) are available.  The simpler microcontrollers are usually cheaper, use less power, and therefore dissipate less heat, all of which can be major design considerations for electronic devices.  However, in higher-end applications, the benefits afforded by the extra range (most often the additional address space) are more significant and often affect design choices.  To gain some of the advantages afforded by both lower and higher bit lengths, many CPUs are designed with different bit widths for different portions of the device.  For example, the IBM [[System/370]] used a CPU that was primarily 32 bit, but it used 128-bit precision inside its [[floating point]] units to facilitate greater accuracy and range in floating point numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;amdahl1964&quot; /&gt; Many later CPU designs use similar mixed bit width, especially when the processor is meant for general-purpose usage where a reasonable balance of integer and floating point capability is required.

===Clock rate===
{{Main|Clock rate}}

The clock rate is the speed at which a microprocessor executes instructions. Every computer  contains an internal clock that regulates the rate at which instructions are executed and synchronizes all the various computer components. The CPU  requires a fixed number of clock ticks (or clock cycles) to execute each instruction. The faster the clock, the more instructions the CPU can execute per second.

Most CPUs, and indeed most [[sequential logic]] devices, are [[Synchronous circuit|synchronous]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, all synchronous CPUs use a combination of [[sequential logic]] and [[combinational logic]].  (See [[boolean logic]])&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, they are designed and operate on assumptions about a synchronization signal.  This signal, known as a '''clock signal''', usually takes the form of a periodic [[square wave]].  By calculating the maximum time that electrical signals can move in various branches of a CPU's many circuits, the designers can select an appropriate [[Frequency|period]] for the clock signal.

This period must be longer than the amount of time it takes for a signal to move, or propagate, in the worst-case scenario.  In setting the clock period to a value well above the worst-case [[propagation delay]], it is possible to design the entire CPU and the way it moves data around the &quot;edges&quot; of the rising and falling clock signal.  This has the advantage of simplifying the CPU significantly, both from a design perspective and a component-count perspective.  However, it also carries the disadvantage that the entire CPU must wait on its slowest elements, even though some portions of it are much faster.  This limitation has largely been compensated for by various methods of increasing CPU parallelism. (see below)

However, architectural improvements alone do not solve all of the drawbacks of globally synchronous CPUs.  For example, a clock signal is subject to the delays of any other electrical signal.  Higher clock rates in increasingly complex CPUs make it more difficult to keep the clock signal in phase (synchronized) throughout the entire unit.  This has led many modern CPUs to require multiple identical clock signals to be provided in order to avoid delaying a single signal significantly enough to cause the CPU to malfunction.  Another major issue as clock rates increase dramatically is the amount of heat that is dissipated by the CPU.  The constantly changing clock causes many components to switch regardless of whether they are being used at that time.  In general, a component that is switching uses more energy than an element in a static state.  Therefore, as clock rate increases, so does heat dissipation, causing the CPU to require more effective cooling solutions.

One method of dealing with the switching of unneeded components is called [[clock gating]], which involves turning off the clock signal to unneeded components (effectively disabling them).  However, this is often regarded as difficult to implement and therefore does not see common usage outside of very low-power designs. One notable late CPU design that uses clock gating is that of the IBM [[PowerPC]]-based [[Xbox 360]].  It utilizes extensive clock gating in order to reduce the power requirements of the aforementioned videogame console in which it is used. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Brown | first = Jeffery | title = Application-customized CPU design | publisher = IBM developerWorks | url = http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-fpfxbox/?ca=dgr-lnxw07XBoxDesign | year = 2005 | accessdate = 2005-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another method of addressing some of the problems with a global clock signal is the removal of the clock signal altogether.  While removing the global clock signal makes the design process considerably more complex in many ways, asynchronous (or clockless) designs carry marked advantages in power consumption and heat dissipation in comparison with similar synchronous designs.  While somewhat uncommon, entire [[Asynchronous_circuit#Asynchronous_CPU|asynchronous CPU]]s have been built without utilizing a global clock signal.  Two notable examples of this are the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] compliant [[AMULET microprocessor|AMULET]] and the [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] R3000 compatible MiniMIPS.  Rather than totally removing the clock signal, some CPU designs allow certain portions of the device to be asynchronous, such as using asynchronous [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALUs]] in conjunction with superscalar pipelining to achieve some arithmetic performance gains.  While it is not altogether clear whether totally asynchronous designs can perform at a comparable or better level than their synchronous counterparts, it is evident that they do at least excel in simpler math operations.  This, combined with their excellent power consumption and heat dissipation properties, makes them very suitable for [[embedded computer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | author = Garside, J. D., Furber, S. B., &amp; Chung, S-H | title = AMULET3 Revealed | publisher = [[University of Manchester]] Computer Science Department | date = 1999 | url = http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/apt/publications/papers/async99_A3.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parallelism===
{{Main|Parallel computing}}
[[Image:Nopipeline.png|thumb|Model of a subscalar CPU. Notice that it takes fifteen cycles to complete three instructions.]]

The description of the basic operation of a CPU offered in the previous section describes the simplest form that a CPU can take.  This type of CPU, usually referred to as '''subscalar''', operates on and executes one instruction on one or two pieces of data at a time.

This process gives rise to an inherent inefficiency in subscalar CPUs.  Since only one instruction is executed at a time, the entire CPU must wait for that instruction to complete before proceeding to the next instruction.  As a result the subscalar CPU gets &quot;hung up&quot; on instructions which take more than one clock cycle to complete execution.  Even adding a second execution unit (see below) does not improve performance much; rather than one pathway being hung up, now two pathways are hung up and the number of unused transistors is increased.  This design, wherein the CPU's execution resources can operate on only one instruction at a time, can only possibly reach '''scalar''' performance (one instruction per clock). However, the performance is nearly always subscalar (less than one instruction per cycle).

Attempts to achieve scalar and better performance have resulted in a variety of design methodologies that cause the CPU to behave less linearly and more in parallel.  When referring to parallelism in CPUs, two terms are generally used to classify these design techniques.  [[Instruction level parallelism]] (ILP) seeks to increase the rate at which instructions are executed within a CPU (that is, to increase the utilization of on-die execution resources), and [[thread level parallelism]] (TLP) purposes to increase the number of [[Thread (computer science)|threads]] (effectively individual programs) that a CPU can execute simultaneously.  Each methodology differs both in the ways in which they are implemented, as well as the relative effectiveness they afford in increasing the CPU's performance for an application.&lt;ref&gt;Neither [[Instruction level parallelism|ILP]] nor [[Thread level parallelism|TLP]] is inherently superior over the other; they are simply different means by which to increase CPU parallelism.  As such, they both have advantages and disadvantages, which are often determined by the type of software that the processor is intended to run.  High-TLP CPUs are often used in applications that lend themselves well to being split up into numerous smaller applications, so-called &quot;[[embarrassingly parallel]] problems&quot;.  Frequently, a computational problem that can be solved quickly with high TLP design strategies like SMP take significantly more time on high ILP devices like superscalar CPUs, and vice versa.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Instruction level parallelism====
{{Main|Instruction pipelining|Superscalar}}
[[Image:Fivestagespipeline.png|thumb|left|Basic five-stage pipeline. In the best case scenario, this pipeline can sustain a completion rate of one instruction per cycle.]]

One of the simplest methods used to accomplish increased parallelism is to begin the first steps of instruction fetching and decoding before the prior instruction finishes executing.  This is the simplest form of a technique known as '''[[instruction pipelining]]''', and is utilized in almost all modern general-purpose CPUs.  Pipelining allows more than one instruction to be executed at any given time by breaking down the execution pathway into discrete stages. This separation can be compared to an assembly line, in which an instruction is made more complete at each stage until it exits the execution pipeline and is retired.

Pipelining does, however, introduce the possibility for a situation where the result of the previous operation is needed to complete the next operation; a condition often termed data dependency conflict.  To cope with this, additional care must be taken to check for these sorts of conditions and delay a portion of the instruction pipeline if this occurs.  Naturally, accomplishing this requires additional circuitry, so pipelined processors are more complex than subscalar ones (though not very significantly so). A pipelined processor can become very nearly scalar, inhibited only by pipeline stalls (an instruction spending more than one clock cycle in a stage).

[[Image:Superscalarpipeline.svg|thumb|Simple superscalar pipeline. By fetching and dispatching two instructions at a time, a maximum of two instructions per cycle can be completed.]]

Further improvement upon the idea of instruction pipelining led to the development of a method that decreases the idle time of CPU components even further.  Designs that are said to be '''superscalar''' include a long instruction pipeline and multiple identical execution units. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Huynh | first = Jack | title = The AMD Athlon XP Processor with 512KB L2 Cache | publisher = University of Illinois&amp;nbsp;— Urbana-Champaign | pages = 6–11 | url = http://courses.ece.uiuc.edu/ece512/Papers/Athlon.pdf | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2007-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a superscalar pipeline, multiple instructions are read and passed to a dispatcher, which decides whether or not the instructions can be executed in parallel (simultaneously).  If so they are dispatched to available execution units, resulting in the ability for several instructions to be executed simultaneously.  In general, the more instructions a superscalar CPU is able to dispatch simultaneously to waiting execution units, the more instructions will be completed in a given cycle.

Most of the difficulty in the design of a superscalar CPU architecture lies in creating an effective dispatcher.  The dispatcher needs to be able to quickly and correctly determine whether instructions can be executed in parallel, as well as dispatch them in such a way as to keep as many execution units busy as possible.  This requires that the instruction pipeline is filled as often as possible and gives rise to the need in superscalar architectures for significant amounts of [[CPU cache]].  It also makes [[Hazard (computer architecture)|hazard]]-avoiding techniques like [[branch prediction]], [[speculative execution]], and [[out-of-order execution]] crucial to maintaining high levels of performance.  By attempting to predict which branch (or path) a conditional instruction will take, the CPU can minimize the number of times that the entire pipeline must wait until a conditional instruction is completed.  Speculative execution often provides modest performance increases by executing portions of code that may not be needed after a conditional operation completes.  Out-of-order execution somewhat rearranges the order in which instructions are executed to reduce delays due to data dependencies. Also in case of Single Instructions Multiple Data&amp;nbsp;— a case when a lot of data from the same type has to be processed, modern processors can disable parts of the pipeline so that when a single  instruction is executed many times, the CPU skips the fetch and decode phases and thus greatly increasing performance on certain occasions, especially in highly monotonous program engines such as video creation software and photo processing.

In the case where a portion of the CPU is superscalar and part is not, the part which is not suffers a performance penalty due to scheduling stalls. The Intel [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] had two superscalar ALUs which could accept one instruction per clock each, but its FPU could not accept one instruction per clock. Thus the P5 was integer superscalar but not floating point superscalar.  Intel's successor to the P5 architecture, [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]], added superscalar capabilities to its floating point features, and therefore afforded a significant increase in floating point instruction performance.

Both simple pipelining and superscalar design increase a CPU's ILP by allowing a single processor to complete execution of instructions at rates surpassing one instruction per cycle ('''IPC''').&lt;ref&gt;Best-case scenario (or peak) IPC rates in very superscalar architectures are difficult to maintain since it is impossible to keep the instruction pipeline filled all the time.  Therefore, in highly superscalar CPUs, average sustained IPC is often discussed rather than peak IPC.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most modern CPU designs are at least somewhat superscalar, and nearly all general purpose CPUs designed in the last decade are superscalar.  In later years some of the emphasis in designing high-ILP computers has been moved out of the CPU's hardware and into its software interface, or [[Instruction_set|ISA]].  The strategy of the [[very long instruction word]] (VLIW) causes some ILP to become implied directly by the software, reducing the amount of work the CPU must perform to boost ILP and thereby reducing the design's complexity.

====Thread-level parallelism====
Another strategy of achieving performance is to execute multiple programs or [[thread (computer science)|threads]] in parallel.
This area of research is known as [[parallel computing]]. In [[Flynn's taxonomy]], this strategy is known as Multiple Instructions-Multiple Data or MIMD.

One technology used for this purpose was [[multiprocessing]] (MP). The initial flavor of this technology is known as [[symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP), where a small number of CPUs share a coherent view of their memory system. In this scheme, each CPU has additional hardware to maintain a constantly up-to-date view of memory. By avoiding stale views of memory, the CPUs can cooperate on the same program and programs can migrate from one CPU to another. To increase the number of cooperating CPUs beyond a handful, schemes such as [[non-uniform memory access]] (NUMA) and [[directory-based coherence protocols]] were introduced in the 1990s. SMP systems are limited to a small number of CPUs while NUMA systems have been built with thousands of processors. Initially, multiprocessing was built using multiple discrete CPUs and boards to implement the interconnect between the processors. When the processors and their interconnect are all implemented on a single silicon chip, the technology is known as a [[Multi-core (computing)|multi-core]] microprocessor.

It was later recognized that finer-grain parallelism existed with a single program. A single program might have several threads (or functions) that could be executed separately or in parallel. Some of earliest examples of this technology implemented [[input/output]] processing such as [[direct memory access]] as a separate thread from the computation thread. A more general approach to this technology was introduced in the 1970s when systems were designed to run multiple computation threads in parallel. This technology is known as [[Multithreading (computer architecture)|multi-threading]] (MT). This approach is considered more cost-effective than multiprocessing, as only a small number of components within a CPU is replicated in order to support MT as opposed to the entire CPU in the case of MP. In MT, the execution units and the memory system including the caches are shared among multiple threads. The downside of MT is that the hardware support for multithreading is more visible to software than that of MP and thus supervisor software like operating systems have to undergo larger changes to support MT.  One type of MT that was implemented is known as block multithreading, where one thread is executed until it is stalled waiting for data to return from external memory. In this scheme, the CPU would then quickly switch to another thread which is ready to run, the switch often done in one CPU clock cycle, such as the [[UltraSPARC T1|UltraSPARC]] Technology. Another type of MT is known as [[simultaneous multithreading]], where instructions of multiple threads are executed in parallel within one CPU clock cycle.

For several decades from the 1970s to early 2000s, the focus in designing high performance general purpose CPUs was largely on achieving high ILP through technologies such as pipelining, caches, superscalar execution, out-of-order execution, etc. This trend culminated in large, power-hungry CPUs such as the Intel [[Pentium 4]]. By the early 2000s, CPU designers were thwarted from achieving higher performance from ILP techniques due to the growing disparity between CPU operating frequencies and main memory operating frequencies as well as escalating CPU power dissipation owing to more esoteric ILP techniques.

CPU designers then borrowed ideas from commercial computing markets such as [[transaction processing]], where the aggregate performance of multiple programs, also known as [[throughput]] computing, was more important than the performance of a single thread or program.

This reversal of emphasis is evidenced by the proliferation of dual and multiple core CMP (chip-level multiprocessing) designs and notably, Intel's newer designs resembling its less superscalar [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]] architecture.  Late designs in several processor families exhibit CMP, including the [[x86-64]] [[Opteron]] and [[Athlon 64 X2]], the [[SPARC]] [[UltraSPARC T1]], IBM [[POWER4]] and [[POWER5]], as well as several [[video game console]] CPUs like the [[Xbox 360]]'s triple-core PowerPC design, and the [[PS3]]'s 7-core [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell microprocessor]].

====Data parallelism====
{{Main|Vector processor|SIMD}}

A less common but increasingly important paradigm of CPUs (and indeed, computing in general) deals with data parallelism.  The processors discussed earlier are all referred to as some type of scalar device.&lt;ref&gt;Earlier the term scalar was used to compare the IPC (instructions per cycle) count afforded by various ILP methods.  Here the term is used in the strictly mathematical sense to contrast with vectors.  See [[scalar (mathematics)]] and [[Vector (geometric)]].&lt;/ref&gt;  As the name implies, vector processors deal with multiple pieces of data in the context of one instruction.  This contrasts with scalar processors, which deal with one piece of data for every instruction.  Using [[Flynn's taxonomy]], these two schemes of dealing with data are generally referred to as [[SIMD]] (single instruction, multiple data) and [[SISD]] (single instruction, single data), respectively.  The great utility in creating CPUs that deal with vectors of data lies in optimizing tasks that tend to require the same operation (for example, a sum or a [[dot product]]) to be performed on a large set of data.  Some classic examples of these types of tasks are [[multimedia]] applications (images, video, and sound), as well as many types of [[Scientific computing|scientific]] and engineering tasks.  Whereas a scalar CPU must complete the entire process of fetching, decoding, and executing each instruction and value in a set of data, a vector CPU can perform a single operation on a comparatively large set of data with one instruction.  Of course, this is only possible when the application tends to require many steps which apply one operation to a large set of data.

Most early vector CPUs, such as the [[Cray-1]], were associated almost exclusively with scientific research and [[cryptography]] applications.  However, as multimedia has largely shifted to digital media, the need for some form of SIMD in general-purpose CPUs has become significant.  Shortly after [[Floating point unit|floating point execution units]] started to become commonplace to include in general-purpose processors, specifications for and implementations of SIMD execution units also began to appear for general-purpose CPUs.  Some of these early SIMD specifications like HP's [[Multimedia Acceleration eXtensions]] (MAX) and Intel's [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]] were integer-only.  This proved to be a significant impediment for some software developers, since many of the applications that benefit from SIMD primarily deal with [[floating point]] numbers.  Progressively, these early designs were refined and remade into some of the common, modern SIMD specifications, which are usually associated with one ISA.  Some notable modern examples are Intel's [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] and the PowerPC-related [[AltiVec]] (also known as VMX).&lt;ref&gt;Although SSE/SSE2/SSE3 have superseded MMX in Intel's general purpose CPUs, later [[IA-32]] designs still support MMX.  This is usually accomplished by providing most of the MMX functionality with the same hardware that supports the much more expansive SSE instruction sets.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
The ''performance'' or ''speed'' of a processor depends on the clock rate (generally given in multiples of [[hertz]]) and the instructions per clock (IPC), which together are the factors for the [[instructions per second]] (IPS) that the CPU can perform.&lt;ref name='Freq'&gt;{{Cite web

  | date = 25 March 2008
  | url = http://www.cpu-world.com/Glossary/C/CPU_Frequency.html
  | accessdate = 1 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many reported IPS values have represented &quot;peak&quot; execution rates on artificial instruction sequences with few branches, whereas realistic workloads consist of a mix of instructions and applications, some of which take longer to execute than others. The performance of the [[memory hierarchy]] also greatly affects processor performance, an issue barely considered in MIPS calculations. Because of these problems, various standardized tests such as [[SPECint]] have been developed to attempt to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications.

Processing performance of computers is increased by using [[multi-core processor]]s, which essentially is plugging two or more individual processors (called ''cores'' in this sense) into one [[integrated circuit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tt&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

In practice, however, the performance gain is far less, only about fifty percent,&lt;ref name=&quot;tt&quot; /&gt; due to imperfect software algorithms and implementation.

The diverse [[Order (biology)|order]] '''Carnivora''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|icon|k|ɑr|ˈ|n|ɪ|v|ər|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɑr|n|ɪ|ˈ|v|ɔər|ə}}; from [[Latin (language)|Latin]] ''carō'' (stem ''carn-'') &quot;flesh&quot;, + ''vorāre'' &quot;to devour&quot;) includes over 260 species of [[eutheria|placental]] [[mammal]]s. Its members are formally referred to as ''carnivorans'', while the word &quot;[[carnivore]]&quot; (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating animal. Carnivorans are the most diverse in size of any mammalian order, ranging from the [[Least Weasel|least weasel]] (''Mustela nivalis''), at as little as {{convert|25|g|oz}} and {{convert|11|cm|in}}, to the [[polar bear]] (''Ursus maritimus''), which can weigh up to {{convert|1000|kg|lb}}, to the [[southern elephant seal]] (''Mirounga leonina''), whose adult males weigh up to {{convert|5000|kg|lb}} and measure up to {{convert|6.9|m|ft}} in length.

The first carnivoran was a [[carnivore]], and nearly all carnivorans today primarily eat meat. Some, such as [[Felidae|cats]], [[pinnipeds]], and [[weasels]], are [[obligate carnivores]]. Others, such as [[raccoon]]s and bears, depending on the local habitat, are more [[omnivore|omnivorous]]; the [[giant panda]] is almost exclusively a [[herbivore]], but will take [[fish]], [[Egg (food)|eggs]] and [[insect]]s, while the polar bear's harsh habitat forces it to mainly subsist on prey. Carnivorans have teeth, claws, and binocular vision adapted for catching and eating other animals. Many hunt in packs and are [[social animal]]s, giving them an advantage over larger prey.

Carnivorans apparently evolved in North America out of members of the family [[Miacidae]] (miacids) about 42 million years ago. They soon split into cat-like and dog-like forms ([[Feliformia]] and [[Caniformia]]).

==Distinguishing features==
[[File:Medved mzoo.jpg|thumb|A [[brown bear]], showing the sharp teeth and claws characteristic of carnivorans]]
Carnivorans are primarily [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] and usually have strong sharp [[claw]]s, with never fewer than four toes on each foot, and well-developed, prominent [[canine teeth]], [[cheek]] teeth ([[premolars]] and [[molars]]) that generally have cutting edges. The last premolar of the upper jaw and first molar of the lower are termed the [[carnassials | carnassials or sectorial]] teeth. These are blade-like teeth that occlude (close) with a scissor-like action for [[wikt:shear|shearing]] and [[wikt:shred|shredding]] meat. Carnassials are most highly developed in the [[Felidae]] and the least developed in the [[Ursidae]]. Carnivorans have six [[incisors]] and two [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] canines in each jaw. The only two exceptions to this are the [[sea otter]] (''Enhydra lutris''), which has four incisors in the lower jaw, and the [[sloth bear]] (''Melursus ursinus''), which has four incisors in the upper jaw. The number of molars and premolars is variable between carnivoran species, but all teeth are deeply rooted and are [[diphyodont]]. Incisors are retained by carnivorans and the third incisor is commonly large and sharp (canine-like). Carnivorans have either four or five digits on each foot, with the first digit on the forepaws, also known as the [[dew claw]], being [[vestigial]] in most species and absent in some.

The [[Canoidea]] superfamily (or [[Caniformia]] suborder) – [[Canidae]] (dogs and foxes), [[Mephitidae]] (skunks and stink badgers), [[Mustelidae]] (weasels), [[Procyonidae]] (raccoons), [[Ursidae]] (bears), [[Otariidae]] (eared seals), [[Odobenidae]] (walrus), and [[Phocidae]] (earless seals) (the last three families formerly classified in the suborder [[Pinnipedia]]) and the extinct family [[Amphicyonidae]] (bear-dogs) – are characterized by having nonchambered or partially chambered [[auditory bullae]], nonretractable claws, and a well-developed [[baculum]]. Most species are rather simply colored, lacking the flashy spotted or rosetted coats like many species of [[felids]] and [[viverrids]] have. This is because Canoidea tend to range in the temperate and subarctic biomes, although Mustelidae and Procyonidae have a few tropical species. Most are terrestrial, although a few species, like procyonids, are arboreal. All families except the Canidae and a few species of Mustelidae are plantigrade. Diet is varied and most tend to be omnivorous to some degree, and thus the carnassial teeth are less specialized. Canoidea have more premolars and molars in an elongated skull.

The [[Feloidea]] superfamily (or [[Feliformia]] suborder)– [[Felidae]] (cats), [[Herpestidae]] (mongooses), [[Hyaenidae]] (hyenas), [[Viverridae]] (civets), and [[Eupleridae]] (Malagasy carnivores), as well as the extinct family [[Nimravidae]] (paleofelids) – often have spotted, rosetted or striped coats, and tend to be more brilliantly colored than their Canoidean counterparts. This is because these species tend to range in tropical habitats, although a few species do inhabit temperate and subarctic habitats. Many are arboreal or semiarboreal, and the majority are digitigrade. Diet tends to be more strictly carnivorous, especially in the Felidae family. They have fewer teeth and shorter skulls, with much more specialized carnassials meant for shearing meat. Felidae claws are retractile, or rarely, semiretractile. The terminal phalanx, with the claw attached, folds back in the fore-foot into a sheath by the outer side of the middle phalanx of the digit, and is retained in this position when at rest by a strong elastic ligament. In the hind-foot, the terminal joint or phalanx is retracted on to the top, and not the side of the middle phalanx. Deep flexor muscles straighten the terminal phalanges, so the claws protrude from their sheaths, and the soft &quot;velvety&quot; paw becomes suddenly converted into a formidable weapon. The habitual retraction of the claws preserves their points from wear.

The [[Pinnipedia]] superfamily (walruses, seals, and sea lions), now considered to be part of Caniformia, are medium to large (to 6.5&amp;nbsp;m) aquatic mammals. Being homeothermic (warm-blooded) marine mammals, pinnipeds need a low surface area to body mass ratio. Otherwise, they would suffer from excessive heat loss due to water's high capacity for heat conduction. The body is usually insulated with a thick layer of fat called [[blubber]] and typically covered with hair. The digits are not separate, but connected by a thick web that forms flippers for swimming; thus, the forelimbs and hindlimbs are transformed into paddles. This enables them to dive at extreme depths (600&amp;nbsp;meters for the [[Weddell seal]]). They can remain underwater for long periods of time, sometimes an hour or more, but most dives are usually short. The facial region of skull is relatively small, with [[pinnae]] very small or lacking, and the [[vibrissae]] are well developed. The molariform teeth are mostly [[homodont]] and the canines are well developed. The tail is very short or absent, the ears are small or absent as well, and the external [[genitalia]] are hidden in slits or depressions in the body.

===Skull structure===
[[File:Hyaena eximia head.jpg|thumb|left|Skull of ''[[Hyaena eximia]]'']]
[[File:Carnassials.jpg|thumb|Carnassials of an [[Italian wolf]]]]

Members of Carnivora have a characteristic skull shape with relatively large brains encased in a heavy skull. The skull has a highly developed [[zygomatic arch]] just behind the [[maxilla]] (common to all mammals and their [[cynodont]] forebears), and they have [[ossified]] external auditory bullae. Feloidea have a two-chambered auditory bullae. In addition to allowing extra room for the passage of muscles to work the lower jaw, the zygomatic arch also allows for differentiation of separate muscle groups to be involved in biting and chewing. [[Masseters]] attach from the dentary (specifically, the [[masseteric fossa]]) to the zygomatic arch and onto the maxilla in front of the arch, providing crushing force. The [[temporalis]] attaches from the dentary (specifically, the [[coronoid process of the mandible|coronoid process]]) to the side of the braincase, providing torque about the axis of jaw articulation. In comparing the skulls of carnivores and herbivores, it can be seen that the shearing force of the temporalis is somewhat more important to carnivores, which have more room on the braincase (this is not unrelated to carnivoran intelligence) and commonly develop a [[sagittal crest]] (running from posterior to anterior on the skull), providing yet additional room for temporalis attachment. Carnivoran jaws can only move on a vertical axis, in an up-and-down motion, and cannot move from side-to-side. The jaw joint in carnivores tends to lie within the plane of tooth occlusion, an arrangement that further emphasizes shearing (as in a pair of scissors). In herbivores, the crushing force of the masseters is relatively more important than is shearing. The jaw joint is generally well above the plane of tooth occlusion, allowing extra room for masseteric attachment on the dentary and causing the rotation of the lower jaw to be translated into straight-ahead crushing force between the teeth of the upper and lower jaws.

===Physiology===
Carnivora have a simple stomach designed to digest primarily meat, as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals, which are necessary to break down tough, complex plant fibers. The [[caecum]] is either absent or short and simple, and the colon is not [[sacculate]]d or much wider than the small intestine. Most species of Carnivora are, to some degree, omnivorous, except the Felidae and Pinnipedia, which are obligate carnivores. Most have highly-developed senses, especially vision and hearing, and often a highly acute sense of smell in many species, such as in the Canoidea. They are excellent runners: some are long-distance runners, but more commonly are sprinters. Even bears and raccoons, although seemingly slow and clumsy, are capable of remarkable bursts of speed.

===Diet specializations===
Carnivorans include [[carnivores]], [[omnivores]], and even a few primarily [[herbivorous]] species, such as the [[giant panda]]. Important teeth for carnivorans are the large, slightly recurved canines, used to dispatch prey, and the carnassial complex, used to rend meat from bone and slice it into digestible pieces. Dogs have molar teeth behind the carnassials for crushing bones, but cats have only a greatly reduced, functionless molar behind the carnassial in the upper jaw. Cats will strip bones clean but will not crush them to get the marrow inside. Omnivores, such as bears and raccoons, have developed blunt, molar-like carnassials. Carnassials are a key adaptation for terrestrial vertebrate predation; all other placental orders are primarily herbivores, insectivores, or aquatic.

===Reproductive system===
[[File:Laitche-P013.jpg|thumb|A [[cat]] with a litter of four [[kitten]]s]]
Carnivorans tend to produce a single litter annually, but some produce multiple litters a year, and larger carnivorans, like bears, have gaps of 2–3 years between litters. The average [[gestation]] period lies between 50 and 115 days, although the ursids and mustelids have delayed implantation, thus extending the gestation period 6–9 months beyond the normal period. Litter sizes are usually small, ranging from 1–13 young, which are born with underdeveloped eyes and ears. In most species, the mother has exclusive or at least primary care of the offspring. Many species of carnivorans are [[solitary (disambiguation)|solitary]], but a few are [[gregarious]].

==Phylogeny==
[[File:Miacis.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's impression of one of the first carnivorans, a [[miacid]]]]

Carnivorans evolved out of members of the [[paraphyletic]] family [[Miacidae]] (miacids). The transition from Miacidae to Carnivora was a general trend in the middle and late [[Eocene]], with taxa from both North America and Eurasia involved. The divergence of carnivorans from other miacids, as well as the divergence of the two [[clade]]s within Carnivora, [[Caniformia]] and [[Feliformia]], is now inferred to have happened in the middle [[Eocene]], about 42 million years ago (mya). Traditionally, the [[Viverravidae]] (viverravids) had been thought to be the earliest carnivorans, with fossil records first appearing in the [[Paleocene]] of North America about 60 mya, but recently described evidence from [[cranium|cranial]] [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] now places them outside the order Carnivora.&lt;ref name=Polly2006&gt;{{cite journal | author = Polly, David, Gina D. Wesley-Hunt, Ronald E.

The Miacidae are not a [[monophyletic]] group, but a [[paraphyletic]] array of stem taxa. Traditionally, the Miacidae and the Viverravidae had been classified in a third, extinct paraphyletic superfamily, the [[Miacoidea]], from which the direct ancestors of both Carnivora and [[Creodonta]] were thought to have arisen. Today, Carnivora is restricted to the [[crown group]], and Carnivora and [[miacoidea|miacoids]] are grouped in the clade [[Carnivoramorpha]], and the miacoids are regarded as basal carnivoramorphs. Based on dental features and braincase sizes, it is now known that Carnivora must have evolved from a form even more primitive than Creodonta, and thus these two orders may not even be sister groups.&lt;ref name=Kemp2005&gt;{{cite book | author = Kemp, T.S. | year = 2005 | title = The Origin and Evolution of Mammals | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-850760-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Carnivora, Creodonta, [[Pholidota]], and a few other extinct orders are informally grouped together in the clade [[Ferae]]. Older classification schemes divided the order into two suborders: [[Fissipedia]] (which included the families of primarily land Carnivora) and [[Pinnipedia]] (which included the [[true seal]]s, [[eared seal]]s, and [[walrus]]). However, it is now recognized that the Fissipedia is a paraphyletic group and that the pinnipeds were not the sister group to the fissipeds but rather had arisen from among them.

Carnivora are generally divided into the suborders Feliformia (cat-like) and Caniformia (dog-like), the latter of which includes the [[pinniped]]s. The pinnipeds are part of a clade, known as the [[Arctoidea]], which also includes the [[Ursidae]] (bears) and the superfamily [[Musteloid]]ea. The Musteloidea in turn consists of the [[Mustelidae]] (mustelids: weasels), [[Procyonidae]] (procyonids: raccoons), [[Mephitidae]] (skunks) and ''[[Ailurus]]''. The oldest caniforms are the ''[[Miacis]]'' species ''Miacis cognitus'', the [[Amphicyonidae]] (bear-dogs) such as ''[[Daphoenus]]'', and ''[[Hesperocyon]]'' (of the family Canidae, subfamily Hesperocyoninae). Hesperocyonine [[canid]]s first appeared in North America, and the earliest species is currently dated at 39.74 mya, but they were not represented in Europe until well into the [[Miocene]], and not into Asia and Africa until the [[Pliocene]]. ''Miacis'' and Amphicyonidae were the first of the caniforms to split from the others and are sometimes considered to be sister groups to Ursidae, but the exact closeness of Amphicyonidae and Ursidae, as well as Arctoidae to Ursidae, is still uncertain. The [[Canidae]] ([[wolves]], [[coyotes]], [[jackals]], [[foxes]] and [[dogs]]) are generally considered to be the sister group to Arctoidea.&lt;ref name=Kemp2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wesley-Hunt2005a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wesley-Hunt2005b&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wesley-Hunt, Gina D. and Lars Werdelin | year = 2005 | title = Basicranial morphology and phylogenetic position of the upper Eocene carnivoramorphan ''Quercygale'' | journal = Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 837–846 | url = http://www.app.pan.pl/acta50/app50-837.pdf |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927203022/http%3A//www.app.pan.pl/acta50/app50-837.pdf |archivedate = September 27, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The updated source of this phylogenic analysis is personal email correspondence with Dr. Gina D. Wesley-Hunt July 25-27 2007 --&gt; The Ursidae first occur in North America in the Late Eocene (ca. 38 mya) as the very small and graceful ''[[Parictis]]'' that had a skull only 7&amp;nbsp;cm long. Like the canids, this family does not appear in [[Eurasia]] and Africa until the Miocene. The other caniform families Amphicyonidae, Mustelidae and Procyonidae occur in both the Old World and the New World by the Late Eocene and Early [[Oligocene]].&lt;ref name=Kemp2005/&gt;

[[File:14-nandinia binotata.JPG|thumb|An [[African palm civet]], possibly an example of a primitive feliform]]

The ancestor of all Feliformia evolved from the Caniformia-Feliformia split, but the exact position of the [[Felidae]], especially some extinct Felidae, in relation to the other families is somewhat disputed. ''[[Nandinia]]'', the African palm civet, seems to be the most primitive of all the feliforms and the very first to split from the others. The Asiatic linsangs of the genus ''[[Prionodon]]'' (traditionally placed in the Viverridae) might form a family of their own as well, as some recent studies indicate that ''Prionodon'' is actually the closest living relative to the cats. The [[Nimravidae]] are sometimes seen as the most basal of all feliforms and the first to split from the others, but there is a possibility that Nimravidae might not even belong within the order,&lt;ref name=Wesley-Hunt2005b&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore its position as a clade within Carnivora is currently unstable. Other studies indicate that [[Barbourofelidae|barbourofelids]] forms a separate family, which is closely related to the true felids instead of being related to the nimravids. Recognizable nimravid fossils date from the late Eocene (37 mya), from the Chadronian White River Carnivora Formation at Flagstaff Rim, Wyoming. Nimravid diversity appears to have peaked about 28 mya. The [[hypercarnivore|hypercarnivorous]] (strictly meat-eating) nimravid feliforms were extinct in North America after 26 mya and felids did not arrive in North America until the early middle Miocene (16 mya).

It has been suggested that canids evolved hypercarnivorous morphologies because feliforms were absent during this period (the &quot;[[cat-gap]]&quot;, 26-18.5 mya), however recent data do not support this hypothesis. Hypercarnivore feliforms (felids and nimravids) occupied an area that canids did not and where felids, nimravids, and hypercarnivorous creodonts are found. Hypercarnivorous canids were present before the disappearance of the nimravids, and all went extinct before the appearance of felids. Following the extinction of nimravids, only three taxa originated, two of which were relatively small in body size. Disparity increased during the &quot;cat-gap&quot; even with the extinction of the hypercarnivorous extremes. This was due to the extinction of morphological intermediates, and because carnivorans began to occupy hypocarnivorous (nonmeat-specialist) morphospace for the first time in North America. Procyonids did not arrive in North America until the early Miocene, and &quot;modern&quot; ursids (e.g., [[Ursinae]]), did not arrive until the late Miocene. Extinct lineages of Ursidae were present in North America from the late Eocene through the Miocene and Amphicyonid (bear-dogs) were present during this period as well, but occupied a morphospace generally shared with canids and not in close proximity to ursids. A large question remains as to why there was a progressive decline in hypercarnivorous carnivoramorphans during the late Oligocene/early Miocene. During this period all hypercarnivorous forms disappeared from the fossil record, including hypercarnivorous feliforms, canids, and mustelids. One possible explanation is climate change. Earth was gradually cooling after the late Paleocene, and over a period spanning the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, a dramatic climatic cooling event occurred.&lt;ref name=Wesley-Hunt2005c&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wesley-Hunt, Gina D. | year = 2005 | title = The Morphological Diversification of Carnivores in North America | doi = 10.1666/0094-8373(2005)031&lt;0035:TMDOCI&gt;2.0.CO;2| journal = Palaeontology | volume = Winter | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4067/is_200501/ai_n9468217/ | page = 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study finally resolves the exact position of ''Ailurus'': the red panda is neither a procyonid nor an ursid, but forms a monotypic family, with the other musteloids as its closest living relatives. The same study also shows that the mustelids are not a primitive family, as was once thought. Their small body size is a secondary trait — the primitive body form of the arctoids was large, not small.&lt;ref name=Wesley-Hunt2005a&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wesley-Hunt, Gina D. and John J. Flynn | year = 2005 | title = Phylogeny of the Carnivores | journal = Journal of Systematic Palaeontology | volume = 3 | pages = 1–28 | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=285902 | doi = 10.1017/S1477201904001518|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKidmFuK |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent molecular studies also suggest that the endemic Carnivora of [[Madagascar]], including three genera usually classed with the [[Viverridae|civets]] and four genera of [[mongoose]]s classed with the Herpestidae, are all descended from a single ancestor. They form a single sister [[taxon]] to the Herpestidae. The [[hyena]]s are also closely related to this clade.

The territory of what is now &quot;Colombia&quot; was originally inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|indigenous people]] including the [[Muisca]], [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya]], and [[Tairona]]. The Spanish arrived in 1499 and initiated a period of [[Spanish conquest of the Chibchan Nations|conquest and colonization]] creating the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (comprising modern-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, the northwest region of Brazil and Panama) with its capital in [[Bogotá]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LABLAA6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Nicolás del Castillo Mathieu|url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/marzo1992/marzo3.htm|title=La primera vision de las costas Colombianas, Repaso de Historia|work=Revista Credencial|month=March|year=1992|accessdate=2008-02-29|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independence from Spain was [[Bolívar in New Granada|won]] in 1819, but by 1830 &quot;[[Gran Colombia]]&quot; had collapsed with the secession of Venezuela and Ecuador.

The new nation experimented with federalism as the [[Granadine Confederation]] (1858), and then the [[United States of Colombia]] (1863), before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIAWFB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=CIA world fact book|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/co.html|title=Colombia|work=CIA|date=2009-05-14|accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|Panama seceded]] in 1903 under pressure to fulfill financial responsibilities towards the United States government to build the Panama Canal.

Colombia has a long tradition of constitutional government. The [[Colombian Liberal Party|Liberal]] and [[Colombian Conservative Party|Conservative]] parties, founded in 1848 and 1849 respectively, are two of the oldest surviving political parties in the Americas. However, tensions between the two have frequently erupted into violence, most notably in the [[Thousand Days War]] (1899–1902) and [[La Violencia]], beginning in 1948. Since the 1960s, [[Military of Colombia|government forces]], [[Guerrilla movements in Colombia|left-wing insurgents]] and [[Paramilitarism in Colombia|right-wing paramilitaries]] have been engaged in the continent's longest-running [[Colombian armed conflict (1964–present)|armed conflict]]. Fuelled by the [[Illegal drug trade in Colombia|cocaine trade]], this escalated dramatically in the 1980s. Nevertheless, in the recent decade (2000s) the violence has decreased significantly. Many paramilitary groups have demobilized as part of a controversial peace process with the government, and the guerrillas have lost control in many areas where they once dominated.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIAWFB&quot; /&gt; Meanwhile Colombia's [[List of countries by homicide rate|homicide rate]], for many years one of the highest in the world, almost halved between 2002 and 2006.&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/Colombia_Dec06_en.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=[[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]]|title=Violence, Crime, and Illegal Arms Trafficking in Colombia|date=November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2009 and 2010 saw an increase in the urban homicide rate, particularly in the city of [[Medellín]], attributed to gang warfare and paramilitary successor groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Giglio |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/09/colombia-wrestling-to-quell-local-drug-gangs.html |title=Colombia Wrestling to Quell Local Drug Gangs |publisher=Newsweek |date=2010-09-09 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-02-03/world/colombia.violence_1_paramilitaries-rights-group-human-rights-watch?_s=PM:WORLD |title=Gangs tied to paramilitaries cited in Colombia violence|publisher=CNN  |date=2010-02-03 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDermott |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-10560568 |title=Colombia sees crime rise in major cities |publisher=BBC |date=2010-07-31 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Maplecroft research institute, in 2010 Colombia had the world's sixth highest risk of [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Maplecroft'', terrorism risk index http://www.maplecroft.com/about/news/terrorism.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/12911-colombia-ranks-6-on-terrorism-risk-list.html |title=Colombia ranks 6 on terrorism risk list|publisher=Colombia Reports |date=2010-11-15 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombia is very ethnically diverse, and the interaction between descendants of the original [[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|native]] inhabitants, [[Spanish people|Spanish]] colonists, [[Afro-Colombian|Africans]] brought as slaves and twentieth-century [[European ethnic groups|immigrants from Europe]] and the [[Arab diaspora in Colombia|Middle East]] has produced a rich cultural heritage. This has also been influenced by Colombia's varied geography. The majority of the urban centres are located in the highlands of the [[Andes|Andes mountains]], but Colombian territory also encompasses [[Amazon rainforest]], [[Llanos|tropical grassland]] and both Caribbean and Pacific coastlines. Ecologically, Colombia is one of the world's 17 [[megadiverse countries]] (the most biodiverse per unit area).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telepolis.com/cgi-bin/web/DISTRITODOCVIEW?url=/1604/doc/Parquesnaturales/paisajes.htm |title=en Colombia Paisajes naturales de Colombia |publisher=Telepolis.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Colombia&quot; comes from [[Christopher Columbus]] (Spanish: ''Cristóbal Colón''). It was conceived by the Venezuelan revolutionary [[Francisco de Miranda]] as a reference to all the [[Americas|New World]], but especially to those territories and colonies under Spanish and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] rule. The name was later adopted by the [[Greater Colombia|Republic of Colombia]] of 1819, formed out of the territories of the old [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (modern-day Colombia, Panama, Venezuela and Ecuador).&lt;ref name=&quot;LABLAA5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Carlos Restrepo Piedrahita|url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/febrero1992/febrero2.htm|title=El nombre &quot;Colombia&quot;, El único país que lleva el nombre del Descubrimiento|work=Revista Credencial|month=February|year=1992|accessdate=2008-02-29|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835, when Venezuela and Ecuador broke away, the [[Cundinamarca Province|Cundinamarca]] region that remained became a new country — the [[Republic of New Granada]]. In 1858 New Granada officially changed its name to the [[Grenadine Confederation]], then in 1863 the [[United States of Colombia]], before finally adopting its present name — the Republic of Colombia — in 1886.&lt;ref name=&quot;LABLAA5&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Colombia rel 2001-2.png|thumb|350px|Shaded relief map of Colombia]]
[[File:Canon chicamocha.jpg|thumb|Chicamocha canyon in the Department of [[Santander Department|Santander]].]] Colombia is bordered to the east by [[Venezuela]] and [[Brazil]]; to the south by [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]; to the north by [[Panama]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]]; and to the west by Ecuador and the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Including its Caribbean islands, it lies between latitudes [[14th parallel north|14°N]] and [[5th parallel south|5°S]], and longitudes [[66th meridian west|66°]] and [[82nd meridian west|82°W]].

Part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire|Ring of Fire]], a region of the world subject to [[earthquake]]s and [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], Colombia is dominated by the [[Andes]] mountains. Beyond the [[Colombian Massif]] (in the south-western departments of [[Cauca Department|Cauca]] and [[Nariño Department|Nariño]]) these are divided into three branches known as ''cordilleras'' (mountain ranges): the ''[[Cordillera Occidental (Colombia)|Cordillera Occidental]]'', running adjacent to the Pacific coast and including the city of [[Santiago de Cali|Cali]]; the ''[[Cordillera Central (Colombia)|Cordillera Central]]'', running between the [[Cauca River|Cauca]] and [[Magdalena River|Magdalena]] river valleys (to the west and east respectively) and including the cities of [[Medellín]], [[Manizales]], [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]] and [[Armenia, Quindío|Armenia]] ; and the ''[[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Cordillera Oriental]]'', extending north east to the [[Guajira Peninsula]] and including Bogotá, [[Bucaramanga]] and [[Cúcuta]]. Peaks in the ''Cordillera Occidental'' exceed {{convert|13000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, and in the ''Cordillera Central'' and ''Cordillera Oriental'' they reach {{convert|18000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tallest Mountains&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mountainpeaks.net/tallest_mountain_by_continent.php |title=Tallest mountains by continent |publisher=Mountainpeaks.net |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At {{convert|8500|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, Bogotá is the highest city of its size in the world.

East of the Andes lies the [[savanna]] of the ''[[Llanos]]'', part of the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River basin]], and, in the far south east, the [[jungle]] of the [[Amazon rainforest]]. Together these lowlands comprise over half Colombia's territory, but they contain less than 3% of the population. To the north the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean coast]], home to 20% of the population and the location of the major port cities of [[Barranquilla]] and [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], generally consists of low-lying plains, but it also contains the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] mountain range, which includes the country's tallest peaks ([[Pico Cristóbal Colón]] and [[Pico Simón Bolívar]]), and the [[La Guajira Desert|Guajira Desert]]. By contrast the narrow and discontinuous [[Pacific Region of Colombia|Pacific coastal lowlands]], backed by the [[Baudó Mountains|Serranía de Baudó]] mountains, are covered in dense vegetation and sparsely populated. The principal Pacific port is [[Buenaventura, Colombia|Buenaventura]].

Colombian territory also includes a number of [[Insular Region (Colombia)|Caribbean and Pacific islands]].

=== Environmental issues ===
{{Main|Environmental issues in Colombia}}
The environmental challenges faced by Colombia are caused by both natural and human hazards. Many natural hazards result from Colombia's position along the Pacific Ring of Fire and the consequent geological instability. Colombia has [[List of volcanoes in Colombia|15 major volcanoes]], the eruptions of which have on occasion resulted in substantial loss of life, such as at [[Armero tragedy|Armero in 1985]], and geological faults that have caused numerous devastating earthquakes, such as the [[1999 Armenia, Colombia earthquake|1999 Armenia earthquake]]. Heavy floods both in mountainous areas and in low-lying watersheds and coastal regions regularly cause deaths and considerable damage to property during the rainy seasons. Rainfall intensities vary with the [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] which occurs in unpredictable cycles, at times causing especially severe flooding.

Human induced [[deforestation]] has substantially changed the Andean landscape and has started to creep into the rainforests of Amazonia and the Pacific coast. Deforestation is also linked to the conversion of lowland tropical forests to [[oil palm]] plantations. However, compared to neighbouring countries rates of deforestation in Colombia are still relatively low.&lt;ref name=&quot;HDR Deforestation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/indicators/217.html |title=Human Development Report: Deforestation, 2007/2008 |publisher=Hdrstats.undp.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In urban areas, the use of [[fossil fuel]]s, and other human produced waste have contaminated the local environment. Demand from rapidly expanding cities has placed increasing stress on the water supply as watersheds are affected and ground water tables fall. Nonetheless, Colombia has large reserves of freshwater and is the fourth country in the world by magnitude of total freshwater supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwater.org/data.html|title=The World's Water|publisher=[[Pacific Institute]]|year=2008|pages=tables 1|accessdate=2009-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in the country's [[Colombian armed conflict (1964–present)|armed conflict]] have also contributed to the pollution of the environment. Illegal armed groups have deforested large areas of land to plant illegal crops, with an estimated 99,000 hectares used for the cultivation of [[coca]] in 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;WDR Summary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr/WDR_2008/Executive%20Summary.pdf |title=UNODC 2008 World Drug Report, Executive Summary|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in response the government has [[Coca eradication|fumigated these crops]] using hazardous chemicals. Insurgents have also destroyed oil pipelines creating major ecological disasters{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Colombia|Timeline of Colombian history}}
[[File:Villadeleyva10.jpg|thumb|[[Villa de Leyva]]]]

=== Pre-Columbian era ===&lt;!-- THIS SPELLING (Pre-ColUmbian) IS CORRECT, please do not edit it. It originates from &quot;(Christopher) Columbus&quot;, not &quot;Colombia&quot;--&gt;

Approximately 10,000 BC, [[hunter-gatherer]] societies existed near present-day Bogotá (at &quot;[[El Abra]]&quot; and &quot;Tequendama&quot;) which traded with one another and with cultures living in the [[Magdalena River]] Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Hammen, T. and Correal, G. 1978: &quot;Prehistoric man on the Sabana de Bogotá: data for an ecological prehistory&quot;; Paleography, Paleoclimatology, Paleoecology 25:179–190&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the first millennium BC, groups of [[Amerindian]]s developed the political system of &quot;[[cacicazgo]]s&quot; with a pyramidal structure of power headed by [[Cacique Nutibara Bloc|caciques]]. Within Colombia, the two cultures with the most complex cacicazgo systems were the [[Tayrona]]s in the [[Caribbean Region]], and the [[Muisca]]s in the highlands around Bogotá, both of which were of the [[Chibcha]] language family. The Muisca people are considered to have had one of the most developed political systems in South America, after the [[Inca]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, Sylvia 1965: Los Chibchas: organización socio-política. Série Latinoamericana 5. Bogotá: Facultad de Sociología, Universidad Nacional de Colombia&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spanish discovery, conquest, and colonization ===
[[File:Ataque Cartagena de Indias.jpg|thumb|Attack on [[Cartagena de Indias]]]]
Spanish explorers made the first exploration of the Caribbean littoral in 1499 led by [[Rodrigo de Bastidas]]. [[Christopher Columbus]] navigated near the Caribbean in 1502. In 1508, [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] started the conquest of the territory through the region of Urabá. In 1513, he was the first European to discover the Pacific Ocean, which he called ''Mar del Sur'' (or &quot;Sea of the South&quot;) and which in fact would bring the Spaniards to [[Peru]] and [[Chile]].

Alonso de Lugo (who had sailed with Columbus) reached the Guajira Peninsula in 1500. Santa Marta was founded in 1525, and Cartagena in 1533. Gonzalo Jiminez de Quesada led an expedition to the interior in 1535, and founded the &quot;New City of Granada&quot;, the name soon changed to &quot;Santa Fé de Bogotá.&quot; Two other notable journeys by Spaniards to the interior took place in the same period. Sebastian de Belalcazar, conqueror of Quito, traveled north and founded Cali in 1536 and Popayán in 1537; Nicolas Federman crossed Llanos Orientales and went over the Eastern Cordillera.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Geoff.  Colombia: A Brutal History (London:  Saqi, 2004), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The territory's main population was made up of hundreds of tribes of the [[Chibchan]] and [[Carib people|Carib]], currently known as the Caribbean people, whom the [[Spaniards]] conquered through warfare and alliances, while resulting disease such as [[smallpox]], and the conquest and [[ethnic cleansing]] itself caused a demographic reduction among the indigenous people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html |title=The Story Of... Smallpox — and other Deadly Eurasian Germs |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] began to bring slaves from Africa.

=== Independence from Spain ===
{{Main|Colombian Declaration of Independence}}

Since the beginning of the periods of Conquest and Colonization, there were several rebel movements under Spanish rule, most of them either being crushed or remaining too weak to change the overall situation. The last one which sought outright independence from Spain sprang up around 1810, following the independence of St. Domingue in 1804 (present-day [[Haiti]]), who provided a non-negligible degree of support to the eventual leaders of this rebellion: [[Simón Bolívar]] and [[Francisco de Paula Santander]].

A movement initiated by [[Antonio Nariño]], who opposed Spanish centralism and led the opposition against the [[viceroyalty]], led to the independence of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] in November 1811. This led to the formation of two independent governments which fought a [[civil war]], a period known as [[La Patria Boba]]. The following year Nariño proclaimed the [[United Provinces of New Granada]], headed by Camilo Torres Tenorio. Despite the successes of the rebellion, the emergence of two distinct ideological currents among the liberators (federalism and centralism) gave rise to an internal clash between these two, thus contributing to the reconquest of territory by the Spanish, allowing restoration of the viceroyalty under the command of Juan de Samano, whose regime punished those who participated in the uprisings. This stoked renewed rebellion, which, combined with a weakened Spain, made possible a successful rebellion led by Simón Bolívar, who finally proclaimed independence in 1819. The pro-Spanish resistance was finally defeated in 1822 in the present territory of Colombia and in 1823 in Venezuela.

The territory of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] became the [[Gran Colombia|Republic of Colombia]] organized as a union of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela (Panama was then an integral part of Colombia). The Congress of Cucuta in 1821 adopted a constitution for the new Republic. The first [[President of Colombia]] was the Venezuelan-born Simón Bolívar, and Francisco de Paula Santander was [[Vice President of Colombia|Vice President]]. However, the new republic was very unstable and ended with the rupture of Venezuela in 1829, followed by Ecuador in 1830.

[[File:Gran Colombia map 1824.jpg|thumb|The [[Gran Colombia]]]]

Internal political and territorial divisions led to the secession of Venezuela and Quito (today's Ecuador) in 1830. The so-called &quot;Department of [[Cundinamarca Department (1824)|Cundinamarca]]&quot; adopted the name &quot;[[Republic of the New Granada|Nueva Granada]]&quot;, which it kept until 1856 when it became the &quot;Confederación Granadina&quot; ([[Grenadine Confederation]]). After a [[Colombian Civil War (1860-1862)|two-year civil war]] in 1863, the &quot;[[United States of Colombia]]&quot; was created, lasting until 1886, when the country finally became known as the Republic of Colombia. Internal divisions remained between the bipartisan political forces, occasionally igniting very bloody [[civil war]]s, the most significant being the [[Thousand Days War|Thousand Days civil war]] (1899–1902).

This, together with the United States of America's intentions to influence the area (especially the [[Panama Canal]] construction and control) led to the separation of the Department of Panama in 1903 and the establishment of it as a nation. The United States paid Colombia $25,000,000 in 1921, seven years after completion of the canal, for redress of President Roosevelt's role in the creation of Panama, and Colombia recognized Panama under the terms of the [[Thomson-Urrutia Treaty]].
Colombia was engulfed in the Year-Long War with Peru over a territorial dispute involving the [[Amazonas Department]] and its capital [[Leticia, Colombia|Leticia]].

Soon after, Colombia achieved a relative degree of political stability, which was interrupted by a bloody conflict that took place between the late 1940s and the early 1950s, a period known as ''[[La Violencia]]'' (&quot;The Violence&quot;). Its cause was mainly mounting tensions between the two leading political parties, which subsequently ignited after the assassination of the [[Colombian Liberal Party|Liberal]] presidential candidate [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]] on April 9, 1948. This assassination caused riots in Bogotá and became known as [[El Bogotazo]]. The violence from these riots spread throughout the country and claimed the lives of at least 180,000 Colombians.

From 1953 to 1964 the violence between the two political parties decreased first when [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla|Gustavo Rojas]] deposed the President of Colombia in a [[coup d'état]] and negotiated with the guerrillas, and then under the [[military junta]] of General [[Gabriel París Gordillo]].

After Rojas' deposition the two political parties [[Colombian Conservative Party]] and Colombian Liberal Party agreed to the creation of a &quot;National Front&quot;, whereby the Liberal and Conservative parties would govern jointly. The presidency would be determined by an alternating conservative and liberal president every 4 years for 16 years; the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices. The National Front ended &quot;La Violencia&quot;, and National Front administrations attempted to institute far-reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the Alliance for Progress. In the end, the contradictions between each successive Liberal and Conservative administration made the results decidedly mixed. Despite the progress in certain sectors, many social and political problems continued, and guerrilla groups were formally created such as the [[FARC]], [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] and [[19th of April Movement|M-19]] to fight the government and political apparatus. These guerrilla groups were dominated by [[Marxism|Marxist doctrines]].

Emerging in the late 1970s, powerful and violent [[drug cartel]]s further developed during the 1980s and 1990s. The Medellín Cartel under [[Pablo Escobar]] and the [[Cali Cartel]], in particular, exerted political, economic and social influence in Colombia during this period. These cartels also financed and influenced different illegal armed groups throughout the political spectrum. Some enemies of these allied with the guerrillas and created or influenced [[Paramilitarism in Colombia|paramilitary groups]].

[[File:Pabloisdead.png|thumb|The Colombian armed forces around the dead body of the notorious drug lord [[Pablo Escobar]].]]

The new [[Colombian Constitution of 1991]] was ratified after being drafted by the [[Constituent Assembly of Colombia]]. The constitution included key provisions on political, ethnic, human and gender rights. The new constitution initially prohibited the extradition of [[Colombian nationality law|Colombian nationals]], causing accusations that drug cartels had lobbied for the provision; extradition was allowed again in 1996 when the provision was repealed. The cartels had previously promoted a violent campaign against extradition, leading to many [[terrorist attack]]s and [[mafia]]-style executions. They also tried to influence the government and political structure of Colombia through corruption, as in the case of the [[8000 Process]] scandal.

In recent years, the country has continued to be plagued by the effects of the [[Illegal drug trade|drug trade]], [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] [[insurgency|insurgencies]] like FARC, and paramilitary groups such as the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]], which along with other minor factions have engaged in a bloody internal [[Colombian Armed Conflict|armed conflict]]. President [[Andrés Pastrana]] and the FARC attempted to negotiate a solution to the conflict between 1999 and 2002. The government set up a &quot;demilitarized&quot; zone, but repeated tensions and crisis led the Pastrana administration to conclude that the negotiations were ineffectual. Pastrana also began to implement the [[Plan Colombia]] initiative, with the dual goal of ending the armed conflict and promoting a strong [[narcotic|anti-narcotic]] strategy.

During the presidency of [[Álvaro Uribe]], the government applied more military pressure on the FARC and other outlawed groups. After the offensive, which was supported by foreign aid provided by the United States, many security indicators improved. Reported [[Kidnappings in Colombia|kidnappings]] showed a steep decrease (from 3,700 in the year 2000 to 172 in 2009 (Jan.-Oct.)) and so did intentional homicides (from 28,837 in 2002 to 15,817 in 2009, according to police, while the health system reported a decline from 28,534 to 17,717 during the same period). Kidnappings suffered a steady decline for almost a decade until a 2010 increase saw 280 cases reported between January and October, most of which were concentrated in the [[Medellín]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/12941-kidnapping-on-the-rise-for-1st-time-in-decade.html |title=Kidnapping on the rise for 1st time in decade|publisher=Colombia Reports |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sigob.gov.co/ind/indicadores.aspx?m=552 |title=Disminuir la tasa anual de homicidios por cada 100. 000 habitantes ( Sin accidentes de transito) |accessdate=2010-03-15 |publisher=SIGOB |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinalegal.gov.co/drip/2002/Homicidios2002.pdf |title=Homicidios 2002 |accessdate=2009-05-16 |format=PDF |pages=38, 42 |publisher=Medicina Legal |language=Spanish}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinalegal.gov.co/drip/2009/2%20Forensis%202009%20Homicidios.pdf |title=Homicidios 2009 |accessdate=2010-11-19 |format=PDF |pages=30, 35–37, 65 |publisher=Medicina Legal |language=Spanish}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to official statistics, guerrillas were reduced from 24,000 fighters in 2002 to 9,500 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/10983-farc-eln-have-less-than-10000-members-government.html |title=FARC, ELN have less than 10,000 members: government|publisher=Colombia Reports |date=2010-07-24 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; While rural areas and jungles remained dangerous, the overall reduction of violence led to the growth of internal travel and tourism after security conditions improved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/la/displaystory.cfm?story_id=7121789 Come to Sunny Colombia] ''The Economist'', June 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Government of Colombia}}
{{See also|Colombian Constitution of 1991}}
[[File:Juanmanuelsantos1.png|thumb|upright|Current President [[Juan Manuel Santos]]]]
The government of Colombia takes place within the framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] as established in the [[Colombian Constitution of 1991|Constitution of 1991]]. In accordance with the principle of [[separation of powers]], government is divided into three branches: the executive branch, the legislative branch and the judicial branch.

[[File:Casadenariño1.jpg|thumb|left|Nariño Palace, presidential residence.]]
The head of the executive branch is the [[President of Colombia]] who serves as both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], followed by the [[Vice President of Colombia|Vice President]] and the [[Council of Ministers of the Republic of Colombia|Council of Ministers]]. The president is elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms and is currently limited to a maximum of two such terms (increased from one in 2005). At the provincial level executive power is vested in [[List of Colombian Department Governors|department governors]], [[municipalities of Colombia|municipal mayors]] and local administrators for smaller administrative subdivisions, such as ''corregidores'' or ''[[Corregimientos of Colombia|corregimientos]]''.

The legislative branch of government is composed by the Senate and the House of Representatives. The 102-seat [[Senate of Colombia|Senate]] is elected nationally and the Representatives are elected by every region and minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;Colombian Constitution. 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Members of both houses are elected two months before the president, also by popular vote and to serve four-year terms. At the provincial level the legislative branch is represented by [[List of Colombian Department Assemblies|department assemblies]] and municipal councils. All regional elections are held one year and five months after the presidential election.
The judicial branch is headed by the [[Supreme Court of Colombia|Supreme Court]], consisting of 23 judges divided into three chambers (Penal, Civil and Agrarian, and Labour). The judicial branch also includes the [[Council of State of Colombia|Council of State]], which has special responsibility for [[administrative law]] and also provides legal advice to the executive, the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia|Constitutional Court]], responsible for assuring the integrity of the Colombian constitution, and the [[Superior Council of Judicature]], responsible for auditing the judicial branch. Colombia operates a system of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], which since 2005 has been applied through an [[adversarial system]].

Colombia is divided into 32 [[Departments of Colombia|departments]] and one [[Bogotá Capital District|capital district]], which is treated as a department (Bogotá also serves as the capital of the [[Cundinamarca Department|department of Cundinamarca]]). Departments are subdivided into [[Municipalities of Colombia|municipalities]], each of which is assigned a municipal seat, and municipalities are in turn subdivided into ''[[Corregimientos of Colombia|corregimientos]]''. Each department has a local government with a governor and assembly directly elected to four-year terms. Each municipality is headed by a mayor and council, and each ''corregimiento'' by an elected ''corregidor'', or local leader.

In addition to the capital nine other cities have been designated [[Districts of Colombia|districts]] (in effect special municipalities), on the basis of special distinguishing features. These are [[Barranquilla]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Santa Marta]], [[Cúcuta]], [[Popayán]], [[Bucaramanga]], [[Tunja]], [[Turbo, Colombia|Turbo]], [[Buenaventura, Colombia|Buenaventura]] and [[Tumaco]]. Some departments have local administrative subdivisions, where towns have a large concentration of population and municipalities are near each other (for example in Antioquia and Cundinamarca). Where departments have a low population and there are security problems (for example Amazonas, Vaupés and Vichada), special administrative divisions are employed, such as &quot;department ''corregimientos''&quot;, which are a hybrid of a municipality and a ''corregimiento''.

The foreign affairs of Colombia are headed by the President of Colombia and managed by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Colombia)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]. Colombia has diplomatic missions in all continents and is also represented in multilateral organizations at the following locations:
* '''Brussels''' (Mission to the [[European Union]])
* '''Geneva''' (Permanent Missions to the [[United Nations]] and other international organizations)
* '''Montevideo''' (Permanent Missions to the [[Latin American Integration Association]] and [[Mercosur]])
* '''Nairobi''' (Permanent Missions to the United Nations and other international organizations)
* '''New York''' (Permanent Mission to the United Nations)
* '''Paris''' (Permanent Mission to [[UNESCO]])
* '''Rome''' (Permanent Mission to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]])
* '''Washington, D.C.''' (Permanent Mission to the [[Organization of American States]])

The foreign relations of Colombia are mostly concentrated on combating the illegal drug trade, the fight against terrorism, improving Colombia's image in the international community, expanding the international market for Colombian products, and environmental issues. Colombia receives special military and commercial co-operation and support in its fight against internal armed groups from the United States, mainly through [[Plan Colombia]], as well as special financial preferences from the European Union in certain products.

Colombia was one of the 12 countries that joined the [[UNASUR]] when it was created. [[UNASUR]] is supposed to be modeled like the [[European Union]] having free trade agreements with the members, free movement of people, a common currency, and also a common passport. Colombia as well as all the other members of [[UNASUR]] have had some problems with the integration due to the [[2008 Andean diplomatic crisis]].

Colombia is a member of the [[Andean Community of Nations]] and the [[Union of South American Nations]].

=== Defense ===
{{Main|Military of Colombia}}
[[File:ARC Almirante Padilla.jpg|thumb|left|[[Colombian Navy]] ARC ''Almirante Padilla'' (FM-51) frigate.]]
The executive branch of government has responsibility for managing the defense of Colombia, with the President [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces.

The Colombian military is divided into three branches: the [[National Army of Colombia]]; the [[Colombian Air Force]]; and the [[Colombian National Armada]]. The National Police functions as a [[gendarmerie]], operating independently from the military as the law enforcement agency for the entire country. Each of these operates with their own intelligence apparatus separate from the national intelligence agency, the [[Administrative Department of Security]].

The National Army is formed by divisions, regiments and special units; the National Armada by the [[Colombian Naval Infantry]], the [[Naval Force of the Caribbean]], the [[Naval Force of the Pacific]], the [[Naval Force of the South]], [[Colombia Coast Guards]], [[Naval Aviation (Colombia)|Naval Aviation]] and the [[Specific Command of San Andres y Providencia]]; and the Air Force by 13 air units. The National Police has a presence in all municipalities.

=== Politics ===
{{Main|Politics of Colombia}}
{{See also|Elections in Colombia|List of political parties in Colombia}}

[[File:Congress colombia.jpg|thumb|Colombian National Capitol.]]
For over a century Colombian politics were monopolized by the [[Colombian Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] (founded in 1848 on an [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]], broadly [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] and [[federalism|federalist]] platform), and the [[Colombian Conservative Party|Conservative Party]] (founded in 1849 espousing [[Catholicism]], [[protectionism]], and [[centralism]]). This culminated in the formation of the [[National Front (Colombia)|National Front]] (1958–1974), which formalized arrangements for an alternation of power between the two parties and excluded non-establishment alternatives (thereby fueling the nascent [[Colombian armed conflict (1964–present)|armed conflict]]).

By the time of the dissolution of the National Front, traditional political alignments had begun to fragment. This process has continued since, and the consequences of this are exemplified by the results of the [[Colombian presidential election, 2006|presidential election]] of 28 May 2006, which was won with 62% of the vote by the incumbent, [[Álvaro Uribe]]. President Uribe was from a Liberal background but he campaigned as part of the [[Colombia First]] movement with the support of the Conservative Party, and his hard line on security issues and liberal economics place him on the right of the modern political spectrum{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

In second place with 22% was [[Carlos Gaviria Díaz|Carlos Gaviria]] of the [[Alternative Democratic Pole]], a newly formed [[Social democracy|social democratic]] alliance which includes elements of the former [[19 April Movement|M-19]] guerrilla movement. [[Horacio Serpa]] of the Liberal Party achieved third place with 12%. Meanwhile in the [[Colombian legislative election, 2006|congressional elections]] held earlier that year the two traditional parties secured only 93 out of 268 seats available.

Despite a number of controversies, most notably the ongoing [[Colombian parapolitics scandal|parapolitics scandal]], dramatic improvements in security and continued strong economic performance have ensured that former President [[Álvaro Uribe]] remained popular among Colombian people, with his approval rating peaking at 85%, according to a poll in July 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uribe Popularity&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN06348039 |title=Reuters, Popularity of Colombia's Uribe soars after rescue |publisher=Reuters.com |date= 2008-07-06|accessdate=2010-05-16 | first=Hugh | last=Bronstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, having served two terms, he was constitutionally barred from seeking re-election in 2010. The Colombian Congress, with overwhelming support of the Colombian people, had attempted to hold a referendum allowing a vote that would overturn the 2-term limit for presidents, but this attempt was ruled unconstitutional by the Colombian constitutional court on February 27, 2010. President Uribe stated that he respects the decision, one that cannot be appealed.

On presidential elections performed as of May 30, 2010 people voted 46% &lt;ref name=&quot;Resultados elecciones&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.registraduria.gov.co |title=Registraduria, Registraduria Nacional del Estado Civil |publisher=Registraduria.gov.co |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the former Minister of defense [[Juan Manuel Santos]] for being the president from 2010 to 2014, but according to the current laws, since he does not have 50% of the votes, there was a second round on June 20, 2010 against the second most voted candidate, [[Antanas Mockus]] with 21%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resultados elecciones&quot;/&gt; The winning candidate was Juan Manuel Santos, who became Colombia's president beginning on August 7, 2010.

In spite of the difficulties presented by serious internal armed conflict, Colombia's [[market economy]] grew steadily in the latter part of the twentieth century, with [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) increasing at an average rate of over 4% per year between 1970 and 1998. The country suffered a [[recession]] in 1999 (the first full year of negative growth since the [[Great Depression]]), and the recovery from that recession was long and painful. However, in recent years growth has been impressive, reaching 8.2% in 2007, one of the [[List of countries by GDP (real) growth rate|highest rates of growth]] in Latin America. Meanwhile the [[Bolsa de Valores de Colombia|Colombian stock exchange]] climbed from 1,000 points at its creation in July 2001 to over 7,300 points by November 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;BANKREP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banrep.gov.co/estad/dsbb/imfcolom.htm |title=Banco de la República, Economic and Financial Data for Colombia |publisher=Banrep.gov.co |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[International Monetary Fund]] estimates, in 2010 Colombia's GDP (PPP) was US$429.866 billion ([[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|28th in the world]] and third in South America). Adjusted for [[purchasing power parity]], GDP per capita stands at $7,968, placing Colombia [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|82nd in the world]]. However, in practice this is relatively unevenly distributed among the population, and, in common with much of Latin America, Colombia scores poorly according to the [[Gini coefficient]], with UN figures placing it [[List of countries by income equality|119th out of 126 countries]]. In 2003 the richest 20% of the population had a 62.7% share of income/consumption and the poorest 20% just 2.5%, and 17.8% of Colombians live on [[List of countries by percentage of population living in poverty|less than $2 a day]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HDR Colombia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/countries/data_sheets/cty_ds_COL.html |title=Human Development Report for Colombia, 2007/2008 |publisher=Hdrstats.undp.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Colombia unemp inf gdp 2001 2010 - cehc84.JPG|thumb|left|Macroeconomic Indicators 2001–2010.]]

[[Government spending]] is 37.9% of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIAWFB&quot;/&gt; Almost a quarter of this goes towards servicing the country's relatively high [[government debt]], estimated at 52.8% of GDP in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIAWFB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HDR Colombia&quot;/&gt; Other problems facing the economy include weak domestic and foreign demand, the funding of the country's pension system, and unemployment (10.8% in November 2008).&lt;ref name=&quot;BANKREP&quot;/&gt; Inflation has remained relatively low in recent years, standing at 5.5% in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIAWFB&quot;/&gt;

Historically an agrarian economy, Colombia urbanised rapidly in the twentieth century, by the end of which just 22.7% of the workforce were employed in agriculture, generating just 11.5% of GDP. 18.7% of the workforce are employed in industry and 58.5% in services, responsible for 36% and 52.5% of GDP respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIAWFB&quot;/&gt; Colombia is rich in natural resources, and its main exports include [[petroleum]], [[coal]], [[Colombian coffee|coffee]] and other agricultural produce, and [[gold]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ITC Colombia Exports&quot;&gt;[http://www.intracen.org/tradstat/sitc3-3d/er170.htm International Trade Centre: Colombia Exports]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia is also known as the world's leading source of [[emerald]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;ICA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gemstone.org/gem-by-gem/english/emerald.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080821232509/http://www.gemstone.org/gem-by-gem/english/emerald.html|archivedate=2008-08-21 |title=International Colored Gemstone Association: Emerald |publisher=Gemstone.org |date=2001-09-28 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; while over 70% of [[Floriculture|cut flowers]] imported by the United States are Colombian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flower Basket&quot;&gt;[http://www.florverde.org/pdf/florverde_economic_impact.pdf America's Flower Basket: Colombian Flowers and the American Marketplace]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Principal trading partners are the United States (a controversial [[United States-Colombia Free Trade Agreement|free trade agreement]] with the United States is currently awaiting approval by the [[United States Congress]]), [[Venezuela]] and China.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIAWFB&quot;/&gt; All imports, exports, and the overall [[balance of trade]] are at record levels, and the inflow of export dollars has resulted in a substantial re-valuation of the [[Colombian peso]].

Economic performance has been aided by [[Economic liberalism|liberal reforms]] introduced in the early 1990s and continued during the presidency of [[Álvaro Uribe]], whose policies included measures designed to bring the [[Deficit|public sector deficit]] below 2.5% of GDP. In 2008, [[The Heritage Foundation]] assessed the Colombian economy to be 61.9% [[Index of Economic Freedom|free]], an increase of 2.3% since 2007, placing it [[List of countries by economic freedom|67th in the world]] and 15th out of 29 countries within the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heritage Foundation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Index/country.cfm?id=Colombia |title=Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom |publisher=Heritage.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile the improvements in security resulting from President Uribe's controversial &quot;[[democratic security]]&quot; strategy have engendered an increased sense of confidence in the economy. On 28 May 2007 the American magazine [[BusinessWeek]] published an article naming Colombia &quot;the most extreme emerging market on Earth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_22/b4036001.htm BusinessWeek, Colombia, The Most Extreme Emerging Market on Earth] May 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia's economy has improved in recent years. Investment soared, from 15% of GDP in 2002 to 26% in 2008. private business has retooled. However unemployment at 12 % and the poverty rate at 46% in 2009 are above the regional average.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Economist]], Colombia's resilient economy, October 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a recent World Bank report, doing business is easiest in Manizales, Ibagué and Pereira, and more difficult in Cali and Cartagena. Reforms in custom administration have helped reduce the amount of time it takes to prepare documentation by over 60% for exports and 40% for imports compared to the previous report. Colombia has taken measures to address the backlog in civil municipal courts. The most important result was the dismissal of 12.2% of inactive claims in civil courts thanks to the application of Law 1194 of 2008 (Ley de Desistimiento Tácito).&lt;ref name=&quot;World Bank Report on Colombia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/Subnational/exploreeconomies/Colombia-2010.aspx |title=Doing Business in Colombia |publisher=Doingbusiness.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years serious internal armed conflict deterred tourists from visiting Colombia, with official [[Travel advisory|travel advisories]] warning against travel to the country. However, in recent years numbers have risen sharply, thanks to improvements in security resulting from President Álvaro Uribe's &quot;democratic security&quot; strategy, which has included significant increases in military strength and police presence throughout the country and pushed rebel groups further away from the major cities, highways and tourist sites likely to attract international visitors. Foreign tourist visits were predicted to have risen from 0.5 million in 2003 to 1.3 million in 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Tourism&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=By Marián Hens |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7120906.stm |title=BBC News, A new hot-spot for the tourism industry |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-12-07 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Lonely Planet]] picked Colombia as one of their top ten world destinations for 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Christian Science Monitor|title=Hot Destination: Colombia|date=May 9, 2006|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0509/p06s01-woam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Colombia Minister for Industry, Trade and Tourism [[Luis Guillermo Plata]] said his country had received 2,348,948 visitors in 2008. In 2010 Colombia recieved less than 1,5 million foreign visitors, according to official statistics.&lt;ref&gt;''[[El Espectador]]'' (spanish) http://elespectador.com/noticias/bogota/articulo-269115-bogota-ocupa-sexto-puesto-america-latina-ranking-de-turismo&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010 the U.S. State Department travel warning for the country stated that security conditions had improved significantly in recent years and kidnappings had been noticeably reduced from their previous peak, but cautioned travelers about continuing terrorist threats and the dangers of common crime, including hostage-taking. Rising murder rates in Cali and Medellín were also highlighted and U.S. citizens were urged to travel between cities by air instead of using ground transportation.&lt;ref name=&quot;travel.state.gov&quot;&gt;[http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_941.html 'Travel Warning: Colombia'] ''U.S. State Department'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;

Popular tourist attractions include the historic [[La Candelaria|Candelaria]] district of central Bogotá, the walled city and beaches of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], the colonial towns of [[Santa Fe de Antioquia]], [[Popayán]], [[Villa de Leyva]] and [[Santa Cruz de Mompox]], and the [[Las Lajas Sanctuary]] and the [[Salt Cathedral of Zipaquirá]]. Tourists are also drawn to [[Festivals in Colombia|Colombia's numerous festivals]], including [[Medellín]]'s [[Festival of the Flowers]], the [[Barranquilla's Carnival|Barranquilla Carnival]], the [[Carnival of Blacks and Whites]] in [[Pasto]] and the [[Ibero-American Theater Festival]] in Bogotá. Meanwhile, because of the improved security, Caribbean [[cruise ship]]s now stop at Cartagena and [[Santa Marta]].

The great variety in geography, flora and fauna across Colombia has also resulted in the development of an [[ecotourism|ecotourist]] industry, concentrated in the country's [[List of national parks of Colombia|national parks]]. Popular ecotourist destinations include: along the Caribbean coast, the [[Tayrona National Natural Park]] in the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] mountain range and [[Cabo de la Vela]] on the tip of the [[Guajira Peninsula]]; the [[Nevado del Ruiz|Nevado del Ruiz volcano]], the [[Cocora valley]] and the [[Tatacoa Desert]] in the central [[Andean Region of Colombia|Andean region]]; [[Amacayacu National Park]] in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon River basin]]; and the Pacific islands of [[Malpelo Island|Malpelo]] and [[Gorgona, Colombia|Gorgona]].

{{Main|Transport in Colombia}}
Colombia has a network of national highways maintained by the ''[[Instituto Nacional de Vías]]'' or INVIAS (National Institute of Roadways) government agency under the [[Ministry of Transport (Colombia)|Ministry of Transport]]. The [[Pan-American Highway]] travels through Colombia, connecting the country with Venezuela to the east and Ecuador to the south.

Colombia's main airports are [[El Dorado International Airport]] in Bogotá, [[Jose Maria Cordova International Airport]] in Medellín, [[Alfonso Bonilla Aragon International Airport]] in Cali, [[Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport]] in Barranquilla, [[Matecaña International Airport]] in Pereira, and [[Rafael Nuñez International Airport]] in Cartagena. [[El Dorado International Airport]] is the busiest airport in Latin America based upon the number of flights and the weight of goods transported.&lt;ref name=&quot;Infraero Statistics 2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.infraero.gov.br/upload/arquivos/movi/mov.%20operac_1208%20revisado.pdf Infraero.gov.br]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several national airlines ([[Avianca]], [[AeroRepública]], [[AIRES]], [[SATENA]] and [[EasyFly]], ), and international airlines (such as [[Iberia Airlines|Iberia]], [[American Airlines]], [[Varig]], [[Copa Airlines|Copa]], [[Continental Airlines|Continental]], [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]], [[Air Canada]], [[Spirit]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Air France]], [[Aerolíneas Argentinas]], [[Aerogal]], [[TAME]], [[Grupo TACA|TACA]], [[JetBlue Airways]], [[LAN Airlines]]) operate from El Dorado. Because of its central location in Colombia and America, it is preferred by national land transportation providers, as well as national and international air transportation providers.

Urban transport systems have been developed in Bogotá and Medellín. Traffic congestion in Bogotá has been greatly exacerbated by the lack of rail transport. However, this problem has been alleviated somewhat by the development of the TransMilenio Bus Rapid System and the restriction of vehicles through a daily, rotating ban on private cars depending on plate numbers. Bogotá's system consists of bus and minibus services managed by both private- and public-sector enterprises. Since 1995 Medellín has had a modern urban railway referred to as the Metro de Medellín, which also connects with the cities of Itagüí, Envigado, and Bello. An elevated cable car system, Metrocable, was added in 2004 to link some of Medellín's poorer mountainous neighborhoods with the Metro de Medellín. A bus rapid-transit system called Transmetro, similar to Bogotá's TransMilenio, will begin operating in Barranquilla by late 2007. Cali's streets remain under construction as a new public-transit system called the Massive Integration of the West is being built.

=== Colombia dry canal ===
[[China]] and Colombia have discussed a [[Panama Canal]] rival, a 'Dry Canal' a 220&amp;nbsp;km rail link between the Pacific and a new city near [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]. China is Colombia's second largest trade partner after the USA. Colombia is also the world's fifth-largest coal producer, but most is currently exported via Atlantic ports while demand is growing fastest across the Pacific. A dry canal could make Colombia a hub where imported Chinese goods would be assembled for re-export throughout the Americas and Latin American raw materials would begin the return journey to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7e14756c-37a9-11e0-b91a-00144feabdc0.html?ftcamp=rss#axzz1Dw79Zosw |title=China in talks over Panama Canal rival |publisher=Ft.com |date=2011-02-13 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Colombia}}
{{See also|List of Colombian Departments by population}}

With an estimated 46 million people in 2008, Colombia is the [[List of countries by population|third-most populous country]] in Latin America, after Brazil and Mexico. It is also home to the fourth-largest number of Spanish speakers in the world after Mexico, the United States, and Spain. It is slightly ahead of Argentina. The population increased at a rate of 1.9% between 1975 and 2005, predicted to drop to 1.2% over the next decade. Colombia is projected to have a population of 50.7 million by 2015. These trends are reflected in the country's age profile. In 2005 over 30% of the population was under 15 years old, compared to just 5.1% aged 65 and over.

The population is concentrated in the [[Andean Region of Colombia|Andean highlands]] and along the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean coast]]. The nine eastern lowland departments, comprising about 54% of Colombia's area, have less than 3% of the population and a density of less than one person per square kilometer (two persons per square mile). Traditionally a rural society, [[Urbanization|movement to urban areas]] was very heavy in the mid-twentieth century, and Colombia is now one of the most urbanized countries in Latin America. The urban population increased from 31% of the total in 1938 to 60% in 1975, and by 2005 the figure stood at 72.7%.&lt;ref name=&quot;HDR Colombia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Country Study&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/colombia/36.htm |title=Colombia: A Country Study |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Bogotá alone has increased from just over 300,000 in 1938 to approximately 8 million today. In total thirty cities now have populations of 100,000 or more. As of 2010 Colombia has the world's largest populations of [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs), estimated up to 4.5 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/12808-colombia-has-most-displaced-in-the-world.html |title=Colombia has most displaced in world: UN |publisher=Colombia Reports |date=2010-11-09 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/EGUA-7RQN5C?OpenDocument Number of internally displaced people remains stable at 26 million].

=== Ethnic groups ===
[[File:Vendedora de frutas Cartagena Colombia.png|thumb|upright|[[Afro-Colombian]] woman in Cartagena]]

The census data in Colombia does not record ethnicity, other than that of those identifying themselves as members of particular minority ethnic groups, so overall percentages are essentially estimates from other sources and can vary from one to another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nación Multicultural&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dane.gov.co/files/censo2005/etnia/sys/colombia_nacion.pdf |title=Colombia una nación multicultural: su diversidad étnica |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]], the majority of the population (58%) is [[Mestizo]], or of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry. Approximately 20% of the population is of [[White Latin American|European]] ancestry (predominantly [[Spanish people|Spanish]], partly [[Italians|Italian]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], and [[Germans|German]]). The CIA World Factbook also states that 14% of Colombia's total population is of mixed African and European ancestry, with 3% being of mixed African and Amerindian ancestry, and 4% having primarily African ancestry. [[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|Indigenous Amerindians]] comprise only 1% of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIAWFB&quot;/&gt; Other sources claim that up to 29% of Colombians (13 million people) have some African ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todacolombia.com/etnias/afrocolombianos/poblacion.html |title=Comunidades Negras: Poblacion Negra Afrocolombiana |publisher=Todacolombia.com |date=2007-03-28 |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overwhelming majority of Colombians speak Spanish (see also [[Colombian Spanish]]), but in total 101 languages are listed for Colombia in the [[Ethnologue]] database, of which 80 are spoken today. Most of these belong to the [[Chibchan languages|Chibcha]]n, [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]] and [[Cariban languages|Carib]]an language families. The [[Quechua language]], spoken in the Andes region of the country, has also extended more northwards into Colombia, mainly in urban centers of major cities. There are currently about 500,000 speakers of indigenous languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;ethnologue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Colombia |title=The Languages of Colombia |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Spanish colonization of what is now Colombia, the territory was home to a significant number of indigenous peoples. Many of these were absorbed into the mestizo population, but the remainder currently represents over eighty-five distinct cultures. 567 reserves (''resguardos'') established for indigenous peoples occupy 365,004 square kilometres (over 30% of the country's total) and are inhabited by more than 800,000 people in over 67,000 families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resguardos Indígenas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etniasdecolombia.org/grupos_resguardos.asp |title=Los Resguardos Indígenas |publisher=Etniasdecolombia.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1991 constitution established their native languages as official in their territories, and most of them have bilingual education (native and Spanish).

The [[National Indigenous Organization of Colombia|Organización Nacional Indígena de Colombia]] (ONIC) is an organization representing the indigenous peoples of Colombia, who comprise some 800,000 people or approximately 2% of the population. The organization was founded at the first National Indigenous Congress in 1982.

In 1991, Colombia signed and ratified the current international law concerning indigenous peoples, [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/ratifce.pl?C169 |title=ILOLEX: submits English query |publisher=Ilo.org |date=2004-01-09 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first and most substantial wave of modern immigration to Colombia consisted of [[Spanish people|Spanish colonists]], following the arrival of Europeans in 1499. However a low number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early twentieth centuries, and, in smaller numbers, [[Polish people|Poles]], [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanians]], [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], and [[Croats]] during and after the Second World War.

Many immigrant communities have settled on the Caribbean coast, in particular recent immigrants from the Middle East. [[Barranquilla]] (the largest city of the Colombian Caribbean) and other Caribbean cities have the largest populations of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] and [[Arab people|Arabs]], [[Sephardi Jews]], [[Romani people|Roma]]. There are also important communities of [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

[[African people|Black Africans]] were brought as [[Slavery|slaves]], mostly to the coastal lowlands, beginning early in the 16th century and continuing into the 19th century. Large Afro-Colombian communities are found today on the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. The population of the [[Chocó Department|department of Chocó]], running along the northern portion of Colombia's Pacific coast, is over 80% black.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grupos Étnicos&quot;&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.dane.gov.co/censo/files/presentaciones/grupos_etnicos.pdf Colombia una Los grupos étnicos colombianos]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact of armed conflict on civilians ===

Around one third of the people in Colombia have been affected in some way by the ongoing armed conflict. Those with direct personal experience make up 10% of the population and many others also report suffering a range of serious hardships. Overall, 31% have been affected on a personal level or as a result of the wider consequences of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/views-from-field-report-240609/$File/Our-World-Views-from-Colombia-I-ICRC.pdf Colombia, Opinion survey 2009], by ICRC and Ipsos&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, an estimated 35,000 people died as a result of the armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.org/adm/1315/transcript.html |title=Colombia in Crisis |publisher=Jon Lottman, Center for Defense Information  |accessdate=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trade unions in Colombia]] are included among the victimized groups with over 2,800 of their members being murdered between 1986 and 2010.&lt;ref name=ITUCres&gt;[[International Trade Union Confederation]], 11 June 2010, [http://www.ituc-csi.org/ituc-responds-to-the-press-release.html?lang=en ITUC responds to the press release issued by the Colombian Interior Ministry concerning its survey]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Religion in Colombia}}
{{See also|Freedom of religion in Colombia}}

The [[National Administrative Department of Statistics]] (DANE) does not collect religious statistics, and accurate reports are difficult to obtain. However, based on various studies, more than 95% of the population adheres to [[Christianity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/country/?CountryID=78|title=Religious Intelligence&amp;nbsp; — Country Profile: Colombia|accessdate=2007-10-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927194326/http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/country/?CountryID=78 |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the vast majority of which (between 81% and 90%) are [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]]. About 1% of Colombians adhere to [[animism|indigenous religions]] and under 1% to [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]]. However, despite high numbers of adherents, around 60% of respondents to a poll by ''El Tiempo'' reported that they did not practice their faith actively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Religious Freedom&quot;&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51632.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2005], by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State, November 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Colombia remains an overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country, the Colombian constitution guarantees freedom and equality of religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Colombia/col91.html Constitution of Colombia, 1991] (Article 19)&lt;/ref&gt; Religious groups are readily able to obtain recognition as organized associations, although some smaller ones have faced difficulty in obtaining the additional recognition required to offer chaplaincy services in public facilities and to perform legally recognised marriages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Religious Freedom&quot;/&gt;

=== Health ===
{{Main|Health care in Colombia}}
[[Life expectancy]] at birth in 2005 was 72.3; 2.1% would not reach the age of 5, 9.2% would not reach the age of 40.&lt;ref name=&quot;HDR Colombia&quot;/&gt; Health standards in Colombia have improved greatly since the 1980s. A 1993 reform transformed the structure of public health-care funding by shifting the burden of subsidy from providers to users. As a result, employees have been obligated to pay into health plans to which employers also contribute. Although this new system has widened population coverage by the social and health security system from 21 percent (pre-1993) to 56 percent in 2004 and 66 percent in 2005, health disparities persist, with the poor continuing to suffer relatively high mortality rates. In 2002 Colombia had 58,761 physicians, 23,950 nurses, and 33,951 dentists; these numbers equated to 1.35 physicians, 0.55 nurses, and 0.78 dentists per 1,000 population, respectively. In 2005 Colombia was reported to have only 1.1 physicians per 1,000 population, as compared with a Latin American average of 1.5. The health sector reportedly is plagued by rampant corruption, including misallocation of funds and evasion of health-fund contributions.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Colombia.pdf Colombia country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (February 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Colombia}}

The educational experience of many Colombian children begins with attendance at a preschool academy until age 6 (''Educación preescolar''). Basic education (''Educación básica'') is compulsory by law.&lt;ref&gt;Artículo 67, Constitución Política de Colombia&lt;/ref&gt; It has two stages: Primary basic education (''Educación básica primaria'') which goes from 1st to 5th grade and usually it encompasses children from 6 to 10 years old, and Secondary basic education (''Educación básica secundaria''), which goes from 6th to 9th grade. Basic education is followed by Middle vocational education (''Educación media vocacional'') that comprehends 10th and 11th grade. It may have different vocational training modalities or specialties (academic, technical, business, and so on.) according to the curriculum adopted by each school. However in many rural areas, teachers are poorly qualified, and only the five years of primary schooling are offered. The school year can extend from February to November or from August to June, and in many public schools attendance is split into morning and afternoon &quot;shifts&quot;, in order to accommodate the large numbers of children.&lt;ref&gt;Organización de Estados Iberoamericanos: Sistemas Educativos Nacionales, Colombia, [http://www.oei.es/quipu/colombia/index.html OEI.es]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the successful completion of all the basic and middle education years, a high-school diploma is granted. The high-school graduate is known as a  ''bachiller'', because secondary basic school and middle education are traditionally considered together as a unit called ''bachillerato'' (6th to 11th grade). Students in their final year of middle education take the [[ICFES Examination|ICFES test]] in order to gain access to Superior education (''Educación superior''). This superior education includes undergraduate professional studies, technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies.

''Bachilleres'' (high-school graduates) may enter into a professional undergraduate career program offered by a university; these programs last up to 5 years (or less for technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies), even up to 6–7 years for some careers, such as medicine. In Colombia, there is not an institution such as college; students go directly into a career program at a university or any other educational institution to obtain a professional, technical or technological title. Once graduated from the university, people are granted a (professional, technical or technological) diploma and licensed (if required) to practice the career they have chosen. For some professional career programs, students are required to take the SABER-PRO test in their final year of undergraduate academic education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://menweb.mineducacion.gov.co/nnormas/normas_basicas_4.swf |title=Ministerio de Educación de Colombia, Estructura del sistema educativo |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public spending on education as a proportion of [[gross domestic product]] in 2006 was 4.7% — one of the highest rates in Latin America — as compared with 2.4% in 1991. This represented 14.2% of total government expenditure.&lt;ref name=&quot;HDR Colombia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESCO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=289&amp;IF_Language=eng&amp;BR_Country=1700&amp;BR_Region=40520 |title=UNESCO Institute for Statistics Colombia Profile |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the primary and secondary net enrollment rates stood at 88% and 65% respectively, slightly below the regional average. School life expectancy was 12.4 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESCO&quot;/&gt; A total of 92.3% of the population aged 15 and older were recorded as literate, including 97.9% of those aged 15–24, both figures slightly higher than the regional average.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESCO&quot;/&gt; However, literacy levels are considerably lower in rural areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Background Note&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35754.htm |title=US Department of State Background Note: Colombia |publisher=State.gov |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Colombia}}
{{See also|Festivals in Colombia|Music of Colombia}}
Colombia lies at the crossroads of [[Latin American culture|Latin America]] and the broader American continent, and as such has been hit by a wide range of cultural influences. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[Culture of Spain|Spanish]] and other [[Culture of Europe|European]], [[Culture of Africa|African]], [[Culture of the United States|American]], Caribbean, and [[Arab culture|Middle Eastern]] influences, as well as other Latin American cultural influences, are all present in Colombia's modern culture. [[Urbanization|Urban migration]], [[industrialization]], [[globalization]], and other political, social and economic changes have also left an impression.

Historically, the country's imposing landscape left its various [[Natural regions of Colombia|regions]] largely isolated from one another, resulting in the development of very strong regional identities, in many cases stronger than the national. Modern transport links and means of communication have mitigated this and done much to foster a sense of nationhood, but social and political instability, and in particular fears of armed groups and bandits on intercity highways, have contributed to the maintenance of very clear regional differences. Accent, dress, music, food, politics and general attitude vary greatly between the Bogotanos and other residents of the central highlands, the ''[[paisas]]'' of [[Antioquia]] and the [[eje cafetero|coffee region]], the ''costeños'' of the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean coast]], the ''[[llanero]]s'' of the eastern plains, and the inhabitants of the [[Pacific Region of Colombia|Pacific coast]] and the vast [[Amazon Region of Colombia|Amazon region]] to the south east.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

An inheritance from the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonial era]], Colombia remains a deeply [[Roman Catholicism in Colombia|Roman Catholic country]] and maintains a large base of Catholic traditions which provide a point of unity for its multicultural society. Colombia has many [[Festivals in Colombia|celebrations and festivals]] throughout the year, and the majority are rooted in these Catholic religious traditions. However, many are also infused with a diverse range of other influences. Prominent examples of Colombia's festivals include the [[Barranquilla's Carnival|Barranquilla Carnival]], the [[Carnival of Blacks and Whites]], Medellín's [[Festival of the Flowers]] and Bogotá's [[Ibero-American Theater Festival]]

The mixing of various different ethnic traditions is reflected in Colombia's [[music of Colombia|music]] and dance. The most well-known Colombian genres are [[cumbia]] and [[vallenato]], the latter now strongly influenced by global [[pop culture]]. A powerful and unifying cultural medium in Colombia is [[Television in Colombia|television]]. Most famously, the [[telenovela]] [[Betty La Fea]] has gained international success through localized versions in the United States, Mexico, and elsewhere. Television has also played a role in the development of the [[Cinema of Colombia|local film industry]].

As in many Latin American countries, Colombians have a passion for [[Association football|football]]. The [[Colombian national football team]] is seen as a symbol of unity and national pride, though [[Colombian Professional Football|local clubs]] also inspire fierce loyalty and [[Barra brava|sometimes-violent rivalries]]. Colombia has &quot;exported&quot; many famous players, such as [[Freddy Rincón]], [[Carlos Valderrama (footballer)|Carlos Valderrama]], [[Iván Córdoba|Iván Ramiro Córdoba]], and [[Faustino Asprilla]]. Other [[Sport in Colombia|Colombian athletes]] have also achieved success, including [[Formula One|Formula 1 Racing]]'s [[Juan Pablo Montoya]], [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Edgar Rentería]] and [[Orlando Cabrera]], and the [[PGA Tour]]'s [[Camilo Villegas]].

Other famous Colombians include the [[Nobel Prize]] winning author [[Gabriel García Márquez]], the artist [[Fernando Botero]], the writers [[Fernando Vallejo]], [[Laura Restrepo]], [[Álvaro Mutis]] and [[James Cañón]], the musicians [[Shakira]], [[Juanes]], [[Carlos Vives]] and [[Juan Garcia-Herreros]], and the actors [[Catalina Sandino Moreno]], [[John Leguizamo]], [[Catherine Siachoque]] and [[Sofía Vergara]].

The [[Colombian cuisine]] developed mainly from the food traditions of European countries. [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]], [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] and [[French cuisine|French]] culinary influences can all be seen in Colombian cooking. The cuisine of neighboring [[Latin American cuisine|Latin American countries]], [[Mexican cuisine|Mexico]], [[Cuisine of the United States|the United States]] and [[Caribbean cuisine|the Caribbean]], as well as the [[Native American cuisine|cooking traditions]] of the country's indigenous inhabitants, have all influenced Colombian food. For example, [[Guinea pig|cuy]] or guinea pig, which is an indigenous cuisine, is eaten in the Andes region of south-western Colombia.

Many [[National symbols of Colombia|national symbols]], both objects and themes, have arisen from Colombia's diverse cultural traditions and aim to represent what Colombia, and the Colombian people, have in common. Cultural expressions in Colombia are promoted by the government through the [[Ministry of Culture (Colombia)|Ministry of Culture]].{{Clear}}

Colombia's cuisine, influenced heavily by the Spanish and Indigenous populations, is not as widely known as other Latin American cuisines such as Peruvian or Brazilian, but to the adventurous traveler there are plenty of delectable dishes to try, not to mention fruits, rum, and especially Colombian coffee.

'''''Citizen Kane''''' is a 1941 American [[drama film]], directed by and starring [[Orson Welles]]. The film is often considered the [[Films considered the greatest ever|greatest of all time]] and is particularly praised for its innovative [[cinematography]], [[Film music|music]] and narrative structure. ''Citizen Kane'' was Welles' [[List of directorial debuts|first feature film]]. The film was nominated for [[Academy Award]]s in nine categories; it won an [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)]] by [[Herman Mankiewicz]] and Welles. It was released by [[RKO Pictures]].

The story is a ''[[film à clef]]'' that examines the life and legacy of [[Charles Foster Kane]], played by Welles, a character based upon the American newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]] and Welles' own life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sparknotes.com/film/citizenkane/canalysis.html#Charles-Foster-Kane &quot;SparkNotes: Citizen Kane: Analysis of Major Characters&quot;]. SparkNotes. SparkNotes.com. Retrieved 11 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its release, Hearst prohibited mention of the film in any of his newspapers. Kane's career in the publishing world is born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolves into a ruthless pursuit of power. Narrated principally through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, the story is revealed through the research of a newsreel reporter seeking to solve the mystery of the newspaper magnate's dying word: &quot;Rosebud.&quot;

After his success in the theatre with his [[Mercury Players]] and his controversial 1938 radio broadcast of ''[[War of the Worlds (radio)|War of the Worlds]]'', Welles was courted by Hollywood. He signed a contract with [[RKO Pictures]] in 1939. Unusual for an untried director, he was given the freedom to develop his own story and use his own cast and crew, and was given [[final cut privilege]]. Following two abortive attempts to get a project off the ground, he developed the screenplay of ''Citizen Kane'' with Herman Mankiewicz. Principal photography took place in 1940 and the film received its American release in [[1941 in film|1941]].

A critical success, ''Citizen Kane'' failed to recoup its costs at the box-office. The film faded from view soon after but its reputation was restored, initially by French critics and more widely after its American revival in 1956. There is a semi-official consensus among film critics that ''Citizen Kane'' is the greatest film ever made, which has led [[Roger Ebert]] to quip: &quot;So it's settled: ''Citizen Kane'' is the official greatest film of all time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ebert080904&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last=Ebert | first=Roger | url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/09/whats_your_favorite_movie.html | title=What's your favorite movie?| publisher= ''Chicago Sun-Times'' | work=Roger Ebert's Journal | date=4 September 2008 | accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It topped both the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies]] list and the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|10th Anniversary Update]], as well as all of the ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' polls of the 10 greatest films for nearly half a century.

==Plot==
Charles Foster Kane ([[Orson Welles]]), an enormously wealthy [[media proprietor]], has been living alone in [[Florida]] in his vast palatial estate [[Xanadu (Citizen Kane)|Xanadu]] for the last years of his life, with a &quot;No trespassing&quot; sign on the gate. He dies in a bed while holding a [[snow globe]] and utters &quot;Rosebud...&quot;; the globe slips from his lifeless hand and smashes. Kane's death then becomes sensational news around the world. Newsreel reporter Jerry Thompson ([[William Alland]]) tries to find out about Kane's private life and, in particular, to discover the meaning behind his last word. The reporter interviews the great man's friends and associates, and Kane's story unfolds as a series of flashbacks. Thompson approaches Kane's second wife, Susan Alexander ([[Dorothy Comingore]]), now an [[alcoholic]] who runs her own club, but she refuses to tell him anything. Thompson then goes to the private archive of Walter Parks Thatcher ([[George Coulouris]]), a deceased banker who served as Kane's guardian during his childhood and adolescence. It is through Thatcher's written memoirs that Thompson learns about Kane's childhood. Thompson then interviews Kane's personal business manager Mr. Bernstein ([[Everett Sloane]]), best friend Jedediah Leland ([[Joseph Cotten]]), Susan for a second time, and Kane's butler Raymond ([[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]]) at Xanadu.

Flashbacks reveal that Kane's childhood was spent in poverty in [[Colorado]] (his parents ran a [[boarding house]]), until the &quot;world's third largest gold mine&quot; was discovered on an apparently worthless property his mother had acquired. He is forced to leave his mother ([[Agnes Moorehead]]) when she sends him away to the [[Eastern United States|East Coast of the U.S.]] to live with Thatcher, to be educated. After gaining full control over his possessions at the age of 25, Kane enters the newspaper business with sensationalized [[yellow journalism]]. He takes control of the newspaper, the ''New York Inquirer'', and hires all the best journalists. His attempted rise to power is documented, including his manipulation of public opinion for the [[Spanish American War]]; his first marriage to Emily Monroe Norton ([[Ruth Warrick]]), a [[President of the United States|President's]] niece; and his campaign for the office of governor of [[New York State]], for which alternative newspaper headlines are created depending on the result.

Kane's marriage disintegrates over the years, and he begins an affair with Susan Alexander. Both his wife and his opponent discover the affair, simultaneously ending his marriage and his political career. Kane marries his mistress, and forces her into an [[opera]]tic career for which she has no talent or ambition. Kane finally allows her to abandon her singing career after she attempts [[suicide]], but after a span of time spent in boredom and isolation in Xanadu, she ultimately leaves him.

Kane spends his last years building his vast estate and lives alone, interacting only with his staff. The butler recounts that Kane had said &quot;Rosebud&quot; after Susan left him, right after seeing a snow globe.

At Xanadu, Kane's vast number of belongings are being cataloged, ranging from priceless works of art to worthless furniture. During this time, Thompson finds that he is unable to solve the mystery and concludes that &quot;Rosebud&quot; will forever remain an enigma. He theorizes that &quot;Mr. Kane was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it. Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get, or something he lost.&quot; In the ending of the film, it is revealed to the audience that Rosebud was the name of the [[sled]] from Kane's childhood—an allusion to the only time in his life when he was truly happy. The sled, thought to be junk, is burned and destroyed by Xanadu's departing staff in a basement furnace.

The film's end credits read &quot;Most of the principal actors are new to motion pictures. The Mercury Theatre is proud to introduce them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AFIcat&quot;/&gt; Welles along with his partner [[John Houseman]] had assembled them into a group known as the Mercury Players to perform his productions in the Mercury Theatre in 1937. After accepting his Hollywood contract in 1939, Welles worked between Los Angeles and New York where the Mercury Theatre continued their weekly radio broadcasts for ''[[The Campbell Playhouse]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;shadows&quot;/&gt; Welles had wanted all the Mercury Players to debut in his first film, but the cancellation of ''The Heart of Darkness'' project in December 1939 created a financial crisis for the group and some of the actors worked elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;shadows&quot;/&gt; This caused friction between Welles and Houseman, and their partnership ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;shadows&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Walking Shadows: Orson Welles, William Randolph Hearst and Citizen Kane|last=Walsh|first=John Evangelist|pages=31–37|publisher=Bowling Green University Popular Press|isbn=978-0299205003|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RKO executives were dismayed that so many of the major roles went to unknowns, but Welles's contract left them with no say in the matter. The film features debuts from William Alland, Agnes Moorehead, Everett Sloane, Ruth Warrick and Welles himself. An uncredited [[Alan Ladd]] appears as one of the newspaper reporters.

==Production==
===Development===
Orson Welles' notoriety following ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]'' broadcast earned him [[Hollywood]]'s interest, and [[RKO]] studio head [[George Schaefer (film producer)|George J. Schaefer's]] unusual contract.&lt;ref name=anatomy&gt;{{cite video | people = [[Barry Norman]] (host) | title = Anatomy of a Classic | medium = DVD | publisher = [[Universal Studios|Universal]] |date= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welles made a deal with Schaefer on July 21, 1939 to produce, direct, write, and act in two feature films.&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer&quot;&gt;Carringer 1996, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The studio had to approve the story and the budget if it exceeded $500,000. Welles was allowed to develop the story without interference, cast his own actors and crew members, and have the [[final cut privilege|privilege of final cut]]&amp;nbsp;– unheard of at the time for a first-time director.&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer&quot;/&gt; He had spent the first five months of his RKO contract trying to get several projects going with no success. The ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'' said, &quot;They are laying bets over on the RKO lot that the Orson Welles deal will end up without Orson ever doing a picture there.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer2&quot;&gt;Carringer 1996, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; First, Welles tried to adapt ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', but there was concern over the idea to depict it entirely with [[point of view shot]]s. Welles considered adapting [[Cecil Day-Lewis]]' novel ''The Smiler With The Knife'', but realized that to challenge himself with a new medium, he had to write an original story.&lt;ref name=empire&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Kim Newman|Newman, Kim]]|coauthors=[[Ian Freer]], Rob Fraser|title=Citizen Kane|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=July 2003|pages=146 to 156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz was recuperating from a car accident and in-between jobs. He had originally been hired by Welles to work on ''The Campbell Playhouse'' radio program and was available to work on the screenplay for Welles' film. The writer had only received two screenplay credits between 1935 and his work on ''Citizen Kane'' and needed the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer3&quot;&gt;Carringer 1996, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; There is dispute amongst historians regarding whose idea it was to use William Randolph Hearst as the basis for Charles Foster Kane. Welles claimed it was his idea while film critic [[Pauline Kael]] (in her essay &quot;Raising Kane&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in Kael, et al ''The Citizen Kane Book'', Little, Brown, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;) and Welles' former business partner [[John Houseman]] claim that it was Mankiewicz's idea.&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer4&quot;&gt;Carringer 1996, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; For some time, Mankiewicz had wanted to write a screenplay about a public figure&amp;nbsp;– perhaps a gangster&amp;nbsp;– whose story would be told by the people that knew him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Callow&quot;&gt;Callow 1995, p. 484.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mankiewicz had already written an unperformed play entitled, ''The Tree Will Grow'' about [[John Dillinger]]. Welles liked the idea of multiple viewpoints but was not interested in playing Dillinger. Mankiewicz and Welles talked about picking someone else to use a model. They hit on the idea of using Hearst as their central character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Callow&quot;/&gt; Mankiewicz had frequented Hearst's parties until his alcoholism got him barred. The writer resented this and became obsessed with Hearst and Marion Davies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Callow&quot;/&gt; Hearst had great influence and the power to retaliate within Hollywood so Welles had Mankiewicz work on the script outside of the city. Because of the writer's drinking problem, Houseman went along to provide assistance and make sure that he stayed focused.&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer4&quot;/&gt; Welles also sought inspiration from [[Howard Hughes]] and [[Samuel Insull]] (who built an opera house for his girlfriend). Although Mankiewicz and Houseman got on well with Welles, they incorporated some of his traits into Kane, such as his temper.&lt;ref name=empire/&gt;

During production, ''Citizen Kane'' was referred to as ''RKO 281''. Most of the filming took place between June 29, 1940 and October 23, 1940 in what is now Stage 19 on the Paramount lot in [[Hollywood]]. There was some location filming with [[Balboa Park]] in [[San Diego]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdnn.com/sandiego/2009-12-09/things-to-do/me-and-orson-welles-star-christian-mckay-brings-legend-to-life|title=Me and Orson Welles' star Christian McKay brings legend to life|publisher=SDNN.com|accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Diego Zoo]] and [[Oheka Castle]] in [[Huntington, New York]] representing Kane's San Simeon estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oheka.com/index.php?page=filmtvphoto|title=Oheka Castle - Film, TV &amp; Still Photography|publisher=Oheka.com|accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welles prevented studio executives of [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] from visiting the set. He understood their desire to control projects and he knew they were expecting him to do an exciting film that would correspond to his ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]'' radio broadcast. Welles' RKO contract had given him complete control over the production of the film when he signed on with the studio, something that he never again was allowed to exercise when making motion pictures. According to an RKO cost sheet from May 1942, the film cost $839,727 compared to an estimated budget of $723,800.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFIcat&quot;/&gt;

===Pre-release controversy===
Welles ran a closed set, limited access to [[dailies|rushes]] and managed the publicity of ''Kane'' to make sure that its influence from Hearst's life was a secret.&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer29&quot;&gt;Carringer 1996, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Publicity materials stated the film's inspiration was ''[[Faust]]''.&lt;ref name=empire/&gt; RKO hoped to release the film in mid-February 1941. Writers for national magazines had early deadlines and so a rough cut was previewed for a select few on January 3, 1941. ''Friday'' magazine ran an article drawing point-by-point comparisons between Kane and Hearst and documented how Welles had led on [[Louella Parsons]], Hollywood correspondent for Hearst papers, and made a fool of her in public. Reportedly, she was furious and demanded an immediate preview of the film. [[James Stewart (actor)|James Stewart]], who was present at the screening, said that she walked out of the film. Soon after, Parsons called George Schaefer and threatened RKO with a lawsuit if they released ''Kane''.&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer29&quot;/&gt; The next day, the front page headline in ''Daily Variety'' read, &quot;HEARST BANS RKO FROM PAPERS.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailyvariety&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Hearst Bans RKO From Papers | pages = | language = | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]] | date = January 10, 1941 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In two weeks, the ban was lifted for everything except ''Kane.''&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer29&quot;/&gt;

''The Hollywood Reporter'' ran a front-page story on January 13 that Hearst papers were about to run a series of editorials attacking Hollywood's practice of hiring refugees and immigrants for jobs that could be done by Americans. The goal was to put pressure on the other studios in order to force RKO to shelve ''Kane''.&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer29&quot;/&gt; Soon afterwards, Schaefer was approached by Nicholas Scheck, head of MGM's parent company, with an offer on the behalf of [[Louis B. Mayer]] and other Hollywood executives to reimburse RKO if it would destroy the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer30&quot;&gt;Carringer 1996, p. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Once RKO's legal team reassured Schaefer, the studio announced on January 21 that ''Kane'' would be released as scheduled and with one of the largest promotional campaigns in the studio's history. Schaefer brought Welles to New York City for a private screening of the film with the New York corporate heads of the studios and their lawyers.&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer31&quot;&gt;Carringer 1996, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no objection to its release provided that certain changes, including the removal or softening of specific references that might offend Hearst, were made.&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer32&quot;&gt;Carringer 1996, p. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; Welles agreed and Wise was brought in to cut the film's running time from two hours, two minutes and 40 seconds to one hour, 59 minutes and 16 seconds. This cut of ''Kane'' satisfied the corporate lawyers.&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer33&quot;&gt;Carringer 1996, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mankiewicz as co-writer====
Richard Carringer, author of ''The Making of Citizen Kane'' (1996), described the early stages of the screenplay:
:&quot;Welles's first step toward the realization of ''Citizen Kane'' was to seek the assistance of a screenwriting professional. Fortunately, help was near at hand.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. When Welles moved to Hollywood, it happened that a veteran screenwriter, [[Herman Mankiewicz]], was recuperating from an automobile accident and between jobs... Mankiewicz was an expatriate from Broadway who had been writing for films for almost fifteen years.&quot;&lt;ref name=Carringer/&gt;{{Rp|16|date=May 2009}}

However, according to film author Harlan Lebo, he was also &quot;one of Hollywood's most notorious personalities.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lebo&gt;Lebo, Harlan. ''Citizen Kane: Fiftieth Anniversary Album'', Doubleday Publishing (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|12|date=May 2009}} Mankiewicz was the older brother of producer-director [[Joseph Mankiewicz]] and was a former writer for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and the ''[[New York Times]]'' and had moved to Hollywood in 1926. By the time Welles contacted him he had &quot;established himself as a brilliant wit, a writer of extraordinary talent, [and] a warm friend to many of the screen world's brightest artists&amp;nbsp;... [he] produced dialogue of the highest caliber.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lebo/&gt;{{Rp|12|date=May 2009}} Yet Mankiewicz's behavior, according to Welles's close friend and associate [[John Houseman]], was also a &quot;public and private scandal. A neurotic and homophobic drinker and compulsive gambler...&quot; Houseman adds, however, that he was also one of the most intelligent, informed, witty, humane and charming men I have ever known.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lebo/&gt;{{Rp|12|date=May 2009}} Despite those apparent contradictions in his personality, Welles &quot;recognized the writer's abilities and trusted him to produce&quot;, wrote Lebo. Orson Welles himself later commented, &quot;Nobody was more miserable, more bitter, and funnier than Mank—a perfect monument to self-destruction. But when the bitterness wasn't focused straight at you &amp;ndash; he was the best company in the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lebo/&gt;

====Ideas and collaboration====
According to film historian Clinton Heylin, &quot;the idea of ''Citizen Kane'' was the original conception of Orson Welles, who in early 1940 first discussed the idea with [[John Houseman]], who then suggested that both he and Welles leave for Los Angeles and discuss the idea with scriptwriter [[Herman Mankiewicz]]. He adds that Mankiewicz &quot;probably believed that Welles had little experience as an original scriptwriter...[and] may even have felt that ''John Citizen USA'', Welles's working title, was a project he could make his own.&quot;&lt;ref name=Heylin&gt;Heylin, Clinton. ''Despite the System: Orson Welles Versus the Hollywood Studios'', Chicago Review Press (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|43|date=May 2009}} Orson Welles said that his preparation before making Citizen Kane was to watch [[John Ford]]'s ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' forty times.&lt;ref&gt;McBride, Joseph. Searching for John Ford: A Life,  Macmillan, 2003,  ISBN 0312310110, pp. 299-300&lt;/ref&gt;

Still incapacitated with a broken leg, Mankiewicz was happy to work with Welles, and an &quot;alliance&quot; formed, noted Houseman. This combination of a &quot;brash new director, a nervous studio, and an erratic genius&quot; gave birth to ''Citizen Kane'', in what Houseman called, &quot;an absurd venture.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lebo/&gt;{{Rp|14|date=May 2009}}

Houseman recalled that Mankiewicz, during his convalescence, had &quot;revived a long-simmering idea of creating a film biography in which a man's life would be brought to the screen after his death through the memories and opinions of the people who knew him best.&quot; And Welles himself, writes Lebo, also had ideas &quot;that meshed well with this concept and had considered a newspaper publisher the best subject for the story:

:&quot;I'd been nursing an old notion—the idea of telling the same thing several times—and showing exactly the same thing from wholly different views&quot;, Welles said. &quot;Mank liked it, so we started searching for the man it was going to be about&amp;nbsp;... some big American figure&amp;nbsp;... [[Howard Hughes]] was the first idea. But we got pretty quickly to the press lords.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lebo/&gt;{{Rp|14|date=May 2009}}

Welles then assigned Mankiewicz, writes Lebo, &quot;to work on an original screenplay—not an adaptation as his first two projects would have been.&quot; Welles next traveled to New York and desperately &quot;pleaded and persuaded Houseman to return to Los Angeles to manage Mankiewicz and his writing schedule.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lebo/&gt;

====Hearst as story model====
According to film critic and author Pauline Kael, Mankiewicz &quot;was already caught up in the idea of a movie about Hearst&quot; when he was still working at the ''New York Times'', in 1925. She learned from his family's babysitter, Marion Fisher, that she once typed as &quot;he dictated a screenplay, organized in flashbacks. She recalls that he had barely started on the dictation, which went on for several weeks, when she remarked that it seemed to be about William Randolph Hearst, and he said, 'You're a smart girl.'&quot;&lt;ref name=Kael1/&gt;{{Rp|269|date=May 2009}}

In Hollywood, Mankiewicz had frequented Hearst's parties until his alcoholism got him barred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Callow&quot;/&gt; And Hearst was also a person known to Welles. &quot;Once that was decided&quot;, wrote author Don Kilbourne, &quot;Mankiewicz, Welles, and [[John Houseman]], a cofounder of the Mercury Theatre, rented a place in the desert, and the task of creating ''Citizen Kane'' began.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kilbourne&gt;Kilbourne, Don. ''Dictionary of Literary Biography: American Screenwriters'', Gale Research Co. (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|221|date=May 2009}} This &quot;place in the desert&quot; was on the historic Verde ranch on the Mojave River in Victorville. In later years, Houseman gave Mankiewicz &quot;total&quot; credit for &quot;the creation of ''Citizen Kane's'' script&quot; and credited Welles with &quot;the visual presentation of the picture.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lebo/&gt;{{Rp|32|date=May 2009}}

Mankiewicz was put under contract by [[Mercury Theater|Mercury Productions]] and was to receive no credit for his work as he was hired as a script doctor. According to his contract with RKO, Welles would be given sole screenplay credit, and had already written a rough script consisting of 300 pages of dialogue with occasional stage directions under the title of ''John Citizen, USA''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Callow&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--

The sled, being used by Kane to attack Thatcher when taken away from his parents, may also explain his later attitude towards life (including his relationship with his friends and women, his lust for power and his sometimes irrational behaviour). It seems to be that deprivation of his mother's care and love, the ruthless raising by Thatcher which resulted in an abnormal childhood, combined with unwanted wealth, had a traumatic impact upon his character. He felt unloved, and therefore sought love aggressively, at any cost, be it from his wives, the public, his friends. His collapse is a result of his failure to fulfill this inner urge of his. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}--&gt;

===Debate over authorship===

John Houseman (right) is holding a copy of the screenplay.]]
One of the long standing debates of ''Citizen Kane'' has been the proper accreditation of the authorship of the screenplay, which the credits attribute to both [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] and [[Orson Welles]]. Mankiewicz biographer Richard Meryman notes that the dispute had various causes, including the way the movie was promoted. For instance, when RKO opened the movie on Broadway on May 1, 1941, followed by showings at theaters in other large cities, the publicity programs that were printed included photographs of Welles as &quot;the one-man band, directing, acting, and writing.&quot; In a letter to his father afterward, Mankiewicz wrote, &quot;I'm particularly furious at the incredibly insolent description of how Orson wrote his masterpiece. The fact is that there isn't one single line in the picture that wasn't in writing &amp;ndash; writing from and by me &amp;ndash; before ever a camera turned.&quot;&lt;ref name=Meryman&gt;Meryman, Richard. ''Mank'', William Morrow, (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|270|date=May 2009}} Film historian Otto Friedrich said it made Mankiewicz &quot;unhappy to hear Welles quoted in [[Louella Parsons]]'s column, before the question of screen credits was officially settled, as saying, 'So I wrote ''Citizen Kane''.'&quot;&lt;ref name=Friedrich/&gt;

According to film critic [[Pauline Kael]], Rita Alexander, who was hired to be Mankiewicz's personal secretary, stated that she &quot;took the dictation from Mankiewicz from the first paragraph to the last&amp;nbsp;... and later did the final rewriting and the cuts, and handled the script at the studio until after the film was shot. ...[and said] Welles didn't write (or dictate) one line of the shooting script of ''Citizen Kane.'' She added that &quot;Welles himself came to dinner once or twice...[and] she didn't meet him until after Mankiewicz had finished dictating the long first draft.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kael1/&gt;{{Rp|273|date=May 2009}} However Welles had his own secretary, Katherine Trosper, who typed up Welles' suggestions and corrections, which were incorporated into the final script; Kael did not interview Trosper before producing her article.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arena&quot;&gt;BBC, ''Arena: The Orson Welles Story'', 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Mankiewicz went to the [[Screen Writers Guild]] and declared that he was the original author. Welles later claimed that he planned on a joint credit all along, but Mankiewicz claimed that Welles offered him a bonus of ten thousand dollars if he would let Welles take full credit.&quot;&lt;ref name=Friedrich&gt;Friedrich, Otto, ''City of Nets&amp;nbsp;— a portrait of Hollywood in 1940s'', (1986) Harper &amp; Row&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pauline Kael, &quot;he had ample proof of his authorship, and when he took his evidence to the Screen Writers Guild&amp;nbsp;... Welles was forced to split the credit and take second place in the listing.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kael1&gt;Kael, Pauline. ''For Keeps'', Penguin Books (1994), republished section from ''Raising Kane'', 1971&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|274|date=May 2009}}

Kael argues that Mankiewicz was the true author of the screenplay and therefore responsible for much of what made the movie great. This angered many critics of the day, most notably critic-turned-filmmaker (and close friend of Welles) [[Peter Bogdanovich]], who rebutted many of Kael's claims in an article for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' titled ''The Kane Mutiny'', and [[Robert L. Carringer]], who did likewise in an article for the Winter 1978 edition of ''Critical Enquiry'', referring to early script drafts with Welles' incorporated handwritten contributions. [[Charles Lederer]], a screenwriter and a source for Kael's article, insisted that the credit never came to the Writer's Guild for arbitration.

By the time the movie was released, however, Mankiewicz's contribution to the film was generally known, according to Kael. The ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote the credit as &quot;Written by Herman Mankiewicz;&quot; Burns Mantle, in his newspaper column, referred to Mankiewicz having written it; and [[Ben Hecht]] wrote, &quot;This movie was not written by Orson Welles. It is the work of Herman J. Mankiewicz.&quot; Kael noted in 1971 that &quot;Under the present rules of the Guild, Welles's name would probably not have appeared.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kael1/&gt; She also came to an ironic conclusion:

{{bquote|And so it was by an awful fluke of justice that when Academy Awards night came, and Welles should have got the awards he deserved as director and actor, the award he got (the only Academy Award he has ever got) was as co-author of the Best Original Screenplay.}}

According to film critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], however, &quot;No one can now deny Herman Mankiewicz credit for the germ, shape, and pointed language of the screenplay, but no one who has seen the film as often as it deserves to be seen would dream that Welles is not its only begetter.&quot;&lt;ref name=Thomson&gt;{{cite book| first=David | last=Thomson | title= A New Biographical Dictionary of Film| location= London| publisher= Little Brown | year=2002 | page=924}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carringer considered that at least three scenes were solely Welles' work and, after weighing both sides of the argument, including sworn testimony from Mercury assistant Richard Baer, concluded, &quot;We will probably never know for sure, but in any case Welles had at last found a subject with the right combination of monumentality, timeliness, and audacity.&quot;&lt;ref name=Carringer&gt;Carringer, Robert L. ''The Making of Citizen Kane'', (2nd ed., revised) University of California Press (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|17|date=May 2009}} Harlan Lebo agrees, and adds, &quot;of far greater relevance is reaffirming the importance of the efforts that both men contributed to the creation of Hollywood's greatest motion picture.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lebo&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|32|date=May 2009}}

[[French New Wave]] filmmaker and auteur [[Jean-Luc Godard]] said on the topic of Orson Welles, &quot;Everyone will always owe him everything.&quot;

==Sources==
===Charles Foster Kane===
====William Randolph Hearst====
Welles never confirmed who the principal source was for the character of Charles Foster Kane. It is believed that he is a synthesis of different personalities although main inspiration was the life of media tycoon [[William Randolph Hearst]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;&gt;Epstein, Michael and Thomas Lennon. [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kane2/kane2ts.html &quot;The Battle Over Citizen Kane.&quot;] ''[[PBS]]'', 1996. Retrieved: January 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The film is seen by critics as a fictionalized, unrelentingly hostile [[parody]] of Hearst. According to film historian Don Kilbourne, &quot;much of the information for ''Citizen Kane'' came from already-published material about Hearst... [and] some of Kane's speeches are almost verbatim copies of Hearst's. When Welles denied that the film was about the still-influential publisher, he did not convince many people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kilbourne&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|222|date=May 2009}}

Welles himself insisted that there were also differences between the men. In 1968, he told [[Peter Bogdanovich]], &quot;You know, the real story of Hearst is quite different from Kane's. And Hearst himself — as a man, I mean — was very different.&quot; Hearst's biographer, David Nasaw, finds the film's depiction of Hearst unfair:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Welles' ''Kane'' is a cartoon-like caricature of a man who is hollowed out on the inside, forlorn, defeated, solitary because he cannot command the total obedience, loyalty, devotion, and love of those around him. Hearst, to the contrary, never regarded himself as a failure, never recognized defeat, never stopped loving Marion [Davies] or his wife. He did not, at the end of his life, run away from the world to entomb himself in a vast, gloomy art-choked hermitage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nasaw&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Nasaw | first = David | coauthors = | title = The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst | work = | page = 574 | language = | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin]] | year = 2000 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Samuel Insull====
''Citizen Kane'' is in part based on the life of [[Samuel Insull]] and his wife Gladys. Playwright Herman J. Mankiewicz based Susan Alexander's catastrophic operatic debut in ''Citizen Kane'' on Gladys Wallis Insull's New York role as Lady Teazle in a charity revival of ''[[The School for Scandal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Higham, Charles, ''Orson Welles: Rise and Fall of an American Genius'', (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Jed Leland's review of Susan Alexander's debut in ''Kane'' echoes Mankiewicz's actual 1925 review of Gladys Insull. His 1925 review began: &quot;As Lady Teazle, Mrs. Insull is as pretty as she is diminutive; with a clear smile and dainty gestures. There is a charming grace in her bearing that makes for excellent deportment. But Lady Teazle seems much too innocent to lend credit to her part in the play.&quot;

====Welles as Kane====
[[File:Orson Welles-Citizen Kane1.jpg|alt=A mustachioed man in a suit leans on a lectern and points to his right. Behind him to the left is a large picture of himself wearing a hat.|thumb|right|250px|Orson Welles as Charles Foster Kane]]
There are autobiographical elements to the film. Orson Welles lost his mother when he was nine years old and his father when he was 15. After this, he became the ward of Chicago's Dr. Maurice Bernstein; Bernstein is the last name of the only major character in ''Citizen Kane'' who receives a generally positive portrayal.

===Susan Alexander===
Movie tycoon [[Jules Brulatour]]'s second and third wives, [[Dorothy Gibson]] and [[Hope Hampton]], both fleeting stars of the silent screen who later had marginal careers in opera, are believed to have provided inspiration for the Susan Alexander character.

Welles also claimed that business tycoon [[Harold Fowler McCormick]]'s lavish promotion of his second wife, [[Ganna Walska]], was a direct influence on the screenplay. McCormick spent thousands of dollars on voice lessons for her and even arranged for Walska to take the lead in a production of ''[[Zaza (play)|Zaza]]'' at the Chicago Opera in 1920. Like the Susan Alexander character, she had a terrible voice, pleasing only to McCormick. But unlike Alexander, Walska got into an argument with director Pietro Cimini during dress rehearsal and stormed out of the production before she appeared. [[Roger Ebert]], in his DVD commentary on ''Citizen Kane'', also suggests that the Alexander character was based on Walska, and had very little to do with [[Marion Davies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebertcommentary&quot;/&gt; The film's composer, [[Bernard Herrmann]], also suggested that Kane is based on McCormick but also in great part on Welles himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;americancomposers&quot;/&gt;

===Jim Gettys===
The character of political boss Jim Gettys is based on [[Charles F. Murphy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Methuen | isbn = 9780413582904 | last = Mankiewicz | first = Herman Jacob | coauthors = Orson Welles, Pauline Kael | title = The Citizen Kane book | year = 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a political leader in New York City's infamous [[Tammany Hall]] political machine, who was an enemy of Hearst. In one scene Gettys admonishes Kane for printing a cartoon showing him in prison stripes. This is based on the fact that Murphy, who was a horse-cart driver and owned several bars, was depicted in a 1903 Hearst cartoon wearing striped prison clothes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy&quot;/&gt; A caption, referring to the restaurant Murphy frequented, said: &quot;Look out, Murphy. It's a short lock-step from [[Delmonico's Restaurant|Delmonico's]] to [[Sing Sing]].&quot;

===Rosebud===
According to Welles author David Thomson, &quot;Rosebud is the greatest secret in cinema...&quot;&lt;ref name=Thomson/&gt;{{Rp|801|date=May 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, David, ''The Story of Orson Welles'' (1996) Vintage Books&lt;/ref&gt;

Orson Welles, explaining the idea behind the word &quot;Rosebud&quot;, said, &quot;It's a gimmick, really, a rather tawdry device, a dollar-book [[Freudian psychology|Freudian]] gag.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kael, Pauline, ''The Citizen Kane Book'', Boston, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; Three &quot;Rosebud&quot; sleds were used in production, of which only one was not burned.

According to Louis Pizzitola, author of ''Hearst Over Hollywood'', &quot;Rosebud&quot; was a nickname that Orrin Peck, a friend of William Randolph Hearst, gave to his mother, Phoebe Hearst.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pizzitola&quot;&gt;Pizzitola, Louis. [http://www.hearstoverhollywood.com &quot;Hearst Over Hollywood.&quot;] [[Columbia University]] Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It was said that Phoebe was as close, or even closer, to Orrin than she was to her own son, lending a bitter-sweet element to the word's use in a film about a boy being separated from his mother's love.

In 1989, essayist [[Gore Vidal]] cited contemporary rumors that &quot;Rosebud&quot; was a nickname Hearst used for his mistress [[Marion Davies]]; a reference to her [[clitoris]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Vidal&quot;&gt;Vidal, Gore. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/4016 &quot;Remembering Orson Welles.&quot;] ''[[New York Times]]'', June 1, 1989. Retrieved: 14 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vidal2&quot;&gt;Vidal, Gore. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/3942 &quot;Rosebud.&quot;] ''[[New York Times]]'', August 17, 1989. Retrieved: 14 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; a claim repeated as fact in the 1996 documentary ''The Battle Over Citizen Kane'' and again in the 1999 dramatic film ''[[RKO 281]]''.
Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] has been a bit more specific than Vidal about the source, saying on his commentary track for the September 2001 DVD release that &quot;[[Herman J. Mankiewicz|Herman Mankiewicz]], the co-author with Welles of the screenplay, happened to know that &quot;Rosebud&quot; was William Randolph Hearst's [[pet name]] for an intimate part of Marion Davies' anatomy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebertcommentary&quot;&gt;{{cite video |people= Ebert, Roger |date= 2001 |title=Audio Commentary |medium= DVD |publisher=Turner Entertainment/Warner Home Video |time=2:48 |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote=Some people have fallen in love with the story that Herman Mankiewicz, the co-author with Welles of the screenplay, happened to know that &quot;Rosebud&quot; was William Randolph Hearst's pet name for Marion Davies' cliterus. |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= A Viewer's Companion to 'Citizen Kane' | url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040101/COMMENTARY/401010335 | publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date= January 1, 2004 | last=Ebert | first=Roger |  accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A resultant joke noted, with heavy innuendo, that Hearst and/or Kane died &quot;with 'Rosebud' on his lips.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;/&gt;

Another theory of the origin of &quot;Rosebud&quot; is the similarity with the dying wish of [[Basil Zaharoff]] (who is one of the inspirations for the central character), to be wheeled &quot;by the rosebush&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/31126df4-7120-11e0-acf5-00144feabdc0.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filmmaking innovations==
===Cinematography===
[[File:Citizen Kane deep focus.jpg|alt=A stern looking man and a woman sit on the right side of a table with documents on the table. A top hat is on the table. An unkempt man stands to the left of the picture. In the background a boy can be seen through a window playing in the snow.|thumb|right|A deep focus shot: everything, including the hat in the foreground and the boy (young Kane) in the distance, is in sharp focus.]]Film scholars and historians view ''Citizen Kane'' as Welles' attempt to create a new style of [[filmmaking]] by studying various forms of movie making, and combining them all into one. The most innovative technical aspect of ''Citizen Kane'' is the extended use of [[deep focus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ogle&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Ogle | first = Patrick L | coauthors = Bill Nichols | title = Technological and Aesthetic Influences Upon the Development of Deep Focus Cinematography in the United States | work = Movies and Methods | page = 73 | language = | publisher = [[University of California]] Press | year = 1985 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In nearly every scene in the film, the foreground, background and everything in between are all in sharp focus. This was done by cinematographer [[Gregg Toland]] through his experimentation with lenses and lighting. Specifically, Toland often used telephoto lenses to shoot close-up scenes. Any time deep focus was impossible&amp;nbsp;— for example in the scene when Kane finishes a bad review of Alexander's opera while at the same time firing the person who started the review&amp;nbsp;— an [[optical printer]] was used to make the whole screen appear in focus (visually layering one piece of film onto another). However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of [[in-camera effect]]s, as in the famous example of the scene where Kane breaks into Susan Alexander's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.

Another unorthodox method used in the film was the way [[low-angle shot]]s were used to display a point of view facing upwards, thus allowing ceilings to be shown in the background of several scenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toland&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Toland | first = Gregg | coauthors = | title = The Motion Picture Cameraman | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = Theater Arts magazine |date = September 1941| url = http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=178 | accessdate = 2008-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since movies were primarily filmed on [[sound stage]]s and not on location during the era of the [[Hollywood]] [[studio system]], it was impossible to film at an angle that showed ceilings because the stages had none. In some instances, Welles' crew used [[muslin]] draped above the set to produce the illusion of a regular room with a ceiling, while the boom microphones were hidden above the cloth and even dug a trench into the floor to allow the low-angle shot to be used in the scene where Kane meets Leland after his election loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Orson Welles's citizen Kane: a casebook|publisher=OUP USA|last=Naremore|first=James|isbn=978-0195158915|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toland had approached Welles in 1940 to work on ''Citizen Kane''. Welles' reputation for experimentation in the theatre appealed to Toland and he found a sympathetic partner to &quot;test and prove several ideas generally being accepted as radical in Hollywood&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFIcat&quot;/&gt;

===Storytelling techniques===
''Citizen Kane'' eschews the traditional linear, chronological narrative and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback using different points of view, many of them from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the [[unreliable narrator]] in literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;watched&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Closely Watched Films: an introduction to the art of narrative film technique|first=Marilyn|last=Fabe|publisher=University of California Press|pages=81–84|isbn=978-0520238916|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welles also dispenses with the idea of a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood movies.&lt;ref name=&quot;watched&quot;/&gt; Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping.&lt;ref name=&quot;politics&quot;/&gt; The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with more questions than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a [[communist]] and a [[fascist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;watched&quot;/&gt; The technique of using flashbacks had been used in earlier films such as ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'' in 1939 and ''[[The Power and the Glory (film)|The Power and the Glory]]'' in 1933 but no film was so immersed in this technique as ''Citizen Kane''. The use of the reporter Thompson acts as a surrogate for the audience, questioning Kane's associates and piecing together his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;politics&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Politics and politicians in American film|first=Phillip L|last=Gianos|publisher=Greenwood Press|pages=170–184|isbn=978-0275967666|year=1999|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the narrative voices is the ''News on the March'' segment.&lt;ref name=&quot;watched&quot;/&gt; Its stilted dialogue and portentous voiceover is a parody of ''[[The March of Time]]'' newsreel series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma04/wood/mot/html/kane.htm|title=Citizen Kane and other imitators|publisher=University of Virginia|author=Mary Wood|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which itself references an earlier newsreel which showed the 85-year old arms czar [[Sir Basil Zaharoff]] getting wheeled to his train. Welles had earlier provided voiceovers for ''the March of Time'' radio show. ''Citizen Kane'' makes extensive use of stock footage to create the newsreel.

One of the story-telling techniques used in ''Citizen Kane'' was the use of montage to collapse time and space. Using an episodic sequence on the same set while the characters changed costume and make-up between cuts so that the scene following each cut would look as if it took place in the same location, but at a time long after the previous cut. In the breakfast montage, Welles chronicles the breakdown of Kane's first marriage in 5 vignettes, which takes 16 years of story time and condenses it into two minutes of screen time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Literature into film: theory and practical approaches|first=Linda|last=Costanzo Cahir|pages=59–60|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|isbn=978-0786425976|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Special effects====
Welles also pioneered several visual effects in order to cheaply shoot things like crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For example, the scene where the camera in the opera house rises dramatically to the rafters to show the workmen showing a lack of appreciation for the second Mrs. Kane's performance was shot by a camera [[Crane shot|craning]] upwards over the performance scene, then a [[wipe (transition)|curtain wipe]] to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then another curtain wipe matching it again with the scene of the workmen. Other scenes effectively employed miniatures to make the film look much more expensive than it truly was, such as various shots of [[Xanadu (Citizen Kane)|Xanadu]]. A loud, full-screen closeup of a typewriter typing a single word (&quot;weak&quot;), magnifies the review for the ''Chicago Inquirer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas, François|editor=Naremore, James|title=Citizen Kane: The Sound Track, in Orson Welles's Citizen Kane: A Casebook|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KzCH4UgSUr8C&amp;pg=PA173|page=173|publisher=Oxford University Press via Google Books limited preview|location=US|isbn=0-1951-5891-1|accessdate=2007-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Makeup====
The non-union make up artist Maurice Seiderman created the make-up for the film.&lt;ref name=anatomy/&gt; RKO wanted the young Kane to look handsome and dashing, and Seiderman transformed the already-overweight Welles, beginning with his nose, which Welles always disliked. Welles was as made up as a young man as he was an old man, and could barely move. For the old Kane, Seiderman created a red plastic compound which he applied to Welles, allowing the wrinkles to move naturally.&lt;ref name=anatomy/&gt; Kane's mustache was made of several hair tufts. Transforming Welles into the old Kane required six to seven hours, meaning he had to start at two in the morning to begin filming at nine, meaning he held conferences in the make-up chair, and would also work a total of 16 hours a day. Even breaking a leg during filming could not stop him from directing around-the-clock, and he quickly returned to acting, using a steel leg bracer.&lt;ref name=anatomy/&gt;

====Soundtrack====
Welles brought his experience with sound from radio along to filmmaking, producing a layered and complex soundtrack. In one scene, the elderly Kane strikes Susan in a tent on the beach, and the two characters silently glower at each other while a woman at the nearby party can be heard hysterically laughing in the background, her giddiness in grotesque counterpoint to the misery of Susan and Kane. Elsewhere, Welles skillfully employed reverberation to create a mood, such as the chilly echo of the monumental Thatcher library, where the reporter is confronted by an intimidating, officious librarian.

In addition to expanding on the potential of sound as a creator of moods and emotions, Welles pioneered a new aural technique, known as the &quot;lightning-mix&quot;. Welles used this technique to link complex [[film editing|montage]] sequences via a series of related sounds or phrases. In offering a continuous sound track, Welles was able to join what would otherwise be extremely rough cuts together into a smooth narrative. For example, the audience witnesses Kane grow from a child into a young man in just two [[shot (film)|shots]]. As Kane's guardian hands him his sled, Kane begrudgingly wishes him a &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;. Suddenly we are taken to a shot of his guardian fifteen years later, only to have the phrase completed for us: &quot;and a Happy New Year&quot;. In this case, the continuity of the soundtrack, not the image, is what makes for a seamless narrative structure.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

Welles also carried over techniques from radio not yet popular in the movies (though they would become staples). Using a number of voices, each saying a sentence or sometimes merely a fragment of a sentence, and splicing the dialogue together in quick succession, the result gave the impression of a whole town talking&amp;nbsp;— and, equally important, what the town was talking about. Welles also favored the overlapping of dialogue, considering it more realistic than the stage and movie tradition of characters not stepping on each other's sentences. He also pioneered the technique of putting the audio ahead of the visual in scene transitions (a [[J-cut]]); as a scene would come to a close, the audio would transition to the next scene before the visuals did.

===Music===
In common with using personnel he had previously worked with in the Mercury Theatre, Welles recruited his close friend [[Bernard Herrmann]] to score Citizen Kane.&lt;ref name=&quot;herrmann&quot;/&gt; Herrmann was a longtime collaborator with Welles, providing music for almost all his radio broadcasts including ''The Fall of the City'' (1937) and the ''War of the Worlds'' (1938) broadcast.&lt;ref name=&quot;stephensmith&quot;/&gt; The film was Herrmann's first motion picture score&lt;ref name=&quot;herrmann&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviemusicuk.us/herrmann.htm|publisher=Moviemusicuk.us|title=Bernard Herrmann|accessdate=2009-01-22}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would be nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]], but would lose out to his own score for the film ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster (1941 film)|All That Money Can Buy]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;herrmann&quot;/&gt;

Herrmann's score for Citizen Kane was a watershed in film soundtrack composition and proved as influential as any of the film's other innovations, establishing him as an important voice in film soundtrack composition.&lt;ref name=&quot;americancomposers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americancomposers.org/raksin_herrmann.htm|title=American Composers Orchestra&amp;nbsp;— David Raksin remembers his colleagues|publisher=Americancomposers.org|accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stephensmith&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith |first= Stephen C.|title= A Heart at Fire's Center: The Life and Music of Bernard Herrmann|publisher= [[University of California Press]] |year= 2002 |pages= 76–84|isbn= 0520229398}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score eschewed the typical Hollywood practice of scoring a film with virtually non-stop music. Instead Herrmann used what he later described as '&quot;radio scoring&quot;, musical cues which typically lasted between five and fifteen seconds to bridge the action or suggest a different emotional response. One of the most effective musical cues was the &quot;Breakfast Montage.&quot; The scene begins with a graceful waltz theme and gets darker with each variation on that theme as the passage of time leads to the hardening of Kane's personality and the breakup of his marriage to Emily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/CitizenKanefilmscore.htm|title=70th anniversary of CITIZEN KANE and Bernard Herrmann's film score|accessdat=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herrmann realized that musicians slated to play his music were hired for individual unique sessions; there was no need to write for existing ensembles. This meant that he was free to score for unusual combinations of instruments, even instruments that are not commonly heard. In the opening sequence, for example, the tour of Kane's estate Xanadu, Herrmann introduces a recurring [[leitmotiv]] played by low [[woodwind]]s, including a quartet of bass [[flutes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stephensmith&quot;/&gt; Much of the music used in the newsreel was taken from other sources; examples include the ''News on the March'' music which was taken from RKO's music library, ''Belgian March'' by [[Anthony Vincent Collins|Anthony Collins]], and accompanies the newsreel titles; and an excerpt from [[Alfred Newman]]'s score for ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'' which is used as the background for the exploration of Xanadu.&lt;ref name=&quot;stephensmith&quot;/&gt; In the final sequence of the film, which shows the destruction of Rosebud in the fireplace of Kane's castle, Welles choreographed the scene while he had Herrmann's cue playing on the set.&lt;ref name=&quot;alexross&quot;&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/06/27/050627crmu_music|title=Sound and Vision: The New Yorker|publisher=NewYorker.com|
accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the operatic sequence which exposed Kane's protege Susan Alexander for the amateur she was, Herrmann composed a quasi-romantic scene, ''Aria from Salammbô''.&lt;ref name=&quot;americancomposers&quot;/&gt; There did exist two treatments of this work by [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s 1862 novel, including an opera by [[Ernest Reyer]] and an incomplete treatment by [[Modeste Mussorgsky]]. However, Herrmann made no reference to existing music. Herrmann put the aria in a key that would force the singer to strain to reach the high notes, culminating in a high D, well outside the range of Susan Alexander.&lt;ref name=&quot;americancomposers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stephensmith&quot;/&gt; Herrmann said he wanted to convey the impression of &quot;a terrified girl floundering in the quicksand of a powerful orchestra&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;americancomposers&quot;/&gt; On the soundtrack it was soprano [[Jean Forward]] who actually sang the vocal part for actress [[Dorothy Comingore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;americancomposers&quot;/&gt;

In 1972 Herrmann said &quot;I was fortunate to start my career with a film like ''Citizen Kane'', it's been a downhill run ever since!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;stephensmith&quot;/&gt; Shortly before his death in 1985, Welles told director [[Henry Jaglom]] that the score was fifty per cent responsible for the film's artistic success.&lt;ref name=&quot;stephensmith&quot;/&gt;

However, Herrmann was vocal in his criticism of Pauline Kael's claim that it was Mankiewicz, not Welles, who made the main thrust of the film, and also her assumptions about the use of music in the film without consulting him:
:Pauline Kael has written in ''The Citizen Kane Book'' (1971), that the production wanted to use Massenet's &quot;Thais&quot; but could not afford the fee. &quot;But Miss Kael never wrote or approached me to ask about the music. We could easily have afforded the fee. The point is that its lovely little strings would not have served the emotional purpose of the film.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=176 |title=The Orson Welles Web Resource &quot; Blog Archive &quot; BERNARD HERRMANN on working with ORSON WELLES and CITIZEN KANE |publisher=Wellesnet |date=2007-06-24 |accessdate=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opera lovers are frequently amused by the parody of vocal coaching that appears in a singing lesson given to Susan Alexander by Signor Matiste. The character attempts to sing the famous cavatina &quot;Una voce poco fa&quot; from ''[[Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' by [[Gioachino Rossini]], but the lesson is interrupted when Alexander sings a high note flat.

An uncredited [[Nat King Cole]] is believed to provide the music in two key scenes in the film. He can be heard playing piano, but not singing, &quot;This Can't Be Love&quot; (actually sung by Alton Redd),&lt;ref name=&quot;Meeker&quot;/&gt; in the scene where Susan fights with Kane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Naremore&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Orson Welle's Citizen Kane:a casebook|author=Naremore,James|isbn=0195158911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welles heard him playing at a bar and created the scene around the song.&lt;ref name=&quot;Naremore&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|28-29|date=May 2010}} Unconfirmed reports suggest he can also be heard playing in the scene where Thompson questions a down-at-heel Susan in the nightclub she works;&lt;ref name=&quot;Meeker&quot;/&gt; however, Bernard Herrmann denied any knowledge of this to musicologist David Meeker.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meeker&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.jots.200014490/default.html|title=CITIZEN KANE/Orson Welles Bibliographic Record Brief Display|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release and contemporary responses===
''Citizen Kane'' was supposed to open at [[Radio City Music Hall]] but did not because Parsons told [[Nelson Rockefeller]] that if the film was screened, Hearst's ''American Weekly'' magazine would run a negative article about his grandfather.&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer34&quot;&gt;Carringer 1996, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Other exhibitors feared retaliation and refused to handle the film. Schaefer lined up a few theaters but Welles grew impatient and threatened RKO with a lawsuit. Hearst papers refused to accept advertising for the film. ''Kane'' opened at the RKO Palace on Broadway in New York on May 1, 1941, in [[Chicago]] on May 6, and in Los Angeles on May 8.&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer34&quot;/&gt; ''Kane'' did well in cities and larger towns but fared poorly in more remote areas. RKO still had problems getting exhibitors to show the film. For example, one chain controlling more than 500 theaters got Welles' film as part of a package but refused to play it, reportedly out of fear of Hearst.&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer35&quot;&gt;Carringer 1996, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The film lost $150,000 during its initial run.&lt;ref name=empire/&gt;

The reviews for the film were overwhelmingly positive, although some reviewers were challenged by Welles' break with Hollywood traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8231805 SCREEN REALISM MAY BE A LITTLE TOO REAL] Argus 7 February 1942, Supplement page 6&lt;/ref&gt; Kate Cameron, in her review for the ''New York Daily-News'', said that ''Kane'' was &quot;one of the most interesting and technically superior films that has ever come out of a Hollywood studio&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cameron&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Cameron | first = Kate | coauthors = | title = ''Citizen Kane'' | pages = | language = | work = New York Daily-News | date = May 2, 1941 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for the ''New World Telegram'', William Boehnel said that the film was &quot;staggering and belongs at once among the greatest screen achievements&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boehnel&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Boehnel | first = William | coauthors = | title = ''Citizen Kane'' | pages = | language = | work = New World Telegram | date = May 2, 1941 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otis Ferguson]], in his review for ''[[The New Republic]]'', said that ''Kane'' was &quot;the boldest free-hand stroke in major screen production since [[D.W.

In a 1941 review, [[Jorge Luis Borges]] called ''Citizen Kane'' a &quot;metaphysical detective story&quot;, in that &quot;...&amp;nbsp;[its] subject (both psychological and allegorical) is the investigation of a man's inner self, through the works he has wrought, the words he has spoken, the many lives he has ruined...&quot; Borges noted that &quot;Overwhelmingly, endlessly, Orson Welles shows fragments of the life of the man, Charles Foster Kane, and invites us to combine them and reconstruct him.&quot; As well, &quot;Forms of multiplicity and incongruity abound in the film: the first scenes record the treasures amassed by Kane; in one of the last, a poor woman, luxuriant and suffering, plays with an enormous jigsaw puzzle on the floor of a palace that is also a museum.&quot; Borges points out, &quot;At the end we realize that the fragments are not governed by a secret unity: the detested Charles Foster Kane is a [[simulacrum]], a chaos of appearances.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Borges&quot;&gt;Borges, Jorge Luis.

It was widely thought the film would win most of the awards it was nominated for, but it only won the [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Best Writing (Original Screenplay)]] Oscar.&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer35&quot;/&gt;

Film editor [[Robert Wise]] recalled each time ''Citizen Kane''{{'}}s name was called out as a nominee, the crowd booed.&lt;ref name=battle&gt;{{cite video|title=[[The Battle Over Citizen Kane]]|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]|date=January 29, 1996|format=Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wise's interview, found in [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/kane2/ ''The Battle Over Citizen Kane''], PBS&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Hollywood did not want the film to see the light of day, considering the threats that William Randolph Hearst had made if it did. According to ''Variety'', bloc voting against Welles by screen extras denied him Best Picture and Actor awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;oscars&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Extras Scuttled Welles | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = March 4, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; British film critic [[Barry Norman]] attributed this to Hearst's wrath.&lt;ref name=anatomy/&gt;

In December 2007, Welles' Oscar for best original screenplay came up for auction at [[Sotheby's]] in [[New York]], but failed to reach its estimate of $800,000 to $1.2 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;oscarsale&quot;/&gt; The Oscar, which was believed to have been lost by Welles, was rediscovered in 1994 and is owned by the [[Dax Foundation]], a Los Angeles based charity.&lt;ref name=&quot;oscarsale&quot;/&gt; At the same sale, Welles' personal copy of the last revised draft of ''Citizen Kane'' before the shooting script, did sell for $97,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;oscarsale&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/11/AR2007121101455.html|title='Citizen Kane' Script sells for $97,000|publisher=Washingtonpost.com|accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Other awards=====
The [[National Board of Review]] gave 1941 &quot;Best Acting&quot; awards to Orson Welles and George Coulouris, and the film itself &quot;Best Picture.&quot; That same year, the ''[[New York Times]]'' named it one of the Ten Best Films of the year, and the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award]] for &quot;Best Picture&quot; also went to ''Citizen Kane''.&lt;ref&gt;Allmovie [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:9737~T4 Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hearst's response===
Hearing about the film enraged Hearst so much that he banned any advertising, reviewing or mentioning of it in his papers, and had his journalists [[libel]] Welles. Following lobbying from Hearst, the head of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Louis B Mayer]], acting on behalf of the whole film industry, made an offer to RKO Pictures of $805,000 to destroy all prints of the film and burn the negative.&lt;ref name=&quot;thomson2001&quot;/&gt; Welles used Hearst's opposition to ''Citizen Kane'' as a pretext for previewing the movie in several opinion-making screenings in Los Angeles, lobbying for its artistic worth against the hostile campaign that Hearst was waging.&lt;ref name=&quot;thomson2001&quot;/&gt;

When [[George Schaefer (film producer)|George Schaefer]] of RKO rejected Hearst's offer to suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] from reviewing&amp;nbsp;— or even mentioning&amp;nbsp;— the movie. He also had many movie theaters ban it, and many did not show it through fear of being socially exposed by his massive newspaper empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Street, Sarah 1996&quot;&gt;Street, Sarah. (1996). Citizen Kane. History Today, 46(3), 48. Retrieved October 26, 2009, from Research Library Core. (Document ID: 9345422).&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary ''[[The Battle Over Citizen Kane]]'' lays the blame for ''Citizen Kane''{{'}}s relative failure squarely at the feet of Hearst. The film did decent business at the box office; it went on to be the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, a modest success its backers found acceptable. Nevertheless, the film's commercial performance fell short of its creators' expectations. In ''The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst'', David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions were not the only reason ''Kane'' failed, however: the innovations Welles made with narrative, as well as the dark message at the heart of the film (that the pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not appreciate its merits.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, 572-573&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pair of ''[[Arena (TV series)|Arena]]'' documentaries about Welles' career produced and broadcast domestically by the [[BBC]] in 1982, Welles claimed that during opening week, a policeman approached him one night and told him: &quot;Do not go to your hotel room tonight; Hearst has set up an undressed, underage girl to leap into your arms when you enter and a photographer to take pictures of you. Hearst is planning to publish it in all of his papers.&quot; Welles thanked the man and stayed out all night. However, it is not confirmed whether this was true. Welles also described how he accidentally bumped into Hearst in an elevator at the [[Fairmont Hotel]] when ''Kane'' was opening in San Francisco. Welles' father had been friends with Hearst, so Welles tried to comfortably ask if Hearst would see the film. Hearst ignored him. &quot;As he was getting off at his floor, I said 'Charles Foster Kane would have accepted.' No reply&quot;, recalled the director. &quot;And Kane would have you know. That was his style.&quot;&lt;ref name=empire/&gt;

Although Hearst's efforts to suppress it damaged the film's success, they [[Streisand effect|backfired in the long run]], since almost every reference to Hearst's life and career made today typically includes a reference to the film's parallel to it. The irony of Hearst's efforts is that the film is now inexorably connected to him. This connection was reinforced by the publication in 1961 of [[W.A. Swanberg|W. A. Swanberg's]] extensive [[biography]], ''Citizen Hearst''.

===Subsequent re-evaluation and recognition===
By 1942 ''Citizen Kane'' had run its course theatrically and, apart from a few showings at big city arthouse cinemas, it largely vanished from America until 1956. In that period, ''Kane'''s and Welles' reputation fell among American critics. In 1949 critic [[Richard Griffith]] in his overview of cinema, ''The Film Till Now'', dismissed ''Kane'' as &quot;tinpot if not crackpot [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]].&quot;

Due to [[World War II]], ''Citizen Kane'' was little seen in Europe. It was not until 1946 that it was shown in [[France]], where it gained considerable acclaim, particularly from [[film critics]] such as [[André Bazin]] and from ''[[Cahiers du cinema]]'' writers, including future film directors [[François Truffaut]] and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]. In his 1950 essay &quot;The Evolution of Cinema&quot;, Bazin placed ''Citizen Kane'' centre stage as a work which ushered in a new period in cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bazin|first=Andre|title=What is Cinema?|publisher=University of California Press|year=1950|page=37|doi=1950|isbn =978-0520242272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, it was neglected and forgotten until its revival on television in the mid-1950s. Three key events in 1956 led to its re-evaluation in the United States. RKO was one of the first studios to sell its library to television and early that year ''Citizen Kane'' started to appear on television. Around the same time the film was rereleased theatrically to coincide with Welles return to the New York stage where he played ''[[King Lear]].'' That year American film critic [[Andrew Sarris]] wrote &quot;Citizen Kane: The American Baroque&quot; for ''[[Film Culture]]'' and described it as &quot;the great American film,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sarris&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Sarris | first = Andrew | coauthors = | title = ''Citizen Kane'': The American Baroque | pages = | language = | work = Film Culture | year = 1956 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; further enhancing the film's status. During the [[Expo 58]], a poll of over 100 film historians named ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' the greatest film ever made, while ''Kane'' was part of the top ten. When a group of young film directors cast their vote for their top six, they were booed at the announcement for not including the film.&lt;ref name=empire/&gt; In the decades since, its critical status as one of [[films that have been considered the greatest ever|the greatest films ever made]] has grown with numerous essays and books on it including influential books like Peter Cowie's ''The Cinema of Orson Welles'', Ronald Gottesman's ''Focus on Citizen Kane'', a collection of significant reviews and background pieces, and most notably Kael's essay, &quot;Raising ''Kane''&quot;, which promoted the value of the film to a much wider audience than it had reached before.&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer38&quot;&gt;Carringer 1996, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its criticism of Welles it further popularized the notion of ''Citizen Kane'' as ''the'' great American film. The rise of art house and film society circuits also aided in the film's rediscovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;carringer37&quot;&gt;Carringer 1996, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British magazine ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' has produced a Top Ten list surveying film critics every decade since 1952 and is regarded as one of the most respected barometers of critical taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title='Citizen Kane' fave film of movie elite | publisher=rogerebert.com | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020811/COMMENTARY/88010305|accessdate=2008-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Citizen Kane'' was a runner up to the top 10 in its 1952 poll but was voted as the greatest film ever made in its 1962 poll and&lt;ref name=&quot;BFI1962&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = The Sight &amp; Sound Top Ten Poll: 1962 | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[British Film Institute]] | year = 1962 | url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/history/1962.html | accessdate = 2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has retained the top spot in every subsequent poll.&lt;ref name=&quot;bficritics&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Critics' Top Ten Poll | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[British Film Institute]] | year = 2002 | url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/critics.html | accessdate = 2008-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bfidirectors&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Directors' Top Ten Poll|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|year=2002|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/directors.html|accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Negative Criticism====
Despite its status as a revered classic, ''Citizen Kane'' is not entirely without its critics. [[Boston University]] film scholar [[Ray Carney]], although noting its technical achievements, criticized what he saw as the film's lack of emotional depth, shallow characterization and empty metaphors. Listing it among the most overrated works within the film community, he accused the film of being &quot;an all-American triumph of style over substance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.bu.edu/rcarney/carncult/orfilms.shtml |title=Carney on Culture: Over-Rated Films |publisher=People.bu.edu |date=1999-05-14 |accessdate=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sweden|Swedish]] director [[Ingmar Bergman]] once stated his dislike for the movie, calling it &quot;a total bore&quot; and claiming that the &quot;performances are worthless.&quot; He went on to call Orson Welles an &quot;infinitely overrated filmmaker.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ingmarbergman.se/universe.asp?guid=4BD5D87B-5B2A-48F4-9512-8942D89238DC&amp;LanCD=EN&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[James Agate]] wrote, &quot;I thought the photography quite good, but nothing to write to [[Moscow]] about, the acting middling, and the whole thing a little dull...Mr. Welles's high-brow direction is of that super-clever order which prevents you from seeing what that which is being directed is all about.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tookeysfilmguide.com/Film.asp?id=2874 Tookeys Film Guide – Film Reviews since 1902]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prints==
The original camera negative of ''Citizen Kane'' was destroyed in a [[New Jersey]] film laboratory fire in the 1970s. Subsequent prints were ultimately derived from a nitrate fine grain positive made in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Tom McGreevey and Joanne L. Yeck ''Our Movie Heritage'', 1997, Rutgers University Press, p135-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern techniques were used to produce a pristine print for a 50th Anniversary theatrical revival reissue in 1991 (released by [[Paramount Pictures]]). The 2003 British [[DVD]] edition is taken from an [[interpositive]] held by the [[British Film Institute]]. The current US DVD version (released by Warner Home Video) is taken from another digital restoration, supervised by Turner's company.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The transfer to Region 1 DVD has been criticized by some film experts for being too bright. Also, in the scene in Bernstein's office (chapter 10), rain falling outside the window has been digitally erased, probably because it was thought to be excessive film grain. These alterations are not present in the UK Region 2, which is also considered to be more accurate in terms of contrast and brightness.

In 2003, Orson Welles' daughter Beatrice sued [[Turner Entertainment]] and RKO Pictures, claiming that the Welles estate is the legal [[copyright]] holder of the film. Her attorney said that Orson Welles had left RKO with an exit deal terminating his contracts with the studio, meaning that Welles still had an interest in the film and his previous contract giving the studio the [[copyright]] of the film was null and void. Beatrice Welles also claimed that, if the courts did not uphold her claim of copyright, RKO nevertheless owed the estate 20% of the profits, from a previous contract which has not been lived up to.

On May 30, 2007, the appeals panel agreed that Beatrice Welles could proceed with the lawsuit against Turner Entertainment; the opinion partially overturns the 2004 decision by a lower court judge who had found in favor of Turner Entertainment on the issue of video rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abclocal.go.com/kfsn/story?section=entertainment&amp;id=5353309 Heir to sue for 'Citizen Kane' video rights] ABC local, retrieved May 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, this film became the catalyst in the controversy over the [[film colorization|colorization]] of black and white films. When [[Ted Turner]] told members of the press that he was considering colorizing ''Citizen Kane'', his comments led to an immediate public outcry. About two weeks before his death, and almost a year before Turner acquired the rights to the MGM catalog, Welles had asked filmaker [[Henry Jaglom]], &quot;Please do this for me. Don't let Ted Turner deface my movie with his crayons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lebo|first=Harlan|title=Citizen Kane:the fiftieth -anniversary album|publisher=Doubleday|year=1990|page=194|isbn=9780385414739|accessdate=2009-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uproar was for nothing, as Turner could not have colorized the film had he wanted to. Welles' original contract prevented any alteration to the film without his, and eventually his estate's, express consent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957100,00.html American Notes Hollywood - Kane Steals Ted's Crayons]. Time Magazine February 27, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Turner later claimed that this was a joke intended to needle colorization critics, and that he had never had any intention of colorizing the film.

==Legacy==
Despite the critical success of ''Citizen Kane'' it nevertheless marked a decline in Welles' fortune. In the book ''Whatever Happened to Orson Welles?'', Joseph McBride argues that the problems in making ''Citizen Kane'' caused lasting damage to his career. The damage started with RKO violating their contract with him by taking his next film ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' away from him and adding a happy ending against his will.&lt;ref name=empire/&gt; Hollywood's treatment of Welles and his work ultimately led to his self imposed exile in Europe for much of the rest of his career where he found a more sympathetic audience.

The documentary ''[[The Battle Over Citizen Kane]]'' points out the great irony that Welles's own life story resembled that of Kane far more than Hearst's: an overreaching ''[[wunderkind]]'' who ended up mournful and lonely in his old age. ''Citizen Kane'''s editor [[Robert Wise]] summarized: &quot;Well, I thought often afterwards, only in recent years when I saw the film again two or three years ago when they had the fiftieth anniversary, and I suddenly thought to myself, well, Orson was doing an autobiographical film and didn't realize it, because it's rather much the same, you know. You start here, and you have a big rise and tremendous prominence and fame and success and whatnot, and then tail off and tail off and tail off. And at least the arc of the two lives were very much the same...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;/&gt;

[[Peter Bogdanovich]], who was friends with Welles in his later years, disagreed with this on his own commentary on the ''Citizen Kane'' DVD, saying that Kane was nothing like Welles. Kane, he said, &quot;had none of the qualities of an artist, Orson had all the qualities of an artist.&quot; Bogdanovich also noted that Welles was never bitter &quot;about all the bad things that happened to him&quot;, and was a man who enjoyed life in his final years.
In addition, critics have reassessed Welles’ career after his death, saying that he wasn’t a failed [[American cinema|Hollywood filmmaker]], but a successful [[independent film]]maker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Pwb7WR2wVZ0C&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=%2BWelles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z9-YzsHfqL&amp;sig=eNpHDG7-LsRDYWIQW0ksFK83QvE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8yJYSvWxOMuMtgft1MjdCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 |title='&amp;#39;Movie Wars'&amp;#39; by Jonathan Rosenbaum |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic [[Kim Newman]] believed the film's influence was visible in the [[film noir]] that followed, as well as the 1942 Hepburn-Tracy film ''[[Keeper of the Flame (film)|Keeper of the Flame]].'' Film directors [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Bryan Singer]], [[Stephen Frears]], [[Brian De Palma]], [[John Frankenheimer]], [[Tommy Wiseau]], the [[Coen brothers]], [[Sergio Leone]] and [[Luc Besson]] are all fans of ''Citizen Kane'' and it influenced their work.

In 1982 Spielberg spent $60,500 to buy the Rosebud sled,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DF1E30F934A3575AC0A960948260|title=Movie Meoribilia| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2009-01-22 | date=1986-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and paid homage to the film in the final shot of the [[government warehouse (fiction)|government warehouse]] in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''. Spielberg commented, &quot;Rosebud will go over my typewriter to remind me that quality in movies comes first.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Video Viewer'' (August, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sara|last=Medina| date=21 June 1982 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925482,00.html |title=People|publisher=Time.com |date=1982-06-21 |accessdate=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's structure influenced the biographical films ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' and ''[[Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters]]''&amp;nbsp;– which begin with the subject's death and show their life in flashbacks&amp;nbsp;– as well as Welles' thriller ''[[Mr. Arkadin]]''.&lt;ref name=empire/&gt;

[[Image:International Morse Code.svg|right|thumb|290px|Morse code, a famous type of code.]]
A '''code''' is a rule for converting a piece of [[information]] (for example, a [[letter (alphabet)|letter]], [[word]], [[phrase]], or [[gesture]]) into another form or representation (one [[sign]] into another sign), not necessarily of the same type. 

In [[communication]]s and [[information processing]], '''encoding''' is the process by which information from a [[communication source|source]] is converted into symbols to be communicated.  '''Decoding''' is the reverse process, converting these code symbols back into information understandable by a receiver.  

One reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary spoken or written language is difficult or impossible. For example, semaphore, where the configuration of [[Flag semaphore|flags]] held signaller or the arms of a [[semaphore line|semaphore tower]] encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters and numbers. Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.

== Theory ==
{{Merge to |Coding theory |date=July 2010}}
In [[information theory]] and [[computer science]], a code is usually considered as an [[algorithm]] which uniquely represents symbols from some source [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]], by ''encoded'' strings, which may be in some other target alphabet. An extension of the code for representing sequences of symbols over the source alphabet is obtained by concatenating the encoded strings.

Before giving a mathematically precise definition, we give a brief example. The mapping 
:&lt;math&gt;C = \{\, a\mapsto 0, b\mapsto 01, c\mapsto 011\,\}&lt;/math&gt;
is a code, whose source alphabet is the set &lt;math&gt;\{a,b,c\}&lt;/math&gt; and whose target alphabet is the set &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;. Using the extension of the code, the encoded string ''0011001011'' can be grouped into codewords as ''0 – 011 – 0 – 01 – 011'', and these in turn can be decoded to the sequence of source symbols ''acabc''. 

Using terms from [[formal language theory]], the precise mathematical definition of this concept is as follows: Let S and T be two finite sets, called the source and target [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabets]], respectively. A '''code''' &lt;math&gt;C:\, S \to T^*&lt;/math&gt; is a [[total function]] mapping each symbol from S to a [[String (computer science)|sequence of symbols]] over T, and the extension of M to a [[Homomorphism#Homomorphisms_and_e-free_homomorphisms_in_formal_language_theory|homomorphism]] of &lt;math&gt;S^*&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt;, which naturally maps each sequence of source symbols to a sequence of target symbols, is referred to as its '''extension'''.

=== Variable-length codes ===
{{Main|Variable-length code}}
In this section we consider codes, which encode each source (clear text) character by a [[code word]] from some dictionary, and [[concatenation]] of such code words give us an encoded string.
Variable-length codes are especially useful when clear text characters have different probabilities; see also [[entropy encoding]].

A ''prefix code'' is a code with the &quot;prefix property&quot;: there is no valid [[code word]] in the system that is a [[prefix (computer science)|prefix]] (start) of any other valid code word in the set. [[Huffman coding]] is the most known algorithm for deriving prefix codes, so prefix codes are also widely referred to as &quot;Huffman codes&quot;, even when the code was not produced by a Huffman algorithm.
Other examples of prefix codes are [[country calling codes]], the country and publisher parts of [[ISBN]]s, and the Secondary Synchronization Codes used in the [[UMTS]] [[W-CDMA]] 3G Wireless Standard.

[[Kraft's inequality]] characterizes the sets of code word lengths that are possible in a prefix code. Virtually, any uniquely decodable one-to-many code, not necessary a prefix one, must satisfy Kraft's inequality.

=== Block codes ===
{{Main|Block code}}
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}

=== Error correcting codes ===
{{Main|Error detection and correction}}
Codes may also be used to represent data in a way more resistant
to errors in transmission or storage. Such a &quot;code&quot; is
called an [[Error correction and detection|error-correcting code]], and works by including carefully crafted redundancy with the stored (or transmitted) data. Examples include [[Hamming code]]s, [[Reed–Solomon]], [[Reed–Muller]], [[Walsh-Hadamard code|Walsh-Hadamard]], [[BCH code|Bose–Chaudhuri–Hochquenghem]], [[Turbo code|Turbo]], [[Golay code|Golay]], [[Goppa code|Goppa]], [[low-density parity-check code]]s, and [[space–time code]]s.
Error detecting codes can be optimised to detect  ''burst errors'', or ''random errors''.

== Examples ==
=== Codes in communication used for brevity ===
A cable code replaces words (e.g., ''ship'' or ''invoice'') with shorter words, allowing the same information to be sent with fewer [[character (computing)|characters]], more quickly, and most important, less expensively.

Codes can be used for brevity. When telegraph messages were the state of the art in rapid long distance communication, elaborate systems of commercial codes that encoded complete phrases into single words (commonly five-letter groups) were developed, so that [[Telegraphy|telegraphers]] became conversant with such &quot;words&quot; as ''BYOXO'' (&quot;Are you trying to weasel out of our deal?&quot;), ''LIOUY'' (&quot;Why do you not answer my question?&quot;), ''BMULD'' (&quot;You're a skunk!&quot;), or ''AYYLU'' (&quot;Not clearly coded, repeat more clearly.&quot;). [[Code word]]s were chosen for various reasons: [[length]], [[pronounceability]], etc. Meanings were chosen to fit perceived needs: commercial negotiations, military terms for military codes, diplomatic terms for diplomatic codes, any and all of the preceding for espionage codes. Codebooks and codebook publishers proliferated, including one run as a front for the American [[Black Chamber]] run by [[Herbert Yardley]] between the First and Second World Wars. The purpose of most of these codes was to save on cable costs. The use of data coding for [[data compression]] predates the computer era; an early example is the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] [[Morse code]] where more-frequently used characters have shorter representations. Techniques such as [[Huffman coding]] are now used by computer-based [[algorithm]]s to compress large data files into a more compact form for storage or transmission.

=== Character encodings ===
{{Main|Character encoding}}
Probably the most widely known data communications code so far (aka character representation) in use today is [[ASCII]]. In one or another (somewhat compatible) version, it is used by nearly all personal [[computer]]s, [[computer terminal|terminals]], [[computer printer|printers]], and other communication equipment. It represents 128 [[character (computing)|characters]] with seven-bit [[Binary numeral system|binary]] numbers&amp;mdash;that is, as a string of seven 1s and 0s. In ASCIIvcx a lowercase &quot;a&quot; is always 1100001, an uppercase &quot;A&quot; always 1000001, and so on. There are many other encodings, which represent each character by a [[byte]] (usually referred as [[code page]]s), integer [[code point]] ([[Unicode]]) or a byte sequence ([[UTF-8]]).

=== Genetic code ===
{{Main|Genetic code}}
[[Biology|Biological]] organisms contain genetic material that is used to control their function and development. This is [[DNA]] which contains units named [[genes]] that can produce [[proteins]] through a code ([[genetic code]]) in which a series of triplets {[[codon]]s} of four possible [[nucleotides]] are translated into one of twenty possible [[amino acids]].  A sequence of codons results in a corresponding sequence of amino acids that form a protein.

===Gödel code===
In [[mathematics]], a [[Gödel code]] was the basis for the proof of [[Gödel]]'s [[incompleteness theorem]]. Here, the idea was to map [[mathematical notation]] to a [[natural number]] (using a [[Gödel numbering]]).

=== Other ===

There are codes using colors, like [[traffic lights]], the [[Electronic color code|color code]] employed to mark the nominal value of the [[Resistor|electrical resistor]]s or that of the trashcans devoted to specific types of garbage (paper, glass, biological, etc.)

In [[marketing]], [[coupon]] codes can be used for a financial discount or rebate when purchasing a product from an internet retailer. 

In military environments, specific sounds with the [[cornet]] are used for different uses: to mark some moments of the day, to command the infantry in the battlefield, etc.

Communication systems for sensory impairments, as the [[sign language]] for deaf people and [[braille]] for blind people, are based in movement or tactile codes.

[[Musical score]]s are the most common way to encode [[music]].

Specific games, as [[chess]], have their own code systems to record the matches ([[chess notation]]).

=== Cryptography ===
In the [[history of cryptography]], codes were once common for ensuring the confidentiality of communications, although [[cipher]]s are now used instead. See [[code (cryptography)]].

[[Secret code]]s intended to obscure the real messages, ranging from serious (mainly espionage in military, diplomatic, business, etc.) to trivial (romance, games) can be any kind of imaginative encoding: flowers, game cards, clothes, fans, hats, melodies, birds, etc., in which the sole requisite is the previous agreement of the meaning by both the sender and the receiver.

== Other examples ==

Other examples of encoding include:
*Encoding (in [[cognition]]) is a basic perceptual process of interpreting incoming stimuli; technically speaking, it is a complex, multi-stage process of converting relatively objective sensory input (e.g., light, sound) into subjectively meaningful experience.
*A [[content format]] is a specific encoding format for converting a specific type of [[data]] to [[information]].
*Text encoding uses a [[markup language]] to tag the structure and other features of a text to facilitate processing by computers. (See also [[Text Encoding Initiative]].)
*[[Semantics encoding]] of formal language A in formal language B is a method of representing all terms (e.g. programs or descriptions) of language A using language B.
*[[Encoder|Electronic encoding]] transforms a signal into a code optimized for [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] or [[data storage device|storage]], generally done with a [[codec]].
*[[Neural encoding]] is the way in which information is represented in [[neurons]].
*[[Encoding (memory)|Memory encoding]] is the process of converting sensations into memories.
*[[Television encoding]]: [[NTSC]], [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]]

Other examples of decoding include:

* [[Digital-to-analog converter]], the use of analog circuit for decoding operations
* [[Parsing|Decoding (Computer Science)]]
* [[Decoding methods]], methods in communication theory for decoding codewords sent over a noisy channel
* [[Digital signal processing]], the study of signals in a digital representation and the processing methods of these signals
* Word [[Phonics|decoding]], the use of [[phonics]] to decipher print patterns and translate them into the sounds of language

==Codes and acronyms==
[[Acronym]]s and abbreviations can be considered codes, and in a sense all [[language]]s and writing systems are codes for human thought. 

[[International Air Transport Association airport code]]s are three-letter codes used to designate airports and used for [[bag tag]]s.

Occasionally a code word achieves an independent existence (and meaning) while the original equivalent phrase is forgotten or at least no longer has the precise meaning attributed to the code word. For example, '30' was widely used in [[journalism]] to mean &quot;end of story&quot;, and it is sometimes used in other contexts to signify &quot;the end&quot;.

'''Cheirogaleidae''' is the family of [[strepsirrhine]] [[primate]]s that contains the various dwarf and mouse lemurs. Like all other [[lemur]]s, '''cheirogaleids''' live exclusively on the island of [[Madagascar]].

==Characteristics==
Cheirogaleids are smaller than the other lemurs and, in fact, they are the smallest primates. They have a soft, long fur colored grey-brown to reddish on top with a generally brighter underbelly. Typically they have small ears, large, close set eyes, and long hind legs. Like all strepsirrhines they have fine claws at the second toe of the hind legs. They grow to a size of only 13 to 28&amp;nbsp;cm, with a tail that is very long, sometimes up to one and a half times as long as the body. They weigh no more than 500&amp;nbsp;grams, with some species weighing as little as 60&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref name=EoM&gt;{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= Martin, Robert D.|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 126–127|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dwarf and mouse lemurs are [[nocturnal]] and [[arboreal]]. They are excellent climbers and can also jump far, using their long tail for balance. When on the ground (a rare occurrence) they move by hopping on their hind legs. They spend the day in tree hollows or leaf nests. Cheirogaleids are typically solitary but sometimes live together in pairs. 

Their eyes possess a [[tapetum lucidum]], a light-reflecting layer that improves their night vision. Some species, such as the [[Lesser Dwarf Lemur]], store fat at the hind legs and the base of the tail and hibernate. Unlike [[Lemuridae|lemurid]]s, they have long upper [[incisor]]s, although they do have the comb-like teeth typical of all strepsirhines. They have the [[dentition|dental formula]]: {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.3.3|lower=2.1.3.3}}

Cheirogaleids are [[omnivore]]s, eating fruits, flowers and leaves (and sometimes  nectar) as well as insects, spiders and small vertebrates.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt;

The females usually have three pairs of nipples. After a meager 60 day gestation, they will bear two to four (usually two or three) young. After five to six weeks these are weaned and become fully mature near the end of their first year or sometime in their second year, depending on the species. In human care, they can live for up to 15 years, although their life expectancy in the wild is probably significantly shorter.

}}

The '''Callitrichidae''' (synonym Hapalidae) is one of five [[family (biology)|families]] of [[New World monkeys]]. The family includes several [[genus|genera]], including the [[marmoset]]s, [[tamarin]]s, and [[lion tamarin]]s. For a few years, this group of animals was regarded as a subfamily, called the Callitrichinae, of the Family [[Cebidae]].

This taxon was traditionally thought to be a primitive stem lineage, from which all the larger bodied platyrrhines evolved (see Hershkovitz, 1977). However, Dr Susan Ford has argued quite convincingly that callitrichids are actually a dwarfed lineage. The ancestral callitrichid would likely have been a &quot;normal&quot; sized cebid that was dwarfed through evolutionary time. This may exemplify a rare example of insular dwarfing in a mainland context, with the &quot;islands&quot; being formed by the extensive river networks in the [[Amazon Basin]], which form effective biogeographic barriers.

All callitrichids are [[arboreal]]. They are the smallest of the anthropoid (i.e. [[simian]]) [[primate]]s.  They eat insects, fruit, and the sap or gum from trees; occasionally they will take small vertebrates. The marmosets rely quite heavily on [[exudate]]s, with several species (''Callithrix jacchus'' and ''Cebuella pygmaea'') considered obligate exudativores. 

Callitrichids typically live in small, [[territory (animal)|territorial]] groups of about 5 or 6 animals.  Their [[Social organisation|social organization]] is unique among primates and is called &quot;Cooperative polyandrous group&quot;.  This communal breeding system involves groups of multiple males and females, but only one female is reproductively active.  Females mate with more than one male and everyone shares the responsibility of carrying the offspring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sussman1&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Sussman | first = R.W. | title = Primate Ecology and Social Structure | chapter = Chapter 1: Ecology: General Principles | page = 29 | publisher = Pearson Custom Publishing | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0536743633}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Original text on social structure, not originally references inline.  Material needs to be reconciled with what is directly above. -&gt;&gt;
&lt;!--
Studies in captivity, and the first field studies, suggested that the breeding group was invariably a single monogamous pair; subsequent field work on [[Brown-mantled Tamarin]]s (''Saguinus fuscicollis''), has shown that many of the groups involve multiple males, and [[polyandry]] seems to be the commonest arrangement, though monogamous pairs do occur, and so, though rarely, does [[polygyny]]. In polyandrous groups, both (or all) the mature males regularly copulate with the female, and all contribute equally to parental care. It is now thought that this flexible system, with a tendency towards polyandry, may be the typical mating system among callitrichids, though until field studies on more species have been completed any generalisation must be tentative.&lt;ref name=&quot;1988Goldizen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0169-5347(88)90045-6 | last1 = Goldizen | first1 = A.W. | title = Tamarin and marmoset mating systems: Unusual flexibility | journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution | year = 1988 | volume = 3 | pages = 36–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

They are the only primate group that regularly produce twins, which constitute over 80% of births in species that have been studied. Unlike other male primates, male callitrichids generally provide as much parental care as females, more in some cases.  Typical social structure seems to constitute a breeding group, with several of their previous offspring living in the group and providing significant help in rearing the young.

The '''Cebidae''' is one of the five [[family (biology)|families]] of [[New World monkeys]] now recognised. It includes the [[capuchin monkey]]s and [[squirrel monkey]]s.&lt;ref name=SAP/&gt; These species are found throughout tropical and subtropical [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]].

==Characteristics==
Cebid monkeys are [[arboreal]] animals that only rarely travel on the ground. They are generally small monkeys, ranging in size &lt;!--from the [[Pygmy Marmoset]], with a head-body length of 17 to 19 cm, and a weight of 120 to 190 grams,--&gt; up to that of the [[Brown Capuchin]], with a body length of 33 to 56&amp;nbsp;cm, and a weight of 2.5 to 3.9 kilograms. They are somewhat variable in form and coloration, but all have the wide, flat, noses typical of New World Monkeys.

They are [[omnivore|omnivorous]], mostly eating fruit and insects, although the proportions of these foods vary greatly between species. They have the [[dentition|dental formula]]:{{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.3.2-3|lower=2.1.3.2-3}}

Females give birth to one or two young after a [[gestation]] period of between 130 and 170 days, depending on species. They are social animals, living in groups of between five and forty individuals, with the smaller species typically forming larger groups. They are generally [[Diurnality|diurnal]] in habit.&lt;ref name=EoM&gt;{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= Janson, C.H. &amp; Rylands, A.B.|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 342–361|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Previously, New World monkeys were divided between [[Callitrichidae]] and this family. For a few recent years, [[marmoset]]s, [[tamarin]]s, and [[lion tamarin]]s were placed as a subfamily (Callitrichinae) in Cebidae, while moving other genera from Cebidae into the families [[Aotidae]], [[Pitheciidae]] and [[Atelidae]].&lt;ref name=msw3/&gt; The most recent classification of New World monkeys again splits the callitrichids off, leaving only the capuchins and squirrel monkeys in this family.&lt;ref name=SAP/&gt;

'''Chondrichthyes''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|k|ɒ|n|ˈ|d|r|ɪ|k|θ|i|.|iː|z}}; from Greek χονδρ- ''chondr-'' 'cartilage', ἰχθύς ''ichthys'' 'fish') or '''cartilaginous fishes''' are jawed [[fish]] with paired fins, paired nares, scales, two-chambered hearts, and skeletons made of [[cartilage]] rather than [[bone]]. The class is divided into two subclasses: [[Elasmobranchii]] ([[shark]]s, [[Batoidea|ray]]s and [[skate]]s) and [[Holocephali]] ([[chimaera]]s, sometimes called ghost sharks, which are sometimes separated into their own class).

Within the infraphylum [[Gnathostomata]], cartilaginous fishes are distinct from all other jawed vertebrates, the extant members of which all fall into [[Teleostomi]].

==Anatomy==
===Skeleton===
The skeleton is cartilaginous. The [[notochord]], which is present in the young, is gradually replaced by cartilage. Chondrichthyes also lack ribs, so if they leave water, the larger species' own body weight would crush their internal organs long before they suffocate.

As they do not have [[bone marrow]], [[red blood cell]]s are produced in the [[spleen]] and the epigonal organ (special tissue around the [[gonad]]s, which is also thought to play a role in the immune system). They are also produced in the [[Leydig's organ]] which is only found in cartilaginous fishes, although some do not possess it. The subclass [[Holocephali]], which is a very specialized group, lacks both the Leydig's and epigonal organ.

===Appendages===
Their tough skin is covered with dermal teeth (again with Holocephali as an exception as the teeth are lost in adults, only kept on the clasping organ seen on the front of the male's head), also called placoid scales or [[dermal denticle]]s, making it feel like sandpaper. In most species, all dermal denticles are oriented in one direction, making the skin feel very smooth if rubbed in one direction and very rough if rubbed in the other. Another exception are the [[electric rays]], which have a thick and flabby body, with soft, loose skin devoid of dermal denticles and thorns. 

Originally the pectoral and pelvic girdles, which do not contain any dermal elements, did not connect. In later forms, each pair of fins became ventrally connected in the middle when scapulocoracoid and pubioischiadic bars evolved. In [[Batoidea|rays]], the pectoral fins have connected to the head and are very flexible.

One of the primary characteristics present in most sharks is the heterocercal tail, which aids in locomotion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/205/16/2365.pdf Function of the heterocercal tail in sharks: quantitative wake dynamics during steady horizontal swimming and vertical maneuvering] - The Journal of Experimental Biology 205, 2365–2374 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body covering===

Chondrichthyes have toothlike scales called [[Dermal denticle|denticles]] or placoid scales. Denticles provide two functions, protection, and in most cases streamlining. Mucous glands exist in some species as well.

It is assumed that their oral teeth evolved from dermal denticles which migrated into the mouth, but it could be the other way around as the [[Teleostei|teleost]] bony fish ''[[Denticeps clupeoides]]'' has most of its head covered by dermal teeth (as does, probably, ''[[Atherion elymus]]'', another bony fish). This is most likely a secondary evolved characteristic which means there is not necessarily a connection between the teeth and the original dermal scales.

The old [[placoderms]] did not have teeth at all, but had sharp bony plates in their mouth. Thus, it is unknown which of the dermal or oral teeth evolved first. Neither is it sure how many times it has happened if it turns out to be the case. It has even been suggested that the original bony plates of all the vertebrates are gone and that the present scales are just modified teeth, even if both teeth and the body armor have a common origin a long time ago. But for the moment there is no evidence of this.

===Respiratory system===
Chondrichthyes all breathe through 5-7 [[gills]], depending on the species. In general, pelagic species must keep swimming to keep oxygenated water moving through their gills whilst demersal species can actively pump water in through their spiracles and out through their gills. However, this is only a general rule and many species differ.

A [[spiracle]] is a small hole found behind each eye. These can be tiny and circular, such as found on the Nurse Shark (''Ginglymostoma cirratum''), to extended and slit-like, such as found on the Wobbegongs (Orectolobidae). Many larger, pelagic species such as the Mackerel Sharks (Lamnidae) and the Thresher Sharks (Alopiidae) no longer possess them.

==Biology==

Fertilization is internal. Development is usually live birth ([[ovoviviparous]] species) but can be through eggs ([[oviparous]]). Some rare species are [[viviparous]]. There is no parental care after birth; however, some Chondrichthyes do guard their eggs.

==Taxonomy==
The extant members of the Chondrichthyes are the [[shark]]s and [[Batoidea|rays]], belonging to the subclass [[Elasmobranchii]], and the [[chimaera]]s, belonging to the subclass [[Holocephali]]. Nelson's 2006 ''Fishes of the World'' arranges the class as follows:

'''Carl Linnaeus''' (23 May&lt;ref group=a name=birthdate /&gt; 1707 – 10 January 1778), also known after his [[Swedish nobility|ennoblement]] as {{Audio|sv-Carl_von_Linné.ogg|'''Carl von Linné'''}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt171&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Swedish [[botanist]], [[physician]], and [[zoologist]], who laid the foundations for the modern scheme of [[binomial nomenclature]]. He is known as the father of modern [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]], and is also considered one of the fathers of modern [[ecology]].

Linnaeus was born in the countryside of [[Småland]], in southern Sweden. Linnaeus got most of his higher education at [[Uppsala University]], and began giving lectures in [[botany]] there in 1730. He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, where he studied and also published a first edition of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' in the Netherlands. He then returned to Sweden, where he became professor of botany at [[Uppsala]]. In the 1740s, he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals. In the 1750s and 60s, he continued to collect and classify animals, plants, and minerals, and published several volumes. At the time of his death, he was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe.

The Swiss philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] sent him the message: &quot;Tell him I know no greater man on earth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;[http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/8_3.html &quot;What people have said about Linnaeus&quot;], Uppsala University website &quot;''Linné on line&quot;'' English language version.&lt;/ref&gt; The German writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] wrote: &quot;With the exception of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt; Swedish author [[August Strindberg]] wrote: &quot;Linnaeus was in reality a poet who happened to become a naturalist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/9_0.html Linnaeus deceased] Uppsala University website &quot;''Linné on line&quot;'' English language version.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other compliments, Linnaeus has been called ''Princeps botanicorum'' (Prince of Botanists), &quot;The [[Natural History (Pliny)|Pliny]] of the North,&quot; and &quot;The Second [[Adam#Creation|Adam]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broberg7&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Broberg|Broberg, Gunnar]]|year=2006|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In botany, the [[Author citation (botany)|author abbreviation]] used to indicate Linnaeus as the authority for species' names is '''L.'''&lt;ref&gt;[[International Plant Names Index]] Author Details for [http://www.ipni.org/ipni/idAuthorSearch.do?id=12653-1 Linnaeus, Carl (1707-1778)]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1959, Carl Linnaeus was designated as the [[lectotype]] for ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'',&lt;ref&gt; Stearn, W. T. 1959. &quot;The background of Linnaeus's contributions to the nomenclature and methods of systematic biology&quot;, ''Systematic Zoology'' 8 (1): 4-22, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; which means that following the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|nomenclatural rules]], ''Homo sapiens'' was validly defined as the animal species to which Linnaeus belonged.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
====Childhood====
[[Image:LA2-Rashult-2.jpg|thumb|right|Birth place of Linnaeus at Råshult.]]

Carl Linnaeus was born in [[Råshult]], [[Småland]], Sweden on the 23 May 1707. He was the first child of Nils Ingemarsson Linnaeus and Christina Brodersonia. His father was the first in his ancestry to adopt a permanent [[surname]].  Before that, ancestors had used the [[patronymic]] naming system of Scandinavian countries: his father was named Ingemarsson after his father Ingemar Bengtsson. When Nils was admitted to the [[University of Lund]], he had to take on a family name. He adopted the Latinate name Linnæus after a giant [[linden tree]] (or lime tree), ''lind'' in Swedish, that grew on the family homestead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt12&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name was spelled with the [[æ]] [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]. When Carl was born, he was named Carl Linnæus, with his father's family name.  The son also always spelled it with the æ ligature, both in handwritten documents and in publications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt13&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl's patronymic would have been Nilsson, as in Carl Nilsson Linnæus. 

Nils was from a long line of peasants and priests. Nils was an amateur [[botanist]], a [[Lutheran]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]], and the [[curate]] of the small village of Stenbrohult in Småland. Christina was the daughter of the [[rector general|rector]] of Stenbrohult, Samuel Brodersonius. She subsequently gave birth to three daughters and another son, Samuel (who would eventually succeed their father as rector of Stenbrohult and write a manual on [[beekeeping]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt12&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver8&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Broberg10&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Broberg|Broberg, Gunnar]]|year=2006|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year after Linnaeus' birth, his grandfather Samuel Brodersonius died, and his father Nils became the rector of Stenbrohult. The family moved into the [[rectory]] from the curate's house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt13&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalgeographic2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Name Giver|journal=National Geographic|date=2007-06|first=David|last=Quammen|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|page=1|id= |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/06/linnaeus-name-giver/david-quammen-text/1|format=|accessdate=2010-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in his early years, Linnaeus seemed to have a liking for plants, flowers in particular. Whenever he was upset, he was given a flower, which immediately calmed him. Nils spent much time in his garden and often showed flowers to Linnaeus and told him their names. Soon Linnaeus was given his own patch of earth where he could grow plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt15&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early education====
His father began teaching Linnaeus Latin, religion, and geography at an early age; one account says that due to family use of Latin for conversation, the boy learned Latin before he learned Swedish. When Linnaeus was seven, Nils decided to hire a tutor for him. The parents picked Johan Telander, a son of a local [[yeoman]].  Linnaeus did not like him, writing in his autobiography that Telander &quot;was better calculated to extinguish a child's talents than develop them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt15-16&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years after his tutoring had begun, in 1717, he was sent to the Lower [[Grammar School]] at [[Växjö]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver5&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus rarely studied, often going to the countryside to look for plants. He reached the last year of the Lower School when he was fifteen, which was taught by the headmaster, Daniel Lannerus, who was interested in botany. Lannerus noticed Linnaeus' interest in botany and gave him the run of his garden. He also introduced him to Johan Rothman, the state doctor of Småland and a teacher at Växjö [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]. Rothman, a doctor and also a botanist, widened Linnaeus' interest in botany and helped him develop an interest in [[medicine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt16&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver5-6&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnaeus entered the Växjö Gymnasium in 1724. At the gymnasium, he studied mainly [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew]], [[theology]] and [[mathematics]], a curriculum designed for boys preparing for the priesthood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver6&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt16-17&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last year at the gymnasium, Linnaeus' father visited to ask the professors how his son's studies were progressing; to his dismay, most said that Linnaeus would never become a scholar. Rothman believed otherwise, suggesting Linnaeus could have a future in medicine. The doctor offered to have Linnaeus live with his family in Växjö and to teach him [[physiology]] and botany. Nils accepted this offer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt17-18&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver8-11&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University===
==== Lund ====

[[File:Linné-Praeludia Sponsaliorum Plantarum.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pollination]] depicted in ''Praeludia Sponsaliorum Plantarum'' (1729)]]

Rothman showed Linnaeus that botany was a serious subject. He taught Linnaeus to classify plants according to [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort|Tournefort's]] system. Linnaeus was also taught about sexuality of plants, according to [[Sébastien Vaillant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt17-18&quot;/&gt; In 1727, Linnaeus, age 21, enrolled in [[Lund University]] in [[Skåne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt18&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver13&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was registered as ''Carolus Linnæus,'' the Latin form of his full name, which he also used later for his Latin publications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt171&quot;/&gt; 

The local doctor Kilian Stobaeus offered Linnaeus tutoring and lodging, as well as the use of his library, which included many books about botany. He also gave the student free admission to his lectures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt21-22&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver15&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his free time, Linnaeus explored the flora of Skåne, together with students' sharing the same interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver14-15&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Uppsala====
In August 1728, Linnaeus decided to attend [[Uppsala University]] on the advice of Rothman, who believed it would be a better choice if Linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany. Rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught at medical faculty at Uppsala: [[Olof Rudbeck the Younger]] and [[Lars Roberg]]. Although Rudbeck and Roberg had undoubtedly been good professors, by then they were older and not so interested in teaching. Rudbeck no longer gave public lectures, and had others stand in for him. The botany, zoology, pharmacology and anatomy lectures were not in their best state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt23-25&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Uppsala, Linnaeus met a new benefactor, [[Olof Celsius]], who was a professor of theology and an amateur botanist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt31-32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received Linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library, which was one of the richest botanical libraries in Sweden.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver19-20&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1729, Linnaeus wrote a thesis, ''Praeludia Sponsaliorum Plantarum'' on [[plant sexuality]]. This attracted the attention of Rudbeck; in May 1730, he selected Linnaeus to begin giving lectures at the University although the young man was only a second-year student. His lecture were popular, and Linnaeus often addressed an audience of 300 persons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt32-34&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Linnaeus moved from Celsius' house into Rudbeck's to become the tutor of the three youngest of his 24 children. His friendship with Celsius did not wane; they continued their botanical expeditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt34-37&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that winter, Linnaeus began doubting Tournefort's system of classification and decided to create one of his own. His plan was to divide the plants by the number of [[stamens]] and [[pistils]]. He began writing several books, which would later result in, for example, ''[[Genera Plantarum]]'' and ''Critica Botanica''. He also produced a book concerning the plants grown in the [[Linnaean Garden|Uppsala Botanical Garden]], ''Adonis Uplandicus''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt2001-36-37&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt2001|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2001|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudbeck's former assistant, [[Nils Rosén von Rosenstein|Nils Rosén]], returned to the University in March 1731 with a degree in medicine. Rosén started giving anatomy lectures and tried to take over Linnaeus' botany lectures in botany, but Rudbeck prevented that. Until December, Rosén gave Linnaeus private tutoring in medicine. In December, Linnaeus had a &quot;disagreement&quot; with Rudbeck's wife and had to move out of his mentor's house; his relationship with Rudbeck did not appear to suffer. That Christmas, Linnaeus returned home to Stenbrohult to visit his parents for the first time in about three years. His mother had disapproved of his failing to become a priest, but she was pleased to learn he was teaching at the University.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt2001-36-37&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson40&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Anderson|Anderson, Margaret J.]]|year=1997|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expedition to Lapland===
[[Image:Carolus Linnaeus by Hendrik Hollander 1853.jpg|thumb|right|Linnaeus in the traditional dress of the Sami people of Lapland]]

During a visit with his parents, Linnaeus told them about his plan to travel to [[Lapland (Sweden)|Lapland]]; Rudbeck had made the journey in 1695, but the detailed results of his exploration were lost in a fire seven years afterwards. Linnaeus' hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious of the customs of the native [[Sami people]], reindeer-herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia's vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded a grant from the [[Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala]] for his journey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson42-43&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Anderson|Anderson, Margaret J.]]|year=1997|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt2001-38&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt2001|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2001|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnaeus began his expedition on 22 May; he travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and [[ornithological]] manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. It took him 11 days to reach his first destination, [[Umeå]], sometimes dismounting on the way to examine a flower or rock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson43-44&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Anderson|Anderson, Margaret J.]]|year=1997|pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly interested in [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s, the latter a main part of the diet of the [[reindeer]], a common animal in Lapland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson46&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Anderson|Anderson, Margaret J.]]|year=1997|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, he reached [[Gävle]], where he found great quantities of ''Campanula serpyllifolia'' (later known as ''[[Linnaea borealis]]''), the twinflower that would become his favourite.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt2001-42-43&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt2001|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2001|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gävle, Linnaeus began journeying to [[Lycksele]], a town further away from the coast than he had traveled until then, examining [[Anatidae|waterbirds]] on the way. After five days, he reached the town and stayed with the pastor and his wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt2001-42-43&quot;/&gt; In the beginning of June he returned to Umeå after having spent some days in Lycksele, and learning more of the customs of the Sami.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt2001-45-47&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt2001|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2001|pages=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''See, e.g.,'' [[Tablut]])

From Umeå he travelled further north into the [[Scandinavian Mountains]], passing Old Luleå, where he received a Sami woman's cap on the way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson50-51&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Anderson|Anderson, Margaret J.]]|year=1997|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, he crossed the border to Norway into [[Sørfold]], about {{convert|300|km|mi}} from Old Luleå.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt2001-55-56&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt2001|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2001|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he traveled to [[Kalix]] where he received instructions in [[Metallurgical assay|assaying]]. In the middle of September, he began his journey back to Uppsala, travelling through Finland, taking the boat from [[Åbo]]. He returned from his six-month long, over {{convert|2000|km|mi}} expedition on 10 October, having gathered and observed many plants, birds and rocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt2001-63-65&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt2001|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2001|pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt39-42&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=39–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Broberg29&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Broberg|Broberg, Gunnar]]|year=2006|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lapland was a region with limited [[biodiversity]], Linnaeus described about 100 previously unidentified plants. These became the basis of his book ''Flora Lapponica''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalgeographic1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Name Giver|journal=National Geographic|date=2007-06|first=David|last=Quammen|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|page=2|id= |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/06/linnaeus-name-giver/david-quammen-text/2|format=|accessdate=2010-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver38-39&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1734, Linnaeus led a small group of students to [[Dalarna]].  Funded by the Governor of Dalarna, the expedition was to catalogue known natural resources and discover new ones, but also to gather intelligence on Norwegian mining activities at [[Røros]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Broberg29&quot;/&gt;

===European excursions===

====Doctorate====
Back in Uppsala, Linnaeus' relations with Nils Rosén worsened, and thus he gladly accepted an invitation from the student Claes Sohlberg to spend the Christmas holiday in [[Falun]] with Sohlberg's family. Sohlberg's father was a mining inspector, and let Linnaeus visit the mines near Falun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt2001-74&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt2001|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2001|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sohland's father suggested to Linnaeus he should bring Sohlberg to [[Holland]] and continue to tutor him there for an annual pay. At that time, Holland was one of the most revered places to study natural history and a common place for Swedes to take their doctoral degree; Linnaeus, who was interested in both of these, accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt2001-78-79&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt2001|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2001|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1735, Linnaeus and Sohlberg set out for the [[Netherlands]], with Linnaeus to take a doctoral degree in medicine at the [[University of Harderwijk]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver71&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the way, they stopped in [[Hamburg]], where they met the mayor, who proudly showed them a wonder of nature which he possessed: the [[taxidermy|taxidermied]] remains of a seven-headed [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]]. Linnaeus quickly discovered it was a fake: jaws and clawed feet from weasels and skins from snakes had been glued together. The provenance of the hydra suggested to Linnaeus it had been manufactured by monks to represent the [[The Beast (Bible)|Beast of Revelation]]. As much as this may have upset the mayor, Linnaeus made his observations public and the mayor's dreams of selling the hydra for an enormous sum were ruined. Fearing his wrath, Linnaeus and Sohlberg had to leave Hamburg quickly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson60-61&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Anderson|Anderson, Margaret J.]]|year=1997|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt90&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Linnaeus reached [[Harderwijk]], he started taking his degree immediately. First he handed in a thesis on the cause of malaria he had written in Sweden. He then defended his thesis in a public debate. The next step was to take an oral examination and to diagnose a patient. After less than two weeks, he took his degree and became a doctor, at the age of 28.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson60-61&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt94&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt2001|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2001|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer, Linnaeus met a friend from Uppsala, [[Peter Artedi]]. Prior to their departure from Uppsala, Artedi and Linnaeus had decided should one of them die, the survivor would finish the other's work. Ten weeks later, Artedi drowned in one of the [[canals of Amsterdam]], and his unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish was left to Linnaeus to complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson66&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Anderson|Anderson, Margaret J.]]|year=1997|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt98-100&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=98–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Publishing of ''Systema Naturae''====
One of the first scientists Linnaeus met in the Netherlands was [[Jan Frederik Gronovius|Johan Frederik Gronovius]] to whom Linnaeus showed one of his several manuscripts he had brought with him from Sweden. The manuscript described a new system for classifying plants. When Gronovius saw it, he was very impressed, and offered to help pay for the printing. With an additional monetary contribution by the Scottish doctor Isaac Lawson, the manuscript was published as ''[[Systema Naturae]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt98&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt2001|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2001|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson62-63&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Anderson|Anderson, Margaret J.]]|year=1997|pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnaeus became acquainted with one of the most respected physicians and botanists in the Netherlands, [[Herman Boerhaave]], who tried to convince Linnaeus to make a career there. Boerhaave offered him a journey to South Africa and America, but Linnaeus declined, stating he would not stand the heat. Instead, Boerhaave suggested Linnaeus visit the botanist [[Johannes Burman]], which Linnaeus did. After his visit, Burman, impressed with his guest's knowledge, decided Linnaeus should stay with him during the winter. During his stay, Linnaeus helped Burman with his ''Thesaurus Zeylanicus''. Burman also helped Linnaeus with the books on which he was working: ''Fundamenta Botanica'' and ''Bibliotheca Botanica''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt100-102&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=100–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====George Clifford====

In August, during Linnaeus' stay with Burman, he met [[George Clifford III]], a director of the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the owner of a rich botanical garden at the estate of [[Hartecamp]] in [[Heemstede]]. Clifford was very impressed with Linnaeus' ability to classify plants, and invited him to become his physician and superintendent of his garden. Linnaeus had already agreed to stay with Burman over the winter, and could thus not accept immediately. However, Clifford offered to compensate Burman by offering him a copy of [[Hans Sloane|Sir Hans Sloane's]] ''Natural History of Jamaica'', a rare book, if he let Linnaeus stay with him, and Burman accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson64&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Anderson|Anderson, Margaret J.]]|year=1997|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver81-82&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September 1735, Linnaeus became the botanical curator and house physician at Hartecamp, free to buy any book or plant he wanted.

In July 1736, Linnaeus travelled to [[England]], at Clifford's expense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt106-107&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt2001|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2001|pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to London to visit [[Hans Sloane|Sir Hans Sloane]], a collector of natural history, and see his [[cabinet of curiosities|cabinet]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver89&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to visit the [[Chelsea Physic Garden]] and its keeper, [[Philip Miller]]. He taught Miller about his new system of subdividing plants, as described in ''Systema Naturae''. Miller was impressed, and from then on started to arrange the garden according to Linnaeus' system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver89-90&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus also traveled to [[Oxford University]] to visit the botanist [[Johann Jacob Dillenius]]. He failed, however, to make Dillenius publicly accept his new classification system. He then returned to Hartecamp, bringing with him many specimens of rare plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver90-93&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|pages=90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, he published ''[[Genera Plantarum]]'', in which he described 935 [[genera]] of plants, and shortly thereafter he supplemented it with ''Corollarium Generum Plantarum'', with another sixty (''sexaginta'') genera.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver95&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work at Hartecamp led to another book, ''[[Hortus Cliffortianus]]'', a catalogue of the botanical holdings in the herbarium and botanical garden of Hartecamp. He wrote it in nine months (completed in July 1737), but it was not published until 1738.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt100-102&quot;/&gt;  It contains the first use of the name [[Nepenthes]], which Linnaeus used to describe a genus of [[pitcher plants]].&lt;ref&gt;Veitch, H.J. 1897. ''Nepenthes''. ''Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society'' '''21'''(2): 226–262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=a name=nepenthes&gt;&quot;If this is not Helen's ''[[Nepenthe]]s'', it certainly will be for all botanists. What botanist would not be filled with admiration if, after a long journey, he should find this wonderful plant. In his astonishment past ills would be forgotten when beholding this admirable work of the Creator!&quot; (translated from Latin by [[Harry Veitch]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnaeus stayed with Clifford at Hartecamp until 18 October 1737 (new style), when he left the house to return to Sweden. Illness and the kindness of Dutch friends obliged him to stay some months longer in Holland. In May 1738, he set out for Sweden again. On the way home, he stayed in [[Paris]] for about a month, visiting botanists such as [[Antoine de Jussieu]]. After his return, Linnaeus never left Sweden again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt123&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt2001|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2001|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Koerner56&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Koerner|Koerner, Lisbet]]|year=1999|page=56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Sweden===
[[Image:LinnaeusWeddingPortrait.jpg|thumb|right|Wedding portrait of Linnaeus]]

[[Image:CarlvonLinne house.jpg|thumb|right|The Linnaeus house in Uppsala]]

When Linnaeus returned to Sweden on 28 June 1738, he went to [[Falun]], where he entered into an engagement to Sara Elisabeth Moræa. Three months later, he moved to Stockholm to find employment as a physician, and thus to make it possible to support a family.&lt;ref name=nrm.se&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrm.se/researchandcollections/botany/phanerogamicbotany/botanicalhistory/carlvonlinne.4.5fdc727f10d795b1c6e80007524.html |title=Carl Linnaeus |accessdate=2010-04-03 |last=Petrusson |first=Louise |publisher=[[Swedish Museum of Natural History]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver141&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, Linnaeus found a patron; he became acquainted with [[Carl Gustav Tessin|Count Carl Gustav Tessin]], who helped him get work as a physician at the Admiralty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver146-147&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|pages=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Koerner16&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Koerner|Koerner, Lisbet]]|year=1999|page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time in Stockholm, Linnaeus helped found the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Science]]; he became the first [[Praeses]] in the academy by drawing of lots.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koerner103-105&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Koerner|Koerner, Lisbet]]|year=1999|pages=103–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because his finances had improved and were now sufficient to support a family, he received permission to marry his fiancée, Sara Elisabeth Moræa. Their wedding was held 26 June 1739. Seven months later, Sara gave birth to their first son, [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger|Carl]]. Two years later, a daughter, Elisabeth Christina, was born, and the subsequent year Sara gave birth to Sara Magdalena, who died 15 days old. Sara and Linnaeus would later have four other children: Lovisa, Sara Christina, Johannes and Sophia.&lt;ref name=nrm.se/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver382&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1741, Linnaeus was appointed Professor of Medicine at Uppsala University, first with the responsibility of the medicine-related matters. Soon, he changed place with the other Professor of Medicine, Nils Rosén, and thus was responsible for the Botanical Garden (which he would thoroughly reconstruct and expand), botany and [[natural history]], instead. In October that same year, his wife and nine-year-old son followed him to live in Uppsala.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gribbin49-50&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Gribbin|Mary, Gribbin]]|year=2008|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further exploration of Sweden===
==== Öland and Gotland ====

Ten days after he was appointed Professor, he undertook an expedition to the island provinces of [[Öland]] and [[Gotland]] with six students from the university, to look for plants useful in medicine. First, they travelled to Öland and stayed there until 21 June, when they sailed to [[Visby]] in Gotland. Linnaeus and the students stayed on Gotland for about a month, and then returned to Uppsala. During this expedition, they found 100 previously unrecorded plants. The observations from the expedition were later published in ''Öländska och Gothländska Resa'', written in Swedish. Like ''Flora Lapponica'', it contained both zoological and botanical observations, as well as observations concerning the culture in Öland and Gotland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koerner115&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Koerner|Koerner, Lisbet]]|year=1999|page=115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt137-142&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=137–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1745, Linnaeus published two more books: ''Flora Suecica'' and ''Fauna Suecica''. ''Flora Suecica'' was a strictly botanical book, while ''Fauna Suecica'' was [[zoological]].&lt;ref name=nrm.se/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver117-118&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anders Celsius]] had created the temperature scale [[Celsius|named after him]] in 1742. Celsius' scale was inverted compared to today, the boiling point at 0°C and freezing point at 100°C. In 1745, Linnaeus inverted the scale to its present standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koerner204&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Koerner|Koerner, Lisbet]]|year=1999|page=204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Västergötland====
In the summer of 1746, Linnaeus was once again commissioned by the Government to carry out an expedition, this time to the Swedish province of [[Västergötland]]. He set out from Uppsala on 12 June and returned 11 August. On the expedition his primarily companion was Erik Gustaf Lidbeck, a student who had accompanied him on his previous journey. Linnaeus described his findings from the expedition in the book ''Wästgöta-Resa'', published the next year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koerner115&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt159&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning from the journey the Government decided Linnaeus should take on another expedition to the southernmost province [[Scania]]. This journey was postponed, as Linnaeus felt too busy.&lt;ref name=nrm.se/&gt;

In 1747, Linnaeus was given the title [[archiater]], or chief physician, by the Swedish king [[Adolf Frederick of Sweden|Adolf Frederick]]—a mark of great respect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt165&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he was elected member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences in Berlin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver167&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scania====
In the spring of 1749, Linnaeus could finally journey to [[Scania]], again commissioned by the Government. With him he brought his student, Olof Söderberg. On the way to Scania, he made his last visit to his brothers and sisters in Stenbrohult since his father had died the previous year. The expedition was similar to the previous journeys in most aspects, but this time he was also ordered to find the best place to grow [[walnut]] and [[Sorbus intermedia|Swedish whitebeam]] trees; these trees were used by the military to make rifles. The journey was successful, and Linnaeus' observations were published the next year in ''Skånska Resa''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt198-205&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=198–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Koerner116&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Koerner|Koerner, Lisbet]]|year=1999|page=116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rector of Uppsala University===
[[Image:CarlvonLinne Hammarby.jpg|thumb|right|The Linnaeus summer home at his Hammarby estate]]

[[Image:CarlvonLinne Garden.jpg|thumb|right|The Linnaean garden]]

In 1750, Linnaeus became rector of Uppsala University, starting a period where specifically natural sciences were esteemed.&lt;ref name=nrm.se/&gt; Perhaps the most important contribution he made during his time at Uppsala was to teach; many of his students travelled to various places in the world to collect botanical samples. Linnaeus called the best of these students his &quot;apostles&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gribbin56-57&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Gribbin|Mary, Gribbin]]|year=2008|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lectures were normally very popular and were often held in the Botanical Garden. He tried to teach the students to think for themselves and not trust anybody, not even him. Even more popular than the lectures were the botanical excursions made every Saturday during summer, where Linnaeus and his students explored the flora and fauna in the vicinity of Uppsala.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt206&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=173–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Publishing of ''Philosophia Botanica'' ====
Linnaeus published ''[[Philosophia Botanica]]'' in 1751. The book contained a complete survey of the taxonomy system he had been using in his earlier works. It also contained information of how to keep a journal on travels and how to maintain a botanical garden.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt221&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Publishing of ''Species Plantarum'' ====
Linnaeus published ''[[Species Plantarum]]'', the work which is now internationally accepted as the starting point of modern [[botanical nomenclature]], in 1753. The first volume was issued on May 24, the second volume followed on August 16&lt;ref&gt;ICBN (''Vienna Code'') Art. 13.5, ex. 13.3.&lt;/ref&gt; of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;The date of issue of both volumes was later, for practical purposes, arbitrarily set on May 1, see Stearn, W.T. (1957), The preparation of the ''Species Plantarum'' and the introduction of binomial nomenclature, in: Species Plantarum, A Facsimile of the first edition, London, Ray Society: 72 and ICBN (''Vienna Code'') Art. 13.5: &quot;The two volumes of Linnaeus’s Species plantarum, ed. 1 (1753), which appeared in May and August, 1753, respectively, are treated as having been published simultaneously on 1 May 1753.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1217339 | author = Sprague, T.A. | year = 1953 | title = Linnaeus as a Nomenclaturist | url = http://jstor.org/stable/1217339| journal = Taxon | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 40–46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contained 1,200 pages and was published in two volumes; it described over 7,300 species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gribbin47&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Gribbin|Mary, Gribbin]]|year=2008|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver198-199&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|pages=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year the king dubbed him knight of the [[Order of the Polar Star]], the first civilian in Sweden to become a knight in this order. He was then seldom seen not wearing the order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt166&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ennoblement====
Linnaeus felt Uppsala was too noisy and unhealthy, so he bought two farms in 1758: Hammarby and Sävja. The next year, he bought a neighbouring farm, Edeby. He spent the summers at Hammarby with his family, first only a small one-storey house, but he expanded it with a new, bigger main building in 1762.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koerner116&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt219&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hammarby, Linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants that could not be grown in the Botanical Garden in Uppsala. He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766, where he moved his library and collection of plants. A fire that destroyed about one third of Uppsala and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt220-224&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=220–224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the initial release of ''Systema Naturae'' in 1735, the book had been expanded and reprinted several times; the tenth edition was released in 1758. This edition established itself as the starting point for [[zoological nomenclature]], the equivalent of ''Species Plantarum''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gribbin47&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt6&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish king Adolf Frederick granted Linnaeus [[nobility]] in 1757, but he was not [[ennobled]] until 1761. With his ennoblement, he took the name Carl von Linné (Latinized as ''Carolus a Linné''), 'Linné' being a shortened and gallicised version of 'Linnæus', and the German title '[[von]]' signifying his ennoblement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt171&quot;/&gt; The noble family's [[coat of arms]] prominently features a twinflower, one of Linnaeus' favourite plants; it was given the scientific name ''Linnaea borealis'' in his honour by [[Jan Frederik Gronovius|Gronovius]].  The shield in the coat of arms is divided into thirds: red, black and green for the three kingdoms of nature (animal, mineral and vegetable) in Linnaean classification; in the center is an egg &quot;to denote Nature, which is continued and perpetuated ''in ovo''.&quot; At the bottom is a phrase in Latin, borrowed from the [[Aeneid]], which reads &quot;FAMAM EXTENDERE FACTIS&quot;: We extend our fame by our deeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt199&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt229-230&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=229–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gribbin62&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Gribbin|Mary, Gribbin]]|year=2008|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last years===
[[Image:LinnéUppsalaDom.jpg|thumb|right|[[Headstone]] of Carl Linnaeus and his son [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger]]]]

Linnaeus was relieved of his duties in the Royal Swedish Academy of Science in 1763, but continued his work there as usual for more than ten years after.&lt;ref name=nrm.se/&gt; He stepped down as rector at Uppsala University in December 1772, mostly due to his declining health.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koerner56&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt245&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnaeus' last years were troubled by illness. He had suffered from a disease called the Uppsala fever in 1764, but survived thanks to the care of Rosén. He got [[sciatica]] in 1773, and the next year, he had a stroke which partially paralysed him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt232&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered a second stroke in 1776, losing the use of his right side and leaving him bereft of his memory; while still able to admire his own writings, he could not recognize himself as their author.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver243-245&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Stöver|Stöver, Dietrich Johann Heinrich]]|year=1974|pages=243–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Broberg42&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Broberg|Broberg, Gunnar]]|year=2006|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1777, he had another stroke which greatly weakened him, and eventually led to his death on 10 January 1778 in Hammarby.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt245&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gribbin63&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Gribbin|Mary, Gribbin]]|year=2008|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his desire to be buried in Hammarby, he was interred in [[Uppsala Cathedral]] on 22 January.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalgeographic4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Name Giver|journal=National Geographic|date=2007-06|first=David|last=Quammen|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|page=4|id= |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/06/linnaeus-name-giver/david-quammen-text/4|format=|accessdate=2010-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson104-106&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Anderson|Anderson, Margaret J.]]|year=1997|pages=104–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His library and collections were left to his widow Sara and their children. [[Joseph Banks]], an English botanist, wanted to buy the collection, but Carl refused and moved the collection to Uppsala. However, in 1783 Carl died and Sara inherited the collection, having outlived both her husband and son. She tried to sell it to Banks, but he was no longer interested; instead an acquaintance of his agreed to buy the collection. The acquaintance was a 24 year old medical student, [[James Edward Smith]], who bought the whole collection: 14,000 plants, 3,198 insects, 1,564 shells, about 3,000 letters and 1,600 books. Smith founded the [[Linnean Society of London]] five years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson104-106&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt2001-238-240&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt2001|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2001|pages=238–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Linnaeus' time as Professor and Rector of Uppsala University, he taught many devoted students, 17 of whom he called &quot;apostles&quot;. They were the most promising, most committed students, and all of them made botanical expeditions to various places in the world, often with his help. The amount of this help varied; sometimes he used his influence as Rector to grant his apostles a place on an expedition or a scholarship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt189-190&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=189–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; To most of the apostles he gave instructions of what to find on their journeys. Abroad, the apostles collected and organised new plants, animals and minerals according to Linnaeus' system. Most of them also gave some of their collection to Linnaeus when their journey was finished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broberg37-39&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Broberg|Broberg, Gunnar]]|year=2006|pages=37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to these students, the Linnaean system of taxonomy spread through the world without Linnaeus ever having to travel outside Sweden after his return from Holland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson92-93&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Anderson|Anderson, Margaret J.]]|year=1997|pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British botanist [[William T. Stearn]] notes without Linnaeus' new system, it would not have been possible for the apostles to collect and organise so many new specimens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt184-185&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the apostles died during their expeditions.

===Early expeditions===
Christopher Tärnström, the first apostle and a 43-year-old pastor with a wife and children, made his journey in 1746. He boarded a [[Swedish East India Company]] ship headed for [[China]]. Tärnström never reached his destination, having died of a tropical fever on [[Côn Sơn Island]] the same year. Tärnström's widow blamed Linnaeus for making her children fatherless, causing Linnaeus to prefer sending out younger, unmarried students after Tärnström.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt185-186&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six other apostles later died on their expeditions, including the apostles [[Pehr Forsskål]] and [[Pehr Löfling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt184-185&quot;/&gt;

Two years after Tärnström's expedition, Finnish-born [[Pehr Kalm]] set out as the second apostle to North America. There he spent two-and-a-half years studying the flora and fauna of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Canada. Linnaeus was overjoyed when Kalm returned, bringing back with him many pressed flowers and seeds. At least 90 of the 700 North American species described in ''Species Plantarum'' had been brought by Kalm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson93-94&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Anderson|Anderson, Margaret J.]]|year=1997|pages=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cook expeditions and Japan===
[[Daniel Solander]] was living in Linnaeus' house during his time as a student in Uppsala. Linnaeus was very fond of him, promising Solander his oldest daughter's hand in marriage. On Linnaeus' recommendation, Solander travelled to England in 1760, where he met the English botanist [[Joseph Banks]]. With Banks, Solander joined [[James Cook]] on his expedition to Oceania on the ''[[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' in 1768-71.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson96&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Anderson|Anderson, Margaret J.]]|year=1997|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt191-192&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solander was not the only apostle to journey with James Cook; [[Anders Sparrman]] followed on the ''[[HMS Resolution (1771)|Resolution]]'' in 1772–75 bound for, among others, Oceania and South America. Sparrman made many other expeditions, one of them to South Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt192-193&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most famous and successful apostle was [[Carl Peter Thunberg]], who embarked on a nine-year expedition in 1770. He stayed in South Africa for three years, then travelled to Japan. All foreigners in Japan were forced to stay on the island of [[Dejima]] outside [[Nagasaki]], so it was thus hard for Thunberg to study the flora. He did, however, manage to persuade some of the translators to bring him different plants, and he also found plants in the gardens of Dejima. He returned to Sweden in 1779, one year after Linnaeus' death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunt193-194&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Blunt|Blunt, Wilfrid]]|year=2004|pages=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major publications==
{{Main|Carl Linnaeus bibliography}}

===''Systema Naturae''===
[[Image:Linnaeus1758-title-page.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of the 10th edition of ''Systema Naturæ'' (1758)]]

{{Main|Systema Naturae|10th edition of Systema Naturae}}

The first edition of ''Systema Naturae'' was printed in the Netherlands in 1735. It was a twelve-page work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/15373 Linnæus, C. 1735.] Systema naturæ, sive regna tria naturæ systematice proposita per classes, ordines, genera, &amp; species. - pp. [1-12]. Lugduni Batavorum. (Haak).&lt;/ref&gt; By the time it reached its 10th edition (1758), it classified 4,400 species of animals and 7,700 species of plants. In it, the unwieldy names mostly used at the time, such as &quot;''Physalis annua ramosissima, ramis angulosis glabris, foliis dentato-serratis''&quot;, were supplemented with concise and now familiar &quot;binomials&quot;, composed of the generic name, followed by a specific epithet - in the case given, ''[[Physalis angulata]]''. These binomials could serve as a label to refer to the species. Higher taxa were constructed and arranged in a simple and orderly manner. Although the system, now known as [[binomial nomenclature]], was developed by the Bauhin brothers (see [[Gaspard Bauhin]] and [[Johann Bauhin]]) almost 200 years earlier, Linnaeus was the first to use it consistently throughout the work, also in monospecific genera, and may be said to have popularised it within the scientific community.

Linnaeus named taxa in ways that struck him as common-sensical; for example, human beings are ''Homo sapiens'' (see [[sapience]]).  He also briefly described a ''second'' human species, ''Homo [[:wikt:troglodyte|troglodyte]]s'' (&quot;cave-dwelling man&quot;). This name was based on a figure and description by Bontius 1658,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bontius, I. 1658&quot;&gt;p. 84 in [http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/39776 Bontius, I. 1658.] Historiæ naturalis &amp; medicæ Indiæ Orientalis libri sex. - pp. 1-226, in: Piso, G.: De Indiæ Utriusque re naturali et medica libri quatuordecim. Quorum contenta pagina sequens exhibet. -- pp. [1-22], 1-327 [= 329], [1-5], 1-39, 1-226. Amstelædami. (Elzevier).&lt;/ref&gt; the figure referred to a female Indonesian or Malayan human and the description to an [[orang utan]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 64 in [http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl?PPN146155742 Blumenbach, J. F. 1779.] Handbuch der Naturgeschichte. Mit Kupfern. [Erster Theil]. - pp. [1-13], 1-448, Tab. I-II [= 1-2]. Göttingen. (J. C. Dieterich).&lt;/ref&gt; The group &quot;[[Mammal]]ia&quot; was named for their mammary glands because one of the defining characteristics of mammals is they nurse their young.

===''Species Plantarum''===
{{Main|Species Plantarum}}

''Species Plantarum'' (or, more fully, ''Species Plantarum, exhibentes plantas rite cognitas, ad genera relatas, cum differentiis specificis, nominibus trivialibus, synonymis selectis, locis natalibus, secundum systema sexuale digestas'')  was first published in 1753, as a two-volume work. Its prime importance is perhaps that it is the primary starting point of [[botanical nomenclature|plant nomenclature]] as it exists today.

In 1754, Linnaeus divided the plant Kingdom into 25 classes. One, [[Cryptogamia]], included all the plants with concealed reproductive parts (algae, fungi, mosses and liverworts and ferns).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoek, Mann and Jahns 95&quot;&gt;Hoek, C.van den, Mann, D.G. and Jahns, H.M. 2005.

====''Genera Plantarum''====
{{Main|Genera Plantarum}}

''Genera plantarum: eorumque characteres naturales secundum numerum, figuram, situm, et proportionem omnium fructificationis partium'' was first published in 1737, delineating plant genera. It reached its sixth edition by 1764.

====''Systema Plantarum''====
''Systema Plantarum'', published posthumously in 1779, integrated the botanical aspects of ''Systema Naturae'' with ''Species Plantarum'' (and, defacto, ''Genera Plantarum'') to make a complete work.  This work actually presented the fourth edition of ''Species Plantarum.''  A follow-up titled ''[[Supplementum Plantarum]]'' was published by [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger]] in 1782.

====''Philosophia Botanica''====
{{Main|Philosophia Botanica}}

''Philosophia Botanica'' (1751) was a summation of Linnaeus's thinking on plant classification and nomenclature, and an elaboration of the work he had previously published in ''[[Fundamenta Botanica]]'' (1736) and ''[[Critica Botanica]]'' (1737). Other publications forming part of his plan to reform the foundations of botany include his ''[[Classes Plantarum]]'' and ''[[Bibliotheca Botanica]]'': all were printed in Holland (as well as ''[[Genera Plantarum]]'' (1737) and ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735)), the ''Philosophia'' being simultaneously released in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;Stafleu, Frans A. 1971.

==Linnaean taxonomy==
[[Image:Linnaeus - Regnum Animale (1735).png|thumb|right|Table of the Animal Kingdom (&quot;Regnum Animale&quot;) from the 1st edition of ''Systema Naturæ'' (1735)]]

{{Main|Linnaean taxonomy}}

The establishment of universally accepted conventions for the naming of organisms was Linnaeus' main contribution to taxonomy—his work marks the starting point of binomial nomenclature.  During the 18th century expansion of natural history knowledge, Linnaeus also developed what became known as the ''Linnaean taxonomy''; the system of [[scientific classification]] now widely used in the [[biology|biological sciences]].

The Linnaean system classified nature within a [[nested hierarchy]], starting with three [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]. Kingdoms were divided into Classes and they, in turn, into Orders, which were divided into Genera (singular: genus), which were divided into Species (singular: species). Below the rank of species he sometimes recognized taxa of a lower (unnamed) rank (for plants these are now called &quot;[[Variety (botany)|varieties]]&quot;).

Linnaeus' groupings were based upon shared physical characteristics. Only his groupings for animals survive, and the groupings themselves have been significantly changed since their conception, as have the principles behind them. Nevertheless, Linnaeus is credited with establishing the idea of a hierarchical structure of classification which is based upon observable characteristics. While the underlying details concerning what are considered to be scientifically valid &quot;observable characteristics&quot; have changed with expanding knowledge (for example, [[DNA]] sequencing, unavailable in Linnaeus' time, has proven to be a tool of considerable utility for classifying living organisms and establishing their [[Phylogenetics|evolutionary relationships]]), the fundamental principle remains sound.

[[Image:Antropomorpha12c.png|thumb|right|Detail from the 6th edition of ''Systema Naturae'' (1748) describing &quot;Antropomorpha&quot; with a division between ''Homo'' and ''Simia'']]

According to German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]], the question of man's origin began with Linnaeus.

''It does not please [you] that I've placed [[humans|Man]] among the [[Anthropomorpha|Antropomorpha]], but man learns to [[know thyself|know himself]]. Let's not quibble over words. It will be the same to me whatever name we apply. But I seek from you and from the whole world a [[genus|generic]] difference between man and [[simia]]n that [follows] from the principles of [[Natural history|Natural History]].&lt;ref group=a&gt;Others who followed were more inclined to give humans a special place in classification; [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] in the first edition of his ''Manual of Natural History'' (1779), proposed that the primates be divided into the [[Quadrumana]] (four-handed, i.e. apes and monkeys) and [[Bimana]] (two-handed, i.e. humans). This distinction was taken up by other naturalists, most notably [[Georges Cuvier]]. Some elevated the distinction to the level of [[order (biology)|order]]. However, the many affinities between humans and other primates — and especially the great apes — made it clear that the distinction made no scientific sense. [[Charles Darwin]] wrote, in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' in 1871:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The greater number of naturalists who have taken into consideration the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach|Blumenbach]] and [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]], and have placed man in a separate Order, under the title of the Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by [[Theodor Ludwig Wilhelm Bischoff|Bischoff]], [[Christoph Theodor Aeby|Aeby]], and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the [[theology|theologians]] against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theological concerns were twofold: first, putting man at the same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man was assumed to have in the [[great chain of being]], and second, because the Bible says man was created in the [[image of God]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis1:26-27&amp;version=KJV&lt;/ref&gt;, if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well. This was something many could not accept.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frängsmyr171-172&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr et al.]]|year=1983|pages=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between [[worldview]]s based on [[science]] and [[theology]] that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, [[creation–evolution controversy]] began in earnest with the publication of [[On the Origin of Species]] by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1859.

After such criticism, Linnaeus felt he needed to explain himself more clearly. The 10th edition of ''Systema Naturae'' introduced new terms, including ''Mammalia'' and ''Primate'', the latter of which would replace ''Antropomorpha''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frängsmyr175&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr et al.]]|year=1983|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new classification received less criticism, but many natural historians still believed he had demoted humans from their former place to rule over nature, not be a part of it.  Linnaeus believed that man biologically belongs to the animal kingdom and had to be included in it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frängsmyr191-192&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr et al.]]|year=1983|pages=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Dieta Naturalis'', he said, &quot;One should not vent one's wrath on animals, Theology decree that man has a soul and that the animals are mere 'aoutomata mechanica,' but I believe they would be better advised that animals have a soul and that the difference is of nobility.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frängsmyr166&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr et al.]]|year=1983|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hoppius Anthropomorpha.png|thumb|right|''Anthropomorpha'' depicted in ''Amoenitates Academicae'' (1763), Bontius' caveman (&quot;Troglodyta bontii&quot;) is on the far left.]]

Linnaeus added a second human species in ''Systema Naturae'', the ''Homo troglodytes'' or caveman.&lt;ref&gt;p. 24 in [http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl?PPN362053006 Linnæus, C. 1758.] ''Systema naturæ per regna tria naturæ, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis. Tomus I.'' Editio decima, reformata. - pp. [1-4], 1-824. Holmiæ. (Salvius).&lt;/ref&gt; This name was based on a figure and description by Bontius from 1658, which referred to a female [[Indonesian]] or Malayan human and the description to an [[orang utan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bontius, I. 1658&quot;/&gt; In these times, tales on human species were based on myths from people who claimed they had seen something looking like a human. Most of these tales were scientifically accepted, and in early editions of ''Systema Naturae'', many mythical animals were included, such as the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], [[dragon]] and [[unicorn]]. Linnaeus placed them under the category ''[[Animalia Paradoxa|Paradoxa]]''; the Swedish historian [[Gunnar Broberg]] thought Linnaeus was trying to offer a natural explanation and demystify the world of superstition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frängsmyr176-177&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr et al.]]|year=1983|pages=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus tried to classify the mythical creatures, and to discover if, for example, the ''Homo troglodytes'' existed.  He asked the Swedish East Indian Trade Company to search for one. They did not find any signs of its existence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frängsmyr186&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr et al.]]|year=1983|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broberg believes the new human species Linnaeus described were monkeys or native people clad in skins to frighten colonial settlers, whose appearance had been exaggerated in accounts to Linnaeus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frängsmyr187&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr et al.]]|year=1983|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1771, Linné published another name for a nonhuman primate in the genus ''Homo'', which was ''Homo lar''&lt;ref&gt;p. 521 in [http://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/spa/Libro.php?Libro=947 Linné, C. a 1771.] Mantissa plantarum altera generum editionis VI. et specierum editionis II. - pp. [1-7], 144-588. Holmiæ. (Salvius).&lt;/ref&gt;; this name is used for the [[lar gibbon]], as ''Hylobates lar'' (Linné, 1771).

==Commemoration==
Anniversaries of Linnaeus' birth, especially in centennial years, have been marked by major celebrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Östholm&quot;&gt;&quot;Making Memorials: Early Celebrations of Linnaeus&quot; by Hanna Östholm, from Special Issue No. 8 of ''The Linnean'' (Newsletter and Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London) [http://www.linnean.org/fileadmin/images/Linnean/Special_Issue_8_-_The_Linneaen_Legacy.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1807, events were held in Sweden that included Linnaeus' daughters and apostles, such as Afzelius who was then head of the short-lived [[Linnéska institutet]].  A century later, celebrations of the bicentennial expanded globally and were even larger in Sweden.  At Uppsala University, honorary doctorates were given to [[Ernst Haeckel]], [[Francis Darwin]] and [[Selma Lagerlöf]], among others.  The memorials were so numerous that newspaper columnists began to tire of them and printed [[caricature]]s of the esteemed Linnaeus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/history/karikatyr.html |title=Linné on line - Caricatures of Linnaeus |publisher=Linnaeus.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1917, on the 210th anniversary of Linnaeus' birth, the [[Swedish Linnaeus Society]] was founded and proceeded to restore the [[Linnaean Garden]], which had fallen into disrepair.  In 2007, tricentennial celebrations were held.  During that year a documentary titled [[Expedition Linnaeus]] was produced, which was intended to increase public understanding of and respect for nature.

The [[Linnean Society of London]] has awarded the [[Linnean Medal]] for excellence in [[botany]] or [[zoology]] since 1888. Starting in 1978, in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the death of Linnaeus, the [[Bicentenary Medal of the Linnean Society]] has been awarded in recognition of work done by a biologist under the age of forty.

The Royal Botanic Garden of [[Edinburgh]] holds a monument to Linnaeus, near the hothouses. It was designed by the noted Scots architect [[Robert Adam]] in 1778. It has a portrait head in low relief set on an oval urn. It was erected in 1779 by [[Dr John Hope]] (1725–1760) Regius Keeper of the Garden. It originally stood in the Botanic Garden on Haddington Place. Hope was the first to introduce the Linnean system of classification to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Monuments and Statues of Edinburgh, Michael T.R.B. Turnbull (Chambers) p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Linnean Society of New South Wales]] awards a bursary to assist botany, zoology or geology students at the [[University of Sydney]].

The [[Australian National University]] (ANU) campus has a road named Linnaeus Way, which runs past several biology buildings.&lt;ref&gt;http://campusmap.anu.edu.au/displaymap.asp?grid=ef54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustavus Adolphus College]] began its eponymous [[Linnaeus Arboretum]] in 1973.

The asteroid [[7412 Linnaeus]] and [[Linné (crater)]] on the Earth's moon were named in his honor.

The nightshade species ''[[Solanum linnaeanum]]'' and twinflower genus ''[[Linnaea]]'' were named in his honor.

Linnaeus has appeared on numerous Swedish [[postage stamp]]s and [[banknote]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Östholm&quot; /&gt; In 1986, a new 100 [[Swedish krona|kronor]] bill was introduced featuring a portrait of Linnaeus, drawings of pollinating plants from his ''Praeludia Sponsaliorum Plantarum'', a sketch of the Linnaean Garden and a quote, often described as Linnaeus' motto, from ''Philosophia Botanica'' which reads &quot;OMNIA MIRARI ETIAM TRITISSIMA&quot;: Find wonder in all things, even the most commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.riksbank.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=10571 |title=Sveriges Riksbank/Riksbanken - 100-kronor banknote |publisher=Riksbank.com |date=2006-01-01 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following approval by the [[Parliament of Sweden]], [[Växjö University]] and [[Kalmar College]] merged on 1 January 2010; the resulting institution was named [[Linnaeus University]] in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lnu.se/about-lnu/about-linnaeus-university?l=en About Linnaeus University], Linnaeus University website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''coastline''' is where the land meets the sea or ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition|year=2000|title=Coast|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/43/C0434300.html|accessdate=2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A precise line that can be called a coastline cannot be determined due to the dynamic nature of tides. The term &quot;'''coastal zone'''&quot; can be used instead, which is a spatial zone where interaction of the sea and land processes occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stephen A.|last=Nelson|title=Coastal Zones|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/geol204/coastalzones.htm|year=2007|accessdate=2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the terms coast and coastal are often used to describe a geographic location or region; for example, New Zealand's [[West Coast Region|West Coast]], or the [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coasts of the United States]].

A [[pelagic]] coast refers to a coast which fronts the open ocean, as opposed to a more sheltered coast in a [[Headlands and bays|gulf]] or [[Headlands and bays|bay]]. A [[shore]], on the other hand, can refer to parts of the land which adjoin any large body of water, including oceans (sea shore) and [[lake]]s (lake shore). Similarly, the somewhat related term &quot;[[Stream bed|bank]]&quot; refers to the land alongside or sloping down to a [[river]] (riverbank) or to a body of water smaller than a lake. &quot;Bank&quot; is also used in some parts of the world to refer to an artificial ridge of earth intended to retain the water of a river or [[pond]]. In other places this may be called a [[levee]].

While many scientific experts might agree on a common definition of the term &quot;coast&quot;, the delineation of the extents of a coast differ according to [[jurisdiction]], with many scientific and government authorities in various countries differing for economic and social policy reasons.

==Formation{{anchor|Formation of Coasts}}==
[[File:Porto Covo pano April 2009-4.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Atlantic rocky coastline, showing a surf area. Porto Covo, west coast of Portugal]]
The main agents responsible for deposition and [[erosion]] along coastlines are [[wind wave|waves]], tides and currents. The formation of coasts is also heavily influenced by their [[lithology]]. The harder the material the less likely it is to erode or suffer the effects of erosion. Variants in the rock create different-shaped coastlines.  

[[Tide]]s often determine the range over which [[sediment]] is deposited or eroded. Areas with high tidal ranges allow waves to reach farther up the shore, and areas with lower tidal ranges produce deposition at a smaller elevation interval. The tidal range is influenced by the size and shape of the coastline. Tides do not typically cause erosion by themselves; however, [[tidal bore]]s can erode as the waves surge up river [[Estuary|estuaries]] from the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (2002), p.421.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Grand Anse Beach Grenada.jpg|thumb|320p|right|Coastline of Grand Anse Beach, St. George's, [[Grenada]], [[West Indies]]]]
Waves erode coastline as they break on shore releasing their energy; the larger the wave the more energy it releases and the more sediment it moves. Coastlines with longer shores have more room for the waves to disperse their energy, while coasts with cliffs and short shore faces give little room for the wave energy to be dispersed. In these areas the wave energy breaking against the cliffs is higher, and air and water are compressed into cracks in the rock, forcing the rock apart, breaking it down. Sediment deposited by waves comes from eroded cliff faces and is moved along the coastline by the waves. 

Sediment deposited by rivers is the dominant influence on the amount of sediment located on a coastline.&lt;ref&gt;Easterbrook (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Today riverine deposition at the coast is often blocked by dams and other human regulatory devices, which remove the sediment from the stream by causing it to be deposited inland.

Like the ocean which shapes them, coasts are a dynamic environment with constant change. The Earth's natural processes, particularly [[sea level rise]]s, waves and various [[weather]] phenomena, have resulted in the [[erosion]], [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]] and reshaping of coasts as well as flooding and creation of [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and drowned river valleys ([[ria]]s).

==Environmental importance==
The coast and its adjacent areas on and off shore is an important part of a local [[ecosystem]] as the mixture of fresh water and [[salt]] water in [[estuary|estuaries]] provides many nutrients for marine life. Salt [[marsh]]es and [[beach]]es also support a diversity of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[insect]]s crucial to the [[food chain]].

The high level of [[biodiversity]] creates a high level of biological activity, which has attracted human activity for thousands of years.

==Human impacts==
===Human uses of coasts===
[[Image:Marbleheadcoastline.jpg|thumb|A settled coastline in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]]. Once a fishing port, the harbor is now dedicated to tourism and pleasure boating. Observe that the sand and rocks have been darkened by oil slick up to the high-water line.]]
[[Image:Tiburon.jpg|thumb|right|[[House]]s close to the coast, like these in [[Tiburon, California]], may be especially desirable properties.]]
An increasing part the global population inhabits coastal regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Sara|last=Goudarzi|title=Flocking to the Coast: World's Population Migrating into Danger|journal=Live Science|date=July 18, 2006|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060718_map_settle.html|accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the world's major cities have been built on or near good [[harbor]]s and have [[port]] facilities. Jurisdictions that are [[landlocked]] have achieved port status by such measures such as building [[canal]]s.

The coast is a crucial frontier and must be defended against military invaders, smugglers and illegal migrants. Fixed [[Coastal defenses]] have long been erected in many nations and coastal countries also require a [[navy]] and some form of [[coast guard]].

Coasts, especially those with [[beach]]es and warm water are an important draw for [[tourists]]. In many [[island nation]]s such as those of the Mediterranean, South Pacific and Caribbean, tourism is central to the economy. Coasts are popular destinations because of recreational activities such as [[human swimming|swimming]], [[fishing]], [[surfing]], [[boating]], and [[Sunlight#Sunbathing|sunbathing]]. [[Growth management]] can be a challenge for coastal [[local government|local authorities]] who often struggle to provide the [[infrastructure]] required by new residents.

===Threats to a coast===
Coasts also face many environmental challenges relating to human-induced impacts. The human influence on [[climate change]] is thought to be a contributing factor of an accelerated trend in [[sea level rise]] which threatens coastal habitat.

[[Marine pollution|Pollution]] can occur from a number of sources: [[Marine debris|garbage and industrial debris]], the [[transport]]ation of [[petroleum]] in [[tank ship|tankers]], increasing the probability of large [[oil spill]]s, small oil spills created by large and small vessels, which flush [[bilge]] water into the ocean.

Fishing has diminished due to [[Environmental effects of fishing|habitat degradation]], [[overfishing]], [[trawling]], [[bycatch]] and [[climate change]]. Since the growth of global fishing enterprises after the 1950s, intensive fishing has gone from a few concentrated areas to encompass nearly all fisheries. The scraping of the ocean floor in [[Bottom trawling|bottom dragging]] is devastating to coral, sponges and other long-lived species that do not recover quickly. This destruction alters the functioning of the ecosystem and can permanently alter species composition and biodiversity. Bycatch, the capture of unintended species in the course of fishing, is typically returned the ocean only to die from injuries or exposure. Bycatch represents approximately ¼ of all marine catch. In the case of shrimp capture, the bycatch is five times larger than the shrimp caught.

Also, the melting arctic ice will cause sea rise which will flood costal areas.

===Conservation===
Extraordinary population growth in the 20th century has placed stress on the planet’s ecosystems. For example, on [[Saint Lucia]], harvesting mangrove for timber and clearing for fishing drove the mangrove forests to low levels, resulting in a loss of habitat and spawning ground for marine life that was unique to the area. These forests also helped to stabilize the coastline. Conservation efforts since the 1980s have partially restored the ecosystem.


==Types of coast==

According to one principle of classification, an emergent coastline is a coastline which has experienced a fall in sea level, because of either a global sea level change, or local uplift. Emergent coastlines are identifiable by the coastal [[landform]]s, which are above the high tide mark, such as [[raised beach]]es. Alternatively, a submergent coastline is a coastline which has experienced a rise in sea level, due to a global sea level change, local [[subsidence]], or [[isostatic rebound]].  Submergent coastlines are identifiable by their submerged, or &quot;drowned&quot; landforms, such as [[ria]]s (drowned valleys) and [[fjord]]s.
{{Further|[[Emergent coastline]]|[[Submergent coastline]]}}

According to a second principle of classification, a concordant coastline is a coastline where bands of different rock types run parallel to the shore. These rock types are usually of alternating [[Geological resistance|resistance]], so the coastline forms distinctive landforms, such as coves. A discordant coastline is a type of coastline formed when rock types of alternating resistance run perpendicular to the shore.  Discordant coastlines feature distinctive landforms because the rocks are [[erosion|eroded]] by [[ocean]] [[wave]]s.  The less resistant rocks erode faster, creating [[inlet]]s or [[headlands and bays|bays]]; the more resistant rocks erode more slowly, remaining as [[headlands and bays|headlands]] or outcroppings.

== Coastal landforms ==
[[Image:Accreting coast Image6.svg|thumb|Coastal landforms. The feature shown here as a [[bay]] would, in certain (mainly southern) parts of [[Great Britain|Britain]], be called a [[cove]]. That between the cuspate foreland and the tombolo is a British bay.]]

===Cliff erosion===

* Much of the sediment deposited along a coast is the result of erosion of a surrounding [[Cliff]], or bluff. Sea Cliffs retreat landward because of the constant undercutting of slopes by waves.  If the slope/cliff being undercut is made of unconsolidated sediment it will erode at a much faster rate then a cliff made of bedrock.  (Easterbrook 1999).
*A [[Natural arch]] is formed when a sea stacks is eroded through by waves.
*[[Sea cave]]s are made when certain rock beds are more susceptible to erosion than the surrounding rock beds because of different areas of weakness. These areas are eroded at a faster pace creating a hole or crevasse that, through time, by means of wave action and erosion, becomes a cave.
*A [[stack (geology)|Stack]] is formed when a headland is eroded away by wave and wind action.
*A [[Stack (geology)|Stump]] is a shortened sea stack that has been eroded away or fallen because of instability.
* Wave-cut notches are caused by the undercutting of overhanging slopes which leads to increased stress on cliff material and a greater probability that the slope material will fall.  The fallen debris accumulates at the bottom of the cliff and is eventually removed by waves.
*A [[wave-cut platform]] forms after erosion and retreat of a sea cliff has been occurring for a long time.  Gently sloping wave-cut platforms develop early on in the first stages of cliff retreat.  Later the length of the platform decreases because the waves lose their energy as they break further off shore (Easterbrook 1999).

==Wildlife==
{{See also|Seashore wildlife|Coastal fish}}

===Animals===
[[Animal]]s living along the coast vary enormously, some live along coasts to nest like [[puffin]]s, [[sea turtle]]s and [[rockhopper penguin]]s. [[Gastropoda|Sea snails]] and various kinds of [[barnacle]]s live on the coast and scavenge on food deposited by the sea. Most coastal animals are used to humans in developed areas, such as [[dolphin]]s and [[seagulls]] who eat food thrown for them by tourists. Since the coastal areas are all part of the [[littoral zone]], there is a profusion of marine life found just off-coast. 

There are many kinds of [[seabird]]s on the coast. [[Pelican]]s and [[cormorant]]s join up with [[tern]]s and [[oystercatcher]]s to forage for fish and shellfish on the coast.
There are also sea lions on the coast of Wales and other countrys.

===Plants===
Coastal areas are famous for their [[kelp]] beds. Kelp is a fast growing [[seaweed]] that grows up to a [[metre]] a day. [[Coral]]s and [[sea anemone|anemone]]s are true animals, but live a similar lifestyle as plants do. [[Mangroves]] and [[salt marsh]] are important coastal vegetation types in topical and temperate environments respectively.

==Coastline statistics==
===The coastline problem===
At some time in the years immediately preceding 1951, [[Lewis Fry Richardson#Research on the length of coastlines and borders|Lewis Fry Richardson]] in researching the possible effect of border lengths on the probability of war noticed that the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] reported their measured border with [[Spain]] to be 987&amp;nbsp;km, but the Spanish reported it to be 1214&amp;nbsp;km. This was the beginning of the coastline problem, which is how to arrive at an estimate of a boundary that is infinite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=45–46|title=The Collected Papers of Lewis Fry Richardson: |volume=1, ''Meteorology and numerical analysis''|last=Drazin|contribution=Fractals|editor-first=Oliver M.|editor-last= Ashford|editor2-first= H.|editor2-last= Charnock|editor3-first= P. G.|editor3-last= Drazin|editor4-first= J. C. |editor4-last=Hunt|publisher=Cambridge University Press (CUP) Archive|year=1993|id=ISBN 0521382971, ISBN 9780521382977|first=P.G.|editor1-first=P. |editor1-last=Smoker}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevailing method of estimating a border (or coastline) was to lay off ''n'' equal straight-line segments of length ''ℓ'' with [[Caliper#Divider caliper|dividers]] on a map or aerial photograph. Each end of the segment must be on the boundary. Investigating the discrepancies in border estimation Richardson discovered what is now termed the '''Richardson Effect''': the sum of the segments is inversely proportional to the common length of the segments. In effect, the shorter the ruler, the longer the measured border; thus, the Spanish and Portuguese geographers were using different-length rulers.

The result most astounding to Richardson is that, as ''ℓ'' approaches zero, the length of the coastline approaches [[infinity]]. Richardson had believed, based on Euclidean geometry, that a coastline would approach a fixed length, as do similar estimations of regular geometric figures. For example, the [[perimeter]] of a regular [[polygon]] inscribed in a [[circle]] approaches the [[circumference]] with increasing numbers of sides (and decrease in the length of one side). In [[Geometric measure theory]] such a smooth curve as the circle that can be approximated by small straight segments with a definite limit is termed a [[rectifiable curve]].

===Describing a coastline===
More than a decade after Richardson's work was finished, [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] invented a new branch of [[mathematics]], [[fractal geometry]], to describe just such non-rectifiable complexes in nature as the infinite coastline.&lt;ref name=MB28&gt;Mandelbrot (1983) page 28.&lt;/ref&gt; His own definition of the new figure serving as the basis for his study is:&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot (1983), page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|I coined ''[[fractal]]'' from the [[Latin]] adjective ''fractus''. The corresponding Latin verb ''frangere'' means &quot;to break:&quot; to create irregular fragments. It is therefore sensible ... that, in addition to &quot;fragmented&quot; ... ''fractus'' should also mean &quot;irregular.&quot;}}

A key property of the fractal is [[self-similarity]]; that is, at any [[Scale (spatial)|scale]] the same general configuration appears. A coastline is perceived as bays alternating with promontories. No matter how greatly any one small section of coastline is magnified, a similar pattern of bays and promontories on bays and promontories appears, right down to the grains of sand. At that scale the coastline appears as a momentarily shifting, potentially infinitely long thread with a [[stochastic]] arrangement of bays and promontories formed from the small objects at hand. In such a real environment (as opposed to smooth curves) Mandelbrot asserts&lt;ref name=MB28/&gt; &quot;coastline length turns out to be an elusive notion that slips between the fingers of those who want to grasp it.&quot;

A coastline is definitely to be represented by a fractal. However, there are different kinds of fractals. A coastline is in &quot;a first category of fractals, namely curves whose fractal dimension is greater than 1.&quot; That last statement represents an extension by Mandelbrot of Richardson's thought. Mandelbrot's statement of the Richardson Effect is:&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot (1983), pages 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;L(\epsilon)\sim F\epsilon^{1-D}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where L, coastline length, a function of the measurement unit, ε, is approximated by the expression. F is a constant and D is a parameter that Richardson found depended on the coastline approximated by L. He gave no theoretical explanation but Mandelbrot identified L with a non-integer form of the [[Hausdorff dimension]], later the fractal dimension. Rearranging the right side of the expression obtains:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {F} {\epsilon^{D}} \cdot \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

where Fε&lt;sup&gt;-D&lt;/sup&gt; must be the number of units ε required to obtain L. The fractal dimension is the number of the dimensions of the figure being used to approximate the fractal: 0 for a dot, 1 for a line, 2 for a square. D in the expression is between 1 and 2, for coastlines typically less than 1.5. The broken line measuring the coast does not extend in one direction nor does it represent an area, but is intermediate. It can be interpreted as a thick line or band of width 2ε. More broken coastlines have greater D and therefore L is longer for the same ε. Mandelbrot showed that D is independent of ε.

'''Catatonia''' is a state of neurogenic motor immobility, and behavioral abnormality manifested by stupor. It was first described in 1874: ''Die Katatonie oder das Spannungirresein''&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20080209213229/http://www.entwicklung-der-psychiatrie.de/seiten/24.1_kahlbaum_die_katatonie.htm, Archived copy (Internet Archive)&lt;/ref&gt; (Catatonia or Tension Insanity). 

In the current ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (DSM-IV) it is not recognized as a separate disorder, but is associated with psychiatric conditions such as [[schizophrenia]] (catatonic type), [[bipolar disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[Clinical depression|depression]] and other mental disorders, as well as [[drug abuse]] or [[overdose]] (or both). It may also be seen in many medical disorders including infections (such as [[encephalitis]]), [[autoimmune disorder]]s, focal neurologic lesions (including strokes), metabolic disturbances and abrupt or overly rapid [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|benzodiazepine withdrawal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rosebush PI | coauthors = Mazurek MF. | year = 1996 | month = August | title = Catatonia after benzodiazepine withdrawal | journal = Journal of clinical psychopharmacology. | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 315–9 | pmid = 8835707 | doi = 10.1097/00004714-199608000-00007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Deuschle M, Lederbogen F |title=Benzodiazepine withdrawal-induced catatonia |journal=Pharmacopsychiatry |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=41–2 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11229621 |doi= 10.1055/s-2001-15188|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kanemoto K, Miyamoto T, Abe R |title=Ictal catatonia as a manifestation of de novo absence status epilepticus following benzodiazepine withdrawal |journal=Seizure |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=364–6 |year=1999 |month=September |pmid=10512781 |doi=10.1053/seiz.1999.0309 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1059-1311(99)90309-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It can be an adverse reaction to prescribed medication. It bears similarity to conditions such as [[encephalitis lethargica]] and [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]]. There are a variety of treatments available; [[benzodiazepine]]s are a first-line treatment strategy. Electro-convulsive therapy is also sometimes used. There is growing evidence for the effectiveness of [[NMDA antagonists]] for benzodiazepine resistant catatonia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniels-2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Daniels | first1 = J. | title = Catatonia: clinical aspects and neurobiological correlates. | journal = J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 371–80 | month =  | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.21.4.371 | pmid = 19996245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antipsychotics are sometimes employed but require caution as they can worsen symptoms and have serious adverse effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink &amp; Taylor&quot; /&gt;

==Clinical features==
Patients with catatonia may experience an extreme loss of motor skills or even constant hyperactive motor activity. Catatonic patients will sometimes hold rigid poses for hours and will ignore any external stimuli. Patients with catatonic excitement can suffer from exhaustion if not treated.  Patients may also show stereotyped, repetitive movements. 

They may show specific types of movement such as [[waxy flexibility]], in which they maintain positions after being placed in them by someone else, or ''gegenhalten'' (lit. &quot;counterhold&quot;), in which they resist movement in proportion to the force applied by the examiner. They may repeat meaningless phrases or speak only to repeat what the examiner says.

While catatonia is only identified as a symptom of [[schizophrenia]] in present psychiatric classifications, it is increasingly recognized as a syndrome with many faces. It appears as the Kahlbaum syndrome (retarded catatonia), malignant catatonia (neuroleptic malignant syndrome, toxic serotonin syndrome), and excited forms (delirious mania, catatonic excitement, [[oneirophrenia]]).&lt;ref name = &quot;Fink &amp; Taylor&quot;&gt;Fink M, Taylor MA: CATATONIA: A Clinician's Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment, Cambridge U Press, 2003&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has also been recognized as grafted on to [[autism spectrum disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;Dhossche D et al.: Catatonia in Autism Spectrum Disorders, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnostic criteria==
According to the [[DSM-IV]], the &quot;With catatonic features&quot; specifier can be applied if the clinical picture is dominated by at least two of the following:

* motor immobility as evidenced by [[catalepsy]] (including [[waxy flexibility]]) or [[stupor]]
* excessive motor activity (purposeless, not influenced by external stimuli)
* extreme negativism (motiveless resistance to all instructions or maintenance of a rigid posture against attempts to be moved) or mutism
* peculiarities of voluntary movement as evidenced by posturing, stereotyped movements, prominent mannerisms, or prominent grimacing
* [[echolalia]] or [[echopraxia]]

===Subtypes===
* '''[[Stupor]]''' is a motionless, [[apathy|apathetic]] state in which one is oblivious or does not react to external [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. [[motor skill|Motor activity]] is nearly non-existent. Individuals in this state make little or no eye contact with others and may be mute and rigid. One might remain in one position for a long period of time, and then go directly to another position immediately after the first position.

* '''Catatonic excitement''' is a state of constant purposeless [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]] and excitation. Individuals in this state are extremely hyperactive, although, as aforementioned, the activity seems to lack purpose.

*'''Malignant catatonia''' is an acute onset of excitement, fever, autonomic instability, delirium and may be fatal.&lt;ref&gt; Semple,David.&quot;oxford hand book of psychiatry&quot; oxford press. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catatonia rating scale===
Fink and Taylor developed a catatonia rating scale to identify the syndrome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink &amp; Taylor&quot; /&gt; A diagnosis is verified by a [[benzodiazepine]] or [[barbiturate]] test. The diagnosis is validated by the quick response to either benzodiazepines or [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT). While proven useful in the past, barbiturates are no longer commonly used in [[psychiatry]]; thus the option of either benzodiazepines or ECT.

==Treatment==
Initial treatment is aimed at providing relief from the catatonic state. [[Benzodiazepine]]s are the first line of treatment, and high doses are often required. A test dose of 1–2&amp;nbsp;mg of intramuscular [[lorazepam]] will often result in marked improvement within half an hour. In France, [[zolpidem]] has also been used in diagnosis, and response may occur within the same time period. Ultimately the underlying cause needs to be treated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink &amp; Taylor&quot; /&gt;

[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) is an effective treatment for catatonia as well as for most of the underlying causes (e.g. [[psychosis]], [[mania]], [[clinical depression|depression]]). [[Antipsychotic]]s should be used with care as they can worsen catatonia and are the cause of [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], a dangerous condition that can mimic catatonia and requires immediate discontinuation of the antipsychotic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink &amp; Taylor&quot; /&gt;

Excessive [[glutamate]] activity is believed to be involved in catatonia; when first-line treatment options fail, [[NMDA antagonists]] such as [[amantadine]] or [[memantine]] are used. Amantadine may have an increased incidence of tolerance with prolonged use and can cause psychosis, due to its additional effects on the dopamine system. Memantine has a more targeted pharmacological profile for the glutamate system, reduced incidence of psychosis and may therefore be preferred for individuals who cannot tolerate amantadine. [[Topiramate]], is another treatment option for resistant catatonia; it produces its therapeutic effects by producing glutamate antagonism via modulation of AMPA receptors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll-2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = BT. | last2 = Goforth | first2 = HW. | last3 = Thomas | first3 = C. | last4 = Ahuja | first4 = N. | last5 = McDaniel | first5 = WW. | last6 = Kraus | first6 = MF. | last7 = Spiegel | first7 = DR. | last8 = Franco | first8 = KN. | last9 = Pozuelo | first9 = L. | title = Review of adjunctive glutamate antagonist therapy in the treatment of catatonic syndromes. | url = http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/19/4/406 | journal = J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 406–12 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.19.4.406 | pmid = 18070843 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A version known as &quot;catatonia-like deterioration&quot; occurs in 12-17% of [[Autism spectrum disorder|autistic]] young adults.&lt;!--

--&gt; This form is made worse by antipsychotics. Unlike catatonic stupors, this deterioration happens very gradually. The only way to cure it is to keep the patient constantly active and the activities must have an end goal or they will not work. Stress must be reduced by not pressurising, keeping life predictable and by limiting choice as making choices is very stressful for catatonics.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

[[File:Edward Larsson 1885 I.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Larsson]]'s [[Cipher runes|rune cipher]] resembling that found on the [[:en:Kensington Runestone|Kensington Runestone]]. Also includes runically-unrelated [[:en:blackletter|blackletter]] writing style and [[:en:pigpen cipher|pigpen cipher]].]]
In [[cryptography]], a '''cipher''' (or '''cypher''') is an [[algorithm]] for performing [[encryption]] or [[decryption]] &amp;mdash; a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. An alternative, less common term is '''encipherment'''. In non-technical usage, a “cipher” is the same thing as a “[[code (cryptography)|code]]”; however, the concepts are distinct in cryptography. In [[classical cryptography]], ciphers were distinguished from codes.
Codes operated by substituting according to a large [[codebook]] which linked a random string of characters or numbers to a word or phrase.  For example, “UQJHSE” could be the code for “Proceed to the following coordinates”. When using a cipher the original information is known as [[plaintext]], and the encrypted form as '''[[ciphertext]]'''. The ciphertext message contains all the information of the plaintext message, but is not in a format readable by a human or computer without the proper mechanism to decrypt it; it should resemble random gibberish to those not intended to read it.

The operation of a cipher usually depends on a piece of auxiliary information, called a [[key (cryptography)|key]] or, in traditional [[NSA]] parlance, a '''cryptovariable.''' The encrypting procedure is varied depending on the key, which changes the detailed operation of the algorithm. A key must be selected before using a cipher to encrypt a message. Without knowledge of the key, it should be difficult, if not nearly impossible, to decrypt the resulting ciphertext into readable plaintext.

Most modern ciphers can be categorized in several ways
* By whether they work on blocks of symbols usually of a fixed size ([[block cipher]]s), or on a continuous stream of symbols ([[stream cipher]]s).
* By whether the same key is used for both encryption and decryption ([[symmetric key algorithm]]s), or if a different key is used for each ([[asymmetric key algorithm]]s). If the algorithm is symmetric, the key must be known to the recipient and sender and to no one else. If the algorithm is an asymmetric one, the enciphering key is different from, but closely related to, the deciphering key. If one key cannot be deduced from the other, the asymmetric key algorithm has the public/private key property and one of the keys may be made public without loss of confidentiality.

==Etymology of “Cipher”==
“Cipher” is alternatively spelled “cypher”; similarly “[[ciphertext]]” and “[[cyphertext]]”, and so forth.

The word “cipher” in former times meant “zero” and had the same origin: Middle French as ''&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;cifre&lt;/span&gt;'' and Medieval Latin as ''cifra,'' from the Arabic '''صفر''' ''ṣifr'' = zero (see [[0 (number)#Etymology|Zero — Etymology]]).  “Cipher” was later used for any decimal digit, even any number.  There are many theories about how the word “cipher” may have come to mean “encoding”:

*Encoding often involved numbers.
*The [[Roman Numerals|Roman number system]] was very cumbersome because there was no concept of zero (or empty space).  The concept of zero (which was also called “cipher”), which we all now think of as [[Natural number|natural]], was very alien in medieval Europe, so confusing and ambiguous to common Europeans that in arguments people would say “talk clearly and not so far fetched as a cipher”.  Cipher came to mean concealment of clear messages or encryption.
**The French formed the word “&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;chiffre&lt;/span&gt;” and adopted the Italian word “&lt;span lang=&quot;it&quot;&gt;zero&lt;/span&gt;”.
**The English used “zero” for “0”, and “cipher” from the word “ciphering” as a means of computing.
**The Germans used the words “Ziffer” (digit) and “Chiffre”.
**The Dutch still use the word &quot;cijfer&quot; to refer to a number.
**The Italians and the Spanish also use the word &quot;cifra&quot; to refer to a number.
Dr. [[Al-Kadi]]&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim A. Al-Kadi, “Cryptography and Data Security: Cryptographic Properties of Arabic”, proceedings of the Third Saudi Engineering Conference. Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: Nov 24-27, Vol 2:910-921., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
concluded that the Arabic word ''sifr'', for the digit zero, developed into the European technical term for encryption.

==Ciphers versus codes==
{{Main|Code (cryptography)}}
In non-technical usage, a “(secret) [[code (cryptography)|code]]” typically means a “cipher”. Within technical discussions, however, the words “code” and “cipher” refer to two different concepts. Codes work at the level of meaning — that is, words or phrases are converted into something else and this chunking generally shortens the message.

An example of this is the [[Telegraph code|Telegraph Code]] which was used to shorten long telegraph messages which resulted from entering into commercial contracts using exchanges of [[Telegram]]s.

Ciphers, on the other hand, work at a lower level: the level of individual letters, small groups of letters, or, in modern schemes, individual bits. Some systems used both codes and ciphers in one system, using  [[superencipherment]] to increase the security. In some cases the terms codes and ciphers are also used synonymously to substitution and transposition.

Historically, cryptography was split into a dichotomy of codes and ciphers; and coding had its own terminology, analogous to that for ciphers: “''encoding'', ''codetext'', ''decoding''” and so on.

However, codes have a variety of drawbacks, including susceptibility to [[cryptanalysis]] and the difficulty of managing a cumbersome [[codebook]]. Because of this, codes have fallen into disuse in modern cryptography, and ciphers are the dominant technique.

==Types of cipher==
There are a variety of different types of encryption. Algorithms used earlier in the [[history of cryptography]] are substantially different from modern methods, and modern ciphers can be classified according to how they operate and whether they use one or two keys.

===Historical ciphers===
Historical pen and paper ciphers used in the past are sometimes known as [[classical cipher]]s. They include simple [[substitution cipher]]s and [[transposition cipher]]s. For example “GOOD DOG” can be encrypted as “PLLX XLP” where “L” substitutes for “O”, “P” for “G”, and “X” for “D” in the message.  Transposition of the letters “GOOD DOG” can result in “DGOGDOO”. These simple ciphers and examples are easy to crack, even without plaintext-ciphertext pairs.

Simple ciphers were replaced by [[polyalphabetic substitution]] ciphers which changed the substitution alphabet for every letter.  For example “GOOD DOG” can be encrypted as “PLSX TWF” where “L”, “S”, and “W” substitute for “O”.  With even a small amount of known or estimated plaintext, simple polyalphabetic substitution ciphers and letter transposition ciphers designed for pen and paper encryption are easy to crack. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} It is possible to create a secure pen and paper cipher based on one-time pad with the help of a computer that generates random numbers [http://www.smartarchitects.co.uk/projects/pen-paper-encryption.html &quot;Unbreakable&quot; Pen&amp;Paper Encryption]. The low-point of such a system is complicated management of cipher tables in large deployments.

During the early twentieth century, electro-mechanical machines were invented to do encryption and decryption using transposition, polyalphabetic substitution, and a kind of “additive” substitution.  In [[rotor machine]]s, several rotor disks provided polyalphabetic substitution, while plug boards provided another substitution. Keys were easily changed by changing the rotor disks and the plugboard wires. Although these encryption methods were more complex than previous schemes and required machines to encrypt and decrypt, other machines such as the British [[Bombe]] were invented to crack these encryption methods.

===Modern ciphers===
Modern encryption methods can be divided by two criteria: by type of key used, and by type of input data.

By type of key used ciphers are divided into:
* [[symmetric key algorithm]]s ([[Private-key cryptography]]), where the same key is used for encryption and decryption, and
* [[asymmetric key algorithm]]s ([[Public-key cryptography]]), where two different keys are used for encryption and decryption.

In a symmetric key algorithm (e.g., [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] and [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]]), the sender and receiver must have a shared key set up in advance and kept secret from all other parties; the sender uses this key for encryption, and the receiver uses the same key for decryption.  The [[Feistel cipher]] uses a combination of substitution and transposition techniques. Most block cipher algorithms are based on this structure.  In an asymmetric key algorithm (e.g., [[Rivest Shamir Adleman|RSA]]), there are two separate keys: a ''public key'' is published and enables any sender to perform encryption, while a ''private key'' is kept secret by the receiver and enables only him to perform correct decryption.

Ciphers can be distinguished into two types by the type of input data:
* [[block cipher]]s, which encrypt block of data of fixed size, and
* [[stream cipher]]s, which encrypt continuous streams of data

[[File:Cipher-taxonomy.svg|550px|center]]

==Key size and vulnerability==
In a pure mathematical attack (i.e., lacking any other information to help break a cipher), three factors above all, count:
* Mathematical advances that allow new attacks or weaknesses to be discovered and exploited.
* Computational power available, i.e., the computing power which can be brought to bear on the problem. It is important to note that average performance/capacity of a single computer is not the only factor to consider. An adversary can use multiple computers at once, for instance, to increase the speed of [[exhaustive search]] for a key (i.e., “brute force” attack) substantially.
* [[Key size]], i.e., the size of key used to encrypt a message. As the key size increases, so does the complexity of [[exhaustive search]] to the point where it becomes infeasible to crack encryption directly.
Since the desired effect is computational difficulty, in theory one would choose an [[algorithm]] and desired difficulty level, thus decide the key length accordingly.

An example of this process can be found at [http://www.keylength.com/ Key Length] which uses multiple reports to suggest that a symmetric cipher with 128 [[binary digit|bit]]s, an asymmetric cipher with 3072 bit keys, and an [[Elliptic curve cryptography|elliptic curve cipher]] with 512 bits, all have similar difficulty at present.

[[Claude Shannon]] proved, using information theory considerations, that any theoretically unbreakable cipher must have keys which are at least as long as the plaintext, and used only once: [[one-time pad]].

'''Country music''' (or '''country and western''') is a blend of traditional and popular [[American music|US musical]] forms traditionally found in the [[Southern United States]] and the [[Maritimes|Canadian Maritimes]] that evolved rapidly beginning in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson&quot;&gt;Peterson, Richard A. (1999). ''Creating Country Music: Fabricating Authenticity'', p. 9.

The term ''country music'' gained popularity in the 1940s when the earlier term ''[[hillbilly]] music'' came to be seen as denigrating. ''Country music'' was widely embraced in the 1970s, while ''Country and Western'' has declined in use since that time, except in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], where it is still commonly used.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson&quot; /&gt; However, in the [[Southwestern United States]] a different mix of [[American ancestry|ethnic groups]] created the music that became the [[Western music (North America)|Western music]] of the term ''Country and Western''.

Country music has produced the two top selling solo artists of all time in the United States. [[Elvis Presley]], who was known early on as “the Hillbilly Cat” and was a regular on the radio program ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jim-reeves.com/hayride.html Jim-reeves.com] ''Jim-reeves.com''&lt;/ref&gt; went on to become a defining figure in the emergence of [[rock and roll]]. With 129.5 million albums sold, Presley is the top-domestic-selling solo artist in U.S. history. Contemporary musician [[Garth Brooks]], with 128 million albums sold, is the second best-selling solo artist in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acountry.com/music/2008_academy_of_country_music_awards_winners/ Acountry.com] &quot;The Academy of Country Music also honored Garth Brooks with the first-ever Crystal Milestone Award. The award is given to an artist or industry leader to commemorate a specific, remarkable achievement. With 128 million unit sales, Brooks has been certified the second best top-selling solo recording artist in U.S. history.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

While album sales of most musical genres have declined since about 2005, country music experienced one of its best years in 2006, when, during the first six months, U.S. sales of country albums increased by 17.7 percent to 36 million.
